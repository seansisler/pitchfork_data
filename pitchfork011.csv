Cranes,Cranes,by: Mia Clarke,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a021ea9e61561daa44d1/1:1/w_160/911d0564.jpg,2009-01-16 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12576-cranes/,Dadaphonic,"As one of the major players in the UK's original shoegaze scene, along with groups such as Slowdive, Lush, and Ride, Cranes were one of the first rock bands to put the dreary seaside town of Portsmouth on the musical map. A series of high-profile shows in 1992 supporting the Cure on a world tour opened the gates to a wider audience, and their appeal began to stretch through to the goth community, especially to fans of the dreamier echelons (This Mortal Coil, Dead Can Dance). Since 1997, the group-- led by brother and sister Jim and Alison Shaw-- has taken intermittent breaks; the release of Future Songs in 2001 was followed by a live album, and then their most recent full-length, Particles and Waves, appeared in 2004. Cranes' last two albums signified a musical shift by extending their interest in glimmering electronic melodies and more gently contemplative song structures, eschewing the distortion-driven dissonance and upfront drumbeats of past recordings. Their self-titled ninth studio album continues this keyboard-focused pattern. Taken as a whole, the songs are stronger and more coherent than those on Particles and Waves and inhabit a more elusive and intriguing space. On tracks such as ""Feathers"" and ""Wires"", the guitar work remains delicate in tone, and slides with casual grace into the lovely pulse of the keyboard motif, creating a mysterious swirl of stripped-down beauty. Listening to it feels like walking into dark forest, finding an ancient music box buried under a pile of moss, and watching the ballerina inside pivot to an awkward interior clockwork. The metaphor is reinforced by the brilliant artwork featuring dandelion skeletons peeking through a dense midnight blue, lyrics about long walks and changing weather pressure, and the wintry landscape painting the recording. Alison Shaw's love-it-or-hate-it voice remains a constant presence in the band's ever-evolving sound, right down to the suitably thin, reverb-washed production. ""Unique"" doesn't do justice: She has a decidedly childlike cadence, and while some might argue that her vocals complemented Cranes' intense earlier sound better than the more recent material, her singing is the most definitive quality of the band and serves to give their music an edge. Without it, Cranes might veer toward the easy glide of the Sea and Cake discography and would verge on being a little too smooth and carefully trodden. On ""Move Along"", Shaw is at her best, as she breathes life into the sparse melancholy that ebbs and flows like the sea she describes. While Cranes will not offer many surprises to longtime fans, its focus seems to be on the theme of searching for something, and it communicates this feeling with a persuasiveness that continues to build right through to the end. From the crystal-clear droplets of electronic glitches that form the delightful instrumental opening track, ""Diorama"", to the final song ""High and Low"", which comes to a close with the wistful mantra ""Where's the place between high and low?/ Maybe one day I'll know/ I've still got a long way to go"", one gets the feeling that Cranes are on a path that will keep them rising to the challenges they set for themselves.","On their ninth studio disc, these first-wave shoegazers continue their move in the direction of glimmering electronic melodies and gently contemplative song structures that highlight Alison Shaw's unique voice.

Haymaker!,The Gourds,by: Stephen M. Deusner,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a02d13d1975652138307/1:1/w_160/0bb771b2.jpg,2009-01-16 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12587-haymaker/,Yep Roc,"The exclamation point in the title of the Gourds' latest album doesn't lie: The Austin-based band plays an emphatic, exclamatory amalgam of Americana styles, ambling through pre-rock country, bluegrass, rockabilly, and Western swing. The Lone Star angle is essential in differentiating the band from the crowd of Appalachia-descended string bands who have sprung up in the Gourds' wake; the Hackensaw Boys, the Avett Brothers, and Chatham County Line play many of the same instruments, but toward regionally and musically different ends. The Gourds draw from the same well as Doug Sahm, Willie Nelson, and Johnny Bush, which makes them part bar-band rockers and part ensemble pickers. In their live shows, they dig their spurs into a song and open up its possibilities, whether it's a spirited original or an unlikely cover. Their stage presence is the key to their longevity, but their studio albums have become increasingly adventurous, with 2007's Noble Creatures and now Haymaker! gradually closing the gap between their recorded material and their performances. The non-punctuation part of that album title refers to a knockout punch that floors your opponent. That might be overselling the album, but a dependable swing isn't far off. Haymaker! is a typically witty, rambunctious album that shuffles up the band members like a deck of cards. Three of the five Gourds sing lead, which gives each song a distinct personality without making it sound like a different band. Kevin ""Shinyribs"" Russell, besides having a great nickname, has perhaps the most recognizable voice here, lending a down-home quality to ""Country Love"" and ""The Way You Can Get"". Jimmy Smith sounds like Springsteen sitting in with the Sir Douglas Quintet on ""New Dues"" and ""Thurman"", although he can't redeem the awkward hook of ""Luddite Juice"". That leaves Max Johnston singing the modestly mournful ""Valentine"" and the closer ""Tighter"" and sounding about 20 or 30 years older than he actually is. If Noble Creatures made the Gourds sound like yokel Burroughses, writing lyrics so nonlinear they sounded like cut-ups, Haymaker! creates a more lucid slang that emphasizes backporch wordplay on the otherwise pedestrian rocker ""Country Gal"" and nearly anthropological details on the trucker anthem ""Shreveport"". ""Wake up! We're going to the country,"" Shinyribs sings on the energetic opener ""Country Love"", which ushers you into the Gourds' rural realm, where watching the stars together counts as a date and where a hook in the chorus is just as good as a hook in a fish. In fact, Haymaker! has a travelogue feel, which is perhaps inevitable for a hard-touring band. These songs traipse across northern Louisiana (""Shreveport"") to the Texas plains (""All the Way to Jericho"", namesake of the notoriously muddy Jericho Gap on Route 66) and points west (""Tex-Mex Mile""). They stop to pick up an idealistic hitchhiker in a tight Che t-shirt on the stand-out ""Bridgett"", on which Smith balances grinning wit and searing regret over Claude Bernard's rangey accordion. ""I bid adios to my camouflage rider,"" he sings wistfully. ""She said, 'Thanks for the lift, you old geezer.'"" That punchilne has some real sting to it, more potent for being so unexpected and more barbed for bursting his expectations. The Gourds' trip just gets longer and stranger.","The exclamation point in the title of the Gourds' latest album doesn't lie: The Austin-based band plays an emphatic, exclamatory amalgam of Americana styles, ambling through pre-rock country, bluegrass, rockabilly, and Texas swing.

We Ate the Machine,Polysics,by: Mike Orme,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a017c0084474cd0bfaa2/1:1/w_160/be19bf7b.jpg,2009-01-16 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12568-we-ate-the-machine/,MySpace,"While the Japanese underground remains a rock'n'roll Valhalla for hardy sonic adventurers from the West, Tokyo's Polysics seem stuck in some sort of purgatory. They're still pigeonholed in the same scene that lumps together artists as diverse as Boredoms and Guitar Wolf, yet no cottage industry of $30 imports or rock'n'roll zombie flicks buoys the Polysics like it does their contemporaries. Polysics always seems just there, recipients of piles of rote praise but forgotten mere months after each record's release. We Ate the Machine continues the band's run of solid releases but further paints them into a corner: Their frenetic synth-punk delights in defying conventional wisdom, but the noise junkies who might appreciate the group's risk-taking might also find it difficult to take seriously their pop-punk bubblegum dalliances. Similar problems dogged the Polysics' idols, Devo. Like their Japanese acolytes, the Akron crazies played to a sort of high-minded dysfunction, but the lasting image evoked by their sermon of de-evolution remains that of distant relatives dancing to ""Whip It"" at wedding receptions. So, as the looming beast of the 1980s threatened to leave Devo the eminently embarrassing duality of underground-sensation-slash-one-hit-wonder, they retreated further into the surreal technological fantasy of synthesizers. Polysics acknowledge their quirky identity in a similar fashion. In an act of Daft Punkian one-upmanship, the group named their record We Ate the Machine as a reaction to the common practice of claiming keyboards and laptops as members of a band. You can imagine an interview with Polysics going something like this: ""Would you say you have you integrated electronic machinery into your sound?"" ""'Integrate' the machine? We fucking ATE the machine!"" Despite their machine-based diet, it seems Polysics have subsisted recently on a diet of heavy guitars. Their first proper full-length for MySpace Records sounds a little like what you might imagine a Polysics record would sound like on a MySpace record label: alien synthesizers running on rocket fuel and playing pinball with screamed hooks, but buttressed with the subtle backbone of hard rock and hardcore. The heaviness of the opening triptych, ""Moog Is Love"" to ""Pretty Good"" to ""Rocket"", for example, owes less to napalm synthesizer freakouts than it does to dinosaur rock riffs. Older records like Neu! seemed concerned with stretching audacious drumbeats to their twitchy limits, the songs orbiting their own riffage but never allowing listeners to get too comfortable. Where once each musical idea, each guitar riff, each dissonant keyboard mash-and-grab segued into another wild and exciting experiment, Machine nudges ever further down the path of controlled chaos. As the record wears on, it returns to the major-key anime punk of previous records with head-bashing drum fills and four-alarm keyboards, but also tarries into further explorations like a mid-tempo disco-rock arpeggio on ""Colored Lizard"". Of course, it's arguable that the relative predictability of Machine negates the band's charming destructive glee. But a group that revels in first sounding like Devo, then like Brainiac, then like guitar-effects wiz Agata from Melt-Banana, and then like the theme to ""Naruto"" might not deserve the criticism of diminishing individuality. Machine provides yet another close reading on the broad strokes Polysics paint out of their palette of pleasing (or, perhaps, displeasing) colors; the resulting kaleidoscope feels more like a collage. Like Devo before them, the band once again comes off as studied and happy maniacs: the straight-A art school kids who grow up and teach at conservatories as opposed to the slackers who drop out and form the Velvet Underground. This perception makes it hard for Polysics to sell their anarchist shtick in the company of the dour, workmanlike aesthetes who supposedly constitute their peer group. The good thing is, Polysics don't actually have any peers-- they ate them.","Japan's Polysics traffic in Devo-inspired synth-punk always on the edge of chaos, and their latest places a greater emphasis on guitars and rock heaviness.

We Mean Business,EPMD,by: Ian Cohen,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a0319d034d5c69bf2662/1:1/w_160/c78fb26c.jpg,2009-01-16 06:00:01,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12591-we-mean-business/,EP,"Where were you in '92? A lot of us were cultivating a longstanding relationship with Ed Lover and Dr. Dre (Who's the Man Dre, not The Wash Dre) and maybe have spent at least a half hour of the past decade wondering how K-Solo and/or Keith Murray keeps busy these days. As long as EPMD can draw breath, they'll likely be welcome on any number of nostalgia tours, but if We Mean Business is the first you've heard of the Long Island duo's latest iteration of grown-man business, you've got company-- the record didn't even land inside the Billboard 200. Still, We Mean Business is a surprisingly enjoyable reminder of the potency of a group often overshadowed by their more name-dropped contemporaries. Needless to say, subject matter mostly boils down to EPMD being living legends and these young rapsters need to show them some goddamn respect. And really, We Mean Business' greatest achievement is how it manages to do such without Erick Sermon and Parrish Smith sounding bitter or out of touch-- pretty much impossible since the record is constructed as a self-contained 1990s simulacrum. Despite the presence of 9th Wonder (who could probably learn a thing from Erick Sermon about how to make a snare knock), these are the same sorts of beats you'd hear on a pre-millennium Def Squad project, right down to what feels like the 12th song they've done called ""Roc-Da-Spot"" (down to the same sample of Biggie's ""Unbelievable""). Usually, when beats are called ""round,"" it's on some edgeless backpacker shit, but Sermon knows how to play the back without turning into wallpaper, still spitting out tracks resembling Super Balls, dense, rubbery and altogether fun. The guests regularly outshine the hosts, but each has a variation on the sort of rugged, gruff flow that doesn't leave Erick or Parrish gasping. Redman shows to clown up ""Yo"", Raekwon and Method Man are still in great form on their respective drops, and Keith Murray answers the question raised earlier by indicating he's spent years trying to make sure ""wanksta"" and ""a homo shanked ya"" rhyme just right. Even the one notable contemporary feature comes from Skyzoo, the kind of guy who so far has made inroads only with the most virulent ""bring New York back"" crowd. Not much has changed about the group dynamic either-- while Parrish has the more technically impressive flow, E somehow gets the memorable lines, although it works in both ways. It's like his lisp has actually progressed with age (he boasts that he's the reason kids slow flow these days), but it can result in fully intelligible groaners like ""don't get me mad and make me Barack O-bomb-ya."" But whatever the two are going on about, for better or worse, it's as impenetrable as Company Flow for just about anyone under the age of 25: EPMD namedrops, amongst others, Dominique Dawes, W.C., Andre Rison, Kung-Fu Hustle, Mekhi Phifer, and then revives the stick-up kid catchphrase ""run your jewels"" as a hook with a typically cantankerous KRS-One. Obviously, with such a low-risk, modest-reward format and almost non-existent commercial prospects, EPMD really had no chance of creating something that could knock Strictly Business out the box-- in large part because something like ""Yo"" will never get a video treatment in the manner ""Headbanger"" or ""Crossover"" did. Still, We Mean Business actually bears more in common with recent mixtape-style releases like Prodigy's Return of the Mac or Clipse's Road to Til the Casket Drops without reaching the musical heights of the former or the lyrical heights of the latter-- the breakdown of the usual promotion cycle to acknowledge the increasingly niche-targeted appeal of non-superstar rappers. I can't imagine EPMD meant for this to go beyond an already established fanbase of intensely dedicated listeners, but then again, ""the customer's always right""... well, that's just good business sense.","Fresh off the nostalgia circuit, EPMD return with a surprisingly enjoyable reminder of the potency of a group often overshadowed by their more name-dropped contemporaries.

Live from Las Vegas at the Palms,My Morning Jacket,by: Joshua Klein,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a03e5e6ef9596931fed6/1:1/w_160/c58296fc.jpg,2009-01-16 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12601-live-from-las-vegas-at-the-palms/,iTunes,"Just 10 years ago, My Morning Jacket were recording in abandoned grain silos, releasing albums on the tiny indie Darla, and otherwise living the life of any other unknown band. The difference was that My Morning Jacket were actually pretty great, and like the best-kept secrets it wasn't long before more people discovered the group. Fast forward a decade and My Morning Jacket draw spillover crowds at Bonnaroo, celebrate themselves with live albums and concert films, headline a New Year's Eve show at Madison Square Garden, and enjoy life at the top supported by one of rock's most dedicated fan bases. It's all left the group with little to prove beyond its own further longevity. Yet if their iffy 2008 album Evil Urges demonstrated anything, it's that, successful or not, Jim James and crew remain as restless as ever, and would rather do the wrong thing once in a while than do the right thing all the time-- especially if the right (read: predictable) thing threatens to turn to tedium. One result is that lame funk detours and other stylistic no-nos are now part of the band's permanent record, but hey, you win some and you lose some. Regardless, My Morning Jacket's live reputation remains undiminished. But Live From Las Vegas at the Palms isn't another stage-bound victory lap in the mold of the epic Okonokos. Instead, it's an iTunes-exclusive stopgap (or, more generously, a gift to fans) by way of the state of the art studio housed in the Palms casino in Vegas. That means there's a) No distracting crowd noise, and b) Pristine sound, two things one rarely (if ever) expects from a live release. Whether those niggling details nullify the EP's ""live"" status is another matter; it's also largely irrelevant since what is here is a pleasant if decidedly low-key and minor session of mostly old material capturing the quieter-- and quiet storm-- side of the band. The set leads with an infrequently performed early MMJ rarity, The Tennessee Fire-era ""Tonight I Want to Celebrate With You"", anchored by a reliably endearing Omnichord and a touch of spooky pedal steel before the rest of the band appears and (softly) fills in the empty spaces. The fine ""Dear Wife"", the only new song, would probably have fit comfortably on any of the band's last couple of records, but here it suits the almost cocktail lounge vibe of much of this EP. In this vein and in this context, ""Knot Comes Loose"", now replete with an instrumental outro, bests its not dissimilar counterpart on Z. It's looser and even lovelier. From there the EP goes further back once again, to two more Tennessee Fire gems, ""From Nashville to Kentucky"" and ""They Ran"", each given essentially fresh studio makeovers, a little polish to get the decade-old DIY rust off. The former gains drums and a sax solo (!); the latter 1950s-styled harmonies that recall what Big Star was up to circa its ethereal masterpiece Third/Sister Lovers. By the time ""Thank You Too"" fades, it's clear James has made good on his promise ""to provide the listener with a sensual and deeply personal method for relaxational listening...to be enjoyed on a candle-lit bench, a secluded nook, or a sensuous dinner party."" Well, partly. After the indulgences of Evil Urges, this is just the kind of palette cleanser both fans and fencesitters might appreciate. Yet each of these pretty trips down memory lane make you wish there were more where they came from. At a hair over 20 minutes, Las Vegas at the Palms fulfills the requirements of an EP-- it's short and sweet-- but it's also not entirely filling. If it was a sensuous dinner party James had in mind, then he must be a quick eater.","For anyone turned off by the band's recent experiments, My Morning Jacket offer a short but sweet reminder of why so many people love them in the first place.

Fun DMC,People Under the Stairs,by: Roque Strew,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a013ea9e61561daa44ab/1:1/w_160/8a1e25fe.jpg,2009-01-15 06:00:05,Jazz,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12565-fun-dmc/,Gold Dust Media,"Thes One and Double K, the Los Angeleans that make up People Under the Stairs, represent the traditionalist wing of underground hip-hop. Ambassadors of the Four Elements, the duo takes a luddite attitude toward both the ringtone-ready aesthetic of Southern rap and the nervous textures of the Anticon crowd: They are dyed-in-the-wool crate diggers, mavens of the analog who know how to grip mikes and govern crowds and work the stylus. Over the course of five albums and numerous live shows, P.U.T.S. have come to embody the carefree, community-driven dream of early hip-hop, chiefly by dropping macho self-seriousness for a Saturday-afternoon ease and brightness of mood. (It's tempting to connect this attitude to their move, before their debut album, from Los Angeles to the cushier San Francisco.) Glazed with funk and jazz samples, their smartly sunlit throwback sound allied them with like-minded acts such as Pharcyde and tour partners De La Soul. On their latest record, Fun DMC, P.U.T.S. happily exalt the mundane, turning the everyday material of urban existence into tunes suggesting that life ought to be lived as an eternal weekend. ""We wanted to get the ambience of the dudes playing dominoes, the meat sizzling on the grill, the planes flying by,"" claim the duo on their website. ""We just said, 'Let's try to get what our Saturday is like onto a record. Instead of making a record about Saturday, let's actually go out and record Saturday.'"" In a marketplace that still puts a premium on rap sheets-- gangster chic's self-fulfilling prophecy-- it poses a commercial risk merely to chronicle your neighborhood get-togethers. Nevertheless, instead of detailing the tragedy of their rough-and-tumble upbringing, the rappers show us how they skipped past it. ""Gamin' on Ya"" describes one charmingly dorky route out of the tough L.A. life, as the duo reminisces about their high-school quest to get high scores, not to get high. Video games aptly grace both the foreground and the back, which feels glued together from arcade-game found sounds and Nintendo 8-bit blips. We find another nonviolent ritual in ""Anotha' (BBQ)""-- the joy of the cookout, itemized over handclaps and a loop of sighing disco guitars. The importance of friends (""D"") and family (""A Baby"", ""Suite for Peter Pt. 2"") wins out on this record, and an appropriately soothing ambience, free of bravado and menace and anomie, sweeps over the whole tracklist. Feel-good beats for feel-good reflections. Any MC worth his kicks has to publicly feel good about his hometown, too. Hence ""California"", a sequel in spirit to Dr. Dre and Tupac's ""California Love"", which lives on here through the revival of its West Coast poplockin', famously vocoded Roger Troutman chorus. (Listen for a Pharcyde sample, too, among dozens of others.) P.U.T.S. love their state too much to watch it crumple in the face of vials and handguns. They don't ask for much. In ""Anotha' (BBQ)"" the rapper is simply glad he has never been shot. The theme of needless bloodshed recurs in ""D"", a heartfelt eulogy to a friend lost to the bullet, and in ""Critical Condition"", which expresses sadness about the absurdity-- and stubborn persistence-- of inner-city warfare. The duo sees this all as a kind of slow-motion suicide. Behind all the summery sounds and sentiments, Fun DMC is not just a lament, but an argument. It is a battle of logic that California hip-hop has been conducting with itself, one that has been more philosophically central to rap than any other genres: Do you represent the hard truth of the street code or do you represent its rejection? This record chooses life. It chooses video games and comic books (if you buy the CD) and barbecues and family, growing up without getting old. To be sure, in terms of sound and production style, since 2006's Stepfather, P.U.T.S. have been returning to their roots: the smoky funk grooves, the boom-bap delivery, the patchwork of samples. But they also confront deeper matters, and sleekly weave them into their classic good-vibe atmosphere, offering listeners a new level of profundity, energy, and intricacy without surrendering the sheer pleasure they expect from a People Under the Stairs record.","On their latest record, Fun DMC, P.U.T.S. happily exalt the mundane, turning the everyday material of urban existence into tunes suggesting that life ought to be lived as an eternal weekend.

A Town Called Addis,Dub Colossus,by: Joshua Klein,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a02713d19756521382f3/1:1/w_160/8ff71a0f.jpg,2009-01-15 06:00:04,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12582-a-town-called-addis/,Realworld,"The unlikely relationship between Jamaica and Ethiopia is nonetheless both obvious and unavoidable. Haile Selassie, former Emperor of Ethiopia, is of course the figurehead of Rastafarianism, and Ethiopia the religion's fabled Zion. The symbolic red, green, and gold colors of the Ethiopian flag pervade Jamaican iconography, while Jamaican folk hero, activist, and reggae mainstay Marcus Garvey advocated a return to Africa. And of course the two nations will be linked forever through reggae, still the musical lingua franca across much of the globe but especially throughout Africa. Yet while reggae is steeped in African and specifically Ethiopian imagery, with the Ethiopian Amharic dialect even cropping up in several classic songs, the number of prominent collisions and collaborations of Ethiopian and Jamaican musicians remains rather limited. You'd think someone would have thought to fuse Ethiopia's rich musical heritage with reggae by now, but apparently reggae's long-distance love of Zion has been enough. British producer and Transglobal Underground vet Nick Page, aka Dub Colossus, got the ball bouncing with A Town Called Addis, an intriguing conflation of reggae and dub sensibilities with Ethiopian pop. It's an ingenious idea made more interesting by its roundabout mode of composition. First, Page traveled to Addis Ababa, where he began work on the album in a hut, the sessions frequently interrupted by children playing, dogs barking and the like. Next, Page took the tapes back to England, inviting a handful of Ethiopian players along with him to put the finishing touches on the disc. It's the second factor that makes A Town Called Addis so appealing. On top of Page's various riddims are a host of imported X-factors, from Ethiopian singer Sintayehu ""Mimi"" Zenebe to Teremag Weretow, who plays a one-stringed fiddle known as a messenqo. With the sessions rounded out by a handful of other Ethiopian musicians of varied backgrounds and prominence, from prestigious saxophonists to relatively unknown pianists, the project all but completes itself. A + B = C. Granted, that undersells Page's dub instincts, and in fact A Town Called Addis would have been perfectly listenable free from its Ethiopian components. Yet the more ear-catching elements of ""Entoto Dub"", such as its jazz-infused horns or exotic plucked strings, would have been sorely missed, as would have been the impassioned vocals enlivening the spacey ""Tazeb Kush"" or the smartly interwoven performances that bring ""Yeka Sub City Rockers"", ""Tizita Dub"", the wobbly and woozy ""Sima Edy"" and ""Ophir Dub"" into vibrant 3-D. The thrilling horns and piano on ""Mercato Music"" alone even overshadow the otherwise overwhelming dub factor (by design-- it's a Dub Colossus disc, not a Ethiopiques comp). It's the kind of culture clash that used to sneak out of dub-crazy Brit Adrian Sherwood's studio all the time back when that producer was working at his prolific peak, rich and exciting without ever feeling like a bland busman's holiday. From Jamaica to England to Ethiopia and back, you can hear the give and take between the different cultures, united through music and a desire to create something new out of traditions so old.","Nick Page, aka Dub Colossus, traveled to Ethiopia and back to bridge reggae music with its spiritual homeland.

Titan: It's All Pop!,Various Artists,by: Joe Tangari,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a0145e6ef9596931fe8d/1:1/w_160/16f1c48e.jpg,2009-01-15 06:00:03,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12566-titan-its-all-pop/,Numero Group,"Kansas City is widely known as one of the great incubators of jazz and blues. People who associate it with music at all are likely to think first of Count Basie or the American Jazz Museum and of course the immortal R&B standard ""Kansas City"". But the city's musical history naturally extends well beyond that. As this 2xCD retrospective of the power pop label Titan illustrates, it even has a few lost chapters. There were garage bands and surf groups all over the Midwest in the 1960s and early 70s, and while most didn't last very long, their members often kept plugging away with new projects. Eventually, they left fertile ground to nurture a raft of punk and power pop bands, most of which were just as unsuccessful as their garage-bound predecessors. If you're going to be unsuccessful, though, you might as well be spectacularly unsuccessful. The Titan label's first transaction was to bounce a check, and things didn't get a whole lot better after that. Tom Sorrells and Mark Prellberg were music nuts who originally planned to start a Who Put the Bomp-style zine to focus on the stories of forgotten-in-their-own-time garage bands of the Great Plains and underecognized current acts, but an introduction to Gary Charlson changed that. After having ""Real Life Saver"" sung to him over the phone, Prellberg made the executive decision to divert the zine's start-up funds to recording the song and another Charlson composition and press it up on 45, complete with a sweet picture sleeve featuring an unauthorized image of a Wintergreen Life Saver. There was no need to worry about getting into legal trouble for trademark infringement, though, because neither Prellberg nor Sorrells had any connections, and the single barely cleared a few mile radius around Kansas City on its release. Not for lack of quality, though-- ""Real Life Saver"" is a genuine power pop treat. Charlson's great doubled falsetto is ably abetted by a sharp arrangement and good drumming. Charlson has seven tracks on this comp, and he was a great tunesmith, not to mention a good interpreter. His version of the obscure Dwight Twilley gem ""Shark"" is a fantastic rock'n'roll raver. Charlson recorded a live album of covers for Titan, a record that languished too long and sent him off to Bomp! To get it released. Titan responded by rush-releasing it first, destroying the label's relationship with its founding act. I have to call Charlson the founding act and not the first signing because Titan didn't do contracts. It was a business with no business plan or budget, a series of un-recouped investments made on the basis of handshakes. They lost perhaps their best band, the Secrets* (the meaning of the asterisk is apparently secret), in a similar situation when they adopted new management and left to seek a major label deal, taking some Titan-funded recordings with them. The Secrets* are responsible for several of this set's highlights. The ebulliently bitter girl-destroys-boy stomper ""It's Your Heart Tonight"" would've fit great on the radio next to Cheap Trick, if anyone had ever played it on the radio, while ""Radio Heart"" starts with a melodic bass solo, then delivers a mission statement of sorts with its opening line: ""I just wanna blast out your favorite tunes."" Sorrells and Prellberg looked outside of K.C. for talent as well, recording but not releasing a single by Lawrence, Kan., band Millionaire at Midnight, and reaching up into Lincoln, Neb., to pluck the city's resident Anglophiles the Boys. The Boys were the highest-profile act ever to give Titan the time of day, having opened stadiums for Blue Öyster Cult, ZZ Top, and REO Speedwagon. They had everything going for them except timing-- the kinds of wonderfully snaking melodies and big vocal harmonies they pedaled may have gotten them somewhere in the 60s or even the halcyon days of indie pop a decade later, but in 1979 they fell on deaf ears, This despite the fact that their cheekily titled ""(Baby) It's You"", which is not a Bacharach/David cover, was Titan's best seller by far. I was skeptical when I first started listening that this set truly merited two discs, but I was pleasantly surprised to get through both of them wanting more. The discs aren't numbered, but are simply labeled ""Fave Side"" and ""Rave Side,"" and both are stuffed with faves and raves alike. The Numero guys included a bunch of worthy unreleased material from the label's 1978-1981 run, such as ""The Water"", by Bobby Sky, whose time in L.A. with Kim Fowley is evident in the Beach Boys-ish vocal melody, bright piano interjections, and layered chorus harmonies. Scott McCarl's ""I Think About You"" popped up on a CD released by Sorrells in the mid 90s, but it dates from 1981, and it's an outstanding slice of bounding indie pop that deserved inclusion. Titan ultimately deserves the resurrection it gets here. Limited resources and even more limited business acumen may have prevented the imprint from ever snatching its pie out of the sky, but Sorrells and Prellberg were fans before they were ever label men, and you can tell they picked these bands to record because they loved the music. The recordings are professional, and the musicianship is mostly outstanding-- see Charlson's dual lead on ""Brown Eyes"" or the weird but effective drumming on J.P. McClain & the Intruders' ""Just Another Pop Song"" for examples. But beyond that, good guitar pop is good guitar pop, and most of these tunes are easy to connect with 30 years after the fact.","The Numero Group unearths forgotten turn-of-the-1980s power pop and new wave from the tiny Kansas City label Titan.

Nodzzz,Nodzzz,by: Joe Colly,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a03813d197565213832a/1:1/w_160/c65e123c.jpg,2009-01-15 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12598-nodzzz/,What's Your Rupture?,"Noise-pop acts-- many of whom favor iteration to innovation-- had a great 2008. But with the ink still drying on last year's best-of lists, the recurrent genre's bright stars (Vivian Girls, Times New Viking, Crystal Stilts, Women) are already under attack, facing censure from both the anti-derivative, pro-virtuosity sects of the blogosphere and the types of ”fans” who hop trends every six months just to be the first to board and then jump a ship. Nodzzz, a smart aleck-y three-piece from San Francisco who share a few stylistic traits with more well-known noise-pop bands, will inevitably be lumped in with them and face similar (and probably misguided) backlash-driven criticism. Despite a penchant for brevity (Nodzzz's 10 songs clock in at under 16 minutes), a lo-fi aesthetic, and a tendency to brush their guitars and vocals with a light wash of fuzz, Nodzzz actually don't sound much like their contemporaries. Where other groups look to Nuggets and Back From the Grave for inspiration, these guys draw upon Stiff Records, pub rock, and the earliest British new wave of the 1970s-- Nick Lowe and Elvis Costello are accurate reference points. They also stir in an element of surfer-dude recklessness by means of their distinctive West Coast cadence. (Singer Anthony Atlas' vowel sounds are at times reminiscent of the Dead Milkmen goofing their way through ""Bitchin' Camaro"".) All of this-- plus, yeah, the signature jangle of their peers-- can be heard in the acoustic strums and ramshackle rhythms of opener ""Is She There"", which sets the record's low-rent, cold-beers-in-the-hot-sun vibe. That spirit is another reason to not cast Nodzzz off as late-to-the-party scenesters: Like the Feelies or Modern Lovers before them, the group wears its quirkiness as a kind of badge of honor; it informs both its music and how they present it. On punchy, effortlessly catchy tracks such as ""I Can't Wait"" and ""Controlled Karaoke"", Nodzzz strike a tone of brazen, almost nerdy fun that's diametrically opposed to Crystal Stilts' poker-faced cool. But for all of the backyard partying, there's a sense here of impending severity. Sure, the band is living in a state of postponed adolescence, but they're also keenly aware of what's breathing down their necks. Much of the lyrical content of Nodzzz addresses this predicament-- the urgency of youth giving way to the inevitability of adulthood-- and the group commendably manages a lot with a little. (Remember, these songs rarely stretch past the two-minute mark.) Openly sarcastic on ""Simple Song"", Nodzzz caution youngsters (and maybe themselves) against believing too much in their punk dreams. ""A time is gonna come when you're not young/ Hope you give up on that simple song/ Forget the words, be a mom,"" they advise. They get even more meditative on ""Highway Memorial Shrine"", pensively wondering how they'll ever ""go to San Francisco"" or ""get to a place [they] don't know."" Hmm...where do you go? Who do you need to know? Sound familiar? Yeah, it's the same set of brink-of-adulthood worries Morrissey posed in ""The Boy With the Thorn in His Side"" years ago. For a kid stepping into two-war, economic-collapse America, those questions are as pertinent (and unanswerable) now as they were then, and consciously or not, Nodzzz cleverly posit them here in stupid-simple terms to a new generation of misfits. That's a pretty slick move for a group supposedly riding the coattails of a trend bloggers claim is on its way out.","Despite a distinctly lo-fi aesthetic, Nodzzz sound less like noise-pop contemporaries such as Vivian Girls or Crystal Stilts and more like 70s pub-rock or Modern Lovers.

Glasvegas,Glasvegas,by: Scott Plagenhoef,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a037b1335d7bf1697f8b/1:1/w_160/5c091f83.jpg,2009-01-15 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12597-glasvegas/,ColumbiaColumbia,"Last year, the NME placed Vampire Weekend on its cover and declared that we were living in a time of renewed greatness in American music. Not long after, a blogger at The Guardian made essentially the same claim. Weirdly, the conventional wisdom for those of us on this side of the Atlantic was just the opposite, the line being that 2008 was a relatively ho-hum time for American indie rock. My suggestion for UK indie: It's not us, it's you. In the past few years, it's too few art school bands, too few mavericks, and too few iconoclasts; it's far too many groups that amount to a haircut, a worn copy of Is This It?, and a provincial accent. Above all, it's far too many bands that confuse ambition with chart placements instead of creativity. When Glasvegas first appeared a few years ago, they were trumpeted as an antidote to those problems and to bands like the Pigeon Detectives, the Enemy, and the View (don't worry-- you're not missing anything). They were a new template and a new set of influences (girl-group, JAMC and most any other band Alan McGee signed in the 1980s, Suicide, rockabilly). In short, a new hope. Their 2007 ""Daddy's Gone"" / ""Flowers & Football Tops"" single quite rightly got plenty of people excited: Guitar pop with balanced levels of breadth and depth, hooks to spare, singer James Allan's thick Scottish brogue, and even lyrics that are ""about something"" (absent father and early death, respectively). Cue fanfare. And then, like so many other post-Oasis bands, Glasvegas somehow became swept into UK guitar-rock's ""go big or go home"" mentality; they hooked up with Muse and Mars Volta producer Rich Costey and have turned out an album that's more Kasabian than vintage Creation. ""Flowers"" and ""Daddy's"" survived: The former kicks off the record and is still the band's best song to date, although now it takes almost 90 seconds to get going before it inexplicably closes with 90 seconds of ""You Are My Sunshine"". The bloat can't touch the awfully great four minutes in between but it's a worrying metaphor for the rest of the album: Perhaps the band was unsatisfied with or unconfident in what it had, perhaps it is equating scopes and importance with droney add-ons or non sequiturs but ""Flowers"" served as a glorious epitaph on its own without the grabs at additional heft. Another early song, former rockabilly-nicking ""I'm Gonna Get Stabbed"", has been renamed ""Stabbed"" and is now dominated by the melody to Beethoven's ""Moonlight Sonata"". Most likely a reference to the Shangri-Las' awesome and heart-wrenching sexual abuse story ""Past, Present, and Future"", the addition of the classical piece here is awkward and cringe-worthy. And the record sort of goes on like that: It's a frustrating listen, with almost every track containing both a hint of something awesome alongside a clunky distraction. (To be fair, fans of brash arena rock will likely overlook the missteps and find a lot to love here.) ""Daddy's Gone"" survives mostly intact, a tantalizing reminder that the pre-release huzzahs heaped upon Glasvegas were not just well-intended but well-founded. Should-be single ""Polmont on My Mind"" and welcome musical switch-up ""Ice Cream Van"" are worthy additions to the band's catalog. Newer singles ""Geraldine"" and ""It's My Own Cheating Heart That Makes Me Cry"" come close to matching ""Daddy's"", but are again weighed down by their own ambitions and clumsy lyrics-- particularly the latter which actually includes the lines ""liar, liar, pants on fire."" No, really: That's the future of UK guitar rock. Here in America, we spent a lot of 2008, and now early 2009, celebrating a noise-pop underground that, in places, takes weak pop songs and slathers them with fuzz and reverb under the pretense of art. In this environment, it's great to see a band like Glasvegas go for it, take their own noise-pop impulses and shoot for the rafters. And yet, not only do they do it on almost every song, in almost the exact same way, but they seem to do just the opposite of the American brethren-- start with the fuzz and reverb, with quality noise-pop, then tack on layer after layer of gloss until their songs are transformed into modern rock. In their rush to be the UK's most important band, they seem to have ignored restraint, charisma, and charm-- the qualities that made them Next Big Thing candidates in the first place.","Heavily touted in the UK press after an excellent single for their combination of girl-group pop structures, wall of sound production, and Jesus and Mary Chain-style guitar buzz, Scotland's Glasvegas hook up with Muse and Mars Volta producer Rich Costey for their full-length debut.

Olly Oxen Free,Mason Proper,by: Joshua Klein,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/59299fe9b1335d7bf1697ed6/1:1/w_160/37ee6a68.jpg,2009-01-14 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12530-olly-oxen-free/,Dovecote,"""Safe for the Time Being"", the last song on Mason Proper's second album, Olly Oxen Free, begins slightly out of focus-- not jarringly so, but just bleary and blurry enough to catch your attention as your ears try to orient themselves. A synth wobbles. A bass drum rumbles. A voice (or sample of a voice) warbles along. A reverb-drenched guitar arpeggio vies with a fuzzy bass to give the track direction, which singer Jonathan Visger refuses to provide with his yelpy and uneasy vocal melody. ""Fog"", the first song on the album, is stately and more subdued, less amorphous. The drums plod at an uncommitted trot, the guitars occasionally lock into something more forceful. The elusive vocals and airy keyboards meet somewhere in the ether, mysterious and majestic yet modest all the same. These tracks are striking and spooky bookends to a disc that swings both ways. One moment it plays it safe with the relatively straight indie rock of ""Point A to Point B"" or the fitfully funky ""Only a Moment"", and then it becomes loose and abstract on ""In the Mirror"" or the consciously unbalanced ""Downpour"" (sort of indie-rock screwed and chopped). Surely the all-encompassing shadow of Radiohead falls on this record, but it's equally reminiscent of the hazy art-rock of TV on the Radio (with whom ""Olly Oxen Free"" shares producer/engineer Chris Coady). Certainly a track like ""Alone"" makes the band sound like it's dined a few times at the Cookie Mountain Buffet. Of course, the Ypsilanti, Mich., group isn't a match for those aforementioned acts, at least not yet, but they do demonstrate a similar ability to make weirdness seem normal, and normal seem weird. Witness ""In the Mirror"", which begins mournful but slowly evolves into something uneasier, or ""Out Dragging the River"", a simple slow-jam that gradually but only very subtly ups the energy of the skeletal arrangement, like clouds gently parting to reveal the sun peeking out. Compared to songs such as these, the propulsive ""Shiny"" and the angular ""Only a Moment"" at first seem conspicuously conventional, but even these tracks go some strange places that save them from a more mundane fate. Yet one of the strengths of the disc is that its many eccentricities don't come off as cloying, look-at-me affectations. Rather, both band and album alike seem genuinely interested in keeping the sonic see-saw teetering, never fully touching ground at either end, preferring to straddle the constantly unsteady fulcrum in between.","Michigan band's second full-length, produced by TV on the Radio associate Chris Coady, swings from relatively straightforward indie rock to looser and more abstract moments that are hard to classify.

Jewels,Einstürzende Neubauten,by: Roque Strew,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a005ea9e61561daa4486/1:1/w_160/ca7875bb.jpeg,2009-01-14 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12552-jewels/,Potomak,"Over the past decade, there has been grumbling that Einstürzende Neubauten, the West Berlin pioneers of industrial noise, have gone soft. Their most passionate followers, after all, aren't known for their enthusiasm about effete things like melody and guitars. And that is understandable. This is a band that has ""cooked mud, transformed meat to percussion, and recorded 20,000-volt transformer stations,"" that has derived its iconoclastic reputation from its long refusal of modern music's comforts and institutions. Cleverly parting with the music-industrial complex, Jewels culls from the third phase of a Supporter Project, where fans funded the production of their previous record, Alles Wieder Offen, in return for a song a month. First, the band left things to chance, having each member pluck a card from a deck, à la Brian Eno's ""Oblique Strategies,"" to determine what their role in each song would be. Each card displayed a ""cryptic reference"" to some moment or passage or mood that appears in the Neubauten discography. Effectively, this ""subversive interpretation game"" narrowed the aesthetic range, ensuring a welcome continuity by rooting Jewels in past releases-- the liberties taken here might remind fans of Halber Mensch or the more recent, assaultive Musterhaus series of CDs. Most challenging, and arguably the most rewarding, are a jerky dive into water (""Mei Ro""), a sandwich of whispers and spaceship ambiance (""I Kissed Glenn Gould""), and a buzzsaw's conversation with a robot (""Vicki""). Newcomers may be happy to hear that eccentricity and harshness on that scale isn't sustained across Jewels. This is plain from the first track, ""Ich Komme Davon"". Hints of melody we found in Silence Is Sexy and Perpetuum Mobile abound here, too, on the opener and the sleekly electronic ""Ansonsten Dostojevsky"". Even the band's growing sensitivity to space and rhythm, last seen in Grundstück, the second installment in the Supporter Project, surfaces on the record's strongest track. At six and a half minutes, ""Die Ebenen werden nicht vermischt"" stands out as epically proportioned, a mash-up of Gregorioid chant and musique concrète that calls to mind an oil derrick toppling into a monastery. For a band that serves as an intermediary stop between trippy Krautrock outfits like Faust and Can on one hand, and bruising sonic nihilists like Test Dept. on the other, Neubauten has eluded pat labels. To be sure, they led the way with industrial music, effectively approaching Home Depot as Guitar Center, but their sound is obviously much more than power-tool improv, and far too varied to stay within one genre, as listeners discover here. Not every song on Jewels is a triumph. But each is a gift, literally, to devotees old and new. Not only a token of appreciation but a reminder that Einstürzende Neubauten's 28-year career leaps from Howitzer storms of noise to anxious, multiform expanses without sacrificing a whit of their questing, avant-garde intelligence.","Einstürzende Neubauten's latest culls from the third phase of a Supporter Project-- where fans funded the production of their previous record, Alles Wieder Offen, in return for a song a month-- and is steeped in the band's past work, with parts assembled from moments or passages or moods in the Neubauten discography.

Emeritus,Scarface,by: Ian Cohen,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/59299ff29d034d5c69bf25c8/1:1/w_160/60aa8c61.jpg,2009-01-14 06:00:02,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12537-emeritus/,Rap-A-Lot,"Seems like Scarface releases this kind of album every single year-- rarely less than great, overshadowed by more commercially promising records-- and then threatens to retire on it. Judging from the title of Emeritus, this time, he actually means business. But really, the main difference it has from its predecessors is that it could just as easily be titled Scarface Presents: Look Back in Anger. It's a record that settles scores, names names, and, after a career spent on exploring the moral complexity of the gangsta lifestyle, finally hands down something resembling judgment. Of course, it's presented within the framework of typical Scarface themes. Paid dues are acknowledged, realness is recognized, punks get dealt with accordingly, and the only thing he takes lying down is his next fuck. In fact, the first seven minutes of Emeritus are spent with almost petty focus, updating you on what Lil' Troy has been up to since ""Wanna Be a Baller""-- namely, talking to police and fucking up the money of Houston's realest. But the state of hip-hop is the least of Scarface's problems on Emeritus, as it's defined by an unrelentingly bleak outlook on just about everything. After Barack Obama's win in November, The Onion published an article entitled ""Black Man Given Nation's Worst Job"". The last verse on ""Can't Get Right"" becomes an extension of that, as Scarface explains that he didn't vote for Barack because he ""loves him."" Elsewhere, he sees so little worth living for in this world that, despite his deep religious beliefs, he'd rather his baby's mother have an abortion than to see another child suffer through a system that sets him up for for failure. ""We ain't first class citizens/ And we ain't second either."" Rap's coke kingpins have nothing on Pfizer and even the meanest block isn't as dangerous a place for a young black man as an army base. Even physical pleasures are mostly done away with. ""Who Are They"" works with the same ""everyone loves you when you're rich and famous"" concept as Mike Jones' ""Back Then"", but entirely guts it of innocent charm and instead becomes an ugly airing of grudges that have become positively poisonous over the span of decades. Along with K-Rino and Slim Thug, Scarface takes a nearly ascetic tone, seeing strip clubs and the old neighborhood as places to revel in the failures of others as much as reminders of their own success. As such, it makes the sex jam ""High Note"" something of a rare misstep. And yet, that Emeritus often seems more righteous than cynical or hopeless (the latter two are a bit soft) is a testament to Scarface strengthening his flow in age. He always sounded old before his time, but now, as he approaches 40, it's like his time has come. Mortality hangs heavy over Emeritus. Scarface laments ""Analyzing all the wrong I've done/ I'm surprised I ain't dead/ I guess the good die young"" while numbed by the frequency of funerals he's attending. As far as production, he rhymes over beats that might be a bit more lush and modern than Rap-A-Lot's known for (though the buzzing sawtooths of ""High Powered"" bring to mind Swizz Beatz' production on Noreaga's ""Nahmeanuheard""), but it's a good look this time out. Don't forget that Scarface was something of an honorary member of Roc-A-Fella's roster during the two-year bubble before and after The Blueprint. Emeritus is almost entirely bullshit free. No words wasted and outside a bit of we-the-best chest puffing with Lil Wayne (""call me by my new name... 'Featuring Lil' Wayne'"") and Bun B (""we keep it crunk like Obama in Invesco"") on the unrealistically titled ""Forgot About Me"". Nearly every track makes its point and moves forward, although there's plenty of seemingly redundant and occasionally trite code of the street moralizing. Still, if anyone deserves a victory lap, it's Scarface. And yet Emeritus is every bit in the right doing what feels like the complete opposite-- manifesting Bobby Knight's famous request that he be buried face down so all his detractors could kiss his ass.","Unrelentingly bleak and angry but not without its pop flourishes, the latest from the Houston MC solidifies his position as an elder statesman of hip-hop.

Fantasy Black Channel,Late of the Pier,by: Adam Moerder,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a009b1335d7bf1697f1f/1:1/w_160/674ea557.jpg,2009-01-14 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12555-fantasy-black-channel/,Parlophone,"Nu-rave may be over, but Late of the Pier make for a very compelling after-party band. Sharing the tech savoir-faire of bands like Metronomy, Apes & Androids, and Shitdisco, the English four-piece's debut Fantasy Black Channel strives to compress the 1980s into a dozen MP3s, unzipping hedonistic nostalgia for a generation of consumers entranced by the pop styles immediately preceding their birth. Obviously they're not alone in their exploitation of that decade, but with 2007 single ""Bathroom Gurgle"", a sprawling smorgasbord of 80s electro pop and soul, the band showed potential to actually deliver on the retro promise. Assigned to bottle this lightning, Erol Alkan does his usual shtick behind the boards, blasting everything into the red until it sounds like a sci-fi cartoon theme. Criticized for his de-humanizing touch on the Long Blondes' bleak ""Couples"", here Alkan's cyborg sensibilities feel more fitting. After all, this is hardly verse-chorus-verse Britpop or post-punk he's playing Frankenstein with-- LOTP thrive on labyrinthine song structures and stylistic misdirection, in case ""Gurgle"" didn't make that obvious enough already. In fact, the whole album plays out like an 80s medley curated by the Human League, Prince, and 1984-era Van Halen. After a minute-long opener, it's a free-for-all: David Bowie-inspired space operas like ""Broken"" or ""VW"" butt up against relatively conventional dancefloor favs like ""The Bears are Coming"" and ""Focker""; the only common elements between them are Alkan's piercing synths and frontman Samuel Eastgate's loose lyrical themes involving existential dread, hedonism, and a fixation on animals and nature. Unfortunately, some instances of supposed chaos feel rote, following the ""Gurgle"" blueprint a bit too closely and shoehorning an obligatory dance breakdown between disparate sections. Eastgate's lyrics, while delivered well, often aren't doing anyone any favors either, pining over techno-paranoia clichés or vague, half-hatched poetry. There are attempts at a more refined pop craft, like the twitchy XTC-inspired ""The Enemy Are the Future"", but even that track ultimately succumbs to a hi-hat outro, leaving the most memorable vocals hooks as the ones that are the least intelligible and human. Considering how this band's buzz originated from a quirky electro single in the vein of ""Happiness Is a Warm Gun"", Fantasy Black Channel's unevenness shouldn't be that surprising, but the flaws are troublesome. At its best moments, the debut sounds like an A.V. club president's wet dream, unabashedly nerdy and technically proficient. Sadly though, the record is peppered with aesthetically dubious nu-rave moments, making LOTP sound less like sympathetic revenging nerds and more like party-crazed dude-bros who just happen to own synths.","This Erol Alkan-produced UK band's debut LP strives to compress the electro-pop/indie-dance 80s into a dozen MP3s, providing an engaging twist on one of the decade's most familiar sounds.

Where Were U in 92?,Zomby,by: Nate Patrin,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/59299ff95e6ef9596931fe55/1:1/w_160/d18c8baa.jpg,2009-01-14 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12543-where-were-u-in-92/,Werk Discs,"Zomby is a wiseass. I don't mean that flippantly or pejoratively, but I just can't think of a more appropriate term. Here we have a producer who sealed his rep as a dubstep powerhouse with 2008's much-buzzed-about breakthrough single ""Mu5h/Spliff Dub (Rustie Remix)"", and then he goes and decides that the best way to build on that goodwill is with a full-length 'ardkore/jungle throwback album. Well played, sir, and bonus points for turning a half-rhetorical phrase from M.I.A.'s ""XR2"" into a giddy, time-warping answer: Where Were U in '92? isn't just a rib-nudging throwback, but an electronic dance music family tree's branch rendered in flashing neon. Despite his dubstep associations, Zomby is revealing himself to be a provocative genre-tweaker, someone who's never content to let an idea stagnate for more than a moment and shoots out in all directions-- historically and stylistically-- to keep things interesting. As one of those crucial producers who can trace his current musical lineage back through a youth consumed by garage, jungle, and rave, he's long since figured out how all the pieces fit together. This album's circa-1992 throwback elements are obvious but cleverly deployed: Bursts of ultra-pitched-up diva vocals provide hyperactive melody, only to be answered by rugged dancehall shouts; sirens and air-horns explode against densely-packed uptempo breakbeat rhythms; synthesized stabs and slashes blur the line between pianos and string sections. And while the album feels brief yet fully realized, its mood-swing structure and abrupt transitions-- the wobbly, dubbed-out gloom of ""Tears in the Rain"" jolted into the shiny 1 a.m. massiveness of ""Get Sorted"", or the rapid-fire ""Hench"" stepping into the subdued breakbeat of ""B With Me""-- evoke the kind of feverish real-time mutation that came from a low-tech, pre-internet yet fast-moving DIY movement. It all sounds a bit like a homemade mix cassette assembled from scraps and pieces by some teenager with a dual-deck tape recorder and more interest in pace-tweaking, blunt-trauma segues than seamlessly-crossfaded transitions. (Though you can't say he didn't warn you, what with the first track bearing the title ""Fuck Mixing, Let's Dance"".) Zomby's commitment to the era's style extends all the way to the equipment he used to record the album, using the studio techniques of the era and putting it all together on an AKAI S2000 and an old version of Cubase running on an Atari ST. So it's kind of jarring-- in a good way-- to hear a few more current-day notions run through it, like some of the robot vocals from ""Technologic"" downpitched and dragged across an archetypal breakbeat rhythm on ""Daft Punk Rave"", or the crunked-up ghettotech of ""Pillz"" making the UK hardcore/Southern bounce connection (and its shared interest in ecstasy) that much clearer. And there's never a sense that the music on here is strictly a backward glance; for every moment that sounds like it could've come from A Guy Called Gerald's 28 Gun Bad Boy or one of those great early jungle tracks that came out on Awesome Records or Moving Shadow back in the day, there's enough guttural bass and rhythmic elasticity to remind you of the garage and dubstep disciplines where breakbeat's successors eventually migrated to by the mid-late 00s. It only makes sense that this album closes out with ""U Are My Fantasy (Street Fighter II Theme Remix)"", which reworks Baby D's '92 rave anthem ""Let Me Be Your Fantasy"" with music and sound effects from the classic fighting game, since Super Street Fighter II Turbo was recently revived as an updated, modernized, super-glossy high-definition remake for next-gen home consoles. And just as the people who grew up throwing dragon punches in arcades found out that there's still a tight, fluid game under that shiny new surface, Zomby's proven that the fundamentals of a sound that peaked over 15 years ago can still be streamlined into the current zeitgeist. He's gotten to the point where he can invoke old signifiers as something more than you-had-to-be-there nostalgia: all at once, Where Were U in '92? is a history lesson, a depiction of a musical timeline that folds in on itself, and a revival that works because it approaches its subject with the idea that it simply evolved instead of died.","Zomby follows his buzzed-about dubstep singles with... a full-length 'ardkore throwback album. In the process he reveals himself as a provocative genre-tweaker able to nimbly move-- historically and stylistically-- throughout rave, garage, and jungle.

This music causes otherwise-mild, thirtysomething white men to abandon more practical pursuits in order to sing open-hearted songs of sexless yearning brimming with sha-la-las, handclaps, and chiming 12-string guitar. Robert Pollard-- schoolteacher turned indie rock star-- is the drunken patron saint of this set, and every year brings a new batch of hopefuls in the ""perfect three-minute Merseybeat-era pop tune"" sweepstakes, the Kinks, Hollies and Dave Clark Five records of their (or their father's) youth ringing in their ears. Keeping with the trend, all members of Army Navy were otherwise engaged when lead singer and songwriter Justin Kennedy, then working as a wardrobe stylist, assembled them. With the assistance of one disproportionately famous member-- Pete Thomas, former drummer for the Attractions (Doug Randall and Josh Zetumer also play here, and Randall is the band's current drummer)-- they have crafted a bubbly, effervescent valentine to obscure power pop bands of the late 1970s and early 80s. Their self-titled debut combines the perky bounce of the original bands with the beefed-up sonics of the 90s revivalists like the Posies and Teenage Fanclub, and the results are infectious enough to inspire a whole new batch of misbegotten hopefuls. Kennedy's songwriting references so many sources that trying to figure out exactly which three or four guitar bands he's channeling should provoke heated discussion. For a rock critic, tracking all the echoes quickly becomes madman's work: the soft bed of guitars that opens ""Saints"" is pure Teenage Fanclub, for instance, while Kennedy's bright, nasal tenor is a dead ringer for Apples in Stereo's Robert Schneider at some points and eerily reminiscent of the dB's' Chris Stamey at others. In any case, the constant low-grade déjà vu is a boon in an intentionally derivative subgenre like power pop, where being a well-studied song encyclopedia is half the point. The other half, of course, is to write songs that are great by themselves, and Army Navy is a blast even if you've never heard of Bomp! Records. The melodies expertly blend heartache and insouciance, so even when Kennedy offers something as pointed as ""Believe me when I call and I say/ The next girl that I love won't be a saint/ Now go away,"" it sighs rather than sneers. Contemplative midtempo numbers like ""Slight of Hand"", ""In the Lime"", and the achingly pretty ""Golden Pony"" split time with upbeat rockers like ""My Thin Sides"", where the hyperactive drumming buoys a jigging little guitar figure. Nearly every track boasts a breakdown or a bridge as fully realized and catchy as the enormous choruses: Kennedy is the kind of guy who believes firmly in the power of the middle eight. But the classic moment, the three minutes of pure alchemy that capture the swagger, vulnerability, and goofy joy that defines the best of power pop, comes from the single cover-- Maxine Nightingale's 1975 smash ""Right Back Where We Started From"". It's a head-smackingly perfect song choice: a time-warp and a gender-warp, a boy singing a girl's song that was written during the disco era to remind people of the Motown era. The guitars shimmer, groove, and swing; pianos pound while handclaps ricochet off the downbeat; and Pete Thomas does the big-beat Dave Clark Five caveman pound on the chorus, which comes back again and again, never losing an ounce of joyousness. It's exactly this sort of effortless charm that causes accountant dads to start eyeing their long-dormant six-strings.","Singer and songwriter Justin Kennedy joins former Attractions member Pete Thomas and several others to create a buoyant valentine to the power pop of the late 1970s and early 80s.

Oh! Mighty Engine,Neil Halstead,by: Nitsuh Abebe,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a0029d034d5c69bf25f6/1:1/w_160/5a6dc2f4.jpg,2009-01-13 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12549-oh-mighty-engine/,Brushfire,"I have no idea how much effort Neil Halstead puts into writing his songs; for all I know, he's secretly slaving over every chord change. But across a few decades and three projects, he's made it sound remarkably easy, like these tunes just drop out of his sleeves on slow afternoons. That's the common thread running through his work, from Slowdive (the dreamy English shoegaze act he started with) to Mojave 3 (a brand of dreamy Americana) to his solo records (on which he barely seems to have changed out of his pajamas)-- he writes sleepy, graceful pop songs like there's no higher calling on earth, and all signs suggest it comes naturally. A guitar, a handful of chords, and a lilting mumble, and he always provides something that works. Oh! Mighty Engine is his second solo record, following 2002's well-liked Sleeping on Roads. That first album's name seemed apt: Halstead's music is good company for travel and sleep both. This new album's name isn't so apt, though, either in its old-folkie implications or the suggestion that there's any kind of internal combustion involved here, any aspiration toward the ""mighty"". This record comes to us via Brushfire, Jack Johnson's Hawaii-based label, and the fit's a surprisingly good one: Years away from those stylish shoegazer days, Halstead passes awfully well as a beardy beach-bound slacker, standing contentedly in Californian sun instead of English rain, a guitar on the passenger seat and a surfboard on the roof. And this record, I'm guessing, sounds a lot better if you live someplace where you can drive barefoot, interact with natural bodies of water, own multiple large dogs, or see stars at night. Mostly it's just Halstead and a nylon-stringed guitar, recorded with warmth and space to spare, cooing about fireflies and seeing the good in people. You might think it was an insult if I said I'm occasionally put in mind of Jackson Browne, but I'm betting Halstead wouldn't; after all, Jackson Browne wrote Nico's ""These Days"", and I suspect Halstead's trying to do something similar with ""Sometimes the Wheels"". Shakers, light drumming, pedal steel, and a few keyboards swoop through, but none of them are looking to mess with the heavy lidded vibe of Halstead's songs and harmonies, whether it's the lush, sunny ones or the starker, darker, Nick Drake-style numbers. These sounds fill up a space beautifully, it's true, hushing all other noise in a way that's hard not to feel contented by-- and decent melodies still seem to be dropping out of Halstead's sleeves as reliably as ever. Put some of these songs on, and you can nearly feel yourself standing in a big empty house on a warm evening, can nearly smell the tea lights. Only... where oh where's the ""mighty""? Even if you haven't been following Halstead down these lines for a while, you might find yourself annoyed by that contentedness, or by the laid-back commonplaces of the lyrics. This is the problem with the beach bum as artist, after all: You get a lot of vague reassurances concerning what life's like (and stabs at bemused charm like ""Baby, I Grew You a Beard""), but never do you get anything in the way of fire, of fear, of desolation, of crisis, or of real human detail. Oh! Mighty Engine is endlessly pleasant but oddly faceless, a record strangely free of feeling. Maybe grand gestures just aren't what Halstead's selling with his solo work, sure; there's nothing wrong with soundtracking people's breezy nights this well, especially as a sort of side project. But think back on the records like this that really stick with you, and it's always the ones with a face, a strangeness, an ineffable quality that sets them apart. There are times when Halstead really has that, but this isn't quite one of them.","The second solo album from the former Slowdive and Mojave 3 leader finds him sounding less like he's hiding from the English rain and more like he's soaking in the California sun.

Steps to Heaven / Charlie Louvin Sings Murder Ballads and Disaster Songs,Charlie Louvin,by: Stephen M. Deusner,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/59299feeb1335d7bf1697ee2/1:1/w_160/20f61f16.jpg,2009-01-13 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12534-steps-to-heaven-charlie-louvin-sings-murder-ballads-and-disaster-songs/,Tompkins Square,"Charlie Louvin has been singing about the extremes of country music-- salvation and damnation-- throughout his long life. He and his brother Ira began harmonizing at home as kids in the 1930s and playing their first public shows as teenagers in the early 1940s. During the 1950s and 60s, they had hits with secular and nonsecular songs alike, which cemented their legacy as one of country's most conflicted acts: On guitar, Charlie was sensible and earnest, but Ira, playing mandolin, was temperamental and worldly. The brothers' differences illuminate the morals in every song, whether it's a churchly number like ""The Family Who Prays"" or a grisly narrative like ""Knoxville Girl"". Ira died in a car crash in 1965; Charlie continues to make music, but has no one to harmonize with him. After his strong self-titled comeback in 2007, the 81-year-old Louvin has released two follow-ups, each exploring a starkly different theme. Steps to Heaven is an uplifting collection of old hymns; Charlie Louvin Sings Murder Ballads and Disaster Songs is pretty self-explanatory. One is about glory and redemption, the other tragedy and tribulation. While he's not nearly as vocally agile as he was decades ago, he does sound better-- stronger, clearer-- than he did on last year's Charlie Louvin. On Steps to Heaven, he sounds plucky and rejuvenated, tearing into these ten hymns with spirited reverence and hitting even the high notes confidently and happily. Producer Mark Nevers (best known for his work with Lambchop) sets him in a casual church service setting, backed primarily by Lee Derrick's rollicking piano and a bold backing choir that occasionally intrudes on Louvin's leads. His lively ""There's a Higher Power"" and intensely testimonial ""I Am Bound for the Promised Land"" are sincerely moving. He conveys belief and contentment with every note. Steps to Heaven may be the more spiritually rewarding of these two albums, but Murder Ballads is much more fun. These grim accounts of mine collapses, shootings, train wrecks, and dead babies-- some of which appeared on the Louvin Brothers' 1956 album, Tragic Songs of Life-- have an almost tabloid aplomb in their matter-of-fact details. Louvin sounds spry on opener ""Darling Corey"" (featuring Andrew Bird on fiddle) and ""Dixie Boll Weevil"", on which he voices both the farmer and the destructive beetle. Most of the album, however, is much more somber and often elegant, with Louvin relating these stories with an easy, earthy gravity, as if he's singing about people he has known personally. ""The Little Grave in Georgia"" sets the mournful story of a dead teenager against a soft two-step, and ""Mary of the Wild Moor"", which was among the first songs Charlie and his brother performed as teenager, sounds especially stately in this arrangement. Still, it's impossible to ignore the gruesome details, like the conductor scalded to death by a steam engine on ""Wreck of the Old 97"". What a way to go. Of course, there is some thematic and musical overlap between these two releases. Steps to Heaven, as its title makes clear, has death on its mind, albeit as a reward for a forthright life rather than as punishment or tragedy. Similarly, the characters on Murder Ballads yearn for the redemption they soon realize will never come. Happiness and grief inform every life, and Louvin inhabits the songs like he's experienced his share of both. As he sings on ""Down with the Old Canoe"", ""The hand of God was in it all.""",,7.3,
Black Secret Technology,A Guy Called Gerald,by: Tim Finney,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/59299fe3b1335d7bf1697ec8/1:1/w_160/fe28cb84.jpg,2009-01-13 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12523-black-secret-technology/,Juice BoxJuice Box,"Received wisdom states that jungle brought about its own demise with its over-hasty coffee table gentrification (as symbolized by replacement genre name ""drum'n'bass""), ushering in muso jazz and studio musicianship while draining the dancefloor energy that made the music vital in the first place. Of course, with drum'n'bass having spent more than a decade pounding ""dancefloor energy"" into an ideas-devoid mono-groove, it's worth examining whether the prior phase of decadent gentrification was really all its detractors claim it to be. Listening to Goldie's bloated 2xCD debut Timeless again, what irritates isn't the presence of noodling saxophones so much as the suspicion that Goldie thought it took a saxophone to make jungle epic. Orbital, with the clear vision sometimes gifted to outsiders, proved on their 1994 faux-jungle stab ""Are We Here?"" that the real possibility of the ""epic"" in jungle was hidden within the beat programming, offering up a broiling sea of slithering, snake-like drums. I like to think Orbital had been listening to A Guy Called Gerald (aka Gerald Simpson), who a year later released perhaps the only drum'n'bass album to successfully match gentrification with a consistent focus on ""rhythmic danger."" It's this, together with the album's scarcity, that has long made Black Secret Technology a much-touted candidate for ""best jungle album ever."" Previously, though, listeners had to imagine an ideal version of this music, squinting their ears to hear past the (diametrically flawed) murkiness or limp politeness of the mastering on the album's two prior releases. Thankfully, this new remaster of the original 1995 release achieves the best of both worlds, capturing the density of the original productions with a sharpness and force that was hitherto missing. Perhaps the greatest achievement of Black Secret Technology was to break so radically with many of his peers' presumption of an inverse relationship between rhythmic complexity and musical sophistication. Blending in with the class of 95's aspirational mood-- albeit offering a more minimalist, Detroit-inspired take on it-- Gerald laces his productions with soft-centred synth pads, slightly moody soulful diva soundbites, precariously wafting flute samples, and eerie strings. But all this remains a foil for the unrepentant, rumbling boom of the bass-- and especially the beats. There is simply no other single-artist jungle album that pushes consciousness-altering beat programming as far, as fearlessly, as it is pushed here. Indeed, when it comes to rhythms this album is an embarrassment of riches. ""The Reno"" features cyborg drummers that seem to multiply before your eyes (or ears), the rhythm doubling over itself again and again while a diva cries ""eeeh yeah-eh-eh-eh,"" all swirling with a viscosity reminiscent of DJ Pierre's ""Wild Pitch"" house sound. On ""Survival"", chattering time-stretched snares are progressively shattered into smaller and smaller pieces, until the groove resembles a fractured Cubist portrait of itself. On ""Dreaming of You"", snippets of hand-percussion seem to rise and curl around your eardrums like steam. Most amazingly, the ravished and ravishing ""Cyberjazz"" is possessed with convulsive shudders, beats fluttering with a stop-start nervous intensity that evokes a myriad of electric synapses flickering on and off. Gerald's approach to rhythm is almost decadent at times: frequently, painstakingly assembled interlocking layers of beats are placed almost on the edge of conscious awareness, or otherwise punchy rhythms become swallowed up in tidal swells of infra-red bass. On gorgeous reggae-jungle single ""Finley's Rainbow"" the astonishing, counter-intuitive beats rain down with murderous fury somewhere far off in the distance; the effect is like watching a thunderstorm over a distant bay, with only brief moments of being lashed by the hail and the lightning. At times this can be slightly frustrating; at others I'm reminded of that strange combination of harmony and headwreck that krautrockers Can concocted on Future Days (ironically or fittingly, Gerald's greatest ever attempt to toughen up his mindboggling mid-nineties aesthetic remains his remix of Can's ""Tango Whiskeyman""). Like Can, Gerald understood that the division between ""head music"" and ""body music"" is false and unnecessary: Black Secret Technology achieves its sense of hypnotic drift through panoramic rhythmic compulsion, supplying a frictionless endorphin high that only comes with a massive expense of physical energy. Gentrification? More like a very noble savagery.","Long considered a contender for the title of ""best jungle album ever,"" A Guy Called Gerald's 1995 classic Black Secret Technology returns in newly mastered form.

Picture Book,The Kinks,by: Joe Tangari,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a007ea9e61561daa448b/1:1/w_160/a61161c9.jpg,2009-01-13 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12554-picture-book/,Sanctuary,"Any attempt to offer an authoritative overview of the Kinks' career is fraught with difficulty. During the band's long run from 1962 through 1996, the Davies brothers and their abettors never morphed into a nostalgia act, continually changing and writing new material to create a varied but distinctive body of work. The variation isn't only stylistic, either-- their catalog varies a lot in quality as well. The Kinks' work from 1966 through 1970 is basically unimpeachable, but opinions differ widely on what came after, and for good reason. So in constructing a six-disc look at the band's vast catalog, the challenge becomes to adequately represent each of the its phases while balancing considerations of what's actually worthwhile. Picture Book answers this challenge through a capricious, sometimes puzzling track selection, which was assisted by Ray Davies. It's a (mostly) chronological jumble of singles, album tracks, alternate mixes, mono versions, live cuts, rarities, hits, misses, and even a couple demos and one rehearsal. Two-thirds of the material is familiar album and single tracks, though, meaning that hardcore fans hoping for a bonanza will ultimately find about two discs worth of stuff they don't have or previously found difficult to get, some of which are hard-to-distinguish mono mixes. Then there's the matter of who actually wants a box that covers the band's whole career but leaves out tons of the band's best tracks and has a sixth disc that's mostly awful. The set starts with BBC announcer Brian Matthew introducing the band before ""You Really Got Me"" rips into rock'n'roll and takes out a lasting bite with its brutal slashed-amp distortion and stupid-simple riff. The 1964 song put the band firmly on the map-- it was a UK #1 and a Top Ten hit in the U.S.-- but it was actually their third single. Here, it's followed a few tracks later by their first, a cover of ""Long Tall Sally"" that justifiably went nowhere. Omitted is their second single, the superb and infectiously melodic flop ""You Still Want Me"", which was thankfully included on Essential's 1998 remaster of the band's self-titled debut. The period from 1964 through 1971 covers the first three discs and spills onto the fourth, which is as good an assessment as any of the band's best and most creative period. The run of albums from 1966's Face to Face through Something Else and Village Green Preservation Society to 1969's Arthur, or the Decline And Fall of the British Empire is a spectacular four-LP run that established Ray Davies as one of the keenest observers of British society and cemented the band's influence and legacy. It's hard to go wrong skipping around the first few discs of this set, though the rough demo of ""Dead End Street"" and the twice-aborted rehearsal of ""Come on Now"" are poor substitutes for the familiar versions. A host of non-album tracks make this section particularly rewarding. ""Autumn Almanac"" is practically a blueprint for XTC, the radio session version of Dave Davies' overlooked and excellent ""Love Me Till the Sun Shines"" burns with sharp intensity, Dutch B-side ""This Is Where I Belong"" was justly included on Kink Kronikles and sounds no less vital here, and the haunting piano-and-vocal cast-off ""I Go to Sleep"" is simply gorgeous. Early outtakes ""A Little Bit of Sunlight"" and ""This I Know"" also hit the British Invasion sweet spot. It's a crime that the band was kept out of the U.S. by an American Federation of Musicians ban during its most creative period, but the band became so quintessentially English during that period that it's possible American audiences wouldn't have been receptive anyway. The Kinks' golden era extended into the 70s with the Lola Vs Powerman & the Moneygoround and Muswell Hillbillies LPs, which are amply represented. It's also nice to hear three tracks from the soundtrack to the comedy Percy, which has long been treated like a bastard child in the band's discography. ""The Way Love Used to Be"" is an especially great song, a dark, moody ballad sweetened by lush orchestration. The Muswell album found Ray Davies taking a break from incisively and sympathetically critiquing British society to instead indulge a little second-hand Americana. Bassist Peter Quaife had exited the band in 1969, and the Davies brothers and drummer Mick Avory had expanded the band to include a full-time keyboardist-- John Gosling's warm Hammond organ and tack piano deepened the Americanness of songs like ""Muswell Hillbilly"" and ""20th Century Man"". ""Alcohol"", presented here in a live version, echoes some of the music hall traditions that would become the band's staple reference point in the mid-70s. During the Kinks' time at RCA in the 70s, Ray Davies indulged in a series of poorly received concept albums that don't wear nearly as well today as the band's 60s output, but there are quite a few gems hidden away in this period, which comprises the bulk of Disc Four. The two-part would-be rock opera Preservation had an endearingly rough sound (it was some of the first material recorded at the band's own Konk studios), but the inclusion of female backing vocalists and a horn section in the band didn't always add much to the songs. The other two albums from this period, Soap Opera and Schoolboys in Disgrace, a sequel to Preservation that focused on the villain, Mr. Flash, are scantly represented with three total tracks, but the choices are inspired: Soap Opera's ""Holiday Romance"" is a wonderful music hall throwback with hints of Noel Coward, while the loan Schoolboys track, ""No More Looking Back"", is a cinematic preview of 90s Britpop, from Dave's harmonized lead guitar intro to Ray's perceptive lyrics about the way people who've left us linger in strange ways. If this set were more interested in telling the story of the band, it probably would have also included ""The Hard Way"", a heavy track that anticipated the band's late-70s shift to slick hard rock and became a concert staple. The band's six hard rock albums for Arista, released from 1977 through 1984, represent their most misunderstood period. Some fans of the band's 60s output dismiss it entirely, and it's certainly not up to that standard, but very little is. They experienced their biggest success in the U.S. during this period (1979's Low Budget, at #11, was their highest-charting US album), and they were at the peak of their concert drawing power, touring almost constantly back and forth across the Atlantic. Oddly, they were making corporate rock just as their old music returned to vogue as inspiration for British punks, with the Jam covering ""David Watts"". There is a fair amount of good stuff on these albums, but you have to dig more for it, and not all of it is here. The two biggest omissions are ""Juke Box Music"" and ""Around the Dial"", which is sort of an old crank's companion to Elvis Costello's ""Radio Radio"". Some of what has been included just misses the mark. Low Budget in particular is crammed with lame songs like ""Attitude"", a terrible diatribe that's the exact opposite of the empathetic, detailed storytelling Ray Davies excels at. Even some of the better songs from this period, like the slow character study ""Rock and Roll Fantasy"", lack the wit and insight of ""Two Sisters"" and ""Sunny Afternoon"". ""Destroyer"", though, is a slaying, rambunctious rock track that revisits Ray's encounter with Lola the next day to hilarious effect. The band is also effective on ""Sleepwalker"" and ""Misfits"", nicely summing up modern alienation on the latter with the line ""Take a real good look around. The misfits are everywhere."" The relative rarities form this period are mostly lackluster. The ebulliently nostalgic storytelling of ""Come Dancing"" is here as a weak demo, while ""Maybe I Love You"" is an inconsequential nothing from the scrap heap. ""Nuclear Love"" is an enjoyable excursion into near-New Wave but hardly essential. As the band's Arista deal wrapped up with Word of Mouth in 1984, they were already falling back out of commercial favor (they'd never really returned to it in the UK), and long-simmering tension between Dave Davies and Mick Avory led to the drummer's exit, much to Ray's dismay. Most of Disc Six is given to the post-Avory era, when the band wandered in the commercial wilderness, recording weak hard rock albums that are scarcely worth summarizing with a track or two, much less hearing in their entirety. The studio leftover ""Million Pound Semi-Detached"" is the most charming thing from that period included here, in part because it sounds like it was recorded at Konk in the mid-70s, but also because Ray's wit has returned in its tale of a couple buying a house, raising a family, and generally living the dream, only to find that the dream left out all the boredom and frustration. It was their best comment on the State of British Life since Dave's post-Empire lament ""Living on a Thin Line"", from 1984. The set wraps up with the final Kinks material, from 1993's Phobia and their last record, the hodgepodge To the Bone. Bizarrely, there are five songs from Phobia, and not one of them is ""Hatred (A Duet)"", the only truly great Kinks song from the band's final decade together. That song features Dave and Ray satirizing their own famously stormy working relationship, but the songs here don't even approach that level of humor or humanity. It's little wonder that hardly anyone noticed when the band split in 1996. Perhaps the ultimate drawback of covering the Kinks' entire oeuvre on one set is the need to tack on songs from their most irrelevant records. It's difficult to discern precisely who the audience for this set is-- the band's hardcore fans will appreciate most of the rarities, but this is not a catch-all for Kinks odds and sods, and the sheer volume of material that any true fan already owns means that the set is a pricey way to get what rarities there are. If you're new to the band and absolutely require a career overview before going straight to the essential late-60s albums, Castle's Ultimate Collection, which covers up to 1984, is a much more solid introduction.","In part compiled by Ray Davies, this mostly chronological jumble of singles, album tracks, alternate mixes, mono versions, live cuts, rarities, hits, misses, and even a couple demos and one rehearsal attempts the Herculean task of compiling the Kinks' four-decade career into one 6xCD box.

My Magic City,Caithlin De Marrais,by: Ben Westhoff,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/59299fe15e6ef9596931fe17/1:1/w_160/1c183ca1.jpg,2009-01-12 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12521-my-magic-city/,End Up,"During their decade-plus existence Rainer Maria held a certain corner of the sensitive English-major circuit down. Like boy/girl outfits Mates of State and Georgie James, who have found success with hard/soft vocal combinations, poppy arrangements, and elegant poetry about existential despair, Rainer Maria got their yin/yang balance right most of the time. They dissolved in 2006, and former member Kyle Fischer released a solo album earlier this year called Black Milk. Fischer went deeply internal on this winning record, wrapping his songs in layers of dense post-production. The solo debut from another Rainer Maria alum, Caithlin De Marrais, has nothing to hide behind, however. Though also co-produced and engineered by Fischer (De Marrais' ex-boyfriend), My Magic City has minimal overdubs and really consists of little more than her voice. Okay, technically, there are unobtrusive acoustic guitar parts and soft piano, but her pipes are nearly always front-and-center in the songs. This is understandable. On Rainer Maria records, or when she performs with Brooklyn-based collective Balthrop, Alabama, her first-robin-of-the-season melodies are almost always memorable. But whereas in those situations her voice serves as an antidote to those of her less-silky male counterparts', on My Magic City it's pretty much all her all the time, and occasionally the whole cuppa joe is too sugary. The songs are mostly live studio performances recorded in locations including a Carroll Gardens Episcopal church, an upstate cottage, and De Marrais' own apartment. There's no doubt the other players-- good friends and neighbors, most all-- have an easy rapport with her and complement each other well. But in spots the album could use more friction, both in the music and the words. ""Like a watch that I wound until I broke a spring/ Like a lock in a door in which I've broken off the key/ Now I'm holding her heart and I'm risking everything,"" she begins on ""Carefully"", suggesting that conflict lies ahead. But no. ""Let me be true,"" she continues. ""And let me be gentle where there is a gentle need/ Let me love this girl/ Let me love her carefully."" Through much of the album one wishes she wasn't quite so gentle. Still, it's easy to appreciate her chops, and the tracks that offer narrative intrigue make the disc worthwhile. ""I hate to think of all the time we wasted talking about your crimes/ It's 2 a.m., and there goes the phone again,"" she sings on ""Voicemail"". ""And when mom was in the hospital/ We came to visit one and all/ But you refused to go/ What were you thinking?"" (True that, ya jerk.) Closer ""April You Changed Your Mind"", meanwhile, has a driving, insistent quality that demands the listener's attention, like a soft slap to the face. One wishes the rest of the work was similarly aggressive.","Solo debut from the vocalist of now-defunct Rainer Maria, mostly recorded live and in intimate settings, offers instrumental chops and narrative intrigue.

Songs from the Beehive,Move DBenjamin Brunn,by: Andrew Gaerig,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/59299ff513d197565213827a/1:1/w_160/615fc8b8.jpg,2009-01-12 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12539-songs-from-the-beehive/,Smallville,"Move D and Benjamin Brunn's Songs from the Beehive counts as one of the year's most idiosyncratic electronic releases. A collaboration between Germans David Moufang (Move D) and Brunn, Songs overlaps little with signpost trends of the past few years, instead grasping for the type of been-there thwump-and-click so familiar you'll struggle to find a buzz-word buzzier than ""techno."" Drawing on almost all of its creators' past dalliances-- trip-hop, trance, minimal, dub, ambient-- Songs is an album that constantly whispers in your year, sometimes literally, and builds damp, murky headspaces out of its elliptical grooves. That Songs trends towards the classic techno sounds shouldn't come as a huge surprise: Moufang has been an underground favorite since the early 1990s and Brunn has been releasing singles since 1999. And while this review is a little late on the come-up, make no mistake: Songs marks something of a breakthrough for Brunn and especially Moufang, the type of album that makes even electronic junkies-- those who have long praised Moufang's catalogue-- sit up and notice. Songs consists of seven long-form tracks, most of which aim to soundtrack the soft-palate dancefloor in the back of your head. ""Love the One You're With"" encapsulates this cloistered clubby-ness, opening Songs with a chopped vocal sample and slow-change synth notes. A rhythmic chirp, stunted bass sequence, and spacey, panning notes are introduced slowly, like how an innertube sits motionless for a few moments as the motorboat tenses the line. The ingredients undoubtedly sound familiar, but Brunn and Moufang make subtle upgrades: The high-pitched chirp that anchors the track sounds like an insect, while the clipped vocals are indecipherable speech, not song. ""Love the One You're With"" is the first of three long tracks to open Songs, which gives the opening 40 minutes of the album a hazy, marathon feel. ""Honey"" ramps up the fastest, beginning with skittish bass notes before Moufang and Brunn coax out a quick 4/4 kick. The track is an exercise in tempo: Long ambient drones contrast with flurries of rainbow notes and taut rhythms. ""Velvet Paws"" searches purposefully without ever wandering, as Moufang and Brunn tend to the track's early morning orbits with patient, veteran fingers. The prize at the end of the three-headed marathon is Songs' most singular track, ""Like a Restless Sea"", which loops a whispered refrain-- ""The wind that moves the trees like a restless sea""-- over distended, subtly rhythmic keyboard noise. Indeed, most of the motion in the track is provided by its hushed voice-- a stressed syllable on ""rest"" serves as the track's tether-- and the result sounds like Moufang and Brunn singing a lullaby to house music. Album closer ""Radar"", clocking in at nearly 21 minutes, sounds forward and flirtatious, a bulbous, trance-y floor-filler that dissipates into murky, rhythmic clatter and one miniature, exhilarated voice. Moufang and Brunn have long proved themselves bright, dedicated composers, but Songs represents a new high for both: a careful, vibrant long-player from two unheralded 12"" warriors that should make thoughts and soles move with equal grace.","Two veteran German producers come together for an outstanding album that, despite its lengthy tracks, remains oddly accessible. Here they draw on all the styles they've touched on in the past, from dubby minimal techno to house to ambient.

"Living Is Hard: West African Music in Britain, 1927-1929",Various Artists,by: Joe Tangari,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/59299ff013d197565213826e/1:1/w_160/7ba26456.jpg,2009-01-12 06:00:02,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12535-living-is-hard-west-african-music-in-britain-1927-1929/,Honest Jon's,"Summarizing the back catalog controlled by the EMI conglomerate is like summarizing the ocean. Where does one even start? There is so much music there, some of it extant only on worn-out 78s, moldy reels, or ultra-fragile cylinders, with scarce documentation a chronic ailment of the oldest recordings. In searching for an organizing principle, Damon Albarn's Honest Jon's label has settled on probably the most logical ones available: geography, timeframe, and culture. They've been here before with their superb London Is the Place for Me series, but Living Is Hard is one of their first releases in an ambitious mining project that aims to bring EMI's 1920s ethnic recordings back from the abyss of obscurity. The recordings on the disc were made in London by an assortment of visiting and resident West African musicians and singers for the Zonophone label, which then marketed the recordings almost exclusively in West Africa. The Zonophone label has convoluted roots, stretching back to the founding of a talking machine and disc recording company called Zon-O-Phone in Camden, N.J., in 1899. After a series of civil lawsuits (a long story worth reading on its own), the company's European assets were absorbed by the UK-based Gramophone & Typewriter Company, later the Gramophone Company, and the parent corporation of His Master's Voice, now more commonly known as HMV. Though the original company died in the 1903 lawsuit, the Zonophone name, de-punctuated, lived on well into the 1980s, and was apparently revived again last year by EMI for a reissue project. For our purposes here, it's most important to know that among its many other uses, the Zonophone name was used from the 1920s through the 50s to market recordings of West African music, primarily in Ghana and Nigeria, which were British colonies at the time. This is not a compilation that caters to tastes shaped by rock'n'roll, funk, and soul, as a great many recent African music collections do-- this is primarily folk music, and voices, sometimes with a small amount of percussion, are all that comprise many of these tracks. A few feature heavier percussion, and a bit of guitar on four tracks is the only other instrument you'll hear. Little is known about many of the musicians-- the liner notes tell you what they can, including tidbits about Ben Simmons' African nationalism and informed speculation as to the hometown of Nicholas de Heer. The tracks featuring guitar fall mostly into a melodic, easygoing style. Harry E. Quashie's ""Anadwofa"" has a similar feel to the highlife that grew to dominate Ghanaian and Nigerian music in the 50s and 60s, and on ""Akuko Nu Bonto"" George Williams Aingo plays in a similar style, but augmented by backing vocals similar to those the answer the lead voice on some of the a cappella tracks included here. The Kumasi Trio's ""Asin Asin Part 2"" tells the story of the group's trip to Britain, mirroring the palmwine style then popular in Ghana, where the band was from (Kumasi is a city in south-central Ghana). The West African Instrumental Quintet's ""Adersu No. 2"" spices it Gold Coast rhythms with a surprising Spanish-influenced guitar part. Aingo had a second track, and it's one of the most interesting of the a cappella pieces featured. His backing singers give him wordless and very rhythmic phrases that push along his lead vocal, similar to the way the American Golden Gate Jubilee Quartet pushed along its gospel tunes. Prince Zulamkah sounds as if he's in a trance, repeating the same few phrases over and over again to a series of three answers delivered by a small chorus, one of which is ""shingaling."" No word on whether this usage of that word had anything to do with the name of the 60s dance craze, but these musicians wound their way through British music scenes, and in particular the jazz scene, with plenty of contact with Americans, so you never know. My favorite vocal and percussion track is probably John Mugat's ""Bukay"", which is about the funkiest thing I've heard from the 20s-- the hand drums give it a relentless rhythm drive, but even the backing vocals have a kind of stabbing, rhythmic intensity that's very much of a piece with a 70s horn section. So although this disc isn't meant to compromise with a Western listener, it's still quite easy to listen to if you meet it on its terms. This is a fascinating chapter in the history of global migration, and it could be argued with some success that the 20s were the greatest decade for the preservation of genuine folk music traditions on recordings. The Honest Jon's people have gone all out to make these recordings as clear and present as possible, but source limitations naturally come into play (I happen to like the roomsound element of early recordings). If this disc piques your interest, I suggest checking out Interstate Music's Heritage imprint, which has compiled the Kumasi Trio twice, once on their own, and again backing Jacob Sam. The company has also released a compilation of the West African Instrumental Quintet, and a Domingo Justus set chronicling his role in the evolution of the juju style. Their Early Guitar Music from West Africa, 1927-1929 compilation, while it shares few artists with this set, is also a logical place to investigate further. After one listen to this, you'll likely want to.","The latest archival release on Damon Albarn's Honest Jon's imprint collects early 78 sides containing spare folk songs, primarily from Ghana and Nigeria, many of which are delivered a cappella.

Fabric 43,Metro Area,by: Jess Harvell,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a004b1335d7bf1697f18/1:1/w_160/e344d3ab.jpg,2009-01-12 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12551-fabric-43/,Fabric,"On each of their seven EPs-- the first four distilled/expanded into a near-perfect self-titled album in 2002-- neo-disco duo Metro Area have refined a lusciously restrained take on that most shameless of genres. But for their entry in Fabric's DJ series-- which features the silliest Fabric opening since Carl Craig flipped the Ying Yang Twins into Kraftwerkian sex music, and closes with a synth-rock sugar rush-- Morgan Geist and Darshan Jesrani have turned in a party mix. Of course, ""party mix"" is relative; you may not set your shindigs off with stripped-down, disco-era dubs. But though good parties aren't usually remembered for their restraint, it's actually the duo's classicism that gives Fabric 43 its edge in a crowded mix market. Rather than regurgitating hook after exhausting hook in crowd-pleasing desperation, the duo flaunts an old-school DJ's assurance, knowing when to let a beat ride and when to jolt a groove with a punchy snatch of vocal. Expert pacing will always draw in the dance snobs, but there are few ""songs"" here. It'll help the less-committed to approach Fabric 43 with at least a dollop of love for disco in its many forms, from hyper-syncopated minimalism to hyper-sexed bubblegum. If swinging 4/4 drums don't automatically float your boat, Metro Area's committed to rhythmic variety in the name of maintaining home-listening interest. Just when you're worn out on trad disco beats, here comes a barrage of grungy, stuttering Chicago house snares, or brooding synth-rock drums swept away by a bright burst of piano-and-strings. And so on, sliding from mood to mood and era to era without disrupting the mix's creamy flow. Even vocally, the gospel-derived call-and-response and ecstatic R&B harmonies of the American disco tradition are liberally spiked with the arch Anglo melodrama and chintzy Euro playfulness that made up disco's internationalist wing. As the mix passes the halfway mark, ""playful"" actually becomes the watchword: a squelching, stomping electro-disco remake of the Temptations' ""Cloud Nine"" that says to hell with everything but the chorus; Plez's acid house one-off ""I Can't Stop"", which sounds like a bilious lothario grunting his way through a John Carpenter outtake; an outro by noted masters of high-seriousness Devo. You'll laugh, you'll cry, and you'll occasionally cringe with glee at a synth hook that's just a little too ostentatious. Something for everyone. Well, sort of. Technically flawless and plenty of fun-- it is a disco mix, however dub-fixated the duo's taste in the genre-- Fabric 43 probably still isn't for casual listeners who buy the occasional DJ mix for novelty's sake. For fans, those left-field choices usually work to reinforce the upscale boogie aesthetic Geist and Jesrani mapped seven long years ago on Metro Area, rather than exploring more recent trends in DJ's passing off rock and prog tunes as ""disco"" for an audience reared on VH1 clips of Gloria Gaynor. But the duo's smooth, mid-tempo foundation sprouts enough surprises to make the mix stand out from the 21st-century disco-mix glut and the Fabric series' own inconsistent late-decade quality control. (The brilliantly orchestrated, rapid-fire vocal overlaps of Data's ""Blow"", its sassy ""whoa's"" flying like neon bullets in a new wave-era action flick, actually made me catch my breath on first listen.) And it would be a shame if this consistently listenable late 2008 release got lost in the rush to see the year off.","Morgan Geist and Darshan Jesrani's Metro Area are best known for a lusciously restrained take on disco, but for their entry in Fabric's peerless DJ series they've turned in something closer to a party mix.

Live at Park Avenue EP,José González,by: Marc Hogan,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Senior Staff Writer</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a006b1335d7bf1697f1b/1:1/w_160/a199cf6f.jpg,2009-01-12 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12553-live-at-park-avenue-ep/,ThinkIndie,"If you thought the music industry was in a state of flux, then consider the state of the live album. Thanks to YouTube, bit torrents, and YouSendIt-style file-transfer sites, amateur concert recordings are available as never before, almost instantly, to anyone in the world who wants to hear them. At the same time, indie listeners' growing acceptance of electronic-based music has made for live shows that are more about fans' communal experiences than any notes actually being played ""live""-- just ask anyone who has ever seen Girl Talk, or go pick up Justice's unconventional A Cross the Universe live CD. It's no surprise, then, that some of last year's most rewarding live albums came from the vaults: Otis Redding's Live in London and Paris, Neil Young's Sugar Mountain: Live at Canterbury House 1968. José González, the brooding Swedish bard of Argentine breeding, is in some ways a throwback to that earlier era. The songs on González's haunting sophomore album, 2007's In Our Nature, have the focused political fury and stripped-down arrangements of another generation of acoustic troubadours. But González's minimalist folk-pop shows a painterly appreciation for the nuances of organic sound-- a foot tap here, an off-mic murmur there-- that you won't find from your average coffeehouse singer-songwriter. The nine-song, half-hour Live At Park Avenue EP (available via ThinkIndie or in certain independent record stores) exemplifies one way to keep live recordings relevant at a time when they, like recorded music itself, are both ubiquitous and underappreciated. Although it can't capture all the subtlety of González's studio output, the EP is also an ideal introduction for González noobs. Park Avenue CD in Orlando, Fl., isn't exactly Carnegie Hall, but the instore crowd gives González's slow, moody polemics the kind of patient silence that never ceases to amaze me about the audience on Bob Dylan's Live at Carnegie Hall 1963 EP. The five songs from In Our Nature on Live At Park Avenue are clandestine descendants of protest songs like ""With God on Our Side"". Written after reading atheist extraordinaire Richard Dawkins, ""Abram"" blasts organized religion over descending acoustic guitar arpeggios gentle enough to cut the bitterness-- ""well, most of the time."" The terrible prophecies coursing through the percussive bass lines of ""How Low"" (performed here with murmuring introspection that belies its political fire) and the droning high strings of ""Down the Line"" will outlive the Bush administration-- and, I'm sorry to say, the Obama administration, too. González directs the intimate, elemental ""Time to Send Someone Away"" at someone who goes ""walking over bodies/ just to witness something new""; you think Gonzo's in for that? No way, José. ""The Nest"" is about birds the way ""The Ant and the Grasshopper"" is about Aesop's entomology research. The philosophical underpinnings of the songs from González's Pink Moon-esque debut album, Veneer, come to the surface next to his In Our Nature material. Pensive charmer ""Deadweight on Velveteen"" opens Live at Park Avenue with a slightly brighter guitar tone than its Veneer original, though still fuming against base dishonesty. With a refrain as catchy as its main guitar figure is repetitive, ""Hints"" shifts from Gonzalez's usual second-person lyrics to the first-person plural, including us in a community of independent thinkers; the flattery works. Vivid Veneer standout ""Crosses"", like the religious icons of its title (or Massive Attack), offers protection, and González doesn't disappoint on probably his best-known number, ""Heartbeats"". The imagery of devils, wolf's teeth, and hands from above goes a long way to explain why the Knife's song suits his repertoire so well. Live at Park Avenue EP features near-flawless performances of most of González's best songs, and the sound quality is fine, if a bit less appealing than on his lo-fi debut or its immaculately recorded sequel. There's little in the way of between-song banter, and the tracks stay pretty faithful to the originals. So if you already have the albums, this EP is a lovely live document-- just don't expect anyone to break new ground. Although an artist's ability to play well live on traditional (read: non-electronic) instruments has fuck-all to do with the quality of his records, live performances of those records tend to be more enjoyable when the performers-- imagine this-- know what they're doing. González's harrowing way with an acoustic guitar will be sure to please stuffy authenticity squares as well as listeners more interested in minor-key artistic relevations. But don't hold that against him.","The nine-song, half-hour Live At Park Avenue EP (available via ThinkIndie or in certain independent record stores) aims to keep live recordings relevant at a time when they, like recorded music itself, are both ubiquitous and easily acqiured by illegal means.

Reverse Migration,Au Revoir Simone,by: Joe Colly,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a003b1335d7bf1697f15/1:1/w_160/ca1f0041.jpg,2009-01-09 06:00:05,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12550-reverse-migration/,Our SecretOur Secret,"Light and breezy, Au Revoir Simone's synth-pop debut The Bird of Music didn't make a huge splash in 2007, but the Brooklyn trio has nevertheless commissioned a set of remixes. To be fair, Au Revoir Simone aren't treating Reverse Migration as a proper brick-and-mortar release-- it arrives without the usual PR blitz and is available only as a digital download from certain online retailers-- but the album (and others like it, see Stars' disastrous Do You Trust Your Friends?) helps to illustrate the frustrating overabundance of unnecessarily reworked material being hurled at listeners. Want more proof? Take a listen to the bounty of remixes clogging up music-blog aggregators such as Hype Machine and count how few actually move you and how many are there to give bloggers another reason/excuse to keep a band's name in the elbo.ws headlines. Sadly, the same exercise can be applied here: Despite several high-caliber contributors, Reverse Migration never really gets off the ground. The bulk of its remixers pay too much deference to the source material and wind up with versions that don't enhance their originals. Gothenburg-based electro pop duo Pacific! tries for a Grizzly Bear-ish haunted Americana take on ""Sad Song"", but their gawky rendering falls flat. Darkel (aka Air's Jean-Benoît Dunckel) puts his lunar spin on ""I Couldn't Sleep"", isolating the vocals and sprinkling in some ""Cherry Blossom Girl"" synths, but there's little that's captivating about his mix. And there are a few real stinkers, too: The recreation of ""Stars"" by New York's Disco Pusher has all of the qualities of a cheap dance remix-- a basic 4/4 backing, cheesy vocoders-- without even a trace of originality to wash them down. A few musicians do manage to score: Sneering UK party starters the Teenagers turn ""Fallen Snow"" into a sinister glitch pop track, their adaptation superior to its precedent and a first cousin of Crystal Castles' menacing 2008 juggernaut ""Untrust Us"". Montag's work on ""A Violent Yet Flammable World"" is equally intriguing; the French-Canadian producer splits the track in half, adding orchestral touches and lush synths to its back end for a vivid, luminous effect. The record's lone moment of true inventiveness comes from a likely source, Hot Chip's Alexis Taylor, the only artist to use his remix as an opportunity to fabricate an entirely new track. Indeed, his remarkable take on ""Sad Song"" doesn't share as much a note of similarity to its precursor; Taylor mutilates the track and then reconstructs it as an eight-minute future-pop epic packed with mechanical distortions and flapping, rubbery synths. And when Taylor croons in his geeky, guileless manner, ""Play me a sad song... I want you to make me cry"", it comes across as more earnest and believable than when ARS breathily told us the same. It's not enough, this song, to pull Reverse Migration out of the why-do-we-need-this pile, but it helps to remind us what a great remix can be-- how, when done properly, it can elevate the source material and reveal new layers to a song we thought we knew. It's funny to be reminded of this while listening to an album that's constantly trying to persuade us otherwise.","Despite appearances from Hot Chip's Alexis Taylor and Air's Jean-Benoît Dunckel, this Au Revoir Simone remix album is as hit-and-miss as the average Hype Machine chart.

"XOXO, Panda and the New Kid Revival",Her Space Holiday,by: Ian Cohen,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929be06abf31b7dc71560a5/1:1/w_160/ce411765.jpg,2009-01-09 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12445-xoxo-panda-and-the-new-kid-revival/,Mush,"From just about any angle, Marc Bianchi is a niche artist. Over the span of five albums and numerous singles and EPs as Her Space Holiday, he's worked within the confines of a bedroom lap-pop sound informed by big beat and an occasional dash of IDM while delivering often uncomfortably candid lyrics in a deadpan, nearly anti-melodic whisper. Post-Postal Service, it's not a real growth area. You're accustomed to a certain way of listening to Her Space Holiday, which is why the rippling, Marquee Moon-style major chords and free-to-be-you-and-me lyric of ""The New Kid Revival"" could initially be seen as a daft anti-piracy measure. If you nabbed it as an illegal download, you'd swear some joker had pulled a fast one on you. In a Cloud Cult review, I used the term ""unplugged Her Space Holiday"" as somewhat of a joke about a style of music that couldn't possibly exist, but that's pretty much exactly what happens here. I can't vouch for what's gone down in Bianchi's personal life, but XOXO, Panda and the New Kid Revival is an album of sobriety and comfort-- ""Used to think that being alone would somehow simplify my life,"" he sings on ""The Heartbreak Moment"", this from the author of ""The Luxury of Loneliness"". It's all relative, though-- ""The World Will Deem Us Dangerous"" follows a flower from a dead relative's grave to the desk of an uninterested crush while Bianchi alludes to mental illness and societal persecution. It's like the entire Eels discography distilled into four minutes. But the most obvious turn is instrumental, as the strings that pad out Bianchi's simple, breezy tunes are pulled from the barn rather than the orchestra pit-- yes, the guileless banjo on ""The Truth Hurts So This Should Be Painless"" (okay, maybe some things haven't changed) isn't being played for laughs or ""authenticity,"" and neither is the kazoo that pops up later. While the move to more traditional instrumentation and songwriting was likely a necessary move for Bianchi, it was also an incredibly risky one-- he's very much aware of the limitations of his voice, and on 2003's ""Meet the Pressure"", he likened criticism to asking a blind man if he knows that he can't see. It could just be one of those situations where everything sounds better when you turn it up loud, since the insistent double-tracking lends Bianchi a tart, nasal tone resembling Kevin Barnes kicked out of the theatre troupe or even Isaac Brock. If he's dealing in unfamiliar ground, it's no surprise that Bianchi is seeking clear guidepoints. It's hard not to hear ""The Year in Review"" (as well as ""The Day in Review"") as Bianchi's ""Float On"" moment-- fatalism passing for relative optimism-- even though its descending melody brings up a certain late-period Elliott Smith album (check the title). But in other ways, XOXO still manages a lonesome, crowded sound. Whether it's the sturdy chord progressions, overstuffed lyrics, or just Bianchi's tendency to avoid with melodies with contours his voice can't match, most of XOXO is likeable, if not a little tough to parse. The gut-punch topicality of older songs like ""Sleepy California"" or ""Girl Problem"" is genuinely missed amidst the occasionally redundant wistful observation and the vocal lines that often veer to close to each other (many can draw similarities to the White Stripes' ""We're Going to Be Friends""). Ultimately, in place of a holding pattern comes a new trouble-- Her Space Holiday, in its previous iteration, was divisive enough to be loved and it had an identity: Every one of their previous albums had a couple of duds, but in the vein of Jamie Stewart or Conor Oberst, imperfection was something of a package deal-- the drunken fight that unintentionally gets to the root of the problem. It's nice that Bianchi spends most of XOXO talking himself away from the ledge, but if he's going to stand out in a rootsy twang & twee field that's already bursting at the seams, it's going to take more than the Sarah Palin platter of brand loyalty and exceeding drastically lowered expectations.","Veteran lap-pop artist Marc Bianchi takes a detour here, crafting an unplugged record that finds him moving to more traditional instrumentation and songwriting.

The Lilac Time,Pelle Carlberg,by: Stephen M.

On previous albums he's addressed television coverage of Warren Zevon's death (""Musikbyrån Makes Me Wanna Smoke Crack""), a negative record review (""Go to Hell, Miss Rydell""), and his limited fanbase (""Middleclass Kid""), all with caustic wit, self-deprecating humor, and absurdly catchy melodies that make even his harshest comments go down easy. The Lilac Time, his third solo album, continues this op-ed approach, holding forth on cars, airlines, Facebook, Stockholm, and political correctness. The tunes are still there, but something about the album sticks in your craw: Indie pop's favorite grumpus is starting to sound like Andy Rooney. ""Animal Lovers"" grouses at just what its title suggests: those who love animals but treat people as subhuman. A rhino at the local zoo died, Carlberg recalls, and the citizens mourned the loss, but ""when Grandma died, no one cried."" Everyone has felt this sense of unfairness, but rather than coming across as universal, the song just sounds snippy. ""51,3"", about a disappointing Facebook quiz, and ""Tired of Being PC"", about being well-educated and progressive, fare dismally as well. Carlberg's mock outrage sounds best when it's attached to an equally assertive melody: ""Metal to Metal"", about a lemon that breaks down outside Berlin, contains the album's most insistent hook, which makes the refrain seem like the musings of a truly exasperated man: ""Metal to metal is no good, but stupid to stupid is no better."" Likewise, ""Fly Me to the Moon"" sugarcoats its anti-airline rant (""Cut your costs, but never piss on your passengers"") with handclaps, whistling, and syrupy strings. Carlberg is getting older, which makes him not only grouchier but more nostalgic. As the name-dropping title suggests, The Lilac Time is perhaps most concerned with the passage of time and the rosiness of the past. ""Tonight I'll be a teenager again,"" he sings with Club 8's Karolina Komstedt on the upbeat ""Nicknames"", which sounds both triumphant and a little pathetic. ""1983 (Pelle & Sebastian)"" is a spot-on re-creation of a Boy With the Arab Strap outtake in which Carlberg recounts his misadventures hanging out in the city as a teenager. It even ends with a ""A Space Boy Dream""-style monologue that leavens the nostalgia with a dose of public humiliation. The Lilac Time may not be Carlberg's strongest album, but it shows him at least trying to address the trappings of adulthood, no matter how banal they may be.","Indie pop songwriter offers his third album of nostalgic tunes delivered with caustic wit, self-deprecating humor, and absurdly catchy melodies.

But for the three San Franciscans-cum-Brooklynites in the band Lemonade, it's what you get when music blogs serve a new dance-music subgenre, umpteenth post-punk revival, and hot world-music trend on a weekly basis-- you process the best bits into something practical and satisfying. The six extended tracks on the band's self-titled debut are rife with rhythmic density and intensity, but smartly sequenced into two halves that each follow the peak/valley/peak arc that rock listeners demand of Proper Albums.  Lemonade seem especially aware of this conversion process: Their record vividly replicates that first sensation of losing yourself in a peak-hour, strobe-lit reverie, where the communal act of dancing teeters between liberation and disorientation. Evocative opener ""Big Weekend"" establishes the theme, luring you in with familiar devices: drummer Alex Pasternak lays down a kick-drum thump and cowbell clatter that approximates the polyrhythimic pulse of Liquid Liquid, while a 303 synth riff and frontman Callan Clendenin's Ibiza-evoking lyrics further enhance the 80s flashback. But following a mid-song breakdown, Pasternak's drumming turns more fiercely tribal and Clendenin's voice is refashioned into a stream of distorted and mutated squeals, providing an early indication that Lemonade's definition of dancefloor abandon also includes the bad-trip flipside, further revealed by the industrialized schaffel swing of ""Unreal"". The spastic, devolutionary disco of ""Real Slime"" provides a more explicit affront to ecstasy-induced enlightenment, with Clendenin admonishing his hippy-dippy target to ""scrape the fluoride out of your encrusted third eye."" With their muscular, aggressive approach to dance music, Lemonade operate from a similar base as other percussive post-punk new-schoolers, from party-starting outfits like !!! and Professor Murder to more abrasive acts like Aa and Liars. But the trio strike a singular balance between weird and wired: eight-minute centerpiece ""Nasifon"" finds Clendenin's voice sliding further into indecipherability-- imagine Metal Box-era John Lydon bellowing out Sigur Rós' Hopelandic lyric sheet-- but layers it with Arabic-accented melodies, machine-gunned synths and a pounding 4/4 beat that would go over both in Williamsburg warehouse parties and Dubai super clubs. And if the queasy, grime grind of ""Sunchips"" sputters on about twice as long as it needs to, it makes the arrival of spectacular closer ""Blissout"" all the more rewarding. On an album that's been mostly concerned with the feeling of losing control, ""Blissout"" provides Lemonade with a hard-earned moment clarity: Clendenin's uncharacteristically stoic vocal calmly rides atop a cheery hi-NRG beat and acid-soaked synths, before a twinkling piano refrain and chopped-up vocals announcing the band's name trigger a big-beat blowout, with Clendenin's ecstatic, echo-laden exclamations summoning the break of dawn. As the track fades, it's overcome by a chorus of sampled voices all uttering the same statement: ""we're all having a good time."" Given Clendenin's cryptic, fragmented approach to singing, you can't fault Lemonade for using these dying seconds to state the obvious.","With a muscular, aggressive approach to dance music, Lemonade operate from a similar base as other percussive post-punk new-schoolers, from party-starting outfits like !!! and Professor Murder to more abrasive acts like Aa and Liars.

No Pussyfooting / Evening Star,Fripp & Eno,by: Brian Howe,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/59299ffdea9e61561daa4472/1:1/w_160/9eef780d.JPG,2009-01-09 06:00:01,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12546-no-pussyfooting-evening-star/,IslandIsland,"Brian Eno, Roxy Music's art-schooled keyboard and tech wizard, and Robert Fripp, King Crimson's mostly self-taught guitarist, convened in Eno's home studio in 1972. Both were conceptually inclined: Eno called himself a ""non-musician,"" while Fripp claimed to be tone deaf and rhythmically impaired when he began playing. Both of them would go on to reinvent their chosen tools-- Eno the studio, Fripp the guitar (he would eventually devise his own standard tuning and picking techniques)-- to suit their unique talents and visions. The two LP-length collaborations they recorded in the 70s, now remastered and reissued by DGM, laid the groundwork for each musician's most iconic works. One technique is central to both records: the use of two Revox reel-to-reel tape recorders as a primitive looping system, wherein sounds recorded to the first deck resurfaced unpredictably when the tape passed through the second deck. Eno and Fripp didn't pioneer this technique; Terry Riley, among others, had used it before. But Eno would master it in his Ambient albums, where it became an end unto itself, not a background. As Eno refined the technique for the studio, Fripp refined it for the stage in his ""Frippertronic"" performances, which prefigured the use of looping pedals among arty rock bands today. Even in these two early works-- 1973's No Pussyfooting and 1975's Evening Star-- we can begin to track the process's rapid evolution. On No Pussyfooting (the parentheses that originally enclosed the title are dropped on the reissue), we hear Eno and Fripp discovering the process-- it was the very first thing they recorded together in this vein. The album bursts with a sense of spontaneity. ""The Heavenly Music Corporation"" sequence is raw and rambunctious, resolving in long deep waves of aggression, with Fripp's molten, fluent guitar leads putting his rock prowess on display. The effervescent ""Swastika Girls"" strikes a contrast. In fact, ""The Heavenly Music Corporation"" and ""Swastika Girls"" seem designed as opposites-- the former gooey, deep, and broadly rolling, the latter effervescent, high, and cramped with wiry spirals. Of course, these tracks lack the sophistication of Eno's later ambient work, where pristine clarity became his focus. Clutter and impulsiveness haunt the margins, especially on ""Swastika Girls"", and Fripp's leads seem to stand somewhat apart from Eno's manipulations on ""Heavenly"". But whatever Pussyfooting lacks in subtlety, it compensates for with sheer mojo.* Evening Star* demonstrates how quickly Eno and Fripp evolved-- it's confidently serene where No Pussyfooting was brashly assertive, and bears a closer resemblance to the 2004 Eno/Fripp collaboration The Equatorial Stars. Fripp's guitar is less often recognizable as such; we frequently hear what resembles clouds of bowed strings drifting through each other. When it is recognizable, as on the title track, the guitar phrases seem deeply interwoven with the surrounding sounds rather than roaring over them. The album opens with a quartet of naturalistically themed pieces, evoking water, wind, and sky, before delving down with a six-track sequence called ""An Index of Metals"". Not only did Eno and Fripp hone their technique on Evening Star, they erected a thematic architecture, which was absent from No Pussyfooting and would be crucial to Eno's subsequent work. The only disappointing thing about these reissues is the bonus content. There's none on Evening Star, and No Pussyfooting comes with a second disc of reversed and half-speed mixes. There's an historical precedent for this: Miscuing a tape, John Peel played tracks from No Pussyfooting backwards on his radio show (and it says a lot about this kind of music that only Eno noticed the error), while the slowed-down versions recreate the experience of playing the album, which was originally released on vinyl, at the wrong speed. That's cool, but would have made more sense on a commercial release in 1975. Now that listeners who want to hear music at different speeds can create the effect themselves in a matter of seconds, the bonus disc seems anachronistic. In his review of The Equatorial Stars, Dominique Leone correctly downplayed the idea that anything was invented on these albums. As previously mentioned, the technique that informed them predated Eno and Fripp. And while Eno made great strides in building a theory of ambient music, the basic challenge-- to make music that took an evasive stance toward form and content-- wasn't new; many modernist composers had already been approaching it in a variety of ways. But art always evolves that way, with old ideas recombining into new forms, embodied in but not created by specific individuals. Eno and Fripp invented something more tangible than an abstract cultural movement here: They invented themselves, and a way of thinking about music that was not so much novel as perfectly of the moment, alive to its unique technological and conceptual possibilities. They irrevocably altered the course of art music in the process.",,7.9,
Moenie and Kitchi,Gregory and the Hawk,by: Joshua Klein,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/59299fe85e6ef9596931fe27/1:1/w_160/f5f51e39.jpg,2009-01-08 06:00:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12529-moenie-and-kitchi/,Fat Cat,"The press notes helpfully point out that Meredith Godreau chose the name Gregory and the Hawk to ""avoid her being perceived or pigeonholed as a female singer-songwriter."" Never mind the fact that she is without a doubt female and without a doubt a singer-songwriter, and a ""female singer-songwriter"" in the generic neo-genre sense at that. Not only will no one be fooled by the fake band name, now she's also saddled with a twee moniker that brings to mind children's books and assorted Wes Anderson-isms. The name of Gregory and the Hawk's second album, Moenie and Kitchi, adds images of kittens into the mix, or perhaps Japanese cartoon characters. But no need to complicate things with hypotheticals. At heart Gregory and the Hawk is still singer-songwriter Meredith Godreau, and the disc offers things that might be expected of such a title, such as quiet acoustic guitar and earnestly and innocently cooed vocals. Yet Moenie and Kitchi does have an x-factor working in its favor, and that's producer and multi-instrumentalist Adam Pierce, of Mice Parade fame. Supposedly, many of Godreau's vocals and guitars were recorded in the same take. If they'd stopped there, the album would be pretty dire indeed. Fortunately, Godreau has no qualms with adorning her skeletal songs with a little meat. The loose drums and buzzing strings of ""Oats We Sow"" gives the otherwise off-the-rack track a slight tinge of unpredictability. A similarly just slightly left-of-center approach helps ""Doubtful"" escape a descent into third-rate Kate Bush, especially when the sub-sonic bass rumbles and amorphous guitar kicks in. ""Ghost"" even comes close to actually rocking, and the horns are a nice touch, too. Unfortunately, the songs are awfully ephemeral. Godreau's crystalline voice is remarkable, and it's often mixed high, as if there were any way to miss it. And there's no doubt that she has a way with curiously unresolved melodies. But there's a limitation to her voice all the same, which never wanders too far from the same range or timbre. That leaves a song such as the aptly titled ""Voice Like a Bell"" almost invisibly pretty. It's up to the subtle idiosyncrasies of the production and arrangements-- the swell of ambient noise that ends ""Super Legend"", say, or the percussive electric guitar that propels ""Harmless""-- to coax the disc out of coffee-house purgatory. But it never quite tips the balance.","Producer Adam Pierce of Bubblecore/Mice Parade fame adds his distinctive arrangements to the skeletal songs of Meredith Godreau.

Miniatures,Matthew Robert Cooper,by: Brian Howe,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/59299fe5c0084474cd0bfa28/1:1/w_160/9cbc5f63.jpeg,2009-01-08 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12526-miniatures/,Gaarden,"You don't have to be a new age healer to believe that music is medicinal. I've often found myself putting on a record in order to amplify or counteract a specific feeling. If I'm feeling edgy, John Adams' ""Hallelujah Junction"" can make that edginess feel like something productive, while Gas or Eno can soothe it away. If I'm feeling lost in the day, the piano music of Philip Glass can guide me back on track, while Morton Feldman can help me remember that the track is an illusion. And when I'm feeling sentimental and fragile, Jóhann Jóhannsson or Eluvium can redeem that fragility into something triumphant. The unabashed embrace of sentimentality is crucial to both Jóhannsson and Eluvium's music. Both strive to bypass the brain and go straight for the heart (which, of course, on the compositional end, requires a lot of skill and intelligence). The pleasure they transmit feels effortless-- pure balm reminding us that discord and fracture aren't prerequisites for powerful arrangements. On Miniatures, Matthew Robert Cooper maintains the deep-seated ache that characterizes his music as Eluvium, while pulling back from the opulence of Copia, working in ambient scrimshaw on tiny surfaces. While Eluvium is a professed influence upon Library Tapes, this release at least makes it appear as if the tables have turned, and Cooper is pursuing Library Tapes' vanishing-point solemnity.* Miniatures* is so spare, its compositions so quiet and remote, that it has the feel of a demo tape, which it almost is. According to Cooper, he spent a year writing pieces for orchestra and recording discrete melodies for various instruments. During the process, these sketches took on a life of their own, and he decided to re-record them as individual tracks for an album. As such, Miniatures contains standalone works that, as a whole, gesture toward a phantom symphony-- a symphony, one hopes, that Cooper will eventually write. In the meantime, we can glean the tone of the work through these fragments. A plaintive leitmotif that appears in ""Miniature 1"", a burnished dirge for strings and organ, reappears on ""Miniature 3"", a misty rainbow of drones that implies a sweeping horn theme. Cooper's music as Eluvium is no stranger to musical history. He quotes Philip Glass on Copia's ""Prelude for Time Feelers"". His yearning piano themes descend from Erik Satie, and they pervade Miniatures in force: See the melting declivities of ""Miniature 2"", the Michael Nyman-esque meditations of ""Miniature 4"", and the off-footed steps of ""Miniature 7"", so tiny you can hear the sheet music turning. Sumptuous Romantic-era strings provide the groundwork for many of his intrepid themes, as on the sublimely simple ""Minature 9"". But Cooper's symphonic ambitions occasionally push him even further back: The honeyed harmonic braid of ""Miniature 5"" is like a Baroque-period organ chorale by Bach, a true album highlight. That this relatively modest piece sounds voluble in the context of the album speaks to how Miniatures muffles Cooper's usual audacity. What it lacks in bravado it makes up for with quiet perseverance and buried coherence. But most importantly, it's just good medicine.","Matthew Robert Cooper maintains the deep-seated ache that characterizes his music as Eluvium, offering an album of orchestral and electronic sketches drawn from a yet-to-be-completed symphony.

Akh Issudar,Terakaft,by: Joe Tangari,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bdd7ea9e61561daa77b9/1:1/w_160/33f78202.jpg,2009-01-08 06:00:03,Global,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12525-akh-issudar/,World Village,"Ahk Issudar. ""Milk is survival."" It's the second half of a Tamashek (aka Tuareg) proverb that begins with the phrase Aman Iman, or ""Water is life."" If you've followed global popular music at all in the last few years, you know that the latter is the title of desert rock standard bearers Tinariwen's superb 2007 album. Terakaft's completion of Tinariwen's thought is no accident-- the two bands are closely linked, and several songs on Terakaft's debut album are written by members of Tinariwen. Ahk Issudar does in some ways feel like a continuation of Aman Iman-- the style is similar but even more stripped down, and the songs have that familiar sense of longing, evoking shifting landscapes in wide open spaces. The sound is as basic as possible. The three members all sing and play guitar, and two also play bass. There is no percussion, but one of the guitars typically plays a muted part that provides the illusion of a shaker or small hand drum. The other rhythm guitars tend to hammer away on a pedal tone, often in concert with the bass, which accents the underlying base tone rhythmically, and the lead guitar is cut loose to wander. It's very purposeful wandering, though. The leads soar over the shifting expanse of the rhythm as though navigating by some deeply understood guiding principle. The lyrics-- all sung in Tamashek-- visit now-familiar themes of exile and loneliness, while paying tribute to Tuareg heroes, but there's one very glaring exception in ""Amdagh"", a song dedicated to a French zoo director who is working to save the last giraffes in Niger and the wild sheep of the Adrar Mountains. At first blush, it seems odd for people who are scraping out a living to champion a luxury like conservation, but then two things become clear: One, conservation is really no longer a luxury, and two, these Tamashek bands, in creating a new musical style, are ensuring that their cultural heritage has a vessel to carry it into the future, regardless of what happens to their way of life. In that respect, the zoo keeper is fighting to preserve the character of the desert they call home in much the same way they are-- it's rare that the intersection between cultural preservation and environmental preservation is so clearly elucidated on a record. What separates this album from those made by Terakaft's colleagues is its uniquely ramshackle approach to what is essentially organic psychedelia. Acoustic guitars make a few appearances, and some songs, such as ""Soubhanallah"", have an open, free-flowing character that makes it feel like they simply blew up off the peak of a dune and became pieces of music. The all-acoustic closer offers a different sound, with more independence for each voice and a folky (in the Western sense) arrangement. This genre has reached a point of diversity where terms like ""desert rock"" and ""desert blues"" have become inadequate-- it needs its own name. Akh Issudar, however it's labeled, is another reminder that this corner of the world is producing some of the best and most rewarding music out there.","Founded by former members of desert rock standard bearers Tinariwen, this Tuareg guitar outfit's sound is even more stripped down and elemental while their songs visit now-familiar themes of exile and loneliness.

Easy Come Easy Go,Marianne Faithfull,by: Stephen M. Deusner,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a00113d197565213829b/1:1/w_160/1cf371dc.jpg,2009-01-08 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12548-easy-come-easy-go/,Naïve,"She may not sell as well or enjoy their prominent rock status, but I'd bet there's more concentrated excitement over a new Marianne Faithfull album than any new Rolling Stones release could inspire in even their hardiest fan. There are certainly fewer dashed expectations. Unlike the group that ostensibly ""discovered"" her (those quote marks should be in 72-point font), Faithfull has carved a niche as a gifted and idiosyncratic interpreter embedded in the present but engaged with the past. In lesser hands, her grainy voice-- impossibly dark and knowing-- might sound gothically cheesy, but she gives herslf over to her songs completely while remaining indelibly, recognizably herself. She's the Helen Mirren of rock'n'roll: a dish in the 1960s who has not only aged incredibly well, but wears her age with as much grace as others wear their youth. Like her 1987 album Strange Weather, which cemented that reputation, Easy Come Easy Go is a covers album produced by Hal Willner, and a few of the song titles here might suggest something akin to one of those dreadful boomer standards albums or a pathetic attempt by an older artist to connect with the kids. (A U.S. version will be out in March on Decca Records.) But Faithfull is classier than Rod Stewart or Pat Boone, not just because her voice is more appealing, but primarily because she knows to dig deep into an artist's catalog for inspiration. Everything is a standard, if to no one else but herself. So nothing here, not even the Duke Ellington song, sounds like an obvious choice, nor is anything handled predictably. Bessie Smith's ""Easy Come, Easy Go"" becomes a slow-burn vaudeville, layering clarinets over... well, I don't know what it is, but sounds like either a fuzzed-out bassoon or a fuzzed-out bass piano. The effect is uncanny: an eerie approximation of the past that sounds both real and unreal. There is no guiding conceit to Easy Come Easy Go, no criteria that connects all of Faithfull's sources, which frees her up considerably to find the hidden passages between these disparate songs. Smith and Ellington sit alongside the Decemberists, Neko Case, and Espers, but Faithfull isn't pandering to bloggers and Willner doesn't play Rick Rubin to her Johnny Cash by having her reinterpret modern-rock tunes into novelty. Rather, there are dark themes running through these songs, which evoke different facets of loss and self-destruction. Opening the record, Dolly Parton's ""Down from Dover"" devastates as it recounts a woman's unwanted pregnancy and self-delusion that the father will return. Parton made the narrator's innocence sound immediate, but Faithfull removes herself somewhat from the predicament, her rasp suggesting the passage of time and a life that has gotten no easier. As she sings it, ""Down from Dover"" sounds like  a spiritual twin to the Decemberists' ""The Crane Wife 3"", which unthreads some of the same maternal and spousal conflicts and makes the simple melody sound like a descending brushstroke on a clean canvas. Brian Eno's ""How Many Worlds"" still sounds slight and indifferent, but Randy Newman's ""In Germany Before the War"" could have been written specifically for Faithfull-or at least by Weill. She can't evoke the unbearable sense of loss that the original communicates so easily, but she does conjure her own particularly mournful ambience, as if playing every part (the first-person narrator, the little lost girl) herself. Espers' ""Children of Stone"" is filled with majestic dread that never dissipates over its eight minutes. Her backing band-- including backing vocalist Chan Marshall-- oversell Case's ""Hold On Hold On"", but Faithfull gets the dark self-reckoning just right. In Europe, Naïve is releasing a special edition that includes eight bonus tracks that broaden the scope of the project, if not the depth. Her version of the Black Rebel Motorcycle Club's ""Salvation"" tries too hard to replicate the dense sound of the original, which ultimately sounds a bit detached from her vocals. Faithfull sounds more comfortable with the older tracks, savoring the lilting melodies of Judee Sill's ""The Phoenix"" and the traditional ""The Flandyke Shore"", made popular by Nic Jones. She retains the pomp and drama of Morrissey's ""Dear God Please Help Me"", but her duet with Jarvis Cocker on ""Somewhere"" is sadly underwhelming: Their voices contrast nicely-- hers bold and warm, his whispery and conspiratorial-- but the song suits neither of them particularly well. Faithfull fares better with Antony on Smokey Robinson's ""Ooh Baby Baby"", which stands out from the album proper thanks to its convoluted, shifting arrangement. The song opens with piano glissandos and nightclub vocals before transforming into a girl-group lite-funk vamp. They trade off lead duties, but Faithfull sounds best when she's interjecting ""stronger stronger"" like she's the Antonettes. Throughout its eight minutes, the song stands halfway between the lounge and the dancefloor. It's overlong, extremely gaudy, completely ridiculous, and just wonderful. The song altogether disrupts the album's somberness and glues sequins all over the original, and to her credit, Faithfull attacks it with more spirit than singers half her age could muster. Except maybe Antony.","This covers album finds the 60s legend working with Antony, Jarvis Cocker, and Cat Power and tackling songs by Morrissey, Brian Eno, the Decemberists, Neko Case, and Duke Ellington, among others.

The 4-Track Era Bundle,DJ Shadow,by: Nate Patrin,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a00013d1975652138298/1:1/w_160/1241d3cd.jpg,2009-01-08 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12547-the-4-track-era-bundle/,djshadow.comdjshadow.com,"One of the oddest sonic juxtapositions I heard last year came from the first disc of this box set. Back in the late 1980s and early 90s, DJ Shadow put together a series of hip-hop mixes for Bay Area radio station KMEL, and the megamix that appears on The 4-Track Era Volume 1: Best of the KMEL Mixes opens, after a brief DJ intro, with one of those big booming slick laser-explosion-sound station IDs: ""Bustin' oooout, another slammin' non-stop power mix on 106 point one, KME-L FM, San Francisco Oakland San Jose!"" From that bombastic intro, we go into a murky, vinyl-crackle-drenched, assembled-on-tape collection of regional and national underground hip-hop cuts, some original breaks, and the occasional Steinski-esque dialogue clip. It's almost inconceivable today that someone doing what Shadow did-- and what Shadow does now, for that matter-- would find their way onto a radio venue more mainstream than a college station. But The 4-Track Era Bundle comes from a fascinating germination period for Shadow-- 1990 to 1992-- where he was an aspiring producer in his late teens getting his foot in the door at a time when 95% of hip-hop was still more or less an underground phenomenon. (The other 5% mostly consisted of the Hammerman cartoon and PSAs where ciphers in five-years-dated Run-DMC outfits crossed their arms and rapped ""I'm so-and-so and I'm here to say that buckling up is A-OK"".) Most people who've followed DJ Shadow's career have done so with his Mo Wax output as the starting point; we were told that the man behind grand artistic statements like ""In/Flux"" and Endtroducing..... was steeped in classic hip-hop fundamentals, and we had to take their word for it. Now we have proof-- and this set doesn't just reveal Shadow's origins, it's a great assemblage of traditional, golden-age-era hip hop turned just a bit sideways. The first volume, which includes two of the five mixes Shadow put together for KMEL circa 1991, is the most immediately entertaining, as well as one of the more illuminating looks into Shadow's early identity; at one point there's a brief interview interlude where Shadow downplays his nascent production work (""hopefully, y'know, a little bit further in the future that'll be my career or whatever"") and emphasizes his work as a DJ and mix creator. Considering how many of his career highlights come from his mixes, whether collaborating with Cut Chemist (Brainfreeze; Product Placement; The Hard Sell) or going solo (Diminishing Returns; Funky Skunk), it's probably unsurprising how well-paced and unique these early examples of his technique are, even from a 19 year-old. In the first six minutes of the first mix alone, we get a rowdy g-funk makeover of Kool G Rap & DJ Polo's ""Money in the Bank"", a tweak of Brand Nubian's ""Slow Down"" that adds some severe low-end boost to the track's Edie Brickell-derived beat, and a sharply-cut, scratch-filled rendition of De La Soul's ""Afro Connections at a Hi 5 (In the Eyes of the Hoodlum)"" that subtly ups the pitch and tempo and transforms the track from a plodding spoof of mean-mug hardness into a lively hands-up anthem. The two mixes still focus on what was hot in '91-- the second one prominently features the Geto Boys' ""Mind Playing Tricks on Me"", Cypress Hill's ""How I Could Just Kill a Man"", and Black Sheep's ""Flavor of the Month""-- but the familiarity is tempered by a few period obscurities (J.V.C. F.O.R.C.E.'s ""A Musical Sample""; Downtown Science's ""Radioactive""), a superb mixing job and the restless, unpredictable creativity of a DJ who was just beginning to pull out all the stops to define his own persona. There's also some valuable stuff in the other two volumes-- one dedicated to non-radio megamixes and a few unreleased remixes, the other comprised of some of Shadow's earliest work, and all of it previously unreleased aside from one track that came out on a difficult-to-find NME freebie cassette. It's here where you get a clearer picture of the artist Shadow would become as a producer-- as well as how severely he transformed between 1992 and 1996. Volume 2's remixes feature the audacious experimentation of an up-and-coming beat constructor who suddenly realizes he's gotten good at what he does. He applies some breakbeat ADD to Eric B. & Rakim's ""Let the Rhythm Hit 'Em"", where the beat changes what seems like every 20 seconds but never falters. The Jungle Brothers' ""Jimbrowski"" gains a stouter drum break, a catchy piano/organ hook and a full-fledged reggae interlude to back up the original's extended ""dreadlock"" conversation. And his reworking of 3rd Bass' ""Wordz of Wisdom"" has the original's Gary Wright break hyperextended, dropping out a few times so Shadow can push the drum track within inches of its life; the damn thing's eight minutes long, and it's amazing. And while there's nothing quite as transformative or outlandish on Volume 3's collection of early originals, there's still some impressive moments once you take into account that everything was assembled on turntables and that titular 4-Track machine-- no samplers, no computers. Occasionally the results are a little hinky-- the beats in ""DJ Shadow's Theme (Original Version)"" feel a little loose and slippery, while ""Track the Groove"" sounds like a bunch of over-familiar Ultimate Breaks & Beats fodder mixed together-- but hearing the ""You Can Make it if You Try"" break diced up and smothered in rapidfire scratches on ""The Source Is Serious Business"" or the Zep/Hendrix/Doors mainstays of classic rock radio juggled around in ""Rock Lesson"" provides a good idea of where he was headed. And fans of what little vintage Shadow there was to hear before Mo Wax signed him should be geeked to find both an alternative mix of his manic 1991 Steinski homage ""Lesson 4"" and a long-lost, old school funk-heavy all-45 ""Lesson 5"" which predated the similar M.O. of Brainfreeze by a good seven or eight years. Now here's the cruel part: It's extremely difficult to buy this box set. You could've snagged the individual components a year or two ago, since each volume was included as a throw-in bonus with a t-shirt purchase on DJ Shadow's web store, but as of this writing only Volume 3 is still in print and available. And the box itself-- produced in a limited edition of 200, with another immaculately-constructed KMEL mix thrown in as a fourth-disc bonus-- is already going for stupid money on eBay and Craigslist. It's a bit ironic, now that we finally have officially-released audio documentation of Shadow's formative years, that many fans will probably have to resort to some kind of pirate skullduggery just to hear it. So back to the underground it goes.","The man behind statements like ""In/Flux"" and Endtroducing..... proves that he was steeped in classic hip-hop fundamentals.

Punkgasm,Don Caballero,by: Brian Howe,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/59299fe613d197565213825a/1:1/w_160/577988df.jpg,2009-01-07 06:00:05,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12527-punkgasm/,Relapse,"I'll never forget the first time I saw Don Cab. It was at North Carolina's Cat's Cradle, just before one of their many break-ups, in the year 2000. They were touring as a trio (drummer Damon Che, guitarist Ian Williams, and bassist Eric Emm) supporting American Don. I was mesmerized; it seemed impossible that so much sound was coming from three people. Williams and Emm used looping pedals to build swaying house-of-cards melodies. Che's cubist rhythms were utterly enveloping. In the moribund days of Chicago math-rock, Don Cab reviled and revivified the genre at the same time. On the other hand, I've all but forgotten the second time I saw Don Cab. It must have been between 2003 and 2006, when Che had reformed the band with all new members. Math-rock was definitively obsolete, and Don Cab could neither escape it nor rejuvenate it. Their careening riffs and multi-jointed meters sounded directionless and uninspired. At the time, I thought maybe I'd changed. Or maybe it was the absence of those lush, swelling loops. All of that was probably true, but their latest album, Punkgasm, makes me think there was more to it. American Don was so great because it didn't thrive on complexity alone. What awed me about that show, as much as intricacy, was the intense emotion that suffused it. The personal tension between Che and Williams created a sense of massive forces at odds. Punkgasm (which features Che, bassist Jason Jouver, and guitarist Gene Doyle) still bears the group's superficial hallmarks-- virtuosic playing, inventive drumming evocative of jazz, and absurdist songs titles like ""The Irrespective Dick Area"" and ""Why Is the Couch Always Wet?"". Yet it has a hollow ring. Absent the alchemy between Che and his contentious collaborator Williams, Punkgasm sounds like prime Don Cab the way that Nescafé tastes like coffee. A few tracks feature inconsequential vocals from Che and Doyle, and the title track, a punky blast, finds Che on guitar and Doyle on drums. But for the most part, this is an instrumental rock album, and diehard fans of the genre-- people who read gear magazines and have a high regard for technically proficient pastiche-- will find plenty to enjoy. ""Loudest Shop Vac in the World"" seamlessly integrates sections of taut funk, gleaming post-rock, and blistering metal. Unfortunately, metal is Don Cab's least interesting mode, and it threatens to overtake the album entirely. ""Bulk Eye"" starts off promisingly, unfurling a menacing lead, but soon devolves into bludgeoning riffage; many other tracks follow suit. The frustrating part is that you can hear snatches of inspiration getting swallowed up by the guitar heroics: The chiming home stretch of ""Awe Man That's Jive Skip"" sounds like a bit of Steve Reich dropped into a Slint song, and the languid strains of ""Who's a Puppy Cat"" provide a welcome respite from excessive gnarliness. Even ""Shit Kids Galore"", a deceptively simple one-minute drum solo, is more interesting than fleshed-out songs like ""Pour You Into the Rug"", a squealing anthem that sounds lifted from Tortoise's Standards. People who expect more than expertise and bombast from Don Cab will have to either cling to these moments of idiosyncrasy and vision, or turn back to American Don, when Che had collaborators who exasperated and inspired him in equal measure.","Virtuosic playing, inventive drumming evocative of jazz, and absurdist songs titles like ""The Irrespective Dick Area"" are all here, but Don Cab still feels a long way from their turn-of-the-millenium peak.

Fire on Corridor X,All the Saints,by: Stuart Berman,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/59299fed5e6ef9596931fe35/1:1/w_160/b77aca75.jpg,2009-01-07 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12533-fire-on-corridor-x/,Killer Pimp,"For two subgenres built upon a common ideal-- burying classic-rock tunefulness underneath fuzzbox-stomped guitar squall-- grunge and shoegaze experienced markedly different fates in the early 1990s. While the former conquered the magazine covers and fashion runways of America, the latter saw its most visible adherents either fade into oblivion (My Bloody Valentine) or make transitions into Britpop (Ride, Swervedriver) without fully transcending cult status. But then, when you consider what grunge ultimately wrought-- just tune into any modern-rock radio station for the sorry evidence-- it's hard to say it fared any better in the long run. So you can forgive Atlanta trio All the Saints (never has a ""the"" played such an important distinguishing function in a band's name) for wanting to turn back the clock to 1990, and imagine an alternate history where grunge and shoegazer rock stayed underground, left to fester in a thick psychedelic sludge. But All the Saints are an early-90s-throwback band experimenting with a contemporary business model: their debut album, Fire on Corridor X, was given a wide release last November by Touch & Go in vinyl and mp3 formats only, before the label issued a CD run; however, the album first surfaced in early 2008 through Boston-based indie Killer Pimp, the same imprint that introduced us to A Place to Bury Strangers. Like that band, All the Saints strive for sensory obliteration through effects-pedal abuse, but where APTBS opt for strobe-lit acceleration and car-crash cacophony, All the Saints stew in a slow-motion magma and brace themselves for the inevitable eruptions. Fire on Corridor X is certainly heavy, but it refuses to rock out in the obvious, cathartic sense. The ominously tranquil opening instrumental ""Shadow, Shadow"" and steamrolling surge ""Sheffield"" establish the album's pattern of calm/calamity early on, as bassist Titus Brown and drummer Jim Crook set the patient pace with lumbering, choppy grooves that rarely waver through the course of the album; add guitarist Matt Lambert's distant vocals and vaguely shamanistic proclamations (""give all your problems to me,"" ""do as I say"") and the result is not unlike the heady, early excursions of Smashing Pumpkins or The Verve, minus the latent pop-star aspirations. What All the Saints lack in rhythmic variation, they make up for with absorbing atmosphere-- their sound truly is subterranean, a dimly lit, cavernous rumble that gets more suffocating as the album progresses. The album's lone folk-song reprieve, ""Leeds"", actually further emphasizes this quality: a sprightly piano-tapped fade-out hints at levity, only for the chords to mutate and melt away just before the fiery title track kicks in. With so much tension and little release, it's no surprise that, despite their shared hometown, All the Saints exist outside of the communal Deerhunter/Black Lips nexus that's come to define contemporary Atlanta indie-rock-- like their grunge-gazer forbears, All the Saints believe misanthropy makes for the best company.","Atlanta's All the Saints revive the turn-of-the-90s days when grunge and shoegaze were still vibrant underground sounds.

She's described the clueless or cruel men in her life with such humor and heartbreak that her persona as a harried or wronged woman often seems at odds with her headstrong performances and pointed songwriting. Still, it's odd to think of her recording an album with her husband, odder that such an endeavor wouldn't be contentious, and oddest that her romantic and musical partner would be Wreckless Eric, the Stiff Records artist best known for his sweetly oddball hits ""The Whole Wide World"" and ""Take the Cash (K.A.S.H.)"". The couple made the matter-of-factly titled Wreckless Eric & Amy Rigby at their home in France, performing, recording, and producing everything themselves. Amy gets more songwriting credits, but the music skews toward Eric's fuzzy-edged pop. Taken as a whole, the album sounds surprisingly balanced between the two-- marital give-and-take manifest in music. It's not lo-fi (the distortion on ""First Mate Rigby"" comes through clearly), but these songs do sound homemade. That static-riddled spiritedness highlights their individual quirks as well as the easy chemistry between the pair. They trade off vocals and gender roles on ""First Mate Rigby"", chuckle at the vagaries of the music biz on the stand-out ""Round"", and get bitterly wistful on ""Another Drive-In Saturday"". Opener ""Here Comes My Ship"" sets Eric's warbly vocals against what sounds like a keyboard preset beat, then gradually builds to her spoken-word bridge and their casual harmonizing. Eric's simple, curious organ line motors through ""Astrovan"", Amy's surprisingly touching eulogy to a dependable tour van. ""You worked so I could play,"" she sings, before revealing its untimely end: ""They left you across town/ I cried the day you were found."" At times that homemade quality gives Eric Rigby a tossed-off feel, as if it's only a rough draft for something more complete. The filter on Amy's vocals makes her sound distant on the waitress' lament ""A Taste of the Keys"", which isn't helped by the lengthy weather forecast sample that begins and ends the song. The album lacks the gravity and cohesion of their best solo material, but not necessarily the humor. Rigby's ""Men in Sandals"" wonders how Hank Williams' music would have sounded if he'd worn Birks instead of boots, then counsels, ""You can't kick ass in Tevas."" Toward the end of the album, ""Please Be Nice to Her"" sounds like a valedictory, a farewell to an old self, and their cover of Johnny Cash's ""I Still Miss Someone"" sounds too harmonious to convey the song's deep, dark yearning. Whether Wreckless Amy represents a one-off collaboration or the start of an ongoing project for both musicians remains to be seen, but they sound pretty happy together.","Wreckless Eric, known for a few early new wave hits on the Stiff label, teams with his wife, singer-songwriter Amy Rigby, for an album of quirky, homemade pop.

Slumdog Millionaire OST,Various Artists,by: Joshua Klein,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/59299ff713d1975652138280/1:1/w_160/90a1ab92.jpg,2009-01-07 06:00:02,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12541-slumdog-millionaire-ost/,N.E.E.T.,"Danny Boyle's Slumdog Millionaire begins, more or less, as the director's breakthrough Trainspotting had done-- a cops-and-criminals chase, only with pre-adolescents in slums of Mumbai replacing the Edinburgh twentysomethings of Trainspotting. Slumdog Millionaire ends-- and this gives nothing away-- with an elaborately choreographed Bollywood dance routine filmed in Mumbai's Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus train platform. The sequence, vibrantly scored by hugely successful modern Indian film legend A.R. Rahman, serves as a reminder, as if one was necessary, that what came before it was fantasy. Despite attempts to ascribe it sociological significance*, Slumdog Millionaire* is escapist fare that has little bearing on the complicated and cruel world we live in. Which is not to denigrate the thoroughly entertaining film's value as a movie. Boyle's journeyman tendencies have brought him to some fascinating places, from the surface of the sun in Sunshine to the deserted corridors of zombie-infested England in 28 Days Later, and the settings of Slumdog Millionaire are no less entrancing, enhanced as usual by Boyle's knack for matching his striking visuals with well-chosen music. M.I.A. was an obvious pick for this meeting of Boyle's sensibilities and the hardscrabble realities of India's most bustling modern metropolis. It took Pineapple Express to help make M.I.A.'s ""Paper Planes"" an unlikely hit, but that song couldn't be better suited for Slumdog Millionaire if Maya Arulpragasam had intentionally composed it for Boyle's use. On screen, the montage-a-rific track (as well as the DFA remix, which is also featured) perfectly complements both the narrative (tenacious street urchins fighting their way out of Mumbai's underclass) and images (heat-soaked slums, trash-strewn streets, and Bombay's vibrant mid-90s rebirth as Mumbai). Needless to say, Rahman couldn't resist roping M.I.A. in once again as a cameo to enhance his cue ""O... Saya."" With the exception of those tracks and Sonu Nigam's cyber-pop ""Aaj Ki Raat""-- recycled from a Bollywood thriller-- the rest of the Slumdog Millionaire soundtrack consists of Rahman's evocative score, which meshes pounding technoid percussive-heavy pieces (such as ""Riots"" or ""Mausam And Escape"") and slightly less forceful cues (such as ""Ringa Ringa""), some of which seem designed to bring to mind specific moments in the film, some to evoke more general emotions. In fact, Rahman has said that one of the instructions given to him by Boyle was to avoid sentiment, and indeed most of the score (save the mawkish and manipulative ballad ""Dreams on Fire"") ebbs and flows free from the usual soaring Hollywood approach. Some results are deliciously weird, too, such as the stuttering, ""Barber of Seville""-quoting ""Liquid Dance"" or ""Gangsta Blues"", which features Indian MC BlaaZe and sounds a little like an Indian take on Timbaland's take on India. All these tracks are steps along the way to the show-stopping ""Jai Ho"", the film's concluding dance sequence, where Boyle gets to embrace his inner Bollywood and Rahman gets to a compose a track meant to convey little more than pure danceable joy so that the film's stars can get down during the final credits. The sequence marks the film's most triumphant moment and serves a similar purpose punctuating the soundtrack, but having the rest of these tracks in one place serves as a useful reminder of the fast-paced movie's fleeting thrills and vibrant flights of fancy.","The smash Mumbai-set Danny Boyle film is propelled as much by its soundtrack as it is by its fantasy plot, as demonstrated by A.R. Rahman's propulsive M.I.A.-assisted score.

Diplo & Benzi Present: Fear & Loathing in Hunts Vegas,Paper Route Gangstaz,by: Tom Breihan,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/59299ffbea9e61561daa446e/1:1/w_160/c616c2b6.jpg,2009-01-07 06:00:01,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12545-diplo-benzi-present-fear-loathing-in-hunts-vegas/,Paper Route EMPIRE,"The Paper Route Gangstaz are a group of rappers based in a single Southern city, centered around a production unit with a completely distinct sound. We've seen this before from Atlanta's Dungeon Family and New Orleans' No Limit Army and Cash Money Millionaires-- fully formed crews that wound up dominating the late-90s commercial rap landscape. Except this time the city is the total rap backwater of Huntsville, Alabama, and the production unit is the Block Beataz, whose bloopy nodded-out synth-boom tracks are way druggier and slower than anything currently on ""106 & Park"". The closest the Paper Route crew have come to impacting mainstream rap was when Rich Boy spit a couple of verses over Jackie Chain and Jhi-Ali's ""Rollin'"" on his Bigger Than the Mayor mixtape. So the Paper Route Gangstaz are something like what the Cash Money Millionaires might've been if they had barely any hope of or interest in actually becoming millionaires. Even given their nonexistent Q rating, it's a bit weird to see the Paper Route guys hooking up with hipster-DJ kingpins Diplo and Benzi for this mixtape. Even post-""Paper Planes"", these guys don't exactly have a rep for making rap-radio stars, and Paper Route CEO Dawgy Baggz might've wanted to ask some Dipset underling about the long-term loyalty of the clubby hipster crowd. As the rap blogger Noz wrote about this mixtape, the Paper Route guys are, in a way, doing it backwards, reaching for that hipster-kid recognition before they've solidified a serious regional base. And given that the Block Beataz' hallucinatory production is the label's main selling point, it doesn't make a whole lot of sense for them to introduce themselves to the world on a mixtape jammed with remixes from Diplo and friends. But Diplo gets it. His remixes can't quite approximate the Block Beataz' dizzy swell, but they come close. His beats here flutter and breathe, and if he does lean a bit hard on familiar fish-out-of-water samples (Underworld's ""Born Slippy on Blaqstarr's Paper Route collab ""Stuntastic"", for one), he has precedent; the Block Beataz already flipped Weezer's ""Say It Ain't So"" for X.O.'s ""Grind Baby"". And Emnyd's remix of the posse-cut ""Woodgrain"" is just a great track, a cheeseball-house bouncing-ball keyboard drowning in oceans of bass. As dubious as the concept might be, Diplo and his associates stay completely within the Paper Route aesthetic wheelhouse, and their tracks make good introductions to the sound. But the original Block Beataz tracks are the real reason to seek the tape out. These guys have one basic trick: taking the recent wave of Euro-club silliness that's taken over pop-rap in the past couple of years (think Lil Wayne's ""Lollipop"" or Flo Rida's ""Low"") and slowing it down to the point where these tracks would just never work as ringtones. Their beat for B.O.S.S.'s ""Naturalz Pt. 2"" is a great example: a plinky electric piano slathered with reverb, with haunted synths and trunk-rattle drums layered underneath. Every time another rapper jumps on the track, another element appears: a disco handclap, a jittery hi-hat, a sly little bass riff. And so the track constantly contorts and dissipates and resolves itself; it's damn near spellbinding. Other tracks are just as complicatedly pretty. ""Travelin"" undercuts its mournful R&B vocal and phased-out cowbells with some truly candy quiet-storm keyboard work. The spastic turntable scratches on ""Shotz"" stay deep in the mix, never overwhelming its minimal violin loop. And on ""Grind Baby"", that Weezer sample shares space with a whining G-funk organ and gigantic drums. For the most part, the rappers on Paper Route are almost beside the point; they're there to sell these beats, nothing more. Thankfully, that's something they know how to do, turning up the intensity when it's warranted and sinking deep into the track the rest of the time. A few voices jump out (Jhi-Ali's marble-mouthed helium squeak in particular), but none dominate. Everyone sticks with tried-and-true Southern-rap topics (sex, drugs, money, cars) and basically stays out of the way. One big exception, though: Jhi-Ali's ""Alabama"", where the Block Beataz give Sam Cooke's ""A Change Is Gonna Come"" the chipmunk-soul treatment while the rappers give a commendably complicated homestate-pride anthem, Jhi-Ali mentioning lynchings in the same breathe as he points out that Alabama backward sort of almost spells I'm a balla. A few more tracks like that and these guys might not need Diplo's help to break out of Huntsville.","The Paper Route Gangstaz-- Huntsville, Ala.'s answer to No Limit, Cash Money, or the Dungeon Family-- hook up with hipster-DJ kingpins Diplo and Benzi for a mixtape that turns out to best highlight the crew rather than the producers.

Curtain Speech EP,DM Stith,by: Stephen M. Deusner,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/59299ff1ea9e61561daa4459/1:1/w_160/0743c9d5.jpg,2009-01-06 06:00:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12536-curtain-speech-ep/,Asthmatic Kitty,"""Around the Lion Legs"", the first track off DM Stith's debut EP, contains an intriguing morsel of artist bio. ""You asked me why all these years, all these years I've held everything from you,"" he sings over a slicing acoustic guitar line and quiet bursts of staticky snare rolls. That line is crucial: A graphic designer pursuing a graduate degree, the Rochester native has been writing songs all of his life. But due to what his real artist bio describes as a ""harrowing performance of Phantom of the Opera at a school assembly"" (I submit that all such performances are harrowing), he has been reluctant to release his work, much less publicize it. Aside from a handful of tracks here and there within the past year or so (including one on Help Me to Sing, which accompanied the soundtrack to Awake, My Soul: The Story of the Sacred Harp), the Curtain Speech EP is his first real release, serving as both a preview of his 2009 full-length and his first opportunity to make a real statement. He doesn't waste time: ""Around the Lion Legs"" crescendos to a swooning finale, on which he and a choir sing ""These things cannot be taken back/ I know know."" Stith doesn't just release material, the song suggests. He relinquishes it. That Sufjan Stevens and My Brightest Diamond's Shara Worden both sing back-up only hammers that point home. Suf and Shara are there for a couple of reasons: First, they're his labelmates at Asthmatic Kitty, and second, he played on past My Brightest Diamond albums and even contributed to the packaging design. The string quartet Osso, also new to Asthmatic Kitty, appears on one track, and Rafter plays bass and cymbals. Perhaps not entirely comfortable with this endeavor, Stith gets by with a little help from his friends. If he's worried about issues of ownership, authorial intent, and mass production, I can't really help him there. But if it's a simple case of stage fright, he should relax a bit. Curtain Speech reveals a new artist with an already highly developed compositional and vocal style. His songs move organically and patiently, building in unexpected-- but in retrospect, inevitable-- directions, and he carefully molds his vocals into arcs, hiccups, sighs, and coos, which individually have as much impact as his words. Even so, Curtain Speech makes clear that his approach demands a longer form than the EP. Of the five songs here, two are atmosphere-establishing instrumentals, one is a short vocal doodle, and only two feel fully fleshed out. Stith plays piano on the instrumental title track, banging out a single chord with varying tempo and recalling Philip Glass in the process. As an interstitial on a longer player, the ethereal, wordless harmonies might add more to the overall ambience, but on an EP, the song is a wobbly support pole. ""Hoarse Sorrows and the Whole Blind Earth..."" is likewise lyric-less, but its instrumentation proves as grandiose as its ridiculous title, barely redeemed by its whistled melody. ""Around the Lion Legs"" and ""Just Once"" sound much more purposeful, and not merely because they are anchored to words. The former is the stand-out track here, Stith at his most musically assertive and lyrically self-questioning, and ""Just Once"" is, well, a bit exasperating. This seven-minute centerpiece begins quietly, with Osso plucking out a subdued theme and Stith singing softly, as if to make you lean in to hear. The tempo remains steady, collecting instruments in its flow: handclaps, bowed strings, insectoid buzzing, curlicues of clarinet. Midway though, however, the song explodes into a loud second act that doesn't expand on this subdued palette of sounds, but simply amplifies them. Garish and unnecessary, this section leavens rather than intensifies the song's careful unease. Curtain Speech ends with ""Abraham's Song (Firebird)"", the collection's sparsest track. It's just Stith and an acoustic guitar, but it concisely demonstrates the moodiness of his vocals and the fluidity of his melodies. This EP may stumble, but it does exactly what it's supposed to do: It makes you want to hear even more from this curious talent.","The debut EP from this Brooklynite features contributions from Asthmatic Kitty labelmates Sufjan Stevens, Shara Worden, and Rafter.

The Living and the Dead,Jolie Holland,by: Mike McGonigal,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/59299fe713d197565213825d/1:1/w_160/a12f922c.jpg,2009-01-06 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12528-the-living-and-the-dead/,Anti-,"From the album's very opening-- with its unexpected and wholly sweet, McGuinn-ish twelve string guitar lines kicking in 20 seconds into the thing-- Jolie Holland's fourth album packs a full and commanding wallop. It's her strongest effort yet, a mini-manifesto on how to weld varied American sounds together and also fucking rock at the same time. This is the record to buy for your dad for his birthday, and then burn for yourself afterwards (hey, he already likes Sheryl Crow and Willie Nelson). The 32-year-old Holland has worked very hard to get here. She's been this close to the cohesive greatness on display here a number of times. She helped to form the Be Good Tanyas a decade or so ago but left once it became clear that they had a more narrow (and more treacly) idea of what folk music is, just as they started to hit the top of the middle of the road. Holland's 2003 debut Catalpa, initially self-released and later put out on Anti-, had a pleasant living room aura and 27 years of great songs; it's easily among the best folk records of the last decade. Her two subsequent albums simultaneously embraced and rejected the idea of ""folk,"" with varying results. Escondida, from 2004, had great songs and excellent players, but the arrangements were self-consciously old-timey, veering a touch too close to jazz-folk hokum. And on 2006's Springtime Can Kill You, it felt like there were too many ideas competing with each other. Thanks in part to the able production work of Shahzad Ismaily, the problems of the past two records are a distant memory. There's a cohesiveness to this record that's stunning when one considers just how eclectic it is. ""Love Henry"" combines gently plucked trad guitar styles, slightly out-there guitar playing, and what's either a whistle or a singing saw, together with a dash of ethereal ambient whatsis behind a doubled vocal that intentionally sounds like it's coming from a big standalone tube radio. To do that shit in 2008 and not sound pretentious and cloying and ""now playing at Starbucks"" is a small miracle. The swamp cooler ""Fox in Its Hole"" has elements that might remind the listener of Tom Waits circa Swordfishtrombones, but this is only apparent if you think too much about it. M. Ward plays guitar on a few songs, alongside Holland herself and the ever-able Marc Ribot. In ""Mexico City"" Holland intones, ""I think about you Jack, watching the TV and drinking booze, shame on you."" I imagine she's singing to Jack Kerouac, who published the book-length poem Mexico City Blues in 1959. If so, Holland should cut this sort of thing out. She's always spoken to ghosts in her music-- or at least says nice things about them. One of her best songs namechecks Isabelle Eberhardt and William S. Burroughs, while on another she sings ""nobody plays guitar like Blind Willie McTell."" Such dues-paying and earnest homage-making is charming from a brand-new artist and judicious from an elder one. But for an artist in the midst of her career, it feels a bit like a crutch. Still, a few poorly chosen lyrics aren't much to complain about. I keep coming back to Holland's Texas phrasing, in which she stretches out the simplest words into more syllables than there are in the ingredients listed on the side of a soda can. And as appealing as that can sound, Holland only sings like that when the material calls for it. She's never been as in control of her voice, an incredible instrument that is as strong as it is attractive. And on The Living and the Dead, it's found just the right setting.","With guitar contributions from M. Ward and Marc Ribot, the fourth album from this Texas-born, New York-based singer-songwriter is both her most cohesive and most eclectic.

Live in London and Paris,Otis Redding,by: Stephen M. Deusner,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/59299fea5e6ef9596931fe2e/1:1/w_160/b15725ce.jpg,2009-01-06 06:00:03,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12531-live-in-london-and-paris/,Stax,"Otis Redding's Live in London and Paris is a largely redundant, highly repetitive, for-fans-only release of two 1967 concerts drawn from almost identical setlists. But this characterization misses the point, because Redding's music-- in its constantly evolving urgency, abandon, and complexity-- invites even the casual listener to become obsessive. To listen to his live performances is to give in to the urge to compare them, argue over them, parse their differences. One of the most dynamic singers ever to put his stamp on the pop charts, Redding consistently emphasized song over performance, which means each take is singular and unrepeatable. Live in London and Paris features especially remarkable stagings from the Stax Records' infamous 1967 European package tour, and captures Redding at the full height of his powers as a showman. So what if the two strong live albums still in print-- 67's Live in Europe, which overlaps with London and Paris, and 68's In Person at the Whisky a Go Go-- render this new collection essentially inessential? Redding's superlative stage presence ought to appeal to all listeners, whether they've studiously researched the making of Otis Blue: Otis Redding Sings Soul or just groove to ""(Sittin' on) The Dock of the Bay"" whenever it's on the oldies station. Regardless of the repetitive nature of Live in London and Paris-- in fact, because of it-- leaning close to listen for each staging's distinctive qualities can be a rewarding experience. Introductions
At London's Finsbury Park Astoria and four days later at the Olympia Theatre in Paris, Emperor Rosko rouses the crowd by having them spell out Redding's name. One English fan, sitting suspiciously close to Tom Dowd's recording equipment, can be heard screaming out the letters of Doris Troy's name; Roger Armstrong's liner notes suggest it signals his disapproval of this new wave of R&B that Redding represents. The French are far better spellers, and Rosko declares them ""groovy, baby, groovy."" Both intros seem like relics of the period, but they show just how well his music has aged. There is no dust on these songs. ""Respect""
Redding had some spelling of his own to do on this tour, namely R-E-S-P-E-C-T. Better known today as a hit for Aretha Franklin, his ""Respect"" makes an especially apt opener, its urgent tempo and pleading lyrics riling up the crowd. In London, the song sounds reckless as Redding leads the band at double time. In fact, ""Respect"" almost gets away from him: Halfway through he botches a cue but quickly recovers. The Paris performance dials the tempo down a bit, amps up the Mar-Keys' horns, and spotlights Donald ""Duck"" Dunn's elastic bassline. ""My Girl""
Redding's first European hit was his cover of the Temptations' chart smash ""My Girl"". In both venues the song retains its famous three-note bass theme and loping tempo, but the M.G.s transfer that bassline to Steve Cropper's guitar, which adds a lush backdrop for Redding's earthy vocals. In Paris, where ""My Girl"" was Redding's fourth song of the night instead of his second, Cropper and Dunn double up on that ascending melody so that it provides a more emphatic commentary on Redding's delivery. Here the differences in the technical recordings become clear: The London show fuzzes around the edges, whereas the Paris set sounds much crisper-- you can hear every thrum of Booker T.'s organ and every click of Al Jackson, Sr.'s drumstick against the snare rim. ""Shake""
In both shows, ""My Girl"" leads abruptly into the faster ""Shake"", originally by Sam Cooke but also covered on Otis Blue. The band knows how well the transition works: Those horn blasts, punctuated by Cropper's guitar, herald a new song at a new tempo, leaving the audience with barely enough time to catch their breaths. In London, it's the band's finest, tightest moment, as every instrument-- even the audience's clapping and shouts-- clicks into place to emphasize that jumpy groove. In Paris, it's even better, with Jackson's drum fills rolling in and out of the chorus and Redding involving the audience even more: ""Say it with a little bit of soul!"" ""Shake!"" ""Say it with a little bit of feeling!"" ""Shake!"" ""Day Tripper""
In London ""Shake"" is followed by ""Day Tripper"", an effective one-two punch. Redding's cover essentially finishes what the Beatles started: It syncopates the rhythms, revs up the tempo, and trips out the melody, making the original sound like a rough sketch. In Paris, however, Redding and the band move ""Day Tripper"" to near the end of the show so that it leads into closer ""Try a Little Tenderness"". Booker T.'s organ is an airplane landing, the Mar-Keys' horn stabs sound like sparks of fire, and Redding elaborates on the lyrics, picking a phrase and repeating it demonstratively: ""Gottagottagottagottagotta! You gotta love me when I want it, baby!"" ""Fa-Fa-Fa-Fa-Fa (Sad Song)""
""Here's a song I love to sing, and I want you to help me sing it along together,"" Redding says in London by means of introducing ""Fa-Fa-Fa-Fa-Fa (Sad Song)"", and despite its mournful horn preface, it's not really a sad song, but rather a song about sad songs. He actually has to teach the London audience how to do a call and response, drawing them out a bit to sing ""Sock it to me, baby!"" and ""Wang dang doodle"" back to him. In Paris, the crowd sings and claps along with no prompting, and that, more than Redding's insistent performance, puts the song over. ""(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction""
Of course the London crowd goes nuts for this one. The Rolling Stones were hometown boys, and Redding had covered that group's signature hit on Otis Blue, which was his first hit album in England. Jackson's drums give the song its headlong momentum, and the band breaks it down for Redding to explore the improvisational potential of the syllables ""-faction."" Even though it comes earlier in the Paris show, Redding still sounds like he's feeding off the French audience's enthusiasm, throwing himself into the song completely. It's one of his most commanding performances on this disc, although the longer version from In Person at the Whisky a Go Go proves superior, if only for the call and response with the band and the quickening tempo on the climax. ""Try a Little Tenderness""
More than any other pair of tracks, these two versions of ""Try a Little Tenderness""-- closing both shows-- sound more or less identical, right down to Emperor Rosko calling Redding out for multiple encores. The big push on the London performance sounds a bit shaky, but the band clicks into place soon enough. In Paris, it's simply more efficient, and his encores-- repeating that final push-- are messy but genuinely moving. That leaves three tracks from Paris that weren't played in London, where a curfew ensured a shorter show: ""I Can't Turn You Loose"" maintains the energy and pace of ""Respect"" and includes the album's best breakdown; ""I've Been Loving You Too Long"" finds an ideal balance between gruff and tender; and later in the show, ""These Arms of Mine"" sounds as if Redding were writing the song as he goes. The inclusion of these tracks not only emphasizes the ebb and flow between fast and slow songs, with the intensity never waning, but also suggests that the Paris show could have been released on its own. That would have made a stronger, if shorter, release, rather than a minor reissue from a major artist. But if you've read this far, you probably ought to pick it up anyway.","Culled from two 1967 performances drawing on almost identical setlists, Live in London and Paris captures Redding at the full height of his powers as a showman, inviting even the casual fan to lean close to listen for each staging's distinctive qualities.

Though their four studio albums have stuck to revivalist modern rock and ranged from competent to highly enjoyable, BRMC have ran through as many overt, leathery production appliqués (premature JAMC revivalism, ""Tobacco Road"" blooze, combative sophomore slumping) as major label deals, giving credence to the idea that they're more journeymen than firebrands. This sort of context is important in regards to The Effects of 333, which is the kind of uncompromising and severe sonic shift that only works when a band has a lot more to lose, or at the very least an onerous record contract to fulfill. Instead, 333 is, no shit, a background noise record released on the band's own label. In the band's own words: ""no apologies, no lyrics, no regrets, just abstract."" And really, no indication that anyone outside of reviewers could be inspired to listen to it multiple times. 333 would be senseless enough were it just typical BRMC songs stripped of vocals, and at least in that form, it could serve as a bizarre curio for their most dedicated fans. There are a pair of tracks-- ""A Twisted State"" or ""And With This Comes""-- that sound like standard BRMC. On those tracks, reverbed guitars howl while lonesome acoustics strum inside the margin; it sounds pleasant enough to score the ruminative point on MTV's ""Made"" where the subject questions her commitment to cheerleading camp. Now imagine that going on for almost five minutes at a time with no real melodic vehicle or dynamics, and you're in touch with the unfathomable context in which these are the high points. 333 often sounds like a guitar band clumsily trying to recreate Fennesz. Forget Black Sea: Most of the music here is along the lines of the Dead Sea minus the depth-- a salty and motionless murk. Occasionally, a potentially intriguing touch filters in, such as the cicada-like chirps of ""A Sad State"" or the coruscated feedback swells that punctuate ""Still No Answer"". But they never become much more than touches tacked onto seemingly endless bouts of detuned guitar roughage. Even the most stubbornly motivated headphones listen reveals little in the way of layering or detail that might suggest how this could possibly manage to be three years in the making. One saving grace: This is almost certainly a one-off rather than a new direction. Too loud to be ambient; too polished to work in the realm of noise, the cruelest confirmation of The Effects of 333's failure to be a defiantly alienating trainwreck is that it's hardly unlistenable. Unlike previous 00s low points like Liz Phair and Travistan, 333 isn't a new direction. Hell, it's even conceivably admirable considering how electronic music that's more ambient than song-oriented is still somewhat off limits for rock bands, particularly ones with the commercial ambitions of BRMC. But the full-fledged commitment of 333 instead exposes a band way over its head, overcompensating for an inability to integrate fresh ideas into a framework that, from the sounds of Baby 81, needed them in the worst way. Quite a year we're already having here-- while it'll be surprising if we get a better record than Merriweather Post Pavilion in 2009, the odds are even longer that we'll see one as utterly pointless as the insanely inessential The Effects of 333.","This is, no shit, a background noise record released on BRMC's own label. In the band's own words: ""No apologies, no lyrics, no regrets, just abstract."" Well, an apology would have been nice.

GhostDeini the Great,Ghostface Killah,by: Nate Patrin,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/59299ff6b1335d7bf1697ef7/1:1/w_160/89aa20d6.jpg,2009-01-06 06:00:01,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12540-ghostdeini-the-great/,Def Jam,"I wouldn't mind another Greatest Hits collection for Ghostface Killah. It's impossible to condense every facet of greatness he's been exhibiting since his top-billing debut Ironman into less than 80 minutes, but putting it together in a way that makes it clear how skilled he is as both a lyrically-knotted abstractionist (i.e. Supreme Clientele standout ""Nutmeg"") and a vividly cinematic narrator (Fishscale highlight ""Shakey Dog"") would at least be a fitting synopsis for his prolific career. We got what would've made a good first volume in 2003's Shaolin's Finest, but there were enough gaps and successive hits-- like the two aforementioned tracks-- to justify a second one. And lord knows Ghost's got enough vault material-- mixtape tracks, remixes, rarities, whatever-- to make his studio album discography feel like it's only the surface of his work. The Hidden Darts series and 2008's The Wallabee Champ attest to that, and there's got to be more where those came from. Even with the guest stars and Theodore Unit members and truncated verses, Ghost's cutting-room floor material is typically high-quality enough to carry a pretty worthwhile album on its own. But an almost arbitrary-looking and thrown-together mixture of rarities and hits from a man with no shortage of either isn't just something that'll automatically cohere, especially in this single-serving-focused download economy. GhostDeini the Great is stuck halfway between a best-of and a remix collection, and that undercuts the strengths that would've been present in a disc devoted to one format or the other. When only eight of a collection's 16 tracks are devoted to representing an artist's familiar favorites, it turns what would've been a traditional best-of collection's highlights into a series of perfunctory oh-yeah-that moments. When you've got three of Supreme Clientele's better tracks in close quarters during the middle stretch-- ""Mighty Healthy"", ""Apollo Kids"", and ""Cher Chez La Ghost""-- the only thing that'll probably keep you from switching off GhostDeini and reaching for Clientele is the possibility that ""All That I Got Is You"" will make you reach for Ironman instead. That problem wouldn't exist if you took the tracklisting and removed all the ""(Remix)"" notations at the end. A best-of that included the aforementioned tracks as well as ""Run"" and ""Kilo"" and ""The Champ"" and ""Back Like That"" would, paired with Shaolin's Finest, make for a suitable career overview of Ghostface's first 10 years as a marquee solo artist. But the remixes cloud things, and none of them are eclipsing the originals. It makes a hell of a lot of sense to throw Malice from the Clipse onto the remix of ""Kilo"", and even if he's short on his usual wordplay and botches a pop-culture reference pretty egregiously (""we was 300 deep like them Persian soldiers""), his voice sounds like titanium over that beat. But other tracks don't add much of anything, particularly Ice Cube's tossed-off guest spot on ""Be Easy"" (""I'm a killer with the chrome all in your face/ Blow your face back, turn you into a ghost""-- OK, we get it), and Kanye's phoned-in asterisk of a verse on ""Back Like That"". At least those have only one dude sticking their foot in the door; pushing ""Run"" to the six-minute mark with new verses from Raekwon (evocative: ""I won't stop movin' 'til the metal ding me""), Freeway (jokey and hormonally distracted) and Lil' Wayne (sing-songing water-treading verses through a McDonald's drive-thru intercom) turns an agile sprint into a tiring marathon. There's two all-new tracks, too-- ""Ghostface Xmas"", which provides the bizarre experience of hearing Ghost rap about eggnog and gingerbread men in the same ramped-up, breathless shout he uses for rapping about pushing keys, and the horn-driven, broad-shouldered high-roller CEO playboy swagger of ""Slept on Tony"", which sounds like it could've fit just as well on the soundtrack to Iron Man. Go ahead and cop these on iTunes if you want; they're fun listens. But anyone who buys this without owning Ironman, Supreme Clientele or Fishscale is going to miss the bigger picture, and anyone who buys it while already owning those albums isn't gaining much at all.","Stuck between a best-of and a remix collection (featuring appearances by Kanye West, Lil Wayne, Clipse, Raekwon, and Ice Cube), GhostDeini the Great undercuts the strengths that would've been present in a disc devoted to one format or the other.

Theater of the Mind,Ludacris,by: Ian Cohen,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929be515e6ef95969323223/1:1/w_160/2047def9.jpg,2009-01-05 06:00:05,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12517-theater-of-the-mind/,Disturbing Tha Peace,"His ill-fated foray into politics didn't land him on Obama's enemies list, so Ludacris can go back to doing what he usually does every other year-- releasing a commercially successful and artistically iffy album. These records can be counted on for a handful of dozens-packing laugh riots, a handful of moderately inspired club tracks, a handful of handouts to less talented associates, and at least one song everyone can agree is just god-awful. This sort of consistent inconsistency has been good to Chris Bridges (""I was set for life after three LPs""), but he's called Theater of the Mind his ""classic"" album, which would probably raise a few more eyebrows had he not said the same exact thing about 2006's Release Therapy. But while Release Therapy sought to prove (in a relative sense) that Ludacris had important opinions about things other than pussy poppin' on the handstand, Theater is every bit as serious-minded in a different fashion. Forget gunning for the #1 spot over Austin Powers instrumentals, Ludacris is gunning for those nebulous ""top five, dead or alive"" props. It's not all that far-fetched considering the ""lyricist"" moments of The Preview, last year's mixtape with DJ Drama and the one boast he used twice by his second album-- ""My rap career goes back further than your father's hairline."" But the main problem stems from a boast on the intro-- ""Give me 16 bars on another nigga's song and I'MMA FUCKIN' KILL IT."" True enough, but give him 50 minutes of passable beats on his own album, and he might kill it, like, 45-55% of the time. As to be expected from someone who spends a lot of time with questionable screenplays, Theater of the Mind somewhat unintentionally breaks up into three distinct acts. But it flows less in a ""cinematic"" manner and more like Nick at Nite of the Mind-- going from slapstick single-cam, drippy rom-com, and the self-serious drama to close things out. Obviously, it leads to a constantly jarring listen, though the first third does provide its share of high points. ""Undisputed"" takes the concept of Ghostface's ""The Champ"" full stop, and perhaps in a show of Def Jam's priorities, he gets Floyd Mayweather as his trainer rather than a non-licensed Rocky rip. We'd need a bunch of footnotes to keep track of the quotables (""Your style isn't favored/ And DJ's NEVER bring it back/ Like when you borrow from your neighbor!"" or ""If you're sittin' on chrome/ I'll call my boys and you'll get stripped of your medals like Marion Jones!""). And while ""Wish You Would"" doesn't match the triumph of Paper Trail's hatchet-burying ""On Top of the World"", it's still potent shit talk. But where the first act shows, the final tells, as Luda goes through a pro forma checklist of Things Real MC's Do-- collaborating with Lil Wayne, ""The first southern rapper on a Primo beat,"" the Nas/Jay-Z number, and the ""conscious"" closer that features ""Spizzike"" Lee and Common (wait, what?). Each is pretty enjoyable if you can ignore the gaping leaps of logic. Ludacris claims ""I Do It for Hip Hop"" (not the fancy chains, etc.), about 20 minutes after boasting ""I'm about my money if it kills me"" and spends an entire verse advocating riding dirty because it makes his car resemble uniforms of shitty NBA franchises. He claims that, as a lyricist, he's the ""Last of a Dying Breed"" about 20 minutes after T-Pain shows up to advocate fucking fat chicks (""One More Drink""). And at long last, he pleads with the young black youth to git up, git out, and get something 20 minutes after making a track called ""Southern Gangsta"" where Rick Ross murders him on his own ignorant shit by misquoting ""Black Steel in the Hour of Chaos"" and boasting about his ""Jewish friends"" and the ""newest Benz."" While Theater isn't quite as dire as the above may indicate, like every other Ludacris record, it doesn't grow on you-- in fact, it actually contracts. In the middle, most tracks are rendered with a Friends-like one dimensionality (""the one about..."") that makes it perfectly clear from the first minute whether you'll ever want to listen to it again. The only multi-faceted concept is ""Call Up the Homies"", which is both a cross-country playdate where the Game and Ludacris meet up to shoot people while showing absolutely zero chemistry as well as a showcase for Phoenix's thoroughly uninspiring Willy Northpole. ""What Them Girls Like"" goes one title, and apparently it's chirpy rap and bullshit with Chris Brown and text messages from Plies. ""Nasty Girl"" is something of a ""Girls, Girls, Girls"" framework around his ""lady in the street/ But a freak in the bed"" line from ""Yeah!"", and a woefully undeveloped one at that. Like a Jewish mother, Ludacris can't think of any respectable professions besides doctors and lawyers. And these are his ideas of potential hits, bringing up an even more serious worry than him never completing a true ""classic"": he might not even be capable of a ""Get Back"" or ""Act a Fool"" anymore either.","Following his 2007 mixtape with DJ Drama, The Preview, Ludacris returns with a star-studded full-length that includes guest spots from the Game, Nas, Jay-Z, and T.I. and production from Swizz Beats, DJ Premier, and 9th Wonder.

Luna,The Aliens,by: Joe Tangari,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929be4e13d197565213b6fa/1:1/w_160/43fa6650.jpg,2009-01-05 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12514-luna/,Pet Rock,"If the Aliens remind you of the Beta Band, it's because they almost are the Beta Band. When the Betas split in 2004, three of its original members-- keyboardist John MacLean, drummer Robin Jones, and guitarist Gordon Anderson (who had recorded solo as Lone Pigeon)-- decided they still had some creating to do together, and forged the Aliens. The new band, which released its debut album, Astronomy for Dogs, in 2007, like their former band, veers between experimentalism and pop songcraft. Luna, their sophomore effort, is cut from the same cloth. At their best, the Aliens are clever composers, tuneful harmonists, and positioned in shallow leftfield. At their worst, they cry out for an editor and wander the outfield when they should be keeping their eye on the ball. Clocking in at over an hour, Luna probably would've been best served by a trim to around 45 minutes. Two songs break the 10-minute mark, and neither justifies it. Opener ""Bobby's Song"" gets good mileage in its midsection from playing with the speed and pitch of the vocal track, but the song takes it too far during a tiresome slowdown near the end. Still, there's a good song swimming in the psychedelic soup, and it pops up in the imaginative harmonica intro and the verses. The other epic, ""Billy Jack"", is as unfocused as the movie it's named for. It opens with over a minute of vocals trying to find their way out of a processing morass while keyboards noodle, before finally arriving at a drifting verse that's overpopulated with noise. The song keeps finding its footing, and each time piles on too much reverb and distortion and loses it. They seem to have imagined it as some sort of psychedelic glam epic, but it only becomes that more than six minutes in. In contrast, ""Everyone"" is a great four-minute slice of sunshine pop-psych, with buoyant piano and harmonies. Other missteps include the awkward way ""Sunlamp Show"" suddenly and sloppily shifts rhythms mid-way through, the three spaced-out electronic interludes where one would suffice, or the repetitive and amelodic ""Magic Man"".  On the whole, these songs overshadow the loveliness of the sparse ballad ""Theremin"" and the diaphanous closer ""Blue Mantle."" But it's ""Boats"", a sort of self-cover of a Lone Pigeon song from 2004's Schoozzzmmii, that does the most to redeem the record with its spectral harmonies and spacious arrangement, which gives the impression of traveling through a galaxy as starbursts of piano drift by. Luna is enjoyable enough to listen to, and a lot of Beta Band followers will find plenty to enjoy here, but it's ultimately an album I didn't like as much as I wanted to, and one that doesn't really find its footing until it's almost over.","Three ex-members of the much-missed Beta Band continue to veer between experimentalism and pop songcraft as the Aliens.

Friendly Fires,Friendly Fires,by: Mia Clarke,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929be4bc0084474cd0c2e7e/1:1/w_160/ca687ba4.jpg,2009-01-05 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12511-friendly-fires/,XL,"Hailing from St. Albans, an English commuter city known musically for producing the Zombies, Friendly Fires arrive on the heels of the British indie-dance zeitgeist helmed by the Klaxons and New Young Pony Club. Although their self-titled debut has the immediacy and hard hooks that riddle so much of this genre, Friendly Fires show an amplified, ambitious, and inventive attention to detail that helps steer them away from sounding like just another polished party band. That said, the most striking characteristic of Friendly Fires is that every track sounds like an indie club hit. This energy is relentless to a comical degree, and ends up being the group's Achilles' heel. ""Jump in the Pool"" opens with heavily produced vocal layering that brings to mind 10cc's ""I'm Not in Love""; the subtle vocal additions courtesy of lead singer Ed Macfarlane match the lush wall of guitars and Duran Duran-style wood-block-and-cowbell percussion. Never content to stick to the rails of an already memorable vocal melody, Macfarlane has a tendency to overdub in every direction, brilliantly emphasizing the word ""pool"" so it sounds like a clipped beat, and allowing an equally strong falsetto line to scorch through the spaces between. ""Paris"", with backing vocals from Au Revoir Simone, is similarly effect-laden, culminating in washes of renaissance cathedral reverb. Like many of their peers, Friendly Fires nod frequently to the 1980s, particularly on ""Strobe"", at the center of which Edd Gibson provides a gorgeous reversed guitar loop, and ""White Diamonds"", which sounds like early Cure mixed with ""Strangelove""-era Depeche Mode. The bass lines continually stick to classic, bouncy disco octaves that keep the dance vibe set at full speed ahead, and Friendly Fires pull off every move with considerable finesse, preserving all the euphoric dynamism of their powerful live shows. Friendly Fires are the infallible kings of the melodic reprise, and almost every track features two choruses. Rather than sounding like a dull muddle, however, the songs are so carefully arranged that everything keeps your attention. The band recorded the entire album in the garage of Macfarlane's parents' house, laying down tracks on a laptop using ""a crappy microphone gaffer taped to a mic stand,"" but without top-notch mixing drafted in from a variety of sources, Friendly Fires would sound like a completely different record. As it is, Friendly Fires is teeming with ideas, and although the record's consistent sound can be exhausting-- there is no release, no relaxation in tempo-- it's encouraging to locate a new band with too much passion, so much that it can hardly execute its ideas on one page.","This English indie-dance trio's debut shows an amplified, ambitious, and inventive attention to detail that helps steer them away from sounding like just another polished party band.

Zang Tumb Tuum: The ZTT Box Set,Various Artists,by: Tom Ewing,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929be53abf31b7dc7156124/1:1/w_160/2f1f48f5.jpg,2009-01-05 06:00:02,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12519-zang-tumb-tuum-the-ztt-box-set/,ZTT,"The story of Zang Tumb Tuum is one of pop's great fairytales. The hottest producer in Britain (Trevor Horn) starts his own record label and recruits an NME writer (Paul Morley) as ideologue and ideas man. Backed up with engineering skills and business savvy, the fledgling label proceeds to score two of the biggest UK hits of the 1980s with Frankie Goes to Hollywood's ""Relax"" and ""Two Tribes"". Thanks to Horn's thunderously clean hi-NRG production, Morley's skill at marketing and conceptualization, and the sleazy charisma of Frankie singer Holly Johnson, these were monumental records: singles as high-impact media events. Leading off this 25th anniversary record label retrospective, they still sound brilliant today. Frankie's awesome bluster, however, wasn't typical of what early ZTT records were trying to achieve. The label's aesthetic was at its most striking and successful when fusing the art theory of early 20th century Europe with the drive and gloss of mechanized 80s pop. They incorporated Dada, Futurism, expressionist cinema, and chanson into pop gestures in ways that felt dynamic, even natural. As Morley-- initially given free rein to shape the label's image-- wrote, ""Can you imagine what the Futurists would have done with a Fairlight [synthesiszer]?"" That was the ZTT idea in a nutshell. The band Propaganda, and Horn's own group Art of Noise, were its fullest expressions. Art of Noise made jokey, jerky pop concrète and found themselves adored by American electro pioneers. Propaganda made forbiddingly expensive synth-pop: their outrageously dramatic ""Dr Mabuse"" is the ultimate example of the ZTT sound. Both groups are well represented here. Morley's impact on ZTT peaked in 1985 with the release of Frankie's first album, and by 1988 he had mostly severed his ties with the label. Dividing ZTT's history into the Morley and post-Morley era might seem like playing along with the writer's own conceits, but the rapid decline in quality of the music on this box set backs it up. With the exception of 808 State-- whose 1989 ""Pacific"" was the last important single the label released-- little of the post-Morley material here is memorable. Morley's gradual estrangement from ZTT was more a symptom of its shifting priorities than a cause, but even so there's a spark of absurd inspiration that left with him. This isn't to say the youthful label had been infallible-- you might admire their cheek, but that won't make you sit through the truly execrable Das Psych-Oh! Rangers more than once. (Sigue Sigue Sputnik stole all their ideas, claims the lavish accompanying booklet rather desperately). On this evidence ZTT in the 90s and 00s has been paying a 20-year penance for its brief incarnation as Britain's most interesting record label. Discs Two and Three showcase its remarkable ability to observe a trend and sign its least intriguing exponents: There are few more workmanlike guitar bands than Ireland's the Frames or ignorably competent rave crews than Shades of Rhythm. The set suggests there aren't many undiscovered gems in the ZTT vault: Instead it offers a kind of alternate history of British rock and dance, one told in a dull monotone and with all the good bits stripped out. ZTT's newest hitmaker, David Jordan, makes a lumpy blend of world-pop in search of an opening ceremony to call its own. The idiotic campfire stomp of his ""Sun Goes Down"" is several sensibilities away from the sharpness and ambition of a Propaganda. The box set's audio component ends with Seal, ZTT's most successful post-Frankie project, whose songs show that Trevor Horn can still do sumptuous, even when there are no ideas to animate the work. For unheralded delights in the ZTT Box Set you have to stick to the first disc, or the fourth, a DVD of the label's best videos. Early signings like chanteuse Anne Pigalle and minimalist composer Andrew Poppy make more sense on screen, and it's amusing seeing Johnny Depp act a barfly in a Shane McGowan promo. Best of all is the Art of Noise's hilarious and terrifying video for ""Close (To the Edit)""-- band members smash the bourgeois instruments of the classical past while a freakish child mimes in cut-up motion to their Fairlight-driven future. Back on the first CD, familiar hits rub shoulders with MC Tunes vs. 808 State's ""Tunes Splits the Atom""-- a Brit-rap brag rolling on a well-picked Stone Roses sample-- and Act's ""Snobbery and Decay"". A collaboration between Propaganda's Claudia Brücken and synth-pop pioneer Thomas Leer, Act did nothing commercially, but this swirling, magnificently overripe single was the last lost masterpiece of the label's glory years. Brücken's haughty cabaret delivery revels in the decadence of wealth even as she sings its downfall-- ""Property, poverty, an unstable economy-- in decay!"" Like Zang Tumb Tuum itself, ""Snobbery and Decay"" was ambitious and ridiculous, grand and pretentious in equal measure: It was to be the last release in the label's Action Series, its opening salvo of pop records that had included Frankie and the Art of Noise. ZTT could not have asked for a finer farewell: Such a pity that it wasn't one.","This 25-year anniversary celebration of Trevor Horn and Paul Morley's famous imprint makes the case that ZTT was Britain's most interesting label for five years-- and then it plodded along for another 20.

Merriweather Post Pavilion,Animal Collective,by: Mark Richardson,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929be525e6ef95969323225/1:1/w_160/d8848c55.jpg,2009-01-05 06:00:01,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12518-merriweather-post-pavilion/,Domino,"With their constantly evolving sonic identity, in-your-face vocal mannerisms, and open-ended ideas about what their music might ""mean,"" Animal Collective seem designed to inspire obsessive fans and vociferous detractors in equal measure. Merriweather Post Pavilion, their latest full-length, has been anticipated to an almost ridiculous degree, with blogs and message boards lighting up with each scrap of new information or word of a possible leak. No one who's been looking forward to it should be disappointed. Everything that's defined the band to this point-- all those strands winding through their hugely diverse catalog-- is refined and amplified here. Since their inception, Animal Collective have wandered the territorial edges of music, scoping out where boundaries had been erected and looking beyond them. They've punctuated perfectly likeable indie rock songs with bleating vocalizations. They've seeded pretty instrumentals with irritating noise. They've juxtaposed West African rhythms and melodies cribbed from British folk. They've stayed on a single chord for 10 minutes. But Merriweather feels like a joyous meeting in a well-earned, middle place-- the result of all their explorations pieced together to create something accessible and complete. Although it will be tagged as Animal Collective's ""pop"" album, Merriweather Post Pavilion remains drenched in their idiosyncratic sound, a record that no one else could have made. The album is named for a Maryland venue that last year played host to Santana, Sheryl Crow, and John Mayer, but its songs won't be heard on the radio, and besides, Animal Collective's M.O. requires them to exist outside of rigid formats. Nonetheless, they've found a natural way to integrate the sing-along melodies, sticky hooks, and driving percussion that have long been hallmarks of celebratory popular music. Animal Collective's two vocalists, Dave Portner (aka Avey Tare) and Noah Lennox (aka Panda Bear), have never sounded better together, and the way their styles complement each other is the story of the album. On the one hand you have Panda's straightforward melodies, his fuzzy, head-in-the-clouds dreaminess, and his instinctual trawl through pop music history. The tracks that favor his songwriting typically have an underlying sense of drone, with everything moving forward along a line in relation to some subliminal center: They begin, then build, expand, and contract. Tare, meanwhile, tends to work within a more classic pop structure, with clear bridges and snappy choruses, greater harmonic development, and a sharper lyrical focus. Here, he reins in the blurting vocalizations that he's so often used as punctuation (the hardcore faithful might miss this unhinged emoting just a little). Both songwriters are on exactly the same page and, working with sonic spelunker Brian ""Geologist"" Weitz and producer Ben Allen (no Josh ""Deakin"" Dibb this time), they've found a sumptuous musical background for their most accomplished songs. Merriweather is the kind of album on which any song could be someone's favorite, but two will likely reign as the choice picks: ""My Girls"" and ""Brother Sport"", both of which leaked prior to the record's release, contain the album's most effervescent moments, drawing from the communal energy of the group's astonishing live show. ""My Girls"" grows from a synth-speckled, half-speed intro into a booming electro-pop burner with handclaps and deep bass-- a towering edifice of sound trailed by long wisps of West coast harmonies. The Afro-Brazilian-flavored ""Brother Sport"" moves from one chanted melodic nugget to the next before building to a huge swirl of psychedelic sound that encompasses rave sirens and immersive tribal drums. But these obvious peaks would have less resonance if not for the more subtle moments. The oblong architecture of ""Daily Routine"" hearkens back to the band's less stable earlier days, as it moves appealingly from an awkward organ-based mid-tempo number to a long, droney coda that has the ego-pulverizing bliss of shoegaze. The surging thrust of distortion and drumkick that propels ""Summertime Clothes"" starts with an almost militaristic pomp, but the song soon reaches a place of pure sweetness with a simple chorus hook (""I want to walk around with you"") that could have come from any point in the last 100 years. Similarly out-of-time sentiments mark ""Bluish""-- lines like ""I'm getting lost in your curls,"" or, ""Some kind of magic in the way you're lying there""-- and the music has the airy ease of 1970s soft-rock that weirdly winds up a little disconcerting. And then ""Also Frightened"" has the dislocated swoon of first-wave psychedelia, a ""See Emily Play""-style mediation on the small insanity of childhood softened with billowing layers of voices. The lyrics focus on the body, basic human connection, the need to take care of oneself, the puzzle of existence. Where the churning electronic sound, with its fizzes and echoes and underwater cast, brings to mind altered states and the confusing gap between the familiar and the strange, the words seem like a running commentary on the essential mystery of being alive. Animal Collective don't tell stories, and their music rarely has characters; there's little clever wordplay and fewer money lines you'll repeat later on. Rather, the words reinforce the sense of vulnerability that cuts through the music, and wind up being an essential component on an album that oozes confidence from every pore. Music obsessives talk a lot about originality-- whether it's important, or why having a new sound should or shouldn't matter. In recent years, some fantastic albums have turned a number of people off for being retreads, which has sparked some interesting discussions. This album, which finds Animal Collective completely owning their unique sound, feels like the crucial next step in that conversation. What they've constructed here is a new kind of electronic pop-- one which is machine-generated and revels in technology but is also deeply human, never drawing too much attention to its digital nature. It's of the moment and feels new, but it's also striking in its immediacy and comes across as friendly and welcoming. Animal Collective have spent the decade following their own path, figuring out what their music is capable of while also working to bring more listeners into their world. On Merriweather Post Pavilion, their commitment has paid off tremendously.",,9.6,

Unlike most of her contemporaries, though, the transplanted Norwegian's success isn't owed to her fashionability (she isn't) or her dynamism as a songwriter (even at her most arresting, she verges on adult contemporary), but rather, a workmanlike dependability. A typical Ane Brun song favors spare instrumentation, slightly broken sentiment, and an unwavering devotion to prettiness; aside from occasional detours into folksy MOR and unlikely covers (her warbly take on Cyndi Lauper's ""True Colors"" is currently ad agency catnip in Europe), it's a formula she's stuck to over the years with dogged consistency. Changing of the Seasons feels like the record where Brun's lack of range catches up to her. Where her previous productions have benefitted from creating chasms of space through reverb and cavernous silence, this album-- a breakup record-- feels weighed down by the same tactic. Much of it is laid so bare it can be difficult to locate the songs within: For all the irrefutable prettiness, there's precious little to hang on to; a lot of the songs are strung-together tapestries of incomplete hooks, rustic guitar riffs, and generous dollops of strings and backing vocals that don't coalesce into anything more. Which isn't to say there aren't highlights; they just aren't very immediate. Opener ""The Treehouse Song""-- an exception, and possibly the best thing she's ever done-- raises false hopes by channelling vintage Loretta Lynn and Dolly Parton for a moment of uncharacteristically robust folksiness. It turns out to be a red herring, though; by the next song, Brun's back to her torpid, tiptoeing ways. It's a look she barely relinquishes for the remainder of the record, and while single ""The Fall"", the broody ""Ten Seconds"", and the promising but unrealized ""Don't Leave"" earn honorable mentions as best in breed, its ultimately Brun's dourness-- not her music-- that ultimately leaves the most lasting impression. If it's a downer you're after, there are better records than this.","Dependable Scandinavian singer-songwriter Ane Brun returns with another record of spare instrumentation, slightly broken sentiment, and an unwavering devotion to prettiness.

Give Me Love: Songs of the Brokenhearted - Baghdad 1925-1929,Various Artists,by: Joe Tangari,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929be4a13d197565213b6f4/1:1/w_160/239bbc2e.jpg,2008-12-12 06:00:04,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12510-give-me-love-songs-of-the-brokenhearted-baghdad-1925-1929/,Honest Jon's,"The Iraq War is a cataract in our understanding of the nation of Iraq and its modern history. It clouds the way we view and think about the country to the extent that we in the United States are blinded to anything beyond the violence of the last few years and the atrocities of the Saddam Hussein era. The obscuring effect of recent events leads me to believe that Honest Jon's Give Me Love might be the most important archival compilation of the year. Outside of a very small number of performers, including oudist Munir Bashir and jazz musician Amir ElSaffar, very little Iraqi music has ever made an impact internationally. Indeed, for most of the 20th century the popular music of Iraq and most of the rest of the Arab world lived completely within the shadow of Lebanese and especially Egyptian artists. This compilation, then, represents one of a precious few attempts to provide a clear window into the cultural life of a widely misunderstood place-- the Iraq of the late 1920s, during a period of British hegemony in the region that began when the Ottomans were driven out of Mesopotamia during the First World War. The Gramophone Company and its subsidiary His Master's Voice-- HMV today-- were the first major companies to make recordings in 1925. (In the pursuit of record buyers' money the world over, Gramophone unwittingly provided one of the greatest cultural services of the 20th century by sending its recording engineers across the globe to document local musics-- I'd give a lot to be allowed several weeks in a hypothetical Gramophone vault.) Others quickly followed, including Polyphone, Baidaphon, Odeon, and Columbia, but all the recordings included here are drawn from HMV's nearly 900 78 rpm sides, all made from 1925 to 1929. When approaching this compilation, it's important to remember something that's true of records from all eras: the recording medium is a part of the music. In today's studio, you might have 64 tracks, 20 different kinds of microphones, and an infinite amount of extra gear your can pile onto a record. Then, they had a mechanical recording device with a horn that the musicians had to be carefully arranged around to get the right mix of sounds. The dawn of electrical recording was right around 1925; by 1926, it was the norm in most of the world. But the liners here state pretty plainly that most of these records were made without microphones, and I frankly don't know enough of the difference to argue the point. What I can tell you is that this disc is nearly devoid of the surface crackle of 78s, and the sound is very clear. But one shouldn't expect a modern range of frequency response, as the low-end of performances rarely registered well on 1920s recordings. What you will hear are impassioned performances, instrumental and vocal, from some of the most well-regarded performers in Baghdad of the era. Most of them are Jewish-- for various reasons, Iraq's religious minorities dominated the country's music prior to the 1950s, when the vast majority of Christians and essentially all the Jews fled. This exodus began during World War II after a pro-Nazi coup d'etat and subsequent pogrom. Audiences were split by gender-- public performances for men by women were looked down upon, and many, though not all, female singers were recruited from brothels, which was another barrier to respect. The few recordings by women included here have same melismatic fire as their male counterparts, though, and nearly every track has the characteristic Iraqi slowness that makes the country's music distinct in spite of obvious Egyptian, Persian, and Indian influences. The other caution for modern listeners is not to expect the kind of hook-filled instant gratification we're used to today-- this is music you need to soak in and feel, from the aching love songs to the frenetic instrumental taqsims. The ornamental vocals mask often straightforward lyrics, which translate to phrases such as ""I wait for my lover on tenterhooks,"" ""Since you left me my eyes are on the brink of shutting down for good,"" and ""Short of dying, how can I get you out of mind?"" Songs of the brokenhearted indeed. The instrumentation consists of small ensembles, with violin, oud (an Arabic lute played with a fluttering, staccato technique), mutbij (a wooden double flute with a wailing, nasal tone), qanun (a type of zither) and hand percussion. Some songs include small choirs positioned far from the horn. This was an urban type of arrangement, and many rural songs were transposed to these ensembles for recording purposes-- it's important to note that these weren't field recordings, but rather popular music recordings intended for a very competitive marketplace. I have a few small issues with the compilation itself as a package-- while the liner notes paint a vivid picture of 1920s Baghdad and provide substantial background, they also don't include any recording notes for individual tracks, or even Gramophone catalog numbers, which is the kind of information collectors of this music like to have. There's also no real account of the reasoning behind the track selection-- out of the 900 available, why these, in this order? Sometimes knowing the compilers' organizing principle can be illuminating. Those concerns aside, though, this is a compelling peek at the soul of Iraq that's been so long obscured to us by the fog of war.","Collecting recordings of small ensembles found in and around Baghdad in the late 1920s, this compilation sheds light on a misunderstood region whose recent history obscures its cultural legacy.

Original Darkness,Christina Carter,by: Marc Masters,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929be4cabf31b7dc715611a/1:1/w_160/a4787f22.jpg,2008-12-12 06:00:03,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12512-original-darkness/,Kranky,"""The white becomes the black/ The black becomes the white,"" sings Christina Carter to open Original Darkness. On paper, that couplet seems almost meaningless. But when delivered in her deliberate, haunting cadence, the words have a weight greater than their surface meaning-- it's an apt beginning to an album that derives power from simplicity. Through her solo work and as a member of Charalambides, Carter has long been an expert avant-folk minimalist, mining depth from small, repetitive songs. On Original Darkness she's developed this skill to near-perfection. Take the album's fourth track, ""Re-Found Mary"". Here Carter strums a single acoustic chord, adding electric guitar flourishes that are nearly as repetitive. On top, she slowly breathes elongated syllables as if hypnotized, with lyrics so elusive they are almost nonsensical: ""I re-found Mary/ In Forestville/ Cold pea princess/ Walking like a new mother."" But her intensity makes the song an eerie meditation, so tense it could burst at any second. Original Darkness is filled with such potent moments. Carter builds each song with her acoustic guitar, one or two chords at time, then adds a restrained electric guitar or a chilly keyboard. The results are so entrancing that the album could have worked as a collection of instrumentals. But Carter's voice matches the music so well, these songs practically are instrumentals, saying more with sound than words. Those words skirt around their subjects evocatively, in a way perhaps best described as specific vagueness. This creates a sense of dislocation, even absence: ""We are losers
of ourselves/
In the car
on the road to our destination,"" she intones in ""Fountain of Youth"". Later, during the sparse, Loren Connors-like ""You Are So Far Away"", Carter stoically insists that ""The flow of time is so important/ And I'm never in it."" And in ""Hidden Man"" she offers partial descriptions of an enigmatic figure, catching brief glimpses of his reflection. Even when Carter gets more direct, the power of her songs comes in what's unsaid. On ""Do Not Love a Woman"", she balances the title with a list of womanly things she does love, as if wholes aren't as important as unconnected parts. ""Capable of Murder"" is even more specific, but still leaves details aside in favor of emotion. The album ends with its prettiest piece, the hymn-like ""Do You Recognize My Voice?"" Over a soaring keyboard, Carter describes a voice that ""sounds like a voice I have heard before
/ All contained within a familiar voice/ The voices of women, the voices of men."" Harmonizing with herself, Carter seems to suggest that she's found the key to all songs inside a single, simple melody. If that's her claim, it's hard to imagine a more convincing case than Original Darkness.","Through her solo work and as a member of Charalambides, Christina Carter has long been an expert avant-folk minimalist, mining depth from small, repetitive songs.

To Be Free: The Nina Simone Story,Nina Simone,by: Chris Dahlen,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929be505e6ef95969323220/1:1/w_160/b7786973.jpg,2008-12-12 06:00:02,Jazz,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12516-to-be-free-the-nina-simone-story/,Legacy,"There are two types of maverick artists: the ones who adopt different styles as a way of switching costumes, and the ones who take a variety of musical concepts and subvert them wholly to their own ideas, and their own identities. Nina Simone was clearly the latter. Drawing on a wide swath of her catalog, from her first recording session to one of her last, producer Richard Seidel demonstrates how boldly she seized any song that caught her ear, as she marches through Duke Ellington, Kurt Weill, torch songs, folk songs, and the pop and rock hits of her day. A Julliard-trained pianist who played clubs while harboring an ambition to be a composer, Simone scored hits with a label that had to cede total creative control before she'd sign on their dotted line. Her performances were spontaneous, her mood impetuous and imperious. It's as hard to boil down the many facets of Simone's career as to romanticize the rough edges. To Be Free succeeds because it doesn't even try. Disc One is the most varied. A reading of Ellington's ""Mood Indigo"" from her first studio session opens the set, and introduces Simone as a smart jazz singer and a pianist with fingers of steel. She's unpredictable from her earliest cuts, with her playing erupting into sudden bursts of forte while she sings each lyric as if she's only just deciding what she thinks of it. Her voice is low and rich but its power, proven on tracks like ""I Put a Spell on You"", lies in its sudden intensity; and on the live tracks that make up roughly half the set, we hear a nightclub vet's knack for sensing every twitch in the crowd's mood, and a diva's gift for ignoring them at her whim. Her bloodcurdling performance of Weill's ""Pirate Jenny"" sears anyone who would ever think of the protagonist as less than a human being. She probably would have sung it the same way no matter what was happening in the Deep South, but it marks one of the earliest times she addressed the civil rights movement.  Disc Two covers the crucial period from 1968-69, starting with a live performance of ""Mississippi Goddam"" recorded days after the murder of Dr. King. ""I'm not about to be non-violent, honey!"" Simone cracks at one point, and she follows the statement with a laugh: Simone's no militant, but her resistance ain't passive, or saintly. Instead, it's proud. By the late 60s Simone reveals herself as a hell of a singer for a rock band: you can hear it over the fierce ""Save Me"" and ""Revolution,"" and she sings 1968's ""Ain't Got No-I Got Life"" with every ounce of her body. And rebel or no, she was also on top of the pop trends, and knew the right artists to cover. The backing vocals on ""Turn! Turn! Turn!"" and ""Poppies"" date the performances, but her Bob Dylan covers are often exquisite-- especially ""Just Like Tom Thumb's Blues"", which melts the original's rambling blues into a reverie. On Disc Three, the tunes get funkier, the grooves run longer, and the theaters are larger. The rambling but rousing centerpiece of her late-period disc is a 20-minute ""My Sweet Lord"" that segues in and out of a solo reading of ""Today Is a Killer""-- and ends with Simone's cry that the Lord ""is a killer."" (Even He can't escape her wrath.) But as the disc wears on, the performances start to sound exhausted, until they trail off in the early 70s. For context, you can turn to the DVD, which contains an edgy documentary from 1970. This TV special features a candid interview interspersed with concert clips, the highlight being a startling performance of ""Go to Hell"" that catches her at her most dangerous. In conversation Simone frequently sounds like she's on the verge of either a burn-out or an epiphany, but she's revealing as she tries to pin down what ""freedom"" means to her: her definition-- that freedom means ""no fear""-- is as good a key as you'll get to this set. So many strong currents run through To Be Free that it's easy to cling to just one.  But right when we focus on her as a protest singer, we fall into a haunted ballad like ""The Other Woman""; and anyone who picks this up thinking they're getting brunch music wasn't counting on all the bongos.  Simone is missed, but this isn't a sentimental set, and while it's tempting to juxtapose her eulogy for Dr. King with what happened on election day last month, that's just one part of what she fought for-- and one part of what made her free.","This invaluable box set traces the legendary career of Nina Simone from her first recording session to one of her last, as she marches through Duke Ellington, Kurt Weill, torch songs, folk songs, and the pop and rock hits of her day.

Christmas on Mars,The Flaming Lips,by: Stuart Berman,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929be4f5e6ef9596932321e/1:1/w_160/7daa4bd6.jpg,2008-12-12 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12515-christmas-on-mars/,Warner Bros.,"Astronauts with vaginas for faces, a baby's head crushed like a watermelon, Fred Armisen singing ""Silent Night""-- the Flaming Lips' maiden foray into DIY filmmaking, Christmas on Mars, features no lack of bizarro imagery for fans who've been patiently waiting the past seven years for its release. The film essentially encompasses everything Wayne Coyne has ever sung about-- the future, outer space, stressed-out scientists, heroism, insanity, the inevitability of death, hope in the face of disaster, the perseverance of the human spirit, mankind's miniscule standing in the universe at large, and, yes, Christmas. And as ridiculous as the idea of Coyne making a sci-fi film in his backyard may be, it was a logical step for a band that's historically found its stage-show inspiration in the local hardware store. But compared to the orgiastic circus of balloons, confetti, and dancing mascots that has come to define the the Flaming Lips' live set-up, Christmas on Mars is a starkly rendered, sometimes ponderous, rather bleak affair. Starring multi-instrumentalist Steven Drozd as a Mars-station major trying to salvage Christmas celebrations on the red planet after a Santa-suited colleague's suicide, and Coyne as the mute alien who helps him, the film plays like a 2001 that looks like it cost $2,001 to make. Its accompanying score likewise marks a break from the Lips' post-millennial recorded output, which, consistent with the band's live evolution, has emphasized the band's cute and quirky qualities while submerging the strange. And yet, even with the complete absence of the band's signature devices-- namely, Coyne's creaky croon and Drozd's earth-quaking drum beats-- Christmas on Mars still feels very much like a Flaming Lips album, fusing synthetic orchestral elements, choral harmonies and electronic effects to create a soundtrack that, like the film, captures both what we imagine outer space to be (a wondrous expanse of psychedelic splendor) and what it really is: a cold, dark, desolate place that's so vast, it's suffocating. Not for nothing is the soundtrack book-ended by an eerily Lynchian ambient piece called ""Once Beyond Hopelessness"". Given that the film's production began in 2001, it would follow that the score's origins date back to that post-Soft Bulletin/pre-Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots era. In a sense, Christmas on Mars could be heard as a parallel-universe product of what the Flaming Lips could've turned into had they decided to further experiment with The Soft Bulletin's background orchestral textures instead of streamlining them into Yoshimi's compact electro-pop. With the two-part ""The Distance Between Mars and the Earth"", the Disneyfied acid trip of ""The Horrors of Isolation"", and wordless harmony haze of ""In Excelsior Vaginalistic"", you can imagine what Bulletin standards like ""A Spoonful Weighs a Ton"" and ""The Spark That Bled"" would sound like without the actual songs on top of them. But the score is also a reminder of a time when the Lips were more interested in provoking their audience than pleasing it: The power-drilled drones of ""Your Spaceship Comes From Within"" play like a one-minute distillation of the half-hour electronic-noise oscillation they tacked onto 1992's Hit to Death in the Future Head, while the slow-motion tribal build of ""Suicide and Extraordinary Mistakes"" is accompanied by an ear-piercing, high-pitched frequency that harkens back to 1997's four-CD mind-fuck Zaireeka. As the soundtrack progresses, it actually acquires a logic and momentum that isn't necessarily experienced watching the film, which tends to use this music in brief bursts-- for example, ""The Gleaming Armament of Marching Genitalia"" is a swell of Wagnerian pomp that soundtracks the aforementioned baby-crushing. On record the track is made more effective by an aftermath come-down with ""The Distress Signals of Celestial Objects"". In turn, the muted reverberations and droning crescendo of ""Distress Singnals"" sets the scene for ""Space Bible With Volume Lumps"", which manifests the film's claustrophobic tension with a ticking glitch beat, analog-synth loops and blaring trumpets. In Christmas on Mars' closing credits, The Flaming Lips include a special thank you to the band's fans for their support and patience with the film; but for long-time followers of the band, that patience is truly rewarded by the soundtrack album, which-- following a series of tours that have more or less stuck to the same nightly script-- reassert the Flaming Lips' ability to surprise, experiment and freak us out. Tellingly, the Christmas on Mars DVD/CD package is housed in a regular CD jewel-case as opposed to the standard DVD long box-- the implication being that Christmas on Mars is as much a film in service to a soundtrack as a soundtrack in service to a film.","After seven years, the Flaming Lips' Christmas film finally comes to DVD; not surprisingly, both the movie and its soundtrack reflect the Lips circa 2001 more than the group's post-millennial output, which has emphasized the band's cute and quirky qualities while submerging the strange.

The Uglysuit,The Uglysuit,by: Rebecca Raber,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bded13d197565213b65b/1:1/w_160/2453bdd1.jpg,2008-12-11 06:00:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12475-the-uglysuit/,Quarterstick,"It makes sense that the members of Oklahoma City's the Uglysuit are all in their very early 20s. After all, on their debut album they play dreamy pop with a kind of stone-faced earnestness that only the very young possess. And like other short-in-the-tooth bands, they've yet to establish their own identity and instead blatantly borrow from their predecessors. Remember that semester when you went punk or grew a beard or started dressing solely in Goodwill polyester, and your new ""look"" briefly became your new personality? In much the same way, the Uglysuit spend most of their self-titled album trying on musical guises, perhaps as a way to suss out what kind of band they'd like to be. The jangle and washed-out harmonies of tracks like ""Brownblue Passing"" suggest that Uglysuit are comfortable with territory already well-worn by the Shins, while ""...And We Became Sunshine"" features frontman Israel Hindman's eerily uncanny Conor Oberst imitation. Despite being so familiar, both songs are still charming in a wistful, glassy-eyed kind of way. ""Chicago"", with its glossy keyboard, soaring chorus, and plaintive vocals, is the collection's most accessible track, sounding like an updated, echo-laden version of the Counting Crows' ""Long December"". Instrumental interlude ""Elliot Travels"" feels at first like an out-of-place piano fantasia on an already short album. But when combined with the vertigo-inducing carnival ""Anthem Of The Arctic Birds"" that follows, it suggests that the band's truest influence is those delightful weirdoes from their hometown, the Flaming Lips. Two of the nine tracks expand beyond the seven-minute mark, and it's when the Uglysuit stretch out that they seem to be having the most fun. ""Everyone Now Has a Smile"" and the aforementioned ""...And We Became Sunshine"" could use stronger hooks to anchor their crashing, psychedelic orchestrations, but they're still enjoyable and infused with a confidence lacking on the rest of the album. The Uglysuit are certainly competent, but on this debut their music feels too by-the-book. Where are the surprises? With nothing unexpected and without a distinct musical personality of their own, the band feels too much like an indie-rock Frankenstein's monster, a creature born in the lab of a music supervisor for the CW. Their debut is perfect for soundtracking that bittersweet breakup on ""Gossip Girl"" or *""*One Tree Hill"", but alone on a stereo, devoid of visual accompaniment, it's ultimately kind of empty. Which brings us back to the band's youth. The Uglysuit in a sense feels like a freshman survey class of modern indie, covering all the biggies (from Bright Eyes to Wilco) but failing in the details. They have potential, though, so here's hoping the Uglysuit graduate soon.","Young Oklahoma City band debuts with an album that references several strains of iconic indie rock, from the jangly pop of the Shins to the jammier moments of Wilco.

I'll Stay 'Til After Christmas,Various Artists,by: Marc Hogan,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Senior Staff Writer</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929be495e6ef95969323212/1:1/w_160/cced2f96.jpg,2008-12-11 06:00:04,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12509-ill-stay-til-after-christmas/,AWR,"Santa Claus, not the Grinch, stole indie rock. Sure, the novelty of perennial sadsacks Low celebrating the happiest time of the year on 1999's Christmas EP got some of the elves' pointy ears perked. And in 2004, even Charlie Brown would've rocked Dust-to-Digital's Where Will You Be Christmas Day anthology of pre-1960 curios, a fine album as anti-commercial as I'm told indie culture once was. As recently as 2006, though, Pitchfork's Rob Mitchum could, with a relatively straight (bearded!) face, call Sufjan Stevens ""something like the bizarro GG Allin"" for releasing a box set devoted to what, ""in the photo-negative world of indie rock morality...might be the most obscene concept possible"": Christmas. Peace and love were for poseurs, or, worse, hippie jam-band dudes. We were so much older then; I guess we're younger than that now. I'll Stay 'Til After Christmas, Force Field PR chief Daniel Gill's new digital-only compilation of indie-oriented yuletide carols, comes out in a year when indie-friendly bands as big as Weezer and Coldplay or as modest as the Raveonettes and the Boy Least Likely To are all releasing seasonal tunes. The Hives faced off in ""A Christmas Duel"" with Cyndi Lauper; Stephen Colbert sang about the miracle of drugs with Willie Nelson. The Flaming Lips, who acknowledged the holiday on 2003's ""A Change at Christmas (Say It Isn't So)"", are now spending a long-awaited Christmas on Mars, while Jim Jones, Juelz Santana, and Skull Gang are working on a sort of sequel to 2006's A Dipset Christmas. Like Hard to Find a Friend's Peace on Earth Vol. II compilation, though-- which benefits the Children of Uganda Fund, and features Oxford Collapse, among many others-- I'll Stay 'Til After Christmas goes to a cause greater than commercialism; Amnesty International gets all the proceeds of the release. The idea for the album apparently came from a tradition Gill and his wife, Reda Rountree, started several years ago of making Christmas-music compilations for friends and family. And don't look for Sufjan-style reverse-transgressiveness: The songs on I'll Stay 'Til After Christmas meet the holiday from a place as weary and conflicted as we all are. They're frequently quite good, too. Two reimagined modern Christmas classics bookend the album: Au Revoir Simone remake A Charlie Brown Christmas's ""Christmas Time Is Here"" into a halting, snowflake-pretty indie pop tune bringing to mind the Postmarks, while Belong's Turk Dietrich dismembers Elvis's ""Blue Christmas"" in a way previous ""Blue Christmas""-coverer Bright Eyes could never drink enough purple stuff to imagine. (Lil Wayne, on the other hand...) There's sadness in the air: No Kids bend genders as they stoically face ""Another Winter in This Summer Town"", from the 2006 musical Grey Gardens, and Postal Service member Jimmy Tamborello's Figurine evoke the plainspoken duets of Yo La Tengo over chattering electronics on decent breakup anthem ""The Holidays Behind Us"". If nothing here is likely to enter the canon of shopping malls and Delilah specials like Mariah Carey's undeniable ""All I Want for Christmas Is You"", well, that's more befitting the spirit of Charlie Brown (and indie culture) anyway. I'll Stay 'Til After Christmas can also do traditional. My Brightest Diamond's reading of standard ""Nature Boy"" belongs in a long line of haunting, vocal-driven Christmas songs that still put me to sleep, but her powerful performance makes the closing maxim pack an extra wallop (yeah, yeah, it's the song from Moulin Rouge). Blitzen Trapper and Arthur & Yu turn in solid folkie efforts, though only one makes reference to Steve McQueen (full disclosure: I've known Blitzen's now-manager since before Christmas 1989). Sure, a few of the tracks are just so-so, including probably the sharpest left turn: Au's seasick ""I'll Be Home for Christmas"", a bold idea that doesn't quite work. But then there's Sally Shapiro's winsome 2007 favorite ""Anorak Christmas (Piano Mix)"", a rosy-cheeked synth-pop take on all that love and joy crap that probably still makes some aging indie puritans gag. Hark! The herald angel sings.","This Amnesty International benefit album collects yuletide songs from indie heavyweights such as Blitzen Trapper, My Brightest Diamond, Sally Shapiro, Belong, Au Revoir Simone, and Jimmy Tamborello's Figurine project.

Welcome to the Welcome Wagon,The Welcome Wagon,by: Amanda Petrusich,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929be4613d197565213b6ed/1:1/w_160/9834a377.jpg,2008-12-11 06:00:03,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12506-welcome-to-the-welcome-wagon/,Asthmatic Kitty,"The Welcome Wagon are the Reverend Vito Aiuto and his wife, Monique: They live in Brooklyn and head Resurrection Presbyterian Church, a young, community-minded congregation that meets every Sunday. The duo's debut album, Welcome to the Welcome Wagon, is a collection of intricate Christian folksongs designed to inspire vigorous clap-alongs and, perhaps, the occasional glaze-and-sniffle. Recorded, engineered, mixed, and designed by Sufjan Stevens (he also wrote the liner notes, released it on his label, Asthmatic Kitty, and contributes banjo, bass, drums, electric and acoustic guitar, percussion, piano, ukulele, and vocals), Welcome to the Welcome Wagon sounds-- yup-- an awful lot like a Sufjan Stevens album: rich, almost childlike vocal harmonies, gentle banjo strums, and elaborate orchestral arrangements coalescing into something warm, layered, and instantly familiar. Given Stevens' role in the album's conception and creation, a comparison to his own back catalogue might seem facile, but it's also hopelessly true (even Vito Aituo's soft, nudging pipes sound awfully similar to Stevens' own). Still, Stevens isn't employed as a songwriter-- aside from covers of the Velvet Underground's ""Jesus"" and the Smiths' ""Half a Person"", Vito Aiuto is credited with composing most of the music, occasionally borrowing lyrics from old sermons or hymns (or, in the case of ""Sold! To the Nice Rich Man"", from Daniel Smith of Danielson and Danielson Famile), and he and Monique trade off on lead vocals, backed, always, by a crew of pretty, plaintive crooners. A mix of original illustrations and images snatched from ""funeral cards and vacation bible school paraphernalia,"" the album's artwork is deliberately and unapologetically cloying, and skillfully evokes the silk rose-covered toilet paper basket aesthetic of your grandmother's bathroom. But that's kind of the point: The entire project is impeccably stylized, from the soft-focus colored pencil drawings of children clutching bibles to the Aiutos' own real life pastor-and-his-wife mythology. There are plenty of winks at ageless bible kitsch (see the blue-suited, Ken-haired pastor on the album's back cover, accompanied by the text ""Why does our pastor preach from the BIBLE in our church?"", or the toddler in a yellow shirt, pointing at, duh, his Bible) but Welcome to the Welcome Wagon is nothing if not earnestly rendered. Stevens admits that most of these tracks were recorded in apartments, and they have the scrappy, church-choir feel of people sitting around, singing together. Maybe eating sandwich cookies in between takes. And while Welcome to the Welcome Wagon might not be unprecedented, exactly, it does contain a slew of truly great songs: ""But for You Who Fear My Name""-- written by Lenny Smith, father of Daniel and the grand-patriarch of the Famile-- is a deliciously light stomp-and-clap folk song, with a squiggly electric guitar line and perfectly metered lyrics about salvation. ""American Legion"", one of the less explicitly religious songs here, is a sweet, heartfelt love song (""I still have the last letter you left for me, all your t-shirts, your red and green pedigree, all the rest is sealed up behind memory,"" Vito whispers), while opener ""Up on a Mountain"", sung predominantly by Monique-- whose voice is beautifully, improbably innocent-- is both terrifying and lulling (when she sings ""It's a long way down,"" you'll be inclined to believe her).* Welcome to the Welcome Wagon* feels a bit like a pet-project (check that full-color picture of Svengali Stevens, wearing a Michigan hat and holding a microphone!), but it's also endearing and sweet (despite the copious Biblical blood shed therein), and, most important, as addictive as anything: Like any good folk record, these tracks lodge in your subconscious, reemerging while you're chopping potatoes for dinner, tugging on your mittens, or curling into bed. And you'll like it that way.","Recorded, engineered, mixed, and designed by Sufjan Stevens (he also wrote the liner notes, released it on his label, Asthmatic Kitty, and contributes vocals and music), Welcome to the Welcome Wagon sounds an awful lot like...a Sufjan Stevens album.

The Soul of Rock And Roll,Roy Orbison,by: Stephen M. Deusner,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929be25c0084474cd0c2e2f/1:1/w_160/72d3adfc.jpg,2008-12-11 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12474-the-soul-of-rock-and-roll/,Monument,"Roy Orbison didn't shake his hips. He didn't set his piano on fire. Didn't wear blue suede shoes. Didn't become a preacher, marry his cousin, or go to jail. He wasn't what you'd call handsome, at least not in the sublime way that Elvis wore his looks. He was neither a rebel nor a rabble-rouser. He stood stock still and kept his head up. He sang about crying over girls, and his signature shades hid the tears in his eyes. He played a mean guitar, but sang a meaner ballad. He yearned and wept, but never moped. His stoic demeanor lent his tales of heartbreak a dignity that gave them verisimilitude and told his teenage listeners that all their confusion and pain-- all part of the culture, even if shunned by adults-- were real and worthwhile. Most efforts to laud Orbison, a first-generation rock'n'roller whose earliest hits were recorded at Sun Studio alongside Elvis, Johnny Cash, and Carl Perkins, tend to appraise him as the granddaddy of some current trend, like emo, when in fact he is, like Bruce Springsteen or Tom Waits, a more singular artist. With its natural quaver and multi-octave range, his voice allowed him to do things other singers could not, and his best singles pair his stately vocals with equally ornate arrangements. However, if indie musicians wanted to shelve their copies of Pet Sounds and Born to Run for a few years and start taking notes on Orbison, not only would that make my job a whole lot more interesting, but The Soul of Rock and Roll would be the place for them to start. This 4xCD box set is the most expansive and exhaustive summary of Orbison's decades-long career, which had its share of ups (the early 1960s, the late 80s) and downs (the 70s) and ended on an impossibly high note with his 1989 best-selling album Mystery Girl and his work with the Traveling Wilburys. Most Orbison comps begin at Sun Studio, with tender teenage hits ""Devil Doll"" and ""Ooby Dooby"" (Orbison may be the only singer who can make those two syllables not sound sexual and still sound interesting), but this set finds life before Memphis. Orbison was a guitar slinger with the Teen Kings in the early 50s, drawing from vocal groups, country and western, and rockabilly without really synthesizing them. Perhaps the most revealing track is ""Guitar Pull Medley"", a previously unreleased nine-minute recording of Orbison, by request, ripping through covers like ""I Want You, I Need You, I Love You"" and ""That's All Right"" at a party, proving he could hold his own against his more popular labelmate Elvis. Orbison's cool and easy proficiency with so many songs contrasts with his companion's starry-eyed demeanor. It sounds like a scene from Robert Altman's Nashville. The Soul of Rock and Roll is broken down primarily by decade-- a logical organizing principle even if it doesn't actually fit his career very precisely. Still, that means the second disc is far and away the best here, with a run of hits for Nashville-based Monument Records that's about as close to perfect as possible. ""Uptown"", ""Only the Lonely"", ""Blue Angel"", ""In Dreams"", and ""Running Scared"" (a modified bolero) are grandiose and operatic, lushly arranged, cleverly recorded (all in one take, with no overdubs), and as genuinely moving as pop music can be. Cathedrals to heartbreak, these early Monument recordings represent not only the set's high point, but the heyday of Orbison's career and the era that defined the rest of his catalog. The rest of his 60s output follows the same template, as Orbison and producer Fred Foster give similar treatment to ""All I Have to Do Is Dream"", the gorgeous ""Blue Bayou"", and the Willie Nelson-penned ""Pretty Paper"". The third disc covers Orbison's 70s output, but almost all of these songs predate that decade by several years. Following the deaths of his first wife in a motorcycle accident and two of his sons in a house fire, he spent most of the 70s away from the spotlight, but The Soul of Rock and Roll uses that downtime to argue convincingly that his strengths as a balladeer were matched by his prowess as a guitarist and his power as a performer. From 1963, his cover of ""Mean Woman Blues"", with its relentless beat, effervescent sha-la-la backing vocals, and yakkety sax, actually swings, especially on his fiery guitar solo. And his take on Ray Charles' ""What'd I Say"", recorded live in Holland, stomps and shimmies like his early rockabilly material. The final chapter is far and away the most surprising, a plot twist that no one could have predicted: Instead of fading away like, say, Carl Perkins, Orbison launched an improbable late-in-life comeback that's all the more remarkable for breezily updating his signature style while sidestepping bland dinosaur rock. ""You Got It"" and ""She's a Mystery to Me"", both from his swan song Mystery Girl, show only a few new wrinkles in his voice, which add texture and authority. His new recordings of ""Oh Pretty Woman"" and ""In Dreams"", both for his 1987 greatest hits album, of course can't improve on the originals, but aren't the disasters most re-recordings turn out to be. And Orbison is perfectly at home with the Traveling Wilburys on ""Not Alone Anymore"", although his verse on ""Handle With Care"" makes that song a notable omission in this set. The worst I can say about The Soul of Rock and Roll is that the liner notes are particularly unrevealing, a missed opportunity. An artist like Orbison, who despite his success haunts the periphery of rock history, not the center, demands a more balanced and in-depth approach that can contextualize his music without resorting to namedropping and can relate meaningful commentary without resorting to anecdote. Missing that textual component, the set loses some of its impact, but Orbison's songs-- at once modest and grandiose, showy and private-- provide all the testimony he needs.","This 4xCD box set is the most expansive and exhaustive summary of the rock'n'roll legend's long career, which had its share of ups and downs and ended on an impossibly high note with his 1989 album Mystery Girl and his work with the Traveling Wilburys.

Road to Till the Casket Drops,Clipse,by: Tom Breihan,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929be38ea9e61561daa787f/1:1/w_160/9a9836d6.jpg,2008-12-11 06:00:01,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12496-road-to-till-the-casket-drops/,self-released,"The first skit on the new Clipse mixtape is a genuine-sounding voicemail message from actress Lauren London. ""Can you make something for the girls?"" she asks. ""Like, we so pretty in our Louis Vuitton?"" One track later, the brothers Thornton repurpose the airily gorgeous beat from Slim's ""So Fly"" to snarl nihilistically empty sex-talk: ""Not do demean 'em, but that's just how we seen 'em/ Trading bitches off since balling was buying Zimas."" As the track ends, Pusha T cackles viciously: ""See, sis? We do girl records, right?"" Watch what you wish for, I guess. Thing is, once upon a time, Clipse were able to do girl records, or something like them, anyway, in a way that didn't just turn the songs into morbid jokes. With breakout single ""Grindin'"", Malice and Pusha established the dead-eyed coke-talk they're still running with six years later. But they also made ""When the Last Time"", one of this century's greatest club jams. On that and a handful of other Lord Willin' tracks-- songs released in 2002, when the duo had something to do with the commercial rap landscape-- Clipse seemed totally genuine talking about how club night was one of the reasons they loved life, and their cold monotones worked just as well on frothy dance-pop tracks as on harshly mechanical tough-guy shit. That was them on Justin Timberlake's ""Like I Love You"", after all. That Clipse is gone now. In the intervening years, they've left rap's mainstream behind completely, becoming internet cult heroes by diligently and eloquently pursuing two basic subjects: selling drugs and the money that comes with it. This has made for some ferociously exciting music, as on long-delayed sophomore album Hell Hath No Fury and the now-classic We Got It 4 Cheap, Vol. 2 mixtape. But they've been hammering away at those two subjects with single-minded focus for years now, and the wear is starting to show. It wouldn't be fair to call Road to Till the Casket Drops, their new mixtape, a disappointment. After all, this is a brisk half-hour of free new music from one of rap's greatest groups. The Got It 4 Cheap, Vol. 3 mixtape, released earlier this year, dwelled hard on Fury's disappointing sales and leaned a bit too much on underwhelming original beats. But now they're back on their Vol. 2 shit, hijacking up-to-the-moment rap-radio fodder (featherweight synth-tracks like Ryan Leslie's ""Addiction"" and Ron Browz's ""Pop Champagne"", clattering trunk-rattle shit like ""Swagger Like Us"" and T.I.'s ""Swing Ya Rag""). More often than not, they blow away the originals. Re-Up Gang associate Sandman, the weakest link in the extended group, has left, and so now we get an undiluted blast of pure Thornton brothers along with a couple of guest appearances from Re-Up survivor Ab-Liva, whose verse over the ""Pop Champagne"" beat is a thing of breathless beauty. And Malice and Pusha just have incredible voices, precise and almost technically fussy flows that can drip with contempt like nobody since circa-1999 Jay-Z. So yeah, a new Clipse mixtape is always a good thing, well worth your half-hour and zero dollars. But Road to Till the Casket Drops finds Clipse spinning their wheels a bit. That's understandable; when you've spent years working hard to come up with convoluted cocaine punchlines, it makes sense that the well would be running dry. But every previous Clipse release, official and otherwise, was so jammed with great lines that it could be tough picking out moments to quote. On this one, the best line comes on the first track. Pusha: ""It's the hood's Obama, shoveling McCain/ Out the project windows, the drama's insane."" Pusha aims a few unwieldy darts at Lil Wayne, which seems a bit pointless; only Wayne is going to end Wayne's hot streak. ""Feds Taking Pictures"" starts with a long list of shoutouts to specific drug dealers, which isn't all that interesting unless you happen to be one of those drug dealers. Again, I'm mostly just quibbling here. This is a quickie mixtape intended to celebrate the launch of Clipse's new clothing line Play Cloths, which is unfortunately saddled with both one of the worst names and worst logos in rapper-clothing-line history. As a quickie mixtape, it beats the everliving fuck out of virtually all its mixhut competition. A lot of this stuff was probably recorded on a tight schedule, relatively tossed-off. But nothing these guys did used to sound tossed-off. And maybe by the time they release their next album (next year, lord willin'), Clipse should look beyond the corner and make a few tracks that don't revolve around white powder. Like, for instance, maybe some girl songs. Just a thought.","A quickie free mixtape intended to celebrate the launch of Clipse's new clothing line Play Cloths, Road to Till the Casket Drops is well worth your half-hour and zero dollars.

TV Loves You Back,Restiform Bodies,by: Roque Strew,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929be33abf31b7dc71560f5/1:1/w_160/c08dfb31.jpg,2008-12-10 06:00:05,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12491-tv-loves-you-back/,Anticon,"California is a big state. And hip-hop aficionados, with their firm sense of place, tie Oakland to a unique style of rap that bears little resemblance to its famous counterpart in Los Angeles. The brightest lights of the Bay Area, E-40 and Too $hort, never fully bought into the dark, trigger-happy sensationalism of the Death Row artists: Guns simply weren't part of their vision of, or path to, the good life. Emphasizing the joy of letting loose, the hyphy movement that sprang up a few years ago only cemented the scene's drama-free outlook. But Oakland's Restiform Bodies are agitators. And what better place for this hall of modest fame-- the indie-rap supergroup of Passage, Bomarr Monk, and Telephone Jim Jesus-- than Anticon? Their debut on the label, TV Loves You Back, presents a furious, righteous, and not entirely subtle dissatisfaction with capitalism. Thanks to the recent tumult in the world's markets, the album, like the DNC platform, has an added punch of timeliness. To be fair, mindless consumerism is more the target here than, say, overly leveraged banks. In short, the rappers mount their attack on low culture, not high finance. ""Consumer Culture Wave"" suggests a fight-the-Man mission with its title. Luckily, the song is better than that, too gloriously strange and oblique to be pressed into the service of jam-band leftism. (Love and gender seem to be the real subject, anyway.) Better to revel in the fluorescent textures and spastic rhythms, an accurate evocation of life in the attention-deficient multimedia slipstream, than to grope for political provocations in the lyrics. After all, it would have sufficed to attack QVC in only one song, you'd think. Docking too many points here isn't fair, anyway: Laid out on the page, even the best songs forfeit their essence. But when you spit nonsense with the apocalyptic ferocity of El-P, in many ways the hyperpolitical white rapper's template, that nonsense may as well be scripture. Ever eager to disquiet, the Bodies even stoke the listener's anxieties about machines (on the sludgy, horror-string-laced ""Pick It Up, Drop It"") and modern medicine (""Ameriscan""). If there's a paranoid style in American hip-hop, this may be its purest expression. Nodding to the post-Thanksgiving virus that turns the lanes of Wal-Mart into the Ben-Hur chariot race, ""Black Friday"" bounces between drum'n'bass speed and trip-hop languor to manic-depressively link consumerism and domestic life. That the Bodies lean on everything from the New Romantics to crunk to post-rock to ghettotech to paint this cultural self-portrait only amplifies the strangeness-- and accuracy-- of TV Loves You Back. ""Movies are for entertainment,"" Louis B. Mayer famously stated. ""If you want to send a message, send a telegram."" The role of art isn't quite that narrow, of course, but the legendary producer knew that audiences didn't want to be lectured. And sadly that's what a lot of independent rap does. The Restiform Bodies avoid this. As Passage put it: ""All the information on TV Loves You Back is stuff I'm trying to make peace with as a person, and that I think we all have to make peace with as a society."" That sums up why the record is not only digestible, but outright luscious. We're not watching a presentation or reading a complaint. We're not being condemned for watching ""The Hills"". We're living, for a YouTube minute, inside three minds warped and wracked by our national addiction to the screen. It's equal parts unsightly and arresting in the way that most pathologies are.","An indie-rap supergroup of sorts, this Anticon act presents a furious, righteous, and not entirely subtle dissatisfaction with capitalism.

1970's Algerian Proto-Raï Underground,Various Artists,by: Joshua Klein,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929be30ea9e61561daa7871/1:1/w_160/954e925f.jpg,2008-12-10 06:00:04,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12487-1970s-algerian-proto-rai-underground/,Sublime Frequencies,"There are any number of reasons why certain bands and singers fall into obscurity-- it's not always due to lack of impact, importance, or even something as practical as distribution. Sometimes they disappear because they're made to disappear. In the case of raï, Algeria's vibrant hybrid of Middle Eastern and European folk, its subject matter and party vibe often made the music a target in post-colonial Algeria, with former FLN fighter and later the nation's Marxist leader Houari Boumédienne not as huge a fan of free speech as he was of suppressing it. Of course, raï never vanished. Every bit the people's music as much as punk or hip-hop, raï had flourished for decades before the government brought the hammer down-- and even then it merely moved underground; it's from those years that Sublime Frequencies' vinyl-only 1970's Algerian Proto-Raï Underground compiles (thanks to Hicham Chadly) eight festive horn (and, in one case, electric guitar) adorned tracks from four Algerian acts. These rough hewn recordings sound like they were surreptitiously recorded at some wedding or street party, full as they are of pounding percussion, bleating brass, humming organ or accordion, and full-throated Arabic vocals. Translations of the titles reveal a quotidian truth to the songs: Bellemou & Benfissa's ""Li Maandouche L'Auto"", for example, translates roughly to ""He Who Doesn't Own a Car"" (it's about drunk driving, and features ""Father of Raï"" Messaoud Bellemou, whose L'Orchestre Bellemou updated many traditional Algerian melodies for modern ears). Boutaiba Sghir's ""Dayha Oulabes"" is perhaps more universally resonant as ""I'll Marry Her Whether They Like It or Not"", while Groupe El Azhar's ""Mazal Nesker Mazal"" becomes the remarkably descriptive ""I'm Still Getting Drunk...Still"". Cheb Zergui's ""Ana Dellali"" means, straightforwardly enough, ""I Cuddle Myself"". The late-70s track ""Ana Dellali"" is the most striking track on the comp, given its psychedelic wah-wah guitar and dub-wise bass. The rest of the set is more slice of life. Culled from long-forgotten 45s, this collection plays like a snapshot of what one imagines might have been found performed in cabarets or blaring in a some backroom Oran jukebox when the long arm of the law was looking the other way. Given the subsequent global spread of raï and the international success of several bona fide raï stars, archivists, DJs and treasure hunters would be wise to dispatch their best vinyl hounds to the city forthright, in search of more gems likes these, just waiting to be dusted off and discovered anew.","Every bit the people's music as much as punk or hip-hop, raï has been flourishing for decades, even after post-colonial Marxist governments pushed it underground.

BM,Barbara Morgenstern,by: Joe Colly,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929be31abf31b7dc71560ed/1:1/w_160/2064a74b.jpg,2008-12-10 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12488-bm/,Monika,"Toiling for almost a decade on Gudrun Gut's Monika imprint, singer, pianist, and producer Barbara Morgenstern has continually evolved her sound, from the bleepy indie electronica of her early days to a more confident brand of techno pop in recent years. Despite her progress, it wasn't until 2006's quasi-breakout single ""The Operator"" that folks outside her hometown scene in Berlin began to take notice. During those years as electro-pop's underappreciated shapeshifter, she gradually began to focus more on her own unique vocals, and now they serve as the central component (alongside the piano) of her current material. Morgenstern's fifth solo album, BM (her initials, naturally), is the artist's most personal yet, and finds her further shedding the digital elements of her previous records. While her present tracks could fairly be described as avant-pop (think newcomer Lia Ices or Björk, even), Morgenstern is undoubtedly an electronic musician at heart. Even mostly organic numbers like album opener ""Driving My Car"" follow the build-and-release configuration so distinct to techno. In this song and others, instruments introduce themselves progressively at staggered intervals before congregating at a chorus or a stirring coda. ""Reich und Berühmt"" (""Rich and Famous"") shares this quality, its stiff drums and treated guitars joining together with Morgenstern's emotive coos during an anthemic chorus section. These complex arrangements add distinctiveness to BM but also a hint of inaccessibility; the record sometimes feels difficult to penetrate. That's not to say that BM is any less accomplished than past triumphs Nichts Muss or The Grass Is Always Greener, even if it's far less immediate. Morgenstern is more ambitious here and stingier with moments of melodic sweetness; as such, there's nothing as instantly compelling or hooky as ""The Operator"" on this album. ""Morbus Basedow"" probably comes closest, with its aggressive beat pattern that brings to mind the wallop of 2006's extraterrestrial banger ""Get UR Fleece On"" from Glasgow-based producer Izu. Outside of this lone club moment, though, BM is principally concerned with drawing emotion and intimacy from its circuitous instrumentals and technically intricate vocal pop. In aesthetic terms, the record feels crafted with wintertime night drives in mind; its coloring and textures are classically (and unmistakably) German. Haunting and guitar driven, ""Come to Berlin"" utilizes Low-era Bowie/Eno arrangements to appraise her currently fashionable city. When Morgenstern asks her audience, ""Isn't Berlin the place to be?"" there's more than a touch of sarcasm in her query. At times the personal becomes political, and on ""Camouflage"", a darkly romantic duet with Robert Wyatt that took form over mail correspondence, the singer offers a skeptical stance on spirituality. Over a spooky, piano-based backdrop, she intertwines her vocals with Wyatt's to argue, ""Belief is just a camouflage for fear."" Combined with BM's chilly sonic underpinnings, the lyrical content of these tracks might imply a coldness or detachment, but Morgenstern's desire here to examine both internal and social conflicts (not to mention the urgency of her singing and piano playing) suggest that she's as engaged as ever. BM's difficult instrumental pieces are no less adventurous than its electro- and piano-pop moments and contribute to the album's tendency, at times, to feel unnecessarily heady. Asymmetrical and vocal-less, ""My Velocity"" layers crashing piano noises with screeching guitars overtop an insistent digital drumbeat. It's the sort of conceptual number that fascinates me on first listen and then instantly dives into the never-listen-again section of my brain. Songs like this and others such as ""Hustefuchs"" that seek to frighten and confound make for an effort that swaps a good portion of its approachability for creative advancement. That's a trade-off that close followers of indie and electronic music are inclined to celebrate, even though (or perhaps because) it will scare away most of the general public. But BM is an album that even daring listeners will need to sit with for four, five listens before getting comfortable. In an age of vast, immediate file sharing and countless other options such as, I dunno, Chinese Democracy, it may not get its due.","The Berlin-based producer here embraces a heady avant-pop approach, using electronics sparingly as she moves her voice and piano work to the center of her music.

Universal Mind Control,Common,by: Brian Howe,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929be48c0084474cd0c2e74/1:1/w_160/a7e99491.jpg,2008-12-10 06:00:02,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12508-universal-mind-control/,Geffen,"On a song called ""Announcement"" from his eighth LP, Universal Mind Control, Common raps, ""I still love H.E.R., she be needin' the dick/ When it comes to hip-hop, it's just me and my bitch."" He's referring to his 1994 song ""I Used to Love H.E.R."", where he began to seriously define himself as a moralistic foil to the gangster rap phenomenon. The reference seems ironic on an album this vacuous and amoral. Then again, the song has been ironic from the start. In conflating hip-hop's downfall with that of a loose woman, Common succumbed to a definitive moral hazard-- misogyny-- of the gangster rap he railed against. During the last faint reverberations of hip-hop's so-called golden age, this odd blend of puritanical defiance and doomed acquiescence wasn't unusual. Notice how, on A Tribe Called Quest's ""Check the Rhime"", Phife goes from ""have all my hos in check"" to ""my aura's positive, I don't promote no junk"" in three seconds flat. Common emerged (as Common Sense) at the tail end of Afrocentric rap's heyday, which helped him escape obsolescence as his peers fell by the wayside. Treading the precarious line between positive maverick and mainstream star has defined him for his entire career. On Be and Finding Forever, with assistance from Kanye West, he struck a winning, humanizing balance between moralism and hedonism, proving that the two needn't be mutually exclusive. But on Universal Mind Control, his personalities split off into what seem like two wildly different EPs, one awful and one tepid. The awful half is the first one, a bizarre concoction of featherweight electro, sex raps à la LL Cool J, ""Sir Psycho Sexy""-era Red Hot Chili Peppers, party-starting clichés, and interminable A-A-A-A rhyme patterns that were fresh circa ""Rapper's Delight"". Putting aside the obvious laziness of Common's lyrics and the Neptunes' production, it seems more than anything like a profound failure of self-awareness. On the title track, Pharrell informs us that ""This is that new shit and it don't feel the same,"" which Common contradicts with an almost satirically old-school ""dang diggy dang da-dang da-dang dang."" ""Punch Drunk Love (The Eye)"" is just cynical, with its throwaway Kanye hook (gotta get him in the credits somehow) and buried Auto-Tuned singing by Pharrell. ""Make My Day"" benefits from a jovial Cee-Lo cameo and a spry jackhammer beat by Mr. DJ that a harder rapper would eat up, but Common needs warm, soulful beats to thrive, and he mostly sounds lost here. At least the inane lyrics (""Baby girl I'm a man/ And we can do this my way/ Take a ride on the highway/ And pretend that it's Friday... and it is!"") gain some incidental surging effects from Mr. DJ's efforts. The ugly, blocky nadir ""Sex 4 Suga"" sounds like an Andy Samberg parody. Things settle down a little with ""Announcement"", but you know you've got a problem when a Pharrell verse actually livens up your song. The tepid second half is oddly something of a relief. Common shows signs of life on ""Gladiator"", surging powerfully over noir strings and jittery piano, but comparing yourself to Nelson Mandela-- not to mention ""a radical"" who ""don't fit the game""-- is a tough sell on this record. At least Common sounds comfortable amid the breezy chimes and canned platitudes. A perfunctory Obama shout-out on ""Changes"" finds Common taking a rare glimpse outside of himself, but it's too little, too late. Universal Mind Control is a painful misstep from a talented rapper who's decided to be as nasty as he wants to be-- which turns out to be much, much nastier than we'd like.","On Be and Finding Forever, Common struck a winning, humanizing balance between moralism and hedonism, proving that the two needn't be mutually exclusive.

Brighten the Corners: Nicene Creedence Ed.,Pavement,by: Stuart Berman,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929be3cabf31b7dc7156102/1:1/w_160/07a11f33.jpeg,2008-12-10 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12499-brighten-the-corners-nicene-creedence-ed/,MatadorMatador,"For a band that often seemed be on the verge of a commercial breakthrough, Pavement made all the right moves-- they just did them in the wrong order. With its crystalline production (courtesy of R.E.M. architect Mitch Easter and Bryce Goggin) and more refined songcraft, Pavement's 1997 release Brighten the Corners was the logical follow-up to 1994's indie hit Crooked Rain, Crooked Rain. But of course, that move from A to B took a tangential turn back to Z with 1995's notoriously slapdash Wowee Zowee, an album beloved by the band's diehard fans, but one that effectively squandered any crossover potential Crooked Rain might have built up (and which would've made a lot more sense as Crooked Rain's predecessor than successor). Brighten the Corners' more focused, melodic approach could thus be heard as the sound of Pavement making amends, but it arguably came too late-- by 1997, modern-rock radio was already tuning out brainy indie-rock in favour of pre-fab pop-punk and numbskull nu-metal. Pavement understood this shift all to well, which could be why Brighten the Corners sounds like their most self-aware and, by extension, honest album-- when Stephen Malkmus yells, ""listen to me, I'm on the stereo!"" on the album's excitable opening track, it's with the implicit knowledge that he'd have to settle for hearing himself on his home hi-fi rather than on KROQ. Perhaps as an attempt to reconnect with their pre-Wowee Zowee catalogue, Brighten the Corners takes various structural cues from previous Pavement albums: as on 1992's Slanted and Enchanted, the second song fades into a brief instrumental; the slowly intensifying mid-song jam on third track ""Transport Is Arranged"" sounds like it was grafted from Crooked Rain's own third track ""Stop Breathin""; and Malkmus still couldn't resist the glaring name-drop (though Crooked Rain's now-dated Stone Temple Pilots/Smashing Pumpkins swipes were replaced by more eternal ruminations about the peculiar oration of Geddy Lee). Consistent with this self-reflexivity, Malkmus cheekily addresses his own status as the most overanalyzed lyricist in 90s indie-rock, describing himself as ""an island of such great complexity,"" declaring that ""if my soul has a shape, well, then it is an ellipse,"" and even raging that he's ""sick of being misread by men in dashikis and their leftist weeklies."" (That said, it would take 11 years and one ridiculous Republican campaign to lend any significance to the line ""there's no women in Alaska."") The May 1997 Alex Ross New Yorker essay that accompanies this reissue-- the fourth in Matador's superlative series of Pavement packages-- focuses on Malkmus' lyrical gift for extracting substance out of nonsense, and the folly of trying to saddle it with literal interpretations. But on no other Pavement album do all those bon mots and non sequitirs form such a coherent picture of the band's emotional state. Even the album title-- the only one that doesn't rely on rhymes and/or alliteration-- is telling: Rather than re-ignite the band's commercial prospects, Brighten the Corners marked the beginning of Pavement's slow fade into the sunset, while shedding light on its principal songwriter's future course. Not coincidentally, both Malkmus and co-founder Scott ""Spiral Stairs"" Kannberg turned 30 during the album's recording, and both sound consumed by all the melancholy, anxiety, loaded significance, and renewed perspective that life-change carries. Malkmus' charming, chiming ""Shady Lane"" reasserts the ""settle down"" sentiment of Crooked Rain's ""Range Life"", and ""Transport Is Arranged"" seems to address the historically conflicted dynamic between relationships and life on the road (""a voice coach taught me to sing, he couldn't teach me to love""); Kannberg's two exemplary contributions-- the Big Starry-eyed power-pop rush ""Date w/ Ikea"" and the smooth Stonesy funk of ""Passat Dream""-- equate responsibility and commitment with consumerism. Easter and Goggin's luminous production casts this wistfulness in an appropriately soft-focus lens; in return, the band, so scatterbrained on Wowee Zowee, turn in their most pleasingly patient performances of their career, establishing a deeper sense of space through the use of mellotrons, drum-machine breaks and synths set on ""swoosh."" The dreamily drifty centerpiece track ""Type Slowly"" now sounds like a dry run for the sort of exploratory jams Malkmus would fashion in his post-Pavement band the Jicks (a point driven home by the extended, more volcanic live version included here), while the closing two jangle ballads, ""Starlings of the Slipstream"" and ""Fin"" are two of the most affecting songs in the Pavement canon, each appended with guitar solos that compensate for Malkmus' still-developing chops with genuinely pained expression. If ""Fin"" didn't prove to be the band's actual swan song, the track does sound like a farewell to Pavement's wiseacre persona. But if Brighten the Corners signaled a turn to the serious, the 32 outtakes and radio-session cuts compiled here give Pavement plenty of room to, as one B-side aptly puts it, ""fuck around."" Which means indie-rock in-jokes (the Pussy Galore pastiche of ""Neil Hagerty Meets Jon Spencer in a Non-Alcoholic Bar""), 1960s pop goofs (""Nigel""), cartoon themes (two stabs at ""Space Ghost""), and kill-yr-idols covers of the Clean (Kannberg's electro-fried take on ""Oddity""), Echo and the Bunnymen (a Crazy Horsed interpretation of ""The Killing Moon""), and heroes-turned-nemeses the Fall (a gleeful desecration of the already blasphemous ""The Classical""). And in the seven-minute rough cut of stoner-rock dirge ""(And Then) The Hexx"" and the freewheeling biker-bar boogie of ""Roll With the Wind"", you can hear Malkmus moving ever closer to adopting his future role as beardless-hippie guitar hero. According to the liner notes, ""(And Then) The Hexx"" was originally intended to be Brighten the Corners' opener, but its sinister creep would've made an awkward introduction to the album's more winsome, mellowed-out material. (The song eventually surfaced on 1999's Terror Twilight.) However, that same rationale might also explain why the terrific ""Harness Your Hopes"" was demoted to B-side status, it being perhaps the most typically Pavementy Pavement song ever: the reductive, repetitive Velvet Underground riff; the rhyme-a-second wordplay (""nun is to church as the parrot is to perch""); and a line that seemingly sums up the band's conflicted, outsider relationship with the pop world-- ""Show me/ A word that rhymes with Pavement."" Given that Brighten the Corners captured Malkmus trying to break free from Pavement's established aesthetic-- and given that, two years later at London's Brixton Acadmey, he would famously sum up his feelings about the band by waving a pair of handcuffs-- the word he was looking for was under his nose along: enslavement.","Matador's deluxe Pavement reissue campaign continues with Brighten the Corners, the underrated record that signaled the group's turn toward the serious and mature. Also included are 32 outtakes and radio-session cuts that more accurately reflect the loose, ramshackle feel of the group's early-to-mid 1990s work.

Japanese Motors,Japanese Motors,by: Adam Moerder,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bdc413d197565213b5f7/1:1/w_160/a9c643b9.jpg,2008-12-09 06:00:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12486-japanese-motors/,Vice,"You can fault Japanese Motors for many things on their self-titled debut, but you can't accuse them of pushing a product that doesn't actually exist. As fantastical as their depiction of West Coast surfing life is, they're only writing what they know. Frontman Alex Knost is a former pro surfer who appeared in the 2003 surf documentary Step into Liquid while drummer Andrew Atkinson's a former designer for the surf clothing company Hurley. To top it off, they look like the male cast of ""The Hills"". As for the actual music, you could attach ""West Coast version of-"" to nearly any current ""garage""-but-not-made-in-a-garage act and be accurate. There's the transparent Strokes rip ""Regrets a Paradise"", which features Knost borrowing Julian Casablancas' megaphone and pack-a-day habit. Carefree ""Single Fins & Safety Pins"" takes its cues from labelmates the Black Lips, keeping its sun-soaked guitar parts simple enough to play while drinking a beer. While those cuts are merely underwhelming and escapist, their more in-your-face retro tracks reek of posturing: ""Coors Lite"" and ""B.N.E."" are convinced there's still a Jet fan inside each of us. ""B.N.E."", with its bluesy chorus of ""She wants a brand new everything,"" gets wise to this whole superficial, materialistic SoCal culture-- an observation that's been made in like a hundred jagillion (I checked) works of art in the last century. The rest of the album wades in even safer and more comfortable waters. You could peg ballads ""Oh Brother"" or ""Misery & Profits"" as doo-wop nostalgia channeled through T. Rex, but the band's beach-bum work ethic can't muster the energy to pull off glam. It's a double-edged sword, because while the band's lazy minimalism deprives them of possessing any real strengths, it at least prevents any Louis XIV-sized missteps. The debut's boring, not awful, but until the band stops sounding like they have a hundred cooler things to do than be in a studio, it's hard to imagine them as anything more than surf muzak.","Fronted by a former pro surfer and fleshed out by a bunch of dudes who look like the male cast of ""The Hills"", Japanese Motors sound like a West Coast version of the Strokes or Black Lips.

Everything/Everything,Simon Bookish,by: Matthew Solarski,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929be2a13d197565213b6c7/1:1/w_160/a53afd5f.jpg,2008-12-09 06:00:04,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12480-everythingeverything/,Tomlab,"In a musical economy where ideas are the sole currency, Simon Bookish would be doing the Scrooge McDuck backstroke through a pool of cartoon coins right about now. The man's recordings abound in little innovations, both sonic and lyrical, and if Everything/Everything sounds particularly heavy on them, that's no coincidence: the record, a self-described ""big band song cycle,"" deals with the onslaught of information in this modern age. Accordingly, the music on Everything runs the gamut, with touches of kraut/motorik (""Portrait of the Artist as a Fountain"") and Gang of Four-descended post-punk (""Alsatian Dog"") rubbing up against plenty of Reich/Glass modular flourishes (a good two-thirds of the tracks) and even a splash of the baroque (""Il Trionfo del Tempo...[Ridley Road]""). Much has been made of Bookish's decision to eschew the electronic instrumentation that dominated his first two albums-- 2006's aggro-electro opus Unfair/Funfair and 2007's frequently brilliant if uneven Trainwreck/Raincheck-- in favor of the more organic sounds of the pianos, saxophones, Farfisa organs, harps, and chirpy brass section that color Everything. By and large Bookish employs his new toys to good effect: the polyphony of voice, backing chorus, piano, and brass during the refrain of opening track ""The Flood"" sounds positively euphoric, while ""Synchrotron"" drops thick, excited sax over rolling piano and a bed of Stereolab-like Farfisa to emerge as one of the record's highlights. This kitchen-sink musical approach makes sense in light of the subject matter, which, while it might not encompass everything, sure comes close. ""Carbon"" builds a chorus out of Albert Einstein's apparent words to Buckminster Fuller-- ""Young man, you amaze me!""-- tucked between imagery of various forms of the life-giving element. ""A Crack in Larsen C"" uses a disintegrating ice shelf as a springboard for a moody meditation on end times (""Will the future crash in the next five minutes/ And if it does, will we be burning or frozen?""), while ""Victorinox"" has Bookish seemingly commenting on the Swiss policy of neutrality one moment (""Try to ignore the drum sound...the place where you live is under attack"") and delighting in wordplay (""Monstrous animosity/ Rhinoceros of animus"") the next. Astronomy, television culture, publishing, oceanology, particle physics, and the evolution of language come into play as well, as do such fun vocab words as ""apogee,"" ""damask,"" and ""meniscus."" If this all sounds a little overwhelming, well, that's the point. Everything's one shortcoming is that it can occasionally feel cold and clinical, a feeling underscored by Bookish's authoritative baritone. That voice was slightly better suited to the stream-of-consciousness spoken word narratives on Trainwreck/Raincheck and the more sadomasochistic moments of Unfair/Funfair than to these avant-pop ditties. And despite Bookish's newfound penchant for pop song structures, his music still isn't nearly as accessible as that of fellow classically-trained tunesmiths Patrick Wolf and Owen Pallett/Final Fantasy-- which may explain his lower profile among fans of orchestral indie pop. And although it's unfocused by design, Everything is still unfocused. Which is not to say it's inconsistent: a major improvement in this regard over Trainwreck-- which meandered off into ambient oblivion on its final four tracks-- Everything is markedly well assembled. Its mellower material (""Il Trionfo"", ""Larsen C"") is deftly sequenced amid its peppier numbers, and ""The Flood"" and closing track ""Colophon"" serve as fine bookends for the whole concept. Indeed, it's the confusion and ambivalence that proceeds it that allows Bookish's final declaration on that closing track to ring loud and clear: ""Not too late to rewrite history/ Not too late to save ourselves/ Not too late to pull this species above, beyond."" Ultimately we're left with something not unlike the age it addresses: easily marveled at, not always so easily engaged with, and yet with much to offer to those willing to make the effort.","The eccentric Englishman, who has worked with Saint Etienne and remixed Grizzly Bear and Franz Ferdinand, embraces organic instrumentation and pop song structure on this kitchen-sink examination of the Information Age.

Brown Submarine,Boston Spaceships,by: Paul Thompson,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bdc1ea9e61561daa778b/1:1/w_160/cc3cfb27.jpg,2008-12-09 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12490-brown-submarine/,"Guided By Voices, Inc.","For a while there, it's seemed the template for the lion's share of Bob Pollard's post-Guided by Voices material was the 2003 effort Earthquake Glue. To these ears, Earthquake Glue has always seemed like a bloated, proggy affair frontloaded with a few winners but bogged down by a glut of unsteady melodies, unshapely guitars, and hooks that never quite come around. These markers have followed Pollard to varying degrees ever since, and last year's one-two punch of Standard Gargoyle Decisions and Coast to Coast Carpet of Love was the nadir of that particular style: the simultaneous release of two gangly records didn't work for Springsteen or Elvis Costello, and it sure as hell wasn't about to restore ever-shakier faith in the fate of our Fading Captain. In 2008, Pollard seemed to free himself from the Earthquake Glue muck. Could be that raiding the archives in preparation for January's enjoyably stupid ""old songs, new parts"" curio Superman Was a Rocker reminded the dude of what's been missing, but whatever's gotten into him lately will hopefully stick around. This summer's Robert Pollard is Off to Business stands as his most tuneful offering since the last GBV album proper; sure, it leaned a little closer toward the ""Hold on Hope"" schmaltz than, say, the weird poignance of ""The Goldheart Mountaintop Queen Directory"", but you came away from the disc remembering what you'd heard. It had been far too long since he's sustained that over the course of an LP. And now-- and, apparently, for the foreseeable future-- we have the Boston Spaceships, which even Pollard's calling the ""new band."" With long-distance contributions by his Takeovers partner Chris Slusarenko and Decemberists drummer John Moen, Pollard has crafted his liveliest set since late-period GBV banger Universal Truths and Cycles. He's also got a band about as well-suited to his strengths as any he's held since the Tobin ""Due for a Reappraisal"" Sprout days. Moen's got a steady hand or two and a young(er) man's urge to push the songs forward. And Slusarenko and Pollard go back to the last days of GBV, a period that saw that band's simple, stately side occasionally bogged down by the showy (in Pollardworld, that's code for ""infallibly competent"") playing of Doug Gillard. And Brown Submarine is not a showy record. Matching easy Cheap Trick melodies with a slightly sharpened take on his usual logorrhea, the tunes on Brown Submarine go straight for the raised fist and the open heart. With its longer songs, varied textures, and reasonably hi-fi sound, it's a record on the cusp of cohesion with only a modicum of his typical hijinks. If the past few years saw Pollard working through a hyperprolific and confused period, all seems startlingly crystalline here: Brown Submarine is a four-on-the-floor, prefix-optional rock'n'roll record that, unlike virtually all of his recent work save Off to Business, requires no prior investment in Pollard to be worth your coin. Bummer that it kicks off with a bit of a non-starter: ""Winston's Atomic Bird"" is pretty much the chunky stuff of old, built around an acrid hook and the same kind of buildup to nowhere on which those Earthquake Glue tracks relived so heavily. The mercifully short title track does a little better, matching an intentionally dumb lyric with a nifty little guitar turnaround. But ""You Satisfy Me"" does what its title promises, and heartily so; and from there on, Pollard's on a roll, kicking out jam after snappy little jam imbued with genuine urgency and lingering melodic notions. The rockers, you know, rock: ""Ate It Twice"" is a pretty good little punk skiffle, and ""Rat Trap"" clamps down from the onset and doesn't let up long enough to either make sense or get stale. And the ballads, though notably a bit dusty in melodic terms, get over on feeling. The line in ""Two Girl Area"" about Axl Rose will almost certainly run a little deeper through you than anything on Chinese Democracy will, and album highlight (and closer) ""Go For the Exit"" stands as one of the maybe two dozen most memorable songs in Pollard's catalog. Lyrically, Pollard's still as inscrutable and frequently unmemorable as ever-- ""you you you you satisfy me"" and the Axl quip are the most direct things he says over 35 minutes. But after the oft-embarrassing drunk talk that populates recent records like the aforementioned Superman and the Circus Devils' gnarly Sgt. Disco, the relative clarity of vision in Pollard's words seem to match that of his new band's. Plus, if you're this deep into a review of a Bob Pollard record, you know damn well you don't listen to the man to pore over the words. If there's a bone to be picked with the current direction, it's that Brown Submarine like Off to Business, is but a single victory in a larger battle against complacency; the book remains written largely as before, with a few necessarily but hardly radical revisions. The faster stuff is pretty much in line with the key tracks from Mag Earwhig!, and the lesser of the slow jams could very well be on any of the records after Do the Collapse. But in paring down many of the eccentricities that bogged down a lot of the post-GBV work and finding a couple dudes who obviously love and understand what's made Pollard worth the frustrated adulation in the past, they're firing on nearly as many cylinders as anytime since GBV's mid-to-late 90s heyday. If these Spaceships of Pollard's keep killing it live and putting out records worth hearing straight through-- the next one's already due in January--  they can cherry-pick from the best bits from the past all they want.","Robert Pollard's new band with Guided by Voices pal Chris Slusarenko and drummer John Moen of the Decemberists seems to have reinvigorated the prolific songwriter. Shedding the bloat and eccentricities of his recent projects, Brown Submarine is as direct and tuneful as anything since GBV's heyday.

The Finally LP,Mark Kozelek,by: Stephen M. Deusner,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929be35c0084474cd0c2e4d/1:1/w_160/a43ca4b1.jpg,2008-12-09 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12492-the-finally-lp/,Caldo Verde,"As the exec and main signee of Caldo Verde Records, Mark Kozelek can release pretty much whatever he wants. This year alone has seen a full-length by his band Sun Kil Moon, which was packaged with a bonus disc of alternate takes; an LP of live and alternate takes that accompanied the U.S. publication of his book of lyrics; a live EP that came free with purchase at his online store; and finally a covers album. Rather than flood the market or dilute the quality of his output, these releases suggest Kozelek tinkers with his own and others' compositions continuously. In this regard, he's certainly no stranger to the covers album: His first solo release was 2000's Rock 'N' Roll Singer, which included songs by AC/DC and John Denver, and he has since released full-lengths fully devoted to AC/DC and Modest Mouse. But The Finally LP is something a bit different even for him: a record of lovely instrumentals and covers of tracks from tribute and benefit albums. Finally may be LP length but it lacks an album's cohesiveness. There's no big statement here, at least not like there was with April, his second album with Sun Kil Moon. However, the looseness of the tracklist allows him to indulge some punishing metal riffs and howling emo madman vocals. Yeah, right. Kozelek is the king of somber and of course gives these covers his signature reading: slow, melancholy, full of stoic vocals and steady, shimmery guitar. This solemn take doesn't work against the LP, but in its favor. The Finally LP is Kozelek's own tribute of sorts, a nod to his array of idols and influences. The title comes from a song by folk singer Kath Bloom, who has experienced a resurgence of sorts in the past two years. Kozelek covered the song for Loving Takes Its Course: A Tribute to the Songs of Kath Bloom, out next year on her Australian label, Chapter Music. He gives it a tension that wasn't present in the original: Bloom's version was as much a valedictory as the title suggests, but for Kozelek, there are no promises in catharsis and no conclusion in the song. Such dourness, while not unexpected, has always threatened to become Kozelek's default mode, but here his curiously pessimistic interpretation sounds raw and wounded, as if he hasn't yet shaken off the darkness of whatever is finally coming to and end. His ruminative reading of ""New Partner"", from the 2006 comp I Am a Cold Rock, I Am Dull Grass: A Tribute to Will Oldham, develops that theme and storyline, creating an intriguing diptych about loss and renewal. This is an album of transitions. The segue from ""Finally"" into ""New Partner"" gives both songs more impact than they might have otherwise, as does ""Bedtime Lullaby"" into ""Celebrated Summer"". ""Lullaby"" was recorded for an episode of Yo Gabba Gabba!, and this song, along with dancing Nathaniel and a beatboxing lesson from Biz Markie, would argue that it might just be the greatest show ever. If some listeners claim that Kozelek puts them to sleep, he has responded with a song specifically designed to put listeners to sleep. Written by the show's Jarond Gibbs, it makes for a sweet lullaby and leads in nicely to Kozelek's cover of Hüsker Dü's ""Celebrated Summer"", which he slows down to great effect, playing up wistful memories of youth like an adult's lullaby. He's less successful with his cover of Stephen Sondheim's ""Send in the Clowns"", off the charity comp Musicians for Minneapolis: 57 Songs for the I-35 Bridge Disaster Relief Fund. Kozelek grafts an effective descending acoustic riff onto the chorus and adds a slight lilt to the melody, but it's still ""Send in the Clowns"". Low's ""Lazy"" fares better, as Kozelek's voice cracks just enough to convey a strong sense of yearning. His delivery lends added gravity to ""My Friend Bob"", by Dom Leone (not Pitchfork's Dominique Leone, but the late songwriter for Ed's Redeeming Qualities), although his cover of AC/DC's ""If You Want Blood"", recorded for Lisbon radio, isn't appreciably different from the version that appeared on What's Next to the Moon. There's a hodgepodge quality to The Finally LP, but like his recent EPs, bonus discs, and live collections, it proves another essential non-essential.","The Sun Kil Moon/Red House Painters singer-songwriter ends the year with yet another quality release-- this time, a record of lovely instrumentals and covers of tracks from tribute and benefit albums.

A Cross the Universe,Justice,by: Nate Patrin,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929be36eb335119a49ed020/1:1/w_160/b92a3068.jpg,2008-12-09 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12493-a-cross-the-universe/,Atlantic,"A month ago, a photo surfaced of Justice supposedly doing their live set without their MIDI controller plugged in, which led people to conclude that they were perpetrating some kind of fraud. After listening to their new live album A Cross the Universe-- and watching the hour-long tour documentary included with it-- I remain skeptical to this possibility: Maybe the photo's from one of their more disorganized sound checks, or maybe the plug just fell out on its own mid-set. The album gives the former impression, since they sound too dynamic and moment-to-moment to be a canned DAT fronted by a couple of pantomiming phonies. And the latter scenario seems likely after watching the documentary, which depicts Xavier de Rosnay and Gaspard Augé as a couple of disaster-courting goofballs flying by the seats of their pants-- drunk on America, beset by mishaps, and surrounded by lunatics. Of course cords are going to just fall out; everything else about Justice seems to go haywire from time to time. So A Cross the Universe is a fairly interesting take on one of the more controversial electronic acts in years-- interesting, at least, if you're not entirely concerned with a vivid and rich-sounding document of their live show. The funny thing is, neither the album or the documentary portions of A Cross the Universe do the most ideal job of capturing their set, which seems like an intentional anti-hubris move on their part. Justice are still pretty novel, they're still relative outsiders, and they're still interested in being enigmatic-- what's there to do now that they're already pushing a live album right after their debut? So the documentary's all quick-cut behind-the-scenes hijinx with only brief flashes of actual live performance, while the album comes close to sounding like a straight-up low-budget bootleg. The concert portion, recorded in San Francisco in March 2008, is a problem if you're not on board with the idea that the full, epic spectacle of a Justice show can be reduced to an audio quality that sounds slightly better than a YouTube clip. This was a deliberate choice, with the soundboard bypassed for a setup that simply placed several microphones on the stage. The result is an album that seems to be dominated as much by the audience as by the music. It makes for some exhilarating moments: ""We Are Your Friends (Reprise)"" is a perfect call-and-response, and the pops that accompany each moment of recognition give a few vicarious thrills; that first moment of apeshit glee when the Godzilla horns of ""Genesis"" crest over the horizon, quickly followed by an even bigger explosion when the first beat drops, is just about enough to justify the whole setup. But with a fidelity that often reduces the cheering of the crowd to an enthusiastic-sounding static in the noisier moments and makes the notoriously midrange-happy material from † sound even more abrasive, A Cross the Universe sacrifices a lot of listenability. Next to something like Daft Punk's Alive 2007-- which, amongst its many fine qualities, is a hell of a headphone album-- A Cross the Universe is all loudness and no warmth, and sometimes it gets almost unbearably grating; your first impulse while listening to a concert recording from an electronic dance music act shouldn't be to turn the volume down. But if you can ignore a recording ill-suited to handle the force of Justice's arena-sized sound, you'll at least get to hear them find interesting ways to reinvent and refresh their relatively sparse repertoire. Nearly 17 minutes of the set is devoted in some way or fashion to the two-part ""Phantom"" (which gets a ""Part 1.5"" for good measure here), and that mysterious intelligible vocoder hook gets dissected, diced-up, and redistributed over beats that are both more rubbery and more claustrophobically dense than the album version. ""D.A.N.C.E."" is even more radically altered, slowing to a crawl in its first half, then coming out with a more aggressive snarl behind it during the second-- just barely standing on the good side of the ""subvert/ruin"" line, trading its childlike euphoria for a teenage sneer. And if ""Stress"" sounded like a tense, suffocating hornet attack on †, here it's changed into a more wide-open, airplane-hangar-sized anthem, its needling electronic strings transformed into full-fledged Bernard Herrmann-caliber orchestration. The documentary DVD that comes packaged with the album, directed by music video creators Romain Gavras (""Stress"") and So-Me (""DVNO"", ""D.A.N.C.E.""), doesn't offer much for those interested in a live Justice show-- it's mostly concerned with the crazy shit that happens to them between gigs: Gaspard has a Vegas wedding to a woman who disappears the next day, Xavier sings a thickly accented ""Under the Bridge"" to a very uncomfortable-looking Anthony Kiedis, their gun-obsessed tour manager takes them shooting, and all three of them get arrested at the end after Xavier clocks a belligerent, threatening drunk over the head with a bottle. (It also includes one of my new favorite music-doc moments of all time, where Gaspard and Xavier pose for photos with a couple Hooters waitresses as the Count Five's ""Psychotic Reaction"" chugs away in the background. The waitresses are all smiles; Justice couldn't look more disconnected and bored with their surroundings.) What few glimpses there are of their concerts are brief, quickly-cut-- and, like the album, largely focused on picking up the audience reactions. A Cross the Universe isn't close to anyone's definitive idea of what a document of a live Justice show should be, but it's a diverting, sometimes-bizarre look into the first phase of fame for an aughts-era cult pop phenomenon.","Recorded from mics set around the stage rather than the soundboard, this live Justice record is as much about the audience as it is the artist; a DVD documentary adds entertaining on-the-road footage.

Ropechain,Grampall Jookabox,by: Eric Harvey,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929be2bea9e61561daa7869/1:1/w_160/4e098eb3.jpg,2008-12-08 06:00:05,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12481-ropechain/,Asthmatic Kitty,"Those of us born and raised in Indiana, not exactly a farm team for celebrity culture, like to promote those of our own who have made good for themselves: The most commonly cited, at least among my friends, are John Mellencamp (from Seymour), Dave Letterman (Indianapolis), Axl Rose (Lafayette), David Lee Roth and John Darnielle (Bloomington), and of course, Michael Jackson (Gary). David ""Moose"" Adamson, who's been playing around the Hoosier State in various guises for a few years, has turned his affinity for the fallen King of Pop into ""I Will Save Young Michael"", which he's placed at the center of Ropechain, his first album for Indianapolis indie Asthmatic Kitty. ""I know for a fact that you're from Indiana, and so am I. So that makes us brothers,"" he intones in the song's spoken-word outro. Then, his appeal: ""You gotta come back, and dance again, like you used to. Okay? Okay. Good."" Made all the more hopeful by its harmless dopiness-- as a geographically-informed ode to a troubled soul, ""Michael"" sounds like it was written by Sufjan Stevens' dumb-jock older brother after he heard his sibling's ""John Wayne Gacy, Jr.""-- Adamson's plea marks the highpoint of Ropechain's humanity. The rest of the time, it's druggie sentimentality like that of ""You Will Love My Room"": ""I took mushrooms and then proposed to you."" The name Grampall Jookabox itself suggests someone emotionally and creatively frozen as a 19-year old after a Reddi-wip huff, and though Adamson tries the David Thomas/Captain Beefheart unhinged soul-shouter approach on ""Room"", the song registers as a charmless, macho God Ween Satan outtake. ""Black Girls"", which flits through nonsensical utterances like ""black girls build skyscrapers with their brains"" and ""Betty Davis…the black Bette Davis"", is doofy and exploitative, and ""The Girl Ain't Preggers"" exudes the empathy of a checkout-line tabloid headline. The tweaker folk-psych goof ""The One Thing"" affirms most clearly that Adamson doesn't have much to say: Like that one guy senior year who preferred Xanax and Beam cocktails, Adamson repeats the titular phrase without ever telling us what that thing exactly is, let alone why it's worth writing a song about. I imagine him falling asleep sitting up while singing the hook ad infinitum. Yet despite its many faults, Ropechain is a hard record to hate: ""Thing"" has a solid groove, and the ridiculous, pointless lyrics of ""Black Girls"" only draw attention away from the tight, chirpy backmasked loop spinning out over a bleak, funky industrial bed, which made me type ""Anticonye West"" in my notes. Good ideas lurk throughout the album, but they either disappear under the weight of too much echo and overdubbing, or get pushed aside as a result of what I'd imagine is either a lack of discipline or dissenting voice during the creative process. Appropriately, ""Let's Go Mad Together""-- a kitschy, fun sci-fi choogle during which Adamson attempts scat-singing but achieves a boorish stutter-- sounds like the desperate product of being alone for too long, perhaps near a MacBook and GarageBand. Partially because Indiana recently turned blue for the first time in 44 years, I feel less fucked than ever at the moment. But Ropechain's brief bit of chirpy stoner paranoia ""We Know We Might Be Fucked"", and the back-porch-jam nihilism of ""I'm Absolutely Freaked Out"", dredge up more personal, and less pleasant memories for me. They're occasionally catchy, and certainly harmless enough, but they also make plain Adamson's intermittent attention span and dearth of insight, which makes me uneasy (and not in the fun way).  Ropechain isn't going to displace Margot & the Nuclear So-and-Sos as the standard-bearers for Indie-ana any time soon (though please, someone hurry up and do it), but the album can stake a claim to represent that ever-underrepresented subculture that the nineteenth state owns as well as the other 49: Fidgety suburban druggies.","Indiana native puts pop culture references and musical genres into a blender to create a weird and druggy concoction that sometimes evokes early Ween.

Hush Arbors,Hush Arbors,by: Mia Lily Clarke,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bdd45e6ef9596932314b/1:1/w_160/d8b50d8a.jpg,2008-12-08 06:00:04,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12524-hush-arbors/,Ecstatic Peace,"Seeing as groups such as Fleet Foxes, Bon Iver, and Yeasayer helped shape the sound of summertime with their popular psych-washed acoustic folk, it's unsurprising that similar sounding acts have begun to show up in the spaces between. Hush Arbors, a duo consisting of songwriter Keith Wood (contributor to records by Current 93 and Six Organs Of Admittance, along with many others) and his long-time collaborator Leon Dufficy, have actually been performing a lot longer than any of those acts-- almost a decade, in fact. So it's an ironic yet familiar tale that this recent wave of new music might help bring them belated attention. For those who haven't yet heard the band's delicate, experimental free-folk compositions, Hush Arbors is a great place to start and adroitly encompasses all of the Virginia based duo's most engaging qualities. While the mostly instrumental opening track of Hush Arbors, ""Water"", does little to prepare the listener for what to expect from the rest of the album, it makes for a startling introduction. The barrage of ultra-fuzzed guitar drone provides a stylistic link to earlier releases, such as their 3"" CD-R Cleaning the Bone from 2005, and actually serves as a sonic cleanser of sorts. When the rivers of feedback fade, the music suddenly lifts and a common thread begins to unfold. There's a lot of gorgeous acoustic fingerpicking that promptly brings Bert Jansch to mind, although this is occasionally balanced by the electric guitar textures of Wood's pal in Six Organs of Admittance, Ben Chasny. On ""Follow Closely"", Chasny's barbed guitar lines actually highlight the character of the songwriting while bringing the vivid imagery of Wood's lyrics to life when he sings ""It came swimming swiftly through her eyes and touched me gently, a double flame grew around her head/ She flicked her tongue and she kissed me on the lips, and I felt it burn, I felt it burn."" Stark and contemplative, ""Rue Hollow"" is the only track on the album to stick to acoustic guitar alone, and is outstanding due to its elegant simplicity. Wood has the unmistakable vocal inflections and sorrowful yet hopeful cadences of Mazzy Star on this song. Stringing falsetto across a carefully layered, circular guitar line, it is all the more impressive for being unembellished by other instrumentation. Wood clearly has a keen ear for knowing when to hold back and when to expand the possibilities of the song. ""Sand"" is one of the most melodically developed tracks on Hush Arbors, and despite sticking to a fairly liner dynamic, the hushed, slow burn of delayed guitar hovering in the background like a string quartet gives movement to the music and grounds other melodic ideas as they shift in and out of the verses with contrasting shades. Taking a full circle of sorts, the album closes with ""Water II"". There's a return to the dark, even hallucinogenic, sea of distortion that introduces the first track, but this time it's pierced with a rough, swirling riff that sounds as though it could overthrow everything going on around it. On this song, Wood gradually ties in the themes that have colored the album lyrically. Water, mountains, light, and mysterious women give weight to every track, brought to life by the ethereal, unpredictable cascade of sounds that take their place among them.","Nearly a decade into their career, and after quite a few low-profile releases, Virginia's Hush Arbors bring their delicate but experimental brand of folk to Thurston Moore's Ecstatic Peace imprint.

Holiday,Alaska in Winter,by: Brian Howe,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929be37ea9e61561daa787b/1:1/w_160/9bbe3e27.jpg,2008-12-08 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12494-holiday/,Milan,"On his debut album as Alaska in Winter, Dance Party in the Balkans, Brandon Bethancourt employed A Hawk and a Hacksaw's Heather Trost and Beirut's Zach Condon to flesh out his odd brand of vocoder-glazed indie pop. On that record, he managed to locate a middle ground between Balkan folk, Byzantine religious music, and the breakbeats rattling the trunks of his native Santa Fe. His aesthetic worked best at its extremes: the jittery beats of ""Balkan Lowrider Anthem"" at one pole, the hazy ""Lovely Lovely Love"" at the other. The middle range was pretty but equivocal, and Bethancourt came off like a talented pop musician slightly embarrassed by pop. But whatever obscurity prevailed upon Dance Party in the Balkans disperses on Holiday. It's a collection of chromed synth hymns aimed straight at your pleasure centers, with zero concessions to so-called difficulty. ""Berlin"" announces Bethancourt's newfound clarity and the place that fostered it (he spent six months making the album there): the synths are torqued into gleaming waves, the bassline is glued to the one-beat, and thwacking snares keep dropping in and out so we can relish the surge over and over. The Berlin microsound infiltrates the album only slightly; mostly, it's dominated by slabby 4/4 anthems. The locale's direct influence is more practical-- since Bethancourt had no instruments with him, his use of programmed synths and drums was compulsory. Because things like ukulele and vocals by Trost were added later, they never derail the rock-solid foundations as they sometimes did on the first album. Even the slightest song here, the ambivalently shuffling ""Knorrpromenade"", packs almost as much wallop as Dance Party's most emphatic moments. If Bethancourt's musical style is considerably refined on Holiday, his voice remains its centerpiece. He's still a dead ringer for Condon, although the minimization of folksy idioms helps him forge a more distinct identity of his own. He rolls out chorus after wafting chorus, harmonizing with his natural voice through a vocoder, thereby lending it a serrated edge. These are the kinds of songs that are impossible to sing without your eyes prayerfully closed, and Bethancourt's earnestness helps to sell his goofy lyrics about speed boats to heaven (on the splashy electro-pop nursery rhyme of the same name, an album highlight) and girls dying in his arms (on the percolating-then-gushing ""Highlander Pt. 1"", a hammy tragi-romantic duet with Trost). Bethancourt likes to establish punchy patterns and flog them for all they're worth. The second part of ""Highlander"" brings in a new lyrical motif-- ""I don't want to live forever,"" he sings, rising and falling over each word-- but mostly sticks to reshuffling the scudding bass line, fizzy snares, and synth loops of its predecessor. The first two parts of ""Streetgang"" tinker with a buzzy theme that gains a powerful thrust with the introduction of trills and glossy chords in the song's third part. You can feel Bethancourt's enthusiasm, how he likes the parts so much he wants to see how they fit together in every possible permutation. Given the seductive simplicity of his loops, that enthusiasm is easy to share. Holiday would be a fine album at any moment, but it seems especially timely right now. Let's take a quick inventory: The contours are stark and sleek, and it burns with a weirdly cold heat. The production is elaborate in a streamlined way, the melodies infectious. A sentimental digi-crooner is orbited by hums and blips, as if rendering your voice and music robotic gives you carte blanche to be messily human, even maudlin. Sound familiar? Suddenly, and just in time for the holidays, it's as if indie pop fans immune to the charms of Kanye West have an 808's and Heartbreak of their very own.","The second album from Brandon Bethancourt's project moves away from the Zach Condon-assisted Balkan folk of his debut to embrace sleek, mechanized indie pop.

Dark End of the Street EP,Cat Power,by: Joshua Love,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929be44c0084474cd0c2e6c/1:1/w_160/1cdb9cc5.jpg,2008-12-08 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12504-dark-end-of-the-street-ep/,Matador,"My sister just had a baby, and in preparation she loaded up on those Rockabye Baby! CDs that offer lullabye instrumental renditions of deathless rock and pop classics. They're not much more than a nice way to expose the little one to ""Kashmir"" and ""Paranoid Android"" and ""Heart-Shaped Box"" without scaring the shit out of him-- and to keep mom and dad from losing their heads listening to interminable nursery rhymes. My sis asked me to grab a few more in the series as stocking stuffers, but I think I might just surprise her with Cat Power's new EP, Dark End of the Street, instead. Aside from the fact that the nominal Chan Marshall actually does sing on these six covers of songs made famous by the likes of Aretha Franklin, Creedence Clearwater Revival, and the Pogues, there's not a whole lot of difference between the somnambulistic effects of this EP and the Rockabye Baby! records. In their original, raw form, Aretha's voice or CCR's guitars or really anything relating to Shane MacGowan could easily upset a newborn, but Marshall has smoothed over those upsetting displays of passion and personality with sleepy readings that transform all the material into one never-ending narcoleptic haze. These six cuts were apparently deemed unworthy of inclusion on Jukebox, Cat Power's covers LP released earlier this year, which wasn't terribly impressive itself, aside from a nice gender twist on Hank Williams' ""Ramblin' Man"" and a fascinatingly vulnerable fan letter to Bob Dylan, ""Song to Bobby"". Of course, it wasn't always this way, as a listen to Marshall's 2000 effort The Covers Record strongly attests to her interpretative capabilities, yet ever since restyling herself as a weary soulstress for the jaded indie rock set, she's too often allowed her material to coast on the twin strengths of her tastefully muscular backing bands and her own invariably smoky vocal tone. Marshall deserves some credit for having the stones to tackle such unimpeachable classics as Franklin's ""It Ain't Fair"", Otis Redding's ""I've Been Loving You To Long (To Stop Now)"", and the title track (famously recorded by Franklin, James Carr, and the Flying Burrito Brothers). Yet her own versions aim at some druggily evocative conception of 60s soul, which makes them pale next to the originals. Marshall fares markedly better with the non-soul stuff-- her take on CCR's ""Fortunate Son"" is commendable, casting the song in an entirely different rhythmic setting that lends it a swaggering insistence even at low volume. As for the EP's other two offerings, a quick search of YouTube yields two superior renditions of ""Who Knows Where the Time Goes"" (Sandy Denny's original and Nina Simone's cover) and at least three better takes on ""Ye Auld Triangle"" (from the Pogues, Dropkick Murphys, and especially a mesmeric run-through by Marshall's beloved Bob Dylan and the Band from the never-officially-released trove of Basement Tapes recordings). Still, if it's any consolation, I bet the baby will prefer Cat Power's versions.","Cat Power closes the year as she started it: with a record of covers. This time she tackles songs made famous by Aretha Franklin, CCR, and the Pogues, among others.

Alone II: The Home Recordings of Rivers Cuomo,Rivers Cuomo,by: Jason Crock,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929be47c0084474cd0c2e72/1:1/w_160/5b523a7b.jpg,2008-12-08 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12507-alone-ii-the-home-recordings-of-rivers-cuomo/,Geffen,"Sequels to vault-clearing compilations tend to dip in quality, to no fault of their compilers: An initial volume of demos and leftovers should be the cream of the crop-- who knows if there will be interest or time for a second? For Rivers Cuomo, there naturally was plenty of interest. Thankfully, Alone II: The Home Recordings of Rivers Cuomo-- the follow-up to last year's Alone-- is nearly as good as the earlier volume: There's less deep-vault revelation this time around but there's more variety in style and sound. Bad news first: Despite a flashy guitar solo and some laborious harmonies, ""I Want to Take You Home Tonight"" plods, and ""The Prettiest Girl in the Whole Wide World"" would have been better left in the garage. Alone had its silly spots, for sure, but they at least revealed a lot of Cuomo's personality and charm. There's not a lot of replay value in marching-band interludes and song snippets played into answering machines, and while covers are fun, the Beach Boys' ""Don't Worry Baby"" is a choice and an arrangement that will surprise no one, ably performed or not. The best Alone II offers is straight-ahead, no-nonsense power-pop-- not that anyone's ever complained about that from Cuomo. ""My Brain Is Working Overtime"" joyously rides a scant few chords into the ground, ""Walt Disney"" sparkles gently but confidently, and ""I'll Think About You"" is a staccato acoustic jig with Cuomo sounding, for once, relaxed. More pieces from ""lost album"" Songs From the Black Hole are revealed yet again with a full-blown song suite: Longing ballad ""Oh Jonas"" features some vocal schizophrenia, which segues into the lurching ""Please Remember"", and ends on the playful and slightly-seedy ""Come to My Pod"". All of them are goofy, off-the-cuff, and charming. Bleeding-heart Weezer fans will still find at least a few tracks to pin their fond memories on. ""The Purification of Water"", a strident Blue Album-worthy ballad, pins familiar low-end riffery on some Hammond-esque organ. ""I Don't Want You Let to Go"" has lovely acoustic instrumentation, and even the maudlin piano bitch-out to critics, ""My Day Is Coming"", is believably wounded. Any of these would fit onto any of their records with a little more time and attention, but the instrumentation and faux-Romantic lyrics of ""The Purification of Water"" is the only one that distinguishes itself in this early form. The novelty acoustic rap cover might be the most odious trend of my generation, but previously-unreleased track ""Can't Stop Partying"" subtly bucks the trend. A lack of irony doesn't make it less awkward, but it's certainly more palatable: it's a collaboration with Jermaine Dupri, for one, has an oddly striking melody (even if it's a little close to Smashing Pumpkins' ""Disarm"" for comfort), and made slightly more interesting in a sad-libertine sort of way for a mournful tone behind it's party-ready lyrics. ""Can't Stop Partying"" doesn't sound awkward from Cuomo, necessarily-- but it does sound heavily labored. Cuomo isn't the type of artist to wait around for divine inspiration-- he's a worker, songwriting is his job-- but as we get deeper into the vaults, more of the material sounds like actual work, or daily exercises without a spark of fun or unpredictability (outside of a woebegotten space-themed rock opera, of course). Alone was worth the occasional cringe to show Cuomo's experiments and sonic baby photos through the years, especially after three studiously formulaic records. The weird part is that, after the Red Album, Cuomo's day job is actually more unpredictable than these demos-- for better or for worse.","This sequel to last year's vault-digging Alone is less revelatory than the first volume, but it nearly matches its predecessor in quality.

Peoria,Future Clouds & Radar,by: Kasia Galazka,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929be28c0084474cd0c2e36/1:1/w_160/e02e04ba.jpg,2008-12-05 06:00:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12478-peoria/,Star Apple Kingdom,"If you play in a band that sounds like the Beatles with Harrison as your surname, you know destiny's been fiddling with a few too many knobs. But in the case of Austin-based Future Clouds & Radar, songwriter and former Cotton Mather frontman Robert Harrison's art rock is so compellingly embellished with psychedelic tinges and pop swirls that the urge to spot reference points soon falls away. Peoria, the band's follow-up to their sprawling self-titled debut, craftily pits hold-your-hand pop against more shadowy terrain within its half-hour lifespan, resulting in a record that stands easily on its own merits. Peoria's pearls aren't hard to find. Once your ears stop sifting through the songs looking for Sgt. Pepper's and White Album nods, you'll also stop noticing Harrison's oddly Lennonesque vocals (this despite hailing from Texas) or benign similarities like the ""Across the Universe"" melody that ekes its way into ""Mummified"". If Lennon's accusation of McCartney was that he was ""pizza and fairytales,"" then Future Clouds & Radar are warm laundry and machetes. Indeed, Peoria is so pleasant to wrap yourself in, it's easy to miss the darker elements, like the ""Found a mockingbird/ And I drowned it"" couplet in ""Old Edmund Ruffin"". Just keep the blackbird away from Old Edmund's fish tank. Future Clouds & Radar lopped off a lot of extra fat between their double-disc debut and Peoria's eight tracks, and the leaner profile is a much better look. But even within this tighter framework, they've left room for instrumental and textural variety. Opener and single ""The Epcot View"" starts off innocently enough with a balmy drum machine that dissolves behind its earnest melody. The two-minute piano-driven ""Feet on Grass"" pinches the album with an orchestral belt, then drifts into the dreamy ""Mummified"", which strays into seven-minute territory with Hollie Thomas' schizophrenic key tapping. In case you hadn't noticed the death themes by this point, the band kindly reminds you with ""The Mortal"" and ""Mortal 926"". The first pauses the 1960s filters to break down into a Flaming Lips jam mid-song, and the industrial instrumental ""Mortal 926"" could easily double as a detective show theme song with mounting brass and unresolved bass line. The brevity of some tracks and the rambling jams in others are-- surprisingly-- complementary, melding Future Clouds & Radar's moments down Willy Wonka's scary tunnel with a more traditional tour. The band's only missteps occur in the last track, ""Follow the Crane"", which has a few extraneous sound effects-- dog barks, sirens-- that come off like an overly busy holdover from their debut. These moments aside, it's an otherwise solid wrap-up of Peoria's sinister ends. I've always resented being fooled into an extra glance or two in my rearview mirrors. But here at the record's close, Thomas' keyboard floats like it would in a movie when the protagonist moves into a big house and swears she heard music coming from the cobwebbed upstairs. For a few moments, a fairy tale emerges and fades, there's a nice melodic coda, and the curtain falls on the album's dreamy run. Peoria is smart, carefully crafted, and loads more efficient than Future Clouds' debut, suggesting that there's a lot to look forward to in the band's next episode.","Peoria is the second album from the Austin band led by Robert Harrison, formerly of Cotton Mather. Though still heavy on the Beatles worship, Peoria is a vast improvement on the group's bloated 2xCD debut.

Kitsuné Maison 6: The Melodic One,Various Artists,by: Marc Hogan,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Senior Staff Writer</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929be32c0084474cd0c2e48/1:1/w_160/29523571.jpg,2008-12-05 06:00:04,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12489-kitsune-maison-6-the-melodic-one/,Kitsuné,"Download overload isn't the only way French indie-dance label Kitsuné has been a victim of its own successful aesthetic. Their previous Kitsuné Maison compilations showcased a ridiculously long list of interesting acts-- great and terrible, sometimes at the same time-- who in one way or another combine a punk/DIY mindset with dance: Hot Chip, Digitalism, Metronomy, Simian Mobile Disco, Bloc Party, Lo-Fi-Funk, Au Revoir Simone, Joakim, Wolf Mother, MSTRKRFT, Klaxons, Van She, Feist, Guns N' Bombs, M.I.A., the list goes on. There's been a good amount of variety on these comps, but this is a genre with a fairly low bar to entry: big obvious beats, some not overly polished vocals, and a decent jpeg from LastNightsParty are enough to get you started. As Balearic-style slow disco, dubstep, and minimal techno provide headier and less populist alternatives, and the biggest names in its discography become successful, Kitsuné is skimming off the top of an increasingly large pool of low-risk electro-house tracks. But Kitsuné Maison 6 is subtitled The Melodic One, presumably because it also includes some non-dance material. That's a smart move, and basically all of the disc is at least listenable. Still, it can't match previous standouts like Simian Mobile Disco's ""I Believe"", Whitest Boy Alive's ""Done With You"", Yelle's ""Cause De Garçons"", Jenny Wilson's ""Let My Shoes Lead Me Forward"", Feist's ""My Moon My Man"", Thieves Like Us's ""Drugs in My Body"", or Crystal Castles' ""Knights""-- and a lot of those were melodic, too. On Kitsuné Maison 6, elder electroclashers Fischerspooner no longer stand out as much for their luxurious production values, exhibited here on the breathy, buzzing ""Danse en France (D.I.M. Remix)"". Glossier still is Grovesnor's Balearic blue-eyed 1980s electro-soul ballad ""Drive Your Car (Hot Chip Remix)"", arguably the biggest highlight. Also occasionally hitting the serotonin spot is Heartsrevolution's ""Ultraviolence"", which gives Crystal Castles a better run for their haunted analogue distorto-scream-house money than You Love Her Coz She's Dead's ""Superheroes"". A-Trak's bassy, ""Hustler""-like ""Say Whoa"" still sounds like as good a way to start a run-- assuming you're still capable of such a thing after all this downloading-- as it did when it originally appeared on his entry in Nike's Original Run series. BENI's ""My Love Sees You"" isn't ""My Love"", but it's fine enough vocal-tweaked spacey disco. And autoKratz's pulsing ""Stay the Same (Edit)"", though sort of like a blander version of the Teenagers, stops to let a coin spin for about eight seconds halfway through. As novelty goes, this is fun. It's not that Kitsuné Maison 6 has the low points of even a couple of its predecessors, it's just that it's rarely worth losing many brain cells over. Another somewhat memorable track, Ted & Francis' organ-drenched ""I Wish I Was a Polar Bear (Arctic Urgency)"", ought to be in some Quentin Tarantino-type movie two decades from now: an earnest ice-cap electropop equivalent of Harry Nilsson's ""Coconut"" (you can skip the breakdown, though, Quent-- oh, and I'll have my people tell you where to send the check). Lo-Fi-Funk's ""Want U"", which puts chunky guitars and synth strobes above handclaps and a thumping beat, will be a favorite of adolescent unrequited lovers who are also bloggers. Le Roux's sultry ""Quicksand"" has a syncopated rhythm and keyboards; bring on the José González cover. Speaking of Sweden, they'd never have called this The Melodic One over there. But that's a story for another RSS-reader tag.","The sixth Kitsuné Maison compilation in three years finds the French dance label leaning slightly in the direction of more song-oriented material. Artists include Fischerspooner, A-Trak, Grovesnor, and Heartsrevolution, among others.

Burnt Out Landscapes,The Manhattan Love Suicides,by: Marc Hogan,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Senior Staff Writer</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929be2613d197565213b6c2/1:1/w_160/768bd0be.jpg,2008-12-05 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12476-burnt-out-landscapes/,Magic Marker,"If the Manhattan Love Suicides were actually from New York, you'd probably be sick of them already. The Leeds, England-based quartet was making sweetly disheveled noise-pop reminiscent of the Aislers Set, the Shop Assistants, and the Primitives before Vivian Girls existed. They were adding Psycho to their girl-group rhythmic candy before Crystal Stilts signed to a label. Their self-titled debut proved they not only had now-fashionable reference points but also catchy, well-crafted songs; two years later, Burnt Out Landscapes, the Manhattan Love Suicides' overstuffed EPs and rarities compilation, reiterates the band's strengths while also demonstrating broader stylistic diversity than their RIYL line might suggest. This sprawling 27-song disc collects nearly all of the Manhattan Love Suicides' best songs, including the contents of last year's Keep It Coming EP on Lost Music, Kick It Back EP on Magic Marker, and Sycamore Peripheral EP on Cloudberry, plus a WOXY radio session, previously compilation-only tracks, and other odds and ends. Fans of fast-paced, feedback-streaked guitar pop should head straight for stalker's anthem ""Clusterfuck"", the shrill (and superior) 7"" version of the debut's do-do-do-ing ""Kick It Back"", or the WOXY renditions of The Manhattan Love Suicides tracks ""Things You've Never Done"" and ""Suzy Jones"". The moderately paced ""You'll Never Get That Guy"" finds a contrast between squealing guitars and Caroline McChrystal's girlish vocals, mirroring the lyrics, ""I've got pleasure, and you've got pain""; ""Keep It Coming"" is Times New Viking's ""My Head"" hopped up on heartbreak instead of drug money. The tambourine-splashed 7"" take of ""Thinking Is Killing Me"" ditches the self-titled LP version's acoustic strums and cello for something resembling Weezer's ""Don't Let Go"" blanketed in extra distortion. On ""Leader of the Pack"" update ""Head Over Heels"" and new song ""Jonny Boy"", the Manhattan Love Suicides explore the idealistic 1950s-1960s teenagerdom that used to obsess the Raveonettes. Meanwhile, ""Sycamore Peripheral"" and ""Dazzle the Blind"" have shimmying beats, but their buried vocals seem to betray a lack of confidence, as neither sticks in the head like the otherwise-similar ""Cracked Open"". A 27-song compilation would make more sense from a better-known band-- as a 14-track best-of, this could've been almost flawless-- but it does give the Manhattan Love Suicides room to try new directions. Teenage Jesus and the Jerks cover ""Orphans"" slices into seething, atonal no-wave befitting the Lydia Lunch-affiliated director of the band's namesake film; ""Finding the End of the Line (With Random Number)"" loses McChrystal's voice in dreamy electronics and programmed beats worthy of High Places or Land of the Loops. The closest the Manhattan Love Suicides get to fellow shoegazers A Place to Bury Strangers is ""Detroit Diesel"", which drives straight into Darklands without losing its way. ""The things that I would kill for are the things you are living for,"" McChrystal sings on ""Wolves"". Burnt Out Landscapes isn't worth killing for, but-- especially if you like to sing along to your C86- or JAMC-indebted songs, rather than just hear them convey a consistent mood-- it's well worth owning.","Two years after a debut full of fashionable reference points and catchy, well-crafted songs, Manhattan Love Suicides release a 27-song compilation of the C86-inspired rockers' best material, which proves they still have room to explore some different directions.

Sugar Mountain: Live at Canterbury House 1968,Neil Young,by: Marc Masters,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929be39c0084474cd0c2e56/1:1/w_160/57a79881.jpg,2008-12-05 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12497-sugar-mountain-live-at-canterbury-house-1968/,Reprise,"Neil Young has always sounded simultaneously young and old. His creaky voice conveys innocence, but it also feels wise and nostalgic, as if its fault lines developed over centuries. That's why, in his mid-twenties, Young could get away with singing that he was a lot like an old man-- it sure sounded like the truth. On most of Young's recordings, the balance between age and youth skews toward the former. He experienced so much so early-- reaching success at age 21 with Buffalo Springfield, then quickly launching a prolific solo career-- that wisdom was branded on him immediately. By the time people even knew who Young was, he sounded more like a wily veteran than a green youngster. Sugar Mountain: Live at Canterbury House 1968 offers a chance to hear Young with the scales tipped the other direction. It's taken from his first two post-Buffalo Springfield solo acoustic concerts, performed in a ministry on the University of Michigan campus. Unheard until now, these shows have gained legend due to one song from them, ""Sugar Mountain"", popping up on B-sides and the Decade compilation. Made just weeks before the release of his self-titled debut and only a few days short of his 23rd birthday, this recording reveals an eager, nervous version of Young-- a version that existed briefly, soon gone in the flash of his subsequent solo success. Not that he was uncomfortable on stage. Young had played to bigger crowds as part of Buffalo Springfield, whose success he gently mocks in between songs, scoffing at their huge amps and, as he puts it, ""ra-ta-ta-ta"" stage act. But he had yet to prove himself alone, and the weight of a public solo debut adds a little more quiver to his voice, a little more self-deprecation to his rambling stories. In fact, Young was reportedly terrified, in part because he feared he didn't have enough material to sustain a full performance. Of the 13 songs included here, nearly half were previously recorded with Buffalo Springfield. To compensate, Young fills each gap with jittery, candid banter. ""Nothing I say up here is a lie,"" he claims with a stutter. ""I never ever have told a lie onstage."" His true stories are consistently endearing, covering everything from taking ""diet pills"" to get through his previous life as a bookstore clerk, to writing Buffalo Springfield songs while stuck at a diner at 4 a.m., to learning what residuals are and buying a classic car with them. The songs on Sugar Mountain are delivered with similar earnestness and vulnerability. After an introducer admits that the audience is larger than expected, Young offers a fragile version of ""On the Way Home"", his timid chords and cracking voice besting the speedier version found on the final Buffalo Springfield album, Last Time Around. Later, he sings ""The Loner"" in a bashful near-whisper, and the delicate guitar of ""If I Could Have Her Tonight"" alternates between approach and retreat. As things progress, Young's confidence grows, culminating in the ""The Old Laughing Lady"", which hits a rushing peak of forceful strums. Musically, Sugar Mountain isn't Young's best live solo album. On that count, it's outshined by another recent archival release, the Massey Hall performance that happened three years later, and sounds much bolder and wider-ranging. But as a portrait of this ageless artist as a truly young man, Sugar Mountain is an invaluable document-- and a pretty compelling one, too.","Taken from his first two post-Buffalo Springfield solo acoustic concerts, Neil Young's new archival material finds the singer locating his voice-- which, even at 23, sounded weathered and experienced.

Day & Age,The Killers,by: Ryan Dombal,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Features Editor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929be45ea9e61561daa7890/1:1/w_160/fe6d41d4.jpg,2008-12-05 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12505-day-age/,Island,"""Are we human or are we dancer?"" That is the question. Well, that is a question. And Brandon Flowers' grammatically dubious query gets to the heart of the Killers Dilemma. Emotion or libido? Imperfect or impervious? Vegas losers or comped penthouse playboys? On ""Mr. Brightside"", they didn't have to worry about such binaries. Fresh, young and hammy, one of the strengths of the Killers' 2004 debut, Hot Fuss, was its unlearned pop bent. It was fizzy and silly, and there were no apologies. Then Sam's Town checked off almost every big time follow-up cliché there is: horn arrangements in place of songs, concept in place of lyrics, seriousness in place of nonchalance. If the makers of ""Gossip Girl"" created an HBO mini-series chronicling Dust Bowl despair, it would look like what Sam's Town sounds like. Album number three tries to split the difference. There are funk basslines that recall 1980s Bowie and producer Stuart Price (Jacques Lu Cont)-- who helmed Madonna's return-to-dance record Hung Up-- was brought in. But the songs still take on sweeping, Springsteen-ian stakes, and first single ""Human"", with its high-gloss finish, is one of only a few tracks any flesh and blood being would consider dancing to. Which brings us back to that initial question: human or dancer? According to Day & Age, the answer may be neither. Across the album, Flowers keeps himself above the fray, never wallowing too much in his own drama. There's the self-reflexive detachment of ""Human"", the holier-than-thou scoffing on opener ""Losing Touch"" (""I'm in no hurry, you go run and tell your friends I'm losing touch""), and, on ""Spaceman"", he actually leaves our planet for a spell with the help of an alien. The pose suggests a newfound sophistication-- no longer shall he be a slave to the petty desires of mere earthlings. Most traces of humanness on Day & Age come off oddly second-hand, as if Flowers uploaded Springsteen's or Bowie's catalogue to his internal memory and spat out a working simulacrum. This isn't all bad. On both ""Losing Touch"" and ""Spaceman"" Flowers pulls off fine recreations of Pompadour- and Ziggy-era Bowie, respectively. But something like ""A Dustland Fairytale"" is the nonsensical result of a Big Rock magnetic poetry kit. ""Out where the dreams are high, out where the wind don't blow/ Out here, the good girls die and the sky won't snow,"" sings Flowers, signifying everything but saying nothing. Similarly, ""This Is Your Life"" attempts to conflate stories from a couple Springsteen tunes-- take the title character of ""Candy's Room"" and put her out on the savage ""Jungleland"" streets-- and comes off like a half-hearted tribute. With his long distance relationship with down-to-earth emotions and his previous penchant for fake-looking facial hair, Flowers can be reminiscent of a latter-day Rivers Cuomo-- a weirdo trying to please himself and his audience at the same time but constantly coming up a little short on at least half of that equation. The other three guys in the Killers have taken all that Sam's Town criticism to heart more than their lead singer. On Day & Age, the experimentalism is more scattered and more rewarding. Instead of just pressing the ""huge and bombastic"" button ad nauseum, they diversify: so there's the comically Caribbean ""Joyride"" (with full-on touristy sax solo), the Strokes-gone-samba of ""I Can't Stay"" and the impressively brooding (and Björk-ish!) closer, ""Goodnight, Travel Well"". They're aiming to please some of the time, and they do. Less radical change-ups ""Losing Touch"" and ""Spaceman"" are the most obvious contenders for the inevitably incredible greatest hits compilation. ""Losing Touch"", in particular, is like a best of the Killers mashup: there's the crash cymbal chorus for fist-raising, the horn-strut verse for hip sliding, the ""Guitar Hero""-ready solo from underused ax man Dave Keuning. There's no central concept here-- even the album's title is as vaguely all-encompassing as possible. This is the Killers' spitball album, the one where they try everything and see what works while Flowers grasps for a relatable tone. ""When your chips are down, when your highs are low: joyride!"" he sings on the so-dizzy-it's-amazing ""Joyride"". It's the Killers at their most carefree-- the brooding behind them, they're ready to set out with the top down and the schmaltzy sax way, way up. Frivolity suits them, why shy away from it?","After the unlearned pop bent of Hot Fuss and the clichéd strained seriousness of Sam's Town, the Killers return with a third album that aims to split the difference between its predecessors.

Adventure,Adventure,by: Mike Orme,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929be275e6ef959693231ea/1:1/w_160/227ad5b6.jpg,2008-12-04 06:00:05,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12477-adventure/,Carpark,"Adventure's Benny Boeldt, like others of the Nintendo generation, draws inspiration from the 1980s-era 8-bit video game music of composers like Koji Kondo and Hip Tanaka. Game developers and composers have naturally moved on since that Golden Age, taking full advantage of increased storage and faster machines. If you play ""Rock Band"", you've certainly heard AC/DC's ""Let There Be Rock"" in crystal clarity, while EA Sports pumps out CD-quality jock jams in all their recent titles. Still, the wonky buzzsaw of the chiptune aesthetic continues to draw hardcore fans of its retro sound. Crystal Castles, who've helped to kickstart the most recent 08(-bit) conversation, were named after the Atari game but can't really be called chiptunes-- to these ears, they channel the electroclash movement with the judicious support of a few bygone beeps. Conversely, Benny Boeldt isn't really into video games these days, and he doesn't consider himself a chiptunes composer. But his debut record is heavily indebted to Sega and Nintendo themes. Bearing the same name as the popular Atari 2600 game, Adventure's self-titled full-length explores a curious style that once required a composer to deftly balance melody, counterpoint, and rhythm with the constraints of a couple of simple pulse channels and bursts of random static. Perhaps fittingly, Boeldt looks to co-opt this delicate process, wielding a simple sound wave as a double-edged broadsword rather than a scalpel. His pieces, unfettered by the four-channel restriction, charge forward with hyper-melodic and extremely hooky passages, often imbuing a lyrical touch. Tracks like ""Travel Kid"" and closer ""Jurassic Park City"" recall the bubblegum abandon of the Human League or New Order (suggested overtly by the machine-gun ""Blue Monday"" beat driving the latter). While Blade Runner samples float around ""Poison Diamonds"", a high-pitched synth yearn skitters straight out of the Yellow Magic Orchestra playbook, perhaps expressing the same humanity jones as the replicants from the Ridley flick. Boeldt's tracks also suffer from an extreme case of attention deficit, rife with dizzingly arpeggiated passages that often breathe but just as often hyperventilate. By the time you get to the aptly named 8-bit blues of ""Wild Wild Ride"", you've been push-pulled up and down the minor scale so much that you're checking yourself for internal organ damage. It's no surprise that Boeldt hails from the Baltimore-based Wham City collective, as he's got the same issues that sometimes trip up fellow Whammer Dan Deacon: losing the distinction between giddy maximalism and plain ol' too much. But it's best not to overthink Adventure. When you're in the car and you hear nearby drivers bumping jock jams or AC/DC, you can probably take pleasure in popping this in, because while they're only cruising up the street or down the highway, you're headed off to some distant, perilous, pixilated world.","The debut full-length from Benny Boeldt of the Baltimore-based Wham City collective recalls the wonky buzzsaws of late-80s video game chiptunes with a focus on the exuberant melodies and dance rhythms of early synthpop.

Part of the problem might be that no one really knows what to make of her. The ersatz 1980s influences she fronts on ""Back of the Van"" and ""Oh My"" gyrate confusingly between the appropriated, clubby electro-pop of Cut Copy and the more MOR side of Stevie Nicks. Brown's bipolar moods occasionally dilute her well-crafted anthems. The result is a complicated message that offers glitzy choruses and pinpoint synthesizer strikes, but also imbues in her an Everywoman's humility and hope. But Ladyhawke carries on, whizzing by like a flipbook of classic concepts: quirky and synthesized sheen from Cyndi Lauper, feminist rocker mystique from Nicks. At her best, Pip Brown sounds like she wrote the damn book herself: ""Back of the Van"" could have headlined the soundtrack to the great never-filmed Goonies sequel, worthy at least for the relentless ""You set me on/ You set me on fire!"" chorus. The Numan ""Cars"" rip in ""Paris Is Burning"" adorns a kaleidoscopic junk pile of skittering drums, piano stabs, and palm-muted guitar. It seems that for almost every retread like ""Love Don't Live Here"" or ""Crazy World"", there's at least a lining of forward thinking. Take the percussive ""Dusk Till Dawn"", which marches along to the beat of both the urban white chic of Gwen Stefani and the coke-nosed disco rock of Franz Ferdinand. Hands down, the best moment on the record comes with the bass-drum punctuation to Brown's ""Bang bang bang/ On the wall"" mantra. To wit: some filler, some Thriller. In more ways than one, the images communicate the content. On Ladyhawke's cover illustration, Brown kneels half-clothed in a messy rumpus room, Famicom controllers and Casios strewn about the floor, Zapper gun stuck in her belt, her gaze intently fixed upon an off-canvas television. Flanked by her pet cats, Pip Brown affects the image of an Internet Age spinster, clinging to remembrances of video-game antiquity. And so it is with the music: Ladyhawke is brimming with ideas whose worst moments quantify this past and whose best build upon it.","New Zealand native Pip Brown drops her debut full-length as Ladyhawke, an electro-pop project that blends glitzy choruses and pinpoint synthesizers as heard on the minor hit ""Paris Is Burning"".

Acoustics EP,Minus the Bear,by: Joe Tangari,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929be2fc0084474cd0c2e43/1:1/w_160/66d42473.jpg,2008-12-04 06:00:03,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12485-acoustics-ep/,Tigre Blanco,"Minus the Bear have historically held the EP in the same esteem as the LP; not counting remix records, they've released EPs and LPs in equal numbers. Their new EP Acoustics, however, marks the first time they've treated that format as a stopgap between albums. As you may have guessed from the title, this is Minus the Bear unplugged, with one new song and six photocopies of old songs played essentially the same way as the originals with slightly different instruments. For some reason, the non-electric policy doesn't seem to apply to the bass guitar, and I swear I'm hearing some electric piano on ""We Are Not a Football Team"", ""Pachuca Sunrise"", and ""Ice Monster"", though that could simply be very skillful layering of acoustic guitar harmonics-- these guys do have some chops, after all. The new song, ""Guns & Ammo"", sounds like, well, Minus the Bear without electric guitars and keyboards, and I don't mean that to sound dismissive. They're a distinctive band. But it's a track that only people who are already pretty big fans of the band need to hear, and the same can be said for the rest of this EP-- the electric versions of these songs are all more interesting than these acoustic ones. None of these tracks are outright misses granted, but the energy level feels low, and de-amplifying the guitars doesn't have a huge effect because the band in its electric guise has never relied much on distortion of other effects that would significantly change the tone. One of the band's most memorable songs, ""Pachuco Sunrise"", loses the dancey bounce of its original chorus in favor of strumming and a fairly basic backbeat-- the rhythmic dynamism is definitely missed. ""Knights"", one of four songs originally from last year's Planet of Ice, retains nearly every proggy guitar flourish of its source, turning the stuttering CD-skip-like instrumental hook into a little descending phrase, and it's likely fans will enjoy parsing out exactly what they did to make the re-arrangement work. Everyone else can safely leave this EP, a digital release only available in physical form at the band's shows, alone.","As you may have guessed from the title, this is Minus the Bear unplugged, with one new song and six photocopies of old songs played essentially the same way as the originals with slightly different instruments.

Beauty Dies EP / Wishing You a Rave Christmas EP,The Raveonettes,by: D.

The first of this series was three aggressive remixes of Lust tunes, highlighted by Danish big-wig Trentemøller; alas, it was just a between-release stopgap. A little stronger was the second of the batch, the shoegaze-lathered and electronically-goosed Sometimes They Drop By, which carried a whiff of experimental tunes that didn't fit on the proper album. But on these two newer EPs, singer-guitarists Sune Rose Wagner and Sharin Foo have concocted a whipsmart formula that blends several of their past album's best charms-- reverb-heavy rock riffs, Jesus & Mary Chain fuzz, girl-group songcraft, shoegaze atmospherics, and the noise of Suicide. The result: Two extended players that solidly stand alone. Lust succeeded this year by adding muscle to the group's sometimes overly produced, sometimes authenticity-obsessed 1950s biker-film swagger. Like Lust, these new EPs find the band striking a balance between Whip It On's straight-forward simplicity and aural ruckus and Pretty in Black's clean and stately Everly Brothers homages. Beauty Dies track ""Black White"" kicks off with a backslapping snare hit, serpentine bass and guitar, and in-unison breathy vocals. ""Here Comes the End"" features a loop-y tranquil noise intro like 90s space-rock unit Flying Saucer Attack that sways to a bouncy rhythm and Sune's Link Wray-wrapped axwork. Balancing distortion and cleaner sounds, the hazy or overdriven bits serve as pick-me-ups or textural enhancement rather than full bore sheets of noise. Even the psych-tinged ""The Thief"" keeps the nimble, cleaner guitar front-and-center while the lysergic clouds hover in back. EP highlight ""Young and Beautiful""-- a spritual cousin to the Psychedelic Furs-- winks to the early 80s with its driving Joy Division-esque bass and creepy-cool synth line. Unsurprisingly, these Phil Spector denizens and friends of girl-group icon Ronnie Spector also love them some holiday tunes. In 2003, the Raveonettes released the go-go, pill-poppin' romp ""The Christmas Song"" with lyrics about snow, santa, and time spent with loved ones. Wishing You a Rave Christmas also features its share of sleigh bells, snowmen, and sass. A cover of ""Christmas (Baby Please Come Home)"" is haunted by a ghostly synth whistling through the wind. ""Christmas Ghosts"" follows a standard Shangri-Las-like song structure, with arpeggiated guitar chords and Sune's ""lover don't go"" pleadings. The most playful of the bunch is ""Come On Santa"" with its bells, jangle-y clean guitars, and marching drum snare rolls. Adding to the appeal of these paired down yet still bold tunes is the brevity of the EP-- even a high-octane record Lust Lust Lust can sometimes get tiresome over its 12 tracks. By contrast, Beauty Dies and Wishing You a Rave Christmas are nice, tidy stocking stuffers.","The last two of the Raveonettes' four digital-only 2008 EPs-- one an 80s throwback, the other a holiday collection-- are also their best.

Esau Mwamwaya and Radioclit are the Very Best,The Very Best,by: Scott Plagenhoef,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929be425e6ef9596932320a/1:1/w_160/48fc826f.jpg,2008-12-04 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12503-esau-mwamwaya-and-radioclit-are-the-very-best/,Green OwlGhettopop,"Late last year when blogs began to be flooded with takes on the M.I.A.-via-the-Clash ""Paper Planes"" riddim, two stood out: A remix that improved on the original by papering over some of the song's relative white space with fantastic verses from Bun B and Rich Boy, and ""Tengazako"" (""Take What's Yours"" in Chichewa), a collaboration between European production team Radioclit and Malawian-born, London-based singer Esau Mwamwaya. Since then, Mwamwaya raised his profile the quickest way one can in music blog circles-- via collaborations, covers, and remixes. Continuing their Six Degrees of Indie game, Radioclit and Mwamwaya leaked ""Get It Up""-- which featured not only Maya herself, but also Santogold-- ""Kamphopo"", built on an Architecture in Helsinki track, and covers of the Beatles and Vampire Weekend featuring, respectively, the Ruby Suns and, uh, Vampire Weekend. The refreshing thing, however, was that unlike 95% of the superfluous odds and sods clogging blogspace, these tracks were actually really good. It's easy to be cynical about this process of easing Western listeners into Esau Mwamwaya's music-- RIYL Vampire Weekend, Ruby Suns, other English-language artists cribbing from African music-- until you hear the music itself, and in particular the whole of he and Radioclit's free mixtape, Are the Very Best. Once you get through the indie-guarded gates, Mwamwaya and Radioclit are open here to everything from South Africa's marabi and kwaito music to Hans Zimmer scores to French and American hip-hop to Michael Jackson-- and in most cases, it's the tracks that lean furthest away from the familiar that work best. The regal ""Sister Betina"", BLK JKS collaboration ""Salota"", and Radioclit productions ""Funa Funa"" and ""Kada Manja"" are as immediately likable as the rest of the mix. And, frankly, much of the best-known source material here-- ""Cape Cod Kwassa Kwassa"", the AiH backdrop on ""Kamphopo"", the True Romance via Badlands theme on ""Chikandi"", the loathsome Beatles song ""Birthday""-- is either simply a blueprint or sketch for other ideas, or is vastly improved by Mwamwaya's treatments. Mwamwaya's cultural cross-section is no accident. Although he sings in his native Chichewa, he met Radioclit's Etienne Tron when he sold the producer a used bike in a London junkshop. Despite that, Mwamwaya and Radioclit's talents lie far beyond cultural fusion and curatorial skills: In short, they've created just about the most listenable and flat-out enjoyable record of the year-- and one that happens to dovetail nicely with the urgency for and overdue embrace of morally guided globalism. Those globalistic tendencies are, unfortunately, born as much from tragedies such as the Mumbai attacks and economic fears as they are the afterglow of Barack Obama's election. (And, sadly, not born out of crises in Darfur, Kenya, Chad, and far too many other places.) But culturally, this century's renewed Western interest in the music of Africa, the Middle East, South America, China, and elsewhere seems largely free of the condescending and touristic tones that it carried in the 1980s. Instead of searching for a supposed antidote for MTV and synth-pop and whatever else got authenticity watchdogs up in arms a quarter-century ago, now it seems as if people are exploring increasing amounts of non-Western music simply because they have increased access to it and are enjoying the hell out of it. Mwamwaya's fusion, of course, can't be boiled down to Africa vs. the West, a laughably simplistic formula. He's assimilating from a wide range of music both from his home continent-- the clattery, choatic sounds of kuduro or marabi, the refreshing blank space and clean lines of highlife, the deep, loping, patient kwaito-- and around the globe. So The Very Best is far from a primer, but it's not aiming to be an introduction to anything other than the sensibilities and sounds of its creators. It turns out to be wide-ranging, not only in sound but spirit. Mwamwaya plays heart-tugging on the ""Birthday"" cover and ""Funa Funa"", gets earnest on ""Dinosaur on the Ark"", and displays a wicked sense of humor all over the place: An outstanding reworking of M.I.A.'s ""Boyz"", the tongue-in-cheek cover art, and an extended runout of Michael Jackson's Free Willy theme ""Will You Be There"" that turns into a reminder that they've given you this mixtape free followed by a plea to look out for (to still ""be there"" for) Mwamwaya's proper album. In the meantime, consider this freebie an early holiday gift.","Malawian-born, London-based singer Esau Mwamwaya teams with the European production team Radioclit for a hugely eclectic mixtape. While strong collaborations with M.I.A., Santogold, and Vampire Weekend include some surprising left turns, tracks that lean away from the familiar work even better.

Formed in 2001 by Nick Forté and Steve Silverstein, they released their Kranky debut Model 91 a year later. It featured simple, looping songs made mostly with guitar, bass, and the occasional left-field vocal. The fertile music suggested much more to come, but four years passed before the arrival of a follow-up, the meditative Land of Nope (part of the Melted Mailbox subscription series). Having become an all-instrumental trio with the addition of Peter Kerlin, Christmas Decorations had evolved greatly, incorporating a wider variety of sounds and sources into their bubbling mix. Last year a third album, Communal Rust, expanded their palate further, adding glitchy electronics in the vein of Markus Popp or Christian Fennesz. Far Flung Hum, the group's first release on their own label, is another step forward. It may not be a huge advance in sonic terms-- most of the sounds here are similar to those on previous records. But it's the first time that Christmas Decorations' thoughtful alchemy has felt so natural. Patient and highly textural, these six songs are more like growths than compositions, as inevitable as vines creeping down an old brick wall, or weeds sprouting up through an untended garden. Like those slow-moving phenomena, each song builds gradually and almost imperceptibly. Opener ""Rosin Slip"" veers from folksy string plucks to scrapes, slaps, and buzzes that seem random, but coalesce into a mini-symphony. The rattling ""Turning Into Birds"" creates a rickety rhythm out of watery burbling and kitchen-sink percussion. Imagine the minimalist sound art of outsiders like Jeph Jerman or Sean Meehan transformed into a Tom Waits-style junkyard stomp. Far Flung Hum peaks with ""Broken Leg Hours"", a rumbling, densely atmospheric piece. Rummaging through shortwave-ish beeps and outdoor ambience, the group makes deep space transmissions and chirping field recordings sound like twins. It's as if they decided to craft a planetarium soundtrack by recording the stars from a moonlit porch. Maybe these pieces are destined to accompany films, preferably time-lapse footage of nature along the lines of Godfrey Reggio's Qatsi trilogy. Just as Reggio paired Philip Glass' chiming minimalism with cars whizzing by and escalators pushing the masses, it's easy to imagine Far Flung Hum married to shots of flowers blooming, ice crystallizing, and bacteria multiplying. Either way, the hypnotic quality of natural growth is already there, embedded in Christmas Decorations' transfixing sounds.","After adding glitchy electronics in the vein of Markus Popp or Christian Fennesz on last year's Communal Rust, former Kranky group Christmas Decorations take another step forward on Far Flung Hum, the group's first release on their own label.

Spencer Yeh probably wasn't thinking of a productive, quasi-prominent career in noise and drone when he dreamt up the name Burning Star Core. The Cincinnati-based out-music impresario has been scattering releases over labels and formats since the turn of the century, in the process becoming one of the most reliably prickly artists in the genre. Increasingly, Yeh's albums have moved away from in-the-red amplifiers toward shaky, clattering landscapes. Challenger, one of BSC's most composed, coherent works, still manages a decadence and anger that belie Yeh's veteran status. Here he abandons the harsh industrial tones of recent releases and molds globular sound over expansive space. Yeh has never been an out-and-out noise-monster-- he's no Prurient or Kevin Drumm-- but there's a substantial difference between, to pull just one recent example, the dungeon sounds of ""A Curse on the Coast"" from last year's Blood Lightning 2007 and Challenger's ""Mysteries of the Organ"". With its slowly oscillating notes and sawing melody, ""Mysteries"" might fit on a more subtle electronic record by someone like Jan Jelinek, or at least it would've until someone pushed that heavily treated piano down a staircase near the four-minute mark. Challenger presents Yeh as an active composer rather than a feverish minion of noise. The shift likely has something to do with instrumentation. Rarely on Challenger will you hear the recognizable slashes of Yeh's instrument of choice, the violin. Previous BSC albums have felt like the result of several folks huddled too closely in a room, waiting out chaos. But while it's easy enough to make deep black noise when you're holding down an organ key and waiting for a tube amp to do something interesting, it's a different game entirely to sprinkle crackling loops over sculpted ambience. The change can be seen on ""Mezzo Forte"". Yeh revisits a favored pastime-- manipulating syllabic utterances-- but does so with more clarity, turning a back-throat hum into a lapping, near-rhythmic trance by mid-track. A pleasantly thumbed piano adds structure and melody to the final minute. The final track, ""Un Coeur en Hiver"", contains plenty of the industrial hum-- whirring belts, sparking metal-- that has characterized BSC's crassest moments, but Yeh neuters their effects with light synth touches. Yeh even momentarily suspends the clatter, allowing swaths of unfettered, major-key synthesizer to float through the speakers. ""Hopelessly Devoted"" gathers around a low-energy drone and a voice treated beyond recognition. ""No Memories, No Plans"", bleak in both title and execution, consists of hundreds of tiny clacking noises and some background street noise; it's either a fantastic amateur fireworks show or a sonic recreation of Wile E. Coyote landing in a bin of Acme mousetraps. Challenger doesn't quite rewrite the BSC playbook, but it does represent a shift in tone and process that feels both welcome and promising. Fitter, happier, more productive? Perhaps not, but a grown man can't live on drone alone. For perhaps the first time in his decade-long career, Yeh's music seeks clarity.","Latest from C. Spencer Yeh's drone project marks a shift in tone as he moves away from the harsh industrial sound of recent releases.

Welcome to the Night Sky,Wintersleep,by: Mia Clarke,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929be23eb335119a49ecff8/1:1/w_160/796c2dd7.jpg,2008-12-03 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12472-welcome-to-the-night-sky/,Labwork,"Since winning the coveted Juno Award for achievement in music earlier this year and re-issuing their first two albums with a major label subsidiary (to considerably more success than when they were first released), Wintersleep have sealed their place in the Canadian indie rock canon alongside groups like the Weakerthans and Broken Social Scene. The similarities end there though, as the Nova Scotia quintet instead favor tighter, heavier rock anthems. Wintersleep have found their popular niche and are cautiously experimenting, though that is not to say that they're timid. Like toes grazing icy waters, they have the potential to go farther yet seem to resist, pushing hard against their limits without ever fully stepping outside of them. Welcome to the Night Sky, Wintersleep's third album, is largely composed of straightforward yet emotional rock comparable to Band of Horses and early R.E.M., particularly on songs like ""Astronaut"", where singer Paul Murphy's voice soars triumphantly over a jangle of guitars with reassuringly familiar yet effective melodies. Since most of the tracks are between two and four minutes, there is little time for meandering, and Wintersleep have a tendency to cut straight for the gold with infectious guitar lines and persuasive, high-energy choruses. The band's self-control usually works in their favor, however, and they are able to translate grand ideas in a relatively short amount of time so the songs communicate successfully without ever having the opportunity to become exhausting. And although Wintersleep may stick to a fairly loose formula, they also color their music with impressive motifs. The album's organ-driven centerpiece, ""Weighty Ghost"", sounds like it's channelling Paul Simon with cleverly layered group backing vocals and subtle handclaps that end up making the song more memorable and the sound fully encompassing. Both ""Dead Letter and the Infinite Yes"" and ""Murderer"" provide a platform for Murphy's darker musings on mental illness, supported by guitars that twist and swell beneath like they're trying to fight their way out of an unlit maze. It is drummer and founding member Loel Campbell, however, who provides Wintersleep's magic touch. While the group's songwriting certainly pulls off a trick or two, the end result would have significantly less impact under the treatment of a weaker rhythm section. The passion behind Campbell's attentive, driving beats gives the songs a grittier edge, the lyrics more feeling, and pushes along the rest of the band with a momentum that connects the listener to the song faster than one might anticipate at the outset. Welcome to the Night Sky has a tendency to sound like accessible indie rock by the numbers-- an empathetic ballad here, a stadium fist-puncher there-- but Wintersleep maintain a strong identity that sets them apart from less interesting contemporaries. It's actually the album's eight-minute closing track, ""Miasmal Smoke & the Yellow Bellied Freaks"", that shows a different side to the group's potential. Here they slacken the reigns a little, getting lost in an epic swirl of guitar reverb that recalls Explosions in the Sky and keeps building with a determination and inventiveness that will hopefully carry through to further recordings.","The third album from these 2008 Juno Award winners from Halifax, Nova Scotia, finds them further refining their brand of jangly, affecting indie rock while subtly laying groundwork for future experimentation.

Black Sea,Fennesz,by: Mark Richardson,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929be4113d197565213b6e9/1:1/w_160/8bda802e.jpeg,2008-12-03 06:00:02,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12502-black-sea/,Touch,"Christian Fennesz is one of a handful of people from experimental electronic music's late-1990s halcyon days still kicking around. Where others have disappeared (Oval), taken on a curatorial role (Gas), or resigned themselves to arms-length abstraction (Autechre), Fennesz has evolved his aesthetic and found new avenues of expression. In the last few years he's released two albums with Ryuichi Sakamoto, collaborated with Mike Patton and guitarist Burkhard Stangl, knocked out some remixes, and created music for dance and films. He's been busy, but people who don't follow this music closely probably haven't noticed. They've been waiting for a new solo album, preferably something that might cross over from the ""electronic music"" racks in the way that 2001's monumental Endless Summer did. But Fennesz's unhurried approach to his solo work has yielded dividends. Since he takes so long between proper Fennesz records, the release of a new one still feels like an event. Black Sea, which again finds Fennesz working primarily with guitar and computer, is his first solo album since 2004's Venice, the follow-up to Endless Summer. It's tempting to compare this record with its predecessor based on the characteristically striking cover art, once again by Touch label founder Jon Wozencroft. Where the Venice sleeve featured a lone rowboat bobbing in rich and impossibly blue water, Black Sea sports a shot of an industrial skyline across a filthy-bottomed straight at low tide. The image and title suggest that we're in for something colder and comparatively grim, and even though that's only partly true, such subtle shading via imagery has always been important with Fennesz albums. What is apparent right off the bat is that Black Sea finds Fennesz painting on an especially large canvas. While some may hope for a partial return to the pop-like miniatures of Endless Summer, tracks that could be thought of as ""songs,"" these feel more like classical pieces-- sweeping and symphonic and patiently unfolding. It's not just that several tracks are longer, with three running over eight minutes. Fennesz has also sequenced the record to give parts of it a suite-like feel. Opener ""Black Sea"" bleeds into ""The Colour of Three"" without a pause, joining the tracks with the sort of howling, finely granulated drone he specializes in. Together the cuts add up to an 18-minute epic, one that moves from stirring rumbles of low static to a buzzing assault that sounds like it was recorded inside a helicopter's engine to a resigned acoustic guitar figure that feels like wind brushing past an abandoned building. In other words it feels like a ride, like the music transports you bodily from one place to the next rather than creating an ""environment."" And it's best heard loud when given lots of attention. Indeed, Black Sea is an intensely physical album, even for Fennesz, which is ironic considering that he's always put digital signifiers-- glitches, pops, crackles-- in the foreground. The guitar, a common thread throughout, offers an anchor of familiarity. But it's the relentless experiments with the emotional possibilities of texture-- experiments only possible with a computer-- that give the album its weight. So the physicality is focused in very precise and specific ways. Where Fennesz's more abstract early material could be wild and chaotic-- you pictured an unsteady hand on the lever, struggling to control the torrent of sound-- he's at a place now where everything is extremely careful and ordered, with nothing left to chance. This cerebral approach doesn't diminish the impact of the raw, enveloping moments on Black Sea's second half. ""Glide"", a standout that ranks with anything Fennesz has created, gets over primarily on carefully sculpted volume as it builds to a hair-raising peak. An edit of a live collaboration with fellow Touch artist Rosy Parlane, ""Glide"" proceeds along a single line for nine minutes, as a tense held chord is obscured by a cloud of white noise. Both the prickly wash of sound and the underlying drone gather steadily until the piece pivots on a bass tone and then finally bursts open like an overfilled balloon, allowing a gleaming synth, almost shocking in its tenderness, to come pouring out. It's here that Fennesz's mastery of pacing and structure, honed over the last decade, is so apparent. The following ""Vacuum"", a melodic soundscape piece that sounds like it could have come from Venice, is pleasant but comparatively slight, while ""Glass Ceiling"" combines thin, piercing tones, bell-like figures, and processed guitar in an appealingly disorienting way. The closing ""Saffron Revolution"" feels like a summing up of the record's best moments, as it gradually moves from cavernous gurgles, dissonant, sawing chords, and spidery bits of guitar into an immense drone that completely dominates whatever space its heard in. In a sense Black Sea feels like a more self-consciously ""sophisticated"" version of Fennesz, as if his time playing concert halls and opera houses inspired him to compose music suitable for such grand settings. But he's a composer up to the task and Black Sea ultimately proves to be worth the long wait. And in the end, the wider scope suits him. In 1995, Fennesz debuted on Mego with an EP called Instrument, which found him probing the musical properties of the guitar/computer interface. Each of its four pieces sounded like the work of a guy tinkering with a single idea, seeing how vibrating strings and feedback might be bent and twisted to create a particular effect. Despite the thick force of these tracks, Instrument is small-scale music, a scribbled note passed from one insider to the next. Heard next to it, Black Sea is positively huge while also being much more accessible. You get a sense here of how far Fennesz has come, how far his music reaches, and the unexplored possibilities that still exist.","Black Sea, which again finds experimental electronic music star Christian Fennesz working primarily with guitar and computer, is his first solo album since 2004's Venice, and it's reminiscent of classical pieces-- sweeping and symphonic and patiently unfolding*.*

The Reminder: Deluxe Edition,Feist,by: Ryan Dombal,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Features Editor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929be40eb335119a49ed02b/1:1/w_160/23b961ff.jpg,2008-12-03 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12501-the-reminder-deluxe-edition/,Cherrytree,"Since The Reminder's release in May 2007, I've seen Feist play live three times. Turns out it was one time too many. The first, at 87-year-old midtown Manhattan fixture Town Hall, was quiet, seated, and quaint. Her voice was pristine and her strands of festive lights hung down just so. The second, at Brooklyn's emptied McCarren Park Pool, was spacious, breezy, and yet still quaint. She made a pool joke before starting ""The Water"" and she turned the concrete shell into a cozy sanctuary. Problems arose at a show this year inside NYC's cavernous Hammerstein Ballroom, though. By April, Feist was well into the victory lap stage of her Reminder stint-- between the Apple endorsement, the one-take videos, and (oh yeah) the near-perfect batch of broken-hearted tunes tying everything together, she tapped into a mainline somewhere between your mom's Bose CD alarm clock and your Nano.
 
But even with the expanded fan base, The Reminder is big on music that's very tiny. It all but demands rapt attention. So the Hammerstein crowd-- boisterous, bored, and oblivious-- ignored her attempts at intimacy, waited for the song from the commercial, and then left soon after. The experience was disappointing, though it wasn't Feist's fault. That third show exposed how The Reminder's modesty could work against it-- how its no-frills profundity could be misread as a totally sweet Bed Bath & Beyond soundtrack.
 
Of course, it's much more than that, as this timely reissue-- coupled with a bonus disc filled with videos, remixes, demos, and rarities-- um, reminds us. This is anti-cynic music made by a woman flighty enough to call her house the Unicorn Ranch yet wise enough to lace her bouncy smash with semi-depressing nostalgia. Take away the blue sequins, Gap dancers, and rainbow Nano-ization, and ""1234"" basically counts up the years until ""money can't buy you back the love that you had then."" For passers-by, Feist could be chalked up as a Lilith leftover, an Enya-style new age balm for our Crackberried brains. And The Reminder works on that level. The Village Voice slammed its ""overall tenor of emotional feebleness and submission"" while unfavorably comparing Feist to spiky former alt-rock heroines Liz Phair and Courtney Love. But, at the same time, the album isn't an easy-listening devolution as much as it's a considered maturation-- a path both Phair and Love have yet to tread. While that may sound a bit AARP, this 32-year-old Canadian makes growing up sound sexy and tough. She feels it all, but doesn't stamp and wail about it.
 
Her most successful videos-- ""1234"" and ""I Feel It All"", both directed by Patrick Daughters-- are joyous affairs, but there's also an element of discipline involved. Both were shot in one take and choreographed to match precise camera moves. They're child's play that only an adult could pull off-- igniting synchronized fireworks to celebrate inevitable masochism (""I'll be the one who'll break my heart""). The clips highlight The Reminder's push-pull and make it clear that, with the right amount of creativity, synergy, and charisma, music videos still have the ability to spark mass culture 25 years after ""Thriller"".
 
The remixes found on the bonus disc accentuate The Reminder's toe-tapping viability and slightly stretch indie dance night preconceptions. Sixteen-piece Brooklyn disco revivalists Escort put the Nile Rodgers impulses on hold for their take on ""I Feel It All"", instead giving the rhythm a winning marching band bent. And while Justice wannabe Boys Noize and 1980s synth fetishists Chromeo characteristically underline grooves for ""My Moon, My Man"" and ""Sealion Woman"" respectively, best in show goes to Australian remix group Van She Tech, whose remix provides a French-house ""1234"" workout that even Daft Punk would have trouble topping. It's the only truly necessary track on the bonus disc-- the type of song iTunes was invented for. The odds and ends that round out the bonus disc are superfluous at best, troublingly MOR at worst. Spare demos of ""So Sorry"" and Broken Social Scene favorite ""Lover's Spit"" don't match the well known originals. Scat-rap warning: Feist's generally embarrassing duet with Reminder co-producer Mocky, ""Fightin' Away the Tears"", comes way too close to Jason Mraz territory and suggests the knob twiddler should remain behind the boards.
 
The Reminder is one of those very few supposedly star-making albums that actually made a star out of its creator. This is a great thing. But it can be discombobulating for an artist who toils in humble fallibility. For instance, it seems like Feist may have heard some of those loud chatterers at the Hammerstein Ballroom earlier this year: ""(My career) has become kind of large and it really began for me very, very small-- like me alone in my bedroom with my four track and a pair of headphones,"" she told the Canadian Press recently. ""I just need to go back there for a while to get my bearings again and then know what to do next."" There's little reason to doubt her instincts.","Coupled with a bonus disc filled with videos, remixes, demos, and rarities, this reissue of Feist's breakthrough record reminds us that before the Apple ads and YouTube hits, she recorded a near-perfect batch of broken-hearted tunes.

Beating Back the Claws of the Cold,The Pica Beats,by: Joshua Klein,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929be24eb335119a49ecffb/1:1/w_160/3280d193.jpg,2008-12-02 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12473-beating-back-the-claws-of-the-cold/,Hardly Art,"The Pica Beats' Ryan Barrett, a New Englander transplanted to the Pacific Northwest, sounds downright bummed to have come late to so many different parties. You can hear it in his fragile, warbly voice, if not always his somewhat glum songs. Strummy naïve C-86, lo-fi DIY, hyper-literate heart-on-sleeve twee-- oh, to have been born too late to partake in those forgiving and nurturing scenes while they were still alive and strong! Needless to say, the Pica Beats seem a little out of place in 2008, if not outright anachronistic in their stylistic leanings (and borrowings). Yet despite this, there's such a relatively unassuming vibe running throughout their second album Beating Back the Claws of the Cold that it makes up for the fact the antecedents are so easy to discern. It sure helps that the band doesn't seem so bigheaded that it pumps up its low-key geek rock with misplaced portent. Instead, they are innocuously slack where other acts might have gone for wound-up. The rickety anti-sheen of the basement studio production gives the disc the feeling of something homemade and defensively modest, a token the shy new kid at school might slip into the lockers of potentially likeminded peers by way of indirect introduction. That's the good news. The bad is that diffidence can only get you so far, and however fine a handful of individual songs may be here, the comprehensive end result is still oddly lifeless. Mellow might be the name of the game, but you can still sell songs with some conviction and spark without coming across as overconfident. There's a middle ground to be reached that's missed by the OK-enough title track or the otherwise standout ""Summer Cutting Kale"", which is just slightly more subdued than it needed to be to take advantage of the inner anthem waiting to emerge. Even the few more vibrant tunes, like ""Shrinking Violets"" or ""Cognac & Rum"", fall just short of all they could be, with the theatricality of the latter in particular failing to bring Barrett's narrative into sharper focus . Elsewhere, the occasional use of synths-- or, on the instrumental ""Martine, As Heavy Lifter"" and ""Hikkomori & The Rental Sisters"", sitar-- seems less novel than frivolous, while songs such as ""Shallow Dive"" and ""Poor Old Ra"" never quite justify the flowery, erudite logorrhea they're meant to support. Smug though the band may be, at least the Decemberists deliver their literariness dynamically. With the Pica Beats, it's harder to connect with Barrett's characters and colorful descriptors when the songs themselves never quite fully come to life. This is not to say Barrett and friends don't sound like they could be on the cusp of something a little more self-assured, but that's just it: Beating Back the Claws of the Cold only offers fleeting glimpses of potential greatness beneath the ho-hum surface. Right now the band (itself a relatively fresh and untested expansion on Barrett's originally solo conceit) comes off a tentative work in progress as well, a little too ensconced in its own little cocoon, in no particular hurry to get out.","Ryan Barrett fronts this literate Pacific Northwest indie-pop outfit on the Sub Pop offshoot Hardly Art.

Walking on a Dream,Empire of the Sun,by: Mike Orme,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929be2ec0084474cd0c2e40/1:1/w_160/2b0fd482.jpg,2008-12-02 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12484-walking-on-a-dream/,EMI,"Anyone who calls Australia's Empire of the Sun an unlikely collaboration needs a lesson in aplomb. In fact, it's tough by now to be surprised by much of anything these guys do. Luke Steele of the high concept pysch-pop outfit Sleepy Jackson and Nick Littlemore of dance duo Pnau, while taking divergent paths to Down Under pop stardom, are essentially kindred spirits bound by flamboyance and an odd idealism. Inspired by untold numbers of late nights and acid trips, at their indulgent best they strike a trenchant middle ground between fantasy and historical revisionism. Steele's big orchestras and Littlemore's whiz-bang saccharine samples both aspire to a grand sense of scale. A hundred bucks says each of these guys had a psychedelic 1970s country-disco epic on his back-burner anyway. The title track, with its clubby beat and falsetto hook, seems like the kind of hit Steele has always wanted to write, but here he's found the right editor. Littlemore has evidently cleared a path for his partner, cutting through the relentless elaborations that adorned and perhaps encumbered the two Sleepy Jackson records. Steele may be his own worst enemy, his finger always poised at the ready on the overdub button at the chance of adding jangle to his overwrought jangle-pop. The addition of a co-composer has helped forge a bit of an uneasy truce in his frenzied psyche. Some cuts might even give rise to such simplistic fits of impulse as dancing. Of course, let's not forget who we're talking about here. Luke Steele still effortlessly reminds everyone within earshot that he's really into himself. Like, really. He's the guy on the cover of the Sleepy Jackson's last record Personality as the bare-chested angel perched atop an Arctic ice field, austerely bearing in his arms the fetal, bare-chested figure of… himself. This delusion of grandeur manifesests itself on Walking's ridiculous cover, the epic spawn of Star Wars and ""Zoobilee Zoo"" raised straight out of promo poster hell. It seems a career spent in such indulgence can't just be streamlined overnight, because although Empire tries mightily, they collapse underneath too many ideas before the record is even half over. Same beast, new duds: instead of packing the arrangements with Personality's meaningless little fills, countermelodies, and interludes, the duo try their hand at genres they've apparently always wanted to do, like booty bass or yacht rock ballads. No wonder people buy individual tracks rather than full albums these days-- few buzzes die so abruptly as in the transition of the complex, ethereal melodies of ""We Are the People"" into the following cut ""Delta Bay"", which sounds like ""Thriller"" sung by cats. If a metaphor could describe such an utterly puzzling sense of scale, it would surely fall somewhere in between throwing pasta at the wall and hunting the White Whale. Steele and Littlemore both seem incapable of diverging from their relentless quest for epic Meaning, but while some material is about as sublime and immediate as anything either has done, just as much crashes and burns. Thankfully, ""Tiger by My Side"" bulldozes the second-half wreckage with Station to Station swagger and a pounding, jammy Neu! beat. The song's impenetrable lyrics reference a fitting thematic menagerie of real and imagined beasts, and also may or may not have influenced the naming of Steele's six month old daughter Sunny Tiger, his first child with wife Snappy Dolphin. Seriously, you can't make this stuff up.","The first full-length collaboration from Australians Luke Steele of the Sleepy Jackson and Nick Littlemore of Pnau works on a grand scale as it moves between streamlined psychedelia and flamboyant dance-pop.

I Love Dubstep,Various Artists,by: Nate Patrin,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929be29abf31b7dc71560dd/1:1/w_160/92564c89.jpg,2008-12-02 06:00:02,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12479-i-love-dubstep/,Rinse FM,"Even for dilettantes, late 2008 seems like odd timing for anyone to drop a so-called ""definitive"" mix of dubstep tracks from the last couple years. Maybe it's because the genre's most exciting developments this year were the revelation of Burial's identity and the rise of offshoot genres like funky and wonky, meant largely to combat the stagnancy of a scene left to a war of darker-and-harder attrition. Still, Americans whose interest was piqued by Untrue deserve to have a few more names to put into their Rolodex, and a hit-packed mix CD is, if anything, at least a solid gateway towards a much-needed bit of genre-defining perspective. That's why I Love Dubstep, a well-curated two-man mix courtesy of the pioneering pirate station Rinse FM is a good bet for new listeners interested in the bigger dubstep picture-- even if it's already sounding a little more like time-capsule material than the way forward. The DJs selected for this collection have plenty of bonafides: Youngsta is an early dubstep adopter who spun scene-definer tracks on the regular before he could legally buy a pint; Geeneus, meanwhile, has a production career that runs the gamut from early grime to current UK funky club hits. And, fortunately, they both have different approaches to their mixes, both in selection and mood. Youngsta's disc has a consistent mood, characterized by waves of growling, fluttering bass. About one-third of his mix's 23 tracks are credited either to Skream or Benga, two of the Croydon-based foundation-builders who fortified the booming, wobbly-bassline style that ubiquitous imitation has threatened to dilute. Those signifiers stand out a bit more brightly when these two are involved: Skream's almost lighthearted, ska-infused touch on ""Dutch Flowerz"" and Benga's energy-flashing raver flashback ""Flames"" toy with expanding the parameters of the sound, while the consecutive 1-2 punch of Skream's ""Midnight Request Line"" mixed into Benga's ""26 Basslines"" prove the secret to dubstep's appeal lies as much in jittery, restless, sometimes hyperactive (and danceable) rhythms as it does in ""dark"" atmospheric gloominess. There are still a few water-treading, semi-onimous halfstep shrugs that might've sounded more revolutionary in 2006-- Caspa's ""Rubber Chicken""; Pinch's ""Punisher""; SP MC's ""Trust Nobody"" (which has the added disadvantage of being released in 2008). But in the context of this mix-- and thrown in with genuinely different cuts like Hijak's roots-dub throwback ""Dally"" and the euphoric closer of halfway-to-hardcore D1 cut ""Mind & Soul"" (billed under its original title, ""Give It Back"")-- they manage to sustain the first disc's evocative mood of intense darkness punctuated by flashes of neon. Geeneus plays things differently, and a bit more intriguingly: His disc has a keener focus on rhythmic elasticity than big heavy slabs of bass. There's still plenty of subwoofer fodder, of course-- the Bug's towering ""Skeng"", the dense buzz-pulse of Distance's ""V"", and some additional tracks from Skream (""Oskillatah""; ""Make Me""; ""2D"") and Benga (""E Trips""; Benga & Coki's ""Night"") see to that. But Geeneus' selection has a lot more breathing room, with sprightlier drums and a heavier emphasis on vocal tracks to cut through the shadows. There are more vivid nods to dubstep's origins in UK garage, best personified by Martyn's breathtaking DCM Remix of TRG's ""Broken Heart"". And it hews closer to its Jamaican roots, whether in titular invocations of Rastafarianism (Kode9's ""Babylon""; Digital Mystikz cut ""Give Jah Glory""), dancehall vocals (""Skeng""; Coki's remix of Richie Spice's ""Burning""), and straight-up classic skanking riddims (Conquest's ""Hardfood""; the Digital Mystikz remix of Fat Freddy's Drop's ""Cay's Crays""). I Love Dubstep doesn't do a lot to point towards the scene's future, but its presentation of two different facets of  the scene-- dark and bright, dense and loose, brooding and danceable-- proves there's at least more than one way to get there.","This well-curated two-man mix courtesy of the pioneering pirate station Rinse FM is a good bet for new listeners interested in the bigger dubstep picture-- even if it's already sounding a little more like time-capsule material than the way forward.

My Mistakes Were Made for You EP,The Last Shadow Puppets,by: Marc Hogan,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Senior Staff Writer</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929be3713d197565213b6d9/1:1/w_160/f0db420e.jpeg,2008-12-02 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12495-my-mistakes-were-made-for-you-ep/,Domino,"Never mind the Internet, Arctic Monkeys first made their name the old-fashioned way-- by playing live. It just happened that the demo CDs they gave out for free at early shows eventually made their way onto the Web, via fans, some of whom then established the group's original MySpace page. The band's members have gradually moved away from a basic live-band setup on their recordings-- never further than on The Age of the Understatement, Arctics singer/guitarist Alex Turner's impressive debut with Miles Kane (of fellow British band the Rascals) and Simian Mobile Disco's James Ford as the Last Shadow Puppets. Produced by Ford and arranged by Owen Pallett (aka Final Fantasy), the Last Shadow Puppets' album blows up its creators' musical and lyrical vision to late-1960s cinematic proportions. The My Mistakes Were Made for You EP is more like your average set of special-edition DVD extras. This U.S.-only release compiles the various UK B-sides to The Age of the Understatement single ""My Mistakes Were Made for You""-- two live covers and a live version of a song from the album-- plus four stripped-down renditions of other album tracks. No new original material, no radical departures, just an unnecessary glimpse behind the curtain. It helps that ""My Mistakes Were Made for You"" is a sumptuous, groove-driven ballad about the time-tested topic of ""innocence and arrogance entwined/ In the filthiest of minds."" Although not quite as memorable or communicative as the The Age of the Understatement's first two singles-- the galloping title track and lovesick last thrust ""Standing Next to Me""-- the song still manages to evoke late-60s Scott Walker or David Axelrod with its queasy strings and spaghetti-western horns. Lyrically, Turner and Kane construct the cryptic tale of a woman who might be a groupie (""It's the fame that put words in her mouth""...""a face in the crowd she's not""); their deft wordplay is clear enough taken one line at a time, but becomes intimidatingly difficult to parse over the course of the entire song. Arriving alongside the new Arctic Monkeys at the Apollo concert DVD, the EP's three live tracks confirm an impression of Turner and his colleagues as precociously seasoned stage performers. Live in Oxford, ""Separate and Ever Deadly"" retains its organ stabs and lush orchestration. As one of the few Last Shadow Puppets songs that might as well be in Greek for those of us who don't speak British English (""secateurs"" are ""pruning shears""...I guess?), it's urgent and vaguely menacing, but still a weird choice for a U.S.-only EP. As with the well-selected David Bowie and Billy Fury B-sides from the album's first single, the covers here are notable mostly for what they can tell us about the project's likely inspirations. Certainly, Lee Hazlewood and Nancy Sinatra were inhabiting similar cowboy-psych badlands on ""Paris Summer""; the Last Shadow Puppets perform the string-soaked adultery ballad faithfully (heh) if predictably in this live recording, with Alison Mosshart of the Kills belting out the Sinatra part like a shaky Neko Case understudy. Turner and company also do Bacharach/David composition ""My Little Red Book"" the Love way, bringing to mind another common reference point for The Age of the Understatement's sound. I guess they had one too many bass players to do it the White Stripes' way. The four ""acoustic"" tracks simply underscore the EP's proficient pointlessness. Unadorned versions of ""The Age of the Understatement"", ""Standing Next to Me"", ""The Meeting Place"", and ""My Mistakes Were Made for You"" showcase the well-crafted melodies and close harmonies beneath the orchestra-buttressed album tracks. Still, when so much of the project's appeal lies in its widescreen production, it's hard to understand who other than the most diehard fans really needs to hear these not-even-really-acoustic versions.","After an impressive album of cinematic, late-1960s pop, Arctic Monkey Alex Turner's Last Shadow Puppets offers this U.S.-only release, which compiles UK B-sides plus four stripped-down live tracks.

808s and Heartbreak,Kanye West,by: Scott Plagenhoef,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929be3b5e6ef95969323200/1:1/w_160/752c4b7b.jpg,2008-12-02 06:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12498-808s-and-heartbreak/,Roc-A-Fella,"Poor Kanye West. The guy was already a ball of conflicts and contradictions-- hand-wringing over his consumption one moment, boasting about his wealth the next. He's someone as driven by ego as he is plagued by doubt-- in other words, a wholly human pop star. This year, however, was particularly rough: He and his fiancée broke up, and his mother, Donda West-- who alone raised Kanye from the age of three-- died from complications after cosmetic surgery. Kanye blamed himself for his mother's death, singling out his own vanity, wealth, and pursuit of glamour and celebrity. His response? He's made 808s and Heartbreak, which as the title hints is an introspective, minimal electro-pop record steeped in regret, pain, and even more self-examination than a typical Kanye West album. And as you've no doubt heard, on 808s West sings everything through Auto-Tune rather than rapping, a decision that for some has made this record a non-starter. The recent embrace of the common studio aid seems akin to pro wrestling saying, ""Fuck it, this isn't real"" and making it more transparent and scripted (and successful). But vocal manipulation isn't only the practice of radio-ready rap, of course-- it's been a signpost for ""futuristic music"" ever since Joe Meek heard ""a New World"" almost 50 years ago. In this decade, records like Radiohead's Kid A/Amnesiac, the Knife's Silent Shout, and Daft Punk's Discovery were heralded in part for screwing with vocals; last year both Battles and Dan Deacon revived the old Alvin and the Chipmunks trick of shifting pitches and speeds; and Bon Iver's forthcoming EP features a song sung through vocoder. And, lest we forget, Kanye West himself made his name as a producer in part thanks to his ""chipmunk soul"" vocal samples. So why is this approach, from this guy, now such a problem? In part it's because it's not what people want or expect from Kanye West. Stylized Auto-Tune seems to be on about every third song on top 40 radio these days, making West seem like an opportunist or a bandwagon-jumper. But Kanye has always been more of a master assimilator: He's achieved in part because he's used wealth and fame to explore the wider world-- culturally and artistically-- rather than shut himself off from it. If this guy was jumping on a radio fad here, we'd likely get an LP's worth of ""Put On""s, his summer hit and collaboration with Young Jeezy. Instead we get bedroom pop, quiet ruminations in which after staying up night after night pursuing and living the good life, Kanye wakes up to a cold, lonely dawn. West's singing is shaky, of course, which is in part why he leans on the Auto-Tune. But it functions here as a democratizer as much as a crutch, because like all Kanye West songs, these are primarily about the experience of Being Kanye West. These are expressions of the specific feelings of one guy; there is still, to West at least, more emotional nourishment to be wrung from song than speech, which certainly colored his decision here. But filtering these ideas through John Legend or Chris Martin or whomever would essentially kill the whole effect. This isn't new: Kanye West's music is about being a specific celebrity more than anyone's since the solo works of John Lennon. Sure Eminem weaved biography into his songs but he also wore multiple faces and worked in and out of character when it suited him; West, on the other hand, is one of the few hip-hop artists without any pseudonyms, let alone characters. Colleagues at Pitchfork have therefore wondered why this wasn't a private record West made for himself, but again nothing he's done is private, and that's in part why he's been so compelling. The album does, however, sound purposefully removed from the start. Opener ""Say You Will"" boasts one of the record's biggest vocal lines but eventually runs out into a three-minute, table-setting outro-- a patient, defeated-sounding collection of choral vocals and drum machines. (A similar trick is repeated, to much worse effect, later on ""Bad News"".) But the album is much larger and brasher than it would first appear-- the closer it hews to a mix of sad-sack indie pop and elegant, monied Patrick Bateman commercial 80s sounds, the better it works. The strings on ""RoboCop"", the relatively busy sounds of ""Street Lights"", the clapping drums on ""Love Lockdown"", and the 909 and descending synth on ""Coldest Winter"" are among the sonic highlights, though even these are subtle. From West's vocal delivery to the stuttering rhythms, the album reveals folds and layers on repeated listens where at first it seems almost horrifically one-note. It's no surprise that 808s is a bit of a grower: The record's best songs-- ""Paranoid"", ""Street Lights"", ""Coldest Winter"", and ""RoboCop""-- are often its most dismal, with cavernous production giving the Auto-Tune vocals more of an echoing desolation than a pop sheen. By contrast, the more pop aspects of the album are where it relatively stumbles. ""Heartless"" and ""Love Lockdown"", both very good songs, work surprisingly well on the car radio, but they're second-tier Kanye West singles. And when the mood is broken up by outsiders or actual rapping, the results aren't pretty: The two songs featuring superstar guests-- ""Amazing"" with Jeezy and ""See You in My Nightmares"" with Lil Wayne-- are also the proper LP's low points. In the end, whether you care to envelope yourself into West's pain and self-torment largely depends on what you already think of the artist. He isn't at his most eloquent here-- raw emotion and rolling expressions of self-doubt don't seem to be ripe for poetic expression (and, woof, the tacked-on ""Pinocchio Story"" is a wtf curiosity at best)-- but very few songs, perhaps only ""Welcome to Heartbreak"", ask you to care about specific rather than expressive language. For the most part, West's pain is articulated in ways that, while borne from his experiences, can be easily translated to the listener's. The kind of universality is a staple of great pop, but it's also something that many indie-centric fans don't find appealing. That West's ego is a roadblock has long been a lament to me, but I think it's ultimately his strength. To twice paraphrase the wisdom of ""The Daily Show"", the guy is aiming to be the biggest pop star in the world-- he should feel bigger than us; too often, though, we instead ask for artists to be just like us or worse. West is endowed, however, with a sense of purpose and drive that pushes him to make records with Jon Brion, to crib from French house, to put on events rather than shows, to valorize art along with commerce at a time when major labels are circling the wagon and becoming stiflingly conservative, and to break out of his comfort zone when he wants to create a record as uncomfortable as 808s. Nobody else on a large scale is coming close to firing imaginations on this level, and if the guy wants to make a record for himself he's earned the right to do it-- even if the public ultimately prefers his big, brash summer jams more than blubbery Notwist-like bedsit indie. If you're in the former camp, don't worry: Kanye has claimed he'll have another record out by June.",,7.6,
Rio,Aterciopelados,by: Joe Tangari,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929be075e6ef959693231b3/1:1/w_160/6ee9942c.jpg,2008-12-01 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12446-rio/,Nacional,"In Colombia, rock'n'roll is world music, a sound from a distant shore that you can take or leave. There are and have been plenty of rock bands in the country, but they've never come to dominate the music scene. There's a simple reason for this: Colombia doesn't need rock'n'roll, in the same way that we in the U.S. don't need Colombian cumbia, though we may use it to spice what we're doing if it sounds good. Among the Colombian rock bands that have made a good go of it, Aterciopelados (the Velvety Ones) is the most prominent and, coming up on two decades in the business, one of the longest-lived. They've survived partly by retreating from the raw, basic punk sound of their debut album and organically incorporating the sounds they grew up with, as well as a few from around the world, to develop a fusion of their own. One of the more unexpected sounds they've managed to find room for on their eighth album, Rio, is khoomei, the Mongolian throat-singing technique that produces the distinctive drone-with-overtones sound unique to the Asian steppes. Guest singer Samuel Alfonso provides subtle khoomei backing on two songs in a strange but effective counterpoint to Andrea Echeverri's more straightforward Spanish-language singing. Co-founder and bassist Hector Buitrago, who handles the arrangements, does far more than just bring in a weird sound here and there to shake things up, guiding the band through a diverse array of tunes that range from basic rock ballads like the jangly ""Tomate"" through flamenco-tinged cumbia and even a bit of jerk funk. The biggest standout is the catchy funk stormer ""Gratis"". I'm not fluent in Spanish, so I'm hazy on the subject matter, but I did catch a line about the ""dance of the electron."" You don't have to understand the message to get into the cyclical guitar riff and jumping beat, though, and the tonal shift when they go to the chorus is the type of key change you can feel as it lifts the song to a new level. One of the khoomei songs, ""Vals"", is an electronics-treated post-punk bolero that finds guitarist Camilo Valázquez reeling off distinctive lines. Throughout the album, he has a way of tightly phrasing his leads to convey an answer to Echeverri's vocals in one pithy melodic phrase. Rio is essentially a world music album no matter where you come from, giving no particular weight to any one style. Its sense of genre wanderlust means it's an album that clicks on about the third listen, revealing its character and depth much the way the seemingly random swirl on the cover becomes an alligator lurking just below the surface on further inspection. That slow reveal and feeling of connection to the farthest-flung parts of the world helps make it a record worthy of both its era and your time.","The latest album from Colombia's Aterciopelados continues their unique fusion of styles, integrating elements of Mongolian throat-singing, cumbia, and jerk funk into their rock sound.

Remind Me in 3 Days,The Knux,by: Ian Cohen,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929be1313d197565213b6aa/1:1/w_160/36b279b2.jpg,2008-12-01 06:00:03,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12458-remind-me-in-3-days/,Interscope,"Krispy Kream and Rah Al Milio of the Knux can see the future, or at least Interscope's Jimmy Iovine hopes so. Remind Me In 3 Days, despite being the first LP from the N.O.-to-L.A. duo, finds them bypassing the typical come-up narrative and indulging in all the trappings of tacky new money-- pricey drugs, conciliatory women, and the VIP parties where both are readily accessible. And if we're to believe the rumors, Interscope emptied the bank to get them a Hollywood Hills crash pad where it could all go down. Blame it on the instructive misfortunes of the hipster rap movement the Knux like to claim they started, but not since the Game's Documentary has a hip-hop debut been more obsessed with Los Angeles celebrity culture or insulated from commercial failure-- hate it or love it. It would be nice to separate the marketing of Remind Me In 3 Days from the record itself, but the marketing kinda is the story. But the Knux have a bulletproof first line of defense against beging dismissed as Complex Magazine fodder. Beyond the fact that they vaguely allude to some pretty serious criminal records on ""Bang, Bang!"" and ""The Train"" (their ""Cocaine Blues""), they can flow in ways that defy mere '88-deification. But it's not like their influences are any less obvious or critically acclaimed. Their high-NRG electro-funk has been likened to Stankonia, but a more accurate comparison is the lower-stakes artistic risks of Speakerboxxx filtered through Southernplayalistic's (mostly) party and bullshit concerns. And if that has you expecting an album's worth of ""We Luv Deez Hoes"", well...it's not too far off. Highlights like ""Fire (Put It in the Air)"" and ""Bang Bang!"" feature a similar mix of hands-up choruses, rock overtones, and agile raps that are playful enough (see the cruelly blueballed second verse of ""Cappuccino"") to counter the lapse into misogyny. But where their heroes balanced crowd-movers with truly moving life lessons, the Knux follow up the early knockouts carelessly toggling between bromide and bromance. Tellingly, the standout is a BBD-meets-SAE new jack swinger about snorting past sexual inhibitions (""Powder Room""). While a consistent philosophy isn't a necessity on a debut album, you wonder who they're finding issue with. Like on their lost girl lament ""Shine Again"", a disturbingly hollow show of empathy to the women they brag about fucking on just about every other song. And then there's ""Daddy's Little Girl"", possibly the record's most immediate hook, with its female vocal that veers perilously close to latter-day Black Eyed Peas. Maybe they intended to fly low enough to hit their target, but it doesn't make it any more listenable, nor does its dissection of celebutante culture that digs no deeper than Beverly Hills Chihuahua*.* And yet, even though Knux lay claim to more traditional rap credentials than most of their peers, they also suggest that they're pretty much opting out of the rap game. Hoo boy, are there guitars on this, and they're played by the Knux themselves. But as much as this proves a facile marketing weapon, it just as often works to their disadvantage. The first time the six-strings pop up, they add a nice espresso jolt to ""The List"", functioning as a hook for a song that doesn't really have one, while ""Cappuccino"" and ""Bang Bang!"" are girded by grooves as thick and tightly coiled as bridge cable. But on ""Roxxanne"" and ""Hush"", the live instrumentation just functions as window-dressing to impress people who probably aren't all that familiar with guitar-based music. Names like Franz Ferdinand and Bloc Party have been thrown out there. But the predominant sound is the palm-muted buffoonery found on the first N.E.R.D. album run through the kind of blown-out, rhythm-dulling, factory preset reverb and distortion tone that drives guitar store employees to think hard about grad school. So, yeah-- for a record that's engineered to please everyone from crate diggers to rockist Luddites (namechecks: Johnny Cash 1, Ca$h Money 0) to ""all the skaters in Venice fucking with the Knux,"" Remind Me In 3 Days is every bit as likely to piss people off. While the first 20 minutes supply an appropriately cocaine-like high (with the requisite comedown), what's really missing is the debut they somehow skipped over, one where they could've showed where their passion comes from, rather than merely being actors in a Hills-hop hybrid.","Hotly tipped New Orleans-to-L.A. rap duo debuts with an album heavy on hands-up choruses, rock overtones, and agile raps that are playful enough to counter lapses into misogyny.

Dolores,Bohren & Der Club of Gore,by: Mike Powell,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929be095e6ef959693231b7/1:1/w_160/ebeb480b.jpg,2008-12-01 06:00:02,Jazz,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12448-dolores/,Ipecac,"Four drunk Germans formed Bohren & der Club of Gore one night in 1992 with a single goal: ""The audience,"" Morten Gass told the metal zine Maelstrom in 2003, ""must have the feeling of being in a grave."" Naming the band inspired debate. ""Bohren"" means ""drill,"" like what people do to other people in horror movies; ""gore"" means ""gore,"" like what seeps out of people when they're drilled, and like a Dutch instrumental band they all quite liked; and ""and der club of"" made them think of jazz. Jazz, they agreed, was cool. It was urban and dangerous-- they liked the idea of it. Stated influences were Black Sabbath and Sade. ""As I said,"" Gass confessed, ""we were drunk."" Cheers to auspicious beginnings. The music Bohren makes is slow, quiet, and pretty. It's too structured to be jazz and too vivid to be ambient, but it taps into the ideals of both. They play their instruments like they're worried of waking babies asleep at their feet. Christoph Clöser's saxophone parts leak from the bell of his horn. You can almost see Morten Gass wince as his fingers sink into his keyboard. Drummer Thorsten Benning lives with the task of supressing every teenage dream of beating the shit out his drumkit like the wild animal I suspect he sometimes wants to be. But in near-stasis, there's drama-- each beat becomes a cliffhanger for the next. Bohren don't play dead, they play mortally wounded. They're the gentlest black metal band on earth. They're anti-social cocktail music. They're exotica, but only if we agree that vacant alleys are exotic places and lying face down in one of them would constitute a vacation. The restraint in their music creates as much tension as it does calm. At best-- 2004's Black Earth-- Bohren sound like they're passing through darkness, palms out and eyes open, in search of a lightswitch. It's the same eerie, bloodless quality of ersatz jazz that David Lynch depended on for club scenes in Mullholland Drive or Audrey Horne's twirling in ""Twin Peaks"", where the mellow becomes queasy and relaxation sours into uncertainty – when what's supposed to relax you starts to actively upset you. Creeps? First-rate. But they're strangely affectionate, too, a quality brought to the fore on Dolores, their sixth and latest full-length. Absorb the title and cover art-- a woman's name, glowing; moths pouring from the neck of some sexless, celestial being. It's cozy, leaden music. Songs have shortened to three or four minutes. Some of the melodies aren't just memorable, but actually hummable. Call this their ""standards"" album-- More Near-Static Ballads of Death's Sweet Embrace. Bohren aren't fabulous enough to be goths. They keep it austere. The grave might be a lonely place, but the dead always downplay its warmth.","German band whose music is a unique blend of metal, jazz, and ambient returns with an album of eerie anti-social cocktail music on Mike Patton's Ipecac label.

Always the Bridesmaid EP,The Decemberists,by: Joshua Love,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929be21abf31b7dc71560d4/1:1/w_160/4a02731d.jpg,2008-12-01 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12470-always-the-bridesmaid-ep/,Capitol,"As Decemberists frontman Colin Meloy recently intimated to Rolling Stone, the band's forthcoming LP, Hazards of Love, is for all intents and purposes a rock opera, encompassing a narrative suite that tells the tale of ""a woman named Margaret who is ravaged by a shape-shifting animal."" Considering the anthropomorphic bent of the group's last full-length, The Crane Wife, it would seem Meloy has swapped maritime yarns for tragic critter fables as his prevailing field of interest, but that's a minor point. More interestingly, and perhaps worryingly, is the ""rock opera"" part. Sure, it might be pulled off flawlessly, though something about the RS article's promise of ""crushing stoner-metal lurches"" leaves me a bit concerned. The Decemberists have always embraced their own inescapable pretentiousness, yet their saving grace was the self-aware lightness with which they carried their geekdom, at its best manifested in breezy dork-outs like ""Billy Liar"" and ""The Sporting Life"". By comparison, chunks of The Crane Wife felt turgid and overblown, indications that a band once wise enough to cordon off its most epic tendencies in ancillary standalones like The Tain EP had allowed the weight of ambition to partially sink its albums. This year, the Decemberists released a series of three vinyl singles, joined under the shared title Always the Bridesmaid, that-- after the sometimes unwieldy The Crane Wife-- offer a welcome return to more modest song forms. The first and most lyrically ear-grabbing of these six tunes is ""Valerie Plame"", a beseeching love letter to the infamously outed CIA operative narrated by an imagined confidant. Meloy's treatment of the Plame affair may seem a tad flippant considering the grave journo-ethical issues that go unmentioned-- and, shame about the unnecessary ""Hey Jude""-ish outro-- yet he nails perfectly the milieu of 21st century foreign intrigue, right down to references to Vespas and ""the Green Zone Marriott."" Less thematically loaded but more compositionally satisfying is ""Days of Elaine"", which substitutes modern headline fodder for imagery of macabre decay that's more typical of Meloy's bent, touching obliquely on drink, drugs, and execution. Most importantly, the song is a rousing triumph of momentum, replete with a tight riff and providing an excellent conduit for its singer's reedy tones. That sense of putting melody and verbiage on equal footing carries over to the second A-side, the wistful ""O New England"". A head-scratching cover of the Velvet Underground's ""I'm Sticking With You"" follows (why aim for charming artlessness when you're already interpreting one of rock's most famously unaffected moments?), but the series finishes strong with the 1-2 punch of ""Record Year"" and ""Raincoat Song"". The former performs the classic Meloy trick of conflating societal and romantic ruin, while the abrupt but evocative latter gives us a brief character sketch of a luckless spinster and delivers the best lyric of the whole collection, as Meloy wryly but heartrendingly opines that ""the raincoat you wore when it rained today/ I think it only made it rain more."" It's precisely such a moment of fine observation and quiet humanity that hopefully won't be lost if the Decemberists continue to make albums overweening with conceptual heft.","This year, Colin Meloy and co. released a series of three vinyl singles, joined under the shared title Always the Bridesmaid, that-- after the sometimes overblown The Crane Wife-- offer a welcome return to more modest song forms.

Chinese Democracy,Guns N’ Roses,by: Ian Cohen,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929be205e6ef959693231df/1:1/w_160/896b858e.jpg,2008-12-01 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12469-chinese-democracy/,Black Frog,"To paraphrase another of rock's foremost procrastinators, Axl Rose just wasn't made for these times. Sure, armchair psychology and Axl Rose is a tired combination but it stands to reason that the only remaining original Guns N' Roses member expected Chinese Democracy to garner a 1990s-style brand-name reception: MTV would block off hours at a time to premiere its videos, fans desperate for real rock would line up at Sam Goodys nationwide for the midnight record release, and school would be forsaken to blast it on speakers the size of Greg Oden. Instead, ""Shackler's Revenge"" debuted on a video game, as if Gn'R were just some chump band on the come-up (or Aerosmith), and the album's world premiere found it meekly whispering through tinny computer speakers from a very un-rock MySpace page. Perhaps the most striking aspect of Chinese Democracy is that it's about the fifth-most shocking Guns N' Roses album. Sure, it's difficult to endure both Use Your Illusions in one sitting, but there's something fascinating about how the bombastically lonely ""Estranged"" could share disc space with the junior-high politicking of ""Civil War"", ""Yesterdays""' concise, sepia-toned pop, and the critic-baiting tantrum ""Get in the Ring"". Had that record been a career-ender, it would've been a fitting finale. Instead, Axl took 17 years to, we hoped, explore new textures, manipulate songwriting conventions, seek out challenging collaborators, or delve into unfamiliar genres for inspiration. Yet on the way to being this decade's Sgt. Peppers, Chinese Democracy became its Be Here Now-- a record of relatively simple, similar songs overdubbed into a false sense of complexity in a horrorshow of modern production values. Fans have long complained about Guns N' Roses still existing in the absence of Slash, Izzy, and even Duff, partially out of their talents, partially out of their iconography, and partially because there's no evidence Axl was an auteur figure who could work without his supporting cast. Judging from the personnel involved in the making of Chinese Democracy-- there were 18 musicians in all, not including orchestra players or the more than 30 who provided engineering and ProTools assistance-- it may be more appropriate now to think of Guns N' Roses as a free-floating creative project, even while the music itself suggests a more corporeal entity: The title track, after opening on a seemingly-interminable fade-in (it's been 17 years, another minute gonna kill ya?), pummels your ears with brickwalled, textureless power chords, the first of what seems like thousands of wah solos, and a xylophone. Initially, it's exciting to hear modern rock rendered in such operatic largesse, but the track ultimately proves insubstantial, a middle-aged symphony to nowhere. This is generally how the rockers go on Chinese Democracy, clocking in at anywhere from nearly five minutes to just over five minutes, using those minor-third/flatted-fifth riffs co-opted by far shittier bands in Gn'R's absence. You also get a couple of piano-led ballads aiming at radio stations that don't exist anymore, while songs like ""Catcher in the Rye"" and ""This I Love"" conjure Journey and REO Speedwagon, except you can't really sing along to them. There is, however, a level of craftsmanship that salvages Chinese Democracy as a listening experience-- Axl's voice sounds surprisingly great, and even ""Shackler's Revenge"" has an ultrasheen gloss that particularly benefits its chorus. The problem lies with Axl’s creative direction: That same song is derailed by a grinding arrangement that suggests he's still looking to Korn records for inspiration. It's that flaw which ultimately delivers the fatal blow. Even if Chinese Democracy had dropped a decade previous, it would still sound dated. 1996 appears to be the cut-off point for sonic inspiration, a time when the height of electronic and rock synergy in pop music involved having an acoustic guitar and a drum machine on the same track. Fans deserve better than hearing Axl trying to fight with post-NIN nobodies like Stabbing Westward and Gravity Kills for ideas. ""Better"" and the closing ""Prostitute"" feature memorable, fluid melodies, but are tied to rudimentary Roland tracks that Steven Adler could've replicated in his sleep, and while ""I.R.S."" sports an Illusion-sized chorus, it's dampened by empty conspiracy theorizing. To that point, Chinese Democracy is inevitably and sadly limited in scope to the actual making of Chinese Democracy. Apart from a handful of appropriately vague love songs, Axl seems convinced that the only thing that's mattered to us over the past 17 years was anticipating whether ""Riad and the Bedouins"" might ever see its proper release. Anyone outside of Axl's inner circle appears lumped into some royal ""you"" and thrust into a meta exercise to be held up as evidence of a defiantly achieved victory: ""All things are possible/ I am unstoppable,"" ""No one ever told me when I was alone/ They just thought I'd know better,"" and most pointedly, ""It was a long time for you/ It was a long time for me/ It'd be a long time for anyone/ But looks like it was meant to be."" Strangely, Chinese Democracy comes off like the inverse of the record it will likely finish behind on the week's Billboard chart, Kanye West's 808s and Heartbreak-- one terribly protracted and isolated, the other dashed off and intensely personal. And yet, both feel humanizing in proving that even megacelebrities can deal with life-altering pain and expectations and still have little to say about it. In an April Fools' review of Chinese Democracy written two years ago, Chuck Klosterman suggested that if it wasn't the greatest album ever released, it would be seen as a complete failure. Chinese Democracy needed to be a spectacle-- something that either validated its tortuous birthing process or a Hindenberg so horribly panned it would somehow validate Rose as a misunderstood genius. Instead, it's simply a prosaic letdown, constructed by a revolving cast of misfits ultimately led astray by a control freak with unlimited funding and no clear purpose, who even now remains more myth than artist.","After a 17-year wait, Chinese Democracy needs to be a spectacle-- something that either validates its tortuous birthing process or a Hindenberg so horribly panned it somehow validates its mastermind as a misunderstood genius.

The Way of All Flesh,Gojira,by: Cosmo Lee,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929be0dc0084474cd0c2e0c/1:1/w_160/30362429.jpg,2008-11-26 06:00:05,Jazz,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12452-the-way-of-all-flesh/,Listenable,"Gojira are like Democratic Presidential candidates-- policy wonks who are smart but stiff. They combine the tunneling riffs of Morbid Angel with the steely precision of Strapping Young Lad and Meshuggah. But the resemblance ends there. Unlike Morbid Angel, Gojira have no occult concerns; unlike Strapping Young Lad, Gojira have no sense of humor; unlike Meshuggah, Gojira's lyrics are actually about something-- namely, the environment. The band's ecological fetish somehow seems appropriate for its French origins. No American or Scandinavian death metaller would sing about ""Flying Whales"" or proclaim, ""I embrace the world!"" ""Death metal"" best describes Gojira only because ""life metal"" hasn't caught on yet.
 
The band is aptly named for the Japanese pronunciation of ""Godzilla."" Over time, Gojira's sound has increasingly mirrored the terrestrial destruction in their lyrics. The sound peaked on 2006's From Mars to Sirius, which began with ""Ocean Planet"", ended with ""Global Warming"", and deployed riffs that could knock down buildings. Production is as important to Gojira's attack as note choice, and The Way of All Flesh is an audiophile's wet dream. Instruments are defined with pristine clarity; drums are crisp yet heavy; guitars and bass form a crystalline audio monolith. Gojira sing about the evils of modernity, yet they're the sonic embodiment of it.
 
Such contradiction characterizes The Way of All Flesh. Lyrically, it's downright soulful. Once again, environmental themes abound. ""Toxic Garbage Island"" turns ""Plastic bag in the sea!"" into an angry mantra. ""Adoration for None"" thunders, ""Everyone is doing their best to destroy it/ Simplicity's forgotten/ And we all drill the ground."" But in between the Greenpeace anthems now is a whole lotta death. The theme is a far cry from metal's usual necrotic obsession. Instead, death and life are a continuum. ""Oroborus"" could be the stuff of yoga classes: ""Serpent of light, movement of the soul/ Crawling stately along the spine/ Mighty phoenix from the ashes arises/ Firebird cycle, life, regenerate the cell."" Joe Duplantier's vocals are stronger than ever, employing a wide variety of growls and singing.
 
Unfortunately, this humanity doesn't translate to the music. The performances are flawless, but overly so. Everything is polished to a gleaming sheen. When the band tries to swing, like in ""A Sight to Behold"", it comes off as, well, white. Heaviness is in no short supply; ""Vacuity"" is a single-minded stomp, while the title track pounds chugging riffs into the ground. Without edges, heat, or blood, though, such punishment is joyless. To their credit, Gojira avoid metal's tonal clichés in favor of open-ended abstraction. But it's cold and distant, unbefitting of the passionate lyrics. Undoubtedly, this material is better live, where the band has a fearsome reputation. There, the images are of raised fists and flying hair. Here, the images are of plastic discs and 1's and 0's.","Production has always been as important to Gojira's attack as note choice, and the metal band's new album is an audiophile's wet dream.

The Singing Saw at Christmastime,Julian Koster,by: Amanda Petrusich,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929be19eb335119a49ecfeb/1:1/w_160/b7b67feb.jpg,2008-11-26 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12463-the-singing-saw-at-christmastime/,Merge,"Christmas music is perennially maligned. It's the cloying, pedestrian soundtrack to holiday-shopping; it evokes unwanted memories of fretfulness and claustrophobia, of squabbling with harried salespeople, of trying to scrape ice off your windshield with a broken CD and no mittens while a midi version of ""Jingle Bells"" drips out of busted parking lot speakers. Still, that hasn't stopped a cabal of artists (My Morning Jacket, Sufjan Stevens, Rosie Thomas, Low, Bright Eyes, and plenty others) from earnestly trying to resurrect the genre for an audience more prone to tugging on ironic snowflake sweaters than belting ""We Three Kings"". Julian Koster is best known as the banjo and saw player in Neutral Milk Hotel, and on The Singing Saw at Christmastime, his solo debut, he wields his saw for a series of classic Christmas songs, ranging from the silly (""Frosty the Snowman"") to the sublime (""O Holy Night""). The resulting LP-- 12 tracks of singing saw, exclusively-- is unsettling, bizarre, and, on occasion, exquisite. Despite its relative ubiquity (you could dig up a playable hand saw in most American garages, although the just-for-singing kind tend to have the teeth removed, or at least filed down), the saw is actually tremendously difficult to play and control-- performers jam the handle between their knees, clutch the tip with one hand and a bow in the other, and attempt to twist and manipulate the body of the saw via a fated combination of vigor and prayer. Like a thermin, its tones can be unpredictable and sour, but when it sings properly, with muscle and clarity, there might be no other sound as ethereal and delicate, as alien and transfixing. Ultimately, the saw is high and lonesome above all else, and it invariably evokes enormous wistfulness, a feeling which has a place in almost any Christmas celebration; on paper, Christmas is about miracles, but in practice, it tends to be a little bit more about longing, or, at least, self-contemplation. Consequently, hearing familiar songs-- songs so imbedded in our hearts and minds they can feel like extra limbs-- translated into a series of desperate, undulating yawns seems, at times, oddly appropriate (incidentally, it helps that ""Christ, being by far the most highly regarded and beloved carpenter of all time, was a great friend to the Saws,"" as Koster points out in the liner notes). The strongest tracks here are the ones where Koster layers his saws: ""Jingle Bells"" and ""White Christmas"" both feature genuinely stunning harmonies, although most of these tracks are remarkably spare, even vaporous-- the saw, used in conjunction with a full band, can add a compelling layer of weirdness, but on its own, it's vaguely terrifying (see, especially, ""O Come All Ye Faithful""). Consequently, The Singing Saw at Christmastime maybe isn't the best record to spin while prepping sweet potato pie with Grandma. But it is a remarkable feat of saw-wrangling, and an effective way to wind-down any holiday party: Nothing sends guests off into the cold night like a slow, warbly, saw-only rendition of ""We Wish You a Merry Christmas"".","Julian Koster is best known as the banjo and saw player in Neutral Milk Hotel, and on his solo debut he wields his saw for a series of classic Christmas songs.

"Limbo, Panto",Wild Beasts,by: Jessica Suarez,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929be0bea9e61561daa782e/1:1/w_160/f540e8c3.jpg,2008-11-26 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12450-limbo-panto/,DominoDomino,"Wild Beasts' name comes from the 20th century French art movement Les Fauves (also the inspiration for Les Savy Fav), so maybe the French term ""belle laide""-- a woman who is attractive but not conventionally beautiful-- best describes singer Hayden Thorpe's voice. Thorpe's voice howls and thrashes, other times it actually sings or simpers or sighs, but only when he stretches it to the ceiling does it come into its own. His voice feels close in temperament to Antony Hegarty or Baby Dee's, but its mix of pointed sexuality and ambiguous gender points back to Boy George or David Bowie. That indeterminate quality is the central theme of Limbo, Panto. Vocally, Thorpe plays with what idealized masculinity sounds like; lyrically, the band wants to know what masculinity feels like. ""Men to be men, must love and pity,"" Thorpe announces on opener ""Vigil For a Fuddy Duddy"". By Limbo, Panto's end he's cursed Aristotle, gone for ""casual sex with a hard up thug,"" and sworn on his ""own cock and balls."" If there's a central character across these tracks, it's vice itself. Limbo, Panto is essentially a morality play as cabaret show as rollicking indie rock record. The Sunset Rubdown-like full-bodied pomp of ""The Club of Fathomless Love"" also runs down a series of rhetorical questions: ""I've sheened...have I not?/ I've Brylcreemed, have I not?/ I've length of loinly manliness, have I not?"" That speech oddity would sound appropriate in a camp, old-timey staging of Hamlet. The funny thing is that Wild Beasts pull it all off with grinning, chirping enjoyment. True, lots of the tracks on Limbo, Panto use minor chords to enhance the casual depravity of its characters, but nearly all the guitars chime and sparkle. And others, like ""Woebegone Wanderers"", take on melodramatic halts and cabaret flourishes that render its subject matter comical. ""Brave Bulging Buoyant Clairvoyants"", originally recorded in 2006, still shows this. The band sound more aggressive on the re-recorded LP version: the beat more danceable, the title line shakier and more seductive. It's also Thorpe's most impressive vocal performance. Underneath these filmy and seductive layers is not a band in limbo. This may be Wild Beasts' first album, but they've got a fully developed aesthetic, one that is thematically and vocally alien, but sonically, pop and conventional. Maybe a voice that bizarre needs something pretty to curl up on, but each song, whether a ballad or a romper (mostly the latter), generates enough turbulence to float with pockmarked elegance.","The debut album from the UK's unique Wild Beasts is essentially a morality play as cabaret show as rollicking indie rock record.

Love Train: The Sound of Philadelphia,Various Artists,by: Nate Patrin,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929be10abf31b7dc71560b7/1:1/w_160/b99f89e2.jpg,2008-11-26 06:00:02,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12455-love-train-the-sound-of-philadelphia/,Sony,"When I reviewed two compilation CDs based around the R&B hits and rarities of Philadelphia International earlier this year, I described the label and two of its primary architects, songwriting/production team Kenneth Gamble and Leon Huff, as ""upwardly mobile"" and ""crossover-friendly"". Typically, those are code words used to describe bourgie schmaltz carefully concocted to avoid scaring white folks, the kind of music business plan that irked everyone from George Clinton and James Brown on down; Fred Wesley, who played trombone for both of them, famously quipped that Philadelphia International ""put the bow tie on funk."" It's a quote brought up during an interview in the last pages of the 60-plus-page booklet that accompanies the Love Train: The Sound of Philadelphia box set, and it's answered by Gamble and Huff, after a bit of laughter, as though it were strictly a question of arrangement techniques. But in that same booklet is a brief essay written by Ph.D. and Grammy-nominated writer Gerald Early. He also picks up on the upwardly mobile nature of the Philly sound and sees something different than the compromise the label had been accused of: In the context of a metropolis that he remembered in 1971 as ""broken, dirty, crime-ridden, corrupt, dysfunctional, a city that seemed to be coming to the end of itself,"" Early emphasizes how alive and inspirational this music sounded during this tense, divisive period in Philly history. It's probably the most revealing and most on-point assessment of the 16 years of history included in this box set, which starts with the charging piano-driven blue-eyed soul of the Soul Survivors' 1967 traffic-jam metaphor ""Expressway (to Your Heart)"" and concludes on Patti LaBelle's smooth but elegiac 1983 ballad ""If Only You Knew"". Here you have a style and philosophy that connected on ground-level emotional themes-- duplicity and betrayal (the O'Jays' ""Back Stabbers""), familial bonds (the Intruders' ""I'll Always Love My Mama""), feeling helpless in the face of constant hardships (Harold Melvin & the Blue Notes' ""Bad Luck"")-- combined with opulent orchestration that made high-class, post-Mantovani symphonic arrangements into populist FM radio fare you could listen to in a laundromat. There's 71 tracks on Love Train, and with rare exceptions, they all fall somewhere between good and crucial. Two groups appear on this collection with a well-deserved frequency: both the O'Jays and Teddy Pendergrass-- as the lead singer for Harold Melvin & the Blue Notes and as a solo artist-- make 11 each, and as the label's most popular artists and prolific hitmakers they personified the assertive consciousness that the label thrived on, through both sharp cynicism (""For the Love of Money"") and call-to-arms idealism (""Wake Up Everybody""). Then there's the obligatory appearances from Philadelphia's top-notch session band MFSB, who saw ""Love Is the Message"" catch fire in discos 97 miles northeast to become the ""National Anthem of Brooklyn"" and turned ""T.S.O.P. (The Sound of Philadelphia)"" into the sound of every city in America as the theme to ""Soul Train""; a non-charting cover that puts a lively jolt into Sly & the Family Stone's famously muted ""Family Affair"" is thrown in as an interesting deep cut. You also get the hits that'd become prototypes for disco, like the Blue Notes' 1973 single ""The Love I Lost"", famous for the Earl Young-hewn, hi-hat-driven 4/4 drum pattern that would completely engulf nearly all of pop music within five years and give rise to the likes of McFadden & Whitehead's anti-malaise anthem ""Ain't No Stoppin' Us Now"". And there are the hits that stand out on their own merits, historical or otherwise, from the suave guiltiness of Billy Paul's extramarital affair tale ""Me and Mrs. Jones"" to the Three Degrees' lonely yet upbeat ""When Will I See You Again"" to the Jones Girls' smoky mid-tempo disco-funk classic ""You're Gonna Make Me Love Somebody Else"", a must-hear if you've ever speculated as to what'd happen if Chic and Giorgio Moroder crossed paths in 1978. But this compilation isn't just about Philadelphia International. There's a decent amount of material on Love Train that precedes the official 1971 formation of the label, and the real intent of the box is to showcase almost everything that made the city into an R&B capital in the late 60s and kept it that way through the 70s and early 80s. Thom Bell's pre-PIR production work with Cameo and Avco was an important benchmark for the label's symphonic soul opulence of the ensuing decade, and even if his push towards deeper layers of orchestrally upholstered sweetness produced the occasional bucket of treacle (the Stylistics' ""I'm Stone in Love With You"" is not recommended for those with blood sugar disorders), it also resulted more frequently in a staggeringly luxurious beauty, typified by the Delfonics' majestic ""Didn't I (Blow Your Mind This Time)"". And there's a number of Gamble/Huff-abetted appearances by Atlantic artists not typically associated with the Philly sound that nonetheless benefit from it, including Dusty Springfield (the title track to the underappreciated Dusty in Memphis follow-up A Brand New Me), the Spinners (the timeless song of unrequited faithfulness ""I'll Be Around""), and Wilson Pickett (underrepresented by Wilson Pickett in Philadelphia hit ""Don't Let the Green Grass Fool You""; leaving out the funk monster ""Get Me Back on Time, Engine Number 9"" is one of this box's few but cruel omissions). Philadelphia International's cultural cachet still hasn't completely caught up to the reverent immortalization of Motown or Stax; when writers blame a label for facilitating a crossover mentality and watering down soul for the whitebread masses, that kind of reputation can be hard to shake. But successive movements have found a lot of worth in this music and helped prove how well it stands up: Of the 71 songs on this collection, at least 25 of them found additional life in later decades as hip-hop and contemporary R&B samples. For those intrigued by those sonic building blocks, Love Train will prove to be exhaustively surprising and inspiring, especially in context with its interview and essay-strewn booklet of liner notes, which reads like a miniaturized edition of cratedigger/soul-geek bible Wax Poetics. And for R&B aficionados of all ages, this set does an admirable job of reevaluating and reaffirming this sound as something more than just gussied-up soul: Behind that bow tie was a jugular vein pulsing with the beat of a new, aspirational inner-city America.","This 71-track compilation of the best of Philly soul is packed with songs that range from good to absolutely crucial, and it provides an excellent look at a once-maligned, now-often-beloved sound.

Something About Airplanes,Death Cab for Cutie,by: Ian Cohen,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929be1dc0084474cd0c2e27/1:1/w_160/a101be9e.jpg,2008-11-26 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12466-something-about-airplanes/,BarsukBarsuk,"It took six albums, three EPs, countless singles, four or five record labels, a much-loved side project, numerous guest productions, and a thoroughly boring solo LP to get to this point, but Death Cab for Cutie will end 2008 as a big-font festival band. And yet, though their sound has grown increasingly muscular, and their outdoor sets tend to only reach as far back as ""We Laugh Indoors"", they still seem ill-suited to wide-open spaces. As I watched two high-out-of-their mind, shirtless, thirtysomething acid casualties make out during Coachella while a rickety version of ""Soul Meets Body"" played in the distance, it just seemed to go against everything Death Cab has come to stand for. In other words, they still manage to carry themselves like a small band from a tiny Washington college town. Upon re-release, the most striking aspects about Death Cab's debut, Something About Airplanes, were how modest it sounded and how removed it was from the Modest Mouse/Built to Spill template of the Pacific Northwest. If there was any resemblance to their regional forefathers, it was in their ability to create a sonic blueprint that's subtly innovative. Few were writing lyrics-- formed almost as complete sentences and melodically structured the same-- like Death Cab's Ben Gibbard at the time. The bridge of ""President of What?"" sounds like it's taking the wrong step with each chord turn, moving in an opposite direction to the melody, but the resolution makes complete sense: ""Nothing hurts like nothing at all/ When imagination takes full control."" In a strikingly candid interview with Paste magazine, Gibbard admitted that he goes back to this record and rarely has any idea what he was talking about. While it's typical for a lyricist to embrace straightforwardness in his later years, recent tracks like ""You Can Do Better Than Me"" are no more rewarding for their directness. Something About Airplanes instead sounds like a private affair, which is one reason it's so treasured amongst diehards. Like so many other fledgling songwriters, Gibbard cloaked his voice in reverb and occasional distortion (even on the sweet and sour harmonies of ""Pictures in an Exhibition"") and danced around sentiment. For a band inextricably linked with heart-on-sleeve emoting, Death Cab could be delectably difficult to parse. You can also hear how naturally and incrementally the group progressed from a fully formed blueprint. Regardless of Narrow Stairs' heavy-handed addition of new textures, you can trace a straight line to that point from the carefully considered guitar lattices of Airplanes' ""Your Bruise"". ""Sleep Spent"" is a direct descendent of mid-90s slowcore with better hooks. ""Amputations"", the most full-bodied track, features rumbling and almost mockingly chiming guitar hooks that sugarcoat the lyric ""he's unresponsive 'cause you're irresponsible""-- a stronger precursor to their more recent theater sing-along lines like ""you are beautiful, but you don't mean a thing to me."" While the deluxe package does include selections from their nervous first live show in Seattle and a cover of the Smiths' ""Sweet and Tender Hooligan"" featuring Harvey Danger's Sean Nelson, the real draw here is the chance to re-evaluate the band itself, often underrated or deemed as a group people ""used to like"" before getting into harder and more challenging music. And yet, while most of the indie crowd now embraces pop music in all its forms, something about dudes like Death Cab, who hit a little close to home but aren't considered ""cool,"" is still considered a dealbreaker. Certainly, Something About Airplanes isn't Death Cab's best album-- in retrospect, it sounds like a dry run for 2000's We Have the Facts and We're Voting Yes, where the lyrics got more pointed, the hooks more emphatic, and the dirges more steely and purposeful. The studio tricks would become more sympathetic as well: In addition to the dated samples that adorn ""President of What?"", ""Amputations"" closes with a snippet of a motivational record called ""You Can Better Your Best"" that proclaims ""if everybody's making fun of you or criticizing, you know you're on the right track."" Granted, the song itself is about the futility of becoming someone you're not to win someone over, but the line unwittingly serves as a mission statement for a band that went Gold while rarely answering to anyone but itself.","This Barsuk reissue features some ho-hum selections from Death Cab's first live show and a Smiths cover, but its real draw is the chance to re-evaluate a band that for many is still considered a dealbreaker.

Eccentric Soul: The Young Disciples,Various Artists,by: Joe Tangari,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929be08ea9e61561daa7826/1:1/w_160/74aa8bb8.jpg,2008-11-25 06:00:04,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12447-eccentric-soul-the-young-disciples/,Numero Group,"It's a distant memory these days, but East St. Louis was once a thriving city. As late as 1959, the liner notes for Numero's latest Eccentric Soul installment inform us, it was named an ""All-America"" city by the National Civic League. But as the 1960s rearranged the nation's landscape, East St. Louis sifted down to the bottom; before the decade was over, a quarter of its residents were unemployed, and many who did have jobs were underemployed. By 1967, street gangs and corruption-- as well as one of the nation's highest murder rates-- were all most Americans knew about the place that gave us Miles Davis. In a city where all the wheels had come off so quickly, the challenges for kids who wanted to make something of themselves were understandably immense. Enter Jackson, Tennessee native Allan Merry and the South End Neighborhood Opportunity Center. The son of teachers and an accomplished woodwind player who had toured or recorded with Curtis Amy, Ray Charles, Hank Williams Jr., and Little Richard, Merry was looking to settle, and the Opportunity Center's mission of keeping kids out of street gangs suited him. At first, he fit in teaching kids to play baseball and working to bring more kids to the Center, but as his musical ability became more and more obvious, kids started showing up for that, too. Faced with the influx, Merry had to figure out how to harness the creative energy of dozens of teenagers. He created a practice schedule and banned drugs and alcohol, recruited a local garage band to be the rhythm section, and generally made showing up worth the while of kids with no other artistic outlet. The whole conglomeration came to be called the Young Disciples, and in time, the funk-soul-jazz collective came to include male and female vocal groups (including the Primes and Primettes, coincidentally the same names that the Supremes and Temptations originally went by), funk outfits, solo acts, duos, dance troupes, and bands. The group had 30 members when it gave its first concert in October 1967. They played out, moved to a bigger practice space, recruited new members, traveled, secured grant funding and cheap equipment, and, finally, thought about recording. By this point, it was 1969, and the Young Disciples were a local institution. The YoDi, Gateway, and Merry family of labels began recording in St. Louis that year, and by 1970 they were able to book time in Memphis' legendary Sun studios. This continued through 1971, until the Young Disciples finally ran out of steam in 1972. So what does that recorded legacy sound like? Well, to say the handful of 45s the program left behind are worthy of reissue is an understatement. By the time they got into the studio, the Young Disciples, under any of the many names they issued 45s under, were a tight, forceful and imaginative unit. ""Crumbs from the Table,"" the A-side of the first Young Disciples Co. single is a stunning socially conscious funk workout. Larry Williams gives a raw, rhythmically dexterous lead vocal performance, the rhythm section is right on it, and the huge horn section sounds like a marching band thrilled to play something besides Sousa. The other Young Disciples Co. sides are from another universe-- ""Girls Girls Girls"" is a melodious soul ballad with great mixed-gender backing vocals, while ""Bang Bang Bang"" is an absolutely slamming party instrumental with a bit of cheerleader-ish chanting from the Primettes. Third Flight take their own pass at socially aware soul with ""Third Flight"", a psychedelic-tinged big band funk tune with astounding harmony vocals and a brilliant syncopated lead that tackles anti-cocaine lyrics. The troupe's facility with hard-hitting, uptempo soul produces many of the disc's other highlights, including the Georgettes' uptown girl group swinger ""Hard Hard"", and the majestic psychedelic soul cut ""Homeboy"" by Eddie Fisher & Allan Merry. The latter sounds like Sly & the Family Stone sucked into a vortex with the Art Ensemble of Chicago and a German electronic group. The Young Disciples had a lot of range, though, as proven by the Ames Harris Desert Water Bag Company's spooky funk crawler ""People"", which has a paranoid, acid-damaged tone that heightens the intensity of the spoken mid-section describing an urban hellscape. They also cut some excellent ballads in Memphis, principally Sharon Clark & the Product of Time's sweet Southern soul tune ""I'm Not Afraid of Love""-- if you've followed the Eccentric Soul series, you'll notice that this fits right in with the string-laden female soul tunes they're so fond of showcasing, like Franciene Thomas' ""Too Beautiful to Be Good"". Perhaps the songs that sums it all up the best, though, is LaVel Moore's heavily orchestrated ""The World Is Changing"", which manages capture the monumental shifts American society underwent in the 60s and somehow stay hopeful about it. Stories like Allan Merry's are what this series is made for, and this is a very rewarding Eccentric Soul volume, both for the story and the amazing music. It's good to think that most of the Young Disciples are still out there somewhere, carrying the experience forward with them. East St. Louis could probably use the inspiration of knowing that if something like this could happen there once, it could conceivably happen again. As it stands, the Young Disciples remain a bright, if fleeting, chapter in the city's history, and the recorded legacy stands as proof that good people can make a difference when given the chance.","Numero Group unearth another rewarding Eccentric Soul volume, both for its story and amazing music, which this time comes courtesy of East St. Louis' the Young Disciples.

Drippers EP,Black Moth Super Rainbow,by: Joe Colly,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929be1513d197565213b6af/1:1/w_160/4195b89b.jpeg,2008-11-25 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12459-drippers-ep/,70s Gymnastics,"Last month saw the release of Fucked Up Friends, the first solo album from a member of Pittsburgh surrealists Black Moth Super Rainbow. Recorded and performed by Tobacco, the band's reclusive frontman, the record aimed to transform BMSR's giddy psychedelia into instrumental hip-hop. With such a lateral move, the album also didn't offer clues to the course of BMSR's follow-up to 2007 breakout Dandelion Gum. And so we look to Drippers, an odds-and-sods EP aimed at avid fans (its release is limited to just 2,000-- no joke-- scratch'n'sniff copies) for some sense of what may come next from the group. Unfortunately, the EP doesn't hint at a shift in style or a new direction and, at worst, raises questions about their ability to work outside of an already established format. Part of Dandelion Gum's appeal was its ability to show an eerie, darker side of stargazing psych-pop-- its songs seeming to exist in the exact moment when an acid trip starts to go sour. The record's mix of electronics and more traditional instruments nurtured that atmosphere: The album's many treated vocals didn't seem gimmicky because they lent the record an air of detached strangeness. Virtually all of Drippers' nine songs lean heavily on the same analog synths-and-vocoder approach. Here, that combo starts to feel less like a creative tool and more like a formula. To be fair, not all of Drippers' tracks are recent however-- and at least one (""We Are the Pagans"") is an outtake from Gum. But it's harder to forgive the newer cuts: ""Black Yogurt"", which features a bubbly bassline courtesy of Mike Watt, cleverly bends its synths into vocal sounds-- a neat touch-- but is otherwise forgettable, its arrangement too similar to older material. Despite incorporating some of the fuzzy boom-bap that was prevalent on Fucked Up Friends, ""Milk Skates"" and ""One Day I Had an Extra Toe"" also stay within the group's neatly defined parameters. Said to pre-date BMSR's formation, ""I Saw Brown"" is one of the few tracks that sound unique-- a simple Sega Genesis beat sits next to a jerkily strummed acoustic guitar-- but it lacks melody and stops short of achieving listenability. Elsewhere, ""Zodiac Girls"" and ""Happy Melted City"" finds BMSR tweaking their formula-- the latter drawing on lush, almost shoegaze-y vocals amidst a backdrop of interplaying synths. It's precisely the kind of imaginative step the group should take. The spare, tape-hiss-heavy ""Changing You All"" is the closest this outfit gets to an expressive ballad, and it's a refreshing change of pace. Drippers' only real surprise is a remix of ""Just for the Night"" by D.C. singer/pianist Laura Burhenn. Here, Tobacco and co. build upon a rough sketch of a hip-hop underpinning and flesh out the original's sashaying doo-wop with synth flutters. It's the EP's final track, and it serves both as a palate cleanser and a reminder of what seems lacking from the album's lesser songs-- raw emotion and untreated vocals. Drippers is merely a stopgap partially constructed of older material, but it still seems like time to hope BMSR begins to step out from behind their masks, pseudonyms, and vocoders and give us something different.","This limited-edition, scratch'n'sniff EP (no, seriously) is the follow-up to 2007 breakout Dandelion Gum.

The '59 Sound,The Gaslight Anthem,by: Tom Breihan,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929be0f13d197565213b6a3/1:1/w_160/4da9d1dc.jpg,2008-11-25 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12454-the-59-sound/,SideOneDummy,"Here's Gaslight Anthem frontman Brian Fallon on ""Old White Lincoln"": ""I always dreamed of classic cars and movie screens and trying to find some way to be redeemed."" That about sums it up for these Jersey brats: redemption comes hand-in-hand with tailfins and Bogart. The Gaslight Anthem might work the Warped Tour mall-punk circuit, but they're not of it. Instead, they belong to an older breed of punk band, one we don't see to much anymore: Social Distortion, Alkaline Trio, fellow Jersey knuckleheads Bouncing Souls. These bands might be emotional, but they're about a million miles removed from emo, especially in the way that term gets tossed around now. These are the bands who sing in full-throated groan-man bellows, who unironically cover old country songs, who heroically keep the hair-grease industry afloat. The '59 Sound, the Gaslight Anthem's sophomore effort, comes steeped in retro signifiers: pinball, Audrey Hepburn pearls, your hightop sneakers and your sailor tattoos. One song is called ""Film Noir"" and another is called ""Here's Looking at You, Kid"", redundantly enough. But all this fuzzy-dice Fonzie nostalgia, this glorification of an imagined era this band isn't old enough to remember, isn't a cheap hook; it's an ingrained and sincere part of their identity. ""I always kinda sorta wish I looked like Elvis,"" Fallon shrugs on ""High Lonesome"". And then, almost as an afterthought, ""I always kinda sorta wished I was someone else."" The name that keeps coming up over and over when people discuss this band is Born to Run-era Bruce Springsteen, and it checks out. Fallon sings in the same sort of tremulous roar, and he's just as heroically unafraid of lyrical cliché. He might even take it too far in ""Meet Me By the River's Edge"", which is literally about washing your sins away by the goddamn river's edge. But that wholehearted embrace of worn-in tropes is a huge part of this band's charm. The closest thing we get to circa-2008 hardcore is the strangulated NYHC backing bark that disappears as soon as it arrives on ""The Patient Ferris Wheel"". The way the band channels their heroes, everything feels flattened out into a heartfelt mush. And because their inspirations are so internalized, the old songwriting tricks feel totally intuitive. The quiet-to-loud dynamics aren't forced, the ahh-ahh backing sighs come at the exact right moments, the church bells on the title track sound like god. These songs are simple, mostly, but they're executed perfectly. Fallon and guitarist Alex Rosamilia do this thing, mostly on the quiet bits, where their guitars wrap twinkly harmonies around each other, getting loose and intricate without being showy about it. And when the guitars turn into chorus-firepower, it just kills because it's been so long since we've heard anyone pull that off with such panache. If you've got even a tiny bit of a soft spot for that bruised-growl retro-punk, The '59 Sound is an answer to a prayer. And then there's that title track. It's a sort of meditation on a dead friend, Fallon imagining what might've gone through his head in the final moments: ""I wonder, were you scared when the metal hit the glass?"" He wonders if the dead guy got to hear his favorite song on his way to whatever afterlife he might be headed toward. And then, as the song gets ready to end, there's this flattening bridge where Fallon repeats, almost to himself, over and over, ""Young boys, young girls, ain't supposed to die on a Saturday night."" It's simple, it's sincere, and it kills me every time.","The Gaslight Anthem are Jersey punks enamored with Springsteen, Social Distortion, and the Clash, and their wholehearted embrace of familiar rock'n'roll tropes winds up being a huge part of their charm.

Wu: The Story of the Wu-Tang Clan,Wu-Tang Clan,by: Ian Cohen,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929be1feb335119a49ecff2/1:1/w_160/f5ab71a8.jpg,2008-11-25 06:00:01,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12468-wu-the-story-of-the-wu-tang-clan/,Legacy,"A few weeks ago, BET aired Wu: The Story of the Wu-Tang Clan, a documentary which promised never-before-seen footage of the Staten Island group's rise to fame. The accompanying soundtrack does absolutely nothing of the sort-- but really, that's sort of the point. Regardless of how many of us dutifully buck up every summer for Rock the Bells, there's still classic rock-style money to be made off the Wu-Tang legend. And invested parties can't always rely on merely pleasing those old enough to have skipped AP Calc so they could cop the enhanced-CD version of Wu-Tang Forever at the local Coconuts. After all, RZA told us we didn't even need to go to summer school as long as we had ""Black Shampoo"" and ""Dog Shit"" as educational guidance. Best-case scenario is that Wu reach the rarified territory of freshman dorm rack-fillers like Eagles Greatest Hits Vol. 1, Led Zeppelin IV, or that Doors double-LP with a shirtless Jim Morrison doing the Jesus Christ pose. Not in terms of sales, but in the manner in which it inspires you to purchase every single LP from the group within the span of a week, even to the point where you find yourself paying legal tender for motherfucking Coda (translates to ""Iron Flag"" in Wu-speak). It's hard not to see that being the case, because for a group not known as a singles act-- and whose studio records are considered sacrosanct-- the singles are more than adequate preparation for the deeper cuts. Judged by the music itself, Wu deserves some gaudy grade-- unsurprising, considering it contains half of Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers) and neglects anything that came out after the year 2000. Time has done nothing to lessen the impact of these tracks, and though the group has viciously asserted itself as purveyors of true hip-hop, the sheer physical violence of 36 Chambers (as many people quote the intro to ""Method Man"" as the song itself) made it crucially appeal to people who had no prior investment in the genre. Regardless of the punk approach to communitas on the mic (outside of starmaking single ""Method Man"") and production (the record is rumored to have been released unmastered by Loud), ""Bring Da Ruckus"" and ""Wu-Tang Clan Ain't Nuthing To F' Wit"" are themselves broadsides against whatever complacencies are pissing you off that day. There's little left to be said about these inclusions, though leaving off the more ""message"" selections (""Tearz"", ""Can It Be All So Simple"") indicates that Wu is first and foremost seeking to prove that the Clan was hook-filled if not necessarily pop in the traditional sense. Choices from the first round of solo releases are solid as well, drawing from the most sonically compatible records-- Ol' Dirty Bastard's ""Shimmy Shimmy Ya"" and Raekwon's ""Incarcerated Scarfaces"" remain admirable in their ability to condense two very different and very dense albums into concise single servings. Ghostface Killah's Ironman (bizarrely castigated at the time as a weak link) is repped twice-- ""Daytona 500"" will likely always remain the definitive interpolation of ""Nautilus"", while 100 bars and runnin' mixtape rambles will likely always have to answer to Cappadonna's stunning turn in ""Winter Warz"". Due to its chronology, Wu likely couldn't help but feel either unbalanced or oddly sequenced, but that's curiously not the case. Once Wu-Tang Forever is introduced, it feels like a completely clean break from anything before it. Deeper cuts hint at the sort of issues that would metastasize during the later part of the decade-- clashing agendas, general bloat, and RZA outsourcing beats to talented but less interesting disciples while fancying himself as more of a traditional ""musician."" Despite how it was held as a beacon of old-school craftsmanship in light of Bad Boy and No Limit, the strange thing about the Forever songs is how functional some of the beats sound. Can you even remember how the actual music to ""Triumph"" goes? It may have been out of necessity-- as dense and visceral as the Clan was on 36 Chambers, nearly every member had simply grown too metaphysically big for another 50-minute format. Even the singles from Forever feature writing of astonishing compositional complexity-- particularly for an album that sold several million copies during one of hip-hop's more vapid stretches. Rhymes in the past weren't difficult to parse, more likely relying on blunt simile and battering ram brute force-- ""I'll scream on your ass like your dad,"" ""I make more noise than heavy metal."" Meanwhile, ""Reunited"" and ""Triumph"" boast some of the most iconic introductory verses in hip-hop, the latter so intimidating in its perfection that GZA made the legendary claim that no one was initially willng to follow Inspectah Deck on the track. After that, Wu just sort of stops altogether, ignoring the second-gen solo drops with the exception of Cappadonna's spittle-flecked ""Run"", a track whose thunder has been co-opted by Ghostface's song of the same name and subject matter (you can't fuck with that orange furry hat). The W piggybacked off the goodwill earned by Supreme Clientele, returning to a grimier, subterranean production aesthetic and featuring some of Ghost's most off-the-chain ramblings. Yet, its sole contribution to this disc is the embarrassingly gimmick ""Gravel Pit"", descirbed by RZA in The Wu-Tang Manual as ""sober,"" a claim that its attendant video goes to great lengths to refute. So yeah, it's easy to criticize how Wu leaves out a lot of the fun extraneous bullshit that's as noteworthy as the songs themselves-- ""Wu Wear (The Garment Renaissance)"", 1-900-RAEKWON, Killah Priest somehow going gold, a video game of unfathomable shittiness. Wu never had much chance of fulfilling the promise of its title within the span of a single hour (in fact, it merely steals its name from the documentary), still, as far as stocking-stuffers go, it's hard to advise against it as a smart expenditure or guidelines for a great mixtape-- just make sure you have Liquid Swords readily available when whoever you give this to inevitably asks for it.","If you need a one-hour primer to Wu-Tang circa 1993-2000, you could do a lot worse than this record, created to accompany a BET documentary on the early days of the legendary hip-hop collective.

Prospekt’s March EP,Coldplay,by: Ryan Dombal,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Features Editor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929be1e13d197565213b6bb/1:1/w_160/76580305.jpg,2008-11-25 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12467-prospekts-march-ep/,Capitol,"With this year's Viva La Vida or Death and All His Friends, Coldplay tried to be cool. They brought in Brian Eno to refine their bombast. They tried Bowie-style funk and shoegaze. They wore military duds that made them look like Arcade Fire. Everything seemed to be in place. But there was a problem: Coldplay's idea of cool and the cultural reality are two different things. This eight-track stopgap EP-- which doubles as a bonus disc on the obligatory Viva fourth-quarter deluxe edition-- allows for an assessment of Coldplay's 2008 ""We Are Edgy"" campaign. Can one daffy Brit and his personality-averse band bring the notion of cool closer to them? Ostensibly, Coldplay know cool when they see it. They tapped operatic indie-rockers Shearwater and L.E.S. revivalist Santogold to open their world tour this year. Chris Martin is friends with Kanye West and Jay-Z, who contributes a verse on the Prospekt's March remix, ""Lost +"". Still, they lack the spontaneity, innovation, and effortlessness that usually accompanies edge-cutting phenomena. Take their recent performance on ""Saturday Night Live"": For a guy who's played to millions of fans at shows, festivals, and on TV, Martin came off like a clutzy ham not unlike former ""SNL"" mainstay Mary Katherine Gallagher. He was startlingly out of breath and made an effort to act out each of his simple couplets, all while yipping and hooting like a man poking fun at Tourette's syndrome. It was awkward, but kinda endearing. (Defamer: Coldplay's 'SNL' Freak-Out: Easy-Listening Performance Art, Awful, Or Both?) So when calm and collected artists like Jay-Z cite Coldplay as their favorite band, they're subconsciously subverting the same untouchable aura that bolsters their own coolness. It makes little sense, but it's worked for them thus far. On the overall hipness scale, Coldplay isn't close to, say, TV on the Radio, but in a weird way they're bringing a bumbling DIY aesthetic to emotional arena rock. And, just as Viva did an admirable job of troubleshooting the band's lazy weaknesses while expanding their sound, Prospekt's March offers a truncated version of their svelte and marginally progressive new formula. If this is the best Big Rock has to offer this year, we're doing okay. As far as money-making mini-releases go, Prospekt's March is relatively noble, i.e., no quickie dance remixes, only one ""single edit"" (""Lovers in Japan"") and one piddly 48-second instrumental (""Postcards from Far Away""). All in all, half the EP is made up of completely new material that could've easily made the original Viva. Talking about the EP a couple months ago, Martin quipped that the new songs ""might be considered too catchy or too heavy for Coldplay songs."" The heavy Coldplay song may seem like an oxymoronic concept, but ""Glass of Water"" makes a good case for the band turning up the volume more often. Granted, the whole thing centers around one of the very few Meaning of Life clichés Martin has yet to utilize (bet you can't guess exactly how much water is in that glass!), but the hook's brash guitars render his words unintelligible anyway. With Eno behind the knobs, everything sounds pristine, impeccable. ""Prospekt's March/Poppyfields"" could pass for a latter-day Radiohead ballad (except Martin replaces Thom Yorke's doom with hopeful pleads of ""I don't wanna die""). With its micro-funk verse and symphony chorus, ""Rainy Day"" feels stiched together, but it's uniquely humble. ""I love it when you come over to my house,"" sings Martin, taking a break from explaining death and all his friends for a moment. Mostly instrumental Viva intro ""Life in Technicolor"" is morphed into a full-fledged song here-- and it in turn exposes the main obstacle in the way of Coldplay's desire to replicate U2 at their height. Simply: Chris Martin needs to consider his lyrics more. He's smart; he can do better than ""don't you wish your life could be as simple as fish swimmin' 'round in a barrel when you've got the gun."" While Bono hasn't written an astounding lyric in ages, there was a time when his universal maxims rang true and felt close. Martin has shown flashes of this type of talent, but his consistency isn't where it needs to be in order for Coldplay to elevate to the supreme stadium-filling, critic-salivating level they so desire. With their revised sound and twitching energy, these sensitive lads are primed for something even bigger than their current little-kid-in-a-big-arena shenanigans. A few elegant, cringe-proof words couldn't hurt.","This eight-track stopgap EP-- which doubles as a bonus disc on the obligatory Viva fourth-quarter deluxe edition-- allows for an assessment of Coldplay's 2008 ""We Are Edgy"" campaign.

Canopy Glow,Anathallo,by: Ian Cohen,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929be175e6ef959693231d1/1:1/w_160/82cdad1d.jpg,2008-11-24 06:00:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12461-canopy-glow/,Anticon,"Two points of clarification: Canopy Glow represents significant progress from Anathallo's 2006 debut Floating World, an album that, to put it mildly, we didn't care much for-- if you're not into Sufjan band-wagoneering or Mars Volta's conceptual tomfoolery, let alone a garish synthesis of the two, you possibly felt the same way. But Canopy Glow is close enough in sonic character to its predecessor that its release on hip-hop label Anticon feels like one of the oddest pairings in recent years. The immediate difference on Canopy Glow is Anathallo's decision to slim down while somehow getting their weight up-- in the time it takes to read this review, you might watch only two Floating World song titles scroll across an iPod screen; most songs feel padded beyond six minutes, something you might expect on a record centered around Japanese folklore. Like much of Canopy Glow, ""Noni's Field"" takes its time emerging from its reverby cloak, but after the sleep is shaken out it builds to a rousing chant that sets the stage for LP highlight ""Italo"". Title aside, it's less Sally Shapiro than Sufjan Stevens, as Anathallo subtly mix fractured meters and a dirgey minor progression that gives the track an unsettling undertow. Such grounding is rare on much of the record-- like a band class show-and-tell, Anathallo go gonzo for every instrument except bass, leaving wispy tunes like ""Northern Lights"" and ""John J. Audubon"" to float rudderless. In a foolhardy or thoughtless bit of self-promotion, Anathallo liken themselves to a ""marching band gone wild"" (at least it's not ""on acid""), which is unfortunately inaccurate on two fronts. Canopy Glow often lacks the propulsion that could inspire couch-bound channel surfing, let alone marching-- which is pretty inexplicable for a band that claims six out of its seven members as percussionists. And even as indie's obsession with orchestral arrangements appears to wane, there's still nothing particularly wild about Canopy Glow's puffy souflees-- though some fawn over the fact they have toured with two glockenspiel players, those guys need to actually do something other than come off like baroque-pop SW1s. Still, Anathallo are learning on the job, even if they seem bound to play, at best, second fiddle/banjo/bassoon to Sufjan and his crew's increasingly suspicious absence. Too many of Anathallo's peers from the aborted blog uprising of 2006 took a lack of immediate success defensively and ungracefully bowed out, so it's heartening to see them so willing to ride this bells-and-whistles thing until the wheels fall off. And really, hanging out with an unexpected patron saint like Yoni Wolf can probably only lead to good things (particularly since he knows how to make a xylophone bump). But for the time being, the unnatural and unnerving smoothness of Canopy Glow shows that if there was any one Anticon record that deserved to be called Alopecia, it's this one.","Blog-rock 06 vets still sound like Sufjan Stevens despite releasing their latest on hip-hop label Anticon.

You'll Never Play This Town Again,Harry Pussy,by: Douglas Wolk,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929be0a5e6ef959693231b9/1:1/w_160/5f7782e8.jpg,2008-11-24 06:00:04,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12449-youll-never-play-this-town-again/,Load,"Harry Pussy were just about the most abrasive band America has ever seen, and their final shift from something like noise to something like hardcore only made them scrappier. Over the course of their last few months together, the Florida-based trio blazed across the U.S. like a Molotov cocktail, playing the same 10 or so songs over and over and over. Their earlier records had mostly been unrepeatable experiments; this time, their repertoire had reproducible phenomena, and they proved it by cranking out recordings of it. There was an untitled studio record, sometimes simply called Fuck You; there were a handful of singles reprising the same material; there was Live at Salon Zwerge, Live Fuck Love Songs, and finally Live, a blistering document of their final show on May 5, 1997. This 42-track compilation includes most of those records, which means a lot of the same titles recur. (There are five versions of ""Smash the Mirror"", for instance; the 18-minute Salon Zwerge is an extended take on ""Mandolin"", which appears in three other versions.) Perversely enough, that makes it more listenable rather than less. Hear a late-model Harry Pussy song once, and it sounds like a formless blurt-- a blast of noise that everyone somehow manages to stop playing at the same time. Hear it a few times, and you'll start to hear the joints and folds in it, and the way it falls into shape. Hear three or four or five different takes on it, and it usually turns out to be a through-composed structure. The spurting heart of the band was singer/drummer Adris Hoyos, for whom ""singer"" and ""drummer"" aren't really adequate descriptions. Hoyos screeched so hard it's tough to imagine how she ever spoke afterwards, alternating between a roar of pure wronged loathing and a stabbing-victim squeal; her job on the drum kit wasn't to keep a beat, but to flail the living shit out of it until the song was over. Bill Orcutt and Dan Hosker, both hammering at detuned guitars, took their cues from Hoyos's voice-- it's a kick when they suddenly fall into a rhythm at the end of ""Sex Problem"", as Hoyos's free-form screams about loneliness and ambivalence resolve into a chant of ""I like girls, trust me. I like girls, trust me. I like girls, trust me. I like girls, trust me. I like girls, but sex scares me."" (It's regrettable that this reissue doesn't include lyrics; they're good, and they're not often intelligible.) As a sort of conceptual grounding for Harry Pussy's idea of songwriting, there are a handful of apropos covers here: a half-strangled take on O.D.F.X.'s twenty-second ejaculation ""Drop the A Bomb on Me"", a reasonably faithful version of Teenage Jesus & the Jerks' ""Orphans"", a Neanderthal reduction of Kraftwerk's ""Showroom Dummies"". But the core of the album is their own final, distilled, impossibly corrosive songlets, and the bloodthirsty, rageful glee Hoyos brings to them. In the middle of their final show, Hoyos calls for ""Chuck!"", a song they'd played four minutes earlier. Orcutt and Hosker evidently give her a quizzical look. ""CHUCK!"", she announces again. And off they go.","This 42-track compilation features a trio of live records, a handful of singles, and an untitled studio record from just about the most abrasive band America has ever seen.

Tronic,Black Milk,by: Ian Cohen,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929be0c13d197565213b69d/1:1/w_160/f16e0312.jpg,2008-11-24 06:00:03,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12451-tronic/,Fat Beats,"Blame it on trickle-down economics, but things just ain't the same for superproducers-- not only have guys like Timbaland, Pharrell, and Kanye stuck with the steadier pop/R&B dollar (or priced themselves out of hip-hop), you'd be hard-pressed to find any of the up-and-comers who could truly go multimedia (though it's not for Polow da Don's lack of effort). Which leaves Black Milk on something of a singular plane-- he's just a super producer (and MC) with an album mindset, and Tronic just might be his boldest statement yet, far exceeding the modest nature of its Fat Beats origin. In fact, Tronic could very well be the best end-to-end production job you've heard all year. It's hard to talk about anything Black Milk does without evoking J. Dilla, but even though there's a blatant nod here to the structure of Midnight Marauders, I'm hearing a real ATLiens vibe in the gorgeous, almost dubby undertow to the lunar sonics*.* The album cover is no ruse, as this is the most electro of Milk's productions, but he combines clubby textures and warm EQing in a way that begs for headphone listening even at its hardest knock. So the ""Knight Rider"" bassline of ""Bounce"" is counterbalanced by swirling, psychedelic keys and what initially sounds like an accordion on ""Tronic Summer"" turns out to be a sweltering vocoder. Though in no way a concept album, Tronic is meant to be consumed whole and some of the interstitial moments are the most rewarding-- ""Losing Out"" tumbles into an erratic drum'n'bass beat reminiscent of the Roots' ""You Got Me"", while the sprightly strings that take up the final 20 seconds of ""Hell Yeah"" feel like a lost treasure. This is a Black Milk album, so you know the drums are going to hit hard, but a lot of tracks sound like he's imported ""Tekken"" combos into his MPC. There often isn't a traditional earworm beyond the way Milk interacts with his beats-- ""Give the Drummer Sum"" features a Quasimoto-like chant on the chorus, but the real hook is how Milk pulls tricks like dropping out the drums on the line ""let the organ get a stab at it."" He practically lives inside the beats, and ""Try"" is something of a conversation with a soul sample from an artist who promised to stay away from them (a concession similar to Kanye's intro on ""Everything I'm Not""). But if you're wondering why that number up there isn't higher, well, here's the thing-- I'd hate to give Milk more reason to get defensive about his mic skills, since far too much of Tronic is muddled by saber rattling over haters who doubt his flow. First off, exactly which corner of the internet spends its time hating on Black Milk? Moreover, he's more than nice with his, considering that if he learned anything from Dilla, it's how to make electronically based hip-hop jiggle organically. That's some pretty bumpy mixed meter terrain he's able to traverse on songs like ""Hold It Down"" and ""Overdose"". While he's every bit as thoughtful about his penmanship as he is about his production, Milk is nowhere near as adventurous. As was the case with Popular Demand and even the split he did with Fat Ray from earlier this year, you get the odd feeling that Milk put his heart into his work, and yet it feels slightly impersonal, save for the career summary ""Long Story Short"". Beyond his battle rhyming, he most frequently rails against the current state of hip-hop, but his lines are so vague that they actually fail to indict anyone. Even while the kiss-off of hangers-on ""Without U"" resembles Slum Village at its most softbatch, the topicality, at least, is welcome. Tronic usually finds Milk's humility working in his favor, however, since he has no qualms about being a facilitator. Royce Da 5'9"" breaks hip-hop's silence on Kwame Kilpatrick and absolutely shreds ""Losing Out"", and ""The Matrix"" is pure Soundbombing bait for those stuck in the one-nine-nine-nine: a reinvigorated Primo scratches while Milk trades verses with a typically old-man strength 16 from Sean P and Pharaohe Monch dropping a spectacular dud of a punchline likely causing agita at a message board near you (""Like pants legs around the ankles of hipsters-- I'm tight!"") Unfortunately, it makes me think back to something Wale spoke to on ""The Perfect Plan""-- ""Instead of singing our praise they do/ Raise the bar to a level unattainable."" But it's to Black Milk's credit that so much is expected out of him. Maybe he's got the Detroit Chronic in him-- something with Elzhi (where's he?), Royce, and fuck, who's Eminem getting beats from these days?-- but for now, Tronic is one hell of a holding pattern.","Detroit producer and Slum Village associate continues to work at a very high level, with hard-hitting beats and textures ready for both clubs and headphones. Guests include Pharoahe Monch, DJ Premier, and Royce da 5'9"".

Electric Arguments,The Fireman,by: Stuart Berman,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929be1c13d197565213b6b8/1:1/w_160/6594a6d3.jpg,2008-11-24 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12465-electric-arguments/,One Little Indian,"With the possible exception of the Starbucks employees forced to listen to it on repeat, Paul McCartney's 2007 release, Memory Almost Full was his most warmly received album in years, debuting in the Billboard top five and selling more than a million copies in the U.S.-- his first stateside platinum disc in nearly a quarter century. The album didn't transcend McCartney's notoriously sentimental tendencies, but it provided enough evidence that his sense of adventure hadn't vanshed. But then, Memory Almost Full's success was arguably less a product of content as circumstance: It was preceded by the sympathies he gained from a nasty divorce and a much-publicized move from EMI to Starbucks' Hear Music label, making him a rock dinosaur fearlessly adapting to an ever-changing music industry. Fast forward a year and Starbucks is struggling to move frappuccinos let alone CDs, and the coffee conglomerate put Hear Music on ice this past summer. That an artist of McCartney's stature would quickly find another label home (ATO in the U.S.; One Little Indian in the UK) is no surprise; that he's using the occasion to resurrect his long-dormant alter ego the Fireman-- a sporadic recording collaboration with producer/ex-Killing Jokester Youth-- constitutes an unexpected, brow-raising move for an artist known for his play-it-safe crowd-pleasing. And where the Fireman's two prior records-- 1993's Strawberries Oceans Ships Forests and 1998's Rushes-- were anonymous collections of post-Orb ambient instrumentals, Electric Arguments is a work of full-blooded (and fully voiced) anthemic pop music that's being actively promoted by the duo. But even with this newfound populist intent, Electric Arguments holds onto an original Fireman ideal: to make Paul McCartney sound less like Paul McCartney. That it does so within more traditional pop-song presentations-- while steering clear of McCartney's usual preferences for piano-pounded rockers and string-sweetened ballads-- is the ultimate testament to its success. Electric Arguments presents not so much an abrupt break from typical McCartneyisms as a gradual drift away from them. The album actually picks up right where Memory Almost Full's blooze-explosive closer ""Nod Your Head"" left off, with McCartney adopting a comically over-the-top growl for the Zep-heavy ""Nothing Too Much Just Out of Sight"". Rather than set a blustery tone for the rest of the album, the song effectively wipes the slate clean for the more meditative music to come-- it's immediately followed by ""Two Magpies"", whose lo-fi acoustic ambience and brushed-snare beat harkens back to the homespun charm of 1971's classic Ram. But it's third track ""Sing the Changes"" where the album's identity comes into focus: McCartney opts for a higher register, while Youth imports some of the Big Music expanse he's lent to recordings by the Verve and U2; the fact both verse and chorus share the same ascendant melody only enhances the song's buoyant, new-day-rising feel. ""Dance 'Til We're High"" works a similarly widescreen formula to even more rousing effect, with exuberant violin sweeps and a church bell-punctuated chorus. Collectively, these songs imagine an alternate 1980s for McCartney, had he more eagerly answered the challenge laid down by the new generation of British pop stars (instead of churning out anodyne, adult-contemporary pap like Pipes of Peace and writing jingles for Rupert the Bear). Throughout Electric Arguments, you can hear McCartney make great efforts to obscure his voice by playing to its extremities, whether adopting a deep, wizardly tone for prog-folk odyssey ""Traveling Light"" or double-tracking his falsetto and growl on the cheeky country-gospel workout ""Light From Your Lighthouse"". Or, on the album's two complementary centerpieces-- ""Lifelong Passion (Sail Away)"" and ""Is This Love?""-- he sublimates his voice to the textural haze around him. As the titles indicate, these are love songs, but ones devoid of the usual McCartneyian romanticism. Rather, with their highlands-bound stomps, synthesized bagpipe reels, and floating flute lines, they present love as the messy, mysterious head-trip that it is-- and when McCartney repeats the line ""be my lifelong passion,"" the quiet desperation in his voice betrays the fact that he once lost his. Following these emotional peaks, Electric Arguments loses it way in the home stretch: With its faux-gothic ambience, ""Lovers in a Dream"" hews too close to Enigma-level chill-out cheese, and the would-be climactic rock-out ""Universal Here, Everlasting Now"" is undermined by a dated, ""Miami Vice"" chase-theme quality. But given McCartney's long-standing efforts to assert that he-- not John-- was the most avant-garde Beatle, the Fireman thus serves a purpose analogous to Nick Cave's similarly named, equally deconstructive Grinderman project: To get its primary songwriter back to where he once belonged.","Paul McCartney resurrects his long-dormant alter ego, teams with producer Youth, and makes an album that can honestly be called ""Beatleseque.""

Murmur [Deluxe Edition],R.E.M.,by: Stephen M. Deusner,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929be1a13d197565213b6b6/1:1/w_160/2bdc34fa.jpg,2008-11-24 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12464-murmur-deluxe-edition/,IRS,"One of the talking points about R.E.M.-- one of the traits listed to distinguish them from many other bands of the 1980s, mainstream or otherwise-- was their stringent democracy. Each member received equal songwriting credit on each track on each album, and reportedly each member not only had equal voice in decisions, but the band would do nothing unless everyone agreed unanimously. Theirs was a ""unique four-person democracy that in practice maximalized the talents and insights of four people rather than just one leader calling the shots,"" writes I.R.S. Records co-founder Jay Boberg in the liners for this new 2xCD reissue of Murmur, the band's first and best full-length. When the band triumphed, all of its members shared the acclaim; when it failed, everyone shouldered the blame. This was an atypical business model, but R.E.M. displayed a seemingly contradictory mix of egolessness and ambition. The group pointedly didn't appear on its album covers or inner sleeves; instead, R.E.M. remained confident that a kudzu-covered ravine or a folk-art painting could speak more strongly about their music than their own presence ever could. Coupled with that air of mystery, R.E.M.'s practical democracy simultaneously stemmed from and extended to their music. They treated each instrument as essentially equal: Bill Berry's no-fills drums, Peter Buck's spiky guitar, Mike Mills' melodic bass, and Michael Stipe's grainy voice. Because these elements were characters in an equally weighted exchange, the remastering on this version of Murmur (overseen by Greg Calbi) makes it more than simply an anniversary repackaging, but a careful reconsideration that not only changes the lines of dialogue, but alters the entire conversation. Every unique strike of Berry's high-hat and snare becomes discernible, giving his rhythms greater urgency and force. Likewise, Mills' bass gets lower and richer, and his keyboard adds intricate textures to these songs: ""Pilgrimage"" is layered with reverberating low-end piano and vibraphone, and his honkytonk piano gives ""Shaking Through"" its country transcendence. Mills' backing vocals are emphasized to reinforce their point-counterpoint interplay with Stipe on ""Radio Free Europe"" and ""West of the Fields"". This new remaster doesn't throw off the band's equilibrium: The instruments are somehow now sound even more equal. It does, however, shift the discussion slightly away from some of the typical influences ascribed to the band-- namely, the Byrds-- and toward the more strident sounds of British postpunk acts like PiL and Gang of Four, whom the band has cited as part of their inspiration but are often overlooked. This dimension of their sound is most apparent in Buck's fretwork; sure, it jangles, but that term has lost some of its evocative sheen through overuse. His guitar also chimes and shuffles and burrs and bellows its way through Murmur, giving ""9-9"" and ""West of the Fields"" their jitteriness. Stipe sing-speaks aggressively through the former but, fortunately, the remaster does nothing to elucidate his vocals. No longer the mumbler heard on the Chronic Town EP, he enunciates more clearly on Murmur, yet there remains an unpracticed quality to his performance. Stipe switches between a wordless careen and a precise croon, reaching into his upper register on ""Radio Free Europe"" and into his lower on ""Catapult"". He indulges a slight yodel on ""Moral Kiosk"" and ends ""We Walk"" with a strange hiccup. Over the course of the album, his slur is more pronounced but still inscrutable, and he covers his lyrics in layers of ambiguity. There's a historical component to Murmur that often gets lost: In 1983, R.E.M. sounded unique. No bands were combining these particular influences in this particular way, which made this debut sound not only new but even subversive: a sharp reimagining of rock tropes. Twenty-five years and 14 albums later, our familiarity with R.E.M. means that Murmur has lost some of what made it revolutionary upon release. Fortunately, rather than collecting obligatory bonus tracks and outtakes-- most of which would have overlapped with Dead Letter Office-- the set includes a second disc documenting a show in Toronto from July 1983, just after the album's release. It marks the first time a full R.E.M. show has been released on CD (LIVE, from 2007, was culled from two nights in Dublin), and judging by the intensity with which the band run through old and then-new songs, it could have held its own as a separate release. It's startling to hear some of these songs stripped down to their four basic elements, with no keyboard or guitar overdubs. Likewise, it's a bit odd to hear only polite applause after ""7 Chinese Brothers"", which would appear on Reckoning a year later, and surprising to hear people scream for ""Boxcars"" and a cover of the Velvet Underground's ""There She Goes Again"" (which they play) and especially ""Shaking Through"" (which they don't). Live, Stipe deploys an even wider arsenal of vocal tics: vamping on ""Just a Touch"", growling the chorus of ""Talk About the Passion"", and sing-speaking through a jaw-dropping ""9-9"", all while Mills' backing vocals soar overheard and Buck's guitar chimes reliably on every song. Because they were known primarily as a live band, and because they built their identity as such when the industry avenues of promotion failed them, this live disc, much like the remaster, goes a long way toward re-creating for listeners the context in which R.E.M. introduced themselves and making these familiar songs once again excitingly unfamiliar.","The legendary band reissues and remasters its debut, and still arguably best, album, adding a bonus disc that marks the first time a full R.E.M. show has been released on CD

Stick 2 the Script,Statik Selektah,by: Tom Breihan,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929be115e6ef959693231c6/1:1/w_160/0bd2033f.jpg,2008-11-21 06:00:05,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12456-stick-2-the-script/,Showoff,"East Coast headknock-rap needs its own DJ Khaled apparently, and Massachusetts DJ/producer Statik Selektah is that person. Just like the Miami loudmouth, Statik has a nice thing going, consistently releasing surprisingly enjoyable, guest-crammed compiations. Some crucial differences, though. Unlike Khaled, Statik mostly avoids screaming bullshit all over his own tracks. I'll also take Termanology, Statik's personality-free rapping protégé, over Ace Hood, Khaled's personality-free rapping protégé. And even though most of them are trapped in either major-label limbo or indie-label hell, Statik's guests generally sound like they're having more fun than the gazillionaires on the Khaled albums. Stick 2 the Script, Statik's sophomore effort, might not make too many year-end lists, but two-thirds of it provides a remarkably solid listen-- thanks in large part to Statik's production. Statik's beats are mostly Premier-inspired boom-bap, which nobody seems to do well anymore. But Statik knows what he's doing: scratchy choruses, chopped-up drums, occasional flourishes of horn or guitar. Lead single ""To the Top (Stick 2 the Script)"" has a weird cut-up hotel-jazz beat that somehow stays propulsive because of those drums. The State Property half-reunion ""All 2gether Now"" has a great little ominous churn with fuzzed-out synth-squeals over the top. And even the token Houston-rap track ""Get Out the Way"" stays with the boom-bap blueprint rather than shooting for imitation Rap-A-Lot house production. In fact, the only time Statik leaves his wheelhouse is on the G-funk experiment ""Cali Nights"", which is sort of a disaster. As for the guests, there's a big divide between the veterans who've actually had radio play and the new-jack torch-carriers destined for obscurity. Older guys like Redman or CL Smooth have an innate understanding of how to mix technical skill with big-room charisma. Jadakiss murders ""For the City"" with matter-of-fact coldness: ""Bullets, gunsmoke, and cocaine residue/ Leave me the fuck alone, that's what you better do."" The State Property guys, who were flirting with stardom just a few years ago, come particularly animated, especially Peedi Crakk: ""I got a natural get-at-you flow/ It's like a animal, a cannibal, call me Hannibal Crakker, whoa!"" And, on ""Mr. Popularity"", Kanye associate Consequence redeems a corny concept (he uses the word ""pop"" as much as possible) with pure plosive-exploding technique. As for the newer guys...meh. There's a whole lot of bitching about the current state of rap, mostly because guys like Saigon are mad it's not particularly hospitable to guys like, say, Saigon. ""Streets of MA"" is the all-Boston posse-cut nobody outside of New England was anticipating. And if you ever wanted to hear a for-the-ladies track from random mixtape types like Skyzoo and Joell Ortiz, well, you're fucking insane and I'm scared of you, but there's one here. But even the lamer moments are mostly inoffensive, and they're over quickly. Stick 2 the Script's 18 tracks fly by in a brisk 53 minutes-- not even Termanology gets a chance to hog the mic too much. The record's mostly pure amber nostalgia-- there's even a Mad Rapper skit-- and it's not going to pull hip-hop's focus off the South, but I wouldn't mind hearing a couple more of these Statik Selektah albums. That's something I can't say about DJ Khaled.","Like an East Coast version of DJ Khaled, Massachusetts DJ/producer Statik Selektah has a nice thing going, consistently releasing surprisingly enjoyable, guest-crammed headknock-rap.

(k)no(w)here,Wilderness,by: Amy Granzin,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929be12ea9e61561daa783b/1:1/w_160/40d4d07f.jpg,2008-11-21 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12457-knowhere/,Jagjaguwar,"To the indifferent, Wilderness have now made the same album three times. Or to be really reductive, the same long track. Such sweeping dismissals aren't entirely misguided: Wilderness relentlessly and, yes, perhaps redundantly have their own thing going on. To Wilderness fans, however, that thing the band does-- ominously pitched post-rock-- is mostly compelling, often mesmerizing, and occasionally sublime. Of course, becoming a fan means a willingness to submit to James Johnson's assaultive yowls and Colin McCann's lacerating guitar. Wilderness aren't just offering daft indulgences, though. As others, including Pitchfork's Brian Howe have suggested, they're a serious, cerebral outfit aiming to exorcise their collective anxieties. And despite the band's two-year hiatus, (k)no(w)here's incremental shifts-- slower tempos, starker arrangements, and the addition of McCann's high, keening backing vocals (which, somewhat disconcertingly, recall Journey's Steve Perry)-- advance the drama. ""High Nero"" opens the album with a pensive ambient wash, setting up the jolting entrance of tom throbs, reverbed guitar, and vocal wails all the more jolting. Will Goode and Brian Gossman's superb rhythm section has been overshadowed by Johnson's emoting, but it's pretty close to centerstage on (k)no(w)here. ""Soft Cage""'s meticulous drum patter and cool, stalking bass are reminders of why this band earns favorable Fugazi comparisons. And thanks to a deliberate and measured rhythmic core, ""Chinese Whisperers"" sounds more ragged and sprawling than anything Wilderness have done, . An even more subtle development-- ""subtle"" because Wilderness' lyrics are rarely intelligible anyway-- is Johnson's growing distrust of language. The singer's culture-jamming, anti-capitalist lyrics have never relied much on grammar and syntax, but at points in the record he eschews familiar or even representational sounds altogether. This makes more sense when you consider that (k)no(w)here's almost-continuous song stream (notched into eight individual tracks on the album) was composed to support visual artist Charles Long's installation at this year's Whitney Biennial. Long previously collaborated with Stereolab, and if you've seen the artist's playful yet melancholy junk assemblages and bird excrement sculptures, the partnership holds a kind of logic. In fact, now that they've literally made art-rock, perhaps that will close the loop on the band's singular aesthetic and we'll get a fourth album that doesn't sound, to the cynics, exactly like the other three.","Wilderness return from a two-year hiatus with a few incremental shifts, including slower tempos, starker arrangements, and more emphasis on the band's superb rhythm section.

Hurricane,Grace Jones,by: Joshua Klein,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929be0e5e6ef959693231c0/1:1/w_160/37ddd59f.jpg,2008-11-21 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12453-hurricane/,Wall of Sound,"When Grace Jones emerged after a prolonged self-imposed exile as part of last summer's Massive Attack-curated Meltdown festival-- at 60, fearlessly clad in a corset and thong-- she was met with the predictable cries of comeback. But Jones' performance felt less like a resurrection and more like a return, comet-like. After all, how can a personality as huge as Jones' ever really vanish? She might slip off to the side, but she's never really gone. All the same, Hurricane is Jones' first new album in nearly 20 years. And unlike her revered early material from the 1980s, which found her reinventing and often outright owning songs by the Normal, Pretenders, Iggy Pop, the Police, Tom Petty, and Roxy Music, Hurricane features all originals, each a Jones co-write at that. Yet Jones' collaborators clearly had a notion of what songs-- and what sounds-- would be a good fit for her, and space-age riddims seem to be it this time around. In fact, at first the disc almost seems to be returning the favor to Bristol's best, sometimes sounding like a tribute or lost sequel to Massive Attack's Mezzanine, recreating that oddly timeless album's dubby menace. But the resemblance may be mostly coincidence, a product of circumstance. At least some of Hurricane was reportedly recycled from several sessions stretching back as far as a decade, including the titular first single, a Tricky collaboration. He's not alone among the disc's many guests, either, which include Brian Eno, Tony Allen, and the indomitable Sly & Robbie, always Jones' greatest ally, foil, and support team. But this being Grace Jones, she easily upstages her contingent of helpers. Indeed, Jones isn't so much a singer as a force of nature, a black hole that pulls all attention right to its center. Or, to invoke the more terrestrial metaphor of the album's title track: ""I can be cool, soft like the breeze/ I'll be a hurricane, ripping up trees!"" That nicely sums up the album's dual strengths, with Jones taking charge as one-woman wrecking crew but, more surprisingly, occasionally ratcheting things down to an introspective and intimate level as well. Jones also proclaims that she can give birth to sheep, so her particular brand of crazy is never far behind. But if it's Jones' kookiness that keeps her so interesting, it's her instinct for strong material that makes her so compelling. Surely, as far as reintroductions go, the opening ""This Is"" is killer, its relentless dancehall pulse as ear-catching as Jones' angular form is ever eye-catching. Immediately, however, the Wendy and Lisa co-write ""Williams' Blood"" reveals a new, explicitly autobiographical side to Jones, as she pays tribute to her mother Marjorie and the gift of music she passed down to her daughter. The track is a tour de force, from its turn to the dark and electric to its passing quote of ""Amazing Grace"". ""Corporate Cannibal"", at one point the title of the album, is stranger but also slightly aware of its own ridiculousness. ''I'll consume my consumers, with no sense of humor,"" Jones growls, before kicking into throbbing low-end gear. ""I'm Crying (Mother's Tears)"" is slower and suppler, giving Jones a chance to hit a few notes as she once again honors her mother. From here on out, Hurricane is classic Jones. ""Well Well Well"", ""Sunset Sunrise"", and the creeping ""Love You to Life"" are all reggae-rock hybrids that would fit any year in the past 30, and the pummeling slo-mo electro-dub of title track a statement of purpose if ever there was one. ""Devil in My Life"" ends the disc on a restrained industrial note, its lyrics apparently drawn from an evening spent people watching at a party. Grace Jones, people watching, ceding the spotlight and staring from the sidelines? Now that's a shock. That Grace Jones would finally break radio silence with a disc this exciting is somewhat less so.","Fresh off of a winning appearance at the Massive Attack-curated Meltdown festival, the iconic singer who brought her distinctive presence to bear on disco and new wave returns with her first new album in almost 20 years.

I Am... Sasha Fierce,Beyoncé,by: Ryan Dombal,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Features Editor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929be18abf31b7dc71560c4/1:1/w_160/c482bc3b.jpg,2008-11-21 06:00:02,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12462-i-am-sasha-fierce/,Columbia,"Though she's only 27, Beyoncé goes out of her way to be an old-fashioned celebrity, the type offended by Pete Wentz blogging about Oscar the Grouch or Britney Spears Twittering her life away. ""I feel that, especially now with the Internet and paparazzi and camera phones, it's so difficult to maintain mystery,"" she said earlier this year. ""It's almost impossible to have superstars now, because people will never get enough."" And, in our TMZ-addled world, her reluctance to entertain most questions about her personal life is both refreshing and a bit stubborn. She's a megawatt anachronism in sky-high heels and a frozen smile. So, without much outside interference, Beyoncé's fan-artist connection relies almost wholly on her music-- the only place to find the ""real"" Beyoncé is on her albums. With that direct relationship in mind comes I Am... Sasha Fierce, a supposed window into the soul of Beyoncé as well as her hair-flipping sexpot alter ego who happens to be blessed with the ultimate ""Project Runway"" moniker. The ""split-personality"" gimmick is now a tired and, more often than not, hapless pop theme (see: Garth Brooks's proto-emo character Chris Gaines, T.I. vs. T.I.P, the street vs. boardroom dynamic of hubby Jay-Z's Kingdom Come). Sasha Fierce will not disturb that unfortunate trend. Unlike 2006's underrated funk-fest B'Day, which held together remarkably well as an LP and saw Beyoncé ditching sap for sass, this record isn't supposed to coalesce. Speaking once again to her penchant for the outdated and obsolete, it's a 2xCD affair also available in a deluxe edition with five additional tracks. (Didn't anyone tell her about Christina Aguilera's recent diva-fied double disc disappointment Back to Basics ... and that you're supposed to put the deluxe edition out six to eight months after the regular edition?) Sasha Fierce puts Beyoncé back into the ""singles artist"" column-- only the blindly devout would consider slogging through the deluxe edition multiple times; only the foolishly puritanical would deny the occasional high-gloss super hits. Nobody wins the Beyoncé vs. Sasha battle-- often, the listener loses. On the Beyoncé side, while tracks like the effective (and affecting) gender-bender ""If I Were a Boy"" and the stunning love-as-god power ballad ""Halo"" (courtesy of ""Bleeding Love"" scribe Ryan Tedder) find the singer both strident and exposed, there's lots of wispy nonsense seemingly dug out of Celine Dion's scrap pile. Her twist on ""Ave Maria"" is vocally impeccable, but it reads more like recital fodder rather than a true confessional. Flip to Sasha, which is more listenable overall, but also more pandering. There's the one that sounds like past Beyoncé hits (""Single Ladies [Put a Ring on It]""), the one that sounds like ""A Milli"" (""Diva""), and the one that sounds like Rihanna (""Sweet Dreams""). For someone famous for effortlessly sparking trends, there are a surprising amount of opportunistic retreads here. Beyoncé is a capital-S Star, and one glimpse of her onstage makes it clear why she's earned her right to operate above the fray. But an album isn't a concert, and there are simply not enough Sasha Fierce songs worthy of her or our time. (The hopelessly benign ""Smash Into You"" will provide a prime bathroom break moment on her next world tour, though.) While this LP is more painstaking than B'Day, the extra effort dulls any emotional wallop; B'Day, in all its hectic glory, offered a much more vivid peek into the elusive mind of Beyoncé than Sasha Fierce, which often reads more like projection than reality. Considering the wealth of characters this multi-talent is currently amassing between movies and alter egos, the notion of Beyoncé is more splintered now than ever. Sasha Fierce doesn't help her put the pieces back together.","Beyoncé follows other, uh, great ideas like Garth Brooks's proto-emo character Chris Gaines and T.I. vs. T.I.P with a split-personality 2xCD record.

This impasse is the ideal moment for band members to make low-key solo albums focusing on the core elements that make their bands great, just as Thom Yorke did with The Eraser. Hot Chip's Alexis Taylor does just that on Rubbed Out, a refreshingly simple collection of tender ballads and quirky set pieces. It often feels like catching Hot Chip songs half-formed-- it's easy to imagine how they'd shape up with syncopated percussion and filter sweeps, and many of them are so striking that you might wish for similarly stripped-down versions of ""Boy From School"" and ""Look After Me"". The sentiment veers between giddy infatuation and discreet heartbreak, but the mood stays quietly devotional throughout. Taylor's voice hovers over rich keyboard smears or bounces lightly over tripping guitars, accented with little bells and whistles. The hooks come hard and fast over Rubbed Out's delightful first two-thirds. ""Fireworks"", an engaging squelch-and-static instrumental, serves as a quick warm-up for ""Plastic Man"", a winsome organ hymn on which Taylor sings unabashedly about ""the heart that is inside of me."" A fluttering electric guitar version of Paul McCartney's ""Coming Up"" follows, and by the time you get to the hopscotch-pop of ""Baby"", you'll be charmed. Other front-end highlights include silky ballads ""I Thought This Was Ours"" and ""What Good Is Love?"", while ""I'm Not a Robber"", with its skittering drums and keyboard sheen, is the closest thing here to a Hot Chip song. This 15-track album starts to taper off around ""Musical Food"", one of a couple of pointless drone pieces that pad Rubbed Out's confused final third. I'm all for drone pieces in general, but Taylor's knack is for razor-sharp pop, not murky ambiance, and his talents feel especially wasted here. We also get brief sketches that might've been cool had they been finished (although one, ""I'm Juan"", features some unusually ugly synth sounds), and a closing work-out for booming drums. These pieces feel tacked-on, which their sequencing as the last six tracks supports. The parallels between Taylor's Rubbed Out and Yorke's The Eraser go beyond big-band auteurs making intimate solo albums. Consider their titular references to deletion-- of bandmates, of ornate arrangements, of instrumentation, and most importantly, of pressure. Taylor and Yorke seem to have had the same idea-- as their bands threatened to become moribund, they needed to get back to basics. For Radiohead, this re-centering was the pivot between Hail to the Thief and the revivified In Rainbows; hopefully the parallels will continue and Rubbed Out will have the same effect on Taylor's next album with Hot Chip.","Hot Chip's Alexis Taylor offes a low-key solo album á la Thom Yorke's The Eraser-- in this case, a refreshingly simple collection of tender ballads and quirky set pieces.

Stereo Image,Stereo Image,by: Jason Crock,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bdf3ea9e61561daa77f9/1:1/w_160/9332b059.jpg,2008-11-20 06:00:05,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12428-stereo-image/,Frog Man Jake,"While Stereo Image do list their designer and stylist as band members (Image... get it?), you'll quickly pick out the two principals here: half of this new venture is Johnny Dark, who was once half of Ontario's much-adored Junior Boys. He left after that group's first album and the jittery R&B-nodding two-step beats from the first record more or less went with him. (No insult to the opulent mope of So This Is Goodbye, not that it even needs mentioning.) Not surprisingly, the production on Stereo Image performs the similar feat of moving both the feet and the brain while things eminently tasteful and chic and making it all look easy. The vocals are another story. San Serac sings on every track here, and this probably isn't the best context for his voice, which is both technically limited and dramatic to the point of camp. Sometimes his presence is easy to overlook. Opener ""Pack Moves"" is an uptempo barrage of wet, bassy synths and tea-kettle percussion, and when Dark puts forth comparatively feet-first-head-later tracks, silly lyrics and sillier delivery can't do much to dampen the mood. When the album veers toward Grade-A mid-tempo swoon like ""Your Collapsed State"", the vocal approach begins to grate; things get worse on sparser minor-key material like ""Strange Life"", where Serac sings in an utter deadpan about promoters sipping white beers and names of mid-level sedans as if they were newly-unearthed Ian Curtis lyrics. It's only on tracks like the sleek ""Exposure"" or the obvious standout of ""Red Nights"" that Serac has a back-and-forth with the track rather than smothering it. During the latter's loopy middle-eight, he gets in an impassioned plea: ""No sad-sack DJ's ever gonna bring us down."" Now, Stereo Image made it to Junior Boys' recent Body Language mix, so there's probably nothing to read into there; but given its placement on the record, and the tone of this whole album against Junior Boys' trajectory without Dark, the comment can't help but sound a little pointed, if not defensive. The thing is, Dark is all over the place on Stereo Image, trying out different sounds. Only on ""Your Collapsed State"" does he dip back into the sparse and bated mystique of earlier Junior Boys material. The bright tones and relentless percussion elsewhere can sound like a woozy, paranoid recast of big beat, and ""Dark Chapter"" and ""Clamoring"" are icy to the point of near-gothic. An instrumental version of Stereo Image would be an event in itself, but Serac struts over every track like it's up to him alone. His speak-sing delivery on ""Red Nights"" fits ably with the wistful chirpiness of the track, like he and Dark are smiling in the face of some adversity. But it's about the only moment here where he shows more than one note.","Johnny Dark, the one-time member of Junior Boys, whose skittering and spacious beats helped to define that group's seminal Last Exit, launches a new project with vocalist San Serac.

Footnotes 92-94,Adorable,by: Jonathan Garrett,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bdffabf31b7dc7156090/1:1/w_160/2118ccdf.jpg,2008-11-20 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12439-footnotes-92-94/,Cherry Red,"With their debut, Against Perfection, released at the tail end of the shoegazer era and just before the height of Britpop hysteria, Adorable arguably straddled both genres-- yet were embraced by neither. Throughout the remainder of their short career, they'd have to settle for mere admiration while their more genre-conformist peers enjoyed wider recognition both critically and commercially. None of that was the band's fault: There's nothing willfully difficult about Adorable, the most overtly pop band to have been classified as shoegaze. Footnotes 92-94-- which culls 18 tracks from the band's early EPs and two full-lengths, the aforementioned Against Perfection and the sadly neglected follow-up, Fake-- represents the first attempt to give this band its much-belated due. Footnotes opens with early single ""Sunshine Smile"", which with its radiant guitar lead and whooshing chorus pegged them early as shoegazer disciples. While it's the track Adorable is remembered for, it also captures the band in its least-inspired and most embryonic form. Adorable made a significant leap from ""Sunshine Smile"" to Against Perfection, which notably did not include that early effort on the UK version of the album. On the Creation Records debut, Adorable retain some of shoegaze's aesthetic qualities, the saturated choruses and random bursts, but it's the elements that set them apart from their label peers that most impress in hindsight. Where vocals had been relegated to mere sonic accoutrement in shoegaze proper, Piotr Fijalkowski opted to take a front seat on Against Perfection, keeping his vocals well above the din. In contrast to the then-prevailing convention, which prized words for syllabic structure or how well they matched the music's dreamy somnolence, Fijalkowski seemed driven by a desire to convey raw emotion, no matter how clumsy the articulation. The approach reached its zenith on ""Glorious"", which here appears in slightly altered form, but still displays all of the brash egotism and crippling self-doubt (""there's a whole world outside that I didn't know about, I don't need it"") that made Fijalkowski stand out amongst the legions of breathy, vague impressionists. Predictably, Footnotes draws heavily from Against Perfection, featuring eight of the album's 10 tracks. (The two left out are ""I Know You Too Well"" and ""Still Life""-- both wisely jettisoned for this release.) An unfortunate side effect, however, is the exclusion of equally deserving songs from Fake-- particularly ""Road Movie"" and epic closer ""Have You Seen the Light"". The band's second album was in many ways as much a departure from Against Perfection as that album had been from ""Sunshine Smile"". Rather than continue further down the Britpop path (which they might easily have done with the groundwork laid on Against Perfection), Adorable instead chose to explore their growing fascination with American indie, adopting sludgier guitar tones and a more narrative lyrical approach for Fake. The shift perhaps explains why the album never found favor in England. Nevertheless, Fake was quite an achievement. The more propulsive songs, like opener ""Feed Me"" and the single ""Vendetta"", effectively underscored Fijalkowski's sneering, pointed delivery. Even more impressive were the slower numbers, such as on the incandescent ballad ""Submarine"". For once, Fijalkowski's vulnerability was matched by his band's more nuanced approach, one that emphasized the empty expanses, less over more. Rounding things out are a few odds and ends, lesser known B-sides that are neither embarrassing nor worthy of special mention. Cherry Red deserves credit for releasing this career-spanning retrospective, if for no other reason than for getting these songs in wide circulation. But truthfully, the label would have better served the band by simply reissuing the albums. Footnotes may work as a general introduction but falls short of a worthy epitaph.","Caught between shoegaze, Britpop, and, eventully, American indie, Adorable never got the recognition they deserved, something that this Cherry Red compilation aims to rectify.

Dømkirke,Sunn O))),by: Grayson Currin,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bdfaea9e61561daa780f/1:1/w_160/c6042ccb.jpg,2008-11-20 06:00:03,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12434-dmkirke/,Southern Lord,"For all their extended drones, Sunn O))) have been about change. Soon after recording the heralded Grimm Robe Demos a decade ago, amp-and-volume addicts Stephen O'Malley and Greg Anderson had the good sense to realize that slow, distended riffs-- no matter how quaking, visceral, and charged-- could quickly wear down a band. To that end, Sunn O))) have collaborated with dozens of avant-garde and metal heavyweights over six full-lengths and a bevy of EPs, live takes, and joint releases. From noise paragon Merzbow and ex-Melvins/Earth grinder Joe Preston to contemporary allies Boris and Xasthur necro Malefic, an impressive horde have left their mark on Sunn O)))'s colossal doom. Dømkirke-- a vinyl-only, 2xLP set recorded in March 2007 in a 12th century Norwegian cathedral-- showcases Sunn O)))'s malleability and versatility. Here, Anderson and O'Malley are assisted by four auxiliary members: Attila Csihar, the enigmatic vocalist of black metal band Mayhem; Steve Moore, the Southern Lord horns-and-keyboards specialist who now plays in Earth full time; longtime Sunn O))) collaborator Tos Nieuwenhuizen; and Lasse Marhaug, an Oslo electronicist whose work as Jazkamer spun glorious noise from metal threads on 2006's Metal Music Machine. The Borealis Festival-- an artistically adventurous affair spread throughout venues in Bergen, Norway's second city-- commissioned the piece to mirror ""the gothic Gregorian hymns of the Late Middle Ages... [which] reflected the despair, the terrors and darkness of the world."" Oh, the irony and possibilities... But what's so special about Dømkirke isn't that it was made by tattooed guys in dark robes playing doom metal in a beautiful church-- it's Sunn O)))'s crafty manipulation of spaces, aural and architectural, and the manner in which they relate to one another. The group uses its full sonic breadth here, saturating the space with a smart array of sounds. During ""Cannon"", the music even seems to mimic the cathedral's arches, as rich bass, horn, and organ support Marhaug's razor-thin electronic squeals. Before Dømkirke, Csihar had appeared on three Sunn O))) tracks-- two on last year's Oracle and ""Decay2 [Nihil's Maw]"", the tortured 25-minute conclusion to 2004's White2. Those tracks were good but one-dimensional, picking a sound and exhausting it. Here, the tracks seem to build, collapse, and sometimes rebuild through a wide range of tones and timbres, from the classic Sunn O))) guitar/bass upheaval to sonorous horn and organ calls. Csihar's criss-crossing moans, screams, and roars benefit from the more intricate sonic foundation, and his performance proves dynamic and, in its own way, narrative. Totaling 64 minutes, these four tracks showcase an almost litrugical arch: Opener ""Why Dost Thou Hide Thyself in Clouds?"" is a staid but powerful invocation, Moore building a viscous pipe organ drone that Csihar slowly slithers through. ""Cannon"" greets the rising action as Anderson and O'Malley join with low, long bass and guitar notes, and Moore slides trombone hums between the cracks. The upheaval of history or religion or really big amps in a stone-walled room finally comes to pass during ""Cymatics"", where noise, electronics, and Csihar's screams converge, with feedback flailing above a massive bass and barely-there organ. That organ is the only thing left at the close of ""Masks the Ætmospheres"", which feels like a summary of the performance's musical themes. Any review of Dømkirke would be remiss without commending Southern Lord's dedication to presenting its records as non-disposable pieces of art: Dømkirke, which isn't available digitally, comes pressed to sturdy charcoaled-and-veined vinyl. Each record slides into tough paper sleeves covered with gorgeous, theatric stills from the performance, and those sleeves slide into opposing wings of the thickest gatefold packaging I've ever held. A shadowy canvas painting by Burzum/Darkthrone artist Tanya Stene graces the front, representing the menacing sermon offered by the robed men on the back cover (O'Malley, Anderson and Csihar) from the darkened altar pictured in the haunting cathedral panorama stretched across the inside gatefold. There's a poster and a number, too. Released in a recorded music industry that's barely limping past its centennial, Dømkirke's material and musical hulk reflects the strength of anything that's survived 850 years of change.","Dømkirke-- a vinyl-only, 2xLP set recorded in March 2007 in a 12th century Norwegian cathedral-- showcases the metal band's impresice malleability and versatility.

First Frost,The Lucksmiths,by: Marc Hogan,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Senior Staff Writer</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929be02c0084474cd0c2e04/1:1/w_160/19437be7.jpg,2008-11-20 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12442-first-frost/,Matinee,"Indie pop, like other scenes outside rock's traditional canon, doesn't necessarily demand consistency. With a tradition of vinyl singles, small but beloved labels, and an intense sense of community, indie pop fans tend to place value on singles and EPs as much as albums. And with a decade and a half of reliably charming singles, EPs-- and, yes, albums-- the Lucksmiths are kind of like their genre's dependable go-to; they're the Hold Steady of indie pop. You know what to expect from the Australian band's ninth album, First Frost, and as with Craig Finn & co.'s latest, Stay Positive, you also a get a few new wrinkles. Stand-up drummer Tali White sings a little bit softer now; the guitars crunch more often. But the songs-- written mostly by guitarist Marty Donald, though also by White, bassist Mark Monnone, and newer guitarist Louis Richter-- are still genial sing-alongs that bounce from languid introspection to scrappy exuberance. Covering familiar subjects like the weather, drinking, geography, and quiet melancholy, they delight with catchy tunes and understated eloquence. First Frost doesn't match the peaks of 2005's Warmer Corners or last year's 45-track Spring a Leak compilation, but it comes close. Recorded in Tasmania with Chris Townend, the album continues a gradual sonic exploration: Horns and glam-rock swagger help Donald's ""A Sobering Thought (Just When One Was Needed)"" clear its head, while an unexpectedly grinding guitar solo lets White's acoustic ""Up With the Sun"" move beyond ""a time when every lunch was breakfast."" Monnone's ""South-East Coastal Rendezvous"" comes about as close to the wavy guitarscapes of Strawberry Wine-era My Bloody Valentine as the Lucksmiths probably ever will, evocatively concluding, ""Here's to who knows what"" (alas, not ""when""). Strings nicely adorn slower songs like Richter's opening ""The Town and the City"" and Donald's similarly themed ""Pines"". ""I don't mean to suggest I'm getting older/ But the city looks better over my shoulder,"" goes the latter. If it sounds like the Lucksmiths that wrote happy-go-lucky songs like ""Under the Rotunda"" and ""T-Shirt Weather"" have grown up...well, they have, but their craft has matured, too. They still ""drink and laugh and eat,"" as on Monnone's folkier, slightly drab ""Day Three of Five"". Only now they're left to ask themselves, ""Why did you get drunk"" in Donald's mournful, country-tinged duet with female vocalist Bee Rigby, ""Lament of the Chiming Wedgebill"". No, wait, it's the chiming wedgebill who's asking. Most admirably, First Frost finds the Lucksmiths continuing to put out quietly ambitious records that could be enjoyed by almost anybody who loves music-- not just indie pop partisans. ""California in Popular Song"" is the best song on the album, but it's not a difficult critic's favorite; either you'll love the trebly guitar interplay, White's tender phrasing, Donald's vivid storytelling about someone leaving for an imagined California, and delicate turns of phrase like ""your eyes are wet with wine,"" or you'll listen to something else. Yes, I realize the poetically arranged SAT-word sing-along that ends Donald's gorgeous ""The National Mitten Registry"" is waaay too precious for the Hot 100. But as White sings: ""Fingers crossed/ All is not lost."" The Lucksmiths still drink; they haven't dried up, and it doesn't sound like they're going to crumble into dust anytime soon.","Dependable as ever, the Lucksmiths continue to put out quietly ambitious records that could be enjoyed by almost anybody who loves music-- not just indie pop partisans.

Dedication 3,Lil Wayne,by: Tom Breihan,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929be05abf31b7dc71560a2/1:1/w_160/b01e1c34.jpg,2008-11-20 06:00:01,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12444-dedication-3/,self-released,"Lil Wayne's been calling himself the best rapper alive since way before anyone took the claim seriously. On Dedication 2, the second in the series of reputation-cementing mixtapes Wayne made with DJ Drama, he explained: ""I am better than everybody. I'm a competitor. I hope everybody else feel the same way about their craft. If you do, it makes it better for the people."" So that was it: In an era of hustlers-not-rappers, Wayne was one of the few who took his occupation seriously, who put in 16-hour days coming up with the sort of word-drunk, out-there punchlines that made the world take him seriously. In a few years' time, Wayne went from a goofy Southern kiddie-rapper to a force of nature. Fast forward to this year: Tha Carter III is the biggest-selling album of 2008 and also one of the most acclaimed-- in part because Wayne put so much work in. Note the past tense: Wayne no longer has anything to prove, and Dedication 3, his new Drama mixtape, sounds like it. Wayne is very good at a few things: rapping, picking beats, making goofy facial expressions in videos. He's not especially good at playing guitar or singing or selecting rappers for his record label. But those other things seem to be monopolizing his attention these days. There's no guitar on Dedication 3, thank God, but we get a whole lot more of Wayne's off-key Auto-Tuned warbling than we get of his actual rapping, and he mostly leaves the rhyming to his Young Money Entertainment signees, which anyone who's heard Mack Maine's shockingly clumsy guest-verse on the ""Got Money"" video knows is a bad thing. When Wayne does get around to rapping, he usually sounds like he's fried his brain on so much cough syrup that he can barely bring himself to stick to the beat or come up with more than one good line. This is a circa-2008 DJ Drama mixtape, which means the beats, both new and vintage, will be top-notch and well-sequenced, but it also means Drama's own weed-carriers Willie the Kid and L.A. the Darkman will be along for the ride. The title track sets the tone: Over Drama associate Don Cannon's pretty-great beat for Outkast's ""Da Art of Storytelling, Part 4"", Wayne gargles out an unmemorable chorus while Willie, Mack Maine, and Gudda Gudda spit boringness; Wayne jumps on at the end for a quick afterthought of a verse. This is the first track, and it goes on for nearly seven minutes. Things don't get a lot better from there. Every big-name rapper these days has a crew of associates, but only a few-- T.I. and Kanye-- have ones worth hearing. But, hey, these guys need to rap somewhere, so it might as well be on a free online mixtape. Still this is a Dedication mixtape, and listening to all three of them in order tells a sad story. The last two featured Wayne, hungry and fearsome, ready to take over the world through whacked-out genius and force of will. This time, he's barely paying attention. Example: ""Get Bizzy"". The track snatches the simple, spacey, orchestra-hit-heavy beat to V.I.C.'s ""Get Silly"", exactly the sort of low-budget novelty-hit that the Wayne of two years ago would've just annihilated, the way he did to Dem Franchize Boyz' ""I Think They Like Me"" on Dedication 2 or DJ Unk's ""Walk It Out"" on Da Drought 3. This time he drools all over the track in a half-conscious Auto-Tuned slur, loses the beat a couple of times, comes up with exactly one slick line (""Red scarf on my neck/ Red diamonds looking like red barf on my neck, uhh""), then turns the whole thing over to the unbelievably shitty Plies sound-alike Gudda Gudda. Epic fail. More bad decisions: Tyga, the squeaky-voiced younger cousin of Gym Class Hero Travis McCoy, gets pole position on Drumma Boy's gothically churning beat for Young Jeezy's ""Put On"" and he absolutely sucks. Nondescript protégé Nikki Minaj, meanwhile, gets to defile the beat to T.I.'s ""No Matter What"" so she can complain (in Auto-Tune, guh) about the haters she's not famous enough to have. And for the first time, a Wayne signee-- Jae Millz, journeyman veteran of the New York mixtape and battle circuits-- upstages his boss. Millz isn't a great rapper, but he's got a no-bullshit monotone flow and a way with punchlines: ""Y'all nothing like me, fuck boy, don't be outlandish/ We gorillas in the mist, y'all just some kung fu pandas."" Here and there, we get brief flashes of the truly nasty Wayne, but we have to wade through so much bullshit to find these gems that it's barely worth the effort. One of Wayne's most entertaining moments comes on a non-rapping skit where he's just talking about Sarah Palin-- and he even loses focus near the end of that. We've been here before. The first time Wayne started fucking around with Auto-Tune was on another near-unlistenable mixtape released near the end of last year, Empire's unlicensed Da Drought Is Over, Part 4. When I heard that, I wrote that Wayne might need to slow down, that his appetites and his volume of output were finally starting to bring down the quality of his work. Wayne pulled it together for Tha Carter III, and a handful of post-album guest-appearances (Drake's ""Ransom"", Keri Hilson's ""Turnin' Me On"") show that he's still a monster when he wants to be. But when he stops wanting it, we get bullshit like Dedication 3.","After his tremendous 2008, Lil Wayne deserves a victory lap; unfortunately for us it's full of Auto-Tuned warbling and mediocre Young Money Entertainment signees.

"Scratch Came, Scratch Saw, Scratch Conquered",Lee “Scratch” Perry,by: Nate Patrin,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bdf913d197565213b676/1:1/w_160/cabc42c9.jpg,2008-11-19 06:00:05,Global,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12433-scratch-came-scratch-saw-scratch-conquered/,Megawave,"Dealing with eccentric geniuses in pop music is always a tricky thing: you can love the work of Sun Ra or Kool Keith or Jandek on purely musical terms, but there's also an undercurrent of lunacy tourism to some peoples' appreciation of them. For those folks, the appeal of the musician's bizarre personality and alleged craziness overwhelms the legit brilliance, turning it from a sideshow into the main attraction. Lee ""Scratch"" Perry has hovered on the periphery of that divide since the end of the 1970s: as much deserved recognition as he gets for his production innovations, there's also the ""he burned down his studio, man"" aspect of his legend, the stories and rumors that tend to depict him as a cannabis-fueled goof-off and, with age, a sort of crazy-grampa oddball persona as well. Scratch Came, Scratch Saw, Scratch Conquered-- the second album Perry has released in the span of two months, coming shortly after the Andrew W.K.-produced oddity Repentance-- should suit fans of Scratch-as-weirdo just fine. His role on this album is in a purely vocal capacity, and even if his voice is mostly preoccupied with croaking out stream-of-consciousness mutterings and aimless non-sequitirs, he still shoots off a few good lines: Opener ""Having a Party"" invokes ""A skeleton from outer space/ With his Remington in his suitcase,"" and when he gets abstractly spiritual on tracks like ""The Game Black"" and ""Saint Selassie"", he seems to harbor a compellingly odd sort of mysticism. And there's still a mischievous spark in his ragged, aging voice, gentle and reserved as it frequently is. Thing is, he still spends most of the time on Scratch Conquered blue-skying from phrase to phrase in odd moments of free-association-- which isn't bad in and of itself, except when he loses the plot and kind of half-asses it, which is often. Sometimes this aimless randomness is funny, when he concludes ""Yee Ha Ha Ha"" with shout-outs to New York City, California, Chicago, Wisconsin (!) and ""Texas Town""-- which he then appends with a softly-mumbled ""George Bush"", to the accompaniment of cowboy-movie gunshots. Too bad he repeats that same travelogue almost verbatim (sans W. shoutout) in ""Once There's a Will There's a Way"". He also tends to ruminate on the same brief snatches of phraseology about banks, money, politicians, and assorted ""sinful fuckers,"" invoking them over and over without making much of it really cohere past the three-word soundbite level. And if you consider that just Scratch being Scratch-- well, he's being Scratch over some pretty ordinary reggae. Producer John Saxon is stingy with the dub signifiers, and with the exception of the knife-sharpening, melting-synthesizer rhythm on ""Jealousy"" and the otherworldly skank to ""Scratch Is Alive"", there's little sign of the percussive experimentation, thick slabs of bass, or echo-chamber deepness one would hope for from a Lee ""Scratch"" Perry record. It's not really bad, per se, as far as roots-revival reggae goes; it's at least tightly arranged and boasts a good horn section, which would make it a fine record for someone like Jimmy Cliff to sing over. And despite a couple of gratuitous famous-peer-driven genre experiments thrown in-- George Clinton joining in for the spaceman-summit funk jam ""Headz Gonna Roll"", Keith Richards adding some late-period Stones guitar entropy to ""Heavy Voodoo"" and ""Once There's a Will There's a Way""-- none of these collaborations really feel as momentous as they should. Without the important musical half of Perry's bizarre genius, the one that proved there was plenty of creativity behind his peculiarity, Scratch Conquered is a hollow experience where most of the enjoyment depends on how much you like the idea of one of popular music's strongest visionaries reduced to a novelty act just dicking around.","The second album from Lee ""Scratch"" Perry in just a few months, Scratch Came, Scratch Saw, Scratch Conquered finds the reggae legend contributing typically loopy off-the-dome vocals to productions by John Saxon. Guests include George Clinton and Keith Richards.

Cream Cuts,Tussle,by: Adam Moerder,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bdf6eb335119a49ecfbc/1:1/w_160/f916cd65.jpg,2008-11-19 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12431-cream-cuts/,Smalltown Supersound,"Back when indie rock and dance music seemed an unholy matrimony, skeptics could be comforted by No Wave comps and the concurrent uptick in krautrock awareness. Every divisive Out Hud or Radio 4 release felt kosher if uploaded onto the same iPod playlist with at least one obscure cut from, say, Liquid Liquid or DNA. Even when enough mind-blowing dance-punk releases finally elevated the genre above fad status, these stubborn, joyless touchstones occupied a big part of listeners' consciences. San Francisco instrumental quartet Tussle are apparently among the few who haven't received the memo that there's big bucks in semi-artistically fusing dance and rock music together. They cling to their influences on a purely cerebral level, making no effort to coddle listeners not already immersed in the genre. Tussle's first two LPs cast the group more as connoisseurs than revivalists, but Cream Cuts, as its name tantalizingly suggests, seeks to derive at least some degree of pleasure from the band's otherwise sterile precision. Tracks like the bubbly ""Night of the Hunter"" tap into the NES-informed instrumental rock of the Octopus Project or Hella's Chirpin' Hard, and are aided by the playfulness of percussionist Jonathan Holland, who's willing to clang together anything he finds in the junkyard. Hot Chip's Alexis Taylor even makes a cameo, spreading his pop wealth over ""Titan"", by far the brightest and loosest song here. This healthy dose of accessibility also spills over into the spacebound portions of the album. ""Transparent C"" pays homage to expansive trailblazers Cluster and Kraftwerk, while the group's dub and Manchester leanings resurface on the song's Happy Mondays-style outro. ""Rainbow Claw"", the crème de la Cream Cuts, reaches the most effective compromise between Tussle's right and left brain. Updating the intergalactic siren from ESG's ""UFO"", ""Claw"" batters its austere bassline with legions of synths, causing the Martian groove to occasionally fly off-course into a wonderful B-section freakout that's at once carefree and meticulous. Of course, this newfound immediacy is all relative. Throughout the album, Tussle continually ride up to the line of release, but then pull back, like when they short circuit ""Meh-Teh""'s potentially huge pay-off with a wonky noise collage tangent. Even more confounding, they plop aimless interludes like ""Third Party"" and ""Personal Effects"" between album highlights, which begs the question of how big a scope Tussle's aiming for. The band's superhuman patience and dirty minimalism seem fit for longer, more sprawling works. Instead, they're stuck in limbo between catchiness and craftsmanship.","Tussle's third album finds the San Francisco dub/dance combo finally becoming more comfortable in their own skin, but still too restrained and cerebral to achieve maximum release.

Arrowhead,Prurient,by: Grayson Currin,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bdf213d197565213b669/1:1/w_160/876a71e8.jpg,2008-11-19 06:00:03,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12427-arrowhead/,Editions Mego,"One of a half-dozen full-lengths to be released by New York noise artist Prurient this year, Arrowhead can be considered in either of two contexts depending upon your familiarity with the one-man-band's sizable discography or with noise music at large. If you're interested in Prurient, Arrowhead is a revealing transitional retrospective, intense but with precedent. If you're not, it's a shocking, singular piece of hair-raising noise. Either way, it's yet another essential piece in Prurient's metastasized catalog and one of the year's most obliterative and exhilarating releases. Originally recorded in 2004, Arrowhead consists of three squelch-and-sustain tracks built by high-pitched microphone feedback, challenged only by spasms of drumming and the mutilated screams of Prurient mastermind Dominick Fernow. He infamously employed a similar approach-- a thin, powerful shriek of feedback that slowly warps and expands until it blooms into a boundless abyss-- on ""Roman Shower"", the brazen first track from his 2005 Load Records debut, Black Vase. Though exceptions abound, much of Fernow's recent output has been more ""song""-oriented, meaning only that the settings have generally been shorter and less of a standstill (see the excellent Pleasure Ground or the second side of Adam Tied to a Stone). In that historical setting, Arrowhead-- recorded the same year and in the same city as ""Roman Shower""-- links many of the facets of Prurient's sound. In the first two tracks, Fernow gradually intensifies sinister, relentless rays until, like ""Roman Shower"", they become pained, bloody wastelands. The third and shortest track lunges forward, slowly becoming caked in static and sliced by feedback similar to that heard during the first 27 minutes. All the sounds smear, wiping across the speakers like a grimy, gory mess. Imagine Daniel Menche pushing the Fuck Buttons on speed, for four minutes, and you get the point. Together, these tracks-- ""Sternum"", ""Ribcage"", and ""Lungs""-- show us where Prurient had been in 2004 and where he was delightfully going. If this release serves as an introduction to Prurient, it'll be a trial by fire, but one well worth the burns. Sure, you'll find noise ""bigger"" than this, but you'll find little that's so dramatic and masterful. Listen for the control Fernow wields over his electronics as he grapples with the tone, letting it slide into chaos only to bring it back under his hand. There's a violent, lacerating ebb-and-flow to this work that's as nauseating as it is enrapturing. Both in his Manhattan record store, Hospital Productions, and through his record label of the same name, Fernow peddles the most extreme black metal, a genre that-- at its best-- delivers an idea without apology and with exhaustion. Prurient sounds little like black metal here (with its drowned vocals and saturated, tidal murk, Cocaine Death-- another excellent 2008 release from Fernow-- does; and he's in a black metal band, Ash Pool), but Arrowhead functions in much the same way: Its stylized, specific, and unflinching sound roars with a singular menace, at once terrifying and captivating. These performances sound like the sorts of pieces that happen when every ounce of trouble the performer has gets sweated, bled, and screamed into the cutting room floor. Re-reading that sentence, I'm afraid I've made Prurient's searing power-electronics sound, well, emo. And I suppose, in the end, it is. But for 31 minutes, Arrowhead should keep you too fixated (or, as it were, repulsed) to care.","The latest of many 2008 releases by Hospital Productions mastermind Dominick Fernow tilts away from his (loosely speaking) ""song""-based work and back to the realm of harsh and undeniably powerful noise.

Budokan!,Cheap Trick,by: Stuart Berman,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929be0113d197565213b689/1:1/w_160/58ab5221.jpg,2008-11-19 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12441-budokan/,EpicEpic,"If punk taught us that anyone can do it, then Cheap Trick showed that anyone could make it. Their 1979 commercial breakthrough, At Budokan, is not just one of rock's greatest live albums, but also one of its most triumphant underdog tales, an exemplar of pre-internet viral phenomena: Originally planned as a cheaply produced, limited-edition Japanese-only release, the record eventually-- through steady import sales, airplay from discerning stateside DJs, and increasing request-line activity-- transformed these bar-circuit workhorses into multi-platinum superstars. They really don't make 'em like this anymore. Of all the 1970s arena-rock acts, Cheap Trick were arguably most in tune with punk's premium on three-chord simplicity, raw-powered riffage, subversive lyrics, and plainclothes appearance. Sure, vocalist Robin Zander and bassist Tom Petersson were pretty boys, but unassumingly so; the real center of attention was Rick Nielsen, whose geek-chic attire and hammy onstage antics made him a class clown in an era of golden-god guitar heroes. Meanwhile, Bun E. Carlos looked less like a rock'n'roll drummer than a veteran cop pulling desk duty. Though Cheap Trick's most visible recent moves-- re-recording Big Star's ""In the Street"" for ""That '70s Show"", performing the Beatles' Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band in its entirety at a 2007 Hollywood Bowl concert-- may paint them as a nostalgia act, they continue to produce quality albums (see: 2006's steady-as-she-goes Rockford), and their influence on contemporary indie/alt-rock is as pronounced as ever: For the Foo Fighters, Weezer, Smashing Pumpkins, Ted Leo, the Raconteurs-- basically any band that's ever tried to weld a Beatlesque melody to a power chord-- all roads lead back to Budokan. However, this 3xCD/DVD, 30th-anniversary box set makes for an overlong and somewhat unnecessary return trip. For casual/curious fans who just want their ""Surrender"" and ""I Want You to Want Me"", the original, compact 10-track version of At Budokan (reissued on 180-gram vinyl last month) remains the most convenient access point. For those who want the band's pop hits counterbalanced by more aggressive album cuts like ""ELO Kiddies"" and ""Auf Wiedersehen"", there's At Budokan: The Complete Concert, a 1998 2xCD remastered reissue that compiles the best performances from the Trick's two Budokan performances on April 28 and 30, 1978. And now we have Budokan!-- a repackaging of the reissue that contains the Complete Concert set, a third disc featuring an unedited performance of the complete April 28 show, plus a DVD document. Budokan! earns its newly acquired exclamation point with the DVD portion-- the second of the band's two Budokan performances was filmed for Japanese television and allegedly broadcast just once, making this footage a prized acquisition for long-time fans. Though contextual/crowd shots are non-existent-- thereby denying us the opportunity to experience the full magnitude of the band's Beatlemania-like reception-- it's still a treat to see those iconic album photos come to life, and witness a band being promoted to arena-rock big leagues right before your eyes, with no bullshit or pretense. (The closest thing to a pyro effect here is the stream of smoke emanating from Carlos' cigarettes.) Curiously, the video of ""Come On, Come On"" is excised from the main set and relegated to a bonus feature, perhaps because the footage was originally overlaid with an interview segment; it's appended by two clips from Cheap Trick's April 2008 return to Budokan (the Dream Police-era power ballad ""Voices"", and One on One's ""If You Want My Love"") that show them more aged and less limber, but with their harmonic fortitude intact. A retrospective interview featuring the band and its Japanese handlers provides additional backstory-- sobering reminiscences of fan-induced rioting and hotel-room segregation that contrast with the celebratory spirit of the recordings. As a stand-alone item, the DVD would make for a great stocking stuffer, and a practical way to commemorate an anniversary that was already well-commemorated 10 years ago. But to package it exclusively in a $50 box-set-- one that will ward off younger Cheap Trick newcomers while essentially saddling the die-hards with another copy of The Complete Concert-- seems a bit churlish. For non-audiophiles, the unedited April 28, 1978 audio disc provides only the most minor points of contrast-- a flubbed guitar-solo break during ""Come On, Come On"", a version of ""Surrender"" minus the familiar synth over-dubs. Otherwise, the set list (even the stage banter) is identical to The Complete Concert, which, as per its design, already features the band's best Budokan performances. Perhaps the lure of a handsomely bound liner-note 40-page booklet (complete with an uncharacteristically humble shout-out from Gene Simmons) and souvenir poster will allow some fans to forgive this box set's redundancies — though judging by the complaints currently spreading online about the set's disc-scratching, slip-case packaging, they may have other issues. In any event, for a band whose greatest attribute was their economy, Budokan! feels excessive-- a repackaging trick that's not so cheap.","Any band that's ever tried to weld a Beatlesque melody to a power chord owes a debt to Cheap Trick's classic live album, which now is blown up into a 3xCD/DVD, 30th-anniversary box set.

The BBC Sessions,Belle and Sebastian,by: Scott Plagenhoef,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929be03abf31b7dc715609e/1:1/w_160/21aa6455.jpg,2008-11-19 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12443-the-bbc-sessions/,Matador,"Among the great ironies in Belle & Sebastian's 13-year career is that this group, once known for stumbling through its live performances, has become a tight theater band. From the start, they resisted putting on common shows, eschewing pubs or clubs for libraries and churches-- venues that made their performances atypical and unbound to live clichés. Because they performed infrequently in wildly different settings, however, it took time for B&S to hone their live show. The tentative steps charmed some: Writer/musician Franklin Bruno, in an enthusiastic email that was eventually excerpted in the zine Puncture, praised B&S in part for not ""overpreparing"" for their first U.S. show. In a review of the same gig, The New York Times admitted to loving the songs but called the band ""lazy, unambitious bumblers full of private jokes they're too sleepy to share."" Despite the slapdash nature of some early shows, the group sounded polished on its early radio sessions. It's fitting: Band leader Stuart Murdoch has decried the need to over-amplify music at rock shows, and Belle & Sebastian's earlier, baroque lines are better suited to the intimacy of bedroom listening. As a kid weaned in part on John Peel's UK radio show, Murdoch seemed to understand that portion of his audience as well, dedicating one song on an early radio performance to a smalltown girl ""because life isn't easy for a 16-year-old in the middle of nowhere."" It took a while, but Belle & Sebastian eventually performed on Peel's show three times: They cut previously unreleased songs at a session in 2001, added a five-song set at Peel Acres in 2002, and played a set heavy on holiday music later that same year. The first of these is included on The BBC Sessions in its entirety, alongside 10 of the 13 tracks the group performed for Mark Radcliffe and Steve Lamacq in 1996 and 1997. (A limited-edition version of the album adds a 12-track live disc recorded in Belfast in 2001, capturing the group in its transitional middle period. Bolstered by additional string players and finding their feet as entertainers, they even frequently performed covers, with ""The Boys Are Back in Town"", ""I'm Waiting for the Man"", and ""Here Comes the Sun"" making appearances on this disc.) The first half of Sessions features faithful renditions of early songs like ""The State I Am In"", ""The Stars of Track and Field"", and ""Judy and the Dream of Horses"". Since the group recorded their first two albums, Tigermilk and If You're Feeling Sinister, in a total of 10 days, it's no surprise that they could replicate the studio tracks but do little more. Even 1997 recordings of ""Slow Graffiti"" and ""Sleep the Clock Around""-- each performed more than a year prior to their studio release-- appear largely as listeners now know and love them. Without guest vocalist Monica Queen, the band is forced to make adjustments to ""Lazy Line Painter Jane"". Guitarist Stevie Jackson replaces her vocals and the arrangement is dialed back, with the song sashaying rather than soaring until an aggressive coda that single-handedly saves it. Jackson also offers two originals-- the drab ""Seymour Stein"" and an early version of countrypolitan charmer ""The Wrong Girl"" (here as ""Wrong Love""). This is an incomplete look at these sessions, leaving out a trio of songs recorded in December 1996 which included ""Seeing Other People"", a lovely version of ""This Is Just a Modern Rock Song"", and ""We Rule the School"". The disc also cuts off ""I Could Be Dreaming"" before it gets to its rousing coda. The missing ""Seeing Other People"" is the ""slow version"" the group often played at its earliest shows-- including that divisive one in New York-- which featured Murdoch, Jackson, and Isobel Campbell trading verses. Campbell's vocals sound breathless on the radio show, as she displays little vocal control, gasping for air between words and syllables. Despite that, it's still a worthy artifact. More sadly missed is an exquisite reading of ""We Rule the School"", which swaps around some of the lyrics and has a tangible ache to it, even greater than the studio version's. ""I Could Be Dreaming"" drops out Murdoch's closing ad-lib, wherein he laments tongue-in-cheek that the group signed a record deal rather than continuing to orchestrate their career on their own. Like ""Seeing Other People"", it's perhaps awkward for the group to hear these early gestures, but they're sweet and missed here nonetheless. The final four tracks are also the last songs the group recorded with Campbell, and her vocal ability had grown incredibly over the time. With an already spectral quality to her now-matured voice, her presence would seem almost ghostly were the first of the four-- a tribute to the wonderful Go-Bewteens-- not already haunted by the subsequent death of that group's co-songwriter Grant McLennan. One of the closest things in the B&S catalog to a Stuart Murdoch solo song, Go-Bees tribute ""Shoot the Sexual Athlete"" finds him speaking in first person without talking through a character, something he does only when making meta comments on the nature of the group or stardom. On both ""The Magic of a Kind Word"" and ""Nothing in the Silence"", Campbell shares vocals with her bandmates but looms large. The former points the way to the happy-clappy sound of Dear Catastrophe Waitress, while the dreamy, drony latter hints at some of the many directions Campbell would take her music once she left Belle & Sebastian. Best of all is ""(My Girl's Got) Miraculous Technique""-- which most harks back to the songs B&S recorded in 1996-97. ""If I could be a song/ I would be something that would snake into your room/ And be with you the whole night long,"" Murdoch and co. sing here, making it a fitting finale for both a radio session and a disc full of them. It's also a fitting epitaph for the group in 2001, just before it was prepared to jump fully into the Technicolor, Trevor Horn-led world of Waitress and ditch the coziness and privacy of spinning gorgeous melodies for loners, dreamers, and students. That makes it all the more a shame this collection couldn't find room for ""We Rule the School""-- the song dedicated to that 16-year-old girl-- and a few other moments beloved by fans. Childhood and adolescence aren't always pretty-- there are missteps, embarrassing photos, inept sexual fumblings, and poor choices. It's a slight disappointment that a group so in tune to the awkwardness of youth would paper over some of those moments and leave this set incomplete.","Selecting from radio performances recorded between 1996 and 2001, including a set for the legendary John Peel, The BBC Sessions offers an appealing alternate portrait of Belle and Sebastian in their more ramshackle early days.

Play,Magazine,by: Joshua Klein,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bdf4abf31b7dc7156076/1:1/w_160/e104f200.jpeg,2008-11-18 06:00:05,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12429-play/,EMIEMI,"We all know the drill: a successful songwriting partnership breaks up, and the defector goes on to form a band that either sounds exactly the same as his former band-- or one that sounds exactly the same, but much, much worse. In the annals of pop music history, Magazine were something of an exception, seeing how they matched the Buzzcocks in many ways while still spiraling off on several new tangents. If the Buzzcocks were a melodically inclined punk band that helped transition punk to new wave, Magazine were a new wave band that retained the fury and edginess of punk. The difference may have ultimately boiled down to the use of synthesizers, but still, Magazine posed much darker stuff than the Buzzcocks, and differently, too. As spin-offs go, Magazine were no mere copycats. They were something else entirely. Howard Devoto was only in the Buzzcocks for a few months before ceding control to Pete Shelley. And, burning hot and bright, Magazine itself lasted only a few years. What they released, though, comprises one of the most distinctive catalogs in new wave, ranging from ""Shot by Both Sides"", the defining outburst of alienation, to more refined takes on the same subject like ""A Song From Under the Floorboards"", the last of Magazine's songs to feature founding guitarist John McGeoch before he jumped ship to Siouxsie and the Banshees. That line-up switch is pivotal to Magazine's Play, a 1980 live album recorded in Australia and featuring McGeoch's freshly tapped (and short-lived) replacement Robin Simon. Most bands wouldn't have dared press ""record"" with the new guy barely installed, but clearly Magazine knew what they were doing. While hardly epic, the disc bristles with intensity and arty, angular grit. In fact, for a while, Play might have been the best introduction to the band, as it showcases several of the group's best attributes-- Devoto's acidic singing, the disorienting keyboards, and future Bad Seed Barry Adamson's pulsing bass. That's not really the case anymore, since the band's four studio albums are widely available in remastered editions and Magazine's discography has been distilled down to the pretty solid best-of Where the Power Is. For more enthusiastic listeners, there's also the 3xCD companion Maybe It's Right to Be Nervous Now, which featured several of the group's most familiar songs, either live or in alternate form. And finally, there's the small matter that Play lacks the trademark ""Shot by Both Sides"". Yet it's still substantial. Magazine were plenty muscular and, for a new wave act, not afraid to drop the sheen in favor of something less polished. Not that the likes of ""Definitive Gaze"" or ""The Light Pours Out of Me"" were ever particularly polished, but Play does show off the more feral side of the band, even when toning down the guitars on ""A Song From Under the Floorboards"" or deconstructing Sly Stone's ""Thank You (Falettinme Be Mice Elf Agin)"". It's for fans only at this point, but arriving just in time for next year's reunion, Play is a welcome reminder of the band's prowess.","This 1980 Australian live album captures the legendary (and now reunited) post-punk band Magazine in peak form, just a year before they disbanded.

Yancey Boys,Illa J,by: Tom Breihan,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bdfec0084474cd0c2dfc/1:1/w_160/be3c9db1.jpg,2008-11-18 06:00:04,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12438-yancey-boys/,Delicious Vinyl,"Illa J is the younger brother of the late stoner-rap deity J Dilla. That in itself speaks to some fundamental lameness, like if Jay-Z had a rapping younger brother who called himself Zee-J. More to the point, his familial connection to a great dead producer appears to be Illa's chief qualification to release an album. On the interlude ""Alien Family"", Dilla associate Frank Nitty tries to make a case for this particular feat of nepotism, testifying as to the musical abilities of the entire Yancey clan: ""It's like they the Jackson 5 from Mars."" If you say so, Frank Nitty. And yet Yancey Boys does work pretty well because of that familial connection: Illa exclusively works with previosuly unheard mid-1990s Dilla beats, and a new album full of old Dilla beats is never a bad thing. Dilla apparently left behind a Tupac-level archive of unused material when he died in 2006, and Yancey Boys is pretty much 48 minutes' worth of the producer's trademark glimmering murk. It's a good little, unhurried, rainy-afternoon rap album. Dilla had a definite formula-- amniotic soups of echoed-out Fender Rhodes, sharp snares, gurgley bass, precisely sloppy record-scratches-- yet surprises do pop up every once in a while on Yancey Boys. ""We Here"" swipes the drums from Kraftwerk's ""Trans-Europe Express"". ""All Good"" employs someone running a stick up and down one of those wooden crocodile sculptures. Mostly, though, these old beats just thump away in a comforting sort of fog. As for Illa, he's got a rapping voice way more soft and delicate than the vaguely clumsy tough-guy yammer Dilla himself usually used. At times, Illa recalls a seriously stoned and vaguely bored Q-Tip. His lyrics are heavy on digression. On ""Strugglin'"", apropos of nothing: ""My favorite White Stripes album is Elephant/ OK, I know that's irrelevant/ But that's my shit."" ""IllaSoul"" is a weird sort of a come-on song, Illa getting stoned and staring at the ocean while at the same time hitting on some girl. Actual lyric: ""I'm so glad that we got we/ And also, I'm so glad that we got weed."" But Illa spends at least as much time singing in a relaxed soul-singer falsetto coo as he does rapping-- and he rarely diverts attention from the beats, which makes him a more appropriate vessel for them than a prominent Dilla collaborator like Common or Busta Rhymes would've been. Illa recalls fellow indie-rap psych-traveller Aloe Blacc in the way he mixes Sam Cooke harmonies with utilitarian rapper. But unlike Aloe, Illa rarely gives the impression that he's doing anything more than fucking around in the studio. This, after all, the sort of album where someone says, ""I grab your derriere and vibrateth my fingertips"" in a vampire accent over ""Für Elise"". At the end of ""Sounds Like Love"", Illa ad-libs, almost to himself, ""It's just the music. It speaks for himself."" He's right. And thanks to his brother's beyond-the-grave contributions, he himself is the most disposable part of his own debut album. Luckily for him, it probably won't be too hard to find another hour's worth of unused Dilla tracks when it comes time to record the follow-up.","J Dilla's younger brother trawls through the late producer's wealth of unused beats and uses them as the foundation for his debut album.

Sound Sculptures Volume 1,Theo Parrish,by: Andy Battaglia,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bdf0ea9e61561daa77f3/1:1/w_160/5f693c99.jpeg,2008-11-18 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12425-sound-sculptures-volume-1/,Sound Signature,"Theo Parrish is a master crafter of a decidedly elusive brand of dance music, which is rare. Most sounds that identify as ""dance music"" take bold measures to make their intentions known, but Parrish's sound-- an odd, insinuating kind of house music-- counts as more suggestive and sly, with subtle textural rubs and beats that register as ellipses more than exclamation points. Parrish's is a message that arrives by way of coded whispers and hums. One of the byproducts of Parrish's elusiveness is that you have to work a little to hear him. This makes for a special kind of disconnect where newcomers might be left to wonder what Parrish partisans (and there are many) find to fetishize in tracks that play like little more than sketchy drafts or protracted sashays. The keys to the enterprise are patience and an abiding sense of a project at work-- a cunning, cumulative project that rewards immersion more than immediacy. All of which makes Sound Sculptures Volume 1 an ideal way to hear Parrish in his many moods. The 2xCD set follows a 3x12"" vinyl release with the same name from last year, but the tracklist has tripled-- which, with Parrish, almost has to mean the tally of ideas did, too. His cleverness is not always readily apparent. The opening ""All Yours/Who Told Adam?"" does nothing more than take a section of flanged synthesizer and a defiantly crude beat and then reiterate it over and over. The result, however, sounds somehow both heavy-handed and magisterially finessed. ""Black Music (I Love You)"" follows with a dizzy disco spell supporting a spoken-word tribute to Parrish's implied lineage (Sun Ra, John Coltrane, Muddy Waters, Howlin' Wolf, Gil Scott-Heron, etc.) The result this time, as Parrish tweaks the EQ levels in a manner he's made his own, sounds somehow both supremely hot and cold-- like a long sustained freezer burn. Parrish rarely lays off the EQ, and his tracks are all the better for it. The smallest adjustments of sound-- upticks of treble on the drums, changes of emphasis on a vocal, the accentuation and/or subtraction of pretty much everything in play at any given moment-- make what might sound like the simplest tracks spellbinding over time. And they lend Sound Sculptures a casual, easygoing sense of something always happening, as in ""They Say"", a sensuous soul song (with cooed vocals by MonicaBlaire) that sounds like IDM but way less mannered-- like Aphex Twin made by back-porch means. Or ""Love Triumphant"", a nearly 12-minute spell of flute-strewn disco with a simmering rhythm that makes nodding along less an option than an order. Disc 2 starts off with another long song, ""Goin' Downstairs/Music?"", that lays bare all of Parrish's charms: hypnotic snap beats, sweaty organ chords, flashing tambourine, moody bass, vocals that seem to be saying something important in a mist of murmurs and sighs. ""The Rink"" amps up the energy to rollerskating speed (with a sample of Marvin Gaye) and ""Synthetic Flemm"" (made with fellow Detroit weird-house hero Omar-S) enlists an aggressive acid line. But even at his most immediate, Parrish is graced by a sense of withholding that proves all the more generous and expressive over time.","A 2xCD set that follows a 3x12"" 2007 release of the same name, this expanded version of Sound Sculptures Volume 1 shows the diversity of the house producer's vision, ranging from fully realized vocal songs to minimal tracks built from defiantly crude beats.

"We Are Beautiful, We Are Doomed",Los Campesinos!,by: Marc Hogan,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Senior Staff Writer</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bdefabf31b7dc715606a/1:1/w_160/b57484aa.jpg,2008-11-18 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12424-we-are-beautiful-we-are-doomed/,Wichita,"First there's the rule about not naming your band with an exclamation point, period. Then there's the one about not changing your last names so they're all the same as the band's, unless you're the Ramones (or arguably the Pastels). Referring to yourselves in a language not spoken in your country of origin? Another bad idea. Welsh boy/girl septet Los Campesinos! proved themselves an exception to all those rules this spring with Hold on Now, Youngster..., a debut album that encapsulated the best of three decades of indie's participatory culture. There's no rule yet about not releasing a follow-up to your debut album in the same year, mostly because few bands have had the audacity to try it. Los Campesinos! are hedging their bets: they have yet to refer to We Are Beautiful, We Are Doomed as their ""second album,"" even when they announced it would come in a limited pressing with a DVD documentary, poster, and 30-page zine (including contributions from members of Xiu Xiu, Grandaddy, Tender Forever, Menomena, Parenthetical Girls, and the Beautiful South). There will be no singles (and to these ears, there are none), and some online retailers have taken to listing the 10-track, 32-minute release as a ""mini-album."" Forget the technicalities and call it what it is: a messy, glorious, and cohesive artistic document of internet café-era indie life that sounds best when sung by heart. Recorded in Seattle with John Goodmanson (Bikini Kill, Sleater-Kinney, Wu-Tang Clan), We Are Beautiful, We Are Doomed is a fittingly noisy release from a band who recently spent time on the ""Shred Yr Face"" tour with No Age and Times New Viking. The seismic instrumental ""Between an Erupting Earth and an Exploding Sky"" is reminiscent of a Swell Maps soundscape, and leads directly into the motorik-locked melancholia of ""You'll Need Those Fingers for Crossing"". Standout ""Heart Swells/Pacific Daylight Time"" is a lovelorn miniature epic, with gusting guitars and Parenthetical Girls-quoting lo-fi vocals which shift midway through to folky strums and scratchy, indecipherable mumbling. If you mistakenly dismissed the band as another set of childish twee-poppers, our special today is crow. Los Campesinos! haven't changed drastically, though. Their self-loathing, anti-romantic bitterness, and LiveJournal detail have only intensified. Several songs sound like scuffed-up, feedback-streaked versions of the first record's shouty, strings- and glockenspiel-touched punk-pop, only the despair is now less deceptively perky, and more, um, desperate. Crashing opener ""Ways to Make It Through the Wall"" resigns itself to hopelessness, death, and the inevitability of becoming like our parents, even as it wonders ""how you break the rules that you yourself imposed."" Bleaker still, ""The End of the Asterisk"" rages of another person's self-deprecation, ""It's spot on, and I'm better."" The precocious youngsters of the debut have become increasingly like the prematurely old man of Weezer's classic Pinkerton. Vomit is a recurring theme, on the cathartic title track and on ""Miserabilia"", which describes kneeling at urinals and imagines an ex masturbating. From 4 a.m. drunk dialing, ""It's Never That Easy Though, Is It? (Song for the Other Kurt)"" goes on to contemplate which is worse: ""To see my ex-girlfriend/ Who by the way, I'm still in love with/ Sucking the face of some pretty boy""? Or to watch it happen ""with my favorite band's most popular song in the background""? The finale, ""All Your Kayfabe Friends"", screeches to a halt after a fateful closing line: ""I love the look of lust between your thighs."" Los Campesinos! know their history; they may be doomed, but not just to repeat it. We Are Beautiful, We Are Doomed's ragged sound and distinctive packaging, like the band's propensity for non-album 7""s, hearken back to previous decades, but they're also an attempt to develop a new underground community in the here and now. ""We want this to feel like a proper event, the sort of thing that you're going to be hyped about going to see for days or weeks before, and the sort of thing that when you leave will stick long in your memory, and that you'll be happy to have been a part of,"" co-lead singer Gareth Campesinos! says ramblingly of the Shred Yr Face tour, addressing us-- as rappers often do but indie rockers so far usually haven't-- via YouTube. ""It is, undoubtedly, a little narcissistic,"" he adds. It ain't trickin' if you got it.","Just eight months after the release of their debut album, Los Campesinos! already return with the follow-up-- a messy, glorious, noisy document of internet café-era indie life that sounds best when sung by heart.

Welcome to Mali,Amadou & Mariam,by: Joe Tangari,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bdfbeb335119a49ecfc1/1:1/w_160/fb137034.jpg,2008-11-18 06:00:01,Global,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12435-welcome-to-mali/,Because,"2005's Dimanche à Bamako rocketed Amadou & Mariam to international acclaim more than three decades after the beginnings of their respective musical careers. It was a richly deserved arrival that retained the spirit of their music with new beats and sounds incorporated by global pop star Manu Chao and his co-producers Marc-Antoine Moreau and Lauren Jais. On Welcome to Mali, Moreau and Jais stick around to steer the duo toward a harder, more outright pop approach. Damon Albarn also drops in to produce the opening track and first single ""Sabali"", one of the best things he's been involved in this decade. The song opens in overtly nostalgic territory, with Mariam Doumbia's resigned opening lines run through a light filter, but it soon jumps into a different realm, with her falsetto sweeping over mournful keyboards. It's not every day you hear an African record that uses ELO as a touchstone, but this song does it to devastating emotional effect. That opening shot is part of an eclectic landscape that at times sounds West African and at others sounds completely divorced from geography. Dimanche à Bamako, which means ""Sunday in Bamako"", Mali's capital, felt like a product of that city. Welcome to Mali, however, seems a strange title for a record that sounds so global. The dramatic string arrangement on the English-language ""I Follow You"" is distinctly European, while Canadian/Somali rapper K'Naan's shout-out to the ""original West Coast-East Coast collaboration"" could either refer to Africa's East and West Coasts or to Africa's West Coast and America's East Coast-- the two ends of the trans-Atlantic slave trade. Sequencing is important, too-- the Western strings of ""I Follow You"" come on the heels of the solo-bowed instrument that lends a place-less feel to ""Bozos"". Amadou's guitar is a little less prominent on this record than the last, but close listening reveals impressive stylistic dexterity as he moves from simple strumming to fluid melodic playing to staccato rhythmic patterns inspired by the Malian ngoni, a cousin of the guitar. Somewhat improbably, Amadou & Mariam have become a musical laboratory where the two principle players, the blind couple from Mali, are willing to try nearly anything. Ivorian reggae star Tiken Jah Fakoli drops in on one track and it feels completely natural. Pianos aren't common in Africa because the weather makes it tough to keep them in tune, but there's piano all over this album, and it sounds great rubbing up against koras (17-string West African harp) and balafons (West African marimba). On the title track, Amadou's guitar accents the chorus with big, bent surf chords, and it sounds not only logical but inevitable. ""Inevitable"" is a pretty good word for the stardom of Amadou & Mariam. People this amazingly talented and open to new sounds and ideas rarely remain obscure, especially after so many years honing their craft and building their catalog. On further examination, in fact, Welcome to Mali might not be such a strange title after all. This album is an affirmation of global connectivity and an emerging global culture that transcends and repurposes tradition as it sees fit-- the sound of Mali merging with the world at large.","Amadou & Mariam reached international acclaim after 2005's Dimanche à Bamako; they follow that with a more global record featuring guests from France, the Ivory Coast, and Canada, as well as Englishman Damon Albarn.

Crack,Z-Ro,by: Evan McGarvey,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bdf55e6ef95969323191/1:1/w_160/15b2e6b4.jpg,2008-11-17 06:00:05,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12430-crack/,Rap-A-Lot,"Foreclosure is nipping at hip-hop's heels. Though it doesn't look it thanks to a broad, impressive list of releases from this and last year-- led by, in no specific order, Bun B's crowd-pleasing II Trill, Trae's wrenching Life Goes On, Devin the Dude's uncanny Waiting to Inhale and Scarface's lion-in-winter MADE-- even Houston's once evergreen Rap-A-Lot records is a house going to seed. Trae left the label in May. Devin has fled too, and already dropped a new full-length disc-- with Razor & Tie of all places. For Z-Ro, who first appeared in the corners of DJ Screw's chain of drizzling, endless mid-1990s classics (most of which are now conveniently repackaged and available at your nearest Best Buy-- start with the 3xCD June 27), and has released five albums already on Rap-A-Lot, the whole world is starting to sound like it's closing up shop. Case in point is Z-Ro's sixth on Rap-A-Lot, Crack, which is drab, shabby and more than a little lonely (""I smoke purple stuff alone in my room""). It can't make its terrain of solipsistic gangsters and Houston beltway-sulk hum with emotion or its layers of horns and hi-hats shake with any color. Z-Ro produces eight of the album's 15 tracks, and leans on heaps of previous compositions. The raided discs include the last two Trae albums and Trae and Z-Ro's two collaborations, 2003's A.B.N (Assholes by Nature) and this summer's downpour of noir, It Is What It Is. The samples are all tamped down and strip-mined in their reincarnations on Crack. ""Here We Go"" features an inexplicable pan flute and a lifeless snare. The would-be ladies-jam ""Baby Girl"" reeks with clumps of digital sparkle and hubby-talk: ""She follow my lead/ And respect the fact that I wear the pants."" Z-Ro's hook is that the intimacy in his raps-- perpetually commemorating a handful of dead collaborators and friends, worshiping solitude and seemingly dismissing all worldly pleasures (except, of course, kush, candy paint, and lean)-- dips into weakness. On Crack he scoffs at dancing on ""If That's How You Feel"": ""My body don't move like that, so Im'a chill/ Im'a play the wall, leaving all to dancing to y'all."" He'd prefer it if no one called and no one spoke; four wheels are typically all the company he needs. But for all his confession Z-Ro brushes his breakthroughs aside. As soon has he resonates with real sentiment-- on divorce: ""I don't give a fuck as long as my child knows me""-- the album swoops back into dropsied howls about those suspicious club hos and these disrespectful young corner boys. Where, say, Scarface, may hold a mournful note for an extra beat, Z-Ro instantly flips into a stream of pithy taunts and complaints. The effect is dulling, frustrating, and more than a little repulsive. Z-Ro at least had his strengths catered to on 2005's Let the Truth Be Told. There, the underrated long-time Scarface producer Mike Dean laid out a chain of warmer, blues-inflected guitar and drum loops for Z-Ro's moans. Dean is totally absent from Crack and other veteran Houston producers like Mr. Lee can't summon any suitable nostalgia, which makes Z-Ro seem even more alone. All the shining lights of the Houston scene sport something ineffable: Scarface's transcendent violence; Devin's beat-poet-leer; Trae's whorls of emotional concision; Big Moe's druggy, violet sunshine. Z-Ro has always been satisfied playing the brassy, noncommittal grump. That's a fine enough role to play, but as the world around him downsizes and constricts, he's clamming up, retreating home and phoning it in.","Busy Houston MC's sixth Rap-A-Lot offering sounds drab and more than a little lonely; guests include Slim Thug and Paul Wall.

Hallam Foe OST,Various Artists,by: Joshua Klein,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bdf85e6ef95969323197/1:1/w_160/b740e0d7.jpg,2008-11-17 06:00:04,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12432-hallam-foe-ost/,Domino,"Growing up is tough. Perhaps growing up in Scotland is particularly tough, which may explain why so many young people there turn to music-- playing it, listening to it-- for relief. Music plays a similarly large role in Hallam Foe, the Scottish coming of age tale (renamed ""Mister Foe"" for no good reason in the States) starring Jamie Bell as the titular anti-hero, a troubled teen voyeur with major mother issues set loose in the country's capitol of Edinburgh to find himself and work through his various problems. The mind of Bell's Foe is full of conspiracy theories and obsessions, with stalking and spying his primary coping mechanisms. Needless to say, much of the twisted film features Bell wordlessly observing the world, which leaves plenty of room for music to fill the gaps. Certainly director David Mackenzie designed the film that way, considering the consistently strong use of music-- and especially music from Scottish acts-- in his movies. The Last Great Wilderness, for example, enlisted the Pastels. Young Adam featured a score by David Byrne (lest one forget, a green-card-carrying Scot in American clothing). And for Hallam Foe, Mackenzie worked with Domino to license a number of Scottish bands for the film's soundtrack, including Franz Ferdinand, James Yorkston, U.N.P.O.C., Sons and Daughters, King Creosote, and Orange Juice. It's Orange Juice's ""Blue Boy"" that kicks off both film and soundtrack, and it's also the last bit of prominent vocal we get in the film itself until around the halfway point, when the instrumental teases give way for a brief taste of (non Scot) Clinic's ""If You Could Read Your Mind."" U.N.P.O.C.'s ""Here on My Own"" is enlisted for a brief montage (just as it was for the film's trailer), but it's nice to hear the full version here from the obscure band. Much of the rest of Hallam Foe, film and soundtrack alike, features snippets of wistful or folky tracks courtesy of artists like Yorkston and Woodbine, with the occasional digression by, for example, Junior Boys (""Double Shadow"" is used in a bar scene). Presumably due to licensing issues, two of the Scottish acts arguably best suited to Mackenzie's quietly intriguing and tonally introspective tale, Belle and Sebastian and Boards of Canada, are nowhere to be found. The former would have been the perfect fit for Mackenzie's movie, certainly more so than they were for Todd Solondz's Storytelling. And Boards of Canada are downright cinematic to begin with, though their enigmatic amorphousness is approached by the presence of Argentina's Juana Molina, whose loopy folktronica ""Salvese Quien Pueda"" at least feels right for the film. However, stepping up with unlikely mastery of mood rather than manic energy comes everyone's favorite chart-topping Scots Franz Ferdinand, whose somewhat literal-minded ""Hallam Foe Dandelion Blow"" falls closer to the ghostly psych of, say, the Coral than the group's usual métier. Listening to FF stretch their boundaries a bit makes you wonder what the disc (and movie) would have been like overseen by a single artist, as B&S did with the aforementioned Storytelling or Badly Drawn Boy did wonderfully with About a Boy. Even if it captures the film's oddball sensibilities as is, the Hallam Foe set is slightly more sampler than soundtrack and certainly less effective separated from the scenes with which Mackenzie paired them. After all, in the end it's a movie about looking, not listening, and these songs don't always resonate outside their designated context.","Director David Mackenzie's strange coming of age tale is soundtracked by Scottish bands including Franz Ferdinand and Orange Juice, with further contributions from Domino artists including Clinic, Juana Molina, and Junior Boys.

Exposion,White Denim,by: David Bevan,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bdfdc0084474cd0c2df8/1:1/w_160/2929e72a.jpg,2008-11-17 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12437-exposion/,Transmission,"Over the past year and change, White Denim have acted as hype superconductors. Their self-released Let's Talk About It EP was twitchy and muddy-- it both stood out alongside the more orderly indie rock set and seemed advanced for an unsigned band. Decidedly raw, their psych-blues riffs were fun to trace as they careened into jammier territory. The Austin group went on to issue Workout Holiday, a full-length released only in Europe; now a re-shuffled version, Exposion, serves as its U.S. debut. With the ommission of EP tracks ""Let's Talk About It"" and ""Darksided Computer Mouth"", Exposion isn't so easily characterized-- and the group comes off as more versatile, more than DIY Nuggets throwbacks. Opener ""Don't Look That Way at It"" loops a chickenscratch guitar and mashes it into a loose, sore-throated chorus. The song seems to outline their central creed: paint the neat sloppy, the tight loose, the drunk totally in control, and force nothing. With guitar noodling galore, much of Exposion accentuates those aims. The more straightforward ""Shake Shake Shake"" and ""Transparency"" are fully realized rockers that unravel and work out their psychedelic tangles in eventually thoughtful closing arguments. On the flip side, the breezy electric folk of ""Heart From Us All"" builds and fills before spilling into a beautiful vocal turn by frontguy James Petralli. ""Shake Shake Shake"" in particular showcases bassist Steve Terebecki's gift for putting songs on his back. Alongside drummer Josh Block's polyrhythmic supernovas, the two form a timekeeping section that can maul and tickle almost simultaneously, depending on the tenor of Petralli's shouts and croon. ""You Can't Say"" is a refreshingly focused and tender-footed shoegazer that puts his pipes on ice. It's a standout moment that provides a much more satisfying breather than instrumental ""Migration Wind"", a punchy jazz number that threatens to jump the tracks.

NYC,Kieran Hebden and Steve Reid,by: Andy Battaglia,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929be00c0084474cd0c2e00/1:1/w_160/fb23745c.jpg,2008-11-17 06:00:02,Jazz,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12440-nyc/,Domino,"The recent Four Tet EP Ringer not only revealed Kieran Hebden to be a surprisingly dexterous techno producer, but also found him making an asset out of his greatest liability. For all the cosmic wonder he can evoke by placing electronics against naturalistic backdrops, Hebden has often gotten himsef stuck in ruts, even if just for a few moments here and there. In part, that's the fate of an improviser, but it's exacerbated by samplers and machines that can be slow to respond to Hebden's shifts, however smartly they're triggered. In improvised music, it's one thing to sound like you're in transition and another thing to actually be in transition. None of that mattered on Ringer, thanks in part to techno's formalist grounding. But it matters a lot on NYC, the fourth album made by Hebden and jazz drummer Steve Reid. Ringer's functional dance-music accepts, even privileges, the kind of ruts that have tripped up Hebden in the past; NYC, meanwhile, puts them to work in settings that serve different purposes. On the duo's earlier albums, Hebden and Reid occasionally sounded like they were only barely aware of what the other was doing or might stand to do next. On NYC, they sound much more conscious and sympathetic. ""Lyman Place"" starts the album with an unvarying few-note bass-line set against the sound of a jet engine rising in long, slow takes. It sounds like something Miles Davis would have done in the 1970s, and Hebden's relative understatedness helps set off Reid's drumming-- circular, splashy, coyly shrouded by the shimmer of persistent cymbals. ""1st & 1st"" follows with a fit of funk built around a guitar sample that Hebden makes sound twitchy, like a signal from a world away. It sounds as if Hebden made a strategic decision to do less on this album, which heightens the impact when he does make a move. Reid benefits greatly from the space to breathe-- much of his drumming on the duo's other records sounds comparatively crowded and confused by how to connect with Hebden. And Hebden himself shows off a new sense of always being in the right place at the right time, without getting caught out in between. He hasn't lost any of the polyglot record-collector drive that has made Four Tet matter from the start: NYC wanders through spells informed by melodica-strewn dub, shoegaze rock, weird folk, and of course the clattering sense of purpose at work in free-jazz. But Hebden sounds considerably more easy-going now, like he's taking time to listen in to what comes out as it happens all around him.","On their fourth collaboration, Four Tet's Kieran Hebden and jazz drummer Steve Reid sound more in-tune with one another than ever before.

Parallax Error Beheads You,Max Tundra,by: Nitsuh Abebe,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bdc3ea9e61561daa7791/1:1/w_160/a53c5d7b.jpg,2008-11-17 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12426-parallax-error-beheads-you/,Domino,"It probably bears mentioning that Max Tundra's second album, 2002's Mastered by Guy at the Exchange, is passionately, obsessively, madly loved by quite a few music-geek and critic types, including yours truly. Yet none of us harbored any delusions that our love-- or the 9.3 rating from this site-- was ever going to make the record popular: The sound of his music is pretty evidently Not for Everyone, and that's precisely where the love comes from. Painstakingly assembled by a Londoner named Ben Jacobs, the music of Max Tundra is strikingly unique, documenting a whole other realm of pop music that seems to exist mostly inside one guy's head. There are recognizable things within it: streaks of quaint English pop and soul, oddball programming of video-game synth sounds, a keyboard sensibility that ranges from lite funk to a kind of gleeful prog-rock musical theater, and a happy calm that vaguely recalls Vince Guaraldi's Peanuts music. It's tempting to describe it all using some outlandish metaphor: I imagine a reality show where XTC, Prince, Aphex Twin, and George Gershwin have to live together inside the sound chip of an aging Game Boy. But that makes Max Tundra sound cartoonish and scattershot, when the surprise of this stuff is how much it can all feel beautiful, simple, and coherent. Now, after six years spent programming on archaic Amiga music software, Max Tundra gives us the follow-up, Parallax Error Beheads You. At first listen, this set of pop songs may seem more cluttered and frantic than its predecessor; much like the string of remixes Jacobs has done in the meantime, the music here is peppier and more tightly wound, and more melodically serpentine than ever. Give it a few listens, though, and you begin to feel like someone is sneaking in while you sleep and removing twists and turns from the songs, or straightening out the rhythms. The old line about literature is that a good book teaches you how to read it; in this case, a record might be teaching you how to listen to it. What starts out tricky and overwhelming quickly organizes itself in your head and becomes a joy to follow, to the point where you can delight in all the detail Jacobs packs in: The way he lets harmonies unravel and then step neatly back into focus, or how he executes chord changes by shifting the whole song down a few steps, like someone putting a thumb on a spinning record. What programmer spends six years on 10 songs without making sure every one of those details works? A good starting point is the record's least tricky song, ""The Entertainment"", a quaint and sunny piece that sounds something like trance music for children. Another is the track that's bound to be the album's great takeaway, ""Which Song"", with its pop-soul vocals and creamy synthesizers. The 10-minute closer, ""Until We Die"", sounds like Tundra's answer to side two of Abbey Road, but the one I can't stop playing is ""Number Our Days"", which plays out like some kind of amateur musical about the afterlife, with sinister synth-funk verses and angelic strumming through the choruses. For those who've been following Jacobs, the big news on this record is entirely personal. On his last album, he explained the way his lyrics work (""I only sing about things that happen to me"") and talked rather a lot about having stolen someone's girlfriend, which neatly explained the title of his debut (Some Best Friend You Turned Out to Be). Not long into the first track here, a bouncy pastoral piece called ""Gum Chimes"", we get an update: Jacobs and the girlfriend in question have split up. Many of the lyrics that follow are, simply put, a lonely geek's lament-- the frustrations of a guy who's always distracted by a ""future wife,"" yet can't find a girl to bring home to the family. I really can't tell whether this is wonderfully human, slightly embarrassing, or just honest, but my sense of who Jacobs is has jumped way, way forward with this record. Thinking back on his last conversation with that girlfriend, Jacobs sings, ""a pint of chicken soup came falling from my eyes."" The fact that he's now actually selling cans of his own homemade chicken soup is mostly a joke, but it's also a metaphor; if this joyfully hyperactive record is what comes of his troubles, we're all the luckier. It's packed with ideas, some of which work beautifully and some of which are just a joy to hear play out, but most of all, it's still a whole other world of pop music-- an absolutely unique, enchanting, and irreplaceable vision of how the stuff can work.","After six years, Max Tundra finally follows 2002's Mastered by Guy at the Exchange, a record that is passionately, obsessively, and madly loved by quite a few music-geek types for its strikingly unique sound, what seems to be a whole other realm of pop music that exists mostly inside one guy's head.

Starfucker,STRFKR,by: Rebecca Raber,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bdc6c0084474cd0c2d90/1:1/w_160/ee9f7be4.jpg,2008-11-14 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12419-starfucker/,Badman,"First things first: If you want to understand the fuss surrounding this Portland, Ore. trio, you should see them in concert. Dressed in exaggerated, skinny-hipster re-imaginings of old-school rappers or drag queens, Starfucker come off like a combination of Chromeo and ELO, indulging in theatrical silliness while conjuring sugary pop hooks. Onstage, the members swap multiple instruments, providing a kinetic, anything-can-happen energy. But sadly, the studio strips Starfucker of their visual appeal, rhythmic heft, and electricity, leaving wispy electro-pop songs, washed-out vocals, and skittishly edited samples in their place. Their self-titled debut is a mix of primary songwriter Josh Hodges' home recordings and some after-the-fact finessing from his bandmates and label head, which helps explain why it feels flatter than the group's full-bodied stage show. The tinny percussion and slinky, reverb-laden bass are shadows of their usual selves. And the songs-- always saturated with themes of heartbreak, loneliness, and loss behind upbeat instrumentation-- simply feel boringly melancholy without the live party atmosphere. Most of these songs are wrapped in a gauzy, echo-laden wash that has a distancing effect on the music, but a few lovely standouts pierce the poor production. ""German Love"" latches on to a sweet guitar melody amidst stuttering samples, layering a bright sing-along chorus over a neon keyboard line. ""Holly"" marries cheeky, deadpan lyrics (""L.A. hasn't killed me yet"") to ticking percussion, soulful guitar, and a repetitive, descending synth riff for a track that wouldn't sound out of place on Fujiya & Miyagi's setlist. And ""Pop Song"" is exactly as advertised: A strutting gem that uses a funky bassline, distorted effects, and videogame synths to enhance the band's best melody. Unfortunately, too many of the songs highlight Starfucker's shortcomings, leaving them introspective, detached, and even timid. If this three-piece can learn to have as much fun in the studio as they do onstage, these fuckers might actually become stars.","Despite their fierce live presence, this Portland, Ore. trio's debut strips them of their visual appeal, rhythmic heft, and onstage electricty.

Silence Is Wild,Frida Hyvönen,by: Stephen M. Deusner,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bddfc0084474cd0c2dc0/1:1/w_160/8d324973.jpeg,2008-11-14 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12414-silence-is-wild/,Secretly Canadian,"The piano bench has become a refuge for idiosyncratic singer-songwriters like Regina Spektor, Tori Amos, and Nellie McKay, but even within this growing category, Swedish-born Frida Hyvönen stands out as uncategorizable. She defines herself by her quirks: Her songs, which are too dark and sexual to be labeled precious, take their convoluted metaphors a step or two too far, and her prose-poem lyrics often create verse lines with odd, sometimes amelodic meters. In general, she intimates a bohemian outlook and a self-consciousness that occasionally threatens to render her songs meta. In this regard, her debut, Until Death Comes, was slightly muted, as if she were unsure how to differentiate herself musically, but her follow-up, Silence Is Wild, sounds not only more assured in its arrangements and performances, but more lively for being so self-indulgent. Hyvönen has gained an appreciation for enormity and melodrama. Big choruses convey big ideas, and her lyrics can be almost defiantly sentimental. Opener ""Dirty Dancing"" begins as a reminiscence of her first crush, then leaps forward to meeting him years later, their paths having diverged so completely that memories of playacting Dirty Dancing together are all they have in common. Throughout the verses, Hyvönen weaves in passages of ""Be My Baby"" (from that movie's soundtrack), and the paper-thin wall of sound on the outro is all the more affecting for being constructed from the materials at hand: voice, piano, and of course castanets. ""Enemy Within"" shares that sense of theatricality, adding a choir and an enormous chorus. Too bad its lyrics sound so meaningless: ""Stone on the bottom of the ocean says I know this is not a cul-de-sac."" The tangled metaphor of ""Highway 2 U"", in which Hyvönen literally says she's not afraid to flip off the cops on the figurative road to romance, is easier to forgive, as the song's palpable sexual tension and her wordless howls make that sentiment come across as feverishly unguarded. These songs may seem elaborate, but Hyvönen is only working with a handful of elements. Her small, unobtrusive band gives the ABBA-meets-Fleetwood Mac ""Scandinavian Blonde"" and the city ode ""London!"" an excited urgency, Ida Lundén's synths lend texture and character to a handful of tracks, and though ""Oh Shanghai"" has some gongs and percussion, it's the orchestrated exception to the rule. That big-yet-basic sound is just another of Hyvönen's quirks, hinting at something dark and insoluble threading through these songs. She knows she's a bit different from the rest of the world, and that self-awareness gives a song like ""My Cousin"" added impact: As strings swirl quietly around her, Hyvönen realizes she and her man aren't the marrying kind (""we live outside the realms of yes and no"" is how she puts it), but wants to find her own equivalent measure of love and security. One suggests itself on ""December"", a stoic number with a melancholy piano theme that describes their trip to an abortion clinic. His mere presence, bringing her coffee and a sandwich and offering support, might be measure enough, but she says she can taste the ""last breath of our love"" in his kiss. Whether the song is strictly autobiographical is beside the point. That Hyvönen sings about such matters on Silence Is Wild is brave enough, but that she does so with such a complicated sense of generous affection and self-preserving detachment truly sets her apart.","An idiosyncratic, piano-playing singer-songwriter in the mold of Regina Spektor and Nellie McKay, Frida Hyvonen's second album wrings big ideas and bigger choruses from sparse instrumentation.

By-the-Numbers,The Postmarks,by: Marc Hogan,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Senior Staff Writer</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bde913d197565213b655/1:1/w_160/ce6f902a.jpg,2008-11-14 06:00:02,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12421-by-the-numbers/,Unfiltered,"Last year's self-titled debut by sumptuous South Florida trio the Postmarks was full of songs that sounded like they might've been covers. Christopher Moll and Jonathan Wilkins, both previously of a Stereolab-leaning outfit called See Venus, crafted lavish, loungey arrangements that merged bossa nova, John Barry film scores, Burt Bacharach, Brian Wilson, and vintage French pop within direct, pure-pop songcraft enamored of romance and rainy days. Tel Aviv-born singer Tim Yehezkely's shy whisper was a perfect final ingredient, evoking twee-poppers like the Softies or Camera Obscura as well as the seductive sophisti-pop of Unfiltered label chiefs Ivy. The Postmarks' second full-length actually is a covers album-- and a fine one, at that. By-the-Numbers follows the band's beguiling online-only recordings of Astrud Gilberto's swoonsome love song ""Dreamer"" and, more adventurously, Ministry's ""Everyday Is Halloween"". The project began as a monthly series of cover songs to be posted on eMusic, but by September the group had realized they had enough material for another proper album instead. There's one (yes, slightly precious) organizing principle: Each of the songs has a number in its title, counting up from 1 to 11, until the finale, the counting-to-12 ""Pinball Number Drop"" originally sung by the Pointer Sisters for ""Sesame Street"". Even if you didn't pay any attention to the song titles, By-the-Numbers would still be a collection of good-to-great songs performed in the swoonsome style the Postmarks made their signature on their first record. Yehezkely's understatement suits the less-is-more theme of ""One Note Samba""; based on Antoni Carlos Jobim's version, the cover is a natural fit for the Postmarks' already Brazilian-tinged sound. Yehezkely's softness also settles nicely into the whirling strings of the more stridently Nancy Sinatra-sung Bond theme ""You Only Live Twice"" (familiar to those of us of a certain age and radio-listening habits as sampled in Robbie Williams' dire Y2K cash-in ""Millennium""). These slippers were made for walking to bed. When the Postmarks have to stretch more to make the songs their own, the results are no less satisfying. Bob Marley's ""Three Little Birds"" might have stood out like a fat white guy in a rastafarian hat, but instead it's a slow-motion highlight, with gentle guitars and wide-screen percussion. Rock-style drums and shimmery guitar lines do show up to grace the Postmarks' takes on Ride's ""OX4"" and the Jesus and Mary Chain's ""Nine Million Rainy Days"", but both manage to convey the nuance within the group's style rather than deviating too much from it-- if Air could soundtrack a Sofia Coppola film, why not these cats? Blondie's ""11:59"" is a bit of a reach, but getting more upbeat doesn't hurt the Postmarks here. An Ennio Morricone-flavored remake of the Byrds' ""Eight Miles High"" is the only track that doesn't quite cohere, although David Bowie's regal croon is missed on ""Five Years"". One revelation is the Ramones ""7-11"", which ends up sounding less like a deadpan punk-pop reference to girl-group classics than a sincere and all-new teenage symphony. ""Whatever happened to the radio?/ And where did all the fun songs go?"" Yehezkely murmurs, per Joey R., embodying the song's tragic ""Leader of the Pack""/""Last Kiss""-esque conclusion as if there had never been a ""Leader of the Pack"" or ""Last Kiss"". By-the-Numbers probably wouldn't have ever been played much on the radio in the past couple of decades, and its mood is more relaxing than fun, but it's a lovely set of covers that sound like they could've been originals. Hey, somebody give the Postmarks another number.","The Postmarks follow their lavish, loungey debut with a record of covers, featuring takes on numerical songs by Blondie, Astrud Gilberto, JAMC, and more.

Body Language Vol. 7,Matthew Dear,by: Tim Finney,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bdebea9e61561daa77e6/1:1/w_160/961f923f.jpg,2008-11-14 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12422-body-language-vol-7/,Get Physical,"To make a massive oversimplification, minimal techno in 2007 was all about Luciano's live DJ sets. The head of German label Cadenza may not have initiated the genre's trend away from minimalism and back towards deep house classicism, but he made it exciting. In the process, he practically trademarked many of the year's key tracks. Luciano switched easily from brain-frying hypnotism to body-moving funk, blurring distinctions between the two. Unfortunately, his official 2008 DJ mix, Fabric41, veers too much toward the former, restricting access to the ""ultimate Luciano live experience"" to those who download bootlegged live sets. As if on cue, Michigan-based DJ/producer Matthew Dear steps up to the plate with Body Language Vol. 7, a mix for Berlin's Get Physical label that apes the Chilean DJ's minimal European techno and deep U.S. house-- a circuitous route sure to annoy purists of all stripes. Dear's the right kind of artist to jump on this trend: From the quirky micro-pop records he releases under his own name to the coldly monolithic bangers he concocts under his Audion alias, he has a knack for taking other people's blueprints to their logical conclusions. Dear fares best when pushing to the extremes of the styles he spins here. In the minimal camp, Kalabrese's ""Cityblues"" is a murky cabaret number with its insistent bass pulse, Chic guitar, and erratic, live-sounding percussion, is as compelling as any of the house-noir that Kompakt's Matias Aguayo has made of late; Radio Slave's remix of Mlle Caro and Franck Garcia's ""Dead Souls"" counterposes eerie, fragile vocals with longform groove; DJ Koze's ""Zou Zou"" is the most imaginative adoption of world music this side of trumpeter Jon Hassell or Chilean minimal house producer Ricardo Villalobos. At the other end, the casual, celebratory vibe of Kid Sublime's delightfully glittery disco revival ""Basement Works Vol. 1"" evokes the best impromptu house party ever. And the set closes with Lorenzo's already classic 2001 anthem ""Get Deep"", its seductive bass punctuated with thick handclaps and yearning male vocals. Sometimes, though, the middle ground is also the highest ground: The set's best track is Seth Troxler and Patrick Russell's ""Doctor of Romance"", an endlessly involving groove concealing gently writhing layers of percussion and an army of murmured vocals, sighs, and grunts. The tribal workout of Basti Grub's ""Baaa Niii"" is nearly as strong, with its surround sound rhythms and slurred spoken-word vocals. An entire album of tracks like these would be irresistible rather than simply great. That Dear falls slightly short of this is less a measure of his own successes and shortcomings than those of the 2008 minimal scene. The triumph of deep house, which has replaced minimal as today's archetypal sound, has reinvigorated dance music values such as restraint, subtlety, and that most meaningless of words, ""deepness."" Minimal, on the other hand, placed a classicist-baiting emphasis on novelty, diversity, and melodrama. Lately, minimalism has departed from such values and lurched towards sameness, becoming a drab cliché. This year's ascendancy of rigorously reductive (but not minimal) deep house turns that pursuit of sameness into the norm, as producers craft undemonstrative, compulsive grooves. Subtlety and restraint can be great things in dance music, and many of the best dance tracks of the year are those that get this ""undemonstrative, compulsive"" mix just right; the trouble is that distinguishing between the scintillating and the boring becomes a challenge when these traits dominate. There are few truly awful records, yet far too many just-decent ones, and navigating the tiny stylistic space between them is increasingly difficult. In such conditions, Dear gets it right more often than most-- a good two-thirds of Body Language Vol. 7 is genuinely compelling-- but I can't shake the feeling he won this round by a throw of the dice.","Following last year's fantastic Asa Breed, Michigan-based DJ/producer Matthew Dear issues this mix of minimal techno and deep house on Berlin's famed Get Physical label.

Trying Hartz, a 2xCD, 28-track best-of collection, is a second point of entry for Danielson newcomers, a guide through his dense, hit-or-miss pre-Ships affairs, which could be a difficult slog for anyone without either a strong attention span or a long road trip ahead. But they also indicate that Danielson Famile's quirkiness and religious convictions aren't something to ""get past,"" and that, most of all, Ships didn't succeed because it marked out new territory but because of steady improvement in the group's craft. Trying Hartz would have been better served and more useful coming right on the heels of Ships, when curiousity over the band's back catalog was probably at its peak. By this point, curious Ships listeners have likely pillaged Danielson's discography; for those who always knew about the gems lurking on the group's previous LPs, it's hard to imagine the eight live tracks here are a proper substitute for either the originals or one's fond memories of Danielson's communal live sing-alongs. My own first experience with the Danielson Famile actually was a road trip along with their 2001 LP, Fetch the Compass Kids. Luckily that album, their best pre-Ships, is well represented, though many of my other favorites from the Danielson discography are absent (""We Don't Say Shut Up"", ""Things Against Stuff"", ""Gorgeous New Age"", ""Flesh Thang""). The only new tracks are a pair of six-second bookends, ""Now Try"" and closer ""Cheer Hart"". The older tracks are bursting with two- or three-note organ and keyboard lines, quick rhythms, and halting breaks. Their best songs remind you that they're a family-- Tri-Danielson!!! Alpha's ""Rubbernecker"" and Fetch the Compass Kids' ""Good News for the Pus Pickers"" even feature shout-outs highlighting a Danielson member or their instrument-- and the live tracks remind the audience they're part of that family as well. On ""Don't You Be the Judge"", Smith asks the crowd to think of their own verses to the song. ""I'm gonna call on ya, so you'd better be ready!"" he warns. He had to take the first one himself, but, after the demonstration, audience members volunteer to do the next four. Most of the tracks are about effort, about making small adjustments toward self-improvement and understanding others. These can be either funny or serious. ""Rallying the Dominoes"" warns against getting too caught up in your own projects; ""Daughters Will Tune You"" deals with that specific relationship. But there's plenty of humor, too: ""Idiot Boksen"" is about watching too much TV; and Smith sings ""Won't kiss no pottymouth/ Away with pottymouth"" toward the end of half-spoken-word oddity ""Pottymouth"". Outlier ""Pottymouth"" aside, the rest of their idiosyncratic sounds seems normal to me-- but I've been a fan for almost a decade. This collection isn't for fans, but for those who haven't dug deeper than Ships, or for those wrongly convinced Ships was a blip in an otherwise dense and unrewarding discography.","Trying Hartz, a 2xCD, 28-track best-of collection, is a second point of entry for Danielson newcomers, a guide through Daniel Smith and family's dense, hit-or-miss pre-Ships affairs.

Beyond their crunchy idyllic roots, living among the ferryboats and the evergreens, they share a unique way of seeing. One finds in their work a hallucinatory vision of the Pacific Northwest halfway between ""Twin Peaks"" and ""Northern Exposure"": Warm but weird, by turns cheerful and dark, equally alive to the natural and supernatural, and pleased as punch to tread the rim of civilization. Part of the younger generation of K Records renaissance men, the two collaborated on several under-the-radar releases as members of D+, a band that broadened the Olympia label's tradition of shaggy, sardonic, post-hippie quirk. Last year, Blau put out the softly electronic Dance Positive, where he folded 10 songs written by Bret Lunsford, a cornerstone of both D+ and the region's indie-rock titan Beat Happening, inside his own shabby-chic arrangements. What we got was a melancholy cross of folk motifs and Casio textures. Faithful to his DIY sensibility, it nevertheless proved a confident leap forward for Blau, whose previous record Beneath Waves (2006) wandered with mixed results, as his urge to experiment with diverse instruments and registers could, depending on the song, either smartly embellish or rudely interrupt the introspective moods and words. Nature's Got Away attains a better balance of cohesion and chaos. Taking less risks than AM, Blau still offers the same tattered arrangements and battered delivery that made Dance Positive such a warmly imperfect record; Blau arguably packs some of the best work of his career into the back half. And it is clear that, as he tames and grooms his unruly aesthetic, he has been sliding into a plot between the Microphones and Smog. It's hard not to feel Bill Callahan's dry winds of irony in ""2 Becomes 1"" and ""Mockingbird Diet"". The latter song turns an Animal Planet vignette into a poignant ballad, relying on fuzzy, shivering guitar melodies and jangly percussion to lend the Darwinian lyrics a sting of resignation. Even ""That's The Breaks"" and ""Make Love That Lasts"" have that touch of the cold-blooded old times, forging bittersweet moments from here-and-there backup vocals. At the same time, the airy delicacy of ""Stream of Ganders""-- evident not only in the spacious production and roaming composition, but in Blau's wispy, breathless singing-- remind us that he is still a disciple of Phil Elverum. (Though we get the sense that Blau's sonic debt to Elverum has been gradually paid down since the Beneath Waves days.) With the plastic, loitering tones of thrift-store keyboards, this song is also the obvious bridge from his past work to his present. In the trek from Point A to Point B, Blau has drawn from eclectic sources. He nodded to A.A. Milne, the creator of Pooh and relatively unsung poet, on AM and Japanese esotericists like Tori Kudo, of Maher Shalal Hash Baz, on this one. Here the rainbow of left-field influence even extends to Allan Kaprow, whom Blau channeled to describe his creative method, explaining that ""the director of a musical piece may find that the less heavy handed one can be, the more one can approach hands free and even getting out of the way of a 'happening.'"" Nature's Got Away retains the light touch of a seasoned auteur, but make no mistake: Blau's strange and humble presence is deeply felt. And he brings to each song a little whimsy, woe, and a deceptively intricate way to mash these sensibilities together.","This one-time Phil Elverum disciple still puts forth tattered arrangements and a battered delivery on his latest K Records release.

Nights Out,Metronomy,by: Adam Moerder,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bdbdea9e61561daa7781/1:1/w_160/798c873e.jpg,2008-11-13 06:00:03,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12403-nights-out/,Because,"Nights Out is the latest electro assault from the UK's growing brigade of squelch pop bands, joining the ranks of the Chap, Late of the Pier, and other synth sadists making NME giddy and audiophiles want to remove their frontal lobes. That's not to reduce Brighton's Metronomy to a fad, especially since they've proven their mettle on dozens of high-profile remixes and their own impressive singles. The transition from producer to album-oriented act, however, remains tricky for them. Their 2005 debut, Pip Paine (Pay the £5000 You Owe), incongruently forced together delicate dancefloor pop and harsh rock touches. And while Nights Out better corrals these influences, creating a much more cohesive album, it still suffers from a lack of consistency. Metronomy singer/producer Joseph Mount describes this album as a soundtrack to a tumultous weekend, and sure enough, there's plenty of drink-fueled lust, driving, partying, and of course, dancing. It's no surprise, then, that two songs about cardiac health-- ""My Heart Rate Rapid"" and ""Heartbreaker""-- contain the majority of the album's hooks. The former is a ramp-up to Metronomy's bacchanalian rager, its chipmunk vocals speeding up lockstep with the disco pulse. ""Heartbreaker"" immediately follows, squashing those increased serotonin levels, with Mount's effects-free vocal performance recalling Junior Boys vocalist Jeremy Greenspan's breathy bedroom croon. The resulting ballad, effective enough to tame the otherwise ADD production, provides an emotional comedown that also gives the listener's ears a breather. Unfortunately, Metronomy can't maintain the momentum. Throughout the album, they sprinkle cute instrumental interludes that feel more like production exercises than effective segues. The vocals don't exactly carry their weight, either. With the exception of ""A Thing for Me""'s excited cat calls, Mount douses his voice in self-conscious irony (and studio effects) to the point of near-total detachment. It'd be unfair to expect Metronomy to match the hooks of similar acts like Hot Chip or LCD Soundsystem, but even those groups manage to give the heartstrings an occasional tug, whereas tracks like ""Back on the Motorway"" or ""On Dancefloors"", two of the more tender moments here, simply seem to ponder how kooky 80s music was. Then again, these drawbacks don't make Nights Out any less appropriate a soundtrack to clubbing adventures, pub crawls or one-night stands. Although uneven, some of these random spurts seem to disorient intentionally, like “Side 2”, the dark intermission track that ushers in the album's, uh, darker second side. Yet the frenzied first half showcases Metronomy's strengths right off the bat: glitzy glam rock guitars butting heads with stubborn electro beats, neurotic disco paeans, and loads of synths. Nights Out may turn in a little too early, but for about three songs, it wrests synth pop supremacy from Metronomy's many competitors.","After a solid stretch of singles and remixes, this UK squelch-pop group aims to make a successful transition from producer to album-oriented act.

Neji/Tori,Nisennenmondai,by: Jessica Suarez,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bdd4c0084474cd0c2dac/1:1/w_160/813da28f.jpg,2008-11-13 06:00:02,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12400-nejitori/,Smalltown Supersound,"Nisennenmondai are a band of small attactive Japanese women who play pummeling, dense instrumentals. Their name translates to ""Y2K bug"" or ""year 2000 problem,"" and they've been around for 10 years, making albums, zines, live CD-Rs and handmade clothes. Still, they haven't released an album stateside. Neji/Tori, two of their earlier EPs bundled together, at least postpones that release gap in their discography. But their biggest problem is that on record you can't get the contrast between their physical size and the size of their music. It's that contrast that struck visiting U.S. musicians like Prefuse 73, who called them both ""tiny"" and ""diminuative"" in a Dazed & Confused interview. ""The drummer was as big as my hand,"" he said, before waxing romantic on their technical prowess. That contrast between size and sound is probably startling, but size doesn't matter much overseas. They may be dainty when compared to their U.S. counterparts, but their proper context is within Japan's lush experimental scene, from Koenjihyakkei to Boredoms and Merzbow, where women can be responsible for the harshest sounds. The two EPs here were released in 2004 and 2005, respectively. Tori's titles are in Japanese, but Neji's songs are named for their influences. ""Sonic Youth"" is aptly named, as bassist Yuri Zaikawa slows her nimble runs to approximate Kim Gordon's sturdy, deliberate plucks. But many other tracks show clear influences even if they're not named for them. ""Kyaaaaaaa"" partially turns into a rumbling surf tune, and ""Ikkkyokume"" snakes into a chase song for a 1960s spy flick. ""2534"" could have been called ""Lightning Bolt"", as their influence is clearest here (the band is also one of Nisennenmondai's stateside supporters). At just over one minute, it's their shortest song, but the best cuts here are the longer tracks, where the repetitiveness pushes forward and retreats over each iteration. Nisennenmondai's eagerness to depart from tonality and form is inherited as much from the free jazz tradition as from these named influences. Zaikawa and drummer Sayaka Himeno set up pins for guitarist Masako Takada to strike down via her looser, messier playing. Her approach doesn't contribute much to the overall ""small women with big chops"" image of the band-- she's not as muscular, her parts not as technically impressive-- but her guitar morphs while the others stay the same. No matter what sits on top, an undulating groove hides beneath noise, thanks to the Zaikawa and Himeno's precise rhythm. They'd be fun to watch, not for their size, but for how quickly and often Himeno's hi-hat must turn to shards. It almost seems a shame to put much distortion and noise over them, but their cleanest, most repetitive tracks, like ""Kyuukohan"", clearly fall behind the ones that combust. Nisennenmondai are pummeling, but not because they use repetition as a way of imprinting songs to your memory. They're bigger than that.","These Japanese avant-rockers have a decade-long history but no releases until now available outside of their home country; this collection of two EPs includes tracks like ""Sonic Youth"" and ""This Heat"", named for bands they admire.

Fordlândia,Jóhann Jóhannsson,by: Andrew Gaerig,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bde8abf31b7dc715605c/1:1/w_160/50760657.jpg,2008-11-13 06:00:01,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12420-fordlandia/,4AD,"At his best, Jóhann Jóhannsson displays patience and deploys silence the way traditional composers employ melody and dissonance. While the Icelandic composer's IBM 1401: A User's Manual-- a 2006 concept album about one of the earliest computers to arrive in his country-- was a distinct step down from his best work, it was a compelling narrative that fully complemented his stylistic choices: slow crescendos, voices reciting instruction manuals, and lingering digital noise. The second installment of a planned trilogy introduced by IBM, Fordlândia shifts Jóhannsson's technological narrative to more abstract sources: Henry Ford's failed procurement of rubber in the Amazon, a Victorian priestess and the death of Pan, and lamentably misguided scientists. Musically, Fordlândia will sound familiar to Jóhannsson fans-- it's full of gorgeously sweeping strings aided by gently babbling electronics. If nothing in that description immediately brings to mind an automobile magnate haphazardly erecting an American-ized village for Brazilian rubber farmers, you're not alone. Jóhannsson is accustomed to collaborating with visual artists-- he has scored more than a half-dozen film soundtracks and IBM was originally intended to accompany a dance performance. Standing alone, Fordlândia-- recorded partially with the same Prague orchestra that performed IBM-- compensates by being the most traditionally dramatic of Jóhannsson's works. The nearly 14-minute title track opens the album with a minute of near-silence, but from there the composer's heartstring symphony starts tugging hard. The sky-blue splendor of the major-key mix recalls, to cite a geographically obvious example, the wordless thrum of fellow Icelanders Sigur Rós. ""The Rocket Builder (Io Pan!)"", ostensibly about a pagan scientist from California who blows himself up, is tenser and more paranoid. Small string ripples interrupt a minor-key piano melody; electronic percussion titters in the background. Elsewhere, on ""The Great God Pan Is Dead"" a muted choir sings wide syllables over an unobtrusive string accompaniment. Their utterances, shapeless at first, coalesce into the words ""Pan Is Dead"" by the track's end, lending the piece a soft mysticism. ""Chimaerica"" hovers around a lonely organ, providing both a sense of the gothic and one of Fordlândia's moments of true restraint. ""How We Left Fordlândia"" returns to Jóhansson's bread and butter, pounding out 15 minutes of spectral beauty and un-teasing melody. ""How We Left Fordlândia"" uncoils slower than either the title track or ""Fordlândia-- Aerial View"", serving as end-credits for an album on which almost every song could soundtrack a finale or a fadeout. As comfortable as Jóhannsson is working with his orchestra, Fordlândia's wisest moments are its smallest: the embers of ""Chimaerica"", the swamp-reeds of the interspersed ""Melodia"" pieces. By comparison, the ""Fordlândia"" trilogy is simultaneously skillful, gorgeous, and a bit too polished-- they're a pristine composition on a record full of them, but it doesn't gel with the messy, self-destructive historical footnotes that inspired them.","The second installment of a planned trilogy, Icelandic composer Jóhann Jóhannsson's new record is full of gorgeously sweeping strings aided by gently babbling electronics.

A Hundred Things Keep Me Up at Night,Love Is All,by: Stuart Berman,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bde0eb335119a49ecf7d/1:1/w_160/6bb9250c.jpg,2008-11-13 06:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12415-a-hundred-things-keep-me-up-at-night/,What's Your Rupture?,"There's a memorable scene in the otherwise unmemorable 1984 Steve Martin comedy The Lonely Guy where Martin's single-guy protagonist enters a posh restaurant and politely requests a table for one, only to have a spotlight follow him to his seat and illuminate his loserdom for a roomful of dumbstruck diners. As Josephine Olausson illustrates on the new Love Is All album, that feeling isn't exclusive to sad-sack middle-aged bachelors; you can be the cute, charismatic frontwoman for an internationally lauded Swedish indie band and not only feel intense loneliness, but feel like everyone around you is enjoying the sight of your loneliness. In other words, A Hundred Things Keep Me Up at Night is a logical sequel to her band's 2005 debut Nine Times That Same Song, wherein she follows the cycle of making out and falling out by talking us through the subsequent sadness of single life. Few bands are better at conveying that sense of feeling alone in the crowd, with Olausson's inner monologues fighting to be heard over the din of her band's sax-blasted garage-disco. Sonically speaking, A Hundred Things Keep Me Up at Night is a classic second album, in the tradition of the Clash's Give 'Em Enough Rope or the Strokes' Room on Fire: It may not deliver the same jolt as its predecessor, but its somewhat cleaner production highlights Love Is All's strengthened pop prowess. As predictable as that move may be, it wasn't entirely anticipated by the band's interim endeavors: Since the release of Nine Times, Love Is All have been eager to mess around with other peoples' songs (as heard on the tour-only Covers EP), or enlist other artists to mess with their own (the Mixed Up remix disc)-- both of which indicated a certain fatigue with their beserker-pop aesthetic. Olausson re-enforces that idea on ""Sea Sick"", the new album's most self-referential track, rehashing the theme and breakdown of the group's signature single ""Busy Doing Nothing"" while shouting, ""I'm bored to death of all this shit!""
 
But Love Is All have made progress, too, as charted in hyperactive garage-rockers like ""Movie Romance"", where Olausson's rant about bullshit big-screen depictions of love is lent a humorously self-deprecating context by the song's jittery, accelerated guitar riff; the desperation described on first single ""Wishing Well"" is likewise leavened by a zippy organ refrain lifted wholesale from the Clean's charming 1981 single ""Tally Ho!"" But even in the midst of such brazen thievery, Olausson's growth as a storyteller is undeniable. Where she once favored itemized phrases and staccato shrieks, her writing here offers richly detailed first-person vignettes that carefully straddle the line between self-absorbed and sympathetic; no doubt, the sleigh-belled disco of ""Last Choice""-- which suggests that any one-night stand is better than going home alone-- is perfectly timed for the coming season of regretful holiday-party hookups. Short of turning into the Swedish indie version of ""Sex and the City"", A Hundred Things Keep Me Up at Night's closing stretch emphasizes that the repercussions of sleeping in a perpetually empty bed are more psychological than physical, with Olaussen convincingly conveying the dangers of a mind left to wander. By the time we hit the twitchy punk rumble ""Big Bangs, Black Holes, Meteorites""-- just three of the insomnia-inducing phenomena accounted for in this album's title-- her frustration has given way to pure hypochondria and agoraphobia, while the equally manic and misanthropic closer ""19 Floors"" quantifies those anxieties in relation to her highrise living arrangement (""19 floors and a thousand doors, and one of them is mine, a million names don't seem the same""), as the song's strident anti-socialism (""I don't want to walk my neighbor's dog and I can't lend a cup of milk"") culminates in a sax-squawked flame-out. A Hundred Things Keep Me Up at Night may pick up where the band left off on Nine Times That Same Song, but by its conclusion, we see the band adopting a new self-defining philosophy: Hate is all.","Love Is All's second album is a logical sequel to 2005's debut Nine Times That Same Song, wherein the group follows the cycle of making out and falling out by talking us through the subsequent sadness of single life.

JJ Got Live RaTX,RTX,by: Stuart Berman,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bdd9ea9e61561daa77be/1:1/w_160/04acb305.jpg,2008-11-12 06:00:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12407-jj-got-live-ratx/,Drag City,"Jennifer Herrema's former band, Royal Trux, released their first album in 1988 at the height of the hair-metal era, and at the time, their brand of lo-fi blues-concréte couldn't have been further removed from prevailing, poofy-coiffed rock trends. But with each new album from Heremma's post-Trux outfit RTX, it becomes clearer that former partner Neil Hagerty-- now releasing increasingly inscrutable albums under the Howling Hex mantle-- was holding her back from her true calling of denim'n'leather metal queen. Where 2004's RTX debut Transmaniacon featured a handful of Trux rewrites and last year's Western Xterminator detoured into strung-out psych-folk, with JJ Got Live RaTX (actually a falsely advertised studio album), Herrema exorcises every last vestige of her former band's avant-rock influence and finally gets to enjoy the 1988 she never got to experience the first time around. But for Herrema, the real attraction to hair-metal isn't the panty-peeling riffs and wiggly fingered solos-- though those are in bountiful supply here-- but its androgynous implications. With her lean, statuesque physique and long blonde locks, no one is ever going to mistake Herrema for a guy, and yet, when she asks ""are you a boy, or are you a girl?"" on the track of the same name, you have to wonder if she's talking into a mirror, her gruff, three-cartons-a-day voice sounding several degrees more ballsy than those of the spandexed pansies who once populated ""Headbanger's Ball"". The irony of 80s cock-rock is that most of the dudes singing it sounded like they didn't have one, so leave it to a woman to correct that deficiency; with the talk-boxed strut of ""You Should Shut Up"" and the open-sunroof charge of ""How'd You Do It?""-- RTX's most straight-up, no-bullshit rocker to date-- Herrema embodies the kind of ultimate rock chick that a young Vince Neil or Axl Rose aspired to be when they were applying their eyeliner and hairspray. Where past RTX albums sometimes apologized for their heavy-metal love with deliberately messy production (as if still trying to appease Royal Trux's indie-centric fanbase), JJ Got Live RaTX unashamedly revels in authentically 80s details: The slowly swelling synth intro to ""You Should Shut Up"" that sounds like Giorgio Moroder's intro theme to Scarface; the squealing lead fills on ""Are You a Boy or Are You Girl"" that fly by like orange globulars on ""Guitar Hero""'s expert level; the crunchy-riffed break in the middle of ""Virginia Creeper"" lifted straight from Scorpions' ""No One Like You""; the brief, ZZ Top Eliminator-style techno-boogie denouement to ""Mr. Wall"" that's actually more interesting than the song that precedes it. RTX can't transcend all genre clichés-- namely, numbskull choruses (""Fuck that! We don't give a shit!"") and intentional typos (""Too Badd"")-- but they score where it counts: In the power-ballad department, though JJ Got Live RaTX's lone slow-dance moment, ""Cheap Wine Time"", is less ""Sweet Child O' Mine"" than ""Sweet Jane"" had the Velvet Underground been the house band at the Whisky in 88 instead of the Factory in 66.  In a sense, RTX's de-cheesing of 80s pop-metal couldn't better timed-- provided that disgruntled GN'R fans spend their Chinese Democracy refund money on this.","With JJ Got Live RaTX (actually a falsely advertised studio album), ex-Royal Trux woman Jennifer Herrema exorcises every last vestige of her former band's avant-rock influence and finally gets to enjoy the hair-metal 1988 she never got to experience the first time around.

Dark Developments,"Vic Chesnutt, Elf Power, and the Amorphous Strums",by: Stephen M. Deusner,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bdcfea9e61561daa77ad/1:1/w_160/3f719133.jpg,2008-11-12 06:00:04,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12396-dark-developments/,Orange Twin,"In the ever-shuffling deck that is the Athens music scene, this particular hand of cards was inevitable. In fact, it's a bit surprising it wasn't dealt sooner. Vic Chesnutt has been collaborating with anyone in earshot for nearly twenty years, Elf Power have deep tendrils in the local scene (the band's label is releasing this album), and the Amorphous Strums are, well, amorphous. The project, which involves a tour as well as this album, is meant as a sort of cooperative where everyone does the heavy lifting and everyone gets their names on the spine. Chesnutt gets first billing presumably because he wrote the songs, does most of the singing, and infuses every syllable with his usual skewed wit and gallows humor, but the other eight musicians pull their weight on the off-kilter jangle of these nine songs. These are very angry songs, as if the musicians' outrage has been festering for, say, eight years (just to grab a number out of the air). Dark Developments may not be intended to be an election-year album, but hearing it during an election year intensifies its power. That title specifically refers to overexposed dark-room prints, as Chesnutt makes clear on the creaky ""Stop the Horse"". Rather than toss the mistakes in the trash and start a new exposure, he keeps them all in a ledger he found in the trash, useless but artfully interesting. Similarly, this power nonet know that their frustrations with dark social and political developments may do little to change real-world problems, but work with the audacious hope that that it might fuel their music and lend weight to these dissenting songs. ""Little Fucker"" is a deliciously nasty send-off, presumably to the current administration, sharing its venomous sentiment with ""Teddy Bear"", which could be a celebration of January 20, 2009: ""He ain't ever comin' back!"" the gang all sing jubilantly. As on Chesnutt's previous album, North Star Deserter, a sense of doom shoots through the songs, manifest in the Dutch political cartoon reproduced on the back of the CD packaging. If on that previous album Chesnutt had mixed emotions about the end of the world-- is it even worth saving?-- here he sounds a bit cheerier, thanks perhaps to the local setting (it was recorded in Athens rather than in Montreal) and the local friends. Whether out of despair or some sense of relief, these songs contain a great deal of humor, some of it topical and some of it likely inside jokes. ""Phil the Fiddler"" lists characters and their occupations-- ""Dick the butcher, Tom the bootblack, Ralph the collier""-- that takes on a strange force after the presidential debates, as if Richard Scarry were speechwriting for McCain-Palin. We even get the return of Chesnutt's mouth trumpet on ""We Are Mean"", a city/country contrast that puts the lie to certain beliefs about heartland America. ""In the city we are social, in the country we are mean,"" Chesnutt sings mischievously, and Elf Power and the Strums join him for the emphatic chorus: ""I declare that everywhere we are mean/ We are mean/ We are mean/ We are mean!"" As a backing mini-orchestra, Elf Power and the Strums may not be as inventive as Lambchop or as dark as Godspeed You! Black Emperor, but they give Chesnutt just want he needs: a relaxed and less rehearsed environment. But their imprint is all over the album. Opener ""Mystery"" has an almost ""Earth Angel"" vibe, thanks primarily to Derek Almstead's slow-dancing bass, which is a thoughtful melodic anchor throughout the album. ""Bilocating Dog"" sounds a gleefully strange as its title suggests, and the band explode the closing psychedelic jam of ""Phil the Fiddler"". Here's hoping this mass collaboration isn't a one-off project, as each party seems to invigorate the others. Either way, I know who I wish I'd watched the election night returns with.","An almost inevitable meeting of Athens, Ga., scene vets yields an album of songs-- written and sung by Chesnutt, though the stamp of other musicans is evident-- that cut the prevailing sense of doom with a mood of communal cheer.

Alpinisms,School of Seven Bells,by: Eric Harvey,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bdd2ea9e61561daa77b0/1:1/w_160/b26fabbe.jpg,2008-11-12 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12399-alpinisms/,Ghostly,"The debut LP from School of Seven Bells sounds like the result of meticulous labor, and by all accounts it is. Secret Machines' Benjamin Curtis met On!Air!Library!'s Alejandra and Claudia Deheza in late 2004 when their groups were opening for Interpol, and they embarked on an on-and-off collaboration over the next four years. EPs came out on Sonic Cathedral and Table of the Elements last year, and a remix of ""Iamundernodisguise"" was featured on Prefuse 73's Preparations. As for the full-length, Curtis told Pitchfork's Matthew Solarski that same year that it was in the middle of a lengthy production and revision process. The extra time was worth it.  Alpinisms retains distant echoes of the EPs, and vocal similarities to O!A!L! are inevitable, but in SVIIB’s freshest and best-yet iteration, Curtis has moved the band from downtown-arty to diaphonous, nestling the Dehezas' voices in a thick, glimmering haze.  The two released versions of ""Face to Face on High Places"" are the clearest chart for the band's evolution: The EP version, with the same melodic hook as its later incarnation, and some frenzied drumming by Rhys Chatham associate Joe Stickney, is certainly appealing in its own right.  It’s also nearly nine minutes long, vamping on its abrasive fire-dance rhythm for the last four. On Alpinisms, “Face” is focused and gleaming, the drums cycling like faraway pistons and the gossamer verse melody recalling My Bloody Valentine's ""Blown a Wish"". Like the rest of the album, ""Face"" revels in its artificiality, but in an uncanny way that works to heighten its foregrounded aura of mystery and mysticism. The other synthetic pleasure at work on Alpinisms is the way it hails and integrates its influences: Listen to the gothic shimmer of ""Connjur"" and ""My Cabal"", and try to avoid thinking of the icy soundscapes of Cocteau Twins' Heaven or Las Vegas (indeed, Robin Guthrie remixed ""My Cabal"" for the Sonic Cathedral 7"") and Flood's cavernous production on Depeche Mode's Violator*.* The record might be named for the most frigid of outdoor activities, but, like its most recognizable predecessors, Alpinisms thoroughly blurs the distinction between chilly and warm. Yet despite the band's modernist approach to emotions and sensations, their abstruse lyrics and spiritual overtones most directly recall John Lennon's late-1960s, post-India assimilation of the mundane with the mystical. On songs like ""I'm Only Sleeping"", ""Tomorrow Never Knows"", and ""I'm So Tired"", he used the liminal state between deep sleep and an Eastern-tinged state of full consciousness as a metaphor for wandering through life in a trance. The woozy chorus of SVIIB's single ""Half Asleep"" takes the same approach, making dream pop in the strictest sense: ""What begins as an unguarded train of thought slowly can become an addiction to the slumber of disconnection"". It looks wordy in print, but sounds effortless on record, the Dehezas' pristine voices elegantly negotiating a rising and falling cadence. On the album's longest and most ""Eastern"" song ""Sempiternal/Amaranth"", they get to the point more directly-- ""We walk around half-there all the time""-- before vamping for a few minutes on the lyric ""Allow yourself to be relieved"", or the new ""Turn off your mind, relax, and float downstream."" Throughout Alpinisms, the group finds a perfect middle ground between the indie realms of tribal and choral, layering electronic flourishes without letting them overwhelm the arrangements.  Opening track ""Iamundernodisguise"" accomplishes this most effectively, with the Dehezas' mantra-like vocals riding the thrumming groove of the verse, until the lyric ""my heart a drum of water"" propels the song into a wordless chorus. Alpinisms has its pitfalls: ""For Kalaja Mari"" and ""White Elephant Coat"", though not failures, combine mid-record to edge the record too closely to the New Age valley it so effectively skirts elsewhere. But at their best, School of Seven Bells know what they want to achieve, and do it gracefully and with style to spare. They supposedly took their name from a mysterious South American pickpocketing school, which trained its students by having them practice on mannequins equipped with bells-- one of them rings: the student fails. It's an effective metaphor for how SVIIB synthesizes its music: Carefully pulling from a myriad of sources (inspirational and instrumental), but doing so with cleverness that only comes from discipline and patience.","Secret Machines' Benjamin Curtis and On!Air!Library!'s Alejandra and Claudia Deheza have enjoyed an on-and-off collaboration for years, and it pays off on this album, full of synthetic pleasures and cavernous production.

Considering all his demons, is it any wonder that Greg Dulli keeps himself busy? Four albums with the Twilight Singers in six years, his ongoing collaboration with Mark Lanegan as the Gutter Twins, long days spent on the road and long nights spent on stage: post-Whigs, Dulli's been a pretty busy guy. Still, there are lulls, and those lulls must be filled. Last year, between a Twilight Singers tour and the Gutter Twins' debut, Dulli appeared at two benefit shows for the Vera Project, a Seattle music and arts center, performing mostly stipped-down versions of Twilight Singers songs. Of course, there's only so far down you can strip a personality as outsized as Dulli's, but the experiment did alter his usual context. Clearly Dulli thought something of the two nights as well, as now about a year later he's distilled the tapes to a solid digital-only live disc-- surprisingly, his first live record-- which captures him at a transitional but no less compelling stage. Right off the bat, ""The Killer"" shows off Dulli's formidable presence-- the performer's intense vocals alone nearly matching the song's studio bombast. The same goes for Dulli's rendition of ""Black Is the Color of My True Love's Hair"", which is less dense than the version found on the Twilight Singers' She Loves You but no less powerful for it-- especially once you factor in the creeping violin of guest Petra Haden. ""Candy Cane Crawl"", from Powder Burns, is Dulli at his dark best, while ""King Only"" is presented with a radically different arrangement that (by necessity) jettisons the skittering drums, horns and other atmospherics and (more impulsively) tags on a nod to Led Zeppelin's ""Babe I'm Gonna Leave You"". Dulli being Dulli, that's not the extent of the covers included here. Live at the Triple Door includes Dulli's first stab at Jóse González' ""Down the Line""-- now a live Dulli staple-- as well as a fusion of George Harrison's ""Isn't It a Pity"" with Donovan's ""Atlantis"". It also includes versions of ""Tonight"", from the Afghan Whigs' 1992 breakthrough Congregation, and ""Front Street"", subsequently recorded with the Gutter Twins. The addition of songs such as these lends the disc a truly archival quality, with Dulli straddling past and present while confidently peering ahead to the near future.","Recorded over two nights at a benefit for a Seattle music and arts center, this set of mostly stripped-down Twilight Singers is now available as a digital exclusive.

Berlin: Live At St. Ann's Warehouse,Lou Reed,by: Zach Baron,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bdcac0084474cd0c2d97/1:1/w_160/baa08a9d.jpg,2008-11-12 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12391-berlin-live-at-st-anns-warehouse/,Matador,"Lou Reed's Berlin was released in 1973, just after Transformer and just before Sally Can't Dance, two records that to this day remain Reed's most commercially successful. Berlin's legend of failure was born almost immediately (Rolling Stone: ""There are certain records that are so patently offensive that one wishes to take some kind of physical vengeance on the artists that perpetrate them""; Robert Christgau: ""Will Lou lick the bloomin' boots of 'im that's got it?""). Even Metal Machine Music, released two years later, wouldn't be enough to cleanse the general antagonistic shock of what people at the time took to be Reed's worst album, ever. Still, in retrospect, it's a funny album to pick on. A loose song cycle (it turned out that many of the Berlin tracks actually dated back to Reed's days in the Velvet Underground, and ""Berlin"" was a song on Reed's first album) about an unhappy couple, Jim and Caroline, living in the titular city, the record's absurdly depressing but hardly offensive. The characters do drugs, domestic violence, custody battles; eventually, Caroline kills herself. Berlin ends with Jim idly staring at a photograph of the dead mother of his children. Bob Ezrin, who would soon produce Pink Floyd's The Wall and who, at 23, had already produced Alice Cooper, brought a characteristically lush orchestration to the proceedings, but then again, Berlin was clearly a melodrama. Ezrin and Reed had their eyes on a stage adaptation before the record even came out; Berlin's reviews (and sales numbers) ended that project. To listen to Berlin now is to be basically mystified as to what everyone was so upset about, besides maybe its lack of a ""Walk on the Wild Side Pt. II"". Reed shrugged it off, and went on to do things worthy of his audience's newfound hatred. Berlin, meanwhile, crept back into style. By the 1980s, Julian Schnabel was getting divorced to it, and by December 2006, the collective entreaties of various arts luminaries around New York finally led Reed to revive his second-most reviled creation for a four-night run at Brooklyn's St. Ann's Warehouse. Ezrin was back, to conduct; Sharon Jones, Antony Hegarty, and the entire Brooklyn Youth Chorus were on hand to provide backing vocals. Schnabel designed the set, and his daughter made a film to be projected against the back of it. The event was stoked by adulatory, apocalyptic press coverage (""Sometimes called the most depressing album ever made…"" began one The New York Times paragraph) and an improbably beautiful week of melancholy, late fall weather. I attended on the year's last non-holiday Sunday. The mood, of course, was reverent, but what I remember best were the evening's various breaks in character: Reed finishing a guitar solo and sighing into the mic, ""Oh, back into the land of depression now""; Ezrin, ecstatic by the post-concert exit, excitedly calling Berlin ""music to cut your wrists by"" even as he couldn't stop grinning. Applause all around. This past July, Schnabel brought out a film of the performances and now, a tidy two years after the concerts, Matador's releasing the soundtrack, officially making a one time 21st Century revival of a 1973 rehabbed classic into a modest cottage industry. Berlin, the original, is a wonderfully claustrophobic, textured, and wandering suite of unwaveringly dark songs. It has an indelible arc-- from the muted ""Berlin"", through the false dawn of ""Caroline Says Pt II"", all the way to the all-time underrated ""Sad Song"", which is simultaneously one of the most overblown and most moving songs Reed ever wrote. (Ezrin's hand is, uh, visible: ""Sad Song"" is a sublimely bastardized Pink Floyd song, from the psych solos to the children's chorus at the end, and not the least bit worse for it.) At a trim 10 songs, Berlin casts an undeniable spell: a tiny poison pill, a maudlin little melodrama. Berlin, the musical/film soundtrack/live album, occupies perhaps an even more specialized niche: a time capsule of a time capsule, a memory engine for those who were there, a document of four woozy nights of goodwill, friendship, and adulation. The undeniable truth about the Berlin performances were that they were fundamentally celebratory-- Reed had fun, Ezrin, Antony, Jones, and the kids had fun, and the audience, as telegraphed by this recording's roaring approval and reverent silences, definitely had fun. The cameos, minimal during the performance, are barely audible here: Sharon Jones battling Reed on ""Oh, Jim""; Antony warbling backups on ""Caroline Says, Pt. II""; blistering guitar solos from Steve Hunter, who joined Ezrin as the other veteran of the original Berlin sessions, on nearly every song. Reed's line readings aren't sarcastic, but they are crooked-- like every ""Don't Look Back""-type performance I've seen in the past few years, it's obvious even as Reed's enjoying the ceremony he's trying to dodge the predictability that comes from playing an old album, in full, without deviation. There are some uniquely embarrassing moments, too: the exceptionally ecstatic audience surge that goes up at the intro to ""How Do You Think It Feels"" is almost definitely the sound of 800 or so people thinking they're about to hear ""Walk on the Wild Side"", which starts in more or less the same way. Alas, that one was not to be. Reed speeds through ""Candy Says"" (or rather, Antony does), ""Rock Minuet"", and ""Sweet Jane"", and then, exeunt. It's exhilarating to hear Berlin back and alive, but then again, it was more exhilarating to see it back and alive: an option now available to whoever cares to pick up Schnabel's DVD. It's a miracle Reed was able to turn one of the most hermetic albums of all time into a communal experience, but Live at St. Ann's was also a one-time-only slight of hand: Berlin will forever be a record best enjoyed alone.","Lou Reed and Berlin producer Bob Ezrin always had their eyes on a stage adaptation of this narrative; in 2006, that finally became a reality, with appearances by Sharon Jones and Antony Hegarty. This is the soundtrack to a Julian Schnabel film about those performances.

Who Killed Harry Houdini?,I'm From Barcelona,by: Marc Hogan,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Senior Staff Writer</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bde1eb335119a49ecf82/1:1/w_160/5b0221b9.jpg,2008-11-11 06:00:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12416-who-killed-harry-houdini/,Mute,"Bands the size of football teams aren't made to last. They're hard to organize, hard to pack into the basement at Cake Shop, hard to pay-- usually have a lot of friends and family to draw to shows, though. Indie rock's most widely known symphonic-pop chorale, the Polyphonic Spree, started making their joyful noise eight years and three albums ago now, but those white-robed masses surrounding ex-Tripping Daisy frontman Tim DeLaughter have varied over time. Another venerable mega-group, Danielson Famile, have the advantage of being a Famile (the Famile that plays together, stays together). Broken Social Scene members keep putting out solo albums. The stark odds against super-sizing your band can make the venture an ideal one if you're the type looking to escape the gray practicalities of adulthood. Community was built into the songs on Swedish pop collective I'm From Barcelona's 2006 full-length debut, Let Me Introduce My Friends; underground hit ""We're From Barcelona"" and its endearing YouTube clip implied a global village-- or at least a Coca-Cola commercial. Somehow, the 20-plus-member group managed to coordinate their calendars and come to North America for a handful of much-praised U.S. shows. Even if I'm From Barcelona had been a quartet, their songs are designed for many voices. Their second album, Who Killed Harry Houdini?, asks a question laid out in 2006 biography The Secret Life of Houdini: The Making of America's First Superhero. The book suggests the master magician and escape artist was poisoned, rather than killed by a ruptured appendix (likely cause: punches to the stomach by a McGill student, trying to test Houdini's vaunted strength). Houdini sounds like an attempt to escape from the predicament of the sophomore album, making more nuanced use of orchestration and sticking with a comfortingly sweet and naïve tone while also expanding its perspective. March-like first single ""Paper Planes"" has sunny guitars, whistling woodwinds, neighbors' sex, and ""The Cosby Show"", slyly invoking the way we pass unseen through the lives of strangers; free mp3 giveaway ""Music Killed Me"" adds a kiddie-psych spaceyness, using the choral vocal to full rhetorical advantage. ""Andy"" politely invites a guy-- with the same name as one of my local bartenders!-- to join the band. But nothing here has the euphoric simplicity of ""We're From Barcelona"", or quite the infant-""Calvin & Hobbes"" wisdom of ""Chicken Pox"" and ""Treehouse"". If a second album is tough, try a second childhood. Yup, there's a lullaby, the sentimental but meandering ""Gunhild""; a banjo and synth twee-pop meditation about floating away between ""Headphones""; a catchy minor-key Casper cartoon that develops into a musing on mortality, ""Little Ghost""; a light ditty about ""Ophelia"" driving away in one of her two cars; and ""Houdini"", a clambering power-popper about magic powers, with an almost-spoken melody that reminds me of Snow Patrol's ""How to Be Dead"". The emotional guts of the album, though, are in the upbeat ""Mingus"", which expresses a fear of growing up that recalls but doesn't rival Ben Folds' ""Still Fighting It"". The flawed but winsome finale, ""Rufus"", envisions a giant silver labrador in a wide-open golden valley of crowd-handclapping twee-rock ""Bohemian Rhapsody"". And in the final line, frontman Emanuel Lundgren-- whose name is similar to Manuel, the ""Fawlty Towers"" character from whom I'm From Barcelona take their name-- sings, ever so softly: ""In my heart, I'm still a kid."" As Momus once said of childhood, ""It's an invention of adults."" The Boy Least Likely To's fantastic 2005 debut album will be a tough act to follow, too-- and they're only a duo.","Making more nuanced use of orchestration and sticking with a comfortingly sweet and naïve tone, this ginormous Swedish group attempts to avoid a sophomore slump.

Twilight of the Thunder God,Amon Amarth,by: Cosmo Lee,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bdcc5e6ef95969323133/1:1/w_160/20ab381a.jpg,2008-11-11 06:00:04,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12393-twilight-of-the-thunder-god/,Metal Blade,"Amon Amarth come advertised as ""viking metal,"" an interesting proposition in 2008. The Stockholm band, which takes its name from Tolkien, certainly has the right trappings. Their songs are about vikings. Their album covers overflow with swords, shields, and he-men. Live, they don drinking horns and make sure to toast the crowd: ""Skål!"" But beneath their imposing beards lie men of the 21st century. Their ineptitude with charcoal grills is well-documented. Their albums are made with axes-- the six-string kind-- through the latest in recording technology. Vocalist Johan Hegg proudly told me about how he once parallel-parked the band's van and trailer in Manhattan. But even without the traditional instruments used by other viking metal bands, Amon Amarth amply convey ""vikingness."" The secret lies in their melodies. They're strong, simple, and often romantic. Amon Amarth songs are instantly recognizable, a feat for a band whose singer favors a one-note growl. Early efforts were raw and dark, reflecting origins in straight-ahead death metal. Over time, the band's rhythm section grew sturdier, as did its songs. Since 2002's Versus the World, Amon Amarth's sound has solidified around several core elements: basic riffs, memorable melodies, and Hegg's voice, which is somehow deeply expressive. Twilight of the Thunder God merely refines these elements, but the tune-up is noticeable. In a discography filled with catchy songs, these are some of Amon Amarth's catchiest. The band has stripped things down to bare essentials, all of which advance the cause of creating tunes that stick in one's head. (Fredrik Andersson still has a charming tendency to overplay bass drums, however.) The efficiency here approaches that of pop music. ""Twilight of the Thunder God"" is a barreling anthem about Thor (natch), ""Where Is Your God?"" is a barreling anthem about defeating the enemy (again, natch), and ""No Fear for the Setting Sun"" is yet another barreling anthem about battle. But the band switches speeds enough to prevent monotony. The driving pulse of ""Free Will Sacrifice"" evokes a down-tuned Judas Priest; ""Guardians of Asgaard"" is a mid-paced march with a surprisingly tender solo. Though Amon Amarth sometimes get tagged as ""death metal,"" that's not really accurate. Some of their riffs recall the sturm und drang of early Swedish death metal, and Hegg's vocal approach is pure death metal. But the band's sound is rather uplifting. Even its songs about death are stirring-- think Valhalla, not hell. (""Runes to My Memory"", from 2006's With Oden on Our Side, is a downright tender ode to imminent death.) This spirit is probably what has enabled Amon Amarth to amass an astoundingly loyal following. At a recent sold-out show at New York's Irving Plaza, the band had a 1,000-strong crowd singing along. To see men, women, metalheads, and Wall Street types, young and old, chanting, ""Oden! Guide our ships!"" was quite heartwarming.","Their album covers overflow with swords, shields, and he-men, and they've been known to don drinking horns and offer a toast to live crowds, but the most ""viking"" aspect of these Swedish metalers could be their strong, simple, and often romantic melodies.

With Blasphemy So Heartfelt,Jessica Lea Mayfield,by: Stephen M. Deusner,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bdd1c0084474cd0c2da8/1:1/w_160/abe924e7.jpg,2008-11-11 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12398-with-blasphemy-so-heartfelt/,Polymer,"Jessica Lea Mayfield sings with a drawl that goes slightly flat when she sustains notes and gives certain words the semblance of regional color. It could be a personal characteristic of her downcast voice, or perhaps a nod to her Rust Belt upbringing, but the 19-year-old singer/songwriter, who recorded her 2007 debut under the name Chittlin', sounds immediately distinctive and poised on ""Kiss Me Again"", the opening track on her second album, With Blasphemy So Heartfelt, calling to mind but ultimately surpassing comparisons to Hope Sandoval or Syd Straw. ""You can kiss me again if you want, I don't mind,"" she sings, yet she sounds actively invested in her romantic passivity-- a fascinating and endlessly listenable contradiction. Blasphemy was produced by fellow Ohioan Dan Auerbach, who corralled Mayfield into singing on the Black Keys' Attack & Release earlier this year. Here he swathes her vocals in dreamy country production, heavy on rumbling guitar and even heavier on atmospherics that give her songs a vinyl noir feel that's more Brick than Double Indemnity. His slurring riffs illuminate the inner turmoil of ""I Can't Lie to You, Love"", and a banjo adds spikes to ""We've Never Lied"" as Mayfield sings, ""I'll talk to whoever I goddamn wanna."" Her quavering vocals are textured in reverb, as if to suggest that her lyrics are inner monologues resounding in her love-fevered brain. Emphasizing the physical-- breath on neck, hand clasping hand, lips against lips-- her lyrics suggest a world where kisses can still pack contradictions and lying is an everyday occurrence, and her subtly dramatic vocals bring that world to life. As jaded and adult as she comes across on ""Call Me"" and ""Bible Days"", Mayfield still sounds like she's describing the tribulations of young love, although that assertion may be due to her age prompting preconceptions in the listener. Still, concrete descriptions like ""I was walking with your left hand in my back pocket"" (from the lilting, resigned ""For Today"") sound like she's singing for all the Lindsay Weirs of the world. Noting Mayfield's age shouldn't suggest she has little authority beyond the late-teen set. Just the opposite: The relationships she describes on Blasphemy are supremely dark and compromised-- not sweet but scarred. On ""The One That I Love Best"", as Auerbach churns out a thundery riff, she yearns for the guy who's ""my first thought in the morning,"" but then she mentions he's also ""the reason that I cry myself to sleep."" It's these complexities and contradictions that make Blasphemy more than just a collection of conflicted love songs, as in total they cohere into a strong statement of identity by a woman who is finding out that she might just be ""happier when I'm alone.""","After singing on the latest Black Keys record, 19-year-old singer/songwriter Jessica Lea Mayfield crafts a bootgazing record about romantic passivity that's bathed in dreamy country production.

There’s Me and There’s You,The Matthew Herbert Big Band,by: Mark Pytlik,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bde213d197565213b641/1:1/w_160/051bc4ef.jpg,2008-11-11 06:00:02,Jazz,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12417-theres-me-and-theres-you/,!K7,"Even if you've never heard Matthew Herbert's music, it's still quite possible you know how he makes it. For more than a decade, the British producer has made sample-driven house music that has elevated the concept of musique concrète (the fetishization of found sounds) into a storytelling platform. Where early composers Pierre Schaeffer and Edgar Varése sampled their surroundings-- often indiscriminately-- out of a sense of curiosity and playfulness, Herbert has turned the physical act of sampling itself into part of the text. 2005's food industry-themed Plat du Jour, for example, included samples of 3,255 people biting into an apple, chopsticks drumming on egg cups, and someone blowing over the top of a bottle of San Pellegrino. This kind of sampling isn't merely a spice in Herbert's work; it's the basis for it. Any given album might feature hundreds of similarly interesting footnotes, many of which are rooted in larger cultural memes or personal anecdotes. As you might imagine, it's become nearly impossible to listen to Herbert's music without some sort of accompanying crib sheet for context. Correspondingly, it's become increasingly difficult to extract the novelty of his process from the quality of his output. Might you enjoy this album's ""One Life"" a little bit less had you not known that it sampled the incubator that kept Herbert's son alive for two months? By being his most musically inferior album in a long time, these are the kinds of questions that There's Me and There's You forces on the listener. This is the second album from Herbert's Big Band outfit, and while the handle implies an aesthetic shift from electronic music to avant-jazz, the effect isn't as pronounced as it reads on paper-- Herbert's always mined from both genres regardless of his moniker. As with Plat du Jour and 2006's terrific Scale, it's also a protest album: his original concept was to record it entirely out of sounds sampled inside Britain's House of Parliament, a request which the government eventually denied. His frustration at that denial has manifested in songs with stronger, more overtly global and political themes than before; each beep in the aforementioned ""One Life"" represents 100 deaths resulting from the Iraq War; ""The Story"" features the rustling and crinkling of select British broadsheets and glossy celeb-obsessed tabloids; ""The Yessness"" features snippets from 100 figures of power saying the y-word, and, perhaps most notably, ""Knowing"" is a social experiment that finds 100 volunteers from around the world (of which, full disclosure, this writer is one, even if I can't figure out which ""you"" is mine) each contributing one word to the song's snaking melody. So yeah, the tricks are clever; unfortunately, musically, There's Me... is an overstuffed mess. Its songs aren't compositions so much as overlong, hypercaffeinated patchworks of disparate vocal vamps, noxious brass motifs, and uncharacteristically obnoxious asides. Herbert's collaborations often hinge on his vocalists, and in that department, even though he's often veered dangerously close towards adult contemporary sensibilities, he's generally shown a taste for singers with subtle, light inflections. There's Me... finds him working for the first time with Zimbabwe-born Eska Mtungwazi, a vocalist whose range, while impressive, makes no allowances for subtlety. Songs like ""Pontificate"", ""Waiting"", ""The Yessness"", and ""Breathe"" (none of them great shakes to begin with) are overwhelmed by her spotlight-seeking mannerisms. She squeaks, whispers, bleats, purrs, and over-emotes in perfect synchronicity with the music's many needless hairpin turns; it's all pretty much as tiring and joyless as it sounds. On paper, Herbert's sampling exercises read as thoughtful and as antagonistic as ever (one track features volunteers dispensing Britney Spears' noxious ""Curious"" fragrance throughout the halls of the British Museum). Without the music to support them, though, they end up feeling more like stunts, supplementary rather than complementary. Lots has been written about Herbert's elevation of process, particularly as it pertains to electronic music, and when it's all said and done, he's probably going to go down as one of sample-based music's most interesting and innovative thinkers, but There's Me... is a sign that he's overcorrected a bit too hard in that direction. This was probably a hugely satisfying record for him to make; it's a shame it's not nearly as much fun to listen to.","The second album from Matthew Herbert's Big Band outfit; as the handle implies, there's an aesthetic shift from electronic music to avant-jazz at play here, but these are also songs with stronger, more overtly global and political themes than he's ever explored before.

The Renaissance,Q-Tip,by: Nate Patrin,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bdddea9e61561daa77cb/1:1/w_160/5abd4abe.jpg,2008-11-11 06:00:01,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12413-the-renaissance/,Interscope,"1999 seems like a lifetime ago: Clinton was still President, DMX was popular, Ghostface Killah only had one solo album, and you could still listen to Biggie's ""blow up like the World Trade"" line in ""Juicy"" without cringing. Maybe you'll also remember it as the year A Tribe Called Quest's Q-Tip came out with his solo debut, Amplified, which pushed his bohemian rap a bit further upscale into champagne sleekness and drew a lot of ""pop sellout"" accusations from people who'd eventually wind up mourning co-producer J Dilla six and a half years later. Still, Amplified has aged pretty damn well, as predicted by Kris Ex, whose prescient Rolling Stone review called it ""music that's gonna represent laid-back hip-hop two minutes into the future."" But that's been damn near it from Tip on the new-release front. 2002's Kamaal the Abstract was a drastic 180 from Amplified's conscious-player style towards neo-soul/jazz fusion light on actual rapping, and Arista thought it was too leftfield to release-- one year before they let André 3000's half of the new OutKast album drop the same M.O. onto an unsuspecting world. A couple of years later, Tip put together a more cohesive, head-nod-worthy return to lyricism, Open, that Arista didn't ""get"" either-- so he shopped it to Universal/Motown, reconfigured it as Relive the Moment and later Live at the Renaissance, and saw that get shelved, too (though a number of promos were pressed and shipped in 2006). It was about that time that A Tribe Called Quest held some much-geeked-over reunion shows, which meant that the idea of Q-Tip as a solo artist went on the back burner. And so it's after that ridiculously long and convoluted voyage that I'm happy to declare The Renaissance-- a mostly new, tight refining of everything Q-Tip's done in his attempts to break his solo sophomore jinx-- the album people were spending the last nine years hoping he'd make. It features the deep, smooth neo-soul-tinged production from Amplified and final Tribe record The Love Movement (complete with a post-mortem Dilla contribution for a bit of that Ummah feel), pushes it simultaneously outwards towards both classic boom-bap and fusion experimentalism, and signals a welcome return of that familiar elastic, swing-cadence voice dropping jewels on the mic. Maybe the first thing you'll notice is the mood: Q-Tip sounds enthusiastic and vibrant where many other aging conscious rappers have been playing it tense or guarded. This album shows a man infatuated with love and life without sounding maudlin: ""Gettin' Up"", produced by Q-Tip, takes an old early 1970s Black Ivory single, makes it gleam with modern sheen and lets Tip loose on the kind of love jones you'd expect from a man with 15 years' worth of relationship experience and maturation since ""Electric Relaxation"". The love-and-war soldier's story ""We Fight/We Love"" and the abstract sociological breakdown of ""Manwomanboogie"" couch things in conflict and struggle, but there's always some glimmer of hope and humanity at the core. He even sounds diplomatic when he's being accusatory and frustrated with a lover, as he does on ""You"": Despite the communication breakdowns, suspicion of infidelity, and admission that all the blame rests on the other party, he still concludes it with a potential reconciliatory gesture: ""We'll make amends if you admit it/ We can ascend if you're committed/ Your heart, is it in it?"" And when he extends that gratitude and love towards his profession, modestly reaffirming his place in hip-hop in ""Johnny Is Dead"" or rattling off a catchy chronological list of legends in ""Life Is Better"", his passion is infectious. Most of The Renaissance's appeal owes to its mellow, welcoming tone-- maybe a bit more aspiring-Stevie than fist-pumping ""Scenario""-memorizers might prefer-- but its production has a lot of kick to it: There's a sly reworking of Can's jittery, restless Krautfunk song ""Aspectacle"" in ""Manwomanboogie"", a classic-style no-nonsense butt-moving soul jazz groove in ""Official"", propulsive funk fusion guitar riffs on ""Johnny Is Dead"", and rave synths on ""Shaka"" that sound like Kanye's ""Flashing Lights"" switched from wistful to triumphant. And the Abstract still knows how to amp a listener up on the mic, too. ""Dance on Glass"" is the lyrical highlight of the album: it starts out with an unaccompanied verse that addresses the whole state-of-rap argument with a veteran's wisdom, but Tip keeps going a cappella for an entire minute, dropping lyric after acrobatic lyric in his bouncy voice, building tension to the point where you're split between anticipation for the beat to drop and the feeling you wouldn't mind if it never did. (Then the beat does drop, and it sounds like People's Instinctive Travels... deep cut ""Rhythm (Devoted to the Art of Moving Butts)"" gone space-age. That works.) There's also the two-part ""Move"", produced by Dilla, which has an agitated Tip bucking the industry and calling out ""cold grits without the hot sauce"" MCs over a hacked-up, downpitched chunk of the Jackson 5's ""Dancing Machine"" before settling down just enough to drop life-story knowledge over whirring Moogs and concrete funk breaks. If there's any weakness to the album, it's that Tip spends a fair amount of time on hook duty-- at least when he's not relinquishing it to a silky Raphael Saadiq, a ghostly-sounding D'Angelo, or a just-there Norah Jones. And even if his voice is a welcome presence after all these years, it's a bit odd to hear a Q-Tip album where he's literally the only dude rapping on it. But it's hard to complain too much about such a brighter-day kind of record, and it feels like the perfect album at the perfect time-- released on Election Day, appropriately enough, as the ideal soundtrack for Barack Obama winning the presidency. It says a lot that Tip alludes to Midnight Marauders more than once and, rather than a cheap reminder of what used to be, he leaves you glad he's still holding that same spirit.","After a ridiculously long and convoluted voyage, the former Tribe MC finally releases his first solo album in nine years-- and it's a tight refining of both classic boom-bap and fusion experimentalism.

Presents: Skull Gang Takeover,Juelz Santana,by: Ian Cohen,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bdd013d197565213b615/1:1/w_160/5208abd8.jpg,2008-11-10 06:00:05,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12397-presents-skull-gang-takeover/,Datpiff.com,"Despite its supposedly lightweight origins, Juelz Santana Presents: Skull Gang Takeover is a depressing listen for the many Dipset foot soliders who've spent untold man hours (no homo) longing for a resurrection of their purple reign. Among the first words on the intro are ""Dipset for life,"" which Santana proceeds to back up by starting an entirely new collective with dudes that will ring bells to the diehards: Un Kasa, Jim Jones... come to think of it, pretty much everyone except Cam'ron. A large part of Dipset's appeal stemmed from their ability to deadpan through every ridiculous stunt they ever pulled, and the same suspension of disbelief applies to Skull Gang. Throughout the hour-plus runtime, they conduct their sexcapades in half-million-dollar condos, haters whittle the day away opining about Skull Gang (""Who Said That Skit"" is a must-hear), hooks are built off sentiments like ""I'll kill a nigga for my chai-yeen"" delivered T-Pain-style, and Young Jeezy's The Recession is seen as trenchant political commentary. Moreover, the album assumes that there's a sector of hip-hop listeners that thought Cam'ron's Killa Season was too cerebral and uplifting-- or at least that some will cop this because Santana learned how to use Auto-Tune. There's even something called ""Shorty Dirt Bike Skit"" on it (lasting all of four seconds). Apparently, an integral part of growing up is having the realization that skulls aren't that cool, and following that, there's a clear lean towards naughty locker room talk-- just about any time you hear a woman's voice or a woman being addressed on the record, you'll probably feel bad for her. That goes for the remake of Case's mahogany slow grind ""Touch Me Tease Me"", in which the female vocal begs for her hair to be pulled in between compliments about ""smell[ing] sweeter than a daffodil"" (rhymes with a certain hygiene product) and boasts about ""your insides squishin' like a Hot Pocket."" Same for the fake Ciara trying to sell ""Body Like a Maserati"" and its confusing metaphor about speeding tickets. If there's anything that makes it abundantly clear that Dipset are spirited if not a little misguided, ""Electric Relax"" becomes a blowjob tutorial, but I guess that's closer to its original intent than ""Peepin' My Swag"", which flips the bareknuckled grime of ""Uptown Anthem"" into a tribute about proper accessorizing. Even if reviewers are the only people to listen to this straight through, there's still plenty to enjoy-- ""Drama Fold"" sets the bar terribly high for Skull Gang's hilarious ignorance, as does the silly ""Got Money"" redux ""What You Reppin' (Skull Gang)"". Most of it involves Juelz growing into a lead role (""Tony Danza, look who's the boss""), and whether it's due to the fact that he's the most recognizable voice of the team or that he's just that much more skilled, he effortlessly steals any track he's on. It's tough to say whether this is some new beginning for Juelz, as since at least 2005 his entrée into pop's landscape has been through an open seat at the coke-rap table-- if Skull Gang is infinitely more tangible than the ever-postponed I Can't Feel My Face tape with Lil Wayne, it's about a fraction as anticipated. The evidence is in the perfectly competent gun-clappers like ""Aggy"", lofted by a simmering sax loop, and ""Problems"", which manages to be a decent ""message"" song. But Juelz always boasts that it's more than music, and although Skull Gang have an admirable chemistry, they hew far too close to the scads of NYC mixtape lurkers to which Dipset once proved to be a far more excitable alternative.","The new mixtape from Dipset member Juelz Santana and his Skull Gang crew assumes that there's a sector of hip-hop listeners that thought Cam'ron's Killa Season was too cerebral and uplifting.

Xs on Your Eyes,+/-,by: Kasia Galazka,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bdcdabf31b7dc715601d/1:1/w_160/336e3f24.jpg,2008-11-10 06:00:04,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12394-xs-on-your-eyes/,Absolutely Kosher,"+/- really had inertia on their side. Their last album, Let's Build a Fire, gently suggested tomfoolery with its jack-in-the-box title track opener and the Postal Service-tinged ""Steal the Blueprints""-- the lovely, inspiring highlight that began with a simple ""Hey"". The band was just starting to sweeten their electronic pop with little creative inklings. Alas, their latest album, Xs on Your Eyes, is calmer, but with no surprises. And unless I'm a weary parent, that's a crank I'm not too keen on turning. Some of the same Fire elements are here: horns, classical guitar, pedal steel. But gone are the trumpets' screeches and full-fledged commands to burn away the past. Where Fire was bright-eyed, Eyes is bloodshot from a serial-sneezing fit caused by its own emotional dust bowl. The last time I heard about chalk outlines (""You'll Catch Your Death""), sedation (""Xs on Your Eyes""), and potential you'll never see (""Unsung""), I was on an Elliott Smith binge one rainy day ago. But the gloomy vibe that permeates here has no real force. With songwriting duties split between primary songwriter James Baluyut and Patrick Ramos, it's hard to imagine why the album feels just so damn bleak. Certainly the trio has been celebrating these past couple of years: Ramos had twins at the end of that year, Baluyut joined the fatherhood club last year, and drummer Chris Deaner filled in as Kelly Clarkson's drummer on her tour. But I'm guessing the recent procreation explains the unyielding, more ""mature"" hush that pervades the album. Opener ""Tired Eyes"" starts the album off well enough. It begins with a dreamy vibraphone, then bursts and abruptly takes off before working its way back into its tinkling intro. The jolt is a neat trick, particularly if the listener has turned up the song because she couldn't hear it too well, but the subsequent build and retreat gets boring fast and slips into the background. ""Snowblind"", the album's first single, has a thin intro that builds and wanes, giving way to ""Subdued""'s flimsy falsetto one-word chorus, which warm guitar strums and some confident drums carry and save. These decent spots come early, and then the album starts to putter halfway through, until ""Marina"" invites back the pedal steel for some welcomed variation. The bouncy title track ends the album with what sounds like a Death Cab-circa-Something About Airplanes B-side. There's nothing startling about Eyes, no loving slap of surprise. It might be a lot to ask of an electro-acoustic pop band, but after Fire, I expected their streamlined velocity to make their follow-up fun. +/- fans may very well adore the ebbs, wanes, and occasional flatlines, but from a band ensconced in the Google unsearchable elite, I demand more whimsical mischief.","Brooklyn band with chamber-pop inclinations combines horns, classical guitar, and pedal steel on songs with deceptively dark overtones.

Ode to J. Smith,Travis,by: Ian Cohen,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bddbeb335119a49ecf76/1:1/w_160/11dc0221.jpg,2008-11-10 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12410-ode-to-j-smith/,Red Telephone Box,"Dropping two albums in as many years isn't the industrious workload it used to be, but then again, it's a refreshing show of vigor for a band that didn't look like it was going to make it past 2003. The underrated but undeniably sullen 12 Memories documented Travis wrestling with capital-I issues personal and political, both which could be were manifested in Fran Healey's decision to wear a beret. But last year, the foursome wisely eschewed Anton Corbijn's artwork and video direction and welcomed Nigel Godrich (and their old font) back into the fold with a comeback-via-throwback, and the warm reception of The Boy With No Name likely has inspired Travis to go back even further into their history with its quick follow-up-- namely, the first song on their first record: ""All I Wanna Do Is Rock"". And while Ode to J. Smith was probably the most fun record for the band to make since Good Feeling, it's also the worst one since then-- and its problems are almost exactly the same. Travis aren't the kind of band you spend a lot of time trying to wrap your mindgrapes around (""If we turn/ We might learn/ Learn to turn"") and they don't hit at a gut level viscerally. Their best songs tend to go for the spaces in between, the heart, the lump in your throat. Or, more succinctly, Travis don't rock, which is why all the newfangled additions, the edgeless distortion and feedback, the aggressive lyrical themes, the forceful vocal lines, the constipated boogie tempos that are supposed to justify the turgid melodies, are so easily peeled away to reveal sadly generic cores. If the retreat into simplicity is to be expected from a band that pretty much answers to itself at this point (J. Smith is the first release on their Red Telephone Box label), the decision to self-produce follows as well, but what Godrich understood is that Travis does wide-screen better than high-rise, and as such, a lot of the more immediate songs buckle under the weight of failed experimentation. ""Get Up"" and ""Something Anything"" feature Healey retreating from the painfully overt politicking of 12 Memories, pining for a general faith and assertiveness, but they come off more as mere sketched vehicles for clicky desktop drumming and an out-of-nowhere Slash turn, respectively. At least the latter has a hook that could've been a contender if it didn't wear out its welcome. And then there's first single ""J. Smith"", which is emblematic of where the record fails: It so obviously wants to be the biggest thing Travis has ever done, tacking on piercing guitar bends and an Arcade Fire choir, and each new trick is stitched together by verses of dithering modesty. There are reasons the bands Travis seek to match often find themselves described as ""unapologetic."" I suppose it's defeatist to use The Man Who as a comparison-- especially since Travis went so obviously out of their way to make J. Smith sound nothing like it. But trying to forge a new identity doesn't necessarily mean working against your strengths: It's no shock that the most memorable tune here, ""Quite Free"", features a longing ""Knives Out"" vocal line. It's understandable that these guys are seeking an escape hatch from competing with Keane, Snow Patrol, and Coldplay, considering that they've spent the past seven years making writers rue those ""next Radiohead!"" plaudits. But one Stereophonics is more than enough.","After the comeback-via-throwback of The Boy With No Name, Travis go back even further into their history with its quick follow-up-- namely, to the first song on their first record: ""All I Wanna Do Is Rock"".

Reefer,Reefer,by: Rebecca Raber,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bddac0084474cd0c2db5/1:1/w_160/bd10e8bc.jpg,2008-11-10 06:00:02,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12408-reefer/,Alpha Pup,"After five years and as many bands, we know two things for certain about Nick Thorburn: 1) Dude likes to stay busy, and 2) He loves islands. It is in service of both of those quirks that he presents his latest project, Reefer, a partnership with L.A. hip-hop producer Daddy Kev that resulted in a Maui-created, self-titled album. In a year in which Thorburn has already released two albums-- Islands' mediocre sophomore effort and the middling debut of folk duo Human Highway-- one must wonder if the prolific songwriter is spreading himself too thin. But Daddy Kev, who adds a sense of play with his cut-and-paste samples and beat-heavy production, and Hawaii, with its hula melodies and lush vacation living, prove to be an inspiring collaborator and muse, respectively. Despite Daddy Kev's pedigree, however, Reefer isn't an obvious hip-hop collection; it is more informed by its Polynesian birthplace than a street-wise aesthetic. After all, practically the first word spoken on this collection is ""aloha."" But despite oozing Don Ho-worthy ukuleles and steel guitar, the album does have one big hip-hop moment: ""Crony Island"", which, like Island's ""Where There's a Will There's a Whalebone"", uses Busdriver's flow and some stuttering, heavy beats to infuse jagged edges and a sense of urgency into these languid tropical sounds. Daddy Kev also adds three ""interludes"" that act like skits on a rap album, breaking up the songs with moments of spoken-word samples set to easy ukulele strums and fuzzy effects. The rest of the album is just four original songs of Thorburn's whispery warble, minor-key melodies, and cymbal-heavy beats that explore the dark side of tropical getaways-- what, you expected sunny songs from a guy with lyrical obsessions with ghosts and bones?-- and a cover of ""Blue Moon"" that's spun out of a hollow drum machine beat, ambient twinkles, and Thorburn's surprisingly rich baritone croon. Tracks bleed into one another using the sounds of the surf as a guide, and because crashing waves and dreamy ukulele noodling tie together the songs and interludes, Reefer feels like one long track, a cohesive statement instead of nine separate compositions. The collection ends with two remixes, which, unfortunately, feel tacked on (perhaps a tactic to keep the short album from being simply an EP?). And though they are nowhere near as good as any of the originals, they at least come from producrtion geniuses Flying Lotus and Dntel. The latter's take on ""Hit and Run"" (the better of the two) bleeds the track of its slightly sinister organ and melancholic guitar and, instead, leaves a spare, echo-laden shell in their place. And with a robotronic effect added to Thorburn's vocals amidst such a cavernous arrangement, the song suddenly becomes more remote and lonely. It may not be a pleasant listen, but it is an affecting one. ""Let It Go"", however, which is marked by breezy ukulele and the prettiest, warmest chorus of the album, is, in Flying Lotus' hands, simply a wash of glitchy, ticking-time-bomb beats, spacey videogame effects, and an overall clinical vibe. With barely any vocals or semblance of melody, it bears no resemblance to Reefer's version-- which is perhaps the best song on the album-- but though disappointing, it is an intriguing experiment. Despite it all, Reefer is Thorburn's best album of the year, and it is so successful because it feels tossed off, like he's not trying so hard. Maybe the islands-obsessed Islands frontman should take more vacations. Although judging from how often the guy likes to work, that's probably unlikely.","Islands' Nick Thorburn teams with L.A. hip-hop producer Daddy Kev for his third record of the year, following his primary band's sophomore effort and the debut of folk duo Human Highway.

"Movement / Power, Corruption and Lies / Low-Life / Brotherhood / Technique [Collector's Editions]",New Order,by: Tom Ewing,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bde3eb335119a49ecf8a/1:1/w_160/e1eb4bf2.jpg,2008-11-10 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12418-movement-power-corruption-and-lies-low-life-brotherhood-technique-deluxe-editions/,Rhino,"Ten years in 10 discs: this-- surely definitive-- edition of the New Order story starts with a shattered band groping to replace the irreplaceable and ends with a group surfing to no. 1 on the UK charts. In between is some of the most casually amazing pop music ever made, but these two bookends-- ""Dreams Never End"" and ""World in Motion""-- tell you more about the group than you'd think. The interesting thing about ""Dreams Never End"" is that Peter Hook sings on it, and he does as well as Barney Sumner would have. Following the suicide of Ian Curtis and subsequent retirement of the Joy Division moniker, New Order began as a band without a frontman; the trick of them is that they stayed that way, even after Sumner had become the regular vocalist. Sumner's often flat, affectless voice might be a familiar point of contact with New Order but it's rarely their focus. Their notoriously careless lyrics-- Sumner has generally made great play of how last-minute they are-- are a further sign of the group's discomfort with the way rock music tends to be lensed through its singer. So it's no surprise the 12"" format was so attractive for New Order-- more lovely space for the vocals to wander out of entirely. So if Sumner isn't a frontman, what is he? ""World in Motion"" suggests an answer. It's a song that uses soccer as a metaphor for raving and resistance-- ""Beat the man! Take him on!""-- so why not use the sport as a metaphor for what the band who made it do? In those terms, Sumner isn't a frontman, he's a target man: The striker whose job isn't just to score, it's to hold the ball so his teammates can move forward and into play. New Order's secret is their fluidity, their easy sharing of the spotlight. At any time in any song, any one of them might provide the hook-- the bright drama of Gillian Gilbert's keyboards, the giddy sequencing of Stephen Morris' percussion, Peter Hook's famously liquid basslines, or indeed Sumner's own guitar lines, as gorgeously full and melodic as his vocals are blank. This interplay defined New Order from the beginning-- on Movement's centerpiece ""The Him"", your focus flickers from the tribal drumwork to the blocky thrash of Sumner's guitar to the stern jab of the bass: it's almost never on the words. But New Order really woke up to their own potential when they bought a nightclub and started making music that might fill it, and for this side of the story you need the second discs of these generous releases, filled with singles and 12"" remixes. The deluxe reissue package can feel like the industry's last throw of the back catalogue dice-- hoover up all sorts of bits and bobs and use historical context as a figleaf to persuade people to buy the same record a third or fourth time. But not this time. If New Order had never released singles, how would we remember them now? Perhaps authors of a solid body of pop work, dependable fixtures of the alternative scene whose success nobody could begrudge. These albums are often excellent, but of these five packages, the ""bonus disc"" beats the first at least three times. The rhythmic experiments on Movement, for instance, make more sense when you hear them alongside the mechanoid funk of ""Everything's Gone Green"" and the sudden break into joy of ""Temptation"". The second disc here takes the bleak pressure off the original album, letting it breathe not as an awkward afterthought to Joy Division but as a group pushing that band's musical ideas further. Their most coherent and underappreciated record, it's still an uncomfortable listen, with tracks like ""Senses"" savage in a way they never were again. Power, Corruption and Lies exists in the shadow of two remarkable singles: ""Temptation"" and ""Blue Monday"". The first had established the band's emotional signature: a bittersweet rush of hard-won, inarticulate bliss. Many of their most glorious tracks-- ""Bizarre Love Triangle"", ""Run"", ""Your Silent Face"", ""Thieves Like Us""-- feel like returns to the well ""Temptation"" dug, which makes it even more perverse that the 1987 re-recording of that track is an absentee here: The original's greatness is rougher-edged. ""Blue Monday"", meanwhile, took the icy landscape of Movement-- and hence its loyalist audience-- fully onto the dancefloor. Power, Corruption and Lies works to reconcile these seminal records: It's a spiky take on synth-pop, with some of the group's giddiest music. The uninhibited tumbles of ""Age of Consent"" and ""The Village"" suggested a band drunk on possibility; ""Your Silent Face"" married rhythm and grandeur and anger. A generally sympathetic re-mastering job can't disguise how clattery and sharp Low-Life sounds: Hailed at the time as New Order's first really great album, it's now the one that seems most time-bound thanks to its brash mid-80s keyboard sounds. There's plenty of drama here, but the album's two stand-out tracks are best heard in their bonus-disc extended versions. At full 18-minute stretch, ""Elegia"" more than earns its pomposity, while the long mix of ""The Perfect Kiss"" has some claim to be the decade's greatest 12"" edit: A riot of interlocking bass and keyboard hooks, breathless handclap drums, and five or six different climaxes. The bonus disc of Brotherhood has two more peerless 12"" mixes-- Shep Pettibone's extensions of ""Bizarre Love Triangle"" and ""True Faith""-- but the album itself is New Order at their most wickedly ramshackle, turning away from the brash electropop of Low-Life and covering most tracks with the messy jangle of Sumner's guitar. They sound, for the first time since Movement, like an indie band-- but a superb one: Four musicians at ease with each other and themselves, combining on tracks like ""Way of Life"" to provide a feast of hooks that leaves the listener breathless and delighted. Elsewhere, ""1963"" and ""True Faith"" suggested they had the songs to be chart fixtures on relatively conventional terms; ""Touched By the Hand of God"" and the pointless ""Blue Monday '88"" hinted they might be running out of steam. Instead they made arguably their best record. Past the red herring of ""Fine Time""-- a dance music band ""going dance,"" and one of those rare gags that stays entertaining-- Technique takes the easy interplay and full-band sound of Brotherhood and drenches it in good Ibiza vibes. Each track, as it leads you into a fluid maze of melody, is a hug from a stranger you've known all your life. ""Nothing in this world can touch the music that I heard as I woke up this morning,"" sang an awed-sounding Sumner, catching the album's mood perfectly. Technique is magnificent, but it has the weakest bonus disc of all-- listless B-sides and instrumentals, and merely functional remixes. Standard-bearers for club culture in the alternative world for most of the decade, New Order never really adapted to dance music's victory in the UK mainstream: They made more great records, but no more great 12""s. With their sound perfected, they also stopped surprising us: So even though this isn't all the records they made, these collectors' editions still feel like a complete story of this most accidental of bands.",,9.3,
Sebastien Grainger and the Mountains,Sebastien Grainger & the Mountains,by: Joe Colly,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bdd813d197565213b628/1:1/w_160/5383ba45.jpg,2008-11-07 06:00:05,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12406-sebastien-grainger-and-the-mountains/,Saddle Creek,"When details of Death From Above 1979's breakup surfaced in 2005, it was surprising to learn of conflicts between Jesse Keeler and Sebastien Grainger, the band's only two members. The tight synchronicity of their rage-dance breakout You're a Woman, I'm a Machine-- released just a year before the split-- instead suggested that the look-alike duo shared a close creative companionship. In retrospect it seems like they probably didn't agree on an aesthetic, either. Keeler's post-DFA79 project MSTRKRFT abandoned rock for techno, shooting for (and whiffing on) a heavily vocodered brand of Daft Punk-inspired electro-house. Grainger's debut solo effort Sebastien Grainger and the Mountains, meanwhile, ventures down a more conventional rock path with tracks built loosely on the singer-songwriter template. Of course, that term conjures unpleasant notions of watered-down Dylanisms (or worse), but Grainger isn't a neo-folkie (though signing to Saddle Creek might further the misconception). He's simply fleshed out his own song sketches with power-pop and, occasionally, 1970s arena rock to create a batch of high-energy, radio-friendly tunes. The record showcases Grainger's command of melody and works best at its most straightforward, like on album opener ""Love Can Be So Mean"". As with other standout moments here, the song leans heavily on the beefy power chords of Cheap Trick and an anthemic, new wave-inspired chorus. With its shouts of ""Let's go out tonight!"" the track could easily play beneath a high school flick's one-last-party sequence, and I mean that wholeheartedly as a compliment. ""Who Do We Care For?"" and ""American Names"" are equally catchy, the former recalling QOSTA's heavy-rock crowd pleaser ""Go With the Flow"" with its handclaps and insistent piano backing. Had Grainger chosen to stick with this direction, Mountains would be perfectly listenable (if unoriginal), but unfortunately the album's strong lot ends with ""American Names"". On the bulk of the remaining songs, he shows an odd tendency for lopsidedness-- songs with capable choruses but plodding, asymmetrical verses. Make it through the inconsistent patches of ""I Hate My Friends"" and ""By Cover of Night (Fire Fight)"" and you'll be rewarded with sugary sweet, synth-flecked hooks and left feeling only half-satisfied. On these songs (and others such as ""[I Am Like a] River"" that suffer a similar fate), it feels like Grainger is going for a Pixies-esque verse/accessible refrain format, but this material-- uncomplicated and pop-reaching as it is-- doesn't call for it. Mountains also trots out a handful of head-scratchers. Grainger includes a live version of ""I'm All Rage"", and while it's a good recording of a decent song, it protrudes oddly from the studio cuts surrounding it. There's a Jay Reatard-type punk thrasher called ""Niagara"" that is said to have been originally posted to MySpace after a night of heavy drinking and doesn't appear to have been improved upon since. Decisions like these make for an effort that, at times, comes across as slapdash and underthought. Which brings us full circle, in a strange way, to DFA79. While the band surely wasn't the headiest of its era, there was a svelte, muscular quality to their music-- a feeling that any excess had been cut away-- that is absent from this record (and, it's worth noting, Keeler's work in MSTRKRFT). What's also gone is the sense of aggression and urgency that made You're a Woman, I'm a Machine so impressive. Perhaps the same discord that did the group in was also its driving force; we'll never know. What does seem clear now, though, is that if Keeler and Grainger continue at their current pace, they won't soon escape the shadows of their former glory.","In contrast to his former Death From Above 1979 partner's MSTRKRFT project, Sebastien Grainger's debut solo effort ventures down a more conventional rock path with tracks built loosely on the singer-songwriter template.

Disgorge Mexico,Fuck the Facts,by: Cosmo Lee,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bdcbea9e61561daa77a1/1:1/w_160/8d09cba1.jpg,2008-11-07 06:00:04,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12392-disgorge-mexico/,Relapse,"As their name implies, Fuck the Facts can be hard to grasp. (Even Amazon is conflicted about whether to spell the band's name with the full expletive.) Their moniker comes from a Naked City song, and the band is similarly freewheeling. One foot stays in grindcore, but the other plays a game of Twister with electronics, noise, and feints at jazz. Over the band's 10-year history, it has amassed an astonishingly lengthy discography comprising dozens of splits, singles, EPs, and full-lengths. With a revolving door of personnel totaling eight ex-members, the band's sound has mutated in an ad hoc fashion. Current vocalist Mel Mongeon, a woman with a man's growl, and increasingly powerful production have stabilized the band somewhat; 2006's Stigmata High-Five was merely spastic in comparison to previous epileptic leanings. Disgorge Mexico was written during a two-week road trip from the band's native Canada to Mexico. The title comes from a Mexican death metal band, but it also describes the record's creation. Burnt out after the road trip, the band went on hiatus and left the album unfinished. Gradually, after months of personal issues, they reconstituted themselves. The result reflects the angst and uncertainty of that time. Mongeon's lyrics and album artwork are rife with images of construction and destruction: ""The entire walls were built with sand bricks/ As everything piled up, the architect was left drained."" Related are themes of betrayal and refuge denied: ""How could it be?/ The same hands that gave peace and shelter to the ones that they are about to destroy."" Mongeon isn't slave to her printed lyrics, often glossing over lines to emphasize crucial words rhythmically. Sound is the weapon; text is simply its icing. Fittingly, Mongeon's bandmates wrap her in walls of dread. The production is monstrous, and Fuck the Facts now sound like they are exploding instead of imploding. ""No Return"" careens through hairpin turns; ""Dead End"" bulldozes like a slowed-down Slayer. Electronic dalliances are at a minimum here; big riffs are not. This is the heaviest Fuck the Facts have ever been, which suits Mongeon's buckets of black paint. ""Driving Through Fallen Cities"" glints with Metallica-esque clean tones, complete with melodic solo, then drops into ""La Culture du Faux"", a doomy soundtrack for end times. ""The Storm"" is an exhilarating steeplechase through anthemic melodies, chugging hardcore punk riffs, and a limber jazzy break. While such diversity is not new for Fuck the Facts, it now comes in a huge metallic exoskeleton. It's scary because it's scared, a nightmare amplified and multi-tracked. Instead of slipping through fingers, Fuck the Facts now engulf.","Keeping one foot in grindcore while the other plays a game of Twister with electronics, noise, and feints at jazz, Ottawa's Fuck the Facts have created their heaviest album yet.

Resurgam,Alias,by: Mia Lily Clarke,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bdce5e6ef9596932313a/1:1/w_160/7c98e628.jpg,2008-11-07 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12395-resurgam/,Anticon,"A lot has happened since the release of Alias' last solo album, Muted, in 2003. Perhaps most notably, Oakland-dwelling Brendon Whitney-- who had left Portland, Maine, to hook up with the rest of anticon.'s preliminary influx of artists following 1998's Deep Puddle Dynamics collaboration (alongside Doseone, Sole, and Atmosphere's Slug)-- headed back home after almost a decade out West. Despite a break in recording solo, and moving away from the community that had supported him since the early days, Alias has had little down time musically. In 2005 he released the instrumental LP, Lillian, with his younger brother Ehren, and the subsequent year he teamed up with New York-based singer Tarsier for another full-length, Brookland/Oaklyn, which paid tribute to trip-hop while expanding their combined interest in contemporary electronica. Fittingly for Alias' first solo recording in five years, Resurgam takes its title from his hometown's Latin motto, translating to ""I will rise again."" Although anticon. originally provided an alternative platform for geographically disparate but like-minded hip-hop artists when it started in the late 1990s, the label, continually flexible and innovative with its boundaries, has since grown to be equally associated with electronica and indie rock. This unification of genres has been a trademark of Alias since the beginning, and on Resurgam he successfully skips and fuses musical elements from across the board. The opening track, ""New to a Few"", has its bearings firmly in 80s-era hip-hop and flares with energy and hard-line beats before sliding into vast electronica with the aptly named ""I Heart Drum Machines"". Here, Boards of Canada-style soundscapes open up the space before collapsing into an upsurge of intricate rhythms and melodic samples that alternately break the flow then bring it back forward. These beats are often fairly stock in sound, but it's Alias' melodic additions that keep the steady pace of Resurgam engaging and refreshing, throwing some unexpected turns into the mix and proving that, stylistically, anything goes. Fellow anticon. founder Yoni Wolf (aka Why?) joins Alias on the standout track ""Well Water Black"", where he ties together his distinctive, introspective monologues with a falsetto melody that wouldn't be out of place on a Flaming Lips record, pitching everything against a jolly background of virtual glockenspiel, happy-go-lucky handclaps, and what sounds like the album's only (thoroughly spectacular) live drum patch. And while tracks such as this conjure images of walking down a sunshiny Oakland avenue with jingling pockets and a spring in one's step, Alias' dice have many sides. Fast-forward six minutes and he's back to an airy instrumental that makes room for all the other ideas searching for space: sad-eyed acoustic indie with the One AM Radio on ""Weathering""; propulsive urban electronica on ""Autumnal Ego""; clear echoes of Four Tet on ""Death Watch""; and the kind of euphoric jams one might expect to hear in a European disco club on ""M.G. Jack"". While Resurgam is a record of many different moods, and unashamedly derivative of Alias' influences, it maintains a distinctive, concrete consistency. This is largely due to Alias' impressive talent for arrangements; the material is deftly woven with a great ear for detail, and there really is something to appeal to almost everyone. It is precisely this autonomous yet inclusive approach to creating music that Alias and his anticon. cohorts have always supported, and what makes Resurgam even larger than the sum of its parts.","The producer and rapper returns with an album that reflects recent developments in the anticon. label, focusing on hip-hop while remaining flexible and incorporating elements of more abstract electronic music and indie rock.

Little Joy,Little Joy,by: Stephen Troussé,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bddcea9e61561daa77c8/1:1/w_160/33bc5796.jpg,2008-11-07 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12412-little-joy/,Rough Trade,"From the Beatles' Ringo Starr and the Rolling Stones' Charlie Watts behind the drums, to bassist Alex James of Blur, it's often the guys at the back, treating the whole music business as some vast, cosmic joke, who seem to be loving every minute of it. Swanning through press conferences, photocalls, and video shoots with an air of amused detachment, dutifully turning up to the studio for a couple of hours work, dating supermodels and movie starlets, and all the while quietly banking royalty checks-- it's a good living. Fabrizio Moretti is a classic case in point. Brilliant name, great hair, stupidly handsome, and what did he even do on those Strokes records? On most of those tracks it sounds like they plugged a fritzy old drum machine through a busted radio. And he still winds up dating Drew Barrymore. Now, just to rub it in, he's casually made the best record involving a Stroke in years. The film writer David Thomson once posited the secret genre of movies where nothing really happens. Meet Me in St Louis, where the Smith family almost moves to New York-- but then doesn't. Or Rio Bravo, where there's supposedly some business about a jailbreak or something, but the film is really about Howard Hawks, John Wayne, and Dean Martin sitting around on a Hollywood set wisecracking, flirting with Angie Dickinson, singing the occasional song with Ricky Nelson, and not quite believing their luck that they get paid for this. I can imagine Little Joy as one of those movies. Here's the storyline: Fab has just split up with his Hollywood royalty squeeze, and while drowning his sorrows at some insanely lucrative half-hour festival appearance in Portugal, winds up knocking back Casa Nobles backstage with a Brazilian named Rodrigo Amarante. Amarante used to be in this band Los Hermanos, which means ""The Brothers""-- perfect for an Apatow bromantic comedy. Fab digs Rodrigo's slow sad croon, which floats on a breeze blown all the way from his own childhood back in Brazil. They hatch a plan to hook up some time back in L.A. Soon enough they catch up again, jamming at Devendra Banhart's pad up in Topanga (possible part for Russell Brand?), and decide to get a place down in Echo Park, work on some songs and see what happens. By now Fab has hooked up with this broad Binki Shapiro-- crazy cute, with a voice like summer wine. The three of them spend their afternoons hanging out a down-at-heel neighborhood bar (it's called Little Joy), mixing their own cocktails, strumming on ukuleles, and singing along to a jukebox stuffed with Brazilian bossa nova, Portuguese fado, Julie London ballads, some early Mazzy Star, one of those Spanish Jonathan Richman albums, and the Velvet Underground's Loaded. And that's it... and it's pretty great. Little Joy is not going to stop the world or change your life, but it's one of the sweetest, most listenable, consistently enjoyable records of the season. ""No One's Better Sake"" mixes things up a little, trying out a soused skank. ""Keep Me in Mind"" sounds a little like the Strokes if Julian Casablancas mellowed out and better carried a tune. ""Unattainable"" puts Shapiro's smoky, sleepy-eyed voice center stage. If you were going to download one track, you'd go for ""Don't Watch Me Dancing""-- another Shapiro number, it sounds like a standard already, like if Lou Reed gave one of his Mo Tucker tunes to Ann-Margret. LCD Soundsystem's James Murphy once told me he could imagine in 15 years' time, he might be having a barbecue, and someone would dig out the Strokes' debut from a pile of old CDs and, as the half-forgotten power-pop drifted across the summer lawns, he would realize, ""You know what? That was a great little record! A perfect barbecue record!""

Surfing,Megapuss,by: Andrew Gaerig,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bdc9abf31b7dc7156016/1:1/w_160/0f05af52.jpg,2008-11-07 06:00:01,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12409-surfing/,Vapor,"Corporations nebulously define the word 'goodwill' as the value of a company not captured by its measurable assets: customer lists, public perception, iPhone pics of a rival CEO in women's lingerie. Just like most other assets, goodwill decreases over time, and to many, so too has Devendra Banhart's. ""Fuck Enron,"" Banhart sings on Surfing, his new collaboration with Priestbird's Greg Rogove; it'd be funnier if his public reputation hadn't taken a similar nosedive. Banhart also sings ""Fuck Abe Lincoln"" moments later during ""A Gun on His Hip and a Rose on his Chest"", and follows that song with an ""Earth Angel""-style slowdown titled ""Chicken Titz"", so some of the skepticism here might be warranted. Surfing falls firmly in the ""screwing around"" category of side projects, with the duo unleashing all manner of styled silliness: ""Duck People Duck Man"" muses about Trader Joe's hummus; ""Adam and Steve"" knowingly bites the Strokes' ""Hard to Explain"" and Wham!'s ""Careless Whisper""; ""Hamman"" vamps rudely about the availability of...ham. ""Gun on His Hip"" is a sloppy Xerox of ""Bo Diddley"" and the most likely to offend: In addition to aforementioned gems about Enron and Abe Lincoln, we're treated to ""Fuck the president/ Iiiiiiin his asshole."" Whether this sounds stupid will likely depend on your feelings toward Banhart, but regardless, it's more compelling to hear him err on the side of nonsense than hard art: Toss-off ""Duck People"" can be a decent tune and a bad joke or the reverse, but it's easier to take than last year's ""Sea Horse"", an eight-minute, multi-part suite about, among other things, sea horses. In fact, SoCal goof fits Banhart pretty well: Think Frank Zappa with (way) less musical chops. The record does offer some genuine treats. The vaguely Brit-poppy ""Theme From Hollywood"" seems like a play on Banhart's semi-recent run of publicity, with a chorus that minces up ""Too much fun in Hollywood"" with ""Too much fucking Hollywood."" Opener ""Crop Circle Jerk '94"" offers a loping guitar riff and a sighing chorus, and, importantly, doesn't seem to have much to do with its title. ""Lavender Blimp""'s thin, trebly guitars blanket a gallant chorus. ""Hamman"" is alternately forceful and beguiling. The title track is a drawn-out paean to escapism and rehab (""Surfing/ Never alone/ Surfing/ Your mind is blown""), but its undulating piano chords seem like a hearty nod to Animal Collective. Alas, Surfing troublingly ends with three plodding failures (including the seven-minute ""Sayulita"") that feel at odds with the record's fuck-all spirit. Too much of Banhart's bothersome wordplay-- ""eat your yeast infection,"" ""chode-alicious""-- falls far south of ""having a good time."" What Surfing does do well is present a more relaxed Banhart-- a let-the-tapes-roll collaborator with bad-in-jokes and sly pop instincts. Megapuss has the feel of a short-lived side project, but it may ultimately prove a blueprint for the type of left-field, anti-hero path for which Banhart seems suited.","Devendra Banhart and Priestbird's Greg Rogove team up for a record that falls firmly in the ""screwing around"" category of side projects, with the duo unleashing styled silliness as well as some genuine treats.

When Farina is at his best he can paint an evocative picture with a minimum of strokes, either a few pointed lyrical abstractions or a handful of strums and plucks. Unfortunately, he's often erred on the side of excess, going overboard with his guitar heroics or wordplay and turning seemingly pleasant or interesting tunes into loveless labors. This familiar turn occurs much too often on Glorytellers' intermittently enjoyable full-length debut. The story goes that Farina wrote most of the album's songs on a beat-up flamenco guitar while ensconced in a secluded cabin in the mountains of northern Italy. It might seem like a set-up that's too good to be true, but Glorytellers shines brightest when it comes closest to realizing that idyllic scene. ""Trovato Suono"" (Italian for ""Found Sound"") does this the best of all the album's tracks. It combines flamenco strumming and brushed drums with unobtrusive plugged-in flourishes, and Farina, in his indomitable affect-free voice, gracefully offers some phrases to abet the whimsical worries (""Head feels like a satellite/ Dark side of the earth tonight"") at the root of his lyric. The tracks that lean on evocative images of nature also tap into this earthy simplicity, whether they be the slightly overwrought similes of ""Exclusive Hurricanes"" (""You are like the tree/ That spreads out all its seed"") or the decidedly wintery backdrop behind album closer ""Perennials"". The unfussy arrangements that accompany these tracks help enhance that charm. ""Tears Of..."" seems to be a similar slice of breezy prettiness, with its gentle arpeggios and lazy gallop, but semi-topical lines like ""infidels stare at you longest straight in the eye"" and ""tell the 30-odd-million what their tears are made of"" belie the track's relaxed demeanor and reveal the song to be an effective, if diffuse, polemic. Other attempts to speak hard-hitting poetic truths, however, aren't nearly as successful. The fractured family portrait sketched out in ""Camouflage"" comes off as over-written and overly emotive, and is also weighed down with intrusive spasms of electric guitar noodling. A few tracks-- specifically ""Quarantine"" and ""Anonymous""-- are so overloaded with words that Farina ends up cramming too much into too small a space, an arrangement that's unflattering to both the tales he's trying to tell and the voice giving them life. The tunes behind these words don't help matters-- the music in ""Quarantine"" is as harried and frantic as the lyric it's chasing, and the jazz-guitar licks that show up on ""Anonymous"" are anything but hot. The one place this approach comes closest to succeeding is in ""Awake at the Wheel"", where the non-stop rush of words and images are used in the service of a band-tour story that's seemingly about running across the still-fresh site of a roadside murder. Unfortunately, the abstraction of the actual events occurring in the song doesn't mesh with the specificity of the mentioned details, and the meandering shamble of a tune underneath it all clashes with the material. One or two missteps like this, where reach exceeds grasp and passion overwhelms prudence, are understandable if not commendable. The problem with Glorytellers is that the modest moments where song and story work together and co-exist peacefully are in short supply.","Geoff Farina of Karate and Secret Stars assembles a band to perform songs he wrote on a beat-up flamenco guitar while ensconced in a secluded cabin in the mountains of northern Italy.

Never Never Love,Pop Levi,by: William Bowers,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bdb35e6ef959693230f1/1:1/w_160/9230fdb5.jpg,2008-11-06 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12383-never-never-love/,Counter,"Well, Pop Levi is proof that a pop musician can be extremely talented, and weird, but not necessarily interesting. This anachronistically mop-topped, blouse-and-kimono-sporting former member of jack-of-all-Can-assed-trades Super Numeri remains sort of an answer to the pointless late-night rock-crit stoner query, ""Dude, what if Devendra Banhart were Liverpudlian?"" Of course, Levi now resides in Los Angeles, which seems to have added a veneer of clubby bouyance and an obsession with sophisticated superficiality to his previously merely Brit-gazing glam/retro arsenal. This album's three visits to his debut's old vamping grounds--""Wannamama"", ""Fire on Your Feet"", and ""Oh God (What Can I Do?)""--don't much outshine similar homages by fellow T. Rex-urrectors such as Wolfmother, Bobby Conn, Living Things, et al*.* I mean, you'd likely keep dancing if a deejay dropped ""Oh God"" right after ""Suffragette City""-- until its chorus-eats-itself finale, which probably aims for deconstruction but just sounds like the disc is skipping. But poor ""Fire on Your Feet"" commits the same peculiar sin as a whole suite of tracks from 2007's The Return to Form Black Magick Party: Its arrangement is oddly suggestive of ""Indian Reservation"", 1971's infamous P'ul Revere & the Raiders-in-Cherokee-drag smash. The majority of this platter, however, concerns itself with a bizarrely/proudly quote-unquote inauthentic experiment with 80s textures. Recorded at the same Westlake studio in which Quincy Jones concocted Thriller, at least seven tracks blend dorky/dated keyboard settings, bullyingly fey vocals, vapid lyrics, tricky time signatures, and all the urgency of cruise-ship reggae. Listeners are left wondering if they’ve just gorged on an Anglo response to J-pop, a post (white-)boy-band attempt to alley-oop new jack swing, or the work of a Scissor Sister gone solo. A trio of ballads soften the record’s grab-bag attack. ""Semi-Babe"" laments a lover whose Caller ID seems conspicuously overpopulated, kicking off Never’s preoccupation with the surveillance possibilities enabled by networks and networking sites (as well as incriminatingly begging the question of why the speaker is invading the semi-babe's privacy). ""You Don't Gotta Run"", meanwhile, is a senseless, luscious confection. ""Calling Me Down"", though, plays like Todd Rundgren pretending to have a ""womb"" in which to keep the grief his troublesome ladyfriend keeps on a-causing. Levi has stated of his intentions with this album that he ""wanted to have a kind of soullessness so it's almost like some kind of anti-soul."" To which I must respond: job well done. I've never encountered, in my 10 years of professional CD reviewership, an album so plastic in its references to New Edition, Sparks, and T-Pain that it would fit perfectly between mid-career Ween albums Pure Guava and Chocolate and Cheese. Levi is that secretly assidious studio rat who wants his labor to look minimal. So: Here's a willfully slight set of accomplished compositions just as full of hooks as the first Hellraiser film, which might, sadly, hold more appeal in twenty years, when played on ""ancient"" vinyl during a truce-night in some volatile couple's back-looking apartment. Never, never love, indeed.","After starting as a sort-of convincing Marc Bolan clone, Pop Levi crafts a record that mostly concerns itself with a bizarrely and proudly quote-unquote inauthentic experiment with 80s textures.

The Inbetween,Essie Jain,by: Amanda Petrusich,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bdb2abf31b7dc7155fdf/1:1/w_160/f6629a39.jpg,2008-11-06 06:00:02,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12382-the-inbetween/,Ba Da Bing,"Looking back, Joan Baez's high, heady trills seem eerily indicative of the unspoken melancholy that plagued the late 1960s in America: Baez's songs, no matter how upbeat, are seeped in a vague and persistent longing for something better, something less devastating. British-born singer and songwriter Essie Jain doesn't sound much like Baez-- she's not a folk singer, exactly, and her voice is often deep and direct where Baez's is light and warbly-- but her second LP, The Inbetween, is heavy with the same odd, pervasive uneasiness. From the nervous, scuttling piano notes which open ""Here We Go"" through the fog-horn desolation of the extra-grim ""I Remember It Just Like This"", The Inbetween is quiet and desperate, a trembling testament to general disillusionment. Jain's minimal compositions-- most tracks feature only vocals and piano or acoustic guitar-- are dark and distrustful (""There is not an innocent man around us who isn't under siege,"" she bellows in ""Please"") and tinged with an otherworldliness that earns her comparisons to freak-folkers past and present-- especially Vashti Bunyan, Sandy Denny, and White Magic's Mira Billotte. The cinematic bleakness of The Inbetween can be wearying, but it's also the record's central conceit; its atmospherics are at least as essential as its songs. Consequently, The Inbetween becomes the kind of record that leaves its listeners craving melodramatic context (walking despondently down a mysterious alley, fedora deflecting light rain, face obscured)-- anything more distinctive and tortured than just slouching over on a living room couch. Jain had a track (""Why"") included on the Slim Moon-curated The Sound the Hare Heard (alongside a slew of singer-songwriters, including Death Vessel, Sufjan Stevens, Thao Nguyen, Wooden Wand, and Laura Veirs), and her ghostly 2007 debut, We Made This Ourselves, placed her squarely within the new spook-folk paradigm. All of Jain's work is focused, mostly, on her lingering voice: It can be deep and prodding or high and vaporous, depending on the moment. ""Do It"", one of the richer tracks on the record (it includes piano, guitar, and drums), is also one of the strongest-- Jain's vocals, raw and uncorrected, nudge and jab. In ""Here We Go"", a steady piano melody and twittering drums back up Jain's playful, jazzy vocal line, one of the lightest included here-- ""Oh, oh here we go,"" she grins. The Inbetween is a remarkably wistful album, the kind that can be trying or cathartic, depending on when and how you listen, but Jain's voice is mostly stunning-- it's indicative of her precise time and place, and, accordingly, means something to all of us.","British-born singer and songwriter Essie Jain's second album is heavy with an odd, pervasive uneasiness-- it's a quiet, desperate, trembling testament to general disillusionment.

Tapes,The Rapture,by: Nate Patrin,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bdb4abf31b7dc7155fe2/1:1/w_160/c5dd2331.jpg,2008-11-06 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12384-tapes/,!K7,"The Rapture's transition from moody, nu-punk torchbearers to upbeat indie-popsters on Pieces of the People We Love might have alienated a certain contingent of their fans, but it also made them out to be a more versatile and unpredictable group than even the scene-defining Echoes might've hinted at. The band made that stylistic shift house-ward just in time to give the likes of Hot Chip and Simian Mobile Disco a heads-up on where nu-rave came from. For a while, though, there was still one thing that separated the Rapture from the dance-rock acolytes that cropped up in their wake: a stylistic mission statement thinly disguised as a mix CD. Tapes changes that, but to what effect? It's one thing to throw a bunch of songs together and show everyone what kind of cool stuff you've been spinning lately-- especially if it's a potential harbinger of what kind of ingredients might be going into a forthcoming album. And there's enough to get the modern club-music eclectic a bit geeked just looking over the tracklist: classic roller-boogie funk from the Bar-Kays and Vaughan Mason, vintage and revival disco, and a whole fistful of acts that hit all kinds of different points on the continuum between house and electro. It's a fine blend of the obvious (Paul Johnson's massive 1999 house hit ""Get Get Down""; Ghostface Killah's perennial ""Daytona 500""), the obscure (Richie Havens' discofied take on Lamont Dozier's ""Going Back to My Roots""; Don Armando's Second Avenue Rhumba Band's campy big-band homage to Irving Berlin's ""I'm an Indian Too"") and the current (Syclops' agitated retro-Detroit electro ""Where's Jason's K"" and DJ Mujava's house jam ""Township Funk""). Still, there's a difference between being a tastemaker with a great record collection and being a straight-up momentum-building DJ, and if you value slow builds and subtle transitions you might find yourself getting a bit antsy. The first half of Tapes is thrown together in a slapdash manner that leaves grooves too restless and transitions too jarring: The intro is 32 amputated seconds of the Undisputed Truth's ""Earthquake Shake"" cut abruptly into ""Daytona 500"", and the Ghostface track's attempted mix into the Junkyard Band's anti-Reagan classic ""The Word""-- from a straightforward funk-fusion break into the tumbling, rolling syncopation of the archetypal go-go beat-- feels like taking an Aston Martin off-road. And that aforementioned roller-boogie two-fer of ""Holy Ghost"" and ""Bounce, Rock, Skate, Roll"" should work, but the inexplicable half-assed fade into $20-boom-box tinniness at the end of the Bar-Kays track just before the segue isn't the smoothest way to move into couples' skate. Fortunately, not all of the mix is as jarring-- Martin Circus' 1979 Franco-cheese ""Disco Circus"" shakes hands well with Arcade Lover's sleek nu-Chic ""Fantasy Lines""-- and if you aren't too bothered by the seams, you'll eventually find that the second half of Tapes is packed tight with great recent tracks. Along with the Syclops and DJ Mujava cuts, there's Kiloo & Phonique's icy-hot deep house ""The Passion"", the Donk Boys' rubber-kneed ""Cpstyre"", and the room-filling ghettotech-electro of Dances With White Girls' ""Everybody's Got to Make a Living"", which boasts a kidney-punch level of bass and makes great use of the vocal hook from the 20th Century Steel Band's ""Heaven & Hell Is on Earth"". This mix might not help the Rapture pass every test of the best club DJs, but when it comes to maybe the most important one-- the ability to make clubbers push their way to the booth and breathlessly ask for the title of that amazing cut they just dropped-- they've done their studying.","Filled with classic and current disco, house, and electro tracks, this official mix from the Rapture will either satisfy or frustrate, depending on whether you're looking for a tastemaker with a great record collection or a straight-up momentum-building DJ.

Heart On,Eagles of Death Metal,by: Joshua Love,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bdb8ea9e61561daa777b/1:1/w_160/47f49717.jpg,2008-11-06 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12388-heart-on/,Downtown,"I belong to a small and misunderstood subset of rock fans who actually prefer Eagles of Death Metal to Queens of the Stone Age. (I mean, it's not like we've had any meetings or anything, so it's possible I might be the only one.) I dig Queens and the manfully cool bulldozing thing they do, it's just that I find Josh Homme's side gig with Jesse Hughes offers more of the stuff I crave from my rock-- sex, humor, fun. I know Eagles are far more derivative than Queens, but they steal from the best and have a great time doing it. So many new groups are so damn serious and reverent about stealing from post-punk or Neil Young or Bob Dylan that it's refreshing to see a couple of guys swipe from the Rolling Stones, New York Dolls, and Led Zeppelin and not give a shit about piety. Their newest record, Heart On, delivers more of the same, though that's hardly a pejorative when more of the same means being tighter than Cindy McCain's smile. To be fair, Heart On does reveal a slightly maturing sense of pop songcraft from Hughes and Homme: the disarming loveliness of ""Now I'm a Fool"" is equivalent to those pop-tinged weepers (like ""Questioningly"" or ""Needles and Pins"") that the Ramones used to toss out to catch you off guard. As its title windily suggests, ""How Can a Man With So Many Friends Feel So Alone"" also bears a somewhat melancholy cast, even as the guitars quote Messrs. Page and Richards at their cockiest. Another influence poking through the song is mid-to-late-90s Beck, back when the stereopathic Scientologist was expertly fusing country, blues, and funk to his own cracked-glass worldview. In fact, the wisecracking sex jams of 1999's Midnite Vultures serve as a pretty good reference point for several of the decidedly non-serious scuzz-rockers here, especially ""High Voltage"", with its invocations of ""getting freaky in the shadows of the night time."" Of course, whereas Beck preferred cobbling together his surrealistic quips from pop-culture allusions, Eagles of Death Metal have seemingly never met a dumb pun or double entendre they could resist (in case the album title didn't tip you off). But rather than coming off as smarmily ironic or just plain braindead, the cheap jokes align nicely with the band's entire cheeseball fuck-mook shtick. The James Brown homage ""(I Used to Couldn't Dance) Tight Pants"" and modestly punny ""Cheap Thrills"" (complete with bored female vocals and references to ""spending"" time) are fine, but neither compares to the retarded majesty of ""Solo Flights"". Rock's annals are rife with infamous odes to whacking off, but few have ever been as gleefully pleased with it as this one, thanks to assertions like ""nobody does me like I do."" To be honest, it's not a bad metaphor for the entire project, which amounts to an exercise in self-gratification that's nonetheless thoroughly entertaining for how much care and enjoyment is put into the act.","Queens of the Stone Age's Josh Homme returns with a new record from his other band, revealing a slightly maturing sense of pop songcraft despite their endearingly juvenile lyrics.

Invisible City,Wetnurse,by: Cosmo Lee,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd9b5e6ef959693230be/1:1/w_160/fab5fb90.jpg,2008-11-05 06:00:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12362-invisible-city/,Seventh Rule,"While a number of bands have aped Led Zeppelin's ""flamboyant frontman + hotshot guitarist"" shtick-- Jane's Addiction, Whitesnake, basically all of hair metal-- few capture their breadth like Wetnurse. Invisible City, the New Yorkers' second full-length, reinvents Led Zeppelin as a punk band. Drummer Curran Reynolds doesn't hit as hard as John Bonham, but he has a similar knack for groove and beat selection. Cleave Jimmy Page's double-necked axe in two, and you get guitarists Garett Bussanick and Greg Kramer. Shave Robert Plant's head, firm up his abs, and make him a black man: Gene Fowler. Then, mix in 1990s noise rock-- Fowler's yelp is a lot like David Yow's-- and the outré dissonance of early Voivod.
 
But the similarities are not only cosmetic. Like Zeppelin, Wetnurse are fond of acoustic guitar. Invisible City opens and closes with acoustic picking, and ""Life at Stake"" has strumming straight out of Led Zeppelin III. But, unlike Led Zeppelin, these acoustic bits aren't full songs. They're Wes Anderson-esque interludes that help underscore just how weird this record is. From the unbecoming name to the curiously bland artwork to the almost complete omission of printed lyrics, it's hard to penetrate Wetnurse.
 
Yet their twists and turns invariably lead to anthemic climaxes that, again, recall Zeppelin. ""Life at Stake"" deliciously pits major-key licks against minor-key riffs; the pull-offs of the former are pure ""Over the Hills and Far Away"". The descending chords in ""Sacred Peel"" recast ""Kashmir"" as proggy metalcore. Dinosaur rock also crops up in ""Slow Your Spell, Miss Hell"", albeit under the glowing arc lights of Chavez. Other memorable surprises include the Helmet riff snuck into ""Not Your Choice"" and the startlingly operatic diva that crowns ""Missing Lion Returns"".
 
Such unpredictability is both titillating and tiring. Wetnurse have an endless supply of catchy riffs, but they deploy them all instead of letting any sink in. Martin Bisi's recording feels dull; the guitars roar, but the drums merely punch where they should crack. Wetnurse's off-kilter attack works better live. There, their rapid-fire succession of riffs feels like fireworks at close range. They're punk, they're metal, they're classic rock; they're the ""all of the above"" that makes New York City frustratingly wonderful.","On their second full-length, New York's Wetnurse reinvent Led Zeppelin as a punk band, incorporating a bevy of sonic elements that reflect the eclecticism of their hometown.

They make groove-based music, but those grooves are patient, at times exceedingly subtle. They're indie, but of the diffident sort that pairs Fay Davis-Jeffers' dispassionate, nearly naïve-sounding vocals with bony, bookish rhythms. It's not that they have anything to be embarassed about: The record sees them incorporating, largely successfully, all manner of exotic-sounding, museum-quality instrumentation into their repertoire, and doing it the only way they know how-- quietly. In terms of their Chicago predecessors and contemporaries, the new Pit Er Pat approximates Tortoise's rhythm-centered experiments while mostly avoiding their overthinking tendencies, suggests the deceptively complicated melodic structures of tourmates Fiery Furnaces, and at points echoes Mahjongg's frenzied, rhythmic whirl. Mostly, though, Pit Er Pat are fine with quiet tinkering, and much of High Time reflects the playful experimental legacy of dub reggae; most obviously on ""Evacuation Days"", in the way the reedy guitar weaves in and out of the bottomless bass, dodging random sound effects (like a Brazilian cuíca, most recognizable from Beck's ""Tropicalia"") like renegade cab drivers. Or that maniacal laugh on ""Copper Pennies""-- sped up and tweaked so that it resembles a speed-addled chimp-- that matches the song's eerie funk, redolent of the pungent, gloomy Euro-fusion Can perfected on Ege Bamyasi and Tago Mago. ""Trod-A-Long"" pulls the band as far out of its shell as it's ever been, with playful organ licks, drawn out horn lines, melodica-derived ambience, and laser sound effects coalescing into a piece that suggests it should have its own dance to accompany it. The hieroglyphically-titled opening track ""☉ In ♑ : ☽ in ♈ : Anno IVxx"" asserts that High Time's occasional bouts of playfulness are still cloaked in mystery. ""Anno""'s vocal consists of nothing but chanted numbers, as if the song held an embedded code to decipher. Well, I've deciphered it, and it turns out that ""IV"" means ""4"", and ""xx"" means ""20"", and the URL is already taken, bros. Pit er Pat may be telling us they're stoners (that would explain the dub), but a track like ""Omen"" suggests that they're not the Brightblack Morning Light, hippie variety. As melancholy brass rises and falls like foghorns signaling a funeral at sea, Davis-Jeffers intimates that the album's title isn't suggesting the magazine that celebrates sticky hydro, but the ultimate buzzkill. ""Push me, push me under, where the cold river flows"" tells us it's ""high time"" for either an underwater burial or the creepiest-ever baptism. Despite the band's significant steps forward, High Time isn't a complete rebirth for Pit Er Pat, but the record shows that in their own way, they can learn and perform a more extroverted language.","Chicago band's latest experiments bring the group in the vicinity of dub reggae, eerie funk, and tricky post-rock, all executed with playfulness and a sense of mystery.

Chunk of Change EP,Passion Pit,by: David Bevan,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bdaeabf31b7dc7155fd6/1:1/w_160/08cf07d3.jpg,2008-11-05 06:00:03,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12379-chunk-of-change-ep/,Frenchkiss,"It's a backstory you couldn't possibly escape: This past Valentine's Day, Michael Angelakos opted out of throwing down the coin for some chocolates, teddy bears, or a copy of Love Actually. A little on the late side, he instead recorded for his girlfriend the lion's share of the lap-pop serenade, Chunk of Change. Friends were excited by what they heard, a band was born, a record deal signed. Defined as much by its lyrical prism and Angelakos' falsetto (more on that later) as its gooey textures, Chunk of Change walks the line between beat-driven, Hot Chip floor geeking and twee atmospherics. And while he gave his band the name of a 1980s skin flick, Angelakos' production mirrors the more cuddly bent that sparked the project: synths are Downy-soft, blankets of melodic skin that expand alongside their oversized choruses. More significantly, it suggests a certain level of un-self-conscious pop versatility. You can gyrate. You can navelgaze. You can shiver. You can cringe. It's a sonic ethos that fits much of Angelakos' lyrical Lloyd Dobler-ing well. Opener ""I've Got Your Number"" is a clear standout, its synthetic handclaps and high frequency whirring offer a prime framework for introducing the dude's voice and poetry. Depending on your emotional constitution or complexion, the latter can be, understandably, something of a turn-off. As is the case with the less propulsive material here, most time is spent nose-to-nose with turns like ""Have you seen me cry tears like diamonds? Down and down they fly, faster and faster,"" or ""Whatever happens to you, whatever happens to me, I hope that I'll fall asleep knowing that you'll always be the story with no ending."" But you can't fault a guy for loving someone his way. Given the notion that Angelakos initially expected just one person to really listen, the record benefits heavily from that which a lot of us look for in sound or elsewhere: emotional authenticity. If anything, the EP's major flaw is also a gamebreaker. Angelakos' falsetto flirts dangerously with histrionics at times, the breathy swings of ""Cuddle Fuddle"" or forgettable disco-pop of ""Better Things"" are two examples of his pipes at their most distracting. He can veer way off course for sure, but when matching the movement and mood of his own textures, his exuberance can be narcotic. ""Sleepyhead"" is the one addition not included on the original mixtape and it hints at savvier, more muscular vibrations coming down the pipeline (a full-length is slated for early 2009). Also the EP's shortest and most infectious moment, it's a tipsy, bass-heavy Cristal bath with the likes of Mannheim Steamroller and Ginuwine. I think it's about a girl.","Starting out as a Valentine's Day gift for Passion Pit leader Michael Angelakos' girlfriend, this set of lap-pop serenades deftly walks the line between beat-driven, Hot Chip floor geeking and twee atmospherics.

Convivial,Luomo,by: Tim Finney,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bdbbc0084474cd0c2d73/1:1/w_160/d9722c13.jpg,2008-11-05 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12390-convivial/,Huume,"After 2006's disappointing Paper Tigers, I had wondered if Finland's Sasu Ripatti might quietly abandon Luomo, his moniker for a seductive, dub-laced brand of vocal house that resulted in two of this decade's most gorgeous albums, Vocalcity and The Present Lover. After all, Ripatti had a strong 2007 with excellent releases as Uusitalo (propulsive tech-house) and Vladislav Delay (swirling fractal dub). By comparison, it appeared that Ripatti had exhausted the possibilities inherent to the Luomo project, and that every new release was doomed to intensify a sense of diminishing returns. In retrospect, Paper Tigers sounds better than I remember: a stately, hypnotic collection featuring some of Ripatti's most refined house productions. But it exists almost entirely within the shadow of the first two Luomo albums, inviting the warmth of recognition rather than the flushes and chills of surprised fascination. Ripatti's work as Vladislav Delay hardly shocks these days either, but there's a sense with Luomo that the stakes are higher. Standing still is anathema to the Luomo aesthetic, the value of which resides not merely in the bewitching, spangly depths of Ripatti's arrangements, but also in the vague sense that, at his best, he forges new emotional as well as sonic territory, marshalling enormous amounts of studio wizardry and compositional effort to map out a new (effortless-sounding) textural and sensual approach to house music. So it's with a sense of relief bordering on exhilaration that I come to the fourth Luomo album to discover a substantial rewiring of this particular aesthetic. While retaining the voluptuous shimmer characteristic of all Ripatti's work as Luomo, this album distances itself from the stutters and glitches he previously used to imply conflict and self-contradiction (puncturing house's habitual self-assurance). Instead, Convivial parades an immaculately structured, insectile busyness: clean and clearly etched, each sound placed with infinite care and burnished to a hyperreal sheen. If Vocalcity was murky and enveloping and The Present Lover gaseous and giddy, then Convivial is more like the rush of pure oxygen, offering a sound that is so sharp and so vivid it sears as much as it energizes. It's also Ripatti's most unabashed foray into ""pop"" territory. Where previously the producer mostly oscillated between simple refrains and rigorously fractured vocal cut-ups (occasionally leaving his anonymous divas to wander in a confusing hall of mirrors), Convivial ushers in an array of guest vocalists whose contributions resemble (to a greater or lesser extent) ""proper songs,"" filled with the coherent emotional arcs of complete verses and choruses. ""Love You All"", a brooding gothic electro-ballad somewhere between the first Junior Boys album and Depeche Mode's Violator, forms a far outpost into this unfamiliar territory, its stuttering groove, morose strings, and eerie arpeggios creating a dense, almost claustrophobic topographic framework for Sascha Ring (Apparat)'s languid-but-tense verses and overblown falsetto choruses. It's a world away from the open-ended, near-formless echo-chambers of Vocalcity, or even the expansive curving surfaces of The Present Lover; compared to those albums, its exacting subordination of sonics to songfulness seems almost totalitarian. But it's precisely this sense of discipline that makes ""Love You All"" (together with Convivial's other highlights) so marvelous: The pressure that these full-blown song structures exert upon Ripatti's sonic largess creates an unbearable sense of momentum that makes the best tracks here almost explosive with a joyful sense of possibility. You can almost hear the delight with which Ripatti puzzles out how to imbue the transitions from verses to choruses on ""Love You All"" with the kind of anthemic surge that pop masters take for granted. And it is from within this process of symbiotic adaptation-- the careful entwining of the producer's trembling sounds along the snaking contours of songcraft-- that the hoped-for sense of emotional breakthrough emerges. The (relatively) weaker moments on Convivial are those which could most easily be mistaken for a reiteration the sound of the previous Luomo albums: On the understated chug of ""If I Can't"", (Scissor Sister) Jake Shears' bittersweet multi-tracked sighs mirror a little too closely the conflicted, stuttering divas of old, a resemblance Ripatti underlines by providing some of his most archetypal bruised, woozy synth chords. But even here, there's a sense of economy and structure that lifts the song above its immediate forbears, with every synth quiver and scraping dub echo carefully sustaining the ambiguous development of Shears' performance. But while it's pleasing to see Ripatti further hone his familiar sound, I can't help but prefer the alchemy of the new: The best moments on Convivial transpose that unmistakable air of aching longing onto a broader, less predictable sonic palette. ""Gets Along Fine"" might ride a familiar wistful bass riff, but the core of its appeal resides in the astonishing combination of bleeping synthesizer and pseudo-African percussion in its chorus, which makes it simultaneously the most aggressive and purely joyous Luomo production to date, the muscular assault of its universalist affection like an embrace so fierce it crushes. The marvel, and perhaps the necessity of the Luomo project, is bound up in the shock of physical intimacy; pleasurable, overwhelming, and at times a little scary. ""Am I really feeling this?"" ""Is it you who is making me feel this way?"" Yes, and yes.","After the relative disappointment of Paper Tigers, Vladislav Delay's fourth Luomo album rewires the project, forging new emotional and sonic territory, marshalling enormous amounts of studio wizardry and compositional effort to map out a new (effortless-sounding) textural and sensual approach to house and pop music.

A Hundred Million Suns,Snow Patrol,by: Joshua Love,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bdb9abf31b7dc7155fef/1:1/w_160/f06545cb.jpg,2008-11-05 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12389-a-hundred-million-suns/,Geffen,"Making soaring sissy-rock isn't as easy as it sounds, especially not when it pulls the heartstrings as precisely as Snow Patrol managed on the group's first two major-label albums, 2003's Final Straw and 2006's Eyes Open. Lead singer Gary Lightbody's lyrics may have been more wince-inducing than watching Sarah Palin go off script, yet none of it mattered when the band reached choruses so unabashedly large and humane. Though wide-screen preciousness is Snow Patrol's forte, that's no reason to expect Lightbody and co. to continue bleating towards the stars forever. Arena-sized anthemics have already taken the group to commercial heights scarcely imaginable when the formerly monikered Polar Bear were indie-pop nobodies on Jeepster, lost in Belle and Sebastian's shadow. The band's newest album, A Hundred Million Suns, doesn't represent any drastic shift in its sonic principles, yet it's noticeably lighter on surging, megawatt stadium-filling fare. Perhaps the newfound attention paid to nuance is just a sign of Snow Patrol's maturing, but in the record's puzzlingly diminished returns it's not hard to hear a band seemingly upping the degree of difficulty when it was just barely getting by in the first place. If A Hundred Million Suns has any hits in it at all, they're likely over and done in the album's first eight minutes. Opener ""If There's a Rocket Tie Me to It"" is Snow Patrol at their best and most emblematic, as Lightbody softens the blow of overwrought lyrics like ""the sea between us only amplifies the sound waves"" with his reliably irresistible Scottish burr, while the band crashes and explodes at his back. Second track ""Crack the Shutters"" also goes in the win column, regardless (or perhaps because) of its modest ambitions. Rhapsodizing about waking up in the morning next to a lover and wanting ""to bathe you in the light of day"" may be a fairly douche-y sentiment, but keeping his lyrical concerns at such an intimate level nonetheless serves Lightbody far better than the awkward cosmic strivings that color much of the rest of the album. Sure enough, there are groaners aplenty sprinkled throughout Lightbody's lyrics, three of the most cringe-worthy being: ""There's no truth at all/ Poking out at the giant eyes of ancient gods"" (from ""Lifeboats""); ""When your eyes meet mine I lose simple skills"" (""Set Down Your Glass""); and ""the shells crack under our shoes like punctuation points"" (""The Planets Bend Between Us""). There's also loads of bad planetary metaphors and overwrought cosmological bullshit that proves oh-so-germane to the album's title. Still, Lightbody's tin ear wasn't such a sticking point so long as Snow Patrol routinely rolled out choruses that caught your heart in your throat. Here instead we're treated to the lightly arrhythmic Radiohead-ish patter of ""The Golden Floor"", the numbingly simple acoustic patterns of ""Set Down Your Glass"", as well as the likes of ""Take Back the City"" and ""Engines"", which elicit initial optimism by the sheer fact of their volume only to eschew the band's patented emotive dynamics in favor of attempting to do something Snow Patrol just simply can't manage-- strut. A Hundred Million Suns is rife with the sense of a band striving to be taken more seriously, whether through rocking more manfully, displaying a more sophisticated subtlety, or simply stringing together three ponderous, already-overlong songs and calling the impenetrable result a 16-minute stand-alone epic (""The Lightning Strike""). Snow Patrol shouldn't be expected to manufacture mass-appeal pop-rock forever, but the fact remains that the group's talents aren't yet on par with these newer, more artful ambitions.","Though wide-screen preciousness is Snow Patrol's forte, the band's newest album, A Hundred Million Suns, is noticeably lighter on surging, megawatt stadium-filling fare, instead placing more emphasis on nuance.
