High Violet,The National,by: Andrew Gaerig,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a997ea9e61561daa5a75/1:1/w_160/b66c3cda.jpg,2010-05-10 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14203-high-violet/,4AD,"The National became popular in a very traditional way: by releasing some really good albums, then touring the hell out of them. They're boilerplate indie, free of hot new genre tags or feature-ready backstories, which is something their detractors derive great joy from pointing out. If the National are important, rather than merely good, it's for writing about the type of lived-in moments that rock bands usually don't write about that well. The characters in National songs have real jobs, have uninteresting sex, get drunk, and lie to one another. They do so during the regular course of a workaday week, on Tuesdays and Wednesdays. The National aren't ""dad-rock"" so much as ""men's magazine rock"": music chiefly interested in the complications of being a stable person expected to own certain things and dress certain ways. On the National's fifth album, High Violet, those constraints are starting to wear on them, which makes a lot of sense: they wear on most people. In between patches of obtuse imagery, singer Matt Berninger sounds increasingly self-destructive. The record's upbeat numbers don't cheer him up so much as commiserate with him. All of this makes High Violet a dark affair, even for a band with a reputation for sad-bastard melodrama. The National have never sounded triumphant, but they can still be reassuring, with Berninger's lyrics acting as salves for our own neuroses. Six drinks in, tired of your coworkers, wishing you could just go home and laugh at sitcoms with someone? Maybe get laid? The National's got your back. With an ever rising profile and plenty of indie-famous friends-- Sufjan Stevens and Bon Iver's Justin Vernon guest here-- the National were afforded the opportunity to obsess over High Violet. They could've holed up and recorded an idiosyncratic, expectation-defying mess. Instead they produced an ornate, fussed-over record that sounds like no one other than themselves. Given the amount of flack they take for being a no-frills bore, simply refining their sound was arguably the braver option. They miss, occasionally-- the string-drenched closer, ""Vanderlyle Crybaby Geeks"", is too decadent for its own good-- but mostly, they construct gorgeous, structurally sound vignettes. There are few bands that could craft a song like ""Sorrow""-- in which emotion acts as a character and the band turns Berninger's balladry into a well paced jog-- without stumbling over their own ambitions. The guitars on ""Afraid of Everyone"" actually sound nervous; ""England"" speaks of cathedrals over properly magisterial drums. These are triumphs of form. Berninger is still, for the most part, a socially obsessed claustrophobe. He has upper-class guilt on ""Lemonworld"" (""Cousins and cousins somewhere overseas/ But it'll take a better war to kill a college man like me,"" ""This pricey stuff makes me dizzy""). ""Bloodbuzz Ohio""'s magnificent chorus (""I still owe money/ To the money/ To the money I owe"") addresses the familiar, harrowing financial burdens of adulthood. He's best when he tones down the angst in favor of reflection or confusion. High Violet seems less likely to engender the personal connections of Boxer, but it's also bigger and more engaging-- a possibly offputting combination for a band following the footsteps of Echo and the Bunnymen, Wilco, and Arcade Fire. After all, eagerness often trumps execution, and the National aren't immune: For his part, Berninger looks increasingly like Dos Equis' Most Interesting Man in the World, and his cryptic lyrics seem like an application for the title. But the National rarely miss; when they aim for powerful or poetic, they get there. High Violet is the sound of a band taking a mandate to be a meaningful rock band seriously, and they play the part so fully that, to some, it may be off-putting. But these aren't mawkish, empty gestures; they're anxious, personal songs projected onto wide screens. Even if you don't consider yourself an upwardly mobile stiff with minor social anxiety, the National make it sound grand, confusing, and relatable.","Returning with a slightly darker and more ornate sound, the National remain masters of widescreen, emotionally engaging rock.

Cut and Run,Child Abuse,by: Marc Masters,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a99d9d034d5c69bf3ca6/1:1/w_160/34828141.jpg,2010-05-07 06:00:04,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14216-cut-and-run/,Lovepump United,"The beauty of Cut and Run, the second album by Brooklyn trio Child Abuse, is about as eye-of-the-beholder as it gets. If you're a fan of the complex-but-blunt punk/metal hybrid known as ""brutal prog""-- think Flying Luttenbachers and Orthrelm, Lightning Bolt and Ruins-- every note should be a direct hit. But If you're seeking a genre-transcender-- the kind of album that makes you think, ""this sounds more like stuff I already like than I expected""-- keep searching. There's nothing unexpected about Cut and Run. That's actually one of the best things about it. Throughout these six heavy-duty tracks, numerous pitfalls are avoided with ease. The sound is noisy yet spacious, as the group's burly elements wrestle judiciously rather than overlapping into vaguness. Singer Luke Calzonetti's grind-core growl is much sharper than the cartoonish goof that style often falls into. The math-y riffs and beats could sound clinical, but the sweat and grime it takes to execute them is wisely left intact. Most importantly, the trio rarely lets their bludgeoning repetition drift into autopilot. Instead, Cut and Run's loops numb your mind in a good way, producing more hypnosis than boredom. But even good mind-numbing can disengage the brain, and there is a jocky quality to Cut and Run that sometimes obscures the thought behind it. The band cites composers Karlheinz Stockhausen and Charles Ives as influences, and you can hear those strains if you focus deeply. But it's easier to let your pupils dilate and your brain liquefy. There are also some themes that make their scary moniker understandable-- opener ""Hold This"" gets its title from a traumatic incident bassist Tim Dahl experienced at age six, and drummer Oran Canfield (son of Chicken Soup for the Soul creator Jack Canfield) recently wrote a memoir about his troubled youth. But those kind of ideas are buried under all the bombast. Brutal-prog should crush your skull before it stimulates what's inside, and Cut and Run succeeds on that count. But at times it pursues reflexive muscle at the expense of reflective thought. The final track on Cut and Run hints at ways the band might capture mind and body more equally. Led by Calzonetti's woozy keyboard, ""Froze Toes"" sounds refreshingly open-ended, blurring the line between sharp math and loose impulse. It's not a radical departure-- nothing here is-- but if Child Abuse move more toward such unpredictable edges, their already sturdy music could could become exponentially stronger.","Brooklyn trio creates brutal prog à la Lightning Bolt or Orthrelm, but in consistently unexpected ways.

East General,The Bitters,by: Joe Colly,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a98f9d034d5c69bf3c8b/1:1/w_160/5a492fdb.jpg,2010-05-07 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14210-east-general/,Mexican Summer,"It's hard to imagine why, but the Bitters decided this image above was the best cover for their debut album. Yikes. It's a foul, repulsive picture (fun fact: it was also used by Norwegian black metal band Orcustus), but in a way, it kind of makes sense. Because the Bitters do in fact make gross-sounding music. Not cringe-inducing music, or grotesque music, but their sound is primarily about scuzz-- in their formula, garage-rock, art-punk, and even sunny pop are covered in a thick, goopy layer of mud. This is an increasingly common approach, used by bands like Vivian Girls, Golden Triangle, and Sic Alps, but usually these acts balance out their murk with pop hooks. But the Bitters, who are vocalist Aerin Fogel and Ben Cook (Fucked Up, Young Governor), skew more to the noise side of the equation. Their ramshackle songs mostly resist pop arrangements-- it's more about capturing a feeling within a racket than finding grooves or melody. Guitars screech, drums thud, Fogel shrieks, but amidst this noise there's a sense of forward momentum (albeit a wild, out-of-control kind) that keeps their songs grounded in some form of structure. On East General, the Bitters marry cacophony with bits of doo-wop and grungy rock, but the album can be a slog for a couple reasons. First, the balance is off-- there's just not enough tunefulness to compensate for all the clamor. The band does offer some sweet moments-- the girl-group harmonizing of ""No Anchor"" and ""Impatient as Can Be""-- but mostly they emphasize harshness so much that songs become muddy and unmemorable. The record's other main issue is length. Bands who do this kind of thing well (No Age or Sic Alps) know brevity is key, and these tracks would work better shorter. There's no reason, for example, that closer ""I'm Feeling Good"" needs to approach seven minutes-- there aren't enough ideas to carry it that long. Not surprisingly then, East General works best on straightforward, punchier songs like ""Nails in the Coffin"" and ""The New Real Way"". If you've followed the Bitters on their early singles, you know they can crank out good material when they keep things simple-- see blog fave ""Warrior"". A lover's anthem equal parts venom and longing, it was brief and to the point and highlighted both Cook's untamed instrumentation and Fogel's captivating vocals. It seems reasonable to think they could find that spark again and shake off this record with a stronger follow-up.","Fucked Up's Ben Cook's side band issues its debut LP, which leans more to the ""noise"" end of ""noise-pop"" than contemporaries Sic Alps and Vivian Girls.

Liquid Love,Shy Child,by: Tim Finney,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a98ec0084474cd0c1062/1:1/w_160/0a15b80f.jpg,2010-05-07 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14211-liquid-love/,Wall of Sound,"Shy Child's previous album Noise Won't Stop hit on a sweet spot between the fashionable and the embarrassing, summed up in the album's surging, synth-heavy new wave sound that brought to mind early 1980s Genesis as much as early-80s Talking Heads. As with both those bands, Noise Won't Stop courted disaster by threatening to ""mean it"" too much: the songs affected knowing jadedness, while sounding disconcertingly earnest in their communication of disaffection, as if archness and distance are only emotions one feels about other things and other people. The result sounded, at its best, awkward, and loving Shy Child meant loving them because of, rather than in spite of, this awkwardness. Their megaphone enthusiasm seemed noble and necessary, in that you wouldn't engage in it yourself. On Liquid Love, Shy Child undertake the shift from modernism to post-modernism on just about every level. Gone are the jagged rhythms vaguely suggestive of Timbaland and dancehall, replaced by steady, reassuring disco pulses and lush, squelchy synth work reminiscent of late-era French house (think Alan Braxe and Fred Falke). And whereas before singer Pete Cafarella seemed unable to spot the difference between singing and declaiming, here the vocals are all coy harmonized falsetto croons, a deliberately empty evocation of plastic soul, like a photograph of a photograph. The title track opens with a near-exact recreation of the shimmering intro to Fleetwood Mac's ""Everywhere"", which spells out Shy Child's intentions: not to evoke the ""futurism"" of the 80s, but rather the utopian agelessness and placelessness of its synthetic textures. At first I resented this: What value was there in Shy Child abandoning their singularity in order to make songs that sound like less idiosyncratic versions of MGMT's ""Electric Feel""? A fair amount, as it turns out, mostly because Shy Child are so good at over-egging their songs with hooks-- the obsessively layered synth work in particular can be dazzling. But whereas before their songs seemed always on the verge of collapsing under the weight of their ideas, here the duo sound reined in, subordinating their maximalist tendencies so as not to spoil the illusion that they are now peddling ""perfect"" pop. But Shy Child's brand of arch pop perfection is a front, falsetto vocals notwithstanding. These songs are, if anything, even more earnest than their predecessors, only now Shy Child are trying to seduce you with their insights rather than flatten you with them. ""If it feels so right how can anybody call it wrong?"" they sigh in ""The Beatles"", disguising a didactic defense of drug-taking behind rhapsodic sweetness. And despite reveling in four-minute disco-pop excursions, Shy Child haven't switched up their style much as they pretend; the sudden prog rock keyboard solo that floods the otherwise straight-ahead ""ESP"" evidences the duo's inability to keep their virtuosic tendencies in check, even if now it sounds more like a Daft Punk quote than it would have before. Still, it's a shame that Shy Child don't bust loose more often. The gloriously overblown electronic body music homage ""Criss Cross"" demonstrates that Shy Child don't need discipline to be engaging, but it's a lonely exception on an album that otherwise sounds rigorously liposculpted. As with their last album, Shy Child end with an unexpected pinnacle. Then, it was the trance-pop anthem ""Cause and Effect""; on Liquid Love, it's bittersweet ballad ""Dark Destiny"", whose slowly deflating synth pirouettes mirror perfectly the song's depiction of a friendship's persistence through disappointments. ""I'll keep defending choices you're making,"" the duo declares, and if there's a more poignant declaration of fidelity in pop this year, I've yet to hear it. For Shy Child, synth-pop short-circuits the space between unreality and truth, the artificiality of its expanses allowing a sort of wide-eyed honesty that naturalism forecloses. That bittersweet sincerity sticks much harder than Liquid Love's sleek surfaces would ever suggest.","The New York synth-pop duo have streamlined their sound, opting for lush, reassuring disco pulses reminiscent of late-era French house.

Honest Strings: A Tribute to the Life and Work of Jack Rose,Various Artists,by: Grayson Currin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a9a25e6ef95969321450/1:1/w_160/22397ea2.jpg,2010-05-07 06:00:01,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14221-honest-strings-a-tribute-to-the-life-and-work-of-jack-rose/,Three LobedFinaJack Rose LLC,"Cory Rayborn is a lawyer in High Point, N.C., who, for the last decade, has run Three Lobed Recordings, a tiny, taste-driven label that specializes in the most electric, radiant drones and acoustic, ruminative rambles. Three Lobed's distinguished roster of alumni includes Tom Carter, Wooden Wand, Heavy Winged, Sunburned Hand of the Man, Six Organs of Admittance, Bardo Pond, and a horde of like minds-- basically, a fantasy camp for the wilder, woollier facets of what's been, for better and worse, dubbed New Weird America. Since 2008, Three Lobed also released two LPs by Jack Rose, the acoustic guitarist generally accepted as his form's giant. In the 1990s with the band Pelt, Rose made the sort of eternal atmospheres that suggested La Monte Young relocating to the foot of Appalachia. At the turn of the decade, Rose turned his fingers to a series of progressively ambitious solo guitar albums. The early work owed obvious debts to John Fahey, but Rose's parallel explorations of Middle Eastern music and the blues, bluegrass, and string band music pushed him to new shapes and sounds. When he died on December 5, 2009, he was on a serious hot streak. A full-length collaboration with Virginia string band the Black Twig Pickers and its then-forthcoming follow-up-- his ecstatic Thrill Jockey Records debut, Luck in the Valley, recorded with many of the same musicians-- stand as two of his career's best. With a technique and tone that seemed slowly carved from the trunk of an age-old oak, Rose was the well-listened, workmanlike advocate for the future of American primitive music. Down with indie kids, skilled enough to stun anyone, Rose seemed poised at last to have an impact beyond his own sphere of influence. Turns out, he already had: Not long after Rose died, Rayborn sent a late-night mass e-mail to most of the musicians he'd met as a listener or label head, asking if they'd like to offer a tune for his tribute to Rose. There were no length limits and no style guidelines-- only no covers of Rose tunes because, as Rayborn puts it, ""Jack would not dig that."" By the next morning, he'd secured a contribution commitment from a musician who hadn't even received the original invitation. And so, Honest Strings: A Tribute to the Life and Work of Jack Rose snowballed into a glorious and gargantuan 41-track, seven-hour, online-only ode. The importance of Rayborn's decision to make the tribute available only through download cannot be understated. Here, it allows for a rare marriage of quantity and quality, since each piece feels as uninhibited as the whole. Among the contributors are the expected-- Byron Coley, the Black Twig Pickers, D. Charles Speer, Steve Gunn, Loren Connors, No Neck Blues Band, and Hush Arbors, just to sample. But the true testament to Rose's legacy and conviviality are those you might not expect-- rock'n'roll bluesman Luther Dickinson of the North Mississippi All-Stars, Mogwai's Stuart Leslie Braithwaite, and 90s improvisational outfit Un. As such, it pays its respects without suffering an overload of reverence. Sure, there are acoustic guitar songs, but they come embedded among brilliant beds of rock'n'roll, country, improvisation, drone, spoken-word, book readings, and complete live explorations. It's less a eulogy for Rose and more a celebration of his-- or, really, anyone's-- obsession with music. Any concerns about 41 tracks of guitarists swiping Rose's style are void from the start: In just the first five cuts, Chris Forsyth offers a repetitive roadhouse number, while recent Rose collaborator D. Charles Speer twists jokes and memories of Jack around a goofy country trot that recalls Roger Miller's ""King of the Road"". Banjoist Charlie Parr and fiddler Mike Gangloff squeak and squeal through the exultant gospel exit ""This World Is Not My Home"". Six Organs of Admittance and Cian Nugent do reach for acoustics, but Six Organs' ""Drinking with Jack"" is a lithe, tender beauty; Nugent, a young Irishman, bends and breaks his themes. And that's just the first 27 minutes of this nearly 400-minute collection, not necessarily the best. Of these 41 pieces, there are very few blunders. Even the shortest one-- a patient 90-second reflection for acoustic guitar by Jenks Miller, better known for his drone and metal work as Horseback-- feels weighty. It's simple and sweet and, like the best work of the man to whom it's dedicated, is more concerned with expressing a feeling than evidencing high technique. Aside from a 54-minute reading from Joseph Mattson's debut novel, Empty the Sun, the longest track is a 43-minute live set from a Rose-less Pelt. Titled ""Louisville Susurration"", the piece unfolds with patience and grandeur. It alone would be a worthy album. Honest Strings is, at once, an incredibly demanding and non-threatening set. Its variety is either a marathon or a playground, meant as much for listening from one end to the other as it is for bouncing to and fro, picking up new sounds by artists you might not know. The entire set costs $15, too, or less than four cents per minute of music. Thanks to Rayborn's free curation and the free Web hosting of Thrill Jockey Records' digital outpost, Fina, every penny goes to Rose's estate. Much like the parameters Rayborn set for the collection, then, this brilliant mass of music is open to everyone. Now there's a legacy Jack would likely dig.","This gargantuan, online-only recording is an incredible testament to the life and career of the recently deceased acoustic guitar master Jack Rose.

Your Future Our Clutter,The Fall,by: Stuart Berman,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a998c0084474cd0c1073/1:1/w_160/7b3c8c80.jpg,2010-05-07 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14202-your-future-our-clutter/,Domino,"The only thing more unstable than the Fall's membership over the past 34 years has been their label situation. Fall figurehead Mark E. Smith seems happy to release his music on any ol' label that'll have him, whether it's A-list indies (Beggars Banquet, Rough Trade), under-the-radar imprints (Narnack, Action Records), or companies best known for issuing budget-series classic-rock concert DVDs (Eagle Rock). These shifts are emblematic of the band's own tumble along the mainstream/underground divide, creating those rips in the space-time continuum that allow the Fall to score the occasional Top 40 UK chart entry, Mark E. Smith to get gigs reading soccer scores on national sports telecasts, or ""Hip Priest"" to become the key punchline in yet another Hitler/Downfall video parody. But in a career that's defied all logic and convention, the Fall's signing to Domino makes perfect sense, given both the label's own over/underground balancing act and the fact that the Fall's influence can be felt in many of Domino's marquee acts (Franz Ferdinand and Arctic Monkeys among them). And while there's rarely been a correlation between the accessibility of a given Fall album and the profile of the label releasing it, the lean, brute-force rockers on Your Future Our Clutter suggest that the Fall might actually be taking this upgrade to Domino seriously. The new album was recorded with the same lineup that debuted on 2008's Imperial Wax Solvent, but you'd never know it without close inspection of the liners-- in sharp contrast to that album's playful, sloppy sprawl (typified by the hilarious centerpiece ramble ""50 Year Old Man""), Your Future Our Clutter sees Smith assuming the role of military drill sergeant to unleash a more pointed offensive against The Kids. From the opening theme ""O.F.Y.C. Showcase"" onward, Smith outfits his charges with single-chord morse-code riffs and lockstep rhythms before gradually ratcheting up the intensity; by the time we hit the gonzo second act of ""Y.F.O.C./Slippy Floor"", the Fall are thrashing about like a totally wired Led Zeppelin. And whether Smith is shouting, ""Your Future! Our Clutter!"" or ""Our Future! Your Clutter!""-- as he's wont to invert them-- he sounds particularly enthused by the prospect of leaving the next generation to inherit a world of shit. Your Future Our Clutter is noticeably bereft of the call-and-response group chants that defined the Fall's mid-1980s classics as well as its most recent successes (see: ""Theme From Sparta FC"", ""What About Us?""). Instead, Smith's free-ranging rants gain focus as the music accrues momentum and menace: ""Bury Pts. 1 + 3"" takes a verse-by-verse ascension from lo-fi to fierce hi-fi stomper, as if to mock those who intentionally use crude production values-- ""a new way of recording,"" Smith sneers, ""a chain around the neck."" But Smith also invests Your Future Our Clutter with moments of surprising sensitivity (disquieting ballad ""Weather Report 2"") and self-aware reflection: During the late-night prowl of ""Chino"", Smith repeats, ""When do I quit?"" Coming from any other grizzled 53-year-old artist, you might interpret that statement as an admission of mortality and humility. But given the irrepressible vitality heard throughout Your Future Our Clutter, it's a question that, I'm happy to report, still has no answer.","Mark E.

In Evening Air,Future Islands,by: Zach Kelly,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a96a5e6ef959693213fb/1:1/w_160/6d9addf4.jpg,2010-05-06 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14177-in-evening-air/,Thrill Jockey,"Future Islands have described their first full-length for Thrill Jockey, recorded after relocating to Baltimore and falling in with Dan Deacon's Wham City collective, as ""post-wave."" Taking cues from early Devo and New Order and replacing the dance-pop movement with rich characterization and storytelling, they've found themselves at a pleasant distance from most formal genre comparisons. Their music is playful but steeped in subtle detail, with both emotional heft and a pungent sense of theatricality. Playing together since their college days in North Carolina but not truly finalizing the band until 2006, the trio seems comfortable bouncing ideas off each other while remaining anchored in their individual roles. J. Gerrit Welmers' synth work reinterprets those crystalline new wave textures and enhances them with feedback and buttery depth, sometimes accented with sparse snippets of programmed drums and rusted samples. But Future Islands avoid cluttering their music, allowing bassist William Cashion (a Peter Hook disciple if there ever was one) to direct the ship with his undulating plunks and strums, stringing the rest of these mercurial details along with him. Any talk of Future Islands is bound to come back to scene-stealing frontman Samuel T. Herring, a dramatic, verbose showman eager to spin each one of these lush but simply-stated orchestrations into something grander. At times wailing like a cross between Tom Waits and the Sea Captain from ""The Simpsons"" (nicely exemplified at the stirring peak of ""An Apology""), occasionally adopting a strange British patois to augment a sort of sing-speak, Herring's presence is over-the-top in just the right way. He often seems overwhelmed by tragedy (usually waxing cryptic about lost love), and brings a great sense of damage and loss-- as well as welcome spots of humor-- to each acrobatic performance. But what he uncovers in the patches of calypso, sci-fi movie noise, and circling synth patterns is often surprisingly heartening. Drawing from a few different traditions while making them their own, Future Islands prove here to be a well-versed group of wild, woolly storytellers.","Baltimore band mixes its own spin on new wave with highly charged drama courtesy of bellowing lead singer Samuel T.

Everyone Is a Ghost,Monster Movie,by: Larry Fitzmaurice,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a98ac0084474cd0c105b/1:1/w_160/29abbdde.jpg,2010-05-06 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14204-everyone-is-a-ghost/,Graveface,"Slowdive broke up in 1995, shortly following the release of the challenging Pygmalion, and most of the members' projects since have leaned toward more accessible sounds. Neil Halstead and Rachel Goswell formed the now-on-hiatus Mojave 3, and Halstead himself has made a few quiet acoustic albums on his own. Guitarist Christian Savill, when working with friend and former Eternal bandmate Sean Hewson in Monster Movie (a project that pre-dates his involvement in Slowdive), hews more closely to Slowdive's later aesthetic. Up to this point, however, the duo's albums have been spotty at best, with momentum-draining tempos and a weakness for maudlin melodies. The timid pallor obscured prime slices of buzzy alt-rock like ""1950da"", from 2004's To the Moon, or ""Winter Is Coming"", from 2002's Last Night Something Happened. Both were tacked onto the end of their respective albums, as if not to disrupt the otherwise downcast mood. On Monster Movie's first album in four years, Everyone Is a Ghost, the obligatory alt-rock cut, ""Bored Beyond Oblivion"", is right in the center of the 10-track collection. The programming change-up comes with a shift in focus. The songs here feel brighter and more energized, at times recalling jagged pop of Brian Eno's early song-oriented records. The sharply melodic guitar lines of opener ""The World Collapsed"" and ""Fall"", for example, recall Robert Fripp's contributions to Here Come the Warm Jets. The bulk of the record is split between moderately fuzzy shoegaze and bleary-eyed folk-pop, and the former fares slightly better, especially during the anthemic burn of ""Silver Knife"" and ""Fall"" and ""Bored Beyond Oblivion""'s sugary distortion. Even midtempo songs like ""How the Dead Live"" and ""In the Morning"" carry a certain shine. There are a few clunkers here-- the worn-out, blaring beats of the title track and the overproduced ""Help Me Make It Right"", specifically-- but Everyone Is a Ghost is, ironically, more full of life than Monster Movie's previous output. It suggests a revitalization within the duo's songwriting, if not simply a necessary change in outlook. It's as if after two decades together, Savill and Hewson are finally enjoying themselves.","Slowdive guitarist Christian Savill's long-running project returns and sounds freshly energized.

The Dogs Are Parading,David Holmes,by: Stuart Berman,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a996ea9e61561daa5a70/1:1/w_160/2365f3ef.jpg,2010-05-06 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14205-the-dogs-are-parading/,Interscope,"After 15 years of making other musicians (and several Steven Soderbergh films) sound better, DJ/producer/soundtrack specialist David Holmes has been focusing on himself. His last album, 2008's The Holy Pictures, was about as introspective as a DJ artist album could get, with his own vocal contributions and explicit references to Holmes' parents and Belfast upbringing. Apparently he's still in a reflective mood, dropping this 29-track career-spanning compilation, split into a best-of collection and a companion disc of remixes and obscurities. But more than just provide a convenient entry point to a man whose work has been enjoyed by millions of filmgoers but whose name is known by relatively few, The Dogs Are Parading lets Holmes do what he does best: weave disparate source material into a cinematic whole. It's just that, instead of pulling from his trusty crates of rare-groove vinyl, he now gets to recontextualize his own records. Always thinking in filmic terms, Holmes applies a flashback-styled narrative to The Dogs Are Parading, starting with his most recent work-- the unreleased acid-disco theme to Soderbergh's 2009 Sasha Grey vehicle, The Girlfriend Experience-- before reaching back deeper into his catalogue. While Holmes has some fun early on juxtaposing the heady, Stone Roses rush of The Holy Pictures' ""I Heard Wonders"" and title track with the gritty go-go grooves  of ""My Mate Paul"" and ""Rodney Yates"" (from 1997's breakthrough Let's Get Killed), he tellingly groups all four selections from his 2000 tour de force, Bow Down to the Exit Sign together in a mid-disc suite. Though Bobby Gillespie's star turn ""Slip Your Skin"" is noticeably absent, the Exit Sign tracks included are still prime examples of the album's masterful synthesis of inner-city claustrophobia (""Living Room"") and widescreen, psychedelic splendor (""Jackson Johnson"", ""Hey Lisa""), and illustrate just how far Holmes had moved beyond the big-beat party music he was initially associated with. The Dogs Are Parading makes no bones about being comprehensive; save for the Sarah Cracknell trip-hop time capsule ""Gone"", Holmes' 1995 debut This Film's Crap, Let's Slash the Seats is ignored, and the collection also includes none of Holmes' signature soundtrack work. But the accompanying remix/rarities disc is something more substantial than just a grab-bag afterthought, and instead plays like an alternate-universe extension to the first. Where Disc One closes with The Holy Pictures' mournful instrumental tribute to Holmes' deceased parents, ""The Ballad of Sarah and Jack"", the second disc leads off with a stirring revision by recent Hot Chip/Robert Wyatt collaborators Geese that transforms the track into a string-swept Dirty Three-style weeper. Equally bold are the competing Arab Strap and Mogwai takes on Let's Get Killed's Gainsbourgian funk workout ""Don't Die Just Yet"", with the former using it as a template for another blue-balled Aidan Moffat monologue, and the latter amplifying the song's underlying menace into murderous noise. Not all of these reworkings live up to the star power of the names attached-- the previously unreleased Kevin Shields mix of ""Living Room"" doesn't touch his MBV Arkestra dismemberment of Primal Scream's ""If They Move, Kill 'Em"" from the same era-- while studio leftovers like the percussive jam ""Lower Orders"" don't distinguish themselves in the absence of Holmes' usual conceptual frameworks. But when it comes to compiling the soundtrack to David Holmes' life, we should expect nothing less from him than the extended director's cut.","Veteran producer and frequent Steven Soderbergh collaborator gathers his best work and his best remixes and obscurities.

Relayted,Gayngs,by: Nate Patrin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a979c0084474cd0c1038/1:1/w_160/9349dbcf.jpg,2010-05-06 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14188-relayted/,Jagjaguwar,"Gripe about hipster irony all you want, but was there ever any point when the indie/punk underground wasn't dealing in smartassed self-parody? There have always been artists who find humor in making certain styles into grotesque caricatures and using them to point out the absurdity, or greatness, in a genre. The punchline works best when the setup's serious enough to work without it. The problem of irony comes when you're dealing with a setup that most people will probably mistake for the punchline itself. And once you've been tipped to the tone of Relayted, the debut album from the two-dozen-plus-member supergroup Gayngs, well, good luck coming to terms with the slow-jam soft-rock pastiche that's just been dropped on you. Air had a tricky enough sell of it 12 years ago when they tried to convince indie kids that Moog-lounge AM pop was cool. And if the jet-set 1970s fromage of Moon Safari was a tricky kind of chic, imagine it dialed a decade ahead into mid-80s Lite FM fare. If you're not rolling your eyes yet, be patient: You have about 28 seconds before the album's first Skinemax saxophone wail. But Gayngs take this stuff seriously, and if you concentrate really hard, maybe you could, too. It helps that pretty much everybody involved in the band has bona fides, whether in Minneapolis' electro-pop scene (brainchild Ryan Olson of Digitata; Zack Coulter and Adam Hurlburt of Solid Gold; members of Lookbook) or North Carolina folk-rock (the Rosebuds' Ivan Howard; all three members of Megafaun). That elbow-ribbing saxophone actually comes courtesy of Michael Lewis, from much-lauded Twin Cities jazz trio Happy Apple. And there are a lot of strong voices that fade in and out of this thing, too. P.O.S. absolutely kills it on the tense, Pendergrass-gone-Portishead slow-boil of ""No Sweat"", with fellow Doomtree alumna Dessa providing an almost subliminal background counterpoint. And the distant, breathy vocal that sounds like it's emanating from the sunset-hued beach of some early Michael Mann film makes leadoff track ""The Gaudy Side of Town"" sound disarmingly earnest. That's Justin Vernon of Bon Iver. Dude apparently listens to Bone Thugs, go figure. So we're looking at a lot of serious-artist personnel for an album that might seem pretty conceptually farcical otherwise. And while some aspects of this album seem at least somewhat detrimentally tongue-in-cheek-- word has it that every track was recorded at 69 BPM, which does leaden the energy levels a bit-- Relayted doesn't stumble strictly because of its soft-rock and indie-soul leanings. Far from it: The original core trio of Olson, Coulter, and Hurlburt envisioned some kind of tribute to the legacy of 10cc, which explains all the ""I'm Not in Love"" vocal reverb and a straightfaced cover of 10cc vets Godley & Creme's 1985 single ""Cry"". And it sounds credible, even when it's transmuted into jittery, guitar-addled new wave (""Faded High"") or Blade Runnerish soul-jazz (""Ride""). It's only when the extended ether-frolic vibe is rattled by some misplaced short-and-sharp pop-length numbers-- the mid-album stretch of ""False Bottom"", ""The Beatdown"", and ""Crystal Rope"" skews a bit too forceful-- that the seams actually start to show. So Relayted is both better than it had any right to be, given the concept, and about as good as you could expect from the musicians involved. It has all the signs of a gag that got out of hand-- three guys from Minneapolis bantering about soft-rock namedrops who eventually found themselves surrounded by enough smart, likeminded musicians that it somehow wound up destined to sound at least somewhat heartfelt. It's a joke told in reverse, with a potentially cheesy setup that often comes with a surprisingly poignant payoff. Go into this expecting irony, and it might turn your stomach. Take it sincerely, and it'll hit you about a foot higher.","Folkie and electro supergroup-- including Bon Iver, Megafaun, members of the Rosebuds, and leader Ryan Olson-- tackle 80s R&B and Lite FM fare.

Cosmogramma,Flying Lotus,by: Joe Colly,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a9865e6ef95969321426/1:1/w_160/9586ed22.jpg,2010-05-06 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14198-cosmogramma/,Warp,"Talking to us over the summer about his then-forthcoming album, Steven Ellison said he felt like he was progressing as a producer. ""I'm finally getting to the point where I can make the kind of records... that I wanted to make when I was younger, things that I dreamed about making,"" he told us. That sounds modest-- he's been persistently pursuing a singular vision for years now-- but his first two albums did share common traits with his forebears. Even the excellent Los Angeles from 2008 took some of its cues from J Dilla, one of Ellison's idols. But with Cosmogramma, it's not enough anymore to talk about Ellison's sound as ""post-Dilla"" or even ""post hip-hop."" It's his sound now. Indeed, Cosmogramma is an intricate, challenging record that fuses his loves-- jazz, hip-hop, videogame sounds, IDM-- into something unique. It's an album in the truest sense. Even on Los Angeles, which hung together well as a full-length, there were moments you could pick out as singles or highlights-- the distorted pop of ""Camel"" or the maniacal electro-house of ""Parisian Goldfish"". But Cosmogramma is conceived as a movement-- bits of one song spill into the next, and its individual tracks make the most sense in the context of what surrounds them. In this sense, it feels almost like an avant-garde jazz piece, and so it takes more than a few listens to sink in-- one or two spins and you're still at the tip of the iceberg. Jazz is a big influence on the record, and it's a good place to start talking about the individual sections that make up the whole. Ellison is, of course, the nephew of jazz great Alice Coltrane and has said in interviews that his albums are in part dedicated to her. That's clear on Cosmogramma, as there are distinct passages that pursue an elaborate kind of digital jazz and the album is constructed to move through different sections, as one of Coltrane's might. There are roughly three of these passages-- the first is an aggressive three-song suite based loosely on videogame sounds. On ""Nose Art"", FlyLo puts raygun squiggles alongside woozy synths, grinding mechanical noises, and about 10 other sonic elements. Like much of the album, it sounds almost frustratingly unstable until you hear it a few times and the pieces begin to interlock and congeal. True to its title, Cosmogramma then moves through a heady astral stretch and finally a more downtempo jazz-heavy period. The latter partly serves as a necessary breather from the complicated sounds earlier on. FlyLo shows ridiculous talent in each section-- the things he can do with and to beats just aren't common. In ""Zodiac Shit"", he makes a heavy, loping bass thump sputter out on cue, creating a physical rumbling quality. The beat of ""Computer Face // Pure Being"" trips over itself again and again like clothes tumbling in a dryer. These aren't just tricks-- in each case they push the song toward a groove. And it's not just beats: ""Satelllliiiiiiite"" is as dreamy as anything FlyLo's done to date, its distorted vocal samples and steam-building arrangement not unlike something out of Burial's repertoire and frankly just as good. The song that will likely get the most attention here is ""...And the World Laughs With You"", a collaboration with Thom Yorke. Obviously an electronic-music fan, Yorke has done these guest spots before (for Modeselektor and others) and with such a high-profile contributor it's easy to make the song all about him. But FlyLo doesn't pay Yorke any undue deference, just treats his vocals like another element to manipulate and weave into the mix. It's so subtle, in fact, that if you're not paying close attention you might miss his appearance altogether. It's this level of confidence and commitment to his vision that ultimately makes Cosmogramma so fascinating. FlyLo is working at the height of his creative powers right now, and the scary thing is it's reasonable to think he could get better.","The L.A. producer's head music, which pulls from jazz, hip-hop, videogame sounds, IDM, and more, is more dense and rewarding than ever.

Victorian America,Emily Jane White,by: David Raposa,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a991ea9e61561daa5a66/1:1/w_160/2fc57dec.jpg,2010-05-05 06:00:04,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14209-victorian-america/,Milan,"Emily Jane White's singing voice, wispy and sweet but undercut with an alluring world-weary weight, lends itself to brow-furrowing introspection and rustic tales of woe. And there are more than a few songs like this on her second album, Victorian America. She doesn't go out of her way to invoke a comparison to Cat Power, but during certain moments it's difficult to not notice the flattering (albeit striking) resemblance. If dour tracks like ""Never Dead"" and ""The Baby"" don't outright mimic Chan Marshall's indomitable style, they're at least more than a little beholden to her. To White's credit, though, she doesn't let these impressions linger-- even at their most bathetic, her songs are buoyed with helpings of strings, pedal steel, and other instrumental touches that play their part without overstating their presence. The title track, a string-swept ballad that makes references to Hurricane Katrina, is a perfect example. Instead of overselling the drama, White maintains a certain distance from the emotion the song conveys, singing the lyrics in a stately and precise fashion. The musical accompaniment ably mimics this elegant pose, turning the song into something much more affecting. In comparison, an elegiac tear-soaked ballad like ""The Ravens"" opts to fully immerse itself in the tragedy of its broken-hearted subjects. ""And so I walk the line,"" White sings, ""to the beating of this never-ending lie,"" detailing in painstaking poetic fashion a love that was destined to die. An album full of these sorts of lilting sorrows would be just fine (if a little samey), but thankfully there's more to Victorian America than that. The wry and humorous ""The Country Life"", with White striking the carefree pose of a been-there done-that woman who's still not done living her life, is a pleasant departure from the album's overall weightiness. The same goes for ""Liza"", a track whose talk of warnings and death is belied by a spry gait (and a pretty sly ""Be My Baby"" nod). And even when White bites off more than she can chew (as on the pseudo-song-suite ""Stairs"") or tries on poses that don't quite fit (like the heavy electrified stomp of ""Red Dress""), the adventurous spirit of such detours more than makes up for their shortcomings. It's heartening to see an artist as young as Emily Jane White recognize and exploit her strengths; it's even more heartening to see her try something apart from those strengths, failure be damned.","California singer-songwriter mixes folky tales of woe delivered in a stripped-down setting with stately songs backed by lush arrangements.

A Little Big,Bobby and Blumm,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a9785e6ef95969321413/1:1/w_160/4b173c21.jpg,2010-05-05 06:00:03,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14187-a-little-big/,Sound of a Handshake,"The Berlin-based musician F.S. Blumm has a very particular style. He uses live instrumentation to create understated tunes-- some jazzy, others austere-- that suggest folktronica without any glitch-tracks or other electronics. He seems to prize his independence, and cordons it off with ampersands in his frequent collaborations: Sack & Blumm, with Harald ""Sack"" Ziegler, and Rebresch & Blumm, with Rininat Rebresch. By implication, he disavows the notion that collaboration produces a collective entity. Working together is all good, but the kid stays in the picture. So naturally, Blumm is instantly recognizable on A Little Big, the second LP of English-language music to issue from his project with the singer Ellinor Blixt. His knack for rococo, effortless-feeling melodies is in his playful guitar work, which, along with light percussion and duet vocals, dominates the album. His flickering arpeggios suit Blixt's airy voice perfectly. The overall effect is more attuned to the indie pop of Blixt's native Sweden, and the careful, coy arrangements are citizens only of Blummland. If you're familiar with his solo work, this is exactly how you'd expect his songwriting project to sound: Dreamy and lackadaisical, like a European version of Luna. Bobby and Blumm join a long line of sweet dual-gendered crooners-- Sonny & Cher, the Captain & Tennille, Stars, the xx-- who rely on an echo chamber effect to enhance their music's intimacy. Solo devotional songs float off into abstraction; their targets could be anyone or no one. With duets, we can pretend the singers are addressing each other, even if they're not, and the poignancy of the emotion becomes focused and present. Blumm's wonderful line on ""Some Sweets"", ""In your arms, I push repeat,"" would be generally appealing in any case, but trailed with Blixt's whispers, it becomes specific-- not any old arms, not some symbolic arms, but your arms. It feels like stumbling into the middle of a private embrace. The album's consistency is a potential limitation, though-- little distinguishes one song from the next. Extremely muted horns, keyboards, and chimes color various songs but each time, you're getting essentially the same thing: chiming guitar melodies, mid-tempo vocals, and a feeling of breezy exactitude. As a result, A Little Big isn't the sort of album you swoon hard for and listen to often. Instead, it clings to the back of your mind, slipping into rotation less frequently. Some listeners may find the patient, low-key vibe monotonous. But those who can still make time for a modest, charming little record stuffed with arresting details will be amply rewarded.","Berlin-based F.S. Blumm continues to create understated, austere tunes, often in collaboration. Here he teams with Swedish singer Ellinor Blixt.

Bedford Park,The Infesticons,by: Nate Patrin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a94d5e6ef959693213be/1:1/w_160/303b245e.jpg,2010-05-05 06:00:02,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14154-bedford-park/,Big Dada,"In 2000, back when the Black Eyed Peas were merely a poor man's Jurassic 5 and Sean Combs was still Puffy, underground hip-hop agitator Mike Ladd gathered up an army of art-rap cohorts to create the Infesticons. Their album Gun Hill Road, a concept record about a group of b-boy foot soldiers defending their Brooklyn turf against the encroachments of a horde of ""jiggy"" invaders (remember that pejorative?), was a shining example of how accessibly avant-garde indie rap could be at the turn of the millennium, all engaging logorrhea flow and death-jazz beats. Round two of the stated Infesticons trilogy was given over to their enemies/alter egos the Majesticons, whose 2003 Beauty Party was a parody of gentrified hustler culture drenched in curdled Moët. As high-concept three-part genre-deconstruction epics went, this war seemed like it'd build to a cataclysmic conclusion on the final album. Just one problem: that final album has arrived seven full years after that last Majesticons salvo, and an entire decade after the whole scuffle began. Beauty Party was initially branded as a goof on chart rap. But after all this time, its crass, synthesized club-rap buzz sounds-- whether by design or accident-- like a sharp dissection of so-called hipster rap, pseudo-Diplo rather than mock-Diddy. And that war was waged what seems like ages ago. The outro track of Bedford Park practically admits as much, a dazed Ladd emerging from the rubble to the shell-shocked realization that ""I don't even think they remember... there ain't even underground hip hop or Top 40 hip hop no more, it's just bright rainbow and neon shit everywhere. Electro rap! I'm so fucking lost."" So with the real-world inspirations of the Infesticons trilogy warped in ways few would have imagined back when Gun Hill Road dropped, Bedford Park has to shift focus a bit. And by ""shift,"" I mean ""lose"": despite the name on the cover and the occasional reminder that there's some kind of conflict going, this album has a lot more thematically in common with Ladd's personal, idiosyncratic work on albums like Nostalgialator and Father Divine. Concerns over hip-hop's tenuous grasp on reality and the commodification of culture crop up occasionally, and ""Give Em Anthem"" does a good job cracking wise about American Apparel fashion, famous-and-broke aspirations, and 1980s cartoon nostalgia. But there's more detailed narratives of relationship issues than anything having to do with the struggle between hip-hop as art and rap as commerce. And Ladd, along with MC collaborators Juice Aleem and Creature, seems to have left his usual tightly-woven language at the door; lyrics here lean heavily on stripped-down, hook-heavy repetition and entry-level metaphors. But going into this album without much prior knowledge of Ladd's back catalog or the Infesticons mythos might cast it in a better light. If Bedford Park is meant to have an undercurrent of sly meta-commentary on the indie-punk relationship with hip-hop, it does a stand-up job of it, ricocheting from new wave/blog house tweaks to tense TV on the Radio harmonizing to wonky bass spasms, all the way to acoustic guitar-driven antifolk. None of it really coheres into anything in particular, but the songs sound comfortable in their genre-hopping skins. And in the end, maybe it's that loosely rooted yet roughly sincere eclecticism that stands as the real end result of all the fighting that's gone down before. That aforementioned outro track concludes with Ladd surveying the brightly colored debris in front of him and admitting ""I don't mind it. I feel kinda funny…"" before cracking up. Just like the rest of the album, it's hard to tell if the Infesticons are proposing armistice or simply admitting defeat.","Underground hip-hop agitator Mike Ladd brings back his Infesticons project for the third part of a high-concept trilogy.

More!,Booka Shade,by: Mike Orme,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a980c0084474cd0c1047/1:1/w_160/1bb85315.jpg,2010-05-05 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14194-more/,Get Physical,"Booka Shade have reached a point where pretty much everything they do-- both as musicians and heads of dance imprint Get Physical-- are scrutinized. And in the past few years, the scrutiny hasn't always been positive. The duo's last record, The Sun & Neon Light, found them out in front of the decks aiming to craft a crossover techno-pop album. Depending on who you asked it was either a brave experiment and stab at something new or a frustrating move from a duo responsible for some of techno's best 21st century tracks. Whatever the case, Booka Shade's stock is down after Neon Light, a sometimes brooding affair that delivered an attempt at growing an organic heart in the midst of their robotic gullets. The guys even sang on the thing. More! is a re-donning of their producer/percussionist hats. Bona fide beats dominate the record and the vocals are sparse and handled by guests like Yello and Chelonis R. Jones. But, at the same time, there truly is more on this record-- there are more electro-inspired keyboard lines and mood changes. This record can't be called ""minimal."" That said, the tracks here are missing the melodic weight that lent Booka Shade singles like ""In White Rooms"" or ""Body Language"" their crossover panache. Those synthesizer lines-- once delayed, drunken, and enigmatic-- helped tracks feel spontaneous (a feeling reinforced by Booka Shade playing live percussion on stage). Synths throughout the record are more punctual, like more like a Berlin train than a gyrating body. This facet seems to be used even to comic effect, as on the opening ""Havanna Sex Dwarf"", whose staccato squelches and robot singing deadpan the unspoken words novelty song. It's certainly a weird cut to begin an album by a group usually constrained to the darkness of the club or a late-night living room. The record really gets going with the brooding ""Regenerate"", but from there it's all pretty standard fare, with four-on-the-floor beats at inconsistent levels of innovation and a few Kraftwerkian synth lines ping-ponging throughout the tracks. Jones turns in an uncharacteristically low-key performance on ""Bad Love"", which might have passed for an early 80s R&B hit. Yello vocalist Dieter Meier grumbles his way through ""Divine"", not requiring a government-issued ID to remind you that he's 65. But for the most part, the beats and the synths are the stars of the show here. They're not as compelling as in the past-- maybe only four albums into their career, the duo is preferring to color inside the lines. But for all those hits and misses, fans will keep listening, keep scrutinizing. Booka Shade gained that blessing, or the curse, as the result of consistent innovation.","The famed Berlin techno duo return to their producer-centric roots after a one-album detour into crossover techno-pop.

Together,The New Pornographers,by: Matthew Perpetua,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a9815e6ef9596932141d/1:1/w_160/e2836c80.jpg,2010-05-05 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14195-together/,Matador,"As a project, the New Pornographers have more in common with a blockbuster film franchise than a typical rock band. All of their albums follow a similar crowd-pleasing blueprint, and the group's four primary vocalists consistently fall into familiar roles: A.C. Newman is the everyman protagonist, Neko Case is the sassy dame, Dan Bejar is the lovable rogue, and Kathryn Calder is the demure ingenue. The logistics of managing so many successful careers makes each album an event along the lines of a sequel, with all the corresponding expectations, escalation of stakes, and more recently, diminishing returns. The first three New Pornographers records stand as an outstanding trilogy of brainy, hyperactive power-pop; Challengers, their fourth LP, left listeners disappointed and confused, wondering why the group had largely abandoned up-tempo thrills. If only because it rocks slightly more on a superficial level, the New Pornographers' fifth album, Together, will inevitably be labeled a return to form. In reality, Newman and his partners are still developing a style that began with Twin Cinema cuts like ""The Bleeding Heart Show"" and ""These Are the Fables"" and came into full bloom on Challengers. Newman has shifted his focus from urgent, high-velocity rave-ups to mid-tempo tunes with an ornate, cinematic grandeur. When the band rock out on Together, as they do on ""Your Hands (Together)"" and ""Up in the Dark"", it's mostly a matter of hitting rhythmic hooks with a very strong emphasis, like ending a sentence with a dozen exclamation points. Compared to Challengers, Together is sunnier and has fewer slow songs. However, whereas Challengers' gentle moments opened up the group's stylistic range, Together's quietest track ""Valkyrie and the Roller Disco"" feels like a speed bump in the middle of an album that could have used an extra jolt of energy. Newman is more successful when he merges his taste for symphonic bombast with his skill for huge choruses (""Moves"", ""We End Up Together"") or when he holds back from unleashing the band's full force on the springy, cheerful Calder showcase ""Sweet Talk, Sweet Talk"". As Newman continues to explore new ways of writing for his ensemble, Dan Bejar's contributions find him making better use of the the band's distinct resources. Whereas his songs had sometimes seemed arbitrarily wedged into New Pornographers albums for the sake of acting as Newman's foil, Bejar's material on Together is more of a piece with the record's tone and character. ""Silver Jenny Dollar"" and ""If You Can't See My Mirrors"" are lush yet breezy, and provide a welcome contrast with Newman's more overwrought arrangements. ""Daughters of Sorrow"" takes full advantage of the band's elaborate harmonies for a majestic vocal crescendo. All three songs contrast Bejar's voice with that of Neko Case, wisely exploiting a chemistry that had not yet been fully explored. Case, despite taking the spotlight on the stand-out tracks ""Crash Years"" and ""My Shepherd"" and being present through most of the songs, is mostly under-utilized here. Whereas her huge, brassy voice had been deployed as the vocal equivalent of a fuzz pedal on classics like ""The Laws Have Changed"" and ""Letter From an Occupant"", she has since been relegated to mid-tempo numbers and ballads. She carries those songs well, but it's not a far cry from what she does on her solo albums, and it tosses out the novelty of placing her alt-country powerhouse voice in the context of hard-charging rock songs. Newman has done better in servicing Calder, whose delicate, princessy tone is well suited to his smaller, less assertive compositions. Aside from ""Valkyrie"", Together is a solid collection of well-crafted songs. However, in spite of the quality, the album isn't entirely satisfying. To some extent, this is simply a case of a band capable of greatness merely turning in a pretty good record. The real problem is more subtle. Though Newman's songs have become more melodramatic and sentimental in recent years, his lyrics have remained rather cryptic. It's clear that some of the songs are addressing something intense and personal, but he keeps the listener at arm's length, which in turn discourages identification and emotional connection. Newman's cerebral wordplay and mythic allusions worked well in zippy power-pop songs, but the grand gestures of his newer material require more heart and less brain. Bejar, who is no less arty and obscure in his lyrics, can pull off his more pretentious moves with raw charisma and self-aware wit, but Newman can't help but come across as a sincere straight-arrow type. He puts so much effort into subverting that quality in his voice, but at this point in his career, it's something he ought to consider embracing.","The Canadian supergroup continues its shift from urgent, high-velocity rave-ups to mid-tempo tunes with an ornate, cinematic grandeur.

Cracked Love & Other Drugs,Unnatural Helpers,by: David Raposa,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a988c0084474cd0c1056/1:1/w_160/45fcf03c.jpg,2010-05-04 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14199-cracked-love-other-drugs/,Hardly Art,"Unnatural Helpers like to keep things short and to-the-point, so let me try and do the same. Cracked Love & Other Drugs is the second full-length for these folks, the first with Sub Pop imprint Hardly Art. Dean Whitmore (who also played drums for the Intelligence) is the brains and the beat behind this operation, as well as being the group's only constant. Unnatural Helpers membership is fluid, taking whomever it can from other Seattle-area groups to fill out its ranks. They like to play garage rock, though some might call it punk rock. At any rate, the music of Unnatural Helpers definitely rocks, and it does so with efficiency-- the 15 tracks that comprise Cracked say their peace in only 25 minutes. Being from the Pacific Northwest, it shouldn't come as a surprise that Unnatural Helpers' music recalls like-minded Seattle groups past and present. Of course, any group banging out tunes like these folks do (regardless of geography) are liable to earn themselves ill-fitting comparisons to Nuggets stalwarts the Sonics, though the Helpers do bring to mind that group's dirty R&B swagger at times. They can also approximate the Wipers' rip-roaring guitar sound (see ""Brave Dumb Face""), as well as A-Frames' brittle brutality (on ""Vox Humana""). And with Kurt Bloch recording the album, it'd be remiss to not mention the powerful punk-pop of the Fastbacks. But while Cracked Love brings hooks aplenty-- hell, ""Useful Things"" is all hook-- having Whitmore's gruff and grimy voice out in front doesn't really bring the sweetness the way Kim Warnick did for Bloch's bunch. If there is a vocalist Whitmore's taking his cues from, it's without a doubt Mudhoney's Mark Arm. The words to these songs beg to be sung with the same smirk and bemused disgust that Arm perfected-- ""My looks are killing me/ But I'm never gonna give it up""-- and Whitmore doesn't disappoint. Whether he's making like the world's most jaded wallflower (in the lyric quoted previously, from ""Sunshine / Pretty Girls""), claiming he didn't know ""She Was Your Girlfriend"" (""It would take a real cool sleuth to blow her [#script:http://pitchfork.com/media/backend/js/tiny_mce/themes/advanced/langs/en.js]|||||| cover""), or displaying an abnormal amount of pride in taking his licks in ""Claim It Mine"", Whitmore comes off like the coolest loser in the room. Cracked Love might sound too clean and sharp to comfortably fit in with their modern-day hot-shit garagey counterparts like Thee Oh Sees or Times New Viking (""blame"" Bloch's unfussy production for that blessing), but when it comes to talking about who's got the goods in this particular arena, this album shows that Unnatural Helpers deserve to be part of that conversation.","Steeped in Pac NW garage and punk, this wonderful Hardly Art band recalls everyone from the Wipers to the Fastbacks to Mudhoney.

""David you'll always be a baby brother/ You'll always be a mother's son/ You'll always be somebody's favorite pupil/ But you'll never be a man that I want,"" his social-climbing paramour coolly explains. Ouch. ""Scene"" leads off the trio's first Moshi Moshi LP, Instant Coffee Baby (originally released in 2008 in the UK and now making its U.S. debut), and it gives a sneak-peek of what you're in for: keenly observed domestic tableaus, uniquely English perspectives on hubris and buffoonery, and ample insta-quotes. Over the course of 13 tracks, Tattersall dribbles peach juice on his in-laws' sofa, steals a coffee machine, picks a fight with a marine (the marine wins), and claims he can write a better song than John Lennon. Comedy would be the path of least resistance, but Tattersall's a more subtle storyteller. He describes, for example, the rising sun as a ""pack of orange spaniels"" and awkward joy as ""a porcupine/ Sleeping on a waterbed"". Like sometime collaborators and fellow logophiles the Mountain Goats, the Wave Pictures write songs for fans of songwriting. The Wave Pictures share something else with John Darnielle's outfit. Their lyrics may be delicious, but the voice with which they're delivered-- an off-pitch mash of Jonathan Richman, Gordan Gano and Morrissey-- can go down like a chunk of gristle. There's something to be said for the poignancy of Tattersall's cracked warble, but while a velvet croon isn't essential for folk-pop singalongs like ""Friday Night in Loughborough"", it would definitely make ""Red Wine Teeth""'s blue-eyed soul more p [#script:http://pitchfork.com/media/backend/js/tiny_mce/themes/advanced/langs/en.js]|||||| alatable. Depending on your taste, Tattersall's vocals could be a deal-breaker. Not surprisingly, Coffee's best when it's flush with rockabilly rhythms, sharp melodies, and the band's enthusiastic instrumental solos. For this reason, the Wave Pictures' less-effusive next LP, If You Leave It Alone (which is being released concurrently with Coffee), isn't as fun or immediate. Both albums were recorded quickly and cheaply, but Alone has a slightly brooding demeanor and folkier sound. This approach works best on rippling alt-country pastiche ""Canary Wharf"" and whimsical, nursery school-nostalgic songs like ""Bumble Bee"" and ""Bye Bye Bubble Belly"". But not so much on the long, dreary title track. Until now, the Wave Pictures, who have been playing together for almost 10 years, have stuck to their side of the pond. It's not hard to see why. Astute lyrics sung in an English accent have always been a tough sell in the U.S. If it helps, Americans might want to think about them this way. When asked in a recent interview to describe the group's sound, Tattersall replied, ""it's a band with songs, and guitar solos.""","UK outfit's latest is being released in the U.S. alongside a 2008 LP, introducing a promising band that brings to mind the wit of Art Brut.

A Book of Songs for Anne Marie,Baby Dee,by: Grayson Currin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a97eea9e61561daa5a47/1:1/w_160/988e836c.jpg,2010-05-04 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14192-a-book-of-songs-for-anne-marie/,Drag CityTin Angel,"To do right by A Book of Songs for Anne Marie, the intriguing second LP by Baby Dee for Drag City, it'd be best to unload the Cleveland songwriter's significant baggage asap: Baby Dee is the harpist and pianist on Drag City that is not Joanna Newsom, though both sing as if they delight in discovering new corners and nuances of their own voice. Baby Dee is also the transgender singer that is not her longtime collaborator, Antony Hegarty, though both write with a wonderfully transcendental trust in the way love can reshape our world. And, lastly, Baby Dee is not her mentor and collaborator David Tibet, though her contributions to his Current 93 have been profound and, as she puts it, Tibet was the ""patient and forgiving surrogate father"" to these dozen Songs. Dee has long been saddled by these and other obvious comparisons-- Andrew W.K., Will Oldham, Marc Almond, the Dresden Dolls. She's made that observation in interviewers, and critics continue to confirm it in new reviews. Above the lovely breeze of her harp and a string arrangement, she finally protests it on ""Black But Comely"", explaining that she's more than an assemblage of associations. Indeed, Dee's story is one of the most fascinating you'll ever hear in indie rock. Dee's sex change and her instrumental selection aren't the only hooks: She's worked as a tree pruner, a Coney Island sideshow, a church organist, a street performer, a dance club entertainer, and an arranger for the first incarnation of Antony's the Johnsons. She now lives alone in Cleveland in her parents' quaint house, surrounded by a few cats, her harp, and Andrew W.K.'s grand piano. Her personality is warm and frantic, like that of a grandmother who revels in explaining the brightest and darkest corners of existence. How could you not want to hear this person? Songs arrives more than six years in the making, and it's the sort of record that-- both for its enchanting arrangements and its presiding theme of using love to fend off evil, sadness, or, at the very least, darkness and cold-- should finally help Dee earn notice equal to that of her contemporaries. The title was originally given to a batch of seven quickly recorded tunes released in 2004 on Tibet's Durtro label. All of those numbers survive here, but they're reinvented by a six-member chamber ensemble that includes producer and arranger Maxim Moston. His violin playing-- a perfect mix of frailty and humor-- is a delicate foil for Dee's vocals, while the band's horns and strings web around her harp to form its perfect bed. A French horn, for instance, peeks from behind the harp's bass note on ""Endless Night"", adding a spotlight to each of Dee's epiphanies. In her hopefulness, broken words find usefulness, and bastard children earn redemption. ""Love is stronger than death/ More jealous than the tomb,"" she vows one track later, sending the words ahead of her stop-and-start harp, a shield taking the lead into the world's battles. Dee, now 57, has seen that world from perspectives most couldn't imagine. Her voice, a knotty beauty drunk on personality, shows signs of those experiences. Songs highlights its most interesting aspects in turns. On ""Lilacs"", where Dee sings of ""lovers found"" to signify the approach of eternal spring, her robust tone moves in tumbles, slipping in front of and behind the meter like a smiling child skipping through a field on a sunny day. During ""As Morning Holds a Star"", her voice is at first impossibly sad, choking on its own nervous laughter as Dee notices that nature seems out of order. ""When robins wake a winter day/ There must be some mistake,"" she trembles. At the song's other end, though, her voice lifts-- as faint at first as a ray of light passing through a storm cloud, but then grand and resplendent. ""No more night skies/ I've got a sunrise,"" she boasts, repeating that last word four times. Good for her-- after all, it's time this sometimes obtuse, always evocative work finds a wider light.","Drag City's other harpist/pianist releases her intriguing second LP, which should earn her notice equal to that of her contemporaries.

Omni,Minus the Bear,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a9355e6ef95969321392/1:1/w_160/13b20770.jpg,2010-05-04 06:00:01,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14138-omni/,Dangerbird,"Indie rock has often had an uneasy relationship with sex. While some bands in that realm are capable of carnality and seduction, many would rather let the sonics do the work, and lyrically, it can be tough to reconcile base sensations with music that prides itself on its intelligence. In this context comes Omni, a record of lite-funk trappings and lyrics about the pleasures of the flesh that would be sketchy enough as a debut from a band trying to get that Maroon 5 money. But for a veteran band like Minus the Bear, newly signed to Dangerbird Records and known in the past for knotted, prog-spiked populist indie, it's a move of baffling awkwardness. You confront that awkwardness from the first second of lead single ""My Time"". It's overproduced as hell, filled with all manner of electro doodads and backmasking effects, but it also boasts an immediacy and pop smarts heretofore unheard from the band. Unfortunately, that directness applies to the lyrics as well, and they simply cannot be ignored. During the verses, Jake Snider cops a parody Greg Dulli pose (""you taste like sweet wine... sweat rolls down your thigh"") while the hook plays out like a straight-faced version of ""puttin' in work"" babymakers like Death From Above 1979's ""Sexy Results"" or Flight of the Conchord's ""Business Time"". As with most of Omni, the issue lies in the incongruity of the delivery. You don't need to be a soul-papa belter in order to talk about the passion, but Snider's vocals never simmer, smolder, or steam. Instead, they just kind of lay there like a rumpled polo shirt, adding a creepy dimension to the keg-hovering come-ons. At least those fare better than the midsection when Snider changes his focus to chronicles of debauched nightlife. With its thinly-veiled references to cocaine and illicit blowjobs, ""Into the Mirror"" is nothing short of an attempt to write the American Apparel set's ""Life in the Fastlane"", but once again, Snider's fugue-like state makes him sound like a disinterested outsider instead of someone invested in his story. Minus the Bear boasted enough technical proficiency in the past to make the ""prog"" tag stick without making chops the foremost priority, but they mostly straighten up and fly right here with only the occasional waka-chika rhythm to throw things for a loop. Seeing as he helmed similar brass-ring grabs from Manchester Orchestra and the Whigs (as well as My Morning Jacket's Evil Urges), you figure the band knew what they were getting into when they tapped Joe Chiccarelli to produce. Omni does in fact have the pop and sheen that would make the most anonymous of 1980s corporate rockers proud. But for the most part, the combination of drop-D riffs and antiseptic production conjures a grunge band covering the Police. And yet, in a weird way Omni is actually kind of admirable. Jessica Suarez expressed disappointment here that 2007's Planet of Ice was neither mission statement or monstrosity, that the time had come for Minus The Bear to dare to be great, even if it meant risking disaster. And credit Minus the Bear for aiming to be something than just another competent indie band. So, yeah-- I'd prefer Omni to be a good record, but there are good records everywhere. This is the sort of rare and spectacular clusterfuck that makes our music-consuming lives more interesting.","The indie rock veterans return with a slicker, more radio-friendly album that takes some troubling lyrical turns.

Heaven Is Whenever,The Hold Steady,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a98213d197565213989b/1:1/w_160/3952be0c.jpg,2010-05-04 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14196-heaven-is-whenever/,Rough TradeVagrant,"The Hold Steady's latest album begins with ""The Sweet Part of the City"", a number about kids meeting up under theater marquees, drinking until they run out of booze, partying till the cops come, listening to music all night, and making runs for more liquor. The song is quintessential Craig Finn, especially when he reveals a twist ending in the final lines: ""We were bored so we started a band,"" he admits. ""We'd like to play for you."" The line comes across like a stinging punchline, sad and self-aware: Kids start bands to tell their stories, yet their stories are often the same. They play music to feel transcendent, to feel larger than their mundane circumstances-- so why isn't the crowd paying attention? Coming from a band so rooted in notions of community and classic rock, ""The Sweet Part of the City"" seems to acknowledge that the Hold Steady realize their function as a liaison between the underground and the mainstream. They're trying hard to achieve widespread appeal while remaining embedded in the scenes they've been chronicling for half a decade. Heaven Is Whenever loiters in the same dives, clubs, and party houses as their previous albums and chronicles the sagas of similar hoodrats, townies, gamblers, waitresses, and girlfriends. Meanwhile, the band has graduated to larger venues, festival appearances, and an avid fanbase that shouts along with every word. The distance between subject and band has never been greater than it is on this album, and these new songs just don't hit as hard. Finn still writes street-level narratives with a large cast of characters all united by their dire circumstances, and on previous albums, he managed to insert himself into their stories as a hapless buyer, a reckless hook-up, an accidental witness, or a reluctant participant. His first-person involvement gave him first-hand access to the kids, and he built songs out of stray phrases and details that explained their lingo and motivations. But on Heaven Is Whenever, he sounds one or two steps removed, less active in their sagas and less concerned with the particulars of the characters. Now he's shooting for the bigger picture instead of collecting the persuasive details and the convincing slang, which leaves these songs sounding largely uninhabited. Finn sings in first person throughout the album, gesturing at character and point of view, but the perspective from which these songs are written is neither entirely convincing nor consistent. The band tries to punch up these songs as much as possible, adding intrusive synths and backing vocals, but they don't always achieve the fervor necessary to make songs like ""A Slight Discomfort"" uplifting. Tad Kubler gets a few good riffs in on ""The Weekenders"" and ""Rock Problems"", but the lackluster production blunts their impact. Elsewhere, the music is strangely staid and anonymous, lacking the drama that Franz Nicolay-- the mustachioed keyboard player who proved surprisingly divisive among fans-- could add with a simple piano flourish. ""Barely Breathing"" breaks into an out-of-nowhere clarinet solo, but that element of surprise is the most notable thing about it. Still, there are strong moments here: That languid slide guitar on ""The Sweet Part of the City"", the shout-along hook of ""Rock Problems"", and the hammering chorus of ""Our Whole Lives"". ""The Weekenders"" musters a moody, desperate urgency that makes it sound like the dark sequel to ""Chips Ahoy"", with its hints of clairvoyance. But hearing the band hit this sort of stride is nothing out of the ordinary; hearing them sound so directionless and tired not only sounds new, but suggests that the Hold Steady aren't holding steady. Despite the confidence of that opening track, Heaven Is Whenever sounds like a transitional album, hopefully paving the way for something stronger, more cohesive, more specific. In the meantime, this remains an uncharacteristically weak effort by a good band that may be in danger of running out of stories.","The Hold Steady attempt to balance widespread appeal while remaining embedded in the scenes they've been chronicling for half a decade.

MCMLXXX,Lazer Crystal,by: Jonathan Garrett,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a975ea9e61561daa5a35/1:1/w_160/47ae909d.jpg,2010-05-03 06:00:04,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14182-mcmlxxx/,Thrill Jockey,"Chicago trio Lazer Crystal indulge themselves on the highly conceptual MCMLXXX. That's not surprising from a band whose mission statement reads, in part: ""to present a multi-colored, polyphonic surf of sound and vision, set to the ritual nocturnal vibrations of its arsenal."" And yet, despite some occasionally worrying signs, Lazer Crystal successfully keep MCMLXXX from descending into academic navel-gazing. Though they are keen to keep the entities separate, two of three Lazer Crystal members are also part of weirdo collective Mahjongg. The connection is a useful starting point since Lazer Crystal employ many of the same elements-- skulking synths, skittering beats, and warped vocals-- to create uniquely disorienting music. But where Mahjongg's albums can feel organic, thanks to occasional dashes of afro pop and dance-punk, MCMLXXX floats in outer orbit, broadcasting a glimpse of a bizarre, imagined future in which a 1980s corporate training video soundtrack is as legitimate a musical influence as Neu! or Can. The approach sometimes leads them astray-- such as on the space oddity jazzercise workout ""Catch the Wave""-- but the wide net they cast can also pay off. Standout ""Love Rhombus"" nicely offsets its lethargic thump with a cavalcade of arcade game-like effects, while the acid-house meltdown of ""Bad Indian"" recalls some nightmarish road trip. For all its unusual, seemingly desultory instrumentation, at its core, MCMLXXX is a pop album. Though Lazer Crystal are more than willing to stick their necks out to see their vision through (see the sprawling nine-minute closer ""2029""), they rarely do so at the expense of structure. If MCMLXXX is less audacious than the band's mission statement would suggest, the ideas are more engaging and palatable. The album may fall short of its creators' lofty goals, but this is one failure that ought to be congratulated. It's a rare conceptual piece that's actively more enamored of the audience than itself.","Sharing two members with Mahjongg, this Chicago trio crafts a conceptual album that's actively more enamored of the audience than itself.

A Balloon Called Moaning,The Joy Formidable,by: Zach Kelly,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a962c0084474cd0c1016/1:1/w_160/a404cd94.jpg,2010-05-03 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14170-a-balloon-called-moaning/,Black Bell,"For the Joy Formidable, bigger most certainly is better. The London-by-way-of-Wales outfit makes music that feels bred for the arena, packing each driving track with huge washes of guitar and giant swarms of buzzing bass. This despite the fact that half the band's debut mini-LP, A Balloon Called Moaning, was recorded in a bedroom. If nothing else, the album is proof that you don't need a ton of production gloss to create a sound that's this anthemic and emotive. On almost every track here, you get that moment of boisterous clarity-- usually in the form of some skyward-shooting chorus-- that feels affirming and perfectly in-line with UK arena rock. But these fist-pumping jolts are mixed in with prickly goth textures and doses of melodic post-punk, which serve as a welcome contrast. And most of these big moments get over without the benefit of being outwardly catchy, which is both impressive and occasionally worrying. Opener ""The Greatest Light Is the Greatest Shade"" and stunning highlight ""The Last Drop"" are two exceptions, but elsewhere the band's emphasis is on making emotional contact rather than trying to wiggle a hook into your head. And it's all good, just as long as the band cranks it. Guitarist and lead vocalist Ritzy Bryan's sprightly voice soars when hoisted up by the rousing buzz of the band, even in instances when they seem like they should drown her out. Bryan's energy delicately enhances and ekes feeling out of draggier numbers, especially relatively to occasional vocal contributor and bassist Rhydian Dafydd. On material that offers more of an edge, like the harder-charging ""Whirring"", Bryan stands out as more than just a sing-along leader, injecting a little bit of snarl into the proceedings. A Balloon Called Moaning could actually stand for a bit more of that edge, and sometimes the material's boisterousness can seem a little hokey. But if enveloping and cleanly-stated material like ""The Last Drop"" or recent single ""Popinjay"" are any indication, there's real potential for the band's big songs to be as much about pop as they are about payoff.","Welsh band's mini-LP, out last year in the UK and now being issued in the States, demonstrates a flair for guitar anthems.

"The Fear Is Excruciating, But Therein Lies the Answer",Red Sparowes,by: David Raposa,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a985b1335d7bf16994e6/1:1/w_160/79ad2126.jpg,2010-05-03 06:00:02,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14197-the-fear-is-excruciating-but-therein-lies-the-answer/,Sargent House,"Since the last time Pitchfork reviewed one of their records, Red Sparowes have recorded an album with song titles inspired by China's Great Leap Forward and dedicated a live album to thieves who stole their instruments that read: ""May death come to you on swift wings, may your spoils turn into serpents and coil around your necks, may the rest of your days be stricken with unending sickness, may your children's bodies belong to the fire, may every last one of you anguish in eternal pain, crying aloud for mercy, while we turn our heads away with a smile and a deaf ear."" Suffice it to say that their pretensions aren't only musical-- and in this case, that's a good thing. It takes a certain conviction and character to make instrumental post-rock, and the group's got both with plenty to spare. However, considering they feature guys who've played with screamo progenitors Angel Hair, synthcore enthusiasts the VSS, and Isis, one would hope that Red Sparowes weren't so typically post-rocky. After all, at this point, eight-minute, loud/soft tunes that pay homage to the apocryphal grandeur of Mogwai and Godspeed You! Black Emperor need to be pretty special to make hearts swell. The Fear, unfortunately, falls short of that mark-- no amount of conviction can elevate these tracks above sounding like superb mimicry. If you hear one song from The Fear, you've heard them all-- a quiet, ominous opening gives way to a gradual build-up and, eventually, the bombastic climax. The album's opening track fittingly serves as a two-minute teaser of what the LP's lengthier tracks accomplish, as well as a example of what those tracks might have been better off avoiding. ""Truths Arise"" starts with a solitary guitar offering its lament one reverbed note at a time; but after the first minute, the group brings in the drums and the bass and the loudness to send off the song in an entirely unnecessary flourish of fanfare. It's a twist that listeners can see coming from miles away-- it pushes the same button that's always pushed in these situations. Without fail, The Fear rides that button down to a nub, going so far as to circle back on longer tracks to give the button another unnecessary push. There are some nice touches to be found here-- some tracks foreground what sounds like a little Allman-esque slide guitar, and the softer and slipperier sections of ""A Mutiny"" (aka the parts that don't sound like interstitial music from 28 Days Later) is refreshingly reminiscent of early Tortoise. These brief moments of clarity and contemplation, however, are capably subsumed by the group's unwavering need to kick out the jams, ""Like Herod"" style. They do well enough with those sections, but those fleeting moments on The Fear when Red Sparowes avoid that impulse makes those all-too-frequent moments of big-bang-boom all the more disappointing.","With conviction and character to spare, the post-rock band crafts another record of soft/loud dynamics.

Option Paralysis,The Dillinger Escape Plan,by: Jess Harvell,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a98413d197565213989f/1:1/w_160/dea27359.jpg,2010-05-03 06:00:01,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14201-option-paralysis/,Season of Mist,"Technical metal and hardcore scratch very different itches, despite sharing many of the same root-level obsessions (speed, aggression, you know the drill). One's fixated on a maniacal instrumental proficiency; the other strips rock down to a core of primitive blare. Dillinger Escape Plan's 1999 debut, Calculating Infinity, was a game-changing (and copycat-spawning) album because DEP excelled at both halves of the equation. Not the easiest thing to manage. DEP spun arrangements to shame metal's biggest control freaks, but executed them with a raw energy that suggested the whole thing might splutter into instrument-flinging chaos at any second. So it goes on the typically overwhelming (in many senses) Option Paralysis, but as with the band's previous two albums, the new one's not entirely successful. Unlike the frighteningly focused Infinity, DEP's 21st century records pull in too many stylistic directions, sometimes to the detriment of what the band does best. Infinity was unrepeatable. Radical lineup shifts-- and the restlessness common to genre-mixers-- meant a change in direction was inevitable. 2004's Miss Machine and 2007's Ire Works offered an ever-broadening sound that kinda-sorta skirted crossover-friendliness, a sometimes awkward mash of traditional, melodic rock and hideous shrieking and bashing. Option Paralysis continues in that vein for better or worse. When DEP stick to the sound they perfected on Infinity, they're the only mathcore band left standing that still matters, and there are plenty of blinding moments on Option Paralysis. For instance the way ""Good Neighbor"" shifts unexpectedly and almost imperceptibly mid-song, from jagged spasms of ultra-tricky death metal drumming to thundering, straight-ahead, old-school hardcore. You're left fumbling to figure out how the hell the band pulled it off and too jacked-up on adrenaline to really care. That's the draw of DEP at their best. They certainly provide enough brain-scrambling fodder for the count-the-time-changes crowd. In two and a half minutes, ""Endless Endings"" cuts from power metal histrionics to funk-metal groove to grindcore splatter with a fluidity that sounds like DEP's playing with samples rather than playing in real time. But sudden eruptions of emotive crooning feel out of place. The icky mix of cocktail piano and emo melodrama on ""Widower"" is a major offender. It's not just that the inevitable math-y freakout derails the song's sense of momentum. It's also that DEP's notion of what constitutes ""pop"" is so damn corny. Forget Faith No More, the most frequent point of comparison. Without Mike Patton's sense of the absurd to undercut the pomp, this shit sounds like Foreigner with an affinity for blast beats. DEP don't need to worry about ""softening up"" or (gack) ""selling out."" They need to worry about the fact that 3/4ths of Option Paralysis is astounding and 1/4th is plain cringeworthy. They might be better off sticking to the devil they know, rather than trying to become the first tech-math-metal-core-whatever band to land on Now That's What I Call Music.","Blending technical metal and hardcore, the ambitious DEP try to avoid being pulled in too many stylistic directions.

Forgiveness Rock Record,Broken Social Scene,by: Ryan Dombal,Features Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a989b1335d7bf16994eb/1:1/w_160/b88d13a4.jpg,2010-05-03 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14200-forgiveness-rock-record/,Arts & Crafts,"Forgiveness is not a sentiment often associated with rock music. Anger, despair, infatuation, sure. But forgiveness is more complicated, and tougher to fit into a four-minute song. Broken Social Scene know all about heartbreak-- they've spent most of the last decade crafting songs about it with almost unparalleled zeal. Their story is filled with scurrilous encounters, backstabbings, and break-ups on par with most 70s arena-rockers, and they've crashed and rebuilt so many times that it's nearly impossible to keep track of who was where at any given moment. But they've also used that flexibility to their advantage: Their epochal 2002 breakout You Forgot It In People was the joyous sound of friends banding together to boost each other up, while 2005's Broken Social Scene was the dizzying sound of friends fizzing out into solo endeavors and outside pursuits. Now they're back, and they're forgiving. Who, exactly? Each other, loves, bad decisions, humanity at large, worse decisions, the past, the future, culture, corporations, art, you, me, maybe even George W. Bush. (Well, maybe not him.) And while a 59-minute absolution session sounds excessive for even the most devout fans, Broken Social Scene aren't just throwing out hail marys here. Because forgiveness is hard, especially for a group this grand and this intertwined for this long. The album lets bygones go while acknowledging the pain and discipline involved, and does so while keeping with the band's indie-mixtape rep. There's a song that sounds like Pavement, one that sounds like the Sea and Cake (featuring Sea and Cake singer Sam Prekop), another like a Broadway adaptation of Children of Men, a weightless ballad that may double as an ode to masturbation, and a song that's basically five minutes of atmospheric pop perfection. Their ambition is intact. Forgiveness Rock Record's thematic bent is mature, and that sense of gravity is embedded into the music, too. Working with band hero, Tortoise/Sea and Cake drummer, and post-rock mastermind John McEntire for the first time, Broken Social Scene made sure to have their shit together. Considering the co-producer's experimental bona fides, it's surprising that this is the most song-based album the band has ever made-- every track but one contains vocals, and a couple seem to be filled with more words than the entirety of You Forgot It In People. Unlike their last album's sometimes indulgent cut-and-paste sonic collages, Forgiveness has distinct targets and leaves little room for wayward meanders. The band's newfound tightness results in a few of the most chart-friendly songs in BSS history, although as usual, each seems to come with a built-in caveat to prevent the potential of radio play: the sweat-soaked ""World Sick"", with its massive crescendos building to one visceral, heart-pounding release after another, is nearly seven minutes long with extended instrumental intros and outros. ""Texico Bitches"", despite its misleading breezy accompaniment, is an increasingly topical indictment of big oil that repeats the word ""bitches"" 12 times. And the vocals on the beautiful, synth-laden ""All to All"" are serviceably performed by relative newcomer Lisa Lobsinger, where Leslie Feist's stronger, more possessed delivery may have pushed it into another weight class entirely. (Feist does show up on Forgiveness, but only for background vocals.) As an alt-hippie with obsessions for Dinosaur Jr., Jeff Buckley, and Ennio Morricone, BSS main face Kevin Drew led the burgeoning band to somewhere completely fresh with You Forgot It In People, an album that read like a non-ironic, indie-rock Odelay for the early 2000s. For the most part, Drew and company are referencing the same beloved bands on Forgiveness, with one key addition: Broken Social Scene themselves. There are now marks that listeners expect them to hit, and they're nailed with focus and precision: the peppy, horn-laden track from Apostle of Hustle's Andrew Whiteman (""Art House Director""), the back-of-the-bus acoustic session (""Highway Slipper Jam""), the immense instrumental to end all immense instrumentals (""Meet Me in the Basement""). All of those tracks excellently fill their respective niches, but the fact that there are niches at all adds a bittersweet tinge to a band that once sounded like everything else and nothing else. Which leads us to the indiscretion summary ""Sentimental X's"". It checks off another BSS box-- the subtly devastating Emily Haines-sung heart-tugger. ""Off and on is what we want,"" sings Haines, narrating the band's gift-and-curse plight, ""A friend of a friend you used to call/ Or a friend of a friend you used/ You used to call."" Which is what Broken Social Scene is: a mess of friends using friends, loving friends, calling friends, wanting to call friends, and then not calling friends anymore. The connections are transitory but also indestructible.

Barefoot Wanderer,Jahcoozi,by: Joe Colly,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a97ab1335d7bf16994ce/1:1/w_160/d1769ba3.jpg,2010-04-30 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14189-barefoot-wanderer/,Bpitch Control,"One of the fun things about dance music in 2010 is that genre barriers seem increasingly obsolete-- the idea of limiting oneself to a particular style or country is almost laughable at this point. Jahcoozi, a collaboration between German producers Robot Koch and Oren Gerlitz and Sri Lankan vocalist Sasha Perera, take this global approach. In their tracks, dancehall riddims, glitch-hop, and experimental techno rub up against each other like long-lost pals. Jahcoozi's first two records, Pure Breed Mongrel and the awesomely titled Blitz 'n' Ass, took an aggressive line to the dancefloor. Rapid-fire beats and grime mixed with Perera's in-your-face political emceeing for a visceral, gritty sound. It was danceable, but ultimately disruptive music. But with Barefoot Wanderer, their first release for Berlin's BPitch Control, Jahcoozi appear a good deal more subdued with a style that leans heavily on dub-- both the classic Jamaican variety and its modern-day digital equivalent, dubstep. Mostly the shift works. There's a variety of song types and distinctive collaborators who bring tempo swings, but the prevailing mood is sort of a downtempo saunter, made even more spacious by Perera's milky vocals. (Massive Attack's Mezzanine is a good reference point in this sense.) Tracks like ""Barefoot Dub"" and ""Lost in the Bass"" set echo-chamber reverb alongside glitch-y techno, creating an interesting tension between traditional King Tubby-style dub and more progressive current electronic sounds. Most of these songs are good, but occasionally there's a dip in the dynamism of the production-- ""Zoom in Fantasize"" and ""Barricaded"" just sort of drift by without making much of an impact. Dub and techno are the album's core elements, but there are plenty of other styles stirred in. Some of Barefoot Wanderer's best material comes when the group invites guest vocalists to mix it up with Perera. On ""Powerdown Blackout"", she trades raps with Anti-Pop Consortium's M. Sayyid over a futuristic, Neptunes-ian hip-hop track. Kenyan dancehall toasters Ukoo Flani guest on ""Msoto Millions"", and percussionist and singer Guillermo E. Brown duets with Perera on the skittering ""Speckles Shine"". The album's much better off for these collaborations. Without them, it could get lost in its own fog and become just an interesting weed soundtrack, but instead they add more international intrigue to Jahcoozi's already inclusive formula.","Multi-cultral dance act makes its BPitch debut, constructing songs from dancehall riddims, glitch-hop, and experimental techno.

You Never Did Anything Wrong to Me,Team Ghost,by: Rebecca Raber,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a9769d034d5c69bf3c63/1:1/w_160/a03b3b68.jpg,2010-04-30 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14180-you-never-did-anything-wrong-to-me/,Sonic Cathedral,"Though Nicolas Fromageau would surely prefer that the debut EP by Team Ghost stand on its own merit, it's hard to talk about the project without mentioning M83. An original member of the latter alongside Anthony Gonzalez, Fromageau left M83 after the creation of what is arguably their best release, 2003's Dead Cities, Red Seas & Lost Ghosts. Not to diminish the charming, vibrant, John Hughes-inspired poignancy of Saturdays=Youth, but Gonzalez has taken M83 in a much brighter direction without his former partner, embracing pop buoyancy and accessible, sentimental melodies. It is, therefore, up to Fromageau (backed by multi-instrumentalist Christophe Guérin and producer/manager Jean-Philippe Talaga) to pick up the gothier, dream-pop mantle of his former project. You Never Did Anything Wrong to Me plays like a less volatile sequel to Dead Cities. All the things that make that album great are present here-- waves of synths, sunburst crescendos, harsh shoegaze drones, and tickly electronic effects-- but it also features a newfound emphasis on song structure and prominent rhythms that occasionally border on motorik. But the EP, despite its brief run-time, is ambitious in its scope, spanning the outer-reaches of Fromageau's wall-of-sound and making forays into everything from chilly synth-pop to bruised, echo-laden post-punk. Standout ""A Glorious Time"" crashes like a Ride track, but, despite its celebratory build and suffusion of fuzzy guitars, it is rooted in bittersweet nostalgia, as its yearning ""leave it all behind you"" refrain stresses. And ""Sur Nous Les Étincelles Du Soleil"" (translation: ""On Us, the Sparks of the Sun"") sustains a mood with its atmospheric girlish whispers delivered in French and washes of reverberating synths. The EP makes a strong argument for its form, offering seven essential songs (there are only six on the vinyl version) with no filler. In an iTunes era that has ushered in a renaissance for the singles format, You Never Did Anything Wrong to Me is an argument that sometimes a band should forsake the pressures of writing 10-plus great songs for a padded full-length debut and concentrate more on making a vital, necessary-sounding EP that best illustrates its capabilities. Which is exactly what Team Ghost have done here, marking a triumphant (yet wistfully subdued) return for its creator.","Former member of M83 picks up where the dark shoegaze of Dead Cities, Red Seas & Lost Ghosts left off.

A Mishmash of Changing Moods,Applescal,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a95a5e6ef959693213e0/1:1/w_160/2f3f3eb6.jpg,2010-04-30 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14163-a-mishmash-of-changing-moods/,Traum Schallplatten,"With his 2009 debut LP, A Slave's Commitment, 22-year-old Dutch producer Applescal announced himself as a formidable new talent. His sound was highly approachable; familiar yet fresh. His songs often recalled the sleek architecture of Boards of Canada and the slithering pulses of Four Tet, with a hint of the Traum label's distinctive sparkle. But at their best, they packed a sultry wallop that felt like an emerging voice of Applescal's own. Compared to the mean rhythmic slant and melodic punch of highlights like ""In the Mirror"", linear vamps like ""I Can't Stand"" felt indistinct. He sometimes got caught up in showing off what he could do, rather than what he could envision. But his vigor and ability made even the lesser tracks worthwhile. It looks like we have to keep waiting for Applescal to get past his impulsive streak. Little has changed on A Mishmash of Changing Moods, and why should it have? It's only been eight months. The album is more focused than its inauspicious title suggests, but as on Commitment, Applescal has produced about an EP's worth of dazzling material padded with the kind of competently stimulating tech fantasias you feel like he can crank out all day. His skill as a sonic architect is always at the forefront, and he's great at taking a handful of thematic elements and making them dance with graceful complexity. In the tension between nested rhythms and overarching melodies, beleaguered drum machines struggle to keep time before snapping back into place. Synths are filtered every which way. The sounds are so finely tailored you can feel the unique shape of each snare. But at his best, Applescal gets past minutiae and dreams up modular, interlocking universes of sound, with multiple motifs. Mishmash's first two tracks feel like warm-ups, though the ghostly vibes of the first make for a nice introduction. It really gets going with ""Dialeague"", his best and most unique work to date. The contrast between warm static and icy-clear melody is instantly immersive. It feels visionary and spacious. All of the bull's-eyes have something special that makes them stand out from the album proper: The curving, radiant spray of ""The Key of Genes""; the ominous bass flicker of ""MC Iron""; the thick, juicy groove of ""In Theory"". This high bar makes what would otherwise be totally solid spitting-drum and shrilling-synth workouts sound rote, a little pointless. Applescal seems limited only by a youthful urge to use everything, right now, as emphasized by the long, weird, unfinished-feeling closing track of Mishmash. Once he gets past it, look out.","Preternaturally gifted Dutch techno producer quickly follows his impressive debut with another decent LP that could have been a great EP.

Paul's Tomb: A Triumph,Frog Eyes,by: Rob Mitchum,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a96413d1975652139864/1:1/w_160/e31c54bf.jpg,2010-04-30 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14172-pauls-tomb-a-triumph/,Dead Oceans,"Indie rock can sometimes seem like a figure skating competition, where those who can't make their vocals the prettiest instead aim for the highest degree of difficulty. Certain artists-- the Dirty Projectors, Joanna Newsom-- stretch the limits of the seven-note scale, crafting melodies that take longer to resolve than sentences in a German philosophy text. Others go for extremity of tone: the glass-shattering falsetto of Passion Pit, or the chest-rumbling baritone of the National. Frog Eyes' Carey Mercer grafts a combination of these approaches into his own voice, a slippery beast that sounds like it gargles with wax in the morning. And while some bands might settle for those vocal contortions as their only exotic feature, Frog Eyes' arrangements are every bit as unpredictable as Mercer's catalog of shouts, groans, and other odd emphases. At full flight, the band's lengthy epics trace impossibly complex patterns that can be briefly stunning in the rare cases where they improbably collide. When we last heard from Frog Eyes-- before the weird-vocal derby really got fired up-- they left us with their best example of that spectacle: the serpentine, cathartic ""Bushels"". That song appears, at first, to have passed its baton to Paul's Tomb: A Triumph, which opens with the sprawling ""A Flower in a Glove"" and then winds its way through three more six-minute-plus journeys. But a disappointing pattern begins to take shape in each of these long chapters, as the band begins on a promising note during the first three minutes, but exhausts itself over the last nine. That lack of endurance doesn't hurt the shorter songs on Paul's Tomb, which are powered by a claustrophobic energy of guitar screech, stop/start rhythms, and Mercer's strange, over-enunciated vocabulary. ""Rebel Horns"" packs several minutes' worth of multi-stage composition into an economical four-minute package. The similarly brief ""Odetta's War"" and ""Lear's in Love"" (in which Mercer tries to set the world record for most syllables in the stock lyric ""I kissed a girl"") both possess the kind of compressed, ferocious intensity that so often becomes diluted during the noodly excursions of the lengthier tunes. All the same, it's clear that Frog Eyes like long songs. I like long songs, too. But the less focused, super-sized tracks on Paul's Tomb: A Triumph, especially compared to 2007's outstanding Tears of the Valedictorian, can't help but look like a hole shaped suspiciously like Wolf Parade/Sunset Rubdown's Spencer Krug, a former roommate and bandmate of Mercer's who doesn't appear here. Even in Krug's absence, cues could have been taken from him, or from Frog Eyes' other famous BFF, Destroyer's Dan Bejar, both of whom have recently charted long songs that stray far from their starting point, but nevertheless reach satisfying conclusions. As both of those artists understand well, even the flashiest skating requires a graceful finish.","Carey Mercer and co. follow 2007's triumphant Tears of the Valedictorian with another record of ambitious, high-wire indie rock.

Sun Bronzed Greek Gods EP,DoM ,by: Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a969b1335d7bf16994af/1:1/w_160/36ed066b.jpg,2010-04-30 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14176-sun-bronzed-greek-gods-ep/,Burning Mill,"With MySpace, Facebook, and Twitter having made musicians so accessible, artists and listeners now seem to be missing some of the distance that, not so long ago, created an air of mystique around our favorite bands. Acts like the Tough Alliance, Blank Dogs, and Burial have made being unknowable desirable in the Internet era. That there's so little information on Worcester, Mass. five-piece Dom may be partly due to the fact that they've only been a band for a few months, but then again, the group's endlessly quotable Rising interview with Pitchfork earlier this month had no shortage of willful obscurity: Lead singer Dom declined to share his last name, and blurred the line between fact and fiction so nonchalantly that it became hard to know if anything he said could be believed at all. Dom's incorrigible swagger carries over to their debut EP, Sun Bronzed Greek Gods, already sold out on cassette, and available on 10"" vinyl early next month. Their demo-level production, surf-rock licks, cavernous reverb, and ""psychedelic sampling elements""-- as the singer described it in a Craigslist ad recruiting band members last December-- might lead some people to align the group with chillwave. But their arena-size choruses, actual drummer, and overall don't-give-a-fuck spirit put Dom in a category of their own. In truth, the majority of their tracks are closer in tone to the female-fronted college-rock bands that hailed from their home state in the 90s, relying less on consumer synths than fuzzed-out guitars, revving bass, and lockstep drums. The phrase ""do it yourself"" gets thrown around a lot, but ""do your own thing"" is a better goal, and Dom both embody and challenge that ideal. They sing about ecstasy and basement parties, yet their mini-anthem ""Burn Bridges"" could cross over as easily as Passion Pit, a band who tried, to no avail, to sign Dom to their own Black Bell label earlier this year. The electro fuzz on ""Living in America"" comes straight from French house, but it's subverted by an intentionally vapid chorus (""It's so sexy/ To be living in America""), which Dom himself acknowledges as ""a 'YMCA'-type track that I would be best known for but forever hate myself for writing."" What else would you expect from a 22-year-old who dismisses the troubled upbringing of Girls frontman Christopher Owens as ""probably just his publicist's idea"" right after discussing his own childhood experiences in foster homes? Maybe Dom lie so they can get away with telling the truth. Their song ""Jesus"" is laced with drug references and movie-theater make-outs, but longs for the kind of substance that can't be abused: ""Gimme gimme/ Something to believe in."" That brand of subtle, detached malaise is present throughout the record, from the wistful noise-pop number ""Hunny"" to minor-key closer ""I Wonder"". But ultimately, what makes Sun Bronzed Greek Gods work is the band's innate understanding of the power of a killer hook, and their ability to turn them out effortlessly on each of the EP's seven tracks. Sincere, sharp, catchy, funny-- maybe these songs are all you need to know about Dom after all.","Dom have only been a band for a few months, but they already display an innate understanding of the power of killer hooks-- their debut EP is packed with them.

Inter Arbiter,Inlets,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a97dea9e61561daa5a42/1:1/w_160/a884f0cf.jpg,2010-04-29 06:00:04,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14191-inter-arbiter/,Twosyllable,"""Do it yourself if you want things done right,"" sings Sebastian Krueger on ""Canteen"" from Inter Arbiter, the debut LP from Inlets. That claim is a bit of a red herring: Though Krueger originally hails from Wisconsin and operates mostly solo out of his Brooklyn home, he's no lone wolf or Justin Vernon-style sob story. In recent years, Krueger's popped up on records by My Brightest Diamond and DM Stith; on Inter Arbiter he shares time with guests Zach Condon (Beirut) and Angel Deradoorian (Dirty Projectors). No surprise then that much of the Inlets record orbits around Brooklyn's baroque sounds. ""Canteen"", modeled like an Archer Prewitt cut-- crisp and close-miced, open-tuned guitars-- is somewhat of an outlier. For the most part, Krueger splits the difference between frilly instrumentation and an acoustic-led inner monologue. His compositions don't move forward so much as they revolve in place, each filigree of strings and vocal harmony rounded off in waltz time. And while acoustic instruments are prominent enough to suggest solo composition, there are, as a song title here slyly jokes, plenty of ""Bells and Whistles"" and decorative orchestration. Even when Inlets get relatively spare, such as on ""In Which I, Robert"", the song stlll boasts staccato piano thumbs and barbershop harmonies. But for all its external prettiness, Inter Arbiter too often honors its name by getting lost in itself. Though Krueger's poetic bent is admirable in a genre that can be too straightforward or impressionistic, Krueger's lyrics can get a little too ripe-- see lines like, ""I can smell your underbelly, softened and sweet/ And it gets me going like I've nothing to eat."" ""Bright Orange Air"", the keeper cut, demonstrates Inter Arbiter could've been a knockout with stricter boundaries. Boasting the record's most intriguing lyrics-- a bemused recollection of the strange beauty of metropolitan ambient light-- and a sturdy song structure that supports tart harmonies, it demonstrates that Krueger's adept at painting around the edges. Hopefully, next time around he'll become more comfortable aiming for bullseyes.","Up and coming baroque-pop singer/songwriter flashes plenty of promise on his debut LP.

Words Are Stupid,The Black Swans,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a96713d1975652139869/1:1/w_160/6049c99b.jpg,2010-04-29 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14174-words-are-stupid/,St. Ives,"When I say the Black Swans' new songs are ""haunted,"" I mean that as literally as the word can be interpreted. After the Columbus, Ohio, band finished recording its second album Change!, violinist Noel Sayre died suddenly in a swimming pool accident in July 2008. He left a laptop full of recordings-- some incidental music, some snippets of melody-- which singer-songwriter Jerry DeCicca incorporated into the Black Swans' follow-up, Words Are Stupid. That's Sayre setting the scene on opener ""Blurk"", adding dramatic eddies of violin to ""Open Sky"", and kazooing on ""Kazood"". He remains only a glimmer at the edges of the music-- present and pointedly not present-- but it's not the tragedy of his death that makes this strange, smart, soulful album resonate so darkly. His playing has always been crucial to the band's sound, adding a dusky ambience to DeCicca's world-weary croak and bluesy, brainy lyrics. Why wouldn't these found sounds do the same? Words Are Stupid has an unusual life of its own. The album was commissioned by St. Ives as a meditation on the fallibility and malleability of language. It will be released exclusively on vinyl and limited to only 200 copies, each with a slightly different photo on the cover. The Black Swans' undertake this assignment with the same mix of gusto and gravity they've applied to all their releases, generating a dark country backdrop for DeCicca's playful lyrics. It's an album with a thesis, but it never becomes weighted down with semantics. Ultimately, it argues that words are not stupid so much as tragically insufficient to express the enormity of even everyday emotions, much less overwhelming feelings of loss like the one this band has suffered. On this alternately humorous and heartbreaking album, the Black Swans realize that music can do what words cannot. With a blurt that sounds not unlike an Americanized Stuart Staples, DeCicca's lyrics tread a fine line between ridiculous and revelatory as he slips in and out of a variety of roles and guises. Despite doing everything from building a joke around a rooster's crow or singing about comic strips like ""Marmaduke"" or ""The Wizard of Id"", DeCicca makes his words mean a lot. His work as a producer-- for the Black Swans as well as for Moviola and Larry Jon Wilson-- gives him a nuanced grasp of mood and depth, sketching out intricate settings with only a few instruments and notes. The closely mic'ed guitar on ""Day at the Park of Roses"" swells with the intensity of Low and the purposefulness of Tindersticks, but the ebb and flow of that industrial buzz in the background lends the song a menace that belies the pleasantries implied by its title. ""Black Swans Tango"" is a mostly spoken-word account of going deaf in Buenos Aires and reading Borges, set to a rustic South American rhythm that's not quite a tango, but a memory of one. The tale culminates in one of the album's most thematically and emotionally satisfying moments, as DeCicca plays a solo on a comb and wax paper-- an improvised instrument intent on ""moving you without words.""","This extremely limited vinyl-only release is also the first since the sudden death of Black Swans member Noel Sayre.

Écailles de Lune,Alcest,by: Grayson Currin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a95bb1335d7bf1699495/1:1/w_160/f923730a.jpg,2010-04-29 06:00:02,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14164-ecailles-de-lune/,Prophecy,"Écailles de Lune, the second LP from romantic black metallurgists Alcest, is the most fully realized effort to date from its frontman and lone constant Neige. The spindly Frenchman has been a member of a half-dozen bands, from the brittle Peste Noire to the wildly and willfully diverse coed quartet Amesoeurs. Since 2005, Neige has been releasing music as Alcest that ranges from the black metal of 2005 EP Le Secret to the Red House Painters-via-Justin Broadrick 2007 LP, Souvenirs d'un Autre Monde. Now, he's finally fit all of his component parts-- arching atmospherics, celestial melodies, suffocating roars-- into one record. At last, Neige has made an album that plays like one. At a time when both legitimately heavy bands like Wolves in the Throne Room and Liturgy and electronic acts like Ben Frost and Fuck Buttons are using black metal ideas to build something bigger, Neige lands one of the most cohesive, well-considered experiments yet. He peels apart the layers of black metal-- lacerated vocals, relentless rhythms, overtone-rich guitars-- and applies them to disparate structures and sounds. On ""Percées de Lumière"", the rhythm supplies a pace that's nearly krautrock, while the guitars revolve around a minor riff that suggests Slint. So, of course, the metal shifts to the vocals. Neige generally sings gracefully and carefully, but here he screams in black-metal horror. ""Écailles de Lune [Part I]"", on the other hand, even sounds like a toughened mix of M83 and Sigur Rós, with guitars saturating every space and Neige's voice floating like Jónsi Birgisson's once did. Beneath the surface, however, the militant pacing of drummer Winterhalter and the increasingly sinister note selections of Neige presage something heavier. For the final two minutes, they rage like Scandinavian lords in a high-dollar studio. Thanks to the methodical if subtle way that song develops, moving from staggering rock to twinkling atmospherics to something altogether more intense, it doesn't seem out of place. The same holds for ""Part II"", which erupts quickly into a brutal rush only to burn itself out, dissolving into a ghastly drone that builds and collapses twice more. The line between the tormented and the gorgeous blurs into an imagined boundary-- tedious to find, delightful to miss. Several reviews of Écailles de Lune have criticized the album's brevity, noting that, though its six tracks clock in just shy of 42 minutes, ""Percées de Lumière"" appeared on a limited-edition split last year, while the 108-second instrumental, ""Abysses"", doesn't warrant mention as a ""song."" That's an unfortunate dismissal, especially because ""Abysses"" is as vital as anything else here. Like the best of Alcest's output, it's a ghastly but beautiful hum. Neither an admonition nor an invitation, neither noise nor new age, it confirms the newfound patience and purpose of Neige, who's made an album that's more enchanting than even these last few years of promise have suggested.","French artist Neige finally fits all his component parts-- arching atmospherics, celestial melodies, suffocating roars-- into one dynamic metal record.

That was Kate Nash at a gig in England last month, rejecting requests to play her biggest hit, ""Foundations"". Following in the virtual footsteps of similarly saucy Londoner Lily Allen, Nash first gained fans via another Web 2.0 site-- MySpace-- then graduated to the high-pressure world of UK #1 albums (2007 debut Made of Bricks), Brit awards (Best Female Artist 2008), and tabloid bullshit. Oh yeah, and she's only 22. Nash hasn't cracked up yet, but her sophomore album is thrillingly schizophrenic. There's the brash riot grrrl who shrieks expletive-strewn girl-power polemic-- clearly, a new addition. But there's also the warts'n'all diarist whose keenly observed romantic vignettes made Nash an Internet sensation in the first place. And, of course, there's still plenty of piano-pop approachability to reassure the 600,000 fans who bought that glossily uneven first album; Bernard Butler's occasional touches of 1960s girl-group production nicely serve Nash's bursting mini-narratives about insecurities, sexual politics, and-- what else?-- L-U-V. No one is going to mistake Nash for Karen O, let alone Ari Up. That's part of her appeal. Whether she's squawking on ""I Just Love You More"", hypnotically repeating a coming-out dilemma on ""I've Got a Secret"", or veering off into a foul-mouthed critique of groupie culture on ""Mansion Song"", Nash's leftfield moves resonate all the more here because she resembles someone you might actually know, a person with flaws-- not some impossibly cool rock goddess. On ""Do You Want to Share the Guilt?"", she declares, ""Not being able to articulate what I want to say drives me crazy."" This pivotal track's plainspoken anxiety, mallet percussion, and breathless coda are happily reminiscent of another wordy UK outfit recently undergoing a transition from politely employable to barely housebroken: Los Campesinos!. It's you, it's me, and we're emoting. A couple of shows after Nash's defiant YouTube endorsement, ""Foundations"" started cropping up on setlists again. Sure enough, My Best Friend Is You hedges its edginess, too; first single ""Do-Wah-Doo"" cushions Nash's blunt charm with billowy arrangements. Only now, Nash is no longer struggling to establish romance-- she's deep in it. From breezily pessimistic opener ""Paris"" to sublimely mundane finale ""I Hate Seagulls"" (and on through a hidden title track), the album moves from infatuation and jealousy to lust and betrayal to real, young love. And it does so with not just the best of intentions-- feminism, anti-homophobia, artistic experimentation-- but also, in the storytelling style of the Streets or Sweden's Hello Saferide, a set of distinctive, well-crafted songs that should strike a chord with self-deprecating teens and twentysomethings. Anyone can add a friend these days. Finding-- and keeping-- a best friend remains as awkward, embarrassing, and exquisite as ever.","Following her Brit award-lauded UK #1 debut, the young singer-songwriter hasn't cracked up yet, but her sophomore album is thrillingly schizophrenic.

Sorry, haters: 2010's Crystal Castles improves on their (also self-titled) debut in nearly every way. The latest from the Toronto-based electro duo is reminiscent of the jump forward taken by Deerhunter between Cryptograms and Microcastle, or Fuck Buttons from Street Horrrsing to Tarot Sport. Like those acts, Crystal Castles have reconciled with their detractors instead of running from them. By staying true to themselves, they've created a more focused, propulsive, and satisfying follow-up. Some listeners might miss the sonic shock that came from hearing the sub-zero Italo chill of ""Magic Spells"" sequenced next to the 8-bit electrocution of ""Xxzxcuzx Me"", but clashes like those wore out their welcome over the span of 16 tracks. Here, Crystal Castles embrace continuity and broaden their dynamic range beyond the primitive loops that once constituted the foundations of their songs. The core elements of first single ""Celestica"", for example, are pure shoegaze, but the waves of distortion that scrape across its chorus squash any concerns that the duo has gone soft. For a band known for its harsh midrange, this record reveals a surprising amount of depth in headphones. Crystal Castles are far more pop than before, too, which was probably an inevitable move, but hardly a bad one. Like ""Celestica"", ""Suffocation"" and ""Empathy"" mix fanged distortion and sparkly synths, while tracks like ""Vietnam"", ""Not in Love"", ""Intimate"", and the rave-tinged ""Baptism"" arm the record with loads of could-be singles. But despite this shift toward beauty and clarity, Crystal Castles still rip into some punishing, epileptic moments, like the distorted bass riff on ""Birds"" and the shredded brutality of ""Doe Deer"". The fluidity of the music is matched by Alice Glass' frequently manipulated vocals, a showcase for someone too often pigeonholed as a bratty screamer. She sounds at times like everything from a Leslie guitar (""Empathy"") to a *Cloverfield-*style monster (""I Am Made of Chalk""). The obvious comparison is the Knife's Silent Shout, but where Karin Dreijer-Andersson often manipulates her voice to play characters, Glass is just as disturbing for her dehumanization. As rewarding as this new album is, it's even more impressive when you consider its context: Crystal Castles may have come on at the tail-end of the blog-house/nu-rave/French-touch mini-rage, but they've now transcended it, moving from scene linchpin to indie stars. The reason is simple: Crystal Castles are a singular act who rarely sound like anyone other than themselves.

Little More Lived In,Snowglobe,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a9729d034d5c69bf3c5d/1:1/w_160/344c81f1.jpg,2010-04-28 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14184-little-more-lived-in/,Makeshift Music,"Snowglobe formed in 1999 in Athens, Georgia, but relocated to Memphis early on, where the members have mostly remained since. To listen to the band's records, though, they may as well have never moved. You can still hear Athens in their stuffed, Technicolor indie rock, and their time spent around members of the old Elephant 6 collective is the primary shaper of their sound even today. It's an interesting exercise to go through their five albums in order, ending with this one, and consider where the indie rock mainstream was in relation to this band for each of them. When they were first starting out, they were on the fringe, but their style of emotionally straightforward, heavily arranged music has become one of the defining sounds of indie rock. And oddly, as things have shifted further their way, they've started to take their sound in a less ornate direction. Little More Lived In has songs as elaborate as any on the band's past albums, but it also brings in more overt classic rock and country influences. In one sense it's the band's most Southern album, with its copious use of banjo, splashes of harmonica, and occasionally twangy vocals. The unfortunate thing about this shift is that the band winds up with a record that's half modern psych, half classic rock-inflected indie, and the disconnect is pretty audible. The contrast is especially sharp on the transition from ""Dad"" to ""Tim's Piano"", where the band ends one of the most humble, unpretentious songs I've heard all year-- a dryly recorded acoustic guitar-and-harmonica tribute to a father that ends with the line ""I love you, Dad""-- and proceeds immediately to an instrumental soaked in reverb and choral backing vocals. Both are decent pieces of music, but they sound worlds apart. The band bridges its opposing impulses in places-- the psychedelic backing vocals that balance the buzzing guitar solo and bouncing banjo of ""Teenage Queen"", for instance-- but the one place where they attempt an outright merger, on closer ""Land Brains"", is a bit messy, roughing up a long build with a sudden outburst of hoedown banjo and steel guitar that feels forced. Snowglobe seem to be a band in transition on Little More Lived In, trying to find a way to grow beyond the orch-pop niche they've occupied for so long. They're mostly successful in the endeavor here, but it might take one more record to get the balance of elements exactly right.","Memphis-by-way-of-Athens band drifts away from orchestral pop and incorporates more rootsy Southern flourishes.

Trans-Continental Hustle,Gogol Bordello,by: Joshua Love,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a971b1335d7bf16994bd/1:1/w_160/6be5d419.jpg,2010-04-28 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14185-trans-continental-hustle/,American,"Eugene Hutz, tireless rabble-rousing frontman for gypsy-punk iconoclasts Gogol Bordello, has traveled great literal and spiritual distances to be where he is today. A teenage Hutz immigrated to the United States as a political refugee in the early 1990s at the conclusion of an arduous journey begun in his native Ukraine. Assembling his band in New York City in 1999, he's spent over two decades pouring passion and sweat into establishing Gogol Bordello as one of America's most chaotically enthralling live acts and relentlessly ebullient recording artists. Hutz's odyssey has been so dogged and so deeply felt that it has become the great subject of his art itself. Much like its predecessors, Gogol Bordello's fifth studio album, the aptly titled Trans-Continental Hustle, is largely about the experience of being Gogol Bordello, about overcoming stigmas against immigrants and America's tacit favoring of bland one-world homogenization in order to carve out a vibrant, warts-and-all space where life can be celebrated and differences cherished. In songs like ""Break the Spell"", ""Raise the Knowledge"", and ""Rebellious Love"" Hutz seems more polemical street philosopher and positivist guru (no wonder Madonna's a fan) than conventional rock frontman, refusing to put any distance or irony between himself and his artistic creations. In the past, Hutz has rarely allowed songcraft to get in the way of his manic exultations of joy and frenzied bouts of soul-searching. That changes somewhat with Trans-Continental Hustle, as Gogol Bordello work with famed producer Rick Rubin, who ostensibly is largely responsible for a newfound emphasis on nuance and dynamics, in contrast to the always-in-fifth-gear MO that has defined the band. Results are mixed-- ""Sun Is on My Side"" offers lovely accordion and a weary, haunting refrain, but the midtempo ""Uma Menina Uma Cigana"" feels flat and perfunctory, while the lugubriousness of ""When Universes Collide"" actually undermines Hutz's harrowing, poverty-tinged lyrics. Hutz's emboldening exhortations and the band's sweatily democratic live show make it clear that Gogol Bordello wish to foster a massive brotherhood of open-hearted partiers. Such non-stop full-throttling might work for punk-rock true believers, but the band's inviting uniqueness ensures that its admirers will be more far-flung than that, and most of us don't want to spend our entire lives in the red. In that context it makes sense for Hutz and the group to try taking a more multifarious approach, but honestly it just doesn't play to their strengths. I may only want to join his raucous shindig every now and again, but its nice knowing he's always somewhere tearing the roof off.","Gogol Bordello again tackle overcoming stigmas against immigrants and America's favoring of bland homogenization.

What We Lose in the Fire We Gain in the Flood,The Mynabirds,by: Matthew Perpetua,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a96c13d1975652139873/1:1/w_160/1c662432.jpg,2010-04-28 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14179-what-we-lose-in-the-fire-we-gain-in-the-flood/,Saddle Creek,"Laura Burhenn, the singer and songwriter of the Mynabirds, was previously one half of the Washington, D.C. indie duo Georgie James. That's not terribly indicative of what her new band sounds like, however. Georgie James' polite, unmemorable brand of aughts-era indie pop has very little to do with the full-blown country and soul style of the Mynabirds' debut. Nevertheless, that bit of context highlights a major creative leap for Burhenn. After hearing What We Lose in the Fire We Gain in the Flood, it's difficult to revisit her previous material-- including solo work released prior to Georgie James-- without sensing that she had not yet found her voice. Here, she emerges fully formed with a set of bold, assured songs so elegantly composed that many could pass for old standards. For many musicians, working within a vintage aesthetic would lapse into pastiche, but Burhenn's blue-eyed soul sounds entirely natural and well-suited to her gifts. The songs stay within the bounds of tradition but give her voice room to establish a nuanced character and presence, where she was once hemmed in by bland tunes and airless production. Since she is hardly alone in going for this sort of sound, her success is largely a matter of achieving the right balances. Burhenn sings with soul and conviction, but also taste and restraint, which keep her from sounding too much like a contestant on ""American Idol"" or an over-sweetened throwback like Duffy. The production, by Richard Swift along with Burhenn, aims for a timeless sound, but allows for just enough modern touches to keep the album from coming across as overly retro. The material recalls artists such as Dusty Springfield, Laura Nyro, and Linda Rondstadt, but the sound and style come closer to more recent touchstones-- Jenny Lewis' best moments on her own and with Rilo Kiley; Cat Power circa The Greatest and Jukebox; Fiona Apple's collaborations with Jon Brion. At her best, as on the churchy climax of ""What We Gained in the Fire"" and the showstopping ""We Made a Mountain"", Burhenn is as heartbreaking and tuneful as her finest inspirations while investing her songs with a calm fatalism that sets her apart. Although assertive, up-tempo cuts such as the single ""Numbers Don't Lie"" and the stomping ""Let the Record Go"" command the most immediate attention, her pretty yet weary voice is most impressive on slow-burning mid-tempo tracks like ""LA Rain"" and the languid, Velvet Underground-ish ""Ways of Looking"". What We Lose in the Fire is over and out in just over a half hour, which is about the right length of time for this type of album. The songs are tight and consistent; the mood is evocative but doesn't outlast its welcome before completing the emotional arc of the sequencing. The charm of the record isn't a matter of reinventing familiar sounds so much as working within them with comfort and grace. Nothing sounds overworked. If anything, Burhenn and Swift present the songs in an understated manner, confident in the quality of the material and the strength of her voice. They weren't wrong to make that call.","Former Georgie James member takes a creative leap forward, trading polite, unmemorable indie pop for full-blown country and soul.

Voluspa,The Golden Filter,by: Zach Kelly,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a942b1335d7bf1699465/1:1/w_160/895ab178.jpg,2010-04-28 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14143-voluspa/,Brille,"At a time when soft-pulsing nu-disco can always find a home somewhere in cyberspace, it's fairly easy to see why an outfit like the Golden Filter have been met with such fondness. After making a serious blog dent over the past year with a few well-regarded singles and remixes for Cut Copy and Peter Bjorn and John, the duo finally make the leap from web to wax with their debut full-length, Voluspa. While the singles make an impact (borderline bangers ""Solid Gold"" and ""Thunderbird"" both appear here), much of Voluspa indicates the Golden Filter sound best in smaller doses. Clearly most interested in establishing atmosphere, most of the material here is moody and fragile, a bit restrained for the dancefloor and a little too flat and repetitive to be taken anywhere else. When Voluspa works, it is at best pleasant listening: Stephen Hindman's squelched-out synths and string injections are often both fitting and appealing, and his blasts of big tribal drums and the occasional bass hook help flesh it out. Australian vocalist Penelope Trappes' lithe, comely vocals suggest that no matter how uninformed, you too can become the Dancing Queen with a little luck. But over the span of an hour with this little variation, most of these details begin to feel like stuffing. Wary to appear bold, the Golden Filter obviously feel most comfortable using understatement, and that's perfectly fine. But when coming off the high of something like ""Solid Gold"", it's hard to get into (or even sit through) the slight, underheated-M83 vibe of something like ""The Underdogs"". It leads you to believe that maybe their early remixes were so warmly received because the band actually had a template to work with. When left to their own devices, they have difficulty providing their songs with an actual structure, and the details lose their punch when echoed on nearly every song. Soon Trappes' vocals begin to sound snoozier, and the most appealing (or at least the most inventive) pieces of Hindman's constructions seem loosely tethered together, leaving little to sink your teeth into.","After a string of promising singles, and even better remixes, the blissed-out electro-pop group make their full-length debut.

DJ-Kicks,The Juan MacLean,by: Nate Patrin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a95cea9e61561daa5a0e/1:1/w_160/6c1b6a94.jpg,2010-04-28 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14165-dj-kicks/,!K7,"John MacLean likes to get confrontational about dance music. Which is understandable: He's a straight dude who came to house via indie and noise and he seems bugged out that others are doing the same. So he tells interviewers about how hipster kids dance wrong out of discomfort, how the heavy electro/Ed Banger side of house is just a way of maintaining segregated sexuality on the dancefloor, how journalists only pretend to like certain token artists so they can hide their intrinsic homophobia. It's strident stuff, borne out of years of discovery and elation and frustration, and whether or not any of it goes deeper than setting up and assaulting strawmen, it at least comes across as the worldview of a man who still feels compelled to defend his own house music cred. But none of those statements speak as loudly as his actual mixing does. MacLean's installation into the long-running DJ-Kicks series is all the proof you really need of his breadth of knowledge and ability to craft a good set-- all-vinyl, one take, no computers. Condensing 18 tracks (including a couple of well-timed reprises and callbacks) into a 72-minute stream of constantly shifting grooves without losing the fundamental euphoria of the original tracks' momentum isn't something that comes easy to bandwagoneers. And MacLean goes past tastemaker collection-flaunting into something deeper, a mix that sounds like its heart's been beating for 20 years. That's no small feat considering how many of the tracks here are less than five years old. There's always been a pocket of house that skews classicist-- MacLean and some of his fellow DFA pals amongst them. And it says something about the grip that label holds on the imaginations of the indie-dance set that the mix opens with the Ian Breno dub of ""Happy House"" (retitled ""Feliz Casa"" here), then segues into Still Going's bass-reverb monster ""Spaghetti Circus"" and makes both tracks sound like they've been a part of the house continuum for a few decades rather than a few years. Even across regions and scenes-- Giom's deep house cut ""I Know You Were Right"", the Paradise Garage-evoking ""Planets (The Revenge Lost Groove)"" from 6th Borough Project, the progressive house bliss of Danny Howells' ""Laid Out (Fully Horizontal Mix)""-- there's a vintage commonality. And when a ringer like Theo Parrish's dub of Rick Wilhite's 96 anthem ""Get on Up!!"" actually does show up, it fits perfectly. Sweetening the deal is the amount of unreleased material in the mix, much of it contributed by friends and like-minded artists. ""Take Me"" by Australian DJ A+O, re-molds the rubbery pulse and elastic bassline that Detroit techno classic ""Nude Photo"" popularized, yet it transcends superficial nostalgia with a stunning vocal hook. At the other end of the spectrum is ""Like a Child"", recorded by Juan MacLean keyboard player Dennis McNany under the assumed name ""Jee Day"", which layers shimmering, reverbed vocals onto a pseudo-acid bassline to immense effect. And then there's the final peak, ""Feel So Good"", a new Juan MacLean track that builds off a supple drum loop from the late Jerry Fuchs and a coolly detached vocal from LCD Soundsystem's Nancy Whang. All this is the kind of stuff indie-dance fans have good reason to go crazy over, and no cultural anxiety should keep them away from it. A truncated, looped refrain from Florian Meindl's ""Here Today Gone Tomorrow"" comes at an early peak in the mix-- ""house sees no race, creed or--""... fill in the blank with whatever you want after that, because MacLean's set sounds truly universal.","DFA mainstay builds off the massive success of his 2008 single ""Happy House"" by crafting the latest entry in the venerable DJ-Kicks mix series.

Thistled Spring,Horse Feathers,by: Larry Fitzmaurice,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a96d13d1975652139875/1:1/w_160/1ac47cd4.jpg,2010-04-27 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14181-thistled-spring/,Kill Rock Stars,"No one can accuse Justin Ringle of being an optimist. As the leader of Portland, Ore., folk outfit Horse Feathers, he's trawled in dark subject matter that recalls Southern gothic authors William Faulkner and Flannery O'Connor. Words like ""regret"" and ""shame"" make regular appearances in his lyrics-- alongside references to hard church pews, blood-stained snow, and sinners who take human and animal forms. All this misery may come across as disingenuous considering the band's PacNW roots, but somehow Horse Feathers have managed to rise above being consigned as cultural backseat drivers, weaving hushed, ornate arrangements that ably serve Ringle's uneasy imagery. 2008's House With No Name was slightly more sprightly than Horse Feathers' 2006 debut, the dourly titled Words Are Dead, but there was still an undercurrent of depression, owed both to the droning hum provided by cellist/vocalist Catherine Odell and Ringle's voice. However, on their third effort, Thistled Spring, there's a definite change of sonic mood. On previous albums, melodies remained unshaped beyond anything but their own emotional cores, but there's real movement here, as the many parts that make up the arrangements push and pull with one another instead of simply congealing. Album standout ""Belly of June"" swoops and dives in a major key, while the thrushing yawns of ""The Drought"" and the urgency of ""Veronia Blues"" render a drummer's presence (something Horse Feathers don't have) irrelevant. Clearly, the band has found a new level of confidence. Ringle, in particular, sounds more full-throated, exuding a physicality on ""As a Ghost"" and ""Belly of June"" that adds color to his still-bleak subject matter. Speaking of, there's plenty of talk about ill-fitting nooses, abusive frost, disastrous floods, and whatnot-- but it's Ringle's descriptions of nature's temperate splendor that stick with you this time around, as he muses on lark's looks or faith-stealing heat with equal passion as he does on the futility of living. So ignore the melodrama and enjoy the littler pleasures that are provided on Thistled Spring-- and there are quite a few. You can hear them in the space between Ringle's voice and the band's interplay, the zithering strings in ""Starving Robins"", the build and burst midway through ""Belly of June"". Complex, yes, but complexity that's expressed in a rather straightforward manner, while embracing a newfound sense of bright coherence. Spring's finally arrived, and hopefully for Horse Feathers, it'll stick around.","The PacNW band continues to trade in Southern gothic images and themes, adding more complexity and confidence to their sound.

In a February 2010 interview with Noisecreep.com, Marshall all but says so while discussing the new album: ""[Former guitarist] Nick [Sadler] wrote a lot of the stuff on there, and he was really looking to make it accessible, and see how it fared... There are definitely parts of the record that were written to see how people will respond, which is kind of disappointing."" If Sadler's name sounds familiar, it's probably from the decidedly non-Daughters-like charms of his other group, Fang Island. While he's not officially credited as a songwriter-- the songs on Daughters are attributed to the entire group-- Sadler is listed as a co-producer, which might explain the album's relatively less abrasive sound. Relative to other Daughters records, at least: Those hoping for the abrupt spasms from the group's 11-minute debut, or the slightly less abstract math essayed on Hell Songs, are going to be sorely disappointed when they drop the needle on ""The Virgin"". Most of the song's elements-- the frantic double-timed drumming, the insect-like chatter of the guitars-- are familiar from older Daughters' tracks. Its verse-chorus structure, on the other hand, isn't. And neither is Marshall's vocal transformation into a smooth and confident David Yow impersonator. Even the song titles are streamlined. While these moves might seem like capitulations of some sort, the band doesn't pull any punches because of them. In fact, this refinement actually serves to focus Daughters' energies. There's still room for flashes of the manic fretwork and double-bass drum damage of old in tracks like the thick and brutal ""The Dead Singer"", or ""Our Queens"", a song that's equal parts fractured mathcore and fist-pumping punk anthem. That said, pummeling hook-filled songs like the ""The Hit"" or ""Sweet Georgia Brown"" are the new norm. The moves made here are no different than the recent ""pop"" moves made by equally uncompromising bands like the Dillinger Escape Plan, Converge, and Torche-- each of those bands still sound like themselves, but they're also open to change and wholly willing to evolve into something else, fan backlash be damned. It's just a shame Daughters couldn't survive this transformation. As I said earlier, hardcore Daughters lovers will probably have plenty of bones to pick with this album. For everyone else, Daughters is a feast to be savored.","The final Daughters record finds the part of the group that went on to form Fang Island taking the lead, resulting in a more accessible version of the band.

As his band saunters around him, frontlad Avigdor Zahner-Isenberg finds himself ""lost in your summer cum"" and puzzles over mortality: ""Too much time to die,"" he and bandmate Rebecca Coleman sing in unison, ""and I don't wanna die."" His voice, never too far from a crack, lends that riff on impermanence the same weight as his takes on young lust. For all their age-appropriate fumbling, Avi Buffalo seem graceful beyond their years as songwriters. As many starkly intimate moments as they muster, a few of their tunes unfurl into near-epic lengths, gallantly breezing through moods and motifs. Snatches of Wilco's easy early-2000s amble, Built to Spill's curly fretwork, and Shins-y shuffle turn up everywhere here, occasionally all at once. The sound is tangled-- they take the scenic route to their best ideas-- but each move feels carefully considered. Spend enough time unspooling the tunes, and little pockets in these compositions start to open up, revealing an uncommon regard for detail and-- in the case of Zahner-Isenberg's guitar flittering-- a rather deft musicianship. All that helps pass off their sweet, redolent, and pretty damn twee lyrical outlook; ""I've never written a love song,"" Zahner-Isenberg sings several love songs deep into the album, later noting, ""but I will for you,"" and that-- plus a good bit of dirty talk, literal and otherwise-- constitutes their worldview at the moment. But what might come across as merely cutesy from another writer feels deeply felt and finely tuned here; lots of lovesick teenager wannabes dumb it down, but he smarts it up, throwing lots of rich images and headstrong proclamations into his not-always-sweet nothings. It's not so much diaristic as it is the kind of too-forward-in-hindsight shit you say to someone you're trying to get with at that age; it can be awkward, but it's an awkwardness he seems oddly comfortable with. And Avi Buffalo have every reason to be sure of themselves; this sneakily complex, unsappily sentimental, thoughtfully naïve debut is a very early success. There might be some moments that wander a bit off course, a few solos that could've wound down a minute early, or a couple of lyrics a tad too ribald for their starlit surroundings. But to be young is to be a bit clumsy sometimes, after all. And Avi Buffalo are, as they'll remind you, young yet.","Like the xx raised on a diet of Built to Spill and the Shins, Avi Buffalo are confident, deft, and lust-obsessed teens making music beyond their years.

Nobody's Daughter,Hole,by: Amanda Petrusich,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a96bc0084474cd0c1025/1:1/w_160/ebf5f6d8.jpg,2010-04-27 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14178-nobodys-daughter/,MercuryIsland Def JamCherryForever,"For girls who came of age in the mid-1990s, streaked their hair with Manic Panic, accessorized baby-doll dresses with combat boots and thrift-store cardigans, and crammed dog-eared copies of Sassy into each others' lockers, Courtney Love can feel like something of a pet cause. In 1994, Live Through This, Hole's second LP-- released, famously, in the wake of Kurt Cobain's suicide, after Love spent the weekend tottering through a vigil in a Seattle Center park-- was transformative, instructive, and beloved. That harsh, throaty gasp at the end of ""Violet"" was so authentically exhausted it felt like a promise: I'm giving you all I've got. We took it. In the years since, Love has become less a savior than a punchline, an egomaniacal eccentric who seems to invite tabloid bullshit: the incoherent twittering, the inexplicable brawls (squabbling with Lily Allen about who gets to wear a dress?), the bizarre Facebook apology to Billy Corgan. Sadly, Love's public persona has colored her music for just about everyone-- especially since her celebrity has been so pivotal (and purposeful) in the promotion of her work. Part of Love's appeal is her bravado, and she does her savvy best to substantiate it for us. That she fails, that we cringe, or that any of us still care are all valid lenses; they were provided by Love herself. The turmoil of the past few years gave fans a reason to hope that Nobody's Daughter might match the vulnerability of Live Through This, reviving the inside-out mania that energized Love's best tracks. What we've gotten instead is a forgettable collection of fairly generic, overproduced rock songs that feel, oddly, like a put-on-- despite her public meltdowns, Love remains preoccupied with posture and pose. She's buried, hiding behind a deliberate holler and dopey choruses, compulsively over-singing without ever saying much. Is it greedy to want Love's wildness-- all that vanity and fury and humor and trauma-- to animate her music? What are we allowed to demand from Courtney Love? More than this. Nobody's Daughter is heartbreakingly banal. This is Hole's fourth record, but that designation feels like a technicality-- there's not much to distinguish it from Love's solo work. Of course, Hole has always been something of a rotating ensemble, but it was anchored by a partnership between Love and guitarist Eric Erlandson, who is notably absent. There are a few oddball credits (Martha Wainwright, pianist Thomas Bartlett aka Doveman, and John Zorn-collaborating cellist Erik Friedlander all appear), and an employed cabal of co-writers, including Linda Perry, guitarist Pete Thorn, and Corgan. Some tracks, like the Hole/Corgan/Perry collaboration ""Pacific Coast Highway"" (which nods to Celebrity Skin's ""Malibu"", in both content and style), show hints of earnestness: ""I'm overwrought and so disgraced/ I'm too ashamed to show my face,"" Love sings, her voice cracking over pristine guitar. Later, things get mucked up by an unnecessary solo (by Hole's new lead guitarist, 24-year old Micko Larkin), but it's enough of a window to make listeners question what these songs might have done had they not been filtered through years of overwrites and third-party input. Same goes for ""Letter to God"", which suffers from a silly conceit, but offers moments of genuine humility (""I never wanted to be/ Some kind of comic relief/ Please show me who I am."") Love's voice is garbled and withering, and there are times, as on ""Someone Else's Bed"", where her voice sounds uncomfortably like Bob Dylan's. But the guitars are so dated, raunchy, and overstated that every track starts to feel like cartoon-rock-- more a Sunset Strip-rehash than grunge nostalgia, even-- and Love's lyrics (""I'm a lost soooooul!"") are plastic and artless. Despite its few fleeting moments of honesty, Nobody's Daughter ultimately feels like a badly missed opportunity.","More than a decade after its last album, Courtney Love's band returns, and its leader attempts to prove she's more than a punchline.

Smith. He's played such a variety of styles-- woodsy atmospheres with Thuja, psych-rock with Mirza, folk experiments as Hala Strana-- that his consistency seems unfair. He's the kind of guy who might wake up one day, thumb drowsily through his record collection and think, ""I'm in the mood for Neil Young, Fushitsusha, and Popol Vuh... maybe I'll start a project that sounds like the way I hear all of them together in my head."" In fact, it sounds like he did-- Ulaan Khol, his latest solo venture, makes lonely, feedback-smeared instrumentals, with a classic aura that feels like an archeological discovery. Now I'm even more jealous. III follows 2008's I and II, concluding a ""maximalist three-part suite"" that Smith calls ""Ceremony"". This may not be the best installment, but it's the most diverse and engaging. That's due to Smith's adding more bass and drums to his guitar journeys, as well as injecting more melody into his noisy haze. There are still lots of plaintive guitar-only pieces, rightly compared in press materials to the desolate reverb of Neil Young's Dead Man soundtrack. But the cuts that hit hardest have a rock thrust, like elongated psych breaks liberated from the shackles of verse-chorus-verse. Take track two (all the pieces here are untitled), which follows the album's dark opener with a thundering all-out groove. It recalls two great underground psych/noise outfits, Japan's Marble Sheep and Portland's Davis Redford Triad, and the way they make a wandering guitar jam feel as uplifting as a hot-air balloon ride. But the track also has an accessibility that reaches overground into the territory of Jimi Hendrix's woolier explorations. Its song-like structure echoes through the rest of the album, so that even noisier, drumless pieces take on traceable shapes. Still, the heart of this project is solo guitar journeys, and III ends with Ulaan Khol's longest one-- a 10-minute stretch of strumming that folds slowly into dissonance. It's hypnotic and immersive, but if you prefer clarity to volume, you might find it more disorienting than soothing. An album of only those treks would probably appeal solely to diehards, but the ""Ceremony"" trilogy is wider than that. Smith has shaped his guitar essays into something more tangible-- and, as a result, more communicative.","The prolific, talented avant artist completes his ""maximalist three-part suite"" with its most diverse and engaging entry.

Guitar El Chark,Omar Khorshid,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a9639d034d5c69bf3c3e/1:1/w_160/6ee6dcae.jpg,2010-04-26 06:00:03,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14171-guitar-el-chark/,Sublime Frequencies,"Oum Kalthoum, Abdel Halim Hafez, Farid Al Atrache, and Mohamed Abdel Wahab are often referred to as the ""four greats"" of Arabic music. Al Atrache was Syrian, the rest were Egyptian, and all four are genuine legends in the Arab-speaking world, their music still widely played and loved. Omar Khorshid played guitar in the orchestras of two of them. He made his first foray into professional music in the mid-60s, playing in one of the Arab world's first beat groups, Les Petit Chats, and in 1968, Hafez saw them perform in Alexandria, Egypt, and asked Khorshid to join his group. Hafez worked at the time with innovative composer Baligh Hamdi, and with Khorshid in the band, they made some amazing recordings that broadened the scope of Egyptian orchestral pop music. Khorshid eventually found himself playing guitar for Oum Kalthoum, perhaps the most beloved singer the Arab world has ever had-- playing in her orchestra was the height of prestige, and to say she's still loved is a bit like saying people still think the Beatles are pretty okay. Khorshid's guitar became a part of pop landscape in the Arab world, which was centered on Egypt and Lebanon. When he moved to Lebanon in 1973, Beirut was as yet untouched by the wars that would unravel its reputation as one of the world's most cosmopolitan, vibrant cities, and Khorshid was already a true giant. The music he made in Lebanon from 1973 to 1977 is the source for Guitar El Chark, the first official compilation of his work under his own name to be released in the West. Sublime Frequencies has pulled out all the stops, issuing a gorgeous double vinyl set with a short biography in the gatefold and almost 90 minutes of music. It's a long overdue treatment for an enormously creative and vital talent. Khorshid fused the techniques of traditional Arabic oud players with Western sounds and exposing the eastern Mediterranean roots of American surf guitar music in the process. The recordings here, drawn from soundtracks and albums-- including a few Khorshid records that were marketed in the West under the exotica/bellydance banner-- show a restless desire to experiment with musical technologies just finding their way to Beirut at the time. The first song I ever heard by Khorshid was his ripping outer space surf rendition of Farid Al Atrache's classic ""Hebbina Hebbina"", which is included here with new remastering-- it's a perfect encapsulation of what made his sound so interesting and has long sent exotica buffs searching for his albums. The twitching traditional rhythms, garage-y organ, and Space Age guitar sound are instantly appealing, and the relative novelty for Western listeners is quickly transcended by the tunefulness and astounding musicianship of the playing. Also included is one of Khorshid's own versions of ""Enta Omri"", a song composed by Mohamed Abdel Wahab that became one of Oum Kalthoum's best-loved hits. Khorshid's take is sinewy and agile, moving boldly through a song that nearly everyone in Khorshid's audience would have known and capturing a piece of it for himself. The compilation closes with a record company promo spot for one of Khorshid's albums that curiously uses a version of the theme from the James Bond film You Only Live Twice as its backing music, and in many ways, it's an oddly melancholy end to the set. It's a brief, stark glimpse of the cultural bleed that made the rest of this music possible, and in fact there's a ""what might have been"" cloud that hangs over this music today. What if the West and Middle East had given in to our fascination with each other instead of our suspicion of one another? Khorshid's own life may have ended early because of the conflicts that still plague us today: He left Lebanon in 1976 to escape the war and returned to Egypt after some time in Syria. When Egyptian President Anwar Sadat traveled to Washington to sign a peace treaty with Israel in 1977, Khorshid came along. He and Jewish violinist Yehudi Menuhin performed together to mark the occasion, and many extremists never forgave him. Khorshid was just 36 and had already survived a few assassination attempts when he died in a suspicious car crash, a few months before Sadat himself was murdered. While we never got to hear where Khorshid might have taken his music had he lived, he had already taken it plenty of interesting places before his death.","One of the most legendary figures in Arabic music has the first official compilation of his work-- made in the mid-1970s-- released in the West.

Completely Removed,Medications,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a95013d1975652139843/1:1/w_160/779d2872.jpg,2010-04-26 06:00:02,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14159-completely-removed/,Dischord,"It's been five years since we last heard from Washington, D.C.'s Medications. Devin Ocampo and Chad Molter formed the band from the ashes of Faraquet, and on the group's debut EP and first LP, there was a clear tension between the knotty, agile post-punk of their former group and a more pop-informed tendency. Five years later, drummer Andrew Becker has moved on, and that more melodic side of the band has won out. Perhaps having to cover the drums as well as the guitar and bass put the remaining duo in a more studio-oriented frame of mind, but whatever the reason, there's more layering here, and a much greater focus on tunes, resulting in the band's best album. One of the keys to the album's success is that Ocampo and Molter haven't abandoned the tricky meter changes, angular riffs, and sharp musicianship that have always been their trademark. They've merely subjugated those elements of their style to catchy songs that move the band further toward the indie rock mainstream. When a wild flurry of guitar lurches out from behind the vocals on ""Home Is Where We Are"", the tangle of notes is no longer an end in itself-- it's an exclamation point that punches home a key turn of phrase in the melody. ""Seasons"" rivals their last album opener ""Surprise!"" for the best thing the band's ever done, as Ocampo and Molter trade off vocals as the guitars slash and chime. In short, it's a rush, and the surprising ""doot doot"" backing harmonies are a welcome dash of sugar to complement the spice of the guitars. For an album recorded as dry and straight as this one, it can be oddly psychedelic. Instrumental ""Kilometers and Smiles"" gives the band a chance to scratch its prog itch, and the way the heavy fuzz guitar interacts with the wordless vocal harmonies creates a trippy atmosphere. Parts sound like Black Sabbath or King Crimson, parts sound like George Harrison or Roy Harper. In other places, dabs of sax and clarinet accomplish a similar effect, helping to bring the gentle, partly acoustic arrangement of the album's quiet centerpiece, ""Brasil '07"", to life. The song bears hallmarks of its namesake country, expanding the band's musical vocabulary a great deal. Between the expanded palette and the consistently punchy songs, Completely Removed is an impressive return for Medications. The band's sound has evolved into one that should appeal to those who never went for the tangle of Faraquet or the band's earlier tendency to split the difference between songcraft and instrumental fireworks.","D.C. band formed from the ashes of Faraquet take a turn toward melodic songcraft, and the new look suits them.

Streetlights,Kurupt,by: Zach Kelly,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a94fea9e61561daa59ff/1:1/w_160/164aca6a.jpg,2010-04-26 06:00:01,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14158-streetlights/,Interscope,"California rapper Kurupt plays well with others. Never begrudging his role as a right-hand man, he's always seemed pleased just to be in the fold. One of the more recognizable characters in the past 20 years of West Coast hip-hop, Kurupt earned his stripes as a snarling, smoked-out, dangerously funny guy who bears a cross that the best character actors do: Often responsible for his projects' juiciest moments (nearly all of his tracks on Dre's 2001), he's soon resigned to the background. After last year's lauded BlaQKout, a team-up with underground legend DJ Quik, Kurupt seemed primed for a late-career renaissance, so long as he made the right alliances. Unfortunately, partnering with producer Terrace Martin wasn't a good choice. On paper it should have worked-- up-and-comer Martin is best-known for his work with Kurupt's friend and contemporary Snoop Dogg. But Martin, who produced all but one cut here (the terrific Pete Rock-helmed ""Yessir), is Streetlights' biggest weakness; he offers a selection of flat songs that ultimately come across as stale. Kurupt is left to make the most of what he has to work with, often trying uncomfortably to force a strong club-banger or aggressively spun street tale with little to fill out the weaker parts. Martin has a few strong shots in the mix-- ""I'm Drunk"" feels like an updated Compton house-party jam, evoking another of Kurupt's scene-stealing moments from 2001 (""Let's Get High""), and ""I'm the Man"" reins things in a little and gives Kurupt the space he needs to ruminate. But the missteps overshadow the positive notes in ways that are too obvious to ignore. Martin plunders the most pallid moments of the hyphy movement on single ""I'm Burnt"" (which pops up again in remix form later even though hearing it once was more than enough) and later on ""Face Down"", its murderous theme rendered borderline comical in light of its thin, cheesy bounce. Despite the album's title (Kurupt has described it as a depiction of [#script:http://pitchfork.com/media/backend/js/tiny_mce/themes/advanced/langs/en.js]|||||| street life from the point-of-view of a streetlight), Martin pushes the club appeal, but with material that feels previously discarded or simply phoned-in. While there are bits of great humor and wordplay scattered throughout (occasionally spat out in dizzying double time), the fogged-over choruses, tough-guy posturing (""In Gotti We Trust""), and spurts of disquieting misogyny (""Scrape"") feel like too much padding. On ""Questions"", reminiscent of Dre's dirty laundry-airing ""What's the Difference"", Kurupt addresses a series of inquiries-- his involvement with Suge Knight and, of course, ""Is he gonna be on Detox?""-- and answers not a single one of them, leaving the whole thing hanging. It's a shame because it would be interesting to hear Kurupt's take on these issues, but it's a good way to describe Streetlights on the whole: promising, sometimes intriguing, but ultimately unavailable for comment.","After last year's lauded DJ Quik collab BlaQKout, the former Death Row mainstay finds a less fruitful partnership in Snoop producer Terrace Martin.

Clinging to a Scheme,The Radio Dept.,by: Larry Fitzmaurice,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a9449d034d5c69bf3c0a/1:1/w_160/317ba5e4.jpg,2010-04-26 06:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14146-clinging-to-a-scheme/,Labrador,"Sweden's Radio Dept. have spent their career to date quietly building up a devoted fanbase by filtering traditional indie and dream-pop sounds through an electronic haze. They've admirably honored their genre's history every step of the way, incorporating elements of vintage Slumberland noise-pop, sadder 80s UK indie sounds, and the kind of romantic, low-key dance-pop typically associated with Saint Etienne, or more recently, the Tough Alliance. The band's relatively low profile is partly due to the infrequency of their output: Up to now, they've released only two LPs throughout their 13-year career, along with a handful of EPs and singles. As with their last two albums, Clinging to a Scheme stands to further expand the Radio Dept.'s cult. Economy has never been an issue for the band, but here, things are further tightened up: Clocking in at just 34 minutes, this album is their shortest and most finely-tuned yet, moving at a rapid clip while maintaining a sense of balance and even pacing-- a pretty remarkable show of restraint and dedication for a record that has ostensibly been in the works for four years. (Their last full-length, Pet Grief, was released way back in 2006.) The improved fidelity helps, too: These songs sparkle with striking clarity in contrast to past works, while retaining all the glowing, sun-soaked ambiance that's become a signature. Clinging to a Scheme shows the Radio Dept. working with an extended range of sounds. While the core elements of these songs will be plenty familiar to longtime fans, the band manages to tweak the formula slightly for each track. The sparkly, Balearic ""Heaven's on Fire"" and the downbeat dub of ""Never Follow Suit"" are clear highlights, particularly on first spin. But repeat plays reveal this record's almost bottomless depth, as different tracks and subtle elements gradually reveal themselves with each listen: The sugar-rushed urgency of ""This Time Around"" or the complex ""David"", which is sunny and bright musically but lyrically wistful, are just two of eight other reasons this album rewards every ounce of attention you give it. Great songs, higher fidelity: It should be a recipe for contentment, yet frontman Johan Duncanson remains discouraged by life's challenges. ""Seemed like a good idea at one time/ But now it's all wrong,"" he sings on opener ""Domestic Scene"", and it doesn't get any cheerier from there. Although the Radio Dept. weren't regularly active until 1998, the project was concieved by Duncanson three years earlier along with a few schoolmates; in other words, his lyrics have been rooted in boyhood melancholia since day one. Duncanson doesn't show any signs of leaving that behind on Clinging to a Scheme, uttering lines in ""A Token of Gratitude"" that evoke pure melodrama: ""Do I love you?/ Yes, I love you/ But easy come, easy go."" But that's part of The Radio Dept.'s charm and identity, and the music itself is generally brighter, which makes for an engaging contrast while preventing the tone of the songs from becoming maudlin. The strongest moments on Clinging to a Scheme, such as the aforementioned ""Heaven's on Fire"" and ""Never Follow Suit"", are effortlessly catchy and upbeat. Album closer ""You Stopped Making Sense"" is especially cloud-clearing, as Duncanson hits his upper register among deliciously bent guitar strings, moaning about another love lost. It's a bittersweet ending for Clinging to a Scheme, but for the Radio Dept.'s already decade-plus career, it may be a whole new beginning.","The Swedish indie pop group Radio Dept.'s third and best LP expands their sound palette with songs that sparkle with a glowing, sun-soaked ambiance.

Clay Stones,We Are the World,by: Joshua Love,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a9515e6ef959693213ca/1:1/w_160/fbc32bd8.jpg,2010-04-23 06:00:04,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14155-clay-stones/,Manimal Vinyl,"The Knife are one of the more celebrated acts to emerge in electronic music over the last decade, in large part because their sound is so distinctive. That's not to say Karin Dreijer Andersson and Olof Dreijer don't have influences, but the music they've created still feels deeply their own. Predictably enough, soundalikes have been slow in surfacing. Los Angeles-based electro-poppers We Are the World are one of the first groups to gain traction with a sound that invites comparisons to the Knife. At times on WATW's debut, Clay Stones, the similarity is frighteningly mimetic, and the references are almost always at least hovering on the horizon-- the menacing synths, the cold rhythmic precision, the heavily treated vocals. There's even a shared affinity for elaborate costumes, masks, and performance art overtures, taken to its logical extreme by WATW's counting among the group's official ranks a full-time dancer as well as a choreographer. Clay Stones is unfortunately sequenced, front-loading the group's most derivative efforts to the extent that some listeners may be compelled to give up altogether before the album's latter tracks actually show WATW starting to find their own voice. The domineering sonics and dramatic pitch-shifting of opening cut ""Foot Follows Foot"" are ripped straight from Karin and Olof's playbook, as are the doomy vocal gimmicks of the title track, ""Fight Song"", and ""Not in Death"" and the shivering synths of ""Fight Song"" and ""Afire"". Other minor influences may poke through from time to time, particularly in the vocals of frontwoman Megan Gold, who often evokes strident singers like Annie Lennox and PJ Harvey when her voice isn't being grievously manipulated. Still, not until ""Clover and Dirt"" does Clay Stones really start to point toward a genuinely interesting and individually sustainable artistic direction for WATW. That song's noisy, messy abrasion is a welcome change of pace from the icy over-compartmentalization that comes before, and the group approvingly carries it forward on the bruisingly anthemic album stand-out ""Goya Monster"" and art-damaged instrumental ""Sweet Things Are So Hard"". WATW certainly appear to have enough ideas of their own to carve out a unique identity, so it'd be a shame if they settled for being a glorified tribute act.","This L.A.-based electro pop outfit's menacing synths and treated vocals owe more than a little to the Knife's gothic techno.

The Day the Turf Stood Still,DaVinci,by: David Drake,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a95fb1335d7bf169949b/1:1/w_160/fec9df4b.jpg,2010-04-23 06:00:03,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14167-the-day-the-turf-stood-still/,Sweetbreads Creative Collective,"As readers of Shaquille O'Neal's twitter could tell you, the right medium really allows a person's personality to shine through; for whatever reason, 140-character-capped courtside iPhone interjections seemed to convincingly balance Shaq's life philosophy and knowing humor better than his rap records ever could. Play to your strengths, focus on what really matters, and you can make your message connect-- whatever the medium. DaVinci's debut record, The Day the Turf Stood Still, has been building an unusual amount of buzz for a Bay Area street rapper, particularly for a record that sounds like a conservative New York rap release. It's full of classicist NYC breakbeat loops and dense raps from an artist with a dry, static demeanor. It contains almost no aesthetic daring. But rap heads are buzzing about it for a reason, and that has a lot to do with not only DaVinci's skills as a rapper but his overarching sense of purposefulness-- he knows how to make you care. DaVinci grew up in San Francisco's Fillmore district, in the shadow of his Bay Area heroes like San Quinn and Messy Marv. He also arrived at a time when Bay Area rap has been flourishing, thanks to dynamic personalities (The Jacka, Husalah) and a shift in production styles from the classic West Coast Mob Music to the more omnivorous, populist approach of producers like DJ Fresh and the Mecanix. The Bay had begun to reinvent itself by reinventing New York, just as the latter city's national hip-hop profile had dimmed. DaVinci's record does feel like a part of this mutated New York movement, but in a distinct way. Turf is a firmly underground record, with none of the expansive choruses or crisply engineered synthesizer samples that characterize new Bay hip-hop. Additionally, DaVinci's lyrics push towards traditional concrete narratives, a retreat from contemporary Bay rap's more persona-driven styles. On first listen, to a rap fan unfamiliar with the Bay Area sound, DaVinci's record might sound like yet another rehash, another NY rapper who still can't get over the day Swizz discovered his Casio. But The Day the Turf Stood Still feels like an attempt to do something unique within the Bay's insular world, all while retaining the new Bay's characteristic cannibalizing of different moments in rap history. While his aesthetic isn't ambitious, his wider goals as an artist, his views on the world outside the music, seem like the kind of thing that fans of rap from all corners might find appealing. The Day the Turf Stood Still is strongly rooted in a sense of place-- specifically, his family's Fillmore origins. ""What You Finna Do""s ambling noir is the most explicitly political, a gangster's ennui in the face of gentrification's corruption of San Francisco's Harlem. But the most fascinating track is ""Idle Mind"", which succeeds despite its embrace of one of underground hip-hop's most regrettable clichés-- the twist-ending story. Despite that, it remains emotionally rending, a testament to DaVinci's ability to get a lot of mileage out of a limited template. Hang out with some older jazz musicians and you'll hear them describe younger players-- often highly fluent, well-rehearsed ones-- with one dismissive phrase: ""he ain't sayin nothin."" There are some acclaimed rappers today who fall easily into a similar category, relying heavily on street pedigree, class, or cultural signifying, or an overemphasis on tongue-twisting technical expertise. Charisma and creativity, musicality and personality, and particularly the idea of having something worth saying-- all more abstract criteria, admittedly-- can easily be shortchanged by those looking for the next hyphy to change the world. DaVinci's biggest strength is that while he embraces the aesthetic conservatism of 90s New York, a measured, uninterrupted monotone with a clearly-articulated cadence, he doesn't let that be the end itself; it's just a medium to convey a higher cause, to establish a rapper whose personality builds gradually from the content of his lyrics. This approach to music works so well, not in spite of his musical choices, but also not because of them; it works because his personality, as little outward swag as it demonstrates, feels true.","Bay Area rapper is making noise with his winning reinvention of not only his own area's sound, but NYC's as well.

Secret Agent,Tony Allen,by: Joshua Klein,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a96013d1975652139859/1:1/w_160/7b4a8c69.jpg,2010-04-23 06:00:02,Global,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14168-secret-agent/,NonesuchWorld Circuit,"The sticker affixed to the front of Tony Allen's new album says it all, really. ""Perhaps the greatest drummer ever,"" reads a quote from Brian Eno; ""Without Tony Allen, there'd be no Afrobeat,"" reads a quote from the late Fela Kuti. And then there's the cover of the album proper, which features the matter-of-fact sub-tag ""another one from the underground sensation."" Yet despite all the falir, it's that last one-- ""underground sensation"" that stings, and really rings true. Allen has never crossed over and become a name of wide renown, and oddly his Nonesuch debut could give the drummer his widest platform to date. Yet Secret Agent is only the latest step of a creative continuum set in motion over 40 years ago, beginning with Allen's pioneering and prolific work in Fela Kuti's band through his years as a solo act and bandleader and even, a few years back, as a quiet but important component of Damon Albarn's the Good, the Bad & the Queen project. ""Another one from the underground sensation"" both sums up Secret Agent and sells Allen a little short. After all, Allen's particular genius has been his ability to lie just behind the beat, pushing and pulling the song without calling too much attention to himself. But just because he flies below the radar hardly makes him a blip. Even on an Allen solo record, this holds true. Secret frequently directs your attention to the song's component parts-- the backing brass, Cameroonian guitarist Claude Dibongue's jazzy licks, Rody Cereyon's funky bass on tracks like ""Ijo"" or ""Ayenlo"". (Those two feature R&B-like vocals from Orobiyi Adunni, one of several guest singers; Allen himself grumbles lead on the title track and album closer ""Elewon Po"".) In fact, it's so easy to get lost in these elements that Allen almost blends into the background, camouflaged, his cymbal pings, rolls, and ghost strokes like rivets holding the whole construct together. Granted, Secret Agent doesn't represent Afrobeat at its most fiery, but it does represent Allen (nearing 70) continuing his late career high, mellow in the way he swings songs like ""Busybody"" or ""Pariwo"" (the latter surprisingly strident nonetheless despite its gentle, accordion-laden gait) but never more confident. Leave it to Fela scions Seun and Femi (among other aspirants to the Afrobeat throne) to swagger like they've got something to prove. But Tony Allen? Allen as always lies back and waits for you to come to him.","The famed Afrobeat drummer, one of the pioneers of modern African music, makes his Nonesuch debut.

All Days are Nights: Songs for Lulu,Rufus Wainwright,by: Joshua Love,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a94e9d034d5c69bf3c1d/1:1/w_160/c2dfe480.jpg,2010-04-23 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14156-all-days-are-nights-songs-for-lulu/,Decca,"Rufus Wainwright seems only fitfully interested in being a pop musician. That's certainly his prerogative, but it's not great for those who love the things he can do with a four-minute tune. Throughout his admirable yet frustrating career, Wainwright's assorted passions (for opera, for theatre, for Judy Garland) have led his music down paths that were often more intriguing in theory than execution. He should be lauded for allowing nothing to dictate his artistic choices, with the understanding that such boldness opens him up for criticism when he bites off more than he can chew. However, the real danger with an artist who listens solely to his own muse is that he'll cut off the outside world, making music that can't be related to or enjoyed by anyone but himself. Wainwright gets closer than ever to that vanishing point of self-absorption on his latest effort, All Days Are Nights: Songs for Lulu. The only things you hear on the album are Wainwright's voice and his piano, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. The problem is that he wants you to luxuriate in both when it's far more likely you'll feel like you're drowning, given how rarely Wainwright buoys the listener with an actual melody or memorable lyric. Wainwright's biography is fascinating-- child of famed folk singers Loudon Wainwright III and the recently departed Kate McGarrigle, an openly gay performer who's been an outspoken social activist yet also battled serious addictions. Still, it's a bit much for Wainwright to ask his listeners to follow as he enumerates Big Apple landmarks (""Who Are You New York?"") or sings for six minutes in French (""Les feux d'artifice t'appellent"") or transcribes a phone conversation with his singer-songwriter sister (""Martha""). This is particularly true if our only accompaniment is going to be plodding piano chords and mooning vocals (a symptom that's stretched to almost-hilarious extremes on ""Zebulon"" when Wainwright resorts to sounding the same single piano note several times in succession). Even when the words are gift-wrapped for him, however, Wainwright struggles. Three of the album's songs find him setting music to Shakespeare sonnets, but only his arrangement of ""Sonnet 20"", often held up as proof of the Bard's homosexuality, manages to avoid being a droning mess that actually saps power from those legendary verses. As for the most salvageable of the songs that are solely Wainwright's own, ""The Dream"" is admittedly movingly sung, but the only genuine keeper is ""True Loves"", a heartbreaking tune about how happy lovers make lonely people feel miserable that's so universal in sentiment it feels like a modern-day standard. Something anyone can enjoy-- imagine that.","The talented pop singer flirts with outright self-absorption on his latest record, a solo piano effort on which he bites off more than he can chew.

The Chaos,The Futureheads,by: Stuart Berman,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a965b1335d7bf16994a8/1:1/w_160/a52bb35c.jpg,2010-04-23 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14173-the-chaos/,NulDovecote,"It'd be a shame if history only remembered the Futureheads for one near-perfect album (2004's self-titled debut) and for being unlikely forerunners of the current Kate Bush revival (thanks to that album's heroic ""Hounds of Love"" cover). But that tricky balance-- between buzzsaw aggression, mathematical complexity, and bubblegum accessibility-- the Sunderland quartet once deftly executed proved difficult to strike on subsequent releases. The result was a more pedestrian, power-pop aesthetic, and, by 2008's This Is Not the World, a band once near the head of the post-millennial post-punk class was threatening to be demoted to one of its also-rans. It's a situation the Futureheads themselves seem all too aware of-- as singer Barry Hyde observes toward the end of their new, fourth album: ""The first 5,000 miles/ Are the hardest steps to take/ But then your autopilot/ Kicks in for the journey's sake."" Fortunately, with The Chaos, the Futureheads kick the robots out of the captain's deck and switch off the cruise control, resulting in a more accelerated journey marked by more sharp left turns than the group attempted on its past two albums. But if The Chaos is supposed to represent a hit of the reset button, the Futureheads couldn't have selected a more misleading single than ""Heartbeat Song""-- skinny-tied new wave dressed up in modern-rock clothing, landing somewhere between XTC's Drums and Wires and the Warped Tour. Thankfully, it proves to be more an exit point from This Is Not the World's overdriven anthemery than a continuation of it; the rest of The Chaos mostly captures the Futureheads playing to their strength: channelling everyday miseries into manic energy. The best Futureheads originals (""Decent Days and Nights"", ""First Day"") left you feeling alternately exhilarated and disoriented, abruptly stopping just as you acclimatized yourself to their delirious logic and rhythm. It's a sensation ably approximated here by ""Stop the Noise"" and ""The Connector"", the latter a song about electricity that, appropriately, is wound tighter than a magnetic coil, its mechanistic drive routinely jolted by shocks of group harmony. And even when the choruses don't quite deliver the promised payoff (see: the repeated titular hollers of ""I Can Do That"" and ""Sun Goes Down""), the tense verse/bridge build-ups are gratifying. But if The Chaos marks the point where the Futureheads admit to themselves that the past ain't so bad, closing track ""Jupiter""-- clocking in at a career-topping four minutes-- points to an intriguing new direction where the Futureheads apply their eccentricities to lengthier, more conceptual pieces. After all, that first Futureheads album contained so many structural shifts, operatic harmonies, and loopy melodic fragments, it was practically a prog-rock album smashed into two-minute smithereens; ""Jupiter"" suggests the possibility that the sum could be as great as the parts.","After a few records of unwelcome detours, the Futureheads mostly ditch the attempts at anthems and re-embrace some of their eccentricities.

The Endtables,The Endtables,by: Marc Masters,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a95e5e6ef959693213e5/1:1/w_160/39612118.jpg,2010-04-22 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14166-the-endtables/,Drag City,"There have been some thorough examinations of post-punk-- Simon Reynolds' Rip It Up and Start Again being the most exhaustive-- but could any study ever be complete? The reservoir of out-of-print/never-in-print gems from the fertile late 1970s and early 80s would have to dry up, and that hasn't happened yet. The last few years alone have seen excellent reissues of San Francisco's Units, New York's Interference, London's Lines, and Georgia's Method Actors. Writing about the latter, Pitchfork's Andy Battaglia guessed that the ""post-punk vault... would almost have to be empty at this point."" You'd think so, but mere weeks after the Method Actors release, Drag City has unearthed another treasure deserving of a new audience. Formed in Louisville in 1978, the Endtables lasted less that two years, releasing just one four-song EP while together. The Endtables compiles that EP, a posthumous two-song single, and six live tracks, painting a quick, sharp portrait of a band that sounded like they were in a hurry. Chugging along at a palpitating clip, the group flies toward the sun of the Buzzcocks and Gang of Four, but something about their hyper energy makes them a little more off-kilter than those groups. Like a sonic game of Jenga, their tunes feel like they could spill into unruly cacophony at the slightest nudge. That never happens, but it's not for lack of pushing and shoving by guitarist Alex Durig and singer Steve Rigot. Rigot in particular has a uniquely skewed rhythm, biting off his words in strident yelps like the Undertones' Feargal Sharkey if you cut all of his lines in half. One of the best things about post-punk was the way many singers-- Ian Curtis, Mark Mothersbaugh, David Thomas-- turned technically imperfect voices into weapons through phrasing and attitude. Thomas may be the closest parallel to the bulbous Rigot, who certainly deserves a place in that patchwork pantheon of inventive vocalists. Durig is equally creative, slashing his chords across the songs like a whip across skin. But it's Rigot's delivery that gives these songs a mix of robotic staccato and wiry nerve. Highlights abound-- the engine-rev of ""Process of Elimination"", the rubber-band snap of ""Circumcision""-- but the six studio songs are most notable for how little they deviate from the quality level established in the first note. The live tracks are less even-- endearingly earnest and raw but often rather illegible. A few little twists, like an interlude of Clean-style garage swing in ""Europe"", a song they never recorded in the studio, hint at some other places this band could've gone. But as a self-contained document of a lightning-quick, pretension-free moment in time, The Endtables is pretty spot on.","Drag City unearths yet another worthwhile nugget from the post-punk vault, compiling the work of a group that sounded like an off-kilter Buzzcocks.

Lux,Disappears,by: Joe Colly,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a9549d034d5c69bf3c28/1:1/w_160/5b8c7ec0.jpg,2010-04-22 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14162-lux/,Kranky,"Disappears is made up of some Chicago scene veterans-- Brian Case of garage-rock favorites the Ponys as well as several members of the defunct post-rock band Boas. Their music combines elements of both groups, but it nearly became a casualty of the industry's current financial mess. Disappears were the very last act signed to Touch and Go before the label shut down, and as a result, their debut, Lux, was almost lost in the shuffle. Luckily they were eventually scooped up by Kranky, and though their style differs considerably from the experimental and ambient that label is known for, it seems a good fit for Disappears' dense and foreboding sound. Disappears' sound is a pared-down, drone-heavy mixture of Velvet Underground scuzz, garage-rock energy, and krautrock propulsion. It may not feel like the most unique approach, but, importantly, the band seems aware of that. Part of Disappears' appeal is that they've chosen to work within a set of stylistic and sonic limitations, where vocals and instrumentation are stripped back to their most essential. It's more about minimalism and mastering the basics than making something brand-new. It works because Disappears keep things tight; even though there's heaviness and repetition in these tracks, usually they're about three minutes long. ""Gone Completely"" is a killer opener, a rush of fuzz-laden guitars and simple, severe drumming. On this track and throughout the album, frontman Case's vocals are buried in the mix just right-- his delivery is kind of a Britt Daniel-meets-Iggy Pop sing-speak-- and clouded in the feedback his words sound more powerful, like they're trying to escape. The band mostly finds a comfortable zone and rides it, but each track tweaks the formula just so, and the mood stays jet-black dark throughout. Things do start to feel a bit same-y toward the end of the record. On ""Little Ghost"" and ""New Cross"", it sounds like the band is revisiting ideas they touched on earlier. But when a group is working in such tight confines, some overlap is natural. That the goal here is intentionally limited ultimately works for and against Disappears-- they achieve the sound they want, and it does sound good, but it's hard to think of Lux as much more than that, because the components are so familiar. Still, that they're able to make these well-worn rock tropes feel quite so menacing after all this time is an achievement in its own right.","Chicago band that includes members of the Ponys and Boas brings its jagged rock mix from Touch and Go to Kranky.

Kush and Orange Juice,Wiz Khalifa,by: Tom Breihan,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a95213d1975652139849/1:1/w_160/ab3db86c.jpg,2010-04-22 06:00:02,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14160-kush-and-orange-juice/,,"Kids love them some Wiz Khalifa. In a recent Washington City Paper review, the rap blogger Noz described a sold-out 9:30 Club full of late-teens/early-twenties fans, all singing along with the young Pittsburgh rapper's entire set. A little bit of YouTube research shows similar scenes-- at clubs across the country, not just the ones in the Eastern corridor. And when Kush and Orange Juice, the new Wiz mixtape, hit the internet last week, it was a #1 Twitter trending topic for most of the day. And though it's important not to put too much stock in something as ephemeral as trending topics, it at least means there are a whole lot of people talking about a rapper with no major label deal and no superstar allegiances. It's pretty impressive. Wiz's appeal isn't too hard to figure out. Though he lost his deal with Warner Bros. a while back, you never hear any of the bitterness usually associated with big-label refugees. Instead, he talks his shit with a blasé assurance; one chorus on the mixtape goes, ""We belong on the top, but we ain't trippin'/ Cuz we'll get there in a minute."" For the most part, he raps about only three things: Weed, girls, and smoking weed with girls (usually your girl). His rap style is easy and conversational, a pinched murmur that never leans too hard on punchlines or narrative. He's got this donkey giggle that he lets loose often, and it might beat out Lil Wayne's guffaw as rap's most irritating laugh, no mean feat. He sounds like the kid two dorm rooms down, bragging about whatever insane party he was at last night while he munches Froot Loops out of the box and watches cartoons on the common-room TV. He's charismatic in a completely relatable way. He's also got a great ear for beats. The tracks are airy, diffuse things, full of smooth 1980s-funk synths and drums that amble along slowly and quietly. His choices in samples suggest a lot of time watching TV while stoned: Frou Frou's Garden State end-credits song ""Let Go"" on ""In the Cut"", Disney princess Demi Lovato's Camp Rock soundtrack single ""Our Time Is Here"" on ""We're Done"". ""Good Dank"" is all warm, rippling psych-funk-- its guitars and organs woozy as all hell, its drums completely nonexistent. And rather than bulldozing through these beats, Wiz just dances around them, never letting his delivery settle into a consistent cadence. Often, he sings his choruses in a calm, casual quaver. Sometimes, he skips rapping altogether. On ""Up"", he spends four minutes just singing the praises of weed over spaced-out Rhodes plinks, ending by repeating, ""Everything's better when you're high,"" over and over. When a more conventional rapper like Killa Kyleon or Big K.R.I.T. shows up, the contrast speaks volumes. Those guys are both very good at what they do, but they sound almost old-fashioned in this context, nicely breaking up the half-committed shit-talk. Wiz never sounds like he has a lot at stake; he talks like life is a long, unchanging progression of joints and hotel rooms and girls, which, for him, maybe it is. Among his most characteristic lines is this: ""While you at home on Twitter, trying to hack her page and shit/ We smoking and cracking jokes on how lame you is."" That kind of indolent wit can lead to some truly dubious ideas, like when Wiz sang Beyoncé's ""If I Were a Boy"" as ""If I Were a Lame"" on 2009's Burn After Rolling mixtape, or when he tries his hand at reggae on ""Still Blazin"" here. But for the most part, Kush and Orange Juice is a surprisingly relaxed and easy listen, a great soundtrack for a barbecue or a spring-weather drive. And that's all it wants to be, so mission accomplished.","Without a major label deal or superstar allegiances, Wiz has turned himself into a hip-hop star by rapping about weed, girls, and smoking weed with girls.

Travellers in Space and Time,The Apples in Stereo,by: Paul Thompson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a947b1335d7bf1699473/1:1/w_160/de325218.jpg,2010-04-22 06:00:01,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14148-travellers-in-space-and-time/,Elephant SixYep RocSimian,"Math? Schmath. In early 2007, the Apples in Stereo reemerged from a long hiatus with a fine new album, New Magnetic Wonder, and a bunch of talk of the ""Non-Pythagorean Musical Scale."" It was something only a nerd like Apples frontman Robert Schneider could conjure: a non-traditional tuning system that, once your ears adjusted to its logic, started to make its own oddball sense. That Schneider, a scholar of form, spent his time off sitting around thinking big thoughts about pop music was a comfort, but the record belied any geek speak. The songs were pretty damn good, and that was plenty to wrap one's ears around. Three years later, and the Apples-- while still tinkering with the Non-Pythagorean stuff off and on-- have returned with a collection of tunes mostly hinging on a much much simpler equation: four on the floor. Much of Travellers in Space and Time finds the sunshine popsters toying with a kind of slippery space-disco. Sure, it's more Leo Sayer than Donna Summer: trebly, a tad technical, still heavy on the pop-rock instrumentation rather than the genuine article. But the fact that you can sorta get down with a sumptuous-sounding, hook-forward Apples in Stereo record is a neat thing, and Schneider's sure not to flub it. His last foray into genre-hopping, the punky-pop of Velocity of Sound, seemed to represent a dearth of ideas, but he seems at home over these slinky grooves, despite a near-complete lack of precedence for this in their mammoth back catalog. ""Dance Floor"" and the sweeping ""Hey Elevator"" match huge hooks with a body-moving throb at once tightly wound and sumptuously breezy. But best of the bunch is ""C.P.U."", a mutant hybrid of T. Rex crunch and ""Baby Elephant Walk"" that wobbles and whirrs to an unlikely groove. Travellers isn't strictly a disco record; this being the Apples in Stereo, there's still plenty of gleaming Beatlesy pop and 70 AM gold to go around. The gooey bubblegum of ""No One in the World"", the sprightly ""Dignified Dignitary"", and the warbly vocodered blip of ""Strange Solar System"" are all sumptuous, a little strange, and seriously hooky. The production is lean, spacious, incandescent; the man knows how to polish a track. And he's got good taste in co-conspirators, too; Schneider's old buddy Bill Doss (Olivia Tremor Control/Sunshine Fix) joins the fold permanently here, and takes the lead on a couple of tracks; his songs, more than Schneider's, further the smooth ELO/Wings vibe of the New Magnetic Wonder tracks to good effect. As ever, these songs aren't the deepest lyrically: Schneider's more concerned with achieving a classic sound, which results in a lot of universal sentiment that can at times border on the trite. But there's certainly no shortage of well-crafted, playful, memorable tunes here, and that-- matched with Schneider's willingness to try on a few new sounds for size-- adds up to the best Apples in Stereo record in more than a decade.","The E6 vets continue their welcome comeback with an album that pairs the usual ELO/Wings pop with dancier, looser tunes.

Subiza,Delorean,by: Andrew Gaerig,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a94513d1975652139831/1:1/w_160/bb739ba3.jpg,2010-04-22 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14147-subiza/,True Panther,"Delorean helped define the bright, beachside vibe of last summer's indie landscape, but they also deserve to be placed in a broader context. On their new album, Subiza, the Spanish four-piece deploys the build-and-burst tempos of 90s house and techno music, and they do so explicitly, never shying away from arms-in-the-air piano bridges or incandescent raves. This music is proudly informed by the resiliency and vigor of classic club music, and its title (named after the Basque town in which the album was recorded) recalls the famously nightclub-centric Ibiza and the Balearic dance music that originated there. Delorean's musical growth isn't far removed from the evolution of Primal Scream. Like Delorean, Primal Scream were a dance-rock band with more traditional, rock-leaning origins (Delorean formed as a no-frills indie group) who ended up embracing druggy dance subculture. Over time, Screamadelica became a part of the 1990s pop firmament to the point where it no longer sounds like a blending of much of anything. Depending on which ways the trend-winds blow, observers may one day question why Subiza was ever labeled as anything more than uptempo indie rock. The band definitely has that pedigree, crafting four- and five-minute verse/chorus pop songs. Singer/bassist Ekhi Lopetegi has a slightly pinched, accented delivery that lends intrigue and emotional resonance to lines like ""Would you ever make yourself this decision I've made?"" (from ""Grow""). Sonically, Delorean borrow from chilled trance and piano-heavy Italian house, but like any music fan in 2010, their interests are varied. The pitch-shifted chipmunk vocals that orbit ""Real Love"" are drawn from hip-hop; the warped female voice that echoes ""Maybe"" during the refrain of ""Grow"" is lifted from dubstep. There's more than a little Merriweather Post Pavilion in the whirring rave of ""Infinite Desert"". The band even runs a club-heavy blog, and when they're not playing live, their massive DJ sets feature faintly familiar house tracks that hit a perfect nostalgic nerve. Delorean's 2009 EP, Ayrton Senna, was recorded in-studio, but for Subiza, the band made a conscious move toward electronic production, laying down dozens of tracks and building the rhythms on sequencers and drum machines. The overall sound remains similar to Ayrton Senna's totemic dance-pop, but Subiza feels tighter and more congealed. What the songs lose in clarity (ratchet those vocal levels down a bit, guys), they gain in cohesion: Subiza is uncommonly bound by tempo and mood. While hardly modest, Delorean have toned down their anthems, so that much of Subiza feels like a very tiny, very personal rave. Subiza sounds like a simple and straightforward record. It's bright and quick and full of easy sentiment. Its songs bleed in and out of one another effortlessly, but it's also surprisingly varied. It contains few obvious singles, yet its winning moments-- those piano breakdowns, the ""Get up/ Get up/ Get up"" bridge of ""Stay Close"", and the resplendent chorus of ""Warmer Places""-- pile up and leave you dizzy. Synth-pop, Balearic disco, indie house: Call it what you want. Delorean just make beautiful, modern pop music.","The band whose Ayrton Senna EP helped define last summer's bright, beachy sound gains momentum with a beautifully surging, shimmering trance-pop LP.

$,Mark Sultan,by: Stephen M.

Ever since he served as drummer and singer in the notorious Canadian punk act the Spaceshits in the 1990s, he's been fashioning harsh psych, rangey country, dreamy doo-wop, 50s juvie punk, and anarchic noise into strange, catchy, jubilant, occasionally jokey pop songs. He's also made a virtue out of his one-man-band set-up and his irreverent affection for the darker corners of rock history. In the last year, he has branched out into more collaborative projects, however-- donning a choir robe for the garage-gospel group the Almighty Defenders, a (hopefully) one-off collaboration with Black Lips, and playing Ding to Bloodshot Bill's Dong in the Ding-Dongs. Sultan also resumed his role in BBQ Show for another album (and a coloring book!) with friend and longtime cohort King Khan. As plain-old Mark Sultan, however, Mark Sultan is less prolific, with only one solo album and a string of one-man-band shows under a variety of increasingly bizarre pseudonyms like Celeb Prenup and Blortz. Whatever banner he's flying, however, the sound remains the same, and his latest effort-- which isn't titled so much as branded with a dollar sign-- snaps and crackles with a familiar, flailing energy, as if any of these songs might fall apart at any moment. With a voice that recalls Afghan Whigs' Greg Dulli and Journey's Steve Perry in equal measure, Sultan reigns over the album, whether singing against a broken music box and shredding guitar or crooning on R&B-rattled tracks. Especially compared to King Khan's thousand-limbed Shrines, Sultan emphasizes austerity and economy, and his one-man band sounds most invigorated when he's immediate and concise, entertaining a melody and an idea for no more than a few minutes before fixing his gaze on the next. Too often on $ he makes too much of a glorious mess. Songs meander, repeat sections to diminishing returns, and often just hang around too long. Opener ""Icicles"" begins with an aimless guitar jam that staggers around [#script:http://pitchfork.com/media/backend/js/tiny_mce/themes/advanced/langs/en.js]|||||| for four tiresome minutes before finally getting to the end of the song; it's like listening to ice melt. ""Ten of Hearts"" may be one of his best doo-wop retreads, cutting through a lot of the revivalism to express something sincere and bittersweet, but there's no reason for it to be five minutes long. It'd be a tragedy if Sultan ever curtailed his wilder impulses or slowed his pace, but reining in his indulgences might have turned $ into $$.","Garage-rock fixture-- whether as BBQ Show, an Almighty Defender, or any of his other numerous projects-- releases a rare LP under his own name.

Ear Drums and Black Holes,Starkey,by: Nate Patrin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a929ea9e61561daa59af/1:1/w_160/ea211be7.jpg,2010-04-21 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14126-ear-drums-and-black-holes/,Planet µ,"As dubstep has spread to an American fanbase, artists like Rusko and Emalkay have theorized that stateside audiences gravitate toward the harder stuff, the heavy bass of dubstep's aggro side. For a while, Starkey fit this profile. The Philly-based producer's early releases (""Corner Store Riddim"", ""Pins"", ""Bounce"") sounded like a dry run for a new, heavy American take on classic 2-step. Starkey's debut album, Ephemeral Exhibits, put the gloss on his street bass sound: The beats stayed massive, but rave pianos, electro synths, and ghostly, pitched-up divas gave them a bright neon hue. Starkey's gift for matching melodic complexity to his forceful rhythms became clear-- tracks that could've otherwise just sounded huge wound up feeling moving as well. With his second album, Ear Drums and Black Holes, Starkey amplifies those tendencies-- every beat is matched to a soulful melody. Granted, it's a particularly wonky kind of soul. Starkey's compositions are filtered through the heavy buzzes and oscillating warbles of the post-Joker sound. So you get these soaring, emotive melodies, with 2-step beats loosely translated into contemporary R&B (""Neck Snap"") or American club rap (""Murderous Words"") that unfold into ultra-dense counterpoints between sweetly toned harmonies and clobbering low-end. And the tracks get more compelling the further those roles are blurred: The fundamentals of great bass music rely on every component reacting to and building on the rhythm, and in the purplish ""11th Hour"" or the rave-evoking ""Multidial"", multiple rhythms merge into a big wave of percussive harmony. The effect is nothing short of euphoric. Yet for all its epic sweep, there's a certain lightheartedness and a sly sense of humor here-- a self-aware sense of playing with stylistic expectations. When the Underworld-esque ""Fourth Dimension"" baits the listener with a 4/4 throb in its first minute, only to switch to a gelatinous bassline, it's a great joke; when Starkey reincorporates the false-start melody into the track midway through, it's a stroke of brilliance. And even the Auto-Tune makes an odd sort of sense, cropping up on ""Spacecraft"" and ""Alienstyles"" where it feels right at home in the tracks' subtly tongue-in-cheek sci-fi futurism. Starkey's style is rich with crossover potential, yet it could use a bit more adaptation to the hip-hop influences with which it feels made to fuse. Maybe it comes down to picking the right MC for the job-- ""Bounce"" combined dubstep with Young Dro's hook and made it work, after all-- but Starkey's beats accommodate Londoner P Money's rapidfire grime flow (""Numb"") more comfortably than the simple, halting cadence of San Antonio indie-rapper Cerebral Vortex (""Murderous Words""; ""Club Games""). Still, the job of bringing dubstep to the States has a worthy heir in Starkey, an ambassador of the style that proves American crowds don't have to stick with the hard and bleak.","On his second album, Starkey amplifies his gift for matching melodic complexity to forceful rhythms, every bass-heavy beat matched to a soulful melody.

It's hard for a band that operates on their level-- semi-prominent in certain circles with the odd stab of almost-fame here and there, such as when they opened for Tool-- to keep people interested for that long. They seemed sort of on their way in the late 1990s, when they were at their peak, making records that in hindsight anticipated some of the trends of the following decade at the crossroads of rock and electronic music. A couple of substandard albums in the early to mid-00s seemed to kill their momentum, but 2007's Sex Change was a strong return to form, and now we have the band's ninth proper album, Thing, which isn't quite as solid as its predecessor but still plays to the band's strengths. They've backed off the very up-front and straight vocals that helped Sex Change sound so fresh for them-- on the only two tracks with vocals, Means hides inside a vocoder cocoon that works well but still feels like a retreat to their comfort zone, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. So you get your sci-fi post-rock like ""Space Dock"", which would fit neatly on the Tron soundtrack, and ""Naked Singularity"", which is like the ""Knight Rider"" theme turned inside out and remixed with heavy metal drums. For a band that never seemed to take itself all that seriously, the aesthetic decisions Trans Am made ages ago fit with remarkably well with what's going on in music now. The nods to funk, the krautrock rhythms, the hints of electro, the occasional glitch in the beat-- all are just part of indie rock these days. There are times when Trans Am does it better than anyone-- fractured and funky ""Arcadia"", with its storm of delayed guitar set against locked-in drums and sequencer, is a good example, while ""Interstellar Drift"" does something similar, only with an insistent motorik bass and drum pulse. And so Trans Am are in an odd place. The band is the oblivious kid that that never paid attention to fashion who suddenly finds that the look he's always had is cool. They still gets bogged down in places, padding the album with go-nowhere interludes and a six-minute centerpiece that's mostly too chaotic to make any impact, but on the album's best tracks, it's great to hear them again, doing what they do best.","The long-running electro-rock band seems over its dull patch from a few years ago, continuing the bump in quality evinced on 2007's Sex Change.

The Incredible String Band / The 5000 Spirits or the Layers of the Onion / The Hangman's Beautiful Daughter / Wee Tam and the Big Huge,Incredible String Band,by: Andrew Gaerig,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a955b1335d7bf169948d/1:1/w_160/ffce8a42.jpg,2010-04-21 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14153-the-incredible-string-band-the-5000-spirits-or-the-layers-of-the-onion-the-hangmans-beautiful-daughter-wee-tam-and-the-big-huge/,Fledg'ling,"In the liner notes to these carefully packaged reissues, all four of the Incredible String Band principals-- co-founder Clive Palmer, core duo Mike Heron and Robin Williamson, and Elektra records executive Joe Boyd-- offer their insights in separate essays. Three of them mention the smell of patchouli. Such were the times, certainly, but the ISB are loved equally by avant-garde musicians, psychedelia enthusiasts, and those slightly dweeby young gentlemen who hang around music shops on college campuses. The reissue of their first four albums probably put to rest any notion that the ISB were a properly great band, releasing just one true classic, but they were rarely anything less than brave, inspired, and profoundly weird. These reissues contain no extras or unreleased material, which might call to question their utility, but much of this music has been out of print in the U.S., or at least difficult to acquire, for years (previous reclamations only unearthed odd pieces of the catalog). The remastering was necessary, but my old copy of The Hangman's Beautiful Daughter never sounded too thin or affectless; the new versions offer more space between the instruments and a general clarity, but they're not revelations in the way that many mid-1960s edits are. The ISB probably weren't the first band to incorporate Eastern modes and instruments into folk music, but they were the first to achieve any manner of noticeable repute doing so. By 1968 the group was selling out venues like the Royal Albert Hall; they played at Woodstock. They had famous fans-- Paul McCartney and Robert Plant were public admirers-- and they still do: Stephen Malkmus once called ISB ""the greatest band of all time."" There remain plenty of reasons to think about the ISB in 2010, not the least of which are the raves garnered by the likes of Joanna Newsom and Grizzly Bear. Messy, schoolyard orchestras like Neutral Milk Hotel and the Decemberists owe a debt as well. The ISB met while playing in folk clubs around Scotland. They started slowly: Their self-titled debut was a mostly guitars-and-voices affair that openly aped Bob Dylan and Donovan. Heron and Williamson would grow to be legitimately adventurous songwriters, but neither is an overbearing personality, and the debut is understated. Gypsy violins (""Maybe Someday"") and Celtic influences (""Schaeffer's Jig"") hinted at broader vistas, but the self-titled is strictly for completists. After the debut, Palmer split for the hippie trail while Williamson departed for Morocco, later returning with armfuls of (at the time) exotic instruments. The 5000 Spirits or Layers of the Onion was released during 1967's ""Summer of Love"", and everything from the album's painfully fried cover to its gently progressive arrangements (sitars, saloon pianos, bongos) reinforces this. Williamson and Heron earn credit as individual songwriters, and each album contains hints of competition. Heron wins 5000 Spirits via ""The Hedgehog's Song"", a small blues-pop masterpiece, and the fact that the more adventurous Williamson still seems dependent on the facile eccentricity of psychedelia. Nothing, however, was facile about The Hangman's Beautiful Daughter. The band finally earns its name, stuffing complex songs full of dulcimers, gimbris, ouds, and harps. The ISB are pretty easy to figure out, if you want to: Hangman's is their best album, and its centerpiece, Heron's ""A Very Cellular Song"", is their best song. It's a 13-minute tour de force, and I'd swap the band's first two albums for it to last one minute longer, so completely does it outpace the rest of their catalog. The rest of Hangman's is similarly superior, as everything from the pop gems (""Mercy I Cry City"") to the true oddities (""The Minotaur's Song"", in which the narrator bellows, ""Porridge for my porridge bowl!"" and a chorus echoes him, ""Porridge for his porridge bowl!"") seem richer, weirder, and more fun. Hangman's showed the band could benefit from excess, and its 2xLP followup, Wee Tam and the Big Huge, tested that. Released the same year as Hangman's, Official Band Girlfriends Rose and Licorice played increasing roles in loosely conceived epics about religion and myth. It's easier listening than Hangman's, with the band blending psych and folk smoothly; sitars rub against guitars without any hint of experimentation. Williamson's monstrous nine-minute jams (""Ducks on a Pond"" and ""Maya"") themselves justify the sprawl, but the band also loses itself in religious imagery (""The Mountain of God"") and far-flung melodies. Many reissues see the involved rally around the idea that it's ""all about the music, man"" in some sort of arcane attempt to shout down context. The ISB are delightfully aware of their place in history, as everything from their essays to the unmistakably dated 5000 Spirits suggests. The patchouli, it turns out, mattered. But the ISB helped bring Eastern and African influence to folk music, and Hangman's and WT&TBH set the table for some of the conceptual epics we still see today.

I See the Sign,Sam Amidon,by: Amanda Petrusich,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a946c0084474cd0c0fe9/1:1/w_160/423fb336.jpg,2010-04-21 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14149-i-see-the-sign/,Bedroom Community,"Sam Amidon's idea of recomposition-- of excavating Appalachian folksongs; rearranging, repurposing, and creating a dissociation that feels uniquely contemporary-- isn't exactly unprecedented. Musicians-- like A.P. Carter, who scrambled up and down Clinch Mountain in the late 1920s, collecting local songs for the Carter Family's repertoire-- have been reinventing folk songs since before we knew to call them folk songs. That's part of what folk music is, and does. What separates Amidon from the scrum of revivalists and archivists is how modern these renditions are. I See the Sign, Amidon's third folk LP, doesn't contain any original tracks, but his interpretations are so singular that it stops mattering how (or if) these songs existed before-- all that matters is how they exist now. Amidon grew up singing folk music in Brattleboro, Vermont; his parents were members of the Word of Mouth chorus, a community choir which performed sacred harp hymns in the 1970s. Culturally, folk music is inextricably linked to the south (and Appalachia in particular), but rural Vermont has birthed its fair share of traditional strummers (pick up Margaret MacArthur's Folksongs of Vermont for an impeccable primer). Amidon inhabits these songs comfortably, with an ease that belies a childhood spent with a fiddle in one hand and a banjo in the other. Much of I See the Sign's success can be chalked up to its arrangements, which are fractured and frequently off-kilter; Amidon and his cabal of collaborators-- Nico Muhly, Ben Frost, Shahzad Ismaily-- have been merging chamber music with indie rock for awhile now (see also: Sufjan Stevens, Thomas Bartlett, Owen Pallett, Bryce and Aaron Dessner of the National), and their touch is nuanced and, on occasion, delightfully odd. Bits of percussion, distorted bursts of Moog, and hits of celesta pop up and recede, snapping into place like puzzle pieces. The arrangements are never bombastic (unlike what happens when, say, a pop artist gets paired with a philharmonic)-- instead, they're violent (the stabbing bass and scuttling percussion of opener ""Here Come That Blood"") or stiff and lonely (the restrained electric guitar and puffs of strings on ""I See the Sign""). On ""You Better Mind"", Amidon, harmonizing with Beth Orton, gets backup from threatening squeals of strings: ""You've got to give an account of the judgment, you better mind,"" they caution. Their voices are grave, concerned. As a vocalist, Amidon is preternaturally calm, and his flat repetition of certain couplets (""Found my lost sheep,"" ""Loose horse in the valley"") feels mesmeric and mantra-like. He's poised, but never cold, and I See the Sign can play like a gospel record, with all the attendant modes and lessons. These are songs to live by (or in), and these iterations-- despite their sophistication, despite his stoicism-- never feel like museum pieces or anything less than functional. The only non-traditional track here is a cover of R. Kelly's ""Relief"". On paper, the choice feels a little like a trap (R. Kelly fills an odd role for overeducated indie rockers), or at least a posture-- and while it could be didactic or a lame grasp at irony, Amidon's rendition is stunning. ""What a relief to know that/ The war is over,"" he and Orton sing, their voices earnest and tough, rising over the album's thickest, most optimistic swells. When Amidon finds an affirmation of faith-- ""What a relief to know that/ There's an angel in the sky,"" he sings, grateful-- it's hard not to feel that liberation deep down in your gut.","This thoroughly modern folk singer continues his stunning recreations of classic folk, with help from Ben Frost, Nico Muhly, and Beth Orton.

The Outsiders Are Back,Kings Go Forth,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a94bb1335d7bf1699479/1:1/w_160/fd47aa93.jpg,2010-04-20 06:00:04,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14152-the-outsiders-are-back/,Luaka Bop,"The soul revival isn't reviving any careers-- it's creating them. Older musicians like Sharon Jones, Lee Fields, and Charles Walker were never exactly household names, not even among record collectors, but now they find themselves with more professional potential in front of them than behind them. Since there is little context for these artists, they aren't obliged to sleepwalk through old hits or old routines. Despite the reliance on old sounds, it's all new. It's an exciting moment for soul music, as albums by Jones, Fields, Walker's the Dynamites, and now Kings Go Forth indicate these older musicians are taking nothing for granted, which lends their music an urgency that transcends mere revivalism. The musician known as Black Wolf wasn't well known outside the world of cratediggers and soul enthusiasts when he struck up a conversation with Andy Noble, owner of Lotus Records in Milwaukee. During the 1970s, Black Wolf had been a member of the Essentials, a regional soul act whose claim to fame was recording in Curtis Mayfield's studio. He and Noble started a new band and named it Kings Go Forth, after a 1958 Frank Sinatra-Tony Curtis movie. Since then, the 10-member, intergenerational outfit has released a series of 7"" singles and gradually but determinedly built a reputation as a dynamic live act, settling easily into complex grooves that highlight Black Wolf's high-flying vocals. Along the way, the band has picked up some notable admirers: Famed disco DJ Tom Moulton, who really did invent the remix, mixed their ""Don't Take My Shadow"", and D.C. folk artist Mingering Mike, famous for painting covers for imaginary albums, created the artwork for the first Kings Go Forth full-length, The Outsiders Are Back. This record gathers singles dating back to 2007 yet proves cohesive and consistent. Rather than a collection of mismatched parts, Outsiders sounds like a unified work, even if it does showcase the range of their sound and chops. Kings Go Forth run through soul-revue rave-ups as well as midtempo vocal-group numbers, and they even dabble in reggae on the snaky ""1000 Songs"". Drummer Jeremy Kuzniar's casually complex beats propel the songs forcefully. From that sturdy foundation, Kings Go Forth build songs full of punchy horns and swelling strings, topping off everything with insistent vocals from Black Wolf, Dan Fernandez, and Matt Norberg. None of the singers has the presence and personality of, say, Sharon Jones, but they compensate by trading off lead and back-up frequently, recalling groups like the Temptations and the Pips one minute and solo soul stirrers like Otis Redding or Lou Rawls the next. Of course it sounds great: Adherence to period-appropriate production techniques is a bedrock tenet of the soul revival, so the album could be mistaken for a decades-old artifact. That's not an end in itself, but a means of bolstering the band's sound and ratcheting up the tension of their grooves. The horn breakdown on the sped-up ""I Don't Love You No More"" sounds like all of Michael Masser & Mandrill squaring off against Ali, and ""You're the One"" bursts out in Technicolor vocals that stretch from Philly all the way to Motown. Outsiders, however, never comes across like a pastiche of old styles and steps. Instead, the urgency of these songs reveals a band anchored strongly in the present but with their eyes toward the future.","Along with Sharon Jones, Lee Fields, and Charles Walker's Dynamites, here's another worthy entry in the 21st century soul revival.

Where Is the Truth,Mark Van Hoen,by: Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a94a9d034d5c69bf3c16/1:1/w_160/eafbe3ae.jpg,2010-04-20 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14150-where-is-the-truth/,City Centre Offices,"Mark Van Hoen didn't know he was adopted. Just listening to Where Is the Truth, the Brooklyn-based UK emigre's new album inspired by that discovery, neither would you. This founding member of UK electro-shoegaze pioneers Seefeel-- later known for his 1990s electronic output as Locust-- returns at a time when a similar strain of woozily psychedelic synth-pop has made the leap to indie prominence. Though not to be confused with chillwave or ""hypnagogic pop,"" Van Hoen's first new record in six years serves as a reminder that wistfully nostalgic electronic haziness is no Gen Y novelty-- and ups the sound-design ante for the contemporary style's typically lo-fi practitioners. Musically, Van Hoen belongs to a distinguished family tree. Originally influenced by the likes of Brian Eno and Tangerine Dream, and later presaging both Autechre's glitch and Boards of Canada's pastoral IDM, with his latest album Van Hoen would fit in just as well alongside White Rainbow or Atlas Sound on a current label like Kranky: He combines oceanic drone with pop lyricism, using technology as a catalyst. On ""A Glimmer of Forgotten Ancestors"", a mesmerizing 23-minute epic from 1997's The Last Flowers From the Darkness, he excerpts a wonderful quote where, in the full remarks, you can hear Gandhi go on to say, ""God is...truth."" Bearing that in mind, then, as well as Van Hoen's newfound knowledge of the truth about himself, it seems best to approach Where Is the Truth as an album of-- but not about-- inner spiritual search. It's an intricately constructed album, at that. Vintage synthesizers, tape, radio, drums, and Van Hoen's airy vocals join with elegaic electric guitar by Neil Halstead (Slowdive, Mojave 3) and somber piano by Julia Frodahl (New York septet Edison Woods) to tastefully evoke a journey of self-discovery. The emphasis on abstraction means that in casual settings, the more abstract tracks-- such as fragile organ-and-Orchestron opener ""Put My Trust in You""-- may tend to drag. And the ones with vocals-- even the fantastically falsetto-led ""She's Selda"", or murkily propulsive ""Render the Voice""-- don't quite communicate the way many pop fans would expect. Still, when you can spare your full attention, the album's meticulous production and nuanced conceptual unity make for a uniquely captivating listening experience-- a lot more cerebral than the stoner bliss-outs of the chillwavers, sure, but still related. Van Hoen may have found himself in more ways than he expected.","Former Seefeel man returns at a time when the woozily psychedelic synth-pop he helped pioneer is back in style.

Righteous Fists of Harmony,Daedelus,by: Larry Fitzmaurice,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a9265e6ef9596932137f/1:1/w_160/14014409.jpg,2010-04-20 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14127-righteous-fists-of-harmony/,Brainfeeder,"L.A.-based beatmaker Alfred Darlington has spent most of the past decade churning out poly-genre electronic music, sometimes seeming to favor quantity over quality. On the rare occasion when he gives an idea the time to develop, he too often suffocates it by packing too much in. Even his best work, 2003's outré-rap collaboration with Busdriver and Radioinactive, The Weather, was tainted by his weaker re-work, Rethinking the Weather. Still, despite Darlington's discography, it isn't unreasonable to at least expect a slight uptick in quality from Righteous Fists of Harmony, his new EP for Flying Lotus' Brainfeeder label, which is being put out as a prelude to a full-length for Ninja Tune later this year. There's no better time than now for Darlington to redefine his reputation as an artist, especially in a scene where his peers (FlyLo, Dâm-Funk, Gaslamp Killer) are establishing more fully realized styles and developing a higher profile. It turns out that a slight uptick in quality is exactly what Righteous Fists of Harmony delivers. It opens with a six-minute piece pitting minor-key drone against boilerplate glitch-hop, and it closes with a bit of soundtrack schmaltz; sandwiched between are takes on color-bled balladry, blunted electronica, and Brazilian-inflected lounge, with little apparent regard to sequencing. Even though it has just eight tracks and runs a little over 26 minutes, it's still a mess The aforementioned Brazilian influence is the only idea here that really feels fleshed out. Elsewhere, the EP leans more toward halfway interesting fragments: ""Tidal Waves Uprising"" begins with slowly picked acoustic guitar, delicately building urgency with measured snare hits and added guitar tracks, while EP centerpiece ""Order of the Golden Dawn"", features wife and frequent collaborator Laura Darlington doing her best Astrud Gilberto impression to a surprisingly strong effect. These okay moments, taken together, don't add up to much. Instead of giving listeners a distillation of his strengths, Darlington has produced what is essentially a so-so Savath y Savalas EP. After nearly a decade at it, he really doesn't need any more sources in his work; instead, his music needs some space to breathe and grow.","The prolific L.A.-based beatmaker releases a new EP for Flying Lotus' Brainfeeder imprint.

A Coming of Age,Lucky Soul,by: Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a92113d19756521397f7/1:1/w_160/8c384a03.jpg,2010-04-20 06:00:01,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14118-a-coming-of-age/,Ruffa Lane,"""There's always a friendly, easygoing atmosphere at the club, but this one feels extra special for some reason-- like a secret gathering of like-minded people, hidden away from reality."" That's the from the liner notes to The Kids at the Club, a 2006 compilation that features one of the earliest tracks from the London sextet led by songwriter/guitarist Andrew Laidlaw and singer Ali Howard. The image is pure Lucky Soul: a party where the nice kids are also the outcasts. It's also pure indie pop, but Lucky Soul were always out of step even among the Bowlie set. Their 2007 debut, The Great Unwanted, was not only meticulously crafted and emotionally overflowing, but also polished for a popular appeal it could never realistically attain. Not that it did poorly: Despite being self-released and receiving little attention from big U.S. print publications, the record boasts worldwide sales of 50,000 copies. Three years later, sophomore album A Coming of Age is that much further removed from prevailing trends, and it's not quite as immediately endearing, but it's a little more grown-up. And it's still pretty easy to like. The state of pop influenced by 1960s girl groups, Motown, and soul has changed a lot since the indie boomlet that gave us Lucky Soul, the Pipettes, and so many others. From Sharon Jones to Duffy, pre-Beatles throwbacks are on the rise. Younger acts like Vivian Girls, Dum Dum Girls, and Best Coast inherit from early girl-group singers the shambling ""feel"" as much as the emotional directness, adding their own reverb and lo-fi scuzz. As for the Pipettes, on the basis of at least one new song, they've skipped straight to the 70s-- and lost much of the human tenderness that made them special in the first place. A Coming of Age attempts a subtler maturation, with mixed results. Drawing again from Spector- and Bacharach-sized 60s pop-- plus glam (""Woah Billy!""), country (""Love 3""), and singer-songwriters like Carole King (""Warm Water"")-- the songs are packed with hooks, but they don't sink in as easily as before. For every ""White Russian Doll"", which bounds into the sort of romantic shadows where the Long Blondes used to smolder, or the title track, with its just-late-enough ""...come too late!"", there's a, well, ""Ain't Nothin' Like a Shame"". Still, Lucky Soul's latest proves once again that well-wrought, traditional melodic narratives packed with handclaps, strings, horns, whoa-oh-ohs, yeah-yeah-yeahs, and heartbreak can succeed without being painstakingly retro or modestly muffled. They only have to connect. The nice kids are no longer so nice, nor such kids, but they're still just as unfashionably welcoming. The closest comparison to A Coming of Age is the 60s-steeped adult-pop of Stuart Murdoch's God Help the Girl project, except instead of fitting into indie's niche mindset, Laidlaw's glistening production doubles down on Lucky Soul's (poignantly unlikely) radio-readiness. Howard's delicately forceful lilt, which brings to mind Dusty Springfield and Saint Etienne's Sarah Cracknell, has only grown stronger, more supple. The debut's teenage themes, meanwhile, give way here to sadness, loss of innocence, and mortality. On The Great Unwanted, Howard sang, ""I ain't never been cool."" Now, she concludes, ""It could be that I just don't belong-- anywhere but here.""","One of the most dynamic indie pop and pre-Beatles throwbacks around follows their excellent 2007 debut, The Great Unwanted.

As fair-minded listeners, we try to resist the temptation, but we're all human. Take We Have Band, a group with a name so generic it verges on parody. Sadly, one listen to the Londoners' debut album, WHB (yes, the name was so good they took the abbreviated form as their album title), reveals that this is no joke, or at least not an intentional one. In fact, We Have Band may well have crafted the most serious, fun-defying dance-punk record since the genre's mid-2000s rebirth. This is the sort of album that begins with a piano ballad called ""Piano"" and only gets progressively more stone-faced from there. Even tracks presumably intended to be carefree floor-fillers, like the bassline-flaunting lead single ""Divisive"", sound curiously and persistently uptight. ""Honeytrap"" is almost painfully strained, its incessant chant of ""It's time/ Rejoice/ Line up/ Clap hands/ Let's go"" more a joyless command than an invitation to hedonism. In taking such a dour approach, We Have Band manage to strip the album of any tension. The songs are so cautious and timid, so hemmed in by precedent, that it leaves little room for the unexpected; the mind-numbingly literal titles tell you what's coming. If there's a metaphorical meaning to ""Centerfolds and Empty Screens"", good luck deciphering it amidst the whining about unmet ""needs."" And while ""Buffet"" may not be their rewrite of ""Banquet"", they seem all too happy to settle for their own watered-down version of ""So Here We Are"". Of course, given dance-punk's flagging fortunes, We Have Band offer a few requisite half-hearted attempts to remain current. ""Love, What Are You Doing?"", in particular, seems to exist solely to earn comparisons to their more openly 80s-venerating Kitsuné peers like Delphic and Chew Lips. It's a fleeting, superficial nod at best. With ambiguity losing out to obviousness at every turn, it perhaps comes as no surprise to learn that all three members of We Have Band are ex-EMI employees. WHB often sounds like it came right off an A&R assembly line, the various songs cobbled together from aborted Bloc Party, Foals, and Rapture album sessions. The result is a bland dance-punk Frankenstein.","London dance-punk band with a bit of online buzz offers up their full-length debut.

Their caricatures of hip-hop boogeymen were never going to change anyone's mind about, say, DipSet, but the rush to caricature them as the backpacker fun police instead of talented rappers almost certainly resulted in people slagging off worthy projects like Foreign Exchange, the Chittlin' Circuit, and, oddly enough, their mixtape with DJ Drama. To their credit, Little Brother have gone to lengths to make things right themselves. The key lyric on LeftBack, Little Brother's presumably final studio album is, ""Not mad at the radio/ 'Cause I don't know what's on it."" There is a subtle yet important shift in tone here: On albums past, this message might've been meant as a boast. On LeftBack, Little Brother acknowledge that rather than being defined by their perceived opposition, they're but one of many options. Little Brother were always pretty entertaining when they weren't burdening themselves with hip-hop's salvation, but ultimately your enjoyment of LeftBack can boil down to whether you care about Phonte and Pooh debating if they can leave the game alone when it doesn't need them. Even on the triumphant career retrospective ""Curtain Call"", the two can't help but live with regret, blaming The Minstrel Show's commercial failure on listeners not appreciating ""the real on the reel."" More than ever, Little Brother appear to be a two sides to one group; duality informs nearly the entirety of LeftBack. There's almost an even split between ""for the love"" rap ciphers with peers like Truck North and Khrysis, and ""for your love"" relationship songs. Big Pooh comes off like the guy who's most intent on pursuing a new solo career, but he continues to be casually outshined by Phonte, whose nonchalance deflates even his corniest rhymes (""not being Cam'ron-ish, I mean diplomatic""). And while Phonte is trying to establish himself as viable outside of his collaborations, he constantly questions his commitment-- he appreciates what ""the kids"" are doing, but admits, ""one day I was playin' my old shit like 'who the fuck is this, I kinda miss this dude.'"" But even those of us who don't have an issue with their subject matter have been subjected to increasingly monochromatic listening experiences. Used to be you could blame that on 9th Wonder, but even with other producers, Phonte and Pooh seem incapable of rapping over something other than mostly interchangeable soul backdrops with papery drums that split the difference between handclaps and snares. Phonte raps, ""fuck if I'm goin' to be doin' this shit when I'm 60,"" but Little Brother were always well-suited to the mindset of rap as easy-listening. In the end, the finality of LeftBack sticks with you more than anything, because unlike many rappers promising the same thing, Little Brother seem like they really mean it-- not to mention that a three-way Twitter beef with 9th Wonder over a disputed beat really felt like the final coffin nail, appropriate for a group whose narrative took place almost entirely on the Internet. But if LeftBack really is the end for Little Brother, it's a fitting epitaph for a likeable act who just could never seem to get out of their own way.","This is supposedly the final chapter for Phonte and Pooh's often divisive group, self-proclaimed keepers of the true hip-hop flame.

La La Land,Plants and Animals,by: Rebecca Raber,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a9275e6ef95969321382/1:1/w_160/6c8226a8.jpg,2010-04-19 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14123-la-la-land/,Secret City,"La La Land, the second album from Montreal-based trio Plants and Animals, should be excellent. Their woefully overlooked 2008 debut full-length, Parc Avenue, was ripe to be expanded upon. Full of spacious, mostly acoustic almost-folk sounds, it spackled rich, otherworldly harmonies and honeyed, finger-picked guitar lines over rambling epics. On Parc Avenue, P&A drew a direct line between the bearded Laurel Canyon folk-rockers of the 1970s and the modern psychedelia of bands like Animal Collective. But La La Land, unfortunately, is more concerned with plugging in and cranking up the volume than it is with the subtleties that colored its predecessor. As its title suggest, La La Land sounds very much like the glitzy, tough L.A. It's not just song titles like ""Tom Cruz"", ""American Idol"", and ""Kon Tiki"" (named for a tacky L.A. hotel) that recall the entertainment capital, but also the album's fuzzed-out Sunset Strip guitar tones, kinetic, urban rhythms, and glossy production makeover. Yet while there is laudable roughness and robustness to these harder charging tracks, no amount of energy or amplification can obscure a song's bloat or lack of memorable hooks. Plants and Animals' strong suit was never the sing-along chorus or the earworm melody, but this new album's aggressiveness-- which plays in stark contrast to the casual, country-stoner pace of its precursor-- combined with the punch of its guitar sound, makes you long for tight pop hooks that never come. However, amid the album's overstuffed and more conventionally paced tracks, some beautifully strange gems can be unearthed. Unsurprisingly, the album's best moments most closely resemble the meandering songs of Parc Avenue. Songs like ""Game Show"" and ""Undone Melody"", which hinge on gritty acoustic foundations and climax with uplifting harmonies, represent the band's most logical progressions from Parc Avenue. The best use of their new plugged-in sound is ""American Idol"", which, with the rhythmic patter of its vocals and the percussive groove of its riffs, sounds more like Talking Heads than Plants and Animals. So while La La Land may not be the stellar follow-up that Parc Avenue deserved, it does offer something for fans willing to look beyond its tarted-up exterior.","Montreal band follows its underrated 2008 Laurel Canyon-like debut Parc Avenue with a more plugged-in, boisterous record.

City of Daughters / Thief / Streethawk: A Seduction,Destroyer,by: Paul Thompson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a93cc0084474cd0c0fcf/1:1/w_160/5c4cf268.gif,2010-04-19 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14141-city-of-daughters-thief-streethawk-a-seduction/,Merge,"""Find something difficult to do and do it,"" says Destroyer's Dan Bejar a few tracks into Streethawk: A Seduction. Which is more or less the story of Bejar's early albums, now reissued-- City of Daughters, Thief, and Streethawk. In a few years, the tentative bedroom auteur grew into one of indie rock's most distinctive voices, and these three records laid the groundwork for his career. The extravagant glam-pop that would become Bejar's trademark is hinted at, whittled down, and then perfected over the course of these albums. Every record since Streethawk has felt like either an extension of its successes or an outright rejection of its excesses. City of Daughters found Bejar playing with others for the first time, but it's still plenty homespun; its songs are rough around the edges and not always sure what to do with themselves. Most of these tracks are simple and occasionally quite direct, but with less drama and fewer of the flashes of brilliance Bejar's often built songs from and around. Still finding his voice as a singer, Bejar alternates between sounding meek and going in just a tad harder than the songs seem to deserve. The wordiness that would become something of a trademark is in full effect, but he was only just starting to get the sloganeering thing down; unlike much of what came later, not every line is worthy of examination. His work with the band, too, results in some fairly perfunctory arrangements; in hindsight, it's easy to see where a big crescendo might have gone had they had the means to pull one off at the time. The bouncy synth-pop breakdown in ""The Space Race"" is the first real evidence of his penchant for throwing a lot of unexpected elements into a song and making them stick. But the most successful tune here is one of its most bare; ""You Were So Cruel"" describes some manner of abuse, and while the specifics aren't crystal clear, Bejar's delivery is devastating. A good writer can explain themselves in any number of words; a great writer needs only a couple. With a few dozen words, the song drags you through about as many emotions. It's possibly his first masterpiece, though more would follow. Thief, originally issued in mono, benefits the most from remastering. It's Bejar's first stab at matching his grandiose, idiosyncratic vision to a showier sound, and it's never sounded better. It's also the first Destroyer LP to feature a full band on every track, and it displays a far better understanding of how its moving parts should fit together than the more fleshed-out numbers on Daughters. It's more patient, more deliberate, and much more confident; the singing improves vastly, and the songs cease feeling like vehicles for spitting out lyrics. All the hallmarks of Destroyer as we know them now are here: Rousing instrumental passages, lots of la-da-da's, effusive underlining of key phrases. But the sense of drama-- that teetering-on-the-brink feeling that marks his best stuff-- only occasionally rears its head; he still seemed to be getting comfortable having other people around, and there are times when the band seems to be playing him, rather than the other way around. As much as Destroyer is about excess, Thief sometimes bites off more than Bejar could chew at that point, and the duller bits obscure the moments of graceful abandon. But then there's Streethawk, a record of practically nothing but graceful abandon. Each line seems immaculately crafted, every note falling into perfect order, every word sung with the proper bite and bile. This is what Bejar was building to, why he became a songwriter in the first place, and he reaches quite a precipice. Songs move effortlessly between bits of received wisdom, the drama is amped up to almost unthinkable levels, and these tunes feel like a long series of exclamation points. The guy got really good really fast, and he knew it-- his wit is sharp, his observations are keen, and his gaze is withering. Bejar's pop songcraft gets a real shot in the arm here; instead of burying his best lines in verses, he builds his rave-ups around them, and the songs feel like a series of unlikely peaks that, in less able hands, would topple in seconds. You could study this music at academy; you can also pump a fist to it. It can at first feel overwhelming or overstuffed, but the salty poetry and barrage of hooks eventually starts to make its own kind of sense; beyond brimming over with ideas, if it's got a flaw, it's that it wasn't issued with a glossary. This is the payoff for years of head-down dedication to craft-- all these monstrous choruses and anthems-to-be; all those difficult years of working and reworking to make himself a better songwriter until, finally, he was one of the best we've got. He still is.","Remastered and reissued editions document Dan Bejar's early period, when he grew into the unique, beloved songwriter he is today.

Sucker,Harlan T. Bobo,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a9339d034d5c69bf3bef/1:1/w_160/11a69d12.jpg,2010-04-16 06:00:04,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14133-sucker/,Goner,"The liner notes to Harlan T. Bobo's third album, Sucker, explain that these new songs were ""mostly written while courting an adventurous woman"" and following her around the world. ""The courtship was a success."" It's a great story with a happy ending, but it raises a crucial question: How will happiness, marriage, and fatherhood affect this boho Memphian's songs, which have historically veered toward the gloriously unhappy and unsettled? In documenting the ups and mostly the downs of romance, the eccentric singer-songwriter, who contributed string arrangements to Cat Power's The Greatest and has been known to wear painter's stilts onstage, typically picks himself as its favorite target and has never adhered to any one particular style for more than a song or two. Will contentment extinguish the spark from his music? Not likely. It's a bumpy road to contentment, and Bobo chronicles it with insight and humor on Sucker, which may be short (just 29 minutes) but suggests a fully realized story that traces our sadsack narrator from the pits of despair to the heights of something like happiness. Opener ""Sweet Life"" refers not to what Bobo has, but what he aspires to: ""If I could be with you when you're down, if I could be more to you than a clown,"" he sings over trembling strings, ""you'd know life is sweet."" Indie pop rarely sounds so effortlessly stately. Things get worse before they get better, as Bobo drunk-dials a suicide note on the garage-raucous ""Crazy With Loneliness"" and bemoans his own advancing years on the folksily austere ""Old Man"" and the manic ""Hamster in a Cage"". Even at his lowest, Bobo is never really a downer, perhaps because he views loneliness as some sort of cosmic joke or perhaps because musically he's all over the place. Sucker rambles between the manic swagger of ""Oh Boy"" and the sophisticated folk-pop of ""Errand Girl"", between the jaunty rag of ""Perfect Day"" and the spry double-entendres of ""Mlle. Chatte"" (which is only ostensibly about a housecat). At first that sprawling range comes across as an extension of his own eccentricities, as if he's being willfully unpredictable, but to his credit, a song's subject never dictates its style. There is no noticeable musical change when his lyrics stop evoking pain and start depicting desire and devotion. ""Energy"" and ""Bad Boyfriends"" chug with no less abandon, and ""Drank"" proves to be Bobo's most eloquent arrangement, meandering melodically as he recounts diving off a boat and nearly drowning in the ocean with that ""challenging woman""-- you don't need that soaring coda to know it's a love song. Sucker is an album about settling in but not settling down or, god forbid, simply settling, and Bobo's music reveals all the wanderlust left in him.","The eccentric Memphis singer-songwriter and former Cat Power collaborator again crafts narratives tinged with insight and humor.

Steal Your Face,Mi Ami,by: Grayson Currin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a93a5e6ef95969321399/1:1/w_160/7d69d84f.jpg,2010-04-16 06:00:03,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14140-steal-your-face/,Thrill Jockey,"Steal Your Face, the second full-length album from San Francisco trio Mi Ami, is so intense it might overwhelm to the point of frustration. That's how I first reacted, struggling to find the same sort of entry points that its excellent 2009 predecessor, Watersports, offered. By contrast, Steal Your Face seemed too kinetic and overloaded to draw you in. It felt more focused on exploring the band's sounds than delivering a lasting impression. Keep at it though: Steal Your Face is the sort of frantic, busy album that hides its hooks among fits of guitar savagery, dub textures, and ricocheting rhythms-- but only for so long. Mi Ami rips from the gates on opener ""Harmonics (Genius of Love)"", for instance. Singer Daniel Martin-McCormick stammers semi-intelligibly above a throbbing tom-tom beat (a pretty incredible music joke, given the title) and a rusty guitar riff that splits the difference between post-punk, post-rock, and stoner metal. ""My body is so fucked, man, I just gotta move,"" he sings, while, appropriately, the band buries his words. It's as if Martin-McCormick is trying to find himself among the hot mess. That's how the best of Steal Your Face works, by cramming every second with as many sounds and ideas as the trio can manage. Constant motion keeps the songs exciting, while the sense that there's always another layer you've yet to grasp is what recharges attention. On ""Secrets"", above a squealing guitar and a gut-punch bass, Martin-McCormick speaks volumes on bad drugs, guilty lust, and vacuous relationships, letting it all go in a curdling, 15-second scream that has the same effect as a sudden burst of harsh noise. Lined with Whitney Houston, Twitter, and white-guilt jokes, ""Latin Lover"" suggests the Fall finally looking good on the dance floor. And while it's possibly as straightforward as Mi Ami's ever been, ""Native Americans (Born in the U.S.A.)"" isn't an easy read, either: They march through six verses, pausing after each to restate a cooing hook or for Martin-McCormick to grind his guitar through the beat. The closing guitar solo-- 90 seconds of squeal and broken tones panning from speaker to speaker, fading only to reform-- feels like watching a street brawl. Mi Ami's discursive and repetitive elements fortunately remain intact (just one tune clocks in at under five minutes), emphasized by the ""Dreamers"", the sole track here that couldn't be qualified as a rager. Martin-McCormick wraps his surprisingly muted whimper around trance-like rhythms and circular guitar. It's the third of the album's six tracks, meaning it's more of a chance for you to catch your breath than for the band to fade away. That's good, too, because Mi Ami seem only to be getting started: They've never been as good or as distinct as they are on Steal Your Face.","San Fran trio crafts almost overwhelmingly intense music; stick with its guitar savagery, dub textures, and ricocheting rhythms-- you'll be glad you did.

Initiate,The Nels Cline Singers,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a939c0084474cd0c0fcc/1:1/w_160/a7a1d7c2.jpg,2010-04-16 06:00:02,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14139-initiate/,Cryptogramophone,"If there's a type of Western music you can name, chances are Nels Cline has made it at some point in the last 30 years. He finally became prominent outside of niche circles when he joined Wilco last decade, and if there's any justice, he's finally reaping some long-elusive financial rewards for his music. Being in Wilco has slowed down his other musical output, but only insofar as he now doesn't release nine albums a year. You might expect a guy who's packed so much variety into his career to use each of his groups to focus on a different aspect of his craft; Cline has done that to some extent, but that's not how he uses the Nels Cline Singers. The long-running trio of Cline, bassist Devin Hoff, and drummer/et-ceterist Scott Amendola is sort of a brain-scraping catchall for Cline, and their records often seem like a concerted (and sometimes successful) effort to use lack of focus as an asset. So of course, for a band with that M.O., the only thing better than a full disc of electronic rock-ish jazz is two of them. Initiate is split into a studio disc and a live disc, but both share similar sound quality and a manic tendency to swing wildly from one thought to another. The studio disc is considerably more layered, making greater use of a considerable array of electronic whirligigs to augment the band. Even within songs, it's unpredictable. ""Red Line to Greenland"" sounds like jazz until Cline's guitar comes in with a buzzing post-rock riff and the electronics start gasping and wheezing. ""Divining"" is perhaps the best illustration of the band's restlessness, morphing from contemplative jazz into a bizarre exotica number, with Cline singing wordlessly and multiplying his voice with processing. It's a sharp contrast to the delicate, complex leads he plays on the quiet, even pretty ""Grow Closer"" just a few tracks later. Over on the live disc, the band seems to negotiate its set largely by feeling its way toward compositional signposts via listening to the other members. The flow is more discernibly jazz on most of the tracks, especially ""Fly Fly"", where Cline takes a series of alternately sinuous and thorny solos as Hoff and Amendola slip from straight rhythm to free time behind him. It's probably not a coincidence that Cline uses some very Sonic Youth-ish chord voicings on ""Thurston County""-- if Daydream Nation had been a jazz album, this is what it would have sounded like. Overall, the live disc has some of the rawness that the heavily overdubbed studio recordings of the Singers often lack, but it also wanders more and as such spends more time in unsatisfying places. More than anything, Initiate shows a band whose sense of give and take and intuitive interplay is extremely well-developed. Cline is able to lead his compatriots just about anywhere his mind wants to wander, and they follow him with ease, whether he's merging Frippertronics with jazz, out-krautrocking Wilco, or bringing in David Witham to play a crazy, 1960s-tinged organ solo. Cline may never reach a larger audience working under his own name, but that doesn't seem to be his goal. He's reached a place where he can do his mutant thing to his heart's content, and the results are exuberant, messy, and worth a couple of hours of your time.","Wilco's Cline leads one of his may other projects through two discs-- one live, one studio-- of unpredictable electronic rock-ish jazz.

The Burrrprint (2),Gucci Mane,by: Tom Breihan,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a9409d034d5c69bf3c04/1:1/w_160/c87e83cf.jpg,2010-04-16 06:00:01,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14144-the-burrrprint-2/,Warner Bros.Asylum,"""My jewelry game is at an all-time high right now,"" says Gucci Mane, over the phone from prison, on the intro to The Burrrprint (2). I'm sorry, but that's frankly hard to believe: The only jewelry he's wearing on the mixtape cover is a pair of handcuffs. Still, if that cover is to be believed, he has no trouble getting access to lobster, cell phones, and pink bottles of champagne while in prison. At no point do we learn how he opens bottles of pink champagne while he's got handcuffs on. It can't be easy. The Burrrprint (2) is the latest example of a long tradition: A rap album that comes out while the guy who made it is in jail. (And in this case, it really is an album rather than a mixtape, at least in the sense that his label is trying to rack up at least a couple of bucks by selling the damn thing in actual stores.) And while the bulk of the mixtape consists of tracks that Gucci recorded before starting his year-long parole-violation prison sentence, we still hear a whole lot of phoned-in missives from the imprisoned Gucci. He even recorded one song, ""Intro (Live From Fulton County Jail)"", from an actual prison phone. It's still very much a Gucci Mane song, not concerned with anything much deeper than his yellow Lamborghini with the butter rims. Even locked up, Gucci refuses to turn introspective. No matter what, he's determined to give us more cheap synthetic beats, more loopy word choices, more big choruses, more dizzy celebrations of materialistic pleasures. In other words, he's doing exactly the same shit he did before he went to prison. He's not even working out! ""No push-ups, but I'm still looking good as a motherfucker,"" he tells us. As a straight-up Gucci mixtape, The Burrrprint (2) comes nowhere near the panache of its predecessor. The original Burrrprint, itself a sequel of Gucci's The Movie mixtape, was pretty much straight murder from end to end. On this one, though, filler abounds. Gucci's memorable punchlines come less often, and his choruses don't stick quite so easily. Gucci's cadences are less inventive, wheezier, more tired. Gucci's guest rappers are bigger stars than usual-- Ludacris, Rick Ross, Trey Songz-- but they add less than longtime collaborators like energetic mushmouth Wacka Flocka, who gets a couple of good moments. Considering the insane volume of material Gucci recorded before going to prison, it's pretty amazing that he wasn't on autopilot earlier, but it's still disappointing to hear him at something less than full speed. But even when not at his best, Gucci continues to fascinate, partly because his voice has rap's best flattened-out party-dude bounce, and partly because you never know what kind of absurd word combinations he'll come up with next. (Some of my favorites from this one: ""Your girlfriend says my earrings are erotic,"" ""to a hood chick, Gucci's voice is euphoric,"" ""I got so much jewelry on that I think I need a clone."") ""Shining for No Apparent Reason"" has maybe the best Gucci song title ever. And some complete tracks are worthy entries in the Gucci canon, like the rumbling Ludacris collab ""Atlanta Zoo"" or the spare synth-whistle showcase ""Boy From the Block"". Best of all is the nine-minute posse cut ""Coca Coca"", on which Gucci rounds up six of his frequent collaborators (OJ Da Juiceman, Yo Gotti, Nicki Minaj, etc.) and takes every last one of them to school. But the real takeaway from The Burrrprint (2) is that Gucci is going to continue to make these ecstatically ignorant bangers just as soon as he's able. ""Worst Enemy"", the closing track from Gucci's The State Vs. Radric Davis album, hinted at a more thoughtful and introspective Gucci, and that Gucci never returns here. Instead, any moments of reflection come almost by accident, as when he interrupts the brag-fest ""Do This Shit Again"": ""I got acquitted for murder, it was purely self-defense/ I hope they don't try to do that to me no more, don't wanna do that again/ Walking out my jail cell, don't wanna go through that shit again/ Thirty K at King of Diamonds, watch me throw that in the wind."" And still the image of bills floating through the air is what lingers. When Gucci gets back out of prison and returns to crafting images like that, it'll be a good day.","Gucci's record released while incarcerated; despite the name-- the sequel to his best 2009 tape-- it's being treated as much as an LP as a mixtape.

Rough Travel for a Rare Thing,Bill Callahan,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a932ea9e61561daa59c4/1:1/w_160/545097ef.jpg,2010-04-16 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14135-rough-travel-for-a-rare-thing/,Drag City,"Bill Callahan's first live album reflects his approach to music. It's a 2xLP set (also available as a download, no CD), and the packaging is minimal-- two slabs of vinyl, no notes, and all credits and recording info are printed on the disc labels. The functional nature of the package says, ""The music is what's important here."" Callahan kicks off the album by mumbling, ""We're gonna get right down to business,"" and then he and the band-- guitar, bass, drums, violins-- proceed to do just that. It's 2007, they are in a small club in Australia, and Callahan is drawing from a catalog of songs any songwriter would envy. Turned out to be a good night. Though Woke on a Whalehart, Callahan's first album under his own name after leaving the name Smog behind, was just about to come out when Rough Travel for a Rare Thing was cut, the setlist focuses heavily on his previous full-length, 2005's A River Ain't Too Much to Love. Five of the 11 songs come from that release, with stops at Supper, the ""Rock Bottom Riser"" single, and Knock Knock along the way. There's one reach back to 1995's Wild Love (""Batheysphere""), and one tune from Whaleheart (""Diamond Dancer""). Heard together, with this band providing lean and effective accompaniment, the songs sound like they belong on a single album. Rough Travel flows. Callahan's voice, having grown richer and deeper over the years, is front and center, putting the focus squarely on the words and the way he phrases them. There's plenty going on there to keep things interesting. Indeed, Callahan's singing is a model of how much can be done with a limited vocal range. Sometimes he's half-talking and telling stories. Sometimes he's bending lines to put emphasis on certain words. Sometimes he's doing something close to a croon. In every case, his vocals are bound to the lyrics and reflect how he writes. The songs here are on the long side-- six minutes or so on average-- but it's not because Callahan wastes words. He knows when to leave space, and he has a way of making hard, clear images stay in your mind. When he sings a word like ""gold"" or ""river,"" you see the color and you can feel the water. Three words placed next to each other, like ""rock,"" ""bottom,"" and ""riser,"" the way he sings them, can tell a tiny story on their own, complete with a discernible arc. Performance and arrangements aside, Rough Travel, though not a ""greatest hits"" kind of set, affirms the authority of Callahan's songwriting. No wonder writers tend to love him. Though Callahan's focus can come across as remote and stoic, he can also be playful. Take ""The Well"", for example. Much of the song focuses on the narrator's obsession with a single drop of water clinging to the edge of an old bucket perched at the top of an abandoned well. It's not much to hang a nine-minute song on, but Callahan imbues the image with drama and gets in some funny lines along the way. ""Everybody has their own thing that they yell into a well,"" he sings, one of those lines of his that makes you think, ""Yeah, that feels right."" And he puts some echo on his voice as he runs down his: a hoot, a ""Hello?"", and a ""Fuck all y'all."" The instrumentation here is mostly acoustic, and the structure of the songs, including the traditional ""In the Pines"", which Callahan has covered on record and turned into something that feels like his own, lend a stately feel. But the songs are not easily bound to genre. Unlike his label-mate Will Oldham, whose loose rootsiness can lead to music that seems like it's drifting in from the past, Callahan's work seems of its time and makes you aware of the artist behind it. And Rough Travel, though ultimately only for established fans, turns out to be a very good snapshot of where that artist's music stood at the end of the last decade.","Bill Callahan's first live album, recorded in 2007, is a 2xLP/download set that captures one of this era's best singer-songwriters in amazing form.

Goodbye Falkenburg,Race Horses,by: Stuart Berman,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a92a13d1975652139805/1:1/w_160/0d3a8e8a.jpg,2010-04-15 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14128-goodbye-falkenburg/,Fantastic Plastic,"Emergent rock bands are bound to be measured against their influences, their environment, or, in the case of Race Horses, a combination of both. The quartet is based in Cardiff, Wales, and their bilingual music puts a whimsical spin on UK traditions ranging from music hall and psychedelia to glam rock and post-punk. So any discussion of Race Horses will inevitably lead back to equally warped Welsh forbears like Gorky's Zygotic Mynci and Super Furry Animals. But with Gorky's having disbanded in 2006, and the Super Furries continuing to mutate far beyond their psych-pop origins, it's more constructive to view Race Horses not as imitators but as rightful heirs to the Welsh Class-of-1996 legacy. Their wonderful debut album, Goodbye Falkenburg, certainly proves they're up to the task. What's most striking about the record is that Race Horses never let their grandiose ambitions get in the way of energy and urgency. The album's sonic accoutrements-- reversed guitar solos, toreador trumpets, radio static, phaser effects-- propel the songs along rather than weigh them down. Race Horses could not be a more aptly named group: Goodbye Falkenburg charges out of the gate with three of its most engaging tracks, instantly establishing the band's sly, cheeky sense of humor: the suggestive boy-meets-girl courtship of ""Cake"" climaxes with a simple, innocent request for the titular dessert, and when frontman Meilyr Jones says he wants to be a ""pony"" on the Roxy Music-styled track of the same name, he's not owning up to some escapist fantasy so much as calling himself an ass (""I want to be the one to sit beside you/ I want to be the one you lie to""). By stacking the most obvious singles up front, Race Horses ease you into Goodbye Falkenburg's more bizarro turns. Even though it barely breaches the three-minute mark, ""Cacen Mamgu"" presents a bewilderingly frantic procession of glitter-rock riffs, stop-start change-ups, backward-loop effects and Welsh football chants. But perhaps not wanting to add another layer of inscrutability to Falkenburg's more cluttered compositions, Jones generally saves his Welsh-language performances for the album's most straight-faced and affecting moments-- in particular ""Glo Ac Oren"", a gorgeous, Gorky's-esque piano ballad that showcases Race Horses' songwriting fortitude in the absence of their usual studio trickery or campy delivery. When they first emerged in the mid 90s, Gorky's and the Super Furries were unfairly lumped in and/or judged against the dominant Britpop of the day-- and often written off as wackaloon eccentrics as a result. But Race Horses have emerged in more favorable circumstances, with spiritual kin like Wild Beasts and Los Campesinos! already bending ears on both sides of the Atlantic toward flamboyant and erudite UK art-pop. With any luck, Race Horses will score the victory lap for this absurdity-is-the-new-sincerity movement.","Welsh band with a flair for music hall, psychedelia, glam rock, and post-punk craft a debut that is both ambitious and immediate.

Las Vênus Resort Palace Hotel,Cibelle,by: Joshua Love,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a92cb1335d7bf169944f/1:1/w_160/f7a1e887.jpg,2010-04-15 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14130-las-venus-resort-palace-hotel/,Crammed Discs,"Brazilian singer Cibelle's most recent full-length, 2006's The Shine of Dried Electric Leaves, was steeped in cool signifiers. Blending the insinuating samba of her homeland with folktronic sensibilities, Cibelle collaborated with Seu Jorge and Devendra Banhart, and covered songs by Tom Waits and Caetano Veloso. Now, Cibelle is through being cool. Her latest effort, Las Vênus Resort Palace Hotel, pays tribute to the untrendy sounds of exotica, the orchestrally ornate lounge genre that brought 1950s suburbanites a bastardized version of world music rhythms and instrumentation. Cibelle is an engaging, self-aware performer, and her rationale for honoring exotica is ""to embrace my exoticness and push it to the next level, and incorporate all that is considered ugly and cheesy and vulgar."" Her aim is provocative; it's brave to search for truth and beauty in the stylized, often tacky approximations outsiders have made of your culture. It also forces the listener to consider how his or her conception of ""cool"" shapes the listening experience. (As if that wasn't enough context, Las Vênus is also a concept album about a band performing at the last nightclub on Earth, complete with a metaphorically canny love story involving an ""outsider"" from space falling for Cibelle's ""exotic"" alter ego, Sonja Khalecallon.) Now, if only the music matched the cultural critique. Cibelle may claim that any listener's dissatisfaction only proves her point about the slavish devotion to cool, but I don't think that's the culprit. The problem is that Cibelle is not a particularly strong melodist; her stellar skills as a colorist masked this deficiency on the subtle Electric Leaves, but the broad strokes of Las Vênus leave her with nowhere to hide. ""Braid My Hair"" and ""Mr. and Mrs. Grey"" are more madcap than memorable, while the garage rave-up ""Escute Bem"" comes off as second-rate Tarantino soundtrack fodder (as does the mariachi murder ballad ""The Gun and the Knife""). Of the Cibelle-penned songs, only the gorgeous, light-as-a-feather ""Frankenstein"" is wholly successful, though ""Sapato Azul"" boasts a terrifically slinky bassline. The covers fare better: Raymond Scott's ""Lightworks"", a lovely reading of the Muppets standard ""It's Not Easy Being Green"", and a take on the kitschy Dr. No soundtrack relic, ""Underneath the Mango Tree"". In this latter instance, Cibelle takes cloyingly ""ethnic"" source material and turns it into something seductive and even beautiful. It's the apotheosis of her project-- there just aren't enough moments like it.","Brazilian singer pays tribute to the untrendy sounds of exotica, searching for beauty in the stylized approximations outsiders have made of her culture.

After his lukewarm major-label bid Murs for President in 2008, it makes a lot of sense to see the diehard Californian calling on an old friend to help get him back into a headspace that produced some of the rapper's strongest records to date. 9th Wonder-- a producer's gold standard for understated, laid-back cool-- is back for a fourth time helming the entirety of a Murs project. Unlike the pair's previous efforts, ForNever feels less like a proper album than a collaborative airing of ideas, as both producer and MC breeze through beats and song concepts with a laid-back, Cali-minded approach. Unsurprisingly, ForNever is very much a California affair, with nearly every guest artist hailing from the Golden State (including album bookending features from Kurupt, far less dynamic here than he appeared on last year's collaboration with DJ Quik). From smoking kush on your momma's porch, hitting the 7-Eleven for chips and a Sprite, trying to convince your girl to wait until halftime to argue and getting in over your head with a porn star, each one of these little vignettes has a certain day-in-the-life appeal that work just fine as individual concepts. String them together and you might as well be listening to a treatment for the next Friday installment. Succeeding at their most humorous (including ""Let Me Talk"", which features some hilarious insight from the pimp-wise Suga Free), most of the songs are toss-offs, but it's plenty of fun to be along for the ride as long as some restraint is issued. Without it, ForNever alternately struggles to keep its head above water with washed-out cautionary tales (""The Problem Is..."") or slums it in the shallows with mildly tawdry goofs (""Asian Girl""). If Murs weren't keeping so busy (with everything from comic books to a collaboration with members of Bad Brains in the pipeline), ForNever could feel slight. But even ignoring those greater ambitions, it's just good to find him in encouraging company that, above all else, at least has the rapper feeling comfortable again-- a crucial look for a guy like Murs. And even if these ideas haven't been given much time to fully form, it's hard to feel totally cheated: ForNever is simple fun, and fun while it lasts. As Murs asks on the opening title track, ""We do it for love, what the fuck you makin' music for?"" It's further proof that a lot of good can come from simply making sure your heart is in the right place.","After a lukewarmly received major-label record, Murs retreats into a more familiar headspace with frequent collaborator 9th Wonder.

City of Straw,Sightings,by: Marc Masters,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a93413d197565213981a/1:1/w_160/24c86f6f.jpg,2010-04-15 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14134-city-of-straw/,Brah,"The decade-long career of New York trio Sightings has been mostly about expansion. They started with a big bang, playing as noisy and abrasive as a band with structured rock songs could. Gradually, they stretched that approach, incorporating some space and restraint. The melodic skeletons beneath the music's cacophonous skin slowly poked through. By the time of their fourth studio album, Arrived in Gold, Sightings had mastered minimalism, sometimes exploring small, detailed sounds that were like the negative image of their white-hot noise. City of Straw opens with that kind of dark sparseness-- the first minute of ""Tar and Pine"" is all little clicks that sound more like Morse code than music. But when Mark Morgan's guitar slices through, and Jon Lockie's hybrid electro-acoustic drums lock in, the song becomes a tense, turgid combination of minimalist structure and maximalist sound. It's a mix the band perfected on their previous effort, 2007's Through the Panama, even producing a few catchy post-punk gems. City of Straw never quite hits that kind of head-bobbing snap, though it does offer a few songs you can pump your fists to. But the way it stirs the band's macro and micro sides together puts it squarely among their best efforts. That mix also produces the album's strongest moments, both within single songs and through the juxtapositions of track sequencing. The contrasts are most vivid in a mid-album three-song stretch. The title track reiterates the tiny clips of ""Tar and Pine"", fusing them into nine minutes of buzzing sonics. The band's stubborn patience demands the same of the listener, but reward comes in the puncturing slam of ""Saccharine Traps"". There, a rumbling beat and Morgan's frantic howl (a contrast to the chilly vocal style he uses on most of the record) sound like Wolf Eyes trying to cover Joy Division. The switch from sparse to spastic is reexamined in the next cut, ""We All Amplify"", which might be the first dreamy Sightings track-- even Morgan's notoriously brittle guitar seems to soften a bit. All the melting of echoey distance and full-on volume makes City of Straw a complex listen, but the album does contain a few bright, clear moments. On ""Weehawken"" and especially closer ""Sky Above Mud Below"", the band sculpts churning dissonance into rock shapes via Morgan's repetitive chants, Lockie's rolling rhythms, and the fluid bass of Richard Hoffman-- always the backbone of their sturdy attack. At this point those elements have become more like a language than a sound, a set of words and phrases that Sightings pour into song-molds like chemists concocting elixirs.","New York trio continues to explore minimalism and white-hot noise, a fierce blend of seemingly disparate elements.

The Wild Hunt,The Tallest Man on Earth,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a91813d19756521397ea/1:1/w_160/24f31780.jpg,2010-04-15 06:00:00,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14110-the-wild-hunt/,Dead Oceans,"Pesky comparisons to Bob Dylan have dogged Kristian Matsson throughout his short career as the Tallest Man on Earth. In 2006, his self-titled EP introduced a singer with that familiar croak, a songwriter with a folk-revival revival sensibility, and a guitar player with an impressively agile fingerpicking style. The next year, his full-length debut, Shallow Grave, expanded nicely on those ideas, buffing away some of the rougher edges but emphasizing fully realized and beautifully evocative songs. The Wild Hunt, the second Tallest Man on Earth album and first for Dead Oceans, makes a few specific nods to Dylan at his most earnest and bare-- including a reference to ""boots of Spanish leather"" on ""King of Spain"". Ultimately, though, Matsson interprets Dylan, just as Dylan himself interpreted Guthrie. More to the point, Matsson translates him into the Scandinavian countryside, where he sings about changing seasons and quiet, lonely places far from cities. His lyrics are rough and often ragged, more concerned with evoking aching emotions than with making explicit sense. But that coded aspect only makes him sound more urgent, as if he's trying to convince you of something he couldn't possibly put into words. As with previous albums, The Wild Hunt features mainly voice and guitar, and in this intimate, austere setting-- where the banjo on the title track sounds like an indulgence-- Matsson coaxes a wide range of colors from that limited palette, whether it's the testiness of ""You're Going Back"" or the exuberance of ""King of Spain"". His grounding in American Southern traditions is apparent: While not a blues musician per se, Matsson draws important lessons from the likes of Mississippi John Hurt and Bukka White by realizing that his guitar speaks as loudly and as clearly as he does. His playing is sophisticated but never showy, alternating between spry picking and forceful strumming. Whether due to his tunings or his crisp production, there's something bright and expectant about his songs, so that even at his most forlorn, as on ""Love Is All"" or ""The Drying of the Law [#script:http://pitchfork.com/media/backend/js/tiny_mce/themes/advanced/langs/en.js]|||||| ns"", Matsson's heraldic guitar playing generates a certain major-key hopefulness that softly shades the songs. When he switches to an old and battered piano on the teen anthem ""Kids on the Run"", the effect is not diminished but amplified, as the instrument reverberates uneasily. It's an unexpected moment that colors everything that came before it and paints Matsson as a distinctive and singular artist. As a singer, he has become much more confident and capable, using that wily, deceptively limited croak with greater nuance and subtlety. The hiccup hook on ""Love Is All"" sounds like a joyful noise despite the song's tentative tone, and the rawness of his vocals lends gravity to the accusations of ""You're Going Back"". On the other hand, Matsson sounds warmly generous on ""Troubles Will Be Gone"" when he sings, ""The day is never done, still there's a light on where you sleep, so I hope someday your troubles will be gone."" Matsson is both a romantic and a realist, and on The Wild Hunt, he uses the barest of pop-folk settings to give mundane moments-- another break-up, another tour, another change of season, another Dylan comparison-- a grandeur so disproportional that it's difficult not to identify and sympathize with him.","Swedish troubadour Kristian Matsson returns as a more confident vocalist and a more nuanced and effective songwriter.

Wooden Blankets EP,Blind Man's Colour,by: Paul Thompson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a9319d034d5c69bf3be9/1:1/w_160/9c0aa01d.jpg,2010-04-14 06:00:04,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14132-wooden-blankets-ep/,Kanine,"Blind Man's Colour are getting there. These two Florida youngsters are shedding influences and playing to strengths. They're also smartly packaging their ideas at an unusually brisk pace-- their Wooden Blankets EP arrives less than a year after their debut, Season Dreaming. They'd still do well to match their shimmering synth-pop textures with a more dazzling group of tunes, but their hues have intensified and their patterns grown more complex, which counts as significant progress for a fresh-faced ambient-pop band such as this. Of course, my colleague Joe Colly's assertion in his review of Season Dreaming that BMC ""owes everything to Animal Collective"" still has more than a ring of truth to it. The songs on Wooden Blankets are all enveloped in a damp murk, a sharp contrast from Season Dreaming's sunkissed feel; the effect is not unlike Strawberry Jam's fizzy ""#1"", and just as with the AC track, tunes here take a backseat to texture. But they've opted to trade Feels-era shiftiness for a mellower, sparkly Person Pitch pastiche, and the resulting textures are richer, more vivid, and far prettier. There's evidence of a few more trips to the record store, too; the synths have a blocky Brian Eno quality, the drift floats like spacey Phaedra-era Tangerine Dream, and the alternately swooping and soporific vocals smack of Frog Eyes' Carey Mercer and Deerhunter's Bradford Cox, respectively. The challenge BMC still don't seem quite up to is matching these impressive textures to songs you can carry with you once they're finished-- something most of their influences took years to manage. These melodies don't put up much of a fight through the dense haze on display here, and when they do-- as on mantra-like closer ""Sleeping Bag""-- they lose much of the sonic richness that seems at the moment like their best asset. That balance between tune and texture isn't an easy one to strike, and they still need to work on the former; these songs do feel more distinctly theirs, but they still don't quite have the gestures of songwriting down well enough to get away with being quite this gestural as songsmiths, and no amount of sonic wallpapering can cover over the holes in these tunes. But Wooden Blankets is a series of small successes, with evidence of progress and promise; they may still have a ways to go, but it's plain as day which way they're headed.","Animal Collective acolytes continue to grow and escape the shadow of their influences on their new EP.

"Contact, Love, Want, Have",Ikonika,by: Joe Colly,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a92d13d1975652139810/1:1/w_160/57b9e579.jpg,2010-04-14 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14131-contact-love-want-have/,Hyperdub,"Ikonika's debut full-length is a big deal in the dubstep community for a few reasons. First, and most importantly, it's seen as an exciting extension of the various styles that have been swirling around the genre for the past few years-- specifically wonky and funky. The record also arrives with some cachet: It's only the fifth long player to be released by Hyperdub, still the genre's standard-bearer and the source of some of its most essential music. Ikonika's (real name Sara Abdel-Hamid) record is also one of the first high-profile dubstep full-lengths produced by a woman, and though that's moot with regard to her actual music, it's at least encouraging for what has been a mostly male-dominated scene so far. Ikonika isn't the most musical or technical producer out there, but she does have a way with melody. In an interview with Pitchfork columnist Martin Clark, she told us, ""I don't really know how to play keys. So I just smack them until something nice comes out."" Okay, probably not the best defense of one's own work, but it is important to understanding how she differs from other dubstep producers. Instead of the meticulous, heady style that we've come to expect from the genre, Ikonika's approach is more spontaneous and direct, concerned more with impact than process. Her productions aren't as dynamic or complex as others' are, but they're arguably fun in a way that a lot of dubstep-- especially the traditional murky, low-end variety-- is not. In terms of sound, Ikonika isn't that different from producers Joker, Rustie, and Starkey. Like them, she uses dubstep as a base for a jumble of styles-- in this case the wobble of wonky, the insistent thud of funky, and chiptune videogame sounds. Her pitch-bent synths are usually the focus-- they sit upfront in the mix and are manipulated to match a song's mood. Sometimes the album can feel almost cloyingly upbeat (there's a lot of very ramped-up, tech-y sounds) but there's also a good deal of variety. ""R.E.S.O.L."" nearly makes you woozy with its heavy, wobbling bass and distorted 8-bit squiggle. Videogames are a running theme, and certain tracks like ""They Are Losing the War"" really play up this quality. Others, like ""Millie"" are more slow-moving and syrupy. Because of these distinct moods, the record works nicely as a full length-- it holds your attention, and the songs never bleed together. For those not expecting progressive dubstep, it's a catchy, immediate pleasure. But others who desire something heavy on craft, depth, and movement might find it insufficient. The record lacks some of those critical elements, but ultimately it's neither a great crossover dubstep-pop LP nor some kind of crude flop. It's a solid record. If nothing else, Ikonika's desire to inject some playfulness into a genre that could use a lot more of it is a good and welcome thing.","A rare full length from Hyperdub, Ikonika's debut is an exciting extension of post-dubstep styles like wonky, funky, and chiptunes.

Prior to the Fire,Priestess,by: Tom Breihan,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a92bea9e61561daa59b5/1:1/w_160/ebbc6102.jpg,2010-04-14 06:00:02,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14129-prior-to-the-fire/,Tee Pee,"Even in its death throes, the major-label machine sometimes gets things right. Consider, for example, the Montreal riff-rock crew Priestess. Hello Master, the band's 2006 debut, showed a flair for soaring hooks and memorable riffage rare in any of the many retro Camaro-rock bands out on the touring circuit. The band initially released the LP on a pair of indies, but RCA snapped them up. The band and RCA have since parted ways: As Priestess' Mikey Heppner put it to Chartattack, the label wanted them write new songs for sophomore effort Prior to the Fire until they heard a single. Instead, we have Prior to the Fire, exactly the way the band wanted to release it, except now it's on the much smaller Tee Pee label. And guess what? No singles. No halfway-to-great songs at all, actually. Now, this isn't a Yankee Hotel Foxtrot situation. Priestess isn't a band out there blazing paths. Instead, they play the sort of fast, crunching stoner-metal that Motörhead and first-album Black Sabbath pioneered and that a few thousand bands have attempted to perfect ever since. What made them special was their way with a hook. Hello Master sounded at first like an easy album to dismiss; it did absolutely nothing new. But tracks like the Guitar Hero III jam ""Lay Down"" stuck with you. The band might've been doing stuff that'd already been done to death, but they did it really well, with swagger and assurance and craft. Flash forward a few years, and Priestess are a seasoned touring act, and a couple of their members have grown seriously badass biker beards. But they've evidently lost their ear for sticky, soaring melodies. P**rior to the Fire is a perfectly acceptable retro-metal album, every part in place. But there's nothing exceptional about it-- and nothing here for anyone not already a fan of retro-metal. That said, if 70s guitar-thunder is your thing, there's plenty to like here. Drummer Vince Nudo keeps things moving admirably, throwing in all sorts of berserker fills where other guys would've been content to smack a cowbell a couple of times. Heppner has a great metal voice, a vaguely scraggly wail that comes off, at times, like a less-destroyed version of Lemmy's growl. The lyrics are fun: stuff about ""the forest of my soul,"" ""scum-filled city streets afraid,"" a priceless bit about how Heppner is ""like a skull with no eyes"" because, it emerges, you're gone. The album is beautifully mastered, so that the quiet acoustic bits actually sound quieter than the loud ones; especially for a metal album originally recorded for a major, that's a rare thing. So if Prior to the Fire does make its way onto your iPod, you probably won't hit skip when its songs come up on shuffle, especially if you're already invested in this kind of thing. But when you hold it up to something great in the same vein, like High on Fire's masterful new Snakes for the Divine, it suffers. That album is the sound of a band at the peak of its powers, dropping bombs for the fuck of it. But Prior to the Fire just sounds like a competent, professional band running through the motions. The album has no grand arc; it's just a collection of pretty okay jams for people who already own everything Pentagram ever recorded. It's fine, but it's nothing more than fine.","After parting ways with RCA, the stoner-metal band regroups and releases their second album the way they intended people to hear it in the first place.

Prins Thomas,Prins Thomas,by: Andrew Gaerig,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a928ea9e61561daa59ad/1:1/w_160/813037f5.jpg,2010-04-14 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14124-prins-thomas/,Full Pupp,"Prins Thomas has built a reputation as a cosmic disco stalwart through a series of ubiquitously fun remixes, running the Full Pupp label, and his status as Lindstrøm's best bro. In fact, he's been sort of hard to avoid for anyone with even a cursory interest in a Scandinavian electronic scene populated by artists like Rune Lindbæk, diskJokke, and Todd Terje. When Thomas' eponymous debut was announced abruptly in February, there was a sense of inevitability-- a coming-out party for one of nu-disco's premier names. Prins Thomas, however, is a bit of a curveball, one that moves away from most definitions of ""dance"" music toward a wilier sound inspired by 1970s German music and avant-garde composition. The first thing you notice about Prins Thomas is that it's slow, or at least reserved. Thomas has been mining krautrock legends like Cluster, Neu!, and solo works by Michael Rother and Manuel Göttsching. (No surprise-- one of Thomas' only proper tracks prior to this release was named ""Göttsching"".) His highest profile gig to-date has been working with fellow Norwegian Lindstrøm, with last year's collaboration, II, digging hard into fried instrumental jams. Prins Thomas came together quickly after mixing for II ended, and it's cut from the same cloth: slow grooves that leave room for guitars, keyboards, and sometimes vocals to voyage skyward. These expeditions can be thrilling and impressive, but Prins Thomas often fails to establish any discernible mood; the album is not effusive or downcast, never giddy or stoic. It feels, at times, academic, which is a product of its well-worn influences but also Thomas' sturdy, uneventful pacing. The longest track here, ""Sauerkraut"", references its influences in both its title and its composition, speeding up the bassline from Neu!'s seminal ""Negativland"". Prins Thomas sometimes feels like the work of a fan, a study. Of course Thomas is much more than just a fan, and he's smart enough to know that he needn't assign too much importance to an album, even his first: In an interview with Beatportal (conducted by Pitchfork contributor Philip Sherburne) he refers to Prins Thomas as a ""snapshot."" He openly frets about his musical ability while name-checking the legends. It's safe to say that an artist who spent 10 years collaborating in a close-knit scene before dropping his debut has healthily non-traditional attitudes about a career in music. In turn, it's best to think of Prins Thomas not as a speedbump but as another iteration, slightly undercooked, of his still-developing style.","Space disco mainstay and frequent Lindstrøm partner records a solo record inspired by 1970s German music and avant-garde composition.

Raw Power [Legacy Edition] / Raw Power [Deluxe Edition],Iggy and the Stooges,by: Stuart Berman,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a92ec0084474cd0c0fb6/1:1/w_160/bf58a45a.jpg,2010-04-14 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14125-raw-power-legacy-edition-raw-power-deluxe-edition/,Legacy,"When Iggy Pop commanded a generation of glam-rock kids and biker-bar burnouts to ""dance to the beat of the living dead"" on Raw Power's totemic title track, he wasn't just talking B-movie nonsense-- he was heralding his band's back-from-the-grave resurrection. Because the Stooges heard on Raw Power were not the same band that produced 1969's self-titled debut or 1970's Funhouse, but rather some mutant, zombie version. With the Stooges dropped from Elektra, Iggy exploited a solo-artist deal with David Bowie's management to reassemble his band around new guitarist James Williamson, pushing Ron Asheton to bass and re-branding the Stooges as ""Iggy & the Stooges"". And in accordance with those changes, Bowie's infamously treble-heavy Raw Power mix thrust Iggy's vocals and Williamson's searing solos miles out in front of the rhythm section, to the point of practically writing Ron and drummer/brother Scott Asheton out of the set. All of which has made Raw Power the most contentious release in the Stooges catalog, a fact that Iggy himself effectively owned up to in 1997 when he issued an exponentially louder and beefier new mix that took the album's title to literal extremes (and, in the process, horrified audiophiles with a distaste for digital distortion). It speaks volumes about the songs' pure immediacy and charisma that, even in its original mix, Raw Power became the album most responsible for giving the Stooges a life after death. Where the primordial caveman blues of The Stooges and the proto-metallic grind of Funhouse made them touchstones for future grunge, stoner-rock, and noise artists, Raw Power provided a mainline for first-generation punks and the 80s hard-rockers that followed in their wake. (Case in point: When J Mascis and Mike Watt hooked up with Ron Asheton for some 2001 dates, they only performed songs from the first two Stooges albums; when Guns N' Roses and the Red Hot Chili Peppers covered the Stooges, they did songs from Raw Power.) There's no denying that the Raw Power era was the band's most prolific: the album's eight songs account for just a fraction of the music Iggy & the Stooges produced between their 1972 reformation and their unceremonious 1974 dissolution. Over the past three decades, the number of bootlegs that have attempted to collect all the unreleased material from this period-- from the Rough Power comp of de-Bowie-fied mixes to the notorious last-gig document Metallic K.O.-- have amounted to a mini-cottage industry that's been as vital to sustaining the band's legend as their four official releases. So, for an album that runs a mere 33 minutes, Raw Power should provide ample fodder for deluxe-reissue treatment and an opportunity to streamline all that bootlegged ephemera into an official storehouse of all the songs the Stooges produced between 1972-74. However, this reissue-- available in a 2xCD, budget-priced Legacy Edtion set and as a more elaborate $60 4xCD Deluxe Edition-- doesn't attempt anything quite so ambitious. Instead, the main impetus is bringing a remastered version of the original Bowie mix back to market. This is understandable from an historical-preservation perspective, but then why not also include the '97 mix and allow fans to compare and contrast? The new remaster certainly enhances the ambient details in the mix-- like the tense acoustic underpinning of ""Gimme Danger"", or the echoing beat in ""I Need Somebody"" that illustrates Bowie's intention of making Scott Asheton's drums sound like a lumberjack chopping wood. But, personally, after spending the past 13 years having my ears ravaged by the '97 Iggy mix, I find it difficult readjusting to the leaner, original version-- even with the remastering, the '97 version far outstrips it in fidelity and sheer brute force, and remains a better entry point for younger listeners seeking to understand the album's impact. Still, even if you've already bought this album twice, the Legacy Edition's second disc offers a compelling reason to shell out again: an immensely entertaining, well-preserved 1973 Atlanta club set that was intended for a radio broadcast but later aborted. Recorded months after Raw Power had been released, ignored, and consigned to cut-out bins, the set sees the Stooges in another transitory state, further asserting *Raw Power'*s 50s-rock roots with the addition of jaunty pianist Scott Thurston, but also patiently stretching out new songs like ""Head On"" and ""Heavy Liquid"" into loose, exploratory, Who-style workouts. It also unintentionally redresses Raw Power's initial imbalance by smothering Williamson's leads in the Ashetons' thick low-end. Naturally, the combination of Iggy and a crowd of southerners results in some colorful exchanges (""You wanna get your little fucking face punched out, little cracker boy?""), and it's fun to revisit a moment when the Stooges' audience was sparse enough to make out individual conversations (says one spectator: ""I don't think he likes us!""). But more than a document of Iggy in his audience-baiting element, the set serves as a great tribute to the late Ron Asheton, whose bass-playing is finally revealed to be every bit as fierce and inventive as his guitar-playing. The live disc is appended with two Raw Power outtakes-- a more compact, studio version of ""Head On"" and the silly rumble-in-the-jungle jam ""Doojiman""-- but anyone hoping for more vault-clearing revelations on the expanded 4xCD Deluxe Edition (available exclusively through www.iggyandthestoogesmusic.com) will be disappointed. The ""Rarities, Outtakes and Alternates"" disc seems especially ill-conceived, padding out its few genuine finds (an amusing, embryonic version of ""Penetration"" dubbed ""I'm Hungry"", and the Velvets-via-Hendrix goof ""Hey Peter"") with a random assemblage of alternate mixes (including a pair of 1997 representatives) and an incomplete sampling of the era's well-known outtakes (""I Got a Right"" and ""I'm Sick of You"" are accounted for, so where the hell's ""Gimme Some Skin""?). Easy Action's 2005 bootleg box-set, Heavy Liquid, did a far more thorough job of compiling the Raw Power-era castaways, so Stooges completists investing in this Deluxe Edition will need to be satiated by the non-musical extras: a replica Japanese ""Search and Destroy"" b/w ""Raw Power"" seven-inch, 48-page book (filled with celebrity testimonials and Mick Rock's iconic period photography), five 5x7"" photographic prints, and, most valuably, a DVD documentary about the album's creation by Morgan Neville. Comprising recent interviews with the surviving Stooges and famous fans like Johnny Marr, Chrissie Hynde, and Henry Rollins, the doc covers all the main album talking points and offers a memorable moment of candor when Iggy admits to feeling vindicated that the Stooges still have such vitality and relevance today. There was certainly no lack of irony and cheek when Iggy first sung ""we're going down in history"" on Raw Power's kamikaze closer ""Death Trip"", but watching the closing shots of Iggy & the Stooges performing for a Brazilian festival crowd last year, with Mike Watt inheriting Ron Asheton's mantle, those words now sound more assuredly prophetic than ever.","One of the greatest rock albums ever is reissued again, this time in two versions; both useful but less than ideal or definitive.

Berliners Stefan Schneider and Ronald and Robert Lippok often sound as balanced and precise as their reversible band name. But they know how to finesse electronic timbres and human melodies, neither over-intellectualizing nor over-sentimentalizing their songs. What makes Speculation so welcome is that it represents a tweak to their established M.O. nearly 15 years into their career. Recording sessions for Speculation, some of which were held in the rural studio of Krautrock legends Faust, succeeded in capturing a more live sound and looser atmosphere. Previous tracks have always been well composed. New ones like ""Working Against Time"" add bright cosmic rhythms and a sense of immediacy to the mix, as if you can feel the air move in the room between the synths and guitars. That song in particular has a swagger to it; synths pulse against a persistent beat, as if in reference to the title. Credit Stefan Schneider's bass playing with plenty of propulsion and muscle, especially the dark, skuzzy tone on ""Away"" or the bouncy middle section of ""Seele"". Hotel Morgen, the trio's previous record, wasn't nearly as energetic; momentum was sometimes slow to establish itself (and quick to fade) and the short closer, ""Opak"", was an awkward send-off. Speculation sounds much tighter, confidently moving between tracks and themes. The digital tones the band has been playing with for years sound richer yet also lighter, supporting soaring cyclical melodies. The growing sense of looseness culminates in the epic, nearly 11-minute jam ""Friday"", which includes the mad organ playing of Faust's Jochen Irmler fiddling away on a homemade instrument. It's relatively unhinged for the group, yet they keep pace, enriching this particular freakout with bubbling cauldrons of noise, brusque tones and beats. It never quite boils over, as if the group's cool, calm hand still has sway. The music of To Rococo Rot has always had an organic element; Speculation furthers that with a real sense of play and exploration.","Berlin post-rockers play nice with a member of Krautrock legends Faust and discover a looser sound.

Though Heart That’s Pounding is the first collection she's released under her own name (she was born Sally Russell, but took the surname of the Avalanches' Darren Seltmann when they married), she created two albums, 2005's Last Beautiful Day and 2007's Somewhere, Anywhere, as New Buffalo for Arts & Crafts. She also co-wrote a little song called ""1234"" that she gave to her friend and labelmate Feist. Through ""1234"" and her own work, Seltmann has helped architect a specific strain of MOR indie-- slightly quirky songs with perky chamber arrangements or glitchy electronic shading to add depth to its acoustic backbone. By finally dropping New Buffalo in favor of her own name, she is possibly leading with her songwriting credits more than her previous records Seltmann isn't a powerful singer, but her breathy, dainty voice is well-matched to slight, shivery melodies bulked up with silvery synths or swooning piano. Album opener ""Harmony to My Heartbeat"" fills the space between her spare, calliope-like melodies with peppy handclaps and a foundation of programmed-raindrop percussion. It's sparse twitchiness recalls bedroom electro-pop, but with sunnier, more expansive aims. But it's hard to walk the tightrope between hushed, poignant, electro-inflected pop ballads and mawkish lite-FM fodder, and Seltmann's songs can have trouble maintaining that balancing act. ""The Truth"" errs on the side of over-sentimentality with its gooey Karen Carpenter vocals. And on ""Over the Borderline"" Seltmann tries her hand at the kind of uplifting, this-is-a-new-day anthem that the Polyphonic Spree usually traffic in, and her bald-faced optimism is difficult to take with a straight face.

And, in fact, that is the lasting result of ""1234""'s success.

Gute Luft,Thomas Fehlmann,by: Larry Fitzmaurice,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a8f7ea9e61561daa5947/1:1/w_160/1ff84d6a.jpg,2010-04-13 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14081-gute-luft/,Kompakt,"Thomas Fehlmann's Gute Luft is both a new album and also a companion to the 24-hour-long television documentary series 24h Berlin, which follows a handful of Berliners' lives over a one-day period. Fehlmann composed music for the project separately from fellow musical contributor Maurus Ronner, and much of Fehlmann's work didn't make the documentary. So the re-edited and refined material presented here is more of an imagined soundtrack than a definitive one, even though a few of its tracks make regular appearances throughout the series. Due to its cut-and-paste nature, Gute Luft lacks the sonic uniformity of previous Fehlmann releases, especially 2007's luxurious career-high Honigpumpe; this absence of a defining musical idea, where sounds and moods range from Detroit techno's insistent thump to post-rock drone to ambient drift to spacey dub, when coupled with the record's 70-minute runtime, is at first overwhelming. But the big-tent approach also connects the music to the film that inspired it, Berlin being a cosmopolition and culturally diverse city. Gute Luft works as a survey of everything Fehlmann does well. He's stated that while putting the album together, he ""brought in elements from tunes from my previous albums,"" and anyone with a working knowledge of his solo work (not to mention his contributions to the Orb) will recognize where he's drawing from. The spiraling build of opener ""Alles, Immer"" and the more amorphous ""Von Oben"" recall Honigpumpe's epic-stuffed back half, while the hiccupped tones and static wash of ""Berliner Luftikus"" resembles that record's swampy front end. Elsewhere, the glitchy, funk-strewn tech-house of 2004's Lowflow is distantly echoed in the jittery ""Cityscape"", while the shimmering piano that closes out ""Permanent Touch"" directly lifts the same figure that opens one of Fehlmann's more notable achievements with the Orb, 2005's Okie Dokie It's the Orb on Kompakt. The most obvious forebear throughout Gute Left is Fehlmann's groove-heavy Kompakt debut, 2002's Visions of Blah, from the circular beats on ""Wasser im Fluss"" (and its counterpart, ""Fluss im Wasser"") to the heady, laser-guided highs of ""Permanent Touch"". The most arresting moments come when Fehlmann explores post-rock's cinematic terrain. ""Darkspark"" menacingly drones with a booming thud, while the minimalist blips that open ""Falling into Your Eyes"" dissolve into mournful horns and stretched-out orchestral sighs. These sounds are nothing new for anyone with a passing familiarity with Fehlmann's catalog, but when they're executed by someone with his ear and sense of structure, the results still feel fresh. Even the ostensibly incidental music here rewards close attention, and the whole is striking enough to make you wonder which direction Fehlmann will take next.","The versatile German producer returns with music created for a documentary, and the set serves as an excellent survey of his range.

"Shame, Shame",Dr. Dog,by: Zach Kelly,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a9045e6ef95969321338/1:1/w_160/b95353f2.jpg,2010-04-13 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14089-shame-shame/,Anti-,"After five offerings that refused to play outside of the same clumsy shadow of 1960s rock fetishism, Dr. Dog proved to be one of the most stubbornly stuck-in-their-way bands of recent memory. Previous release Fate seemed to be a step in the right direction-- cleaner production, more attention paid to songwriting instead of bland jamming-- but the songs still registered as lazy and reheated in an uncomfortably boring way. So it's a pleasant surprise that after a gruelingly long run of dry, indistinguishable material, Dr. Dog have produced a record that shakes off (most of) their pallid Beatles-borrowing and embraces a bigger, more charismatic sound. Shame, Shame is arguably the band's finest moment. As if working in reverse, the band is finally making terse, jaunty chamber-pop and folk-inflected rock collages that would suggest the work of a younger, wide-eyed outfit. Perhaps thanks to pal Jim James from My Morning Jacket (who lends a hand on the title track here), Dr. Dog are digging deeper into their rootsier leanings, taking cues from the Band and CSNY. The songs are best at their springiest, with ragtime-y pianos, blooming back-up harmonies, and a healthy injection of 70s AM gold. Where previously resigned to the same kind of middling, simple constructions that often just glazed over, Shame, Shame's highlights burst into full color: tracks like ""Where'd All the Time Go"", a euphoric farmhouse jam that suggests the Flaming Lips at their most anthemic, distract from the occasional lapse into circuitous ho-hummery. Dr. Dog still aren't the most inventive band in the world, lyrically characterless and often prone to plow into their influences so forcefully it's almost uncivilized. And depending where you are in proximity to your first cup of coffee today, portions of Shame, Shame might prove to be just a little too effervescent-- certainly not a bad thing for a band with a track record that usually ran contrary. The important thing is that these songs hit more than they miss, occasionally with shimmering resolve and a couple of really big choruses to back it all up, often quite memorably. Finally, some work from a veteran band that is actually starting to act like one.","After a gruelingly long run of 1960s rock fetishism and dry, indistinguishable material, Dr. Dog embrace a bigger, more charismatic sound.

True Love Cast Out All Evil,Roky EricksonOkkervil River,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a923ea9e61561daa59a3/1:1/w_160/8b999c71.jpg,2010-04-13 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14120-true-love-cast-out-all-evil/,Anti-,"Roky Erickson has been a lot of things in his lengthy career: howling psych-rocker, LSD advocate, spiritual quester, mental hospital patient, drug-war casualty, junk-mail collector, sci-fi aficionado, self-proclaimed alien, cult icon. Before he was any of that, though, he was a Texan. Sources vary on where he was born-- some say Dallas, others Austin-- but he has spent virtually all his life in the Lone Star State. That's crucial, not simply because Texas breeds a particularly prickly form of artist-- from Lightnin' Hopkins to Townes Van Zandt to Eagle Pennell-- but primarily because its artists tend to fiddle around with form and style, throwing together sounds and genres almost haphazardly. So, as a Texas musician, Erickson is by nature a synthesist, and even his earliest recordings with the 13th Floor Elevators exhibit an intuitive mix of blues, rock, psych, country, soul, and prayer. As his career has progressed, he has settled into that station comfortably, so that he now has more in common with Doug Sahm, ZZ Top, and even the Butthole Surfers (who have all worked with him over the decades) than with any of his 1960s psych-rock peers. So it makes sense that Erickson would partner up with Okkervil River for his first album in 15 years: Even though they've been branded broadly indie and have never been especially identified with their hometown of Austin, the band understands his origins and how they inform and even define his music. Will Sheff culled the dozen songs on True Love Cast Out All Evil from more than 60 that Erickson had written over the last four decades, then fashioned them into a setlist that emphasizes biography and breadth. Okkervil River back him like an especially erudite bar band, which allows them to indulge his every whim and mood and which emphasizes his songwriting range. As a result, the album repositions Erickson's psych rock as the foundation for a diverse sound that spans the Byrdsian riffs on ""Bring Back the Past"", warped folk of ""Ain't Blues Too Sad"", and garage-rock bluster of ""John Lawman"". For his part, Erickson sounds better than he has in decades: His voice retains a lot of its growl and grit, but remarkably, the man who gave ""You're Gonna Miss Me"" it madman edge sounds absolutely convincing baring his soul and pleading for his life on ""Please, Judge"". He comes across as more relaxed, more confident, more lively in his vocals, especially on the dignified country number ""Be and Bring Me Home"". Just as Okkervil River's smarts give them the range to back him, Erickson's eccentricities have created a huge sentimental streak. Newcomers who pick up this album might find his lyrics a bit precious-- especially when he sings, ""I won't jump on you/ Though we are all rubber""-- but these songs are clearly and inventively anchored in an unassuming, enormously uncynical perspective. Ultimately, his words can't help but coalesce into a detailed portrait of a man whose trials have made him hold his family, his friends, and his life all the more dearly. The urge with musicians like Erickson-- or like Syd Barrett, Skip Spence, Daniel Johnston, Nick Drake, or anyone with a tragic past-- is to hang their reputations on their pained histories rather than on their musical accomplishments. At times Sheff seems to be making too much of Erickson's biography, especially when he interrupts ""Please, Judge"" with a crescendoing cacophony of found sounds taken from old home videos or recorded at the Rusk State Hospital for the Criminally Insane, where Erickson served for drug possession. It's meant to refer not only to that sad chapter, but also to Erickson's schizophrenia, which caused him to blast televisions and videos to drown out the voices in his head. Crafting those artifacts into a sonic element is more of an academic idea than a musical one, and as such it feels somewhat exploitive, as if too caught up in the past to see the healthier present. Sheff wants to present Erickson as both a rock legend and a real human being, but Erickson just wants to sing. On this affecting and ultimately triumphant album, Erickson comes out on top.","The inimitable veteran rocker teams with fellow Texans Okkervil River on a record that gathers ideas and songs crafted over the past 40 years.

White Hills,White Hills,by: Jason Crock,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a8f55e6ef95969321318/1:1/w_160/b3a32eb0.jpg,2010-04-12 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14080-white-hills/,Thrill Jockey,"A label like ""space-rock"" deserves music that's as nuanced and limitless-feeling as space, and space-rock deserves a band like White Hills. Not only do they add urgency to familiar psychedelic rock templates, but they pay just as close attention to the quiet moments as the raging ones-- each track on their self-titled Thrill Jockey debut displays a careful layering of sounds and atmospheres. The album is carefully sequenced and covers a lot of ground in seven tracks, though the propulsive ""Dead"", originally released as a single late last year, sits atop it like the flag on the peak of a mountain. While its guitars are chugging, and the intricate pummeling from Oneida drummer Kid Millions is almost exhausting, its force gets subtly distorted by the dreamy, shoegaze vocals. It's a push-pull between churning and floating, between abandon and control. ""Let the Right One In"" and ""Polvere Di Stelle"" are epics that benefit from the same attention and layering-- the former has a stillness to its clean guitar riff akin to Mogwai, while building patiently to a sizzling climax. On the latter, the band builds hair-raising guitar drones and squealing solos under the song's detached surface. For other bands, the instrumentals between those aforementioned monsters would be a throwaway interlude; for White Hills; they're another chance to shine. These songs show the same careful layering, from the disorienting drones and campy space noises of ""Counting Sevens"" to the ambient outdoor noise of ""We Will Rise"" to the hair-raising tension of ""Glacial"". These songs are just as engaging in their own right, and the album's best tracks only benefit from the buildup and context that they provide. There's hero worship here, for sure, in White Hills' nods to giants like Hawkwind and dorm-room-poster rock like Pink Floyd, but their scope is wide and their execution is steely and precise. Only the unabashed metal riffery of ""Three Quarters"" gets dragged down by an uninspired lyric and singing; tones and atmospheres come much more naturally to the band than theatricality. If they paid a little more care to their occasional vocal turn, White Hills could be world-conquering; as is, we'll have to settle for this merely excellent record.","Thrill Jockey debut from this space-rock band adds urgency to familiar psych-rock templates while displaying a careful layering of sounds and atmospheres.

Small Black EP,Small Black,by: Zach Kelly,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a90d13d19756521397d1/1:1/w_160/9b2d1fc5.jpg,2010-04-12 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14100-small-black-ep/,Jagjaguwar,"This version of Small Black's debut EP is a remastered update of the original that popped up online last year, now outfitted with two additional tracks. Originally a bedroom duo consisting of Ryan Heyner and Josh Kolenik, Small Black added two new members (including Pitchfork.tv contributors Juan Pieczanski and Jeff Curtin) to bring the insular, demo-like tracks included here to a live setting. And if Small Black are shaping up to be a proper band (their upcoming full-length will feature the expanded line-up), this EP serves as an intriguing portrait of the group in its pollywog stage, making music that is simply stated and occasionally arresting. Much of the EP sounds almost half-formed, as heavy reverb and over-processed synthesizers often overwhelm the subtle melodies and bright patches that anchor the dazed, mercurial songs. Most often, you have to work a little harder for the small rewards; beneath the tangled synth chatter and seasick sway of ""Weird Machines"" is a joviality that could be blown up to fill a large space (confirmed by a live version that appeared on a recent split EP with the like-minded Washed Out). Such revelry can spill out of a track at any given moment, and major highlight ""Despicable Dogs"" is by far the best demonstration of it here. But Heyner and Kolenik seem more interested in establishing a mood than pursuing full-on pop pleasures; they often sabotage their more accessible moments with noisy sample cycles and calamitous, disorienting percussion. But Small Black should be approached as a document of a band in its embryonic form, a wash of ideas that work just often enough to be satisfying. The only real mistake is the addition of the two additional tunes-- the too-straightforward ""Kings of Animals"" and the ambling, harmonica-centered ""Baby Bird Pt. 2"". Both are true to the sound of the original EP, but they fail to conjure the same buzzing, sentimental vibe. Certainly the larger, fully formed version of Small Black is the one to look out for, but Small Black-- shaky, yet often gratifying-- is more than just a stop-gap.","The band currently touring with kindred spirit Washed Out supplements their 2009 EP with two additional tracks in a remastered edition on Jagjaguwar.

Slave Riot,Young Jazz Rebels,by: Paul Thompson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a924c0084474cd0c0f9d/1:1/w_160/0a5f5fc1.jpg,2010-04-12 06:00:02,Jazz,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14121-slave-riot/,Stones Throw,"The famed ESP-Disk label, one-time home to such free jazz giants as Pharoah Sanders and Sun Ra, emblazoned this motto on every record it released: ""The artists alone decide what you will hear on their ESP-Disk."" You can almost imagine Stones Throw offering Madlib the same luxury. The hyperprolific producer is a seeker, constantly refining and weirding up the signature haze he lends to his many projects. Slave Riot is the second Madlib-affiliated jazz record of 2010, a gauzy homage to the more freewheeling jazz of the 1960s and early 70s. Although it's missing much of the fire and the exploration of spirit that marked a lot of the jazz the Rebels tip their hats to, Slave Riot is further testament to Lib's open arms and near-unparalleled ear. From the faux-vinyl crackle that opens and closes the record to the murky burble that underpins most of the tracks, there's little question this is a Madlib record. Drums take the front seat, and the constantly shifting rhythms provide the bed upon which these Rebels stretch out. Keys and electric bass provide much of the melody, as it were; there's precious little in the way of solos, opting instead for a casual interplay between the instruments. The aversion to structure and an abundance of loose, vampy improvisation demarcates this jazz as ""free,"" but this being Madlib, it trends towards the downbeat, content to percolate rather than boil over. The sound often echoes spacier Sun Ra records, with shades of Miles Davis' funk-forward early-70s bands (particularly in the live setting)-- or even the interstitial stuff on the mid-90s Boredoms LPs. That in-between feeling is Slave Riot's biggest flaw; the Rebels constantly seem on the precipice of breaking out a towering solo, only to pull back or, worse yet, cut the track short. But Madlib's every bit as adept at creating a mood on a jazz record as he is on his more familiar hip-hop productions, and Slave Riot's gloriously overcast sound helps hold one's attention through its meanderings. This is free jazz for Madlib fans; it's crackly and inventive but warm and oddly familiar, and even if you're not the type to weigh Anthony Braxton improvisations against themselves, Slave Riot's inviting tone is likely to draw you in. Though an aversion to virtuosity is odd considering the players-- Ivan ""Mamao"" Conti of Brazilian jazz-funk mainstays Azymuth and frequent J Dilla collaborator Karriem Riggins among them-- and things feel monochromatic at times, the record settles into an agreeable groove and builds slowly from there. One never knows what to expect next from Madlib, and Slave Riot would be a better record were it as unpredictable as its creator, but it's impossible to imagine another hip-hop producer succeeding quite this well acting on what amounts to a whim. Here's to whatever's next.","Madlib again displays his near-unparalleled ear on this smoldering homage to the independent-minded, freewheeling jazz of the 1960s and early 70s.

It's not just because his discography includes a noisy digestive tract turned into a euphoric house melody; there's an appreciation for randomness, mistakes, and chaos that runs through his work. On his new solo album, One One, an artist who weaves multiple meanings into his music through contextual sampling strips down to a single source: himself. At first, it seems like a playful volley in Herbert's game of dissecting music, politics, and theory. The first of a trio of conceptual releases, including One Pig (composed strictly of sounds from one pig) and One Club (sampled crowd noise from a club), One One focuses more on instruments and is 100% Herbert, including his own intimate vocals. It's a solo record simple and straightforward, less of a concept than we're used to from someone who can turn a rhythm track into an arch-consumerist critique. What then is the difficulty, statement, or challenge when an acclaimed producer makes his own album? As with many things Herbert, it's not that easy or simple. A quieter, stripped-down approach to his typically tight rhythms and rich tones, One One has a deceptively relaxed vibe. It may be the rural studio that it was recorded in, or it may be Herbert being more introspective (just listen to him sing about home on ""Berlin""). He knows how to get the most out of his source material, and when that happens to be his own voice, he plays it cool or sticks to gentle, simple melodies. He doesn't showcase substantial range or a hidden talent, but Herbert does demonstrate a lack of artifice, self-awareness, and variety.""Singapore"" shines with a bright, folksy vibe and retro vocal harmonies. On the slow-burning single ""Leipzig"", his detached storytelling style fits the song's slinky, clubland theme. While it's conceptually all about one man, by the end of the ten heartfelt tracks, it doesn't feel as personally revealing as it does poignant. Maybe it's because the self-contained solo project is more subtle overall, with poetic, yet still political, lyrics (""And with the rising of the seas/ Mouths will be open/ And with the drying of the fields/ Everything will be gone""). Herbert met the challenge of ditching some experimental baggage and being more straightforward; he doesn't always need an elaborate platform or sonic ruse to say something worth hearing.","The post-modern music maker limits his contextual sampling to a single subject: himself.

Congratulations,MGMT,by: Scott Plagenhoef,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a9255e6ef9596932137b/1:1/w_160/2d856f82.jpg,2010-04-12 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14122-congratulations/,Columbia,"If you're coming to the second MGMT album because you loved ""Time to Pretend"", ""Kids"", and ""Electric Feel"", there's the door. No such moments exist on Congratulations. Hell, there aren't even failed attempts at replicating those songs here. This time out, MGMT aren't crafting pop; they're Creating Art. The problem is that many of the half-million or so people who bought their debut, Oracular Spectacular, just want a couple catchy-as-fuck, ear-candy singles to blast in their cars or put on with their friends. One possible response to Congratulations is that MGMT are having a real ""time to pretend"" moment-- that they're willfully being weird, and either shrinking from the challenge of repeating their crossover success or clumsily aiming to prove their underground cred. But the simplest answer seems most realistic: MGMT are being themselves. Ben Goldwasser and Andrew VanWyngarden wrote and released ""Time to Pretend"" and ""Kids"" way back in 2005. With a major-label contract in hand, they've never again written anything so radio-friendly. Instead, they penned the headier and exploratory (and weaker) parts of their debut album with help from go-to bells-and-whistles guy Dave Fridmann. This led to songs called ""4th Dimensional Transition"" and ""Of Moons, Birds & Monsters"". Pastoral English pop, flighty mysticism, and studio-rat arrangements aren't the exception with this band, they're the rule. Now they've returned with an album full of that stuff, and the result is audacious, ambitious, and a little fried. Working with Spacemen 3's Sonic Boom, MGMT have crafted a grandiose but not always clear-eyed record. Instead of the commercial climbers they're lumped alongside (the Killers, Kings of Leon, Muse), MGMT follow the lead of the Flaming Lips and Beck and prove to be kindred spirits with Of Montreal, Yeasayer, and Klaxons. They're in love with 1970s art-rock, and they've immersed themselves in uncool subgenres like pop-psych and prog. And despite the lack of marquee songs, they've made, top to bottom, a more interesting and even better record this time out. If their success granted them the opportunity to do whatever they wanted, MGMT took advantage of it, layering songs with a surplus of ideas when a few good ones would have done. Every track here has successful passages, but frustratingly, they too often turn out to be detours or trap doors. In general, the less cluttered and more focused their tracks are, the better they turn out. The most satisfying songs are the ballads-- the title track in particular, but also ""I Found a Whistle""-- or the ones like ""It's Working"" and ""Someone's Missing"" that walk a fairly linear path. The most arduous is the 12-minute ""Siberian Breaks"", which has some intriguing elements but little discernible reason to be so densely constructed. Few bands this year will release a record under more difficult circumstances than MGMT, and following a shock commercial success with a zig when your fans want you to zag has always been dangerous. MGMT aren't hitting the self-destruct button here, but the best-case scenario is that a cult, happy to shed the carpetbagger fans of OS, are willing to follow these guys around from idea to idea. Some may even use them as an introduction to the bands they've namechecked-- Spacemen 3, Brian Eno, Television Personalities-- and the sounds from which they've drawn inspiration. The more likely, short-term result is that MGMT are reined in a bit, not given so much rope to hang themselves. But that they didn't hang themselves here, given the circumstances, suggests a certain amount of talent. Whether they write club-friendly songs like ""Kids"" or tracks like ""Congratulations"" or ""Flash Delirium"" or ""It's Working"", they can write songs. Hopefully, next time they won't try to jam two dozen of them onto a nine-track album.","MGMT follow the surprise hit Oracular Spectacular by teaming with Spacemen 3's Sonic Boom for a leftfield psych-pop LP bereft of obvious singles.

After a quick EP and single released within a year of their 2009 formation, they're bringing Escape (via recent lo-fi haven Woodsist) just as swiftly. Four songs in just under 30 krautrock minutes, it's an LP that pulls Johnson even closer to Suicide and Silver Apples, influences that have played an audibly important role in his work with Wooden Shjips. Johnson's vocals are barely there, whispers buried in sheets of two-chord riffs and Yamada's keyboard dissonance. Moon Duo don't stray too far from the deep-cutting, fuzzy gymnastics of Johnson's other band, though he's allowed further freedom to hypnotize on the playground where he's most comfortable. More than just a branching off deeper into another third eye, Escape is a pop record at its core. Or at each end. Opener ""Motorcycle, I Love You"" churns along on a classic Phil Spector drumbeat, speeding up as Yamada and Johnson add layer upon layer of shadow and menace. It's a very sexy juxtaposition, and Moon Duo's music is sexy throughout, the interplay between Johnson and Yamada on full, propulsive display. Whether Johnson's taking a pause to add some breathy vocals or working up a froth on his guitar, the song's pulse won't quit. The middle of the record's a different animal. ""In the Trees"" slows shit down to a grind, Johnson soloing through screens and clouds of low-end more akin to the drone of Wooden Shjips. ""Stumbling 22nd St"" employs an equally heavy feel, Yamada acting as the song's melodic spine this time out with a keyboard riff her bandmate embraces from time to time by mimicking it on guitar. The titular closing track is pure pop in comparison, if only in that it's infinitely lighter and easy to digest. Riffing over a drumbeat and a breeze, Johnson sounds a lot like Ducktails' Matthew Mondanile as the latter does when in his zone. All that track-by-track geeking aside, what makes Escape so successful is that these two are able to meet you halfway-- just as they do one another. Traditionally, the repetitive forms they're working with make for relatively passive listening. But this isn't that kind of psych record; textures are engaging, rhythms reveal serious drive. And be it the way they set a hook or the way they lord over each song's space, Moon Duo don't beam you out. They pull you in.","Woodsist presents the first full-length from this krautrock-indebted collaboration featuring Wooden Shijps guitarist Erik ""Ripley"" Johnson.

Dosh's previous records had a tendency to open with a sort of tonal discretion, allowing the listener some sapce before working themselves into jazz-imbued grooves. Tommy, however, begins in the middle, and as such, ""Subtractions"" sounds as if someone had flipped the ""record"" switch during a jam session without letting anyone know that tape was rolling. That restlessly energizing sound bleeds right into ""Yer Face"", with vapor-trailed drum fills and snatches of coos surrounding a rare, sighing vocal turn by Dosh himself. Together, these tunes are arguably more potent than anything Dosh has recorded throughout his career. An album filled with tracks like these would be a real treat. Unfortunately, Tommy is not that album. Much of the record-- named after and dedicated to late soundman and friend Tom Cesario-- finds Dosh working comfortably within his folktronica wheelhouse. Maybe too comfortably, in fact: it's very easy to let this record pass right by you without noticing it's there. The issue isn't a consistent mood, though: there are takes on IDM (""Country Road X""), hip-hop (""Airlift""), and bummed-out folk (""Nevermet"") here. However, none of these genres are tackled with anything more than a mannered intention, as Dosh treats the material with fussiness. What it really needs is a shot of spontaneity. Album low point ""Number 41"", featuring Andrew Bird, is especially staid, with a drowsy vocal turn by Bird that makes even the most boring of his own material seem effervescent by comarpsion. Regardless, Tommy's strongest moments-- the elegiac piano on the ironically-named ""Loud"" or the hollow boom-bap of ""Airlift""-- sound fully realized and complete, suggesting that Dosh's best work is still yet to come. When Dosh stretches his legs on the album's longer compositions, the results are especially compelling: a honking saxophone riff turns ""Call the Kettle"" into a woozy carnival ride, while the acoustic post-rock textures of eight-minute-plus closer ""Gare de Lyon"" rip open to reveal a brawny guitar figure and supercharged cymbal hits. Dosh has indeed graduated from the sketchbook-like arrangements that marked his earlier work-- but Tommy's occasional tedium is a reminder that there's nothing wrong with doodling in the margins, either.","Stretching his legs beyond his folktronica wheelhouse, Dosh's latest album is a compelling glimpse of potential things to come.

They wrote a handful of songs together; several appeared on 2002's limited-run ""antifolk"" compilation AFNY Collaborations, Vol. 1, but they've largely gone unheard, if not unremembered. Almost 10 years later, we have The Bundles, a collection of tunes crafted on their first meeting, fleshed out with a few recent stragglers. The initial batch of songs comes from a particularly fertile, formative period for both songwriters: Lewis' early stuff is easily his most distinct, and Dawson's early-00s work with Adam Green is among her most beloved. The two seem like a good pair, sharing a bunch of fans, a kooky worldview, and a fondness for loose chords and uneasy answers. But listening to The Bundles, one wonders why they felt these songs were due for a resurrection. As with most bursts of creative energy, The Bundles starts out strong; opener ""A Common Chorus"" has a Moldy Peaches-style two-songs-at-once verse that ambles toward the titular hook. Dawson's wizened warble and Lewis' world-weariness sit comfortably beside each other, and when they overlap for the tune's big payoff, it's nearly as satisfying as anything in either's vast catalog. But, as always, these two proudly display (and sometimes flaunt) their flaws, and The Bundles seems to amplify them. The mostly Lewis-led ""Shamrock Glamrock"" is dour and unfocused, a sharp shift in tone from the laughs they'd been having on previous tracks, and the hokey blues-punk of ""Ishalicious"" is a genre experiment that thankfully neither has replicated since. Dawson's budding ability to flip something strange into something strangely poignant hadn't fully formed yet, so a lot of these tunes lean awfully hard on nonsense. The lovely ""Over the Moon"", with its appeal to community and rousing choral closeout, is another winner, but there's little else to recommend in the middle of the record; the tunes feel limp and half-finished, the lyrics disjointed and drab, the two songsmiths often writing over, not with, each other. Fans of Lewis or Dawson aren't gonna care much that this isn't holy grail stuff; if you've been following either, you're used to a little unevenness. But the true superfans have likely heard the best of these tunes before, on the AFNY comp-- save rousing closer ""Be Yourself""-- and the Juno set may not know what to make of Dawson at her most unbridled, to say nothing of Lewis' eager-Eeyore routine. If you never gave a hoot about either, 40 uneven minutes of frayed chords and poop jokes probably won't change that. Both have done and are doing better work, and while the bulid-up to The Bundles makes for a neat story, it reads a little better without this final chapter.","Kimya Dawson and Jeffrey Lewis collect some tunes crafted when they first met nearly 10 years ago, fleshed out with a few recent stragglers.

High Places vs. Mankind,High Places,by: Joe Colly,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a910ea9e61561daa5980/1:1/w_160/b09f690c.jpg,2010-04-09 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14103-high-places-vs-mankind/,Thrill Jockey,"High Places showed up in 2008 pegged as a Brooklyn act, but they never seemed very metropolitan. If anything, their innocent, home-recorded songs felt pastoral or coastal-- concerned more with breaking out of the city rather than toiling in it. That escapist tendency, mixed with their sonic primitivism and hopeful outlook, was refreshing. Even if their style wasn't exactly groundbreaking (we'd heard others combine global polyrhythms, hip-hop beats, and field recordings before), their approach was unique. In part because of Rob Barber's ragged production, High Places made those sounds feel roomy and lived-in. While a good record, 2008's High Places was primarily an extension of what the band established with their singles collection 03/07 – 09/07. The sound was slightly glossier, but mostly it was vocalist Mary Pearson once again cooing over Barber's fractured arrangements. With High Places vs. Mankind, though, all that is out of the window. If you count High Places as their first true album, then their latest is a classic sophomore change-up-- a departure in both style and temperament. Far from the doe-eyed innocence and sunny bliss of their earlier work, High Places are darker and much more somber here, and their approach to recording and presentation has changed. The biggest difference is the band's mood. High Places used to stress resiliency and optimism, but now they seem resigned to life's disappointments. On early track ""On Giving Up"", Pearson, who once radiated childlike hopefulness, sings solemnly of loss: ""Though I have cried so many times before, it's all because I feel everything that's gone."" Similar themes of heartbreak and fear exist throughout the album, and there's a notable change in the way the band sounds, too. Instead of the earlier sample-heavy style, Barber incorporates more live instrumentation, and as a result High Places feel more like a band. There are still loops and dance elements, but the focus is often more on heavy post-punk guitar-and-bass lines that enhance the overall gloomy vibe. It's a surprising turn for the group, and whether or not you like them more as sunny optimists or somber realists is a matter of taste. The more pressing question is how this shift affects the quality of the songs. Mostly it works, but there are also songs here, especially the instrumental ones (""The Channon"", ""Drift Slayer"") that aren't very memorable. Even a few of the more pop-focused cuts tend to skimp on melody, and it makes me think that in the band's desire to overhaul, they lost a bit of their initial spark. Still, the album is encouraging because it shows a talented young group unafraid of growth. Even if this isn't their best collection of songs, it takes nerve to try something so different.","On their second proper LP, High Places move from the wispy optimism that characterized their early work, opting for a darker sound to suit more solemn songs.

Wu-Massacre,Ghostface KillahRaekwonMethod Man,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a915ea9e61561daa5989/1:1/w_160/925a0311.jpg,2010-04-09 06:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14112-wu-massacre/,Def Jam,"Initially, the most shocking thing about Raekwon's long-promised 2009 album Only Built 4 Cuban Linx... Pt. II was that it actually existed. You could say the same for Wu-Massacre, a new collaboration from Ghostface Killah, Raekwon, and Method Man. Unlike Cuban Linx II-- a long-rumored sequel to a decade-old record-- talk of Wu-Massacre only began to surface last July. Tracks were leaked shortly afterward, videos were filmed, cover art was revealed, and now, it's here. Forget about Wu-Tang product; that timetable is unthinkable for most major hip-hop releases. The limitations of that turnaround are unmistakable on Wu-Massacre. The three stars appear on a total of three songs together, and the padding they needed to push the album beyond CD-single status is obvious from the credits alone: two skits, guest verses from nearly every Theodore Unit B-teamer (Sheek Louch sorta counts at this point), and three remakes. All to account for about 30 minutes of music. ""Criminology"" was on Only Built 4 Cuban Linx, and it's probably the one word most closely associated with Raekwon's style. But for reasons that escape logic, he doesn't even show up to open the album on ""Criminology 2.5"". Hearing Method Man paraphrase some of his old lines (""Fuck that, criminology rap/ Niggas hate and I hate back, floating the flyest Maybach"") is a little like watching Speed 2, and the beat itself is just a glossed-up karaoke version of the original. ""Mef vs. Chef 2"" is better, but again, the sequel suffers from context-- on the original, whoever RZA chose as the winner of the duel of the iron mic would get the track on their solo release. Here, it shares space with a 30-second rant from Tracy Morgan on worthless hoes. Still, at the record's core are three MCs willing to spend a little critical capital and just have fun over pitchshifted soul beats. Method Man could have felt like a third wheel here, but his concise hooks anchor the more awkwardly wordy ones from Ghost and Rae. Whether he's playing the seducer on ""Miranda"" or the verboloigst on ""Gunshowers"", Meth flexes the understated versatility that made his turns on Cuban Linx II so enduring. Ghostface thankfully sounds energized and committed again after last year's cynical Wizard of Poetry, which helps overshadow the familiarity of his material. ""Youngstown Heist"" finds him back in deranged ""Shakey Dog"" mode, which is fun again until Sheek Louch and Bully tank the song's second half. But you evaluate what you got, not what you wanted, and being too harsh on Wu-Massacre is kind of like criticizing a hamburger for not performing a steak's duty. Twenty-five minutes of these three on autopilot still hits more often than not, ultimately making this disc a mixtape-y More Fish-style companion to Cuban Linx II-- hardly necessary, but not inconsequential.","Three of Wu-Tang's top MCs show up together on this 30-minute LP for three whole songs, padding out the rest with skits and guest verses.

Bubu King,Janka Nabay,by: Joshua Love,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a911c0084474cd0c0f7d/1:1/w_160/e8023b9f.jpg,2010-04-08 06:00:04,Global,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14104-bubu-king/,True Panther,"Many of us know Sierra Leone for one thing: diamonds. Specifically, ""blood"" or ""conflict"" diamonds, gems mined by some of the world's poorest people and subsequently used to fund warfare that further endangers those impoverished individuals. Thanks to a song by Kanye West and a film starring Leo DiCaprio, Western audiences have recently been widely exposed to horrors taking place in Sierra Leone since the early 1990s. But voices originating from the country itself, addressing its struggles and disseminating its unique national character, have been in short supply in the West. Musically, Sierra Leone likewise hasn't established a global presence on par with West African neighbors like Nigeria and Mali. Enter Janka Nabay, a Sierra Leone native who escaped the country during the bloody 90s and is now bringing its music to new ears as a transplanted resident of Philadelphia. Specifically, the sound Nabay makes is known as bubu music, a genre rooted in the rhythms of funeral processions conducted by the Muslim Temne people of the country's northwest region. Bubu is traditionally produced by large groups of players blowing on bamboo shoots, accompanied by shakers, triangles, and thudding pulse-beats pounded out on large wooden boxes. Nabay severely strips down this setup while preserving its teeming twitchiness, using keyboards and carburetor pipes to create a minimal but undeniably kinetic brand of music that he weds to socially conscious lyrics. Bubu King is an EP of four songs Nabay recorded before departing Sierra Leone and represents the first-ever commercial release of bubu music in the West. Considering these tracks have been sitting in the can for about 15 years, the frequent modernity of their sound is remarkable, starting with the opener, ""Top Sul Bah"", which pairs rattling percussion with dreamy synthesized tones. Of course, Nabay makes such minimalism all his own with the chanting intonations he lays atop the beat-- the song's title translates as ""What's Going On"", and that's exactly what Nabay wishes to convey. The succeeding track, ""Eh Congo"", ratchets up the politicized content with references to John Kennedy and allusions to the humanitarian influx of wheat and clothing, though the music's repetitive pipe pattern ultimately drags over the song's five minutes. More sonically successful and even more socially charged, ""Good Governance"" boasts a busily skittering beat intermittently supplemented with a wonderful descending keyboard melody, with lyrics (in English) that call earnestly but admirably for democracy bolstered by the participation of women. Bubu King then closes with the lovely but anomalous ""De Debul"", a beautiful guitar-laden track that seems much more in line with the melodic West African stuff we in the West have been devouring with particular gusto in recent years. It's a nice tune, but a touch less distinctive. Here's hoping this EP inspires Nabay to share more of Sierra Leone's uniquely engaging bubu music down the road.","The Sierra Leone-born singer releases a short but satisfying EP containing his native country's minimal and hypnotic bubu music.

Extra Wow,Nice Nice,by: Jason Crock,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a8edc0084474cd0c0f37/1:1/w_160/884973ce.jpg,2010-04-08 06:00:03,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14072-extra-wow/,Warp,"Nice Nice is the work of one guitarist, one drummer, and a whole lot of electronic loops. Their first album, Chrome, was a collection of alien funk, sound collages, and junkyard skronk. They've since released a few EPs, always honing a distinct, layered, and monstrous sound that seems far too large to be the work of just two men. Extra Wow-- their second full-length and first for Warp—keeps the eclecticism of their previous work but aims to be more cohesive via a relentlessly sunny, psychedelic feel. Rather than lean on samples and loops as simple backing tracks, Nice Nice have a musical conversation with them. Over a drone of human voices and machine-like buzzing, ""Set and Setting"" begins with an insistent beat, and the guitar and vocals stab through the mix in monotone bursts. That haze slides into ""One Hit"", which is marked by full-band staccato pounding, falling apart into messy skronk before resuming again. ""A Way We Glow"" starts with a cymbal patter before layering on bells, whistles, bird noises, inscrutable percussion, and various electronic squiggles-- though it's the high falsetto that gives the track its airy, dreamlike feel. The two men manage to sound like one big machine on the verge of blowing apart. The interplay between the two musicians and their numerous loops is so remarkably fluid, it's not until fifth track ""Everything Falling Apart"" that individual contributions become discernible. Yet even as that song provides a steadier beat and recognizable lyrics, its tension comes from the frantic pace and the circular, chirping melody that closes it. As the record progresses, the line between man and machine gets more blurred. A chorus of what sounds like thumb pianos gives ""See Waves"" a distinctive sound while keeping with the album's eclectic vibe. Most of the album's second half follows the same pattern to less memorable effect. There are a lot of recent genre-blurring artists that Extra Wow can remind you of in spirit-- recent Animal Collective, Dan Deacon, Caribou. But while those artists found greater success by paring down and tightening their focus, Nice Nice are all about repetition and expansion. It's technically stunning for just two men, but with the exception of a few tighter tracks, Extra Wow is too gleefully overloaded to do more than maintain a vibe and feel.","Portland duo's first Warp album maintains their previous work's eclecticism but aims for a more cohesive listen with a relentlessly sunny, psychedelic feel.

No Mas,Javelin,by: Rob Mitchum,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a91e9d034d5c69bf3bc9/1:1/w_160/43e9e055.jpg,2010-04-08 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14115-no-mas/,Luaka Bop,"Even blog bands need an iconic image, and Javelin hit the interwebs with an especially effective one-- a mountain of painted boomboxes, fronting the Brooklyn duo's table of samplers, turntables, drumpads, and various other misfit musical toys. Not only did it look pretty boss as a jpeg, it also was pretty accurate visual shorthand for their sound: Less turntablism, more an FM tuner shoulder-jostling between low-watt stations playing electro, funk, world music, and early hip-hop. Javelin first parceled out that unique approach with a series of mixes and singles, most of which were hazy and fidelity-challenged enough for people to lump them in with chillwave. But Javelin's genetic code seemed more early-80s than late-60s, and the sound quality seemed like more of a mood-setter than a slapdash affectation. On Jamz n Jemz, Tom van Buskirk and George Langford crafted a cohesive sound collage more in step with the dense travelogues of the Avalanches than any of their basement-electronic peers. So it actually made sense when musical travel agency Luaka Bop signed them up for their proper debut, No Mas. By the sound of the record, Luaka Bop also gave Javelin a good, long bath, exfoliating away the crackles and hiss and distilling the songs from their interstitial surroundings. The fully groomed result is a segmented hybrid of semi-revised previously released tracks and new music that reveals the duo as a far less exotic product than early scouting may have suggested. ""Vibrationz"" is still a killer single, but other familiar tunes sound adrift when isolated from a broader mix, such as the 70s montage sequence ""The Merkin Jerk"", or the glitch-hop of ""Susie Cues"". Attempts to makeover old tracks are a mixed bag, as the sunny ""Intervales Theme"" holds up at double the length, while adding vocals to previously instrumental ""Mossy Woodland"" is an awkward move. Meanwhile, Javelin's new material fits in well alongside older tracks without doing much to expand the duo's palate. ""Tell Me What Will I Be?"" is a funk period piece that would turn the Dap-Kings green, ""On It on It"" summons up all the right robot-leg flashbacks, and ""Shadow Heart"" has a cinematic, psychedelic sweep that evades being pinned down as just one particular homage. If songs like the overdone retro of ""Moscow 1980"" and the directionless soul jam ""Dep"" are less memorable, well, at least they might have a second life as puzzle pieces in a future Javelin collage. In the end No Mas can't top those longer mixes, which remain van Buskirk and Langford at their sample-heavy, genre-trotting finest. Dressed up and chopped into discrete chunks, Javelin suddenly bear a close resemblance to the Go! Team-- skilled peddlers of vintage party jams, but with a narrow range. Javelin's best tracks may hold up under professional production in a year where many a group's cassette-tape flaws will likely sabotage similar leaps, but trading in their boombox for a proper stereo isn't necessarily an upgrade.","Mixing electro, funk, world music, and early hip-hop, Javelin made waves with mixtapes and singles; now, via Luaka Bop, they offer their scrubbed-up debut LP.

The Dark Leaves,Matt Pond PA,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a8d4ea9e61561daa58f5/1:1/w_160/e3a1903c.jpg,2010-04-08 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14058-the-dark-leaves/,Altitude,"You could applaud Matt Pond for somehow staying on the periphery of indie rock discussions despite nominal sonic differences between him and, say, Duncan Sheik. But ultimately that puts The Dark Leaves in a position to be judged against music that has so much more to offer. The project's shortcomings are even more pronounced this time out since The Dark Leaves sounds like it's striving and somewhat succeeding in being the band's most rhythmically vital record. Leaves' first third tries to pump itself up with double-time, handclap-sparked rhythms owing something to polite church revivals (""Starting"") and rockabilly (""Running Wild"", which gives a nod to Queen's ""Crazy Little Thing Called Love""). But neither comes anywhere close to generating actual friction amidst such downy arrangements. These are mostly compositions of ""roots"" instruments, including acoustic guitars, pedal steel, and violins. But a cooling wash of synth pads and reverb makes everything flow like a shot of Jäger down an ice luge-- smooth but sickly sweet and mostly numbing. Indeed, there's a narcotic effect to sleepy weepers like ""Brooklyn Fawn"" and ""Specks"", so when the ca. 2000 Brit-rock of ""Ruins"" hits a couple of strange flatted notes on its way up the piano scale, it's a jarring but welcome display of energy. But elsewhere, too much is demanded of Pond, one of the meekest vocalists ever to name a band after himself. His voice isn't unpleasant in a grating or unusual way, but there's an unsettling quality to it that sounds like it's been shot through with Vaseline, eliding over his lyrics so you accidentally hear things like, ""I believe in manatees."" The actual next line is, ""I believe in you and me/ Everything we'll ever see,"" meaning that Pond is sticking to cryptic-- but not particularly interesting-- stories of lost love and icky Dave Matthews-style romance (""Running Wild""). Pond pleads on ""Remains"", ""If you want my blood, let me bleed/ If you want a ghost/ Then that's what I'll be."" But his hitching, strained phrasing conveys bothersome neediness rather than strident devotion. The subject of ""Brooklyn Fawn"" might be some sort of embodiment of substance-related frailty, but it's so vague that you only recognize Pond's habit of invoking the borough's name in hopes of siphoning some of its urban intrigue. Replace ""Brooklyn"" with ""Teaneck"" and it's pretty much the same song. Another key line from ""Remains"": ""I can't remember which movie taught me pain."" Like some of Pond's better-known lyrics-- ""Heard it's modern to be stupid,"" ""I don't think I want to think about it""-- it's ostensibly meant to be a deadpan commentary on the emotional disconnectedness of the upwardly mobile. But it ultimately carries no weight in the context of The Dark Leaves' willingness to slip into the background, content to be something you tune out while going about your day.","The New York-based singer/songwriter releases his eighth full-length, and first since 2007's Last Light.

Or at least truly awful. A 2xCD album, with 22 guest vocalists, devoted to the life, loves, and sartorial obsessions of the infamous Imelda Marcos, wife of equally infamous Filipino despot Ferdinand Marcos? Masterminded by two of music's most inventive nerds-- David Byrne and Fatboy Slim? Oddball subject, high-profile collaborators, unchecked ambition: a combination that should guarantee either a left-field classic or a cringe-inducing misstep. A grand or gaudy approach that fits the garish, romantic, obsessive arc of its heroine's life. Instead we get efficient dance-pop and tropical-tinged adult alternative given the routinized sheen of Broadway showtunes. For a few songs the combination's curious enough to maintain semi-passive interest. Persevere through all 22 tunes, and you'll find an EP's worth of keepers, mostly thanks to strong performances by the usual suspects: Róisín Murphy transforming a just-funky-enough disco pastiche into another of her patented conversational come-ons; Sharon Jones as New Jack Swing-era rent-a-diva. But less than an hour in, the album's initially exquisite-sounding production starts to feel weirdly oppressive. It smothers the playfulness and rough edges of Byrne and Slim's respective obsessions-- Bahia-meets-Bacharach romanticism and shamelessly big beats-- in a layer of icky showbiz schmaltz. Imagine a Vegas producer staging an all-star tribute to Caetano Veloso, or the Lawrence Welk band rearranging the Jam and Lewis songbook. Or maybe just imagine two oddball pop geniuses choosing to collaborate on a pet project in the waning days of the album era. But once in the studio, the pair contracts some kind of airborne soft-rock virus. Thus infected, they can only manage to write the kind of unthreatening but unfailingly pleasant filler designed to pad out department store playlists when programmers run out of Train songs. How else to explain the weakest songs on Here Lies Love, especially the second half of disc one? And even they're not bad, per se, unless the very idea of bland competence offends you. Byrne and Slim never misstep here, but they also never surprise. At best you may wind up distantly admiring their craftsmanship. But if musicians are going for scale and spectacle-- and a project like this all but demands it-- shouldn't they, like, go for it? True, most overlong and overambitious concept albums wind up total trainwrecks, but at least then they're sorta enjoyable for it. But like a middling 1,000 page novel, or a three-hour cinematic epic that's just kind of okay, a competent 90-minute mini-musical serves only one purpose: To reinforce the precious finitude of human life. Devote an hour-and-a-half to this? Why? You could listen to Remain in Light twice with time to spare.

His homebase is Brooklyn-via-Minneapolis, his label affiliation is Ghostly-via-Moodgadget, and his music is hip-hop-via-electro-- or maybe vice-versa; you know how lines get blurred these days. Lindgren's career as synthesizer-fidgeting beatmaker Mux Mool has been defined more by sounds than styles-- one of those widescreen genre-absorbing approaches that's made ""bass music"" the vague but fitting descriptor of choice for instrumental post-hip-hop. And in keeping with the approach of a generation that finds electronic sounds to be not only natural but familiar, he tends to bring out the loose, humanistic side of waveforms and electronic keyboards in all their idiosyncrasies. That's probably one of the more cohesive ways to pin down the personality of Skulltaste, an album that's a hell of a lot harder to define in terms of scenes or categories. Floating through Boards of Canada wooziness one moment, churning out Tobacco-esque bass filth the next, Mux Mool has put together an album whose sonic multiple-personality disorder could be aggravating if it wasn't so consistently engaging. And for all his weirdo fronting-- eccentric song titles, a Tron-gone-metal visual aesthetic, sparsely doled-out party clichés and braggadocio as the only prominent lyrical content-- his work transcends its mild jokiness to reveal the adventurousness of a musical scholar. Every scholar needs a starting point, and Mux Mool's seems to be the watershed period where chart-rap juggernauts, Native Tongues heirs, and independent-as-fuck iconoclasts were all pushing the boundaries of what they could do with synthesizers. So you could call this stuff hip-hop if you felt like it-- there's a heavy pulse of clap-beats, intricate snares, and rave bass that split the difference between Fantastic, Vol. 2's warmth and the blown-out dirtiness of The Cold Vein. But that's just the support structure, and it bolsters everything from lurching boom-bap (""Breakfast Enthusiast"") and euphoric Dirty South bounce (""Ballad of Gloria Featherbottom"") to the blissed-out ""Morning Strut"", which features a choppy, mournful piano straight out of the 9th Wonder playbook. And while Skulltaste falls under hip-hop jurisdiction if you go by Bambaataa rules, it definitely stretches way the hell out, branching into ambient downtempo, glossy disco, and neon electro. No complaints here, quality-wise-- ""Enceladus"" is perfect circa-1999 French-style house, and the manic shudder of ""Crackers"" is the kind of hyperspeed pop-and-lock fodder that leaves lesser 80s-evoking club jams in the dust. A fluid stylistic identity isn't the worst thing to have, and when he dials down the tempo and delivers something like the warped-tape ""SFW Porn"" or the lowrider-hovercar anthem ""Dandelion"", dude straight up steals your favorite chillwave band's lunch money. It's definitely exciting to hear an artist who can excel in so many different corners of beat music, but it'll really pay off once Mux Mool finishes carving out a corner of his own.","Post-hip-hop producer creates an album whose sonic multiple-personality disorder could be aggravating if it weren't so consistently engaging.

Granted, the rhythmic play in their work might not have always been the focus, but, live and on record, the duo's use of stereo effects has long given their tracks a tidal, back-and-forth motion. Since leaving Kranky in 2004, Growing have avoided flatlining hums altogether. On 2006's Color Wheel, when they were still collecting Eno and Earth comparisons, the effects through which Denardo and Doria routed their guitar and bass-- and the way those pieces fit, phasing and lacing up and down, in and out-- gave tracks like ""Fancy Period"" and ""Green Pastures"" tiny but distinct rhythms. They kept at it: On both the 2008 EP Lateral and the 2008 LP All the Way, Growing emphasized that metric aspect, making it obvious by adding actual beats (""Rave Pie Only"") or, more frequently, by stacking gorgeous tones that created incidental rhythm. It comes as little surprise, then, that Growing have now made the next beat-driven advance, adding a third member, vocalist and sampler controller Sadie Laska, and shifting the balance of their focus from tones graced by rhythms to rhythms graced by tones. But there's always a downbeat: It doesn't work, at least not yet. Growing have been at their best when they've been most immersive, when they let the listener slip into their atmosphere of ideas. And that-- not this newly pronounced dependence on rhythms and vocals-- is why PUMPS! is so underwhelming. Growing's approach is uncharacteristically undeveloped here, as the trio never seems to know for what exactly what it's aiming. On ""Massive Dropout"", they stunt an interesting, textural beat with unnecessary electronic interference. After all, it's easier to hide ancillary sounds beneath a roar that saturates the tape than beneath a drum machine that leapfrogs from one meter to the next. Closer ""Mind Eraser"" succeeds where its predecessors don't, committing to one idea and stretching it across the album's most vibrant eight minutes. The beat-- quick, skittering bursts of cheap electronic drums-- enters at the top, followed by repeated, short stabs of noise that, relative to the rest of the kit, feel like a heavy-metal kick drum. Laska eases in samples of clipped phrases, pushing them and pulling them through the mix. Chopped and twisted, they bounce off of the beat and each other, different colors of light colliding in funhouse mirrors. Otherwise, the new Growing jumps from thought to thought, with very few of them being very interesting. ""Camera '84"" lays spectral vocals beneath a big, dumb beat, adding veins of noise wherever they fit. It's a confused, ricocheting piece of music that never finds its groove. Similarly, the transitions are mostly circumstantial, half-baked attempts to make a somewhat seamless album. The wood block pitter-patter that emerges with only a dozen seconds left in ""Challenger"" and exits six seconds into ""Highlight"" has little to do with either track. With nearly 30 seconds left, ""Highlight"" sloughs the beat and the electronic pops and plinks flying from channel to channel, forcing a jump into the long drift that leads to ""Drone Burger"", the album's two-minute acknowledgment of Growing's sprawling past. It's a painful reminder: Growing, the half-dance trio, need to put in a lot of work before they can augment that legacy.","Former duo adds a third member, shifting the balance of their focus from tones graced by rhythms to rhythms graced by tones.

And given the nature of your typical odds-and-ends collection-- curious diversions at best, throwaway experiments at worst, and a whole lot of business as usual in between-- you'd be forgiven for expecting little more than fan-bait out of a release that gathers the band's between-album singles and rarities. But the big draw of Wooden Shjips is the way they go about streamlining multiple strains of psychedelic rock with the single-mindedness of a band more interested in refinement than experimentation, and there's plenty of refined material on Vol. 2. It helps that Wooden Shjips had already synthesized a wide range of approaches into their sound by the time they set about following up their debut. Attention's been given to their old-school acid rock influences, but they draw from the other end of the 1970s just as vividly. ""Loose Lips"" here is a good exhibit of this-- not just with Ripley Johnson's characteristically distant, spooked Alan Vega vocals, but its nods to Chrome's aluminum-guitar sound and droning keyboards reminiscent of the first Tubeway Army album as well. B-side ""Start to Dreaming"" is a bit less distinct, and the rushed attempt at cramming a slow build into its first 45 seconds sounds a little superfluous, especially for one of their shorter songs. But it does a decent job of highlighting the frenetic interplay of Johnson's vertigo-inducing guitar solos and Nash Whalen's strobe-light organ riffs. Like most of the tracks collected here, ""Start to Dreaming"" gives the guitar and keyboard free reign to wander elaborately over a relatively static rhythm section. Wooden Shjips songs aren't particularly restless when it comes to grooves, and good luck finding a chorus, but letting the drums and bass plod along until they sink into the background lets you zoom in on the elaborate swirls of noise that sprawl across them. They do this to bracing effect in a few different gears: The slo-mo Hawkwind swells on ""I Hear the Vibrations (E-Z Version)"" melt into the cracks between the beats and bubble back out again, while live-show cut ""Death's Not Your Friend"" stretches a cursory two-minute cut from 2006's Shrinking Moon for You EP into a blistering, loose-limbed seven-minute sprint. Then there are the covers, which find the common threads that bind Neil Young and Serge Gainsbourg, however loosely. The two songs actually serve as good boundary markers for Wooden Shjips' usual rhythmic drone/melodic sprawl approach: at one end, buzzing stomps shot through with heat haze for ""Vampire Blues""; at the other, a fluid and sinuous motion on the pop-psych slink of ""Contact"". Good thing there's a lot of space between those two poles, since they sound best when they're at some point on that continuum. When everything sinks into the same rigid rhythm, like the band does on the solo-deficient churn of ""Outta My Head"", Wooden Shjips risk sounding like a band that's treading water instead of floating through it. It's atypical, sure-- but sometimes finding new approaches isn't necessarily more important than polishing up the one that works.","The San Francisco band issues a second set of odds and ends, demonstrating how it streamlines multiple strains of psychedelic rock.

Unfun,Jawbreaker,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a8f4c0084474cd0c0f48/1:1/w_160/24be2e11.jpg,2010-04-07 06:00:01,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14079-unfun/,Blackball,"San Francisco's Jawbreaker straddled a pivotal moment when emo was a ""core"": halfway between insult and genre, hardcore and pop, underground and mainstream. Their lyrics stressed both punk principles and emotional outpourings. Their music was furious but catchy, with a set of mannerisms that flowed smoothly into indie-rock, pop-punk, and alt-rock: palm-muted power chords laced with bright octaves and harmonics; guitar leads rounding off into whistling feedback; counter-melodic bass lines; and epic breakdowns with arty sampled monologues. They had lofty ideals, but their songs walked around on the streets, sullen and pissed, with fresh scabs and dog-eared volumes of Bukowski in their back pockets. The phrase ""emo-core"" itself is a problematic compromise between hardcore and pop-- an angst-inducing identity for a young band. Blake Schwarzenbach was 22 when Jawbreaker's 1990 debut, Unfun, came out, and this was but one of the pressures that drove him. Recriminating tunefully through a shredded throat, he calibrated himself against a punk scene and adult world of coequal injustice. Unfun was Jawbreaker's punkest record, but he feared it wasn't punk enough: ""Sorry we ain't hard enough to piss your parents off,"" he snipped on ""Incomplete"". His fretful intelligence often led him to dispense free psychological evaluations and strawman parables. There are many issues-based songs: ""Softcore"" is anti-porn, and ""Seethruskin"" is anti-racism. It gets almost Orwellian: ""Don't think that I ain't counting all the things you do,"" Schwarzenbach bristles in scene-cop mode. (He always loved those sassy ""ain'ts."") To that extent, the record earns its title. Yet the music itself is irrepressibly fun. Drummer Adam Pfahler was a fucking behemoth, a whiz with galloping toms and breathtakingly long fills. He sounds great on this low-end boosted reissue, which, on CD and download, also includes the formative Whack & Blite EP. And Schwarzenbach's prickliness was ultimately sympathetic, because it stemmed from a vulnerability he laid bare in songs like ""Want"", where dark secrets are exorcised in the name of love. ""So now you know where I come from,"" he sings, underlining it twice for emphasis: ""My secret's come undone/ My heart reveals my cause."" The world is fallen, but he's not dancing on the wreckage. He's looking for survivors, imploring on ""Busy"", ""We're all close to the end; don't you need a friend?/ Honor your allegiances!"" By 1995's major-label but still-fierce swan song, Dear You, Jawbreaker seemed wholly out of step with the scene that revered them; a broken lineage made painfully clear by the terrible cover versions modern emo bands produce. Schwarzenbach managed one pretty great album with Jets to Brazil, Orange Rhyming Dictionary, before petering out into mojo-less soft rock. With reunion and documentary rumors rumbling, Jawbreaker is primed for renewed attention, though one wonders what emo fans raised on Dashboard Confessional, Warped Tour, and Vagrant Records will make of their pinched, petulant sound. Regardless, the original music stands tall. On Unfun, Jawbreaker's conviction that punk could open up to pop while staying hardcore burns more urgently than ever, in the retrospective light of futility.","Influential San Francisco punk band's bracing 1990 debut full-length is remastered and, on digital versions, paired with the 1989 Whack & Blite EP.

The Places Between: The Best of Doves,Doves,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a91413d19756521397df/1:1/w_160/1f42e5e8.jpg,2010-04-07 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14107-the-places-between-the-best-of-doves/,EMI,"About a decade ago, the word ""angular"" was rarely heard outside of a geometry class, and this was what Mercury Prize nominations sounded like. Doves did enough anthemic rafter-reaching to honor predecessors like Oasis and the Verve. They were also studio-centric and tech-savvy enough to satisfy an OK Computer jones, while having enough British classicism for people not ready to follow Radiohead down the rabbit hole. And there were many of them, to the point where ""new Radiohead"" (ironically sounding like the old Radiohead) became one of the early new century's most briskly populated UK indie subgenres. With the possible exception of Elbow, none were better than Doves. So as The Places Between collects the best of the Doves (fortunately, it's not fooling anyone going by ""Greatest Hits""), what's striking is how little it bears to the current landscape of rock music on either side of the Atlantic. As Stuart Berman pointed out in his review of Kingdom of Dust, former opening acts like the Strokes and the Rapture both pointed the way for sounds and, more importantly, images that would ultimately make Doves seem stodgy and unsexy by comparison. Debut Lost Souls remains an enduringly consistent piece of shadowy, orchestral rock, and it could've been well represented here by any of its tracks. Despite being posed as the darkness before The Last Broadcast's light, Lost Souls gets cherrypicked for its most emphatic numbers. ""Catch the Sun"" remains the strongest melody Jimi Goodwin has ever written, while the harmonica and guitar peals of the misty ""Sea Song"" exude a low-key ecstacy. Even the stately, string-led waltz ""Man Who Told Everything"" is included as a truncated ""summer"" version. Still, ""There Goes The Fear"" might stand as their crowning achievement: seven minutes, none of them wasted, rushing forth with an undeniable freewheeling brio and a percussive outro that still stuns (unfortunately, companion piece ""Words"" and its mawkish U2-isms is included over the luminous ballad ""Satellites""). The grand, sweeping gestures of ""Caught By the River"" would be the most fittingly majestic closer of Doves' career if it weren't for the song that succeeds it on Places Between, which ends where Doves began, the ""what if Second Coming went right?"" drum barrage ""The Cedar Room"". Though Some Cities features what might be Doves' closest thing to a stateside hit (the Motown-bound ""Black and White Town""), the record itself lacked the juice of its predecessors, coinciding with a time when Coldplay loomed large and Keane broke. Kingdom of Rust was solid as well, but at this point, Doves were simply a band easy to take for granted, or even ignore. ""Andalucia"", a new song included here, tends to affirm the reasons Doves eventually opened up for Coldplay instead of the other way around-- Doves' looser rock numbers don't have enough oomph to cover for Goodwin's questionable vocal range and the band's general lack of charisma. As much as you want to view The Places Between as a triumphant document of Doves' potency, I can't help but feel a somewhat depressing sense of finality-- especially when the tracklist is so stacked toward their first two albums (nine out of the 14 previously available songs. In a weird way, it actually honors the latter two by picking far and away their best songs and reintroducing them. More likely, The Places Between is all about reintroducing Doves as a band to people who initially, wrongly wrote them off.","The former ""new Radiohead"" has their best moments-- most of them from their first two LPs-- packaged with other highlights, and the requisite new song.

New Love,Mike Swoop,by: Nate Patrin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a8d7ea9e61561daa58fa/1:1/w_160/9cf78847.jpg,2010-04-06 06:00:04,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14060-new-love/,self-released,"The sound of Minneapolis hip-hop is a study in contrasting production styles. There's ANT as veteran Rhymesayers superproducer, Heiruspecs as the Roots-analogue live band, Doomtree as the sprawling backpacker/punk collective, and dozens of crews plying everything from bring-88-back classicism to glossy electro. An up-and-coming producer specializing in an RJD2-style blend of keyboards and breaks wouldn't be considered an anomaly in this environment, but he might not stick out, either. Not that Mike Swoop's relative (and likely temporary) underexposure holds back his ambition. New Love, his self-released debut, has a distinct stylistic focus-- cratedigger-friendly 1970s soul jazz. Swoop makes up for his lack in envelope-pushing with a fine-tuned ear for classic downtempo atmosphere. You can gauge the album's musical sensibilities by picking out some of the more recognizable samples-- flourishes drawn from Fantastic Plastic Machine's psychedelic lounge synths on ""Fiend"", the same slick Gato Barbieri jazz-funk that Devin the Dude's ""She Useta Be"" mined on ""Artisan"", or a skank rhythm sourced from Steely Dan's foray into reggae on ""Spread It Thin"". But those are mostly foundations rather than the main focus of Swoop's productions. The album's persona of relaxed intensity truly thrives where his own contributions come in. Swoop builds on vinyl-sourced samples with his own multi-tracked percussion, bass, and keyboards, which form a seamless rapport with the music he takes both loops and inspiration from. The vibraphone-tinged ""Up Late"" recalls Roy Ayers at his Ubiquity-era peak, while ""Gain"" and ""On My Mind"" split the difference between Marvin Gaye's more lavish productions and the underground soul and fusion artists who followed. Even then, it's not a fastidious recreation of a faded, decades-old atmosphere; clean-cut tracks like the subtly Afrobeat-indebted ""No Go Die!"" and the cotton-candy Bernie Worrell-isms of ""No Room"" still have [#script:http://pitchfork.com/media/backend/js/tiny_mce/themes/advanced/langs/en.js]|||||| the shine of the new on them. It's compelling stuff, the kind of thing old Native Tongues fans would do themselves a favor to listen to-- and that goes double for the tracks that actually feature rapping. The artists responsible for two of the Twin Cities' best hip-hop albums of 2009 provide their own highlights, with Big Quarters' evocative daily-grind verses on ""Fiend"" and Toki Wright's psychological struggle between defeatism and survival lending gravity to the blunted sizzle of ""Let It Go"". And Kavorkian & Allpurpose, the MCs from Swoop's Diametrix crew, sound haunting over the shimmering guitars of ""Where Do We Go?"", a complementary study in late-night anxiety that proves Swoop can find the ideal beat to draw out a rapper's unique qualities. If there are more instrumental jams where this came from, Mike Swoop will have a deep, devoted following in Minneapolis for years to come. If there's a dedicated, full-length producer/MC teamup in his future, even better.","Minneapolis producer's self-released debut makes up for a lack of envelope-pushing with a fine-tuned ear for cratedigger-friendly 1970s soul jazz.

...And Then We Saw Land,Tunng,by: Andrew Gaerig,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a90e5e6ef9596932134b/1:1/w_160/a2e6bcf6.jpg,2010-04-06 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14101-and-then-we-saw-land/,Thrill JockeyFull Time Hobby,"Even factoring in the tendency for bands to grow less weird as they get older, Tunng's move toward the middle is sort of remarkable. Once a band who incorporated dusty electronics and odd instruments in sweetly bizarre folk songs, Tunng now record folk songs that are sweetly... sweet. That's an indictment, but less of one than it seems. Tunng's fourth album, ...And Then We Saw Land, contains few of the appealing crevices and pocks of their early work, but sees them developing as songwriters. It's fitting that Saw Land is coming out within weeks of reissues of albums by the Incredible String Band, another British folk band that was always weirder in concept than reality. Tunng probably never deserved the laborious mini-genres they've been tagged with, as they fit neatly in a tradition of British bands who have a slightly warped take on pastoral folk. Saw Land features stronger songwriting than the too-even Good Arrows, which in retrospect feels like a transitional album. The increased presence of Becky Jacobs' vocals further separates Saw Land from Tunng's mumble-y, bookish albums. Tunng still employ electronics, but instead of scattering them throughout the mix, here they construct gentle, noticeable grooves. ""Sashimi"", Saw Land's hookiest track, opens with a fervent acoustic guitar, one that eventually shares space with a chiming rhythmic loop. It's probably the closest Tunng have ever sounded to MOR indie rock, which might say more about the prevalence of folk and electronic elements in modern indie than it does about Tunng's transition. Saw Land moves between the gentle, accented folk-pop that has become Tunng's calling card (""Hustle"", ""Weekend Away"") and songs that seem burlier, or more obviously structured (""Don't Look Down or Back"", which features big group choruses and ornery electric guitars). This mix leaves Tunng in an awkward spot, audience-wise: they seem a bit too Grizzly Bear for the avant-folk crowd and probably too weird and British for the Grizzly Bear crowd. Only during ""The Roadside"" does the band truly find balance: Curlicues of guitar, vocals, piano, and percussion move in and out of frame. Its sounds are full and beautiful, but the structure is skewed and out of focus. ""The Roadside"" seems like something to build on, but doing so will require Tunng to move away from the more rigid structures they've adopted on their last two albums. No one should begrudge them their cleaner, smoother sound, but straight-laced songwriting has sapped the band's well-worn eccentricities. Tunng have outgrown and outlasted the restrictive genres they were once boxed into, but Saw Land struggles to find its place in a larger context.","Weirdo UK folk band gets a lot less weirdo on its latest album, sounding here like skewed pastoral groups the Beta Band and the Incredible String Band.

The Predicate (Dub Version),Savath y Savalas,by: Andrew Gaerig,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a90cb1335d7bf169941b/1:1/w_160/d02b3c9e.jpg,2010-04-06 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14099-the-predicate-dub-version/,Stones Throw,"The Predicate (Dub Version) is a remix disc loosely tied to Savath y Savalas' 2009 album La Llama. That album was chopped up, according to Stones Throw, by the Predicate Production Guild, a semi-mysterious electronic artist believed to be an alter-ego of Savath head Guillermo Scott Herren (who also goes by Prefuse 73). The Predicate sounds even cloudier and less focused than the already cloudy La Llama, with Herren removing its thin structures and leaving the remains in a worryingly unkempt mound. The Savath moniker has long been Herren's outlet for exploring Brazilian folk and psych with longtime Savath collaborator Eva Puyuelo Muns (La Llama also featured beatmaker Roberto Carlos Lange), but The Predicate doesn't sound like anything quite so well defined. Where ""La Loba"" was once a delicate, atmospheric ballad, ""La Loba Collection"" cuts and obscures the original's vocals and instrumentation, leaving only what can be described as general ambience. Sometimes, Herren takes La Llama's least evolved tracks-- such as the clanky, beatless interlude ""Pajaros En Cadaques""-- and turns them into full-fledged compositions. There are two different versions of the already collage-y ""Me Voy"" (the second, a teary eyed cinematic take, is gorgeous). The long, lumbering ""There Is No Love in Your Heart"" is a new composition, unless it's not; it can be very difficult to tell. Unfortunately, none of it sticks. The lack of boundaries-- between sounds, between songs, even between The Predicate and its source material-- doesn't do Savath's electro-folk any favors. Traditional dub edits often emphasize rhythm, but it's unclear what Herren's emphasizing on The Predicate, other than the atmospheric looseness already present on La Llama. Its best moments (""Me Voy Alone"", ""Abri.L Closed"") sound like a textured, electronic takes on the Savath sound, incorporating some of the dilapidated breakbeats and implied sexuality of Herren's Prefuse 73 work. But La Llama had already begun to incorporate some of this noisy ephemera, and so The Predicate meanders, prettily, without ever gaining a foothold.","Prefuse 73's Scott Herren remixes a Stones Throw release credited to the Predicate Production Guild-- which may also be Herren himself.

Hippies,Harlem,by: David Bevan,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a908b1335d7bf169940f/1:1/w_160/27e8acc1.jpg,2010-04-06 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14093-hippies/,Matador,"Young, emerging guitar rock bands are lately investing a lot of thought and time into ensuring that their pop music is as steeped in fuzz and scuzz as possible. Harlem are an Austin three-piece that opt out of messing with fuzz pedals and wear their grime on their sleeve instead. You might say they rub some people the wrong way. Their first record's title, Free Drugs, was punctuated with the following, ironically placed emoticon: ;-) Their band name doesn't do them any favors with the more politically correct. Their current press bio reads as though it came to its author on PCP, nonsense slapped together solely to give hapless music journalists migraines. :-( Their live set is comprised of as much on-stage, intra-band ribbing as their jukebox rock'n'roll. But they do seem to care deeply about one thing, and that's their songwriting. A garage band studied in the ways of Nuggets but clearly enamored with Pixies, they are committed to crafting bubblegum choruses flavored with booze and cigarettes. Hippies, their Matador debut, showcases just how strong that commitment is from the opening bell. On ""Someday Soon"", sometime-frontman Michael Coomer runs us through an exchange in which his friend catches fire and asks for a little help being extinguished. The pleas are ultimately declined for kicks. It's sick but singable, the Nirvana-nodding ""Torture Me"" one other deliciously dark example. Coomer shares time playing guitar and drums with co-founder Curtis O'Mara, the two halving songwriting/guitar/lead vocal duties. The split provides a duality in tenor that does the record some serious good. When Curtis is in charge, as he is during the psychotropic shimmy of ""Faces"" or Casper tribute ""Friendly Ghost"", the bent is relatively hopeful. If the strep-throated Coomer has the reins, expect thunderstorms. If Hippies has a flaw, it's only that it overstays its welcome by just a few minutes. By the time highway mood piece ""Prairie My Heart"" runs its haunting, three-minute course, it feels like an opportunity is missed to wrap things up. But then again, if you look at the way they've stacked hook on top of hook on top of hook, each so dangerously close to one another, it becomes clear that this is a singles parade more than an album. Also, ""Stripper Sunset"" jams awfully hard. It's pervy, but man does it ever jam.","A garage band as steeped in Pixies as Nuggets, Harlem's Matador debut is filled with bubblegum choruses flavored with booze and cigarettes.

New Amerykah Part Two: Return of the Ankh,Erykah Badu,by: Mike Powell,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a5575e6ef95969320aa3/1:1/w_160/b7a26543.jpg,2010-04-06 06:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14095-new-amerykah-part-two-return-of-the-ankh/,Motown,"Erykah Badu's a narcissist, but narcissism is her art. The title of her debut album, Baduizm, turned her name into a religion, a concept. On 2008's New Amerykah: Part One, she sang, ""Everything around you see/ The ankhs, the wraps, the plus degrees/ And, yes, even the mysteries-- it's all me."" It's not that she ignores the world at large, it's that she invariably draws her observations and opinions back to home base: herself, her family, her experience, her music. She and her boyfriend Jay Electronica took turns tweeting through her third pregnancy. (""I see the head, full of hair"" read one Biblically paced message.) She named the baby Mars. After Baduizm, she kept writing vocal lines and melodies but loosened her song structures to the point that her albums sounded like a series of digressions. The pose she struck on record became increasingly informal. Her final statements became ellipses. The change wasn't a drop in quality, but a shift in style. Mama's Gun and Worldwide Underground (from 2000 and 2003, respectively) are albums that, at best, sound like music that was made with no effort and very little planning. And though there's never any doubt that she's the center of attention, she started singing like she was off to the side. In its own way, Badu's music is ambient music: It drifts, ebbs, and flows. The verses don't have to hang together as long as the mood does. 2008's New Amerykah Part One was an unusually dark, hard album for her. Instead of the precedent for India.Arie, she was the echo of Sly Stone: fucked-up, long-winded, and overflowing. In her own way, Badu is always protesting something-- the way people betray themselves to be accepted by society, the way society forces people to stop being individuals-- but New Amerykah was almost like a historical re-enactment of a ""protest album"": the government is watching you, America eats its young, etc. The coffeehouse Afrocentrism of Baduizm was wiped out by producers like Madlib and Dilla, whose collage style is as forward-thinking as it is backward-looking. New Amerykah Two, by comparison, is a return to the kind of music Badu was making in 2003: relaxed, personal funk that scans more like a sketchbook than an album. Considering this album was being promised as soon as Part One came out, I can imagine someone getting pissy at the inclusion of minute-long half-thoughts like ""Agitation"" and ""You Loving Me (Session)"", but... so what? They're funny, memorable, and most importantly, they're hers. And her ability to toe the line between sounding effortless and sounding tossed-off is remarkable-- it illustrates the big, variable personality she's always claiming to have. My least favorite song here is actually the one that sounds like she's really trying: the 10-minute, multi-part ""Out My Mind, Just in Time"". Most of the lyrics here dwell on relationships, which Badu handles with a confidence and informality that most of square-ass, tax-filing society just hasn't caught up to and probably never will. (""Had two babies, different dudes,"" she sang on 2008's ""Me""-- ""and for them both my love is true."") Badu wants a window seat and nobody sitting next to her. Badu is fucking your friends and laughs about it. There's satire, too-- ""Turn Me Away (Get Munny)"", where she plays a vapid nag who just decided she really, really loves you. There's a song actually called ""Fall in Love (Your Funeral)"". But despite the breadth of attitudes toward love, there's no angst, which makes it an uplifting experience-- it's like Badu is actually convinced that life goes on. There's stuff here that is empty excess-- about three minutes of ""Love"", for example, or the drowsy instrumental ""Incense"" (basically a collaboration between Madlib and harpist Kirsten Agnesta). But for the most part I appreciate the ease of the album-- it's really the first time I feel like I'm understanding her, actually. Her art is her life, and her life-- like anyone's-- is too messy and varied to contain. Whether or not it's her responsibility to distill and make sense of it all is beside the point. To invoke Badu logic, Part Two just is what it is-- a coherent expression of a big, scattered personality.","After the fury of the stunning New Amerykah Part One, Badu returns to creating relaxed, personal funk that feels more like a sketchbook than a record.

No Rest,Christy & Emily,by: David Raposa,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a907b1335d7bf169940d/1:1/w_160/c72188e3.jpg,2010-04-05 06:00:04,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14092-no-rest/,Klangbad,"Emily Manzo is a classically trained pianist known for performing compositions by Susie Ibarra and John Cage, among others; self-taught guitarist Christy Edwards did time in various NYC indie-flavored rock combos. Despite learning how to play their instruments in different ways, Christy and Emily both approach them with a sense of experimentation and curiosity. They want to see what sorts of sounds they can make with them, how to exploit those sounds, how to make something musical from noises that seemingly sound non-musical. It's no coincidence then that for their latest album, No Rest, they chose a producer who knows a little something about exploratory shenanigans: Faust co-founder (and Klangbad co-owner) Hans Joachim Irmler. No Rest sounds best when the group serves these adventurous impulses; yet when C&E play it straight, their songs suffer. These lackluster moments often occur when focus is shifted from the music to voice and words. Both Christy and Emily have indistinct yet sweet voices that work together well. However, they're often paired with simple-to-a-fault lyrics (see the hokey folky ""Sundowners"" or the equally rustic ""Idle Hands""), which does neither them nor listeners any favors. Sometimes, the music can overcome these shortcomings, as on ""Firefly"", whose minute-plus bookends of guitar and gently descending Wurlitzer makes up for C&E's breathless vocals and repetitive lyrics. The enjoyable approximation of third-album Velvets on ""Beast"", the lovely duet between electric piano and violin on ""Guava Tree"", and the stuttering organ-like loop behind ""Kings & Monsters"" help make the wordy missteps bearable. Thankfully, C&E often create vast and evocative spaces that do the talking for them. And on their best songs, the lyrics benefit from exacting discipline. Instead of wearing a pencil down to a nub trying to find an answer to a line like, ""What if there's no fire where there's smoke"" (from ""Little World""), they simply sketch around its edges and let the listener fill in the blanks. Album closer ""Amaryllis"" is the best of these, abetting the haunting Medieval player-piano melody with quiet, amelodic guitar and fragmented lyrics. When the song returns to its more atmospheric portion, however, the contrast provided by the sped-up interlude helps to make its coda that much more unsettling. In this light, it's not surprising that they chose to cover Tom Brosseau's ""Here Comes the Water Now"". It's a charming tune that ably displays Brosseau's conversational wit, as well as his way with an arrangement. Christy & Emily simplify the already spare song even further, letting the its lyrics and melody proudly stand on their own. And while this cover serves as a fitting tribute to Brosseau's talents, it also seems to serve as a blueprint for what Christy & Emily ultimately want to achieve in their own songs. No Rest is still more uneven that one would hope, but it's a definite step in the right direction.","Classically trained pianist and self-taught indie guitarist find middle ground through a shared sense of experimentation.

Where her winsome 2007 solo debut Watch the Fireworks saw Pollock operating well within the Delgados' orchestral pop comfort zone, The Law of Large Number**s takes a more deconstructive tack, gradually breaking down the standard rock band formation to experiment with texture and rhythm, and establish a more absorbing, nocturnal atmosphere. Pollock's voice is so consistent in its matter-of-fact assertiveness that she can afford to take structural liberties without sacrificing personality. Never one to resort to maudlin sentiment or theatrical vamping to get her point across, Pollock frequently manipulates rhythm to frame her pointed portraits of relationship malaise, whether playing up the confessional tension of ""Red Orange Green"" with a metronomic tick-tock track, or illustrating the post-breakup confusion of ""The Loop"" with a flurry of vibraphone tones and harmonic vocal tics. Even when her ambition overshadows the execution, as with the gratuitous Dixieland dressing of ""Nine Lives"", Pollock still has inspiration to spare, as she eventually cuts through the song's smoky jazz bar haze with an invigorating, group-march denouement. The Law of Large Numbers is a smartly sequenced record, following a dusk-to-dawn trajectory that begins on familiar ground (""I Could Be a Saint"" boasts a grand, Delgados-worthy sing-along chorus) and descends into solitary, dead-of-night piano pieces (""House on the Hill"") before embarking on the long, lonely walk toward morning-after redemption, with the pulse of ""Chemistry Will Find Me"" charting that journey one heavy footstep at the time. The interpersonal narratives laid out over the course of Large Numbers do not culminate in a tidy, conciliatory conclusion or moment of celebration; rather, the album's open-ended quality more accurately reflects the sense of uncertainty and aimlessness we all feel in the wake of a broken relationship. That Pollock recorded this album with her husband (fellow ex-Delgado Paul Savage) only makes her strengths as a storyteller all the more apparent.","Delgados singer operates outside of her orchestral pop comfort zone, improving on her solo debut.

NonStopErotik,Black Francis,by: Joshua Klein,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a909b1335d7bf1699412/1:1/w_160/43a4decc.jpg,2010-04-05 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14097-nonstoperotik/,Cooking Vinyl,"Between 1987 and 1993, Pixies released four records and one EP that changed indie music. Between 1993 and the present, Pixies singer Black Francis (aka Frank Black, formerly Charles Thompson, now Black Francis again) has released over a dozen discs under various names and with various collaborators-- some more noteworthy than others, but none changing much of anything. Indeed, changing things hasn't seemed to be part of his agenda-- if not with his first band, then certainly not since, as his solo releases and side projects tend to look more to the past for inspiration than to the future. Not even the celebrated Pixies comeback could slow his prolific pace. In fact, he's practically doubled his output since the group reunited in the spring of '04. In February, he released a five-disc box set and book for his score to the 1920 silent film The Golem. And now, two short months later, we have NonStopErotik. Like so many of his other releases, the album was recorded quickly and ad hoc with frequent co-conspirator/producer Eric Drew Feldman. And while it won't make you forget the Pixies, some of it seems specifically designed to bring them to mind. Perhaps logically, Black Francis seems to have no qualms connecting his current output with his formative work. ""Six Legged Man"" feels like it comes from the same place as Trompe Le Monde, and the dreamy déjà vu gait of ""O My Tidy Sum"" hits a similarly comforting sweet spot (drum machine, electric piano and fake strings or no). In fact, from ""Dead Man's Curve"" to ""Lake of Sin"" to the not-quite-as-icky-as-you-might-expect ""When I Go Down On You"", few songwriters are as adept at deviously slipping as many changes into relatively concise songs without calling attention to their tricks. It's a stealth trademark: instantly recognizable when you hear it but harder than you think to replicate. Yet even when Black plays it straight, the results still sometimes skew. If the younger Black Francis might have transformed a cover of the Flying Burrito Brothers' ""Wheels"" into a cool surf epic [#script:http://pitchfork.com/media/backend/js/tiny_mce/themes/advanced/langs/en.js]|||||| rather than a Velvet Underground-inspired reconstruction, the elder delivers an intriguing mix of vitality and cool detachment. It's easy to take those seemingly at-odds qualities for granted, but here Black Francis sounds not just comfortable with that aesthetic but surprisingly and paradoxically in control of it as well.","Pixies singer and guitarist continues his prolific solo career, again connecting his current output with his formative work.

I Learned the Hard Way,Sharon Jones and the Dap-Kings,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a8feea9e61561daa5959/1:1/w_160/520b9c8b.jpg,2010-04-05 06:00:01,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14085-i-learned-the-hard-way/,Daptone,"Sharon Jones and the Dap-Kings are the rarest type of retro/revivalist band-- the type that transcends its devotion to a style of music associated with a distant past. They make soul music in the classic sense, the kind of tracks that might have been laid down in Memphis, Muscle Shoals, Detroit, Philadelphia, or Chicago in the late 1960s and early 70s. But there's more to their sound than a nostalgia trip-- it's an affirmation of the validity of working in specific styles, even ones most people stopped exploring decades ago. The Dap-Kings succeed through attention to detail. While a lot of music makes aesthetic or stylistic nods to 60s, almost none of it actually captures the sonic character of the era. But on each of their albums, Jones and her collaborators, led by Gabriel Roth, have done just that. And it doesn't just come down to the production and placement of the microphones. Jones deserves the most credit, simply for having an amazing voice that she understands how to wield effectively. Her impeccable sense of delivery balances power with nuance, varying her forcefulness for maximum impact. The songs give her plenty of room to move, too-- if these tracks weren't every bit as good as the ones that inspired them, all of the performance and production acumen in the world couldn't save them. As rote as it sounds, ""Better Things"" and ""The Game Gets Old"", among others on I Learned the Hard Way, would likely be classics today if they'd been released alongside the music that influenced them. In fact, they may yet become classics to a smaller, more niche audience today. ""Better Things"" in particular is incredible, a brilliant kiss-off in which Jones reveals layers of anguish beneath her anger, while the band supports her with a heavy Muscle Shoals-style groove. It's striking to listen back to the very basic pastiche of the band's first album and see how far they've come, exploring different corners of funk and soul, experimenting with different meters and very complex arrangements. The trumpet in the intro to ""Better Things"" plays around with the vocal melody with a jazzy slyness that hits even harder when Jones follows it up by taking it over. Elsewhere, the horns and stormy backing track on ""Money"" save it from being a pretty typical soul rumination on being down and out, while Jones grabs the surfish guitar and bounding beat of ""She Ain't a Child No More"" and runs with them, delivering a commanding vocal to which her bandmates dutifully respond. It all comes together to make an album that stands up as a varied and well-sequenced work, and as a collection of songs you can scatter through a shuffle and dig just as deeply. It's nice to hear the band really stretch themselves and develop the drama and tumult of songs like ""I'll Still Be True"" and ""The Game Gets Old"", which you can really hear the band putting its creative all the way into. This record hardly needs to be recommended to soul fans, but even if revisitations of older music styles aren't usually your thing, I Learned the Hard Way is worth digging up.","The latest from these funk/soul throwbacks further affirms the validity of working in specific styles, even ones most people stopped exploring decades ago.

Go,Jónsi,by: Ryan Dombal,Features Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a90bea9e61561daa5973/1:1/w_160/4451f812.jpg,2010-04-05 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14098-go/,XL,"Jónsi Birgisson doesn't do small. As the lead singer of Sigur Rós, he's starred in several of this century's most epic songs; with their penchant for instrumental swells, feedback, and weight-of-humanity wails, the Icelandic band has practically set a new, near unreachable height for melodramatic art rock. But after perfecting this style on 2005's Takk, Jónsi and his mates have had some trouble finding a way out from beneath the burden of big. Their last album, 2008's Með suð í eyrum við spilum endalaust, tried to temper the bombast but occasionally got bogged down in aimless balladry. Jónsi's subsequent Riceboy Sleeps LP with Alex Somers offered largely voiceless ambiance, akin to Quentin Tarantino directing a silent chamber drama. But with his solo debut, Jónsi fights huge with huger. Helping to realize the mini symphonies in the singer's head are two key collaborators: pianist, composer, and arranger Nico Muhly-- who has become the de facto solution for artists like Grizzly Bear and Antony and the Johnsons when in need of unique, showy flourishes-- and Finnish percussionist Samuli Kosminen, who can be seen literally banging on old suitcases in an in-studio video on Jónsi's website. The conspirators balance well; though Muhly's manicured arrangements could have come off stiff in this context, their combination with Kosminen's unbridled wallops brings the orchestration dizzily whirling forth. But what truly elevates Go is Jónsi's voice, which still has the ability to stun a decade after Agætis Byrjun introduced most listeners to his alien bleats. Along with Jeff Buckley and Thom Yorke, Jónsi's pipes have set the standard for modern eunuch-like crooning. And on Go, he makes up for the lack of vocals on Riceboy Sleeps by working overtime, backing himself up to create a Jónsi choir, offering skyrocketing counter-melodies, and even making the occasional bird sound. He beams ecstatically on ""Go Do"", cracks hearts on the string-laden ""Sinking Friendships"", and comes as close as he probably ever will to rapping on ""Animal Arithmetic"". He may lack Buckley's soulfulness or Yorke's infinite melancholy, but Jónsi's distinguishing trait is an innocence that helps make emotions sound fresh. This child-like view is more apparent on Go because it finds the singer mostly expressing himself in plain English rather than his usual combination of heavenly vowel sounds and Icelandic. On the surface, the language breakthrough is irrelevant; whatever you thought he was singing about before is probably close to what he's singing about in English here. For instance, the hook on ""Go Do"" goes, ""We should always know that we can do anything."" Of course it's corny, but Jónsi's sincere intent makes the feel-good anthem feel good. Images of nature come up often, which makes sense considering his gale force lungs. Even when he comes close to ""Legend of Zelda"" territory, like when he sings of ""a treasure chest full of labyrinths"" on ""Around Us"", his committment and wide-eyed naivety go a long way. In Jónsi's universe, cynicism has yet to be invented. Much of Go matches the uplift of Sigur Rós at their most dramatic. There's more sonic density here than ever-- Go's cacophony of flutes, piano, horns, strings, and bird calls beg for a 5.1 mix. At the same time, the songwriting is pruned down. The usual crescendos spring up in condensed bursts, rather than being spread out over seven minutes. And Jónsi seems to be getting less murky and moody as he collects years. Still, Go isn't pure escapist Peter Pan theater. ""No one knows you 'til it's over,"" he yowls on ""Sinking Friendships"", ""you know no one true 'til it's over."" For Jónsi, life and death are spoken in mythic, uncompromising terms. There's not much room for the little things, which is partly why he's able to strike hard around the world; whether singing in English or jibberish, the message is clear. Go means go.","The Sigur Rós singer fights huge with huger on his solo debut, matching the uplift of his full-time band at their most dramatic.

Future Factory,The Society of Rockets,by: Matthew Perpetua,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a900c0084474cd0c0f61/1:1/w_160/2d161b09.jpg,2010-04-02 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14087-future-factory/,Three Ring,"The Society of Rockets, a psychedelic pop band from San Francisco, have been around since the mid-1990s, quietly building a deep discography while almost entirely removed from the larger indie rock community. Their obscurity is at least somewhat deliberate. In all this time, they have not toured or participated in any typical promotional activity, preferring to pour their creative energy into ambitious studio recordings. The group is led by singer and primary songwriter Joshua Babcock, a man with a seemingly endless appetite for old-school psychedelia, science fiction, and head shop ephemera. Babcock's best compositions blur the lines between many strains of 1960s and 70s pop and exotica, coming together on albums that sound like either an alternate version of the past, or an older version of the future. Up until 2003, the Society was known as the Shimmer Kids Underpop Association. The core personnel remained mostly the same, but the tone of the band's music changed, or at least it did for their first two releases under the name. Whereas the Shimmer Kids records had a bright, poppy tone characterized by Beach Boys harmonies and whirring theremin, the initial Society of Rockets albums were slower and more subdued. They were going for a sort of spacey country-rock thing, but ended up with tunes that felt flat and listless compared to the colorful whimsy of their older material. Their 2007 album Our Paths Related was more interesting, but their experiments with hard psyche grooves and funky horn flourishes were a poor fit for Babcock's reedy voice. Thankfully, their latest record is a return to form. Future Factory sprawls out over four vinyl sides-- it's not being released on CD-- and finds Babcock and his collaborators reclaiming the sunny ba-da-ba tunefulness of their early days while successfully integrating elements from krautrock and bossa nova. The album sequence is punctuated with interstitial song fragments that shift mood, provide texture, and capture brief moments of inspiration that require no further elaboration. At just under an hour, it's generous but not overlong, and its restless spirit and variety of tones keep the music from falling into the samey ruts of previous Society of Rockets releases. The group sound genuinely thrilled and engaged by these songs, and that spark results in some of the finest recordings of the band's overall history. ""Circulate and Sing"" and ""I Am a Battery"" blend chiming British Invasion chords with delirious, hazy synthesizers. ""We"" recalls early Stereolab with its super-charged motorik groove, while ""The Great Experiment"" brings to mind that band's later excursions into zoned-out polyrhythmic lounge pop. ""Guess My Name"" nods in the direction of Hall & Oates smooth, R&B-inflected studio pop without a hint of kitschiness, while ""Blowout Chief"" is reminiscent of Guided By Voices in their mid-90s heyday. It's a pile-up of scattered influences and recycled ideas to be sure, but the execution is distinct. After years of seeming to chase after some kind of artistic growth, Babcock and his band have made the best album of their career by letting loose and playing to their strengths.","Ambitious, under-the-radar indie rock band returns to form blending Brit Invasion pop with elements of Krautrock and bossa nova.

Outbursts,Turin Brakes,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a90113d19756521397b9/1:1/w_160/92e8801e.jpg,2010-04-02 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14091-outbursts/,Cooking Vinyl,"If you spent the previous decade keeping up with a wimpier stripe of UK rock music, 2010 is shaping up to be a hell of a year-- by May, we'll have already seen new albums from Badly Drawn Boy, Tom McRae, Athlete, and Keane. So I suppose it's as appropriate a time as any for early 2000s hype and Take That ghostwriters Turin Brakes to reintroduce themselves. The self-released Outbursts mostly operates on a scale reminiscent of their humble beginnings-- frantically strummed acoustics, dewy lead guitar, close harmonies, and an occasional spit shine of synthesizer. Weirdly though it's actually as unsettling as the new Liars album. Not sonically-- it's nobody's idea of edgy; yet thanks to Olly Knight's lyrics, the listener is perpetually wondering whether he can make it through the next 10 seconds without saying something stupid. The list of Knights' clunkers is long and distinguished and he honors tradition here, never failing to pockmark perfectly decent folk-rock with anti-quotables that pop up with even greater frequency than in the past-- the longing slide guitar and sparkling major-7th chords of ""Paper Heart"" give way to Knights testing the limits of to what ""paper"" can be applied as an adjective (worlds, girls, boys, toys) and dropping knowledge like ""I live by the sea/ Not the one you're thinking / The sea inside of me."" ""Rocket Song"" goes for the endlessly skyward grandiosity of Jeff Buckley's ""Hallelujah"" and comes up with ""You're a bruise upon the brain/ I lay my cards down on the grain/ Slowly bursting into flame/ Then you leave me smoking in the rain."" ""The Invitation"" creeps on the kind of kenning, baroque chord progression used in Radiohead's piano ballads, but stumbles over pick-up lines lke ""I hail from an old-fashioned dream/ I'm outside your window making a scene."" At one point he says he's the ""ruler of this Internet."" I have no idea what that means. Maybe I should consult Paul Wall. Opening salvo ""Sea Change"" warns of a non-specific danger that has ""six billion backs against the wall"" and its final-countdown lyric is actually somewhat cleverly constructed. But then they flesh out the mix with incompatible disco strings and bongos that go for that ""funky mixed meter"" vibe and just end up sounding hilariously off-beat. Nothing on Outbursts turns out to overblown sonically, but ""Sea Change"" does signal a straining quality that runs throughout the album. Past highlights like ""Underdog"" and ""Future Boy"" hinted at a sense of humor and scrappy charm; yet no matter how stripped down or underwritten they sound these days, Turin Brakes still always come off like they're actually really trying, which is the saddest part about it.","It's the return of Turin Brakes, back with more dewy lead guitar and dewy lyrics.

Triangulation,Scuba,by: Andrew Gaerig,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a8f2c0084474cd0c0f44/1:1/w_160/1df971ab.jpg,2010-04-02 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14076-triangulation/,Hotflush,"When the numerous permutations of dubstep are discussed, Paul Rose (Scuba) is usually credited with steering the genre toward softer, more musical arrangements. Scuba has done this both through his own work and through his stewardship of the almost bulletproof Hotflush label, home to 2009's nominally dubstep breakouts by Mount Kimbie and Joy Orbison. On Triangulation, Scuba continues his label's thrilling run with a proper full-length of fluid, melodic dubstep that sounds beautiful and aggressive in equal measure. If Scuba's name doesn't resonate quite like those of his labelmates, it's likely because through one full-length (2008's A Mutual Antipathy) and an armful of singles, Scuba has yet to stumble into one breakout track (his remix of his own ""Hard Boiled"", under his SCB moniker, came closest). Scuba tracks tend to fall into one of two camps: bass-heavy thumpers or slow, melodic cut-ups that often sound like dubstep's version of a ballad. Scuba's dance numbers have a tendency to lie in the weeds and lurk; where a song like ""Hyph Mngo"" sounds like a siren, Scuba's are the glue that hold a mix together. (See: DJ /rupture subtly weaving Scuba's ""Braille Diving"" into the second half of Uproot.) This seamless construction defines Triangulation. What Scuba lacks as a dance hit-maker he makes up for with careful pacing and an ever-present tension between dark, tech-y sounds and inviting melodicism. These sorts of daring sleight-of-hand tricks are Scuba's specialty. ""Before"" sounds like Boards of Canada covering modern R&B, and it leads into ""Tracers"", a pounding, industrial-strength romp. ""So You Think You're Special"" plasters an echoing, hopeful loop (""Here you'll find the one/ Here in the sun"") over ominous, pulsing bass. It's not a comedown so much as club music for those who never make it out of the apartment. Had ""dubstep"" never entered the lexicon, it would be easy enough to label Triangulation house music, but without the implied build-ups or ecstasy. Triangulation ultimately falls into the dubstep camp because of its mood and temperament. By expertly juxtaposing the dark with the romantic, the hectic with the serene, Scuba's produced a triumphant, balanced album. It's also one that can feel too well adjusted. It's easy to hear parts of Triangulation as clay for bridging DJ sets or potent source material for remixers. But Triangulation is also worthy of attention in its own right, a cohesive record whose complications lurk just under its surface.","The steward of the almost bulletproof Hotflush label, home to nominally dubstep breakouts by Mount Kimbie and Joy Orbison, issues his excellent second LP.

I Speak Because I Can,Laura Marling,by: Joshua Love,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a8f0c0084474cd0c0f42/1:1/w_160/80d55f73.jpg,2010-04-02 06:00:01,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14075-i-speak-because-i-can/,AstralwerksVirgin,"Reviewing Laura Marling's Mercury Prize-nominated debut album, Alas, I Cannot Swim, in 2008, I worried that the then-18-year-old might too quickly shed the teenage guilelessness that contributed so greatly to the record's appeal. Marling possessed an undeniable knack for writing about young love with directness and authentic feeling, but at times her pseudo-profound poetics suggested the young folkie was in too much of a hurry to be a serious adult. Clearly, I significantly underestimated Laura Marling's capabilities. Her sophomore effort, I Speak Because I Can, finds Marling, still only 20, shrugging off virtually all traces of girlishness and wide-eyed charm, instead delving into darkly elemental, frequently morbid folk. And yet, astonishingly, the expected growing pains never come. To say Marling evinces wisdom beyond her years on I Speak would be a criminal understatement, considering she's created a haunting, fully flowered gem of an album despite being younger than two-thirds of the Jonas Brothers. These are folk-rock songs, but Marling doesn't lazily trade on it like so many other would-be old souls. Instead, like Fairport Convention or Nick Cave or Cat Power, she uses folk as an archetypal form to get at the essential realities of love, sex, heartbreak, and death. Sometimes she does it with heart-stopping quietness, her voice dropping to conversational tones on ""Made by Maid"" and ""What He Wrote"". Just as often, Marling sets her allegories to raucous musical accompaniment, an especially impressive feat considering the calm of her debut. The bluesy jig of opener and first single ""Devil's Spoke"" might elicit a few less-than-ideal comparisons with KT Tunstall, but Marling blows that kind of politely insistent stuff out of the water on the soaring, thunderous ""Rambling Man"" and the gypsy-ish breakdown of ""Alpha Shallows"" (which makes up for that song's momentary slip into sub-Dylan poetic doggerel). It would have been all too easy for an album like this, so grimly fixated and coming from someone of such tender age, to be written off as the work of a morose young Romantic. However, Marling seems to have a great deal of self-awareness of her melancholic bent, lightly skewering herself on ""Goodbye England (Covered in Snow)"" for writing an ""epic letter"" to an estranged lover that's ""22 pages front and back/ But it's too good to be used."" And yet, she's not playing dress-up. She's a wholly developed artist in full command of gifts that may not yet be finished arriving.","Just out of her teens, promising UK songwriter starts to come into her own on her second album, a top five success in her home country.

Few hearts could. So begins The Wonder Show of the World, the Kentucky sage's first tandem outing with guitarist/Cairo Gang chief Emmett Kelly. Historically, the former has always displayed wolverine instincts when it comes to selecting creative partners, and this is no exception. In addition to beautiful contributions on both The Letting Go and Lie Down in the Light, Kelly's furnished a sturdy CV exploring folk music's boundaries on his own. As a pair, Kelly and Oldham are a very natural fit. Amongst the shadows and amber, ambient hook of ""Troublesome Houses"", his voice and Oldham's fold into one another like lovers. The rest of their trip is as inviting as that first step. The Wonder Show of the World is a perfectly titled look at the ways in which we all tangle ourselves up with one another-- as friends, fathers, mothers, daughters, wives, husbands, and on and on. All of Oldham's takes on love and companionship here are worth the price of admission, but what makes the album really stick is the way each tale is mirrored by its sonics. Spontaneity still being Oldham's jam, this is a clear move away from the country-based records of recent years, and this record's much more about space and on-tape interaction than it is any strain of American sound. Whether the arrangement is full-bodied or spare, upended folk or gospel, you can really sense that these two are reacting to one another as though the song's coming to them for the very first time. Kelly's guitar work here spans a long list of genres, gathering ingredients from blues, jazz, country, and Spanish guitar. And no matter the flavor, Kelly does well to buttress Oldham's zigs and zags, never overwhelming any of his verses. He just lets him do his thing and vice versa. This is arguably Oldham's most austere record to date, but there's much to dig into. From the aforementioned opener onward, the first half is quiet fire. In ""Teach Me to Bear You"", Oldham gets down on his knees and begs for honest answers from a woman, combining with Kelly for some gorgeous church vocals before the latter tears open a blues solo that'd make John Mayer sweat. Much less direct, ""With Cornstalks or Among Them"" is a rapturous, reverb-y showcase for Oldham's singing voice, which has only continued to evolve along with his eye for erotic detail. On ""The Sounds Are Always Begging"", Oldham awakes to his wife chopping up their bed, his dick too hard for him to be scared. That line's inclusion feels like a total put-on, but the album's most memorable doesn't at all: During the ""That's What Our Love Is"", a seven-minute centerpiece, Oldham wails to his lover that the smell of her ""box"" is still on his mustache. It's as intimate and daring a note as any songwriter could make, the kind of observation that leaves you slackjawed. But not just because it throws your balance or because he isn't Lil Wayne, but because few songwriters feel so comfortable going there. In full, this outing feels as close to that sentiment as any. Not just comfortable-- honest.","Will Oldham pairs with guitarist/Cairo Gang chief Emmett Kelly to explore how we tangle ourselves with each other-- as friends, parents, children, spouses.

The end result is a cataloging of the fear and morbidity-- as well as the strange peacefulness and hope-- that permeates the sterile air of waiting rooms and ICUs. Sometimes they accomplish it by delivering a hardline narrative; sometimes by allowing the sheer melodrama of these fractured takes on anthemic ambient and shoegaze to do the heavy lifting. Machines That Listen occasionally suffers at the hands of it's own theatricality, but there's also a great deal of rich, real-life drama to latch onto here. Ex-hip-hoppers David Bolt and Craig Gordon (plus bassist Karrie K) clearly have a keen eye for the histrionic, offering vivid peeks into the lives of the characters that haunt the record, from a parting bedside moment between a husband and wife on ""And the Radio Played On"" to the disquieting experience of the waiting room on ""A Room for Waiting"". But where these little vignettes often falter, the Delta Mirror have the good sense to reinforce the storytelling with interesting soundscapes. Often taking a flood of lush melodies and dense tones and augmenting them with craggly electronics, undulating bass lines, and soft thuds and ticks, it's the music that shoulders most of the sentimental heft. Celestial opener ""It Was Dark and I Welcome the Calm"" and highlight ""We Got It All"" help better to conceptualize the hospital's blend of the ominous and the peaceful. Despite its heart, the music is so mechanized (save for the occasional piano suite), right down to its title. Machines That Listen suggest that these stories are somehow being translated by the machines themselves (though thankfully never going so far as to insert, say, the sounds of an EKG machine), with each disconnected stutter or pained guitar yowl inching closer to something innately organic. Often fogging the human vocals, this android-like device also gives the album's stories a new shape. But whatever the read, Machines That Listen is a patient, layered piece that offers a deeply romantic-- and occasionally oddly reaffirming-- take on experiences often written off as purely antiseptic.","The Delta Mirror's debut for Lefse works from an unusual concept: Each of its nine tracks takes place in a different room of a hospital.

More importantly, each project that sprang up in the band's orbit and wake-- including Loftus, Califone, Orso, and Sin Ropas, as well as a lot of Brian Deck's production work-- carried on and expanded the band's aesthetic, making it a major part of the Chicago sound over the past decade. So Red Red Meat didn't so much die as fractalize. Sin Ropas, the project of former Red Red Meat bassist Tim Hurley, hasn't been as prolific as Califone, to which Hurley sometimes contributes, but their four albums have written interesting twists into Red Red Meat's noisy Americana legacy. Holy Broken comes five years after the band's third album, Fire Prizes, a record that sometimes sank under the weight of its own noisiness and strangely was a vinyl-only release in the U.S. Hurley and his primary partner in Sin Ropas, percussionist/multi-instrumentalist Danni Iosello, have come back from that break with their most direct and immediate album yet. That's not to say they've made a pop record-- this is still fuzzy indie rock that mixes noisier elements with acoustic folk instruments-- but they have left behind the long, slow, sludgy tracks of Fire Prizes for higher tempos, shorter songs, and brighter textures. Outside of Hurley's overdriven guitar, one of the most prominent sounds on the album is the wordless two-part harmonies of Hurley and Iosello. Whether cutting through a grungy guitar buzzsaw or gently interacting with acoustic guitar, quiet organ, and wandering banjo, their harmonies are oddly consistent. Their sweetness also serves as a foil for Hurley's dusty croon on the lead vocals, which works well in the context of the band's sound, but nowhere better than on album opener ""The Fever You Fake"", a thick rocker built on a teetering fuzz riff that's spiked with candy-colored piano and the occasional counterintuitive solo. One knock against the band is that their exceedingly basic vocal melodies tend to blur together, relying on the instrumental arrangements to differentiate them. That doesn't always work, but even on some of the slower, less dynamic songs that pad out the album, the band's sonic signature is strong. Holy Broken rests comfortably alongside Trick Boxes on the Pony Line among the best Sin Ropas releases and keeps a band that seemingly had faded away in the post-Red Red Meat conversation.","The project of former Red Red Meat bassist Tim Hurley continues writing interesting twists into his former band's noisy Americana legacy.

Our Inventions,Lali Puna,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a8e35e6ef959693212ec/1:1/w_160/a3c4154b.jpg,2010-04-01 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14041-our-inventions/,Morr,"Morr Music didn't invent indie-infused electro-pop, but the German label put an indelible stamp on it over the last decade. Three of its definitive bands-- the Notwist, Tied & Tickled Trio, and Lali Puna-- share members, not to mention a knack for emotive electro-acoustic melodies. But each band has its own angle. The Notwist go for the broadest appeal, and tend to hit big or mildly miss. T&T is the most obscure, in both style and profile. Lali Puna is the most polished and consistent. Their music is reserved, in a way that seems old-fashioned: more like Stereolab in the 1990s than the demonstrative electro-pop of today. Lali Puna's first album in five years dials down the guitar from Faking the Books, although it's still there, along with live drums, creating an organic undertone. The music is sophisticated and low-impact, and makes you marvel that Lali Puna is ever described as an experimental band. That must come from their judicious use of vocal effects, like the shivering ""ohs"" looped on ""Remember"" and the underwater distortion of ""Everything Is Always"". But really, they never use any gestures that aren't entrenched in pop's vocabulary. The occasional skipping-record synths or trip-hop beats aren't cracking any heads open in 2010 either. They don't intend to. Instead, the electronic interventions strengthen the effortless-feeling melodies. But there is something internal about Our Inventions. Valerie Trebeljahr's lyrics are well-turned and unobtrusive; they register and instantly dissolve. Paired with her unornamented vocal style, she blends seamlessly into her surroundings; her voice carries the same impact as the warm chord or tidy tone pattern idling beside it. The arrangements stick to an effective coast-and-surge model of development: The tracks skim low and then tilt upward with the addition of a drum or synth part. It's a stock trick that works well, and Lali Puna use it with unusual tact. They gently float up, drift down again, always arriving at the same coolly appealing place, regardless of whether they've loaded their framework with blown-out bass, IDM garbles, or tuned metal plinks. Large portions of songs by similar acts such as Stars, Au Revoir Simone, and Alaska in Winter can seem to exist solely to set up the big, memorable drop. Lali Puna are just as approachable, but less ingratiating. As a result, every moment matters, which has a curiously muting effect: No individual moment seems to matter especially much.","On its first album in five years, the German electro-pop band that includes Markus Acher from the Notwist continues to refine its icy style.

Black Tambourine,Black Tambourine,by: Stuart Berman,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a8efc0084474cd0c0f3e/1:1/w_160/b4319a2a.jpg,2010-04-01 06:00:01,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14074-black-tambourine/,Slumberland,"""If there's any justice, Black Tambourine will see their name inserted into revisionist histories of American independent rock."" So wrote Pitchfork's Chris Ott in his April 1999 review of Black Tambourine's Complete Recordings, and at the time, the line sounded like wishful thinking. After all, that compilation of the Washington, D.C. band's brief, brilliant career didn't surface at the most opportune time for a reassessment, given pre-millennial indie rock's aesthetic drift away from fuzz-covered slop-pop toward exploratory instrumentals (Tortoise, Mogwai) and folky formalism (Belle and Sebastian, Elliott Smith). But the arrival of this reissue of that reissue-- which supplements the Complete Recordings tracklist with two demos and four unearthed tracks-- confirms that revisionist history is now real. Not only does it mark the 20th anniversaries of the band and its Slumberland imprint, but also the renewed ubiquity of Black Tambourine's sound in certain contemporary indie pop circles. And yet even with their emergent iconic status, it's hard to say if Black Tambourine were ahead of their time or simply out of place. The music they created was novel not necessarily for its era-- forming in 1989, they essentially modeled themselves on the girl-group/post-punk collision instigated by the Jesus and Mary Chain and the C86 set-- but its point of origin, making them anomalies in a D.C. scene very much beholden to Dischord-schooled hardcore. Their history thus mirrors that of cult touchstones ranging from mid-60s Nuggets bands to Big Star: American Anglophiles operating in relative isolation, translating their out-of-step influences into flashes of inspired songcraft before quickly flaming out in a sigh of indifference, only to be survived by future generations of record-collecting converts. If the 20-year-old songs compiled on Black Tambourine still sound strikingly contemporary, it probably has less to do with the band's own foresight and more to do with modern indie's retreat into lo-fi insularity. But so long as timid young rock bands choose to hide their innermost emotions behind a foggy veil of feedback, songs like the urgently despairing ""For Ex-Lovers Only"", the hypnotically propulsive ""By Tomorrow"", and the giddily expressed girlfriend murder fantasy ""Throw Aggi Off the Bridge"" will forever stand as paragons of the form. That Complete Recordings has long gone out of print makes Black Tambourine an essential acquisition for current In the Red, Woodsist, and Slumberland loyalists. And even for old-school adherents, the bonus tracks included warrant a repurchase. Never mind the demos for ""Ex-Lovers"" and ""Aggi"", which merely present these already crudely rendered songs in more severe states of tape decay. The four previously unreleased tracks-- new recordings by the original line-up of old, undocumented set-list standards-- fit seamlessly alongside the vintage material both in terms of quality and fidelity: a pair of upbeat distorto-pop jaunts (""Lazy Heart"", ""Tears of Joy"") as immediately engaging as anything in their canon, plus raucous but reverential covers of Buddy Holly (""Heart Beat"") and Suicide (""Dream Baby Dream"") that map out the pop/drone polarities of Black Tambourine's sound world. For a band whose legend was initially built on two officially released singles, these quality extras should be more than enough to see us through to the 2030 reunion tour.","Black Tambourine's sound is all over the contemporary lo-fi scene, and this reissue shows why it has endured.

Sisterworld Reinterpretations,Liars,by: Jess Harvell,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a8f89d034d5c69bf3b8c/1:1/w_160/95f0b603.jpg,2010-04-01 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14082-sisterworld-reinterpretations/,Mute,"This record is a bummer. And that's not just burnout talking, the after-effects of one too many crappy ""all-star"" remix compilations designed to part fans from their money. Sisterworld Reinterpretations is not some cash-grab. Liars aren't that kind of band. Their music is already a fevered mash of disparate genres, perfect source material for ruthless remixing. Reinterpretations assembles arena rock celebs and art-rock lifers, weirdo club kids and zonked folkies. And Liars presumably instructed these peers, pals, and heroes to attack their music with gusto. So why do the results sound so limp? The main problem is that few of these remixers seem to understand what makes Liars' music interesting in the first place. Sisterworld is an album of opposites: Brutal and weirdly tender. Pastoral and industrial. Musical and damn near unlistenable. It revels in good old fashioned tension and release, playing those opposites against one another, often within the same song. But the majority of these remixes flatten the tension and forget the release entirely. They limp (Kazu Makino) and skitter (Thom Yorke) and drone (Boyd Rice) along for three or four or five minutes. And then they end. Way too many tracks are content to float along, inoffensively, recycling familiar sounds-- the pretty textures of ambient or the ugliness of free-form noise. They turn some of the most bracingly physical rock of the year into avant background music. Liars are certainly in love with sound and texture, the kind of otherworldly atmosphere you can create only in the studio. But stripped back to nothing but atmosphere-- without Liars' love for the heavy rhythms and metal guitars-- Sisterworld becomes as commonplace and dismissible as any second-rate ambient album or half-hearted noise performance. In the case of, say, Melvins, this seems like missing the point to a perverse degree. Imagine the ass-flattening potential of a true Buzzo/Crover assault on the Liars' catalog. Instead we get plinks and plonks and feedback splutters and cheesy tape effects. The overall lack of effort on display is all the more disheartening given the general talent level involved. Tunde Adebimpe's cover (not remix) of ""Scarecrows on a Killer Slant"" sounds like a demo in preparation for a (hopefully better) full-band version: dull arrangement, sketchy backing track, lazy singing from a master. The lack of energy is almost startling when you compare it to the original, Sisterworld's most violent song. So, yes, most of Reinterpretations can be painlessly deleted. But it'd be foolish to toss out the bright spots out with the murky bathwater-- Atlas Sound's shimmering, Steve Reich-ish take on ""Here Comes All the People"" springs to mind. Reinterpretations' inconsistency is another reason to thank your god of choice for the 30-second MP3 preview, still the cherry-picking downloader's best friend.","Liars' bracingly physical rock is given the remix/covers treatment by Thom Yorke, TV on the Radio's Tunde Adebimpe, and Atlas Sound, among others.

Evoking the feral angst of button-pushers like the Blood Brothers and more notably proggy acts like At the Drive-In and Coheed and Cambria, Native don't move too far in either direction. So Wrestling Moves, their debut LP, is gussied up to sound more epic than it actually is. While it occasionally hits a stride with an invigorating surge of punked-up thrash, more often the album is it nullified with arbitrary transitions and tempo shifts that leave Native with too much space and little to fill it with. It's pointless to talk about individual tracks here, since there is so little distinction between them. While the approach may have meant to create a uniform sound for the record, there's a difference between trying to establish a thread and making it nearly impossible to tell one cut from the other. Each squall of anxiety-ridden, teenage disquietude as embodied in lead singer's Bobby Markos' shredded screech is always followed with a tempo change that leaves the song feeling sprawled-out and motionless, colored only by a limp toss of a few pallid guitar melodies into the mix. Instead of building and releasing structures or employing a memorable hook, the band simply moves back and forth between these two points for the entirety of the album. A few cuts apply some interesting ambient guitar interplay, but there's very little divergence throughout. Native show some potential. These Arms Are Snakes drummer Chris Common nicely handles production duties, and wisely anchors most of the material around drummer Nick Glassen, who sometimes is able to save otherwise bland retreads with terse syncopations. But Wrestling Moves winds up feeling inert, suggesting that Native might have only one move after all.","Indiana post-hardcore band with proggy leanings release their debut full-length.

Endless Falls,Loscil,by: Joe Colly,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a8ee13d1975652139790/1:1/w_160/ef218e0a.jpg,2010-03-31 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14077-endless-falls/,Kranky,"You could reasonably argue that all ambient music seeks in some way to lull its listener into a meditative haze, and some artists pursue this feeling more directly than others. Scott Morgan is one of those guys. Unlike Tim Hecker or Pantha du Prince, who draw from more intricate arrangements, Morgan lays his sounds bare and lets them go right to work. Recording as Loscil since the early 2000s, he's built an impressive catalogue of pensive, minimal records that turn computerized sounds into something strangely soothing-- the kind of music you want to listen to flat on your back, eyes fixed at the ceiling. While each of his records is at least good, it started to feel by 2006's Plume like Morgan had reached a creative plateau. His latest effort, Endless Falls, breathes some new life into the Loscil project. Not so much a departure but a natural progression of what he cooked up with early albums Triple Point and Submers, the record is again a concept piece. At its most basic, the idea here is that Endless Falls is a rainy-day album, overcast but cozy, and there's an aquatic theme that extends to its cover art and the rain-droplet field recordings that bookend the record. Morgan plays with the idea of water-as-sound throughout and pulls it off in appealing ways. ""Shallow Water Blackout"" is kind of liquid headphone music that swooshes from ear to ear, and the very good ""Dub for Cascadia"" is, as you might expect, an exercise in deeply submerged, underwater dub. Sometimes conceptual ambient albums can feel a bit forced-- Klimek's recent film-centric Movies Is Magic comes to mind-- but here the theme works hand-in-hand with the music. Morgan breaks with the concept for the final track, though, for one of the album's most interesting moments. ""The Making of Grief Point"" is a spoken-word piece featuring Destroyer's Dan Bejar (Morgan also plays drums in that band) about the struggles of the creative process. Bejar's voice comes as a shock after 50 some-odd minutes of gentle atmospherics, and he speaks about feeling conflicted and confused about making art. ""I have lost interest in music"", he says. ""It is horrible."" It's very a strange way to close out an album like this, but confident, I think, to punctuate it so forcefully. You're at ease for a time and then yanked back into the real world-- don't all good records end like that?","Ambient vet Scott Morgan breathes new life into the Loscil project, playing with the idea of water-as-sound and pulling it off.

This, his first full-length under the MB guise, was produced by Modest Mouse's Isaac Brock for the latter's Glacial Pace imprint, a footnote that's actually no footnote at all. In addition to simply signing him, Brock has taken Lacy under his wing in recent years, bringing him along to open Modest Mouse amphitheater tours, and leaving behind audible prints on his studio efforts as well. Lacy's extremely gifted with cyclical melodies: thorny, fingerpicked spines around which he can snake a range of sounds simply for ambience. He accomplishes a lot of that here by considering a lot of the same moods and midnight tones as Brock did on his masterstroke The Moon & Antarctica or his work in Ugly Casanova. The vocal layers in particular are used as backup instruments, garbled and muffled (see the thunderclapping coda of ""New Doomsdays"") as though they're being transmitted from other orbits. Yet on openers ""Home and Somewhere Else"" and the appropriately titled ""The Loop"", it works because of how close it all feels when streaming through headphones. Whether Lacy's whispering or rasping, purring or stretching out his falsetto, you can hear each inhale and exhale as though you're listening from inside the dude's chest cavity. Lyrically he keeps in time and rhyme with the nature of his picking, the effect just as riveting as it is meditative. But much of the record's success relies on arrangement in lieu of variety. When Lacy introduces more to the fold, be it floating piano (""10 Percent"") or strings (""Cabin Fever"") or light horns (""Under and in Rocks""), the results are gorgeous. On the other end of the spectrum, ""Them"" falls totally flat without a tooth or hook to be found. It's actually a tough, restrictive way to operate as a songwriter, and when he breaks out, he's at his very best. Bookended by elliptical guitars, ""Burning Stars"" inverts his songwriting steez and blooms into a more traditional pop strummer. It's got great velocity, an achy-breaky melody, a terrific solo and even a few choruses and verses, too. It also doesn't sound like anyone but him.","This spectral folk/home recording project from Portland's Nate Lacy was produced by the songwriter's psuedo-mentor, Modest Mouse's Isaac Brock.

And yet, all of those seem less implausible than the second Deadly Syndrome record being received so quietly. This band was on its way three years ago-- galvanizing live shows, fervent local support, and The Ortolan, a record which hit enough populist-indie pleasure points to transcend the notion that they were mere beneficiaries of Silver Lake's hype cycle. I don't know exactly what happened to the Deadly Syndrome in the time since, but judging from Nolens Volens not much of it was good. The record sounds haunted by missed opportunities, isolation, and spiritual crisis. Solo acoustic opener ""Villain"" announces Nolens Volens as a totally different record than its predecessor-- the carnival instrumentation is dialed way back. You will no longer be hearing Wolf Parade comparisons. More startling are singer Chris Richard's vocals, which sound sapped of all hope, his yelp turned into a confessional plaint almost ashamed of itself before he turns accusatory (""why don't you just go fuck off and die? Is there anything you need?""). Despite a dangerously sweet piano lead, ""Doesn't Matter"" is no brighter, Richard shrugging through another morning wasted on sleep. ""Party City"" and the ""Paint It, Black""-drone of ""Deer Trail Place"" conjure drawn blinds and the disappearance of once-familiar faces, but while they're visceral, they're not muscular. Instead, they convey a feeling the record as a whole absolutely nails, the twitchy confusion borne of someone feeling trapped by their own inaction. As with The Ortolan, Nolens Volens rounds out with a synthetically composed epilogue, but the differences between the two are the most vivid illustration of the Deadly Syndrome's attitude shift. ""This Old Home"" was a Casio-heavy lark that conveyed a sense of humor the band mostly evidenced outside of their actual songs. ""Heresy"" is eight minutes of mournful drones and chipping snares. Hell, in the end I don't know if Nolens Volens predicts the band packing it in or hitting a crucial turning point. I'm hoping for the latter-- for all The Ortolan's pleasures, in retrospect it feels like a record that was going only as far as its ability to draw name-drops. Nolens Volens may be more sonically spare and emotionally despondent, but it's exponentially more honest and direct. This might not be the band's debut, but it feels like the first time we're really hearing what the Deadly Syndrome have to say.","L.A. band rebounds from falling off the hype machine with a more direct, foreboding, and ultimately better second LP.

Though only single ""Jail La La"" (the would-be LP's title) deals with actually being imprisoned, it's an oddly appropriate fit for the Dum Dum Girls' aesthetic: leather, cherry red lipstick, a classic girl-group sound that nods to drag races as much as malt shops. Because of an image licensing snafu, the original concept was scrapped, and in its stead is I Will Be, a blistering half-hour of menacing, witty bubblegum pop. Originally, Dum Dum Girls was a one-woman show. Kristin Gundred (stage name Dee Dee) first introduced the project as a bare-bones experiment, taking lo-fi 60s pop and beating it to all hell on DDG's self-titled debut EP. But unlike your average bedroom artist with a four-track and a thing for the Ronettes, Dee Dee was writing songs that were as catchy as they were well-rounded, even when buried under a thick layer of scuzz. (She accomplished the same with the Mayfair Set, an equally scuffed collaboration with Blank Dogs.) I Will Be still retains her EP's grit, but smartly updates the sound, enlisting three new members (including ex-Vivian Girl Frankie Rose) and hiring Richard Gottehrer (co-writer of the eternal ""My Boyfriend's Back"" and producer of records by seminal groups like the Go-Go's and Blondie) to produce alongside Dee Dee. The result is a more accessible version of Dum Dum Girls, bolstered by terrific harmonies (three of the four girls contribute vocals) and a crisper rhythm section. Most notable of all is the production: No longer a lo-fi group, DDG are now a rock band, and an occasionally ferocious one at that. Gottehrer and Dee Dee are perfect foils: She protects the song's fuzzy edges; he enhances the pure pop pleasures with a more textured bite. All of this technical detail would be lost, however, if it weren't for the fact that these songs are genuine earworms, both unfailingly hip and often wonderfully associative. Most adhere to a deep romanticism that details the various incarnations of love, from the fatalistic (""Yours Alone"", featuring guitar work from the Yeah Yeah Yeahs' Nick Zinner) to the overprotective (""Everybody's Out""). There is an air of disaffection that peppers a lot of these songs (for example, ""Oh Mein M"" is sung entirely in German), but they never end up feeling too cool for school, with their giddy bounce often fostering a more inclusive feel than anything else. The quick highs, dissatisfaction, and longing can't hide how terrifically fun most of I Will Be is. But in the end it's ultimately Dee Dee's show, her voice often deeply mysterious and feminine and other times coy and a little perilous. And as good as she is at anchoring a two-minute burst of rattling exuberance, the closing cut finds Dee Dee doing an ethereal rendition of Sonny and Cher's ""Baby Don't Go"", adding a real sense of fragility that undercuts the exquisite nature of the whole gritty thing. It's a grand little final gift from a record that's absolutely packed with them.","Former lo-fi star Dee Dee hires a full band and co-producer Richard Gottehrer, making this Sub Pop LP both terrifically fun and occasionally ferocious.

It's great fun to see the redheaded siblings headbanging like matching ""Fraggle Rock"" puppets in their ecstatic live show, but White Mystery holds up as more than a concert flyer. Austerity is less a choice than a necessity for the duo: The guitar goes from dirty-sounding to dirtier-sounding, the hooks are straightforward and stupidly catchy, and the singing is a belly-deep shout at the top of Alex White's range on almost every track. Don't be dissuaded by other, more infamous ""White""-themed guitar-and-drums duos: Alex White still has swagger for miles as a guitarist and vocalist. To compare younger brother Francis to his counterpart from the aforementioned White Stripes, he's a more accomplished player but less present as a personality. As the band's rhythmic anchor, he's nearly as unbuttoned as Alex with his instrument, and uses tracks like ""Overwhelmed"" to play drum fills that last for the entire songs. When he contributes a vocal, even if it's just to egg the elder White on, it makes a difference, whether adding backing vocals to the concise and melodic opener ""White Widow"" or a counterpart to the slower and sassier ""Don't Hold My Hand"". White Mystery is almost too long; what could have been eight to 10 single-release-worthy tracks is 14 almost exhausting ones. The same basic elements can be fatiguing, and can feel more like jamming the same button on the jukebox 14 times than a cohesive record with peaks and valleys. But even more than bratty lyrics, posessed vocals, or perpetual swagger, these songs beam with a sincere, almost perverse feeling of pride. The live-in-the-room-feeling, warts-and-all production makes obvious sense for a garage-rock duo, though it belies some of the sweetness at the core of some of their most immediate songs-- the ode to bipedalism ""Take a Walk"" or the PG-rated flirt of ""Don't Hold My Hand"". The lyrics of ""Respect Yourself"", bordering on pull quotes from an inspirational after-school special, are delivered so earnestly that they demand to be taken at face value. Irony, just like subtlety, holds very little import on White Mystery's debut.","Chicago garage-rock fixture Alex White forms a drums-guitar duo with her brother to craft a whipsmart record with an almost perverse sense of pride.

With township music to the south; Afrobeat, highlife, and juju going on Northwest; and soukous thriving just over the northern border, there's something bluntly Western about some of the music that came out of cities like Kitwe or Lusaka mid-decade. But then, considering the European post-colonial influence that still ran through the country at the time, Zam-rock's fuzzed-out, psych/proto-metal bent shouldn't be that surprising. Neither should the fact that so little of it actually came to the surface until recently; if a dedicated ethnomusicologist is going to take a trip to central Africa, it's probably not to bring back albums that sound like Blue Cheer's Vincebus Eruptum. Which brings us to a more interesting facet about Zam-rock besides how out of place it initially seems: how out of time it actually sounds. Africa, the sole album by Kitwe five-piece Amanaz, is one of the better examples of the genre's style, and how it was both behind and ahead of its era. It was released in 1975, rock's weird no-man's-land period between glam and punk, but its buzzing riffs and noodly solos place it a bit closer to 1969. That said, it's hard to pinpoint their exact influences, and the ones that come to mind at first listen seem like some kind of projection: if few people in the States or Europe bought albums by the Stooges or the Velvet Underground when they first came out, what's the likelihood that they made it to a Zambian audience even five years later? Yet you get a Ron Asheton wah-wah snarl in ""Making the Scene"", and there's a pretty Sterling Morrison-style lead guitar on ""Sunday Morning""-- which, besides sharing a title with a popular Velvets song, also sounds eerily like ""Oh! Sweet Nuthin'"". But it could all just be the shared byproduct of recording straightforward, low-budget rock in an economically depressed environment. For all their cursory musical similarities with the same bands that inspired punk rock, Amanaz were fairly unassuming, even through all the fuzztone. Unassuming in this case doesn't necessarily mean unambitious-- on record, they sound like a band that wanted to ply their trade in heavy rock, folk-pop, and funk all at once-- but there's a rawness on this album that gives it a familiar garage-band appeal. Rhythms shift from minimalist plod-stomps one track to supple grooves the next; lead singer Keith Kabwe's voice sometimes stretches past his melodic range into an off-key flatness that would be more off-putting if it didn't sound so spontaneous, and it's all recorded with a muddy fidelity that, if reminiscent of bedroom tape culture, doesn't do the music any favors by turning what could've been a wall of guitar squall into a flimsy chain-link fence. Not like much of that can be helped or even really matters, since Africa is one of those albums we should at least consider ourselves lucky to even get a chance to hear. Kabwe had retired to a life of farming by the time this album was proposed for reissue, and out of the other four band members, only guitarist Isaac Mpofu still survives. So hearing Kabwe wail, ""Lemme tell you something new/ About the history of the man/ He's got nothing to lose,"" in ""History of Man"" resonates a bit more knowing just how little was saved from the Zam-rock scene for future posterity and how close to impermanence Amanaz's music actually came.","This 1975 record from Zambia's ""Zam-rock"" scene, reissued by Now-Again and Shadoks, shows a band that was both behind and ahead of its era.

Color Your Life,Twin Sister,by: Sean Fennessey,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a8e913d1975652139785/1:1/w_160/c9037f1e.jpg,2010-03-30 06:00:02,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14073-color-your-life/,Infinite Best,"Twin Sister are a Brooklyn-by-way-of-Long Island quintet that do so much so well. Their songs have a remarkable sense of atmosphere and romanticism. They nod at their heroes-- maybe Stereolab and Björk, maybe Cocteau Twins or 1980s pop-- without overtly stealing. They seem to know they are capable of great things; perhaps ostentatiously, they released a trailer for Color Your Life, just their second EP (following November 2008's brief but occasionally stunning Vampires With Dreaming Kids). The EP features six songs, one of which is the instrumental ""Galaxy Plateau"", a stormy, harmonium-lead bit of futzing that is completely inessential. Even then, it's handled with such grace, it never feels presumptuous. Almost earned. Twin Sister's singer, the mousily enchanting Andrea Estella, has the sort of breathy, committed voice that untangles knots. It sits all over the mix on Color Your Life, a significant, if not monumental leap forward for the band. Sometimes Estella is high up, as on ""Milk & Honey"", a wrenching ballad about what so many of their songs are about: the promise of love and the confusing moments at the beginning and end of every relationship. It's a gorgeous song that quakes and quivers before abruptly ending. The respite is brief before they sharply enter the best thing they have done to date. ""All Around and Away We Go"" is a magical thing, driving and relaxed at once. Pitchfork's Ryan Schreiber recently compared the song to Andrea True Connection's disco chestnut ""More, More, More"", and despite the seeming incongruity, that's right on. Twin Sister thrive when things are hushed, as on Vampires' arresting ""I Want a House"" but they seem unhappy with those simple moves. ""All Around"" takes them to a new and better place. The rest of Color Your Life weaves in and out with little urgency. ""Lady Daydream"" is similarly lush, and full of heartfelt declarations-- ""If you can't find the sea, I will take you there,"" Estella sings on the chorus. Seven-minute opener ""The Other Side of Your Face"" seems to be the unfinished cousin of ""All Around and Away We Go""-- it never quite leaves the launching pad. Closer ""Phenomenons"" is polished and, strangely, almost radio-ready if it had an actual chorus. But that's not who this band is, either. In full, this is a mood record from a band that is still perfecting how to be not-too quiet. Power and volume often come easily to young bands. If things are reversed for Twin Sister, then they probably don't have very much to worry about.","Young NYC band continues to grow on its dynamic second EP, which recalls everything from Stereolab to Björk to Cocteau Twins.

Tomorrow Is Alright,Sonny and the Sunsets,by: Paul Thompson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a8eb13d1975652139789/1:1/w_160/b98e9d05.jpg,2010-03-30 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14069-tomorrow-is-alright/,Soft Abuse,"You've got your throwback acts-- content to fix a backwards gaze, work on their period-appropriate outfits, and match new words to old riffs-- and then there's San Francisco's Sonny & the Sunsets. They cull their sound from time-honored sources on their debut, Tomorrow is Alright, yet they're a wonderful anomaly-- never feeling tied to any particular era, overly beholden to their source material, or like they chose reverence for lack of better ideas. You can throw out influences all day-- Everly Brothers, glammy garage, doo-wop-- but you'll never quite cover it, and this slipperiness is key to their success. Tomorrow Is Alright matches 10 of Sonny Smith's wry, easygoing tunes with a far-reaching pastiche of vintage trappings, never feeling dutifully retro but rather, like their tough-to-pin-down citymates Girls, intangibly classic. Smith's been kicking around San Francisco for a minute now as both a playwrite and songsmith. The former's written all over Tomorrow's best tunes, which paint slightly askew, slyly funny portraits of wayward spacemen and the women who enslave them, randy youngsters, and Mary Kay test subjects. Throughout the record, Smith himself seems to be playing this unflappable bemused observer character. Smith's bent sense of humor and his sweet, scraggly pipes further sets them apart from their obvious sonic forebears. In no particular hurry to get to his point, Smith comes off as a likeable dude, and that easy charm helps put even the more directly descended songs over. No matter how you dressed these tunes up, they'd still feel cool, confident, and at times, wickedly funny. The Sunsets, featuring members of Thee Oh Sees, the Fresh & Onlys, and Citay, plus Sub Pop's Kelley Stoltz largely stay in the background, providing sparse but carefully considered instrumentation. Citay's Tahlia Harbour is the lone exception, although even she's used sparingly; her deadpan counterpoints to Sonny's stoney spaceman in ""Planet of Women"" or rationale-spouting youngster in ""Lovin' on an Older Gal"" are impeccably timed, a fitting gee-whiz to Sonny's endless aw-shucks. The production's crisp and roomy, allowing each word to linger, each note its own space. Tomorrow Is Alright feels like the work of a songwriter comfortable with himself and his limitations. Smith doesn't have a knockout voice; he's a natural, unflashy guitarist; and his lyrics skew conversational rather than confessional. Rather than outpacing himself with wild ambitions, Tomorrow Is Alright picks a lane and sticks with it, yet it feels far less reductive than most retro rock due to his easy charm. The couple-three tunes towards the back of Tomorrow that lean just a tad more heavily on older tropes don't leave quite the same mark as the very distinctive early highlights ""Planet"" or ""Too Young to Burn"" or ""Death Cream"", but even those throw an earworm or sweet harmony your way. So many bands put in a lot of work trying to make themselves sound older than their years; with their quiet confidence and no shortage of killer material, the Sunsets make it seem almost too easy.","Like citymates Girls, this group of San Fran all-stars matches wry, easygoing tunes with a far-reaching pastiche of vintage trappings.

Today / On Fire / This Is Our Music,Galaxie 500,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a8f913d19756521397a8/1:1/w_160/0e1ce43b.jpg,2010-03-30 06:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14083-today-on-fire-this-is-our-music/,Domino20/20/20,"When new bands play guitar music heavy on reverb and slow in tempo-- a combination that drapes tunes in a sublimely druggy dream-pop haze-- I can be slow to embrace them. It's not that there isn't plenty of good music in this vein being made. It's that one band, 20 years ago, did this sound so well and with so much personality, they set a difficult standard for newcomers to meet. Galaxie 500 didn't last long. They formed in Boston in 1986, released three albums between 1988 and 1990, got great notices in the press (especially the UK), and then dissolved. Following their breakup, after which lead singer and guitarist Dean Wareham went on to Luna and the rhythm section of Damon Krukowski and Naomi Yang formed Magic Hour and Damon and Naomi, Galaxie 500 albums went out of print. Krukowski bought the master tapes in an auction, the albums were gathered with bonus material in a box set by Rykodisc in 1996 and then reissued separately. They fell out of print again. Damon and Naomi's label, 20/20/20, are now bringing them out again in expanded 2xCD form, along with newly mastered vinyl editions. The CD packages are more functional than revelatory. The three original LPs have been smartly paired with extra discs that gather all extant material: 1988 debut Today with the covers/demos/B-sides set Uncollected; 1989's On Fire with Peel Sessions; and 1990's This Is Our Music with the live album Copenhagen. The liner notes by Byron Coley originally included in the latter are included with all three packages. There's no new information or previously unheard stuff  in these sets, but there is a lot of remarkable music. Today might be the best song-by-song album of Galaxie 500's three. It's also the most varied, moving from the ghostly mid-tempo beauty of opener ""Flowers"", the dreamiest dream-pop song of them all, to the deeply affecting absurdity of ""Tugboat"", where the narrator wants to leave the world behind and ""be your tugboat captain,"" to the pounding, mantra-like cover of Jonathan Richman's ""Don't Let Our Youth Go to Waste"", which actually rocks. Wareham's voice stays in a cracked upper register that can either be yearning or transcendent, and his guitar sustain seems to go on for days. Yang's bass playing, like that of Peter Hook, from whom she borrowed heavily, is the band's emotional center, and Krukowski's drums are as much about texture as they are about time-keeping. There were no virtuosos in this group, but everyone's part was essential. Rare is the band where three voices this distinctive come together to make a fourth, equally distinctive thing that transcends everything that went into it. And even more rare is the debut this assured and complete. Indeed, Today was such a terrific first statement, the only way for Galaxie 500 to best it was to narrow their focus and concentrate on doing one thing perfectly. Everything about 1989's On Fire, from the iconic cover art (the sleeve, like all three of their records, was designed by Yang) to producer Kramer's brilliantly surreal liner notes, to the just-under-mid-tempo beat that drives every song, comes together to support the whole. Wareham's guitar in particular remains fixated on one primitive strumming pattern, and the first three songs all find him taking off onto soaring wordless choruses in a falsetto-drenched reverb. Krukowski uses his drums to superb effect throughout, reinforcing the narcotic pace of the music with his slow-mo percussive explosions. It sounds samey in a sense, but On Fire's narrow focus turns out to be a strength. It feels immersive, the rock album as ambient record, and it's the definitive slowcore statement. On this reissue, as with the prior Rykodisc set, the original album is augmented with three additional songs originally on the Blue Thunder EP, including a take on Joy Division's ""Ceremony"" that could be the best cover of the legendary band in existence. And the Peel Sessions set, collecting two four-song sessions, is nothing short of essential. Galaxie 500's versions of their own work are just as strong but different, and the covers of the Sex Pistols, Young Marble Giants, and Buffy St. Marie, show how they could absorb the songs of others into their aesthetic. This Is Our Music, from 1990, has a few of Galaxie 500's best tunes and it also has the richest production, with greater focus on keyboards and layered guitars. ""Fourth of July"" is funny, ""Summertime"" has an almost blinding sparkle, and Yang's vocal on the cover of Yoko Ono's ""Listen, the Snow Is Falling"" is a pretty good argument that she should be fronting her own project. But despite its high points, This Is Our Music also has a few duds, which are the only easy skips on the band's proper records. ""Way Up High"" and ""Hearing Voices"" are nice enough, but feel like Galaxie 500 on cruise control. Hard to say where they might've gone from here. Given the relative merits of This Is Our Music, a fine album that sometimes sounds sleepy instead of dreamy, the fact that Galaxie 500 called it quits in spring 1991 is no tragedy. Some bands are meant to last for three albums; this was one of them. All involved would go on to do good things, including Kramer, who carried his sonic innovations into Low's early work. The live album, Copenhagen, which is heavy on songs from This Is Our Music and in almost every case improves upon them, turns out to be the ideal closing chapter. During the 1990 show in Denmark, Galaxie 500 play magnificently to what sounds like a pretty small crowd. But that small crowd is into it. Sometimes bands work like that. They never made it big, but during their short run, Galaxie 500's often quiet and always beautifully rendered music had a profound impact on a few people, including this writer. It needs to stay out there, where it has a chance of finding a few more.","The brilliant and influential dream-pop band's three studio albums have been reissued again, this time in 2xCD sets.

Love & Desperation,Sweet Apple,by: David Raposa,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a8e25e6ef959693212e8/1:1/w_160/5cb641a3.jpg,2010-03-29 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14067-love-desperation/,Tee Pee,"J Mascis' involvement in Sweet Apple might be the main draw for most, but it's also somewhat misleading. Like the other Tee Pee Records band in which Mascis is involved (sludge merchants Witch), his role here is strictly supporting. Sweet Apple's main man is instead John Petkovic, a Cleveland-area musician with his own three-decade career, in two respected yet unheralded bands (Death of Samantha and Cobra Verde). After the passing of his mother, Petkovic drove from Cleveland to Vermont to visit Mascis and bassist Dave Sweetapple, which lead to him writing the 70s arena rock-like songs that would end up on Love & Desperation. There's a cathartic who-gives-a-shit vibe to the entire enterprise, which is great when Sweet Apple stumble upon something worth giving a shit about. A few songs (the glammed-up barnburner ""Hold Me, I'm Dying""; grungy behemoth ""Never Came"") manage to successfully turn that trick. A Casio-abetted ballad like ""Dead Moon"" falls a little short of that mark, but it's a welcome digression. On much of the album, Petkovic unfortunately goes against his strengths as a songwriter, trying to strike a irony-free bad-to-the-bone rock-god pose that neither his voice nor words can back up. He comes up with a few killer lines-- ""I wasn't born, I was detached""-- and doesn't come up short as a singer for lack of trying (though his howling on ""It's Over Now"" comes close). However, all the not-so-tough talk about vampires and dead bodies and bad-ass chicks loses its luster after the third or fourth go-around. Coupling these clichés with sky-high guitar heroics doesn't help matters (though the faux-epic ""Blindfold"" manages to sidestep that pothole with a truly epic guitar solo). At their best, Sweet Apple sound like they're trying to emulate the lovable-loserdom perfected by one of Petkovic's unsung Cleveland rock peers, Prisonshake. At their worst, such as ""Goodnight"", Petkovic goes on and on about him and his hard-luck honey while the group tediously grinds away in the background. It's a sour note to hit, especially on such a haphazard journey. From the sounds of things (both in the press materials, and, intermittently, in some of the songs), the journey that lead Petkovic to make this album was one he needed to take. Here's hoping that whatever road lead Petkovic to Love & Desperation ultimately gets him back to doing what he does best.","Cobra Verde's John Petkovic leads a band featuring J Mascis through takes on 70s arena rock and hard-luck tales.

And in the Endless Pause There Came the Sound of Bees,Jóhann Jóhannsson,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a8de13d1975652139768/1:1/w_160/97e4d0e7.jpg,2010-03-29 06:00:03,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14064-and-in-the-endless-pause-there-came-the-sound-of-bees/,Type,"A flop-eared rodent frolics in a lush field. In from the horizon sweeps a black cloud, kicked up by an army of similar-looking rodents. That's the basic set-up of Varmints, a 24-minute film by Studio AKA animator Marc Craste, based on a book written by Helen Ward and illustrated by Craste. Jóhann Jóhannsson draws the title of his latest album from the book, and this is the music he composed for the film's soundtrack. There's quite a bit of extra material-- the album is a full 15 minutes longer than the film-- but there's really no padding. And in the Endless Pause There Came the Sound of Bees works as a suite and doesn't require knowledge of the film or even the film's existence to work as a recording, though I recommend seeing the movie if you get the chance, as it's a very well-done eco-parable. As a recording, the album displays a few sides of Jóhannsson we haven't heard before. Among his albums to date, it's one of the most musically active, and befitting its origin, also the most soundtrack-y, which means something for a guy working in a genre frequently referred to as cinematic. We first got to know the Icelandic composer through two brilliant minimal electro-orchestral albums, Englabörn and Virðulegu forsetar, both of which displayed a knack for unifying the whole work by exploring and re-exploring the same themes in different contexts. And in the Endless Pause does the same, returning to a series of motifs and using the orchestration to imply different meanings each time. Though it does incorporate some of Jóhannsson's trademark electronic treatments, this is largely an orchestral and choral work, given a vividly atmospheric, almost spectral performance by the Prague Philharmonic Orchestra and Choir. One of the biggest surprises of the score is how openly dramatic it is given the composer's past work. The solo cello that moans up out of the droning morass of ""Escape"" before being swallowed by a hideous electro-acoustic groan is among the most nakedly emotional sounds I've heard in his music. The richness of the arrangements elsewhere gives them dramatic heft-- ""Rainwater"" is so thick with strings it feels as if it could burst (it scores an odd scene in which huge flying jellyfish sprinkle dandelion seeds over the city). It has the glacial beauty of a lot of his past work without the glacial pacing. Which is not to say it's better, as the slow pacing of Virðulegu forsetar was one of its assets, but it is more immediate, whether or not you're watching those civilization-building rodents.","Consistently outstanding Icelandic composer and producer creates the soundtrack for a film about rodents that doubles as a well-done eco-parable.

The Illustrated Garden,Radar Brothers,by: Joshua Klein,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a8e1c0084474cd0c0f1f/1:1/w_160/c3ba0488.jpg,2010-03-29 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14066-the-illustrated-garden/,Merge,"After several solid albums-- many of them released by Merge-- and almost 15 years of effort, the bulk of Los Angeles' Radar Bros. have jumped ship. Among the notables left behind is singer, multi-instrumentalist, and producer Jim Putnam, who arguably has always been the band's central figure. Ironically, getting whittled down to one primary member probably makes it easier to stretch out the lifespan of a band, and Putnam soon rechristened the group Radar Brothers and recruited a new rhythm section (bass player Be Hussey and drummer Stevie Treichel) to record The Illustrated Garden. Just as the band's name is only slightly different, the new lineup's sound is only slightly different as well, yet the impact of the changes is still felt. It could be just be a trick of the light, but Putnam's songs here seem a little less elliptical than usual, the music more focused in its gauzy exploration of what could be loosely called Americana. The ""Americana"" tag sticks thanks to the general country-rock tropes and all the natural imagery, but as usual the group excels at blurring the edges of an already blurry genre with spacey (but never indulgent) psych leanings, controls set for the heart of the sun but anchored comfortably down to earth. Songs such as ""Quarry"", ""Radio"", and ""For the Birds"" recall such fellow travelers as the Meat Puppets at their most desert-fried, but Putnam's gentle vocals and the generally blissed-out disposition of the new lineup highlight the band's allegiance to craft over sun-bathed affectation. Indeed, when all else fails, The Illustrated Garden sure sounds great, with ""Horses Warriors"", ""And the Birds"", ""Xmas Lights"", and ""People"" all echoing the settled, mellow spirit of the early 1970s. Each track glows like a golden hour snapshot capturing a certain sunset idealism (occasional flashes of menace in the lyrics aside), and if Putnam surely harbors no illusions at this point of his music's reach, that doesn't mean his songs shine any less brightly.","Jim Putnam re-tools his band's lineup and tweaks its name on the Americana group's latest in a string of Merge releases.

Mulatu Steps Ahead,Mulatu Astatke,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a8aec0084474cd0c0e9f/1:1/w_160/dfe28595.jpg,2010-03-29 06:00:01,Jazz,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14023-mulatu-steps-ahead/,Strut,"In the late 1960s and early 70s, Mulatu Astatke was one of the driving forces behind the transformation of the Ethiopian music scene from one of state-sanctioned bands to independent groups that played at nightspots around Addis Ababa. As an arranger, he devised backing tracks for many of the country's popular singers, and as a solo artist he forged an unorthodox path of his own, developing a unique Ethio jazz style. It had at its core fundamental Ethiopian musical concepts, the pentatonic scale first and foremost. But Astatke, the only vibraphonist on the Addis scene, mixed these sounds with the jazz, Latin music, and psychedelia he'd picked up during his time at music schools in the U.S. and Britain to make something new. As important as he was to Ethiopian pop's golden era, Astatke's solo recordings were never commercial successes, and they remained little-heard outside his home country until Buda Musique's Ethiopiques series devoted its fourth volume to him in 1998. The cover showed him with Duke Ellington during the latter's 1973 visit to Addis, which was apt-- his own music had an Ellingtonian richness and sense of texture. Since that release, interest in his music has steadily grown. In the last few years, Astake got himself back in the game, heading to Harvard University on a Radcliffe Institute fellowship, where he worked on an opera and a modernization of the krar, a traditional Ethiopian stringed instrument. Last year, he cut an album and toured with London's Heliocentrics, and on Mulatu Steps Ahead, he works with them again, as well as Boston's Either/Orchestra, to take his music to a few places it's never been before. For one thing, much of Astatke's past music, especially his classic stuff, was much more structured and stately than what he does here. It's as though he's come out of his Ellington period and he's moving into a looser, more improvisational realm. The band eases into the album with ambient opener ""Radcliffe"", guys in a room gathering steam together, and the sound coalesces on ""Green Africa"". By the time they get into ""The Way to Nice"", they're hammering out a swinging groove. The way the saxes wind through pentatonic themes in unison on ""Mulatu's Mood"" recalls classic Astatke, and they give a solo to the bass sax and another to a kora, a West African harp that Mulatu drags across the continent and seamlessly inserts into his own music. He reaches way back into his own catalog on ""I Faram Gami I Faram"", a tune he originally wrote and recorded in New York in 1966. The combination of Ethio jazz texture, Latin rhythm, melismatic Ethiopian lead singing and salsa backing vocals is amazingly natural, and it's a much more distinctive version than the original, which features a more typical boogaloo vocal. It's great to hear Mulatu himself stretching out, soloing on ""Ethio Blues"" and creatively filling out the chords elsewhere. Anyone who's liked his music in the past is very likely to enjoy this, but I think Mulatu Steps Ahead will broaden Astatke's jazz following as well, and frankly, it's a much more coherent record than a lot of heavily improvisational modern jazz albums. It's a very easy album to access for listeners who aren't particularly schooled in either jazz or the Ethiopiques series as well, moving an old, appealing sound forward and outward. It's a pleasure to hear a man of Mulatu's age and past accomplishments push himself artistically like this, and it will be interesting to see where his music goes next.","The veteran Ethiopian bandleader works with Heliocentrics and Boston's Either/Orchestra to craft a loose and improvisational winner.

Roman Candle / From a Basement on the Hill,Elliott Smith,by: Jayson Greene,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a8e613d197565213977b/1:1/w_160/f4fd164b.jpg,2010-03-29 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14070-roman-candle-from-a-basement-on-the-hill/,Kill Rock Stars,"When Elliott Smith's final studio record, From a Basement on the Hill, was released in 2004, some people wanted to avert their eyes. It emerged in the aftermath of his stabbing death the year before, during which the shock over his gruesome death was compounded by troubling revelations. We were hearing about spiraling drug problems, ambiguities in his autopsy, and his fraught relationship with his family. For Smith's hardcore fans, the album's very existence was charged. Smith's family had assumed the task of completing the record and several contentious artistic decisions were made, including bringing in longtime producer Rob Schnapf and Joanna Bolme to finish a number of Elliott's songs that had been recorded as demos. At the time, the final result felt too hot to touch, and it remains the uneasy outlier in Smith's discography to this day. It was a sad fate for what had been shaping up to be the most sprawling, ambitious record of Smith's career. Whatever troubles may have been plaguing his personal life at the time, Smith seemed thrilled at the direction his music was taking. In interviews, he exulted in having discovered a ""big"" sound that made sense for him-- one that squared his expanding ambitions with his demand for pin-drop intimacy. His previous record, Figure 8, coated his songs in a blinding sheen that suited him as poorly as the rumpled all-white tux he'd worn to the Oscars. Basement saw him recoiling from that polish without abandoning his dream of a bigger sound, and whatever else it might be, it's the most complete document we have of the music he was hearing in his head those final years. The opening of ""Coast to Coast"" immediately gives us an idea of the changes Smith had in mind. After 40 seconds of haunted carnival music, a brambled wall of guitars presses in from all sides, with Smith's wounded tenor emanating weakly from the center. Everything feels uncomfortably, purposefully too-close; with mics pressed up against the instruments, every twitch and scrape is crystalized. The mix is startlingly vivid: When the first guitar is strummed on ""Pretty (Ugly Before)"", the chord doesn't ring so much as bloom, suffusing the song with soft light. ""Strung Out Again"" is a lurching waltz, with Smith's guitar lines creaking and stumbling into wrong notes. Elliott's voice, in this context, has never sounded lovelier or more ruined. No beautiful sound escapes without scars. Smith wrote with painful economy and eloquence about his own shortcomings, and his words cleaved through bullshit with bracing force. During the Basement on the Hill sessions, he began writing about his drug problems and depression with an unprecedented clarity. It seemed like an implicit rise to the challenge he posed himself in ""Strung Out Again"", where ""Just looking in the mirror/ Will make you a brave man."" He sings calmly and directly about terrifying scenarios. After years of rehabilitation and relapse, he had boiled the exhausting cycle of lifelong addiction down to eleven brutal words: ""Took a long time to stand/ Took an hour to fall."" The context is part of the reason listening to From a Basement on the Hill felt somewhat indecent in 2004. Now, Kill Rock Stars is re-releasing the album alongside a remastered reissue of his 1994 debut, Roman Candle, situating the two records as bookends to an extraordinarily fertile career that may even help the volatile Basement on the Hill settle in more comfortably alongside the rest of Elliott's work. Roman Candle, for its part, remains a fan favorite, and it contains some classic Smith songs: ""Condor Ave"", the title track, and ""Last Call"", in particular. And yet it mostly serves to point to all that Elliott would later become. It's wispier and more diffuse than his self-titled or Either/Or, and nothing here is as indelible as ""Needle in the Hay"", ""The Biggest Lie"" or ""Ballad of Big Nothing"". A few of the ""No Name"" song sketches drift in and out without leaving much of a mark-- Smith's music would become fuller, and his harmonic language more confident, on subsequent albums. The sound is there, though, unmistakable from the first note: the defeated whisper of the vocals, the deceptively intricate guitar work, and the angry little mantras (""leave alone, leave alone, 'cause you know you don't belong here""). From these beginnings, Smith would experiment with how much he could add to this framework without crushing it; on From a Basement on the Hill, he found a thrilling new plateau.

"Live Recordings, TV-Clips & Roadmovie",LiLiPUTKleenex,by: Douglas Wolk,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a8d213d197565213974b/1:1/w_160/1a902256.jpg,2010-03-26 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14056-live-recordings-tv-clips-roadmovie/,Kill Rock Stars,"""Why don't you listen to LiLiPUT/ Where punk rock starts and ends?"" asked a Yummy Fur song in the mid-1990s. ""Maybe if you listened to LiLiPUT/ Your songs would find more friends."" The Swiss band that called itself first Kleenex, then LiLiPUT, formed in 1978, went through a succession of lineups and three singers, produced a handful of singles and two albums, broke up in 1983, and released a 2xCD of all its extant studio recordings more than a decade later. That collection, called simply LiLiPUT, is a singular post-punk document-- a band inspired by the punk revolution but doing something radically different. You can hear them inventing an idiom from scratch, writing songs that used their rudimentary skills brilliantly, then building on their initial momentum to push themselves further out. It's unlike anything that came before it, and a total blast to listen to. (There may never have been a giddier song recorded than ""Split"".) Any further recordings, you'd think, would be precious; I've bought more than a couple of dodgy records by other bands because somebody compared them to this one. (A word of advice to anyone thinking of buying, say, the Nixe reissue that came out in 2008: It turns out that being European women who started a band in the post-punk era and didn't have a lot of technical facility at first was not, in fact, what made LiLiPUT special.) So this new 2xCD release sounded mighty promising: a Kleenex set from 1979 and a LiLiPUT set from 1983, plus five previously unreleased songs, and a DVD with half a dozen video clips and Roadmovie, a film of their 1982 tour. Unfortunately, from the evidence of Live Recordings, LiLiPUT weren't a particularly great live band, and Kleenex were terrible-- shaky, often way out of tune, clinging as tightly as they could to the contours of their recordings and occasionally not even able to manage that. (Somebody bobbles the ending of ""Ain't You"".) The unheard songs are lesser variations on other things they were doing at the time. Roadmovie turns out to be silent, hand-held Super-8 footage of whatever caught the camera-holder's eye on the road, scored with recordings from LiLiPUT's albums; if you've ever wanted to see blurry images of the Swiss autobahn circa 1982, this may hold a smidgen of interest for you. The video clips are a bit more interesting, especially the 1979 TV appearance in which they wear color-coded outfits and awesome new wave hairstyles, and bassist Klaudia Schiff uncertainly mugs for the camera. But the bottom line is that someone coming to this album without having heard Kleenex/LiLiPUT's studio recordings would have very little idea why one of the greatest bands of their era was anything special. Passionate fans of LiLiPUT still long for anything more that lives up to their legacy. We're going to have to keep waiting.","This 2xCD release unarchives a few moments from the Swiss punk band's past: a Kleenex set from 1979, a LiLiPUT one from '83, unreleased songs, and a DVD.

Lux,Alex Smoke,by: Andrew Gaerig,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a8b9c0084474cd0c0ebb/1:1/w_160/619febec.jpg,2010-03-26 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14034-lux/,Hum+Haw,"Alex Smoke makes electronic music that runs counter to virtually every prevailing trend. More interestingly, there are very few moments during the last decade-plus that this statement wouldn't be mostly true. The Scottish producer crafts dark, ornate music that seems intentionally at odds with electronic music's current fixation on luminescent house sounds; he has a reputation for minimalism, but his productions seem too roiling to slot into whatever sounds that word represents. Dubstep is similarly deep and ominous, but Smoke sounds steely and focused, not foggy and stoned. On his third album, Lux, he again uses tough arpeggios, mumbled vocals, and furrowed percussion to enact mini-dramas of industrial techno. Though Lux can evoke comforting sadness, its orchestral bent and general meticulousness keep it from ever feeling truly despairing. So the album offers these small perversions of mood without becoming overbearing. Because he obscures his voice and has a reputation for making complete albums (as opposed to singles), Smoke's work has been compared to Thom Yorke's solo outing, The Eraser. While both share an affinity for the hardscrabble rhythms of mid-1990s IDM, Smoke's compositions are less linear and song-oriented. The 14 tracks on Lux often stretch past six minutes, but Smoke doesn't build to climaxes so much as sniff out every corner of his creations. Lux is Smoke's least motive album yet-- only the most generous definitions of ""dance"" would include this music-- but these tracks don't idle, they prowl. When Smoke increases the tempos-- the thrumming ""Blingkered"", the lite-rave of ""Pilk""-- his songs sound tense, not celebratory. You can connect the lurching ""Physic"" or ""Lux+"" to Hyperdub's smeared sound attacks, but minus the exposed-nerve bass. Lux occasionally sounds like Coil's snake-y masterpiece, Love's Secret Domain, but that album alluded to sex and drugs (or maybe druggy sex), and Alex Smoke seems chiefly concerned with Alex Smoke. More than anything, Lux feels self-contained: produced by a single artist and released on Smoke's own Hum + Haw imprint, it projects dark vistas that feel deeply personal. Unlike many techno artists, Smoke builds his albums for sitdown sessions (EPs containing floor-friendly versions of ""Lux+"" and ""Blingkered"" are already available) and has seemingly little concern for where these dense, thoughtful behemoths fit in a broader context. Forunately, Lux needs little besides an accommodating, stormy mindset for its hum and shiver to make sense.","Latest from the Scottish producer whose dark, ornate music seems at odds with electronic music fashion in the best possible way.

Dear Companion,Ben Sollee and Daniel Martin Moore,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a8b713d1975652139703/1:1/w_160/f32c56ea.jpg,2010-03-26 06:00:02,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14032-dear-companion/,Sub Pop,"A state-of-the-state album, Dear Companion finds three musicians focusing on the ecological challenges facing of old Kentucky home. Between them, they represent a range of the Bluegrass State's musical traditions: Lexington native Ben Sollee plays cello in a style that borrows from Appalachian techniques, Daniel Martin Moore of Cold Spring is a solo folk artist whose unsolicited demos earned him a slot on Sub Pop's roster, and producer Yim Yames sings in Louisville's famed My Morning Jacket. On their first record together, they play songs about the Kentucky mountains and the plight brought on by the industrial practice called mountaintop removal mining, which is just as invasive and evil as it sounds. Dear Companion examines what it means to be from Kentucky when Kentucky is disappearing-- both literally (entire mountains are being obliterated) and culturally (the geography that shaped its culture and music is being drastically reshaped). So this is exactly the kind of album you want to succeed, and for the most part, it does. Dear Companion generally avoids the self-importance of most issue-driven music, mainly because Sollee and Moore write songs that rarely stray from their own points of view. Rather than sing about a tractor dismantling a mountain, they focus on their own fears and hopes, especially as they bear on subsequent generations. In addressing these concerns, the songs can be measured and even moving, but occasionally they get a bit lofty. On the aggressively humble ""Only a Song"", with its lyrics about ghettos and Harlem Globetrotters, Sollee and Moore solemnly offer, ""But this is only a song, it can't change the world."" While their voices don't have the rough edges to sell the hardened blues of the title track, their harmonies are loose and casual on opener ""Something, Somewhere, Sometime"" and ""My Wealth Comes to Me"", which breaks into a chorus that sounds like an updated Louvin Brothers. Fine singers all, Sollee, Moore, and Yames wisely keep the focus primarily on the stringed instruments. Playing guitar and cello almost exclusively, Moore and especially Sollee draw from regional music traditions, but instead of making a folk or bluegrass or country album, they have meshed those styles into a modern sound whose spareness may be its greatest virtue. Sollee's cello adds chilling low end to the coda of ""Sweet Marie"" and creates a high, keening melody on ""It Won't Be Long"", but mostly he plucks and hammers at the strings to create a tectonic rumble, as if trying literally to interpret the sound of mountaintop removal. He and Moore play like they're trying to prove Kentucky's cultures and traditions not only remain relevant at a time when regional distinctions are rapidly disintegrating, but continue to inspire new generations of musicians.","My Morning Jacket's Jim James coaxes a modern sound from traditional roots on an album about the ecological challenges facing the trio's old Kentucky home.

Missing Deadlines: Selected Remixes,Ulrich Schnauss,by: Patrick Sisson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a8bdb1335d7bf1699354/1:1/w_160/a08be3b3.jpg,2010-03-26 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14037-missing-deadlines-selected-remixes/,Rocket Girl,"As a teenager in Kiel, Germany in the early 90s, Ulrich Schnauss discovered bands like Ride and My Bloody Valentine by tuning in to British armed forces radio. ""As soon as I put the headphones on,"" he says, ""the world seemed to be a nicer place."" Nearly 20 years later, after three albums and a slew of remixes, Schnauss still seems engrossed with those lush sounds. Like Sonic Cathedral, the British club night and label that embraces shoegaze in all its permutations, he takes a wide-angle view of the genre, seeing it as a current that runs through many different eras. The solid source material he reworked for the remix collection Missing Deadlines-- which ranges from solo work by members of Slowdive and Ride to songs by Rainbirds' frontwoman Katharina Franck and the John Tejada/Takeshi Nishimoto project I'm Not a Gun-- speaks to this sense of related history and possibility. Taken as a whole, though, Schnauss' treatment of these tracks is aesthetically redundant. Prone to creating ethereal music that sometimes skews toward being too amiable, many of Schnauss' remixes sound like pretty shoegaze setpieces, orchestrated to create a familiar emotional payoff with tricks we've heard many times before. While he pulls some of the songs in a more dance-friendly direction, his bent guitars, clouds of static, and vocal echoes have a way of blending together here. Take Madrid's ""Out to Sea"", a track built around bright synths, gentle guitar, and breathy vocals. Schnauss' remake bathes it in warm synths and gauzy vocals, softens the guitar, and washes out the sound, placing a halo around the song for emphasis. That dreamy haze also seeps into his treatment of ""Remembrance"", a single by the Joy Division-influenced Dragons that's smoothed over with bent vocals and thick, swirling layers of suspended synths. Mojave 3's epic ""Blurbird of Happiness"" has a warm, rambling vibe that Schnauss over-accents with nature samples and back-masked glockenspiels that sound like wind chimes. Orbital-like echoes are applied to Juanita Stein's vocals on Howling Bells' ""Setting Sun"", maintaining the track's sensual groove, while the rhythm of A Sunny Day In Glasgow's ""Ghost in the Graveyard"" is brought more to the fore until it sounds a bit like M83. But redundant or not, Schnauss knows how to create sweeping, emotive, grandiose music-- and his remix of Mark Gardner's ""The Story of the Eye"" gets it right by bulking up the track, trading the quiet focus and slow bassline for vocal layers and accordion-like synths. Schnauss always adds a certain signature to his remixes, but it's not always clear if making something busier necessarily makes it better.","A dreamy haze runs across this shoegaze-minded producer's remix collection, for better or worse.

Under Great White Northern Lights,The White Stripes,by: Ryan Dombal,Features Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a8e5ea9e61561daa591e/1:1/w_160/4fcd3176.jpg,2010-03-26 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14068-under-great-white-northern-lights-box-set/,Warner Bros.Third Man,"In the final scene of the White Stripes tour documentary Under Great White Northern Lights, Jack and Meg sit on a bench in front of 88 black-and-white keys. Jack starts to play the piano and sing his ballad ""White Moon"". Meg starts to cry. It's a heartbreaking, out-of-nowhere surge of intimacy that briefly lifts the curtain on one of the most fascinatingly private bands to ever reach arena-rock ubiquity. It's also one of those revealing moments that raises more questions than it answers. Are the tears a harbinger of the crippling anxiety that struck Meg soon after the film was shot in 2007, forcing the Stripes to cancel dates and enter a mysterious hiatus that continues to this day? Is Meg acknowledging a hidden truth behind her ex-husband/little brother/good friend's song? Maybe she just didn't get enough sleep the night before. We don't know. It's this sense of unknowing that makes the White Stripes such a riveting live act. The exquisitely packaged Under Great White Northern Lights box set aims to summarize the duo in their most potent form-- onstage, with two spotlights beaming straight through them, using little more than eye contact and reflexes to figure out where to go next. And it's a wild success. In a 2002 Spin interview, Meg summed up her musical goals succinctly: ""The point is being a live band."" This comprehensively indulgent live set drives that point home with force. The box's centerpiece is the UGWNL film directed by Emmett Malloy, which follows Jack and Meg as they hit small Canadian towns with names like Yellowknife and Whitehorse while making their way through every province and territory in the country. The pair also celebrate their 10th anniversary near the end of the trek, lending the affair some sentimental heft; the strange trip from being a couple of married oddballs in peppermint duds to being divorced, canonized Saviors of Rock can sometimes be seen flickering across their faces. In order to recapture their early days playing for a handful of doubters at Detroit's Gold Dollar, the Stripes scheduled a slew of impromptu, word-of-mouth ""B-side"" shows along the way at a bowling alley, a flour mill, on a bus, and at a cafe in the Northwest Territories. The weirdest and most unorthodox gig goes down at an old-folks home in the sparsely populated city of Iqaluit. The resident elders treat their dark-haired guests to avian myths (""ravens used to speak like us... they are smarter than us"") and raw caribou-- the meeting is warm, out of time, and charmingly absurd. Kind of like a White Stripes song. Those searching for behind-the-scenes dirt on the band would be better served by an exploitative, unauthorized biography. UGWNL is ultimately a hagiography meant to bolster the White Stripes' status as porcelain, godlike geniuses. And Jack and Meg indeed look impeccable while simply walking across frozen tundra or posing in front of customized red, white, and black tour planes. (Some 200 pages worth of their shutter-ready mugs grace a gorgeous book by ace photog Autumn de Wilde that's included in the box.) No matter where they are or what they're doing, it's tough taking your eyes off these two. The pair almost comically play into type in the few non-performance candid scenes, often shot during post-show comedowns. Jack is loud and intense; Meg's first words are spoken a full 23 minutes into the film-- and they're so soft they require subtitles. The movie's most contentious exchange is pretty mild, and actually revolves around Meg's refusal (or perhaps inability) to speak up. Throughout, the White Stripes live up to their mythic roles: Jack runs around, charismatically blabbing, yelping, and flailing like a little brother while Meg's big-sis stoicism keeps things grounded. Unlike the similarly formatted 1967 Bob Dylan pic Don't Look Back, which featured the young singer interacting with outsiders and sometimes coming off like a jerk, UGWNL rarely lets us see the Stripes outside of their carefully controlled realm. Even so, moments like Meg's minor breakdown poke through. And more than enough personality comes across in their manic live shows anyway. The UGWNL movie neatly packs concert highlights into quick-moving medleys. But to explain this band's appeal onstage, the uncut White Stripes live experience is a must. For that, the box offers a manageable 16-track, hit-filled album on both CD and double vinyl and a more hardcore 135-minute DVD of the Stripes' 10th anniversary show in full called Under Nova Scotian Lights and filmed at Glace Bay's Savoy Theater on July 14, 2007. The album sounds ridiculously heavy, with many songs-- including the gurgling ""I'm Slowly Turning Into You"" and the Dusty Springfield cover ""I Just Don't Know What to Do With Myself""-- easily trumping their studio counterparts. But the LP is also relatively linear and song-based, which isn't really how White Stripes shows work. On the flip, the Under Nova Scotian Lights DVD is the best simulacrum of a Stripes live set ever produced. The pair are locked in, switching songs up on the fly, tumbling into old blues covers without pause, and generally proving exactly why they're considered musical superheroes in real time. There's no net for these gigs, and dropped notes or beats happen now and then, but the overall streak of spontaneity is key. In a UGWNL interview segment, Jack talks about how he purposely sets up his instruments far away from each other on the stage as a masochistic motivator to force him to hustle-- he starts sweating through his shirt early on, and doesn't stop. Without a single drum fill or snare roll, Meg once again proves to be the ideal foil for Jack's virtuosity as she fills the room with her crash cymbal while pounding out staunch hard-blues beats John Bonham would appreciate. When Jack sings about ""lookin' for a home"" on traditional closer ""De Ballit of De Boll Weevil"", it's clear he's already found it as he flies feedback through a crowd with Meg to his right. It's exactly where he belongs. The UGWNL box is also a triumph of Jack's ongoing quest to show the world that ""there is more beauty and romance in tangible, mechanical things than in invisible, digital things."" Though he's ramped up the web presence of his label, Third Man, Jack is still a Luddite at heart, obsessing over outmoded instruments and recording techniques. His aversion to technology can seem stubborn, but a big part of this set's power lies in its physicality. It's blocky and sturdy and aesthetically beautiful in its three-color minimalism. And the seemingly slight bonuses-- a photo-illustration book with Jack as the Tin Man and Meg as Dorothy, a colored 7"" single, a silkscreen print-- add up to give the package a fanclub-style sense of exclusivity (note that the live album and documentary DVD are also being sold separately; the live DVD is exclusive to this box). But its over-the-top grandness as well as its stark black box with red inner-lining also give the set an air of casket-like finality. ""I hope you appreciate what I do for you,"" sings Jack on ""A Martyr for My Love for You"" near the end of the anniversary show. He then steps away from the mic for a good 15 seconds, letting the words float in silence. Then he finishes the song.","This lavish box set-- a live DVD, CD, documentary film, and book-- reinforces the White Stripes' mythology and displays the awesome power of their live show.

The Optimist,New Young Pony Club,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a8d8b1335d7bf169939b/1:1/w_160/739b924f.jpg,2010-03-25 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14061-the-optimist/,The Numbers,"Don't believe the album title, believe the album cover-- while New Young Pony Club's 2007 debut LP Fantastic Playroom may have been prefab, superficial, and sorta garish, it at least gave the impression of being a whole lot of fun. And now here's The Optimist with its Serious Artist design, but really it's just a preview for dance-rock at its most pro forma and drab, a triangulation of Garbage at their most blandly professional, Bloc Party at their least agitated, and Ladytron at their most bored. At the center of it all is Tahita Bulmer, her deadpan voice previously lauded for conveying a nonchalant carnality on minor hits ""Ice Cream"" and ""The Bomb"". Not much has changed on that front, but The Optimist too often gets lost in non-committal melodies as Bulmer tries and tries again to capture quote-worthy elegant wastefulness-- ""You got the instinct/ Tell me what's the answer,"" ""We want to/ I don't want to do any of this without you,"" and the coup de grâce, ""Don't look at me now/ Look at my intellect/ The things I leave behind like footsteps."" So much goes into this ice queen guise, and yet the best parts of The Optimist occur when she opens up on the hooks-- ""We Want To"" has a hands-in-the-air agreeability pulled fresh from the days of mandatory Franz Ferdinand rips, and opener ""Lost a Girl"" has a kinesis that's notably lacking on the rest of the LP. Memorable passages like these are lost amidst songs that stretch out to five minutes when they should be three, and are constructed nearly the same exact way in nearly the same exact tempo-- there's promise in the syncopated percussion of the title track, but it plods when it should glide, while ""Stone"" wastes the most intriguing keyboard overdubs by sloppily using them all at once. In the end, The Optimist isn't just disappointing for people who believed in NYPC, but for people who want to believe in microgenres even when they are clearly not built for the long run. New Young Pony Club weren't nu-rave, blog-house, or French touch, but they didn't need to be-- their maximalist, fashion-forward, club-friendly aesthetic gave them enough philosophical congruence to benefit from the prevailing trends of the time. They seemed positioned as a latter-decade Ladytron, a bastion of aloof cool amidst an otherwise spazzy and day-glo scene. But Ladytron's Witching Hour proved that fantastic art could result from complimenting that facade with inspired songwriting, considered production, and an occasional peek at emotional resonance. Those qualities are absent from The Optimist, an album that pretty much shows NYPC content to ride this aloof cool thing out.","Dance-rock stars of minor blog hits like ""Ice Cream"" and ""The Bomb"" return with another stab at capturing the aloof cool of Ladytron.

Sleep Mountain,The Kissaway Trail,by: Larry Fitzmaurice,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a8d3b1335d7bf169938e/1:1/w_160/95141526.jpg,2010-03-25 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14057-sleep-mountain/,Bella Union,"The Kissaway Trail's 2007 self-titled debut album had a nervy energy typical of indie rock traditionalists like British Sea Power and the Shout Out Louds. But while its ideas were hardly groundbreaking, the band at least sounded like it was trying to create, rather than simply emulate. On the Danish quintet's Sleep Mountain, that is hardly the case. From the palm-muted chords and chiming bells that open it, this album is stained to the point of unintentional parody by the Arcade Fire's influence. If you think it's a coincidence, note that there is actually an accordion-festooned, we're-all-in-this-together shout-along called (wait for it) ""Don't Wake Up"". Sleep Mountain's lack of originality is made worse by the fact that few of its songs actually go anywhere. Themes recycle themselves without providing much in the way of progression, and the few effective ideas, like the looped percussive beat in ""Painter"" or the new-wave romanticism of ""Beat Your Heartbeat"", are undercooked and underrealized. And it's not like the Kissaway Trail are working under strict time constraints-- almost every song that makes up the record's 55-minute length runs past the four-minute mark. Those who brave the record's turgid front end will be treated to Sleep Mountain's more interesting portion. The tangled guitar lines and mixed-back shouts on ""Whirr of Wings"" are faintly evocative of the better parts of 1990s emo, and despite a funereal accordion making another appearance, ""New Lipstick"" hits with a broad pop appeal reminiscent of their fellow countrymen, the underrated Figurines. Unfortunately, most listeners won't make it to these brief bright spots with the band's brutal cover of Neil Young's ""Philadelphia"" blocking the way. Young's frail voice (in full effect during his performance at the 1993 Oscars) created maximum emotional impact, while the Kissaway Trail's take is overblown, with its vocals processed to oblivion and dramatic orchestral swells adding layers of hyperbole that suffocate the simple, affecting melody. Ironically, it's here that Sleep Mountain is at its most worthwhile, teaching an important lesson: Without personality, pathos doesn't mean shit.","Once a nervy indie rock band à la British Sea Power, the Kissaway Trail here is basically a Scandinavian Arcade Fire.

But during a worrisome stretch for the Wu-Tang Clan that year, he seemed among the most likely to survive and even thrive if the Clan ceased to exist as a functioning group. Largely self-produced and forgoing any A-listers (U-God doesn't count), the album harbored no delusions about what it was meant to provide-- Deck ripping through one simile-laden verse after another with beats that stayed out his way. But since then, his fall-off has been dramatic, as he's rattled off increasingly less-noticed solo drops and sounded wholly uninspired on higher-profile Wu-related releases (remember ""keep it fresh like Tupperware"" from 8 Diagrams?). It was easy to view last year's ""House Nigga"" as some sort of nadir, Deck spending five minutes dissing Joe Budden for his Internet fame. This was the guy whom even GZA was scared of following on ""Triumph""? A more positive approach is to see the song as Deck's attempt to find his place in a galaxy of faded NYC stars; the wise ones realize they're not competing with Drake. At the outset, Deck seems aware of what could constitute a solid 2010 release on his part. Though the ringside samples of ""The Champion"" are beyond played, he still lets off rounds of impressively pugilistic internal rhyme. Meanwhile, the Obama-quoting ""Born Survivor"" continues the low-key revival of Cormega and reveals the image Deck wants to create for himself here, a grind-oriented street soldier not all that far removed from latter-day dead prez albums. They called it ""revolutionary but gangsta,"" while Inspectah boasts, ""Still I'm quick to pop it off/ With the model broads or the Molotovs."" But as Manifesto runs through its forbidding 20-track playlist, it unsurprisingly falters when it chases Hot 97 spins that are laughably out of reach. The aluminum hand-claps of ""We Get Down"" evoke a G-Unit beat so generic that even Tony Yayo would take pause, ""T.R.U.E."" is a limp rap&B overture for empire states of mind, and ""The Big Game"" is saddled with a cornball hook of a non-metaphor that can't fully commit to Auto-Tune. And while the relationship songs of Uncontrolled Substance offered an occasional glimpse behind Deck's otherwise stoic veneer, ""Luv Letter"" comes awfully close to Murs at his most needy. But worse than the blind fumbling for hits is hearing what sounds like an average MC doing an uncanny Inspectah Deck impersonation. It's disorienting to hear him put such conviction behind subpar get-that-paper rhymes. And while Raekwon, Billy Danze, and Kurupt hold serve, ""Brothaz Respect"" houses quite possibly the most embarrassingly off-beat Cappadonna guest spot to date (and I've heard The Yin and the Yang), and too much of Manifesto is turned over to aggressively average foot soldiers like Fes Taylor and the indefensibly-named Carlton Fisk. Look, it's no fun to criticize Deck for reaching for that brass ring. You can't help but think he realizes this disconnect during ""This Is It"", where he counters those who think he's slipped by boasting of ""A million kids thinkin' he rich/ A million bitches think he the shit."" Sadly, it shows how the dynamic's been reversed for Inspectah Deck since Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers)-- you sit there and watch him play himself, knowing he's lying.","The Wu-Tang MC returns with his first full-length in four years.

Two Thousand and Ten Injuries,Love Is All,by: Jess Harvell,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a8d99d034d5c69bf3b41/1:1/w_160/e7fc1ef3.jpg,2010-03-25 06:00:01,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14062-two-thousand-and-ten-injuries/,Polyvinyl,"Two Thousand and Ten Injuries buzzes with joy. Hardly surprising, since Love Is All are one of the era's great punk bands. But wait: Should you really use the word ""punk"" to describe a band with such obvious ambitions beyond the guitar/bass/drums baseline? Because if you've heard Love Is All, you know they're hardly formalists: disco beats, post-punk sax honking, twee-pop boy-girl harmonies. They've got a definite sound, but within its boundaries they're thrillingly unconstrained. Listen past the kitchen-sink sonic clutter, though, and Two Thousand and Ten Injuries could have wooed the same teen rabble as Sam the Sham and the Trashmen. After all, the garage and psych bands of the Nuggets-era also played ham-handed organs and saxes, and pounded their way through ethnic percussion and a hundred variations on the Bo Diddley beat. And nobody would describe them as post-punk. Take TTaTI opener ""Bigger Bolder"", with its learn-in-a-minute melody and reverb-ragged ""bad"" production. It's the kind of fuzzy, bouncy racket you could imagine blaring from jukeboxes in the early 1960s. But then there are the lyrics. It's the lyrics that separate Love Is All from those garage rock pioneers and really connect them to the late-70s DIY explosion. Love Is All singer Josephine Olausson is one of the early 21st century's great poets of romantic dissatisfaction, and like the ladies of the Slits, the Raincoats, and the Delta 5, her take on bad romance is deeply personal, beyond post-punk pastiche. Her kiddie yelp, with its innate cuddliness when she goes soft and conversational, can sound like a precocious grade-schooler obsessed with her mom's copy of Wanna Buy a Bridge?. But the sugary cuteness is a smokescreen, hiding the kind of scalpel-edged self-examination most of us like to avoid at all costs. Pay attention, and certain lines all but draw blood with their plain-spoken pain: ""I know I was acting a fool/ I remember you calling me cruel/ Well that was ages ago/ Oh how I wish I could prove how I've grown."" In Olausson's world, there are no predators and no victims. Just human beings, emotional fuck-ups trying to do a little better this time out, capable of life-changing kindness and casual cruelty in the same 12-month span. And accordingly, given Love Is All's mix of the unflinching and the playful, no one's left off the hook. Olausson knows that when a relationship cracks up, both parties are often to blame, and that failure was always a possibility. And still we try again, if only because it beats the alternative. That kind of romantic realism, however witty or self-deprecating or full of non-sentimental pathos, makes Olausson's vulnerable moments all the more unexpected, and all the more effective as emotional sucker-punches. When she shouts, ""I want my head resting on a lap,"" on ""A Side in a Bed""-- over the kind of lovesick new wave worthy of a John Hughes climax-- you know she's lived enough to know the sacrifices behind the fantasy the music both celebrates and subverts. You could say Olausson's subject is narrow. But it's the only thing that matters. Even if we're wised-up, grown up, and made a little (or a lot) cynical by life, don't we all want our heads resting on a lap?","Disco beats, post-punk sax honking, twee-pop boy/girl harmonies, and lyrics that rip your heart out.

Head First,Goldfrapp,by: Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a8dd5e6ef959693212dd/1:1/w_160/47bdf183.jpg,2010-03-25 06:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14063-head-first/,Mute,"Yup, another wardrobe change. Alison Goldfrapp and Will Gregory have always valued style along with song, and on most of the fifth Goldfrapp album, Head First, pink spandex turns out to be a great look. Bringing 1980s roller-disco synth-pop motifs out of mothballs has given the UK duo their most immediately entertaining album since 2005 electro-glam juggernaut Supernature. The only problem: They fail to give each song a face as memorable as the overall album's Jane Fonda workout-video get-up. Good thing Goldfrapp do spectacle like few else. No less a glamor lover than Adam Lambert was quoted recently saying he had wanted to work with the group for his debut, but couldn't because they were already busy with Christina Aguilera-- not exactly pop's dowdiest persona herself. Whether in the clown robes and animal masks of Goldfrapp's expert live shows, or the sharp-edged sound design of an eclectic discography, they treat pop as a form of not just communication, but presentation. With sunny Van Halen synth tones, Xanadu-era Olivia Newton John optimism, and galloping Giorgio Moroder basslines, Head First marks as dramatic a shift from 2008's disappointing Seventh Tree as that album's moodily atmospheric folk did from the fembot stomp of Goldfrapp's prior two LPs (or those from the John Barry-soaked trip-hop of 2000 debut Felt Mountain). Alison's voice is still commanding, gaining a bit of Stevie Nicks huskiness while staying versatile enough to rise to a glassy peal or drop to a suggestive purr. So, too, are Gregory's electronics, from the fist-pumping opening trio of songs to the krautrock seduction and wordless vocal ambience on the second half. First single ""Rocket"" shows Head First at its best, but it's also a reminder of where some of the other songs fall short. When Alison exhorts, ""I've got a rocket/ You're going on it,"" the potential double entendre is obvious. This isn't a come-on, though; with suspicions about ""how she got in the door uninvited"" and a decisive ""you're never coming back,"" it's a lot closer to a kiss-off. (Although not available on the album, Richard X's powerhouse remix is even better.) Still, beyond ""Rocket"", few of the songs here are melodically or lyrically catchy enough to attain anything like the the popularity of the 80s songs they'll remind you of-- or of Goldfrapp's past highlights. An exception is ""Hunt"", which approaches the bedside intimacy of Beach House or White Hinterland through gorgeously breathy space disco. Another is ""Shiny and Warm"", full of Suicide-seeking synths and icy sensuality. Alas, a nine-song album doesn't leave much room for error. Goldfrapp remain excellent in the studio-- any future work they do for Aguilera or anyone else (they also recently scored the soundtrack for John Lennon biopic Nowhere Boy) deserves watching-- and there's plenty of highly stylized fun to be had here. Just don't expect to remember many of the details when it's all over. You might be the best-dressed person at 80s dance night, but if there's nothing particularly noteworthy about you otherwise, nobody's going to recognize you out of costume.","Bringing roller-disco synth-pop out of mothballs gives the UK duo their most entertaining album since electro-glam juggernaut Supernature.

A,Sunburned Hand of the Man,by: Andrew Gaerig,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a8d59d034d5c69bf3b36/1:1/w_160/9bfcc0ec.jpg,2010-03-24 06:00:04,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14059-a/,Ecstatic Peace,"A is the second collaboration between Massachusetts out-rock collective Sunburned Hand of the Man (who frequently go by just ""Sunburned"" now) and Four Tet's Kieran Hebden. Since their last collaboration, 2007's Fire Escape, Hebden has been busy, re-establishing himself as one of electronic music's crossover stars. For Sunburned, well, it's been business as usual: according to this band-endorsed discography, the group has released 48 albums/tapes/CD-Rs and one book since Fire Escape (winning album title from this period: Weekend at Burnie's 2). There's no tip-toeing around the notion that A stands out in Sunburned's catalog mostly because of Hebden's presence. Toning, sculpting, and orchestrating, Hebden again turns Sunburned into an ethereal, electronic version of themselves. Sunburned have kept A close to the vest. Whereas Fire Escape-- released on Norway's increasingly promiment Smalltown Supersound-- received a reasonable promotional push, A is a limited-run, vinyl-only (with download card) release on Thurston Moore's Ecstatic Peace. Recorded live in-studio in Southern Vermont, A feels like the work of a fairly tight group. On Fire Escape, the burly collective was wrangled into Kraut-rock rhythms but retained some of their unkempt chattering and lumbering bass. A, though, smolders and teases. The give-and-take in this collaboration seems sort of obvious: Hebden is freed to waste moments (in a positive way) while Sunburned are gifted with the tightest and most controlled compositions in their considerable body of work. ""Arp and Hammer"" is a rhythm-less tone poem that bridges the record's halves; ""Radish vs. Beet"" contains a whinnying synth that builds a small amount of momentum before being cut off. Four of A's 11 tracks clock under 70 seconds. Sunburned find room for their jams, too, though. ""A Red Rag to a Bull"" features gnarled drum programming and improvisations from the band's usual array of acoustic string instruments. ""Action Figure"" is a wonder, offering a sturdy, dance-able electro-bass and chiming radar blips. Hebden doesn't tame Sunburned so much as direct their energy. The result generates plenty of heat, but it's small and concentrated. Fire Escape retained some of Sunburned's manic bigness; A feels self-contained and distressingly tiny. When the album ends and iTunes rolls into a Finnish live set the band released, a deliriously derivative and silly guitar riff totally erases any memory of ""Alpha, Beta, Adam""'s three minutes of pleasant drone. Sunburned may ultimately be suited to bigger, lesser sounds than A offers. That's fine: Heaven knows Sunburned produce plenty of music without Hebden, too.","Massachusetts out-rock collective again teams with Four Tet, who turns them into an ethereal, electronic version of themselves.

Everyday Balloons,A Weather,by: Rebecca Raber,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a8cc5e6ef959693212b7/1:1/w_160/4d7f7f63.jpg,2010-03-24 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14048-everyday-balloons/,Team LoveBad Panda,"Forget what you've been told about judging books by their covers; you can learn all you need to know about Everyday Balloons-- the second aching collection by Portland quartet A Weather-- from its album art. Its diffuse, bruise-colored skies illustrate not only the band's meteorological obsessions-- it's not just the band name; almost every song here references rain or clouds or ice-- but also the gauzy sound of its music. And just as a brilliant beam of sunlight penetrates the cover's cloudy horizon, the vocals of drummer Sarah Winchester and guitarist/songwriter Aaron Gerber poke through the band's musical haze. Together or separately, her silvery coo and his drowsy whisper cut through the songs' airy, dreamy ambiance with pointed delicacy. Much of what distinguishes A Weather, however, from other gentle, spare singer/songwriters and indie folkies is their albums' thoughtful, high-quality production. Everyday Balloons, like 2008's Cove, is restrained without being sparse and manages to feel cozy without resorting to lo-fi bedroom acoustics. Produced by Adam Selzer (who has worked with the Decemberists and M. Ward), the album has a hard-won sheen. In lesser hands, these sleepy/stoned breakup songs could be mawkish or, worse, forgettable. But grounded in a strong slowcore aesthetic, A Weather smartly strike a balance between lush, evocative instrumentation and concise, essential arrangements. For a band that leaves so much open space in their songs (and therefore creates room for listeners to pay attention to and place emphasis on their lyrics), A Weather have carved out an unusual lyrical landscape. Yes, there is an overarching sadness to their work, but their painstakingly constructed songs never seem personal or confessional. As a result-- rather than feel like hangdog character studies-- they manage to capture both minutely imagined details and suggestive, opaque poetry. Despite the strong melodies and arrangements of LP highlights ""Ducks in a Row"" and ""No Big Hope"", Everyday Balloons falls short of the high watermark set by Cove. Perhaps that's because it is a plugged-in collection, and the band's anesthetized grief is a better match for its acoustic predecessor, or perhaps it's because these more ambitious compositions require swells and segues that the band hasn't quite mastered yet. But despite these faults, the album is still laudably subtle and sadly pretty. And patient listeners will be rewarded.","Portland band effectively translates its once-acoustic slowcore to electric arrangements, with help from producer Adam Selzer (Decemberists, M. Ward)

S-M 2: Abyss in B Minor,Serena-Maneesh,by: Tom Breihan,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a8b49d034d5c69bf3aee/1:1/w_160/786e93c8.jpg,2010-03-24 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14029-s-m-2-abyss-in-b-minor/,4AD,"When Sufjan Stevens turned up in the credits to the self-titled 2006 debut from Norwegian fuzz-rockers Serena-Maneesh, it seemed pretty random-- his fresh-faced orch-pop being about a million vibe-levels removed from their nodded-out lurch. But now, four years later, S-M have finally gotten around to dropping a follow up, and hey, Sufjan's back again, adding barely perceptible instrumental flourishes (vibraphone, flute, piano) to the general maelstrom. Here Sufjan's presence makes a little bit more sense. Like his Scandinavian co-conspirators, Sufjan likes his jams elaborate. And though the absurdly titled S-M 2: Abyss in B Minor might not bring the layered twee overkill of, say, Illinois, it's still busy as all hell. This time around, Serena-Maneesh face down the Loveless challenge more directly and bravely than any of their neo-shoegaze peers. While most effects-pedal new jacks are content to let their guitar whoosh enhance their diffuse hooks, Serena-Maneesh use noise and pop against each other, staging an internal war in every single track. The band does write hooks, but those hooks have to claw their way through layers of wriggling noise to reach sunlight. To get to track two, album-highlight and single ""I Just Want to See Your Face"", you have to make it through ""Ayisha Abyss"", a seven-minute instrumental motorik dirge caked in crackly, inscrutable shards of walkie-talkie chatter. And you'd think ""Face"", a three-minute love song, would prove a lot friendlier, but no, not really. Even there, everything seems to be fighting everything else, as staticy half-formed guitar riffs push against each other, and the melody, while pretty, never quite resolves. Serena-Maneesh make your ears work. More often than not, they reward that work. There's nearly as much XTRMNTR-era Primal Scream here as there is MBV. It's fun just to hear the way they orchestrate all the chaos on a song like ""Honeyjinx"", where, at any given moment, you'll hear quasi-medieval flute-tootles, windchimes, narcotized vocals, and gigantically misanthropic doom-metal riffage. On the album-closing ""Magdalena (Symphony #8)"", acoustic guitars and rippling bongos sweeten the mood but can't pierce the thick, viscous coat of synthetic drone that slathers everything. But the problem with any album that invites this many comparisons to Loveless is simply that it's not Loveless. As on that album, the songs feel like they're whirling so far into the stratosphere that they might fly apart any second. But the basic melodies on Loveless were strong enough to carry the burden of the effects, and the same can't always be said about Serena-Maneesh. Like Primal Scream, they rely a little too much on seething cool when any sort of deeper feeling would go a long way. Elvira Nikolaisen's vocals may have a certain mysterious, icy beauty, but it's not the kind that hints at big things going on beneath the surface. Meanwhile, when her frontman brother Emil sings, he doesn't even have the icy-beauty thing to fall back on. So it's easy to admire the roiling conviction that makes the album go, but it's a lot harder to love the actual songs that that conviction yields.","Scandinavian group finally drops a follow up to its debut, with Sufjan once again adding barely perceptible instrumental flourishes to the general maelstrom.

Dirty Shirt Rock 'n' Roll: The First Ten Years,The Jon Spencer Blues Explosion,by: Stephen M.

Factory,"Led by a refugee from the D.C. punk scene who rejected Dischord for its austerity and embraced the blues for its theatricality, the Jon Spencer Blues Explosion found a way to mix musical styles into a potent cocktail. The band's basic riff is simple: Drummer Russell Simins pounds out brutal rhythms, guitarist Judah Bauer pummels repeated riffs mercilessly, and Spencer channels a frenzied mix of Elvis, Little Richard, and Ross Johnson. With no regard for the previous generation's interpretation of the blues-- Spencer is a living affront to Eric Clapton-- the Blues Explosion take everything tasteless and dangerous and ugly and irredeemable in rock and run with it. Their music is highly crafted and gloriously messy, heavily conceptual but still visceral, serious while also being funny. Nearly two decades after their formation, their music has outlived its superficial provocations and hits with a force that is perhaps even greater now than it was the first time around. Dirty Shirt Rock 'n' Roll surveys the years between their 1992 debut and 2002's Plastic Fang. Unlike the consistently name-checked and beloved Pavement, another Matador band with a new retrospective in stores, the Blues Explosion seem ripe for re-evaluation. The early-2000s garage rock revival and the success of the White Stripes have given us a new context to hear these disarrayed blues-rock excursions, which similarly peel back the layers to get to rock's core elements. In the 1990s, however, when Spencer was a contemporary of Steve Malkmus, Robert Pollard, and Mac MacCaughan, this music sounded so far removed from any particular scene that the band could be easily dismissed as an anomaly. In retrospect, Spencer's real peers may have been the Afghan Whigs' Greg Dulli and Beck, artists who had very specific ideas about how to transform African-American music traditions into a personal style that made sense to the alt-rock nation. Unlike either of them, Spencer borrowed almost exclusively from pre-Beatles sources: blaring mid-century blues riffs, outlandish vocals from some fever dream of the 50s, and no truck with niceties like song structure. Tracks like ""Chicken Dog"" (a great duet with the late Rufus Thomas) and the slithery ""Afro"" meander aggressively, as if demanding and daring you to keep up. ""Bellbottoms"", one of JSBX's better-known singles, doesn't even get started until nearly two minutes in, by which time the band has been hammering away next to a string arrangement by Lalo Schifrin. The song screeches to a halt and peels out again in the direction of a terrifically catchy call-and-response chant. How do the two halves connect? These guys could care less. As the decade wore on, the Blues Explosion began tinkering with their fairly austere sound, which lead to collaborations with Dan the Automator and Alec Empire. If at the time they seemed to have lost the thread, Dirty Shirt Rock 'n' Roll argues that they still held firm to their core values. Moving back and forth in time, with no regard whatsoever for intelligible chronology, the comp holds together remarkably well, like a good live setlist or a friend's mixtape. Guests from Beck to hard-living R&B legend Andre Williams sit naturally with the Blues Explosion's sparer guitar-drums-Theremin breakdowns, suggesting that for all their reliance on decades-old styles and gestures, these gloriously messy songs live in the present. Whatever you or Spencer or anyone else calls it, this music is just as exciting and alienating now as it was then.","This survey of the JSBX's first decade holds together remarkably well and gives a good sense of the band's visceral appeal.

"One Jug of Wine, Two Vessels",Bright EyesNeva Dinova,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a8bbb1335d7bf1699351/1:1/w_160/6dfc6f77.jpg,2010-03-24 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14035-one-jug-of-wine-two-vessels/,Saddle Creek,"In a particularly direct part of one of Conor Oberst's most direct songs, the second verse of ""Nothing Gets Crossed Out"" imagines an escape from the pressures of recording as Bright Eyes: He describes calling his Omaha buddies, having a few (too many) drinks, and just seeing what they could lay on tape, even if it's just for them. So it's understandable that when he finally resurrects the Bright Eyes brand, he forgoes his beloved singer-songwriter releases to instead supersize One Jug of Wine, Two Vessels, a 2004 songwriting collaboration with Neva Dinova that found members of Cursive and Tilly and the Wall filling out the ranks. Surprisingly, Neva Dinova's Jake Bellows gets the better of Oberst on the new material. Perhaps it's a matter of relativity-- Neva's 2008 LP You May Already Be Dreaming was dreary, lacking anything near the Cure-like flanged bass and escalating melodies of One Jug's surprisingly celebratory leadoff track (""Rollerskating""). ""Someone's Love"" hews more toward Neva Dinova's typical barstool lamentations of busted romance, but it's far more ballsy than any of Dreaming's longfaced weepers. The results are decidedly more mixed on Oberst's contributions. Bright Eyes were never convincing as a rock band, and the transparency in which Desaparecidos tried to be a rock band always made it feel hollow. True to form, the distorted guitars prop up the chorus of ""Happy Accident"", but it can't help but come off as forced. Fortunately, Oberst is inspired to dip into the inkwell with his early-decade poison pen, dashing off brutal accusations at what could possibly be an abandoned young mother. But after that fit of inspired bile comes ""I Know You"", where Oberst gets all Colin Meloy with his diction and pronunciation (""brah-mbles"") within a stultifying, heavy-handed rhyme scheme that could pass for a next-level po-mo exercise of Oberst parodying himself parodying Dylan. Don't confuse One Jug's surprising revival as a sign of it being an acknowledged lost classic: Its six tracks are the Saddle Creek collective trying to reconcile emo's mainlined communication with the realest of all musics (non-Nashville country, naturally). All of it holds up fine-- the found sounds never feel tacked-on, and it's a good freeze-frame of a time when Mike Mogis' production really turned a corner. Oberst, too, displays growth here: With its cynical view on companionship and blatant references to cocaine abuse, ""I'll Be Your Friend"" hints at the lyrical direction of Digital Ash in a Digital Urn. But while the brief resurrection of the Bright Eyes name and the reissue of a relatively obscure recording may seem like the Saddle Creek people throwing us a bone, for the most part, the pleasure in making the record is what feels like its enduring quality-- as songwriters, Oberst and Bellows sound more comfortable than challenged here. As a tribute to once prolific and unique songwriting community, One Jug is better served as a reminder of how much outstanding and original music Saddle Creek produced from 2000-2003 rather than a document of it.","Conor Oberst resurrects the Bright Eyes moniker on this reissue, which adds four newly recorded tracks.

It's not that Total Magique has aged poorly; that album, with its multi-lingual lyrics, blistering, noisy synthesizer melodies, and aggressive rhythms, holds up well given the mass exhaustion with its dance-punk genre. But We Are Wolves' overall approach, as proved by their latest, Invisible Violence, has worn thin. Even the band seems bored with their chosen genre, and they can't seem to muster the level of intensity that once set their electro-rock apart. These tepid tunes are spare where their predecessors were crowded with noise, and the mid-tempo dynamic is just animated enough to get asses on the dancefloor but not vigorous enough to inspire a frenzy. The band's buzzing analog synthesizers used to be the weapon of choice, but Invisible Violence favors guitars to drive the songs, leaving keyboards for bass flourishes or electronic decoration. These changes dilute what was once vibrant and original about the band. The best song on Total Magique, ""Fight & Kiss"", pulses with sinister sexual energy and a dangerously relentless beat as Alexander Ortiz sings about volatile passion that conflates fighting and fucking. But the best songs on this new collection are sweaty, almost sweet disco tracks like ""Blue"", with its percolating groove and glossy melody. And the lyrics throughout are softly emotional (""I am going somewhere where my tears won't fall and my heart won't break,"" Ortiz sings on ""Near Fear"") or languorously poetic (the aptly named ""Dreams"" opens with the line, ""Reflection of the moonlight on the suede of my skin""). There's nothing wrong with tempering one's stance or mellowing out-- and to We Are Wolves' credit, the slowest, spaciest numbers here are the most unexpected and most satisfying-- but the driving momentum and risky harshness of past efforts are missed. Invisible Violence finds We Are Wolves losing their taste for gory, carnal aggression, and with it, a little bit of their sense of self.","Montreal dance-punk band mellows out on its latest, and along the way seems to have lost some of its sense of self.

Bassist Alex Bleeker's first solo EP is in front of the Freaks, a gang that's more Crazy Horse than Galaxie 500, and one that happens to include Real Estate frontman Martin Courtney and guitarist Matthew Mondanile. (The former has taken over bass duty, while the latter bangs drums.) The sonics are similarly submerged, but the pop format is much different: this is Strumming Country, tone trumps texture. Bleeker's got a fantastic ear for steering his crew's floating-mattress sensibility toward the classic rock side of things. As instrumental (duh) opener ""Summer"" winds its way into ""Epilogue"", Bleeker signals the shift with some chord-slamming. When the volume jumps, Bleeker begins to whinny in a register as Neil Young-like as the crispy guitar Julian Lynch jabs throughout. That said, the guitar interplay clearly comes from the gut in a way that allows for the kind of total freedom that these dudes and their many stripes of song seem to hold so dear. Lyrically, Bleeker keeps his songs in familiar territory. There's summer and there's spring, and everybody's either hanging out or remembering times when they did. On ""Prisoner of the Past"", Bleeker gets old-timey as he sings about a friendship that's run its course. It's a really short verse before the guitar starts squaking, but in a few lines he (probably inadvertently) bottles up the hypernostalgic vibes that bleed into all of bandmates work, together or alone. It's hard not to notice all the fun that's being had messing around with the rock grid here, the ways in which you can make a trusted blueprint your own simply by stamping it so. When Real Estate jam, they do so in a way that's flush with Courtney's indie rock vision. When Mondanile runs off on his hypnogogic spirit journeys as Ducktails, he solos his way to infinity. Even though each of Bleeker's songs here are ultimately interchangeable in layout, their warmth is not. On ""Animal Tracks"", a blistering cover of a song by Vermont's Mountain Man, the Freaks sing in unison of sipping Barq's root beer and hanging out on a set of backstairs. It quickly recalls Real Estate's ""Suburban Beverage"", a song most easily identified by the chant, ""Budweiser, Sprite, do you feel alright?"" The drink may be different, but the buzz comes from the very same place.","Real Estate member gathers his bandmaters and friends for a low-key classic rock-like record about spring, summer, and hanging out.

It's in this context that Motor City Drum Ensemble's Raw Cuts, Vol. 1 sounds so refreshing: It is straightforward, effusive dance music spun from the most basic of elements, and done very, very well. A showcase for MCDE's eponymous label, Raw Cuts, Vol. 1 compiles three Raw Cuts 12""'s, labelmate Jayson Brothers' debut single, and three exclusive tracks. Clearly indebted to the dance music developed in Chicago and Detroit since the mid-1980s, MCDE (Danilo Plessow, from Stuttgart, Germany) aligns himself with electronic musicians deadly serious about placing music before image. Fortunately, Plessow's music isn't concerned with evasion. Open and melodic, Raw Cuts overflows with warm electric keys and cracking rhythms. Tension is massed then resolved with big, descending chords and wily guitar. Looped vocals roam in and out of the mix like shouts from the other side of the floor. Plessow, though, isn't just toying with 1980s dance nostalgia. Raw Cuts often sounds like dance music constructed by and for people who grew up listening to dusty, 1990s hip-hop. His sliced-up funk and interlocking slogans make ""Raw Cuts #3"" sound like a dissertation-length exploration of a J Dilla beat. ""Raw Cuts #2"" could be a clear-headed, taking-their-medicine Avalanches jam. We associate madcap samplers like those with a certain skittishness, but Plessow's sounds are thrillingly, ingenuously focused. Brothers' contributions nearly split the album in two, both through their placement and their lingering funk. ""Monster Box"" is still electronic music, but its brawny shuffle sounds like it could be the product of a particularly amped backing band. ""All My Life""'s sunken steps provide a base for the symphonic-soul strings. The source material ensures that Raw Cuts never veers into giddy, Technicolor party music, and there are times when these tracks feel like a really great party viewed in sepia tones. Take that as you will, but a slightly muted great party is still a great party. Raw Cuts is your first opportunity to hear the young, ultra-talented Plessow on disc. His warm, everyman house music is as sturdy and lived-in as his adopted hometown.","Stuttgart's Danilo Plessow gathers three 12""'s (and three exclusives) that often sound like dance created by and for people who love dusty, 1990s hip-hop.

In the Court of the Wrestling Let's,Let's Wrestle,by: Jayson Greene,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a8d1b1335d7bf169938a/1:1/w_160/3ac4a996.jpg,2010-03-23 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14055-in-the-court-of-the-wrestling-lets/,Merge,"""We are the men you'll grow to love soon,"" goes one of the catchiest choruses from In the Court of the Wrestling Let's, the wry and lovably buffoonish debut album from London's Let's Wrestle. It's difficult, however, to tell whether they're mocking themselves (as in, ""I'm not about to change any time soon, so get used to this"") or apologizing (""I know I'm a mess right now, but bear with me, I'm working on it""). The tension between those two poles-- refusing to grow up and yearning to move on-- is the emotional engine that drives the band and its impressively confident record. The members of Let's Wrestle are barely out of their teens, which helps explain their uncanny knack for articulating the pain of youth. Despite their age, they take most of their reference points from the shaggy, careening indie rock of the mid-1990s, an era in full force when they were in diapers. Singer/songwriter and guitarist Wesley Patrick Gonzalez ladles big bursts of overcharged guitar onto his winsome pop songs, and his cracked, hoarse voice recalls Dinosaur Jr.'s J Mascis. The songs don't advance so much as stumble drunkenly from one section to the next, and Gonzalez himself is a blurter: ""I've got only one function, and that's to mess things up,"" he admits (or boasts) on ""I'm in Love With Destruction"". The album is full of this kind of compulsive truth-telling-- ""I Won't Lie to You"", a galloping punk tune opens with a devastatingly honest realization: ""No matter how many records I buy, I can't fill this void."" Gonzalez clearly has bought a lot of records though, and while they might not have cured his loneliness, they have boosted his songwriting. You can hear echoes of little-known but well-loved indie and punk bands he has in his collection. Some popular albums, too: Parklife-era Blur make an appearance in ""My Schedule"", in which the narrator offers a deadpan list of all the mundane things he's going to do today. ""Diana's Hair"", a disarmingly mournful ode to Princess Diana, recalls the sort of plainspoken story-songs the Kinks used to pen. All of it is worn pretty lightly, though-- witness the album's title, a completely ridiculous nod to King Crimson and an indicator these kids keep their influences at arms-length, where they can bat playfully at them. On ""Song for Old People"", Gonzalez squints and tries to imagine what happens to you when you grow old; the worst he can come up with is ""their sense of humor may be lost."" Considering that in a recent interview, Gonzalez revealed that he intends to title the band's next record Trout Mask Wrestlica, it seems, for him, those days are far, far away.","The members of this London rock band are barely out of their teens, which helps explain their uncanny knack for articulating the pain of youth.

Greenberg OST,Various Artists,by: Rob Mitchum,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a8bfc0084474cd0c0ecc/1:1/w_160/572325de.jpg,2010-03-23 06:00:00,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14039-greenberg-ost/,ParlophoneDFA,"Playing ""spot the influences"" with James Murphy isn't much fun. Murphy laid out the family tree of LCD Soundsystem on his first single, thanks to ""Losing My Edge""'s famous record-collection pissing contest closing minutes. Absent from that laundry list is the first artist LCD ever covered, Harry Nilsson, whose ""Jump Into the Fire"" was an early live staple and eventual ""Daft Punk is Playing at My House"" B-side. Nilsson's weird 70s run of records approximate an accurate depiction of the L.A. experience, describing in his gentle, decaying falsetto the melancholy beneath the surface of sunny days and movie stars. So what better time for Murphy to indulge his inner Nilsson than when he's given the chance to go Hollywood, handling film score duties for Noah Baumbach's Greenberg. If previews are to be trusted, Greenberg itself finds Ben Stiller's main character down and out in L.A., so voila, the perfect storm for Murphy to finally make his own version of a sadsack record like Nilsson Schmilsson. Nowhere is that more apparent than ""Photographs"", the only song to appear in both vocal and instrumental form among 11 tracks credited here to Murphy. A woozy acoustic guitar and piano ballad, it's as far away from LCD Soundsystem as it is close to being a standard-issue indie film soundtrack piece. It also unfortunately is a succinct portrait of the gulf between Murphy and Nilsson, as the former's voice bears more cracks than a dropped carton of eggs-- more the ""partied all night with John Lennon"" Nilsson of Pussy Cats than the vocal showstopper performance of ""Without You"". Murphy's singing has gotten a lot better since he basically monologued his way through the first LCD singles, but it's still better left disguised on the solo-Lennon howl of ""Oh You (Christmas Blues)"" (credited, strangely, to LCDSS) or the Cecilia-ish folk jam of ""If You Need a Friend"". As far as the non-Murphy tracks, there's no Nilsson song to draw stark comparison. But a substitute measuring stick is provided by Stroke-Dad Albert Hammond, whose ""It Never Rains in Southern California"" is perfect L.A. pop-- depression and misanthropy wrapped in exquisite production. It's also exceedingly passive, which fits thematically with the Steve Miller Band's ""Jet Airliner"", Duran Duran's wonderful ""The Chauffeur"", and Galaxie 500's ""Strange"". Good songs all, but I'm thinking there are a lot of shots of a sad, unshaven Ben Stiller looking out the window and wondering where it all went wrong. With his score, Murphy doesn't do much to shake the main character out of that presumed self-pity. The instrumental numbers here are low-key wallpaper (save the flamenco-style ""Gente"", which sounds more fit for Baumbach's buddy Wes Anderson), and many of the vocal tracks sound sparse and half-realized. It is a peek at a singer-songwriter side of Murphy that we haven't previously glimpsed, but searching for clues about the LCD Soundsystem LP due later this year is probably a futile effort-- Greenberg has side project written all over it. Love letter to Harry Nilsson or Greater Los Angeles, it's partly cloudy; as much as New York may be bringing Murphy down, it's a more appropriate muse.","On this soundtrack for a new Noah Baumbach-Ben Stiller film, LCD's James Murphy shows his singer-songwriter side, often making like Harry Nilsson.

Chant Darling,Lawrence Arabia,by: Stephen M.

There's of course that cinematic pseudonym, alluding to a Hollywood epic almost half a century old. There's also his unyielding devotion to 1960s pop music, which treats the Beatles catalog as untrod territory. But mostly it's the New Zealander's steadfast refusal to join any current pop trend, indie or otherwise, which seems a bit surprising given that Milne has played with the Ruby Suns, the Brunettes, and Okkervil River. He distances himself so far from the present that he actually sounds somewhat distinctive. Pop history, however, is littered with those who have taken up the Fab mantle to high praise, from Jim Noir all the way back to Todd Rundgren and beyond. Which is only to say that Milne is no outsider. His well-schooled command of hooks and pomp does not make him unique, just obsessive and perhaps a bit single-minded. In fact, his debut's primary limitation is that for all his fifth-Beatle vocals and the loose Höfner plunk of his basslines, Chant Darling seeks to imitate, not to innovate. At times it sounds like nothing we haven't heard before, but there are, of course, pleasures to be found in this approach, like the snaky guitar and snappy hook of ""Apple Pie Bed"", the chipper calypso sample that forms the rhythmic foundation of ""Auckland CBD Part Two"", or the decadent languor of ""I've Smoked Too Much"". Milne lets a lot of ideas loose on this album, and occasionally they get away from him. In particular, he has a tendency to repeat phrases and melodies, striving for hynotic but more often achieving tedious. ""The Undesirables"" run its sleepy hook into the ground in just two minutes, and ""The Beautiful Young Crew"" tugs obsessively at its knotty melody. Lyrically, Milne can be slyly witty and genially self-deprecating, as on the opener, ""Like a Fool"". ""I'm on the ground, girl, I'm thrashing 'round,"" he sings. ""It's easy to see what this display is for, to show you what you mean to me."" In addition to anchoring him in the here and now, that sense of haplessness is at direct odds with the song's dapper arrangements; if his thoughts are scattered, his music remains suave and martini sophisticated. Chant Darling doesn't hit strike that balance often enough, and very few of these songs allow such a glimpse of the musician behind them. Ultimately, Lawrence Arabia's carefully tailored influences have the same effect as that stage name, as if Milne was intent on absenting himself from his own album.","Bella Union uproots another 60s pop-loving artist, releasing the U.S. debut from James Milne, who has played with the Ruby Suns and Okkervil River.

Kings Ballad,Georgia Anne Muldrow,by: Patrick Sisson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a8389d034d5c69bf39b7/1:1/w_160/80f273af.jpg,2010-03-22 06:00:03,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13913-kings-ballad/,Ubiquity,"Georgia Anne Muldrow's latest album, Kings Ballad, was supposedly crafted against the backdrop of Barack Obama's early days in office. And just as Obama is, for better or worse, an inspiring figure whose influence isn't quite in sync with his accomplishments, Muldrow can sometimes come across as an amazing artist in theory: She hasn't totally delivered on the promise hinted at by her debut album, Olesi: Fragments of an Earth. It's not her inspirations or intentions that are in doubt. But hope is a campaign, not a governing strategy; similarly, dropping spiritual signifiers and referencing legends Nina Simone and Alice Coltrane doesn't necessarily make great music. But Kings Ballad stands on its own, a vessel for Muldrow's lyrics and beliefs. It sounds more concentrated, cohesive, and restrained than previous albums, especially her binge of releases last year. Soulful where she was occasionally brash, her voice pivots and floats but sounds more grounded and assured, like on ""Doobie Down"", where she calmly vamps over her own coos and chorus (""No apologies, I'll be as black as I want to be""). It flows well, outside of a final stretch of songs seemingly tacked on for variety, including vaguely Latin ""Morena Del Ray"", vocoded sci-fi riff ""Industrial Bap"", and the senseless pop-punk outlier ""Room Punk!"". Throbbing low end plays well with jazzy piano throughout the album, like the riff on ""Indeed"" and the elegiac, descending line on ""R.I.P."", an ode to Michael Jackson that achieves a certain tension by ending on a snapped beat. The instrumental passages, including the liquid funk-lite of ""Chocolate Reign"" and chugging ""R.I.P."", are decent. Her beats aren't the most adventurous take on splashy, one-two rhythms, but they work here. Kings Ballad still doesn't meet all the expectations Muldrow may have initially inspired, but it's a positive, measured sign that there's more to come.","Spiritual singer/producer refocuses for a deeper, more rooted release.

This Is Still It,The Method Actors,by: Andy Battaglia,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a8b8b1335d7bf169934c/1:1/w_160/549a0438.jpg,2010-03-22 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14033-this-is-still-it/,Acute,"The Method Actors thrived in the 1980s in Athens, Ga., in the same scene that gave rise to R.E.M., the B-52's, Pylon, Love Tractor, and many more. This was the Athens shrouded in tangles of wild kudzu and the kind of homey eccentricity on display in the great rock-doc Athens, Ga.-Inside/Out, in which pretty much everyone and everything seems weird in some way. In the liner notes to this great new reissue CD, Method Actors guitarist Vic Varney talks about Athens as an inviting little town and calls Ricky Wilson from the B-52's his ""favorite rock and roll guitar player. Ever."" And R.E.M.'s Peter Buck, no slouch of a guitarist himself, writes of harboring much Method Actors love in his Athens days and standing in front of Varney night after night ""watching his hands and trying to figure how he did what he did."" What Varney did was striking, and really does count as some of the most distinctive post-punk guitar work ever done. The same goes for his bandmate David Gamble, who played drums in a way that was highly versatile and even more highly musical. That was it for the Method Actors: two guys, both with wild styles that grew all the more wild as they grew more tightly coiled. And with the release of this reissue record, This Is Still It, they still sound as thrilling as they did 30 years ago. This Is Still It opens with ""Do the Method"", a blast of a song that sounds like the work of way more than a duo. Varney's guitar traffics in a beautiful mess of open-tuned jangle and jags, with a complex sense of internal melody that could handle the duty of a hook on its own. Gamble's drums fan out and spray the space with frenetic kicks pumped beneath all the splashy cymbals and fills. And then the vocals: a cloying, toying mix [#script:http://pitchfork.com/media/backend/js/tiny_mce/themes/advanced/langs/en.js]|||||| of insouciant sass and arty call-and-response jabs, all delivered with an unhinged sense of preening and play. That's pretty much the Method Actors method condensed, and it plays out to deliriously rewarding and consistent effect on a CD that collects songs recorded from 1980 to 1981. Hints of other sounds from before and after drift in-- DNA, Polvo, Gang of Four, Captain Beefheart-- but the Method Actors sound too wound up in their mania to get distracted by anything from the outside. Here really is a total find from what would almost have to be an empty post-punk vault at this point. And it's a find that sounds like it lost no sleep while waiting around to be found again.","A striking collection from the 1980s Athens, Ga., band, which came up in the same scene as R.E.M., the B-52's, and Pylon.

Oversteps,Autechre,by: Patrick Sisson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a8c9ea9e61561daa58db/1:1/w_160/0792bfc5.jpg,2010-03-22 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14051-oversteps/,Warp,"After more than two decades of recording together as Autechre, Sean Booth and Rob Brown can still create the aural equivalent of whiplash if they want to, or showcase a deep knowledge of dance music. The production duo's energetic 12-hour online radio broadcast from earlier this month-- joyfully tweeted about and linked to by fans-- was a massive, almost exhausting display of influences and favorites. Floating between Coil and Lord Quas, the mix inspired someone to crowdsource the track list on Google Docs. Oversteps takes a much quieter approach, focusing on a smaller scale. Coming after 2008's Quaristice, a varied collection of shorter tracks that originated during live jam sessions, Oversteps leans toward some of the slower, more atmospheric aspects of albums like *Amber (*minus the metered pulse). After the album's initial 20 seconds of silence, the opener ""r ess"" slowly surfaces-- cold, distant synths arc overhead while broken, incomplete rhythms clatter and collide-- seemingly suggesting that steady beats aren't the main focus here. Many tracks, such as ""O=0"" and ""d-sho qub"", do contain propulsive rhythms, and a slow funk and dull handclap seep through ""Treale"". But the textures are where things get interesting. Whether it's from tones floating in space or notes brushing up against each other in quiet but effective dischord, the ambience and atmospheres of Oversteps are haunting. ""st epreo"" expands and contorts with bass notes that seem bound to the rules of fluid dynamics. ""Yuop"" steadily builds and crests with ringing, grandiose synths. Sometimes, the lack of propulsion distracts, like on ""pt2ph8"". But the overlapping round of notes in ""see on see"" points to a clear design within the synthetic ether. Autechre have evoked heavy moods while pushing the possibilities of production technology forward and broadening the vocabulary of electronic music. The famous video for their track ""Gantz Graf"" suggests as much, that they harnessed the grating sounds of a machine in the middle of a grand mal seizure. Oversteps finds them working in a comparatively less rigid fashion, almost organic compared to something like Confield. Focusing on creating tension and release within their compositions, they're still incorporating new designs, not merely repackaging the previous products.","Warp mainstays and techno pioneers pivot slightly with an album of dark ambience and intriguing textures.

Volume Two,She & Him,by: Stephen M.

Actors from Eddie Murphy to Don Johnson to Lindsay Lohan record albums so that we can laugh at their hubris and casually dismiss their efforts. The story is so common it's created a Hollywood archetype: the actor-turned-singer-turned-punchline. But Zooey Deschanel is rewriting the script. With She & Him's Volume One, her first collaboration with M. Ward, she proved that not only could she act, write songs, and sing, but she could do them all very well, with a sparkle of personality glinting in those big eyes and bigger voice. Volume Two picks up almost exactly where Volume One left off, with Deschanel still playing a smart, sensitive young woman often on the unrequited end of love but never letting romantic disappointment get her down: ""Sometimes lonely isn't sad,"" she declares on the stately opener ""Thieves"". She's still the headstrong heroine, though: ""Why do I always want to sock it to you hard?"" she wonders on ""Over It Over Again"", sounding as playfully frustrated as Loretta Lynn. And Ward remains content to cede her the spotlight, toiling behind the camera. He dresses her songs in deceptively simple SoCal folk rock, dusty cowboy-trail country music, and crisp Brill Building pop. The similarities to Volume One don't make Volume Two redundant, but reassuring: It's not typecasting if the role is this complex. On the sequel, Deschanel seems more confident as a singer, songwriter, and vocal arranger. She still has more personality than range, but has learned to maneuver around the parts she can't nail in order to sell them. Transforming herself into her own version of the Watson Twins, Deschanel often backs up herself and channels 1960s country gold classics on the languid ""Me and You"" and the plaintive ""Brand New Shoes"", pointing to older styles but never sounding beholden to the past. Her ah-has and mm-hmms make her cover of Skeeter Davis' ""Gonna Get Along Without You Now"" sound impossibly perky, as if she's lighter for having dumped that creep, and on closer ""If You Can't Sleep"", Ward layers her humming into a gentle orchestra that add [#script:http://pitchfork.com/media/backend/js/tiny_mce/themes/advanced/langs/en.js]|||||| s to the song's lullaby sweetness. He has a lot of tricks like that up his sleeves. If Volume One seemed a bit compartmentalized, each song working one idea or genre, Volume Two sounds much more synthesized as Ward mixes so many styles into each song. It never plays like an M. Ward album, though, as he tailors the music to fit her deceptively simple songs. As Deschanel fashions a romantic metaphor out of the myth of Orpheus, Ward adds some Beach Boys orchestration to reinforce that sense of longing, that rolling snare suggesting a slow, painful look backwards. An unlikely protégé of Owen Bradley, Ward adds countrypolitan strings to many of these songs, but never crowds her vocals or steps on her lines. In fact, it's easy to forget he's even there, so that his verse on their cover of NRBQ's ""Ridin' in My Car"" has the force of a surprise cameo, turning the he-said/she-said story into a hipster Grease. Even as they look to the past for inspiration-- specifically, to some never-was heyday of 60s radio-- they aren't making a period piece on Volume Two. What makes the album so distinctive isn't just the sound of her voice, the quality of her songwriting, or even the resourcefulness of his arrangements, but their joint insistence that these old sounds have as much to say nowadays as they ever did. In that regard, She & Him has given Deschanel her best role yet, one that shows off her charm and intelligence to best effect-- one that she is essentially writing for herself.","Zooey Deschanel and M. Ward refine and improve their sound, creating a sequel that actually improves on the original.

Fly Yellow Moon,Fyfe Dangerfield,by: Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a8b3ea9e61561daa58ac/1:1/w_160/b78e0788.jpg,2010-03-19 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14028-fly-yellow-moon/,GeffenPolydor,"All you need may be love, but love isn't all you need. Look at Fyfe Dangerfield. As lead singer for Guillemots, his swooping vocals helped lead the London four-piece to a Mercury Prize nomination for 2006's Through the Windowpane, a debut album overflowing with ideas and passion. Romantic grandeur and wide-eyed sincerity were part of Guillemots' early appeal, but that group's stylistic adventurousness and avant-garde impulses are all but gone on Dangerfield's solo debut, Fly Yellow Moon. Instead we get syrupy sentimentality and drab earnestness. Fly Yellow Moon sticks to the modest, direct simplicity of classic 1970s singer-songwriter albums. Backed by piano, acoustic guitar, and in places orchestration that dimly recalls Guillemots' lushness, Dangerfield's voice still leaps tall buildings, while his words trade in schmaltzy clichés and his tunes too often fail to assert their own personality. The problem definitely isn't a lack of feeling. The opening whoop of ""When You Walk in the Room"" sets the carefree, love-filled spirit nicely enough, and it's easy to believe Dangerfield when he sings, ""I can't help it if I'm happy."" Some of his former band's knack for atmosphere comes through occasionally, too. On the waltzing, acoustic ""High on the Tide"", children's chatter and seagull's squawks give a beach setting to Dangerfield's delicately voiced professions of happiness. Fly Yellow Moon just can't quite solve that old problem: how to be mushy but not mundane. Dangerfield wants ""to be near you all day"" on the ""Hallelujah""-ish ""Barricades"", to ""put my hands around your heart"" on the ""No Woman No Cry""-ish ""Livewire"", and to ""run circles around you"" on the ""Girl, You'll Be a Woman Soon""-ish ""So Brand New"". ""Firebird"" finds him wanting to re-enact music hall staple ""Daisy Bell"". I'm sure it's all very well-meaning, but it's also saccharine and, in places, a little embarrassing. Before his next outing, let's hope Dangerfield remembers that even Stevie Wonder, that maestro of happy love songs, eventually did ""I Just Called to Say I Love You"".","Guillemots singer trades his band's stylistic adventurousness and avant-garde impulses for the direct simplicity of 1970s singer-songwriter stuff.

So it's curious that almost no one is doing more to boost San Francisco's ascendant art-pop scene. In the past six months alone, Woodsist has put out albums by the Fresh & Onlys, Moon Duo, and the Art Museums. Of the three, the Art Museums-- comprised of Josh Alper (Whysp) and Glenn Donaldson (Skygreen Leopards)-- comes off as the most conventional. Passing on their peers' experimental tendencies, the duo enthusiastically professes the lo-fi indie pop religion of heroes Television Personalities and legendary labels like Sarah, Slumberland, K, and Flying Nun. So the songs on their debut, Rough Frame, are catchy and concise and authentically coated with the gunk of a Tascam 388 tape machine. In fact, their primitive recording equipment is probably the best instrument in the duo's arsenal, which also includes rattling guitars and chintzy vintage synthesizers and drum machines. The Art Museums plead poverty and a desire for spontaneity, but you have to be pretty shrewd to sound this sloppy and this great. Album opener ""We Can't Handle It"" would be a fine pop song if you took a bar of soap to it. But its production debris gives it texture and substance, and the country mile that stretches between its Casio beats and muffled vocals lends the track a mystery that would probably otherwise elude it. Lyrically, the release is just as hyper-conscious. Rough Frame stalks artist-wannabes in their natural habitats-- sculpture gardens and cinemas, rock clubs and hipster parties-- to subtly satiric effect. ""You took your bike to a nearby park/ Was it romantically charged?"" they tease on Guided by Voices-flavored ""Paris Cafés"". Meanwhile, the title track narrates a ""crisis of youth shot in 24 frames"" with beatific harmonies and a straight face. And ""Oh Modern Girls"" surveys the scene from the perplexed perspective of an older guy dating a younger girl: ""These animals in sweater vests/ DIY kids, standard test."" It's obvious where the band's sympathies lie, but I doubt the Art Museums would exempt themselves from their own critique. Responding to a blogger's ""musical inspiration"" query, Donaldson offers up ""modernism, pop art, social commentary, and personal catharsis."" In case his bandmate's meaning isn't crystal clear, Alper adds, ""ecstatic absurdity and blissful reflection on imagined subcultural scenes and the tension of modern life."" Dudes may be calling bullshit on bohemian-like-me posturing, but they also understand their role in the racket. Fortunately, their tunes admit no such ambivalence: Rough Frame is a brief, brilliant set of infectious songs, and you can always ignore the lyrics if you want.","Woodsist continues to explore San Fran's ascendant art-pop scene, here releasing lo-fi indie pop from a duo featuring Glenn Donaldson (Skygreen Leopards).

But that's not the case with Tanlines, the duo of Jesse Cohen and Eric Emm, who arrive at their new project with pretty diverse backgrounds. Cohen comes from the dance-y post-punk act Professor Murder while Emm spent time in dissonant math-rock bands Don Caballero and Storm & Stress, and interestingly Tanlines don't really sound like any of those groups. What they make now is tropical synth-pop that's more indebted to the Tough Alliance and, to some degree, MPP-era Animal Collective. Tanlines are more production team than proper band and, not unlike Barcelona electro-poppers Delorean, their style is inspired as much by club music as indie rock. Straddling the line between dance and pop but hewing more towards the latter, Tanlines put together African percussion, swirling guitars, and dancefloor elements inside catchy, effervescent tracks. Their Settings EP comes on the heels of some early singles and remixes for groups such as Telepathe and finds the duo honing in on a fuller, more developed sound. The record is split evenly between instrumental cuts and vocal tracks, and Tanlines do well with both. The appeal of these songs is primarily sonic (rich, surging arrangements and big clean hooks), so they don't all need words, but when Cohen and Emm do weave in lyrical content, it adds intrigue. The best example is standout ""Real Life"", where Emm gets wistful over knocking percussion and heaving, squeaky synths. ""You might think I'm still that way, it's only natural/ It was a past-life thing, it wasn't anything at all,"" he laments. If you've ever bumped into an ex who dumped you for doing something stupid, you know exactly what he's talking about. Tanlines have a strong pop sensibility and a good working knowledge of global club sounds, and it's this balance that makes Settings an enjoyable listen. They're said to have an affinity for Depeche Mode (not so subtly hinted at here on ""Policy of Trust""), and while that may seem strange with music this sunny, you can hear pretty clearly in Tanlines' tracks their appreciation for hook-heavy dance-pop of all kinds. Not everything on the EP works as well as ""Real Life"" (they lose me a bit on the calypso and hip-hop informed ""Bees""), but mostly Settings functions as a punchy introduction to what these guys do well.","Former Prof Murder and Don Cab guys continue to impress with tropical synth-pop that sounds more like Tough Alliance and AnCo than their former acts.

The Martyrdom of a Catastrophist,Junius,by: Jayson Greene,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a8ac13d19756521396e6/1:1/w_160/66dc0b54.jpg,2010-03-19 06:00:01,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14020-the-martyrdom-of-a-catastrophist/,Mylene Sheath,"Immanuel Velikovsky was a Russian-born Jewish scientist who believed that long ago Earth had suffered several near-catastrophic collisions with Venus and Mars. His alternate vision of the universe, which he laid out in the controversial 1950 bestseller Worlds In Collision, reads suspiciously like the plot to Stargate: ancient mythology, astrology, and astrophysics woven together into the kind of vividly apocalyptic swirl that attracts cults of believers. Velikovsky's theories, unfortunately for him, were debunked by every reputable physicist of the era. It's easy to see the appeal this doomed, charismatic fringe figure might have for a melodramatic goth-rock band. This is where Junius comes in: their second full-length is a loose concept album about Velikovsky's life and trials. He is the ""catastrophist"" of the title, and a recording of his thickly accented voice, straight out of mad-scientist Central Casting, graces the album's opening. Here Junius treat Velikovsky not unlike how metal bands behold Aleister Crowley: a compelling Faustian figure, a man who was punished by society for his forays into forbidden realms of knowledge. Junius are not a metal band, however. In spirit and sound, the Boston quartet are closest to darkwave bands of the 1980s, a kinship that only begins with lead singer and guitarist Joseph E Martinez's pitch-perfect Robert Smith wail. Like the bands they resemble (Tears for Fears, the Cure, and Depeche Mode, primarily), Junius have a knack for translating weepy melodrama into anthemic choruses. Almost every song makes its careful way through a maze of subsections, but this maneuvering is often hidden behind an instantly memorable hook, which tends to make the record's esoteric conceit melt away instantly. ""We are so curious,"" Martinez howls on ""Ten-Year Librarian"", a song that is ostensibly about Velikovsky staying up endless nights to rewrite his life-changing thesis, but a line that probably resonates just as powerfully with sexually repressed teenagers. The sound of the record is similarly stadium-ready. The reverb is cranked to cavernous levels, so that every isolated sound-- the glimmering Interpol-style guitar leads, the hi-hat cymbal washes, the unison ""whoa-oh-oh"" vocals-- spirals endlessly upward into a starlit sky. ""The Antedeluvian Fire"" has tinkling chimes doubling its murmuring, arpeggiated guitars, while waves of Mellotron well up in the background of ""Ten-Year Librarian"". As you would expect from such an 80s-rooted album, there are rich bands of synthesizers here too, and they shimmer darkly from every corner of the mix. Taken as a whole (as it demands to be), Catastrophist is a rich, immersive experience, a bleak jewel of a record that takes obsession as its theme and rewards it in equal measure.","Boston band inspired by the darker end of new wave crafts an engaging concept album about a fringe scientist.

jj n° 3,JJ,by: Joe Colly,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a8c3c0084474cd0c0eda/1:1/w_160/9df75474.jpg,2010-03-19 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14045-jj-n-3/,Secretly Canadian,"We knew next to nothing about Swedish duo jj when their debut arrived last summer, but it hardly mattered because the music communicated so much on its own. jj n° 2 was a cosmopolitan record that took its cues from a variety of genres-- Balearic dance, bookish indie pop, and hip-hop-- but put them together in classic Swedish fashion with loads of hooks. It was breezy without being drifty, humorous without being goofy, and even tender and romantic when it needed to be. The production was effortlessly bouyant-- its tropical synths and stuttering beats propping up cooing vocals-- and even during a season that saw no shortage of balmy sounds, the album still felt like a warm gust of Mediterranean air. Since then jj have revealed their identities (Joakim Benon and Elin Kastlander from Gothenburg, it turns out) and after justifiably wide praise for jj n° 2, moved from boutique imprint Sincerely Yours to the larger Secretly Canadian. And even though it's only been about eight months since their debut was released, jj already have the follow-up, jj n° 3, ready to go. It isn't clear what prompted them to put the album out so quickly (maybe they wanted to capitalize on all the attention, maybe they're just prolific songwriters) but despite a couple of memorable tracks, jj n° 3 is uniformly worse than its predecessor and a curious step down for the group. Song to song, the album lacks the charm and melodies of jj n° 2, but even on a general level there's a tonal shift here that doesn't suit jj well. Instead of narcotized, sun-drenched pop, the duo have embraced a softer, bleary sound that at worst feels almost New Age-y or Enya-esque. It's a bit like the detour fellow Swede El Perro Del Mar took with her second album, From the Valley to the Stars, in which she embraced darker, more somber textures to mixed effect. As fans, we of course expect artists to explore new styles, and the party line on jj n° 3 is that it's intended to be a winter record instead of a summer one; the problem here is that the album simply sounds adrift. With wispy, beat-less production, tracks like ""And Now"" and ""Light"" are slight-- the type of songs you hear and then instantly forget. The record does have its moments, but they don't come often. One of the endearing things about jj n° 2 was its use of chart hip-hop, most notably the druggy Lil Wayne semi-cover ""Ecstasy"". They repeat that trick on opener ""My Life"", copping Wayne's verse from the Game song of the same title. It's not as cute the second time around, but there's still something appealing about hearing Kastlander sing lyrics like, ""They say you ain't grindin' until you die,"" in her honey-coated vocal manner. Late in the record, the perky ""You Know"" also stands up to the quality of jj n° 2, but between these tracks is mostly B-side fare. It's a shame, but I don't get the sense listening to jj n° 3 that jj's best work is behind them. Let's hope this is a temporary setback.","Cosmopolitan Swedish group follows a record that took cues from Balearic dance, bookish indie pop, and hip-hop into a heavy-lidded stunner.

Masks EP,Double Dagger,by: Grayson Currin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a8b1c0084474cd0c0ea7/1:1/w_160/e794027e.jpg,2010-03-18 06:00:04,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14026-masks-ep/,Thrill Jockey,"The Thrill Jockey Records bio that accompanies Masks, the follow-up EP to last year's exhilarating More, includes a list of 74 bands to which Baltimore trio Double Dagger have been compared. From Weezer to At the Drive-In, Fugazi, the Presidents of the United States of America to Sonic Youth, the index makes clear this band bashes out anthems that recall post-punk and alternative rock heroes. No, it's not exactly original stuff, but, at their best, Double Dagger feel fresh and urgent. Each song is like another alarm clock ringing. That makes ""Imitation is the Most Boring Form of Flattery"", Masks' opening shot, the perfect gambit. Like a thick shot of Red Medicine, Double Dagger rises into a scrim of noise. ""Look out, kids! We're all in danger. Our history has no future. Don't be just another repeater. Our history has no future,"" singer Nolen Strals and bassist Bruce Willen shout together, offering the hook as a preamble. Strals rails against those who simply offer pale versions of old records for an easy ride into mass consumption. But Strals questions himself here, too, especially given that list of inspirations: ""You don't see the past as a source of inspiration/ You just have it sat at your final destination."" At first, I misheard this lyric, so that it felt as if he were contemplating his own guilt, allowing for interpretation: Is it that when you accept your influences at face value, you die, or is it that you haven't reached creative fulfillment until you acknowledge that art is bigger than your own ideas? But given the list of comparisons the band recognizes, it works more as a credo-- never be satisfied with sounding too much like anyone. If you do, beware: ""I guess how it went is just how it goes,"" he recapitulates, shrugging it off and barreling ahead. Despite its instrumental ferocity and sharpened focus, Double Dagger never take themselves too seriously, eschewing some of the proselytizing of their previous albums. The EP is both hilarious and furious, poking fun to prove bigger points. On ""Pillow Talk"", for instance, Strals relates half a dozen ribald tales of sexual deviance-- the woman who wants to suck on her friend's stinky feet; the man who thinks his way through sex with his girlfriend so he doesn't cry out ""Bob""; the guy who hopes to be bound but fears what his partner will think when he brings the rope into the bedroom. But Strals isn't out for laughs. ""If I could leave you with one bit of advice,"" he says, ""whisper in their ear how you want it tonight."" Likewise, ""Sheep in Wolf's Clothing"" revels in the sort of linguistic back flips its title suggest, stringing a handful of good-for-nothing catch phrases together. Even the seven-minute ""Sleeping with the TV On"", which tackles unfaithful friends, high taxes, health insurance, raised rent, and generally bad situations, is a love song of sorts. With all the reasons in the world to be nervous, or to sleep beside the adult nightlight of a Lifetime rerun, he'd like a little comfort and companionship. At least until the next alarm clock rings.","Baltimore trio and Wham City vets bash out often-funny anthems that recall post-punk and alternative rock heroes.

Be Brave,The Strange Boys,by: Zach Kelly,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a89b13d19756521396be/1:1/w_160/a2b21fd0.jpg,2010-03-18 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14005-be-brave/,Rough TradeIn the Red,"Austin's the Strange Boys debuted last year with The Strange Boys and Girls Club, a play-it-loose collection of twangy garage tunes suited for pool hall scuffles. It was an album content to play well within a defined set of parameters and found them tinkering with rockabilly, 1960s R&B, and British Invasion rock. It's easy to imagine the Strange Boys could churn out sets of these half-drunk shakers forever, and considering how well they did pull it off, that seemed like something to look forward to. But follow-up album Be Brave isn't Girls Club II. It's far less boisterous, unafraid to slow things down and let the band stretch out a little. Though still alive with rambling charm, loneliness hangs over much of album, nurturing a more introspective feel. ""Life changed on you again,"" frontman Ryan Sambol mentions at the beginning of ""A Walk on the Bleach"", in his unmistakable early Dylan yowl. And indeed, something seems to have changed for the Strange Boys, as they no longer have a need to get their Ya-Yas out on every track. Be Brave is a cleaner, more mature look, peppered with feelings of unease and imparting a greater focus on country, blues, and a little balladeering. Most of Be Brave is marked by mid-tempo numbers that give the band a little space to play around with rootsier incarnations that favor bits of organ, piano, and plenty of twangy guitar. The jauntier songs tend to have a woozy, communal appeal, like opener ""I See"" or the saloon-piano accented ""Da Da"". Fans of Girls Club will find joy in the title track, a thrilling little slice of twist-inducing primal R&B (augmented by a warped sax break, courtesy of the now-disbanded Mika Miko's Jenna Thornhill). But the majority of the album takes on a different shape, taking great care to show some restraint even when it seems unnatural. The Strange Boys have proved to be great attention-grabbers but seem a little lost when things get too quiet. The three acoustic ballads that round out the album are a little dull, and the Boys' cautious pacing doesn't always hold up to close listening. A lot of these moments leave you feeling antsy, with hope that another one of their deranged sock-hop jams might be lurking somewhere around the corner. But the key to Be Brave is allowing the band to dig around, and the rewards-- while occasionally a little slow in coming-- reveal that the Strange Boys can offer more than just a quick fix. For a band formerly so brash and unhinged, it's a bold look in its own way.","This raucous Austin band's second album dials back some of the garage rock intensity in favor of introspective songs with a more emotional tug.

Sweet Sister EP,Annuals,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a89ac0084474cd0c0e73/1:1/w_160/fbcc71a7.jpg,2010-03-18 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14004-sweet-sister-ep/,Banter,"In the career-defining profile of Annuals that appeared in the 2007 music issue of Oxford American, the North Carolina band came off as the mid-2000s equivalent of the slacker: the easygoing multi-tasker. Their 2006 debut, Be He Me, a timely mix of Animal Collective before they went electronic and Arcade Fire before they went morose, had them positioned to be an ideal test case for the starmaking ability of blogs. But bandleader Adam Baker and crew seemed just as excited and invested in their various electro side projects as they were in their meal ticket. It was hard not to jump to conclusions about focus when 2008's major-label Such Fun showed no interest whatsoever in upping the ante. Its title seemed like a weirdly deadpan admission of defeat. So is the self-produced Sweet Sister EP just Annuals taking a hands-on approach out of necessity? In any case, they've cemented themselves as a rootsier Yeasayer, still endlessly curious about studio gadgetry and electronic composition but doing little to hide serious hopes of a H.O.R.D.E. tour revival. Just try to keep a running tally of every sonic doo-dad that pops up during the driving, Latin-tinged rhythm of ""Loxstep""-- is that a tabla hooked up to a wah-wah pedal or a jaw harp? Did they just put some Swizz Beatz turntable-scratch effect on Baker's voice? Check out all those bells and whirring synth lines! Their previous work was hardly minimalist, but their arrangements have become increasingly ostentatious in display of new toys. On the title track, bongos percolate and crystal-clear guitar peals evoke Mediterranean nylons, suggesting the word ""Balearic"" has been used on the Annuals tour bus. And then ""Holler and Howl"" does a Texas two-step immediately after, and it's hardly a harsh transition. I still haven't mentioned the melodies or lyrics yet, which underscores what made Such Fun such a worrying listen. The band's debut stood out more for its youthful exuberance-- embarrassingly/memorably portrayed as ""magic coming out my ass""-- than any of its songwriting substance. And youthful exuberance isn't exactly a renewable resource. Baker has all but abandoned Be He Me's unhinged yelping, favoring a more plaintive EveryIndieDude tone that suits the dusky atmosphere of ""Turncloaking"" but doesn't offer much that sticks. Likewise, the lyrics rarely stand out except for the occasional hippy-dippy homily: ""I can't get high, but I can get lost,"" ""Love is what keeps you kind,"" things like that. It shouldn't be a surprise that ""Flesh & Blood"", a song not written by Annuals, is by a wide margin the most memorable song here. The light countrypolitan glaze laid on the Johnny Cash song indicates that Annuals take neither themselves nor their source material too seriously. But the lyrics' yearning for something tangible and substantial ultimately feels at odds with what Sweet Sister, promising surface and all, actually brings to the table.","The North Carolina band's studio work grows increasingly intricate, even here on a self-produced follow-up to their major label debut.

Massa Hypnos,Awesome Color,by: David Raposa,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a8b55e6ef95969321288/1:1/w_160/9643ad2d.jpg,2010-03-18 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14030-massa-hypnos/,Ecstatic Peace,"After two intermittently enjoyable albums rehashing the sounds of Detroit Rock City, one would hope Massa Hypnos would find Awesome Color accomplishing one of two things: either kicking out jams that sound less like mimcry or mastering the moves they've copped and produce a high-quality Stooges/Nugent knock-off. When album opener ""Transparent"" starts, with a need for speed that trades paint with Deep Purple's ""Highway Star"", it seems like Massa Hypnos is just going to be business as usual. If only. Nipping on the heels of ""Transparent"" is ""Flying"", which proves Awesome Color are equally adept at dispassionately ripping off indie rock. With its effect-free, strummy guitars and singer/guitarist Derek Stanton doing his best Thurston Moore imitation, the group comes up with a Dirty-era outtake even Sonic Youth completists could live without. It's a half-hearted attempt to diversify Awesome Color's already derivative portfolio, and it's sadly not the last on the album. It's a shame, too, because when Awesome Color is cookin', and you can forgive their lyrical sins (and your copies of Raw Power and Paranoid aren't handy), they're a decent sludge-loving rock band. If that seems like too many hoops to jump through, you're right, but hear me out. ""Oaxaca"" finds the group working an insidious shuffling groove to great effect. It not only acts as the perfect backdrop for a fuzzy psych'd-out guitar solo that fills the song's final third, but it also distracts from the tune's corny lyric about escaping New York City because ""Everyone's in a hurry/ And the noise is getting old."" Unfortunately, ""Vision"" is the only other tune on Hypnos that recalls the ""classic"" Awesome Color sound, and for every track on the album that highlights Awesome Color's limited strengths, there are plenty illustrating how limited those strengths actually are. The most egregious is ""Zombie"", which finds Awesome Color all but asking for Alice Cooper to sue them. Then again, I'm not sure Cooper would want to have anything to do with this ""I'm Eighteen"" knock-off's woe-is-society metaphor. The less said about a shaggy blues groaner like ""Slaughterhouse"" (or, as Stanton sings it, ""slaaawter hawwwwss""), the better. And as a reward for making it all the way through the album, there's the played-out freakout at the ass end of ""IOU"". The album's eight tracks total only 36 minutes, but Massa Hypnos seems twice as long, and wears out its welcome in a fraction of that time. Back in 2006, writing about their eponymous debut, Marc Masters suggested that ""it would be unfair to say Awesome Color won't eventually grow into something more unique."" Four years and two albums later, Awesome Color find themselves burning through reams of tracing paper, waiting for a growth spurt that might never come.","Ecstatic Peace! band continues to mine sludgy Detroit rock like the Stooges and the Nuge, and now mines classic indie rock as well.

Stuck on Nothing,Free Energy,by: David Bevan,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a8c0c0084474cd0c0ed0/1:1/w_160/a227f585.jpg,2010-03-18 06:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14040-stuck-on-nothing/,AstralwerksDFA,"Since Free Energy popped up on the grid a year ago, they've seemed out of place in a good way. No matter how flexible the definition has always been, they are not what you might call an ""indie rock"" band. It started with the five Philadelphians' first mpfree single last spring, ""Dream City"". The song is a distinctly American take on glam-boogie that immediately brings to mind teenage imagery: cruising around with friends late at night; inhaling bad beer way before you legally should; bottling the kind of wide-eyed, wild-haired feeling that galvanized Richard Linklater's Dazed and Confused. It has a huge, classic rock hook. It's frothy and light and waxed to a shine. It is both hopelessly hopeful and unabashedly corny. It is also really, really fun. The rest of Stuck on Nothing, their long-incubating debut full-length, doesn't hold back either. Produced by James Murphy (and released on DFA, his braintrust for New York dance/cool), it's stuffed with equally ham-fisted hooks and melodies, all of which hit their marks without apology or guile. The band (formerly members of the Pavement-worshipping St. Paul, Minn., outfit, Hockey Night) hooked up Murphy simply by sending him demos of all the songs here. Since then, he took them into the studio to flesh everything out. And flesh he did: from cowbell to strings to Hammond to sax, 1970s studio flourishes gussy up all corners of the recording. The guitar sounds are rich and creamy, the bass fat and warm. In a way, Murphy's production work here is such an integral part of the vibe, he comes off as a sixth member of the band. Everything pops, but the gloss never makes the songs here feel processed or too glossy. It simply fits them well. And the songs are strong, too. From end-to-end, hooks come easy and freely. When the Les Pauls first bite down in opener ""Free Energy"", it's with purpose. What's most surprising about is how well the album stands on its own two legs, despite the fact that it feels like a rock'n'roll period piece. But if you dig deeper into the heavy of ""Bad Stuff"" or whir of ""Light Love"", you can get a sense of how and when these guys likely came across Thin Lizzy records. Namely, through rock touchstones of their youth, like Weezer's Blue Record or even Green Day's Dookie or Pearl Jam's Ten. In that regard, this is classic rock as interpreted by guys who heard those sounds second or third and not first. Stuck on Nothing feels like a healthy game of Rock Band, just without the console and TV around. Their devotion to the many clichés (see: karate kicks, drumstick twirls, the dueling guitars of highlight ""Hope Child"" and er, sleeveless tees) is about as firm as frontman Paul Sprangers is to hammering his lyrical M.O. home. He wants to wring the night of everything it's worth. He breezes through a few volumes' worth of conversational, inspirational poesy that's bound to send a few of you into fits of cringe. But, the fact that it's all delivered so un self-consciously is very refreshing. Much the same way kids shoot hoops pretending to be Michael or Kobe or LeBron, these dudes are doing the same with classic rock. And the posing and pastiche sound great.","James Murphy-produced DFA band bottles the wide-eyed, wild-haired feeling that galvanized Richard Linklater's Dazed and Confused.

Polaroid Piano,Akira Kosemura,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a87fb1335d7bf16992c7/1:1/w_160/fb8289e5.jpg,2010-03-17 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13980-polaroid-piano/,Someone Good,"As the title suggests, Akira Kosemura's entrancing Polaroid Piano is a wistful meditation for minimal piano and field recordings, bleached out with old light. The glitchy electronics of Kosemura's prior work are gone. The music is so hushed you can hear the action of the pedals, the keyboard shifting in the body of the piano. This quiet rumpus serves as a relaxed rhythm track-- one suspects Kosemura mic'd the piano to capture these extraneous sounds, drawing them purposefully into the music. The gesture is Cagean, but the questioning, wonder-filled style is pure Satie. The cover art captures the mood perfectly, although a blue sky filled with kites and balloons would have been just as apt. Music described approvingly as ""childlike"" strives for a rich, timeless simplicity that makes us forget about the constructed world we worry over. Polaroid Piano is stuffed with this feeling, not to mention some more blatant signifiers. A toy xylophone plinks through the sustained piano and softly rubbed acoustic guitar strings of ""Higari"".  On ""Sign"", birdsong twitters above the tentative piano phrases, while the faint sound of acoustic guitar ripples forward and backward. On ""Tale"", Kosemura cuts to the chase with a field recording of children playing over xylophone and sleigh bells. Bound to be the most divisive moment on the record, ""Tale"" will make your eyes either roll or tear up. A few pieces break Polaroid Piano's mold in careful ways. On ""Tyme"", the busiest piece here, the greater speed and density of the notes makes the clunks and creaks of the piano sound like an old copy machine. On ""Guitar"", guitar and piano notes blur amid crackling, fiery sounds and lightly scratched strings. And closer ""Venice"", the album's longest piece, is contrastingly liquid, with piano swirling against the lulling sound of water flowing calmly. Because it's so transient and mild-- 10 pieces flow by in less than half an hour-- the album, paradoxically, expands with multiple listens. It feels impossible to get tired of, circumscribed and boundless at once, and it's so subtle that you might let it spin two or three times before you start to notice the repetition.","Japanese composer crafts a wistful and gorgeous meditation for minimal piano and field recordings.

Message From the Tribe: An Anthology of Tribe Records 1972-1976,Various Artists,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a8c1b1335d7bf1699362/1:1/w_160/020f68aa.jpg,2010-03-17 06:00:03,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14046-message-from-the-tribe-an-anthology-of-tribe-records-1972-1976/,Universal Sound,"People play music for many reasons: to express something personal, act cool, meet people, have fun-- maybe even to make money. Sometimes, people play music because they want to belong to a community. And once in a while, community-driven sounds intersect with a historic and political moment, and music takes on special significance. Such was the case with the Tribe, a creative collective founded in Detroit in 1972 by trombonist Phil Ranelin and reed player Wendell Harrison and whose media arm included a label and quarterly magazine. The Tribe was born out of the African-American consciousness of the Civil Rights era, and its mission was to further the cause of black empowerment. Its magazine featured news and editorials on the issues of the day-- busing, government corruption, the dimming economic climate-- alongside discussion of music. The label issued the work of area musicians, some of whom made a living as session players for Motown (the company left Detroit for L.A. the year Tribe was founded) while simultaneously pursuing jazz. Everything about the Tribe was local, intent on reflecting and documenting the surrounding community. There was a lot of uncertainty in Detroit in the early 1970s-- the auto industry was declining, parts of the city had been destroyed during riots in the late 60s, and population was in the early stages of a long, dramatic decline. The Tribe was a group of people banding together, trying so sort through it all as it happened. Message From the Tribe, originally issued in 1996 and now re-issued by Soul Jazz's Universal Sound imprint with new packaging, gives an overview of Tribe's output during its five-year run. The music is most striking for its eclectic, without-borders approach: though ""jazz"" is an appropriate catchall term and the music feels of a piece, the individual tracks defy easy categorization. In the notes, comparisons are drawn between the Tribe's mission and that of Chicago's Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians, but the music here is comparatively accessible, with a steady, danceable pulse, and it never veers into avant-garde abstraction. Ranelin, represented as a leader on three of the comp's 12 tracks, plays jazz, but he was ultimately re-discovered [#script:http://pitchfork.com/media/backend/js/tiny_mce/themes/advanced/langs/en.js]|||||| by the rare groove set, which gives an idea of his dedication to hypnotic rhythm. While his ""Vibes From the Tribe"" combines the ethereal harmonic drift of Miles Davis circa Nefertiti with the bass-driven grooves concurrently being explored by Herbie Hancock, ""For the Children"", though certainly still jazz, finds him singing as well as soloing on trombone. The music billed to the Tribe-- basically an all-star band drawn from members of the collective, including Ranelin and Harrison-- ranges from the nimble funk blowing session ""Beneficent"" to the politicized message of hope ""What We Need"", with vocals by Jeamel Lee. Another vocal cut, Doug Hammond's ""Moves"", is a strange and haunting ballad featuring Hammond's earthy voice trading melodic lines with violin, Fender Rhodes, and Moog. The music from Message From the Tribe is strong, a great set of open-minded and accessible jazz from an exciting time in the music's history. But the full impact of the package, which includes a 60-page booklet featuring reprints from the magazine along with postcards containing additional covers from the publication, provides depth. Looking through the essays and news alongside the advertisements for black-owned businesses, the music's context as the center of a community becomes clear. There's an article by a student from Wayne State University on Watergate, a piece outlining the basics of the then-current recession, and a feature on Jesse Jackson's burgeoning Operation PUSH. There are also music reviews and interviews. In Tribe-- ""Detroit's First Magazine for Black Awareness"" was the subtitle-- the lines between politics, activism, art, and entertainment are not just unclear: No one seemed to see any reason to draw them in the first place. When you spend so much time enjoying the easy benefits of commitment-free consumption, it's easy to forget about such possibilities.","Soul Jazz reissues the work of this Detroit jazz collective, most striking for its eclectic, without-borders approach.

In late 2008, the Vermont native, who also writes and records on his own as King Tuff, had some new songs to share. He was too scared to play them out alone, so for one show he threw together a band with Chris Weisman on bass and Ruth Garbus (sister of tUnE-yArDs' Merrill Garbus) on drums. It went over pretty well. They decided to keep playing together, and four gigs later, Sub Pop snapped the trio up. Thomas' songs can take your breath away that easily. As King Tuff, he developed a committed DIY following by sticking close to the textures of 70s power pop and glam-- T. Rex and Flamin' Groovies are two handy reference points. As Happy Birthday, Thomas and his bandmates still hang out with those sounds some, but they've also combined to make a two-faced blend of twee and grunge, a pretty natural fit for their label. Aesthetically and sonically, few other subgenres could be further away from one another, but the meet-up is a great idea executed really well. Thomas glues the pretty (Garbus' vocals) and ugly (his own screeching, see also: his work singing in Witch) together with fantastic melodies, at times so plentiful they bury one another. He also has a tendency to vocalize his guitar melodies, an effect that makes for heavy layering, burying some of his best hooks. (In opener ""Girls FM"", a haymaker single that's already been making the web rounds, listen closely to how Thomas' guitar twists during its runs through the coda.) But the songs that bulldoze you grant all of their moving parts a similar amount of space. ""2 Shy"" is a clinic in vocal harmonizing, and ""Pink Strawberry Shake"" is the kind of AM gold David Vandervelde's been going in circles searching for recently. Lyrically, however, Thomas spends a lot of time indoors, framing himself as an acne-splotched teen who enjoys no successes communicating with or courting the opposite sex. And without question, the sly romance of ""Subliminal Message"" is the crown jam here: four minutes of sugar featuring a behemoth, synth-hinged chorus that he should share with that girl ASAP. Happy Birthday falter only when Thomas chooses to burp all over a song when he should just let breathe. On ""Perverted Girl"", he forgoes a bridge by wrenching some sore-throated wails and racket in there instead. Or maybe it's a bridge. That short blast of scuzz and scream works perfectly within the bratty punk of ""Zit"", Thomas' refrain, ""Now I wanna break shit/ Don't want to make shit/ Just want to waste it""-- a pretty funny line coming from a dude who's rumored to have stockpiled huge numbers of songs in his room. He should definitely keep them coming.","Sub Pop group marries two of the PacNW's great musical legacies-- twee and grunge-- with surprisingly great effect.

Besides being on Frenchkiss, a label with a great recent track record of locating bands with quality plus commercial appeal (Passion Pit, the Antlers, Dodos, Local Natives), FW sound on the surface a lot like 00s Indie Hall of Famers Arcade Fire, Ben Gibbard, and Sufjan Stevens. Freelance Whales have plenty of band-camp orchestrations, complete-sentence lyrics, and banjo; but their predecessors' work was so resonant because it felt birthed out of necessity and populated with real people and relatable emotion. Here, everything is based in stunted adolescence and rote ideas-- you almost wonder if they think storks bring babies to this world. The cloying overload starts with ""Hannah"", wherein frontman Judah Dadone empties a vault of Manic Pixie Dream Girl clichés-- martinis, balconies, chance encounters on spiral stairs. He also unveils an early contender for the most eye-gouging lyrical run of 2010: ""Every now and again she offers me a lemon Now & Later/ Please don't play the matchmaker/ Please don't be a player hater/ If you dig her recent work/ You should go congratulate her."" They should've just been up front and titled this song ""Zooey"". Most of Weathervanes is serviceable modern rock, so it will find an appreciative audience despite its egregious derivativeness and a lyricist who seems like he'd use the word ""inebriated"" to talk about how drunk he got last night. ""Kilojoules"" fascinates itself with bodily function in a manner similar to Death Cab's ""Tiny Vessels"" or ""We Looked Like Giants"", but while Gibbard's lyrics were awkward in a vitally hormonal way, Dadone's are awkward merely as a result of bad poetry: ""You liken me to a vampire/ My left hand was wearing fake plastic teeth all winter."" ""Ghosting"" doesn't trust the understated delicacy of its acoustic motif enough to convey beauty, so it dumped an entire Christmas' worth of bells and choirs over stilted nostalgia. Freelance Whales are a far cry from the unforgivable Owl City, but it's kind of amazing this Nick & Norah-core is both surviving and thriving. At this rate Death Cab are staking out Pearl Jam status in the 2010s, i.e., a band that gave many astute listeners an entry to more outré sounds but ultimately became reviled for the shitty music they, through no fault of their own, inspired. Now that the Etsy set's poet laureate has married its prom queen, you wonder if guys like Freelance Whales are trying to draw a wedge between Gibbard and Deschanel by somehow sullying both of their work. As a document of high-concept revenge, Weathervanes is actually kind of fascinating. Alas, that's likely not to be the case, and as just plain music it's not very fascinating at all.","Frenchkiss, lately locating quality bands with commercial appeal (Passion Pit, Antlers, Dodos, Local Natives), here offers a crappy one with commercial appeal.

Big Echo,The Morning Benders,by: Larry Fitzmaurice,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a86e5e6ef959693211ec/1:1/w_160/483ef99c.jpg,2010-03-17 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13965-big-echo/,Rough Trade,"Album titles can often sum up the albums themselves. Case in point: the Morning Benders' 2008 debut, Talking Through Tin Cans, a collection of boilerplate indie rock that borrowed more than a bit from the Shins' jangle pop. Despite a few bright spots, the record branded the San Franciscan outfit with a second-tier reputation. Add that to the fact that the Shins aren't groundbreakers themselves, and Talking Through Tin Cans begins to sound as limited as the rudimentary children's activity suggested in its title. The title to the Benders' sophomore effort and Rough Trade debut, Big Echo, appropriately evokes their sonic shift in the past two years. The album is a homecoming of sorts, as it finds the Morning Benders correcting their PacNW indie pop identity crisis in favor of a more coastal, kaleidoscopic California haze. It also finds them embracing the cavernous experimental rock sound of Grizzly Bear, whose Chris Taylor shares a co-production credit with Benders singer/guitarist Christopher Chu. Big Echo kicks off with ""Excuses"", a sunny, lilting little ditty that carries simultaneous debts to 1950s pop balladry and Sgt. Pepper's-inspired orchestral mania. The song is an easygoing and excellent introduction to the Benders' stylistic changes, and its charming melody serves as an adequate explanation as to how these guys got so many San Franciscan music notables into one room to perform the tune for videographers Yours Truly. The trio that follow ""Excuses"" round out Big Echo's more accessible front-end and come closest to the Benders' previous, less complicated sound. Even then, the band finds ways to add touches of weirdness to each track. ""Promises"" may be just another song about an uncertain relationship, but the song's big-beat thump and tangled voices add something sticky to the bittersweet presentation. The simple shuffle of ""Wet Cement"" is augmented by scale-sliding background vocals, while the economical ""Cold War (Nice Clean Fight)"" features glockenspiel to accentuate its ramshackle charm. Big Echo's second half is slightly slower and swampier than its first; it's also where the band's newfound Grizzly Bear influence comes through clearest, from the jagged guitars that crack open ""Hand Me Downs"" to the breathy, multi-part swooning of ""Pleasure Sighs"" and ""Stitches"". Taylor's studio presence is all over Big Echo, from the warped music-hall strings of ""Excuses"" to the hymn-like, soft-focus vocals on album closer ""Sleeping In"". This cavernous production gives Big Echo another titular double-meaning, lending gravitas and providing guitarists Christopher and Jonathan Chu room to stretch amidst the wooly arrangements. Giving too much credit to Taylor's influence and direction, however, undermines the Morning Benders' stylistic transition, one any band would envy and many listeners will love. Many bands spend entire careers trying (and failing) to even nail down the one thing they're good at. The Morning Benders have already found a handful. Here's hoping they continue down the path illustrated on Big Echo's gorgeous oil-painted album cover: into the unsure seas, and away from the relative safety of stable terrain.","San Fran baroque-pop group takes a nice step forward on its sophomore album, thanks in part to pristine production from Grizzly Bear's Chris Taylor.

Gay Singles,Hunx and His Punx,by: Rebecca Raber,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a8a613d19756521396d8/1:1/w_160/cd3da5ff.jpg,2010-03-16 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14015-gay-singles/,MatadorTrue Panther,"Despite the fact that Gay Singles is Hunx and His Punx's trashy-excellent first full-length, you may be familiar with the group's frontman Hunx, aka Seth Bogart, whether you know it or not. Perhaps you know him from his keyboard and vocal duties in Oakland's garishly theatrical, ambisexual band Gravy Train!!!!. Or perhaps you recognize him from his very naked appearance in the ""hardcore"" version of his labelmates Girls' ""Lust For Life"" video. Or maybe you're one of the fans that have been trolling eBay for the five hard-to-find, sold-out Hunx and His Punx singles that have been released (and just as quickly snapped up) over the past two years. If you count yourself in the latter category, then you're in luck; this album collects the tunes from those 7”s, presenting them (along with new bonus track ""Do the Make Up"") together for the first time. If you count yourself in the first category, however, you may be quite surprised by Gay Singles. There are no cartoonish synthesizer melodies, cheap Casio beats, or party-starting cacophonies of cowbell. There's no tongue-in-cheek rapping, either. Yes, the content is still overtly sexual, but it is softer and sweeter-- both lyrically and musically-- than anything you'd expect from a Gravy Train!!!! member. Hunx and His Punx make swooning bubblegum-punk, and though they aren't the first group to marry the effortless, sugary pop of 60s girl groups with the garage-rock revival, they might be the first whose skuzzy ""My Boyfriend's Back""-like songs are explicitly homoerotic. There is a wry dissonance between the songs' easy three-chord strums, resonant vintage organ flourishes, and hand-clapped percussion and their plainspoken lyrics about getting into someone's pants. The songwriters (most tracks are credited to a combination of Bogart and Justin Champlin, the garage-punk character known as Nobunny) may think they're being shocking, but the lyrics are actually charmingly innocent. While Gravy Train!!!! sing explicitly raunchy lyrics about masturbation, lap dances, and hand jobs, Hunx are more interested in winning over straight guys (""I don't think he's gonna miss her/ Cuz I'm a really good kisser,"" Bogart sings on ""Good Kisser""), and flipping 60s girl-pop tropes like waiting for boys to call. The outrageously tarty presentation plus faux naïve musical content highlights a winning group of influences-- John Waters, the Shangri-Las, the Ramones-- and the collection is surprisingly cohesive for a singles compilation. Bogart sings with a whining, nasal bray that may be off-putting or gratingly flat to some, but swathed in cheap, tinny reverb, it gets the rebellious, adolescent vibe right. After all the homoeroticism, this is at heart a record about the thrust and vitality of rock'n'roll: ""You like Morrissey, you like U2/ What the fuck is wrong with you?"" Bogart sings on opener ""You Don't Like Rock'n'Roll"", and if you think it's a legit question you might want to sing it along with him.","True Panther collects 7"" tracks released over the past few years by Seth Bogart's homoerotic, rock'n'roll throwbacks.

Wildling,Kammerflimmer Kollektief,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a886c0084474cd0c0e43/1:1/w_160/ac71cfdb.jpg,2010-03-16 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13986-wildling/,Staubgold,"At first glance, it's easy to mistake Germany's Kammerflimmer Kollektief for an experimental band. Their music features abstract vocals, electronics, and a sense of practiced spontaneity. But in fact, their focus is on musicianship, not innovation. Wildling is built from familiar units-- the patient development of jazz, the spacey glide of classic German psychedelia (think Cluster), and a bendy guitar style familiar from spaghetti Westerns scored by Ennio Morricone. With just a tinge of indie-rock melodicism and art-rock posture, KK bind these familiar touchstones into a striking personal sound. This is cerebral, subtle music. There are few obvious climaxes. The conglomerated style feels balanced, because everyone plays their role sensitively. Double bassist Johannes Frisch provides a rock-solid jazz foundation for the movements, shifting between deep grooves and deft extemporization. Guitarist Thomas Weber provides a lot of the 1970s experimental and cinematic feel, simultaneously handling woozy but hard-flecked guitars and electronic textures. Heike Aumüller provides the personality and humanizing voice, either sitting at her harmonium, or hunkering down on the floor with a flute or synthesizer. Drummer Christopher Brunner is adroit and feather-light. No one ever flies off on their own trip; all play tactfully and with a sense of the overriding structure. The scary mannequin-creature from the cover of 2007's Jinx makes a return appearance here, now with its dress pulled down ominously. Fans of that record will find themselves right at home, as KK has always stressed gradual refinement over sudden left turns: The music is mannered, restrained, redolent of 70s exotica; the vocals are cool and remote but essentially passionate. Aumüller coos like an out-music ice-diva amid the slow bluster of ""Move Right In"" as the guitar bends like cold starlight around the thumping double bass. ""I feel lightheaded,"" she sings on ""Aum A-Go-Go"", against a backdrop of xylophone and metallically textured ringlets. But you'd never guess it from her utterly composed delivery, which sounds low-key even when chopped into a blur during the song's conclusion. She sings in a weird, sometimes incomprehensible English that conveys just fine-- you can tell that ""Spookin' the Horse"" is a love song, just from how the voice plays against the big swoony guitar chords. Regardless of whether it sounds like melted indie rock or coiling jazz, each song has a mysterious, soulful pulse to follow, always just out of reach. The record eschews highs and lows for a steady, seductive purr. To their credit, Kammerflimmer Kollektief get a long way into the record before their regimented style begins to show signs of wear. Former collaborator Dietrich Foth lends the welcome new timbre of his saxophone to ""Silver Chords"" and ""Spookin' the Horse"". ""In Transition (Version)"" is an epic, shivering dub, and ""Rotwelsch"" has an archly medieval feel, like Mary Timony gone jazz. While there are some nice numbers tucked away near the end-- the dubby ""Cry Tuff"", and ""We Paint the Town Beige"", whose chord progression and vocal melody obliquely but strongly suggest ""Karma Police""-- the monolithic guitar tone begins to impose a kind of sameness. The music eventually gets so deep into the lizard brain that it nearly vanishes. But for fans of controlled musicianship and mysterious mood, this is a very nice surprise.","Tough-to-peg band mixes jazz, classic German psychedelia (think Cluster), and a bendy guitar style familiar from spaghetti Westerns.

Who Killed Sgt. Pepper?,The Brian Jonestown Massacre,by: Stuart Berman,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a8a05e6ef9596932125a/1:1/w_160/c81addfb.jpg,2010-03-16 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14009-who-killed-sgt-pepper/,A,"Throughout the Brian Jonestown Massacre's various travels in Spacemen 3 fuzz-rock, Byrdsian jangle-pop, and Dylanesque country-blues, the one constant has been Newcombe's alternately venomous/vulnerable voice. But ever since Ondi Timoner's notorious 2004 documentary Dig! cast his erratic, sometimes violent personality in a most unflattering lens, he's seemed less willing to put himself front and center in his own music. He deferred most of the vocal duties on 2005's We Are the Radio to guest singer Sarabeth Tucek and spent the duration of 2008's nigh impenetrable My Bloody Underground submerged in a lo-fi murk. On first approach, Who Killed Sgt. Pepper? continues the subterfuge-- like its predecessor, the new album boasts cassette-quality fidelity, features revolving-door collaborations with various European comrades, and carves another couple pounds of brisket off the sacred cow that is the Beatles. But in sharp contrast to My Bloody Underground's stoned lethargy, Who Killed Sgt. Pepper? represents a genuine attempt on Newcombe's part to revitalize his band's sound. It's the Brian Jonestown Massacre album that's the least informed by the usual parade of 1960s mod/psych influences, opting instead for flirtations with disco rhythms, drum loops, boom-box beats and house-diva wails. In a sense, Newcombe has simply replaced one form of repetition (droning/jangly guitar jams) for another (dance workouts). Once locked into a groove, he's not always sure what to do with it, letting Hacienda flashbacks like ""This Is the First of Your Last Warning (Icelandic)"" and ""Feel It"" chug along unnecessarily past the six-minute mark without introducing much variation on their pre-established themes. And in ""Let's Go Fucking Mental"", we find two brutish British traditions-- soccer chants and late-90s Big-Beat electronica-- combined into a laborious, lunk-head stomp that pummels enough brain cells to fulfill its own prophecy. Newcombe's beat experiments produce greater results when he uses them to draw out his songs' underlying menace. Compared to the steady 4/4 pulse of the aforementioned tracks, ""This Is the One Thing We Did Not Want to Have Happen"" provides a welcome mid-album jolt, with Newcombe's threatening vocal spurred on by a torrent of squalling guitars and a corrosive ""She's Lost Control"" rhythm loop (presumably a cheeky response to Bernard Sumner's band Bad Lieutenant nicking the riff to the Brian Jonestown Massacre's ""When Jokers Attack"" on their 2009 single ""Sink or Swim""). ""Someplace Else Unknown"" gets even more unhinged, with a ticking-time-bomb beat and queasy background textures that coax a strung-out Newcombe to maniacally scream, ""Look motherfucker, now I'm looking for drugs!"" Newcombe may be sober these days, but this track provides the most convincing recorded evidence in the entire BJM catalogue of the volatile character we see in Dig!. As if to underscore his distance from the smack-habit days that ""Someplace Else Unknown"" revisits, Newcombe's mood brightens considerably in the home stretch, offering up a pair of peace-offering pop songs that hearken back to the band's shoegazered 1995 debut Methodrone, and the delightfully WTF curio that is ""Dekta! Dekta! Dekta!"", a jaunty new-wave jig that's of a piece with early-80s Euro-pop novelties like Trio's ""Da Da Da"" and Falco's ""Der Kommissar"". But, of course, Newcombe can't let things lie without one last gratuitous exercise in kill-your-idols provocation, in this case the 10-minute sound-collage closer ""Felt Tipped Pictures of UFOs"". Juxtaposing John Lennon's infamous ""bigger than Jesus"" apology speech with the rantings of a young, impoverished Scottish woman calling bullshit on his ""imagine no possessions"" rhetoric, the track initially serves to encapsulate the philosophical disconnect between rich pop stars and the common fan. But as Newcombe lets the woman spout off on the details of a John Lennon-séance reality-TV special for the last five minutes, you start to wonder which musician's self-indulgence is really the issue here.","The latest from Anton Newcombe's band finds him attempting to revitalize BJM's sound with disco rhythms, drum loops, and house-diva wails.

Are the Roaring Night,The Besnard Lakes,by: Patrick Sisson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a877b1335d7bf16992bd/1:1/w_160/f28a2ee1.jpg,2010-03-16 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13973-are-the-roaring-night/,Jagjaguwar,"You can only be the dark horse once. The Besnard Lakes may have been a (mostly) unknown quantity when they broke out to a wider audience in 2007, but they were also insiders of sorts-- guitarist/vocalist Jace Lasek had done production work with Montreal heavyweights Wolf Parade and Sunset Rubdown. Fitting of its title, Are the Dark Horse had a subtle, almost shy, quality-- on many songs, the group's quiet side slowly swelled into a symphony. On the follow-up, Are the Roaring Night, husband-and-wife duo Lasek and Olga Goreas map out a sonic landscape that follows the peaks and valleys of their previous work, but the terrain is more ragged. New songs like ""Glass Printer"" sound more electrified and easily triggered from the outset. Marching forward with the inexorable, unforgiving pace the title implies, ""And This Is What We Call Progress"" pairs a steely two-drum pulse with a line of static suspended by an EBow. Even the slow, pretty interludes often exude more tension than the suspended-in-space, Spiritualized vibe of an older song like ""For Agent 13"". There's more unease in the band's bold space rock-- vocal harmonies mask that sense of menace on the two-part ""Like the Ocean, Like the Innocent"", which opens the album with oscillating notes and fluctuating guitar. After trading cloying choruses with Goreas, Lasek sings, ""Deciphered your lines from the short wave/ It said 'Kill all the swine, young and old.'"" Darkness and destruction are also central to ""Land of Living Skies"", made even more poignant after an opening segment of sinister radio transmissions. Talk of scrambled signals and short-wave technology is fitting considering Lasek's production background (check out the online gear list for his Breakglass studio). An impressive array of crunchy guitar tones courses throughout the album, pushing forward two-part epics so the steady cycle of build and release doesn't become overwrought. Craftsmanship permeates the peels of reverb-laden melodies or the Loveless-like gyre of lead single ""Albatross"". Are the Roaring Night sounds richer, and while it doesn't rewrite the formula, it contains many small refinements to the band's songwriting and production skills. Outside of the twinkling, sub-orbital synths on the closer ""The Lonely Moan"", there isn't anything that would be considered a radical departure. But when you make the kind of entrance the Besnard Lakes did, there isn't much to fix.","Montreal band delivers an edgy, restless set of dark romanticism and muscular guitar.

The Big To-Do,Drive-By Truckers,by: Joshua Love,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a88fc0084474cd0c0e5f/1:1/w_160/bca20051.jpg,2010-03-16 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13993-the-big-to-do/,ATO,"On their first two albums (1998's Gangstabilly and 1999's Pizza Deliverance), the Drive-By Truckers were supreme redneck jokesters, specializing in scabrous white-trash vignettes owing more to Southern Gothic fiction (Flannery O'Connor, Barry Hannah) than any sub-Mason-Dixon stand-up hacks. As the band matured and its de facto frontman Patterson Hood started writing songs that were weightier and more universal in sentiment, however, its more darkly off-kilter early work came to be generally viewed as juvenilia, the dicking around these guys did before they grew up into real artists. That would be a mistake, because songs like ""18 Wheels of Love"", ""Bulldozers and Dirt"", and ""Zoloft"" were wickedly clever and deeply revealing slices of Southern life that hold relatable truths for all listeners regardless of region. That said, it's a refreshing surprise that the group's latest album, The Big To-Do, finds Hood reconnecting with the macabre, with grim twists and booze-fueled mayhem, and with the dark corners of the American psyche. The album begins morbidly with ""Daddy Learned to Fly"", its whining riff propelling the first-person reflections of a young boy whose father has died. It's a colorful kind of morbidity, however, as we learn the boy has been eased into an acceptance of loss by the creative lie that his father is perpetually flying the friendly skies. Weighing the most deadly serious facts of life against a highly skewed sense of irreverence has always been one of DBT's greatest feats, and it's a balancing act the group maintains throughout the album's raucous first half-- on the booze-fueled bottoming-out of ""Fourth Night of My Drinking"", the small-town sex scandal of the portentously delivered ""The Wig He Made Her Wear"", and the nasty little slice of backwater intrigue called ""Drag the Lake Charlie"". It's a damn good thing Hood drops some of his gravitas, too, because his partner in crime, Mike Cooley (aka the Trucker you've always been able to rely on for witty shit-kickers) inexplicably contributes only three songs out of The Big To-Do's 13. Two of the three are great, as ""Birthday Boy"" offers up the musings of a savvy stripper while ""Get Downtown"" provides a shaggy snapshot of no-account losers outfitted to a shucking Chuck Berry groove. Still, that leaves quite a heavy burden on Hood's shoulders, even after you account for a couple of very nice turns from bassist Shonna Tucker, who was a bit of a weak link on Creation's Dark but who chills the blood here on the heartrending, hymnlike ""You Got Another"", then sets it racing again on the full-throated ""(It's Gonna Be) I Told You So"". To his credit, Hood's restored mischievousness manages to carry the album for quite some time, but he starts to falter along the record's back stretch. ""This Fucking Job"" and ""After the Scene Dies"" are sonically torqued-up and admirably pissed-off, but their respective gripes against occupational drudgery and the death of the rock'n'roll dream represent well-trodden ground for this songwriter. The Big To-Do then proceeds to bow out rather unceremoniously with the relative whimpers of ""Santa Fe"", ""The Flying Wallendas"", and Cooley's sweet but tepid ""Eyes Like Glue"". The Truckers demonstrated with 2008's Brighter Than Creation's Dark that they don't need non-stop yuks and grotesqueries to reach greatness, but the best moments of The Big To-Do nonetheless offer tantalizing proof that these guys still possess fascinatingly warped minds when they feel like showing 'em off.","The DBTs return, focusing on the songwriting of Patterson Hood and refreshingly reconnecting with the macabre and darker corners of the American psyche.

PVI006/IBB004,Various Artists,by: Marc Masters,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a8adea9e61561daa589f/1:1/w_160/a4fb976d.jpg,2010-03-15 06:00:04,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14022-pvi006ibb004/,Italian Beach BabesParadise Vendors,"Listening to this brisk collection of eager UK bands, I'm reminded of early-1990s indie comps, which often resonated as much as albums by individual artists. There are no big concepts or specific themes on Flying Nun's In Love With These Times, Homestead's Human Music, Teenbeat's 50, or K's International Pop Underground Convention, but something less tangible-- energy, common backgrounds, maybe just the serendipity of timing-- unifies these sets. Whatever it is, the label heads certainly heard something unifying in those bands, seeing past surface styles to a deeper camaraderie. That kind of camaraderie is all over PV006/IBB004, whose odd-looking title replicates its two labels' catalog numbers. It helps that most of these bands-- rooted at their most basic in a shared love of lo-fi garage rock-- actually are comrades. Seek them out on MySpace and you'll see the others listed as top friends, alongside announcements about joint performances and split releases on cassette or vinyl. There's some kind of underground community bubbling up here, but there's no name for it yet. And if the album's title is any indication, the people involved don't want one. Aboveground recognition may come-- one contributor, Male Bonding, has a Sub Pop debut due in May. But as long as these bands get to keep playing together, whether their audience is the whole world or just each other seems kinda trivial. The music itself is roughly recorded, but only a few tracks are drenched in noise or hidden behind walls of distortion. Songwriting is a priority, from the most basic two-chord melodies to some chops-heavy jams. It's all pop of the garage variety, and a lot of it is very catchy. Plug's ""Fresh Pleasures"" and La La Vasquez's ""Don't Rush Me"" both ride bass lines so sturdy they make off-kilter guitars and vocals sound oddly tuneful. Just as snappy are the ringing guitars of Cold Pumas' ""Tropical Guilt"" and Fair Ohs' ""Christmas Tree"", both mining territory between Abe Vigoda and Vampire Weekend. But the point here isn't so much how each band sounds as how much energy they bring to the enervated proceedings. Even slower, more casual songs have a nervy insistence. Mazes deliver a creaking near-ballad that sounds like Times New Viking covering Dinosaur Jr., while Spectrals' offering conjures the primitive twang of Beat Happening. Still, the faster tunes on PV006/IBB004 captivate most, and the best come at the beginning and end. Teen Sheiks' ""Germs"" stirs New Zealand pop and American garage into an uncannily familiar hook. Twenty-two minutes later, Not Cool's ""Limbs are for Liars"" ends the comp with speed-punk rhythms and slashing guitar. Those bookends make for a nice prologue and epilogue, and while the album may not tell a specific story, there's certainly some kind of moral here-- maybe something about how great bands can sound when they feed off each other, both in real life and in the crackling grooves of well-sequenced vinyl.","This oddly titled compilation rounds up a group of kindred UK garage-rock spirits-- led by Male Bonding, Teen Sheiks, and Spectrals-- quietly making noise.

Shaved EP,Babe Rainbow,by: Larry Fitzmaurice,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a8ab13d19756521396e3/1:1/w_160/a686d4c5.jpg,2010-03-15 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14019-shaved-ep/,Warp,"When he's not an active organizing member of Vancouver's arts scene, Cameron Reed creates electronic soundscapes he calls ""surf-step"" under the moniker Babe Rainbow. The first half of that tag may seem misleading-- unless they're planning to hang 10 on Shutter Island, it's difficult to imagine surfing to Reed's more ominous tones. But considering Vancouver's cool summers and propensity for rain, Reed's debut EP for Warp, Shaved, could be easily pegged with a beach-bummed outlook. As for the ""step"": despite the fact that dubstep's rapid splintering makes its classification tricky, distinct elements of that sound are disparately placed throughout Shaved. There are snapping backbeats, irregular rhythms, amorphous bass lines-- enough reference points to prove Reed's done his homework. But although Shaved sometimes flirts with pastiche, its most promising moments occur when Reed steps out of the comfort zone of genres-- both self-invented and preexistent-- and creates overcast, suffocating sonic landscapes. The material collected here aren’t as much songs as they are dark mood pieces. Opening track ""Popcommon"" establishes the portentous mood-- its lone melodic line is a burnt-out, static charge that sounds like a jet engine powering down. Here and elsewhere Reed displays a talent for utilizing negative space, creating a sense of urban paranoia and isolation that runs throughout Shaved. ""Care"" recalls the Knife at their creepiest and most sparse, with a wizened female voice emerging from the horror-stringed ether, while the album-closing title track utilizes warped bass and muffled tones to create a doomsday atmosphere. If those two tracks are gearing up for the end of the world, then the ironically titled Shaved highlight ""Celebrate"" is pure atomic fallout, complete with static sheets and foghorns sounding a warning that no one will hear. *Shaved'*s weaker moments discard haunting atmospherics for genre formalism, such as the second-rate IDM of ""Tummy Sticks"" and the record's most uninspired, straightforwardly dubstep moment, ""Screwby"". While the track begins promisingly, with a pair of skittering rhythms that juxtapose nicely, one-drop keyboard stabs and wobbly bass stick out like a fist full of sore thumbs. Ultimately, Shaved is successful when Reed is embracing his downbeat tendencies. This could mean that one is unlikely to hear the sounds of Babe Rainbow filling clubs or house parties anytime soon, but to paraphrase Zomby: fuck dancing, let's mope.","Vancouver artist makes his Warp debut on an EP of ominous mood pieces and dubstep-esque excursions he calls ""surf-step.""

The band uses simple, traditional elements but aims for something unique. Some songs feature just the voices of the three members; the rest of the time, they limit themselves to violin, a little double bass, and various percussion instruments. Recording much of their material live, their antecedents are as modern as drone and as old as early American folk, though with the latter they're often stretching the definition of the genre. It helps that percussionist and singer Mark Trecka has a deep, sonorous baritone that can carry the long notes-- and there are many in the vocal-only opener ""Root/Joy""-- with a wizened authority. The band uses vocals almost like stringed instruments, which become even more noticeable when violins are added to their chanting. Though its lyrics are sparse, ""The Center Of"" adds thick atmosphere via slow, reveberating percussion and the acrobatic vocal of violinist and singer Beth Remis (think the Dirty Projectors' female singers in half-time). Whether the band is chanting, thumbing a double bass, or shaking marimbas, it's hard to believe Lay of Pilgrim Park is the work of just three people in the same room, and their roles are so fluid it's hard to pick out where one member's contributions start and another ends. The album's abrupt changes, deliberate silences, and movements rather than verses and choruses feel almost more classical than folk (or jazz, or indie, or anything else they might be considered). Though the wordless and percussion-less tracks sometimes can seem meandering and incidental, they add context to a tightly focused album-length piece. Part of what's exciting about the melody on the 12-minute ""Park Saint and Folly"" is that it resolves all the tense, hanging melodies that lead up to it. Still, the songs with more instrumentation and melodic drive are the clear highlights. ""Made Sheen"" doubles down on the percussion and repeats its title to hypnotic effect, and ""Park Saint and Folly"" builds from a solo string part into something layered and more purposeful-- even introducing a bassline in its ninth minute that’s almost funky. The malleability Pillars and Tongues introduce to more rigid, traditional forms of music should be really exciting-- at times it is-- but usually they're merely quietly impressive rather than visceral, so what could be thrilling often feels more like a museum piece.","Using just vocals and a small array of traditionally classical instruments, this Chicago band conjures their own unique sound.

Rush to Relax,Eddy Current Suppression Ring,by: David Bevan,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a8a8ea9e61561daa5893/1:1/w_160/7f804f65.jpg,2010-03-15 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14017-rush-to-relax/,MelodicGoner,"It took Eddy Current Suppression Ring just six studio hours to craft a follow up to their sophomore LP, Primary Colours. That's less time than most Americans will spend at work in a day. While that pace created a final product much less polished than the band's previous work, Rush to Relax is also a more accurate, interesting sonic articulation of the band's frenetic frontman, Brendan Suppression. ""Anxiety"" picks up right where Colours left off-- its rubber-band riffs wrapped tightly around Suppression's existential babbling. The guitar sound is still a spring-loaded hybrid cobbled together from Saints and Stooges records. At their best, Rush to Relax's songs maintain a firm grip even when they meander. ""Gentleman"" and ""I Can Be a Jerk"" are essentially the same song, but while the former is pretty, the latter is too cute for its own good. And the band still has a tendency to jam around one whale of a crescendo, as though every song is capable of morphing into a kind of krautrock-infused soundcheck. (After all, these dudes originally formed during a lager-fueled jam session at the tail end of a Christmas party.) ""Tuning Out"" and ""Second Guessing"" fall under that category, and, despite some truly great stretches of psychedelic tension, both lose their grip fairly often. ""Burn"" is much more efficient and white-hot, Suppression sounding particularly ferocious when consoling a friend suffering from manic depression. Its foundation is basic, its hook sturdy. But its lyrical shift outward feels weirdly transformative. In the album's titular closer, just before the three-minute mark, it sounds as though the band is about to take off on another hike-- the track has a 24-minute running time after all. But then something extraordinary happens. What felt like the rumblings of one hell of a ride became something completely different, zen even. After some existential tripping about ""going on a holiday and you're never coming back,"" Suppression nails down a mantra. Guitars begin to bleed into the sounds of surf lapping against the shore. ""Slow down before you fall down,"" he murmurs. And for the last 20 minutes of the record, you can hear nothing but water and sea birds in conversation with one another, all of it as mesmerizing as every riff and rant that came before.","Fantastic Australian garage-punk band continues its quick rise on this hastily made but powerfully packed new album.

Fang Island,Fang Island,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a8a2c0084474cd0c0e86/1:1/w_160/85e50f53.jpg,2010-03-15 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14011-fang-island/,Sargent House,"Brooklyn's Fang Island describe their aesthetic as ""everyone high-fiving everyone."" So it's appropriate that the band's website features a video of them jamming out with kindergartners and another with Andrew WK-- people so caught up in having a good time that you sometimes wonder if they're bullshitting you. What helps Fang Island steamroll past cynicism is how ""fun"" isn't just an ornament for them, it's embedded in the band's musical DNA. Fang Island's self-titled second album is joyous despite its general lack of verses or choruses. It's fractured like any post-punk record while also speaking the language of classic rock, yet often feels like an intricate collage pieced together from elements that make songs memorable-- palm-muted power chords following wide-open intros, blistering solos, double-time outros. Pretty much all of that is crammed into the deleriously infectious ""Daisy"", an emphatic crossbreed of the Go! Team and the Promise Ring's ""Is This Thing On?"" The dance routine in the song's video feels like the only natural reaction to hearing it. As Fang Island's entry point, ""Daisy"" might come on a bit strong, but what precedes it sets the tone perfectly. The record opens with fireworks (literally), before an armada of severely EQ'd guitar harmonics swoop in like fighter jets. The band then bursts into a dense chorus of four-part harmonies, earnestly intoning the WK-ish positive mantra: ""They are all within my reach. They are free."" Next comes ""Careful Crossers"", which has no words but would be shortchanged by being called an ""instrumental"" when such lyrical riffs pop up every eight bars. Fang Island aren't total deconstructionists-- the see-sawing rhythms and stutter-step cadence of songs like ""Life Coach"" and ""Treeton"" wouldn't be out of place on a Spoon or Modest Mouse album. But unlike other pop craftsmen, Fang Island rarely give you any indication of what direction they might take. ""Sideswiper"" appears to settle into a Ted Leo-ish 12/8 stomper after its darting intro, until a sudden acoustic guitar and high-wire leads hints that the whole thing might just be one big riff on ""Jack and Diane"". The music coordinators at MTV recently tapped ""Daisy"" to soundtrack a series of commercials for the reality show The Buried Life. The premise of the show-- ""What do you want to do before you die?""-- is pretty corny, but Fang Island's exuberance is perfect for chasing dreams. While their manic musicianship and group-hug vibe may inspire more than a few comparisons to the badly missed Mae Shi, they aren't about proselytizing. This music is just honest and life-affirming and infectious, and it's that rare concentration of directness and simplicity that makes Fang Island so uniquely and wonderfully inclusive.","This wildly infectious Brooklyn band takes manic musicianship and shoutalong choruses to another level on their self-titled second album.

"Nigeria Special, Vol. 2: Modern Highlife, Afro Sounds & Nigerian Blues 1970-6",Various Artists,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a89913d19756521396b8/1:1/w_160/56fe8fae.jpg,2010-03-12 06:00:04,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14003-nigeria-special-vol-2-modern-highlife-afro-sounds-nigerian-blues-1970-6/,Soundway,"When I first started listening to African pop music, I tended to make a lot of assumptions. One of the most misguided was that I assumed the amount of stuff I'd like would be manageable. I now know how wrong that was-- and that's a positive. I also figured that highlife would be something really distinct, a highly specific sound that was easy to describe. It turns out it's more like rock-- rock music isn't any one thing. It's more of an umbrella term to blanket a group of related styles, and so it is with highlife as well. Highlife has its roots in the coastal towns of modern Ghana, where it developed in the early 20th century as a fusion of calypso, sailors' songs, palm-wine guitar music from Sierra Leone and Liberia, rhythms from both inland and across the ocean in the Caribbean, and European harmonic concepts. As it caught on, it became acquisitive, adding horn arrangements indebted to European dance bands and American jazz, rebuilding first around the electric guitar and then around synthesizers and drums machines a couple of decades later. It moved to the rest of English-speaking West Africa, absorbed the sensibilities of R&B and funk, fragmented into subgenres, and survives today as a powerful thread tying together generations of musicians. Soundway's second Nigeria Special volume homes in on the early 1970s and gives us a glimpse of what highlife sounded like in Africa's most populous nation during that period. It attempts to do it all in one disc stuffed with 20 tracks (or three LPs with 22). Like 2008's first volume, it digs deep, touching on artists familiar to those who have kept up with the wave of Afro sound compilations and reissues over the past few years, while locating a huge trove of obscurities. The vibe across most of the comp is laid-back and confident, with plenty of harmony vocals, horns, and buoyant rhythms. And then, of course, there are the guitars-- the cycling, fluid lines that underpin virtually every song. Highlife guitar styles vary considerably from player to player, but they all seem to have constant motion in common. The ragged, angular lines of Fidel Sax Bateke & the Voices of Darkness' ""Motako"" sound dissimilar to the mellow-toned, interlocking parts that snake around the cowbell and conga of Fubura Sekibo's ""Psychedelic Baby"", but they serve a similar function-- pushing the music forward and building a lush harmonic bed for the vocal harmonies and horns. For listeners looking for a bit more influence from funk and Afrobeat, they can get that from Tunji Oyelana & the Benders, whose ""Iwo Ko la Dami"" clearly bears the stamp of Fela Kuti's Afrobeat in its muted guitars, stabbing horn arrangement, and fluttering, jazzy drum part. ""Shango Oba Onina"" by Black's Zenith is short and punchy, with crashing horns, a taut vocal, and catchy rhythm section, and the Don Isaac Ezekiel Combination get funky with the Lord's Prayer, literally setting it to music. The strangest cuts that stretch furthest outside what I've come to think of as highlife's malleable boundaries are ""Totobiroko (Ogbele)"", by Twins Seven-Seven & His Golden Cabretas, which loads up a rampaging beat with talking drum and vibraphone to back a chanting vocal, and Joy Nwoso & Dan Satch's ""Egwo Umu Agbogho"", which wraps up the CD version of the compilation with a straight-enough highlife arrangement over which Nwoso wails operatically in an incredible display of vocal virtuosity. For listeners who haven't yet explored beyond some of the funkier, more overtly Western-influenced styles of African music, Nigeria Special, Vol. 2 offers a fine selection of 70s highlife that can help point toward new avenues of exploration, while offering a handful of selections that provide easy entry points. In fact, it somewhat mirrors the way I got into highlife myself, gradually letting go of the funk and soul elements that helped me get into vintage African pop to begin with. If you're already into highlife, this set provides a wealth of welcome surprises, with plenty of information to help you wrap your head around where all this stuff has been hiding.","Soundway's second Nigeria Special volume gives us a glimpse of what highlife sounded like in Africa's most populous nation during the early 1970s.

Be So True EP,MillionYoung,by: Zach Kelly,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a8aa5e6ef95969321271/1:1/w_160/4ce53252.jpg,2010-03-12 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14018-be-so-true-ep/,Arcade Sound,"South Florida's Mike Diaz (aka MillionYoung) manages to evoke some surprisingly warm textures from chillwave's now-familiar sounds and motifs. Much of the music on Be So True shares some of the same hallmarks that freckle that movement: soft pulsing rhythms, dream-washed melodies, and nostalgia-inducing electronic patterns. Much less sample-heavy than its predecessor, this year's earlier Sunndreamm EP, Be So True collects more straightforward, deeply romantic electro-pop creations, alternately simmering with joy and traces of fragility. The music here sounds more synthetic than most current bedroom electronic projects, and Diaz reconfigures aqueous tones with an impressive array of rhythmic accents to give his productions momentum. But it's Diaz's vocals that lend a much-needed organic element. Though it's sometimes difficult to locate exactly what Diaz might be saying, since he often chops and pitch-shifts his already distant-sounding voice much like Washed Out's Ernest Greene does, lyrical sentiments take a backseat as his words melt into the lushness of his productions, often evoking a mood or emotion with a simple vocal intonation. With the careful attention Diaz pays to his assortment of drum sounds, it's also easy to make a dance connection-- even the day-glo artwork suggests the EP has as much to do with movement as feeling. ""Cynthia"" and ""Soft Denial"" possess enough momentum and blissed-out nuance to earn club play. But due to paced, introspective additions like the slow, Human League-indebted ""Mien"" or quick interlude ""Pilfer"", Be So True feels most rewarding in headphones, as repeat listens find the record inhabiting a more somber, personal space. Most ambitious and impressive is the closing track, ""Day We Met"", a distorted collage of the ideas and accents Diaz toys with throughout the disc's too-brief 17-minute span. Here, a more complex time signature gives way to cascading percussion, a pair of intertwining, waterfall-like synths, and a clipped female vocal. Only about midway through does Diaz's own voice appear to bring order to the mounting chaos. ""I just want to hold it all in my hands,"" he wails as the storm finally begins to break. Here, Diaz gets his wish, as Be So True is condensed into one fractured swoop.","Another rising chillwave producer, South Florida's MillionYoung creates music that's more synthetic than most current bedroom electronic projects.

The Desert of Shallow Effects,Miles Kurosky,by: Paul Thompson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a8a5c0084474cd0c0e8c/1:1/w_160/ae22303a.jpg,2010-03-12 06:00:02,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14014-the-desert-of-shallow-effects/,Majordomo,"When Beulah split, it seemed like something of a mercy killing; over the course of four LPs, their impeccably arranged take on bubblegum psych grew dourer and more heartbroken, and so did the band themselves. Nearly a year before the breakup, frontman Miles Kurowsky was already questioning the purpose of continuing, telling Rolling Stone, ""Here I am in an indie rock band that's done quite well and done a lot of things we never thought we would. We've played festivals, we've been on Conan O'Brien... but at the end of the day I wonder what I've done. All I got is some crow's feet. What's the fucking prize?"" Though they never quite gained the foothold it seemed they might've during their eight-year run, Beulah's catalog has won them quite a few converts in the years since their split, with this new crew finding particular solace in their later work. Now, after six years of almost complete silence, Kurosky delivers his solo debut, The Desert of Shallow Effects, to a cult in waiting. I can't help but think of fellow California pop geeks Weezer a decade ago; their difficult post-hiatus work, like this newfound appreciation of Beulah's last couple records, had served as a new entrance point for latecomers while the band was in limbo, and upon reentry, the band found itself faced with an unusual set of expectations. In a few ways, Desert could've easily served as the next Beulah record; Kurosky's voice hasn't lost a step in his years away, and it's as pristinely orchestrated as ever, thanks in part to the many ex-Beulah members lending a hand. But Kurosky, who's likened these newer songs to stories rather than his earlier confessionals and free associations, seems hellbent on making sure we consider the half-decade-plus he's had to incubate these numbers. The songs have grown knottier and the arrangements more finicky, and Kurosky's lyrics have shed much of their directness in favor of more emphasis on narrative. It's a striking pullback from the swoony sulk of Yoko and The Coast Is Never Clear; like Weezer's Green Album, it's a proficient but impersonal collection of tunes that seem guided less by heart than by a kind of muscle memory. Desert of Shallow Effects is a tremendous sounding record, brimming with nuance but never averse to orchestral overload. It's a precision attack, and as lofty and lovely as these tunes can sound, even their note-perfect nature seems to hold the listener at arm's length. But the real distance in the record is generated by Kurosky's lyrics, a series of clipped phrases and red herrings loosely compiled in the shape of story-songs, rich in imagistic detail but short in the personals department. This is a guy whose best-ever lyric might be ""all we need is a pretty song,"" but there's simply nothing that directly affecting here; it's as if Kurosky, shy of the virulent response to his heart-on-sleeve stuff from Coast and Yoko, wanted nothing more than to stay the hell out of the way this time around. And, while a line or two pops out of nearly every song here, his tendency to shove several words where a few would do further adds to Desert's overstuffed feeling. Amidst all the prim and proper stuff here, picking moments that stand out proves a challenge. The Beulah loyal may well lap this one up, but it's hard to imagine Kurosky's solo bow winning him many newfound fans; unless you're all about flute solos and such, Desert is just a tough record to make inroads with. It's nice to see Kurosky has moved on from the beauteous bumouts of the Yoko days and good to see he's not interested in repeating himself, but were Desert the fifth Beulah record, it'd be the fifth best. One hopes next time around, after getting six years' worth of songs out of his system, Kurosky can find a way to sneak some more heart into the symphonies playing in his head.","After six years of almost complete silence, the former Beulah frontman delivers his solo debut to a cult in waiting.

Carve Out the Face of My God,Infinite Body,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a8a3b1335d7bf1699317/1:1/w_160/f9830b7f.jpg,2010-03-12 06:00:01,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14012-carve-out-the-face-of-my-god/,Post Present Medium,"Infinite Body's Kyle Parker used to perform as Gator Surprise, one of many shirtless dudes moaning into suitcases full of pedals around Los Angeles. But his debut LP as Infinite Body, White Hymn, found him working with surprisingly restrained tones; it was pretty but transitional. His new album, Carve Out the Face of My God, released on the label run by No Age's Dean Spunt, is bolder and fully realized, with almost every shoegazey glow countered by a noisy growl. Parker's noise origins are perceptible in his music, but you could boil down the story to ""Lapsed harsh noise guy goes soft; produces best work of his career."" This sort of mellowing usually happens over time-- think of how Hisham Bharoocha's music changed from Lightning Bolt to Black Dice to Soft Circle. Parker seems to have leapfrogged ahead: Gator Surprise was gnarlier than Lightning Bolt, while Infinite Body is dreamier than Soft Circle. Here, Parker has managed to synthesize a lot of familiar sounds into a broadly appealing statement: Burning Star Core's contoured interference, MBV's ear-piercing chords, and Rhys Chatham's invincible distortion. Parker's own thumbprint manifests in the clear, meticulous interplay of these elements. ""Dive"" operates on three distinct levels: a warm, soupy base drone, a high modulating one, and a graceful synth melody that slowly rocks back and forth. The timbre of the melody bloats as the drones fade out, so that it seems to be soaking up the distortion. Transparency is the album's watchword: All transactions between noise and beauty are fully disclosed. A good deal of variety fits within these generous parameters. ""A Fool Persists"" is merely a single string figure that rises and gently crumbles, over and over. It doesn't sound like much on paper, but slight modulations in the tempo and phrasing give the stack of notes a slightly different character with each repetition. It's actually one of the most magical tracks here-- black and white spilling into Technicolor on a quiet loop. ""On Our Own to Fall Off"" is shot through with glassy, chattering lines, like a distorted Field track with the drums stripped off. And ""Sunshine"", the most involved composition, exemplifies Parker's artfully mechanical approach-- gradually turning itself inside out, its staccato pulse giving way to a mass of drones. Parker's diligence pays off big. Carve Out the Face of My God is overwhelming, but not disorienting, thanks to core melodies that work like signposts pointing our way through the distortion. It's a rare meeting of raw force and listener-friendly order.","Sophomore LP from this L.A. noise artist is bolder and more fully realized than his debut, with almost every shoegazey glow countered by a noisy growl.

The Monitor,Titus Andronicus,by: Rob Mitchum,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a8a1ea9e61561daa587d/1:1/w_160/d22a5fa5.jpg,2010-03-12 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14010-the-monitor/,XL,"Modern indie rock generally treats emotion as something that should be guarded or disguised. The Monitor does not subscribe to this viewpoint. On their second album, New Jersey's Titus Andronicus split the emotional atom with anthemic chants, rousing sing-alongs, celebrations of binge drinking, marathon song titles, broken-hearted duets, punked-up Irish jigs, and classic rock lyric-stealing. And through it all, they take subtlety out on the town, pour a fifth of whiskey down its throat, write insults on its face in permanent marker, and abandon it in the woods. Loosely based on the U.S. Civil War, The Monitor may be one of the most absurd album concepts ever, invoking the battle that caused Abraham Lincoln to claim, ""I am now the most miserable man living,"" to illustrate the sound and fury of suburban Jersey life in a shattered economy. In the annals of using historical metaphors for emotional communication, it's up there with Jeff Mangum empathizing with Anne Frank. But it all turns out so ridiculously fun-- with Ken Burns-style readings of speeches from Lincoln and Jefferson Davis, daguerreotype cover art, and song titles all participating in the reenactment-- that it never even begins to approach the pretentiousness these elements might suggest. In the end, the Civil War is just a recurring theme, and one that's more personal than political. For stadium-rock inspiration, Titus Andronicus look no further than their home-state hero, paraphrasing Bruce Springsteen in the first song and name-checking him in the last. And while the central muse is obvious, there's a full menu of influences on display. There's the Hold Steady in its mythology of intoxication, the Pogues in its cathartic singalong gutter-punk, and Conor Oberst's Desaparacidos in its brazen earnestness. There's also the fatalistic fuck-all of early Replacements and the brutalist thrashing of east-coast hardcore in its violent instrumentation and apocalyptic worldview. Somehow that laundry-list of inspirations all manage to make an appearance in the first two minutes of leadoff track ""A More Perfect Union"". After an opening half that's equal parts slop and ambition, the album turns a corner on ""A Pot in Which to Piss"" and settles into a reliable pattern, each song building from frontman Patrick Stickles' self-described ""piss and moan"" to a punk-rock fury, and finally to an instrumental call-to-arms. The repeated structure feeds the album's narrative arc and provides some much-needed breathers, until the record's big finale. At 14 minutes, ""The Battle of Hampton Roads"" adds a couple of extra X's to the already XL project: Oscillating even more wildly between the album's twin poles of suicidal ideation and vengeance fantasies, Stickles builds to his frothiest moment, spilling it all out in a verse that rivals Neutral Milk Hotel's ""Oh Comely"" for uncomfortable honesty. And in the end there's a bagpipe solo. ""The enemy is everywhere,"" Stickles keeps reminding us over the course of the record. It's difficult to tell what that enemy is, as Stickles' target moves from social anxiety to pure boredom to the symbolic frat-brahs of ""Hampton Roads"". But as the casualties pile up and the battle hymns keep egging on the troops, it becomes clear that the opponent isn't nearly as important as the fight itself. Catharsis is Stickles' fuel, and The Monitor is a 65-minute endorsement of angst and opposition as the best way to present that combustible sorrow: Light it with footlights, throw a giant shadow against the back wall, and rock the fuck out of it.","Titus' sophomore record, a sprawling concept album loosely about the U.S. Civil War, is packed with anthems and brimming with energy and ambition.

Return to Form,Major Stars,by: Jess Harvell,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a8a45e6ef95969321261/1:1/w_160/5be54f0e.jpg,2010-03-11 06:00:04,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14013-return-to-form/,Drag City,"Sometimes the best gigs are the happy accidents-- stumbling on an unknown band, or being convinced to see an artist by a friend only to become a convert yourself. That's how I was introduced to Major Stars: Hijacked, dragged to a tiny Baltimore bar where the band was headlining. And then, boom: Wayne Rogers launched into the first of many acid-rock solos and full-front assaults. I was awestruck in a way you assume people felt when first seeing, say, session guitarist Pete Cosey (best known for his work with Miles Davis) or Wayne Kramer (MC5). I don't throw those comparison points around lightly, either. But Rogers, partner Kate Biggar, and third guitarist Tom Leonard do play as if the merger of those two turn-of-the-70s titans was the most natural thing the world. The Major Stars sound begins with the post-blues/proto-metal of the MC5 at their most raucous. Unlike many 21st century bands known for guitar pyro, Return to Form trucks in muscular anthems rather than sprawling mess. Tunes like ""Black Point"" and ""Low Grade"" are as memorable for their rhythm section's heavy-machinery lurch as the feedback splatter. Which just makes the freaky, near-freeform soloing-- think electric jazz before it was tamed into fusion or psychedelia at its most caustic-- all the more surprising when it erupts on ""Black Point"". But despite what you may have heard-- or how the above sounds-- this is not is a noise band, at least in the feedback-for-its-own-sake sense of the word. At their best, Major Stars combine tight riffs and chops with a deep, abiding love for joyous guitar slop. Vocalist Sandra Barett only sometimes adds to the band's hummability quotient. If nothing else her slightly droning style adds a human presence, sometimes tough and sometimes surprisingly fragile, to what would otherwise be an hour of epic screech and murk. But she's not Major Stars' focal point by a longshot; the guitarists have a lot more charisma. Major Stars' leads alone could command an arena, if bands this hairy hadn't been banned from arenas a long time ago. But occasionally the devotion to six-string mayhem overwhelms the songwriting, and unless you really get off on reams of guitar raunch, Major Stars on CD may still not be for you. Sure, Return to Form has the sound of hardcore 1970s psych down, even if the mp3 is about as ideal for capturing the music's oomph as cheap hi-fi's and transistor radios were 40 years ago. But for music as much about volume and spectacle and physicality, it's undeniably easier to be wowed when the band is within spitting distance-- flopping all over each other, axes and hair flying, amps approaching critical mass. Return to Form may not always have the tunes or the funkadelic special effects to keep casual listeners interested in the comfort of their own homes/cars/heads. Still, if the album sometimes feels like an advertisement for the next Major Stars tour, well, it's still a pretty damned good advertisement.","At their best, this fantastic live band combines tight riffs and chops with a deep, abiding love of joyous guitar slop.

Home Acres,Aloha,by: Eric Harvey,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a8985e6ef9596932124b/1:1/w_160/66dcaacd.jpg,2010-03-11 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14000-home-acres/,Polyvinyl,"Aloha practically sum up their new album with the line ""your sunrise knocks me to the ground."" Hell, that could describe songwriter Tony Cavallario's imagination and career trajectory, too-- his characters occasionally emerge from the shadows, make a small ripple, then retreat. Acres is Aloha's first full-length since 2006's Some Echoes, and it picks up where that album left off: tales of anti-social sadsacks set to a pristine mix of Chicago indie-prog and late-90s emo. Though he's still trying to figure out how to pen a memorable chorus, Cavallario's melodies are sharper than ever here, and they're again ably fleshed out by engineer T.J. Lipple and Chad Clark. It won't knock you down, but at a few points, Acres is the best stuff they've ever done. The key to enjoying an Aloha record is to hone in on the sounds and textures as much as the stories. With that in mind, Acresprovides plenty of subtle rewards. The dizzy organ under the refrain of ""I'm in Trouble"", the Hail to the Thief-style rumbling bass/guitar of opener ""Building a Fire"", the processed guitar tone of ""Everything Goes My Way"", Cale Parks' off-the-chains drumming and trademark marimba-- they all reward repeat headphone listening. Yet at the same time, Cavallario's able to push the band out into the light like never before. The jangly power-pop of standout ""Searchlight"" and the propulsive ""Cold Storage"" are as catchy as the band is typically rhythmically potent, and they rank amongst the top tier of the group's catalog. Yet this is still an Aloha record, and certain things about the music aren't ever going to change. It's important to note that the ""pop"" moments here aren't going to make you forget Big Star; instead, they sound vibrant amongst a stark, occasionally oppressive atmosphere.

Kairos,White Hinterland,by: Patrick Sisson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a8815e6ef95969321215/1:1/w_160/b71565c8.jpg,2010-03-11 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13982-kairos/,Dead Oceans,"Casey Dienel doesn't stay put for very long. The singer's last full length with White Hinterland, 2008's Phylactery Factory, swayed to brushed drums, dainty piano, and perky vocals. Later that year, she created prickly, sophisticated art-lounge on the Luniculaire EP, a collection of originals and covers all sung in French. Like her earlier work, there was still a strong theatrical element in those edgier songs, but it didn't exactly point the way toward the hazy pop pulse of Kairos. From the opening seconds of the album-- a lazy tide pool of swirling synths and echoing vocals-- White Hinterland strike a different pose. The graceful piano, chamber-pop arrangements, and storybook lyrics of the past were crisp snapshots; Kairos is a collection of over-exposed and landscapes-- bold, blurred, and wide open. Dienel and bandmate Shawn Creeden removed the piano from the equation on Kairos, and the result is a textbook case of addition by subtraction. Dienel's voice, still delicate and fluttering, sounds more powerful and expressive, free and untethered from the jazzy arrangements of the past. With antiquated references stricken from the lyric sheet, Dienel's words come off as more personal and direct. She swoons on ""Cataract"" and ""Magnolias"", two of the gorgeous tracks in which her sweet tone and confident phrasing, along with unfurled guitar melodies, recall Bitte Orca. Considering the album's chugging, fuzzy rhythms and lo-fi synth wash, Dirty Projectors won't be the only indie reference point cited when discussing Kairos. But the myriad of elements, from the dubstep-grade bass hits to looped vocals, beautifully comes together. Kairos represents a bold step for Dienel and White Hinterland, a re-imagining of the music-making process and an example of musical experimentation and evolution. As the restless Dienel sings on ""Moon Jam"", ""I am afraid of so many things/ But I do not fear the future.""","Casey Dienel's restless voice detours again on an enveloping album of artful, gauzy pop.

Stridulum EP,Zola Jesus,by: Jason Crock,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a887ea9e61561daa583d/1:1/w_160/8090b0a7.jpg,2010-03-11 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13987-stridulum-ep/,Sacred Bones,"Zola Jesus didn't need to clean up to stand apart from the lo-fi horde-- they already had Nika Danilova's voice, which tends to cut through a track and leave an indelible impression no matter how it's recorded. Whether it's wordless yowling, an extended cover of ""Somebody to Love"", or something as disarming as The Spoils' ""Clay Bodies"", her singing has a way of sticking in your memory. Even so, the Stridulum EP represents a large stride forward, not just in production quality, but in the band's focus. Heard next to their gauzy beginnings, these six synth-driven tracks sound surprisingly clear, even poppy. Whether this cleaner sound is here to stay or not, the emotions behind the music are just as heavy, and this self-contained EP is the perfect place for the band to try something different. Danilova still belts out the lyrics from behind layers of cavernous reverb and the overall sound remains dramatic and foreboding. And though there are moments here where the foundation rumbles and the sound is disorienting, recording quality has nothing to do with it. Instead, Zola Jesus are more inclined to shake up the atmosphere with dissonance, like the whirring that disrupts the otherwise calming ""Trust Me"" or the ominous chamber-of-souls hissing at the end of ""Night"". Still, these hints of abstraction haunt the margins of more direct songs where hooky verses and memorable choruses are the norm. The tracks on Stridulum follow a pattern that opener ""Night"" nails at the start: They build from minimal but insistent beats and simple melodies into crescendos where the synthesizer tones, sampled incidental noise, and layered vocals merge into a stirring whole. Danilova leans on immediate, familiar phrases here: ""At the end of the night, we'll be together again""; ""When you're lost, know I'll be around""; ""It's not easy to fall in love""; ""I can't stand to see you this way"". The lyrics are visceral, and swooning chords and always-operatic vocals multiply the effect. Zola Jesus may be experimenting in more earnest and accessible pop here, but the charged theatrical mood is just as overwhelming. Zola Jesus' brooding, gothic vibe probably isn't going anywhere, nor is their willingness to experiment with the sonics and constraints of their songs. But Stridulum's immediately striking cover art hints at the depth of the band's ambition: Their personality is still here, but there's more thought in the composition and the presentation. So rather than cleaning up and getting ready for a close-up, the EP feels more like a lateral move, in the best possible way-- there's no guessing what comes next.","Following on their stirring full-length debut, The Spoils, Zola Jesus return with a terrific EP that applies their gothic drama to more immediate songs.

Broken Bells,Broken Bells,by: Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a87e13d1975652139678/1:1/w_160/e3263ff0.jpg,2010-03-11 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13979-broken-bells/,Columbia,"It's been a while since Danger Mouse or the Shins did anything to change your listening habits, let alone your life. In the past decade, Danger Mouse's landmark Grey Album mash-up and membership in Gnarls Barkley helped anticipate indie rock's increasing openness to hip-hop and R&B crossovers. A couple of years earlier, James Mercer paved the way for future indie crossover success stories with the Shins' Garden State contribution and controversial Olympics-aired McDonald's commercial. That the pair's paths might eventually cross was more inevitable than unexpected. Mercer and Danger Mouse's debut as Broken Bells is not quite up to the level of either's best projects, but in its own quiet way, it hits its marks. The pair first worked together on the David Lynch/Sparklehorse project Dark Night of the Soul, and Broken Bells picks up the sadsack spirit of that record-- it's a deceptively catchy album centered on personal loss. It's unclear whether we're supposed to trace Mercer's lyrical malaise to a shattered relationship with his band (Mercer split with Shins mates Marty Crandall and Jesse Sandoval in 2008), a lover, or both. But this much is certain: Something has ended. In the album's brightest moments, there are enough swooning harmonies, replayable choruses, and psych-baked production elements that you might not even notice Mercer's dark thoughts. Besides, the singer is clearly attempting to move on here, taking advantage of this fresh setting to try on new looks: film-score orchestration and acid flange meet a Pet Sounds-like vocal odyssey on ""Your Head Is on Fire""; ""The Mall & the Misery"" opens with Springsteen-ian Americana and then veers off into post-punk guitar stabs; ""Sailing to Nowhere"" is a horror-show waltz; and Mercer's nearly unrecognizable falsetto on album standout ""The Ghost Inside"" recalls the high, cracked croon of another Danger Mouse collaborator, Blur/Gorillaz singer Damon Albarn. An early version of the record included a nicely gloomy song with Knife-like vocal effects that's been replaced by the sumptuous psych-pop balladry of ""Citizen"". ""Trap Doors"", already one of the album's catchiest songs, benefits from some extra synths and backing vocals, and ""October"" has a few new lyrics. Still, unlike its creators' best prior accomplishments, Broken Bells doesn't seem prepared, or even attempting, to cross over. Nor does it feel like a new direction or outlet for either artist-- it's more of a nice detour. In one of the record's more cheerful moments, amid the shambling acoustic guitar and slithering keyboard of ""October"", he shares some helpful advice: ""Don't run, don't rush, just float."" It's what he and Danger Mouse do here, and while that's hardly a recipe for breaking new ground, the results are rarely less than pleasant. Note: This piece as originally published was based on an earlier version of the album. The retail version includes differences that do not materially change the reviewer's opinion of the record. They are now accounted for above. We apologize for the oversight.","The Shins' James Mercer teams with producer and Gnarls Barkley member Danger Mouse for a melancholy pop record.

But while most of Titus' associates, whether it's Fucked Up, Spider Bags, or Vivian Girls, have some sort of relation to their beer-and-spittle soaked populist rage, Dinowalrus' influences are notable for their inaccessibility: Sonic Youth circa Bad Moon Rising, no wavers like Flipper and Glenn Branca. Yet that overstates %'s standoffishness-- judging from the song-length ambient break of ""I Hate Letters"" and the rafter-reaching, reverb-soaked ""I Hate Numbers"", the album won't be too prickly for anyone who still listens to Deerhunter's Cryptograms in its intended sequence. But where that album's flow was crucial, Dinowalrus stays true to its name by smashing incompatible parts together into an intriguing, if occasionally nonsensical, sonic blend. So much of ""Electric Car, Gas Guitar"", for example could've been explored further, from the exposed-wire synth shocks to the dub-like reverb effects, to squawking saxophone. About the only thing that holds it together is an almost joke-y baritone from Feigenbaum that barks lyrics like, ""A Chinese wall/ A toilet stall."" Dinowalrus are too chaotic to have memorable structure, but not unpredictable enough to bring to mind improv. The Steve Reich nod ""Bead"" straightens its cycling synths into a sturdy four-on-the-floor disco, but only for about a minute. Though this brief glance of coherence serves as one of %'s most exciting moments, shortly after it, Kyle Warren's vocals come off like a unholy midpoint between Comets on Fire's echoplexed wails and Lightning Bolt's megaphone cheerleading. It's enough to momentarily jar you out of a comfort zone, but like most of %'s abrasive effects, it doesn't quite burn hot enough to singe. There's an initially clever shift from warbly surf riffs to double-time cowpunk on ""Cage Those Pythons"", and ""Nuke Duke 'Em"" has a title as badass as its stun-gun guitar runs, but these brief glances of songwriting congruence only occasionally lift this 10-minute block from aimlessness. And ultimately, that puts a damper on what % could be. It's easy to gain the band's sense of sonic pranksterism, but from where does their passion derive? The Wire-y fuzz workout ""I Hate Numbers"" has an arena-sized chorus that provides a fresh wallop, but like most of the intelligible moments of %, it's more of a relief than anything else. ""Haze on the Mobius Strip"" tries for a similarly room-filling sound (for me it brings to mind Smashing Pumpkins' ""Porcelina of the Vast Oceans"") and eventually reaches a satisfyingly noisy climax, but the silo reverb lends too much distance for it to generate its intended impact. I'm sure it's all firecrackers live, and in their defense, Dinowalrus' populist-noise contemporaries (Liars, Oneida) needed periods of woodshedding to find their way. But I suppose it does the title justice when % finds a band that's not quite all there yet.","Led by a touring guitarist from Titus Andronicus, Dinowalrus create rapidly shifting songs that leap from spazzy guitar-pop to skronky noise.

Land of Make Believe,Kidz in the Hall,by: Zach Kelly,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a891c0084474cd0c0e61/1:1/w_160/1a5a4746.jpg,2010-03-10 06:00:03,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13994-land-of-make-believe/,Duckdown,"Looking at their track record, you could conclude Kidz in the Hall have been dealt a bad hand. Showing up a tad late to the backpack renaissance, Penn graduates Naledge and Double-O have spent three records now trying on several different hats, none of which fit particularly well or were worn comfortably. Maybe we just expected two Ivy Leaguers to make music that was challenging musically and lyrically; instead we got odes to drunk girls and corny self-esteem lectures. If that's how they want to get down, the more power to them. Land of Make Believe pitches itself as the most ambitious record of the duo's career, most notably thanks to Double-O's sample-free production. It's a clear attempt to steer from the classic hip-hop staples and try to update the Kidz's sound. Double-O always had a good ear for the soul-driven boom-bap that marked their debut and 2008's The In Crowd, so this route, albeit contemporary, removes a strength from his work. From the flat chip-tune bounce of ""Running"" (a ""Day 'N' Nite"" rip if there ever was one) to the diet-disco on ""L_O_V_E"", most of Land of Make Believe is going for a decidedly pop and ""now"" look, but one that often feels unnatural. The long list of guests here indicates a record in need of some padding, but most of these names provide little more than hook fodder. For every Kid Daytona (who does a pretty enjoyable Slick Rick on ""Out to Lunch"") there's a handful of unnecessary rappers and overly dramatic crooners adding to the already chintzy mélange. Most notable is Canadian goofball Colin Munroe, whose hook on the appallingly schmaltzy, big-album-moment ""Take Over the World"" (co-produced by Just Blaze) finally confirms that Mr. Hudson's feature fee is as dangerously high as we feared. Along with a lack of hooks, the real trouble lies with Naledge. He's always sported a decent flow and been able to pull off the occasional clever punch (opening ""Intro"" is a good example) throughout his career. Between being often either overvalued or undervalued, it's no wonder Naledge spends a good portion of Land of Make Believe explaining how much effort he expends trying to prove himself. Too bad he never really uses any of this space to actually make a case either way. Instead, most of Naledge's time is spent shrouded behind Cartier shades, talks about getting drunk like he's still a junior in high school, and making grandiose claims about his mic proficiency. Naledge often finds himself tangled in contradiction, or simply stuck in worn conceptual territory. The overwrought sex jams (""Bougie Girls"", ""Jukebox"") and flossing ad nauseam (""Fresh Academy"") might be tacky, but he's never as unbecoming as when his braggadocio lies in direct contention to his actual skill set. It's in these instances that the Kidz once again find themselves scrambling to catch up, no matter how they try and convince that they're in the lead.","Backpacker latecomers shift to make a record that picks up the Kid Cudi rap-pop baton.

Strange Keys to Untune Gods' Firmament,Skullflower,by: Grayson Currin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a896ea9e61561daa5860/1:1/w_160/e61a88d3.jpg,2010-03-10 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13999-strange-keys-to-untune-gods-firmament/,Neurot,"Don't enter Strange Keys to Untune Gods' Firmament-- a 12-track, 2xCD, two-hour-plus marathon of feedback-and-distortion charges for electric guitar and electronics from Britain's Skullflower-- casually. Sure, released by Neurot Recordings, it's one of the few titles in the band's two-decade run to have a substantial marketing push, but it's also one of the most extreme. Built on depth charges and swan dives into razing nine- and 14-minute instrumental immersions, and forgoing any pause between them, Strange Keys overpowers and exhilarates, the sort of record that rewards the commitment it demands with intensity and brutality. The history of British experimental legend Matthew Bower is perhaps the only thing more overwhelming about his discography: Since the early 80s, Bower has been a persistent if oftentimes overlooked presence in international sound exploration, first with his projects Pure and Total and then with Skullflower. That's the band that took Bower places, particularly to North American audiences, thanks to 1992's IIIrd Gatekeeper, reissued stateside on Crucial Blast in 2007. A lumbering, playfully psychedelic record that cut big-beat paths through a world of weird guitar tones and stretched riffs, IIIrd Gatekeeper served as an introduction for Bower, who's since proven to be one of music's most restless and prolific souls, rivaled in his own spheres only by Jandek and David Tibet for variety and output. In 1996, though, Skullflower disbanded. Bower busied himself with the often still, stately collaborations of Sunroof! and the earliest releases by his power electronics duo, the Hototogisu. After a seven-year break, Bower revived the handle for the LP Exquisite Fucking Boredom, a sprawling, gorgeous record that seems to revel in reverse. But on the closing track, ""Celestial Highway IV"", the sound bristles, the melody and beat wheezing beneath the pressure of static, noise, and a guitar line that won't sit still. By track's end, you can kind of trace a melody. That concept-- burying and occasionally revealing something familiar beneath a harsh flood of sounds-- has served as Bower's chief compositional device with the second incarnation of Skullflower. It's loud music-- really loud music-- that demands you sit close and listen up. Strange Keys ups the ante: Though ""Gateway to Blasphemous Light"" and ""Enochian Tapestries"" settle into moments of warped bliss, Strange Keys is generally relentless and tremendous, burying its themes in kaleidoscopic distortion. It's as if the comparisons that Bower has earned in the last seven years-- Merzbow, Wagner, second wave black metal-- finally took magnificent hold. All of those comparisons compute, too. In fact, together they are only parts of a much bigger musical picture, where dozens of sounds connect in a dense though meticulous web, waiting to be teased out and untangled by the listener. And in the end, devoting two hours at a time to Strange Keys and chasing down whatever phantom sounds you think you might hear at work is what makes this such a rewarding-- if difficult-and-demanding to irritating-and-impossible-- listen, especially on return spins. Something about ""City of Dis"", for instance, suggests the mechanical flux of a breathing machine, though its wide peaks-and-valleys motion recalls an all-star noise team scrambling the Death in June discography-- rigorous and mean with drama-- and dredging up an album that sounds nothing like the source. Similarly, ""Gateway to Blasphemous Light"" sounds as though every cheap black metal recording in the world-- you know, those early ones so loud that everything sounds like a smear-- was dumped into a 14-minute space and blurred together into one tidal piece. Most illustrative, though, are ""Rheingold"" and ""Blood Mirror Streams"", two seven-minute pieces on the altogether more-finessed second disc. They pile pounding sheets of noise above gentle, distended riffs, which poke out of the maelstrom like lone rays of light. In its loudness, it faintly recalls Fuck Buttons' *""*Sweet Love for Planet Earth"", where ruined tones hovered above house beats and chirpy keyboard melodies. That's all to say that, for its controlled destruction and distortion, there are moments here that suggest the possibility of redemption. Listen for them: You at least know you're bound to hear something else, too.","UK band creates an engrossing 12-track, 2xCD, two-hour-plus marathon of feedback-and-distortion charges for electric guitar and electronics.

Sure, the California leather jacketers came up a few years after the Dandy Warhols and Brian Jonestown Massacre, and more or less alongside Detroit garage-rockers like the White Stripes. But 2001 debut B.R.M.C. loudly heralded the rock-is-back swagger that would soon hit glossy magazines in the form of the Strokes, the Vines, and the Hives. As if that weren't enough, BRMC's stratosphere-pummel predicted not only the Jesus and Mary Chain reunion, the Magnetic Fields' Distortion, and A Place to Bury Strangers, but also last year's Verve-scale electro-shoegaze anthems by the Big Pink. Here in the future, though, the sneering young dudes who once asked ""Whatever Happened to My Rock'n'Roll"" now bear all the telltale signs of a band desperately flailing to live up to the dangerousness of their band name. In 2005, that meant divisive folk-blues change-up Howl. In 2008, it meant not-even-divisive insomniac-wank instrumental album The Effects of 333. Sixth studio outing Beat the Devil's Tattoo is already getting billed as the one that brings all these prodigal sons' (and daughters'-- ex-Raveonette Leah Shapiro is now on drums) stylistic detours back home. It kind of is, but if BRMC's sound has cohered, their songwriting has unfortunately done the opposite. So yeah, Beat the Devil's Tattoo assembles BRMC's full arsenal of swamp-stomp riffage, chain-gang acoustic blues, rawk-Spiritualized psych-gospel, endlessly repeated gothic nonsense, and effects-geek pedal farts. And no, of course, originality isn't necessarily a prerequisite for rock'n'roll fun times. So if someone apathetically intoning about whether he wants to ""feel love"" on a midtempo Velvet Underground guttersnipe castoff called ""Evol"" (yup) is enough to make you remember that, oh my gosh, you wanna feel love, then who am I to argue? Plus BRMC can sound surprisingly pretty when finding the tear in Ryan Adams' blandly folksy beer (""The Toll"", ""Sweet Feeling""); in a Grand Funk/Free way, their bluesy proto-punk jams (""Conscience Killer"", ""Shadow's Keeper"") or mythological T. Rex boogie (""River Styx"") can be mookishly satisfying-- big dumb fun. There's a fine line, however, between ""big dumb fun"" and ""insulting your intelligence."" The Ride-like whooshes of ""Mama Taught Me Better"" (main lyric: ""It brings me down""), are one thing, but finale ""Half State"" stretches the 1990s neopsych pedal play to an utterly excruciating 10 minutes. Witchy-woman screamer ""Aya"" and vaguely political lurcher ""War Machine"" feel like they were probably already somewhere in this band's catalog. And there's little fun for anyone, dumb or otherwise, on piano-pop comedown ""Long Way Down"". Besides, BRMC already had a release that brings together all their disparate elements: last year's solid, strobe-lit DVD/CD package Live, which actually has some memorable songs. Chalk it up to another case of being ahead of their time.","One of the original progenitors of the early-2000s ""rock is back"" ethos reckons with making music well after their original battles have been fought.

Damon Albarn and Jamie Hewlett's animated misfits have always been mainly interesting as a concept, and on much of the third Gorillaz album, Plastic Beach, it feels like Albarn and co. are ditching the idea of writing pop songs a cartoon band might front anyway. The one-time Blur frontman has transcended some of the post-modern artifice of this project, and created the group's most affecting and uniquely inviting album. Joke's over, Gorillaz are real. So why make this a Gorillaz album in the first place? It wasn't meant to be one. Hewlett, the celebrated Tank Girl co-creator, told The Observer last July, ""Gorillaz now to us is not like four animated characters anymore-- it's more like an organization of people doing new projects."" The project was to be called Carousel, presented by, but not performed by, Gorillaz. It never panned out. So Albarn devised Plastic Beach, a loose enviromental-song cycle warning against disposability. It's a noble conceit, if a transient one. Along with a typically diverse band of collaborators, Albarn dips into Krautrock, funk, and dubstep, as well as the weary, more melodic music he's been perfecting for much of last decade-- sort of an electronic take on baroque pop. Albarn also sounds more comfortable as a leader here than he has in some time. On the standout ""On Melancholy Hill"", he recalls the swooning strains of one of his heroes, Scott Walker. And when he shares or cedes vocals, he has the good sense to turn things over to luminaries like Lou Reed (magnificently dry-throated on ""Some Kind of Nature"") and Bobby Womack (good on first single ""Stylo"", better on the twangy ""Cloud of Unknowing""), while effortlessly integrating them into the sound. Handling most of the production himself, Albarn has reversed the good fortune of the first two Gorillaz albums. With Dan the Automator on their 2001 self-titled debut and Danger Mouse on 2005's Demon Days, the group was adept at fusing giddy pop with hip-hop, inserting De La Soul, Del the Funky Homosapien, or a yippy Miho Hatori into some of their best songs (""Clint Eastwood"", ""Dirty Harry"", ""Feel Good Inc."", ""19-2000""). Those songs crashed in from all places with little mind to sequence or balance, and the result was two fairly unfocused records saved by some decent alt-rap. On Plastic Beach, things are the other way around. The rap moments here feel almost needlessly idiosyncratic amidst the lusher treatments. Snoop Dogg's appearance on ""Welcome to the World of the Plastic Beach"" is an incongruous introduction to an album that has nothing to do with Snoop Dogg. De La repeat themselves on the faux jingle ""Superfast Jellyfish"". Grime MCs Kano and Bashy compellingly play pass-the-baton on ""White Flag"", but only after disrupting an absorbing intro and outro by the Lebanese National Orchestra for Oriental Arabic Music. Only on ""Sweepstakes"" is Mos Def able to assimilate into the production. Albarn is more natural when working in the kind of ornate Village Green Preservation Society-style pop that dominates Plastic Beach. His collaborations with Little Dragon, ""Empire Ants"" and ""To Binge"" are two of the most arresting things here-- they're airy, elusive, and amazingly beautiful. It's been years since Albarn has written anything as blatantly gorgeous. If he had to work past the animated pretense to rediscover it, all the better. Why be a cartoon when you can be a real person?","Ex-Blur frontman Damon Albarn ditches the idea of writing pop songs a cartoon band might front and makes one of his most gorgeous pop records in years.

"Wierd Presents: Cold Waves and Minimal Electronics, Vol. 1",Various Artists,by: Jonathan Garrett,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a7e59d034d5c69bf38ee/1:1/w_160/67452663.jpg,2010-03-09 06:00:04,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13843-wierd-presents-cold-waves-and-minimal-electronics-vol-1/,Angular,"Though its chilly sound owed an obvious debt to Joy Division's Unknown Pleasures and Depeche Mode's Speak & Spell, the music now grouped as minimal synth was more simplistic and primal in execution, existing well outside the expensive, studio-honed aesthetic of the time. The relatively short-lived genre ran concurrent with guitar-based post-punk and early new wave from the late 1970s to the mid 80s without enjoying the commercial success of either. Featuring the analog synthesizer as a foundation, minimal synth tracks were fleshed out with little more than a drum machine, vocals, and occasionally, a bass line. The limited sonic palette arguably enabled the ultimate DIY movement, with solo and duo minimal synth projects cropping up all across Europe. Paradoxically, the ubiquity of minimal synth in the European underground may have worked against its broader acceptance: the sheer number of acts made it difficult to form a consensus around its leading practitioners. Furthermore, many of the artists preferred singing in their native tongues, creating regional pockets-- in France and Belgium in particular-- as opposed to a truly pan-European movement. As a result, while minimal synth flourished on the stage, its recorded works were often consigned to regional European labels and quickly went out of print. The fragmented nature of the movement has also posed a formidable challenge to anyone hoping to offer a representative compilation. Cold Waves is not the first minimal synth retrospective, though it certainly stands as one of the best and most accessible. Assembled by Pieter Schoolwerth, founder of the Brooklyn-based Wierd Records, along with Joe Daniel of Angular, the compilation leans heavily toward DJ-friendly material. Wierd has been championing minimal synth, along with guitar-driven cold wave, since 2003, as part of its series of DJ nights in Brooklyn called Wierd Nights. Schoolwerth, meanwhile, has been an avid minimal synth collector for years, making him uniquely qualified to oversee Cold Waves for London label Angular. The album opens with the ferocious and sinisterly assertive ""Figures"", from Belgium's Absolute Body Control. An early tone-setter, ""Figures"" portends the aggressive fare to follow, and lithe, sinewy tracks like End of Data's ""Danse Votre Monde"" and Ausgang Verboten's ""Consumer"" deliver on that promise, favoring immediacy over subtle shading. Even the few restrained and pensive tracks, like ""A Gift of Tears"", from Italy's Jeunesse d'Ivoire, remain hauntingly elemental in construction. In this respect, Cold Waves remains true to minimal synth's fundamental tenet of simplicity, never sacrificing raw emotion for complex arrangements. While minimal synth is typically classified as a strictly European movement, two of the most arresting songs on Cold Waves come courtesy of North American artists. ""Watching Trees"" from New York's Eleven Pond has been a staple at Wierd Nights almost since its inception, and with its eerie, icy veneer, it's easy to hear why its become an anthem of sorts for Schoolwerth's weekly parties. Canada's Land of Giants offer the somewhat less severe but no less engrossing ""Cannibal Dolls"". The 1982 single features a playful, pinball rhythm that hints at the new wave movement that would follow even as Anya Varda's tense, strained vocal keeps it squarely within minimal synth's darkly paranoid tradition. That neither song sounds out of place is fairly remarkable considering their creators were an ocean removed from the epicenter of minimal synth, even if the seamlessness also suggests that, as minimal synth compilations go, Cold Waves might be a little too convenient. As other retrospectives have demonstrated, including the recent Minimal Wave Tapes, this music isn't as singularly focused or narrowly defined as Cold Waves might lead a newcomer to believe. However, as an introduction to this obscure movement, Cold Waves is tough to top. These songs may not have been popular in their day, but Wierd and Angular together have ensured they won't soon be forgotten.","A satisfying collection of the obscure synth-based music that drew from post-punk and early new wave in a decidedly low-budget and DIY style.

Double Jointer,Golden Triangle,by: Joe Colly,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a89dea9e61561daa5875/1:1/w_160/8a44b9ae.jpg,2010-03-09 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14007-double-jointer/,Hardly Art,"Though their recorded output is still pretty limited, Brooklyn's Golden Triangle have been kicking around for a while now. I first saw the group in summer 2008 as the opening act on a night Deerhunter debuted a lot of Microcastle material. That performance-- and Golden Triangle's chaotic stage presence-- stuck with me for some reason. I mentally tagged them as ""psychotic B-52's"" and followed along as they played a ton of other shows, many in Brooklyn warehouses, and put out a self-titled EP on Mexican Summer last year. Double Jointer is the band's first full-length, and it falls in line with the throwback garage-rock of Black Lips and King Khan, as well as the murkier scuzz-pop of Vivian Girls. The B-52's description wasn't totally accurate, but they build a ragged shimmy around co-vocalists Vashti Windish and Carly Rabalais similarly to how the Georgia group highlight Kate Pierson and Cindy Wilson. Mostly though, Golden Triangle remind me of the rockabilly side of punk. While you could very easily lump them in with the current shitgaze sound, there's an added tinge of madness that brings to mind bands like Gun Club and the Cramps. That's a bunch of comparisons to say that most of what you'll encounter on Double Jointer you've already heard in some form or another. Golden Triangle are kind of an amalgamation of many strains of rock from the past 30 years-- garage, rockabilly, punk-- but presented in a more spastic, dancier style. This could be a sticking point for some if the songs didn't work, but they're successful for the most part. The band is a six-piece, and behind singers Windish and Rabalais are four talented players, specifically guitarist OJ San Felipe, who develops oddly catchy hooks with fuzzy, asymmetrical guitar lines. Such is the case on tighter rockabilly tracks like ""I Want to Know"" and ""Death to Fame"", but the band often sounds best at their loosest. ""Jellyroll"" and ""Jinx"" have a nice herky-jerky quality to them-- almost a muddier form of doo-wop. ""The Melting Wall"", which comes late in the record, is arguably the best song here, and it's when Golden Triangle feel most at ease. On this one, they allow for lots of space, let the guitars rumble and growl, and have Windish and Rabalais trade vocals overtop the smoldering arrangement. And it's here that the band sounds most like they did that night in Brooklyn back in 2008. There's a spark and energy to the song that's missing from some of the others on the album, and it makes me think that, for now at least, Golden Triangle's music is still best absorbed in the live setting. These fuzzy, frenetic songs are ones you want to hear in a crowded club, bouncing along as you spill half your drink on the guy next to you. While most of Double Jointer's tracks are at least good, the band doesn't tap into that spirit often enough, and ultimately it leaves the album feeling a bit flat.","Hardly Art band's debut falls in line with the throwback garage-rock of Black Lips and King Khan, as well as the murkier scuzz-pop of Vivian Girls.

In Stereo,Fenn O'Berg,by: Marc Masters,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a89413d19756521396ab/1:1/w_160/b9c0a059.jpg,2010-03-09 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13998-in-stereo/,Mego,"In retrospect, it's pretty amazing that the first two Fenn O'Berg albums went so well. Side projects between established solo artists tend to produce more mediocrity than magic-- even if every participant is on point, the result often lacks the kind of intuitive communication that usually takes years to establish. But on 1999's Magic Sound of Fenn O'Berg and 2002's Return of Fenn O'Berg, Viennese laptop guru Christian Fennesz, British electronic wizard Peter Rehberg, and American multi-tasker Jim O'Rourke sounded like they'd been conversing sonically for a while. The fact that both albums came from the tightrope-walk of live performance made their chemistry especially impressive. Perhaps the only thing more impressive would be for that chemistry to survive a nine-year hiatus. Unfortunately, on In Stereo the Fenn O'Berg magic has faded. Recorded last fall in a Tokyo studio, it sounds more like the work of a project than a band. Even when things do click, there's an aura of predictability that never quite lifts, producing something that's hard to dislike but even harder to get lost in. Much of that effect is due to the trio's oddly limited palette. Previous albums were kaleidoscopic, filled with everything from cinematic string samples to robotic voices to cartoonish effects. Those many surprises meant repeat visits could reveal new colors and patterns. But most of the sounds on In Stereo-- windy whooshes, machine-like whirrs, shortwave squiggles-- are pretty run-of-the-mill for electronic music. The trio works hard to mix them up in new ways, and they succeed at least half the time. But the incessant familiarity weighs the album down. The more I listen, the more theses pieces seem to shrink rather than expand. Still, there is well-crafted sound on In Stereo. The title's no joke-- the trio makes good use of the stereo space, circling their sounds around each other so everyone has room to move. In ""Part V"", that 3D quality creates a busy mix, with high-pitched drones turning into underwater rumbles, rhythmic noise, and a beatific close that hints at Fennesz's best dream-scapes. Even better is ""Part VII"", which begins sharp and brittle as bed of needles, then crests into a wash of digital foam. In fact, skip around and pick a track here, a passage there, a note anywhere, and In Stereo sounds pretty good. But let it just play, and it slips past without much impact-- at least not the kind of impact Fenn O'Berg have made in the past. Of course, it was a risk for them to resurrect this project so long after their initial triumphs. Much transpired in the intervening years, both in their respective careers and within the many sub-genres of electronic music, and the range of new things to be said has narrowed. So you have to admire them for taking on this challenge, but the ambition of the task just isn't matched by the sounds applied to it. Yet I wouldn't bet against them getting it right if they try again. Let's hope it happens, because even though In Stereo has its moments, they don't deserve to be Fenn O'Berg's last.","Viennese laptop guru Christian Fennesz, British electronic wizard Peter Rehberg, and American multi-tasker Jim O'Rourke reunite for a third record.

The Brutalist Bricks,Ted Leo and the Pharmacists,by: Paul Thompson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a88ec0084474cd0c0e5b/1:1/w_160/07b0a522.jpg,2010-03-09 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13992-the-brutalist-bricks/,Matador,"Cred is essentially goodwill borne of good instincts. Ted Leo's got some fine instincts, and over the course of his career he's built up cred at an enviable rate. Lifers like Leo, unafraid of inserting passionate personal politics into ebullient guitar rock, don't come around too often, and few can boast a track record like his. The ease with which he synthesizes punk and its many roots and branches into something distinctly his own has only occasionally shown signs of slowing down. Still, you couldn't be blamed for being a little worried about Leo's dedication in the wake of his flimsiest full-band effort to date, 2007's Living With the Living. Living had its moments, for sure, but it was an overlong, unbalanced, occasionally sluggish record, one that felt especially weary in the wake of 2004's vitriol-guided Shake the Sheets. It felt almost instantly like one of those long, all-over-the-place punk records you admire and namecheck but don't ever pull out; the kind of thing that's historically ushered in the sunset of a once-firebrand career. The Brutalist Bricks, the first Pharmacists LP for the increasingly punk-leaning Matador, feels like a massive corrective to Living's letdowns. It runs 20 minutes shorter and has tauter, better tunes. After the bitter Shake the Sheets and the resigned Living, Bricks feels hopeful, purposeful, direct-- a mood helped along by the Pharmacists' most [#script:http://pitchfork.com/media/backend/js/tiny_mce/themes/advanced/langs/en.js]|||||| impressive musical showing on wax since 2003's masterful Hearts of Oak. One never doubted Leo's passion, but Bricks finds him sounding rejuvenated, a refugee from the Bush regime poking his head above ground after lying low for Living and finding that now's the time to get to work. Bricks kicks off with the throat-grabbing ""The Mighty Sparrow"", and from there, the stink of shrapnel hangs in the air through the rest of the proceedings. Leo, ceasing to shout only to peel off a blistering solo, sounds plenty invigorated, but it's the Pharmacists-- new bassist Marty Key, longtime drummer Chris Wilson and jack of many trades James Canty-- who seem to be straightening Leo's spine and providing these tunes with a solid backbone. Leo's sound, so expansive in The Tyranny of Distance days, has been pared down further with each subsequent record, and despite a few dubby touches and a bit more acoustic guitar, Bricks follows that path. These tunes feel distilled to their very essence, and the first half of the record feels more like one long earworm. The middle third of Bricks is where you'll find its best bits, none better than ""Bottled in Cork"". Leo's long been a master of the travelogue; this one details the experience of being an Jerseyite overseas through the Bush era, and providing tips on how not to come off as an American idiot. The lightly funky ""One Polaroid a Day"" finds an unusually husky Leo him bemoaning the loss of true experience to constant documentation; take note, bloggers. The more breathless ""Where Was My Brain?"" and ""Gimme the Wire"" manage to stick despite their breakneck paces, thanks to Leo's insistence here on piling hooks on top of hooks; largely gone are the long expository verses from the Hearts/Sheets era and the never-ending choruses of Living. But in distilling everything down to their essence, some of Leo's lyrical directness comes across a bit blunt-- not all, mind but there's a distinct lean towards sandwich-board fodder rather than the carefully constructed, metaphor-laced screeds of old. Few songwriters could kick off their best tune in years with a line like ""There was a resolution pending on the United Nations floor"" without inspiring either a yawn or a giggle, but Leo does it here with ""Bottled""; he pulls it off okay, but there are a few more metaphor-eschewing moments like these where Leo goes way literal. ""We all got a job to do and we all hate God"" is how he kicks off ""Woke Up Near Chelsea"", and it reads better than it sounds on record. The otherwise lovely ""Ativan Eyes"" begins with a too-clever nod to Marx: ""The industry's out of touch. The means of production are now in the hands of the workers"" just isn't a line that belongs in a pop tune, particularly one that implores someone to lay their hands on Leo just a couple stanzas later. Leo's still exceptionally adept at saying a lot in a small space but there are more than a few lines that feel a little too forceful no matter how many times you run into them, sitting slightly askew next to the richer images and more pointed jabs here. That occasional obtuseness is really the only thing keeping Bricks from the absolute upper-tier of Leo records; well, that, and ""Tuberculoids Arrive in Hop"", an unfocused, murky number that's serves as little more than a breather amidst the LP's hyperkinetic back end. Still, you hit play on Brutalist Bricks and these things seem, at best, like secondary concerns; weak spots and strained metaphors aside, the passionate, instinctual Bricks is the finest record from one of the greats in six rocky years.","After the slight letdown of Living With the Living, Ted Leo's new LP is hopeful, purposeful, direct-- an improvement on every level.

Sisterworld,Liars,by: Marc Masters,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a88cea9e61561daa584c/1:1/w_160/95f0b603.jpg,2010-03-09 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13991-sisterworld/,Mute,"Whatever or wherever Sisterworld is, it sounds like a pretty creepy place. The fifth Liars album is relentlessly tense-- not so much scary as surreal. Every track is shrouded in echo and anxiety, and often all the tension erupts into bursts of buzzing guitars or pounding beats. Not every dark cloud breaks into a thunderstorm, but it constantly feels like one is lurking around the corner. Despite such potential for surprise, overall Sisterworld isn't actually all that surprising compared to the rest of Liars' discography. For a band known for switching gears from track to track and album to album, this is the most thoroughly Liars-sounding record so far. It has the rhythmic insistence of Drum's Not Dead, the sleepwalking chants of They Were Wrong, So We Drowned, and the straightforward songwriting of Liars, often sounding like a streamlined update on the latter. The narrowed range brings increased depth, and it's intriguing to hear Liars focus on detail and texture rather than stylistic schizophrenia. It turns out refinement suits them as nicely as reinvention. Take ""Here Comes All the People"", which the band spent a year on, crafting its basic structure in Los Angeles and adding orchestral atmospheres in Prague. None of that guarantees quality-- it's possible to make crap in both L.A. and Prague. But Liars used this elongated process to give zoomed-in attention to each moment. So the trembling guitar line, high-pitched strings, and psychotic piano all fit together, like a puzzle whose picture isn't clear until the last piece is in place. When singer Angus Andrew ends the song by chanting ""counting victims one by one,"" the killer effect comes through lethal injection rather than a loud, blunt act. That mood continues into the meditative ""Drip"", a track that's almost all atmosphere, with Andrew murmuring, ""When will I awake from this dormant sleep?"" as if he has no say in the matter. Not everything on Sisterworld is so subdued. ""Proud Evolution"" grows into a persistent Krautrock-styled groove; the clicking ""No Barrier Fun"" has the catchy lilt of a nursery rhyme; and ""Scarecrows on a Killer Slant"" sounds like a warped version of Liars' slamming ""Plaster Casts of Everything"". Even ""Drop Dead"", a drunken march that sound ever ready to collapse, holds upbeat energy in its skewed sway. Still, the dominant mode here is creeping tension without tons of cathartic release. That tension is so well-crafted that it consistently engages, but 42 minutes of it might not completely win over every Liars fan, especially those drawn to their more raucous moments. Admittedly, some parts are easier to admire than they are to enjoy. But stick with Sisterworld as it builds, let it seep into your brain while you wait for its bulging seams to burst, and you might find yourself unable to turn your ears away. Eventually, Liars' commitment to their own creepy cause proves contagious.","Liars' relentlessly tense new album finds the always excellent band focusing on detail and texture rather than stylistic schizophrenia.

Time on a String,Ortolan,by: Stephen M.

Her years inform her craft but do not limit its scope. As the band-- which includes her sisters and sister-in-law-- backs her up with sympathetic arrangements built on early rock and contemporary indie pop, Cottingham expresses misgivings and uncertainties that accompany any person's search for self, no matter their age: ""I need the answers for this,"" she sings on the deceptively sunny ""Opposites"", ""but nobody knows how I'm supposed to say things when I don't even know how they go."" Such concerns, especially when expressed by a young woman not old enough to drink, are sometimes dismissed as naïve and inconsequential (see also: Taylor Swift, a fine songwriter often derided for lyrics that convey a similar perspective). While Cottingham may not have settled into her songwriting voice just yet, she definitely has something to say about her own insecurities and confusions, and moreover she has a seemingly contradictory means of saying it. Ortolan's most distinctive trait may be her deeply mannered vocals, which imply that, for her, performing means indulging certain protective eccentricities. Listen to her chew on a syllable like it's a pen cap, or stretch her vowels out like taffy. There's no way to spell out her pronunciation of the pronoun ""I"" phonetically. She's not an especially powerful singer-- she doesn't have much range or force-- but Cottingham manages to convey personality in her vocals. Her tics may turn off some listeners, but they reveal a confidence that Cottingham swears she doesn't have. ""If I hit the wrong chord, please don't take offense,"" she sings on ""Mirror Image"". ""I'm doing this more, but I don't mean to do the things that I do."" Despite her protestations, the music itself contains no such flubs, though it lacks the rawness of her songwriting. As produced by Smith, Ortolan can be resourceful and a bit too controlled. ""Once"" sounds like a sped-up ""Earth Angel (Will You Be Mine)"", which underscores the fairy-tale quality of the lyrics, while the rising keyboard line on ""Just Like Me"" is as much a hook as the vocal melody. Ortolan never really cut loose on Time on a String, which means they don't risk quite as much as Cottingham does, but they do provide a bubbly backdrop for her inner conflict, so that when her songwriting wavers-- as on ""Insist for More"", about a bratty child, or on ""Be So Bold"", about her own bookishness-- her family has her back, another protective scrim against the world. Even so, an intriguing friction between boldness and hesitation illuminates most of these songs, which makes closer ""Anything"" sound all the more triumphant when Cottingham sings, ""I'm ready for anything you give me, I'm ready for everything.""","Produced by Daniel Smith, the debut from this deeply mannered singer finds her backed by members of her family.

Between Buildings and Trees,Andrew Thomas,by: Andrew Gaerig,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a8925e6ef95969321241/1:1/w_160/72906242.jpg,2010-03-08 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13996-between-buildings-and-trees/,Kompakt,"In a genre-- ambient-- that tends toward the anonymous, Andrew Thomas is all but invisible. In both name and sound, Thomas, and his second full length, Between Buildings and Trees, seems like the product of a Random Ambient Artist Generator: a name you probably won't remember making music whose details you won't recall. All this despite Thomas gaining a foothold through repeat appearances on Kompakt's closely watched Pop Ambient compilation series. Not listening to-- or more appropriately not really hearing-- Between Buildings would be a mistake, though, as Thomas has collected 40-plus minutes of patient piano melodies and delicate loops. It's easy to compare ambient music to nature; Thomas' album title certainly isn't shying from this language (his only other full-length is entitled Fearsome Jewel and adorned with a macro photo of grass).  Between Buildings, though, conjures something more refined and fragile, like stemware or, well, the type of nice champagne you might drink out of stemware. Unlike on Fearsome Jewel, Thomas never saturates your speakers. Between Buildings seems far more interested in dusting airspaces, sprinkling sound around a room. Some majorly distended tones aside, there's very little bass on Between Buildings, which allows Thomas' wispy pianos to rise in the mix. It's a style that has often seemed too pale on the Pop Ambient comps, but spread over nine tracks it feels light and thoughtful. Thomas doesn't deal in monolithic movements-- perhaps they would scan as too intimidating, or too sturdy-- and most of the tracks on Between Buildings glide comfortably for four or five minutes. Parsing the individual compositions is a bit silly (it's difficult to imagine a situation in which you'd play just one) but Thomas' best moments usually come on the piano. ""Above the World So High"" moves from noir-y, stumbling progressions to a quiet, cleansing hum. Opener ""A Dream of a Spider"" builds a rhythm out of a hesitant, near-lurch. ""Net to Catch a Ghost"" (clearly there is a Random Ambient Track Titling App as well) is as threadbare and tender as its name suggests. Between Buildings often sounds like an album on which no two sounds ever come into direct contact. Even casual fans of ambient composition will recognize Between Buildings: It lacks for new methods, singular noises, or moods not relaxed and/or contemplative. Thomas' commitment to space, and the way his pianos and tones brush against it, makes Between Buildings consistently worthwhile. It would be wrong to say that Between Buildings beats this year's Pop Ambient installment, but only because Thomas' light drifts are coolly incapable of any action quite so forceful.","Kompakt ambient artist collects patient piano melodies and loops and crafts a quiet, delicate winner.

Nerve Up,LoneLady,by: David Raposa,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a89c9d034d5c69bf3abb/1:1/w_160/577c4487.jpg,2010-03-08 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14006-nerve-up/,Warp,"It's one thing, in 2010, to release an album that owes a college-loan-sized debt to all sorts of post-punk touchstones; it's a totally different thing, however, when such an album-- a debut, no less-- earns the breathless praise of famed UK music journalist Paul Morley for that very quality. It takes something extraordinary to inspire someone that was there for the birth and ascendancy of Gang of Four and Wire and Public Image Limited and Joy Division and any other notable group from that scene to pen something like, ""she might have been Fac 17/or she might have sung two shows with Section 25 and once met Blue Orchids around the back of a cinema showing Existenz."" In other words, Morley's not just saying that LoneLady does a fine job mimicking her musical idols, but actually positions herself as a worthy peer to those very same groups. Nerve Up is primarily the creation of singer/guitarist Julie Campbell, a native of Manchester who shows an uncanny ability to reinvigorate a sound that was seemingly beyond saving. When she slashes a pick across her guitar strings, there's no way to avoid using a word like ""sharp"" and ""angular"" in describing what emerges, and the way she sings-- agitated, clipped, in terse fragments-- perfectly complements those sounds. Campbell also employs a drum machine; it's presumably out of necessity, but the unerring precision of the backbeat does help maintain the sharpness of Nerve Up's edges. The combination of these elements gives the album a nervous, contagious energy that's evident the moment ""If Not Now"" starts, with Campbell furiously cycling through a two-note pattern on her guitar. Most of the songs on Nerve Up follow the same template-- guitar chords are fired off, cryptic phrases are aired out (""sun threaten the horizon like a black sign""; ""said a ghost is more solid than that""), and the drum machine hits it marks. Thankfully, Campbell finds enough wiggle room in this formula to keep things from stagnating-- where ""If Not Now"" and ""Early the Haste Comes"" hit the ground running, ""Intuition"" ass [#script:http://pitchfork.com/media/backend/js/tiny_mce/themes/advanced/langs/en.js]|||||| umes a cocky and confident swagger [#script:http://pitchfork.com/media/backend/js/tiny_mce/themes/advanced/langs/en.js]|||||| . Thanks should also be directed to co-producer and former Laika member Guy Fixsen (My Bloody Valentine, Pixies, Stereolab). Fixsen adds the right amount of polish to these proceedings without overwhelming the songs-- accentuating the pish of a faux-cymbal here, adding some reverb to Campbell's voice there. These touches are so slight as to seem inconsequential, yet they prove to be invaluable. And sometimes the touches aren't so subtle-- a song like ""Immaterial"" with its charming lope and Campbell's keening vocals, would probably sound like a long lost 4AD gem (from the days of Throwing Muses and This Mortal Coil) without much trouble. The gauzy sheen that the track is given, however, is so reminiscent of that sound, it'd be hard for folks of a certain age (cough cough) to not imagine the accompanying (and undoubtedly awkward yet charming) video. I don't doubt that Fixsen also had a hand in giving the title track-- a funky pop earworm that lets Campbell stand toe-to-toe with Goldfrapp and Róisín Murphy-- a little something extra to make it truly pop. And then, after nine tracks of this wonderful wall-to-wall skittishness, comes the album finale-- ""Fear No More"", a complete departure from what preceded it. It's a stark, spacious song that fills the void with a sepulchral guitar line, haunting background moans, what sounds like violin and balalaika, and Campbell singing about ""the furious winter"" and dreams of ""fields, lonely and sweet, like Montana or Idaho."" ""Fear No More""'s pensive yearning, however, is of a piece with the more up-front restlessness that permeates the majority of Nerve Up. Hopefully, this type of maneuver is proof that LoneLady, having shown an astonishing ability to express her voice using the sounds of others, will work extra hard to make sure she doesn't repeat herself.","Manchester singer/guitarist Julie Campbell proves the post-punk revival isn't a spent force on this, her debut LP for Warp.

The Winter of Mixed Drinks,Frightened Rabbit,by: Rebecca Raber,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a88213d1975652139682/1:1/w_160/85139ab0.jpg,2010-03-08 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13983-the-winter-of-mixed-drinks/,Fat Cat,"Though it has only been two years since Frightened Rabbit released their breakout sophomore album, Midnight Organ Fight, a lot has changed. The Scottish group began as a trio featuring brothers Scott and Grant Hutchison and their friend Billy Kennedy, but they blossomed into a quartet during their last tour and are now a five-piece with the addition of Make Model's Gordon Skene. The band's sound has also expanded. Having made a name for themselves with raw, confessional folk-rock driven by urgent guitar interplay and brutal percussion, Frightened Rabbit have left behind their folky beginnings and given in to their loudest, most blustery impulses for their third full-length. The Winter of Mixed Drinks is definitely more sophisticated than its predecessors. From the reverberating electronic buzz that swathes album opener ""Things"" to the spoken-word samples that lie underneath the droning ""Man/Bag of Sand"", Frightened Rabbit have muddled their simple melodies with arty effects, washes of shoegaze guitars, and baroque orchestrations. Tunes meander instead of galloping ahead toward a climactic chorus. Many songs are obsessed with oceanic motifs-- starting with the escapist maritime metaphors of the shuffling single ""Swim Until You Can't See Land"" and continuing through the sailing and floating imagery of the stomping ""Living in Colour""-- and the album is likewise murky and vast. The Hutchison brothers still write rousing anthems, but the slickness of their production or the tarting-up of their simple setup makes them sound a little more like other bombastic bands from the British Isles (like Muse) and a little less like the band that made those first two albums. One of the collection's best tracks, ""Not Miserable"", does manage to capture the dramatic crescendos of Midnight Organ Fight, but perhaps its title is a clue to Mixed Drinks' new sound. Frontman Scott Hutchison is, as he sings, not miserable anymore. Midnight Organ Fight was an account of his own terrible breakup, and though he doesn't necessarily sound happy throughout Mixed Drinks, he is definitely more optimistic and less heartbroken. ""I am not put-upon, I am free from disease, no grays, no liver spots, most of the misery's gone,"" he sings of his newly earned glass-is-half-full outlook. But it was more viscerally affecting to hear Scott's hangdog tales of how it's OK with him if you call out the wrong name during sex or how it takes more than fucking someone to keep warm than it is to hear him detail the frustration, purpose, or assurance of moving on and growing up. Midnight Organ Fight announced with its title that its underlying concern was sex (not getting it, not getting it from who you want, being unfulfilled by it), and the songs on this new album, though more lyrically complex, seem neutered by comparison. ""Majestic,"" ""grand,"" and ""arena-worthy"" are all words that could be used to describe this record. And when Frightened Rabbit play to their strengths and a song's chorus is sailing or Grant is pounding out stomping rhythms, it's hard to resist getting swept up in their pop fantasia. But the band's sound was always big, and their songs were always bursting with oversized emotion. The difference is that Midnight Organ Fight, recorded in two weeks, seemed spontaneous, and with its devastated post-breakup themes, it earned its aural space with its outsized emotional content. The glossy production of The Winter of Mixed Drinks coupled with its less personal/more universal storytelling, makes its songs seem bigger musically than their content deserves.","Frightened Rabbit's third studio LP finds them with a bigger, more sophisticated sound to match their newly-expanded band and a slightly sunnier outlook.

Over the past decade, their B-sides, radio sessions, and assorted rarities have been repackaged into a series of excellent reissues, which has made it easy to be a Pavement completist without blowing a lot of cash. It's all very accessible, but it's not easy to know where to start. Quarantine the Past, the first-ever Pavement retrospective compilation, solves this problem by providing a cheap and easy entry point to the band that represents the breadth of their songbook. The best-known songs are featured-- ""Cut Your Hair"", ""Gold Soundz"", ""Here"", ""Shady Lane"", ""Spit on a Stranger""-- but so are concert staples, fan favorites, and at least a couple of curveballs. The sequence is non-chronological, zig-zagging through the catalog and evenly distributing the obvious classics throughout the running order. It's important that a Pavement best-of not only focus on their singles, which often erred on the side of novelty and levity. The dark horses here are essential in sketching out the group's range, from the punky blast of ""Unfair"" and ""Debris Slide"" to the loose, stoned sound of ""Heaven Is a Truck"". ""Grounded"" is majestic, ""Shoot the Singer"" is wistful, ""Date With Ikea"" is a suburban anthem. ""Embassy Row"" is like an alternate-universe Pavement that could compete on modern rock radio with the likes of Weezer, and ""Box Elder"" is a platonic ideal of simple, lo-fi indie pop. Fans of the band may look over the tracklisting and wonder why some of their favorites didn't make the cut, but every song on this thing is an unimpeachable gem, and the collection presents a well-rounded summary of their distinct and varied body of work. Pavement were mainly a vehicle for the songwriting of Stephen Malkmus, who penned almost all of the band's material. In terms of rock archetypes, Malkmus is a true original. He's erudite but bratty, laid-back yet buttoned-up. He's an inscrutable goofball, a pragmatic romantic, an aloof charmer. His music is loaded with references to cultural history-- one of these songs is an imaginary history of R.E.M.-- but his nerdy impulses and arty affect is consistently overwhelmed by his casual coolness. There's an impossible ease and haphazard grace to this music. A lot of bands work very hard to make you appreciate their meticulous craft or browbeat you with hooks, but Pavement tossed off brilliantly composed pop songs with a shambling, carefree swagger. They made it sound easy, and maybe it was. The best kind of genius tends to come very naturally to people, like a side effect of just being themselves. In ""Frontwards"", Malkmus sings ""I've got style/ Miles and miles/ So much style that it's wasted,"" and that's pretty much him and his band in a nutshell. Malkmus' lyrics, central to the band's appeal, alternate between whimsical nonsense and epigrammatic quotables. The songs seldom slot neatly into readily identifiable emotional states or refer to specific experiences, instead falling into the liminal spaces between thoughts and feelings. Malkmus' words indicate context and supply the listener with rich imagery, but the real poetry is in the way his phrases flow with the melodies, and are offset by evocative guitar textures and unexpected noises. The group never compromised tunefulness for artiness, but mystique and abstraction were among their core values. In retrospect, certain lines ring out like statements of intent-- ""We need secrets,"" ""Tricks are everything to me."" The very best Pavement songs delight in curiosity and imagination, drawing connections between images and ideas as if everything in the world was full of character and significance. This is part of why, for example, a playful joke about the voice of Rush's lead singer in ""Stereo"" never gets stale. It's in the middle of a song that may as well be a sub-genre unto itself, bouncing about gleefully, utterly fascinated by the all the obscure details of the world. They found the magic in the mundane, and could make small enthusiasms, silly in-jokes, and skewed observations seem profound and glorious. A decade after the band's dissolution, Pavement's music has proven itself to have an evergreen quality. To be sure, it's all very much of its time and no band aside from perhaps Guided By Voices better epitomizes the sound and style of 1990s indie rock, but the material transcends its era as much as it defines it. This compilation exists mainly to get an entry-level Pavement product on the market to coincide with their reunion tour, but it has a value beyond crass commercial necessity. Unlike other cross-generational legacy bands like the Pixies, Sonic Youth, and Talking Heads, Pavement's songs fit together comfortably as a jukebox-friendly hit parade. Some tracks, like the Spiral Stairs showcase ""Date With Ikea"" and the early EP cut ""Mellow Jazz Docent"", shine brighter than in their original contexts, while numbers like ""In the Mouth a Desert"" and ""Gold Soundz"" come out sounding like modern standards. As much as their albums excel as unified works, no one ever needed to hear those records in full to fall in love with ""Cut Your Hair"", ""Shady Lane"", or ""Range Life"" on MTV, college radio, or someone's mixtape. Quarantine the Past doesn't replace the albums, but it's a highly listenable alternative that is as much a treat for nostalgic older fans as it is a valuable gateway for new listeners.","The first career-spanning Pavement comp contains their best-known songs as well as concert staples, fan favorites, and at least a couple of curveballs.

Hologram Jams,Jaguar Love,by: Eric Harvey,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a8679d034d5c69bf3a2d/1:1/w_160/5f7d3ab3.jpg,2010-03-05 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13959-hologram-jams/,Fat Possum,"First things first: though much of Hologram Jams sounds superficially similar to Jaguar Love's 2008 debut Take Me to the Sea, the band and the music have been through a few important changes. Or more specifically, given that these guys are known to shout themselves out like rappers, and lead singer Johnny Whitney runs his own fashion line (the new LP also comes with a limited edition wristband for folks who pre-ordered), it's probably better explained as a rebranding. Whitney became increasingly fond of writing songs on a drum machine, which led to the release of drummer Jay Clark, and Whitney and Cody Votolato (both formerly of the Blood Brothers) reappeared as a duo with more of a dance flavor and switched labels from Matador to Fat Possum. Take Me to the Sea is still a good record, but its uniquely psychotic fusion of hardcore, heavy metal, glam, electro, and kitsch was also Jaguar Love's central problem: It's highly combustible and can't last forever. Instead of blowing up and starting over, however, Whitney and Votolato opted to slim down the band's concept along with its ranks. As an unfortunate side effect, they've more or less drained everything vital and exciting out of the first album, and replaced those ingredients with generic equivalents. Hologram Jams (that title remind you of Oracular Spectacular or Robotique Majestique?) is a vastly inferior record to Sea, replacing the dynamic punk psychedelia of their debut with sugary overstimulation and rank nostalgia. There's no better encapsulation of the record's overall tone than ""Everything Is Awesome"", which fleshes out a sentiment fit for a puffy sticker at the top of a fifth grader's A+ paper with exhortations like ""you are the ultra-star"" and ""you're glowing in the dark"" over boilerplate dance-rock signifiers. On the whole, the first three-quarters of Jams is more or less a list of stuff that the band thinks is totally rad: drinking 40s, ""Immigrant Song"", staying up all night, starting fires, cherry soda, puking up said cherry soda on the lawn after a party, riding a ""motherfucking mastodon,"" graveyards. Like the title, these things aren't just annoyingly deployed in the manner of a 15-year-old's Facebook page, they feel target marketed, a strategically laid-out shop window display devoted to spazzy youthful dumbassery. The music follows suit: For a conceit so superficially high-energy, the dirty repetitiousness of the synths, drum machines, and modern-rock guitars are stunningly bland and repetitious. This until the shock of recognition of the album's last song, which, yes, is a cover of ""Piece of My Heart"". Which... no. At best, the cover is a bad aesthetic choice rendered unimaginatively. At worst, it feels like a cheap attempt to manufacture a show-closing sing-along that appeals across demographics. The stylistic shifts on Jam suggest that Jaguar Love know exactly what they're doing and why they're doing it, even if the new direction isn't a step forward. And though you could argue that Jaguar Love have succeeded in making their music register on a physical level, the primary sensation I'm getting here is exhaustion, and not the fun kind. The deeper and longer I immerse myself within their nihilistic high-fructose corn syrup soundworld-- ""Sugar-coated cherry soda/ It's like the future's over""-- the more I want to crash on the couch with a bad headache.","These former Blood Brothers are now a duo with a stronger dance-rock flavor; somewhere along the line, something went very wrong.

Lights,Ellie Goulding,by: Stephen Troussé,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a8905e6ef9596932123a/1:1/w_160/48744df7.jpg,2010-03-05 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13995-lights/,Polydor,"In the UK it's hard to hear Ellie Goulding above the hullaballoo of the hype-cycles. Tipped in January as the sound of 2010 in two tastemaker polls, she's received distinctly underwhelmed reviews now her album has been released. It's an odd record to have been caught in the crossfire: There's no high concept or big personality, it doesn't ride any particular fashion wave or nostalgia agenda. Instead critics have seized upon a sense of contrivance, the idea that UK pop culture is meme-splicing from the recent past, and that Goulding has been cynically designed to hitch the nu-folk fad of 2008 (Laura Marling) to the 1980s pop vogue of last year (Little Boots) and achieve full-spectrum media approval from Mojo to Popjustice. And so she's getting shot by both sides: not folky enough for purists, not sensational enough for the pop crowd, but mid-market, middlebrow-- the new Dido. If she'd been born Else Goldsdottir, and hailed from Helsinki rather than Hereford, Goulding probably wouldn't have these problems. Maybe it's because ABBA started out in folk groups, but the Scandinavians seem more comfortable with the idea of a confessional pop that marries immediacy with intimacy. Goulding would fit in perfectly alongside Lykke Li, Jenny Wilson, even Robyn. Outside of its immediate context, Lights is a sometimes great, always promising debut. It's an album about leaving home, and it works best when the contrast between the folk singer and the pop production chimes with the tensions between the pull of home and the allure of the city. ""Guns and Horses"" may be the best opening invitation for travel since ""Two Divided by Zero"" kicked off the Pet Shop Boys' Please: ""Let's join forces, we've got our guns and horses...."" It builds from spare acoustics to urgent trance pop-- ""I left my house, left my clothes, door widen open, heaven knows, but you're so worth it, you are...""-- concluding with a desperate a cappella coda, and a brief breathless chuckle at her casual audacity. ""Wish I Stayed"" is apparently the first song that Goulding emailed to Vincent Frank (aka Frankmusik, south London's bedroom pop auteur) as an acoustic songwriter. It's still the song that best captures the tensions of Lights, with Goulding singing of ""skipping ropes, trampolines"" and crafty schoolgirl smokes. It's reminiscent of the suburban pop of the Sundays (if they'd had an electro makeover like their forbears Everything But the Girl)-- the details of small lives and sitting room triumphs, the low horizons and ""the carelessness of running away."" Lights is mostly produced by Frank's protégé Starsmith, and he does a largely good job, notably on the euphoric e-rush of ""Starry Eyed"" and ""Under the Sheets"", a grand, almost Björkian hyperballad. On the negative side, ""The Writer"" is a big bluster of a song, with a chorus where the spectre of the Cranberries' Dolores O'Riordan is all too vivid, whose future success could be Goulding's undoing. The cheap tinsel backing track to ""I'll Hold My Breath"" is reminiscent of Wham!'s ""Last Christmas"", while ""Your Biggest Mistake"" could be a Frankmusik cast-off. But at its best Lights feels remarkably uncontrived, cantering across genres, following personal whims and visions rather than marketing agendas. Unusually for a British pop debut album, it doesn't seem desperate for the immediate approval of chart success. You get the feeling Goulding could write another album or two (after Lights, Cameras, and then Action) before she really gets going, becoming the sound of 2012 or 2015 or whenever. Whether the UK pop industry has the patience to bear with her remains to be seen.","Hailed as a UK buzz artist for her blend of folk and pop sensibility, this newcomer is more akin to Scandinavians Lykke Li and Jenny Wilson.

Jet Lag,Josiah Wolf,by: Larry Fitzmaurice,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a8615e6ef959693211cb/1:1/w_160/6d1ce0e6.jpg,2010-03-05 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13953-jet-lag/,Anticon,"The songs on the debut full-length from WHY? drummer Josiah Wolf were inspired by the dissolution of an 11-year relationship, as well as Wolf's move back to the Midwest after years of living in California. Dropping a breakup album for your first LP seems a risky move. Listeners are just starting to get to know you, after all. But considering his last solo outing, the scrappy song-sketch collection The Josiah EP, was self-released all the way back in 2003, maybe he had to make this record at this time. If only to get it out of his system. Jet Lag indeed has its share of emotional baggage, although it's hard to tell if it's getting unloaded, or simply re-packed for a later trip. These songs are filled with observations, open-ended questions, and musings on post-breakup life, but with little resolution. ""The New Car"" revolves around the purchase of a vehicle to ""help with the separation,"" detailing a failed attempt to pawn a mattress as well before Wolf sighs, ""But when you told me/ That I wasted your twenties/ I didn't know what to say."" Meanwhile, ""Unused 'I love you's build up"" in his throat in the somewhat cornily named ""The Apart Meant"", after expressing the lonely sentiment that ""For 11 years/ We didn't touch another/ And now I can't sleep,"" in ""Skull in the Ice"". Lyrically, Wolf is convincing when sticking to the grief-stricken script. It's when he goes off-book that things start to get awkward. ""Master Cleanse (California)"" and ""The Opposite of Breathing"" opt for a wide-eyed and spiritual tone, but their offbeat musings on praying naked in the shower and waiting for ""Thomas Edison/ With seven heads/ To come from the sea"" sound forced. Later, attempts at surrealism, like the adolescent wet dreaming detailed in ""That Kind of Man"", stumble out of the gate and suggest that Wolf doesn't share his brother's talent for crafting absurdist yarns that hold a weird car-crash fascination. If Wolf could be accused of lyrical overcompensation, the opposite could be said about the music. ""The Opposite of Breathing"" and ""The New Car"" represent the sort of competent but dull chamber-pop that litters much of the record, where the jammed-together folksy melodies of ""In the Seam"" and ""The Apart Meant"" sound less like actual songs and more like half-decent ideas haphazardly grouped together. Listeners coming to Jet Lag expecting the bizarre pop mutations of WHY?'s 2008 career-high Alopecia-- or even its more straightforward cousin, last year's Eskimo Snow-- are going to be disappointed. Wearing your heart on your sleeve is one thing, but musically, Josiah Wolf isn't really taking any risks here. Nonetheless, Wolf's anguish comes over as real and consuming, and Jet Lag's highlights offer an occasionally compelling look at his darkened mindset. Opener ""The Trailer and the Truck"" stretches and yawns via elongated guitar bends and bursts of concentrated drumming, while ""Is the Body Hung"" rolls with freak-folk touches and Wolf's cracked vocals. Most affecting, however, is the spooked folk closer ""The One Sign"", in which Wolf likens a plane crash to the slow dread of uncertainty, before uttering a final epitaph: ""'Heaven help me' are just words/ That time will make you say."" Time heals all wounds, sure. If and when Josiah Wolf decides to make another record, here's hoping he'll be newly restored by then.","The WHY? drummer and brother of Yoni Wolf steps out with a solo LP inspired by a breakup.

Fight Softly,The Ruby Suns,by: Andrew Gaerig,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a872b1335d7bf16992ae/1:1/w_160/248fa37e.jpg,2010-03-05 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13969-fight-softly/,Sub Pop,"Pop music success requires good timing-- no local or unsigned band will debate this-- and the Ruby Suns have shitty timing. Their breakthrough album, Sea Lion, dropped in the early spring of 2008; it was a fun, loose take on Panda Bear's seaside psychedelia. Last summer, many indie fans fell hard for a smattering of artists-- Washed Out, Neon Indian-- that echoed the same big-wave aesthetic as the Suns. Justice would see head Sun Ryan McPhun return to claim a spot at the picnic table, but Fight Softly mostly abandons the gentle soufulness and playful strums of Sea Lion in favor of stale electronics and busy loops. The departure from Sea Lion is apparent immediately: Twinkling ambience and dollops of synthesizer open Fight Softly. The rhythms remain bouncy and ebullient, but simple, slapping drum machines weigh them down. The Suns used to sneak in bits of odd percussion and puns on world music (""Kenya Dig It?""), but McPhun's sound design is unable to harness that kind of nuance and adventure. The resulting compositions seem full of color but lacking in depth or space: drum thwacks and buzzing keyboards caulk every track. McPhun has taken to singing with melisma, twisting simple lyrics into meandering phrasings. He takes almost 30 seconds to sing the album's first line: ""It's my turn in the front seat"" (many of his lyrics address this sort of innocence and alienation). At his best, like on ""Closet Astrologer"", he recalls Arthur Russell's awkward, thrilling navigation, but McPhun often lacks Russell's coy balance. McPhun's voice seems incongruous with his songwriting. He seems languid and relaxed over ""Cinco""'s aggressive shifts. On album closer ""Olympics on Pot"", he idles over sweet, furtive drumming. (For those of you who cried foul about Animal Collective lyrics like those in ""My Girls"": sharpen your knives.) ""How Kids Fail"" is almost oppressively anthemic, its huge keyboard stabs weighing down one of the album's better verses. ""Cranberry"" inexplicably shifts from a charging, abstract march to a plodding pop song to a rummy party jam. Fight Softly constantly jars and pivots, but with little purpose. Animal Collective remain the obvious sonic touchstone for the Ruby Suns-- damn if ""Dusty Fruit"" doesn't sound like a diet version of ""Brother Sport""-- but McPhun's best work exhibits a surprisingly formalist synth-pop streak. ""Haunted House""'s bouncing pads and treated vocal samples sound like a pillowy Cut Copy. The penultimate ""Two Humans"" is a delicate love ballad-- ""When are you leaving?/ And will you stay the night""-- that sounds like the Junior Boys on vacation. ""Closet Astrologer"" is a paean to introverts that tries to parse young adulthood (""I'll find time to do what I want/ Whatever that is""). These moments aren't indicative of Fight Softly's general tenor, though. The album sits heavily, uneasily, even when its mood is light. It's a true departure in sound and method; this is not a lazy or complacent record. McPhun, though, never settles into these new sounds, and Fight Softly retains very little of the ease and abandon that, to date, had marked the Ruby Suns.","A louder, thicker album from New Zealand-based outfit known for combining live instruments and samples in a swirl of psychedelic color.

Oar,Record Club,by: Ryan Dombal,Features Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a893b1335d7bf16992f3/1:1/w_160/7816da2c.jpg,2010-03-05 06:00:00,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13997-oar/,self-released,"On October 10, 2008, I was ready to give up on Beck. That night, the singer looked too embarrassed, bored, or confused to make his show at Manhattan's United Palace Theater anything more than a depressing dud. It wasn't like the album he was touring behind, Modern Guilt, was exceptional, and the same could be said of his previous few LPs, too. Meanwhile, his website was a lumbering, flash-based nightmare that was successful at crashing browsers but little else. At that point, it seemed like a good idea for longtime Beck fans to cut and run. But perhaps Beck was growing weary of himself around that time as well, because 2009 marked an under-the-radar creative comeback for one of the alternative era's most beloved stars. His team-up with the increasingly ineffectual Danger Mouse on Modern Guilt was so-so, but it apparently spurred his collaborative spirit as he went onto write and produce Charlotte Gainsbourg's surprisingly stunning IRM. And he completely overhauled his website, swinging his online presence from worst to damn-near first almost overnight. The best feature of the new web space is Record Club, which finds Beck and some (usually quite famous) friends covering an entire album in one day. Along with people like MGMT, Devendra Banhart, Nigel Godrich, and brother-in-law Giovanni Ribisi, Beck tackled the Velvet Underground & Nico's 1967 debut and Leonard Cohen's 1967 bow Songs of Leonard Cohen via weekly videos across the second half of 2009. According to a modest disclaimer on the Record Club homepage, ""There is no intention to 'add to' the original work or attempt to recreate the power of the original recording,"" and, aside from a few flashes of offhand greatness-- usually occurring when the players took more liberties with their source material-- the covers were passable trifles. But hey, seeing Beck, MGMT, and Devendra goofing around in pixelated home movies was a lot more fun than seeing Beck halfheartedly rehash his old hits live. With Record Club number three, the ante was officially upped: This time Beck wrangled Wilco, Feist, Jamie Lidell, legendary session drummer James Gadson (Diana Ross, Marvin Gaye, the Jackson 5), and others to take on Skip Spence's 1969 cult favorite Oar. And most everyone stepped up to the task-- this is the best, most focused Record Club yet, at times transcending the project's transitory, celebrity-cover-band conceit. Spence originally recorded Oar after a six-month stay at New York's Bellevue Hospital, where he was deemed schizophrenic. (The onetime Jefferson Airplane and Moby Grape member was committed after hacking a bandmate's door down with an ax during a particularly rowdy LSD trip.) The Summer of Love hangover LP was predictably all-over-the-place-- at times funny, dark, psychedelic, folky, somber, spiritual. And, if nothing else, Beck's diverse group do an admirable job of conveying the album's infinite tangents and possibilities; their many-voiced approach could be descended straight from Spence's cracked psyche. Since each song comes packaged with its own in-studio video, Record Club gives people a rare glimpse at not just an artist's sound but their creative temperament as well. With this in mind, the undoubted star of Oar is techno twiddler-cum-soul blower Jamie Lidell, who grabs the spotlight on two of the project's most offbeat covers and can be seen spreading merriment throughout. Locking in with Gadson, Lidell transforms folk-blues tracks ""Cripple Creek"" and ""Books of Moses"" into skeletal funk workouts while losing none of Spence's tortured soul. Feist nails her lone solo vocal performance on one of Oar's more indelible tunes, the harrowing lament ""Weighted Down"". Instead of trying to match the original's heft, the crew wisely backs her with bubbly, Midnite Vultures-style electro-pop and a virtuosic, hummingbird-like solo from Wilco guitarist Nels Cline. And this project's finest moment is also one of the simplest; woozy strut ""All Come to Meet Her"" is stripped down to a near-a cappella hymn with almost everyone involved forming a half-circle around a microphone. As the voices of Beck, Jeff Tweedy, Lidell, and others blend into one, it's like hearing the imagined goal of Record Club brilliantly coming to life. Elsewhere, Tweedy does his best with the album's sillier songs, including innuendo-laced sex romp ""Dixie Peach Promenade"" and the skewed ""Margaret/Tiger Rug"", but not even he can make such hippie nonsense vaguely contemporary. (He fares better singing with Feist on ""Broken Heart"", which could pass for a Wilco outtake.) And then there's Beck himself, who takes lead on the least-risky covers, ""Little Hands"" and ""Diana"", and often looks more content directing traffic on the sidelines. In fact, when it comes to Beck, the session's most enlightening moment is featured in a behind-the-scenes mini doc posted in January. In it, we see Gadson and Lidell in a heady funk, grooving on ""Books of Moses"". Then the camera turns to Beck on the other side of the studio glass, debating whether to fade the jam out or let it ride. ""Let's fade it, we've got like 10 more songs to do,"" he says-- a disappointing-yet-logical choice indicative of his latter-day mien. Then he just stands there, smiling and nodding for a few more seconds. ""I hate killing it-- let's fade it back up,"" he tells the engineer, laughing. He's not ready to call it quits just yet.","Beck continues his inspired work leading famous friends in covers of older albums. Wilco, Feist, Jamie Lidell here help him tackle Skip Spence's cult classic.

Nigeria Afrobeat Special: The New Explosive Sound in 1970s Nigeria,Various Artists,by: Douglas Wolk,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a87bb1335d7bf16992c1/1:1/w_160/608908e4.jpg,2010-03-04 06:00:04,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13978-nigeria-afrobeat-special-the-new-explosive-sound-in-1970s-nigeria/,Soundway,"Of course, hardcore Afrobeat collectors will tell you, the genre was more than just Fela Kuti-- I mean, he was very important, nobody's going to deny that, but he was only part of an evolving tradition, only part of a lively scene. Soundway's Nigeria Special series has found some remarkable stuff in the crates, mostly from what was happening elsewhere in Nigerian music in the 1970s; this fifth volume turns its attention to Afrobeat proper, and that means grappling directly with Fela's legacy. Nigeria Afrobeat Special kicks off with an actual Fela Ransome Kuti & His Africa 70 recording: The single version of ""Who're You"", from 1971. It's an extraordinary record-- as promised, it's a harder, brasher take than the more familiar one from Fela's London Scene, a crazily taut, rubbery rhythm whose lyric is Fela snapping back against old-timers who didn't get his new thing. It's also the best thing on Afrobeat Special by a significant margin-- tight, cleverly constructed, and rhythmically on-point in the way that not much else here is. That's fine if you're a Felaphile: One way to understand the impact of a major pop artist is to listen to the people who ripped them off, and figure out which parts of their work caught on with their peers. (The recent Black Man's Cry: The Inspiration of Fela Kuti compilation of international Fela covers and impersonations is enthusiastically recommended to anyone who thinks they might enjoy hearing three consecutive steel band covers of the same Fela tune.) Nigeria Afrobeat Special focuses on obscurities rather than hits; apparently, even third-rate Nigerian bands' drummers in those days were pretty great. The slowly bubbling instrumental ""Gbomojo"", by Segun Bucknor's Revolution, is like a Silly Putty impression of Africa 70, but it's not bad in its own right. Eric Showboy Akaeze & His Royal Erico's ""We Dey Find Money"" suggests that he'd figured out that Afrobeat songs were supposed to be long and include some horn parts and keyboard solos, but that he hadn't picked up on how to structure one so that it stayed interesting for ten minutes, or worked out how to keep his band playing at a consistent tempo. A lot of the artists here were dance bands first and foremost-- calypso, highlife, whatever moved the crowd-- and in the early 70s, Nigerian clubgoers wanted to hear Afrobeat. Saxon Lee & the Shadows International, whose 1973 ""Mind Your Business"" is the second-catchiest tune here, were a long-running act who glommed onto Fela's grooves the way American funk groups shifted into disco a few years later. There are touches of American funk here, too: The hop-and-stomp intro of Anansa Professionals' ""Enwan"" could be a Charles Wright & the Watts 103rd St. Rhythm riff. In some ways, Fela is to Afrobeat what Bob Marley is to reggae: The outsize figurehead who frustrates serious fans by being the genre's alpha and omega to musical tourists, the father of an ongoing bloodline and franchise. There was more to 70s Nigerian pop than Afrobeat-- the earlier volumes of Nigeria Special have made that clear. But all the evidence from this reissue, as with others in the last decade or so, is that Fela and his immediate circle really did have a lock on the best of the form he invented.","The fifth volume in Soundway's Nigeria Special turns its attention to Afrobeat proper, featuring both Fela Kuti and just some of those indebted to him.

Draumalandid,Valgeir Sigurðsson,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a87c9d034d5c69bf3a5d/1:1/w_160/42588728.jpg,2010-03-04 06:00:03,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13976-draumalandid/,Bedroom Community,"Northern European film soundtracks and dramatic scores don't get a lot of attention, but they could arguably be their own pop music subgenre at this point. From Jóhann Jóhannsson's Englabörn to Erik Enocksson's Man Tänker Sitt, they often contain similar ingredients-- gothic strings, terse pianos, haunting vocals, and a melancholy atmosphere. But due to the format and the potency of the style, you can actually get away with making some very slight music. At minimum, you have to write only one memorable, stirring theme. Record it in a string-led arrangement, and again in a piano-led one. Stash allusions to it in a bunch of filler drone you use to glue things together and, voila, you're done. But on Draumalandid, a soundtrack for a new Icelandic environmental documentary, Valgeir Sigurðsson goes the extra mile to produce work that stands up against the best of its genre. He lays the requisite foundations in place, with a palette of classical instrumentation and severe electronics. The powerful title motif he concocts for strings on ""Dreamland"" is reprised on ""Draumaland"", now scored for mercurial pianos wrapped in wheezing pump organ. But Sigurðsson isn't content to let his themes just sit there; he works them through a variety of mutations, climaxes, false endings, and codas. A bevy of collaborators, culled from Sigurðsson's own Bedroom Community label, inject their personalities and prevent the album from being stylistically monolithic. Sigurðsson has an illustrious career as a producer and engineer. He's worked with Björk on numerous albums, plus CocoRosie, Ben Frost, Sam Amidon, Will Oldham, and Nico Muhly. His first and only solo LP to date, 2007's Ekvílibríum, predicted the magisterial classical/electronic style he explores here. But as a producer first, he knows how to use his collaborators effectively. Amidon and Muhly appear on opener ""Grylukvæði"", the best and most distinct track here. Amidon has one of the most inviting voices around today, and his Icelandic folk song, flecked with banjo, sounds wonderful, glinting through a rich haze of strings and crackling with space-transmission interference. And Ben Frost threads subliminal disturbances through the Death Star strings of closer ""Helter Smelter"". But most of the record's success stems from Sigurðsson's commitment to making the music a drama unto itself, not just a supplement for existing drama. In the final minute of ""Dreamland"", a simple 4/4 thwack appears, but it does wonders, turning the stately dirge into a desperate march. ""Past Tundra"" seems like it's going to be pleasant but nondescript, until the mighty bass chords kick in, the string section starts to cook, and the piece veers off on a warpath you'd have never predicted from its beginnings. There are other gradations of tone, some effective (""Beyond the Moss"", where stripes of melody lick out of loose, jazzy clutter), some less so (a trio of brief, negligible interstitials in the middle of the album).

Constellations,Balmorhea,by: Grayson Currin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a88bea9e61561daa584a/1:1/w_160/cfaf2029.jpg,2010-03-04 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13990-constellations/,Western Vinyl,"It doesn't take an expert to access information or express an opinion. With no qualifications except a keyboard and an Internet connection, anyone can publish simple thoughts on complex ideas for all the world to read. Now that we're instantly able to procure so much data and to proffer so many notions, editing and restraint seem to be slipping more and more out of fashion. Content is a matter of quantity, not quality or precision. Announcing overwhelms analyzing. After all, if everyone is talking, why not say everything you think, as emphatically as possible, and see what sticks? I tweet. I know how it goes. That's what's most surprising about Constellations, the fourth album by Austin instrumental ensemble Balmorhea. Instead of going for the quick cinch or the grand statement, the quintet focuses its sound. Eschewing the need for frequent climaxes, Balmorhea practice patience across the group's most satisfying LP to date. Constellations begs for more rather than delivering all of the goods all of the time. Perhaps that's an old-fashioned concept-- demanding the sort of patience and attention that technology's made obsolete. But at this point, it's exactly the move Balmorhea needed to make. In retrospect, Balmorhea's first three albums seem packed with enthusiasm, each new track presenting another of the band's ideas. On 2008's Rivers Arms, Balmorhea-- then a duo of multi-instrumentalists Michael Muller and Rob Lowe, recording with a guest string section and guitarist-- paired acoustic miniatures and grand piano anthems with musique concrète foundations and electroacoustic experiments. By the time Balmorhea recorded 2009's All Is Wild, All Is Silent, they'd assembled a full band with drums, banjo, upright bass, more strings, and more guitars. They put the sextet to heavy-handed use: Many tracks employed a combination of marching drums, strident violins, group shout-alongs, and aggressive guitar strums. As involving as those records are, they're also a bit exhausting, so busy that they're better suited for quick bursts than obsessive spins. Constellations, [#script:http://pitchfork.com/media/backend/js/tiny_mce/themes/advanced/langs/en.js]|||||| however, is the sort of record you'd like to call home-- fitting since, after albums themed with water and land, it's their attempt to describe the cosmos with sound. The band's most concise record to date, Constellations never overreaches or demands attention. Its rich textures push it past the point of background music, and its gorgeous melodies serve as anchors for even the sparest moments. Opener ""To the Order of Night"" does both, setting a gentle piano theme adrift in a wide, reverb-warped atmosphere. Space and silence are paramount throughout. ""Bowsprit"" might have the biggest build here, but it depends as much on rests as it does on note. An acoustic guitar introduces the tune, stopping and starting frequently. The violin that glides in and out is as interesting when it exits as when it enters. Nowhere is Balmorhea's newfound temperance more surprising and exciting than ""On the Weight of Night"", a track whose title suggests a crescendo worthy of Texas brethren Explosions in the Sky. Balmorhea expand their toolkit here with slowly walking electric bass, winding organ sustains, and a drum kit that ambles and teeters. Sonically, the track suggests Sigur Rós' ""Untitled 7"", a 13-minute epic from (). Sigur Rós used these same sounds as a launching pad, leaping into loudness and drama; Balmorhea may have headed in the same direction two years ago, rushing to a climax that's already been mastered. Here, they control the impulse, using the low, lingering tones and a deliberate drum pattern to test the limits of the ceiling, not punch their way through it. They sustain the feeling through closer ""Palestrina"", an ingenuous epilogue that uses bowed cymbals, long violin tones, and sweeping, resonant guitar chords to translate what Christian Fennesz does with a computer to a full band. For Balmorhea, a group that's carefully restrained and edited itself here despite every trend that demands otherwise, it's a perfectly human closing gesture.","Austin instrumental ensemble demands patience and attention on this, their best record to date.

In the Dark,The Whigs,by: Jonathan Garrett,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a8265e6ef95969321143/1:1/w_160/c38159ac.jpg,2010-03-04 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13894-in-the-dark/,ATO,"Referring to any band as a ""great college rock band"" might strike some as a backhanded compliment, as it often implies more enthusiasm than technical accomplishment. In 2004, the Whigs weren't short of either. At the time, Parker Gispert, Hank Sullivant, and Julian Dorio were enrolled at University of Georgia in Athens, the same town that spawned the quintessential college rock band, R.E.M. Like Athens' most famous sons, the unsigned Whigs separated themselves from their peers early on, courting an audience well beyond the campus gates. Their headlining shows in Atlanta were almost always packed-- and not just with weekenders from fraternity row. Watching the Whigs in those early days, it was easy to understand the appeal. The band's jangly, Southern brand of indie rock was never especially novel, but their rare combination of power and raw, naïve energy ensured that their sets were always pushed to the brink without ever spilling over. In the Dark, the band's third full-length album, arrives in record store six years after those electrifying local shows, though it sounds several lifetimes removed. There is good reason for the difference as the Whigs are, in fact, no longer the same band. Founding member and co-songwriter Hank Sullivant parted ways with the Whigs following their first ATO effort, Mission Control. (He joined MGMT and was subsequently replaced with Tim Deaux.) It's hard to say for sure how much his loss influenced the direction of Dark or whether this album was always part of their plan. Either way, it's a dreary, dispiriting development. Dark is technically flawless but wholly sterile, like a Whigs album as conceived and executed by Hollywood session musicians on an especially short leash. The band claims their arena tour with Kings of Leon strongly influenced Dark, and it's hard to argue on the evidence. The songs are uniformly brawny, loud, and cheaply anthemic without much variation, let alone personality. ""Someone's Daughter"", with its plodding jackhammer drums, could even pass for a distant cousin to ""Crawl"", with Gispert creepily wailing, ""How could I forget that she is someone's daughter?"" The Whigs have also abandoned the breezy Southern charms that characterized their early music for the geographically non-specific, leaving only vague, empty signifiers-- a hint of drawl here (""I Am For Real""), a fleeting twang there (the opening bar to ""Kill Me Carolyne""). Because of this generic approach, the Whigs' rare attempts to inject some character sound even more incongruous, such as the pealing feedback that crashes the title track's bloodless alt-rock. While the songs certainly do the Whigs no favors, the production and mixing on Dark are downright unconscionable, making one long for the relative restraint of Don Gilmore or Andy Wallace. Gispert's weathered rasp was always the Whigs' distinctive trait; throughout Dark, however, his voice is so muffled and smoothed that it barely registers. And while no one would dispute that Julian Dorio is a superb and technically gifted drummer, Dark seems designed to convince an army of imaginary skeptics, with each snare hit ratcheted up to a comically absurd level. Dark is processed to the point of pasteurization, a record that conjures images of mixing desks and vocal booths as opposed to beer-soaked stages. They may no longer be amateurs, but with Dark, the Whigs prove that professionalism has its own perils.","The Athens rockers' third album, produced by Ben Allen, finds them a long way from their scrappy beginnings.

A Sufi and a Killer,Gonjasufi,by: Nate Patrin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a87113d197565213965d/1:1/w_160/ac5ca830.jpg,2010-03-04 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13968-a-sufi-and-a-killer/,Warp,"The best description of Gonjasufi's voice may have come from Flying Lotus, who gave the new Warp artist a high-profile appearance on Los Angeles deep cut ""Testament"". FlyLo called it ""timeless, incredible filth,"" which reads more laudatory than descriptive, but there's something about that voice that escapes simple specifics. On ""Testament"", Gonajsufi lost himself in the track's wispy, ghostlike soul, but on earlier self-pressed records like Dead Midget on Stilts (Crutches) and Flamingo Gimpp (released under the name Sumach), his voice had a gruff, restless quality. His singing can sound raw, maybe a bit off, but his ability to pull off a frail falsetto and ragged rasp in equal measures gives him a serious depth of range. In pairing with L.A. producer Gaslamp Killer, Gonjasufi has found a powerful outlet for his otherworldly strain of singing. Together they've created A Sufi and a Killer, one of the most fascinating slabs of hallucinogenic head-nod music to arise from Southern California's post-hip-hop vanguard. Unlike the digital bleeps and squelches of SoCal contemporaries FlyLo and Nosaj Thing, however, Gaslamp Killer and Gonjasufi draw from their hip-hop background to create an LP that could as easily fit on the Stones Throw roster as well as it does IDM-centric Warp. The beats knock, but for every moment of b-boy-friendly atmosphere, there's another moment-- or a simultaneous one-- that makes like 21st century acid rock. Gonjasufi's vocals are both haunting and haunted, coolly assertive yet frequently fixated on mortal matters, and they bleed vividly through Gaslamp's corroded analog wall of zero-fi psychedelic noise. The results are stark: Brooding, bad-trip laments (""Kobwebz""), a doo-wop number punctuated by spacey twang (""Duet""), a warping of the blues (""Ageing""). Even the more straightforward stuff has a grimy quality to it, particularly the heavy soul of ""Change"", the bar-jazz tension of ""Advice"", and the woozy ""Kowboys & Indians"" with its Eastern vocals looped against a rust-covered revision of club rap beats circa 2003. A couple of previously issued tracks helmed by other L.A. producers sneak into Gaslamp Killer's showcase as well: Warp 2010 comp selection ""Ancestors"" maintains the psychedelic mood with a sitar-driven Flying Lotus boom-clap, while both sides of last year's Mainframe-produced ""Holidays""/""Candylane"" single contribute mini-Casio chirpiness and roller-rink funk. Even with the additional producers and the stylistic elasticity, it all coheres nicely. And if the production on A Sufi and a Killer proves anything, it's that Gonjasufi can stitch himself into the beat whether it's a heavy banger or a quiet ballad. ""Sheep"" is the most notable example of the latter, as well as a testament to both the singer and the producer's ability to salvage a potentially corny concept: The lyrics are a vague and contradictory metaphor about wanting to be a sheep instead of a lion, but Gonjasufi sells it expertly with a fragile, subtly harmonic multi-tracked voice. And in the more impassioned moments-- ""She Gone"", ""DedNd"", ""Stardustin""-- his off-kilter wail pushes an already surreal junkshop-rock aesthetic into a kinship with Safe as Milk-era Captain Beefheart. There are plenty of times where the mix renders the exact words elusive and indistinct, and a track or two where you might wish they'd stay that way, but the meaning comes clear enough. And what the words don't hold, that incredible, filthy timbre does.","Working with producers including Flying Lotus and Gaslamp Killer, vocalist Gonjasufi has created a fascinating slab of hallucinogenic head-nod music.

Back to Light,Bomb the Bass,by: Joshua Klein,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a880b1335d7bf16992ca/1:1/w_160/95a4a552.jpg,2010-03-03 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13981-back-to-light/,!K7,"For much of the 1980s and early 90s, Tim Simenon-- both under his own name and as Bomb the Bass-- worked his way up the UK producer food chain, through his work with Neneh Cherry and later producing Depeche Mode's Ultra. The troubled and trying DM album work apparently took so much out of Simenon that he spent several of the ensuing years recovering. In fact, Bomb the Bass went largely quiet after 1995's On-U Sound clash Clear, with no new album released until 2008's Future Chaos. After a 13-year gap between previous Bomb the Bass records, the announcement of Back to Light was a slight surprise. The new record refines the Bomb the Bass relaunch with the addition of Gui Boratto as co-producer. On paper, this is just what Simenon needed. Bomb the Bass have rarely been about exploring the outer edges of dance music, and indeed the mundane Future Chaos boasted only the barest of nods to then-contemporary trends. Boratto, on the other hand, one of the stars of the Kompakt stable, is a savvy pick to bring Simenon up to date. Boratto's addition seems to have inspired Simenon to loosen up. The blueprint of the record remains familiar to anyone who's heard Bomb the Bass, but the tempos have been slightly upped, the beats aren't quite all weighed down by a shared dour gravity, and the songs given an almost dreamy nuance. Yet the album still mostly mines the same analog gloom of Future Chaos, which in turn recalled Simenon's decade-old work with Depeche Mode. Indeed, DM's Martin Gore even pops up on the instrumental album closer ""Milakia"", adding keyboards to a track Simenon concedes had been sitting around unfinished for over ten years. That the song fits right in really says it all about the Bomb the Bass disc as a whole-- solid and mostly serviceable. Simenon and Boratto keep the dynamics so even and consistent that very little jumps out. There are glimmers of Boratto's playful light-touch gifts simmering beneath the surface of songs such as ""Up the Mountain"" (featuring singer Sarah O'Shura of Portland's the Battle of Land and Sea), ""Blindspot"", or ""Burn Less Brighter"" (the latter two of which feature Gore-y BtB regular Paul Conboy, as do two other tracks), but they're largely subsumed by Simenon's moodiness. There's nothing wrong with being down, and Simenon does it well. But what Back to Light boasts in studio acumen it lacks in personality. One even suspects Kelley Polar and Richard Davis were also tapped as guest vocalists because their sensibilities were already so in line with what Simenon wanted to achieve and not because they had anything particularly unique or original to offer. From a pioneer like Simenon, the decision to tread water is puzzling, since he remains capable of so much more. After all, not many producers have as strong a grasp of songs as they do sounds, and Simenon has always been one of those few. Hopefully his renewed activity continues apace, and next time his instincts and collaborators encourage him to risk the unfamiliar rather than settle for safety and comfort.","UK producer Tim Simenon continues his comeback as Bomb the Bass, here roping in Gui Boratto as co-producer.

"Elevator Music, Vol. 1 / Sub:stance",Various Artists,by: Mike Powell,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a8769d034d5c69bf3a4f/1:1/w_160/ac1fd244.jpg,2010-03-03 06:00:03,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13971-elevator-music-vol-1-substance/,Fabric,"""I hope dubstep continues to be hard to pin down, disobeys its manifesto, gets called stupid names, gatecrashes other scenes, and spikes the punch, elopes, and has lots of children""-- one of about 10 eminently quotable things said by the producer Untold to the dance-music site Resident Advisor this past October. The same month, he released Gonna Work Out Fine, an aggressive set of music that crystallized a lot of what I'd been hearing in singles coming out of dubstep and what you could call the post-dubstep diaspora: an incorporation of house-music rhythms, a more acidic sound palette, and some upbeat misanthropy in an otherwise superserious genre. Listening to his singles is like hearing dubstep getting a wedgie. Untold is one of two producers featured on both Sub:stance and Elevator Music, two new compilations that serve as mini-anthropologies of dubstep in 2010-- who's making it and what it's sounding like. Elevator Music is a set of unmixed, exclusive tracks released on Fabric Recordings, a label linked to the London club of the same name (a former cold storage building; #2 on DJmag.com's Top 100 Clubs of 2009). Sub:stance is named for a dubstep-themed night at Berlin's Berghain (a former power station; #1), led by producer and Hotflush Recordings founder Paul Rose, aka Scuba. Elevator Music is brighter; Sub:stance is deeper and more atmospheric. What sounds better to you probably depends somewhat on temperament. If you don't think house music is chintzy shit for drunk clubbers, EM might be more appealing to you-- I certainly have more fun listening to it. If you like dubstep's mannered beauty and stiff upper lip, try Sub:stance. Even EM's most downtempo track (Om Unit's ""Encoded"") has a sizzling, up-front feel that Sub:stance's liveliest track (Joy Orbison's ""Hyph Mngo"") doesn't. There's certainly some overlap-- Martyn's ""Friedrichstrasse"" (from EV) could work on Sub:stance, and Ramadanman's ""Tempest"" (from Sub:stance) could work on EV: both tracks blur more lines than they draw. I'll admit that I'm not sensitive to mixing when I'm listening to a disc like Sub:stance-- I hear it more as a set of songs than a demonstration of his DJ prowess. Still, that doesn't bring Sub:stance down at all-- it's a listenable and succinct lead-in to a lot of what's happening in dubstep, and I'd definitely recommend it to people who get freaked out and angry at the mere mention of dance-music subgenres. Elevator Music isn't perfect either-- it's a scattered record that does more to undercut a definition of dubstep than to help define it. But when I hear what guys like Untold are doing-- ""No-One Likes a Smart Arse"" for Sub:stance and the standout ""Bad Girls"" for EM-- I start to feel like that's part of the point: to set its weird little bastards running across the dancefloor, just to see what happens.","A pair of compilations-- one from Fabric, one from Scuba's Berlin club-- that serve as mini-anthropologies of dubstep in 2010.

Going Places,Yellow Swans,by: Marc Masters,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a86c13d1975652139650/1:1/w_160/edddf9d1.jpg,2010-03-03 06:00:02,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13963-going-places/,Type,"When a band breaks up, it's tempting to hear their final record through the filter of hindsight-- to imagine they subconsciously knew their future was finite and planted hints in the music. But what if they actually did know? That was the case for the noise/drone duo Yellow Swans, who made most of Going Places after deciding to disband in 2008. So if you hear a sense of finality, reflection, or even fate in this album, that impression has some basis in fact. It's even there in the title. The thing is, Yellow Swans' music-- dense drones that build like narratives-- has always conveyed these kinds of concepts and feelings. What makes Going Places so great is how it transforms them from explainable ideas into things that can't be easily captured in words. When ""Opt Out"" rises from underwater tones into thick howls, you can feel anger and catharsis, but there's something else there, too. The long tones of ""Sovereign"" are clearly wistful, but that's just the tip of the track's layers. Maybe Pete Swanson and Gabriel Saloman's awareness of their pending demise added those extra levels, but it feels like Going Places would sound this good no matter what the time or circumstances. The closest analogue to the album's effect might be cinema, where pictures and sound create an experience more like dreaming than just watching and listening. Going Places is music that plays like a movie. The duo relies more on field recordings and tape loops than before, and it gives a picturesque quality to their abstract sounds. Every moment is tactile and visual, like paint strokes that are just color on their own but together create a meaningful image. The resulting pictures are also wide and expansive, like a slow Stanley Kubrick pan or a meditative Terrence Malick nature shot. Think of it as noise in Imax. Whether or not these cinematic pieces tell stories is probably up to the listener. But, as with the album title, Yellow Swans leave clues in the song names. On the hyper-busy ""Limited Space"", it sounds as if they're trying to let out every sound they can make before time runs out. ""New Life""'s beatific tones convey the optimism of rebirth, almost like noise-based therapy. And the title track feels distinctly like a takeoff, its whirring drones conjuring images of an airplane's wheels rolling, engines revving, and wings tilting toward the sky. You might not hear those exact tales in these pieces, and that's one of the album's strengths. It gives you space to discover tons of themes and ideas without limiting you to specific ones. Still, this is no blank canvas, but more like a series of Rorschach tests where the shapes are in constant motion. The emphasis there is on constant-- this may be the last we'll hear of Yellow Swans, but Going Places doesn't sound like an end, or a beginning, or anything else tethered to the anchor of time.","Famed noise/drone duo issue their final record, which transforms a sense of finality and reflection into often incredible instrumental passages.

Permalight,Rogue Wave,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a81dc0084474cd0c0d64/1:1/w_160/37687833.jpg,2010-03-03 06:00:01,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13887-permalight/,Brushfire,"Do you know what it's like to have a slipped disc in your neck? I do, and if it weren't for the spinal tap and blood patch procedures that followed, it would probably be the most painful experience in my life. Rogue Wave singer/guitarist Zach Rogue suffered two slipped discs in his neck, essentially rendering him paralyzed for a span of months. When his condition improved and the songwriting muse began to call again, like many who've been laid up for a significant time, it seems like he just wanted his life back: Rogue made Permalight, the most active, physical, and fun album the Oakland band has ever released. Rogue Wave have two solid albums to their name (Out of the Shadow, Descended Like Vultures), but both used distorted guitars for texture more than visceral force, and had no dance-related influence unless you count playing in waltz time. Unfortunately, and perhaps predictably, their new drive can be awkward. Even more unfortunately, it's most notable on what should be their catchiest songs. ""Good Morning (The Future)"" seems to think the future is IDM + fey indie songwriting à la the Postal Service. (Hey, it worked for Owl City.) Both ""Good Morning"" and the title track are hooky, but both come off like pep talks when they hope to seem like ecstatic roars. The chintzy vocal effects aim tobe inspired production touches; instead, they feel hastily tacked on, almost arbitrary. Otherwise, Rogue Wave succeed in making their most aggressive album. That's all relative, granted, as hinted at by cautiously aggressive titles like ""We Will Make a Song Destroy"", ""Per Anger"", and ""Solitary Gun"". But due to curiously anemic and trebly production, the guitars comes across thin and brittle-- a band bringing knives to a gunfight. ""Per Anger"" fares best because its jangle doesn't stray far from Rogue Wave's area of expertise, and ""Solitary Gun"" has a sturdy melody. Elsewhere, ""Right With You"" and ""We Will Make a Song Destroy"" try the Pixies' whisper/scream dichotomy but end up somewhere between R.E.M.'s Green (if we're being generous) and Better Than Ezra's angsty Friction, Baby phase (if we're being realistic). Rogue Wave are tough to root against, considering they've experienced a run of terrible luck that could have them drinking the Wrens under the table: their ""Lake Michigan"" used in ill-fated Zune commercials, a split from Sub Pop records despite an astonishing track record with TV music coordinators (four songs on ""The O.C."" alone!), Pat Spurgeon's debilitating kidney problems, and the departure and, later, shocking death of bassist Evan Farrell. You can't blame them for not dwelling on any of that, but now that Rogue's back in good health, here's hoping his band soon does the same.","After a run of bad luck and tragedy, Rogue Wave reconvene for their second post-Sub Pop album.

The Creatures in the Garden of Lady Walton / Veil Waltz EP,Clogs,by: David Raposa,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a889ea9e61561daa5842/1:1/w_160/e0c78302.jpg,2010-03-03 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13989-the-creatures-in-the-garden-of-lady-walton-veil-waltz-ep/,Brassland,"When Clogs released the Veil Waltz EP in late January-- one new song, with some incidental music and a few unreleased odds and ends-- you'd be forgiven for thinking the post-rock band's forthcoming LP would again be a mostly instrumental mix of modern classical, rock, and jazz. But like their new approach to cover art-- once muted and minimal; here a spectrum of vivid color-- the National's Bryce Dessner and co. have crafted a new version of Clogs that revels in pushing boundaries and redefining their sound. Veil Waltz does offer one clue: New song ""On the Edge"", which stands out thanks to a vocal turn by My Brightest Diamond's Shara Worden. Effortlessly soaring and trilling above mandola, oboe, and vibraphone, here she's nearly unrecognizable, and the track serves as a striking departure from what both Worden and Clogs are best known for. The rest of that EP finds leader Padma Newsome, Dessner, percussionist Thomast Kozumplik, and bassoonist Rachael Elliot collecting songs they contributed to two film soundtracks-- Turn the River, a low-budget drama directed by Whit Stillman regular Chris Eigeman, and Colony, a documentary about bees. The music on this EP-- from the xylophone lullaby ""Turn 13"" to the mumbled rustic gypsy-folk on ""Parallel Man""-- is lovely, even if some songs cover well-worn orchestral post-rock ground. Even keeping ""On the Edge"" in mind, however, won't prepare you for The Creatures in the Garden of Lady Walton opener ""Cocodrillo"", an a cappella performance by co-vocalists Worden and Newsome. ""These are the creatures in Lady Walton's garden,"" they intone, round-robin style, while also singing the Italian names of various animals (""cocodrillo,"" ""rana,"" ""pappagallo"") in a seemingly onomatopoetic fashion. Composed-- like every song here-- by Newsome, it's a marvel of composition and production, the way the song stacks their voices as each ""animal"" enters the fray, the cacophony mimicking the sounds of a vibrant jungle. Then, just as skillfully, these voices are removed one at a time, returning the song to its starting point. It's a perfect litmus test for potential Lady Walton listeners, regardless of one's familiarity with Clogs' previous works: By its conclusion, you'll either think this is the most pretentious nonsense in the world, or you'll be taken by its romantic grandeur. Even if the conceit rubs you wrong, Lady Walton contains the most accomplished and varied music Clogs have recorded to date. ""Cocodrillo"" is right at home beside a Baroque waltz like ""The Owl of Love"", and Newsome's Nick-Drake-like vocal turn on ""Red Seas"" can comfortably share space with ""Last Song"", which feature the National's Matt Berninger on vocals. Despite the exposure that Sufjan Stevens' appearance on Lady Walton has gotten, fans coming strictly for his contributions might feel slighted, as his input is limited to some singing and banjo strumming on the album's elegiac closing track, ""We Were Here"". Those coming for a Shara Worden fix, on the other hand, will not be left wanting. It's fitting that promo pics of the band include Worden, as she's on over half the tracks on Lady Walton, and whether she's making a grand gesture on ""The Owl of Love"" or simply lending her voice to the firmament as on ""Raise the Flag"", her contributions are an indelible part of what makes this album work. Some might take issue with her grandiose vocalizing, or perhaps with the words Newsome has her singing. Newsome's lyrics, however, are endemic of the passion that informs and emboldens Lady Walton. It's the same passion that National fans see during the band's live shows, as Newsome careens about the stage, furiously bowing his viola as if he means to saw the thing in half. It's a willingness to look the fool while doing what you love most, to follow your muse wherever it leads and trust its guidance.","The National's Bryce Dessner's post-rockers return, now focusing on songcraft.

After they had kids. Most of those records were self-released-- cut by Fred from the same lathe the Kingsmen's ""Louie, Louie"" was once famously carved. But in 2006, Dead Moon finally broke up after nearly two decades of grinding. The Coles were nearing 60; Fred was wearing hearing aids; Drummer Andrew Loomis felt it was time to stop. Naturally, they hung out for a few months before forming a new band: Pierced Arrows, with new drummer Kelly Halliburton, the son of a former bandmate of Fred's. As Toody Cole told Seattle Weekly in August 2007: ""Mom and Dad aren't ready to mellow out just yet. And they haven't. Not much, anyway. While Descending Shadows (their second full-length and first for Vice) is leaner and mellower than anything they've done, it still barrels forth with the same haggard, long-fanged intent that made Dead Moon so great. Here they mix in more country and blues licks, though where Pierced Arrows' garage rock truly deviates is in Fred and Toody's increased attention to melody. While fronting Dead Moon, Fred spent a lot of time filling his lyric sheets with nightmarish images of graveyards, impending doom, and (get this) moons. Pop elements were never far away, but riffs burrowed straight to your gut. Opener ""This Is the Day"" and the claustrophobic ""Buried Alive"" stick to that formula, as the ramble of ""Tripped Out"" and ""This Time Around"" sound stately. And in ""Ain't Life Strange"", we feel a fresh force. Over a flickering guitar, the Coles combine on vocal duties, sounding perfectly in-step and totally in love. It's a slow jam and there are few traces of fuzz pedal, but it still has the mark of songwriting that can knock you down if you're not ready for it. Not long thereafter they up the volume again for ""Paranoia"", six mangy minutes of guitar noise slung around one simple, sly bass figure. Within its first 60 seconds, the cracks in Fred's voice are more on display than usual. While the two of them have never sounded polished behind a microphone, he sounds especially out of breath. But it's fitting: The Coles' music has always been direct and gloriously raw; they were, after all, pressing lo-fi long before the current wave of fuzz-loving bands. Which is a slightly defensive way of saying that this music has never gone down smooth on tape. Be it in the growl of ""On Our Way"" or the belted/traded choruses of closer ""Coming Down to Earth"", the rough edges can't obfuscate how passionately every note's delivered. That can't be an easy thing to capture off-stage. Somehow the Coles did.","Veteran PacNW garage rockers Fred and Toody Cole, formerly of Dead Moon, record their second LP (and first for Vice).

Coconut,Archie Bronson Outfit,by: Amy Granzin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a885b1335d7bf16992d6/1:1/w_160/70c7689a.jpg,2010-03-02 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13985-coconut/,Domino,"Archie Bronson Outfit's last album, Derdang Derdang, had a winning way with a tired genre, divesting psychedelic garage rock of all but its essentials: swaggering grooves, stabbing riffs, and gouging pop hooks. Aesthetic differences aside, songs like ""Dart for My Sweetheart"" and ""Cherry Lips"" were almost Spoon-like in their economy. And while ABO singer/guitarist Sam Windett's voice isn't conventionally pretty, he conveyed a rare emotional intensity, even danger. Derdang's timing, however, was unfortunate. Ahead of any garage rock revival, the 2006 LP dovetailed with the rise and UK chart triumph of Arctic Monkeys. No surprise then that, four years later, the bearded trio's copping a different sound-- one that includes synthesizers, dance beats, and Tim Goldsworthy's production work. Lame bandwagon-jumping? Actually, no. Former DFA-co-honcho Goldsworthy didn't stamp his dance-punk signature on every one of Coconut’s tracks, but the ones he did are uniformly ace. On first single ""Shark's Teeth"", ABO's buzzsawing guitars and punk instincts are preserved, but leavened with Hercules & Love Affair-style disco nostalgia. ""Hoola""'s another peak, its cooing female backups flirting with Windett's strangulated yelp in a swirl of beats and hooks. Two psychedelic rave-ups on the record's first half, ""Magnetic Warrior"" and ""Wild Strawberries"", offer both delirious drone and expert popcraft. But Coconut stumbles midway through with ""You Have a Right to a Mountain Life/One Up on Yourself"". A title like that's a tip-off, and the song is indeed a malodorous heap of bellowing reverb, guitar noodling, and dire lyrics like ""Eat your heart out/ It's yours to eat."" ""Mountain"" is only four minutes long, but feels like 40. However, it may be preferable to the several cuts that follow. With little of their predecessors' electro-pop sparkle or psychedelic fireworks, but plodding rhythms and vanilla-flavored melodies to spare, tracks like ""Bite It & Believe It"" and ""Hunt You Down"" kill any momentum the album had generated. In fact, the whole second half of Coconut would be a wash if it weren't for finale ""Run Gospel Singer"", in which Windett assumes a favorite role as maiden-tempting-Mephistopheles. ""You're a gospel singer and I am a seller of songs"" he wheezes over swishy tambourines and Arp Cleveland's headlonged kick drums. The track's rough and rushed, but also sexy and spontaneous, leaving you wishing the album offered more like it. So, yes, Coconut seems to be a ""transition album"": A sometimes-exhilarating, sometimes-WTF layover between a possibly played-out formula and exciting new sounds on the horizon.","Marking a transition between their garage rock roots and a new DFA-esque friendly sound, the UK band deliver a record of two very different sides.

Close Calls With Brick Walls / Mother of Mankind,Andrew W.K.,by: Tom Breihan,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a8659d034d5c69bf3a26/1:1/w_160/cf1de477.jpg,2010-03-02 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13957-close-calls-with-brick-wall-mother-of-mankind/,Steev Mike,"Is he joking? That was what people kept asking about Andrew W.K. around the time he emerged. Chant-along pop-metal anthems about partying mixed with earnest self-help talk about living every moment to the fullest? In 2001? Given that W.K. had some serious noise-rock/art-dude pedigree (drumming for To Live and Shave in L.A., for one), the whole thing seemed like it had to be some titanic art-school prank. But then came I Get Wet, the first album that carried the A.W.K. name, and every song sounded like introductory single ""Party Hard"". I Get Wet is a work of impeccable production and serious craftsmanship, every chorus and key-change in its exact right place. If it was part of a joke, it was dizzily well-rendered. After that, the few years of frenzied live shows dispelled any doubts. A.W.K. would straight-up tell security to let kids surge onstage, and it's not really possible to maintain ironic distance from the bottom of a pigpile of sweaty bellowing teenagers. So Andrew W.K. isn't a joke, never was. If anything, he's like Stephen Colbert: A character played to such perfection, for so long, that the guy playing it couldn't help but merge it with his actual self on some level. Close Calls With Brick Walls is the moment the character started to break down, where W.K.'s noise-art tendencies finally came bubbling to the surface. On the 2006 LP, W.K. followed two straight platters of revved-up stomp-and-shout with something weirder, an album that mixed his old full-speed-all-the-time persona with blurts of Frank Zappa/Mike Patton squelch-and-growl, as well as a few totally incomprehensible sound experiments. The slow, epic, triumphant opening track ""I Came for You"" was exactly the sort of thing that would've led perfectly into another roaring banger. Instead, track two is ""Close Calls With Bal Harbour"", a 1:20 dark ambient burble, with A.W.K. intoning sinister nothings over a throbbing synth. ""Dr. Dumont"" is a minute of placid, eerie piano and nothing else. The entire lyrical content of ""Golden Eyed Dog"" is as follows: ""The small golden eyed dog with the body shaped like a cat."" But amid all these WTF experiments, we can hear plenty of the old A.W.K. in the form of surging, unstoppable hookfests like ""One Brother"", the vaguely girl-group-esque ""Don't Call Me Andy"", and ""You Will Remember Tonight""-- the latter of which is one of the purest and best songs A.W.K. has ever written. I spent a lot of time in 2006 listening to Close Calls without coming any closer to understanding what the hell was going on with the record. Back then, the album only saw release in Japan and Korea, possibly because of a bitter legal dispute with a former manager, and interested parties like me ended up making do with downloads. (There was also a short-lived vinyl release on Providence noise label Load, thus making Close Calls probably the hookiest album in Load history.) Now, the album is finally getting an American release, packaged along with the unreleased-material collection Mother of Mankind, and it makes at least a tiny bit more sense. Throughout Close Calls, W.K.'s basic message never varies from what it was on his two major-label albums: Live every second as if you were about to keel over and die. ""Not Going to Bed"" is literally about not going to bed: ""Are you gonna go to sleep on the table? I'm not! Are you gonna fall asleep watching cable? I'm not!"" The rest of the album, despite its stylistic left turns, basically follows suit: Big anthems about being yourself and having fun. The Wolf, W.K.'s second album, had repeated all the same tricks as I Get Wet, to slightly diminished results. So maybe Close Calls was an attempt to musically expand in as many directions as possible, Philip Glass minimalism and Motörhead biker-boogie as well as the Zappa stuff. It's not entirely successful, partly because W.K. didn't have the same gigantic, expensive production at his disposal. (The totally disposable Mother of Mankind seems to back this up. Comprised almost entirely of budget-ass attempted party anthems, it's not the kind of thing anyone needs to hear more than twice.) But the great moments on Close Calls, ""You Will Remember Tonight"" in particular, remain undiminished four years later. And when you've got four or five ridiculously great songs on one album, the ill-advised noise experiment bits suddenly become a whole lot more tolerable.","The once Far East-only-- frequently awesome; sometimes experimental-- Close Calls LP is finally released in the U.S., along with a bonus record.

Rat a Tat Tat,Jason Collett,by: Joshua Love,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a8369d034d5c69bf39b3/1:1/w_160/8913c6aa.jpg,2010-03-02 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13911-rat-a-tat-tat/,Arts & Crafts,"Indie-folk may typically foreground words and voices, but that doesn't mean all lyric sheets and vocal cords are created equal. For every hauntingly poetic Sam Beam (Iron & Wine) or piercingly larynx-blessed Jonathan Meiburg (Shearwater), there are a million and one singers a little too in love with their pens and pipes. Jason Collett isn't going to blow you away with his imagery, and his voice-- while sturdy and appealing-- doesn't stand out from the alt-troubadour pack. What Collett does know, however, is craftsmanship. While so many insurgent folkies treat sonics and structure as afterthoughts, Collett suffuses his music with a level of playfulness and variety that's reflective of his membership in the acclaimed indie-rock collective Broken Social Scene. In a seeming demonstration of What Not to Do, Collett's fourth solo album, Rat a Tat Tat, is actually bookended by two songs that showcase the worst tendencies of indie-folk. On opener ""Rave on Sad Songs"" Collett lays on his maverick country pretensions syrupy-thick, affecting a John Prine/Terry Allen sneer to sing some ridiculously stylized stuff about tears falling in stereo and how ""happiness is for amateurs."" Closer ""Vanderpool Vanderpool"" is even worse, as Collett appears hellbent on cramming every noun Bob Dylan's ever uttered (hustlers, madames, levees, and Jerusalem all make an appearance, among many others) into a single track. Unsurprisingly, both songs feature accordion. In between those self-indulgent missteps, however, Collett delivers a solid album that moves with confidence between breezy pop-rock and more pensive, artier endeavors. The reverbed, reggae-tinged ""Lake Superior"" and cheekily shuffling ""Love Is a Dirty Word"" posit Collett as Mellencamp 2.0, an earnest roots-rocker with a firm hold on rhythm. Meanwhile, ""Love Is a Chain"" yields a playful organ-and-handclaps-driven stomp as well as some genuinely engaging lyrics about a hot-and-cold relationship (""We fight and then we fuck and then we fight all over again/ It never ends""). At the subtler end of the spectrum, Collett proves he can wring something ear-catching even out of quiet material, ornamenting ""Cold Blue Halo"" and ""Winnipeg Winds"" with delicate layers of studio effects and offering up ""Bitch City"" as the kind of hangdog burnout shamble that would fit perfectly midway through a BSS album. The modesty of Collett's ambitions is evident in the way he doesn't seem to mind being stuck beneath some of rock's more omnipresent influences (as the Beatlesque trifles ""High Summer"" and ""The Slowest Dance"" attest). Still, he deserves loads of credit, particularly considering his folk milieu, for almost always putting the song in front of the self.","Broken Social Scenester displays a welcome command of songcraft in an indie-folk field that too often is all about vocals and words.

Ladies and Gentlemen We are Floating in Space [Collector's Editon],Spiritualized,by: Grayson Currin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a883b1335d7bf16992d3/1:1/w_160/61dd7c25.jpg,2010-03-02 06:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13984-ladies-and-gentlemen-we-are-floating-in-space-collectors-editon/,ATP,"""There's a hole in my arm where all the money goes,"" moans Jason Pierce at the start of ""Cop Shoot Cop..."", the 17-minute closer of Spiritualized's third album and lone masterpiece, Ladies and Gentlemen We are Floating in Space. His bedraggled voice drips through the words. He's an addict, but it's as if he realizes none of it mattered, anyway-- there's no salvation, no redemption, only cold life and sudden death. One cop lives to kill another cop. (Or a junkie survives only long enough to shoot up again.) The world keeps turning. Just like in his opening line, he quotes John Prine: ""Jesus Christ died for nothing, I suppose."" Since the 1997 release of Ladies and Gentlemen, Spiritualized have recorded three LPs, a handful of singles and EPs, and two double-disc sets called Complete Works. And the noise-gospel rock sprees that followed Ladies and Gentlemen cemented Spiritualized's reputation as one of rock'n'roll's best live spectacles. Pierce has also scored a Harmony Korine film, recorded a solo electronics album, collaborated with Spring Heel Jack, and sculpted a mesmerizing long-form drone record with pianist Matthew Shipp. He also almost died, in 2005 of bilateral pneumonia, only to recover and finish a remarkable return to form-- Songs in A&E. Yet Pierce unequivocally reached the height of his recorded powers with Ladies and Gentlemen. Bolder than the term Britpop might suggest, more focused than the term psychedelic might imply, Ladies and Gentlemen is one of the great triumphs of the 70-plus-minute CD era. Alternately chaotic and meticulous, thundering and quivering, Ladies and Gentlemen finds power in conflict-- between restraint and excess, addiction and isolation, and ultimately, love and hate. Like most any critical and commercial success, the record has now been repackaged with extra content-- specifically, in an ornate limited run meant for collectors and zealots. Ladies and Gentlemen's treatment as an edition of 1,000 numbered box sets from ATP is outrageous and elegant enough to match its contents: Each song comes on an individual black three-inch CD, the discs sealed inside black blister packaging, like the single tablets of a treatment regimen. Two discs of demos and isolated elements from the finished tunes-- those lonesome, blue horns blaring through ""No God Only Religion"", for instance-- get their own package, too, as does a personalized prescription signed by the doctor Jason Pierce himself. The liner notes take the form of lengthy instructions and technical specs for the medicine-- how the pills were made, who made them, and how they should be taken. ""What is Spiritualized used for?"" asks the silver metallic ink. ""Spiritualized is used to treat the heart and soul."" There's no better way to put it, really. Ladies and Gentlemen is, at its core, an album about wanting something you don't have until, as ""Cop Shoot Cop..."" says, it brings you to your knees. Pierce wants to fill that hole in his arm, or-- as it were-- the hole in his heart. Kate Radley plays keyboards and sings on Ladies and Gentlemen, and she begins the album with that famous telephone call: ""Ladies and gentlemen, we are floating in space,"" her voice delivering horrible news with ruinous calm. Her romance with Pierce had just ended. Four days before Spiritualized were to open for the Verve in England in 1995, she secretly married the headliner's Richard Ashcroft. ""All I want in life's a little bit of love to take the pain away,"" Pierce repeats for the album's first minute. Your heart would hurt, too. Pierce famously denies that Ladies and Gentlemen has anything to do with Radley, telling The Guardian as late as 2001 that ""People have this idea that anyone who writes music is bearing their soul."" He cited ""Broken Heart"", in which he admits that he's too busy to actually have one, as an example of playfulness. These songs were mostly written before they called it quits, he's said, and, after all, it's only rock'n'roll. But with very vivid words and visceral sounds, Ladies and Gentlemen expresses the extremes of attachment and separation. ""I just don't know what to do on my own/ All of my thoughts are with you,"" Pierce sings. But he's not just hurt-- he's also angry. His band eventually unloads a rock salvo that feels like a fistfight. The drums roil. The piano pounds. If there ever was a melody, the harmonica's choked the breath from it. By the next number, he's practically sobbing over a galactic country drift: ""Stay with me/ Smile all the time/ Don't go."" He's still addicted to something, and on ""Electricity"", he lets us know how good it felt. ""I'm playing with fire, if you know what I mean."" The rub, of course, is that we don't know what he means. We can only interpret and internalize for ourselves. Maybe it was Radley, or maybe it was the heroin he smoked and the booze he drank. Hell, maybe he was just being an entertainer. But if you don't know those feelings, the highs of love and the lows of loss, you've fared better than most. This sort of emotional ambiguity makes Ladies and Gentlemen an eternal album, as provocative then as it is now. People haven't stopped loving and losing and hurting yet, and they won't, of course. These pleasures and pains can be attached to anything. But what makes this ostentatious reissue-- the box costs £125.00, or about $190, plus postage-- so interesting right now is that it feels like a souvenir forwarded from another era. Ladies and Gentlemen is an extinct breed of album, a production so lavish that you have to think most record label executives would balk or faint at the thought of funding it in 2010. To wit, New Orleans fixture Dr. John is but a session player here, joining a cast of a dozen players, the London Community Gospel Choir, and a high-profile string quartet. (The record is also being reissued as a single disc, with new artwork, and as a 3xCD set without a lot of the pricy trappings of the more extravagant package.) That spirit is evident on the demos included here as well. On Ladies and Gentlemen, ""Cool Waves"" is a diorama built with weepy vocals, darting flute, schmaltzy strings, building concert bass drums, and a choir that's just begging for salvation. But its one-minute demo included in this set seems no more complicated than the demos Pierce made with his schoolmates in 1984, his former band Spacemen 3's first recordings. If the demo is a Polaroid, the album is Avatar. There's no way it could have been cheap. While Ladies and Gentlemen established Spiritualized as one of the supreme bands of the 90s, it was by no means an overwhelming commercial success. It earned album of the year honors from NME in 1997 and placed on year-end charts in The Village Voice, Q, and Uncut. But Ladies and Gentlemen charted only as high as No. 4 in England. In the United States, it's sold slightly more than 111,000 copies-- about 20,000 less than Merriweather Post Pavilion. To wit, Sony Music scrapped its plans for this reissue in America, meaning it's available only through ATP's mail-order service. The disc did better by the band's legacy, one assumes, than it did for any label's bottom line. After all, it's an album mostly without a clear hit single, a massive production better enjoyed as a whole than in bits and pieces. Though Spiritualized eventually released edits, remixes, or reworkings of ""I Think I'm in Love"", ""Come Together"", and ""Electricity"", those songs thrive best in the context of the album-- in their original, much more grand iterations. ""I Think I'm in Love"", for instance, flows brilliantly from ""Come Together"" and, eight minutes later, its dénouement shapes the perfect non-introduction to the casual piano of ""All of My Thoughts"". In the interim, Pierce reveals the breadth of the band's ideas and influence. The first half combines Spacemen 3's LaMonte Young-like 20th century composition (with its growling synthesizer drone), dub, soul (with its thick, stunted bass line), American blues (with its twisted harmonica howls), and folk (Pierce's subtle autoharp strums). The back half is a sassy, baritone saxophone-backed dialogue between Pierce's self-confidence and his self-doubt: ""I think that I can rock'n'roll,"" he sings. ""Probably just twisting,"" he answers. And on ""Come Together"", one of only a few Ladies and Gentlemen tunes you're likely to still hear live, Pierce fancies himself a young man that's sad and fucked (a word he manages to use five times in as many minutes here) amid references to suicide, heroin, and busted dreams. Even ""Broken Heart"", the album's ballad and most beautiful moment, clocks in close to seven minutes. It needs every one of them, too, since the song's overwhelming sadness depends entirely on its length and its ability to establish an atmosphere. This is an album of emotion and empathy, and it's hard to capture feelings with a format. That's what ranks Ladies and Gentlemen We are Floating in Space alongside the best art: Jason Pierce and a big band that included his ex-girlfriend and a whole slew of people that soon became his ex-bandmates faithfully render the cycle of loving anything-- the innocent exuberance, the bitter rejection, the episodic denial-- in 70 perfect minutes. And even if you can't afford this version of that achievement, you should have it on hand. One day, it'll come in handy. After all, ""Spiritualized is used to treat the heart and soul.""","This new deluxe, limited product is only for hardcore fans; the music, however-- both the original LP and this record's extras-- is timeless.

Specifically, the popular ideal of mix-making, i.e., the kind you make to express yourself to another person. As such, their songs tend to be kinda cutesy and obsessed with love and relationships. The world is one in which people are constantly falling in and out of love, and even when their lyrics stray into cynicism and self-deprecation, it's obvious they are true believers in old-school romance. Most of their songs come across like a young person putting up a jaded front to defend their wounded, open heart. It's very sweet stuff, but usually just shy of cloying. Their technique is mature and refined, yet loose and free-wheeling. More than anything, they're wholesome. That could be a damning term for some listeners, but if you're the type of person who does not reflexively recoil at reading the word ""cuddle,"" you're probably going to find something to like in their music. Rebecca Taylor and Charles Watson co-write their songs, and in most cases, sing the songs together. Their voices complement each other nicely but are distinct in tone and personality. Most often, Taylor and Watson sing in unison, and generally avoid making it seem as though they are singing to one another. Whereas many male-female vocal pairings have a communicative quality and/or an apparent subtext of sexual tension, Slow Club have a more neutral dynamic. It's not sexless, but there's seldom an implication that Watson and Taylor are pining for each other. The major exception is the nearly-saccharine opening track ""When I Go"", which has them making a series of pacts to get married if they're both still alone at various ages. Perhaps putting that song at the top of the running order is in some way meant to have us question their relationship in the subsequent songs. Though Watson has a pleasant tenor voice, Taylor is generally a better singer, and the songs come alive when her more expressive voice is highlighted in the arrangement, as when she takes the lead on the chorus of ""Giving Up on Love"" or the during climax of the jangly travelogue ""Trophy Room"". She gets a few spotlight songs, and the best of them is in an unlisted song on the same track as the finale ""Our Most Brilliant Friends"". It's the simplest, saddest song on the album, gently building up to their most heartbreaking lyric: ""You say 'baby' a lot in your songs/ It takes all my courage not to sing along."" It's a fragile moment, but it's not oversold or delivered with an ironic grin. It's almost unbearably earnest, actually, but sometimes that is precisely what you need. Slow Club nail these precious, vulnerable feelings without getting mawkish or melodramatic. Everything, from their cheery optimism to their crestfallen lovesickness is life-sized and lived-in, resulting in a crop of tiny, good-natured tunes that invite the intense identification of young romantics.","Sheffield boy-girl duo nail precious, vulnerable feelings over the course of their sweet (but not twee or saccharine) indie pop debut.

That's less a joke at the expense of Wu odds-and-sods collections than a legit point of clarification: This is literally a sequel of sorts to the deceptively similar Mathematics Presents: Wu-Tang and Friends Unreleased collection from 2007. But even if there is a tacit acknowledge that the Wu market is defined by insatiable demand, such collections should come equipped with a purpose-- either as a primer for novices (like 2008's Wu: The Story of the Wu-Tang Clan), or full of obscurities for Wu fans. We'd say Return of Wu and Friends fails spectacularly on both counts, but it's a shame to waste the term ""spectacular"" on such a mundanely depressing, blatant cash-in. (Though, let's get real, this probably won't make a dime for anyone.) If you're in a forgiving mood, perhaps you can enjoy Return as a kind of song-spotting game, since most of this is recycled material from the numbingly forgettable post-The W, pre-8 Diagrams Wu dead zone. At the time, only Wu members with some variation of the word ""Killer"" in their name made music worth a shit. Yet this doesn't even pull tracks from the good Masta Killa album-- ""It's What It Is"" and ""Iron God Chamber"" might've been the strongest cuts from Made in Brooklyn and have the liveliest and cleanest production within context, but it's hardly the sound of anyone pushing themselves. Elsewhere, it's mostly Mathematics getting high on his own supply: ""Rush"", ""John 3:16"" (a preview of Method Man's sorta-revival on 4:21... The Day After), and Inspectah Deck showcase ""Real Nillas"" can be found on 2005's The Problem. Some tracks are on even greater Multiplicity shit: ""Strawberries and Cream"" also showed up on The Problem, but Ghostface's verse is taken verbatim from Bulletproof Wallets' ""Strawberry""-- though trading Trife Da God for Deck and RZA is an upgrade. You're promised ""exclusive"" new tracks, yet in order for there to be ""Clap 2010"", an original ""Clap"" had to exist. And you know it does, if you happened to let The W run after ""Jah World"" ended. Only back then, it didn't sound like it was playing inside a duffle bag, and it kept the kung-fu fighting effects to a minimum. ""Steppin' 2 Me"" is actually GZA's ""Breaker Breaker"" remix given a boom-bap beat dull even by latter-day GZA album standards and ""Early Grave"" picks off an ODB verse from 4:21's ""Dirty Mef""-- give yourself a hand if you managed to spot the raw material and decide for yourself if it's something you're either proud or ashamed of. Goddamn, even the title is false advertising, considering the display of vitality from Only Built 4 Cuban Linx... Pt. II just months prior. They didn't return to do anything here other than overlook the application of dubbed-cassette production values and haphazard sequencing to what were B-level Wu-Tang raps in the first place. Used to be that everything you were trying to forget about the Clan during the mid-2000s-- the disinterested rhyming, the anonymous and outsourced beatmaking, the complete lack of inspiration or organization-- was a little something called Iron Flag. Consider this a suitable replacement.","The sequel to the Wu family record nobody wanted in the first place explores the post-The W, pre-8 Diagrams Wu dead zone.

Snakes for the Divine,High on Fire,by: Tom Breihan,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a86fc0084474cd0c0e16/1:1/w_160/4770e65c.jpg,2010-03-01 06:00:02,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13966-snakes-for-the-divine/,E1,"High on Fire make burly music; that's the only thing you can really call it. The Oakland power trio's thundering roar isn't dumb; there's a clear technical virtuosity on display in Matt Pike's squiddling solos, and the songs move confidently through multiple riffs and movements without ever relying on time-tested verse-chorus-verse formatting or compromising their brutality. But there is something elemental about their assault. While peers like Mastodon construct overthought concept albums, High on Fire do one thing, and they do it very well. They pummel. Matt Pike growls out his badass nonsense lyrics like a more gnarled Lemmy, if that's even possible, and rips out one gut-busting riff and shattering solo after another. His rhythm section does their best to imitate an elephant stampede. Their basic format might vary a bit over the course of an album; they're not averse to floridly acoustic intros or eastern-tinged psych moments. But their fundamental mission won't ever change. They make tough, fast, snarly stoner metal. It's just what they do. Snakes for the Divine is the band's fifth album. For this one, they've decamped from the venerable metal indie Relapse to the way-less-venerable indie E1. On their previous two efforts, the band worked with legendary scuzz-rock producers (Steve Albini on 2005's Blessed Black Wings, Jack Endino on 2007's Death Is This Communion). On this one, they switch things up a bit, working with Greg Fidelman, who produced Slayer's 2009 comeback album, World Painted Blood, and worked on a whole mess of recent Rick Rubin projects. Fidelman's not as natural a fit for High on Fire as Albini or Endino, and the very, very slight sheen he brings to the proceedings doesn't do them any favors. The drums don't wallop quite as hard, and Pike's guitar doesn't sound quite as much like the sound of a swamp demon bellowing. But Fidelman's smart enough to keep his tweaks from interfering much, and the band's apocalyptic fury sounds undiminished even after the last masterful two albums. And High on Fire aren't in any danger of losing their punch. They've gone through a few bassists now, but over the years they've developed the sort of telepathic alchemy that defines a great power trio. When one of their eight-minute tracks pauses for a split second, your heart leaps because you just know they're about to rip into yet another totally flattening new riff. Their songs don't really bother much with earthly concerns. ""Ghost Neck"", which I think is about some sort of junkie, contains the following unparseable line: ""Overdosing on the mutual garbage/ Skeleton in the end unfolds"". If I had to guess, I'd say the awesomely named ""Frost Hammer"" was about some sort of invasion of winter gods, but the song's highlight comes when Pike just screams the title four times. High on Fire are the sort of band who put devils or skulls or snake-demon ladies on their album covers just because those things are awesome, not because they illustrate any larger cultural point. And five albums in, they're very, very good at generating awesome on demand. A couple of songs here, ""Bastard Samurai"" and ""How Dark We Pray"", do awesome better than the rest by slowing down the band's galloping tempo and letting their riffs breathe. Pike already did slow to perfection in his previous band, doom-metal legends Sleep, and these two songs don't sound much like Sleep. They pull all the same tricks as the fastest HOF ragers; they just pull them slower. ""Bastard Samurai"" locks into a brontosaurus stomp, letting Pike actually sing on the verses, building up to a climactic roar instead of just hitting with that roar straight in. (And when he does finally roar, the lyric is this: ""Son of a bitch will bleed a whiiiiiiile!"" It's so badass.) On ""How Dark We Pray"", bassist Jeff Matz gets enough room to add some melodic flourishes instead of just crunch, and the song builds up a serious head of steam over its eight minutes. But even though those two tracks may be highlights, the album really has no weak moments. Like the other HOF full-lengths before it, Snakes for the Divine shows that metal, in its most basic and elemental forms, still has plenty of visceral thrill left in it-- as long as it's done right. And High on Fire do it right.","Five albums in and another awesome, absolutely pummeling record of tough, fast stoner metal from Matt Pike and co.

Nitetime Rainbows EP,A Sunny Day in Glasgow,by: Matthew Solarski,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a86b9d034d5c69bf3a35/1:1/w_160/ff308e1a.jpg,2010-03-01 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13962-nitetime-rainbows-ep/,Mis Ojos Discos,"Broadly speaking, there are two kinds of EPs: 1) Those, whether intended or not, that function as a unique short-form listening experience, and 2) Those that serve more as a clearinghouse for leftover material, covers, remixes, scattered ideas, and the like. That second type tend to be stopgaps and rewards for committed fans, and as such they tend to be the more forgettable of the two. (Though Grizzly Bear's Friend was a recent notable success.) Still, we can forgive a band like A Sunny Day in Glasgow for offering up something of a patchwork EP with Nitetime Rainbows. After all, this is a group that managed to cram no fewer than 22 tracks onto last year's winning hour-plus opus, Ashes Grammar, so it stands to reason that there would be plenty more from where that came from. What's more, the Philly outfit seems to be experiencing something of a recent renaissance. After playing lineup musical chairs for a few years, a band has finally coalesced around ASDIG mastermind Ben Daniels, and it makes sense that the new crew is eager to get more representative material out there. Hence the Nitetime Rainbows EP, home to three new compositions, alongside the title track (lifted from Ashes but newly mixed) and three remixes of said tune. As if the times needed another sign, it's vinyl and digital only. Ashes Grammar was the rare record that actually benefitted from its sprawl, and the act of teasing ecstatic moments out of that sprawl is a key delight of the Ashes listening experience. Nitetime foregrounds one of the finer moments, a series of particularly evocative synthetic tones that form the intro of ""Nitetime Rainbows"". Hidden amidst the LP, these sounds have a transformative, palette-cleansing effect, but even divorced from that context they still make for a marvelously effective mood-setter. Otherworldly and nocturnal, that mood is less second-hand signifiers and more of a piece with the stuff that makes dream-pop and shoegaze so alluring in the first place. As if to suggest there's more than one way to assemble the Ashes Grammar puzzle, ASDIG roll ""Nitetime"" right into ""Daytime Rainbows"", and a renewed esprit de corps immediately becomes evident. The syrup-thick toms and initial volley of ""do-do-do""s would have us think we're due for a jangle-pop throwback rave-up in the style of Vivian Girls or the Pains of Being Pure of Heart, but before long a guitar goes de-tuned, the vocals get smeared, and we're right back to business as usual. Even so, to date it's their most pure pop moment. ""So Bloody, So Tight"" is pretty clean and patient by ASDIG standards, while ""Piano Lessons"" turns Daniels' late-night attempt to relearn the titular instrument into a spirited ride along a motorik groove. It would have made a perfect closing track were it not for... The remixes, which is where, in true clearinghouse fashion, things start to taper off and feel tacked-on. Athens, Georgia's the Buddy System come up trumps here with their take on ""Rainbows"", which shimmers things up and chops the vocals into a delirious rhythmic component. It's rote but enjoyable all the same. Kranky recording artist Benoît Pioulard sands the smooth edges of ""Nitetime"" with glaciers of static, very much in the manner of Fennesz or Tim Hecker. On the other end of the spectrum, there's Anticipate label boss Ezekiel Honig, whose significantly more subtle reworking deconstructs the original track into a few chief elements: a drone here, a guitar loop there, a lone handclap somewhere in between. If anything, though, it serves only to prove that it's the collusion of these elements that makes the original such a golden egg. Ashes Grammar, mind you, wasn't without its dull moments-- they were just tucked away at appropriate intervals across a majestic sonic vista. Here those moments cloud together, and the view gets a little obscured.","Ambitious Philly band follow their hour-plus opus Ashes Grammar with a second example of what their new-look band sounds like.

"Tomorrow, in a Year",The KnifePlanningtorockMt. Sims,by: Jayson Greene,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a87813d197565213966d/1:1/w_160/d539aac1.jpg,2010-03-01 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13974-tomorrow-in-a-year/,Mute,"Prominent electro group releases berserk and impenetrable avant-garde opera; blank stares ensue. Sadly, this will probably wind up being the epitaph for Tomorrow, in a Year. No matter which angle you approach it from, the Knife's latest project-- a 90-plus-minute longform work about the life of Charles Darwin-- can seem bewildering. However self-consciously arty and macabre the Knife have been in the past, they've always seemed like a pop group at heart. Here nothing even remotely approaching a steady beat shows up for more than half its length. Whether Knife fans will hang on through the album's formless, screeching opening, or whether opera aficionados will simply regard this as the dabbling of pop-music dilettantes, is hard to say. What does seem certain is, like many difficult, unclassifiable albums before it, Tomorrow, in a Year is fated to be discussed more than actually heard. Part of Tomorrow, In a Year's dilemma is that it comes contextualized as an opera. For most listeners, opera has vague, mostly derogatory connotations: old, imposing, foreign, dead, faintly ridiculous. And once you invoke opera, the Knife aren't just trying to match their fans' expectations after Silent Shout; they're implicitly demanding to be measured by the same yardstick used to size up, say, Wagner's Ring Cycle. While the designation is, in some senses, accurate-- Tomorrow has a libretto and an operatic mezzo-soprano, and the whole thing was performed in September 2009 by the Danish performance group Hotel Pro Forma, which commissioned it-- the tag is probably more off-putting than useful for listeners already struggling to locate entry points into this forbidding, oftentimes-alienating work. Things don't get off to a flying start: Tomorrow, in a Year's first 10 minutes are a painstaking buildup of environmental noises-- a primordial soup of sound appropriate to a work about the origin of life. That's one way of putting it; another might be that it opens with the sounds of a drippy sink and a chain link fence buckling in heavy winds, followed by five minutes of patience-trying buzzing. Where you come down on this spectrum will probably depend on your level of investment, and, more crucially, your listening environment. Taking in the album in different settings gave me a little of both reactions. (At home, in front of massive speakers, following along with the lyrics: absorbing. On an iPod during a morning commute: maddening.) This is deeply un-portable music: It either demands your complete attention or invites you to shut it off. Once through that opening stretch, your attention will frequently be rewarded. There is powerfully evocative, richly imagined music to be found here. Olof Dreijer and Karin Dreijer-Andersson's commitment to the Darwinian conceptual framework is complete, sometimes pushing the borders of sanity: Olof Dreijer spent time in the Amazon recording and observing different species while writing, and in ""Letter to Henslow"", one of the album's most supremely batshit moments, Dreijer and his sister whoop and ululate alongside actual field recordings of Amazonian birds. Dreijer's field research also turns up in his synth tones through the album, like the chittering, insectoid buzzing at the edges of ""Variation of Birds"". Karin and Olof find all kinds of neat little ways to echo the unfolding drama as Darwin's observations move from geology and biology toward a unifying theory of all life. In ""Geology"" and ""Minerals"", mezzo-soprano Kristina Wahlin Momme delivers her lines in bursts of hurried singspiel as massive sheets of industrial noise grind and shudder beneath her, suggesting the shifting of the Earth's core. The disarmingly gorgeous ""Ebb Tide Explorer"" is a fragile collection of wisps and swells, Swedish singer/songwriter Jonathan Johansson singing in lilting two-note phrases that mimick the lazily swaying action of the seaweed he is describing. As the story moves from Darwin's theories of all life into the details of his personal life, the relentless ominousness of the music finally lifts, and the album enters its most inviting stretch. ""Annie's Box"" is a spare, plangent ode to Darwin's daughter Annie, who died when she was only 10 years old. With its yawning open spaces, haunted by a single, mournful viola drone, it recalls the icy beauty of Nico's Marble Index. That's mere prologue for the one-two climax: ""The Colouring of Pigeons"" and ""Seeds"", 20 minutes of tingly alchemy that feel like the lightning-flash realization that the entire work has been struggling toward. Anchored by a groaning cello and a rolling tribal beat, ""The Colouring of Pigeons"" unfolds in graceful layers, all in service to an aching, upward-arcing melody shared by Olof, Karin, and Momme. ""Seeds"" surges forward on a light four-on-the-floor pulse, surrounded a prismatic light show of bell sounds and a rubbery synth not far from current dubstep. At long last, it's a floor filler of sorts-- albeit one with harmonized mezzo-soprano overdubs and lyrics like, ""Transoceanic pods and capsules/ Will old occupants allow for room and sustenance?"" The uninterrupted stretch of ""Pigeons"" into ""Seeds"" is the only moment on Tomorrow, in a Year where this is recognizably the work of the Knife, and not coincidentally it's the most thrilling and vital music on the record. Reconciling their boundless ambitions with their crowd-pleasing instincts, they hit upon a sweet spot that only Laurie Anderson and few others have managed to locate-- a clearing where pop and the avant-garde meet and make each other freshly strange and inviting. Who knows what kind of reception this will receive; if it's any kind of prologue to an epiphany that allows whole albums of music as inspired as ""Pigeons"" and ""Seeds"", however, maybe we'll look back at it in five years as the moment the Knife first went next level.","The prominent electro group releases an avant-garde opera about the life of Charles Darwin that's at times impenetrable and rapturous.

Trilogi,Fredrik,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a8535e6ef959693211a9/1:1/w_160/c31ce0fe.jpg,2010-02-26 06:00:04,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13939-trilogi/,Kora,"It's easier to seem resourceful when you're working with slender means, as any glo-fi upstart could tell you. But this Swedish ensemble, centered around the LK's Fredrik and Lindefelt, is sophisticated and ingenious. Trilogi, a collection of three limited-edition EPs doubling as a sophomore LP, has a sneaky, consistent sound that's immediate and yet full of surprises. The glinting guitar and twisty vocal harmonies of opening track ""Vinterbarn"" establish the album's gusty cadence, but piano ornaments keep it from stagnating. The songs finally begin to run together in the final third or so, but it's gorgeous and clever throughout. Massed, ethereal singing dominates, half the time in wordless harmonies; the other half in winsome folk-pop verses. It's indebted to Scandinavian folk music, but might remind North American listeners of Thom Yorke, or Neil Young at his most otherworldly-- especially on the lingering ""Milo"". Fredrik rely heavily on finger-picked arpeggios, textured finely with reverb effects. Minimal electronic rhythms pulse through lean, cavernous arrangements. There are waltzes and ballads, chased with trip-hop and synth-pop. The songs come together like puzzles, the pieces scattered on the floor and gradually snapped together in way that feels both meticulous and organic. Fredrik's best songs have the haunting depth of medieval folk and the towering, evolving feel of post-rock. The sound quality is always pristine-- you can tell they slaved over each part to get it just right. Their guitars plink and ripple like thumb pianos. Mournful horns and cellos blur into eerie digital loops. A couple of songs seamlessly turn folk into Notwist-style electronic anthems: ""Holm"" does so by cranking up epic bass synths, ""Flax"" with pillowy beats and aquatic themes. It's forceful, sensuous music with a refreshing clarity of intention. And if you don't mind an emphasis on tone over hooks, it's very rewarding.","Swedish folk band collects three limited-edition EPs onto a record that has a sneaky, consistent sound that's immediate and yet full of surprises.

Maintenant,Gigi,by: Stuart Berman,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a873ea9e61561daa5810/1:1/w_160/885a422b.jpg,2010-02-26 06:00:03,Global,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13970-maintenant/,Tomlab,"For such a simple word, the title Maintenant-- French for ""now""-- is loaded with significance for Gigi. Beyond being an easy way for these Vancouver Anglophones to score some Francophone cool, it serves to contemporize an album that both deliberately evokes-- both in sound and collaborative process-- early-60s Brill Building pop-song production, and one whose recording first commenced some five years ago. On top of enumerating the album's formidable 39-person guest list, Gigi principals Nick Krgovich (of art-popsters No Kids) and Colin Stewart (producer for Black Mountain, among others) are careful to itemize each track's recording date in the liner notes-- perhaps to show their efforts coincided with, or even predated, those of soft-pop peers the Pipettes, Lucky Soul, and Camera Obscura. But then Maintenant feels more an extension of a certain Vancouver-bred pop classicism-- one that dates back to Carl Newman's pre-New Pornographers outfit Zumpano on through to the unheralded ensemble Young and Sexy-- than part of some prevailing, blog-buzzed trend. That regionalist quality manifests itself in the aforementioned supporting cast, which pulls equally from Vancouver-scene mainstays (Duffy Driediger of Ladyhawk, Veda Hille) and K Records kin from across the border (Rose Melberg of Tiger Trap/the Softies, Karl Blau, Mirah), plus frequent flyer Owen Pallett. It's essentially Krgovich's version of the 6ths' Wasps' Nest, one where he gets to upgrade his lo-fi indie-rock heroes from a Motel 6 to a penthouse at the Hilton-- but has them sleep alone. Because Gigi understand that the most important period-era sound to capture here isn't a ""Be My Baby"" kick-drum boom or a Bacharachian bossa nova swing (though both are in full effect), but rather the sound of repression-- of forcing a smile while your heart sinks, of maintaining appearances while you're dying inside. Maintenant's best songs stretch the distance between what is said and how it's expressed, like the way Sydney Vermon and Marissa Johnson's ""I'm Not Coming Out Tonight"" channels its post-breakup desperation into a heavenly orchestral ascension. Liberated from Ladyhawk's anguished grunge, Driediger proves himself a surprisingly gentle crooner on the charming boys-do-cry serenade ""The Hundredth Time""; Mirah shows she's game for a Supremes-style romp on ""Won't Someone Tell Me?""; and, in the wake of the conceptual intricacy of Heartland, it's a revelation to hear Pallett in affectingly somber piano-balladeer mode on ""I'll Quit"". However, if Gigi wanted Maintenant to truly resemble an early-60s artifact, they would've been wise to trim the 15-song tracklist to a more period-appropriate 10. For an album that's steeped in anachronistic detail-- jukeboxes, drives to ""lookout point"" and listening to ""'Mockin' Bird Hill' on the radio'""-- the references to club lighting guys and shopping malls on Joey Cook's ""One Woman Show"" feel more 1993 than 63, a quality reinforced by the fact the song sounds a lot like an early Liz Phair track. And beyond this incongruity, there are redundancies; Melberg's ""Alone at the Pier"" pales next to the similarly Spectorized ""No, My Heart Will Go On""; and in the lonesome Bacharachian ballad department, Katie Eastburn's po-faced ""The Marquee"" can't match the understated camp of Parenthetical Girls frontman Zac Pennington's ""Dreams of Romance"". Still, as a paean to the past, Maintenant sounds right in the here and now-- because for all their vintage dressing, Gigi are ultimately most interested in the bad romance that makes our present so tense.","Long-gestating LP recalls the recent soft-pop of Lucky Soul or Camera Obscura, but with guest vocalists that include Owen Pallett, Mirah, and Rose Melberg.

Magic Chairs,Efterklang,by: Grayson Currin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a874b1335d7bf16992b3/1:1/w_160/16d496c7.jpg,2010-02-26 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13972-magic-chairs/,4AD,"Even if only for a moment at a time, Efterklang have felt like the grandest pop band in the world. On each of the Danish band's first two albums, they've had flashes of melodrama, majesty, and melody capable of approaching indie's top tier-- the Arcade Fire's masterfully built crescendos, M83's epic electronic accessibility, Sufjan Stevens' pretty, piled-high themes. Efterklang splice those little shots of splendor through Magic Chairs, their third LP and first for 4AD, too. Surveying just the first three tracks, certain spells are breathtaking. On album highlight and opener ""The Modern Drift"", loose, rattling drums puncture a canvas of pointillist piano and stretched strings. On ""Alike"", distant female vocals and a squiggling trumpet chase Casper Clausen through the third verse, demanding a sing-along. And on ""I Was Playing Drums"", a bass tone becomes both the bully and the bedrock, creating perfect suspense as it pushes through flitting violins and stuttering drums with one note and pulls them back into place with the next. But the generous surroundings those moments enjoyed on Efterklang's previous LPs are largely absent on Magic Chairs. On the new album, aggressive editing aims more for pop clarity than musical intrigue. Despite the contributions of auxiliary members Heather and Peter Broderick, everything seems standard and safe. ""Harmonics"" feels like a tepid adult-contemporary take on Dirty Projectors, and ""Raincoats"" is a straight shot for the heart of college radio. The album's unabashed attempt at a hit, ""Scandinavian Love"", seems as if it hopes to pull U2 out of the stadium and into the theatre. ""Human lips, stop loving like a boy,"" sings Clausen, dragging the limpid line over an array of violins and background vocals. It's the sort of ham-fisted pop that Efterklang used to combat. Only ""The Modern Drift"", which suggests Music for 18 Musicians repurposed into hero-rock, delights with uncertainty. Slaraffenland, the excellent troupe of Danes that's often toured and collaborated with Efterklang, made a similar move on last year's We're on Your Side. Their previous record, Private Cinema, subdivided hooks with textural escapades that were innovative if not always well incorporated. We're on Your Side, though, seemed too aware of that criticism, focusing more on tightening the songs than teasing out the liberties that might have been taken with them. Magic Chairs just feels circumscribed, then, like the work of a band hoping to put the full weight of its big ensemble behind anthems bound for international audiences. Most frustratingly, the songwriting is still here: Even if ""The Soft Beating"" rises to a romantic high in the most predictable fashion, you won't soon forget the choral proclamations in the coda. And though the path ""Mirror, Mirror"" takes to its climax is familiar and safe, its weepy confessions are no less memorable. So the songs are here now, but the accompaniment was there then. Let's hope Magic Chairs is as much terminal as it is transitional, meaning that next time, they'll get all of that grandness right.","Danish band, who has often intrigued and wowed in the past, chart a more direct path, preferring pop clarity over musical intrigue.

Watergate 05,Ellen Allien,by: Andrew Gaerig,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a85e5e6ef959693211c2/1:1/w_160/d6b12e8d.jpg,2010-02-26 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13949-watergate-05/,Watergate,"Ellen Allien is a pillar of the Berlin electronic music scene. Since she dropped her Boogybytes mix and Sool in 2008, however, she's acted more as a scene curator than an artist, counting just a remix and a single as official releases and instead focusing her energy on BPitch Control's expanding roster and her own fashion label. Watergate 05, a mix for Berlin's famed Watergate club (where Allien holds a DJ residency), not only marks Allien's first full-length release since 2008, it is her latest contribution to a high-profile mix series, following both BPitch's own Boogybytes and her 2007 mix for London's Fabric club. Watergate 05 is the second mix Allien has provided from Watergate-- her 2009 podcast for Resident Advisor was recorded live at the club. Working there seems to have loosened up Allien a bit, as both Watergate and her RA mix are friendlier and jammier than previous deck work. Where Boogybytes felt tightly wound, Watergate is almost schizophrenic, featuring work from looser producers like Matias Aguayo, Luciano, and Röyksopp. Here Allien allows her selections to develop-- Watergate offers just 16 tracks during its hour runtime. This leads to few mixing revelations, placing the focus squarely on Allien's choices. After a ho-hum opening featuring some meticulous but boilerplate techno from John Tejada and DJ Yellow, Niconé & Sascha Breamer's ""Nur Ma Kurz (Philip Bader Remix)"" sets the tone: humid, busy percussion set against earworm vocal samples. It's something Allien returns to with Aguayo's vocal mix of ""Bo Jack"", Allien's own remix of Uffie's ""Pop the Glock"", and AGF/Delay's outstanding Connection (""Heartthrob Remix)"". Finishing the set with Brigitte Fontaine & Khan's ""Fine Mouche (Original Tango Paris Version)"", a wry French piano ballad, is a welcome concession, as it's probably not the type of track you can close a proper live set with. Watergate's main fault is that it's too backloaded: The Uffie and AGF/Delay tracks both appear in the final minutes, as does nsi.'s disquieting remix of Margarat Dygas' ""Hidden Form View"". The mix hinges on longtime Allien pal Apparat's remix of Röyksopp's ""This Must Be It"", which features the Knife's Karin Dreijer Andersson. The remix takes the original's glassy Euro-pop and replaces it with a roiling electro loop, massive enough that it overshadows the mix's excellent back-end. At this point it seems unlikely that Allien is going to submit a truly defining mix; she seems content to use these high-profile gigs to tweak her formula while continuing to build the Berlin scene (as always, several of Allien's friends and collaborators feature here). Watergate 05 can frustrate, but ultimately Allien's ability to differentiate her mixes while retaining her voice makes Watergate a worthwhile addition to her catalog.","Berlin techno linchpin contributes to her hometown club's mix series, featuring tracks by Röyksopp, Matias Aguayo, Luciano, AGF, and Uffie.

"Dear God, I Hate Myself",Xiu Xiu,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a84e13d1975652139609/1:1/w_160/fc5a00ec.jpg,2010-02-26 06:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13933-dear-god-i-hate-myself/,Kill Rock Stars,"Jamie Stewart has always worked with a rotating cast in Xiu Xiu, including Cory McCulloch and Deerhoof's Greg Saunier. But Stewart's strong personality made it feel like a solo project-- at least until Caralee McElroy came along. It's not immediately obvious why she would become so strongly associated with Xiu Xiu by fans, in a way prior collaborators weren't. She joined after Stewart's flagship album, Fabulous Muscles, and she didn't divert much attention from his dark charisma. Instead, she pierced through in small ways: scatters of gamelan, synthesized ruffles, cuddly lead vocals on ""Hello from Eau Claire"". She seemed a calming presence in Stewart's turbulent world. But mostly, it just seemed right that there should be two, a boy and a girl, a xiu and a xiu. One person alone in the woods is a scary story. Two is a fairy tale. Alas, McElroy has left the Xiu Xiu fold and joined Cold Cave. Dear God, I Hate Myself features collaborators both new-- Angela Seo on pianos, synths, and drum programming-- and old, like Saunier, Deerhoof's John Dieterich, and out-music drummer Ches Smith. It leans heavily on some ""crossover album"" signifiers: There's lots of steamy synth-pop and gothic chiptune; a traditional folk cover (""Cumberland Gap"") and a guest choir on ""This Too Shall Pass Away (For Freddy)"". But Xiu Xiu's music has always featured constant cosmetic modification, and fans will find themselves on familiar turf. New listeners will be immediately confronted with a couple of very catchy, horror-laced new wave anthems about fatal beatings and bulimia, and make that perennial first-Xiu-Xiu-experience decision: Do I buy this? ""If you expect me to be outrageous/ I will be extra outrageous,"" Stewart sings on ""Gray Death"", but that's a tall order for a guy who began his career with albums called Knife Play and Fag Patrol. If his obsessions with negative self-image, violence, and mental disorder have lost some of their shock value, that's okay: ""Gray Death"" doesn't need it to be an excellent song. It has an instantly appealing vocal melody and an urgent arrangement for acoustic guitar and synthesizer, not to mention one of those touching moments Stewart uses to temper his brutality: ""You were beautiful and I loved you/ My little bank robbing boy/ You were beautiful and I lost you/ Like a whip covered in pins and glue."" Now that the novelty of his volatile temperament has worn off, we can hear his sharp songwriting and fascinating sound design more clearly. The album has strong elements of pastiche. ""Hyunhye's Theme"", one of those creaky ballads Stewart does so affectingly, stands apart from all the sweaty art-pop, as do the bleary strings of ""Impossible Feeling"". This sense of ordered disturbance plays out in individual songs, too. There's a snippet of blocky rock guitar airdropped into the soft contours of ""Gray Death"", and the title track is a chest-beater that repeatedly breaks down into everything from IDM blips to hip-hop scratches. Over a rubbery pulse, ""Chocolate Makes You Happy"" seems to transform bar by bar-- flurries of computer noise, broken bells, touch-tone synths and more weave in and out of the aching vocal line. These are songs with their hair sticking up. This cultivated chaos produces complex music filled with insinuating hooks. The chiptune elements tend to be the weakest links. Stewart made four tracks primarily on music software for the Nintendo DS, which can obviously get a little chintzy-sounding. It works fine on the title track, where the bouncy glitches have powerful vocal and guitar parts to play against. But ""Apple for a Brain"", with its weaker vocal melody and more pronounced video game sounds, feels listless and bare. Xiu Xiu should never even remotely remind you of Atom and His Package. Luckily, most of the album avoids easy preciousness and focuses on Xiu Xiu's more troubled, troublesome variety. It's remarkable how much mileage he's wrung out of basically melding New Order with the Suspiria soundtrack. Every time he's about to come out with a new album, I think, ""I must be over this by now."" I never am. Even without McElroy at his side, he's still got plenty of excoriating to do, and a surplus of pressurized self to vent.","With Caralee McElroy gone, Jamie Stewart enlists new guests and experiments with 8-bit textures. It's still Xiu Xiu though: look at the title.

Landing,Githead,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a829ea9e61561daa5758/1:1/w_160/5ebb367e.jpg,2010-02-25 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13898-landing/,Swim~,"Back when Githead released their first EP in 2004, I had no sense that the band would become such a long-running concern. A collaboration between the husband-and-wife duo Colin Newman (Wire) and Malka Spigel (Minimal Compact), and Robin Rimbaud (aka Scanner), it looked like a quick one-off. But it had its own sound, albeit one reminiscent of both Wire and very early Stereolab-- driving rhythms, strong basslines, distorted and compressed guitars, and understated vocals. With a few minor adjustments, that sound is still here on album three. Githead have expanded to include former Minimal Compact drummer Max Franken, and Spigel has gradually edged past Newman to become the primary voice of the band. On Landing, she handles most of the lead vocals, and though her singing style blends into the music as another part of the texture, she's a welcome contrast to the guitars, which frequently gray out in a wash of digital distortion. A modest vocalist, Spigel doesn't get many showcase moments; the closest is ""Ride"", a nice change of pace that slows the tempo, dials back the density of the guitars, and focuses on her sung-spoken, Belgian-accented lyrics. Newman gets in his best vocal on the following song, ""Over the Limit"", which has the archetypal Githead backing track: guitars smearing across the bar lines, frantic, nimble drumming, and a staccato bass part backing a classic even-toned Newman rant. He gets more melodic on ""Before Tomorrow"", which stands out for possessing one of the few real choruses on the album. If there's anything Githead need, it's more variety in approach-- most of their material falls into two broad categories: Malka songs and Colin songs. The opening instrumental track, ""Faster"", falls into neither category. It has no melody to speak of and comes off more like a summary of the band's peculiar groove than anything else. The droning effect of the guitars-- all that static strumming-- might be more effective if they didn't sound so rounded-off and sanded down into a blur. It saps the life out of the songs, which come off more drab than they should-- when the band coasts into the end of ""Lightswimmer"", the whole thing just sounds like mud. Any [#script:http://pitchfork.com/media/backend/js/tiny_mce/themes/advanced/langs/en.js]|||||| one who's enjoyed Githead's output to this point will find things to like here, but it will take a creative jolt for them to avoid making the same album yet again.","Wire's Colin Newman and co. keep their original sound-- reminiscent of their first band and very early Stereolab-- mostly intact on album three.

Eyelid Movies,Phantogram,by: Paul Thompson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a862c0084474cd0c0dff/1:1/w_160/f97bbe16.jpg,2010-02-25 06:00:03,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13954-eyelid-movies/,Barsuk,"They couldn't have picked a better title. Eyelid Movies, the debut LP from the self-proclaimed ""street beat"" duo Phantogram, is a lush and evocative thumper indebted to the sultry side of Moby's Play. Riding a steady trip-hop inspired groove, the hushed and mostly mellow Eyelid Movies seems a fine companion piece to a long stroll or something more sedentary and meditative; point being, it sounds great in the background. But lean a little closer and you'll find plenty about Eyelid Movies to get swept up in. Behind the synth wash are shades of Portishead crackle, Dust Brothers clutter, even a little late-era Yeah Yeah Yeahs geek glamour. ""Street beat"" seems to be a nice way to gloss over the fact that this is, at its core, a trip-hop record, a genre that Massive Attack's latest seemed to suggest had moved well past its use-by date. But Eyelid Movies, although decidedly a nighttime record, doesn't lean on heavy-lidded noir or string-led psychodrama to get its grooves across. It gets messy, sweet, and a little weird; with most trip-hop, the best you could hope for would be two out of three. Try ignoring Eyelid Movies too long, and something will reach out and shake you a bit. Take, for instance, opener ""Mouthful of Diamonds"", which matches an alluringly buzzy backdrop with Sarah Barthel's breathy vocal. You could just as easily get lost in her voice or trip out on the oddly loping, slightly off-kilter synth line that underpins the whole thing. Or the ratchety thunk of ""When I'm Small"", which suggests a funky Odelay cut as sung by Martina Topley-Bird. Rife with sonic detail but not overrun by it, they'd still be fine songs without all the toppings. But Barthel and partner/producer Josh Carter find ways to dress the songs up without weighing them down. They can be emotionally affecting-- the ""should've been easier on you"" chorus of the Carter-sung ""Turn It Off"" is a heartbreaker-- and they can be just plain strange. The xx, with their slinky trickle of spy guitars and frequent collision of boy-girl vocals, are probably Phantogram's closest contemporaries, but there's a self-serious intensity in the xx that's lacking here. It's hard to imagine Romy and Oliver from the latter band pulling out the Weenish vocal of ""Running From the Cops"", and harder still to imagine them pulling it off without cracking a rare smile. Eyelid Movies runs a tad long. This many breakbeat-based numbers in a row can be numbing, and the strong currents of melody that run over the first two thirds of the LP subside a bit toward the back, giving way to atmosphere. And Carter doesn't have quite the voice Barthel has, a fact of which he seems aware. He's smart to dress his voice up in effects, and smarter still to spend so much time singing in tandem with Barthel. But the best bits of Eyelid Movies show range and attention to detail, so it's hard to care when they downshift into waves of serpentine sound. Eyelid Movies is a sumptuous, seductive record, easy to let fall into the background, sure, but easier still to fall into.","An aptly titled debut record from a duo with a penchant for lush, moody, and surprisingly affecting trip-hop.

The Magician's Private Library,Holly Miranda,by: Ryan Dombal,Features Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a86d9d034d5c69bf3a3b/1:1/w_160/ceb7a9cc.jpg,2010-02-25 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13964-the-magicians-private-library/,XL,"The average American will sleep 216,000 hours in their lifetime, give or take some tosses and turns. Of those hours, about 5%-- or 11,000 full clock turns-- are spent in a state somewhere between slumber and alert, when you're not sure where you are or what day it is or if that lingering dread is real or just a remnant of a nasty dream. Detroit-raised, Brooklyn-based 27-year-old Holly Miranda's debut album is the soundtrack to that uncertain limbo. The double-edged realm is depicted on the cover of The Magician's Private Library, which shows a young girl lying on the grass with arrows surrounding her body. ""Every time I go to sleep I kick and scream and dream a little bit/ Violently awakening to what's real is really bullshit,"" sings Miranda on the LP, her bluesy wonder of a voice bringing the alarm clock's evil chime to life. This is also music to fall asleep to-- soothing thanks in part to producer Dave Sitek of TV on the Radio, who helps to provide pillowy, languid atmospherics. But whether the resulting zzz's are peaceful is another matter. Miranda currently resides in Brooklyn, but she doesn't fit the Brooklyn mold in 2010, which is defined by noisy, lo-fi bluster on one end (Crystal Stilts, Vivian Girls) and picayune intricacy on the other (Grizzly Bear, Dirty Projectors). She's a bona-fide singer-songwriter who can and will simply sell a song around just her voice and the sound of an acoustic guitar. In this way, she's more akin to Jeff Buckley-- who gigged relentlessly with nothing more than his guitar and a vast catalogue of disparate songs before his break-- than the alternately kooky, maudlin, or devastatingly scared Cat Power, to whom she's often compared. Miranda's sense of wounded mystery and her sometimes surprising choice of covers bolsters comparisons to Buckley, who dealt with his own half-awake thoughts on Grace's ""Dream Brother"". Recently, she's reworked Lauryn Hill's ""Ex-Factor"", Buckley's own ""Lover, You Should've Come Over"", and, most surprisingly, Tool's ""Ænema"". ""It's a bullshit three ring circus side show,"" she seeths on the Tool cover, a sentiment not terribly far removed from her ""reality as bullshit"" stance on Library. Because while the album's airy arrangements and gentle flourishes make it perfect for ""very special"" moments on cheesy hospital dramas, Miranda's mature, world-weary inflections bring everything-- nightmares, hopes, loss-- to the fore. (Notably, the recording of the album was financed by publisher Chrysalis Music, who helped nab a ""Grey's Anatomy"" placement for Miranda's old band, the dutiful guitar-rock act Jealous Girlfriends.) Her crackling vocals lend themselves to murkiness and intrigue, and Library's best tracks bring those traits forward. On the twinkling ""Waves"", the singer is stoic in the face of loss: ""Where do the waves go, my love?"" she asks, while the swirling music hides a wicked, unseen undertow. And her breathy sensuality makes ""Slow Burn Treason""-- a duet with TV on the Radio's Kyp Malone-- and ""Canvas"" simmer. When she sings ""Curl yourself around my frame/ Our canvas is still one that's blank,"" she recalls Sade's effortless cool. Elsewhere, sprightly and cloying arrangements bring Miranda out from the shadows, but the exposure does her no favors on ""Sweet Dreams"" and ""Everytime I Go to Sleep"". And synthetic ""Kashmir""-like touches turn the pun-filled ""No One Just Is"" into an instant trip-hopping relic. While Miranda is gifted with Buckley's soulful earnestness, she doesn't have his range. The Magician's Private Library isn't an attention-grabbing debut in the plain sense. The best moments drift along naturally and without hassle. And there's an inherent modesty involved in Miranda's personality as a performer. All that makes her a welcoming, supremely likable figure, but it also puts her in danger of blending in with her surroundings-- whether it be a bustling cafe or a too-easy TV spot. That half-awake state that greets us each morning can be intoxicating, but eventually we have to decide whether to hit snooze or stumble into the shower.","Rising singer-songwriter explores nightmares, hopes, and loss on her debut album.

Work,Shout Out Louds,by: Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a7bc5e6ef95969321056/1:1/w_160/982af484.jpg,2010-02-25 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13805-work/,Merge,"For these Stockholm-based indie vets, Work signals an embrace of music as a calling. Or, at least, a living. When advance mp3 ""Walls"" started showing up in bit.ly links late last year, its horns and jittery piano made Merge labelmates Spoon an easy first reference. A more revealing comparison, however, may be Lou Reed and John Cale's ""Work"", which reportedly gave Shout Out Louds' third album its title. From 1990 collaboration Songs for Drella, the Reed-Cale song is a manic, edgy portrayal of Andy Warhol's blue-collar Pittsburgh work ethic that sounds best on undistracted listens. Work, by contrast-- all innocuous midtempo thrum and vague yearning-- will be pleasant enough soundtrack bait, but it suffers from the bland risk-averseness that can sustain careers while smothering creativity. Still, having a job at all is cause for celebration these days, and Shout Out Louds have tightened their belts accordingly. Work scraps the Cars synths and trashy Lower East Side glamour of 2003 debut Howl Howl Gaff Gaff, along with the orchestral lushness of 2007 follow-up Our Ill Wills, both at least co-produced by Peter Bjorn & John's Björn Yttling. In his chair is Phil Ek, who worked wonders for Built to Spill, the Shins, Fleet Foxes, and Band of Horses. Ek makes Shout Out Louds sound like rock'n'roll pros, with every drum hit or tastefully atmospheric guitar lead in its right place, especially on a decent stereo. Dude obviously knows harmony, and his best call is bringing keyboardist Bebban Stenborg's tender backing vocals more to the front. Under Ek's guidance, Shout Out Louds have also cheered up a little. Adam Olenius' high, light vocals lose some of their sensitive quaver-- just the change you'd expect when a band leaves twee-friendly Stockholm to record in Seattle with an indie-rock guy who came up in the 1990s. More broadly, Work replaces Our Ill Wills' open-wound heartbreak with wistful nostalgia. When the choruses are big and the memories relatively specific, as on Phoenix-cosmopolitan opening pair ""1999"" and ""Fall Hard"", that's a fine change. But by the bazillionth time Olenius repeats, on strummy sixth track ""Throwing Stones"", ""I'm not slowing down,"" well-- it sounds like he's trying to convince himself. Work finds these former Next Big Things railing against maturity while tacitly embracing it. The title of lulling finale ""Too Late, Too Slow"" pretty much sums the album up. Olenius may want us to ""Show Me Something New"", but those ringing chords and ignorable lyrics are commercially palatable without a hint of novelty or much personality. ""Even if I know that you're right, I'll still go on,"" Olenius retorts again and again on ""Four by Four"", as if to unseen parents suggesting he find a normal job, before repetition runs yet another solid chorus into the ground. String-flitting anthem ""Moon"", meanwhile, gives us the album's most unexpected moment-- unless you encountered any aspect of pop culture in vampire-friendly 2009: ""Have you ever tasted young blood?"" For the 21st century's ""creative class"" of young professionals, Work raises bigger questions, ones that very few-- Warhol, Reed, and Cale, I hope, among them-- have ever been able to answer successfully. Questions like: When does making a living with your art require such inoffensiveness that it's no longer art? And: At what point does getting by mean being untrue to yourself? Thankfully, Shout Out Louds aren't there yet. But they're closer than they were three years ago. ""I play the game,"" Olenius confides. ""Are you the same?"" Work, as the TV dads say, is work.","On their follow-up to 2007's Our Ill Wills, the Swedish band enlists Phil Ek to beef up and sharpen their twee-leaning sound.

American Recordings VI: Ain't No Grave,Johnny Cash,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a852c0084474cd0c0ddc/1:1/w_160/2d8b394e.jpg,2010-02-25 06:00:00,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13938-american-recordings-vi-aint-no-grave/,American,"Johnny Cash recorded most of the tracks for the fifth and sixth installments of his American Recordings series between his wife June Carter Cash's death in May 2003 and his own just four months later. He was in poor health, and the effects of Shy-Drager syndrome prevented him from working most days. But when he felt up to it, he recorded; when he felt too weak, he wished he were recording. The able-bodied A Hundred Highways, released in 2006, was the first product of all that working and wishing, and Ain't No Grave is now the second. It doesn't tell us anything we didn't already know about Cash in his final months, nor does it sound like an attempt to re-brand an icon or re-shape a legacy. Instead, it plays like a desperate means of keeping Cash alive just a little longer. As such, it may say more about producer Rick Rubin, who has guided this series for 16 years, than it does about Cash himself. Rubin comes across as deeply sentimental and fashions Ain't No Grave-- rumored to be the final installment in the series-- as a tearjerker. Listen as Cash ponders the delicate seam separating life from death on his own arrangement of ""I Corinthians 15:55"". Listen as he reminisces sweetly about life and love on Kris Kristofferson's ""For the Good Times"". Listen as he realizes he has a long past and little future on Tom Paxton's ""Can't Help But Wonder Where I'm Bound"". It can be manipulative and obvious: Just the title of ""I Don't Hurt Anymore"" looms ominously on the tracklist. Cash's weak but determined performance aside, it's meant as a beyond-the-grave pronouncement, a consolation from the afterlife. The song itself was never about heaven. It's about numbness as a salve for heartache, so in this context it feels like a great tune that cannot carry such a heavy conceptual burden. Between that and all the other tracks about mortality, Ain't No Grave has the feel of a séance-- morose and possibly even staged. And yet, we want to believe. We want Cash to go out on top, with a strong batch of songs created in the interval between hardship and grace. Even so, it's hard not to question some of the choices made in assembling and arranging these new songs. The album begins with its two clumsiest tracks: Cash's vocal is strong on the title track, weaker on Sheryl Crow's ""Redemption Day"", and here's where Rubin shows his influence over the project. He overloads both with goth-country instrumentation meant to recall ""The Man Comes Around"" and ""God's Gonna Cut You Down"", but the nail-in-coffin percussion, the eerie organ, and the blues guitar playing through an old radio all sound like clichés by now. The Old Testament ambience has lost its impact, contrasting sharply with the hands-off approach that defined the first and still best American Recordings album. When Rubin leaves the fire and brimstone behind, Ain't No Grave picks up considerably, revealing itself as a personal rather than preacherly album. Even in those final days, when his spirit was strong but his voice weak, Cash remained a charismatic and commanding singer, with an easy gravity and a friendly, grandfatherly presence. He draws out the long syllables and sustained vowels of Bob Nolan's ""Cool Water"" gracefully and even joyfully, and sounds particularly invigorated on Joe ""Red"" Hayes and Jack Rhodes' ""A Satisfied Mind"" (given the relative robustness of his voice, the track actually seems like it's from a different session altogether). And of course, it wouldn't be a final American Recordings album without a weepy send-off. No one, not even Cash, could pull off Ed McCurdy's ""Last Night I Had the Strangest Dream"" without sounding sappy, and Queen Lili'uokalani's ""Aloha Oe"" is the studiously unsentimental sentimental send-off we all knew was coming. Ain't No Grave isn't really Cash's farewell as much as it is Rubin's memorial mixtape.","The supposed final chapter in the late country star's career-capping sessions with producer Rick Rubin is released and fashioned as a tearjerker.

Introducing,Brilliant Colors,by: Rebecca Raber,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a86a5e6ef959693211e3/1:1/w_160/04b66661.jpg,2010-02-24 06:00:04,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13961-introducing/,Slumberland,"Slumberland Records has maintained a recognizable aesthetic for most of its 20 years in existence. From the earliest Velocity Girl singles to last year's Pains of Being Pure at Heart full-length, its records share an affinity for washes of reverb, bubblegum melodies, and shoestring-budget production. Even their most recent records have an aged patina to them, as if every album they were ever going to release was recorded in the late 1980s. The debut by Bay Area all-woman trio Brilliant Colors could, therefore, not have found a more appropriate home. Its 10 tracks zoom by in barely more than 20 minutes of urgent, fuzzy guitars, muffled vocals, jangly melodies, and burning, vital percussion. The band has boiled their influences down to their most essential ingredients-- a C86 jangle, shouty, atonal no-wave singing, a shoegaze saturation of echoing guitars. The LP strikes a surprising balance between faux-naïveté and knowing grit, punk toughness and twee tenderness, vintage sounds and vibrant novelty. The songs' brief run-times are Brilliant Colors' biggest strength and their most unfortunate weakness. There is a fundamental vibrancy to a track that blasts by in less than two minutes. Nothing is superfluous; everything sounds fresh and crucial. And Brilliant Colors' brevity is the source of, if not their wit, then at least their terse, maddeningly obtuse yet strangely specific lyricism. But alternately, it is difficult to develop an emotional attachment to a song that is over before you know it began. And it becomes difficult to make a distinction between many of the songs, because they are never really given a chance to blossom into memorable hooks or to rev up to distinct speeds. (One exception is ""Absolutely Anything"", a punk-sock-hop interpolation of Nena's ""99 Luftballons"".) This makes for the strange problem of mostly indistinguishable songs that, ironically, combine to form a memorable overall album-listening experience. Introducing, therefore, does exactly what its name implies: announces the arrival of a new noise-pop talent without giving too much away. It's a scrappy record that relishes contradictions, layering gentle vocal melodies over gritty industrial distortion and charging eagerly ever forward toward the next over-too-soon track. It is an alluring collection that hints at greatness but halts at achieving it, instead teasing listeners for its sequel. Introducing may not be the in-depth introduction that we might want, but it is a suitable prologue for a band that has taken that old vaudevillian advice to heart: always leave 'em wanting more.","New noise-pop band fits perfectly into the Slumberland Records aesthetic: washes of reverb, bubblegum melodies, and shoestring-budget production.

Minor Love,Adam Green,by: Zach Kelly,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a8579d034d5c69bf3a09/1:1/w_160/33e48b81.jpg,2010-02-24 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13943-minor-love/,Fat Possum,"It's the end of an era: An Adam Green record without a single dick joke or crack-cocaine reference. In fact, much of the former Moldy Peach's latest album, Minor Love, finds Green trying to obstruct the persona he's spent almost a decade fine-tuning. As occasionally funny as he was while cloaking his emotions with crudeness and junk-pop crooning, he was rarely as forthcoming as he is on his sixth solo outing. Minor Love suggests Green is interested in sometimes actually saying what he means, even if it's usually about how unavailable he actually is. ""I had to be the schmuck who tries to be smart,"" he explains on highlight ""Stadium Soul"". At least this time, he doesn't need a Wayne Newton parody about a hooker to tell us. Minor Love also finds Green in a different headspace musically as well, ignoring a long-standing predilection for cleanly expressed pop. Instead, the minimalist approach he takes with most of these songs-- with their simple constructions and complete lack of production value-- confirms an interest in a rawer feel. Part of this might also have something to do with Green retroactively slipping into the skin of the leather-jacketed SoHo rocker he might have secretly always wanted to be. Single ""What Makes Him Act So Bad"" boasts a frighteningly good Lou Reed approximation, playing like a gem of an old Velvet Underground demo. ""Stadium Soul"" and ""Give Them a Token"" both share a similar downtown-cool appeal, yet still retain a helpful bit of the sweetness and whimsy found in Green's earlier work. It's on these tracks that Green really hits his mark, now posing like those old New York City contemporaries of his did a decade ago (a time he spent famously dicking around in a Robin Hood costume). So it's a little disappointing to see him lose sight of this for the remainder of the album, filling in the gaps with paced acoustic tunes and the occasional weird one-off. There's even a handful of surprisingly appealing urban cowboy ballads, most of which would seem less out of place if there weren't as much authentic investment in their dusty-trail aesthetic. From the ominous but goofy showdown vibe of ""Buddy Bradley"" to the bizarre campfire tale ""Boss Inside"", what seems like ripe pranking ground for Green results in a few pleasant left turns, even if they ultimately don't end up sticking. Despite its strong first quarter, Minor Love fails to stick. Though there's a nice sense of humor throughout, there's just not enough meat on the bone to inspire any sort of real investment in the majority of these songs. They're simple, fuzzy, and occasionally quite hooky, but most lack any sort of magnetic element that would require a second spin. You hate to admit it, but at least the old Green had a little shock value to fall back on when things came out a little watery. And even though it's fun to watch Green turn a wacky phrase or brighten things with a peculiar image, it's pretty clear that Green still prefers hiding behind the obtuse vagary he's grown so accustomed to. ""I've been too awful to ever be thoughtful,"" he confesses on opener ""Breaking Locks"". A lot of Minor Love suggests otherwise-- I just wish he could've rolled with it.","The former Moldy Peaches member eschews dick jokes and pop ditties for Downtown cool and minimalism.

Luck in the Valley,Jack Rose,by: Marc Masters,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a85f9d034d5c69bf3a1d/1:1/w_160/b058eaad.jpg,2010-02-24 06:00:02,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13950-luck-in-the-valley/,Thrill Jockey,"In the early 2000s, while still a member of avant-drone group Pelt, Jack Rose found himself unemployed. Hunkering down at home with his acoustic guitar, he returned to the country blues he had abandoned years before when a teacher told him it wasn't worth trying if he couldn't sing. Woodshedding diligently, Rose became a masterful finger-style player, adept at bluegrass, ragtime, pre-war folk, Indian ragas, and more-- and started a solo career that would eventually make other employment unnecessary. His timing was fortuitous. The 1990s/2000s resurgence of John Fahey as an underground guitar hero inspired reams of skilled new players, including Glenn Jones, Ben Chasny, Harris Newman, James Blackshaw, and Nick Schillace. Rose became one of the de facto leaders of this loose movement, and his music seemed to grow and expand because of the company, or perhaps the competition. Each subsequent solo album revealed advances in technique and imagination, culminating in 2005's wide-ranging Kensington Blues. Rose also toured and collaborated more frequently as the decade progressed, sharing space and sounds with everyone from Mogwai to British folk legend Michael Chapman to Black Twig Pickers, a bluegrass offshoot of Pelt. That's why the shock of his sudden death last December at age 38 was so resonant, rippling through the many corners of underground music he had visited. That shock is even more palpable now that his final album, Luck in the Valley, has been released. It's a big, bold work, just the way Rose was a big, bold guy-- confident, honest, and forthright, sometimes to a fault, but always with huge heart. This forceful poise is what distinguished him from his predecessors and peers. Though his playing was often intricate and subtle, it was never hesitant, always supremely assured. And Luck in particular was intended to be big. As Rose told Foxy Digitalis in 2007, ""Kensington Blues is a really hard record to live up to. So [the next one]'s just gotta be really good."" Indeed, he outdid himself-- Luck isn't just good, it's great. And it makes the stunning silence of his absence, already as large as his burly persona, feel even larger. Luck's size comes from the diversity of its sounds and the wealth of its partnerships. Rose winds through a range of instrumentation and lineups, adding the braying fiddle of Mike Gangloff (of Pelt and Black Twig Pickers) to the hoe-down of ""Lick Mountain Ramble"", the downbeat banjo of Glenn Jones to the wistful ""Moon in the Gutter"", the ragtime piano of Hans Chew to the woozy waltz of W.C. Handy's classic ""St. Louis Blues"". But the jumps in style and context never jar, making the album less like a compendium then a suite of related themes. Many ideas and moods make up those themes, but the one that stands out most is joy. Rose injects a celebratory energy into every note, so even the most wistful moments-- my favorite is his poignant slide guitar on ""Woodpiles on the Side of the Road""-- sound excited by the mere fact of their own existence. Of course, it's easy to see the work of those no longer with us through a sentimental prism, letting emotion bleed over into the perceived profundity of the music. But Luck in the Valley is so vibrant, engaging, and alive, it's hard to overestimate it. In fact, we've been robbed of how much greater it would sound if we could look forward to Rose playing these songs live, or building on them tomorrow the way he did yesterday. But no matter what the past has taken or the future holds, this is simply great music from a great musician. That, luckily, is something that neither life nor death can change.","One of the de facto leaders of the resurgent movement of John Fahey devotees, Jack Rose recorded this triumph shortly before his recent death.

Similes,Eluvium,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a846c0084474cd0c0dc2/1:1/w_160/8d2ea3cb.jpg,2010-02-24 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13927-similes/,Temporary Residence,"You can't blame Matthew Cooper for wanting to try something different. Since 2003, he's been plugging away at an ambient style that is emotionally broad but conceptually narrow. There's only so much you can do with a palette limited to light classical instrumentation and drifting electronics, and Cooper's done most of it. An Accidental Memory in the Case of Death was a collection of Erik Satie-inspired piano pieces. When I Live By the Garden and the Sea drenched similarly plaintive melodies in radiant streams of noise. Copia, his greatest and most fully realized album, was full of hulking themes for strings and winds, while Miniatures (released under his real name) was tiny and fluttering. Life Through Bombardment, the deluxe vinyl box-set collecting his entire oeuvre up to 2009, was more than a collector's item-- it seemed to put a completed body of work to rest. Whatever his approach, Cooper always goes hard for the same matrix of emotions-- melancholy, wistfulness, yearning-- and those of us who love his music cherish this predictability. His sound has an emotional intensity that is almost unseemly, evocative of heartbreak. That hasn't changed on Similes, his first post­-Bombardment album, although the intensity is muffled to make room for delicate new elements: soft, stitchy percussion and Cooper's own laconic vocals. In a distant way, these are pop songs: Verses and choruses revolve slowly through wafting electronic sheens that glint with naturalistic piano. But his voice is so subdued and intermittent that it doesn't scan as a lead. It's just one slowly beating, spreading element among others. Cooper's singing is weary and muted, in the neighborhood of Ian Curtis or Matthew Dear. He murmurs, so you catch only snatches of what he's saying, which seems appropriate in Eluvium music, always peacefully fragmented. His voice sits still amid the ruffling synths and pin-drop drums of ""The Motion Makes Me Last""; the piano keys do the real singing. Cooper's affecting vulnerability is really pronounced on ""Weird Creatures"", where he cautiously treads the chords like slippery stones over a river. He was wise to limit the vocals to a few tracks, as they're not dynamic enough to withstand a whole album. Much of Similes is more standard, wordless Eluvium fare: the rumbling piano-based ""In Culmination"", the slow-burning ""Nightmare 5"" and ""Bending Dream"", and most of all the long, flickering closer ""Cease to Know"". Whether Similes will truly wind up being the start of a new career phase or a footnote for Eluvium remains to be seen-- Cooper sounds so tentative about his singing that it won't be shocking if he follows it with a more characteristic album of instrumentals. If he continues to strive for pop forms, he may have to figure out how to make his voice do more than color his arrangements in monotonous shades. If not, Similes will retain value as more than a curio for its sheer approachability and its unique take on Cooper's well-established style.

The Golden Archipelago,Shearwater,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a84fb1335d7bf169924f/1:1/w_160/aa6beb85.jpg,2010-02-24 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13934-the-golden-archipelago/,Matador,"Some claim albums as a format are dying out, and I keep refusing to believe it. I don't think economics or the slipperiness of mp3s will save it, so much as musicians who like the format will. It lets them say something a single track often can't, and it's hard to figure a better way to capture a snapshot of where a band is in its creative life. Based on The Golden Archipelago, Shearwater are perfectly served by the medium. The record has just a couple of tracks that would be especially striking outside of their context on the LP, and nothing on the level of the huge highs of 2008's Rook, ""Snow Leopard"" and ""Rooks"". But it's still thoroughly captivating and confident-- and one of the best recent examples of effective sequencing. The placement of every song is so precise that it almost sounds as though they were recorded in order. The listener feels an impeccable sense of balance as the album's loudest guitars follow its quietest whisper of a song during the transition from ""Hidden Lake"" to ""Corridors"". ""Castaways"" is deliberate and mannered and achieves the sort of restrained grandiosity that distinguishes Shearwater from nearly everyone else-- it carries you to a peak, and the song that follows gently carries you away from it as it bobs in on a swaying, natural beat. The album's first three songs feel almost like a suite. Hovering over all the perfect transitions is songwriter Jonathan Meiburg's loose unifying theme, islands. That seems simple enough for a concept, but it's a natural extension of Meiburg's fellowship work studying daily life in remote communities, as well as his well-documented interest in ornithology and academic work focusing on migration patterns. Indeed, the record is introduced by a field recording of what sounds like an island choir, before the band kicks in with an oceanic swell of guitar and imagery of waves on the shore. Meiburg's voice is finely honed, and it's the primary reason the band is frequently (and justifiably) compared to Talk Talk-- he has the same richness, range, and inexact enunciation that made Mark Hollis so enigmatic and interesting. He belts powerfully on the intro to ""Black Eyes"" before he's joined by a weighty beat that subtly shifts beneath him as the bass line evolves and the drums gradually change their emphasis. It's a sharp arrangement that doesn't do anything overtly odd but makes the song captivating and exciting nonetheless. The only parts of the album that don't feel quite as balanced as their surroundings are ""God Made Me"", which lacks the fluency of the record's other songs and weighs down the middle a bit, and the final two tracks: ""Uniforms"" is okay on its own, but its extreme dynamic range and slow start leaves the already wispy closer ""Missing Islands"" feeling, well, like an island, divorced from the rest of the record. Even so, it's a great piece of work, capturing a band at a moment of creative confidence and maturity. The band's organic incorporation of marimbas and other mallet percussion, its use of acoustic instruments to create textures, its sense of restraint-- these are all well on display on The Golden Archipelago. It's an album you can spend time with and understand as a whole work, and one that grows on you with each listen, revealing yet more detail and nuance.","Following career-peak Rook, Jonathan Meiburg and co. return with another excellent record of restrained grandiosity and enigmatic grace.

European,Sambassadeur,by: Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a84d13d1975652139607/1:1/w_160/8c810ee6.jpg,2010-02-23 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13932-european/,Labrador,"From freedom fries to tea parties, the American relationship with Europe over the past several years has been as complicated as continental philosophy. Or a sibling rivalry. Coming out of a global financial crisis, the Old World way-- with less conspicuous consumption and more built-in safety nets-- looks more than ever like the better way. Named after a Serge Gainsbourg song, winsome indie poppers Sambassadeur won't shake up any Sarah Palin fan's European stereotypes. But the Gothenburg, Sweden-based band's third album, European, again demonstrates the virtues of cosmpolitanism, craft, and restraint. Of all the Swedish groups in recent years, Sambassadeur have perhaps the most in common with likely indie-kid preconceptions of Swedishness-- no blog-house attitude or hip posturing here. One part ABBA, one part C86, the fragile, idyllic pop of 2005's self-titled debut translated naturally to a studio and the lusher production of Dungen's Mattias Glavå on fine 2007 follow-up Migration. The new album doubles down on an aesthetic that should appeal to fans of Camera Obscura, the Clientele, or the Concretes, resulting in Sambassadeur's most consistent full-length to date, even if its peaks don't quite match earlier highlights like ""Between the Lines"", ""Kate"", or ""Subtle Changes"", marred in part by occasionally generic lyrics. As with generations of Swedish popsters before them, Sambassadeur excel at picking up sounds from the U.S. and UK and refining them to their catchy essence. When European is at full gallop, making loneliness almost cheerful on first single ""Days"" or another album highlight, ""Sandy Dunes"", it's pretty tough to beat: Those horns! Those strings! That piano opening! Where Migrations quotes Pavement and includes a Dennis Wilson cover, Sambassadeur's latest sprinkles its lyrics with well-selected phrases from Nick Drake or James Bond movie titles (though you probably enjoy them more if you don't realize it). Plus there's a hushed, intimate rendition of Tobin Sprout's ""Small Parade"". For all that, it's hard to pinpoint moments when European rises beyond ""pleasant"" or ""comfortable"" to something transcendent. While the slower songs may drag on early listens-- hint: try speakers instead of headphones-- ""Albatross"" eventually emerges as the closest thing. ""I was happier alone/ Cut my hair just like a boy,"" sings frontwoman Anna Persson, her voice full and conversational over Astral Weeks-style upright bass. It's a moment that more than makes up for every ""ivory skyline of your smile"" or ""pine trees like paintings."" Put down your protest signs, people: There's still so much we could learn from each other.","The Gothenburg, Sweden-based indie pop band demonstrates the virtues of cosmpolitanism, craft, and restraint.

Standing on Top of Utopia,Kasper Bjørke,by: Joshua Love,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a85913d1975652139622/1:1/w_160/8d1b7d2f.jpg,2010-02-23 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13945-standing-on-top-of-utopia/,HFN,"Thanks to Röyksopp and Kleerup, we've developed expectations over the past few years about dance-and-pop-minded producers from Scandinavia. These studio auteurs may wander between genre borders, but their penchant for listenable electro-pop offset by voices (almost exclusively female) tinged with melancholy tends to help make their albums feel like organic units rather than tossed-together jumbles. Not so with Kasper Bjørke, whose vocal-aided tracks are odd and disparate and whose instrumental cuts are even more schizophrenic. Standing on Top of Utopia is Bjørke's second full-length release under his birth name, following 2007's equally haphazard In Gumbo, and it's full of tantalizing moments that never threaten to coalesce into something resembling a coherent whole. The album's first track, ""Animals"", is disconcertingly cool and minimal, nicely throbbing electro-pop that nonetheless feels out of place as an opener. ""Young Again"" is equally disquieting thanks to vocalist and songwriter Jacob Bellens, whose brooding, loud voice contrasts oddly with the song's romantic words (Bellens appears again on ""Alcatraz"", where his deep voice comes off cheesy delivering serious lyrics). The best vocal cut by far is ""Efficient Machine"", which successfully blends post-punk steeliness with pure disco pleasure much in the same vein as LCD Soundsystem, complete with irresistibly slippery bass, handclaps, and cowbell. It's bookended by the album's two best instrumentals-- ""Dasko Vanitas"", which features muted disco guitar plucks bleeding into techno, and ""Melmac"", a woozy jam that touches on mutant disco. On the whole, however, Utopia has a haphazard feel-- it moves from piano-driven disco vamp ""Alcatraz"" to the darkly foreboding instrumental ""Great Kills"" to a cover of the forgotten Rolling Stones' gem, ""Heaven"". Bjørke closes Utopia with a pair of tracks every bit as unexpected and awkwardly fitting as the two that began it. The glitchy ""Fido & the Friendly Ghost"" nods both in title and tenor to Bjørke's minimal house side guise, Kasper Bjørke & His Friendly Ghost, while the beatless, burbling ""Fasano"" ends things on an expectant but unresolved note. Bjørke is clearly an artist-producer who likes to put his finger in lots of different pies, and he should be commended for such restlessness and flexibility. Still, it would be nice to see him pursue some of these avenues a bit more thoroughly as opposed to cramming so many detours into one 48-minute trip.","Scandinavian producer trades in vocal-aided tracks that are odd and disparate and instrumental cuts that are even more schizophrenic.

Fabric 50,Martyn,by: Andrew Gaerig,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a8645e6ef959693211d2/1:1/w_160/35ec963f.jpg,2010-02-23 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13956-fabric-50/,Fabric,"After several years of establishing himself as one of dubstep's up-and-coming producers, Martyn spent 2009 releasing his first LP, Great Lengths, a handful of singles and EPs, and just generally blowing up. He carries that momentum into his first commercially available DJ mix, the 50th (!) installment of London nightclub Fabric's ongoing series. A beguiling and sometimes difficult mix, Fabric 50 showcases Martyn's increasingly divergent interests, touching on all manners of UK dance subgenres. Martyn gets tossed in with the dubstep crowd, but as Philip Sherburne noted in his Great Lengths review, Martyn's productions incorporate elements of Detroit techno and house music and feature dance-friendly tempos. Fabric 50 features some of dubstep's current powerhouses, but they are mostly those whose music is already amenable to the floor: Zomby's siren-laden raves and Joy Orbison's soulful spinning. Fabric does serve as a departure for Martyn, though, as it leans heavily on the growing UK Funky movement, a branch of garage music that incorporates contemporary R&B as well as African and Caribbean rhythms. Tracks by UK Funky mainstays Altered Natives, Cooly G., and Uncle Bakongo are included. This makes Fabric 50 a challenging, idiosyncratic blend, especially for the Fabric series, which usually leans heavier on techno (sister series FabricLive is more groove oriented). It also makes for some extremely interesting juxtapositions. Martyn wastes no time on pleasantries, opening with four minutes of Hudson Mohawke and Olivier Daysoul's ""Joy Fantastic"", which comes out of the gate winking and laughing. It's a risk that Martyn continues to trade on through the first third of Fabric's 65-minute runtime, segueing into the busy, shallow percussion of Nubian Mindz's ""Bossa Boogie"" and the Soca-flavored bounce of Maddslinky's ""Lost on Tenori Street"". During one of the album's most impressive stretches, Martyn mixes Zomby's ""Little Miss Naughty"" into the humid percussion of Uncle Bakongo and then leads us into another Zomby track, the clubby headrush of ""Light Cycle"". These early minutes are both fascinating and confounding: Though the mixing is impressive, Martyn offers few footholds, instead subjecting listeners to 20 minutes of clacking percussion. He makes amends in the middle of the mix, offering Joy Orbison's ""BRKLN CLLN"", Roska's remix of his own ""These Words"", and Martyn's remix of the Detachments' guitar-led ""Circles"", the melodicism of which is almost jarring after the percussive opening sequence. The mix's final third is a blend of choices both inspired-- Actress' ""Slowjam"", Levon Vincent's ""Air Raid""-- and confusing. SpaceApe's Rorschach-ranting on a Ben Klock remix of Martyn's ""Is This Insanity?"" (SpaceApe's unsurprising answer: yes) seems like a poor fit with Fabric 50's overall tenor, while Jan Driver's hardcore-infused ""Rat Alert"" and Dorian Concept's shifted house chords on ""Trilingual Dance Sexperience"" close the mix how it began: surprisingly abrupt uptemo jamming. Fabric 50 is one of the most intriguing and risky mixes you're likely to hear this year, but it's also a harsh and tricky set. Martyn is a tremendous DJ, sliding between genres and shedding new light on his own work as he casts it amongst the set here. Fabric 50 is a slippery overview of both Martyn's developing skill and of current UK dance trends, one that requires thoughtful attention before it pays off.","Fabric's top mix series here finds the dubstep A-lister showcasing his increasingly divergent interests, touching on all manners of UK dance subgenres.

The Meat of Life,Clem Snide,by: Zach Kelly,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a8479d034d5c69bf39e3/1:1/w_160/084aac06.jpg,2010-02-23 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13928-the-meat-of-life/,429,"The Meat of Life can be considered a sort of a comeback record for Clem Snide. It's not a comeback in the sense of being a return to form or a drastic departure, but it is a promise that prolific frontman Eef Barzelay won't have to go it alone again. Hungry Bird, a shoulda-been swan song that was initially abandoned mid-record because of the band's slow dissolution, was issued a year ago with news that Clem Snide would press on. So while Meat of Life should get a little burst of energy coming from a band returning after being so near the end, it winds up being a plodding next step from a group that once got by on its smirk and quickness. Lambchop's Mark Nevers again handles production duties, and much like Hungry Bird, Meat of Life finds Clem Snide deserting wily, irreverent arrangements and witty aphorisms in favor of a more earnest and streamlined sound. Even Barzelay's voice-- once bursting with character, unafraid of the occasional pubescent crack or gargle-- now sounds subdued and polite. Hungry Bird was ostensibly about a break-up, and while this record digs into love and lust from a few different angles, it's hard not to notice that the guy sounds not only a little burned, but just plain burned-out. Even from its title, ""Wal-Mart Parking Lot"" might seem pretty over the plate, but Barzelay plays it straight: She bails, he drives all night and ends up watching the sunrise outside of a Supercenter, and he still can't manage to find any irony in the commerce of love. The band also sounds like the wind has been taken from its sails, rarely finding a way outside of the same waltzy, indie-pop ballad structures. Most of the songs have such a predominant lite-rock FM quality to them that even the occasional lilt of a lovely cello part or the blast of a trumpet (far too rare here) is unable to rise above the din. Even the when the songs do branch out, it's usually in an unbecomingly strange direction. The album bookends ""With Nothing Much to Show for It"" and ""Anita"" (the latter of which boasts an ""Anita""/ ""I need ya"" rhyme, just in case you wondering how completely uninterested Barzelay is in being clever) have a weird and lonely calypso vibe, sounding like ballads for the only guy at Sandals without a date to the Luau. Strangest of all might be the title track, a lucid bit of blacklit space folk that somehow manages to make the cosmic beauty of conception sound frighteningly repulsive: ""To grow the meat of life, I will plant my seed"". It's disappointing that Clem Snide seem to have nestled into a very comfortable, moth-eaten place, and it's sadder still when you can hear Barzelay's sense of humor worming it's way in, most notably on ""I Got High"". Dedicated to ""all you beautiful American girls and boys"", ""I Got High"" is a warm, nostalgic look at those fumbling adolescent escapes into love and drugs. It's wistful, in part because you can sense the ""old Barzelay"" returning. That tug in his voice makes me think that he misses that guy a little bit, too.","After almost breaking up during the recording of 2009's The Hungry Bird, Clem Snide are back, if not exactly re-energized.

Have One on Me,Joanna Newsom,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a869c0084474cd0c0e0c/1:1/w_160/e63def14.jpg,2010-02-23 06:00:00,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13960-have-one-on-me/,Drag City,"It was a little disturbing at first to hear that Joanna Newsom's full-length follow-up to the ambitious and polarizing Ys would be a triple album. Where 2004's The Milk-Eyed Mender was an unusual record with its share of quirks (her squeaky voice and fondness for arcane language, the harp), it also had its simple pleasures. Most of the tracks were short and the sound was spare; you pretty much liked it or you didn't based on how you felt about Newsom's sound and her ability to put a song together. Ys, on the other hand, was unapologetically dense. The five songs averaged more than 10 minutes each, and through them Newsom sang continuously; Van Dyke Parks' arrangements were similarly relentless, seeming to comment upon and embellish almost every line. It was a rewarding album-- filled with memorable turns of phrase and impressive storytelling. Many were enthralled, and almost everyone at least admired it. But in comparison to Milk-Eyed, Ys took some serious work to crack. So when I heard that Newsom would be following it with a 3xLP set called Have One on Me, I had troubling visions of 25-minute songs with lyrics that stretched to 5,000 words. As it turns out, Have One on Me is a ""triple album"" in the vinyl sense, in the same way that the Flaming Lips' Embryonic is a ""double album,"" even though it fits onto one CD. There are 18 songs here, and they total about two hours. To pick a couple of reference points from the CD era, that's the same length as Smashing Pumpkins' Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness, and just a bit longer than Biggie's Life After Death. Two hours is a lot of music, but having it broken into three discs, each the length of a 1970s LP, helps. You can dip into Have One on Me at a given point, listen for a while, and move on to something else. But while the album invites sampling, I've found myself returning to a different section each time I sit down with it. The highlights are spread out evenly, and Newsom couldn't have sequenced the record any better. While songs here evoke moments of Ys and Milk-Eyed and Newsom's harp is still the dominant musical focus, it's striking how much Have One on Me feels like its own thing. Not a progression, exactly, more of a deepening. You can feel roots going down and an edifice being built. Her voice has gained depth and she sings with more force and clarity, so that's part of it. And the arrangements are more judicious and draw less attention to themselves (some tracks are just harp, others add horns, strings, and percussion, but with a lighter touch). But the bigger difference seems to be the overall mood, which is expansive and welcoming. The best songs feel more like conversations rather than artworks to be hung on the wall and admired from several paces away. Newsom seems to sing from somewhere deep inside of them, and her earthy presence has a way of drawing you in, bringing you closer to her music than you've been before. The name you'll most hear in discussion of this record is Joni Mitchell. Part of it is that Newsom can sound a fair bit like her with her more richly textured voice. Sometimes, almost eerily so, like on ""In California"" (the way she wraps the vocal melody around the evocative title word is just a few miles up the PCH from Blue's ""California""). In addition to her voice and phrasing, the more approachable songs here, from the stirring harp-and-voice ballads ""Jackrabbits"" and ""Esme"" to the funny, weird, and hugely appealing road song ""Good Intentions Paving Company"", have bluesy chord progressions that stand in stark contrast to the rigid folk modes of Ys. These songs sway and heave with a warmth and approachability that are new for Newsom. They, and several others like them, offer a fresh way into Newsom's music for the curious. ""The phantom of love moves among us at will,"" goes a line in ""Esme"". Most of the songs here deal with love in some form, another quality that connects Have One on Me to the broader singer-songwriter tradition. Sometimes the love is romantic; other times its about friendship or family. Newsom sometimes approaches the subject from her elliptical perch, talking in pictures-- ""Each phantom-limb lost has got an angel (so confused, like the wagging bobbed-tail of a bulldog),"" is the line that follows the one above in ""Esme"". But though Newsom indulges her gift for imagery early and often, Have One on Me has moments of simplicity and directness, where the tangled phrases can be boiled down to, ""Life can be difficult and lonely and we all need love, but holding on to it can be hard."" One significant difference between Newsom and Mitchell is that the latter, especially early in her career, was writing songs that would sound good on the radio. For better or worse, Newsom is not a pop singer-- that's just not what she does. So I don't want to overstate this record's accessibility. A few tracks here, especially longer ones like the title track and ""Kingfisher"", approach the winding density that marked Ys. On these, song structure is elusive-- at any given moment you're not sure if you're listening to a verse, chorus, or bridge. The lyric sheet helps a bit, but with two hours of music to digest, you won't feel too guilty about using the skip button here and there, or digesting the record in pieces. Helpfully, returning to the most immediate songs causes their charm and appeal to bleed into the tracks that surround them-- so the album seems to grow and change as you listen. Have One on Me begins with ""Easy"", about a wish for the kind of life the title suggests, and closes with ""Does Not Suffice"", which finds the narrator packing up a house to leave after a breakup, putting away all that reminds her lover of how ""easy [she] was not."" The latter is subtitled ""In California, Refrain"", it uses a similar gospel-inflected progression as the earlier song, and it's flat-out gorgeous, heavy with sadness (""the tap of hangers swaying in the closet"") but also exhibiting quiet dignity and strength. It's my favorite song here, and it comes last, which is a dependable sign that I'll be returning to an album often. When I hear Newsom sing the word ""easy"" in ""Suffice"" and my mind jumps back to the opener, it reinforces just how many threads she's weaved between those songs and how incredible it is to discover new things with every listen.","The full-length follow-up to Ys is no less ambitious, but this 3xLP set also has some of the most inviting and accessible songs of Newsom's career.

Animalore,Via Audio,by: Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a8139d034d5c69bf395c/1:1/w_160/2465a575.jpg,2010-02-22 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13877-animalore/,Undertow,"Via Audio's band van has the word ""SNOB"" painted on its side in cartoonish block letters. The Brooklyn-based, Berklee-educated foursome surely aren't the only music lovers who self-identify that way these days-- even beyond their home borough. Based on the recent chart successes of Vampire Weekend, Grizzly Bear, and Animal Collective, a growing portion of U.S. record buyers now think a lot like critics. If widespread connoisseurship leads to more adventurousness inside and outside the mainstream, as Solange Knowles' Dirty Projectors cover or Antony Hegarty's Beyoncé cover appear to portend, then the stage could be set for some of the weirdest and most exciting pop in ages. As Animalore shows, however, the new snobbishness isn't always for the best. That's a shame, because the mature, earnestly proficient folk-pop of Via Audio's first LP, 2007's Say Something, was mild-mannered to a fault. Again produced by Spoon's Jim Eno, Animalore keeps its predecessor's smooth gloss and evident chops, demonstrating why Death Cab for Cutie's Chris Walla was an early supporter, but adds touches of funk, R&B, and cloying humor. With songwriting that veers between snoozy and face-palming, it's the kind of sophomore album that makes you question whether the debut deserved so much love in the first place. To paraphrase Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure, true expertise is knowing there's a whole lot we don't know. For instance, I don't know how much it matters that Animalore shares its name with a rare 1953 ""animalanthology"" featuring Lewis Carroll. If there's a concept here, it's subtle: ""The Lizard Song"" ably ventures into tropicalia; ""Tigers"" rides an indie pop groove but catches its tapping toe on Mother Goose-like rhymes. Animalore's charms are subtle, too, but easier to find. Spoon's Eno establishes a dubby sense of space beginning with the jazzy chords and thick bass of coolly seductive opener ""Hello"". Co-songwriter Jessica Martins' light, versatile voice should please fans of former tourmates Headlights, particularly on acoustic-to-technicolor finale ""Happening""-- the album's best song. Martins also keeps the Fleetwood Mac-dreaming ""Summer Stars"" and castanets-kissed ""Wanted"" from collapsing underneath their complex arrangements. She can't save ""Goldrush"", which sounds like a 1970s-era ""Sesame Street"" ditty about the Olympics, but its hook should be sharp enough to catch some listeners. When Via Audio engage with recent chart pop, though, they bring an ironic distance that can be... off-putting. It's hard to imagine anyone would actually ""want to make babies"" to first mp3 ""Babies"", which turns the sci-fi synths and slinky rhythms of a Timbaland production into wry parody. ""Digital"" adopts the deadpan electro of LCD Soundsystem to broach the shocking revelation that pop stars use Auto-Tune: ""It doesn't even matter how good you are,"" co-songwriter Tom Deis sneers, aghast. It's sad and embarrassing hearing complaints about ""something 12-year-olds will like"" from a band that elsewhere sings, ""Olga, the poetry of music rises like the ashes of a life before I knew you."" As long as pop is going to encourage us would-be connoisseurs, here's hoping it doesn't forget about the 12-year-olds-- or the 17-year-olds, either.","Brooklyn band retains its debut's mature, earnestly proficient folk-pop and adds touches of funk, R&B, and humor.

The Years EP,Memoryhouse,by: Jonathan Garrett,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a85ac0084474cd0c0dee/1:1/w_160/73b9d3c4.jpg,2010-02-22 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13946-the-years-ep/,Arcade Sound,"You'd be forgiven for thinking that Memoryhouse are glo-fi also-rans before even hearing a note-- the Guelph, Ontario-based duo is indeed another nostalgic bedroom project. Yet Memoryhouse are so chill on their debut EP they're practically glacial. In contrast to the kinetic early single ""Radium Girls"", the songs on The Years offer a less festive take on the past than many of their sand- and surf-loving contemporaries. The relatively somber approach works to The Years' benefit, lending it a more classic, polished feel than other sample-indebted releases. Due to their limited recording budget and ever-present drum machine, the band may technically fit the definition of lo-fi; however, Evan Abeele and Denise Nouvion's ethereal dream-pop hints at loftier ambitions. At times, The Years plays like a shoegazer record minus the feedback, leaving just the reverbed loops and frostbitten vocals behind. Opener ""Sleep Patterns"" is one such somnambulant gem-- its sputtering beat, never quite rousing, always purposely lags two steps behind. Further underscoring the heavy-lidded, dream-like state is Nouvion's eerily affectless timbre, caught somewhere between a soft coo and spoken word. The vocals may not be in tune, though they do seem appropriate in their disconnect from the melody, suggesting a kind of suspended animation. ""To the Lighthouse"", The Years' standout final track, continues the EP's lethargic and oceanic themes but adds an ever-so-slight twang to its gentle ebb. Nouvion, meanwhile, flattens her tone even further, as she dispassionately describes the sensation of drowning. It's a testament to her calm delivery that she manages to make lungs filling with water sound not only serene but downright seductive. Belying its title, The Years almost sounds cut short: four tracks in just over 12 minutes, with one song, ""The Waves"", acting as little more than an extended segue. Yet the songs fit together seamlessly, and the fact that a full-length is planned for May suggests that The Years' brevity is by design, not due to any shortage of material. Most importantly, the EP clearly sets Abeele and Nouvion apart from their more amateur peers. The Years may be awash in nostalgia, but far from inviting unfavorable comparisons, it mostly confirms that the past was indeed as good as you remember.","Chillwave newcomers take a more relatively somber approach to bedroom-produced nostalgia, lending this EP a more classic, polished feel.

Though certainly drawing from the roots music of the Southern U.S., they are equally entrenched in mead-soaked English folk, classic rock, and psychedelia. For each woolly bit of boogie, there's a supporting cast of trippy flute accents, backwards guitars, and ramshackle nods to mod rock and paisley-patterned freakouts. All of which work together to produce a number of catchy stompers on the band's first full length, Tidings. But as much as Tidings rides high on it's own brand of sweaty juke-joint appeal, its finest moments are a grab bag of genre detours. ""Black Water"", a crunchy slab of drug-rock steeped in mystic imagery (it sounds only a little bit like a Spinal Tap song), works more like a Renaissance Faire theme than a muscular blues number. ""Cotton Strands"" is a Love-styled bloomer bursting with sitars and flutes, yet it still manages to retain the feeling of a creepy backwoods séance. ""Untitled"" acts like the perfect introduction to both Nuggets and LSD, and late album cut ""Empty Heart"" boasts a strut that has T. Rex stank all over it. And there's plenty of brawniness to go around, too, like the single ""October Fires"", which is a wild, noodly groover, detailing some sort of sacrifice ritual over a sweaty honky-tonk rhythm, harmonica, and punchy guitar details. Thing is, Tidings isn't the tight rock record it appears to be. Almost half of the songs are tagged as interludes, most of which are field recordings or outtakes of aimless strumming, strange whirrings, and drunken ramblings. Frontman Jack Sharp made these recordings between 2005 and 2007 in Bedford, England, before the current iteration of Wolf People. So in a sense Tidings serves as more of an odds-and-ends collection than an album proper. Though occasionally a particularly strange piece of noise or a tasty riff will manage to prick up your ears during these sections, they seriously hamper the movement of the record. While the patchwork construction does unintentionally remind you of a live set (one that's obviously just lousy with tech problems), skipping through the dodgy one-offs and tepid noise detours will leave you with only a handful of tracks worth holding on to. Most of the proper tunes succeed because they roll along so eagerly, so it's hard to imagine why Wolf People would sap the album of all its momentum with these little speed bumps. If these experiments weren't so dull and scatterbrained, they'd at least serve as a sort of counterweight to the rockers, making the good stuff really pop. But the full-band cuts don't need a push. Ditch the interludes and you have yourself a hot, swampy EP full of terrific little boogie-minded gems.","London band mixes blues-rock with English folk and bits of glam rock, stitching together the songs with abstract interludes.

American Gong,Quasi,by: Rebecca Raber,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a856ea9e61561daa57cf/1:1/w_160/459b6115.jpg,2010-02-22 06:00:01,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13942-american-gong/,Kill Rock Stars,"For a band with such an illustrious pedigree Quasi have strangely remained a niche act: Its primary members are Heatmiser's Sam Coomes and Sleater-Kinney and the Jicks' Janet Weiss, and it released records on Touch and Go and Kill Rock Stars. Perhaps that's due to other band commitments; perhaps because Quasi rarely perform outside of the band's Portland hometown. (Though they are about to embark upon a fairly extensive tour in support of this new effort.) Or perhaps it's because Quasi's lyrical content-- from the overt politics of Hot Shit to the silly-yet-obtuse children's poems of When the Going Gets Dark-- can be too arch for some. Or maybe it's just that the band's tricky mixture of jazzy piano honky-tonk, Southern blues guitar, and rambling psychedelica is a jarring concoction that can, for some, be an acquired taste. Whatever the reason, it seems like even the band's best reviews seem to note the band is unlikely to convert new fans. Well, that is not the case with American Gong. The band's eighth album (and first with bassist Joanna Bolme) is both a summation of its career and an accessible introduction for new listeners. American Gong showcases Weiss' textured, musical fills and muscular beatkeeping and Coomes' bar-piano melodies and bent-note blues guitar riffs. But here they focus on those strengths and boil their songs down to their most essential ingredients: knotty, seasick melodies, heavy riffs, surprisingly sugary harmonies, and virtuosic drumming. Quasi have always been enamored of repetition, both lyrically and musically, but often to a monotonous effect. Here that becomes a draw. ""Laissez Les Bon Temps Roulez"", a mid-tempo rocker featuring barely more than its titular lyrics, makes Coomes' nasal, keening delivery as much a part of the song's syrupy groove as Weiss' undulating drum rolls. And the fuzzy guitar arpeggios anchoring ""Bye Bye Blackbird"" and cyclical structure and central refrain of ""Rockabilly Party"" accomplish the same thing. American Gong is also blessedly free of typical Quasi jams-- which work live, but can drag on record. There are still lurching, aggro guitar solos and hints at foundations for what will become showcases for improv on tour, but the album's arrangements are simplified and mostly serve their vital hooks. There are some surprisingly quiet moments-- from the subtle, acoustic track ""The Jig Is Up"" to the mournful opening of piano-peppered ""Everything and Nothing at All""-- that show off the band's dexterity. But with an experimenter's adventurous spirit, they eschew pure prettiness by adding a shambolic solo or acidic harmony to keep things from getting predictable. And 16 years into their career, that's a valuable thing. Here, a rewarding one, too.","Portland indie supergroup focuses on its strengths and boils its songs to their most essential ingredients on their best album in years.

Hidden,These New Puritans,by: Amy Granzin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a86013d197565213962e/1:1/w_160/aef5487c.jpg,2010-02-22 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13951-hidden/,Domino,"Bassoons, French horns, Japanese taiko drums, a children's choir, Foley samples, incantations about secret recordings, labyrinths, and knights. And that's just Hidden's first two tracks. Raise your hand if you thought These New Puritans had it in them. Just two years ago, the band from Southend-- a UK borough set where the Thames meets the North Sea-- took a stab at Gang of Four rhythms and Mark E. Smith vitriol. Their debut album, Beat Pyramid, made interesting uses of negative space and some of the record's spartan tracks turned up as killer remixes. But if anything, TNP were late to the post-punk revival party and about as likely to author a grandiose and triumphant concept album as Glasvegas. And yet Hidden is a strikingly inventive and original rock record. Granted, nothing is ever completely new in pop music, but the album freshly synthesizes older ideas (post-rock textures, no-wave skronk, Steve Reich-influenced phasing) and current trends (dubstep's delay, chart pop's stentorian synth lines, global beats). You have to listen really hard to hear any guitars. Similar to contemporaries Sigur Rós, Nico Muhly, and Joanna Newsom, These New Puritans challenge classical and popular value distinctions by fully integrating a 13-piece orchestra. A clutch of melodic motifs and variations weave through Hidden, keeping the song set extremely tight and aesthetically cohesive, so when ""Orion""'s rabid beats and gothic choir feed into orchestral palette cleanser ""Canticle"", the transition is fluid and unpretentious. That's not to say the record is particularly organic-sounding. TNP frontman/songwriter/arranger Jack Barnett has plotted this work of sonic theater to the smallest detail for the biggest bang. ""Attack Music"" pits dancehall horns against massive beats and cooing female voices against Barnett's arch sing-speak. If possible, the drums, played mainly by Barnett's brother George, are even more spectacular on M.I.A.-shoutout ""Fire-Power""-- a track which simulates the crushing of a human skull with a cracker-wrapped melon. Drums, in fact, are so central to Hidden, that Liars comparisons are unavoidable. Barnett credits Benjamin Britten's 20th century opera Peter Grimes as an influence (it was inspired by the same estuary region TNP call home), and Hidden seems to drive at some sort of human/natural world showdown. Given the fact that we're perched on the precipice of ecological Armageddon, it's probably safe to say the band has appropriately scaled their sound to their subject. But here's the thing: While Hidden's risktaking and relentless focus are easy to admire, they're harder to love. As Leonard Cohen's ""Anthem"" famously goes, ""There is a crack in everything/ That's how the light gets in."" Good luck finding Hidden's cracks. Still, the record rewards dedication: Beneath the bombast, the playful piano-driven ""Hologram"" is human, even vulnerable, and the electro-pop contribution ""White Chords"", with its Thom Yorke-channeling vocals, is unexpectedly lovely. Hidden is a statement, but not a manifesto. A band needs considerable imagination and skill, not to mention borderline delusional levels of ambition, to attempt this kind of project and hope to be successful. So we probably won't be hearing a lot about new genres ""doombeat"" or ""woodwindwave"" anytime soon. And now that they've shown what they're capable of, we can probably expect TNP to do something totally different, if not genuinely amazing, next time around.","UK post-punk revivalists tear up their own rulebook and start from scratch on this ambitious, darkly experimental second album.

Sigh No More,Mumford & Sons,by: Stephen M.

Rather, it's a play at quaint family businesses run by real people in real small towns, trades passed down through generations: both independent (yes, as in indie) and commercial. It's a shallow cry of authenticity, but this West London quartet really does sound more like a business than a band, supplying value-added products at discount prices. Their debut, Sigh No More, is stocked with group harmonies straight from the Fleet Foxes warehouse, exaggerated earnestness on consignment from the Avett Brothers, some of the same rock ""real""-ness that built the Kings of Leon brand, second-hand drama from that run on Keane a few years ago, and some insistent Gomez rusticisms gathering dust in the back room. It's not spot-the-influence if they're pushing them on you with a salesman's insistence. Mumford & Sons take an emporium approach, with an inventory that's broad but never deep. By spreading their attention around so many different trends, they aim to do many things adequately-- perhaps to distract you from an inability to do any one thing especially well. They love big moments and acoustic instruments, so you might call what they do hoedown pop, although that might be giving them too much credit: Every hoedown on Sigh No More-- every rush of instruments in rhythmic and melodic lockstep-- conveys the same sense of hollow, self-aggrandizing drama. And they pull that shit on every track. Among the predictable crescendos, there are some unexpected textures, mostly courtesy of some guy calling himself Country Winston playing banjo and dobro. And they contain hints of Celtic melodies in songs like ""Roll Away Your Stone"" and ""Thistle & Weeds"", like they might be trying to update Fairport Convention and Pentangle. But none of these ideas is fully developed or explored, the gestures fleeting at best. For music that ostensibly prizes the appearance of honesty and confession, Sigh No More sounds surprisingly anonymous, giving a sense of the band as engaged music listeners but not as real people. Mumford paints himself a sensitive guy put upon by insensitive lovers: ""Tell me now where was my fault in loving you with my whole heart,"" he whines on ""White Blank Page"", as the music swells and ebbs to exonerate him of any misdeed or misunderstanding. Worse is ""Little Lion Man"", which is already a hit in Britain but sounds overly self-absorbed in its insistent mea culpas, as if admitting wrongdoing is a noble gesture: ""I really fucked it up this time, didn't I, my dear?"" When Mumford & Sons stray from their tales of romantic martyrdom, the results are actually worse. Late in the album, ""Dust Bowl Dance"" kicks up some American Gothic ambience with what sounds like the least believable stab at a murder ballad ever set to record. ""I'll go out back and I'll get my gun,"" Mumford sings, like a man who had never handled a firearm in his life. ""I said, 'You haven't met me, I am the only son.'"" When the Sons' electric guitars finally kick in, the song descends from ill-advised to downright embarrassing. Live, it's probably their closer, but ""Dust Bowl Dance"" hints that Mumford & Sons are in the costume business. They're playing dress-up in threadbare clothes.","West London band's faux family business actually sounds like a business, one supplying value-added products at discount prices.

We Are Proud of Our Choices,Ewan Pearson,by: Jess Harvell,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a85cb1335d7bf1699274/1:1/w_160/19ab305f.jpg,2010-02-19 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13948-we-are-proud-of-our-choices/,Kompakt,"Depeche Mode, Goldfrapp, the Rapture, Tracey Thorn: Ewan Pearson has been courted by a rather mainstream client list for a guy knee-deep in the underground. For nearly a decade, Pearson has lent his considerable talents as a producer to both crossover dance-rock stars and folks who predate the rave era entirely. Perhaps these musicians, who live between pop and club life, are drawn to someone who gushes over Radiohead and St. Vincent as well as Âme and Radio Slave, someone with an up-to-the-minute knowledge of dance trends as well as an understanding of what makes trad songwriting tick. So it makes sense that Pearson's released his latest mix CD on Kompakt, a label that's spent the last 12 years turning avant dance music into a kind of pseudo-pop, and vice versa. During the first wave of microhouse, which it helped pioneer, Kompakt also released cheeky Madonna interpolations and chanteuse-techno hybrids that verged on outright tweeness. And as minimal techno's deep-underground hit a fallow patch mid-decade, Kompakt remained friendly enough to attract the attention of both Spin magazine and the Pet Shop Boys, among thousands of others. Much of Pearson's We Are Proud of Our Choices hearkens back to the label's earliest days, its micro-era clicking and snapping, while retaining at least a flicker of that now near-mythical Kompakt glow. A_Idric's ""Birds on Tree"" pairs the melancholy of Gas' string samples with scissor-sharp percussion. Wah Chu Ku's ""T Times Too"" recalls a more minimal Plaid, its cool-breeze synth gusting over stiff house drums. But Pearson's tracklist also eschews both songs and pop remixes, the two choices that still guarantee a look-in from an audience with limited time for instrumental techno. Vocals surface mostly as ghostly shudders and robotic punctuation on tracks like Hot Natured's ""Equilibrium"" and Xenia Beliayeva's downright spooky ""Analog Effekt"". Perhaps true to his nature as a regularly gigging DJ, Pearson affirms himself as a drums man here, a fan of gleaming Euro-techno snares, static-ridden electro kicks, deep house woodblocks, and beyond. Pearson manages to choreograph rhythms of all sorts-- both rigid and fluid, ugly and beautiful, straight banging and downright delicate-- into one slowly unfolding dance. Pearson's range isn't surprising; Choices is now the third mix to show off his enviably wide-eared listening habits. Perhaps that's why, if We Are Proud of Our Choices is occasionally dark, it's also never alienating or pointlessly sparse. A sensualist rather than an acetic technician, Pearson expertly juggles the astringent and the voluptuous, even when we're just talking drum sounds. None of the tracks leap out on first listen as obvious show-stoppers, but Pearson's nonetheless collected the most rhythmically diverse selection of tracks to appear on a Kompakt-branded mix in quite some time. We're lucky to have him, out there patrolling the border between hard and soft, rhythmic experiment and low-key pleasure, pop and underground.","Producer and remixer extraordinaire straddles the pop and the underground on this rhythmically diverse Kompakt mix.

Prenuptial Agreement,J. Stalin,by: David Drake,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a858b1335d7bf1699266/1:1/w_160/9012cc9e.jpg,2010-02-19 06:00:02,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13944-prenuptial-agreement/,SMC,"Jovan Smith was a child of the crack-blighted urban 1980s, born in the Cypress Village housing projects of Oakland in 1983. His family was profoundly impacted by crack's tragic presence, from his older brother's death to his mother's decades-long addiction and his own drug-related conviction. These facts aren't intended to push his ""authenticity"" or to reduce him to the product of outside influences. Stalin is, importantly, an MC whose vocals bleed the earned confidence of a man for whom insecurity is an impediment to survival. Vibrant and exploding with personality, J. Stalin is a knowing, mischievous wise-ass whose charisma hangs between unapologetic cockiness and the ability to cut through rap's fantasy-addled drug fetishism and provide sobering reality. His poignant backstory does explain how seriously Stalin takes this subject matter, particularly because his attitude could otherwise be perceived as arrogance. As a rapper, J. Stalin is not particularly concerned with wordplay, preferring directness; his verses are to the point and uncluttered. The Prenuptial Agreement's primary missteps come from poorly conceived hooks and beats (the unfortunate waste of an E-40 cameo, ""Get Off Me"", in particular). At its best, which is an impressive bulk of a 22-song running time, J. Stalin is a boisterous ""Neighborhood Star"" whose uninhibited exuberance is as effective at capturing the tragic heart of urban drug culture as he is just spitting game to the girl he met on the block. He epitomizes an all-too-rare characteristic in street rap: an ability to entertain without trivializing the significance of the tragic underpinnings that give his songs their power. Although street-oriented tracks like ""D-Boy Blues 2010"" are the most lyrically invigorating, it's the hollering-at-the-ladies anthem ""Don't Front""-- an up-tempo anthem whose crackling guitar lines give the entire track infectious electricity--  that jumps from the record on first listen. Production on the LP comes from a group of deft hands, including Mike Rimzo, the Mekanix (former Digital Underground DJ Dotrix and producer Tweed), and Traxamillion, all of whom follow a similar blueprint. These beats carry the heft of hyphy's hi-definition 808 bangers, married to a pristine musicality that the subgenre largely bypassed. These expansive, expensive textures of well-engineered, modern production are redolent of glossy, aspirational 1980s electro-R&B, Jam & Lewis' bourgeoise sophistication re-purposed as the sonic atmosphere for the children of the crack-soaked slums. This maneuver is only incidentally political, more obviously a fresh aesthetic move because it exists in such marked contrast to the cold, lo-fi bedroom production that defines much of Southern gangster rap. J. Stalin's M.O. is so effective because of a similar philosophy: He has no concessions to empty technical exercises or ""statements."" The album's peak is the dramatic tour de force ""Red & Blue Lights"", in which Stalin captures the eerie paranoia of drug sales without glorification (""I sold it out the house/ Forgive for my sins but I never got to be a child"") over searingly dark, atmospheric production that recalls Wendy Carlos' A Clockwork Orange Moogs. Alongside the hook's evocative imagery, ""Lights""' powerful resonance comes from Stalin's personality; his unwavering stoicism in the face of the long odds against the corner dealer makes for universally compelling drama. As with so much rap right now, the album gives only a partial picture of J. Stalin the artist; this is his third official solo record, but there's a plethora of mixtapes (with original material), collaborative albums (like his The Real World series with DJ Fresh), and guest verses that help paint an even fuller picture. To hear an artist establishing himself as a writer of trunk-rattling anthems you have to cop his debut; to hear him perfect them, you need his The Pre-Nup mixtape. That's the same place you'll find him willing new life into an familiar archetype. To observe his strutting charisma in action, you might check his sophomore record, Gas Nation. But track-for-track, Prenuptial Agreement is Stalin's most fully realized record, a comprehensive and rarely disappointing album that captures an artist who isn't emerging, but has arrived.","Rising Oakland rapper has a genuine ability to entertain without trivializing the significance of the tragic underpinnings that give his songs their power.

Presidence,Excepter,by: Marc Masters,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a848b1335d7bf1699241/1:1/w_160/6d07430b.jpg,2010-02-19 06:00:01,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13929-presidence/,Paw Tracks,"Through a steady stream of albums, EPs, podcasts, and even a double-album mix of podcasts, Brooklyn's Excepter have honed a sound both recognizable and tough to pin down. Not that it's particularly hard to describe, with its improvised electronic squiggles, dubby synth noise, criss-crossing drum machines, and zombified moans. But explaining their music by cataloging the sonic elements is like saying water tastes like hydrogen and oxygen. It doesn't catch the magic of Excepter's alchemy, how they move between comatose meandering and inspired epiphany so seamlessly it's hard to decide which is which. Presidence, a 130-minute 2xCD set filled with half-hour-plus pieces, doesn't really make the Excepter formula any more transparent. Nor should it-- I doubt these magicians are particularly interested in revealing their tricks. But Presidence offers clearer evidence of how the band's process doesn't depend on specific sounds or formats. Put simply, Disc One is mostly classic Excepter, and Disc Two is mostly something else. That both are equally stubborn, challenging, and interesting shows how sturdy their approach is. Currently a six-piece, Excepter continue to reorganize themselves into new shapes and sizes without losing their core identity. If you're already familiar with that identity, you might want to start your Presidence experience with Disc Two. All four pieces there explore new sounds, and each feels more repetitive than previous work, more interested in riding out one pattern or beat than morphing through several. Most striking is the title track, a 33-minute solo synth odyssey crafted by founder John Fell Ryan back in 2003 (as the press kit puts it, the band's ""pre-war"" days). Ryan's creative process usually manifests itself in his edits of Excepter source material, or in his mesmerizing vocals. But here we get a glimpse of his improvising methods away from his bandmates, and the result is practically an album unto itself. Like a meditative amalgam of spacey Krautrock, Terry Riley's ""all-night flight,"" and the synth escapades of Oneohtrix Point Never, ""Presidence"" moves from clusters of starry notes to big swaths of electronic noise and drone. Yet Ryan glides through it all with a stubborn anti-logic in line with Excepter's established M.O. The same is true for Disc Two's other experiments, as the band's weird sense of timing unites tracks as disparate as ""Anti-Noah"", an ambient piece dominted by weather-report samples, and the robotic, Residents-on-downers ""Open Well"". Disc One's sounds are more familiar, but Excepter's ways of getting in and around them are just as idiosyncratic. The first half, a somnambulant half-hour suite called ""Teleportation"", gurgles through rattling drum-machines and low-end rumbles, reaching highest when Ryan and his co-singers Lala Harrison and Clare Amory wrap their hums together. The suite never quite wakes up from its subdued dream-state, but Excepter's woozy rainbow brightens on ""Og"", mixing a loping beat, melodic synth waves, and chilled vocals into an oddly catchy New Age jam. That may sound like a bit of a niche pleasure, and ultimately Presidence stands closest in Excepter's oeuvre to 2007's Streams (the aforementioned double-disc of podcast mixes), both best suited for the converted. This is, as the band calls it, ""long distance music""-- sounds that take a while to absorb, and work better out on the horizon rather than up in your face. But while Presidence may keep its distance, it's never hard to enter, and individual pieces are as intriguing by themselves as they are in the album's wide-open context. In that sense, maybe every Excepter album should be called Streams-- the band's vision channels varied sounds and ideas into something worth wading through.","Brooklyn avant-rock collective helms a 130-minute 2xCD set: Put simply, Disc One is mostly classic Excepter, and Disc Two is mostly something else.

Black Noise,Pantha du Prince,by: Joe Colly,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a85b5e6ef959693211bb/1:1/w_160/f445d961.jpg,2010-02-19 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13947-black-noise/,Rough Trade,"Though he lacks the crossover name recognition of producers like the Field, Burial, and Lindstrøm, Germany's Hendrik Weber is one of the leading figures in modern techno. As Pantha du Prince, he has up until now released two albums of meticulous, minimal-inspired house music. The last, 2007's This Bliss, found the rare balance between ambient sweep and dancefloor bounce, and it's only grown in stature since its release. In part because of a move from the smaller Dial Records to Rough Trade and guest spots from some indie heavyweights, his new LP, Black Noise, is being met with more excitement this time around. And with good reason: Said to be born out of a period of musical exploration in the Swiss Alps, the record is both a stylistic departure for Weber and an extension of what he already does well. Weber is unlike most minimal techno producers in that he doesn't look to locate one groove and ride it for the course of a track. His songs open up, unfurl, and regularly change course. With Black Noise he develops this to incorporate a wide range of sounds-- field recordings, atonal noise, and stray percussion all populate the album. Above all, here he aims to reproduce sounds already in nature, and where This Bliss was airy and celestial, this record is gritty and earthbound. It's darker, more forceful, and more chaotic. From the first moments of opener ""Lay in a Shimmer"", it's clear that we're in for a different kind of Pantha du Prince album. The track begins with a cluster of noise-- crowd voices, clanging scrapes, the rev of a car engine-- before building into a groove of low-end synths and glistening bells. While the core arrangement is still carefully constructed and precise, the clamor around it makes the song far looser than anything Weber's done to date. Subsequent tracks also strike a balance between the natural and electronic. ""Abglanz"" combines woodblock percussion with a gritty dubstep instrumental, and ""The Splendour"" (which features !!! and LCD Soundsystem bassist Tyler Pope) sets pinball plonks loose over a muted minimal backdrop. The album moves through a few distinct phases while maintaining this earthy, psychedelic quality. In its middle section, starting with ""A Nomad's Retreat"", Weber plays with asymmetry and extreme textural contrast. He puts gravelly bass next to reverberant synths in a way that shouldn't work but does. He revisits the icy atmospheres of This Bliss toward the end of the record, rendering them grainier but equally haunting. On the gorgeous ""Welt Am Dracht"" and closer ""Es Schneit"", eerie vocals drift over taut drum programming and shredded synths flutter around like pieces of confetti. During both stretches, the songs tear and split at certain points, giving way to pockets of noise that reinforce the album's overall theme. Ironically the only track to stumble is the one that will likely attract the most new listeners. ""Stick to My Side"" is Weber's much-drooled over collaboration with Animal Collective's Noah Lennox, but oddly it doesn't come together like one would hope-- Lennox's traditionally warm vocals sound detached from Weber's chilly arrangement. That's disappointing considering the duo's combined potential, but it's not enough to derail what is otherwise an exceptional record. At 70 minutes, Black Noise is a big, dense listen but also the kind of album that rewards investment. Each track is its own micro sound world with enough rich detail to draw you back for deeper investigation. The album is undoubtedly a success for Weber-- if not an outright step forward, then a graceful lateral one-- who probably could have gotten away with not making such a comprehensive shift in sound. Instead he chose to deconstruct his signature style, and the result is strikingly unique.","German producer builds minimal techno epic from a beautifully textured sound palette. Panda Bear guests.

And they still do. But in 2003, they were briefly on major-label RCA and competing with Foo Fighters and AFI for airtime on MTV2. It's about as anachronistic as Warner in a New York Giants jersey, and about as fondly remembered. 2005's Perfect Pitch Black followed, with little else other than talk of Cave In's indefinite hiatus. When they did return last year with the Planets of Old 12"" it seemed more of an assurance that they're still around than proof of their artistic vitality. It's less of an EP, damn near single-length, and each of its four tracks is nicely compartmentalized if not terribly diverse. And now it's being released on CD, along with a live DVD of a performance last year at Boston's Great Scott. Opener ""Cayman Tongue"", by a large measure the slowest Planets track, finds Stephen Brodsky and Adam McGrath careening around a time signature damn near impossible to keep track of, yet a dominating low-end provides a visceral punch. Halfway through its six-plus minutes, they submerge into a miasma of feedback punctuated by full-band interruptions. It's initially startling, but they sort of overplay their hand-- this section of ""Cayman Tongue"" is longer than any of the tracks that follow and the ultra-modern production smooths out most of its dynamic edge. The remainder of Planets of Old plays out like a series of windsprints. The first, ""Retina Sees Rewind"", sticks a Thin Lizzy riff into an electrical socket and showcases Brodsky's nasal singing, which sounds sort of like a sedate Geddy Lee. It's the hookiest of the four, especially since double-kick-drum scream machine ""The Red Trail"" is aerodynamic to the point that hooks would be considered a luxury. The fourth and final piece of Planets of Old, ""Air Escapes"", is a compact hearkening back to Antenna's more Clear Channel-flavored stylings, loud and super-compressed but ultimately letting Brodsky's just-tuneful-enough melodics punch through. So in a span of time slightly equal to that of a latter-day Sunn O))) track, Cave In make their case for... well, it remains to be seen whether it's brand reinvigoration or a desire to shed light on a band that was probably ""hipster metal"" before anyone knew what that really meant. But Planets of Old might be too little, too late considering how narrow its range is-- the type of listener that might've made, say, Jupiter their sole metal purchase of the year has far more access to extremes either in volume or melody or texture. And while Planets of Old doesn't demand a whole lot of the listener, Cave In were considered great in large part because albums like Jupiter did.","Hipster metal O.G.s bring their 2009 comeback EP to CD, recalling both their slicker crossover sound and chop-heavy prog roots.

In 1995, German reissue label Bear Family put out a three-volume compilation series, And the Answer Is: Great Pop Answer Discs From the '50s and '60s. It shows that as engrossing as the answer record trend can be, most of the records themselves are for obsessives only. Eddie Argos is such an obsessive. The plucky raconteur for UK rockers Art Brut has always portrayed himself less as a pop star than as the ultimate fan, whether California dreaming about Axl Rose on 2004 debut Bang Bang Rock & Roll or belatedly discovering the Replacements on last year's Art Brut vs. Satan. And, as titles like ""Pump Up the Volume"", ""Nag Nag Nag Nag"", ""Twist and Shout"", and ""The Passenger"" may indicate, Art Brut were already making ""answer songs"" of a sort. Everybody Was in the French Resistance... Now! is Argos' band with Dyan Valdés of L.A. group the Blood Arm. Produced by former Mighty Lemon Drops guitarist Dave Newton and recorded at Joshua Tree (take that, U2!!! ...I guess?), Fixin' the Charts, Vol. 1, an album-length excursion into answer songs, is only the latest example of Argos' fascination with participatory culture. Too often, though, its jokes are one-note, and so are its arrangements. It's irony. It's rock'n'roll. It's a listening experience not worth repeating a second time. Wisely if foolhardily, Everybody Was in the French Resistance... Now! have chosen to respond to songs already rich in history. Wisely, because it's difficult not to take ""The Scarborough Affaire"" on its own terms when the Simon and Garfunkel original was already based on a Martin Carthy arrangement of a traditional song. Foolhardily, because this approach also highlights Fixin' the Charts' shortcomings: The limply parodic indie funk of ""Billie's Genes"" has nothing on earlier answer records like Lydia Murdock's Billie-Jean's-view ""Superstar"". Argos is still witty, but here his punchlines tend to be predictable, due in part perhaps to the disc's overstretched answer-song conceit. I get that trying to reveal the emotional truth behind classic pop songs could theoretically be a way of giving Fixin' the Charts the sort of honesty about relationships that makes Bang Bang Rock & Roll or Art Brut vs. Satan stick with you for so long. But to ""fix"" the tacit anti-feminism of Avril Lavigne's ""Girlfriend"", ""G.I.R.L.F.R.E.N. (You Know I've Got A)"" would have to out-entertain her. Drunken indie-pop karaoke won't cause a generation of young women raised on Taylor Swift's ""You Belong With Me"" to stop fighting over boys and embrace girl power. Then again, everybody was on the right side of history... now. When the Replacements sang about a musical hero of theirs, on Pleased to Meet Me/""Rock Band 2"" fave ""Alex Chilton"", Paul Westerberg rasped, ""I'm in love/ What's that song?/ I'm in love/ With that song."" On ""Hey! It's Jimmy Mack""-- in which, guess what, Jimmy tells Martha and the Vandellas he's never coming back-- Argos quips, ""It certainly didn't deserve a song."" What makes for a mildly amusing MySpace click can lead to a painfully obnoxious album. Particularly when, if you really think about it-- and I'm hardly the first person to have this idea-- every song is an answer song. Why else would you form a band?","Art Brut's Eddie Argos teams with Dyan Valdés on an LP of ""answer songs""; what makes for a mildly amusing MySpace click can lead to a painfully obnoxious album.

Tapestry of Webs,Past Lives,by: Jason Crock,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a854c0084474cd0c0de0/1:1/w_160/11fed482.jpg,2010-02-18 06:00:02,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13940-tapestry-of-webs/,Suicide Squeeze,"Though three-fourths of the members of Past Lives are from the scorched-earth screamo/punk-metal Blood Brothers, there's nothing on the group's debut LP that offers a hint to their background. The EP that preceded it, Strange Symmetry, had some more cathartic moments-- as well as singer Jordan Blilie's hoarse, tantrum-in-the-toy-aisle screaming-- but Tapestry of Webs is a clean break from the past. Say what you will about their former band, but by the end of their career, Blood Brothers were anything but one-note. That they've changed gears isn't necessarily a surprise; that they stay in one gear and explore its possibilities is, however. Where the Blood Brothers were a study in extremes, this band and album are marked by quiet tension and gradual builds. The instrumentation has changed as well-- trumpets and woodwinds pop up on several tracks. The group has clearly reconsidered its approach, but nowhere is it more apparent than with the Blilie's singing. Only in the most frayed and frantic moments of songs like ""K Hole"" or ""Hospital White"" does he approach the screech of his other projects. Instead he sings on a low, stable register throughout, reaching for actual notes-- and if you've never heard his earlier projects, his voice might take a little getting used to. For those who are familiar with Blilie, part of what makes this record interesting is hearing his voice in a new context and how he adapts to it. The same extends to the rest of the band: Sometimes the group's subtlety builds into a soaring and assured melody, as it does in ""Paralyzer"" or the near-strut of ""Vanishing Twin"". There's often a tangible tension, as with ""Past Lives"", which grows progressively more ominous without ever offering release, or melodic, dub-inflected ""Deep in the Valley"" and ""Aerosol Bouquet"". Occasionally the band falls into a stilted and somewhat awkward lurch, like on the riff of ""Don't Let the Ashes Fill Your Eyes"", though even that has a striking and strangely lush chorus with layered vocal harmonies. The group does retain a raw, live in-the-room sound and feel, but above all the debut feels like a more ""mature"" record-- without any of the boring connotations the word ""mature"" usually implies when talking about career growth. After most of their peers have fallen by the wayside or have lost themselves to indulgence (looking at you, former members of At the Drive-In), Tapestry of Webs is an encouraging, welcome surprise-- a clear sign that the musicians involved are pushing themselves and searching for something new.","Former members of Blood Brothers make a clean break from the past by offering an LP marked by quiet tension and gradual builds.

We All Got Out of the Army,Robert Pollard,by: Paul Thompson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a8519d034d5c69bf39f7/1:1/w_160/6e7f2c80.jpg,2010-02-18 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13937-we-all-got-out-of-the-army/,"Guided By Voices, Inc.","An avalanche of records from Robert Pollard's projects-- the stellar Boston Spaceships, the extra skronky Circus Devils, a few one-offs and curios, and several records under his given name-- isn't a new thing. But the clip at which they've arrived lately seems almost superhuman. And while he's not immune to the occasional failure, since late 2008 or so Pollard has enjoyed a late-career renaissance, consistently rewarding those of us still paying attention. Messy though the sonics can be, there is something very deliberate about the construction of Pollard's recent work; even last summer's haywire Elephant Jokes felt like an attempt to capture the clipped construction of his muddy mid-90s masterpieces. We All Got Out of the Army, his first solo album of 2010, is a gleaming and hefty glam-pop record without the rough patches and rushed moments and that can bog him down, and it's among his most deliberate yet. ""Silk Rotor"" starts the album with an amicable enough guitar chug before exploding into a weighty stomp; after a string of fine LPs with less than stellar first tracks, it feels good to dive right into this one. ""Post-Hydrate Update"" lopes around into a nice series of hooks, and the thwacky ""Your Rate Will Never Go Up"" is similarly catchy. ""On Top of the Vertigo"" is one of Bob's best vocal performances in years, the gnarly track thrashing against an aside-laden tale of ""sleeping in a puddle of puke."" ""How Many Stations"" is a true lighters-in-the-air moment, while the manic title track might well inspire a mosh pit should this new studio rat incarnation of Pollard tour again. And ""Wild Girl"", a stripped-bare piece of melancholia that suggests Syd Barrett doing ""Across the Universe"", might just be the best tune here. A fine lot of Pollard songs is one thing, but it's gotta sound right, and right-hand-man Todd Tobias, working from his new studio, lends these numbers just the right amount of flash and grit. Unlike last year's The Crawling Distance, which found Tobias dressing up a drab grab-bag of Pollard tunes in the most utilitarian arrangements imaginable, the music here works against the songs beautifully. It's fuller, brighter, more nuanced, and more natural, closer to the much-loved Isolation Drills than almost anything else that's come since. And Pollard actually straps on a guitar and lets a few solos fly, a show of effort and personal involvement practically unheard of in the period immediately following Guided by Voices' split. Pollard's a loopy guitar player, favoring feel over form, but his personal touch helps to offset Tobias' steady hand. It wouldn't be a Pollard record without inspiring a raised eyebrow or two. The not quite right ""Rice Train"" is a little too weird to be wonderful, and ""Talking Dogs"" feels slight, as befits the set's shortest number. A few tunes, while not exactly sleepwalkers, seem driven by autopilot. Most egregiously, ""I Can See"" nicks the central riff from Pollard's best and most recognizable song, Bee Thousand's ""I Am a Scientist"", pretty much wholesale; it'd be a lousy trick if the tune that followed weren't pretty good, although, of course, ""Scientist"" it ain't. But if we're getting to a point where the worst thing you can say about a Bob Pollard record is that it's got a tune that reminds you of his best work, well, clearly we're getting somewhere. Last year was a good one for Pollard, and with a record like We All Got Out of the Army coming right out of the gate, 2010 is shaping up nicely.","Pollard's first solo album of 2010 is a hefty glam-pop record with a brighter, more nuanced sound reminiscent of GBV's Isolation Drills.

The Stimulus Package,FreewayJake One,by: Tom Breihan,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a84a9d034d5c69bf39ee/1:1/w_160/fe0671ee.jpg,2010-02-18 06:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13930-the-stimulus-package/,Rhymesayers,"The Stimulus Package comes housed in a gigantic money clip-- the liner notes on the backs of gigantic dollar bills with the faces of Freeway and Jake One on them, the CD itself in a cardboard wallet along with a download card for the instrumental version. As a design conceit, it's brilliant-- the packaging alone might make the album worth its price as a straight-up conversation piece. But it also highlights some of the weirdness surrounding the record's release, since the LP probably wouldn't exist if Freeway were still walking around with gigantic money clips in his pocket. When Free made his debut about a decade ago, he was part of Jay-Z's Roc-A-Fella stable, which means he debuted on the grandest stage imaginable. On tracks like ""1-900-HUSTLER"" and ""Rock the Mic"", his raspy, tense flow sounded perfectly at home next to Jay and Beanie Sigel. On his 2003 debut album, Philadelphia Freeway, Mariah Carey and Nelly made cameos. In 2004, it was mildly shocking to hear him alongside a backpack rapper like Mos Def on Kanye West's ""Two Words"". Then Roc-A-Fella imploded and the market for major-label rap dried up. And now Free's at Rhymesayers, labelmates with guys like BK-One and I Self Divine. But maybe the weirdest thing about Free's long migration underground is how much sense it makes. Free was always a role player on Roc-A-Fella, too knotty and intense to really stand any chance at mainstream stardom. And after the crew splintered, Free didn't stop working: A month of tracks released to the Internet every day, a middling street album, and now this. At Rhymesayers, Free's got a label with a built-in fanbase and, thanks in part to Brother Ali, an appetite for grown-man firebreathing. And he's also got the chance to team with Jake One, the journeyman producer who's worked with everyone from G-Unit to MF Doom to John Cena. Free is an East Coast rap fundamentalist at heart, and the idea of cranking out a full album with only one producer must've been tempting. Anyone who loved Roc-A-Fella in its prime has to root for Freeway, one of the crew's most vital presences, and it's great to see him land somewhere fitting. Plus it means we get the weird thrill of hearing Birdman on a Rhymesayers album, an unmistakable sign that rap's universe is shrinking so fast that nobody knows what the fuck to do. But feel-good story aside, this isn't Free's best work. When he recorded Philadelphia Freeway, he had an opportunity most rappers never get: He got to work with one of the greatest producers in history, Just Blaze, at his peak. Just produced most of the album, and his raging storms of old-soul pathos and drum-machine whirlwinds made a perfect complement to Free's strained ferocity. Everything Freeway and Just Blaze made together felt urgent and immediate, and Jake One, solid producer though he is, just doesn't have that level of intensity. Though not all the beats on The Stimulus Package feature actual musicians, most of them do have a sort of gritless, anonymous session-musician sheen to them. But even over tracks that scan as merely competent, Free's got one of those voices that demands attention. Too many of the songs on The Stimulus Package have goofy one-note concepts, which for some reason is almost always an issue when a once-popular rapper goes underground. So we get the song where Free talks about his rapping as a drug, or the one where he raps about the letters he gets from fans. Even on songs like these, though, Free comes with great little touches that keep things interesting. On ""Stimulus Outro"", the one with the letters, he adapts a slight Southern twang when rapping in the voice of a fan from North Carolina. On another, he calls a snitch a ""Bubbles from 'The Wire'-ass nigga"", which is sort of great. And he has a way with telling little details that ground his urgency and make it tangible: ""I'm not trying to do carpentry like my pops,"" ""I had my Walkman in my pocket, used to hop on the bus,"" shouting out his lawyers by name. The Stimulus Package would work better as an album if Free had a little more help directing his skills, or if he just decided to rap hard on every song instead of tying himself to concepts. But even the goofiest songs here are still fun listens, and a few tracks come close to capturing his old brilliance. ""Microphone Killa"" has no grand unifying idea; it's just Free and State Property comrade Young Chris rapping hard and fast over a classically funky beat. And ""Never Gonna Change"" is a riveting example of storytelling rap, though it would work better if Free didn't open with, ""It's like the Biggie 'Warning'."" Jake One's beat moves around constantly, injecting drum breakdowns every few measures, and Free takes it as a challenge, punctuating every breakdown by putting a syllable on every snare hit in a dizzying display of technical precision. The Stimulus Package might not have as many moments like these as Free's first two albums, but a few moments like that are still enough to make the LP one of the stronger rap releases of 2010 thus far.","The former Roc-A-Fella star brings his ferocious voice and unique intensity to Rhymesayers, here teaming on a record with Jake One.

Maudlin,Capgun Coup,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a837b1335d7bf1699224/1:1/w_160/917a2259.jpg,2010-02-17 06:00:04,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13912-maudlin/,Team Love,"Unless we're talking about an Andy Falkous project (like Mcklusky, or Future of the Left), you could safely assume a song called ""Bad Bands"" has a sense of self-referential jokiness. Such is the case with the track from Capgun Coup's second album, Maudlin-- wherein lead singer Sam Martin claims his favorite bands are bad ones, because they ""bang like pots and pans"" and ""will be your friends."" Good bands, on the other hand-- no soul, killing rock'n'roll. With that sort of pissy juvenilia, this record has to be called Maudlin for a reason, right? Capgun Coup are not quite as overt about arrested development as Team Love's most well-known act (Tilly and the Wall), but they're not particularly sold on the idea of growing up, as bullshit like employment and relationships are viewed as obstacles or, more often, reasons to get absolutely blotto. Over a Dylan-ized juke joint, ""Sitting on the Sidewalk"" finds Martin ""blackout fucking loaded"" while rattling off life's cruel, fleeting vicissitudes. ""Got a Lot of Gaul"" features an anarchic fuck-everything/fuck-me rejection of social structure. The title of ""When I'm Gone"" belies its narrative: Martin is physically present, but an assortment of chemicals and heartbreak has him way the fuck off the grid. Brutal stuff, but often kind of hard to hear under the plug-and-play mic'ing of Martin's vocals. It adds another layer of slapdash to the affair, though it can skew a bit toward seeming like an affectation. While the words themselves are of the here-and-now, Capgun Coup take refuge in the past several decades of rebel music, which subtly covers a lot of ground. ""Pretty City"" is about as good of an approximation of the Strokes' Is This It as you're liable to hear these days. ""Fishlip"" introduces a prickly surprise of a surf instrumental-- it's not so much a palette cleanser as a bracing shot-- while ""For Fish"" contrasts Mellotron and fuzzed-out acoustics for a curiously tasting textural mix. It's a rare find on an album that forgoes any sort of ambition in favor of grotty, two-chord garage that gets by more on enthusiasm than inventiveness. Everything about Maudlin, from its cover to its attitude, is as much about artifice and substance as a slice of 2 a.m. pizza-- enjoyable, sorta forgettable, but ultimately best after a half-dozen beers.","Team Love band embraces arrested development with a drink in one hand and Dylan's lyrics sheet in the other.

Peace & Love,Juliana Hatfield,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a80e9d034d5c69bf394f/1:1/w_160/bb38ec4e.jpg,2010-02-17 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13862-peace-love/,Ye Olde,"By now, Juliana Hatfield's business accomplishments have far outstripped her musical ones. In the early 1990s, she turned her cult notoriety with Blake Babies into ""120 Minutes"" buzz, and she harnessed the momentum from her 1993 decent-seller Become What You Are into something resembling a career. She's still going strong at a time when most of her alt-peers have long ago faded into obscurity or nostalgia tours. More than 20 years after her first recorded notes, she runs her own label (Ye Olde Records) and tours and releases albums on her own schedule. On her 10th solo album, Peace & Love, she goes from being her own boss to being her only employee: Not only did she record and produce it herself, but she played all the instruments, including guitar, piano, drums, and bass. Her DIY sensibility, still intact so deep into her career, is certainly admirable. Too bad it's not put in service of better music. With its acoustic strums and coffeehouse intimacy, Peace & Love sounds like that stalest of 90s relics: the unplugged album. In fact, it seems to be defined by Hatfield's  limitations rather than her strengths. Her playing is rudimentary throughout, and while occasionally that beginner's aesthetic leads to some nice moments, such as the overlapping guitar lines that open the instrumental ""Unsung"", generally it makes the absence of a full band seem like a bad idea. The lead guitar licks that open the title track are graceless and awkward; on piano, she repeats the same theme over and over until it grates; and on drums, she barely keeps time. Hatfield's voice has aged well over the years-- or, more to the point, it hasn't aged at all. While her kid-sister inflection might seem to undermine the maturity of her recent output, it actually adds a new and bittersweet dimension to some of her lyrics. At least that's how 2008's pained How to Walk Away worked. On Peace & Love, her songwriting sags with too many awkward rhyme schemes, clunky line meters, and come-together pronouncements. ""Why can't we love each other?"" she asks on ""Why Can't We Love Each Other?"" ""I won't give up on peace and love,"" she declares on the title track. Of course Peace & Love picks up considerably when she gets away from saving the world, but then again, the only difference between ""Butterflies"" and a middling Jewel song is history. ""I Picked You Up"" manages to devise a catchy chorus, but then runs it into the ground with too many repetitions. Some electricity might have given these songs some much-needed life, or sturdier lyrics might have given her acoustic DIY project a weightier anchor. As it is, Peace & Love sounds like a rough draft full of rookie mistakes, rather than a veteran defiantly going it alone.","Ten albums into her solo career, the alt-rock veteran goes it alone, playing every instrument in a mostly-acoustic setting.

The Minimal Wave Tapes: Vol. 1,Various Artists,by: Zach Kelly,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a8355e6ef95969321161/1:1/w_160/ccaff01c.jpg,2010-02-17 06:00:02,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13910-the-minimal-wave-tapes-vol-1/,Stones Throw,"New Yorker Veronica Vasicka has spent the past five years painstakingly and lovingly building Minimal Wave, a label that specializes in digging up and reissuing electronic DIY music from the late 1970s and 80s. From taking full control of the mastering process to creating packagings that border on the fetishistic, Vasicka has uncovered forgotten forays into independent new wave and synth-pop. Aptly dubbed ""minimal wave"", the genre's stock characteristics-- ticky-tacky drum machines, analog synthesizers, amateur vocal experimentation, lo-fi production-- seem more relevant than ever now, as a recent rash of DIYers have been toying with unpolished variations of everything from disco to IDM, using little more than a MIDI synth and a microphone. Thankfully, Stones Throw founder Peanut Butter Wolf-- who has devoted a great deal of time spotlighting leftfield niche records himself-- had the good sense to see the ""obsessed freak"" (his words) in Vasicka. ""I always wanted to do an album of this kind of stuff, but I don't want to try and compete with someone like Veronica who does it better than I ever could."" For those seeking a substantial once-over, Minimal Wave Tapes, Vol. 1 serves as a great introduction. Most of the releases on the imprint are vinyl only, so PB Wolf combed through Vasicka's vast collection (the two co-produced the project) and hand-picked the group of tracks that show up here. Though Vasicka has released compilations in the past, Tapes is the kind of primer that makes the overwhelming (and for the listener, rather expensive) process of weeding through these acts (hailing from Belgium to Spain to the States and beyond) a little easier. And though there is a commonality at work with the music featured, the genre variations that arise throughout the compilation-- ranging from punk-funk to early techno rumblings to chilly goth textures-- help orient the listener with what they might like to delve deeper into. Almost every track shares an exploratory, homemade feel in either production or the varying degrees of musicianship at work, and though it makes things sound a little lop-sided at times, it's an exciting peek into the experimental, underfunded aspect of a burgeoning trend. A lot of the music here is the underground response to the the well-selling synth-pop of the Second British Invasion. Oppenheimer Analysis' Andy Oppenheimer and Martin Lloyd bonded over the Human League and Soft Cell, and their ""Radiance"" echoes that chic, disaffected club feel. Certainly one of the poppier contributions here, it proceeds Crash Course in Science's ""Flying Turns"", a queasy, corroded chunk of Gang of Four-- acerbic, noisy but equally compelling. And while you can hear a little Kraftwerk just about everywhere, there's a wealth of varied personality that rescues these simple efforts from sounding too repetitive or indistinguishable. Most of the more memorable submissions fare better thanks to fuller construction and actual hooks, like the Joy Division-modeled ""Just Because"" by French trio Martin Dupont, or the English outfit Das Kabinette's ""The Cabinet"", which Ladytron can pretty much thank their entire career for. But what might be one of the coolest things that Minimal Wave Tapes accomplishes is how nicely it frames the current synth-pop renaissance, reinforcing the idea that there's room in the garage for sequencers and Korgs as well as guitars and drums. Hopefully we have a little time until we start hearing traces of Bene Gesserit's brand of goofy spoken word or Duex's ""Sprockets""-approved robo-schtick, but for now, there's plenty of really catchy touchstones being explored under early synth-pop's umbrella, many of which can be found in resurrected form over at Minimal Wave's site. And thanks to the parallel lines being drawn by Vasicka and the good folks over at Stones Throw, we might not have to bother with all that crate-digging to enjoy and experience it.","Stones Throw offers an expertly crafted introduction to a label focused on unearthing electronic DIY music from the late 1970s and 80s.

Measure,Field Music,by: Joshua Klein,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a83d5e6ef95969321170/1:1/w_160/cde37fc5.jpg,2010-02-17 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13917-measure/,Memphis Industries,"When Field Music announced in 2007 the group was going on hiatus, the band stressed that the break was not a break up. In the ensuing months, brothers David and Peter Brewis kept working-- the former as School of Language and the latter as the Week That Was-- each occasionally enlisting the services of the other. And now, a couple of years later, Field Music have indeed reunited (albeit minus keyboard/utility player Andrew Moore, reportedly training to be a chef). You've got to love a band that stays true to its word. Field Music last left off with 2007's Tones of Town, a relatively manageable 11 songs over a modest 30 or so minutes. The pair now seems refreshed and reenergized for the third Field Music LP, Measure-- it runs a staggering 20 tracks spread out over 70 minutes. Factor in the formidable arrangements, which often make a single song sound like two or three or four crammed together, and before you even press play you know Measure won't be casual listening. In that regard the brothers Brewis don't disappoint, either. Retaining an affinity for the fussier side of XTC, Field Music values careful precision over outright prodigious velocity, which keeps their music from tipping over into the proggy abyss. Further, it laces their songs with winningly fragmented melodies that don't always resolve or even repeat but still provide a vital point of entry to the band's rigorous compositions. That's the upside. The downside is that Field Music have a tendency to come off so cerebral, their charms are sometimes buried beneath the non-stop musical flourishes. Constantly inventive/evolving electric and acoustic guitar filigrees, meticulous percussion, strings, finger-snaps, handclaps, and intricate harmonies that bounce from speaker to speaker: Measure is, if nothing else, a truly crafted record. In fact, Measure crams so many complex twists and turns into each of its tracks that it starts out imposing and rarely lets up, making it a lot easier to give up than give in. That'd be a shame, since even though the band's constant motion can be exhausting, its pleasures aren't as far-flung as they first appear. ""Them That Do Nothing"", with its interlocking acoustic guitars, steady beat, and genial vibe, is a pop gem, and the surprisingly lithe ""Let's Write a Book"" sticks to a groove long enough to prove that the Brewises understand well when to keep things simple(r). ""The Rest Is Noise"" is proud pomp that gives way to a sinewy but satisfying denouement. It helps that the Brewis brothers have such a sharp understanding of space and, despite the sprawl, pacing, which is why they can get away with music this busy without completely overwhelming the listener. At times Measure feels like a suite, each track a separate part of the same (long) song that settles naturally into dynamic peaks and valleys. Admittedly, once closer ""It's About Time"" winds down into traffic sounds and hushed piano, you're likely to feel as much relief as exultation that Field Music made it this far without toppling off their precarious high wire and making a mess of themselves. But music this simultaneously careful and out of control would never get made if failure weren't a real risk.","After breaking to work as School of Language and the Week That Was, the brothers Brewis return for a new Field Music LP.

Causers of This,Toro y Moi,by: Joe Colly,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a84b5e6ef95969321197/1:1/w_160/776d2d1d.jpg,2010-02-17 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13931-causers-of-this/,Carpark,"About six months removed from the summer of chillwave, Toro Y Moi's debut LP is being released in the dead of winter. Which is kind of great, if only because it prohibits us from falling back on categorizing Chaz Bundick's sound as ""beach music."" After all, chillwave was never really about the beach. Even if the springy sounds of Neon Indian and Washed Out often felt coastal and waterlogged, the style was always more about texture and atmosphere than it was about place. As Bundick told me in a recent interview, ""The beach thing is coincidental. If I look at a band like Best Coast or Wavves, they live on the beach. I go to the beach, like, once a year."" The other hump to get over when discussing chillwave is the purported sameyness of the artists involved. You know, the idea that Toro Y Moi isn't really that different from Washed Out, Memory Tapes is basically an ambient Neon Indian, and so forth. This one's a little more difficult because there really are clear aesthetic similarities between these guys. Still, there are distinctions. Looking at Toro Y Moi in comparison to Washed Out and Neon Indian, the main difference is that the latter two put more of an emphasis on hooks. Their songs are generally catchier and more straightforwardly composed. Bundick, on the other hand, is more producer than songwriter. While they might lack the immediacy of a ""Deadbeat Summer"" or ""Feel It All Around"", his tracks often have deeper, more interesting layers. Which approach you prefer will impact how much you get out of Causers of This. The album is geared more toward those who appreciate production, and in some ways is a departure from Bundick's earlier singles such as ""109"" and ""Sad Sams"". At times guitar-based, those songs were generally pretty punchy and utilized a fair amount of lo-fi tape hiss. Here, though, Bundick embraces a cleaner and mellower sound that's more indebted to hip-hop. He wears his inspirations proudly, and throughout there's a clear nod to producers like J Dilla and Flying Lotus. What he extracts from these sources, Bundick combines with his own vocals and other instrumentation to make warm, wobbly pop songs that, while not always as catchy as his contemporaries', are distinctive and appealing in their own right. The album starts out strong with a string of tracks that showcase Bundick's range. First two songs ""Blessa"" and ""Minors"" exhibit his pop sensibilities, setting a wash of vocals over looped electro-funk instrumentals and crisp drum programming. Here Bundick strikes a nice balance between sticky vocal melodies and the undulating arrangements that feature through the rest of the record. On other tracks in the first half, he takes on genre experiments with similar success-- first jaunty piano soul on ""Imprint After"" and then sparkly disco with ""Lissoms"", the album's most propulsive moment. While these songs are all enjoyable, ""Fax Shadow"" serves as the best representation of Toro's potential. It's the most complex track here, and in its Dilla soul sampling and distorted beat pattern, Bundick shows production skill far beyond most of his peers. Each of these songs work in a similar way. Instead of using crude production, he manipulates sounds to create texture. It's the way ""Freak Love""'s drums fall off that enhances its mood, not that they sound blown-out or tinny. This craftsmanship carries him through most of the album, but begins to fade towards the end. Bundick doesn't run out of ideas at this point, but his balance of arrangement and song feels off. ""You Hid"" is wobbly but one-note, lacking punch, and the closing title track is too cluttered. If Causers of This stayed consistent through the end, it might be up there with the assured debuts of his peers; instead, it's just a few notches below.","More of a producer than a composer, Toro Y Moi carries the chillwave torch into 2010 and works best when he's exploring sounds instead of songs.

Found Songs,Ólafur Arnalds,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a7c0c0084474cd0c0c7f/1:1/w_160/33d8d3a2.jpg,2010-02-16 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13808-found-songs/,Erased Tapes,"The work of Iceland's Ólafur Arnalds-- essentially a simplified, melodically forthright take on chamber music-- straddles the worlds of indie rock and classical. He's already opened for Sigur Rós, and like them, he isn't afraid to go right for the emotional jugular. Found Songs collects seven compositions, mainly for piano and strings, each created and Tweeted in a single day. Appropriately, they're concise: Grand, melancholy themes explored for two or three minutes apiece, sometimes closer to etudes than songs. But the slow pacing and careful recording lend an opulent scale to the compact spaces, and the pieces work like tiny yet detailed scenes in music boxes, charming and sad. Throughout the album, a mood of doomed romance prevails. On ""Erla's Waltz"", a stately heartbreaker for solo piano, you can practically see the elegant ceramic figurines turning their tragic steps, and the plangent melody bowed across ""Faun"" seems to be openly weeping. There are few ""difficult"" passages, only limpid revolutions of melody and counterpoint with an overemphasis on climaxes. The album approaches that troublesome quality-- sentimentality-- with earnestness and faith. It's like Arnalds is picking up cues from the emotionally-charged ambient of Eluvium as the latter embarks on a new vocal-centered style. From music-box melodies to maudlin strings, Found Songs dispenses clichés at an astonishing pace, which makes it seem both under- and overwhelming at first. (How easy is it to admire and then forget pretty albums filled with strings, pianos, and light field recordings?) It seems too stirring in a way that's too easy. But Arnalds' attention to nuance amid all the fanfare, and to tone at every moment, goes a long way toward redeeming those intense emotions we write off as puerile. On ""Romance"", the wearily hopeful, Satie-like piano line sidewinds briefly into a more tentative-sounding key before righting itself again, an unsentimental touch that makes everything around it more piercing. Slight thematic complications like this hint at a formidable future for Arnalds, once he sheds some youthful excesses. But even when they smother his subtler instincts, his passions have a certain charm, and arrangements that could have been weak tea gain a palpable kick. You feel moved, but not quite used, and Found Songs feels special beyond the means of its borderline wallpaper-y aesthetic.","The young Icelandic composer who has opened for Sigur Rós constructs an album of short but emotionally-charged pieces for strings and piano.

XXXX,You Say Party,by: Rebecca Raber,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a83eb1335d7bf1699232/1:1/w_160/6d42611d.jpg,2010-02-16 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13918-xxxx/,Paper Bag,"It's a good thing You Say Party! We Say Die!-- the Canadian dance-punk quintet who had famously been barred from entering the United States for the past four years-- have finally gotten their visa problems worked out in time for the American release of their third LP, XXXX. Because, more than any point in their career, audiences will want to hear their new songs live. While other bands of their ilk petered out along with the intensity of the public's interest in dance-punk, YSP!WSD! have chugged along, touring tirelessly through Europe, and finally developing beyond the constraints of hi-hat 16th notes and wiry, stabbing guitar lines on a collection that encompasses both the gothic ambiance of Siouxsie and the Banshees and the tough-girl 1980s hooks of Pat Benatar. At first glance the new album's title may seem like a reference to a porn rating, but the multiple titular Xs are actually acting as a stand-in for a four-letter word-- and not the one you think. As proved by opening track ""There Is XXXX (Within My Heart)"" and its repeated ""there is love within my heart, there is love, love, love"" refrain, XXXX stands for ""love,"" which attests that the band is now more interested in feelings than actions. In the past, the five-piece dwelled firmly in the realm of physical wants-- see songs like ""Cold Hands! Hot Bodies!"" and their breathless rhythms and thumping basslines. But the slower pace and more sentimental outlook of XXXX gives listeners the necessary space and encouragement to surrender to the band's emotional message. That message, though overwhelmingly positive, is married to melodies that are antithetically moody, melancholic, and minor-key. So while singer Becky Ninkovic sounds besotted, she layers lines about the redemptive and uplifting power of love against sinister synths and the hard edges of needling, repetitive guitar riffs. YSP!WSD! have long been compared to Yeah Yeah Yeahs-- after all, both are bands fronted by strong-voiced frontwomen who possess banshee caterwauls, and both are enamored of confrontational yet danceable rhythms and arty, aggressive riffs. And much like how Karen O and her crew reinvented themselves as louche, grooving synth-poppers on It's A Blitz, YSP!WSD! have similarly overhauled themselves for XXXX. Comfortable now on gentle, prettily sung slow-burners like ""Heart of Gold"" as well as on throttling, thickly percussive barnburners like ""Cosmic Wanship Avengers"", YSP!WSD! have made something unexpectedly tender out of darkly colored and often heavily propulsive material. A lot of credit goes to Ninkovic, whose voice is richer and smoother than ever on these new songs. Distancing herself from comparisons to the tarter, more prickly Karen O, Ninkovic has finally found a unique voice that is still emotive but way less shrill than before, and it adds a welcome warmth to the collection. Her voice, like her band's sound, has grown beyond the limitations of YSP!WSD!'s early genre confines, giving the band new legs. Perhaps all they needed to mature was the incentive of a now-possible U.S. tour. And, of course, a little bit of XXXX.","Canadian dance-punk survivors' new album looks like a winking porn reference but it's a moody, melancholy look at another four-letter word.

Dream Get Together,Citay,by: Grayson Currin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a850c0084474cd0c0dd9/1:1/w_160/5436d3ab.jpg,2010-02-16 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13936-dream-get-together/,Dead Oceans,"""I don't feel a need to distance myself from anything I like,"" Ezra Feinberg told a magazine in 2006, not long after the release of Citay, his extravagant self-titled debut of unbridled classic rock grandiosity for Important Records. ""If anything I want to bring myself (and my bandmates, as well as my friends and family) closer to everything I like."" The interviewer had asked Feinberg about irony in his music-- specifically, how he hoped the irony of Led Zeppelin references, sizzling electric leads, and a heroic, fantasy-rock instrumental dubbed ""Vinter"" might work amidst a landscape of cynics and smartasses. After one record, it might've been hard to say much of Feinberg's intentions. Yeah, those classic riffs ruled, and the layers of warm Jethro Tull and ELO textures that he and producer (and former Fucking Champ) Tim Green stuffed into Grateful Dead-like shapes sounded fantastic. But what about that flute? And those keyboard layers and string-section sprees? He must be teasing at least a little bit, right? If any doubt lingered after Little Kingdom, Citay's triumphant and enormous 2007 debut for Dead Oceans, then Dream Get Together-- Feinberg's third and most expansive album as Citay-- dispels it entirely. From the Fleetwood Mac grandeur of the ballad ""Mirror Kisses"", sung by tUnE-YaRdS' Merrill Garbus, to the five minutes of instrumental swagger of ""Secret Breakfast"", Dream Get Together gathers the totems and taboos of 1970s rock and, as the record's title suggests, treats them all like the guests of some imagined jam session. At times, it might seem a tad cornball or cute, but Citay make triumphant, affirming music that leaves no room for irony. Dream Get Together's closer, a cover of the 1988 Galaxie 500 single ""Tugboat"", is the most concise and accessible example. A room-filling acoustic guitar, more brisk and bold than it is schmaltzy, takes the rhythm, and a radiating electric line washes atop, announcing the theme in advance of Feinberg's, for once, dominant vocals. ""I don't want to stay at your party/ I don't want to talk with your friends/ I don't want to vote for your president,"" he sings in harmony with himself. If the original take followed those declarations with question marks or uncertain ellipses, Feinberg chases them with exclamation points. Like the Galaxie 500 take, Citay end with an extended guitar vamp. But Galaxie 500's dissonance and stuttered lines wound tightly in turmoil. Feinberg and Green whirl in delight, their foil guitars treating the exit more like a liftoff than a comedown. It just feels good. That holds for much of Dream, too. The title track, for instance, is a total celebration-- shakers, strums, and big drums opening the door for a sharp guitar line and Feinberg's summertime revelry. In one verse, he references Neil Diamond and Steely Dan and, more importantly, details the joy of his dreams-- ""two hands out the window, two hands shifting gears."" Opener ""Careful with That Hat"" is a sidewinding epic veering between choral swells, a Motorik midsection, and a solo that sends San Francisco's past exploding into the air like sparks. Through it all, Citay supply a surprising amount of editing and elegance to these jams. Just two break the seven-minute mark. When Garbus' oohs and aahs float through a thick keyboard-and-acoustic haze on ""Mirror Kisses""-- or even when the guitars lock in long, winding harmonies during ""Fortunate Sun""-- Citay remain controlled and careful. Songs are constructed so that each line plays a certain role, every note tells its tale. Maybe that's where it will lose some listeners, too: It's not tough and rough and wild around the edges like Green's old band could be, or a lot of heavy metal can be. And it's not open at the ends like jam-band music. But this is Feinberg's third album of eight tracks in about 40 minutes, all exploring the same excitable intersection of psychedelia and pop. By now, he doesn't seem to be the sort to back down from his musical decisions or not to pursue the lavish sounds he hears in his head. Good thing, too: If he did, these intense little trips would be a lot less fun.","Ezra Feinberg again gathers the totems and taboos of 1970s rock, exploring the excitable intersection of psychedelia and pop.

Kollaps Tradixionales,Thee Silver Mt. Zion Memorial Orchestra,by: Stuart Berman,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a8439d034d5c69bf39d8/1:1/w_160/9ddf45a8.jpg,2010-02-16 06:00:01,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13924-kollaps-tradixionales/,Constellation,"Ten years ago, Thee Silver Mt. Zion appeared as one of many satellite projects orbiting around the Godspeed You! Black Emperor mothership, alongside fellow offshoot acts like Fly Pan Am and 1-Speed Bike. Today, it has supplanted the long-dormant godspeed as Constellation Records' flagship act-- not just in terms of popularity or acclaim, but as outspoken exemplars of the label's uncompromised business ethics. That outcome, however, seems less the product of a grand master plan-- as legend has it, the band was originally formed by Godspeed's Efrim Menuck, Sophie Trudeau, and Thierry Amar to pay musical tribute to Menuck's recently deceased dog-- than part of a dutiful obligation to fill an ideological void in underground rock culture. Over the course of a decade when Fugazi fell silent, Touch and Go Records shut down, and indie rock became a music-supervision goldmine, Thee Silver Mt. Zion have incrementally evolved from a meditative, mostly instrumental orchestro-folk ensemble into an imposingly heavy, politically enraged rock band, with Menuck emerging as the most seething, peculiar agit-punk mouthpiece since Guy Picciotto. Naturally, not all of TSMZ's early adopters have been eager to follow the band's transformation into psych-metal curmudgeons-- 2008's mordantly hostile 13 Blues for Thirteen Moons was the band's most divisive release. Kollaps Tradixionales makes no apologies for this shift, but it does defuse 13 Blues' sometimes oppressive air by reconciling the band's current incarnation with its more graceful earlier output. Because, for all the change that TSMZ have undergone in the past 10 years, their music remains rooted in the ideology of perseverance in a cruel world. That quality is reflected in the band's collaborations with various veteran outsiders (Patti Smith, Grant Hart, the late Vic Chesnutt), and in Menuck's own torn and frayed voice. On 2001's Born Into Trouble as the Sparks Fly Upward, a young girl is heard to say, ""All we need is a little more light""; Kollaps Tradixionales revisits the sentiment on opener ""There Is a Light"". The song's theme of hard-won hope plays out in its structure-- a series of attempted ascensions and soft landings, each aiming higher than the one previous. With its church-organ hum, waltzing string, and brass arrangements-- and a final act where Menuck starts belting it out like David Bowie on ""Five Years""-- this side-long suite is the most genial, comforting piece of music the band has produced in years. But it's also a red herring, establishing a false sense of levity on an album that grows increasingly dark and despairing. ""There Is a Light"" is immediately answered by the two-part ""I Built Myself a Metal Bird""/""I Fed My Metal Bird the Wings of Other Metal Birds"", which redirects 13 Blues' bulldozing menace into more accelerated, exhilarating chamber-punk. The song's war-machine allusions climax with Menuck hysterically shouting, ""dance, motherfuckers!""-- revealing not so much a desire to shake our hips as to point guns at our feet. If ""Metal Bird"" captures TSMZ at their most incendiary, the trio of tracks that comprise the album's third side present the scorched-earth aftermath: ""Kollapz Tradixional (Thee Olde Dirty Flag)"" and ""Collapse Traditional (For Darling)"" are somber hymns that ruminate on faded glory, before the triptych's closing piece, ""Kollaps Tradicional (Bury 3 Dynamos)"", rides a psychedelicized Celtic reel skyward and explodes into a Zep-heavy grind. But TSMZ's perpetual process of channeling frailty into ferocity-- the recurring patterns of rising and falling, flaming out and reigniting-- has had a noticeably exhausting effect on the band by the time we reach album closer ""'Piphany Rambler"". Clocking it at 14 minutes, and staking claim to the album's entire fourth side, the song charts a pained, slow-crawling course similar to that of its nomadic, mountain-climbing narrator, the severity of his journey intensified by windswept string swells. And in that, it's hard not to draw parallels with TSMZ's own course-- an autonomous rock band trying to assert its ethics, ideals, and political will in an indie rock culture that seems to value those principles less and less with each passing year. But when Menuck sings, ""We crawled upside that mountain/ Down its ass and back again,"" his matter-of-fact delivery implies he's not expecting any great reward for his grunt-work. In fact, in the midst of the song's stormy finale, he pleads, ""don't take these blues away""-- suggesting that Thee Silver Mt. Zion Memorial Orchestra are well aware their own perseverance is emboldened by the very cultural forces that threaten it.","Constellation's flagship band continues to evolve from a meditative orchestro-folk ensemble into a politically enraged rock band.

Scratch My Back,Peter Gabriel,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a849c0084474cd0c0dc8/1:1/w_160/e97ad82f.jpg,2010-02-16 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13935-scratch-my-back/,VirginRealworld,"What's he doing here? That was the first question that came to mind when a cover of Vampire Weekend's ""Cape Cod Kwassa Kwassa"" showed up on blogs in 2008, featuring Peter Gabriel's familiar voice singing lead over Hot Chip's backing: ""Feels so unnatural/ Peter Gabriel too,"" goes the oft-quoted refrain, to which Gabriel added, ""And it feels so unnatural/ To sing your own name."" It was surprising because Gabriel seemed like the kind of artist who would remain blissfully ignorant of the changes that have befallen the music business in the years since he released his last album, Up, in 2002. Somewhere between the time of the smash So in 1986 and the launch of the Human Rights Now! tour in 1988, Gabriel seemed to transcend the pop machine. He'd undertake offbeat projects (scoring films like The Last Temptation of Christ, making an early stab at interactive art with the EVE CD-ROM), release an album or two when he felt like it, mount the occasional tour, and appear on the odd film or TV soundtrack. But with his graying hair, air of intelligent dignity, and avoidance of celebrity trappings, he was the rare pop star who didn't seem to mind losing relevance or growing old. The last place you expected this guy to show up was singing lead on a blog-bait Vampire Weekend cover. If nothing else, that Hot Chip cameo mitigated the shock that otherwise came with news that Gabriel's next full-length, Scratch My Back, would be a covers record, featuring songs by Arcade Fire, Bon Iver, Radiohead, and the Magnetic Fields, along with work by Gabriel contemporaries like David Bowie, Lou Reed, and Paul Simon. From the outset, it sounded like an idea dreamed up by a management team, a way to introduce Gabriel to the coveted New Generation of Listeners. But a recent interview on The Quietus, where Gabriel ran down the song selections and explained how he was introduced to each, revealed the project's organic roots. The Scratch My Back songs are either lushly orchestrated by the Durutti Column's John Metcalfe or feature just solo piano; all are arranged in a sweeping cinematic style that steers clear of the Hot Chip collab's playfulness and humor. There's a fleeting ""Hey, neat"" factor in hearing Gabriel use his legendary ""I'm bathing in red rain"" / ""I'm shooting into the light"" upper register on lyrics by Justin Vernon and Elbow's Guy Garvey. And there's no question that the years have been kind to Gabriel's vocal instrument: he sounds ready to launch into a full-throated chorus of ""San Jacinto"" at any moment. But once the initial novelty wears off, we're left with some ponderous, dull, and ultimately pointless versions of songs that sound much better elsewhere. Every song on Scratch My Back, regardless of its original tone or meaning, is flattened out and turned into this one melodramatic and depressing thing, often with Gabriel whispering half the words to go with the ultra-slow tempos. This uniformity of mood highlights the most puzzling aspect of the record: Gabriel's clunky phrasing. Throughout, he seems to be singing words without necessarily understanding what they mean. If you close your eyes you can almost see him reading them off paper. ""You know me, I like to dream a lot/ Of what there is and what there's not,"" he sings in Lou Reed's ""The Power of the Heart"". Heard with Gabriel's stiff delivery, the humble declaration is entirely unconvincing. His take on David Bowie's ""Heroes"", glacially slow and building to a single climax, affirms, like many failed takes before it, that the original is about 70% brilliant record and 30% brilliant song. On Paul Simon's ""The Boy in the Bubble"", the New York Knicks fan's line about a ""turn-around jump shot"" sounds exceedingly silly inside of a heavy, life-or-death funeral ballad. All of which is to say that this album sounds earnest, professional, and ultimately very awkward. When the orchestra reaches yet another world-shattering crescendo on Arcade Fire's ""My Body Is a Cage"" (one more fine record that sounds melodically feeble in this setting), things almost start to drift into the campy territory of William Shatner's The Transformed Man. This album is called Scratch Your Back because all of the songwriters here will eventually return the favor and cover a song of Gabriel's, to be collected on a sequel. Here's hoping they have better luck. As for this collection, Feels So Unnatural wouldn't have been a bad title, either.","The dignified prog and pop star returns from another long layoff with a covers LP featuring takes on Arcade Fire, Bon Iver, Radiohead, and Magnetic Fields.

Mountain Debris,A Grave With No Name,by: Joe Colly,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a845c0084474cd0c0dbd/1:1/w_160/c3a96912.jpg,2010-02-15 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13926-mountain-debris/,No Pain in PopLefse,"Alex Shields, the songwriter behind A Grave With No Name, is British, but you'd never guess it by his appearance. With long hair and a penchant for wearing Weezer tees, his look is straight out of 1990s alt America. Which fits, since A Grave With No Name (ostensibly a solo bedroom-pop project but now fleshed out as a three-piece) features many of the hallmarks of 90s guitar indie from this side of the pond-- Pavement slop, the crackle and fuzz of GBV, and so on. But Shields isn't a revisionist, more a mixed-genre collagist, and the other sounds he incorporates are decidedly of the moment-- lo-fi haze, hypnagogic pop pastiche, and gurgly aquatic sound effects are all part of his approach. In fact, if you wanted a time capsule of what a good chunk of 2009 and early 2010 sounded like, Mountain Debris could be it. That might sound like a dig, but it's not. Shields is part of a crowded pack of artists working in this style-- think also Atlas Sound and Banjo or Freakout-- but his take is punchier than the others, yet still heavy on mood and atmosphere. With material thus far scattered on limited-run releases (a self-titled EP arrived last summer), Mountain Debris collects that earlier work alongside some newer tracks and functions as a handy guide on what the band does well and where it could stand to improve. The album works its way through a variety of song types in short bursts and hangs together in part because it doesn't linger in one spot for too long. (At 16 tracks, it's still just a little over a half an hour long.) The standard vibe here is a spooky, overcast take on melodic guitar jangle, like C86 stranded out in the woods at night, but Shields and co. take plenty of detours to keep things interesting. Often the best stuff is the simplest, like the warm, encrusted melodies of ""Sofia"", which serves as a good example of how lo-fi production can be not just a textural effect but a way to add depth and intrigue to a song. (This is important, lo-fi upstarts!) There's a clear sense of loss and longing in this track, and that runs throughout the record-- most conspicuous on grainy shoegaze exercises like [#script:http://pitchfork.com/media/backend/js/tiny_mce/themes/advanced/langs/en.js]|||||| ""Lavender"" and ""Silver"". Mountain Debris can feel scattered, quickly jumping from one idea to the next, yet that doesn't pose a problem until the final stretch. Through ""Horses"", this restless quality actually helps keep your attention. At that point and after, though, you get the sense that the band has run out of ideas and the album starts to stumble. ""Horses"" is shout-y and atonal, not particularly appealing, and the tracks that follow each have a similar fatal flaw: ""Fire Island"" is weirdly kind of proto-grunge meets mumbly lo-fi, ""Chimes"" is too wispy for its own good, and so forth. This stutter to a halt isn't an ideal way to end a record, but it's not quite enough to derail the strong moments that come before it. Mostly Mountain Debris is an encouraging listen, a solid introduction to a band that I'm sure we'll hear more from.","Mixing 90s alt rock and of-the-moment lo-fi haze and hypnagogic pop pastiche, this UK auteur is crafting a very now sound.

Face a Frowning World: An E.C. Ball Memorial Album,Various Artists,by: Stephen M.

Ball faced a frowning world, he did so with a smile. Or at least that's the impression his songs give-- that the stern-voiced singer and songwriter took immense joy in praising the Lord through music. When he wasn't driving a school bus and running a service station in Rugby, Virginia, the folk-gospel artist and his wife Orna traveled around Appalachia, playing churches of all denominations and radio stations of all wattages. Ball was no fire-and-brimstone scold, though, nor did he fashion himself as a God-appointed teacher with special moral authority. Instead, he remained humble, content, and hopeful, writing simple songs with simple messages. Even at his darkest, his songs celebrate faith: ""Lord, I want more religion,"" he sings on one of his most famous compositions. ""Religion makes me happy."" Not that every song is upbeat, but Ball preached salvation more than damnation. By and large, the artists on Face a Frowning World, which declares itself  a ""memorial album"" rather than a tribute (I'm guessing for reasons of Christian humility), revere this aspect of Ball's music, and in covering his songs, they also consider his faith-- whether they share it or not. Dave Bird testifies proudly on ""He's My God"", and Bonnie ""Prince"" Billy extols the stalwartness of ""John the Baptist"" before keening ostentatiously over Catherine Irwin's earthy vocals on ""Beautiful Star of Bethlehem"". By contrast, Rayna Gellert's soft-spoken ""Lord, I Want More Religion"" is a ruminative, plainspoken prayer, a subdued take that suggests a one-on-one with the Big Man Himself. Even on ""Tribulations"", sung here by Joe Manning and Glen Dentinger, Ball's depiction of the apocalypse contrasts dramatically with the promise of rescue and reward: ""When the fire come down from heaven and the blood shall fill the sea, I'll be carried home by Jesus and forever with him be."" The two Louisville musicians sing those lines steadfastly, with a content resignation bolstered by the band's spare arrangement. Face a Frowning World has the feel of a jubilee, as Louisville's Health & Happiness Family Gospel Band back a range of Ball fans and followers with the enthusiasm of a Sunday morning pick-up band. On the whole, they keep things loose and lively, although at times their energy gets the better of them: They liven up Jon Langford's ""When I Get Home I'm Gonna Be Satisfied"", but while the spirit is willing, their cover is too loud, too lusty, too worldly. Not that Ball was strictly a religious singer. In fact, he and his wife had a sprawling repertoire that included secular songs, and Face a Frowning World strains to make room for a few of them. Michael Hurley smocks through ""The Early Bird Always Gets the Worm"" as if he wrote it himself, and Pokey LaFarge turns ""Poor Old Country Lad"" into a jumpin' C&W romp. On the other hand, the Handsome Family inexplicably transform the playful children's rhyme ""Jenny Jenkins"" into a slow, dour duet that sucks all the fun out of the song's jumble of syllables. They turn Ball's smile upside down.","Bonnie ""Prince"" Billy, the Handsome Family, and others cover this itinerant folk-gospel artist, who preached salvation more than damnation.

In the 1990s, women from Riot Grrrl to PJ Harvey made joyously raw, aggressive, and polemical rock, now a much-missed sound. That is what makes Wetdog-- a British all-woman trio whose sophomore effort celebrates their percussive, atonal foremothers like the Slits, the Raincoats, and LiLiPUT-- sound so fresh despite their obvious influences. After all, the girls at home with their videogame plastic Gibsons need Guitar Heroes, too. After their 22-track 2008 debut, Wetdog return with the more concise Frauhaus. The new LP blows through its 14 songs in less than half an hour, building its tracks out of sinister, plucky bass rumblings, alternately bored and screechy vocals, and rhythms so geometric that it would be cliché to call them ""angular,"" were that not already the name of the band's British label. The album kicks off with first single ""Lower Leg"", which gets a lot of mileage out of wiry rhythms and an urgently pulsing bassline. Rhythms shift from a syrupy strut to a chaotic double-time, and the strangely disjointed symmetry that holds the first track together acts as connective tissue for the rest of the collection. ""Snapper"" weaves its creepy-carnival polka melody around spaghetti western rhythms, while ""Trehorne Beach Song"" adds a pretty garage-pop shimmy into the mix, and ""Long Long Time to Go"" layers a menacing guitar throb and deadpan harmonies over a steady, militaristic march. There is a powerful yet playful chaos to the way the collection is organized, but that is part of its charm. One can't help wish, however, that some of the songs were given space to breathe, especially the much-too-short ""Trehorne Beach Song"" and the ethereally harmonized ""Round Vox"". Rather than allowing their tensely con [#script:http://pitchfork.com/media/backend/js/tiny_mce/themes/advanced/langs/en.js]|||||| structed, minimalist melodies to blossom into infectious hooks, often a sloppy verse and a brash chorus is all they can spare in a track's quick, two-minute runtime.

Falling Down a Mountain,Tindersticks,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a7f2b1335d7bf169917c/1:1/w_160/53699768.jpg,2010-02-15 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13849-falling-down-a-mountain/,4ADConstellation,"On the Tindersticks website recently, there was a video splash page announcing the new album that featured footage of the band playing its title track and introducing them one at a time. The first member mentioned was keyboardist and co-founder David Boulter. He's one of the architects of the band's sound, and his piano and organ have been signatures of the band for almost 20 years. And in the video he was playing... tambourine. His big moment on camera didn't show him doing what he does best. There is something perversely appropriate about this-- Tindersticks have always made music that thrives on their lack of egos, and here Boulter was just doing what the song asks for. The track in question is an odd one, opening the band's eighth album (not counting soundtracks), and in terms of vocals it's more of a mantra than a song. There are three lines of lyrics, sung over and over in different combinations by smoky-voiced Stuart Staples and bassist Dan McKinna as the band provides jazzy drumming and wiry guitar figures. Longtime collaborator and satellite band member Terry Edwards plays sputtering trumpet, and the word is that he wasn't allowed to listen to it while playing-- they just told him what it sounded like. That kind of creative process-- encouraging the happy accident-- and the overall dialogue-ish approach to building a song that marks Falling Down a Mountain as an attempt to re-energize the veteran band. This is their second album since half of the original sextet quit. Its predecessor, 2008's The Hungry Saw, exhibited some of the same tentativeness. They are, in a sense, a new band living in the long shadow of an old one. Their first three albums were difficult masterpieces, their next few strange explorations of soul music, their sixth a summary and a farewell. Albums seven and eight have been relaxed and seemingly unconcerned with besting the old stuff. That's probably for the best, as it lets them crank out the kind of simple pleasures that seem to flow naturally from them. On this album, that's evident on low-volume lullaby ""Keep You Beautiful"", which is like a Willie Mitchell production stripped to its barest, topped by a guy with molasses for vocal chords. Elsewhere, ""Factory Girls"" is a simple but lush piano-led ballad that lets Staples play around in his upper register as he licks romantic wounds and ruminates on aging. It stays sparse until its final minute, when the whole band comes in to lift him up. McKinna and the other new members, drummer Earl Harvin and guitarist David Kitt, provide Tindersticks with something they've never had before: a backing vocal section that can go call-and-response with Staples. They do it best on ""Black Smoke"", a Velvet Underground-type groove that features plenty of backing harmonies and a crazy sax part that sounds like it wandered off from a Roxy Music session. The Latin-flavored ""She Rode Me Down"" is another standout, pulling the band together into a rhythmic juggernaut. At the complete opposite end of things is ""Peanuts"", a spartan duet between Staples and singer/actress Mary Margaret O'Hara that never gets anywhere-- it's sparse to the point of boring, and next to past duet highlights like ""Travelling Light"" it pales completely. Especially during its quietest moments, this album is almost more like the memory of a song than the song itself. It leaves a very hazy, almost spectral impression when it ends. But it's also warm and in some ways comforting, and it improves the more you listen to it and tease out the details in the songs. Tindersticks Mk II seems to be hitting its stride and discovering where its real creative chemistry lies.","The veteran UK band continues to re-locate itself on this, its second album since the departure of three of its original six members.

Gorilla Manor,Local Natives,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a8449d034d5c69bf39dc/1:1/w_160/e3cedc37.jpg,2010-02-15 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13925-gorilla-manor/,Frenchkiss,"Gorilla Manor, the debut album from L.A.'s Local Natives, features rustic and yearning vocals, three-part harmonies, clattering percussion, wiggly guitar leads, euphoric chanting, and a Talking Heads cover. In short, the Silver Lake quintet have followed indie rock's major players in recent years-- they knew how to dress for success in 2010. Great for them-- now, what's in it for you? Plenty as it turns out. Local Natives have already gained a foothold in parts of Europe-- their album has received attention in the UK and they graced the cover of Scandinavia's Sonic magazine late last year-- at home in L.A., and online. With good reason too: Advance singles ""Airplanes"" and ""Sun Hands"" recalled elements of Dodos or the Fleet Foxes. The best comparison perhaps is that they're sort of a West Coast Grizzly Bear-- right down to naming an album after the location in which it was recorded. Yet whereas Grizzly Bear's Yellow House is a cozy, isolated New England seaside shack, Local Natives' Gorilla Manor is a squalid Orange County party pad. At first listen that seems off-- the chops and compositional sense here are the most immediately impressive part of the album. But dig deeper and you realize Local Natives never lose sight of the pleasures of being a youthful rock band-- right down to themes of wanderlust and discovery. ""Oh, to see it with my own eyes,"" goes to the central lyrics to album opener ""Wide Eyes"". This inquisitiveness and quest for self-knowledge may as well be the record's life-affirming and open-armed thesis statement. Indeed, this optimism relishes experience and finds opportunity where others may see obstacles: Garage rocker ""Camera Talk"" initially reads like a harried travelogue (""We're running through the aisles/ Of the churches still in style""), but the [#script:http://pitchfork.com/media/backend/js/tiny_mce/themes/advanced/langs/en.js]|||||| band still comes off like they're living the dream-- "" [#script:http://pitchfork.com/media/backend/js/tiny_mce/themes/advanced/langs/en.js]|||||| And even though I can't be sure/ Memory tells me that these times are worth working for.""  ""Airplanes"" is a tribute to one of the bandmember's pilot grandfather, and while the counterpoints of strings and piano are buoyant enough it's the evocative images (chopsticks from his time spent in Japan, a well-thumbed encyclopedia) that indicate his life was well-lived. But even where the lyrics get more obtuse (a Skype exchange with an ex is likened to a ""Cubism Dream""), there's almost always a strong pulse running through the busy, precise compositions: ""Shape Shifter"", for example, is about impressionistic themes of self-reckoning but the sentiment is also reflected in the song's arrangement. At certain points, it's Gorilla Manor's sludgiest track; at others, it's the most quicksilver and agile. The strings and harmonies of the glacial ""Cards & Quarters"" and ""Who Knows, Who Cares?"" are gorgeous, but drum rolls and washes of cymbal hint at imminent collapse. Only closer ""Sticky Thread"" offers calm. So while the record's second half dials back the tempo, stuck in its midsection is a cover of the Talking Heads, hardly a band that would be considered ""loose."" ""Warning Sign"" isn't the most canonical of their songs, but taking it on is an audacious decision for a band that would be wise to let the comparisons come to them first. They retain the elasticity of the bassline and the general verse-chorus structure, but that's about it: David Byrne's pinprick vocals are treated with melodic contour and supple harmonies, the breakdown veers from nervous to joyfully emphatic, and the guitars soften around the edges. Whether it's ""better"" than the original is besides the point-- at least for four minutes, Local Natives take ownership of it, fully integrating what might have been an incompatible hard left turn into the record's seamless whole. True, we tend to bow at novelty and innovation, but Gorilla Manor proves to be a refreshing reminder of the pleasures of synthesis.","Local Natives have a familiar sound-- rustic vocals, harmonies, clattering percussion-- but songwriting skill and youthful energy mark their striking debut.

Playtime,Reagenz,by: Andrew Gaerig,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a82dea9e61561daa5767/1:1/w_160/7fe23097.jpg,2010-02-12 06:00:04,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13902-playtime/,Workshop,"Reagenz's Playtime is a collaboration between resurgent house producer Move D (David Moufang) and Spacetime Continuum's Jonah Sharp. One of a spate of late-2009 electronic records to get caught up in the end-of-year wash (see also: Redshape's The Dance Paradox), Playtime caps an impressive year for Germany's Workshop label with a no-seams mix of gliding house music and ambient composition. This is Moufang's second fruitful collaboration in as many years-- 2008's Benjamin Brunn collaboration, *Songs From the Beehive, *offered bright, brainy techno-- and it's logical to ascribe most of Playtime's success to him (Sharp has been mostly silent since the mid-1990s). Although the duo met at an Autechre show, drawing connections to that band is a red herring: Playtime sits lightly and never intentionally perturbs. Its 80 minutes race by as the duo balances dense, low-tension keyboard epics with graceful, urban-gray mood pieces. The record opens with ""Dinner With Q"", a playful disco thrum that features a classic juking bassline and splashes of guitar. Over the course of 13 minutes, Moufang stretches his legs into spacey arpeggios and a beatless, acoustic interlude as the track careens toward the sort of athletic house music that appeared on his mid-90s classic Kunststoff. The comparatively short ""Shibuya Day"" cools the heat that ""Dinner With Q"" and the lounge-y ""DJ Friendly"" generate, drifting lightly until a careful beat inches in. ""Confidence"" earns its name; ""Keep Building"" is traditionally polemic house music, with Black Jazz Consortium's Fred P providing husky mantras that never get too pushy (""You just gotta keep moving forward... one step at a time""). ""Freerotation"" is perhaps the album's one misfire, five minutes of echoing patter that mainly serves as an intro for Playtime's behemoth closer. Swallowing the album's final 24 minutes, ""Du Bist Hier!"" (""You Are Here!"") never seems its length as its heartbeat rhythm trolls through decaying keyboards. It isn't novelty that carries Playtime-- plenty of ""deep house"" toes the line between ambient and dance music-- but rather execution. After a decade of mostly lauded house production, Moufang has spent the last two years choosing collaborators to help him stretch his melodies until they're soft and threadbare. Playtime is comfortable and lived-in, a veteran's work than never tires or lapses into old habits.","Collaboration between house producer Move D and Spacetime Continuum's Jonah Sharp is a no-seams mix of gliding house music and ambient composition.

The Amazing,The Amazing,by: Joshua Love,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a8175e6ef95969321127/1:1/w_160/033b053b.jpg,2010-02-12 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13882-the-amazing/,Subliminal Sounds,"Despite sharing two members (three if you count jack-of-all-trades contributor Frederik Swahn), the Amazing and Dungen don't sound overly similar. In the quickest, dirtiest sense, the Amazing trade Dungen singer and sole songwriter Gustav Ejstes for former Granada frontman Christoffer Gunrup, and where Ejstes sings entirely in Swedish, Gunrup opts for English. The two men don't share all of the same influences (though they do share some), and that's where the groups diverge, because if there's one thing Ejstes and Gunrup have in common, it's a keen faithfulness to their particular sources of inspiration. The Amazing's reference points aren't nearly as broad as Dungen's, but each project succeeds by reproducing vintage sounds so lovingly and masterfully that a lack of originality ceases to matter. Most people first caught wind of the Amazing late last year via the wonderfully lissome single ""Dragon"", the majority of which is given over to misty, moody acoustic folk rumination in the vein of Nick Drake. Almost half of the album explicitly mines this same terrain. The achingly sensitive, fingerpicked fragilities ""Beach House"", ""Is It Likely"", and ""The Strangest Thing"" may skirt the line that keeps out soggily simplistic pushovers like Damien Rice and David Gray, but Gunrup's alluring lyrics and the sheer loveliness of the instrumentation ensure they stay on the non-douchey side of the divide. The element of ""Dragon"" that leaps out on first listen is its beautifully fluid twin-guitar refrain that evokes the easy-bake grooves of the Allman Brothers Band and the Grateful Dead. This sun-dappled style crops up again at various points on the album, and, in a more general sense, the parts of the record that don't find Gunrup conjuring up Drake's pink moons and northern skies instead see the band exploring various permutations of stoner-friendly rock. Opener ""The Kirwan Song"" features a sublime interpolation of Fleetwood Mac's ""Sunny Side of Heaven"", penned by the eponymous Danny Kirwan and recorded just as the Mac were transitioning from jam-friendly blues-rock to soft-focus pop. Fittingly, Gunrup and co. take Kirwan's original, intimate instrumental and blow it up to stadium size, complete with thunderous drum rolls from Dungen kitmaster Johan Holmegard. That's just a warm-up for the massive, molten ""Code II"", a roiling monolith of wicked, doomy guitar shards and more skull-rattling drumming. The hazy, heavily treated ""Dead"" could pass for mid-period Flaming Lips, but it's on the penultimate ""Had to Keep Walking"" that the Amazing really kick into interstellar overdrive. As the song cycles through a cerebral, ruminative groove, it touches on post-rock before melting into a keyboard-laden head trip ripped straight from the Tangerine Dream and Pink Floyd playbooks. As far-flung as Dungen may be, they're clearly not going to be able to exhaust every avenue of album-era revivalism all by themselves.","Sharing members with Dungen, this Swedish group alternates between moody acoustic folk rumination and various permutations of stoner-friendly rock.

North/South/East/West,Various Artists,by: Nate Patrin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a8309d034d5c69bf39a3/1:1/w_160/e6efeb93.jpg,2010-02-12 06:00:02,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13904-northsoutheastwest/,Bleep,"As far as names for musical niches go, few are as stylistically far-flung-- and unhelpfully imprecise-- as ""wonky."" Flying Lotus isn't really dubstep, and Rustie isn't quite hip-hop, but they're both wonky-- which, as Martin Clark observed a couple of years back, initially emerged as more of a theme than a genre. That theme unites so many veins of inspiration that a closer look at the sound reveals things either uniquely specific (Glasgow's ""aquacrunk"" scene) or so descriptively wide-- Philadelphia's Starkey calls his music ""street bass""-- that they're no more helpful. So wonky is one of those know-it-when-you-hear-it things, a digital pulse of unstable time signatures that aims to unite the sonic commonalities between hip-hop, dubstep, electro, UK funky, IDM, and any other potential source of those synthesized basslines' shared DNA. Gathering them all up into one place for an attempted overview is the kind of project that risks becoming both illuminating and confusing. North/South/East/West was originally meant to be a collaborative art/music project between photographer Shaun Bloodworth and designer Stuart Hammersley, who initially intended to highlight a few artists from the London dubstep world for Warp subsidiary Bleep.com. It was after they took a similar project to Los Angeles' beat-music underground that they decided to tie the two scenes together, and throw in two others-- Glasgow and New York-- to complete a sort of four-corners wonky overview. The final product mostly adheres to a certain intangible sense of style without actually sounding like its artists are all following the same route. The UK's North/South axis of the collection shares the most common musical background; most of these artists can trace a direct lineage to UK garage, whether it's through grime, dubstep, or UK funky. The London and Bristol artists that were the project's initial focus include two early catalysts of post-garage dance niches, with dubstep innovator Skream providing the brooding, kick-heavy throb of ""Slumfunk"" and UK funky curator Geeneus contributing the vintage Detroit inflections of ""Ultrafunkula"". Their commonalities are in the fine details (foamy low-end; a certain glowing cast to the synth sounds) rather than the bigger rhythmic picture, which is why Headhunter's ""Collecting Butterflies""-- combining uptempo, borderline-rave synth and snare with a growling mid-tempo bassline-- is a good selection to tie the two together. Glasgow, meanwhile, is represented by the aforementioned ""aquacrunk"" variant popularized by Rustie, whose ""Bad Science"" takes Southern-bounce to a hyperactive extreme. Given the other two slices of the Glasgow scene on display-- the night-ending dubstep swoon of Taz Buckfaster's elegaic ""Au Revoir"", and Hudson Mohawke's handclap-driven, cathedral-sized ""FUSE"", the most anthemic track on the comp-- it's the closest there is to an easy stylistic convergence. Things get more spread out and fractured where the American coasts are concerned, and the only real commonality that the New York and L.A. artists hold is a general sense that they owe a bit more to left-field breakbeat and jazz. The musicians that represent NYC here find a lot of elbow room in that particular area, even as they all have the same tendency to cultivate similar post-hip-hop atmosphere. Kotchy's ""You Know You"" extrapolates a strange sort of mournful soul-jazz out of a boom-bap rhythm and lets it flutter in and out of space, switching up between cocktail-bar piano and distorted 80s funk synthesizers to disorienting effect. Mike Slott's ""When Giants Meet"" is an escalating series of sharp detours-- truncated riffs, quick blasts of notes, melodies that travel in and out of frame-- over a fidgety drumbeat. Next to those two, FaltyDL's mid-tempo acid-jazz electric piano meditation ""Some Day My Queen Will Come"" sounds like an outtake from a mid-90s Mo Wax comp. Ironically, even though Bloodworth and Hammersley's visit to L.A. sparked the multi-city nature of North/South/East/West, that scene feels like the most loosely represented. Nothing really unites the two Flying Lotus tracks (the brief but impactful demi-Asian g-funk of L.A. EP cut ""Rickshaw"" and Matthew David's soupy, beatless ambient reworking of ""Comet Course"") with the quirky, baroque contribution by Daedelus (""A Bloodworth""). And given how sprawling and creatively active the Brainfeeder collective is-- it's the same scene that gave us next-level beat futurists like Nosaj Thing, the Gaslamp Killer, and Ras_G-- the West-representing side of this comp feels like surface-scraping in comparison. As a collection of tracks, North/South/East/West is a solid effort with plenty of highlights, and even with the stylistic divergence it doesn't throw listeners off too much, opting to sequence for mood rather than regional affinity. As an art project, it certainly looks nice-- the photographs and visual design of the limited-edition package rope together an evocative visual aesthetic that complements the music's mood of darkness without bleakness. (The limited-edition CD is a fancy-packaged art piece; more casual listeners will likely settle for the digital download, which includes individual artwork with each music file.) And as a summary of a multi-fronted hydra of a scene, it does as well as can be expected-- whether it's a genre or just a theme, the fact that it can be alluring in so many different ways, none of which have been mined to the point of cliché, should be enough to forgive the sprawl.","Warp gathers top artists from four locales-- NYC, L.A., London, and Glasgow-- to create an all-star wonky album featuring FlyLo, Skream, FaltyDL, and more.

Renihilation,Liturgy,by: Grayson Currin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a83ac0084474cd0c0da4/1:1/w_160/d2da0908.jpg,2010-02-12 06:00:01,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13915-renihilation/,20 Buck Spin,"Note the words ""Ecstatic Rite"", the title of the fifth track on Renihilation, the debut LP from Brooklyn black metal band Liturgy. With its nihilism and necromancy, its demons and doom, heavy metal-- especially this strain-- is most often tagged for its dark, grim obsessions, not its celebration. Liturgy, at a glance, might not seem much different: Frontman Hunter Hunt-Hendrix writes about meaninglessness, disaster, and apocalypse in terse, declarative terms, and the band's guitar waves and drum cascades sometimes suggest suffocation. But crank Renihilation again, and notice the way Greg Fox rebuilds his beats when the band relents-- how hard he slaps those cymbals, how he slowly fills the spaces in his own meter, especially during the backend of ""Pagan Dawn"". Or listen to the intensity of ""Arctica""-- the triumphant guitar introduction, the thunderous way the drums roll into it, the sudden stops and stronger restarts. It feels, conveniently enough, ecstatic, the sound of four ""Brooklyn hipsters"" (as some super kvlt Internet analysts have derided) who go by their given names, wear street clothes, and avoid corpse paint treating extreme metal with the élan of a ripe young garage rock band or a focused noise artist. However harsh the words and however heavy the music, Liturgy have fun with their chosen form-- playing ferociously, writing imaginatively, and, in the process, making a record that reveres black metal's legacy while, at its best, pushes it forward. For, you know, Brooklyn hipsters, the quartet supplies convincing power and precision. They play hard, fast, and with stamina, storming through these seven three-to-five-minute tracks and using only four interludes (always some combination of guitars, electronics and overtone singing) for rest. But it's not all bustle and blaze. There's lot of space in these tracks, so that even the most tumultuous tunes offer surprising detours. That's actually where Liturgy are the most compositionally interesting. On ""Mysterium"", for instance, Fox overruns his own frenetic clip, drumming so quickly that all he can do is start and stop again. Each time this happens, Liturgy pause on sharp, dissonant notes, maintaining a pins-and-needles suspense rather than resolving the drama. Liturgy cites minimalist composers La Monte Young and Glenn Branca and Pakistani singer Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan as influences. The record's interludes are obvious homages to those outsiders, but so are these moments, when Liturgy reinforce the tension with choices that run counter to rock'n'roll impulses. The possibilities are infinite and largely unexplored. Indeed, one of Renihilation's most appealing aspects is what isn't here: From the dissonant guitar shards anchoring the pauses on ""Arctica"" to the mix of chants and electronics serving as interludes between tracks, Liturgy deliver a stream of ideas that seem like strands for continued exploration and synthesis. It's a captivating listen in its own right, but mostly Renihilation establishes the band's bona fides. Yeah, maybe they're art kids or the sons of classical music critics, but Fox destroys on the drums, and Hunt-Hendrix suffers for his words when he howls. He and Bernard Gann comprise an interesting guitar pair, too, as comfortable marching along the same serrated path as they are spiraling around each other in riffs and counters. Bassist Tyler Dusenbury mostly stays out of the way. Renihilation suggests that Liturgy are more certain of possibilities than, at this point, their ability to achieve them. That is, despite a frontman who roars, ""being shall become the eternal return of fire,"" during a song in which he depicts the modern world crumbling in a natural blaze, the aggressive ecstasy of Renihilation promises an exciting future-- for Liturgy, and for us.","These ""Brooklyn hipsters"" treat extreme metal with the élan of a ripe young garage rock band or a focused noise artist.

Soldier of Love,Sade,by: Jess Harvell,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a8405e6ef95969321179/1:1/w_160/c819bd52.jpg,2010-02-12 06:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13920-soldier-of-love/,Sony,"""Inimitable"" isn't the first word that comes to mind when discussing Sade, but it's next to impossible to name another millions-selling pop act that sounds anything like them. (And, yes, Sade are a band.) In the mid-1980s, before hip-hop and R&B became inexplicably twinned, the band helped to define the quiet storm era, when smooth grooves aimed at grown-ups were still a legitimate mainstream phenomenon. In 2010, Sade seems wholly unique. Music this tasteful and even-keeled can be wearying in large doses, and when the radio was chock full of impossibly slick Vandross-alikes, it was easy to take Sade for granted. But the new Soldier of Love feels soothing after a few hours spent in the company of Ke$ha and Lady Gaga. Soldier of Love offers listeners a rather narrow range of interest-- songs that (at their best) suggest strong feeling restrained by a fierce dignity-- but Sade remain the best at what they do. And so Soldier of Love is unsurprisingly of a piece with the five previous Sade albums. Songwriting-wise, it could have been released at any point in the band's career. The production only occasionally draws attention to itself-- the dub-esque snare crashes on ""Babyfather"" are a bit of a surprise-- and you can forget any gauche stabs at currently hip sonic tricks. The idea of singer Sade Adu robo-warbling through Auto-Tune would be laughable if it weren't impossible even to conceive. Even the album's curveball first single, title track ""Soldier of Love"", with its strident marching band snare rolls, doesn't so much deviate from Sade's core sound as cast it in a new light: What better to emphasize Adu's sense of control than a rhythm with the stiffly regimented forward momentum of a parade ground drill? And if ""Soldier of Love"" seems ""hard,"" it's only because the surrounding tunes are once again delicate to the point where nuance is all. The music often gets the short shrift when discussing Sade, because the band is so purposefully unobtrusive. Theirs isn't the kind of minimalism designed to draw attention to itself, merely to capture a mood (usually longing or the gentlest of joy) in as few moves as possible. It's a tricky thing to praise, the kind of competency that's always just a few steps from blandness. Musically, Soldier of Love has plenty of deft touches, like the way ""Morning Bird"" suggests desolation with a piano motif paired back to as few notes as possible. The band knows its job is to provide as unfussy a backdrop for its singer as possible. And Adu is one of the odder candidates for modern soul-singer canonization. While she's got one of the warmest tones in modern pop, she'll never, ever lose herself in the moment, let her voice run wild. She always seems to be pulling her emotional punches. So if your interest in modern R&B is limited to dance music-- that lineage that runs from new jack swing through Timbaland and beyond-- you may be surprised to learn that the heartbeat-steady ""Skin"" is what Sade calls ecstasy. But Adu's voice has to be one of the most calming sounds on planet Earth. Not for everyone, or every mood, but perfect for working out the kinks caused by pop's mile-a-minute barrage of capital-p Pleasure. That unwavering sense of understatement has also left Sade strangely underrated, especially by listeners who get antsy when an act makes a virtue of restraint. For decades, pop fans have been mistaking reserve for repression, and composure for lack of soul. In 2010, though, things seem to be changing, at least a little. Describing something as ""smooth"" no longer sets off the same alarms for younger listeners, or younger critics. And Sade's Soldier of Love is kind of a litmus test in that regard. Sade hasn't changed, and Soldier of Love will likely be the year's most relaxing album. But will listeners reared to expect the immediate gratification of rock or rap go for music that hovers tremulously on the edge of both pleasure and pain?","The classic soft-rock band returns with its first album in a decade, and it still seems wholly unique and oddly captivating.

Casual Victim Pile,Various Artists,by: David Raposa,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a83f9d034d5c69bf39cb/1:1/w_160/4a7ac6a6.jpg,2010-02-11 06:00:04,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13919-casual-victim-pile/,Matador,"Casual Victim Pile is a compilation assembled by Matador Records co-leader Gerard Cosloy highlighting his favorite Austin-area bands of the past few years. Cosloy had no designs on this being the definitive document of the Austin music scene, and he'll eagerly cop to that. The ways and means might have changed, but the impulses that inspired Cosloy to throw together Casual Victim Pile are the same impulses behind Bands That Could Be God, a compilation of Boston-area bands he co-released in 1984: an unabashed love of music, and an interest in getting that music heard. If this compilation is making any sort of definitive statement, it's Cosloy's influence on the Amerindie underground over the past 20-plus years. Aside from a couple of tracks (most notably the Distant Seconds' ""Akron Bureau"", a decent enough tune that is nevertheless a little too fond of Spoon), most of Pile sounds like music that could've been found on a Homestead Records compilation circa 1987. Even the compilation's anagramatic title-- its built around Austin's nickname, ""live music capital""-- has a certain punk-just-died terseness and clarity to it. Yet the music on Pile doesn't sound stodgy or dated; it's instead a testament to the continued creative viability of that nebulous yet unmistakable classic indie rock sound. As Cosloy notes in the AV Club interview linked above, there's plenty of aesthetic wiggle room between bands on this album. But while the Wipers-esque tremors of Dikes of Holland's ""Little City Girl"" doesn't share much in common sonically with the pure hardcore of the Teeners' ""Nazis on Film"", the bassy reverb of the Young's ""Blister"", or charming, shambling twerpiness of Harlem's ""Beautiful and Very Smart"", their engines are all fueled by a similar fire. The quality of Pile rarely wavers, though front-to-back listeners will encounter brief stretches of catchy straightforward punk or punk-like tunes that might encourage some skipping. Those with a hankering for some cavernous swampy post-punk can cue up ELVIS' ""Mommy's Little Soldiers"" or the appropriately titled ""Spirits Roam"" by Woven Bones. With ""The Engineer"", Tre Orsi offers something akin to a kinder, gentler Unwound, while Wild America rocks out in a feeling-Minnesota (by way of Buffalo Tom) fashion. There are plenty of guitar-rock wrinkles to be found all over this comp, but if you're looking for the best Pile has to offer, the album graciously gives listeners that right at the start. Follow That Bird!'s ""The Ghosts That Wake You"" is a propulsive and wiry tune that's agile enough to shift gears gracefully and has its shows of musical force ably abetted by Lauren Green's unfettered belting. It makes the sort of first impression that quickly leads to a second and third one, and hopefully a quick web search to purchase some of the group's offerings. That said, if you simply stop with this lead-off track without exploring Casual Victim Pile further, you're doing yourself, and this compilation, a grave disservice.","Matador boss Gerard Cosloy curates a compilation highlighting his favorite Austin-area bands of the past few years.

Frictionalism 1994-2009,"Anthony ""Shake"" Shakir",by: Andrew Gaerig,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a839ea9e61561daa5785/1:1/w_160/c2f80712.jpg,2010-02-11 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13914-frictionalism-1994-2009/,Rush Hour,"Anthony ""Shake"" Shakir is a longtime techno producer from Detroit. His first track, ""Sequence 10"", was featured on Virgin's seminal Techno: The New Dance Sound of Detroit in 1988. You can draw short, uninterrupted lines between Shakir and any of the first- (Juan Atkins, Kevin Saunderson, Derrick May) or second-wave (Underground Resistance, Carl Craig) Detroit techno acts. Yet his hometown, chosen genre, and general demeanor-- much of Shakir's work has come out on his own Frictional label; he refused to promote his work in European markets, although they embraced many of his contemporaries-- have boxed Shakir into obscurity. Frictionalism 1994-2009, a 3xCD, 35-track retrospective on Rush Hour Recordings (an abbreviated, 4x12"" vinyl set of the same name appeared late last year), places many of Shakir's records on CD for the first time and sheds light on one of Detroit techno's great, unclaimed dance artists. At his best, Shakir is a hypnotic producer, spools of psychedelic noise whipping off his tightly coiled beats. A noted pop fan-- he's notoriously unafraid of playing pop music in his DJ sets, and he once sampled the B-52's-- the tracks on Frictionalism rarely betray their samples, yet they also avoid slipping into noise or ambience. Tracks could function on the floor, but they don't always feel as if they were constructed for that purpose. This is fitting. In interviews Shakir comes off as an introspective ball of contradictions; it is difficult to imagine him attending many club nights. Within a group of musicians already notoriously peeved about a lack of respect, Shakir seems particularly upset, referring to himself as the ""invisible man of techno."" But Shakir is also self-deprecating and aware: He frequently referred to himself as the janitor of Juan Atkins' Metroplex Records; he now admits that much of his invisibility is his own doing. Frictionalism is spry and elegant throughout, notable from a scene whose progenitors were both establishing a new genre and learning to use their instruments. ""Stereotype""'s slowly gathering strings and ""Arise""'s alien synthesizers sound deluxe and deeply musical. ""Roaming"" contains a bobbing jazz bassline; ""Simpatico"" is a keyboard-helmed house jam that is modest and self-contained. Frictionalism spreads out over three and a half hours but it contains few anthems and fewer indulgences, Shakir preferring instead to provide to just lay in the grooves of his regenerating hop. Shakir is known for incorporating hip-hop into his productions, and while the vast majority of Frictionalism exists on the techno axis, it'd be easy to see J Dilla latch onto the symphonic jazz of ""Detroit State of Mind"" or Madlib onto the smoky Eastern funk of the spectacularly titled ""Things Come and Go"". Influence is a strange concept with an artist like Shakir, though. He produced formative work during a formative period, but his records have long been out of print, and ascribing any real guidance to his work requires a lot of faith in the record collections of his offspring. Did Kieran Hebden ever run across the Four Tet-y ""Tracks for My Father"" 12""? Does it matter if he didn't? Shakir is at a crossroads. Earlier this decade he was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis; he attributed a years-long recording layoff to purchasing the wrong recording software for his laptop. But last year's Levitate Venice EP was received with reverence and acclaim; Frictionalism makes his work available in a way it has never been (Shakir chose Rush Hour specifically for their European distribution capabilities). Shakir fondly compares techno producers with jazz musicians for their ability to extend their creative lives. Frictionalism gives him the opportunity to continue in front of an audience, but it also exposes an already rewarding creative life that deserves more company.","This 3xCD, 35-track retrospective places many tracks on CD for the first time and sheds light on one of Detroit techno's great, unclaimed dance artists.

The Calcination of Scout Niblett,Scout Niblett,by: Matthew Perpetua,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a83cea9e61561daa5788/1:1/w_160/0c5b79b5.jpg,2010-02-11 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13916-the-calcination-of-scout-niblett/,Drag City,"Let us save you the trouble of checking an online dictionary: Calcination is the first stage of alchemy, and it essentially means ""purification by fire."" It is tied in with astrology, and in those terms, it's basically a humbling process that spurs the introspection and self-evaluation necessary for transformative growth. With that in mind, the title of Scout Niblett's sixth album is rather appropriate. She truly sounds like a woman willing to suffer through anything, to burn away what doesn't work, in order to gain strength and wisdom. Her music has always been lonely, introverted, and anguished, but the stakes seem much higher on this album, like it's a do-or-die scenario. To some extent, listening to The Calcination of Scout Niblett is more like bearing witness to a ritual. Even if the music is often arresting and engaging, it's not for us so much as something Niblett obviously needs to do for herself. This is a very uncompromising work of art, to say the least. Scout Niblett is a woman who takes astrology and alchemy very seriously, and over the course of her career, these themes have become central to her songwriting. I realize that may sound kinda crackpot and off-putting, but it's important to note that you really don't need to be as invested as she is in those ideas to get something out of this music. This isn't dense, overly mystical nonsense. Niblett draws on these archetypes and iconography for their metaphorical value, and she consistently places the emphasis in the songs on anticipation and catharsis. Her compositions typically alternate between a heavily distorted thud and brittle, minimal passages that serve as lulls. Percussion comes and goes, and some of the loudest moments are without the clatter of drums, resulting in an eerie, hollow noise. On a surface level, this music can resemble PJ Harvey on Rid of Me or Nirvana on In Utero, both of which were also engineered by Niblett's collaborator Steve Albini. The substance is closer to Cat Power's Moon Pix and the early albums by the reclusive songwriter Jandek. Like them, Niblett has a way of making you hang on her every note, and making her guitar strings sound like some kind of fragile tether to sanity. Her voice is expressive and raw, shifting between wounded soulfulness and unhinged fury. Her songs are not uninviting, and tracks like ""I.B.D."" and ""Duke of Anxiety"" have strong, memorable melodic hooks, but the starkness and intensity of it all makes for a very difficult and challenging record. However, on the occasions when the music connects, it is mesmerizing and uncanny whether you are directly relating to her or having a more voyeuristic experience. The extreme intimacy implied by the recording is both fascinating and uncomfortable, but that isn't necessarily a complaint. This is an excellent document and a successful expression of something that is clearly personal to the artist. Our comfort level and patience is beside the point, but not unimportant. Niblett's music is very much an acquired taste, and there are few ways to enjoy this other than on her terms. She's not oblivious to this, and she has a sense of humor about it. The black and white photograph on the cover is a sly, on-the-nose bit of dark comedy: She's standing there waving and smiling at us as she holds up a welding torch, presumably about to set herself on fire. It's her odd little way of welcoming an audience to what she describes on the title track as her ""self-made sweat box."" It's grim and indulgent, but not lacking in style and wit.","Niblett's music has always been lonely, introverted, and anguished, but the stakes seem much higher on this album, like it's a do-or-die scenario.

Periphery,The Seven Fields Of Aphelion,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a81cea9e61561daa573d/1:1/w_160/3d8483df.jpg,2010-02-11 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13886-periphery/,Graveface,"Pittsburgh's Black Moth Super Rainbow make thick, sticky sounds that flirt with contradiction: Naturalism through technology. Judging from the surplus of overdriven machine noise in which their hippie-folk tunes are mired, you'd think the trees in Pittsburgh came equipped with electrical outlets. They insist on texture over definition, and as a consequence, their albums invariably sound warm, inviting, and homogenous. With Periphery, the third solo release by a member of the band (Maux Boyle), you begin to suspect that the tendency to favor timbre over songwriting is a function of the band's dynamic, and not the inclination of the individual members. Tobacco's Fucked Up Friends, a largely instrumental hip-hop record released on Anticon, retained BMSR's shaggy atmosphere, but drew it into focus with spirited beats. As the Seven Fields of Aphelion, Boyle strikes a similar bargain between her main group's fetish for analog unpredictability and a more precise method of composition. Working with synthesizer and lightly treated piano, she has produced an album of more comprehensible sounds, which seems plainly indebted to certain Eno collaborations-- with Harold Budd, on the piano-led numbers, and with Robert Fripp on the synth-led ones. There is, however, some pussyfooting. The sounds here are almost too comprehensible, and at times, deployed too tentatively. Music that treads the ambient/new age line can't stint on mystery, and these tracks, while always very pretty, can feel too obvious to draw us below the surface. On ""Slow Subtraction"", we hear some reversed synth hums and delayed piano keys-- there's never a ""Wow, what am I hearing?"" moment. A big challenge for this kind of music is to make soothing sounds we've heard many times interesting. Across this album, mostly stock tricks are deployed: chimes and drones on ""Pale Prophecy"", detuned wobbles on ""Cloud Forest (The Little Owl)"", gradually encroaching static on ""Saturation: Arrhythmia"". These effects feel moderately effective yet entirely familiar. Even though the building blocks are well-known, Boyle often manages to animate them persuasively and creatively. The bass that sweeps through ""Slow Subtraction"" has a grand upward shift, and ""Grown"" gets exciting when spacey synthesizers come corkscrewing out of the piano line. In fact, the record is almost always more attractive when Boyle lets her synths do more than sculpt the background, like on ""Mountain Mary"" and ""Michigan Icarus"", where they disrupt the linear slog with a sense of height and freedom. Periphery has all the right moves in place to deliver a pleasurable experience, and it delivers one: I'll certainly break this album out once in awhile. But it's missing an intangible quality-- the depth of Budd/Eno's The Pearl, or the force of Fripp/Eno's Evening Star-- that makes the best ambient music outstrip its scanty means.","On her debut LP, Black Moth Super Rainbow member Maux Boyle crafts ambient music using synthesizers and lightly treated piano.

Odd Blood,Yeasayer,by: Scott Plagenhoef,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a8429d034d5c69bf39d4/1:1/w_160/1c98fac7.jpg,2010-02-11 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13922-odd-blood/,Secretly Canadian,"When Yeasayer debuted in 2007 with All Hour Cymbals, they were a Brooklyn art-pop group intriguingly out of step with their peers. They carried an air of mystery and surprise, and at their best (""2080"", ""Sunrise"") managed to make offbeat mysticism and off-kilter pop music seem attractive and exciting. They were basically a rootsy, classic rock-ish version of MGMT then. Their fate seemed doubly sealed by ""Tightrope"", their laser-focused and damn near best-in-show contribution to the all-star charity compilation Dark Was the Night. Then they arguably topped that with ""Ambling Alp"", the pre-release single to sophomore album Odd Blood. ""Alp"" managed to retain the leftfield bona fides within an easy-to-love glassy pop sheen. That duality extended to the lyrics as well: The song is about infamous Italian boxer Primo Carnera, but in the chorus Chris Keating sang the kind of wholesome fatherly advice you might hear in a Shrek montage. Like ""Ambling Alp"", Odd Blood itself should appeal to a lot of people: Yeasayer have made a potentially vanguard record using the full range of possibilities of software-based music to create what once would have been radio-friendly rock. The elastic ""O.N.E."" and the Tears for Fears-ish ""I Remember"" are successful mid-80s throwbacks, achieving the full potential hinted at on All Hour Cymbals and rivaling that album's best material. Opener ""The Children"" also works by tailoring their offbeat tendencies into a tightly packaged song. In much of the first half of the album, Yeasayer demonstrate a rare craftsmanship and consideration that's too often shoved under the rug in modern indie music. Their lyrics may not say much of anything, but their agile arrangements, sense of dynamics and pacing, and singer Chris Keating's expressive vocals communicate plenty. The rest of the album suffers from a major identity crisis-- few of the various far-flung ideas it explores pan out, and most of them wind up overcooked. On the whole, the record alternates between a prog-rock version of 80s UK synth-pop (and those are the good songs) and dreadlocky alt-pop or yuppie-era world music imitations (aaaand... those are the bad ones). Songs like ""Rome"" or ""Love Me Girl"" aim for ambitious sprawl but just wind up muddy, while the ballads ""Strange Reunions"" and ""Grizelda"" seem plodding and congested. The more in need of editing the music gets, the weaker the lyrics become: ""Mondegreen"" is the worst offender, with Keating chanting ""Everybody's talking about me and my baby makin' love 'til the morning light"" ad nauseum over shamanistic electro-boogie. (But you knew that-- I mean, everybody's talking about it.) Of course, Yeasayer aren't going anywhere: quality singles, inventive videos, and solid live performances go far. But it's hard to miss the pressure the band was under to deliver here-- it's nearly palpable in their overfed production and search for direction, and as a result, Odd Blood is a bit too much of not enough. I went back and listened to ""Tightrope"" again. It remains charming, human, and assured, winning your affection instead of trying to earn your respect. When Odd Blood succeeds, it does the same, but when it fails, it fails badly.","A tighter, slicker, poppier sophomore album tries on every imaginable sound and style-- but none is as original or effective as the one they started with.

Interference,Interference,by: Marc Masters,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a835ea9e61561daa5778/1:1/w_160/4d9de0de.jpg,2010-02-10 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13909-interference/,Social Registry,"No Wave's flameout seemed to happen by design. Flashing through late-1970s New York, the movement came off as a nihilistic plot to first dismantle punk rock, then abandon it. The funny thing is, the perpetrators didn't exactly run off and hide. Before the dust had settled, many No Wavers were already reworking their ideas into new forms that actually lasted longer than the original spark. Some, like Glenn Branca and Rhys Chatham, morphed rock experiments into avant-garde minimalism, which in turn spawned the noise-rock of Swans and Sonic Youth. Others, like James Chance and Pat Place of the Contortions, created disco-damaged punk-funk that led to the stripped-down dance of ESG and Liquid Liquid. Though those two post-No Wave trends shared some participants, there was a vague line between them. To oversimplify, one side was rock, the other dance. It turns out that at least one band, Interference, straddled that divide. But their innovations were hidden, because their only recording-- a 1982 debut slated for release on Branca's Neutral label-- never came out. Now Social Registry has rescued it from the vaults (though Branca claims that this version is different than what the band gave Neutral). The six original songs on the first half of this 2xLP set sound like a missing link between Branca's pioneering symphonies and ESG's seminal funk. The former style was something in which Interference were clearly versed-- drummer David Linton and bassist Michael Brown both played in Chatham's ensemble the Din, while multi-instrumentalist Anne DeMarinis was in the first incarnation of Sonic Youth. Still, Interference must have been equally attentive to the downtown dance-rock developing in the early 80s. The band's blend of chiming guitars, rattling rhythms, dark bass grooves, and cresting noise feels less like a stylistic hybrid than an organic swirl of body-moving thought and head-bobbing momentum. That comes across strongest on the two densest tracks-- ""Excerpt #1 (Version 2)"", which at times sounds like an extended instrumental take on Bush Tetras' downtown classic ""Too Many Creeps"", and ""Contempt"", a snaky grove that evokes the nervous energy of DNA or the Feelies, but whose insistent beat feels timeless. Things tip further to the avant-rock side on closer ""Number Four"". Its frantic rush recalls the slam-rock symphonics of Chatham's ""Drastic Classicism"" (a song Linton and Brown actually played on). But even that track feels remarkably fresh, like something you wouldn't be surprised to hear blasting from a Magik Markers or Talk Normal album. That timelessness makes the second half of Interference-- a bonus LP with six new remixes-- more than just tacked-on filler. Linton has been involved in the New York avant-electronic scene for a while, and his choice of remixers is sharp. All of them rework a funkier version of ""Excerpt #1"" (the original of which Social Registry offers as a bonus digital download). I'm partial to the QPE ""#5 Dub"", which matches Brown's thick bass line to a detached hip-hop lope, and Criterion's ""Interferix"", a marriage of hard beats and warpy echo. But all six remixes show the richness of Interference's music, which after nearly three decades of hidden fermentation sounds as vital as it must have to anyone who witnessed it back then.","This lost act recorded unreleased music for Glenn Branca's label that split the difference between Swans and ESG.

Aufgang,Aufgang,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a811b1335d7bf16991be/1:1/w_160/5429ab78.jpg,2010-02-10 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13875-aufgang/,DiscographInfiné,"If you've ever listened to Bach's Goldberg Variations and thought, ""Pretty cool; could use some hot beats,"" then you're going to love Aufgang. They blend pianos, live drums, and techno-inspired electronics into invigorating displays of virtuosity, which evoke the club and the conservatory without really belonging to either one. (Their name is German for ""stairway""-- an intermediate place, neither here nor there.) Given to singing out ecstatically, Aufgang's self-titled debut highlights the emotional extravagance these two different worlds have in common. It sounds kind of posh on paper, but it's actually really buoyant and fun. It always makes me picture an anthropomorphic grand piano in an old Warner Bros. cartoon, bouncing on rubbery legs to its own irrepressible music. We're not talking about indie rockers pasting a few major thirds and fifths onto a preset. This is serious piano playing. Rami Khalifé and Francesco Tristano both trained at Julliard. Khalifé is the son of Lebanese composer Marcel Khalifé, and Tristano is well-regarded for his recorded repertoire (which includes The Goldberg Variations, in fact). Drummer Aymeric Westrich contributes a lively yet understated attack, somewhere between the four-on-the-floor throbs of house and rock music. Aufgang's dual education, in the nightclub and the academy, shows in the historical and stylistic range of their music. ""Barock"" is baroque, while ""Channel 7"" (which has already been winningly remixed by John Talabot) pays homage to DJ Rolando's ""Knights of the Jaguar"" with wave after wave of divebombing trills courtesy of Westrich, whose cinematic loops add drama to many tracks. Blindingly happy piano playing fills in for swept strings, like Schroeder from ""Peanuts"" riding a huge caffeine rush. You can tell they've studied their Satie, Glass, Bartók, Prokofiev, etc., but their music doesn't feel much like a master's thesis. It's earnest and rapturous, gliding elaborately in fast, intelligible currents. Usually, at least. If you expect heat from every track, then Aufgang is far from a perfect album-- the songs are deeply contrasted, with almost no middle ground between the thunderclaps and long, sullen rumbles. Only ""3 Vitesses"" really explores that broad middle range of intensity, with insistently ticking drums and sharp-cornered, diabolical piano intervals that continually dodge comfortable resolution. For attention-grabbers, you've basically got ""Channel 7"" and ""Barock""; ""Sonar"", which has the album's most sure-footed build-up; ""Good Generation"", where rolling, 1970s-sounding pianos blur into sparkly electro; and ""Aufgang"", which admits a little rowdy acid into the mix. At the other extreme, ""Prelude Du Passé"" crawls at a glacial pace, and ""Soumission"" closes the album with over 10 minutes of dissonant, decaying chords. It can be hard to get all the way through that one, knowing that the unstoppable ""Channel 7"" is about to wrap around. But the more austere tracks underscore something good about Aufgang. They don't just charge straight for the rafters; they pause, reconsider, begin again. They ask the listener to flip back and forth between patience and euphoria on cue, over and over. For those willing to do so, the gemlike clarity of the album's peaks feel even harder and brighter.","Blending classical piano, live drums, and techno-inspired electronics, Aufgang's fresh sound is hard to classify.

It Was Easy,Title Tracks,by: Jason Crock,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a816b1335d7bf16991cd/1:1/w_160/e2daf712.jpg,2010-02-10 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13880-it-was-easy/,Ernest Jenning,"While all three members of Q and Not U formed different projects after their breakup five years ago, the ensuing career of their drummer, John Davis, might be the biggest and most pleasant surprise. He's continued to record smart, affable power pop-- one record as the frontman of the band Georgie James, and now recording most everything himself under the name Title Tracks. If It Was Easy, his first full-length under the name, is any indication, it seems he's just getting started. The record begins with his 2009 debut single, ""Every Little Bit Hurts"", which is a fine place to start: With just Davis' voice and guitar (and barely any drums at all), ""Every Little Bit Hurts"" is as unassuming as it is infectious, burrowing into the brain on the strength of just a few chords. If you thought Ted Leo's mostly-solo Tell Balgeary, Balgury Is Dead EP should have been longer, this is a jam you need to hear. But while Davis proves himself worthy as a one-man studio band, the record still seems sparse and somewhat bare. Most of the time, that works in his favor. Take his cover of Bruce Springsteen's ""Tougher Than the Rest"", re-imagined here as a Casio keyboard-led lullaby sung as a duet with Camera Obscura's Tracyanne Campbell. It's a departure for Davis, but is also a fine example of his ability to do less with more. (Granted, having a voice like Campbell's to assist you goes a long way; Camera Obscura recently released their own version of ""Tougher"" as a B-side to a recent single). On other songs, little details add up, sometimes changing the whole tone and feel of a track. The lazy skank of ""No, Girl"" opens with a surprising saxophone riff courtesy of Kriston Capps. And on ""Hello There"", dance-informed rhythms appear, lending the verses a syncopated buoyancy before a gentler, strummier B-section takes it somewhere else entirely. The faster pace of tracks like ""Every Little Bit Hurts"" or ""Steady Love"", with their mouthful of syllables and quick phrasing, suit Davis' strengths. While he's a capable vocalist, it would take a voice with a lot of character to really sell tracks like the saccharine commercial jingle-like ""Black Bubblegum"" or the whisper-level intimacy of ""At Fifteen"". Davis has crafted a careful and infectious power-pop record on his own that's easy to love (especially for fans of the aforementioned Ted Leo or the New Pornographers). But while he's done the full-band frontman thing before in Georgie James, he might take Title Tracks even further if he pulls in some more helping hands with more of the canny decision-making he's made here.","Q and Not U drummer John Davis, formerly of Georgie James, continues the latter band's power-pop lean with his new project.

It may have lost some of the youthful agility that marked her work with guitarist Loren Conners in the 1980s, but she has gained a grace and gravity to match her age and experience. A cult figure from the tiny New Haven folk scene, Bloom is no retreating artist waiting to be rediscovered by a new generation: While she may not pursue music as determinedly as she once did, she never stopped recording or performing, whether solo or with a group of friends called the Love at Work Band. It's just that her records have usually been small-run releases, usually sold through her website and at the occasional show or folk-fest appearance. So credit goes to Australian label Chapter Music for giving her a wider audience by reissuing some of her 80s albums, collecting her 90s output on the 2007 comp Finally, releasing a strong collection of new material called Terror, and organizing a tribute album featuring Devendra Banhart, Bill Callahan, the Dodos, and Mark Kozelek. Kozelek was apparently so taken with Bloom that he signed her to his Caldo Verde label and has released her latest album, Thin Thin Line. Again backed by members of the Love at Work Band, Bloom sounds like a woman who has spent years in the wilderness. Against the elegantly rustic folk backdrop, which swirls with fiddle and harmonica, she sings about fragile hearts and precarious relationships with tender, maternal authority (the album is dedicated to her son Jack). An earthy, unpretentious presence, she can snap a heart like a twig on the title track and ""Heart So Sadly"". Her voice is shaky and imprecise, but as always, it's all the more affecting for its imperfections. When she sings wordlessly and forcefully in her upper register on ""Another Point of View"", the effect is harrowing. When she whoops through ""I'm Thinking of Love"" or chirps out the sing-songy ""Freddie"", she sounds joyful even if her words are not. This is an album about the thin line between happiness and sorrow. In conveying such emotional extremes, Bloom's songwriting remains startlingly direct in its plainspoken poetry. Bloom writes like she's working through problems, so her songs tend to build organically and gracefully. On ""Heart So Sadly"", she arrives at a sing-along melody that isn't just an effective hook, but a hard-won epiphany: ""This is good, this is great/ This is good, this is great."" It's simple, yet poignant. On ""Let's Get Living"", Bloom sings a chorus that in other hands might be simply a bromide: ""If we're living, let's get living."" In a sense, it's her ""Let's Get It On"", a desperate plea to move beyond arguments and grudges and just be together. But it's the lines that follow that reveal the stakes on this and every song on Thin Thin Line: ""And if we're dying, let's just hope it's quick/ Without a lot of pain, not this bit by bit."" Time is precious, and she's not wasting a moment.","The singer-songwriter with a devoted cult following returns with a fine album on Mark Kozelek's Caldo Verde imprint.

I'm New Here,Gil Scott-Heron,by: Nate Patrin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a824b1335d7bf16991f2/1:1/w_160/bdb9cb92.jpg,2010-02-10 06:00:00,Jazz,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13893-im-new-here/,XL,"There were few voices that articulated the anxious, fractured state of America in the 1970s and early 80s as well as the clear baritone of Gil Scott-Heron. As a spoken-word artist and poet, he could pinpoint the fissures in the American dream and exorcise them with a wit that blended righteous anger and arch sarcasm. As a singer he could envelop those same uncomfortable confrontations in a rich, emotional tone that brought out the empathetic face of unrest. Yet except for a chorus cameo on Blackalicious' ""First in Flight"" and a memorable shout-out on LCD Soundsystem's ""Losing My Edge"", he was rarely heard or cited in the early years of America's great post-traumatic decade, even if his pained depiction of ""a nation that just can't stand much more"" in ""Winter in America"" rang as true in 2002 as it did in 1975. Instead, Scott-Heron spent much of the 00s in and out of prison on drug charges, adding onto a long hiatus that saw him turn away from the record industry in favor of live performance and writing. Between 1983 and 2009, he released only one studio album, 1994's Spirits, so issuing his first in 16 years could've been rife with potential for a pent-up analysis of everything that's happened in the process of race relations and American culture over the last couple decades. Yet I'm New Here sees an incisive political voice turning inwards, not protesting the doings of the greater world but crafting a frank confessional over the state of his own. He does this allusively, through cover songs and short soundbite interludes and original compositions that feel like sparse flashes of a deep, once-dormant creative impulse. Yet it still feels honest, like something said out of necessity instead of opportunity, and the result is an album that engages with the idea of loneliness in exceptional ways. I'm New Here is bookended with a two-part spoken-word track that sounds like a metatextual stunt: the quintessential hip-hop prototype discussing his upbringing over a loop of the intro to Kanye West's ""Flashing Lights"", returning the nod towards ""Home Is Where the Hatred Is"" that underpinned Late Registration's ""My Way Home"". But ""On Coming From a Broken Home"" is a powerful mission of purpose that sets the tone for the rest of the album, a reflection of his upbringing that made him the man he is today. ""Broken Home"" pays homage to the women in his family and the strengths they passed on to him; other interludes hint at darkly comic acknowledgements of wrongdoing, modest but defiant statements of enduring survival, and an admission that even his less desirable personality traits are an inseparable part of his identity. Those brief interstitial statements link pieces of brain-wracked guilt and anxiety that rank as truly haunting moments: ""Where Did the Night Go"", a study in lonely insomnia and the inability to communicate with someone he loves, and the confession in ""New York Is Killing Me"" that the city that held him in an alienating grasp for so long-- ""eight million people, and I didn't have a single friend""-- only makes him long for the home in Tennessee he left at 13 after his grandmother died. It's an interesting contrast to the sentiment of his 1976 song ""New York City"", where he sang of a metropolis he loved because it reminded him of himself. Either the personalities of the man and the city have diverged too much, or they've gotten too close for comfort. But the most noticeable thing about Scott-Heron on this album to anyone familiar with his work is how worn his voice sounds. It's raspier and age-weathered, less agile, and occasionally prone to letting words slur and melt into each other instead of leaping out as they did back in the 70s. But Richard Russell, the album's producer and owner of XL Recordings, hit on the idea of recasting a man who came up through soul-jazz as a grizzled blues performer, and setting Scott-Heron against sandblasted folk and heavy, borderline-industrial beats augments the rawness of his voice well. Three songs reveal him as an adept interpreter of three generations' worth of roots music: Robert Johnson's ""Me and the Devil"" rendered as vintage Massive Attack, a minimalist, piano-driven orchestral reworking of the Brook Benton-written Bobby ""Blue"" Bland classic ""I'll Take Care of You"", and the unexpected but deftly claimed title track, sourced from Smog. And two spare, static-textured cuts late in the album, ""Running"" and ""The Crutch"", give his equally-gritty voice a fitting place in the post-Burial strain of bass music. For an album that comes so far after its creator's last trip to the studio, it's a bit of a relief that the only cause for disappointment is its brief length. I'm New Here is less than half an hour, though in that short span it does the impressive job of reviving an artist that's been out of the spotlight far too long and setting him up for a new incarnation as an elder statesman of modern roots music. Comparisons have been made to what Rick Rubin did for Johnny Cash in the 90s, and the parallels are there: I'm New Here and American Recordings are both cover-heavy, starkly-produced releases where rebellious icons become reflective as they hit their sixties. If Gil Scott-Heron's creative resurgence continues after this reintroduction to his poignantly aging voice, we could be looking at one of the most memorably resurrected careers of our time-- a man renewed.","The influential singer-songwriter returns after many years with a powerful album that mixes spoken word, folk, and blues over roughed-up sonics.

"Si, Para Usted: The Funky Beats of Revolutionary Cuba, Vol. 2",Various Artists,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a7445e6ef95969320f31/1:1/w_160/7a5e03e3.jpg,2010-02-09 06:00:04,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13710-si-para-usted-the-funky-beats-of-revolutionary-cuba-vol-2/,Waxing Deep,"One of my fantasies is to be able to wander through the complete archives of the world's great record labels, neatly ordered and annotated. The history of recorded sound only stretches back to 1878 (1857 if you count the phonautograph), but in that time, output has been prodigious, on the order of millions of recordings, many of which are lost. How cool would it be to walk into an Indiana Jones-like warehouse with the entire unabridged catalog of Columbia Records, a company that's made recordings since 1888? Of course, no such place exists-- the many large companies that made records worldwide through the middle of the 20th century had no central warehouses where everything was gathered, and the smaller labels often suffered from lack of organization and resources. If your offices burned in a war, well, that was it for your archives. Cuba's EGREM (Empresa de Grabaciones y Ediciones Musicales-- literally ""Music Recording and Publishing Company"") is one of the many labels whose history I'd love to tour. It is the product of revolution, founded in 1964 after Castro and his government had consolidated their power, and it's been the sole entity responsible for documenting Cuban sounds on record ever since. While the generic name reflects the ideology of its communist overlords, the label has played host to a mind-boggling array of soulful, vital, innovative, and inventive music. On the first Si, Para Usted volume, Waxing Deep exposed a clutch of funky, sometimes psychedelic recordings from the 1970s and 80s that showed that the changes that swept through the world's pop music in the decade previous didn't leave Cuba behind in spite of the suffocating political environment. Here, they've gone even deeper, jettisoning many of the known names of the first volume in favor of mostly unfamiliar artists. Some of these artists recorded only one or two songs, owing mostly to the arbitrary nature and complete lack of business sense that characterized the Cuban music business. Los Barba, for example, was one of the most popular bands in the country but never made an album. Which is a shame, because ""Al Sonar La Hora"" suggests they were exceedingly capable, with swelling horn accents, slashing psychedelic guitar, tweaked organ solos, and dead-on harmony vocals that come out of nowhere for the chorus. Most recordings made in Cuba were by acts on the government payroll, but there are a few LPs of amateur bands floating around. These featured non-professional (as in, not employed by the government) groups who performed well in national arts and culture festivals, and the examples included here are inspired. Combo Los Caribe's ""Andalucía"" has elements of surf, exotica, and 60s now-sound records layered onto its Cuban rhythms, while on ""Safari Salvaje"", Los Rápidos open with a wild Afro-Cuban barrage of drums and incantation, only to blindside you with a crackling drum fill and an onslaught of chicken scratch guitar. As much as they tried, Cuba's censors couldn't beat back the tide of American music. The island is close enough to Miami to hear its radio stations, which is probably how Orquesta Cubana de Música Moderna managed a version of Ides of March's 1970 horn rock hit ""Vehicle"". Theirs is a crazy, funky instrumental that ends with a garage rock organ quotation of Bach's ""Toccata and Fugue in D Minor"". Cuban musicians may have operated with a great many more constraints than their counterparts up north, but their exploratory spirit and artistic invention was no less vibrant, and it's great that we're finally getting to hear some of this music, presented with a great deal of background information. I'm certainly hoping for a Volume 3.","This retrospective gathers songs from Cuba's 1960s and 70s, a time when global pop was blending with the country's traditional music.

Raiders,Robedoor,by: Marc Masters,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a7f413d1975652139546/1:1/w_160/a1c665d7.jpg,2010-02-09 06:00:03,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13851-raiders/,Not Not Fun,"When I first heard them in 2007, on a magnificent split release with Pocahaunted, L.A. duo Robedoor sounded like a drone band with doom-metal leanings. The more of their stuff I tracked down-- and there's a lot of it-- the more vivid that image became, convincing me they were heirs to the path carved by Double Leopards, Axolotl, My Cat Is an Alien, and Yellow Swans. But others feel Robedoor's entrancing combo of heavy atmosphere, endless vibrations, and dark, dense tones makes them more a doom-metal band with drone overtones-- like a looser, grimier version of Sleep or Sunn O))). That distinction may ultimately be academic, but whatever they were before, Robedoor may have finally swung their pendulum toward doom-metal. Easily their most song-oriented effort, Raiders is driven by Sabbath-y bass chug, momentous crash/pound drumming, and moaning vocals that conjure a Satanic ritual. Alex and Britt Brown (no relation) have dabbled in beats and riffs before, but here they fully commit, letting their swirling noises and enveloping drones grow out of patterns rather than vice versa. The effect is intentional-- as Britt recently told me in an email, their goal was ""to consolidate all the sprawling dungeon improv Robedoor aesthetics into shorter, replicable songs."" Raiders is certainly the first Robedoor record that I've found myself humming along to. The big fat bass riff on ""Indo Shadow"" (played by longtime Robedoor producer Ged Gengras) is instantly memorable, launching the Browns into starry guitar/drum cacophony. Fourteen-minute closer ""The Downcast Eye"" takes a similar tack, rocking like a creaky boat on a foggy, black sea. ""The downcast eye is the only eye I know,"" Britt intones, suggesting a vision darker than that of the L.A. bands Robedoor share stages and labels with (Britt runs Not Not Fun with his wife Amanda of Pocahaunted). But somehow the band's blurry, hallucinatory music makes underground L.A. seem just as dreamlike as it does in sunnier work by groups like the Mae Shi and Foot Village. Still, Robedoor fit best in the global drone underground, and with lots of the best bands drifting away-- Yellow Swans broke up in 2008, and Double Leopards have been on extended hiatus since before then-- the Browns have become flame-keepers alongside Emeralds, Black to Comm, Jazzfinger, and Sun Araw. It's a role they may be too modest to claim, but judging by Raiders (and the forthcoming Burners, another song-oriented affair and their first album as a trio with Gengras), the drone fire is in good hands.","Either a doom band with drone overtones or a drone one with doom overtones, L.A. duo Robedoor follow in the footsteps of Double Leopards, Axolotl, and others.

AFCGT,AFCGT,by: Jason Crock,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a806b1335d7bf16991aa/1:1/w_160/c615ef89.jpg,2010-02-09 06:00:02,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13869-afcgt/,Sub Pop,"Is this the weirdest Sub Pop release ever? The label has always kept an eye on the under-underground, putting out Postal Service with one hand while sneaking out a Wolf Eyes album with the other-- not to mention releasing the final record by the still-underrated A-Frames, some of whose members make up AFCGT. But if you were looking for the dark minimalist guitar rock of that band (or their offshoot, the Intelligence), AFCGT ain't it; and even if you were familiar with the drones and sound collages of Climax Golden Twins, among whose members also make AFCGT, you still likely aren't prepared for what this record sounds like. The meeting of the atmospheric and the angular takes both approaches to someplace often bewildering and wholly unexpected. Even among the sub-genres that make up noise and drone, they still defy categorization. It's not very mixtape-friendly, but given the members' respective backgrounds, the band's palette is stunningly large. ""Black Mark"" has a two-note riff that sounds on the verge of collapse before it finally does break. ""Two-Legged Dog"" stretches some muted, watery guitar chords on a loop, over which squealing, textural guitar congeals into a thick psychedelic stew. ""New Punk 27"" stops and starts in fits, with grooves and riffs rising out of full-band chaos, and ""Reasonably Nautical"" is an uneasy rising drone of washed-out guitar, field recordings, and white noise. ""Nacht"" and ""Slide 9"" are ominous almost-grooves of cymbal taps and guitar squiggles; the former has vocals, but modulated down to a thick drawl and in a foreign language. You may have heard some of this before, but never put together in quite such a way. It's clear the group is more concerned with courting chaos and incorporating it into their compositions than they are with verse-chorus-verse. That said, there are moments, flashes, and vibes here that are indelible, like the teeth-grinding groove that closes ""Nacht"" or the moments of ""New Punk"" where the jarring quick edits drop away to anguished, muffled vocals. One gets the feeling AFCGT are continually re-editing and re-contextualizing snippets from one strange, endless jam. The pieces on this particular release are disparate-- even earlier AFCGT releases had more of a band-in-the-room feel to them-- but it's a trade-off to show what different sounds the band can summon, which are often fascinating and affecting.","Former members of the still-underrated A-Frames team with members of Climax Golden Twins for a record of drones and sound collages.

Songs About People I Know,Stricken City,by: Paul Thompson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a8329d034d5c69bf39a9/1:1/w_160/c6294044.jpg,2010-02-09 06:00:01,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13907-songs-about-people-i-know/,Kora,"Songs About People I Know, the glassy, slightly grimy London-based post-punk foursome Stricken City's debut, sits somewhere between an EP and LP. Featuring 24 minutes of reverby guitars and spluttery drums careening around singer/keyboardist Rebekah Raa's hook-heavy character sketches, it's a fine record; despite its length, it's fleshed out and full of flourish. If anything, it's all over way too soon. If only they knew more people. There's something wonderfully ramshackle and even a little weird about the songs on Songs, from the creaky Victrola of opener ""Gifted"" (apparently recorded in a London bus) to the unspooling C86 haze that covers the rest. Bleary guitars, tricky rhythms, and Raa's ascendant vocal melodies seem engaged in a tug of war, and even the odd ballad feels, well, odd when cast in their able amble. The best tunes here aren't too fitful to be unruly or even undancable, yet their muddled construction always seems to threaten a topple. It's Raa who holds it all together, her voice dipping and soaring over these tunes, a little like a looser Sue Tompkins from Life Without Buildings. Even with an oddball backdrop, an unlikely vocal melody, over an unruly pile of guitars, Raa finds a way to captivate, and without much apparent effort. The intimate portraits promised in the title don't quite materialize-- most songs are about people you know, y'know-- but the legit pangs of longing in Raa's voice lead one to believe she entered the booth for every tune with somebody specific in mind, even when the sentiments feel a little general. The accordion-led ""Sometimes I Love You"" leans that way-- sometimes she hates you, too-- but, on the strength of its unique arrangement and Raa's resigned vocal, you'll barely notice. Stark closer ""Terrible Things"" smacks of PJ Harvey's bleak White Chalk, and Raa, much like Polly Jean Harvey, conveys an awful lot even when she doesn't seem to be saying much. There's just so much ground covered here that throwing something else at them, like a more complicated lyric, might prove their tipping point. As it stands, though, Songs is a series of small successes in slightly askew songcraft.","Delightfully ramshackle, this UK indie pop band works wonderfully in spite of seemingly being another jumble of influences.

Heligoland,Massive Attack,by: Nate Patrin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a80c9d034d5c69bf394b/1:1/w_160/2e3d00b5.jpg,2010-02-09 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13864-heligoland/,Virgin,"For their first three albums, you could count on Massive Attack to make music that was as intense as it was graceful. As the moods of their albums gradually transitioned from refined soul to grimy abrasion on Blue Lines, Protection, and Mezzanine, they used that balance to toy with the emotional structure of their sound. The result was some of the decade's most haunting, forward-thinking music. Depending on how and when you listen, the same Massive Attack song can creep you out, fill you with sorrow, or send you into a deep reverie. The best ones do it all at once. Many fans consider what little music Massive Attack released since Mezzanine to be a retreat of sorts, and it's true that they may have lost something with each original member that split off-- namely the hip-hop sensibility of Andrew ""Mushroom"" Vowles and the frigid snarl of Grant ""Daddy G"" Marshall. Their next release, 2003's 100th Window, seemed like a creative holding pattern brought on by the group's personnel situation, but it did have a few moments of sinister beauty. Heligoland-- the first non-soundtrack Massive Attack album in seven years and the first with Daddy G back on board in 12-- misses that quality. The undercurrent of menace and sadness that defined Massive Attack's best music is largely absent, replaced with a drowsy, half-formed gloom that, if anything, suggests resignation instead of dread. Last fall's Splitting the Atom EP offered a couple of warning signs that reappear on this album. ""Pray for Rain"" is a woozy, overlong dirge redeemed only by Tunde Adebimpe's rich voice, the only instrument that bothers with anything approaching dynamics. And the EP's title track, which reunited the voices of Daddy G, Horace Andy, and Robert ""3D"" Del Naja over achy-kneed downtempo electro, just blithely rotates in place alongside a dead-eyed organ riff like a beat-to-shit merry-go-round. The potential of both these tracks-- strong vocalists carrying a sense of weariness over bleak ambiance-- is sabotaged by the music's unwillingness to rise, crest, and fall, to shift momentum or volume, to do anything more than sulk in the background with its hands in its pockets, kicking at the ground. That problem becomes more obvious throughout the rest of the album, especially when you're hit with one of its exceptions. ""Girl I Love You"" is a bracing embodiment of everything that made those classic Horace Andy-fronted Massive Attack tracks so great: a half-Reznor, half-Gaye backbeat; ghostly filtered guitars and snarling blasts of brass; that exceptional voice transfusing vintage lover's rock into harrowing cries for help. It completely annihilates nearly everything else on the album: the watery, choppy acoustic guitar loops that underpin Martina Topley-Bird on ""Psyche"", which sound like something Dan Deacon would come up with if he was scared of being abrasive; the listless half-skank of Hope Sandoval spotlight ""Paradise Circus""; the Damon Albarn-feels-sad moment ""Saturday Come Slow"", which sounds kind of like Blur's ""Sweet Song"" with all the hope drained out. And note those names, 90s icons all-- they're a quick and easy shorthand if you need to point out how little Heligoland engages with current music. Since 100th Window, the post-hip-hop landscape of bass music has extrapolated into an endlessly creative nebula of dubstep, wonky, UK funky, Balearic, and other rich veins of style. And how does this album engage with it? By closing out with a track, ""Atlas Air"", that sounds kind of like Aeroplane bliss-disco trying to be as creepy as the Knife. Elsewhere, we get a flimsy New Order pastiche (""Rush Minute"") and glitchy quasi-jungle (""Babel"") to show for it. Burial's been given these tracks for a potential No Protection treatment, so there's that, at least, but it's a shame to think that it'll take an outside producer to salvage this stuff rather than simply reinterpret it. So what does an album this defeatist-sounding have to say? It just so happens to come at a time where defeatism feels pretty natural, and ironically that makes these songs feel even harder to relate to. When Daddy G mutters despairingly how there's ""No hope without dope/ The jobless return/ The bankers have bailed"" on ""Splitting the Atom"" or Elbow's Guy Garvey moans fearfully about home insecurity on ""Flat of the Blade"", it feels of-the-moment-- but part of a moment you want to break out of because the malaise feels suffocating. Anxiety is one thing, hopelessness is another entirely. And when your whole world can feel, in the words of ""Pray for Rain"", like a ""dull residue of what once was,"" it's probably better to wait for an album that can't be described the same way.","On their first non-soundtrack album in seven years, original member Daddy G returns and Damon Albarn, Hope Sandoval, and Elbow's Guy Garvey guest.

"Talking to You, Talking to Me",The Watson Twins,by: Stephen M.

Their sisterly harmonies, so tight and effortless they seemingly could only be the product of twins, have taken them far-- most notably landing them a job adding 1970s country window dressing to Jenny Lewis' Rabbit Fur Coat. Those voices also got them a deal at Vanguard Records and a modest following well outside of Los Angeles. On the other hand, their first EP and debut LP highlighted those voices primarily by stripping everything else away, leaving their vocals to anchor subpar songs, and an anonymous musical backdrop that placed them squarely in an L.A. folk-rock revival alongside far less agile groups like the Chapin Sisters, Biirdie, and the Winter Flowers. The Twins' second full-length-- Talking to You, Talking to Me-- shows they have more reach and personality than most of their contemporaries, not by proving them more capable singers but by amping up their accompaniment. In fact there are actually fewer showboating harmonies on this record and a greater reliance on solo singing. Typically, one of the Twins takes the lead, and the other either provides backing oohs and aahs or drops in to emphasize certain phrases. It's a crafty trick that makes their lyrics sound a bit more barbed than they actually are. That's how they approach ""Devil in You"", with one of them singing the verses and the other joining in on the chorus to give the lyrics more bite: ""Well, the devil in you tried to tell me what to do/ I don't think so."" There are, of course, still some sleepy moments that are more pretty than pointed: ""Snow Canyons"" begins softly, adding a few instruments but never really going anywhere, and ""Tell Me Why"" is perhaps the tweest thing the sisters have ever recorded. Perhaps the Twins got bored with the same old canyon-rock sound, or perhaps the touring for Fire Songs transformed their makeshift band into a tight unit, or perhaps they realized they could never distinguish themselves by blending in, but on Talking to You they have given their backing musicians freer rein with the arrangements, essentially placing equal emphasis on vocals and music. That much is evident from the opener, ""Modern Man"", which trips along on a prominent beat that makes the most of a closed high hat. The percussive organ strikes lend ""Harpeth River"" its Portisheadiness, but the organ really gets going on ""Midnight"", dogging the vocal melody, spackling the spaces in the verses, and finally tearing the song down with a lengthy solo. The band amplifies these songs not just sonically but thematically, bolstering the walking-on-a-wire sensibility of slower numbers like ""Forever Me"" and ""U N Me"". In general, Talking to You sounds like an album that is gradually divorcing itself from history and geography, as the Twins learn to build on that West Coast sound to create something unique and personal. They're not there yet, but give them another tour.","The angelic-voiced L.A. folk-rock revivalists add versatility and personality to their sound.

Heart of My Own,Basia Bulat,by: Amy Granzin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a82eea9e61561daa5769/1:1/w_160/836543db.jpg,2010-02-08 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13903-heart-of-my-own/,Rough TradeSecret City,"Toronto native Basia Bulat won some deserved attention, including a Polaris prize nomination and a spot on the idiosyncratic Rough Trade roster, with her 2007 debut LP, Oh My Darling. Stylistically diverse-- almost to a fault-- the record proved Bulat to be as comfortable with lilting waltz-time folk as jazz-cadenced pop as licensable indie catnip. Howard Bilerman (Arcade Fire, Godspeed You! Black Emperor, British Sea Power) worked with Bulat, and though they at times nudged the taste needle with torrid pianos and flowery strings, Darling successfully balanced slick studio intervention with a charming handmade rustle and clatter (not to mention a lot of enthusiastic handclapping). But while Bulat's versatility's a selling point, it's her rare, extraordinary voice that makes her a fresh find in the notoriously musty folk-pop bin. Graceful and incandescent, confident but approachable, her alto's the aural equivalent of the perfect party host who makes every guest not only welcome, but certain they're the most important person in the room. ""Oh oh oh, I've done myself in,"" she laments on ""Sugar and Spice"", a song from new album, Heart of My Own, that traces the self-obliterating nature of love. And it seems like she's sharing her secret with you and you alone. It probably goes without saying that Bulat's flush-with-feeling lyrics aren't going to appeal to the more cynical consumers of singer-songwriter fare. (Then again, you could count those oxymoronic individuals on two hands.) Did I mention that while she plays most of the instruments on her record, Bulat favors the humble autoharp, clutching it to her chest like a Victorian nursemaid with an infant? It's a mistake to read Bulat's songs as pre-Raphaelite pictorials or confessional Lilith Fair bait, though. For one thing, Bulat's brother Bobby's urgent, jittery, even martial drum work is thoroughly contemporary and continually prods Heart's songs into scrambling motion. Spectacular album opener ""Go On"" pairs hit-the-road-Jack sentiments with a rapid ramp-up to runaway train rhythms. ""Gold Rush"", wisely released as the LP's first single, interprets ""rush"" literally, with stomped beats, gushing strings, and Bulat's fevered vocal performance. This last track references the album's primary inspiration, Canada's isolated Yukon Territory. Bulat stopped and wrote a batch of songs on her last tour in tiny Dawson City, and you can practically hear the north wind's raw melancholy burn on tunes like the otherwise frisky title track. Unfortunately, Heart's production isn't always successful. Bulat seems out of breath competing with the brute-forced keyboards of ""Walk You Down"". And despite all the ace moments in ""Gold Rush"", what sounds like a choir's ""ah ah ah ahs"" that sneak in on the song's bridge sound stolen from Arcade Fire's Funeral sessions. Not only does such embellishment gild the lily in an already crowded hothouse, but it dates the song five years. Possibly more distracting are the precious sleigh bells roped around ""Run""'s neck and mixed too high. I think I speak for everyone when I say so soon after the holidays: I don't want to hear another goddamned jingle bell for at least 10 months. But the album shakes such shackles often enough to maintain an atmosphere of warm intimacy. Bulat's shown an affinity for gospel in the past, covering Sam Cooke's ""Touch the Hem of His Garment"" live, and I had to doublecheck that the soul-baring, organ-burred album closer, ""If It Rains"", isn't a traditional praise song (nope, Bulat wrote it). Because her voice, all on its own, sells the material with such bolded, exclamation-pointed certainty that she might as well be singing amens.","A rare find in the crowded folk-pop world, this Rough Trade singer/songwriter is engagingly versatile and fresh.

Daptone Gold,Various Artists,by: Stephen M.

So convincingly did the band and the singer transform the song and reset it in a soul-historical context that apparently many listeners, as yet unfamiliar with the band or with Daptone's mission, assumed that this was the original, exhumed after so many decades of obscurity, and that Jackson's was actually the cover. Daptone, however, is not a reissue label. It releases primarily new recordings often featuring old singers, studiously re-creating the sounds of 1960s and 70s soul, as if to unhinge that style from history and prove it timeless, sceneless. The label has been praised for the precision of its revivalism as well as the strength of its roster, which includes Sharon Jones, Lee Fields, and the Budos Band, among others. There's a fine line, however, between revivalism and slavish mimicry, and the concern for historical fidelity that has garnered praise for Daptone acts has caused other contemporary bands to be routinely dismissed for sounding too much like 70s Laurel Canyon folk-rock or 80s Mancunian post-punk. So why shouldn't the same critical standard apply to Daptone? Daptone Gold, which is either a very savvy label sampler or a very generous greatest hits, goes a long way toward answering that question. The nearly two dozen songs gathered here-- some new and familiar, others previously unreleased-- cover a lot of territory, from the urbanized (i.e., pre-Guiliani New York) afrofunk sounds of Antibalas to the soul-jazz struts of the Budos Band to the sanctified, secularized gospel of Naomi Shelton to the old-soul wallop of figureheads Sharon Jones and Lee Fields. Daptone's reach is both deep and wide, looking not to specific scenes or personalities from soul history, but to a generalized conception of the past as fertile territory for musical exploration. In other words, Daptone Gold (which features liner notes by Pitchfork contributor Douglas Wolk) benefits not so much from its associations with Stax or Motown or Philly or Hi or any other prestigious label, but from the excitement and directness of the music itself. The players not only know their history, but they have the chops to translate that knowledge into music that only rarely sounds academic. The Budos Band apparently live in the pocket: On their three songs on Daptone Gold, the horns, percussion, and rhythm guitar immediately click into place and never let up. Especially on ""Budos Rising"", the horns soar precipitously over the prickly guitar licks and rumbling bongo funk, creating a tense call-and-response with the organ. Similarly, the groove on Antibalas' makossa-style cover of Hector Lavoe's ""Che Che Cole"" seems propelled by gravity itself, clicking in sweetly with Mayra Vega's spry vocals. And the Dap-Kings, which are more or less the Daptone house band even though they're most commonly identified with Sharon Jones, construct dense grooves that allow space for scribbles of saxophone and organ. On the instrumental ""Nervous Like Me"", the reeds completely lose their shit while the guitar keeps everything together with a four-note theme. It's chaos rough-drafted into something barely orderly. As with the label, Daptone Gold lives and dies on personality. Binky Griptite's intro promising ""four solid sides of soul"" almost sinks the revivalism into kitsch, although his guitar playing on the B-side ""The Stroll Part 2"", recorded with the Mellomatics, proves he's a more inventive guitarist than singer. He shows a limited vocal and emotional range on ""A Lover Like Me"", but that may have less to do with his innate talents than with the company he keeps. Lee Fields shreds his vocal chords on the soul excoriation ""Could Have Been"", constantly threatening to go too far over the top but always pulling back at just the right moment. It's a measured, heart-rending performance that transcends retro assumptions, a telling counterpoint to the gimmicky skit he performs on ""Stranded in Your Love"", a duet with Sharon Jones. Exuding unbridled sass and boundless energy whether on stage or in the studio, Jones is arguably Daptone's biggest act, and she gets seven tracks on Gold. ""I'm Not Gonna Cry"" and ""How Long Do I Have to Wait?"" are stalwart soul songs of remarkable emotional complexity, and ""Got a Thing on My Mind"", from her 2002 debut, is a tongue-twisting take on social ills-- a protest party song. And even if her cover of Gladys Knight & the Pips' ""Giving Up"" sounds a bit clunky, especially compared to superlative covers of Janet Jackson, Woody Guthrie, and Prince, Jones nevertheless makes you believe she and Daptone are the real thing.","Studiosly re-creating the sounds of 1960s and 70s soul, Daptone has gained a deserved cult following; here it collects some of its best recordings.

Ali and Toumani,Ali Farka TouréToumani Diabaté,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a819b1335d7bf16991d2/1:1/w_160/118260ab.jpg,2010-02-08 06:00:01,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13883-ali-and-toumani/,World Circuit,"Ali Farka Touré died in 2006. He lived a long and productive life, giving a great deal of marvelous recorded music to the world, seeking ways to bridge the regional musical traditions of his homeland, Mali, and developing a guitar style all his own. He recorded only a few times in the final years of his life, having retired to become the mayor of his hometown, Niafunké-- he used his own money to improve the roads and sewage system, and fueled the town's generator as well. The recordings on this album, the second collaboration between Touré and Diabaté after 2005's justly lauded In the Heart of the Moon, are the last Touré ever made, and they are uncommonly beautiful. Diabaté is a 71st-generation musician, and his mastery of the harp-like kora is complete. He's perfectly comfortable playing traditional songs that stretch back centuries or sitting in on a Björk album, and to hear him play with Touré is a treat. These two men, so different in age and background, nonetheless seem to inhabit the same mind for the length of the sessions. They are joined here and there by guest musicians, including Touré's son, Vieux, and legendary Cuban double bassist Orlando ""Cachaíto"" López (this is also his final recording), but the focus is on the interplay between the two principles. Touré treated the sessions as though he knew they may be his last, returning to his roots to play ""Sina Mory"", the song that inspired him to pick up the guitar in 1956, and ""Sabu Yerkoy"", a celebration of Malian independence in his repertoire since the 60s, but recorded only this one time. For as much pain as he was apparently in, Touré's guitar work sounds untouched by illness. In fact, his playing on opener ""Ruby""-- named by Touré for producer Nick Gold's young daughter-- is so supple and intuitive that he sounds like a much younger man as Diabaté joins him, surrounding his hypnotic figures with fluid runs on the kora. They brilliantly display their telepathic sympathy during on-the-spot improvisation ""Fantasy"", which finds Touré creating a series of anchoring phrases for Diabaté to leap off. On ""Samba Geladio"", you can begin to hear the ways in which Touré's music was a cousin of (but not derived from nor a direct source for) the blues as he pulls some ferocious phrases from his acoustic guitar. Gold and engineer Jerry Boys captured these sessions with uncompromising intimacy-- if you turn it up you can hear the creak of chairs and even a cough. You get the feel of two of the world's greatest musicians in a room together, having a conversation and creating a document that will carry their legacy into the future. It is not challenging music. Anyone can approach it easily, and it is the perfect initiation to Touré's talents for listeners who haven't yet heard him.","The uncommonly beautiful final recordings by Malian guitar pioneer Ali Farka Touré find him once again joined by Toumani Diabaté.

One Life Stand,Hot Chip,by: Scott Plagenhoef,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a83413d19756521395c5/1:1/w_160/2a20eafc.jpg,2010-02-08 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13908-one-life-stand/,Astralwerks,"Ever since Hot Chip started as indie kids seemingly dabbling in classic soul and modern R&B, they've been underestimated (not least of which by us). Delivering lines about ""20-inch rims"" and ""Yo La Tengo"" in a proper English accent, as they did on their 2005 debut, can have that effect. Yet on their two subsequent records-- 2006's The Warning and 2008's Made in the Dark-- Hot Chip steadily rebuilt their reputation by toughening up their sophistipop side. Their melodies began to develop an itchy, nervous twitch, and they earned dancefloor credibility through an association with DFA. Best of all, Hot Chip crafted some of the sneakiest and most effective earworms around-- songs that seem deceptively simple and assuming on first listen became year-end list locks by listen number 10. Their quirky detours, winks, and nods were no longer Prince and Stevie Wonder shoutouts; instead, they were subtler, so the band that initially came across as affable goofballs eventually revealed themselves to be the smartest guys in the room. In short, after a half-decade of having our expectations challenged and any hesitations about them erased, it finally felt like we knew who Hot Chip were. But their fourth album, One Life Stand, changes things a bit. After dialing back some of their eccentricities, their latest feels if anything even more likely to be underestimated. Oddly, this is arguably their best record yet. Whether you'll agree will depend on what you want from Hot Chip and what you want from an album. One Life Stand is their most consistent and most complete record, but it's missing an A-list single on par with ""Boy From School"", ""Over and Over"", or ""Ready for the Floor"". It's also missing dance songs in the mode of the latter two, focusing instead on Hot Chip at their most lush and romantic. Some will claim it's them growing up, but that's not true-- they've always exhibited panache and sophistication. This is simply the first time since their debut that they've primarily honed in on those sensibilities, in the process revealing just how far they've come sonically in the past five years. It's a bold move but well earned. The band's split personality was in full effect on Made in the Dark, which flitted between heart-on-sleeve songs like ""We're Looking for a Lot of Love"" and ""One Pure Thought"" and nebbishy hip-shakers like ""Shake a Fist"" and ""Bendable Poseable"". If you wanted a record of the former without the latter, well you're in luck, because that's basically what you have here. As Pitchfork's Ryan Dombal pointed out to me, it's a move akin to the one Pet Shop Boys took circa Behaviour-- a near-shedding of their more overt disco and house influences and an embrace of personal songwriting free of irony or distance. Because the songs not only share mood and tone but also are generally of the same high quality, One Life Stand has a sense of consistency and completeness missing from their other records, too. At its most basic, One Life Stand is a record of love songs; more specifically, it's often a record of self-actualization and redemption-- of recognizing our need for real human connection. Whether about romance or friendship, the songs on One Life Stand are often about commitment (as the album title indicates) and reciprocal relationships. These qualities aren't typically celebrated in pop culture-- stable monogamy and sensitive male bonding don't have the inherent drama of a star-crossed, fleeting, or unrequited love, after all. And yet Hot Chip locate the beauty and power in commitment and in stability. Fully two-thirds of the record is built upon proclamations of long-lasting love, which is made clear in many of the record's key lyrics: ""You are my love light,"" ""I only wanna be your one life stand,"" ""Please take my heart and keep it close to you,"" ""Happiness is what we all want,"" ""I only want one life together in our arms."" If that seems like a sort of bait and switch, then you've really underestimated Hot Chip, because they've been trading in this sort of sincerity for years. On the one hand, between their inauspicious start, geek-chic dancefloor excursions, and videos, Hot Chip can be viewed as wired, robotic, almost anti-human. Yet Hot Chip have functioned as sort of a mirror image of intelligent, dryly confessional 1980s bands like ABC and the Pet Shop Boys: Whereas lyricists like Martin Fry and Neil Tennant smuggled cynicism into the Top 40, Hot Chip sneak sincerity into an indie electro-pop scene dominated at times by the dress-up of blog-house. Perhaps it's no coincidence then that the best of their peers-- electro-soul brothers-in-arms Junior Boys and big-room dance stars Justice-- are also so straight-faced that people also assumed at first they were each a put-on. And each of the three is far outstripping those chasing fads. (Hey, where's that Uffie record we've been ""promised""?) Weirdly, the songs here most likely to turn people off aren't the odes to everlasting love, but those explicitly about the importance of male connection (""Brothers"") or the quest for spiritual guidance (""Slush""). And yet these are the record's twin centerpieces. Neither is as embraceable as singles and potential singles ""One Life Stand"", ""Take It In"", ""Hand Me Down Your Love"", or ""I Feel Better"", but they're the tracks that elevate the record from a collection of very good songs to a complete picture of an important band near the peak of its powers. Whether Hot Chip now stay in this headspace and sonic range-- perhaps there is a record full of nervy, upbeat and/or more tongue-in-cheek songs á la ""The Warning"" or ""Wrestler"" next-- won't obscure the risk they've taken here by fully embracing big-hearted electro-pop. And it won't obscure how successfully they've done it either.","Dialing back some of their eccentricities and embracing personal songwriting, Hot Chip have crafted their most consistent album yet.

144 Pulsations of Light,Ethernet,by: Joe Colly,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a7655e6ef95969320f7f/1:1/w_160/cb3595ff.jpg,2010-02-05 06:00:04,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13737-144-pulsations-of-light/,Kranky,"Tim Gray, the California ambient musician who records under the name Ethernet, wants to heal you... literally. In a press release accompanying 144 Pulsations of Light, his debut LP for Kranky, Gray explains his intent behind the record was to ""apply trance-inducing sonic effects to drone-ambient music... to produce an introspective sonic environment conducive to self-healing work and voyaging into new states of awareness."" That's a pretty ambitious claim to make about one's own music, and whether or not you buy into Gray's ideas about the medicinal qualities of his album-- frankly I don't feel any more enlightened or balanced after hearing it-- there's no doubt that Ethernet sits nicely alongside the meditative sounds of artists such as Gas, Boards of Canada, and Stars of the Lid. Rather than expanding upon one type of drone or ambient, Gray looks to synthesize a few of the more pleasant strains of both genres-- working in particular towards blending Wolfgang Voigt's muted propulsion with the airier groans of avant-pop groups like Talk Talk. It's not the most imaginative approach-- similar work has been done by contemporaries White Rainbow and the Fun Years, among others-- but if you have a sweet spot for this sort of thing, chances are you'll find stretches of the album to enjoy. Though it doesn't always operate within this one style, 144 Pulsations of Light works best when aiming directly for an ambient techno/light drone fusion. On swirling opener ""Majestic"" and the lengthy ""Vaporous"", which worms distorted synths through depth-charge bass pulses, the album circles in on something close to trance-like. Gray is wise to play with atmosphere and switch gears throughout the record, though some of his tonal shifts work better than others. ""Summer Insects"" and ""Kansai"" are two of the more successful, the former using crackling vinyl pops and field recordings to sketch out an agrarian landscape. These natural textures, which bring to mind some of Bibio's current work, play nicely off the dronier pieces here, but a few of the album's later tracks tend to stall out with less complexity. ""Seaside"" looks to create a coastal vibe by riding a gentle, repetitive synth pattern, but there isn't enough movement or dynamism to elevate it beyond a pleasant instrumental. Any such detour into background music can be dangerous on an album like this, and Gray does a good job of mostly avoiding them, but a few missteps ultimately keep the record from achieving its intended goal of full-on ethereality.","Kranky debut from a California artist who sits nicely alongside the meditative sounds of Gas, Boards of Canada, and Stars of the Lid.

Good God! Born Again Funk,Various Artists,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a7c413d19756521394c9/1:1/w_160/868a22c4.jpg,2010-02-05 06:00:03,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13811-good-god-born-again-funk/,Numero Group,"I am not religious. Not even a little. So when I listen to gospel music, there is naturally a gap between me and the people singing. But to be irreligious is not necessarily to be without a spiritual side, and music has always been my connection to it. I don't pretend to have answers-- for all I know, the intangible effects of music could be 100% chemistry or the handiwork of an involved god-- but I do know that music has strange powers. It can lift you up, if not to Heaven, then at least out of a funk; it can access places and emotions that you don't get to in daily conversation, regardless of what the singer is actually saying. It can be hopeful without saying anything hopeful, sad without saying anything sad, joyful without saying a word. More tangibly, music can activate the parts of the brain that govern movement, and here's where it gets really easy to ignore my differences with other belief systems and just get into someone else's groove. This compilation, a collection of funk and soul-influenced gospel music recorded between 1970 and 1985, is Numero Group's second foray into this field, and it's easily as good as the first. It's also funky enough immediately to grab any listener with a taste for rhythm-- even if you don't roll with Jesus, there's a good chance you can enjoy the storytelling and feel the sheer passion these performers put into their music. Right in the middle of the compilation, the Victory Travelers deliver a screaming, devotional blast called ""I Know I've Been Changed"" that hinges on a key couplet heard in numerous funky gospel tunes: ""I dropped in the water, the water was cold/ Chilled my body but not my soul."" It's a powerful image and says a lot about the singer's faith without sanctimony. The body/soul divide is less clear-cut on the Golden Echoes' ""Packing a Grip"". A grip is of course a handbag-- what is she putting in that bag that she'll need in Heaven? Whatever it is, it's funky. Ada Richards is somewhat sly on her wailing number, ""I'm Drunk and Real High (In the Spirit of the Lord)""-- replace the word ""judge"" with ""love"" in the first verse and you'd have a pretty dirty song on your hands. Likewise, the Sensational Five Singing Sons deliver a social protest song clothed in religious vestments on ""Coming on Strong, Staying Along"", referring to their faith as ""a new gun"" in the city. The call to ""rise up"" in Andrew Wartts & the Gospel Storytellers' ""Peter and John"" also directly echoes the conscious soul of the 60s and 70s, albeit in a different context-- it could be that the band was subtly sending one message to the faithful and another to the ghetto. ""Peter and John"" is a unique and highly entertaining casting of a story from the Book of Acts into a boiling funk setting that veers between start-stop passages and slinky J.B.'s-inspired street funk with palm-muted guitar and a light touch on the snare drum. These groups came from all over the eastern half of the U.S., and the array of styles included here is practically a cross-section of American soul and funk in the 70s. The Inspirational Gospel Singers may have recorded in Rochester, New York, but their cover of the Impressions' ""Same Thing It Took"" is a slow, sublime slice of smoky Southern soul that sounds like it could have been cut at Muscle Shoals. Lucy Rodgers' ""Pray a Little Longer"" burns on a sharp Clavinet groove; ""I Know Him"", by the Holy Disciples of Chicago, is loose-limbed and elastic; and Brother Samuel Cheatham brings the blues on ""Troubles of the World"", a burning, anguished crawl that sets its sights on a better place, while the Hammond organ screams in the background. The set is bookended by two massive tracks that bring in full choirs to spread The Word. There's a power to the simple sound of that many people all working toward the same end, giving it all they've got (and sometimes singing a bit sharp in all the excitement), and it's one more reason you don't have to believe what they believe to love the music they made. Music's place in our society is always changing, but it's still the most viscerally powerful medium of expression we've ever devised, and beyond its message, this is music that reaches into those remote places that spark emotional-- and physical-- responses.","Second in Numero's gospel series is easily as good as the first and funky enough to grab any listener with a taste for rhythm, religious or not.

In Search of Stoney Jackson,Strong Arm Steady,by: Patrick Sisson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a80713d197565213956c/1:1/w_160/8350fb17.jpg,2010-02-05 06:00:02,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13868-in-search-of-stoney-jackson/,Stones Throw,"Finding patterns in Madlib's rambling yet brilliant production work can be difficult, but on his new In Search of Stoney Jackson album, he doesn't take long to zero-in on some recurring themes. An obscure sample ushers in ""Chittlins & Pepsi"", a stick-to-your guts blend of flashy soul and food-based free association. Meanwhile, pot ramble ""Cheeba Cheeba"" is anchored by resonant strings and a fluid bass line inhaled and exhaled between minimal beats. It may sound like Doom's M.O.-- tracks seemingly teed-up for the masked marauder. But L.A. hip-hop collective Strong Arm Steady provides the lyrics here. Once the home of auto repair hypeman Xzibit, the crew now stands as another entry in a long line of Beat Konducta collaborators. Stones Throw has been widening its circle of L.A. connections recently, including putting out the acclaimed Dâm-Funk album and reissuing Arabian Prince tracks. This post-Death Row SoCal crew-- which has been reduced to core members Krondon, Phil Da Agony, and San Diegan Mitchy Slick for this release-- has seen its underground profile rise slightly this past year due to a middling Clinton Sparks mixtape and a forthcoming album on Talib Kweli's Blacksmith label. The group's experience working the L.A. scene and slinging mixtapes shows on In Search of Stoney Jackson. In the enviable position of getting a slate of Otis Jackson, Jr. beats to work with, Strong Arm Steady do raise their game, but rarely rise above workmanlike wordplay. They provide vocal diversity but never overshadow or own a track, only accenting different aspects of Madlib's work. Phil Da Agony's curt, taunting flow, filled with bent phrases, darts around between measures. Albino rapper Krondon has a deeper, rounded tone, which plays well on the chorus of the dark ""New Love"", and Mitchy Slick sounds passable on the few tracks he appears on. Along with a roster of collaborators, like Planet Asia and Stones Throw standbys like Oh No and Guilty Simpson, it adds up to a set of solid yet often unremarkable lyrics staking a comfortable perch atop another stellar Madlib production workout. Filled with funky vocal samples, discursive monologues and the inevitable dry coughs, the music is the centerpiece and bears Madlib's signature hazy melodies and blunted edges. But there's a muscular feel to many of the tracks, meaty beats anyone would be happy to rap over. ""Best of Times"", featuring Phonte on the chorus doing his best John Legend, is a slow-rolling, soulful piece built on a solid foundation, a warm bass lick and almost metronomic four-beat rhythm. ""Pressure"" bumps with oscillating synths and a stiff, crisp beat. ""Questions"", which starts out sounding like a washed-out TV theme and then pivots on a big, bulbous bassline, is simple but effective, accented with subtle vibe hits and a single wiry guitar chord. For all Madlib's eclecticism and supposedly short attention span, his work here sounds focused and sharp. The beats aren't wasted here by any means, but a different crew could have brought out even more potential.","Stones Throw continues to widen its circle of L.A. connections, pairing Madlib's production work with this post-Death Row SoCal crew.

The Soft Pack,The Soft Pack,by: Stuart Berman,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a8239d034d5c69bf3986/1:1/w_160/6e589b34.jpg,2010-02-05 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13892-the-soft-pack/,Kemado,"Some thought it was a copout for San Diego garage-rockers the Muslims to give themselves such a cheekily provocative name-- well, coming from four white guys based in a U.S. military outpost, at least-- only to recoil in the face of mounting media attention and change it to the more innocuous Soft Pack. But listening to the band's second album (and first under the new handle) the name-switcheroo scheme now feels appropriately symbolic of the band's evolving personality: Their two-minute missives still charge ahead with jangle-punk strums, pedal-to-the-floor backbeats, and deadpan vocal delivery, but all that swagger can't conceal the band's congenial and increasingly introspective nature. With the album's opening track, the Soft Pack become maybe the 10,000th rock band to write a song called ""C'mon"", but coming from laconic frontman Matt Lamkin, the song is less about inciting action (note the lack of exclamation point), than an eye-rolling dismissal of the trendspotting and premature hype that consumes (and kills) so many bands: ""Don't have the look, don't have the name/ Don't have the walk, don't want to talk, don't act the same/ Now your town could be the next big thing."" Now, San Diego isn't the first city on anyone's lips when people talk about A&R destinations, but the Soft Pack are probably old enough to have witnessed early-90s scene-leaders Rocket from the Crypt, Drive Like Jehu, and Three Mile Pilot trade up to major labels only to get dropped or disband. And following their own hype-magnet experiences at prior CMJ and SXSW appearances-- not to mention a relocation to the music-biz capital of Los Angeles-- the Soft Pack now sound more cautious than caustic. Amid the playful call-and-response choruses and locomotive rhythms, we hear sincere declarations of independence (""Answer to Yourself""), rejections of romance (""Down on Loving""), and warnings against material self-indulgence (""More or Less""). Like the Muslims' 2008 debut album, The Soft Pack sticks to a 1960s-vintage 10-song/30-minute schematic, but under producer Eli [#script:http://pitchfork.com/media/backend/js/tiny_mce/themes/advanced/langs/en.js]|||||| Janney (ex- [#script:http://pitchfork.com/media/backend/js/tiny_mce/themes/advanced/langs/en.js]|||||| Girls Against Boys) it effectively opens the garage door to let the fumes out and more fresh air in, favoring melodic, Love-like leads over power chords, and adding acoustic backing tracks for extra bounce and depth. And though Lamkin's monotone voice is not the most expressive instrument-- it barely wavers whether the occasion calls for a Monks-style organ vamp (""Move Along"") or a prom-night embrace (""Mexico"")-- each album side gradually ratchets up the tension and releases it through a raucous rave-up (""Pull Out"" on side A, ""Parasites"" on side B) that successfully bridges the Soft Pack's Nuggets-schooled ethos with the modern-day discord of San Diegan patron saints Hot Snakes. So while the Soft Pack may exhibit more grace and decorum these days, those seething send-off tracks are proof the band has gone soft in name only.","Formerly known as the Muslims, much buzzed-about California band evolves, grafting some finesse and introspection onto their garage-rock template.

Dreamland EP: Marimba and Shit-Drums,Moonface,by: Rob Mitchum,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a82aea9e61561daa575b/1:1/w_160/e7a0259e.jpg,2010-02-05 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13899-dreamland-ep-marimba-and-shit-drums/,Jagjaguwar,"Depending on where you conduct your Internet research, the marimba, a wooden-block percussion device with West African origins, may be one of the world's oldest instruments. After migrating to South America with African slaves, it caught on big, gaining its Latin name and becoming the national instrument of Guatemala. When it reached the United States in the early 20th century, the marimba was welcomed into symphony orchestras and jazz ensembles, who appreciate the instrument's deep, resonant sound. So leave it to Spencer Krug to put an idiosyncratic spin on the instrument on his Dreamland EP, helpfully and truthfully subtitled Marimba and Shit-Drums. As a love letter, Krug's EP, a single 20-minute track, is closer to a novella than a valentine. The result could have been idle indie rock tourism, but Krug clearly spent some time learning his way around the marimba's blocks, making an instrument rarely encountered in rock into an appropriate vehicle for the REM sleep journey the song narrates. As Krug plays it, the marimba is versatile. At low tones, it sounds like someone dribbling a ceramic basketball around an empty gym. Run a rapid tempo on the high tones, and it sounds like a wind chime caught in a hurricane, or a slot machine symphony. Through the instrumental segments the blocks' woodier vibrations start bleeding together into a gamelan-style pointillist drone. But Krug escapes strictly avant-garde territory, layering melodies until they take on the busy, crowded quality of an 8-bit RPG's dream sequence music. Still, thank goodness for the shit-drums, which are appropriately named in terms of their fidelity. Every time the marimba waves threaten to engulf Krug, the drums splash in like a life preserver, adding a welcome sonic backbone. The song's most radio-friendly segment is just such a moment-- eight minutes in, where Krug's hazy beach visions are suddenly made urgent by a clattering drum part and geysers of spiraling melodies. The sloppiness of those shit-drums may be what keeps Krug's composition from being a stripped-down version of a Tortoise epic-- the back half of ""Djed"" isn't too distant of a cousin. But I'm also reminded, more recently, of Destroyer's ""Bay of Pigs"", last year's example of an indie icon working with elongated song length and unfamiliar instruments. There's a dream logic to both songs, a sense of progression and narrative despite cut-and-paste lyrics, and each has a slowly unspooling structure that brings to mind a palindrome. There's even a satisfying resolution, where Krug drums the listener back to wakefulness while meta-commentating on the instrumentation by concluding in double-track, ""I am making hissing sounds with my mouth."" Those are the moments that make Marimba and Shit-Drums more than just a gimmicky stylistic constraint. Thanks to the contradictions of the marimba-- soft, delicate tones generated through mallet thwacks-- Krug is able to hit just the right emotional note, conjuring an otherworldly and anxious dream-filled night. Like anyone recapping their dreams for you, it's sometimes uncomfortably voyeuristic, but the unusual arrangements make it much easier to take.","Spencer Krug takes a detour under a new alias, constructing a suprisingly affecting and dreamlike 20-minute track using the instruments in the EP's subtitle.

Shape of the Shape,Starless & Bible Black,by: Matthew Murphy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a72c5e6ef95969320ef3/1:1/w_160/46604b1b.jpg,2010-02-04 06:00:04,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13687-shape-of-the-shape/,Locust,"Shape of the Shape, the second full-length by the Manchester trio Starless & Bible Black, is the kind of follow-up that prompts listeners to immediately revisit the debut, just in order to double-check that this is in fact still the same band. And yes, the personnel is the same as on the band's self-titled 2006 album, but here the group's general strategy seems to have shifted drastically. Gone, for the most part, are the debut's predominantly acoustic instruments and eclectic, Pentangle-like folk-rock. Instead, Shape of the Shape draws upon a rather weird combination of cosmic country and space-age Moog drones, resulting in a sound that is considerably more distinctive and almost wholly unexpected. After some time spent with Shape of the Shape, of course, traces of continuity do reveal themselves. The songs here are still largely centered on the dusky alto of French-born Hélène Gautier, and several tracks, such as the opening ""Say Donny Say"", have a basic structure that echoes English and Appalachian folk tradition. Beyond that, however, Starless & Bible Black take virtually every opportunity to change things up. On the debut, Raz Ullah's vintage electronics were used largely to add background accent and effect; here they are much more integrated into the proceedings, with his varied drones providing essential foundational support beneath Gautier's vocals and Peter Phillipson's bracing Telecaster. If Starless & Bible Black were not actually British, it would be fairly easy to classify several tracks here as Americana and be done with it. (The album was recorded in a village hall in the Snowdonian mountains, so apparently it comes by its rustic, panoramic vision honestly.) Following a brief electronic introduction that seems delivered straight from the BBC Radiophonic Workshop, the fractured country-rock ""Say Donny Say"" crackles like a broken telegraph line, while the drolly-titled ""Country Heir"" allows Gautier a chance at lovesick balladry. On these simpler tracks, Ullah's vintage synths often occupy the same tonal space that would traditionally belong to pedal steel, a subtle variation that enables the songs to sound at once familiar and yet vaguely alien. As the album progresses, however, these familiar landmarks become increasingly harder to spot, especially on ""Les Furies"", the album's nine-minute space/prog/country centerpiece. It's a howling whirl of Moog and country guitar, jazzy interludes, and Gautier's layered, Cocteau Twins-like vocals: suffice it to say that this is a daring piece, and it ends appropriately enough with the sound of incredulous laughter in the studio. For the occasion, Ullah really puts his full electronic arsenal to use, recalling some of Garth Hudson's crazier ""Chest Fever"" showcases with the Band, although with a decidedly artier, more European bent. Astonishing as ""Les Furies"" is, its general strangeness does risk making the rest of the album seem rather too tame in comparison. Fortunately, Starless & Bible Black have the songwriting chops to hold the listener's interest even when their sonics are more earthbound. Gautier's lyrics are elusive, in part due to the way she slips almost invisibly between French and English, but the melodic hooks on songs such as ""Your Majesty Man"" and the wistful ""Year of Dalmatians"" are substantial enough to ensure return visits. And the group even sees fit to throw in the folk-jazz instrumental ""Popty Ping"", almost as a reminder that they can still expertly go the Pentangle route when the mood suits them, although as this album illustrates they would usually prefer a path of their own invention.","Manchester band unexpectedly moves from Pentangle-like folk-rock to a weird and intriguing combination of cosmic country and space-age Moog drones.

"Sadly, the Future Is No Longer What It Once Was",Leyland Kirby,by: Mike Powell,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a82213d19756521395aa/1:1/w_160/5e0f5c11.jpg,2010-02-04 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13891-sadly-the-future-is-no-longer-what-it-once-was/,History Always Favours the Winners,"James Leyland Kirby is an artist first and a musician second, which is another way of saying that his records can be more rewarding to think about than actually listen to. But that's not a value judgment, it's a confession and disclaimer-- and, effectively, a statement of fact that you can verify by trudging through some of the prose inspired by Sadly, the Future Is No Longer What It Once Was. All the high-minded talk about Sadly is strange given how intuitive the music sounds. Where Kirby's first records (as V/VM) were little nightmares of aggression and pure provocation, Sadly-- three discs of anodyne melodies wandering through static and echo-- is all mood, composition, and performance. It might be dull music, but it's definitely music, which constitutes a radical change for a guy who once released a record filled with the sound of pigs feeding. The music on Sadly isn't ambient, or at least not how I think of ambient music. It doesn't meet the world halfway. Instead, it's a little like Charlie Brown's personal raincloud: all-encompassing, portable melancholy. Its monotony is part of the point, I think, and its consistency is one of its virtues-- sometimes I forget that it's on until it's over and I'm sitting in my room feeling lightly bummed out about something I can't describe. Kirby is situating himself in a continuum with composers like Erik Satie and Harold Budd, or groups like Deathprod-- music whose finished state sounds half-erased and feint. The conceptual thrust-- if you accept conceptual thrusts-- is a kind of faded-photograph feeling, an effort to represent loss through degraded and scraped-away sounds. The concept is ethereal, and the consistency of the product's effect can't really be guaranteed-- one person's hollowed-out futurescapes of ruined beauty is another person's bore. Kirby's sound has mellowed, but his approach-- three discs, four hours, little variation-- is still extreme. While I hear the dark undercurrents in his music, I'm not sure he's any more interested in the evocation of emotion than other abstract instrumental composers, nor am I presumptuous enough to say whether or not he's better at evoking them. Sadly is a record I admire more often and more deeply than I feel it, but I definitely admire it-- mostly because Kirby makes music of stasis that doesn't announce itself as much as it seeps. It never grates and it never bores. At worst-- or, at best, depending on which side of the concept you're on-- Kirby's music just vanishes.","Leyland Kirby, aka V/VM, creates a 3xCD set of anodyne melodies focused on mood, composition, and performance.

A Chorus of Storytellers,The Album Leaf,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a82cea9e61561daa5764/1:1/w_160/7a667e97.jpg,2010-02-04 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13901-a-chorus-of-storytellers/,Sub Pop,"Jimmy LaValle's career as the Album Leaf took off when he started opening for Sigur Rós (Jonsi produced prior albums), and since then, he's been offering a lower-stakes, more intimate take on what they've sort of perfected: a twinkling poptronica that could be arguably cast aside as new age if it weren't cut with just enough post-rock and IDM textures. It's a nice niche, but one where the floor and the ceiling can be a little too close for comfort: Over the span of four albums, collaborations, and EPs, you've come in knowing what to expect and then got just that. It's not a sound that takes a lot of risks, and thus, trying to figure out what constitutes great Album Leaf and merely more Album Leaf is splitting some incredibly thin hairs. Sure, most of Chorus is pretty, but it's only that: Between the glistening guitars, cymbal washes, sighing strings, and electric piano, the beauty LaValle conjures is effortless but ultimately less impressive for not having any sort of contrast. ""Summer Fog"" and ""Blank Pages"" swell and contract with lava-lamp hypnosis, but offer little in the way of resolution. The disembodied children's voices on ""Perro"" and mulched-up drum filtering of ""Within Dreams"" can give you a quick Boards of Canada fix, but you mostly wish it was undercut by some kind of Geogaddi menace. In complete defiance of its title, what's noticeably missing are choruses, stories, and people telling them. It's about the same ratio of vocals/instruments as albums past, but they're less frontloaded in the sequencing. As far as curveballs, you have to take what you can get. The Dave Fridmann-styled drums of ""Stand Still"" brush up against a guitar figure reminiscent of Jimmy Eat World's ""Polaris"", but it builds with the grace and fluidity of Explosions in the Sky to Chorus' most enthralling climax. ""Until the Last"" is the most interesting composition here, not so much due to texture as that it's written in 5/4. With its booming low-end and trash-can drum kit, ""We Are"" is the closest thing the Album Leaf have done to typical power-trio rock, but as rock music goes, it doesn't do much to display LaValle as an underutilized melodicist. So I guess the question becomes whether you're willing to accept A Chorus of Storytellers on its own terms-- the Album Leaf should never have to apologize for not rocking enough. LaValle never asks too much of the listener, and if you're into that sort of thing, Chorus is a fine entry into their already fine catalog.","Post-rock veterans and Sigur Rós associates continue to create twinkling, mostly instrumental music with IDM textures.

Mind Chaos,Hockey,by: Paul Thompson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a828b1335d7bf16991fd/1:1/w_160/bc6c4574.jpg,2010-02-04 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13897-mind-chaos/,Virgin,"Hockey are from Portland, but they sure sound like they're from New York. Well, they sound like a mix of popular New York sounds from the last decade-- like the precise midpoint between the Strokes and LCD Soundsystem. Now, you could of course play ""spot the influence"" as easily with the Strokes and LCD Soundsystem, but they've both been so great at reshuffling the deck, it's hard to mind when the same card keeps coming up. Hockey, too, are pretty unabashed about whose notes they're cribbing from, but unlike so many self-serious Strokesalikes and party-starting mini-Murphys, on their debut LP, Mind Chaos, Hockey seem to be having a little fun with it, keeping things casual, cracking jokes at their own expense. You'd be surprised how well it works. You need only make it to the chorus of opener ""Too Fake"" to see what I mean; it thumps and stutters to a start not unlike one of the talkier LCD tunes, ""North American Scum"" or ""Losing My Edge"", before sliding into a new wavey chorus that suggests the more sumptuous-sounding stuff from the Strokes' First Impressions of Earth. There's just no getting around it; save a little It's Blitz!-style disco sheen and some Hamilton Leithauser howl on a few of the vocals, Mind Chaos' first two-thirds keeps things chatty but clear-cut, precise but playful. Some tunes lean further to one side or the other, but until things get weird around ""Four Holy Photos"", you'd be forgiven if you thought iTunes was getting cute and snuck ""12:51"" over 45:33. Maybe it's critic-proofing (it's certainly critic-baiting), but Ben Grubin's figured a way around any accusation that he's being derivative: He just comes right out and says it himself. The first song's called ""Too Fake"" (and even this approach is derivative, specifically of MGMT's bow ""Time to Pretend""). But it's the knockout single ""Song Away"" that finds Rubin at his most egregiously self-effacing; ""I stole my personality from an anonymous source,"" he claims on his ""truthful song over an 80s groove,"" and then, talking about himself, he's ""ahead of his time... if only he could prove it."" All through the album, aside after amusing aside, Rubin paints himself as a clever kid with a knack for synthesizing smart ideas (mostly other people's) into something enjoyably breezy, well aware neither he nor his band are reinventing the wheel. It can feel impersonal and winking, having this guy defining himself against things rather than just expressing himself. But given the cloud of mope that surrounded so many Strokes acolytes in the earlier part of the last decade and the not-as-incisive-as-they-think stance of most post-LCD lyrics-as-commentary, Rubin's just seems to be having a laugh, and when he says stuff like, ""everybody's making dance music, true, but we started in 2002,"" on his debut record, you may well chuckle along. Of course, none of this would work without hooks to hang all the chatter on, and Hockey have quite a few; the blushing ""Work"" has shades of Phoenix at their more Strokes-like; ""Curse This City"" smacks of post-fame the Rapture; and ""3AM Spanish"" comes across like Blondie at their most in tune to hip-hop. It gets a bit dicey around gentle honky-talker ""Four Holy Photos""; from then on, the sharp aesthetic on loan gets turned in, and we're treated to a mixed bag of not-quite-there ideas that pales next to the bright lights of the big city chatterpop that precedes it. It feels like Hockey struggling a bit to carve out their own sound, as the songs around the back end do get more eclectic, a bit squigglier, a little harder to triangulate, cut with less humor, and a lot less good for it. They oughtn't have felt the need; the vintage threads of their forebears fit them so much better.","Portland buzz band sounds like NYC 00s buzz bands-- specifically, like the precise midpoint between the Strokes and LCD Soundsystem.

Rebirth,Lil Wayne,by: Ryan Dombal,Features Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a486b1335d7bf16989ab/1:1/w_160/ecdcf6f1.jpg,2010-02-04 06:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13116-rebirth/,Cash MoneyUniversal MotownYoung Money Entertainment,"It could be worse. ""Everybody say they just do it, well, I just don't,"" claims Lil Wayne on Rebirth, his unlikely, unqualified, and quite unbelievable rock album. And he's speaking the truth: This album is not the logical official follow-up to 2008's best-selling Tha Carter III. At all. In any way. For that, he deserves credit. Considering Wayne is a man whose artistic aims apparently involve 1) Collecting oil-tycoon cash, 2) Having sex with several women at once, and 3) Concocting the world's finest excrement-related rhymes, Rebirth is most definitely a flop, terribly unsexy, and contains surprisingly few shit jokes. Wayne is playing against type here. ""When I play sick, I'm Jordan with the flu,"" he boasts on the album, referring to Jordan's classic game against the Jazz. And in general, that's true; but here Wayne is like Mike with pneumonia and a broken leg... playing baseball. In the mid 1980s, Run-D.M.C. used distorted guitars and stadium-rock drums to help break hip-hop into the mainstream. Now, one of the world's biggest rappers is using the same tools to make a niche record only a diehard could truly love. That flip says as much about hip-hop's current state of evolution (shaky) as it does about Lil Wayne's current commercial predicament. Although his recent mixtape was dubbed No Ceilings, the pressure of success and the idea that he'll never top the million-in-a-week phenomenon that was Tha Carter III is naturally weighing on Wayne. He may never have a single as big as ""Lollipop"" or reach the level of universal relevancy to warrant another prime time interview with Katie Couric. He seems to realize this on Rebirth. ""Call me crazy, I've been called worse/ It's like I have it all, but what's it all worth?"" asks Wayne on ""Paradice"", a Miltonian epic about the trappings of super stardom that aims for Axl Rose, Use Your Illusion-style heights. The closest he comes to an answer to that question is on ""Drop the World"", where he combats paranoia by threatening to ""pick the world up and drop it on your fuckin' head!"" It's a hilarious image that would serve as an incredible exaggerated parody of Linkin Park angst if the song wasn't dead serious-- a fact confirmed by a martyr-me guest shot from Eminem, who himself still sounds like he's coming to grips with the fact that he'll never be as famous as he once was. ""Drop the World"" also contains another key lyric from Wayne: ""The spot get smaller and I get bigger/ Tryin' to get in where I fit in, no room for a nigga."" The lines hint at the notion of Rebirth being something of a cop-out, i.e., if he can't top himself, he's just going to scratch away everything that makes him great. So instead of rapping we get gurgled Auto-Tune chirps and squeals that often nullify his one-in-a-billion elastic croak. Instead of next-level clever punchlines-inside-of-punchlines we get pure high-school inanity or swear parades deserving of a soapy mouthwash. According to Wayne, rock music combines the coked-out idiocy of Sunset Strip hair metal with the processed rage of Bizkit-ed headbanging. Understandably, the combination can be abhorrent. The choice to cannibalize two of rock's least respectable styles against each other makes zero sense, and is especially surprising from someone obsessed with André 3000, whose similarly risky 2003 genre switch up, The Love Below, wisely borrowed from Prince more than Evanescence. But even with Rebirth's crushing lows-- and Wayne's imminent jail sentence thanks to a guilty plea on attempted gun possession charges-- there is little reason to doubt the 27-year-old's future as an enterprising, Grammy-highlighting superstar of the most esteemed set. ""Confidence is the stain they can't wipe off,"" he says on the record, and he's right. A big part of his magnetism relies on unpredictability and his willingness to reside in a personal realm where trends, gimmicks, and gravity are of little concern. In that more ideological and less critical mindset, Rebirth is an oddball win. His still-impressive productivity rate also cushions the blow-- thanks to No Ceilings, we know the guy's rapping abilities are still sharp. And, on the same day Rebirth saw release, Wayne also put out a brand new non-album cut called ""Fuck Today"" that combines rap and rock with more aplomb than anything on the new LP. The track is diabolical and political, recalling Ice Cube in his early-90s prime. And it makes you think the proposition of a Rebirth II might not be so awful. I mean, it could be better.","He really went ahead and did it: Lil Wayne finally releases his unlikely, unqualified, and quite unbelievable rock album.

Leaving on a Mayday,Anna Ternheim,by: Matthew Solarski,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a821c0084474cd0c0d6e/1:1/w_160/547adc87.jpg,2010-02-03 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13889-leaving-on-a-mayday/,Verve Forecast,"Leaving on a Mayday was produced by Peter Bjorn and John's Björn Yttling, and features contributions from Steve Shelley (Sonic Youth) and Matt Sweeney (Chavez, Zwan, Superwolf), but don't let that fool you: This is not an ""indie"" record, at least not in the sense of indie as synonymous with low recording budgets, foregrounded quirks and idiosyncrasies, and a quality of endearing amateurishness. And yet... the Universal Records logo on back and a bevy of Swedish Grammys on Anna Ternheim's mantle can be just as misleading. Sweden-born NYC transplant Ternheim tows a fine line, one that leaves her at a crossroads between the cult notoriety of the underground and the expertly branded saturation of the mainstream. Depending on who's handling her, she could just as well be a scrappier, moodier Sarah McLachlan or the sophisticated big sister to whichever indie semi-starlet is in these days. It's fitting, then, that Ternheim's first U.S. LP (which collected highlights from her two Grammis-winning Swedish albums and a couple of EPs) bears the title Halfway to Fivepoints, or, if you will, Halfway to Stardom. Ternheim is much further along to fame in her native land, where Leaving on a Mayday earned her Best Album honors at last year's Swedish Grammis. It's easy enough to see why. Somebody Outside (Ternheim's 2004 debut) had some great moments-- sad-eyed opener ""To Be Gone"", the stirring ""My Secret"", and a heart-wrenching piano ballad cover of ""Shoreline""-- but was unmemorable in parts and uneven on the whole. Follow-up Separation Road (2006) boasted improved songwriting and lavish production, but at times all those strings and embellishments threatened to overpower Ternheim, something she herself implicitly acknowledged by including a second disc of pared down ""Naked Versions"" with deluxe copies of the LP. Mayday, however, is the record that gets it right. More consistent and more refined, it acutely spotlights the often understated talents of Ternheim as both a vocalist and songwriter. It's also less immediate than its predecessors, and takes a few listens to reveal its hidden beauty. Until that point Mayday can sound a little typical, much like its song titles (""Off the Road"", ""Losing You"", ""Summer Rain"") and recurrent themes (desire, heartbreak, moving on). Less typical is Ternheim's treatment of these common songwriting tropes. Pay close attention to the lyrics and you'll find even the most potentially joyous of moments is shot through with a Swedish sense of melancholy, very much of a tradition that stretches from August Strindberg to Ingmar Bergman to Victoria Bergsman. The innocent infatuation of a line like ""I hope you feel the way I do,"" on opener ""What Have I Done"", is soon followed with the wizened resignation of ""I'm damned to feel the way I do""-- this is an artist who has been through all of this enough times before to know what she's getting herself into, and rather than celebrate new love she's lamenting her powerlessness in the face of it. As the record unfolds, this lack of control, whether in managing desire or preventing heartbreak, takes on the characteristics of addiction and fixation. ""What keeps you from moving, are you afraid to be loved?"" she prompts on ""Damaged Ones"". ""See how my hands shake? I was raised on it like a drug."" Elsewhere, on ""Terrified"", she speaks of ""the beast in me,"" while ""Losing You"", musically the record's most single-ready track, is not about the relationship on the rocks its title might suggest but rather a loved one's apparent descent into senility. Tough stuff, but it comes in a refreshing musical package that shifts the focus from the dark and wounded. Also helpful are quiet and stately moments like the vaguely East Asian-flavored ""Terrified"", delicate slowburner ""My Heart Still Beats for You"", and the desert raga ""Off the Road"", which features the finger-picking prowess of Sweeney. ""Summer Rain"" strips things down even further and may be the record's most rewarding moment, a loss-of-faith lament that makes the most of a strummed acoustic guitar and gorgeous vocal harmonies. Whether it will all translate to Stateside success for Ternheim probably comes down to a question of exposure. A recent Chicago show, where a solo Ternheim was the first of three acts, proved that she can hold a crowd enrapt-- even one that is not necessarily familiar with her music. But the key for this talent may well be to break free of the trappings of an insular indie scene, land an opening spot on some Starbucks darling's auditorium tour, and pray for that one crucial season finale/closing credits song placement. It's not selling out if it's where you were meant to be all along.","Swedish star takes another stab at the U.S. market with her third LP.

You & Me,Kevin Barker,by: Matthew Murphy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a81fc0084474cd0c0d6a/1:1/w_160/4e1915d5.jpg,2010-02-03 06:00:03,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13890-you-me/,Gnomonsong,"You & Me is the first album credited to singer/guitarist Kevin Barker, but it feels rather strange to call it his debut. He has previously recorded several albums with his long-running project Currituck County, and as a sideman-for-hire he has performed with an impressive array of talents, including Joanna Newsom, Vashti Bunyan, and Antony and the Johnsons. Yet for better or worse the gig that seems to have most impacted Barker is touring and recording with Andy Cabic in Vetiver, and You & Me almost seamlessly continues Vetiver's trail through the rustic backwoods of dazed Americana. One doesn't build a discography like Barker's without being awfully good at playing an instrument, and You & Me is rife with evidence of Barker's expressive skill on both electric and acoustic guitar. His vocal style is clean and laid-back, recalling Cabic certainly, but also with tints of a more grounded Sam Beam or even a young Jackson Browne. Produced by Vetiver vet Thom Monahan and featuring contributions from such cohorts as Newsom (on keyboards), Wilco's Pat Sansone, and drummer Otto Hauser, the album exudes an undeniable sense of warmth and general bonhomie. The hitch, however, is that Barker's likable presence is not enough to rescue some of these songs, and as a result You & Me soon becomes an album that listeners may find themselves wanting to like more than they actually do. Considerably more song-oriented than Barker's abstract, improvisational work in Currituck County, the album suffers from too many songs that cross the thin line separating the loose and carefree from the downright sluggish. At times Barker can seem so lackadaisical that his lyrics sound as though they might have been made up on the spot. Yet-- typical of an album produced by Monahan-- You & Me is impeccably recorded and filled with subtle, striking instrumental details. The album's press materials reference the Grateful Dead, a comparison that is neither entirely accurate nor especially useful, but, as with the Dead's studio albums, Barker and his group use the simple tunes of ""Amber"" and ""Mountain & Bear"" as a handy excuse for some tasteful jamming. A skillful finger-picker, Barker sticks predominantly with electric guitar here, although he does crack out the acoustic on the sprightly country folk of ""My Lady"" and on the riveting closer ""Bless You on Your Way"" which is further enlivened by a string section. Nearly every song here falls into the easy ambling gait that should be familiar to anyone who has heard Vetiver, a fact that Barker further reinforces by titling one track ""Walking Along"". (And you get bonus credit if you've also guessed that he's ""walking along and singing my song."") This uniformity of tone and tempo understandably causes You & Me to wilt through its middle stretches despite its relatively brief running time. The downloadable version of the album does include three extra tracks, one of which, ""Ten Toes to Sister Sky"" seems more immediately dynamic and engaging than just about anything on the album proper, and hopefully offers a suggestion that perhaps Barker's future travels will investigate territory that's a bit more rugged.","Freak folk linchpin, who counts Currituck County and Vetiver among his projects, releases his first LP under his own name.

"Tumbélé! Biguine, Afro and Latin Sounds From The French Caribbean, 1963-1974",Various Artists,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a672ea9e61561daa5383/1:1/w_160/b9e30839.jpg,2010-02-03 06:00:02,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13538-tumbele-biguine-afro-and-latin-sounds-from-the-french-caribbean-1963-1974/,Soundway,"It's fair to say that Western interest in African popular music from the 1960s and 70s has exploded over last 10 years. During this stretch, there's been an onslaught of incredible reissues and compilations, mostly from British and European labels. If there's anything this frenzy of rediscovery has shown, it's that we've only scratched the surface of the incredible amount of music that came out of that continent in those two decades. Perhaps because there's so much great music to explore in Africa, there's been less reissue attention paid to the musically and culturally related styles of the Latin Caribbean. But it seems to be happening in earnest now after a bit of a lag. Britain-based Soundway helped spearhead our dive into vintage Afro styles with its incredible series of Ghanaian and Nigerian funk, rock, soul, highlife, and disco compilations. A few years ago, it started hitting tropical sounds in the Western Hemisphere with stops in Colombia and Panama (the Panama! series picked up again last year with two more excellent volumes). Tumbélé! takes the label to the French islands of Martinique and Guadeloupe for a deep plunge into the relatively unexplored waters of the popular sounds of the Lesser Antilles. The disc steers mostly away from heavily funk- and soul-influenced sounds in favor of styles with more audible links to the biguine, bélé, and gwo ka music of the islands. Gwo ka and bélé are traditional rural styles of Guadeloupe and Martinique, respectively, built around drumming and vocal call-and-response. Both reflect the islands' history with slavery and forced migration, while biguine is more urbane, tracing its roots to a 19th Century synthesis of bélé rhythms and brass-led polka by black musicians in Martinique. Those elements lie at the heart of all the music included on this compilation, and over the course of its 20 tracks, you'll hear them cross-pollinated with Congolese rumba, Cuban guaguanco, Haitian compas, Trinidadian calypso, American and French hot jazz, Puerto Rican, plena and even a bit of proto-boogaloo, often to thrilling effect. The compilation launches with an abrupt cold start that quickly turns very, very hot. The rhythm section and horns all drop in together on the very first beat of Barel Coppet et Mister Lof's ""Jeunesse Vauclin"", the sax and clarinet weaving tightly in unison through the bounding rhythms and hand drums. The song is sweet and naturally funky, a description that could apply to almost all these selections. Some of the outside influences on French Antillean music of the period can be heard directly on inspired selections from Haitian and Congolese acts. Haiti's Les Loups Noirs recorded the appropriately propulsive ""Jet Biguine"", with its psyched-out surf guitar leads, during a stay in Martinique, and it's emblematic of the Haitian small group sounds that influenced a move away from larger ensembles in the islands during the 60s. Congo's Ry-Co Jazz spent four years in Martinique and Guadeloupe, bringing the Caribbean influence that birthed Central African rumba full circle to create the tumbélé style-- their ""Dima Bolane"" is crazily percussive, balancing frenzied drumming against a slow bass figure and sweetly melodic harmony vocals and sax. There's more wild drumming where that came from, too. Anzala, Dolor, Velo offer fairly straight gwo ka on ""Ti Fi La Ou Te Madam'"", chanting over hard percussion-- their only concession to urban sounds is a fierce saxophone part that twists around the vocals with amazing dexterity. L'Orchestre Jeunesse de Paul-Emile Haliar cast traditional drums in a more modern context on 1963's ""La Vie Critique"", splattering a sax and clarinet-driven biguine with strong jazz overtones with sonorous outbursts of heavy timbale. Jazz is far more up front on the track by Orchestre Combo Zombi, which sounds like it could have knocked an audience at the Paris Hot Club flat on its back. The piano solo is astonishing. Other stylistic combinations are farther out. Les Kings are overt about it: they cover a Puerto Rican bomba track pretty faithfully, but one of their trumpet players cleverly interpolates Antonio Machin's Cuban classic ""El Manisero"" as if to telegraph the band's diverse inspirations. The Caribbean has long been and likely long will be a melting pot. Martinique and Guadeloupe's direct ties to Europe and Africa (via France) and proximity to other Caribbean cultures and sounds made the islands an ideal crucible for imaginative combinations of styles old and new. You can hear the crosscurrents in the electric guitar parts, clarinet solos, intense drumming, and diverse vocal styles on this disc. As we in Europe and North America acclimate to the music of the tropics we once ignored, it makes sense that we'll gradually move away from the comfortable styles with direct rock, soul, and funk influences to find something more purely representative of the places and times we tour through old records. This compilation is a great starting point.","The Soundway label offers a primer on the musical crosscurrents found in Martinique and Guadeloupe.

Ugly Side of Love,Malachai,by: Stuart Berman,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a8089d034d5c69bf3940/1:1/w_160/522b9393.jpg,2010-02-03 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13867-ugly-side-of-love/,DominoInvada,"""I know what I want/ I want off this roundabout!"" Given Malachai's apparent fondness for turn-of-the-1970s British music-- Badfinger, schmaltzy AM-radio pop, or the grainy reggae imported by England's Jamaican immigrant class-- this lyric from the masked Bristol duo's debut could very well just be a colloquial reference to traffic congestion on UK motorways. But the manic, cut-and-paste aesthetic that members Gee Ealey and Scott Hendy exhibit on Ugly Side of Love also suggests that the lyric could be a rejection of the (re)cyclical nature of rock, what with the 80s post-punk resurrection that informed so much indie over the past decade now yielding to 90s alt-rock revivalism, like clockwork. For a band like Malachai, who are more interested in toying with unfashionable pop arcana than conforming to hipster-baiting trends, it's hard to tell what's more wearisome: the prevalence of genre-centric nostalgia, or the fact that it recurs at such predictable intervals. Now, Malachai-- previously Malakai, before a namesake California rapper claimed legal dibs on the ""k""-- are hardly ones to present themselves as futurists; Ugly Side of Love seems deliberately designed to evoke the dusty-grooved ambience and freewheeling feel of a UK pirate-radio broadcast from 1973. But unlike so many Britpop bands who tried to recapture the spirit of a bygone era by writing and performing songs that sound like their favorite albums, Ealey and Hendy simply take the posturing out of the equation altogether and just sample them wholesale. Ugly Side of Love is thus a rock album pieced together by crate-diggers, one that's eager to undercut notions of authenticity to emphasize its own pastiche quality with obvious samples and abrupt edits. Surprisingly, the liners list only two sample sources, one of them 70s-era UK crooner Daniel Boone's ""Sad and Lonely Lady"" being repurposed on the boogie-rock stomper ""Snowflake"". But there's clearly so much more where that came from: ""How Long"" loops the Guess Who's 1970 single ""Hand Me Down World"" into a piece of hand-me-down rock that deviously cuts its sample off mid-guitar-lick; ""Shitkicker"" revs up on a riff reminiscent of Heart's Camaro classic ""Barracuda"" before sling-shooting back on a cavalcade of incessant handclaps, Gee's double-tracked harmonies and, of course, more cowbell; the reggafied rumble ""Warriors"" not only name-checks the 1979 gang flick, it uses the film's climactic, bottle-plinking ""come and out play"" taunt as its hook. But Ugly Side of Love is more than just the sum of Malachai's dollar-bin finds. In Gee, they boast an elastic vocalist who perfectly embodies band's mischievous approach, yielding performances that are by turns sinister (the mutant acid-rocker ""Blackbird"") and heart-on-sleeve sweet (the bubblegum-soul serenade ""Another Sun""). Ironically, it's his least affected performance that feels the most forced, with the clap-along campfire jam ""Moonsurfin'"" coming off like a commercial jingle (""Now it's here/ Grab a beer!"") pitched at trustafarians. Considering Malachai's Bristol roots and flair for sample-based recontextualization, it's no surprise that the duo has found a champion/mentor in Portishead's Geoff Barrow, who first issued the album last year on his Invada imprint and served as its ""executive producer."" Indeed, the sole Barrow co-write, ""Only For You"", carries heavy, cannabis-infused whiffs of Portishead's film-noir funk. But Malachai are actually most reminiscent of Clinic, another shadowy outfit who debuted on Domino some 10 years ago. The latter tapped more canonical cult-rock sources like the Velvet Underground and Sparks, but exhibited a similar adeptness at processing and repackaging disparate reference points into seemingly familiar yet freakishly alien two-minute pop songs. And if, like Clinic, Malachai are too respectful of their retro sources to fully veer off the rock'n'roll roundabout, Ugly Side of Love nonetheless revisits a moment in British pop history through a series of surprising U-turns and thrillingly illegal lane changes.","The Bristol duo championed by Portishead's Geoff Barrow indulge in sample-heavy pop that seems pulled from a UK pirate-radio broadcast from 1973.

The Courage of Others,Midlake,by: Paul Thompson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a81bea9e61561daa573a/1:1/w_160/c2636dcc.jpg,2010-02-03 06:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13885-the-courage-of-others/,Bella Union,"In the middle of 2006, Midlake released The Trials of Van Occupanther, a record of Ren Faire-infused folk-pop shot through with a healthy dose of post-blues, pre-bitterness Fleetwood Mac. Van Occupanther was full of small delights and the occasional major triumph. Its charms were subtle; occasionally a shimmering melodic flourish or a shade in singer Tim Smith's earthy throat would float into the mix and really knock you out. Though it dragged a touch toward the end and sometimes felt a bit self-satisfied in its smoothness, it was a pleaser and-- because it moved them light years beyond the gooey Grandaddy-lite of their debut without much apparent effort-- seemed to promise good stuff on the bound. At long last, we have The Courage of Others, reportedly the product of the perennial touring band's newfound obsession with the British folk of Pentangle, Fairport Convention, and the like. It was, they've said in interviews, an attempt to distance themselves from Van Occupanther, which is understandable; after three and a half years of touring behind a record, ripping it up and starting again is what you do. But there were shades of the kind of British folk they're talking about all over Van Occupanther; fewer flutes, maybe, but the same sort of compositional fussiness and hushed, dulcet tones matched with rich harmonies. And they were, virtually without exception, woven together into far better songs. Van Occupanther, low-key though it was, kept the arrangements frothy and dynamic, the tunes multifaceted and sweeping, the playing precise but limber. The Courage of Others is a step down on songcraft, atmosphere, and apparently, even self-awareness: If you're trying to distance yourself from something, you wouldn't plunge headfirst into it, would you? Without calling too much attention to it, Van Occupanter swayed and squirmed, and as a result of this constant shift, songs rarely ended up where they started. Save the occasional flittery fingerpicked intro, the tunes on The Courage of Others take up the same languid, near-narcotic pace, and they stick with it. Van Occupanther's best songs seemed to match up a couple of disparate ideas and found ways to slowly lead one toward the other-- the prim verse melody of ""We Gathered in Spring"" didn't seem an easy fit with that song's gooey choral descent, but they patiently bring the two together, and the resulting payoff lent the lovely but lethargic tune some drama. There are no stakes like that with the Courage songs, no sense that things might fly off into uncharted territory. Theirs is an exceptionally polite reading of these British folk constructions, and as nearly every tune tumbles through its ornate intro, its hushed first verse, and the minor lift of its chorus, your patience wears as thin as the tunes. It's no help that Smith, never the most expressive vocalist, sounds at times uninterested; his vocal melodies have gotten simpler to match the music, but he himself seems detached, delivering every line with the kind of passion you might reserve for courtesy calls. Lyrically, Van Occupanther's man-out-of-time treatments of honor and family were admirably antiquated, but while Courage picks up Occupanther's naturalistic bent, it lacks a thesis to tie it all together. That, I suppose, it leaves to the all-too-similar execution. With precious little exception, these songs are just so wispy, and the band's treatment of them so delicate, it turns Courage into a museum piece, stuffy, bloodless. A lot of those Britfolk cats were really hot players and there's not even that to hold onto; every performance is a few notches above adequate, but there's no bite to any of it, no intensity, precious little conveyance of emotion. I wish there were a single great song, one shining moment to point to as a beacon of hope for what's to come for these guys, but Courage just feels so monochromatic, so flatlined, even the tiniest signs of life have no power to resuscitate.","The recent breakout band follows its delightful 2006 album, The Trials of Van Occupanther, with a long-awaited new folk-pop record.

Ommatidia,Nmperign,by: Marc Masters,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a79913d1975652139455/1:1/w_160/fee55a80.jpg,2010-02-02 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13776-ommatidia/,Intransitive,"""You can look at any individual note in a melodic phrase and fit it into countless harmonic possibilities,"" the Boston-based improv duo Nmperign told Foxy Digitalis recently. ""If you look at three notes, there are fewer possibilities. Twelve notes, far fewer."" The pair was discussing Ornette Coleman's ""harmolodics,"" but that more-is-less philosophy also fits Nmperign's music. Trumpeter Greg Kelley and soprano saxophonist Bhob Rainey deal primarily in slow, sparse sounds-- sounds that approach, and sometimes achieve, total silence. By treating each moment as an opportunity rather than just another stepping stone, they give all their squeaks, breaths, and noises a tension that hectic music usually avoids. Over the past decade or so, this kind of improvisation has been called many things-- reductionism, lowercase music, laminal music, ""the new silence."" And those labels have been slapped on everyone from Spanish sound artist Mattin to British bassist Mark Wastell, to American drummer Sean Meehan, to the wealth of fine musicians on the Erstwhile label. Since most of these artists are free improvisers, open to all sounds and styles, it's not surprising that they often bristle at these labels-- Mattin and Wastell even made a record in 2006 called Reductionism Is Dead. Still, if all of this constitutes even a loose genre, Nmperign are surely amongst its leaders. In the decade-plus that they've played together, Kelley and Rainey have partnered with many like-minded musicians-- experimental sound artists Jason Lescaleet, Günter Müller, Alex Dörner-- as well as rock-leaning colleagues like Akron/Family and Damon & Naomi. In fact, they've been so busy with collaborations that this is the first studio album made by themselves. But it's no debut-- every second here shows how the pair's sonic communication has become as natural as spoken language. Exactly what makes up their language is hard to pin down. It's easy enough to catalog all the nouns and verbs and see Ommatidia simply as a collection of tones, growls, and shrieks. But it's the sentences-- the way Kelley and Rainey arrange sounds and silences into commas and periods-- that produce magic. Some moments do capture the whole-- take the interlocking tones at the end of opener ""Glass"", the bursts of blare that cut hard to silence in ""Prey"", the windy whistling in ""Variations V"". But none of those moments would be as effective without what comes before and after. And though Nmperign's open approach makes everything spontaneous, you'll be surprised by how logical and structured it can all sound. Of course, logic and structure here are relative terms-- in the context of all music, Nmperign's is an acquired taste. Even if you know this style well, you have to switch mental modes to fully absorb it. Put Ommatidia on as background, and its bursts of activity might cut through, but you'll miss a lot of it, too. Engage directly, though, and Kelley and Rainey's menagerie of sounds become more fascinating the closer you zoom in. In fact, maybe we should call Nmperign ""expansionist."" Their music may seem ""reductionist,"" but its effect-– they way it increases your attention and expands your senses-- is far from minimal.","Boston improv duo deals primarily in slow, sparse sounds-- a form of improvisation known as reductionism-- but the effect is far from minimal.

Rifts,Oneohtrix Point Never,by: Joe Colly,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a8209d034d5c69bf397a/1:1/w_160/eb50f14e.jpg,2010-02-02 06:00:03,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13896-rifts/,No Fun,"Though it sometimes feels like drone music will be forever relegated to the fringes of the indie world, an impressive batch of bands and labels have sprung up recently to counter that idea. Alongside bigger acts such as Sunn O))) and Grouper (not true drone, but plenty drone-y), artists like Emeralds, Black to Comm, and Yellow Swans are each tugging the style into intriguing directions. Daniel Lopatin, who records as Oneohtrix Point Never and shares a label with Emeralds, could plausibly be lumped into this group but also exists outside of it. Where others bring to bear a wide range of instrumentation in creating these glistening, open-ended sounds, Lopatin does so using only electronics (synthesizers and arpeggiators, primarily) and as a result, his music is arguably more distinctive and often more difficult to pin down. Because he's worked outside the label structure and released albums on limited-run cassette and CD-R until now, Lopatin's music also hasn't been easy to find. But Rifts, a 2xCD collection of his material since 2003 (including all three Oneohtrix Point Never full-lengths-- Betrayed in the Octagon, Zones Without People, and Russian Mind), seeks to correct that by compiling just about everything he's recorded as OPN to date. At two and a half hours long, it's a dizzying amount of music and virtually impossible to absorb in one sitting but for anyone with a passing interest in drone or ambient music, it's worth setting aside the time. Part of the reason Rifts feels like a crucial listen is that Lopatin's approach is so thoroughly his own, to the point that trying to attach it to one genre doesn't really work. At turns icy and serene, at others frenetic and twisted, it feels like a modern sci-fi remake of minimalism and kosmiche-- there are long, repetitious builds with big openings between notes that suggest vast space and long drift. Intricate synth arrangements unfurl over long stretches in tracks like ""Immanence"" and ""Ships Without Meaning"" to create a sense of endless glide. In this capacity, Lopatin proves he can reconstruct drone on his own terms, but on Rifts' more forceful, tech-y songs he shows that's not the only trick up his sleeve. The three LPs joined together in Rifts were supposedly intended as a trilogy, and while they do work as a unified whole, it seems wisest to approach the record as a compilation. The sheer size of it is daunting and you don't lose much by listening to its separate movements individually. Within these smaller pieces, Lopatin oscillates between the long-form mechanized whir described above and shorter tracks that push the album forward and draw back your attention after lengthy drifts. More Blade Runner than 2001: A Space Odyssey, ""Computer Vision"" and ""Betrayed in the Octagon"" use chopped-up, rapid-fire synths for propulsion and quick tonal shifts to add color. This is precisely the kind of music some would criticize as robotic and unfeeling, but for such heavily computerized sounds, Lopatin also shows a way with mood-- a song like ""A Pact Between Strangers"" is dark and threatening, like walking into a strange home with all the lights off. But maybe what's most impressive about Rifts is that Lopatin creates a singular kind of noise-- there just aren't many albums out there that sound like this-- and rides it for nearly three hours without repeating himself very often. In this sense, the recent LP it reminds me of is Dâm-Funk's Toeachizown, in that the vibe is inseparable from the artist, clearly the work of one person with a novel agenda and the chops to see it through to the finish. And like Dâm-Funk's, it's the type of music that doesn't knock you over the head at first, but sort of seeps into your pores over time, uncovering new pleasures when you inevitably come back for more.","One of a handful of new artists making exquisitely crafted, ear-opening forays into drone collects his limited-run output onto a 2xCD set.

Paper Dolls,The Brunettes,by: Matthew Perpetua,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a81eb1335d7bf16991e0/1:1/w_160/d7b2daba.jpg,2010-02-02 06:00:02,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13888-paper-dolls/,Lil' Chief,"There's something creepy about the Brunettes' music, and it's hard to tell whether it's entirely intentional. The most obviously unnerving thing about the duo is its vocal dynamic: Jonathan Bree has a droll, modestly handsome voice that brings to mind a bookish dude in his thirties, and Heather Mansfield is chirpy, perky, and seldom sounds a day over 14. Mansfield's little-girl act is a deliberate affectation, and their music is very much part of a long tradition of twee indie pop that knowingly mingles adult sexuality with a playful, innocent tone. This is very self-aware music, but nevertheless it gets kinda tricky to figure out when the Brunettes are making the subtext in the contrast of their voices the hook of their music, or when they're just doing cutesy songs for the sake of it. The age dynamic isn't the only unusual tension on the Auckland, New Zealand-based duo's fourth album, Paper Dolls. As on their previous records, their compositions strike an odd balance of child-like singsong simplicity and subtle sophistication. Any time the group start to sound overly naive and artless, there is some kind of musical curveball thrown in to keep things from getting too flat and predictable. You wouldn't want to call any of these tracks complex, but Bree and Mansfield consistently add welcome dimension to songs that could easily come across as dumb and fluffy. This is a good thing, but the negative side effect is that this tendency flattens out the tone of the record as a whole. As much as whimsical tracks like ""Red Rollerskates"" and ""In Colours"" benefit from a bit of musical depth, the relatively mature electronic aesthetics of ""Bedroom Disco"" and ""Connection"" get muffled by their insistence on being adorable, making those songs sound like a preschool version of Broadcast circa Tender Buttons. Even the most enjoyable tracks here are cloying, and their best ideas are just things we've heard before in an indie marketplace choked with the twee sensibility. To be clear, there's nothing wrong with being cute, and the Lolita thing is generally done in interesting rather than off-putting ways. The problem with Paper Dolls is that, even though the Brunettes have set up some potentially intriguing contrasts, they never fully investigate the tensions in their music. ""If I"", a corny ballad near the end of the album, has Mansfield talking down to Bree's schmaltzy sentimentality-- ""If I should accidentally die and leave you much too soon, would you play and sing our songs the same with somebody new?""-- but that's as close as they come to subverting their dynamic, or even commenting on it in an overt way. It may be unfair to complain that a band is not sufficiently meta, but all the same, this is self-consciously clever music that is too shy to make any sort of point. These songs, especially ""Magic (No Bunny)"" and the Bis-esque ""The Crime Machine"", can work on a superficial level, but there's really not much else here. Bree and Mansfield have perfected their style, but they've come up very short on content.","New Zealand-based indie pop duo continues to strike an odd balance of child-like singsong simplicity and subtle sophistication.

The House of Love / The German Album,The House of Love,by: Joshua Klein,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a7f79d034d5c69bf3922/1:1/w_160/932b9e70.gif,2010-02-02 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13853-the-house-of-love-the-german-album/,Arena Rock,"In theory, talent and time should be all it takes to break a band, but everyone knows making music is not a simple meritocracy. If it were, a band like the House of Love would have fared better. An early jewel in the Creation Records crown, the House of Love seemed poised for a breakthrough that never happened. They had great songs, they had a great sound, they had buzz, but in the end it all wound up as little more than the foundation for a fervent cult following. Much belated U.S. issues of the band's self-titled 1988 debut and its originally Germany-only singles compilation companion (also self-titled, confusingly, but since dubbed The German Album) won't do anything to alter the group's fate any more than its excellent 2005 reunion Days Run Away did, but with the essential 1986-88: The Creation Recordings (which contained the entirety of those formative album tracks and singles) out of print, their arrival is still much appreciated. Like a lot of bands of their vintage, the House of Love looked back to the 1960s while veiling their music in such contemporary trappings as reverb-drenched guitars, trebly production, and the occasional squall of noise. Arriving at the tail end of the Smiths but before the Madchester boom, the London band hearkened back to the moody early-80s atmospherics of Echo and the Bunnymen and the Chameleons. Guy Chadwick was such a strong writer, and guitarist Terry Bickers such a complementary foil, that in a lot of ways their music hangs in the air, rootless and mysterious-- a status only enhanced by all those years ""lost."" (In the beginning there was also third guitarist/vocalist Andrea Heukamp.) The four singles and B-sides contained on The German Album find the band on fire; songs such as ""Shine On"", ""Nothing to Me"", ""The Hedonist"", ""Blind"", ""Love"", ""Destroy the Heart"" and the stripped down ""Loneliness is the Gun"" would make any impressionable youth worth his weight want to start a band. By the debut Heukamp was out, but she stuck around to help record ""Christine"", one of those classic side one/track one songs that showed the singles were no fluke. Once again, all the tracks are impressively strong, ""dodgy lyrics"" (Chadwick's words, in the liners) and all, with highlights the very Echo-y ""Road"", the chugging ""Sulphur"" and ""Happy"", the shimmering ""Man to Child"" and ""Love in a Car"", and the raging ""Salome"". Admittedly, it's easy in retrospect, knowing the UK trends lying in wait just around the corner, to see why the band's days were numbered. The House of Love's fate was further sealed by the departure of Bickers and a premature departure from Creation (never mind that its subsequent Fontana debut-- also self-titled-- was pretty good). Even listened to with the group's early demise in mind, these reissues capture something fleeting but special, the lightning-in-a-bottle sense of so much promise, not exactly promise squandered but all the same perhaps promise never fully unleashed.","One of modern rock's great should-have-been bands has its two Creation Records LPs reissued in the U.S.

Couple Tracks,Fucked Up,by: Douglas Wolk,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a7ff9d034d5c69bf3932/1:1/w_160/f9a69138.jpg,2010-02-02 06:00:00,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13860-couple-tracks/,Matador,"Fucked Up are arguably the best hardcore album band of at least the last 20 years-- the Toronto sextet's Hidden World and The Chemistry of Common Life both manage the nearly impossible feat of keeping a piledriver punk-rock assault compelling for more than 45 minutes straight. In practice, though, they're more of a singles act. Since 2002, they've released a few dozen 7"" and 12"" singles, usually in ""collectible"" quantities. So this isn't a follow-up to Chemistry: It's their second singles compilation, and like the first one, Epics in Minutes, it's thoroughly disorderly. This one begins with their debut single, the not-quite-there-yet ""No Pasaran"", then leapfrogs around their career, encompassing a handful of A-sides, B-sides, and demos, as well as a 2008 Daytrotter session. Despite its nonchronological sequencing and song-cherrypicking, it never really comes together as an album; it's more like ""the many moods of Fucked Up,"" or, rather, their many variations on one mood. When punk bands expand their palettes, it usually means they take a stab at some form that's not all about loud-hard-fast. Fucked Up have planted their flag in loud-hard-fast pretty firmly, and Damian ""Pink Eyes"" Abraham's steel-wool bellow is the central point of their sound. Most of their best songs, like the torrential six-minute ""Triumph of Life"" (a demo of a Hidden World track), expand the boundaries of hardcore punk, rather than moving outside it: they're flexing their heads, as it were. The less impressive songs here, on the other hand, are just really well-played hardcore with a huge guitar sound, for which there's something to be said. ""Generation"" might be a parody of lunkheadbanging straightedge anthems, but it's functionally very similar to the real thing, for both good and ill: it rocks like crazy, Pink Eyes sounds absolutely committed in his howls about ""no hesitation/ Freedom or death"", and there might be a very tiny set of quotation marks hovering around its riff or lyrics. ""Fixed Race"" is a distant cousin of Wire's proto-hardcore anthem ""12XU"", and that's about all there is to it. A simple, straight-ahead version of ""No Epiphany"" is perfectly okay, but it also makes Chemistry's not-at-all-simple version sound much cooler by comparison. Couple Tracks also features Fucked Up's covers of three very angry, very un-hardcore-punk bands: Another Sunny Day (""Anorak City""), the Shop Assistants (""I Don't Wanna Be Friends with You"" and ""Looking Back""), and Dolly Mixture (""Dream Come True"" and ""He's So Frisky""). That's a beautiful gesture-- Fucked Up's relationship with twee pop isn't an outsider's ha-ha perspective, it's genuine engagement with an entire scene that's got an unlikely but undeniable formal link with their own work. Still, it's a gesture: Performing scalding hardcore versions of those songs doesn't add much to them or play to Fucked Up's strengths. (Also, ""I don't want to be civilized/ You leave me and I'll scratch your eyes out"" has distinctly different implications coming from a screaming 300-pound man than it did when the Shop Assistants' waifish Alex Taylor sang it.) The most interesting reinventions here, actually, are both Fucked Up covering themselves: the Daytrotter remakes of Chemistry's ""Magic Word"" and Hidden World's ""David Comes to Life"", which run Pink Eyes' hollering through some kind of echo-flange mangler. ""Magic Word"" loosens up its riff and its rhythm into an exuberant strut, and ""David"" becomes what the band called ""a straight up disco dance version"" at the time (post-Chic guitars, a beat that gallops as much as it stomps). Each of them blasts at least as hard as the original version but effectively finds a different song within its outlines-- examples in miniature of what Fucked Up have been doing for hardcore.","The Toronto hardcore band issues its second singles compilation, which begins with its debut single and leapfrogs around the group's fruitful career.

Accelerated Living,Saviours,by: Paul Thompson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a75ab1335d7bf1699035/1:1/w_160/686c0f91.jpg,2010-02-01 06:00:04,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13729-accelerated-living/,Kemado,"Thrash? Really, Saviours? The recent resurgence of run'n'gun thrash metal has spawned many nascent spandex-clad spitfires over the last couple of years. Until recently, it seemed to afflict only the relatively young-- a generation tired of working through Sabbath and ready to take it up with the Dark Angel. With Accelerated Living, Oakland's Saviours have fallen prey to the same tri-wristed beast as this younger crowd, dialing down the sludgy thwomp of their previous work, and thrashing about for a whole LP. It says something about Saviours' talents as a band that a fairly sharp turn like Accelerated Living doesn't totally suck, but it says something else about the band that the best compliment you can pay to their mini-Mustainery is that it's very, very reverent. This is a band still looking for an identity to call its own, and as such, the restless Accelerated Living feels decidedly transitional. After a couple of LPs and EPs apiece, Saviours seemed to hit on something with 2008's Into Abaddon, a potent blend of Brit-metal triumph with gnarled Southern scum. They thrashed, too, but tendon-tearing riffage wasn't the name of the game. By making the jump from boggy, expansive muck to this insistence on whiplash, Saviours have shed a good deal of the dynamism that made them one to watch in the first place. Like any good thrash metal record, Accelerated Living does zero to 60 right, blasting off admirably on the breakneck ""Acid Hand"". But it's almost as if somebody snapped off the cruise control lever, and aside from a few brief bits of spacy respite, we're at 60 for nearly 50 minutes. Their singularity of purpose is admirable, but with its slate gray production and unerring tempo, Living feels like a chore by its halfway point. The hurried nature of the music leads to harried playing, and vocalist Austin Barber, who could do a number on the woozier, wider Abaddon, seems to be in a perpetual rush to get out what he's saying. The best thrash records-- from the old guard, anyhow-- find a way to carve out a little room amidst the pummeling to insert personality, nuance, puke breaks. In that sense, the comparatively unrelenting Accelerated Living veers closer to one of the better records from a classic-era thrash also-ran, a little too concerned with bowling you over with speed to stop and think how they might bring you back for another go. One gets the feeling that's not a great concern of Saviours; whenever they pop up next, they may well be on to another genre altogether.","Oakland band dials down the sludgy thwomp of its previous work in favor of run'n'gun thrash metal.

She sweeps out the dark corners of electronic music, reclaiming whatever scraps of sonic information slip free from the nets of genres. These splinters of melody, bits of noise, subliminal streaks of rhythm, and bewildered voices are compressed into a nebulous whole. Volume is more important than harmony. Greie often operates somewhere beyond music, probing into sculpture, science, and math. Greie's sixth solo album as AGF, Einzelkämpfer, is a mix of spoken-word, singing, low-key noise, and the occasional distended rhythm. Rather than building, her tracks keep flexing and doubling back. Some verifiable songs slip out of the haze: The title track, though it begins in a dripping tunnel of beats and warbles, emerges into something like dehydrated Fever Ray. And ""Worin mein Mund Zur Bewegung Fand"" sounds like Alison Goldfrapp singing in a junkyard where someone happens to be playing a Morton Feldman record at half speed. But more often the music is just a receptacle for fantastic shapes and incongruous images. On the beautifully designed ""We Break Out"", with clip-clopping drums and a synth tone that keeps popping out like a broken spring, anxiously pitch-shifting vocal harmonies run alongside a calm recitation. It's a motif that repeats across the album. Greie keeps splitting into two beings, one impassive and the other freaked out, talking over each other. It's like those Beach Boys songs where the backing vocals contradict all the exhortations to have fun, but elevated to full-bore dissociative identity disorder. ""You invented language,"" Greie confides conspiratorially on ""Alone in the Woods (The Fox, the Skunk and the Rabbit)"", but Einzelkämpfer takes up the concept of the ""lone warrior,"" (the word's English meaning) so of course, she's talking to herself. Before translating the German, you might gather that her dry, tart delivery represents what she intends to say, while its distressed twin is what the listener hears. It's challenging to box what we mean in language, and to ensure that the contents don't shift in transit. But the problem turns out to be simpler than that-- there simply isn't anyone to talk to. On ""Practicing Beat Anarchy"", she sounds out the words of the title roughly, as if trying to force some meaning into them. It's a solitary war of attrition. By closing track ""On Earth"", every trace of the communicative has vanished into a primordial ooze of voiceless low frequencies. After all the torturous expression, this arrives as an almost physical relief.","Experimental German producer Antye Greie, who has worked with the likes of Ellen Allien and Vladislav Delay, returns with her sixth solo album.

I've heard a bit of Harper's solo output, and while it's quite pretty and a fine showcase for her swooping, evocative voice, the equally moody but more dance-friendly Class Actress suggests trading the coffeehouse for the nightclub was an excellent decision. Class Actress' initial release, the Journal of Ardency EP, couldn't be more resolutely 1980s-vintage if it'd been put out on cassette tape. Sonically, the group freely appropriates the sullen synthetics of New Order, the Human League, and Depeche Mode. But where Ladyhawke or Telepathe's Melissa Livaudais match coolly detached, affectless vocals to those artificial tones, Harper offers a playful, breathy coo that hearkens back to hipster queens like Blondie's Debbie Harry and Saint Etienne's Sarah Cracknell. ""Careful What You Say"" opens the EP, and from its initial noisy synth blurts you'd be forgiven for thinking we were entering Crystal Castles territory. Soon enough, however, Harper shows up to assure us that we're actually in for chic pop froth. Insouciant as her pipes may be, Harper's lyrics are more interesting and cutting than your typical indie-dance fare, perhaps a byproduct of her aforementioned former life as a folkie, where words have nowhere to hide. ""You've woken the guards,"" Harper chides, lending romantic discord the tension of a heist film. The title track also throws a curveball-- creepy, Knife-ish synths that lead into a rubbery groove and sighing melody. The real leftfield treat, however, is the third track, ""Let Me Take You Out"", which proves the group's record collection doesn't consist solely of synth-pop-- apparently they expanded their horizons to include mopey 80s guitar music, too, particularly the Cure and the Smiths. ""Let Me Take You Out"" not only evokes lyrics from ""There Is a Light That Never Goes Out"" in its title, but Harper also mimics Morrissey's haunting vocal swoons, while the music conjures up the best giddy guitar-pop rushes of Robert Smith's bunch. Journal of Ardency's final two tracks prove the EP's title accurate. Harper demonstrates a facility for empathizing with outsized teenage lovesickness in ""Adolescent Heart"" and then shows why with ""Someone Real"", which finds her admitting, ""I truly obsess over every word you say,"" before begging a prospective lover to ""believe me when I tell you that you need someone real."" Were Harper setting her pleas for shared emotional transparency against a softly strummed guitar, it all might be a bit too real, but atop stark beats and malfunctioning synth twinkles that sound like kissing cousins to Junior Boys' ""Under the Sun"", her passion proves to be the same kind of compelling counterweight to frosty sonics that helped make the music of her influences so memorable.","Former solo folkie Elizabeth Harper's new dance-pop project features the frosty sonics and compelling vocals that made her 80s influences so memorable.

Life Is Sweet! Nice to Meet You,Lightspeed Champion,by: Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a7e4c0084474cd0c0cdb/1:1/w_160/d0100613.jpg,2010-02-01 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13834-life-is-sweet-nice-to-meet-you/,Domino,"Devonté Hynes enjoyed critical acclaim at age 19 as a member of art-thrashers Test Icicles, and now, as Lightspeed Champion, he works with the resigned determination of someone who realizes hype is fleeting. Under a pair of pseudonyms (Blood Orange is the other), Hynes gives away impossible-to-digest amounts of free music online. Most recently, Hynes had his heart sawed to pieces by adorable animated bears in the Kanye West-endorsed (all caps: ""THIS IS DOPE"") video for Basement Jaxx's 2009 electro-pop stunner ""My Turn"", a song he co-wrote. As Hynes wonders aloud, ""When will this all start?"" it sounds like he knows it probably won't. If ""My Turn"" lays bare Hynes' fears, his Lightspeed project battles them-- eccentrically and at times too obscurely, but no less quixotically. As Lightspeed, Hynes flees from the trends that briefly propelled his former band, while inevitably failing to escape them. His 2008 debut, Falling Under the Lavender Bridge, embraced the Americana twang of Saddle Creek in-house producer Mike Mogis, skewering ghetto-fetishizing peers with songs like ""All My Friends Are Listening to Crunk"". It was hard to tell who was being more ironic. Appropriately, then, Life Is Sweet! Nice to Meet You brings on a producer with a hip-hop background, Ben Allen, who also oversaw a little record called Merriweather Post Pavilion. For better and worse, Lightspeed's sophomore album plays like a product of Hynes' restlessness. Alternately inspired and frustrating, it addresses themes of lost love (and lost chicness) with Queen-size 70s-rock pomp, neoclassical interludes, and one ukulele-based chamber-pop song. Hynes can shred, too, laying down a nasty guitar solo on the album's first single, ""Marlene"", a twitchy but slightly overlong funk barrage that could make ""more triangle"" the new ""more cowbell."" ""Stop being cool,"" Hynes demands, a refrain that might be a mission statement for the whole Lightspeed project. The catchiest song, live favorite ""Madame Van Damme"", takes hipster self-loathing to its cheerful extreme, repeating, ""Kill me, baby, won't ya kill me,"" over a light girl-group bounce. Heaven knows he's miserable now, but ""Faculty of Fears"" goes one Morrissey hiccup too far, tethering a badass bass groove to inscrutable lyrics about sarongs and Pythagorean theorems. The best and the worst of Life Is Sweet! Nice to Meet You meet on ""The Big Guns of Highsmith"". First it's a clever kiss-off to London: ""Chelsea teas and Socrates still haunt me/ A life I strived and chased and had and lost."" Then it's clever self-recrimination: ""Hurts be to be the one who's always feeling sad,"" Hynes whines, before a Greek chorus retorts, ""Oh, just stop complaining!"" This dry self-awareness puts the album's remaining highlights-- baroque keyboard plaint ""Middle of the Dark"", spaghetti-Western epic ""Sweetheart"", jazz-splashed rumination ""Smooth Day (At the Library)""-- in proper context. It's also bloodlessly cerebral. We are not the champions, my friends. Hynes has been, and still could be again, but for now he's keeping that English stiff upper lip about it.","Former Test Icicles member recruits Animal Collective producer for an album that plays like a product of his musical restlessness.

Romance Is Boring,Los Campesinos!,by: Paul Thompson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a814c0084474cd0c0d4d/1:1/w_160/66b9b454.jpg,2010-02-01 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13879-romance-is-boring/,Arts & Crafts,"One of the earliest Los Campesinos! singles came with a daisy chain of paper dolls tucked into the sleeve, each Campesino! holding hands and smiling wide. Had a razorblade popped out of 2008's We Are Beautiful, We Are Doomed, I doubt anyone would've blinked an eye. Over the past three years, Los Campesinos! transformed themselves from a smart, spry, neon pop group possessed with a seemingly boundless everykid exuberance to a bunch of noisy, angry, funny weirdos. Their near-blindingly bright debut LP, Hold On Now Youngster, sat on shelves for a scant eight months before the group followed it with We Are Beautiful, a squalid spleen-venter. They started touring with noise-rock bands. Gareth Campesinos!, lead shouter/songwriter, began barking for heavy stuff like Xiu Xiu and Parenthetical Girls on their Twitter; then, they got the guy from Xiu Xiu to guest on their latest record. In practically a year's time, Gareth went from phrase-turning, scene-critiquing clever kid to a sadsack of Steven Patrick Morrissey proportions, while his band loosened up and billowed out, their grandiose pop growing at once messier and more symphonic. It's all been pretty good. And it all comes to a head here on Romance Is Boring, their third proper LP. All that they've managed to do over the three short years-- the not-so-quiet confidence and compositional precision of their earlier work, the weary weather-beaten sound of We Are Beautiful, and of course Gareth's hilarious, grotesque, and immensely affecting character sketches-- finds its way onto Romance. And Gareth, poor hilarious Gareth, though still very concerned with the goings-on around his navel, has turned his gaze outward just a bit; heck, the first line on the record has him pleading to ""talk about you for a minute."" They're still utter musical maximalists, still keen to shout when the time calls, and still led by a perpetual malcontent, but Romance Is Boring feels like the payoff of three years of extremely hard work; Gareth may never settle down exactly, but his band's sure getting some stuff figured out. On sonics alone, Romance Is Boring is a triumph; bringing back We Are Beautiful's John Goodmanson as producer, they've expanded their already sizable instrumental palette, thrown a little more space into the still-crowded mix, and figured out a way to make the big moments count even more by pulling back during the ones that mean less. Whereas before, it occasionally seemed as though they were piling on instruments just to keep idle hands busy, they've learned not to do everything at once. Gareth's been badmouthing their early reliance on glockenspiel to just about anybody who'll listen these days, and there's definitely a deemphasis on the cuter side of things; that's clear as soon as you hit the turgid electronic breakdown of ""In Medias Res"". Those still-great old numbers from the Sticking Fingers Into Sockets EP sound like they were written by some gifted children, the jarring wallow of We Are Beautiful like young adults; the comparatively subtle Romance Is Boring feels almost full-grown. Gareth, too, is showing off some of the wisdom of his not-so-advanced age; a limber, funny, and often uncomfortably direct lyricist, he's a little less concerned with being clever here. One striking thing about Romance is how little concern there seems to be with rhyme schemes, as if expression of these thoughts couldn't be relegated to some prescribed formula. Because he writes well over the lines, songs start and end in strange places-- ""Straight in at 101"" kicks off with a knee-slapper about post-rock and winds down with a televised countdown of worst breakups ever-- but it has the naturalistic feel of a stream-of-consciousness confessional written by a dude who's been through a lot and spent even more time thinking about it. He's always managed to find the humor in the tragic, but here, he finds time for both. He begins one song detailing a friend's struggles with eating disorders, then leads off the next with a unison scream urging one and all to ""calm the fuck down."" Because so much of this seems ripped from the pages of Gareth's journal-- and because he still sings like he's gonna blow up at any moment-- the urgency of all that he's trying to convey can knock you flat. There may be slicker songwriters, and there are many more economical, but there are few more honest, more willing to put it all out there, and for many, more relatable. For some, the cohesive, self-assured Romance will be their favorite Los Campesinos! record; others will continue to prefer the extremity of what came before. That's the breaks with an intensely personal band like this, I suppose; you're going to get intensely personal reactions. Speaking as somebody a little older than your average Campesino!, I can tell you I'm glad to be out of the shitstorm of my early twenties on display here, but I do remember it well; never better than when I'm listening to this band, for better and worse. I can remember at that age feeling constantly on the verge of something, but not knowing sure just what. Romance Is Boring smacks of that feeling, knowing more than before but still trying to hash out just where to go with it. It's fun watching bands grow; it's been a pleasure watching this band grow up.","The divisive and highly personal Welsh group continues to grow up, embrace its inner punk, churn out amazing lyrics, and sharpen its edge.

Adventures in Experimental Electric Orchestra from the San Francisco Psychedelic Underground,The Orkustra,by: Marc Masters,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a7f313d1975652139544/1:1/w_160/72a5590a.jpg,2010-01-29 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13850-adventures-in-experimental-electric-orchestra-from-the-san-francisco-psychedelic-underground/,Mexican Summer,"Bobby BeauSoleil may be best known for who he knows. Whenever his name is mentioned, it's often in the same breath as either Kenneth Anger or Charles Manson. The former association is strong-- in 1967, experimental filmmaker Anger cast BeauSoleil in his film Lucifer Rising and commissioned him to create the soundtrack. But the latter association is muddier. There's no question that BeauSoleil lived on Manson's ranch, and, in 1969 at age 22, killed a man during a botched drug deal. But Manson's involvement, and whether it's fair to lump the crime in with his more famous ritual murders, are matters of dispute. Either way, it landed BeauSoleil in prison, where he remains today. But back in 1965, before he met Anger or Manson, BeauSoleil was a wide-eyed teenager who decided while sitting on a rock in San Francisco's Golden Gate pond ""to assemble the first electric symphony orchestra"". The band he did form-- at first dubbed the Electric Chamber Orchestra, then the Orkustra-- was actually a five-man rock/jazz/folk hybrid. Taking cues from modal bebop and Hindu ragas, their sound was wandering and mystic, not far from the meditations of their contemporaries to the south, L.A.'s YaHoWha 13. But Orkustra music could also be sharply-crafted, using non-rock instruments like oboe and bouzouki to inject worldly flavors, anticipating similar fusions by Dead Can Dance, Camper Van Beethoven, and Sun City Girls. The Orkustra caught on quickly in the hippified Bay Area, and soon shared stages with the Grateful Dead and Buffalo Springfield. Their genre-straddling approach also landed them spots in folk and jazz festivals. A turn at the 1967 Invisible Circus festival inspired Anger to approach BeauSoleil, and the band broke up soon after, before they could record a proper studio album. Fortunately, Orkustra violinist David LaFlamme saved tapes of live shows and practice sessions. Two pieces from these archives surfaced on Arcanum's 2004 Lucifer Rising reissue, and now Mexican Summer has released the entire LaFlamme stash as a double-LP, with the aptly-rambling title Adventures in Experimental Orchestra from the San Francisco Psychedelic Underground. The result is not as exciting as the 4xLP box set of complete Lucifer sessions recently issued by the Anja label, since the Orkustra recordings are rougher and sometimes glitchy. But even during the murkiest stretches, BeauSoleil's creative fire is clear. Bright Eastern melodies like the lilting ""Bombay Calling"" meld into floating improvisations like ""Hungarian Stomp"". The slow sway of ""Bousaki Blues Experiment""-- a dead ringer for the Dirty Three-- matches the proggy riffage of ""Flash Gordon"" and the braying loops of ""Punjab's Barber"". Throughout, LaFlamme's searing violin winds around BeauSoleil's sandy guitar and Henry Rasof's winding oboe. The effect is hypnotic, eerie, even sinister-- a drifting take on ""snake charmer music,"" as BeauSoleil himself calls it in his entertaining liner notes. The peak is ""Gypsy Odyssey"", a 25-minute live piece performed in a church on Christmas Eve. Snippets from other Orkustra songs drift in and out of the track's muffled sound-fog, as LaFlamme pulls the group skyward like a hot-air balloon. The Orkustra's demise didn't stop BeauSoleil-- he formed two more groups for the Lucifer soundtrack, recording the final version behind prison walls. While much of that music is more sophisticated than the Orkustra material, Adventures has an eagerness that BeauSoleil could probably never capture again. We may someday find out-- the 63-year-old's next parole hearing comes in 2013, 44 years after he was last free to create this wide-open music.","Former Manson associate, still imprisoned, has a 2xLP set of ""electric symphony orchestra"" music issued by Mexican Summer.

"No Hope, No Future",Good Shoes,by: Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a79fea9e61561daa5619/1:1/w_160/327765a8.jpg,2010-01-29 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13781-no-hope-no-future/,Brille,"In late 2006, Good Shoes cracked the UK singles charts with ""All in My Head"", a quintessentially British-indie slab of neurotic, spiky punk-pop. Further singles and chart appearances culminated in 2007's Think Before You Speak, a charmingly heartfelt album somewhere between a less insular Arctic Monkeys and a less caffeinated Futureheads-- romantic insecurities you could dance to in your trainers. When sharply accented singer/guitarist Rhys Jones sang, ""Things were better when we were young,"" the future still sounded bright. Now-- No Hope, No Future. The world has changed a whole lot since the mid-2000s, musically and geopolitically, and Good Shoes are probably being at least half-serious about their sophomore album's title. The London four-piece are confronting the same boring bummer as so many others in this ""new 'normal'"" economy. Success isn't as successful it used to be, you start growing old before you stop growing up, papa don't preach. What results is an album that sounds like the 00s even as its themes are solidly turn-of-2010. A darker album, a slightly clumsier album, but an album with a strong unifying themes and a few songs worth stepping away from the bar for. ""Time may change me,"" sang Bowie, ""but I can't trace time."" Guess who was taking notes. Good Shoes are obsessed with permanence and flux, what's innate in a person and what might eventually turn sour: relationships, careers. No Hope, No Future's first single, ""That's the Way My Heart Beats"", bouncily blames the narrator's ongoing girl problems on something in his nature. By contrast, evocative finale ""City by the Sea""-- as close as UK indie gets to power ballads-- is right there with Death Cab for Cutie's ""Meet Me on the Equinox"": ""All I want's a little more time/ To feel your heart beat next to mine."" Everything-- everything-- ends. After a debut record wrapped up in girls and going to shows, Good Shoes deserve credit for continuing to sing about what they know even as that gets darker. ""Times Change"", an assault on cranky oldsters, has guitars neatly uptight enough for Field Music, and it's refreshingly difficult to figure out where to put the air quotes on tense relationship-ender ""Then She Walks Away"": ""I know I should be the one to say those words/ Like, 'Times change, but I want you to stay.'"" But gloomy quarter-life crisis songs leave less room for error, and even on the latter track, Jones sings contrived-sounding words about how his words sound ""contrived."" When No Hope, No Future isn't staring glumly into the void, Good Shoes could be a whole other band-- the band of their debut, only more seasoned. There's the Chic-chic disco-funk of ""Under Control"", which would resemble Art Brut if Eddie Argos sang about sex addiction rather than impotence. There's also the sprinting release of ""Thousand Miles an Hour"", which functions almost like a surf-rock instrumental. On ""I Know"", Jones attacks zealots of all stripes with a preachy certitude that would make Billy Bragg sound like Ghostface Killah if not for the half-winking title. It's been said the only true wisdom is in knowing you know nothing. Yeah, but it's also been said, ""Know thyself.""","London's Good Shoes lie somewhere between a less insular Arctic Monkeys and a less caffeinated Futureheads, and here they return with album number two.

Night Music,Etienne Jaumet,by: Jess Harvell,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a80513d1975652139567/1:1/w_160/8df8349f.jpg,2010-01-29 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13874-night-music/,Domino,"For a film genre that gets so little respect, horror-- especially the grungy, lo-fi, 80s straight-to-video sort-- is a major influence on indie comics and DIY filmmaking at present. Even in music, an entire generation seems to have been introduced to electronics via horror's flea-market musique concrète and perverted keyboard themes-- the knife-on-bone analog scraping and primitive digital squeals heard in The Shining and Texas Chainsaw Massacre; the way John Carpenter managed to sneak proto-techno minimalism into America's drive-ins and living rooms. I've no idea whether French producer Etienne Jaumet was exposed to these films during his formative years, but while the title of Night Music seems, on first blush, like another limp evocation of techno-cool, I think he's got something more sinister up his sleeve. Jaumet's debut album throbs, groans, and wails with the pants-wetting and sleep-disrupting sonorities of all your horror faves. An occasional cop to placidity and prettiness aside-- the folkie picking that closes his 20-minute opening opus ""For Falling Asleep"" offers a little light-- this is one creepy album. Even the song titles-- ""Mental Vortex"", ""Through the Strata""-- read like placeholders handed to a composer for the scenes when a possessed Christopher Lee starts spooking English schoolchildren. And it seems like no coincidence that Jaumet got his start in a duo called Zombie Zombie, though his tracks proceed with sequenced dread rather than the lurches and starts of the undead. Still, plenty of Night Music sounds like pure old-school techno. Listen to the metallic electro-funk percussion of ""Entropy""-- that warmly familiar Roland-right-out-of-the-box programming-- or the Vangelis-with-cold-sweats synth arpeggios throughout, and it will be no surprise to learn that Detroit godfather/gadfly Carl Craig midwifed the album. And it's possible to hear honest-to-God influence drawn from all the Krautrock heroes and ""serious"" composers name-dropped in Jaumet's press materials. ""Psychedelic""? Sure, but probably the kind of trip that ends in a locked-ward sanitarium. And I dunno what Domino's PR folks were listening to when they called Night Music ""dreamy,"" but it certainly wasn't the hounds-of-hell strings screaming through ""Strata"". That was the first tune on Night Music to truly stab me in the ears, jolt me out of passive listening, force me to play it again and again even as it unnerved me. Night Music's rawness-- Jaumet even manages to make a saxophone, that treacly emblem of kitschy synth-pop cocktail bar culture-- sound visceral and disturbing on ""At the Crack of Dawn""-- is what separates the album from the glut of 80s jackers. Jaumet is steeped in history, even if it's not necessarily the history his advance notice suggests. But retro sleekness interests him not at all, and in a world of bloodless digital soundscaping, exposing the guts in his machines is why we should be paying attention.","With help from Detroit techno godfather Carl Craig, former Zombie Zombie member creates a haunted, sinister take on electronic music.

To Realize,Clipd Beaks,by: David Bevan,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a815c0084474cd0c0d4f/1:1/w_160/f78f9657.jpg,2010-01-29 06:00:01,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13881-to-realize/,Lovepump United,"Clipd Beaks have been specializing in decidedly damaged post-punk since 2003, their wares a far cry from the black tie Joy Division reheating that started to fog up the landscape at about that time last decade. Instead, over the course of three tremendous releases, they've churned out bruising, noise-splashed sounds à la Liars circa Drum's Not Dead. Their interest seems to have lain more in making sonic sense of chaos, a hypnotic form they've fleshed out further on To Realize, their second full-length effort. They accomplished that by letting go in a way. 2007's Hoarse Lords was tightly wound despite its constant rattle, and it retained some semblances of traditional song structure. It felt neither fully realized nor fully formed, and that sounded perfectly awesome. To Realize places its faith in texture, atmospherics, and shades of light and dark. Any notion of melody takes a deep back seat to feeling and groove, be it of the lockstepped Krautrock variety, tribalist pulse or gut-level clatter. Ecklein's bass figures in particular act as a focal point, a heartbeat to follow through the fray. That said, these songs have a very natural pull and feel-- every movement, be it seasick or cutting, leads back into the tracks' centers. A loose, opening drone séance, ""Strangler"" sets a mood but belies its name. Over languorous drum hits, bassist Scott Ecklein and guitarist Nick Barbeln chant bleak lines about lost highways. While it can be tough to make them out at times, lyrically the two lean heavily with imagery that's overtly post-apocalyptic. (This actually could have made an excellently fucked up soundtrack to The Road or The Book of Eli.) On that path, ""Blood"" rumbles even harder: The arrival of Barbeln's serrated, high-arching guitar lines flipping the song from black-and-white to color. Eye-opening moments like these are tucked away in various crevices throughout To Realize and they not only present themselves further with repeated listens, they gain strength as well. The opening blast of ""Dust"" hits harder with every subsequent take. The way horns are married to screams in ""Atoms"" sounds absolutely evil. And, exactly one second after it passes its five-minute mark, ""Home"" simply erupts. It's kind of a hike to get there, but that song's final stretch is certainly one of the record's most exhilarating: 90 seconds in which all of the errant moaning, groaning, and floating debris combine to draw blood as one massive torrent. Through those six-plus minutes of ""Home"" it becomes clear this is an experience to be taken in full. That can certainly be fatiguing and even boring for some. But the result is comfortably atonal-- a headphones listen that's difficult but ultimately more haunting.","Oakland three-piece continues to create outstanding Liars-like rock that places its faith in texture, atmospherics, and shades of light and dark.

Stroke: Songs for Chris Knox,Various Artists,by: Joshua Klein,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a80013d1975652139559/1:1/w_160/e5119b2c.jpg,2010-01-29 06:00:00,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13859-stroke-songs-for-chris-knox/,Merge,"For decades Chris Knox has loomed over New Zealand's music scene. While Knox occasionally ventured outside his native land, the charismatic/confrontational Enemy/Toy Love/Tall Dwarfs frontman and solo act spent most of his life home supporting New Zealand's productive arts scene, paving the way for such acts as the Clean, the Chills, and the Verlaines. Along the way Knox amassed more than his share of fans around the world, too, and when news spread that he suffered a stroke last summer, support and sympathy arrived in equal measure to his stature. Still, that doesn't quite prepare you for the quantity and quality of A-list acts that appear on Merge's Stroke: Songs for Chris Knox, a 2xCD tribute to the man and his music whose proceeds will go toward his recovery (Knox, 57, currently has limited speech and mobility). (Pre-orders are currently being accepted, and the record is out now digitally.) The sheer breadth and diversity of this recorded response almost begs disbelief, considering how quickly it came together, and really shows how far Knox's influence has reached, from several of his Kiwi peers to kindred spirits. The already much missed Jay Reatard starts off the set well-paired with the Toy Love nugget ""Pull Down the Shades"", ""recorded in the bathroom of a hotel in Denmark on a 4-track,"" and the just plain missing Jeff Mangum, whose cover of the Tall Dwarfs' ""Sign the Dotted Line"" marks a rare recorded reappearance of the Neutral Milk Hotel mastermind, whose own lo-fi inclinations lined up well with Knox's. Incredibly, the presence of Mangum is just the tip of the iceberg. The cavalcade of high-profile support continues with Bill Callahan and Will Oldham, whose versions of ""Lapse"" and a stunning ""My Only Friend"", respectively, remind that Knox could be as moving as theatrically manic. Stephin Merritt (who enlisted Knox to close the first 6ths album) simultaneously pays homage to Knox's aesthetic while reminding us of his own home recording roots with his (allegedly circa 1983!) version of ""Beauty"". Yo La Tengo mellow out ""Coloured"" and Lambchop offer a faithfully piano-led ren [#script:http://pitchfork.com/media/backend/js/tiny_mce/themes/advanced/langs/en.js]|||||| dition of ""What Goes Up"". Elsewhere AC Newman's ""Dunno Much About Life But I Know How to Breathe"" channels Knox's trademark lust-for-life brio, while John Darnielle personalizes his sympathetic Mountain Goats track ""Brave"" with a get-well introduction. Longtime Kiwi pop aficionado (and top secret Merge Records co-founder) Mac McCaughan tackles ""Nostalgia's No Excuse"" as Portastatic, replete with an approximation of Knox's sneer and dollops of fuzzy distortion. And then, of course, there's the host of New Zealand acts paying their respects to their friend and inspiration. Flying Nun peers and veterans such as the Bats, Verlaines, Hamish, and David Kilgour (of the Clean), the Chills, Peter Gutteridge (providing a hypnotically reinvented ""Don't Catch Fire""), and Shayne Carter (of Straightjacket Fits) make appearances, as do relatively fresh faces like the Checks (doing Toy Love's ""Rebel""), the Mint Chicks, and Pumice. Even some bona fide Antipodean stars show up, including Don McGlashan (of the Mutton Birds) and Neil Finn (who covers ""It's Love"" with his wife and two kids). It's a bit of a bummer that MOR singer Boh Runga gets Knox's beloved ""Not Given Lightly"", especially considering Pearl Jam covered it well on tour in New Zealand last November and could have provided this comp yet another ringer, but her heart is in the right place. Special mention, of course, must go to Alec Bathgate, Knox's longtime partner in the Tall Dwarfs and the co-writer of many of these tracks, who contributes a sterling version of the solo Knox gem ""Glide"". There are other treats and surprises in store, too, from Jordan Luck's inspired choice of ""Becoming Something Other"" (about a father stricken by Parkinson's, highlighting Knox's sometimes twisted but always humanist lyrics) to SJD namesake Sean Donnelly's lovely ""The Outer Skin"" (a song covered by the Hope Blister way back when) to Lou Barlow's ""Song of the Tall Puppy"", from 2008's Chris Knox and the Nothing album A Warm Gun, a gentle reminder that the guy still makes records. Which leads us to the best surprises of them all: new recordings from both the Nothing and Tall Dwarfs. The Nothing song in particular, ""Nappin' in Lapland"", offers a glimpse of Knox's novel, inspiring way around his predicament: songs with singing, but no words.

Forge Your Own Chains: Heavy Psychedelic Ballads and Dirges 1968-1974,Various Artists,by: Nate Patrin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a7feea9e61561daa56fa/1:1/w_160/bdb26bf4.jpg,2010-01-28 06:00:04,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13858-forge-your-own-chains-heavy-psychedelic-ballads-and-dirges-1968-1974/,Now Again,"When it comes to cratedigging labels dedicated to documenting niche scenes, there are two extremes you often wind up dealing with. On the one hand, there's the gatekeepers-- garage-punk supremacists, Northern Soul zealots-- that see their efforts as the preservation of a great subgenre. They're crazy and you don't want to strike up conversations with them at record fairs, but their fundamentalist attitude at least tends to result in their compilations being pretty consistent. And at the other end, there's the general-interest guys, the ones who started as sample hunters and wound up getting drawn into their source material. At best, they build unexpected and illuminating connections between bands and scenes that never knew of each other's existence; at worst, they sometimes mistake ""I found it first"" for ""this should be heard immediately."" Now-Again falls in that second, egalitarian category, and Forge Your Own Chains represents the best and worst of that impulse. To the credit of curator Egon, his liner notes state that the purpose of this collection isn't to show off a bunch of rare collector-baiting nuggets but to find common threads between an international assemblage of acid-rock oddities. And the subtitle-- Heavy Psychedelic Ballads and Dirges-- points to an intriguing vein of music; more intriguing yet is the aim of collecting variations of it from five different continents. But when you're working with psychedelic rock, one of the most uneven genres when it comes to old, small-press, and private-press releases, even the best intentions can result in a bit of a mess. The good news with Forge Your Own Chains is that listening to it all the way through will leave you with both positive first and last impressions. Bookending the comp with its two most sprawling and intense tracks is a canny move, and what Top Drawer's mournful, wailing-guitar-in-a-cathedral epic ""Song of a Sinner"" and the open-throttle squall of Baby Grandmothers' ""Somebody's Calling My Name"" share is a sense of slowly-building anxiety, which they use to different ends. But a sizeable chunk of the stuff between these two tracks lacks a lot of their focused intensity, and there's moments where a conceptually promising piece of music is let down by an amateurism that can't quite match the ambition. D.R. Hooker's title track is the emblematic example: halfway between eccentric brilliance and period-piece hippie-dip, it flouts convention by throwing jazzy horn section counterpoints over its mellow folk-rock but suffers from a weirdly slack, wet-noodle vocal that drains almost all the energy from the song. There's a few other songs that sound like first-take shrugs-- chief amongst them being Shadrack Chameleon's ""Don't Let It Get You Down"", a soporific granola-rock downer that makes like a Derek & the Dominos ballad without the solos. Ellison's ""Strawberry Rain"" and Morly Grey's ""Who Can I Say You Are"" fare better by fusing weighty proto-metal with leftfield forays into doo-wop or acoustic pastoralism, though they still sound unfocused in the end. When Forge Your Own Chains stretches past the boundaries of North American and European rock, it gets a bit more interesting. Shin Jung Hyun & the Men's ""Twilight"" (also known as ""The Evening Sun"") introduces one of South Korea's biggest rock icons to a wider Western audience through a sweeping epic ballad that lands somewhere between Ennio Morricone and the Moody Blues. Iranian Kourosh Yaghmaei's ""Hajm-e Khaali"" is a bleak, spooky rumination on loneliness with a quiet-verse-loud-chorus structure run through by a breathtaking guitar. And Ofege's ""It's Not Easy"" is what happens when a bunch of high school students from Lagos set about capturing the mood of Traffic's ""Dear Mr. Fantasy"", with a sweetly sad love song as a result. Hit-and-miss as Forge Your Own Chains is, there's no denying it was put together to be more than just a quick-buck eBay loot showcase, and the amount of research and care that went into Egon's liner notes is truly edifying-- detailing as much personnel, label names, producers, engineers, and backstory as possible. And despite the sometimes amateurish nature of this music, there's also the melancholy undercurrent of something that was lost to time, scarcity, and disinterest. Some of the musicians who appear on this compilation appear briefly with a few quotes about their old craft, but Top Drawer, the band that memorably leads off Forge Your Own Chains, are said in the notes to have disappeared off the radar completely. But it's also a bit revealing about the nature of the vinyl hunter: ""Damon's Song of a Gypsy was the key chapter in the lonely story about the psychedelic record collectors that searched out the rarest of the rare privately pressed American albums in the mid 1980s and early 90s and those that wanted to be like them,"" begins one blurb. Whether they dredge up garbage or gold, here's to their endless search.","Collecting strains of heavy psych from five continents, this ambitious, thoughtful release is also unsurprisingly erratic.

Versions,AU,by: Joe Colly,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a80a9d034d5c69bf3945/1:1/w_160/16f65c74.jpg,2010-01-28 06:00:03,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13866-versions/,Aagoo,"In part because of the loose, revolving-door nature of their group, Portland's AU have been difficult to pin down. Though singer/songwriter Luke Wyland and percussionist Dana Valatka have remained the band's creative anchor, AU have often swelled to include a dozen or more players, once topping out at 20 total musicians. And despite frequent comparisons to Animal Collective and Grizzly Bear, they've also suffered from a lack of attention, remaining on the outer fringes of the indie world. With mostly strong records and an unusual, imaginative approach that seems like a shame. Perhaps wanting to correct this disparity, Wyland and Valatka have taken a more streamlined approach to their latest EP, Versions, stripping AU down to its most essential elements. Versions, as its title suggests, is basically a reworking of the band's own material, featuring five reinterpretations of songs from their two previous albums (AU and Verbs, from 2006 and 2008) and one new track, ""Ida Walked Away"". Without the guest musicians who crowded earlier records, Wyland and Valatka, who are said to share a ""special, one-on-one musical connection,"" are left to imagine new outcomes for their songs, which in just about every case improve upon the source material. Whether it's because of an increased focus or the long time Wyland and Valatka have spent with these tracks, AU just sound like a better band here, more flexible and distinctive. Wiser, too: They highlight their strengths-- Wyland's impressive throaty vibrato, for one-- and strip arrangements down to more manageable sizes. Past records have found AU navigating the space between roomy experimental folk and more exuberant, campfire-sung freakouts, furthering the similarities between them and the well-known indie bands attached to these styles. But on Versions AU sound decidedly more singular. ""All Myself"" was an ornate, Yellow House-ian folk undertaking when it appeared on 2008's Verbs, but here the band transforms it into a spare piano ballad, giving Wyland enough space to open up vocally. His singing, unique and expressive before, comes into its own on the EP, sounding like a lower-register Antony. Even on more whimsical tracks like ""Are Animals"" and ""RR vs. D"" (those that teetered on the edge of wacky before), AU sound poised, sparingly using elements like group chants and handclaps in a way that doesn't detract attention from the core melodies. This tasteful, less-is-more approach spills over into slow burners ""Boute"" and ""Death"", but the real gem here is new track ""Ida Walked Away"", which made the rounds as a single last year. Probably the most openly poppy thing AU have done to date, the song reads like a modern take on the classic lover-don't-go ballad, with Wyland pleading with his mate in its aching, skyward chorus. There's a circular, momentum-gaining quality to ""Ida"" and it works not only as an intriguing structure but also an emotive, pop-leaning step for the band that encapsulates what's encouraging about this release. If Wyland and Valatka (with or without their stable of contributors) can continue along this path, the next AU full-length should shrug off the comparisons that have dogged them to date.","The slippery, underappreciated Portland band reworks its own previous material, and in just about every case improve upon the source material.

2,Retribution Gospel Choir,by: Jason Crock,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a7e713d1975652139523/1:1/w_160/7475f6bf.jpg,2010-01-28 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13841-2/,Sub Pop,"Retribution Gospel Choir, the more rocking part-time gig of Low frontman Alan Sparhawk, have a harder hill to climb on their sophomore record. For one, their 2008 LP reprised some songs that, though first played live by RGC, debuted on record on Low's 2007 LP, Drums and Guns. The differences between the versions was fascinating, as was hearing RGC release all the tension that Low so carefully maintain. It made sense to finally document a project that had been running for a few years. And there was the added novelty of hearing Alan Sparhawk singing and playing guitar in an honest-to-god rock'n'roll band-- and the surprise of hearing him pull it off. But the novelty is not an issue on 2. RGC now have to justify themselves as a stand-alone act-- and fortunately, they acquit themselves just as ably as they did on their debut. It's a record of sharp hooks and slick production, with several anthemic and instantly memorable choruses, all evident from the very first track. ""Hide It Away"" blends chest-beating harmonies and moments of quieter guitar jangle with the band's familiar surging 4/4 rock. It's as sweetly melodic as anything Sparhawk has written, but with unfettered, audacious confidence and a guitar solo gliding on heavy reverb-- more stumping on their campaign to become a current-day Crazy Horse. ""Your Bird"" follows up on the teeth-gritting bile of their debut with some added catchiness. And ""Working Hard"" toys with rock convention without inhabiting it completely, toning down the verses to a quieter shuffle and adding slyly nihilistic lyrics while still milking the handclaps and blue-collar guitar chug of the chorus for all they're worth. While 2 may not be as consistent in mood and tone as the debut, it diversifies the band's otherwise guitar-dominated sound in the album's second half. The strum of a banjo adds texture to the distorted chords of ""White Wolf"". Cello is used on two songs, the epic eight-minute reach-for-the-cheap-seats of ""Electric Guitar"" and the following comedown of the Low-like closing track ""Bless Us All"". a song marked by acoustic plucking, choral harmonies. ""Something's Going to Break"" goes all the way into using studio as instrument, sounding both muffled and feral in its first two minutes before abruptly shifting into the heaviest head-down riff of the record. The resulting explosions are still the band's raison d'être. But if 2 is slightly more dynamic, it isn't a dramatic departure from the debut, which the band nods to in its bone-simple title (another tweak on rock convention) and in the similarity between the album covers. What you see is what you get here, and while this record is as hard and heavy-- sometimes more so-- 2 bears all the slow, subtle refinement of Sparhawk's better-known projects. Slowly getting better at what you do isn't the most exciting story ever told, but it's one that has yet to get old.","The second full-length from the rocking side project of Low's Alan Sparhawk builds nicely on the sound of their debut LP.

Turn Ons,The HotRats,by: Stuart Berman,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a7cd9d034d5c69bf38b1/1:1/w_160/5b87ac40.jpg,2010-01-28 06:00:01,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13817-turn-ons/,Fat Possum,"What's more fun than singing your favorite songs? It's the basic tenet that accounts for the entire karaoke industry, the success of Rock Band, and the never-ending career of Rod Stewart-- though, naturally, the enjoyment one derives from singing their favorite songs is often inversely related to an audience's desire to hear them do it. Still, that hasn't stopped countless artists from resorting to the all-covers album when they find themselves at a career crossroads or in search of renewed inspiration. When executed effectively-- through savvy song selection, inventive rearrangements, and authoritative vocal performances that allow the singer to reclaim the song as their own-- the all-covers album can introduce veteran artists to new audiences (Johnny Cash's American Recordings series), open up new avenues for future exploration (Nick Cave's Kicking Against the Pricks), or deconstruct an enigma (David Bowie's Pin Ups). For the most part, however, they just feel like a private, practice-space indulgence that didn't really need to become a public commodity. Supergrass are at an all-covers-album point in their careers-- with 16 years and six studio albums under their belts, the band have experienced a gradual side down the UK charts in recent years (with 2008's Diamond Hoo Ha barely cracking the Top 20), and now exist in that middle-aged purgatory between NME buzz band and MOJO lifetime-achievement award recipients. They're also entering this decade as independent recording artists, following a split from long-time label Parlophone/EMI. So you can totally understand founding members Gaz Coombes and Danny Goffey (with producer Nigel Godrich in tow) wanting to cast those uncertainties aside and get back to where they once belonged via their all-covers project the HotRats. But what seems like a perfectly swell concept for a surprise gig at the local pub-- where sloshed spectators can join in on the hero worship-- feels much more suspect when reified into a permanent record. For one, Turn Ons' song selection doesn't reveal anything we didn't already know about Coombes and Goffey-- they have and always will be dedicated pop scholars mining the historical classic-rock contiunuum, from Ray Davies and Syd Barrett to David Bowie and Roxy Music to Elvis Costello and The Cure (all of whom have signature tracks featured here). But the real problem with Turn Ons isn't so much the predictable sources as the fact that the HotRats don't really do a whole lot with them. The minor touch-ups heard here don't exactly constitute a bold attempt to put their own stamp on the material: the Velvet Undergrond's ""I Can't Stand It"" is given an electric-boogie boost befitting of the Velvets' 1970s glam-rock progeny, the Cure's ""Love Cats"" gets a beefed-up swing beat, while the punk-rock classics (Gang of Four's ""Damaged Goods"" and a nudge-wink, self-reflexive take on the Sex Pistols' ""EMI"") are powered by acoustic guitars instead of electric. The HotRats are most successful at transforming Squeeze's ""Up the Junction"" into a piano-ballad reverie, but such inspired gestures are outnumbered by the more ill-advised augmentations: a version of Roxy Music's ""Love Is the Drug"" that neuters the original's discotheque groove into sexless spasms, or an otherwise straight-forward take on Bowie's ""Queen Bitch"" that slathers on an ornate string arrangement completely at odds with the song's streetwise swagger. Underscoring the ineffectuality of the exercise is the fact that Coombes mostly opts for mimicry over personal reinterpretation, adopting a brooding Jim Morrison baritone for the Doors' ""The Crystal Ship"", a deadpan Lou Reed drawl on ""I Can't Stand It"", a high-register Robert Smith wail on ""Love Cats"" and so on. Granted, there is one notable exception to Turn Ons' obvious curation and impersonation: an overhaul of the Beastie Boys' ""(You Gotta) Fight For Your Right (to Party!)"" that liberates the song from its rap-rock foundation and recasts it as a whimsical, paisley-hued outtake from The Who Sell Out. But while the novelty works on the verses, it leaves Coombes unsure of what to do with the chorus, thereby sapping the song of its greatest attribute: the opportunity to shout along with the titular slogan. Perhaps Supergrass' upcoming album Release the Drones-- due later this year-- will provide a more convincing justification for the HotRats experiment, assuming the process of reacquainting themselves with their formative influences is intended to rejuvenate the band and return them to their I Should Coco/In It for the Money heyday. But as it stands, the only real surprise with the HotRats is that they named themselves after a Frank Zappa album that has no other bearing on the proceedings. And truth be told, it actually would've been a lot more interesting to hear Coombes and Goffey try their hand at some 10-minute jazz-rock jams than another note-for-note version of ""Pump It Up"".","Following a split with their label, two-thirds of Supergrass team with producer Nigel Godrich and create a stopgap all-covers project.

IRM,Charlotte Gainsbourg,by: Ryan Dombal,Features Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a812c0084474cd0c0d46/1:1/w_160/2bfc4057.jpg,2010-01-28 06:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13878-irm/,Because,"Before summer 2007, Charlotte Gainsbourg was best known as the daughter of gallic godhead Serge Gainsbourg, a curiously magnetic actress with a diverse CV (romantic comedies, dark dramas, period pieces), and a part-time singer still working in the shadow of a mildly pedophilic 1984 duet recorded with her father called ""Lemon Incest"". Then Charlotte Gainsbourg nearly died. Weeks after a minor water skiing accident, she went to the doctor with headaches only to learn her hemorrhaged head was filled with blood. After summer 2007 (and successful brain surgery), the actress-singer filmed three intense movies including Lars von Trier's frightful Antichrist, in which she plays a grieving mother who wanders around an isolated cabin without pants on before mutilating her genitals. She also recorded IRM, a decidedly more palatable post-trauma piece. Written, arranged, produced, and largely played by Beck, the collaborative album marks Gainsbourg's transition from pop scion to pop artiste. Gainsbourg's mother, singer and actress Jane Birkin, often played muse for Serge, whether she was cover star of 1971's Histoire de Melody Nelson or making orgasmic sounds on the hit duet ""Je t'aime...moi non plus"". And while IRM is marked by Beck's singular sonic accoutrements, it often plays as if Charlotte is using him for inspiration. The muse-y confusion is both sensible-- Beck interpolated Serge's ""Melody"" on Sea Change-- and oddly fated. Beck's always had a cocked eye on death (remember that roaming pine box in the ""Loser"" video?) and his last three albums have focused on the ultimate end with unwavering abstract paranoia. If he's not sending up ""Profanity Prayers"" on Modern Guilt, he's seeing ""Strange Apparitions"" on The Information; as far as I know Beck did not have a near-death experience sometime around 2003, but he's been obsessed with poking at his forsaken soul ever since. Flip to Charlotte-- who became so haunted by her death scare that she underwent several MRIs (or IRMs, as the French call them) even after fully recovering-- and you've got a meeting of almost-40-year-old minds bent on exploring all the fears, mysteries, and anxieties that make death breathe. There's something to Gainsbourg's skeleton-like visage on the album's cover. ""Heaven can wait and hell's too far to go/ Somewhere between what you need and what you know,"" sing the pair on duet ""Heaven Can Wait"". The purgatory set up in those words informs the album's lyrics and mood, which live up to Beck's more ominous and serious guise. Whereas it can sometimes sound like Beck's already halfway into his crypt on his own songs, Gainsbourg is defiant, warm, and stoic in the face of flatlines. What could be depressing turns into a whimsical shrug on ""In the End""-- ""Who's to say it's all for the best in the end?"" hums Gainsbourg, comfortable in the unknowing. And on ""Master's Hands"", she's anything but helpless in the face of an Almighty Creator as she demands, ""Breathe out, come alive/ Give me a reason to feel."" She's in control, even when she's not. There's nothing close to a love song here, a severe turnaround from Gainsbourg's Air-produced, Jarvis Cocker-written 2006 LP 5:55, which was full of sordid, shrouded, and oddly lifeless tales of crumbling hearts. But the thematic switch goes lengths to give Gainsbourg her own identity apart from her amorous lineage. The closest thing to a Valentine's Day ode is found on the incubated folk tune ""Me and Jane Doe"". ""If I had my way I'd cross the desert to the sea/ Learn to speak in tongues, something that makes sense to you and to me,"" she sings, longingly. Another reason to believe IRM is more than a highly accomplished puppet job: It's actually better than any album Beck himself has released in the last seven years. The nods to psych rock, junkyard blues, half-rap cadences, and ghostly ballads won't shock anyone generally familiar with Beck's oeuvre, but Gainsbourg's versatile and vulnerable vocals add a depth missing from much of her songwriter's post-Sea Change work. She makes the most of her limited vocal abilities by switching deliveries to match her surroundings. The barely there orchestral stunner ""Vanities"" (arranged by Beck's dad David Campbell) gets a hushed quiver, the stream-of-consciousness brain-scan rock of ""IRM"" gets a zen rap, and, on the half-French closer ""La Collectionneuse"", she whispers close to your ear like a sultry grim reaper. The subject matter subverts her inherent sensuousness, but this is still Charlotte Gainsbourg singing-- at times, she can't help sounding like the cooing French goddess her father helped popularize. It's dead sexy, reborn.","After a 2006 album created in collaboration with Air and Jarvis Cocker, Charlotte Gainsbourg returns with a surprisingly great LP written and produced by Beck.

YellowFever,YellowFever,by: Amy Granzin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a80b13d1975652139575/1:1/w_160/1b4445ea.jpg,2010-01-27 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13865-yellow-fever/,Wild World,"On her NPR Monitor Mix blog, Carrie Brownstein has described YellowFever's sound as ""haunted house surf music."" I don't quite hear it, but I know what she's getting at: The Austin band plays a familiar sound just a half-twist skewed. It's familiar in the sense that you could as easily slot one of their catchy three-chord (if that) songs on the Moldy Peach-dominated Juno soundtrack as an International Pop Underground comp between Scrawl and the Spinanes, or on a circa-1982 John Peel playlist. And it's skewed in that almost none of the tracks on their self-titled long player are what they appear to be at first blush. Peers like Vivian Girls (who've released YellowFever on their own Wild World label) may play girl-group pop drenched in noise, but their take on the tradition is otherwise reverential, couching love found/love lost themes in a standard verse-chorus-verse idiom. YellowFever, by contrast, use sly and subtle sound pastiches to spin their mostly shaggy dog (in one case, literally) yarns. ""Donald"", for example, initially reads like a diss track, as vocalists Jennifer Moore and Isabel Martin catcall, ""You were such a perfect baby/ Now you've grown up old and lazy"" like a couple of pissed off Shangri-Las. Yet they swipe the sing-songy chorus, ""Donald don't you go/ Don't you go downtown"" from 1963's Jaynetts track ""Sally, Go 'Round the Roses"", a sympathetic-ear song (the titular Sally is cautioned from going downtown where she'll see her guy stepping out with another girl). ""Sally"" folds so seamlessly into ""Donald"" that you barely notice that YellowFever's not only transposed genders, but shuffled emotional registers. Does Donald deserve to be pitied or persecuted? Either way, it makes for an intriguing song. ""Metarie"" pulls a similar trick as its about-a-boy lyrics and garage-y organ sounds segue in the song's final seconds into Ben E. King's swishy 1961 hit ""Spanish Harlem"", forcing you to rewind and relisten to the YellowFever song as a riff on that ideologically compromised classic. Other incongruous details are less conceptual, like the surprising-- but entirely welcome-- surf guitar tones on the somber ""Hellfire"" or ""Alice""'s gleeful, inscrutably worded coda: ""Alice you've gone too far/ Howl with the howling dogs."" (Turns out that last bit's a remnant of the original lyrics... about a golden retriever.) What keeps these songs from being intellectually aloof inside baseball games? An organizing principle that assumes the musical past isn't so much a museum exhibit as an interactive theme park. Far from treating their influences as static taste markers, Yellow Fever assumes classic pop songs can form a dialogue with their own. Even when these conversations seem more whimsical than productive, it's fun to hear the band's imagination at work. Besides, this is only their first LP-- or not even that. YellowFever assembles several earlier EPs and singles, going back to 2006. The collection's chronological sequencing makes it easy to track their sound's evolution-- from an ascetic mix of hand-in-glove harmonies paired with Adam Jones' throbbing bass, to the more sophisticated structures and confident vocals of ""Culver City"" and ""Joe Brown"". Fortunately, these last two, the band's most recent recordings, also own their best melodies. So even as YellowFever mature, they obviously aren't abandoning the playful catchiness that made them popular on Austin's club circuit in the first place.","Playing girl-group pop drenched in noise, like their pals Vivian Girls, YellowFever offer more surprises and Easter eggs on this hyper-aware record.

Together You and I,Barton Carroll,by: Stephen M.

In a modestly fragile tenor, he relates real stories instead of impressionistic poetry or woe-is-me folk confessions, full of acute observations and complex emotional developments. It's literary in the sense that he has a strong grasp of character and voice, not in the sense that he favors big words or clever turns of phrase. Carroll may never be called innovative, but he can't be called showy either, which places him in the school of troubadours like Freedy Johnston and John Hiatt, who have a similar folksy bent and a shared itch to try on new perspectives. Carroll's fourth solo album, Together You and I, marks a great step forward from his previous releases, which were mostly solid collections of studied songs and varied lives. On the new material, he sounds more comfortable in these disparate points of view, and thanks to producer Graig Markel, he can better bend the musical elements to reinforce the lyrics. Illuminated by Craig Flory's raunchy-sweet saxophone, the witty ""Past Tense"" struts with a Sun Studios shuffle that bolsters the bluster of its narrator, who is hot for teacher: ""Well, Little Miss Professor's got a problem with me/ Ever since you went and got a master degree."" Throughout ""The Poor Boy Can't Dance"", Carroll's narrator-- an American immigrant in Britain-- steels himself to dance with the boss' daughter at a wedding, swallowing shot after shot. Rather than leave his fate undetermined, Carroll soldiers through to a potentially happy ending as a swing band cuts in to remind listeners of both the setting and the stakes. ""Rich as a Rolling Stone"" recounts a very different romantic encounter, one full of miscommunications and cross purposes between an overeager man and a grounded woman. She counters and contradicts his practiced compliments, revealing a realistic outlook that only seems like cynicism: In fact, she wants a man who ""would be beautiful like Buddy Holly and rich as a Rolling Stone,"" and she's not afraid to keep looking. Playing referee, Carroll sings with an uneasy tone, slurring his words almost drunkenly but pushing the song at a subtly nervous clip that implies a fraught exchange. Carroll flirts with cliché in many of these songs, but only so he can twist the story. ""Shadowman"" plays out as a tale of a favored son and a black sheep, and just when the story seems most predictable, it flies off into darker territory as Carroll sketches out the unexpected tragedies that fill every life. Dispelling certain easy notions of true love and secure relationships, Together You and I recounts characters trying desperately to turn chance meetings and petty hook-ups into something longer and more meaningful. ""Do you want to get out of here?"" he asks an unidentified woman on a song with the same title. ""I don't need to finish my beer."" No one ever finishes their beer on Together You and I, and it's to his considerable credit that Carroll makes clear that many of these denizens come to regret leaving that glass half emptied.","The folk troubadour's fourth album bends musical elements to reinforce his lyrics, which show a strong grasp of character and voice.

Pop Ambient 2010,Various Artists,by: Andrew Gaerig,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a80d5e6ef9596932110f/1:1/w_160/4d510739.jpg,2010-01-27 06:00:02,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13863-pop-ambient-2010/,Kompakt,"One decade in, Kompakt's Pop Ambient series can stand tall next to its brother-in-arms Total series as a documentation of the style and form of a singular label. Plenty has changed in 10 years, though, and Kompakt's totem franchises now seem like matters of simple upkeep rather than label highlights or genre events. Kompakt's two major releases in 2009, the Field's Yesterday & Today and Matias Aguayo's Ay Ay Ay, both saw attention from more than dedicated beatheads, while PA09 featured more tracks than ever from outside the label's roster. Perhaps appropriately, there is a chore-like throb to PA10, with many series standbys swapping back in and few draws for the merely curious. The Pop Ambient series is a little like living in a small town, such that the standards for big news are radically altered. Here's your PA10 headline: 2009's breakout experimental composer, Brock Van Wey, appears twice as bvdub, serving up an EP's worth (21+ minutes) of new music. Other not-as-frequent contributors to the series include DJ Koze (a Total regular) and the rare new production from Dettinger. If there's a sonic constant this year, it's slowly revolving peals of sound: guitars, pianos, and horns set to slowly lap against background tones. There is an attractive industriousness to Jürgen Paape's ""864M"", while Koze's ""Bodenweich"" pairs padded piano chords against slurring electronics. Bvdub impresses twice, first with the haunted vocal patches of ""Lest You Forget"" and, moreso, with the 17-minute ""Will You Know Where to Find Me"", which beautifully splices a choral sample into sheets of diva-noise, easily competing with the best of 2009's White Clouds Drift On and On. Next to bvdub's material, however, much of PA10 seems overly simple. Dettinger's ""Therefore"" features a two-second rhythmic shard looped for more than five minutes of wearying homogeneity. Marsen Jules' album-opening ""The Sound of One Lip Kissing"" features huge reverberating pianos that clang and batter to distraction. Old hands the Orb turn in the sleepy ""Glen Coe"", which wavers and reflects dully. Andrew Thomas and Mikkel Metal, two frequent PA contributors, each offer a track of harmless sound-sculpting. PA10 arrives as Total 10 did last year: without fanfare or notice celebrating a decade of studious, mostly worthwhile compiling (one could reasonably argue that two regular label-comps per year is celebration enough). Instead, we get another workmanlike volume, one less distinguished and notable than its predecessors. Next year's model will almost surely arrive, just as regular and with as little fanfare; here's hoping it better reflects Kompakt's still considerable import.","A pair of Brock Van Wey tracks, plus new ones from DJ Koze and Dettinger highlight the latest version of Kompakt's annual ambient series.

FabricLive 49,Buraka Som Sistema,by: Nate Patrin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a7c9c0084474cd0c0c95/1:1/w_160/718f6453.jpg,2010-01-27 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13814-fabriclive-49/,Fabric,"""World music"" is a reductive term, and has been pretty much from the get-go; any genre name that can be used to describe both South African township music and Algerian raï could stand to have a few more qualifiers added. But with the acceleration of trans-cultural scene-splicing arising from increased mobility and the Internet's instant accessibility, it makes more sense as a catchall term than it did 15 years ago. After Buraka Som Sistema took the Portuguese importation of Angola's electronic Afro-soca kuduro sounds and pushed it into the same vogue that neo-ghettotech and Brazilian baile funk enjoyed earlier in the 2000s, it became obvious how approachable this strain of music could be from just about any cultural angle. And so FabricLive 49 pulls in cross-pollinated sounds from across the globe-- producers, remixers, and vocalists from Angola, Portugal, the U.S., the UK, Jamaica, Peru, Argentina, France, Austria, and Estonia are represented-- and throws them together in a way that shrugs at borders. But while it's thrilling to hear these sounds unified in a way that exhibits the universality of a certain beat, the breath-snatching density of it all doesn't give individual sounds much elbow room. It's not easy to find a foothold, which isn't a slam against the music itself. It's just that it's paced in a way that makes you scramble to catch up. Opening with a track like Dre Skull's Sizzla electro-dancehall feature ""Gone Too Far"" (how's that for a title to start a mix?) puts things off on a prematurely amped-up note. It sounds more like something you'd drop in the middle of a set to jolt energy levels than an opener, and they get a bit too rapidfire in their attempts to ratchet things up a couple levels from there. Weaving together two different mixes of BSS' ""General"" (Stenchman's buzzing, spitting dubstep rework and L-Vis 1990's ghetto/house version) is a sharp trick, but before that fusion can take root, Ku Bo's ""Tsu Bo"" spills over into it and lets its burbling rattle dominate. And then that gets crushed under the dr [#script:http://pitchfork.com/media/backend/js/tiny_mce/themes/advanced/langs/en.js]|||||| y hydraulics and rusty-crank rattle of DJ Znobia's ""Pausa"", which itself bursts like an old cartoon boiler as soon as Roulet's mix of Black Diamond standout ""Kurum"" stomps in. It'd make for a great mid-mix peak; coming in the first 10 minutes, it's almost like you need to pause for a moment just to recharge. The restless middle section of the mix almost feels like a diversion in comparison, the insistent kuduro rhythms splintering into hints at electro and UK funky before dropping into a bracing detour through dubstep. The overstuffed lead-in recedes into a comparatively spacious second act, Skream's brisk but clean uptempo machine-gun wobble ""Fick"" crumbling away into the relative calm of BSS member DJ Riot's dreamlike, harp-plucking ""Mermaid Dub"" before shuddering back to trapped-animal agitation with Zomby's chattering ""Dynamite Sandwich"". (The latter two tracks, aside from anchoring the mix's best stretch, make their debut here.) By the time the obligatory nod to hip-hop comes in the form of Crime Mob's spare, minimalist (but nod-provoking) ""Rock Yo Hips"", it all starts to make a bewildering sort of sense. Then it's back to the thick of things, with all sorts of slippery polyrhythmic jump cuts piling over each other and threatening to overpower you almost as much as they provoke your impulse to move. Fortunately, the density's broken up by the time FabricLive 49 hits its final stretch. While the first five tracks zoom by in just over nine minutes, the last five churn along at 18 and change. Selections from Harvard Bass and Novalima, and a BSS remix of Major Lazer get a good stretch to unfold on their own terms and insinuate themselves more easily. Where the music's given space to stretch, the collisions between musical traditions become that much more exciting. FabricLive 49's strengths come when the barrages settle down, letting the extended grooves of each song make it a lot clearer how little global distance is actually separating them.","A hugely diverse and dense mix from the Portuguese outfit includes selections from Zomby, Major Lazer, Crime Mob, and many more.

Realism,The Magnetic Fields,by: Matt LeMay,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a80fc0084474cd0c0d40/1:1/w_160/5b4afd33.jpg,2010-01-27 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13876-realism/,Nonesuch,"In the 10 years since the Magnetic Fields released 69 Love Songs, Stephin Merritt's ornate orchestrations and wry, referential lyrics have gone from indie rock anomalies to NPR staples. And while countless artists have successfully tempered the emotional gratification of ""rock"" with self-aware sophistication, Merritt continues to defiantly withhold the former. Merritt embraces artifice where other musicians disavow it, willfully avoiding (or outright mocking) gestures at ""sincerity"" and presenting his songs as stylized works of fiction. Even Merritt's earliest work with the Magnetic Fields found its most devastating moments via lyrical irony and musical footnotes. The Magnetic Fields will never release an ""arty indie rock"" record, even though they were instrumental in making such records de rigeur. For the second album in a row, Merritt is placing an aesthetic conceit front-and-center. While 2008's Distortion was a foray into Jesus and Mary Chain-style squalls of feedback, new LP Realism is Merritt's characteristically self-aware play at a ""folk"" record.  This approach is not entirely new territory for Merritt; 2004's i casts a broadly similar sonic footprint to Realism. The difference largely comes down to arrangement; on i, the Magnetic Fields often sounded like a small ensemble playing together in a room. Here, Merritt's approach is more wide-ranging; gang vocals abound, as do bevies of non-traditional string instruments. Of course, Merritt would not be so gauche as to turn in an ""acoustic guitar and vocals"" record, and those hoping to find anything even remotely autobiographical or directly emotive on Realism will be sorely disappointed; if anything, Realism is Merritt's most cold and distant-sounding record to date. This contrast, or course, is not lost on Merritt. Sure enough, Realism is not a ""documentary"" recording but rather a collection of elaborate, immaculately constructed songs, each encapsulating its own (distorted) ""reality."" There's even a note of operational irony here, as the compression necessary to bring Realism to a marketable volume makes it as loud as Distortion. But while Distortion saw Merritt gleefully twisting streams of feedback into palp [#script:http://pitchfork.com/media/backend/js/tiny_mce/themes/advanced/langs/en.js]|||||| able melancholy, Realism comes off just a little too dry, too straightforward. Merritt's formalism paired excellently with unexpected genres like synth-pop and distorted rock, but such a stately approach to such a stately sound yields frustratingly sterile results. Opener ""You Must Be Out of Your Mind"" is both promising and portentous. Within 10 seconds, Merritt's songwriting strengths are on full display: strong melodies given room to breathe, thoughtful and funny lyrics, concise and elegant structure. But ""You Must Be Out of Your Mind"" sounds suspiciously like a drum-less rehash of i standout ""I Don't Believe You"". The ""Interlude"" that follows all but derails the album mere minutes in, and cries out for a more flattering context; it's a narrative song sans narrative, cultivating a flighty and groundless mood (hence the title) with no real lead-up or comedown. The opening bars of ""I Don't Know What to Say"" constitute the loveliest moment on the record, but like far too much of Realism, the song seems frozen in suspended animation and put behind glass. This heightened sense of artifice is not accidental; on songs like ""The Dolls' Tea Party"" and ""Painted Flower"", Merritt is more or less explicitly painting still-lifes. These, along with ""We Are Having a Hootenanny"" and the surprisingly re-listenable ""The Dada Polka"" fall broadly under the ""kitsch/novelty"" category of Merritt's work, but these songs are really no better or worse then the rest of Realism. The variety show approach Merritt takes to his records is part and parcel of the Magnetic Fields' M.O.; I'm not even sure what it would sound like if Merritt attempted to create a ""masterpiece"" in the traditional sense. As a result, even the weakest songs on Realism aren't simple throwaways. ""Always Already Gone"" will be right at home on the next mix you send to your favorite critical theory major (alongside ""The Death of Ferdinand de Saussure"" from 69 Love Songs). Looking for some music to play at your next holiday party?  Allow me to recommend ""Everything Is One Big Christmas Tree"". As rock music listeners, we are generally given to degrading music that seems so rooted in a specific theme or purpose. Realism is not a sit-down-and-listen-to-it-all-the-way-through record, but neither is any Magnetic Fields release. The problem with Realism isn't that it is too clever or too campy, but rather that these qualities are merely reflected in its finely polished exterior. At his best and at his worst, Merritt is smart, thorough, and unerringly precise; the distinction lies in which songs simply display these qualities, and which songs channel them into moving, memorable and/or hilarious works of art. Here, Merritt's songs are as delicate and meticulous as porcelain miniatures. Unfortunately, Realism holds more tchotchkes than museum pieces.","Stephin Merritt explores another aesthetic conceit on his latest record, creating a characteristically self-aware play at a ""folk"" record.

One-Armed Bandit,Jaga Jazzist,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a7e0ea9e61561daa56b3/1:1/w_160/11a621e5.jpg,2010-01-26 06:00:04,Jazz,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13822-one-armed-bandit/,Ninja Tune,"Jaga Jazzist, a nine-piece Norwegian ensemble, is among the leadings lights of the new Scandinavian jazz, but their sound resonates strongly with North American-style post-rock, too. Woodwinds, brass, and a Fender Rhodes often carry Jaga's melodies, but electric guitars hold the line just as often. Their percussion, while intricate, is always brawny and propulsive. Their music is structured as to allow for a broad variety of genre allusions, from classical to krautrock. And it revels in tension and release, albeit with more instrumental dexterity than many post-rock bands can muster. Each of their albums seems like a new negotiation between art music and pop music, as if they still aren't sure which kind of band they are, and how much they can get away with on either side. Jaga's last LP, 2005's What We Must, was excellent in part because it felt unequivocal-- it was Jaga Jazzist being a rock band, without compunction. Many of its most thrilling qualities are retained on One-Armed Bandit. The floaty UFO themes from bandleader Lars Horntveth's Kaleidoscopic are present in force, and some less-standard Jaga elements-- tropical polyrhythms, modernist patterns, and even techno-inspired synth sequences-- make their sound heartier than before. They also make it more diffused, and the new album lacks the emphatic clarity of What We Must. It's clinically better, but slightly less loveable, emphasizing virtuosity at the occasional expense of immediacy. Sometimes, like Jon Hassell's good-despite-itself 2009 album, Last Night the Moon Came Dropping Its Clothes in the Street, it just gets a little too swanky for comfort. The thumping bass and woodwind grooves are usually pleasing, but occasionally slide into mildly numbing, session-honed clichés. At these times, you get the sense that the band can churn out rock-solid modulations all day, which is admirable but not that exciting. And sometimes, they just try to do too much, although this becomes egregious only once in a while: ""220 V / Spektral"" starts off great, with chimes and tiny pianos and guitars trickling in smart little trills. But this arrangement barely has time to shape up before it breaks into a jazzy lope, then bends krautward with acidic guitar chords, swoops down into spacey funk, rocks out, krauts up again... you see how this is going too far, too fast. We can't keep up, and the band seems so focused on their chops they probably don't even notice we're panting in the dust cloud behind them. But when the variations are more subtle and less blatantly showy, they're terrific. On the title track, questing horn lines unravel around a dancing, medieval-sounding arpeggio, which later reappears voiced more like a kalimba, with the rolling bass now in the forefront, lean with distortion. Seamlessly, the back becomes the front and the front, the back. Then there's a galloping quick-time bridge, with slow peals of brass prefiguring a crashing climax, which verges on a free-jazz shriek. All these prismatic refractions point to one clear, climbing shape-- a song you can hold onto, even as its surface morphs and streams. On ""Bananfleur Overalt"", the interludes of terse funk and pounding minimalism keep bringing us back to the wonderfully songful theme. And on the long ""Toccata"", a taut weave of hypnotic synth tones brightens with natural piano sounds, culminating with righteously skipping horns-- a somehow-straight line between cerebral shimmer and spiritual fire. One-Armed Bandit occasionally overshoots the mark, but when it doesn't, the scenic route it took to get there proves worthwhile.","The ambitious Norwegian band with a hard-to-define jazz/ post-rock sound returns with another eclectic album.

The Biggest Ragga Dancehall Anthems 2009 / The Biggest Reggae One-Drop Anthems 2009,Various Artists,by: Jess Harvell,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a7dd13d1975652139506/1:1/w_160/1a9e06ca.jpg,2010-01-26 06:00:03,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13831-the-biggest-ragga-dancehall-anthems-2009-the-biggest-reggae-one-drop-anthems-2009/,Greensleeves,"The best thing about the yearly Biggest Ragga Dancehall Anthems compilations-- whose title provides you with all the backstory you need on this venerable series collecting 12 months of gems from Jamaica's premier pop genre-- is that they're consistent enough to act as comforting listening but restlessly inventive enough to surprise you each time out. The consistency runs deep, right down to the jagged-but-dance-friendly rhythmic structure of the music (for a genre as open to outside influence as any in the world, a dancehall tune is recognizable in seconds). It's there in everything from vocals that rub the near-parodically masculine against a sugary sweetness to themes that explore with the tension between the need to do bad and the urge to do right. But dancehall producers rarely develop the kind of set-in-stone sonic signature we come to expect from their U.S. peers, and if they do become known for a crucial riddim (think of Lenky becoming king-of-the-handclaps in 2002 with ""Diwali""), they shuck it just as quickly in order to keep the attention of dancehall's novelty-hungry audience. 2009's installment feels both all-over-the-map-- an hour of oddities, out-crass-the-other-guy smashes, and the usual perverse hybrids of various global party sounds-- and oddly familiar. (That's partly because the divisions between Caribbean and North American pop are as porous as they've ever been.) Plenty of tunes here nearly blind you with the digital gleam of late-decade R&B-- Jamaicans have clearly been bingeing as hard on T-Pain as the rest of the planet, even if they apply his evil teachings with a modicum more taste than your average Yank-- and workmanlike synth-soul is the closest the compilation gets to any sort of sonic consistency. But-- and this is the sort of assessment that perhaps only someone following the genre day-to-day might be able to make with any accuracy-- it also seems that dancehall has settled down somewhat in recent years. Put it another way: You're a lot more likely to hear a tune that sounds like 2004 in 2009 than you were likely to hear a tune that sounded like 1997 in 2002. Ragga Dancehall Anthems 2009 gets better as it gets stranger, more idiosyncratic. Not because ""stranger"" necessarily equals ""better,"" mind you, but because you don't feel quite so much like you're listening to drive-time U.S. urban radio with a diverting patina of Jamaican slang. And sometimes it's the ""pop"" stuff here that disorients the most, if only because Jamaica's definition of pop remains so open-ended as to frequently tip into the bizarre. ""Inna Life"" could easily be retitled ""Inna City""; though the drums are pure dancehall, the synth and piano are straight off a late-80s crossover house tune. Seriously: Add a canned breakbeat and it could be an early Seal single. But if Assassin's ""Pre Dis""-- a tune whose atomized video game sound effects out-psychedelizes most of dubstep's next-big-things without nearly making so big a deal out of it-- has any pop-historical reference points, I'd love to hear them. Now here's where I throw in the ""it's really good BUT"" caveat for all of those expecting a state-of-dancehall summary as garnish with this product review. What The Biggest Ragga Dancehall Anthems 2009 lacks is the sense that a specific sound or riddim or vibe has the island in its grip, the kind of obsession that forces the genre into unexpected new places. (Techno-influenced tunes in the early 00s, Far Eastern exoticism a few years later, fast-paced soca by mid-decade.) All-over-the-map it may be as a whole, but many tunes here induce a not-always-pleasant déjà vu. (The synthetic strings on Chase Cross' ""Better Days"" were ugly five years ago; now they're ugly and tired.) I'd be plenty happy if the 2010 installment was equally as entertaining. But I'd just a little happier if I felt like I had no idea what next year might bring. On the other hand, we all know what The Biggest Reggae One-Drop Anthems will sound like this time next year. The grown-folks cousin to the Ragga Dancehall series, One-Drop Anthems is consistent to a fault. One-Drop Anthems presents a world where it is perpetually 1974, and little has changed in Jamaican music except the technology employed to make it. The skanking rhythms of classic roots-- with the well-familiar galloping pianos, carnival-esque electric organs, and clipped guitar riffs-- are reaffirmed as a living art, made and enjoyed by old and young alike, rather than historical curios, something more akin to guys selling hand-burned CD-R's of ""Tom Dooley"" covers out of a trunk at a folk festival. It's subdued and unabashedly reverential where Biggest Ragga Dancehall Anthems is club-friendly and catholic. I've always been vaguely suspicious of the series for reasons that are only sort of defensible: Not to come off like a luddite, but if you A/B a lot of this stuff with classic roots, the synthetic backing tracks can sound gratingly ersatz, sometimes one step from the quick-and-dirty competency of a one-man session band employed by ad agencies for a little Caribbean color. On the 2009 edition, only the brooding bassline on Mr. Williamz's anti-tobacco tirade ""No Cigarette"" has the musical impact of anything on Biggest Ragga Dancehall Anthems. So thank goodness the singing remains lovely. Spiritually impassioned, too, even if I prefer the lover's rock moments to the righteously gritty or 21st-century pop-friendly ones. These happen to be the singers who most slavishly imitate (or pay homage) to the heroes of the pre-dancehall era, which is why, a little ironically given my carping above, I'll take Beres Hammond looking back to doo-wop over the maybe-we-could-break-this-in-America Rihanna-isms of Lukie D and M'Lonie's ""No Air"". Speaking of the tried and true: No roots singer here approaches Sizzla for sheer emotion-per-note intensity. On ""Gwaan Bear"" he snarls sweetly, which I wasn't even sure was possible before listening, as if he hit the studio expecting a furious dancehall track and decided to run with it when his producer keyed up the plangent guitars. And though none of them is quite as unique as Sizzla, it's the voices that provide the bulk of Biggest Reggae One-Drop Anthems's pleasure/interest. It's a suitably old-school virtue to center a retro-minded series around, but if you're new to roots reggae, you're still better off exploring the old-school before dallying with the retro.","Greensleeves Records issues its two high-profile, annual looks at the past 12 months' worth of the most fruitful types of Jamaican pop.

Setting the Paces,BOAT,by: David Bevan,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a7cec0084474cd0c0ca3/1:1/w_160/a5a27d42.jpg,2010-01-26 06:00:02,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13816-setting-the-paces/,Magic Marker,"Before moving to Seattle six years ago, BOAT's David Crane was a schoolteacher in Chicago. Apparently he didn't enjoy his former line of work, but it must have flipped some sort of switch. If the many narratives that have populated his pop songs are to be believed, he was very much in his element: Comics. Video games. Dinosaurs. Baseball cards. Homework. Trying to make sense of girls. Since morphing a basement solo project into a celebrated live band, Crane's songs have gone back in time in search of parallels. Setting the Paces, BOAT's third LP, ups the production values but dives even deeper down that wormhole. As Pitchfork's Marc Hogan nailed during a track review of single ""Lately"" a while back, the guitar dressings here fall ""between Pavement slack and Tullycraft twee."" (NERD BONUS: iTunes conveniently spits out ""Post-Twee"" when filing Setting the Paces' genre tag.) That means BOAT's music keeps pace with Crane's quirks, and the sounds and themes dovetail. But while the filament that lines and lights most of these songs is certainly ""twee"" by nature, this is a rock record. That comes through in the aforementioned hike in fidelity. Guitars are brighter than before, shout-a-long choruses meaty enough to bite. The handclaps sound great, too. ""Lately"" is a clear highlight and perfect example. Palm-muted tick-tocking gives way to a full-blast power chord workout and on to a chuggable chorus. Crane even does a great Stephen Malkmus impression (check the way he croaks ""my teeth won't have to chatt-ah""), though the smirking here is more playful than devilish. At the center of it all is one gooey, delicious hook. And thankfully, these elements come together often through Setting the Paces' 40-minute, 14-track entirety. From the ""Victoria""-mined verve of ""Prince of Tacoma"" to the quiet beauty of ""100 Calorie Man"", no stretch is skip-over territory. Every song is irrepressible in its own right. But something about it all rings empty: though the sonics definitely take it to the house, Crane struggles to connect. Lyrically, we're zigzagged back and forth through a few decades of young man's blues, subjected to silly rhyme schemes, nachos with mom, and dancing centipedes. To coat things with humor is very much Crane's game and while it makes for a real party in a live setting, the dork schtick on record serves only to obscure how strong these songs are. In fact, Setting the Paces' most resonant moments happen when Crane sits still long enough to go deeper, to pull back a few layers. It's not until the sore-throated coda of ""We Want It! We Want It!"" that he seems to focus long and hard on some tension in need of release. A heartbreaker, ""You're Muscular"" closes the record on a note equally naked. Crane's melody keeps pace with his poetry and not the other way around.","Pacific Northwest songwriter David Crane beefs up a batch of songs about childhood and innocence with meatier rock production on BOAT's latest.

Acolyte,Delphic,by: Stephen Troussé,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a80413d1975652139564/1:1/w_160/f97f19fe.jpg,2010-01-26 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13873-acolyte/,Polydor,"Delphic emerged from the BBC's recent poll of tastemakers as the nation's most hotly tipped new indie band, but in 2010, in the UK, this is not such a great accolade. It's a sign of the post-Britpop times that in the final tipsheet the band actually finished third, trailing behind a couple of arty female pop acts (think this year's version of Florence, or Little Boots). While 2009 was a golden year for U.S. indie, in the UK it was the moment the term ""landfill indie"" went mainstream, denoting the domestic glut of torpid, timid, generically retrogressive guitar bands. The post-Strokes tide that kept British indie afloat through the 00s, from Franz Ferdinand to the Libertines to the Arctic Monkeys, has finally gone out, leaving a clueless generation of charmless groups high and dry. Delphic are being heralded as a way out of this dismal situation. They're wired and sequenced for the dancefloor, as opposed to plodding and strummed for the student moshpit; suited and booted rather than dowdy in denim; stylishly poised rather than scuffling and shambolic. On the face of it they represent a break from recent orthodoxy; in truth, it's hardly a novel approach. In recent months Snow Patrol returned averring that there'd always been a dance element to their music, while Editors attempted to update their reference points all the way from 1980 to 1982 with the addition of a few studiously vintage synthesizers. In fact, if Editors had shown real commitment, persuaded their singer to take one for the team, and recruited the drummer's girlfriend on keyboards, they would doubtless sound an awful lot like Acolyte. To have reached the third paragraph of a Delphic review without mentioning New Order is practically a feat of self-discipline, but it can be avoided no longer. Delphic, let's be clear, are a rather brazen yet undistinguished attempt to reconstruct and exploit the trappings of Factory Manchester circa 1985. The funny thing is, the odd crackling guitar line and synthpad chord change apart, they actually don't sound very much like New Order. All three Delphicians did national service in the landfill trenches, and at their worst, on tracks like the opening ""Clarion Call"" and ""This Momentary"" you can still hear the lumbering basslines and prosaic piano chords of some sub-Coldplay sketch, like old wallpaper under a cheap lick of paint. At their best, the spangled guitar and chattering sequencers are more likely to put you in mind of the fleeting beauty of ""Perfume"" by Madchester also-rans Paris Angels, or even late 80s rave-pop chancers the Beloved. Though the band protest that Factory comparisons are unwanted but inevitable for any Manchester group attempting to marry rock dynamics with dance technology, that they are far too young to remember the Hacienda and are more influenced by German minimal techno, they desperately invite the comparison. Titles like ""Halcyon"", ""Ephemera"", and ""Submission"" are simply gagging to be expensively set in sepulchral type by Peter Saville. It's like they've audaciously claimed the rights to the Factory franchise, like one of those authors who's commissioned to write the new James Bond novel or Gone With the Wind sequel. And inescapably the comparison, once raised, does them no favors. Though both groups are fronted, on the face of it, by poor singers reciting vapid lyrics, you're left pondering once again the strange alchemy by which Barney Sumner was so often so lazily transcendent. And as any busker who's bashed out ""Bizarre Love Triangle"" will tell you, New Order's melodies-- which you'll search for in vain on Acolyte-- are indestructibly lovely. To be fair, Acolyte is never less than stylish: dusted with powder, brushed and polished to a fine gleam, as shiny but generic as a new car. Producer Ewan Pearson has constructed a shimmering, relentless soundworld and a couple of tracks-- ""Doubt"" and ""Counterpoint""-- attain an urgent, anxious euphoria. It's just that it feels so characterless and anonymous. Maybe in the end, Delphic are as authentic an expression of modern-day Manchester as Joy Division were of the city in their own time. It was one of the more dubious claims of Tony Wilson, after all, that Factory remade the city in its own image, that the Hacienda, once built, was a premonition and inspiration for the 21st century city of steel and glass. The British urbanist Owen Hatherley has written of how modern Mancunian speculators these days actively trade on the legacy of Factory, of how old industrial warehouses had been transformed into ""cramped speculative blocks marketed as 'luxury flats' or 'stunning developments' with an attenuated, vaguely Scandinavian aesthetic."" He adopted the term ""pseudomodernism"" to describe this capitalist appropriation of modernism as spectacle or logo, divorced from any social or political ideal. It's a term that might serve just as well to describe Delphic, or indeed a great deal of British music today, vainly trading on the modernist impulse of their 80s forebears. ""Pseumo Pop,"" then: it's no landfill indie, but for now it will have to do.","The latest attempt to rescue the UK from landfill indie, Delphic are a hotly tipped band that is being branded as a new New Order.

Teen Dream,Beach House,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a80313d1975652139561/1:1/w_160/20945b0e.jpg,2010-01-26 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13872-teen-dream/,Sub PopBella Union,"Beach House's sound was fully formed at the time of their 2006 debut. They had slow, shadowy dream-pop down; at times they recalled Mazzy Star or Galaxie 500, but songs like ""Apple Orchard"" and ""Master of None"" had a dark and blurry resonance all their own. Artists that start out so assured and distinctive can run into trouble on second, third, and fourth records. Hardcore fans are there no matter what, but others may wonder: Do I need another album from this band? When I'm in the mood for what they bring, can't I just put on what I already have? Teen Dream, Beach House's third album and first for Sub Pop, obliterates these concerns. This is both the most diverse and most listenable of their three full-lengths, and yet it never seems like a compromise. It feels like the product of careful, thoughtful growth, bringing in new influences-- bits of mid-1970s Fleetwood Mac, sparkling indie pop, even a few soul and gospel touches--- while maintaining the group's core sound. Teen Dream is a stirring reminder that good things can happen when you move out of your comfort zone. The interplay between Victoria Legrand's voice and droning keyboards and Alex Scally's guitars is still the key element of the band's aesthetic. But here, each song has its own palette, which creates new possibilities. So the repetitive guitar figure, double-time kick drum, and crashing cymbals in the opening ""Zebra"" immediately suggest movement, signaling that this record will have a dramatic sweep unheard on the band's more pensive beginnings. And the whispery ""ah-ah-ah"" backing vocals that open ""Norway"" imply a new openness to the allure of pop pleasure, as that bit of ear candy finds a sharp contrast in the seasick-sounding slide that hovers over the verses. More somber ballads like ""Better Times"" and ""Silver Soul"" have the thick, churning gloom familiar from earlier records, but they acquire more force by being placed alongside tracks that allow for more light. Front to back, the arrangements and sequencing are superb. Despite the brighter, more pop-informed sound and an album title that brings to mind the hazy nostalgia of youth, Teen Dream has a pretty sad heart. Because the music is so effective, the churn of emotions is there even when you don't know exactly what Legrand is singing about (this can happen easily with her unusual phrasing). But a closer listen reveals songs about uncertainty, doubt, and feeling beaten down by the world. ""Walk in the Park"" sounds romantic on paper, but this is a journey taken alone as a way to try and forget someone who is no longer around. The choppy verses, nudged along by the sort of cheap drum machine Beach House use expertly to suggest loneliness, explode sideways into a shimmering chorus that finds Legrand busting out a time-heals-all-wounds affirmation over a calliope organ. This chorus turn is a big moment that gets more affecting with more listens, lunging from resigned sorrow to an anxious plea, and it accomplishes this mood swing with a damn catchy melodic hook. A similar lift-off happens on ""10 Mile Stereo"", when the song shifts from its deliberate opening bars to its rushing and noisy main section that's as close as Beach House have come to true shoegaze. The gorgeous racket is affixed to a song about feeling dead inside after another failed relationship: ""Limbs parallel/ We stood so long, we fell."" Though the Teen Dream lyrics are printed in the booklet, they lose their power on the page. ""Real Love"", from the album's less immediate but equally rewarding second half, has my favorite imagery from the record, and is also Legrand's best vocal performance. At first, it's just her and a piano, with chords that lean toward gospel. Hearing her voice in such a spare setting reinforces just how rich, earthy, and, dare I say it, soulful it really is. ""I met you somewhere in a hell beneath the stairs,"" she sings, ""There's someone in that room that frightens you when they go boom, boom, boom."" There's pain in these lines, but her cracking, husky intonation amplifies it tenfold. It's easy to miss that Legrand's presence is forceful and deep rather than ethereal and angelic, but here these qualities stand out like never before, lending her darker laments extra weight. As with Liars' Drum's Not Dead, the Teen Dream CD comes with a DVD containing videos for each of the record's songs, all by different directors. The clips range from 8mm found footage to colorful Flash collages to silly stories that clash with the music in a big way. To be honest, it's a little overwhelming to be dealing with 10 videos when you're getting to know an album, and I'm not sold on this sort of package at this point. The DVD, while it looks reasonably interesting, seems like something to spend time with later, after the record has had a chance to sink in. For now, I'm more inclined to close my eyes and imagine my own pictures for Teen Dream. The music has been inspiring some pretty vivid ones.","Teen Dream is both the most diverse and most listenable of the Baltimore band's three full-lengths, and yet it never seems like a compromise.

Five American Portraits,Red Krayola With Art & Language,by: Andrew Gaerig,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a7f65e6ef959693210d3/1:1/w_160/d68c9ecc.jpg,2010-01-25 06:00:04,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13854-five-american-portraits/,Drag City,"For anyone capable of finding Red Krayola's burr-laden rock comforting, Mayo Thompson has likely achieved Lou Reed-status: as long as someone's playing an electric guitar slowly and with an appropriate cadence, the man's voice contains a familiar grace. But whatever level of devotion he engenders, Thompson seems determined to test. On Five American Portraits, Thompson and friends offer very long, very literal descriptions of five characters set loosely to a host of classic tunes. Portraits once again finds Thompson collaborating with Art & Language as well as Jim O'Rourke and the Raincoats' Gina Birch.  Each portrait is paired with two or three tracks befitting its background: Jimmy Carter set to ""Georgia on My Mind""; George W. Bush to ""I've Been Working on the Railroad""; Wile E. Coyote to Bo Diddley's ""Roadrunner"". The lyrics are expository, literal, and not necessarily helpful if you don't know what these figures look like. What could reasonably considered the first verse of ""John Wayne"" proceeds as follows: ""The dent on the right side of the crown/ Of the hat/ The outer surface of the right ear/ Some loose skin below the right eyelid/ A crease below the right eye."" Finally, after a handful of similar descriptions: ""...of John Wayne."" (Play along at home: resist the temptation to Google image search Ad Reinhardt.) Your first listen will probably result in a chuckle-- ""Oh, portraits!""-- and your eighth listen will probably result in a chuckle-- Jimmy Carter and Georgia-- and the rest of your listens will probably be confusing. The reason it will take you eight listens to identify ""Georgia on My Mind"" is because the band retains little distinguishing characteristics save chord progressions (the liner notes are helpful) and Thompson and Birch are even more liberal in their interpretations, even putting aside the fact that they're slotting in these stilted descriptions. Birch is shriller and more assertive than the female vocalists Thompson yielded to on Sighs Trapped by Liars, which makes her a fine foil, but Portraits' best moments still come when the concepts lull and Thompson's voice settles in. Thompson warms over Bo's hiccupping licks on ""Wile E Coyote"", and he affects a not-as-gimmicky-as-you-might-think twang (he's from Houston, remember) during ""John Wayne"", which stands as one of the most listenable 15-minute tracks Thompson's ever been involved in. Nothing in Thompson's history suggests he is above this sort of bullshit joke, nor is he tentative about art-for-art's sake and the easy answer to the question Portraits poses is ""It's both."" It's sort of a perfect concept for Thompson: it's not particularly clever or abstract but to actually gather the efforts, time, and resources to release this album-- straight-faced-- seems mad. At this point, though, those who delight in Thompson's particular madness will need no explanations.","With help from Jim O'Rourke and the Raincoats' Gina Birch, Red Krayola and A&L combine classic tunes with portraits of famous figures.

Book of Leaves,Rachel Grimes,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a7b45e6ef9596932103f/1:1/w_160/ce25a8cc.jpg,2010-01-25 06:00:03,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13798-book-of-leaves/,RuminanCe,"Louisville-based pianist Rachel Grimes is best known for her work with Rachel's, one of indie's best chamber music ensembles. They were more neo-classical than post-rock, but during their run from the early-mid 1990s to the early-mid 2000s, they seemed to fit nonetheless. Strangely, they weren't named for Grimes, but rather fellow member Jason Noble's Toyota Corolla. Still, she became somewhat synonymous with the band in the minds of its fans, even as she went on to work with King's Daughters & Sons. Book of Leaves, her first solo album, is like a warm embrace from an old friend, carrying on in the same neo-classical vein as her old group, but now with only piano (and a few frogs). The starkness of the recording is a good match for the snow-covered world outside my window at this writing, but it works regardless of the weather. These compositions came together over years as Grimes has worked with her own bands and as a hired session player, but they have a natural flow from one to the next, with simple themes and chord changes preserving a consistent mood in all of them. One of the most arresting compositions is the second, ""Every Morning"". It proceeds without fuss through a series of small themes that pulse along, buoyed by dynamic contrast-- her playing mimics an echo. She reprises it with a bit more flourish on the penultimate track, the second time allowing distant bird sounds to mingle with the music. Across the record she employs other field recordings from nature, though never with a lot of fanfare. The forest full of frogs on ""At the Pond"" is simply presented as a naturalistic interlude. Even when her animal pals are present, though, Grimes has crafted an album that sounds and feels truly solitary-- the halting chords of ""The Corner Room"", the frenetic interlocking melodies of ""My Dear Companion"" (a distant relative of Rachel's ""Arterial""), the sudden cascades of ""She Was Here"", and the chord sheets of ""Mossgrove"" all have the feel of creativity accessed while in between encounters with other people. That time between is something we all need now and then, and this record resonates primarily because of how well it embodies the nourishment of aloneness.","Best known for her stint in chamber ensemble Rachel's, the Louisville pianist's solo debut is in the same neo-classical vein as her old group.

The Flexible Entertainer,Pit Er Pat,by: Jason Crock,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a7d3c0084474cd0c0cb0/1:1/w_160/aa3346b0.jpg,2010-01-25 06:00:02,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13825-the-flexible-entertainer/,Thrill Jockey,"Though The Flexible Entertainer marks some big changes for the group, Pit Er Pat are used to reinvention by now. They began as a backing crew for a singer-songwriter who since left the band, and now have pared down from three members to two since the release of their previous album, High Time. Before their last European tour as a duo, they started writing songs for just sampler, guitar, and voice-- in part to keep the energy level up throughout the set, and partly to travel light. This practically grounded aesthetic choice led to the songs on their dance- and R&B-borrowing new album, which is likely the band's boldest step forward of their career. Having previously fed on a diet of everything post-punk, the band's now opening up to rhythms and sounds from modern R&B. ""Water"", with no guitar or live drums to speak of, opens the record on the most conspicuous shift, as singer Fay Davis-Jeffers tries out more direct, suggestive couplets, one a beat that nods to Timbaland's late-1990s heyday. That said, there's no mistaking it's them: The vocals of Davis-Jeffers are still somewhere between coy and detached, and on the following track, ""Nightroom"", the clean, minimal guitar that dominated the band's previous albums makes itself heard. These are compelling parts, but rarely do the songs add up to more than their sum. There's a promising middle ground on tracks like ""Godspot"", where reverberating keys add hair-raising tension while guitar and keyboards duel around the main melody line. Some of Pit Er Pat's most pronounced rhythms are found on the faux-drum-circle workout ""Summer Rose"" and the extended runtime of ""Emperor of Charms""-- the closest they come here to breaking a sweat. But it's on the final track, ""Specimen"", where they take these elements somewhere more unexpected. Everything gets slowed to a menacing crawl, deep bass hits, the guitar buried under reverb, judicious echo on the drums, and a melodica sounding out a distress call. Minimalism should be the common thread between the band's older music and the particular strain of pop they're channeling here, and yet they seem at odds in many of these tracks. Icy and stiff has been the band's M.O., but its new material demands performances that command that sparseness rather than toy with it. Had the band drawn on some of that confidence from R&B as well as the instrumentation, it could have made this record even more compelling.","Having previously fed on a diet of everything post-punk, the now-duo is opening up to rhythms and sounds from modern R&B.

Sturm,The Notwist,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a7fdc0084474cd0c0d16/1:1/w_160/68f70976.jpg,2010-01-25 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13856-sturm/,Alien Transistor,"It's only fair to cut film scores some slack and judge them as non-canonical diversions. They're dependent on missing imagery, and often released mainly as advertisements for the films. But when a beloved band's name is on the cover, we can't help but feel as if we're being promised a little more-- that the release has an aesthetic motivation beyond the promotional. If Hans-Christian Schmid's film, Storm, has fans, then perhaps this score will be useful to them. But it will do little for any but the most adoringly blinkered Notwist fans. It's so thin and generic that selling it as a Notwist record feels faintly deceitful, as it could be by anybody, for any moody indie film. Brevity is great when it's focused around moving themes or a sense of development, but the microtonal squalls and static melodies the Notwist work in here need more time to sink in, and are unproductive when portioned out over 11 tracks in under half an hour. Perhaps they suit the film wonderfully. This is the Notwist's second collaboration with Schmid, so something must click there. But out of context, it just sounds like they gathered up all the usual haunting-soundtrack materials around them-- glockenspiels and bowed xylophones, minimal pianos and strings, pressurized electronic loops-- and failed to do anything with them except idle in a low gear. Certainly nothing offends the ear, barring perhaps the shrill ridges of tone that compose the entirety of ""Simon"". But the score comes to its quick conclusion with a distinct sense of, ""That's it?"" There's something bloodless about these pieces that dulls the impact of even time-proven soundtrack tricks. The stiff two-note piano figure on ""Vilna Kosa Version"" (featuring the Andromeda Mega Express Orchestra) gestures toward unease without actually producing any, like a blank-faced actor holding a sign that says ""anxious."" The sonar pulse of ""The Hague"" eventually snaps into a canned trip-hop beat with grim inevitability. Flashes of potency-- the delicately tactile polyrhythms of ""Sarajevo 1"" and ""2"", and the restrained martial peals of ""Storm 1""-- are just that, flashes. It's not bad music, mostly, but it's just like all the interstitial parts of a Notwist record knitted together, without any of their terrific songcraft to sustain them. Assuming that you have a limited record-buying budget (a fanciful notion that, presumably, bands selling albums nevertheless endorse), it's the definition of inessential.","Beloved German band releases a soundtrack record so generic that selling it as a Notwist record feels faintly deceitful.

There Is Love in You,Four Tet,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a801b1335d7bf16991a0/1:1/w_160/1c526157.jpg,2010-01-25 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13861-there-is-love-in-you/,Domino,"Kieran Hebden first came on the scene in the 1990s as a member of Fridge, a post-rock outfit that to me always looked better on paper than they sounded on record. Whatever you think of his first band, Hebden's subsequent career can be seen as the idea of post-rock done right. His appetite for music, on the evidence presented in his albums, singles, DJ sets, and collaborations, is voracious. But Hebden has a way of transforming and integrating influences rather than channeling them. So if his loose improvised collaborations with drummer Steve Reid captured something of the spirit of the classic late-60s free jazz records on Impulse!, they also managed to carve out a unique and identifiable aesthetic that sounds very much like today. When working with others, like the wooly free-folk unit Sunburned Hand of the Man or the dubstep producer Burial, Hebden knows when to lead and when to get out of the way. But all the while, whatever the context, he's absorbing. And when it comes to his own records as Four Tet, he has a knack for combining sounds from all over and making them his own. Rounds is the one undisputed Four Tet classic, but all are at least good. It's not unusual for Four Tet records to have a few dull patches, but given Hebden's M.O., that's never a big problem. You expect him to explore a bit, so it's okay when once in a while something doesn't quite gel. Ringer, an intriguing EP from 2008 that throbbed with a minimal pulse and revealed a surprisingly austere side to his music, is a good example. It was the kind of record you wanted to inch closer to, because you had the sense there might be more going on beneath the surface than you'd initially realized. The follow-up album, There Is Love in You, is the glorious sound of those ideas being drawn into the light. This is the most focused Four Tet album by a huge margin, and for some listeners that could be an issue. Hebden apparently refined this music over the course of a long stint as a resident DJ at the London club Plastic People. He'd play developing tracks in his sets, see how people responded, and return to them armed with this information. And while the result isn't dance music proper, There Is Love in You definitely functions on that plane. This isn't fist-pumping music that toys with the pleasure of pop music, like one of my favorite Four Tet tunes, ""Smile Around the Face"". And it's not an album that bowls you over with the density and intricacy of its textures. Instead, it's both heady and physical, subtle but powerful music for thinking and moving or ideally doing both at the same time: It's been a while since a brisk walk through the city sounded this good. Very early in the 2000s, the corny word ""folktronica"" was sometimes applied to Four Tet's style. It never defined him, but the tag was applied because it described his fondness for samples of sounds that seem to be reverberating in a physical space. He sampled jazz cymbals, guitars, gamelan-style percussion, and voices, mixing them in with electronic squiggles and choppy breaks culled from hip-hop. Hebden's fondness for acoustic sounds caused his music to come over as unusually airy and bright. It made you think of daylight rather than the nocturnal crackle of sampled vinyl. Though Love is a very different album from those earlier records, remnants of the sound palette remain, imparting a similar sense of clarity, brightness, and warmth despite its late-night club-bound inspiration. The album begins with a crisp cymbal tap on ""Angel Echoes"" that sounds perfectly live until a quick digital stutter comes a few bars in, and then a clipped female voice, reduced to just syllables but still conveying a strong sense of yearning, begins looping into view. There are bells, a steady midtempo 4/4 kick, and that voice, and that's about it. But ""Angel Echoes"", like most of the record that follows, is strangely moving in spite of its limited toolkit. After it ends abruptly and tumbles into the brilliant ""Love Cry"", a much more drawn-out and darkly shaded tune, it starts to become clear that another inspiration could be in play: the music produced by Hebden's schoolmate, Will Bevan aka Burial. The pair collaborated on an intriguing two-track 12"" last year, and if nothing else, Hebden's consistent return here to the texture and expressive possibilities of vocal fragments forms a clear link. ""Sing"", halfway through the record, is the most affecting and flat-out gorgeous example of the technique, as it laces the propulsive housey rhythmic thrust-- the push and pull of the kick and snare, bits of percussion, a short and repetitive synth motif-- with an alien, genderless voice that curls into a kind of weary howl. The effect reminds me of nothing so much as the ""ah-AH-ah"" vocals that snake through Aphex Twin's immortal ""Windowlicker"", and Hebden's processing gives ""Sing"" a similar sense of simultaneous grounding and weird dislocation. Hebden has studied Aphex Twin carefully, having made his first splash in 1999 when he remixed a track from SAW II for one of Warp's 10th Anniversary compilations. Elsewhere on Love, you can find the creative melding of beats and classical minimalism that producers like Richard James and Nobukazu Takemura were exploring in the 90s. An array of metallic percussion pops up, organized into hypnotic grid-like patterns that gradually build and change over the track's duration. The voice sample in ""Circling"" doesn't appear until two-thirds of the way through the track's runtime, and it brings with it a cluster of bright electronic tones that call to mind the iconic pulse of Reich/Riley minimalism. The loping, sleepy ""This Unfolds"" has several layers of quietly twinkling sound happening at once, and you can shift your perception to follow along with any one of them or simply let the whole thing wash over you. Though it mostly lays back and doesn't waste any notes, There Is Love in You always has just enough going on to pull you back in any time you feel like relegating it to the background. It works best taken whole, rather than broken into individual tracks. Whenever There Is Love in You comes to the closing ""She Just Likes to Fight"", a quietly pretty instrumental built around a straightforward guitar melody, I start thinking of Hebden's early days. There's a moment at the 2:18 mark where the music pauses for a moment as a tapped guitar harmonic rings out, and it brings me back for a split-second to ""Harmonics"", the acoustic guitar instrumental that is the one Fridge tune I love without reservation. It's such a basic and elemental thing, the overtones of one metal guitar string vibrating in place, but in the right hands it becomes a tool that can be used to deliver a surprising blast of feeling. The simple power of sound is something this guy has understood from the beginning.","Driven by dance-inspired beats and ghostly sampled voices, the new Four Tet album is the most focused in Kieran Hebden's catalog, and also among his best.

Silence,Monolake,by: Philip Sherburne,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a7f5ea9e61561daa56e6/1:1/w_160/0dcf8c17.jpg,2010-01-22 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13855-silence/,Imbalance Computer Music,"Every high-end audio equipment showroom ought to have a few Monolake CDs on hand. Just as vendors of big-screen HD televisions bank images that bristle with detail-- rustling fields of crimson poppies, sparkling seascapes-- sellers of hi-fi systems could use Monolake's sub-bass throb and pin-prick highs to show off their painstakingly engineered products. The Berlin musician's work has always been attuned to shiveringly precise sonics, but Silence represents a new pinnacle of sound as full-spectrum embrace. (Unsurprisingly, perhaps, Monolake's production notes emphasize that the album was recorded and mastered without compression, making this a welcome counter-offensive in the ""loudness wars."") That's not to say that this is merely music for hi-fi nerds. Blending elements of techno, dubstep, and ambient into an hour of suggestive, idiosyncratic drift, Silence presents programmed electronic music at its most sensually expressive. Monolake knows his way around sound design, of course. Also known as Robert Henke, he was one of the original developers of Ableton Live, the popular performance and production software, making him not only something of a legend, but also a rarity: very few figures have achieved a similar degree of success in both recording and instrument design. To give you an idea of his impact, imagine a latter-day Robert Moog or Tom Oberheim, but with a discography as deep as his list of patents. (Monolake is actually a shifting, collaborative project; it began as a duo of Henke and fellow Ableton co-founder Gerhard Behles, who later left the group; since the mid-2000s, Monolake has occasionally comprised Henke and Torsten Pröfrock, aka T++. Silence, however, is credited as a solo Henke production.) Ableton Live takes a fair amount of flak on producers' forums for delivering sound quality allegedly inferior to that of Logic Pro-- a claim that I've never seen substantiated. In any case, Silence, which was composed, edited, and mixed entirely in Live, offers ample evidence to the contrary. I can't think of a single piece of contemporary electronic music that sounds fuller, richer, or more nuanced. But this also isn't ""pure"" computer music; according to Henke's production notes, along with its synthesized sounds the album incorporates a wide range of real-world sonics-- metal percussion, dripping water, architectural acoustics, and all manner of field recordings-- that place it in a long tradition of musique concrète. This isn't an academic distinction; it's that openness to the world of sound that gives Silence such immersive depth. Crucial to the success of the album is the way that Henke blurs the line between the sampled and the synthetic. One of the album's central elements is a recurring sound like mallets bouncing on metal cable-- whether it's ""real"" or ""artificial"" I don't know, or care-- whose fluid, regular/irregular bounce lends a delicious gravity. They might be the record's most radical achievement, counterbalancing techno's rigidity with rippling, quicksilver grace. In essence, these patterns translate Henke's interest in granular sound to the realm of rhythm: over and over, textures become patterns and vice versa. Silence is a masterful exploration of the vagaries of scale, one that-- quite unlike your HD plasma screen-- rewards equally whether witnessed close up, far away, or deep inside.","Blending techno, dubstep, and ambient into an hour of idiosyncratic drift, this is programmed electronic music at its most sensually expressive.

"Francophonic, Vol. 2: 1980-1989",Franco & le Tout Puissant OK Jazz,by: Douglas Wolk,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a7ca13d19756521394d7/1:1/w_160/b0a43127.jpg,2010-01-22 06:00:03,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13820-francophonic-vol-2-1980-1989/,Sterns Africa,"Franco spent the final decade of his career mostly in exile, overseeing his franchise. A national treasure in Zaire (he was to the former Belgian Congo roughly twice what Springsteen is to Jersey), he lived in Paris for a good deal of the 1980s, as he fell in and out of favor with Zaire's dictator Mobutu Sese Seko. His group Tout Puissant (""The Almighty"") OK Jazz-- a dance band, not a jazz band-- had one cluster of members based in Brussels, another back home in Kinshasa. They marked their 25th anniversary with a series of four albums, and followed that up with a ""just like old times"" collaboration with their former singer Sam Mangwana, then a ""we're buddies despite our differences"" collaboration with Franco's longtime professional rival Tabu Ley Rochereau. That all sounds like a recipe for tepid cash-ins, right? But this 2xCD sequel to the first Sterns anthology of Franco's recordings (which covered 1953-1980) is thunderbolts and fireworks, start to finish. Maybe it's just canny song selection by compiler/annotator Ken Braun, who boiled down the dozens of albums Franco released in the 1980s to these 13 songs, but it sure sounds like the final quarter of TPOK's career was its best, which would make them close to unique in pop history. That may be because they operated on a different model from most bands. Franco was the guy who ran the show, and a superb musician (his chiming, flickering guitar parts defined soukous as much as Jimmy Nolen's defined funk), but he was only one of many guitarists in the group, one of many songwriters, and one of many singers (far from the smoothest). The band needed Franco-- they imploded after his 1989 death, at 51, of what nobody's quite willing to say for sure was AIDS-related causes-- but they were a lot more than just sidemen. ""Tokomo Ba Camarade Pamba"", the glorious opener here, flutters along Francolessly for its first couple of minutes, stacking up interlocking guitar figures and sinuous vocal harmonies; then the boss's gruff voice lurches into the mix a second before the horns kick in and the whole thing achieves liftoff. The excellence of '80s TPOK Jazz also had a lot to do with the band's shift, a few years earlier, from 45s to LPs. Soukous songs are meant to stretch out: the sebene that was a feature of a lot of Franco's best numbers is less a jam or a rave-up than a good bit that goes on for a while with limited variation. Of the 13 tracks on these two discs, only three are under 10 minutes long. ""Bina Na Ngai Na Respect"", written and sung by Ntesa Dalienst, is a brief, stately stroll followed by 15 minutes of spark-spitting dance-floor blowout. 1985's ""Mario"", arguably Franco's greatest hit, is an all-sebene hipshaker on which he and Madilu Bialu sing in the character of a widow with a moocher for a boyfriend-- its functional Anglophone equivalents are probably UTFO's ""Roxanne, Roxanne"" (who might they be talking trash about?) and the Velvet Underground's ""What Goes On"" (just keep playing that riff forever, please). Mostly, though, the late-period work collected here is a joy because Franco was perpetually pushing his band toward the future, almost always with excellent results. (The embarrassingly dated synth-drums on ""Pesa Position Na Yo"" are a rare exception.) These songs are formally riskier than most musicians with a catalog as successful as his would ever dare, and there's a wonderfully mischievous streak to them. The prettiness of TPOK Jazz's records was often threaded with rage and indignation, and the last couple of songs here understandably address mortality face-on, but even in his darkest moments Franco treated moving the crowd as a sweet responsibility.","The second volume of the Stearns label's anthology of the Congolese bandleader's recordings is thunderbolts and fireworks, start to finish.

Black Wooden EP,Mount Eerie,by: Matthew Solarski,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a7d913d19756521394fb/1:1/w_160/b647dda8.jpg,2010-01-22 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13829-black-wooden-ep/,Southern,"Southern Records' Latitudes series bills itself as a collection of ""session recordings capturing the transience and limitless expression of our modern world."" That claim's a little high-flown, but then it suits Phil Elverum, who as the Microphones and now Mount Eerie has made an art of turning the grandiose intimate, and introspective and fleeting moments into something universal and grand. The six-track Black Wooden EP marks Mount Eerie's contribution to the series, joining previous releases from fellow leftfield indie luminaries such as Ariel Pink, Sir Richard Bishop, Circle, Magik Markers, and Bohren und der Club of Gore. The premise: set the artist in question up at London's famed Southern Studios-- where Psychocandy was laid to tape, and where Sonic Youth, PJ Harvey, Crass, and Fugazi, among others, have recorded-- and invite them to craft ""something spontaneous, collaborative, fun, or experimental."" ""Spontaneity"" is the operative word with Black Wooden. Elverum made these recordings while on tour in summer 2007 (reportedly with a borrowed guitar, no less), and they effectively function as a snapshot of the State of Mount Eerie in the later years of the last decade. Tone-setting opener and title track ""Black Wooden"", on which Elverum spreads spare, ominous natural imagery over a steady strummed pulse, alludes directly to the man's abandoned exercise in inventing a new genre. (""Black wooden,"" a more ""organic"" variant of black metal-- though by Wind's Poem Elverum had seemingly given up trying to make the distinction.) ""Appetite"" would soon find a home on said experiment's resulting Black Wooden Ceiling Opening EP, albeit buffed up with some of the most ferocious riffage we'd yet heard from Elverum. On that recording the line ""constantly waking up to obliteration"" cues a monsoon of crashing guitars; here, however, Elverum pauses for a beat, inhales, and simply continues with the next line. That the song keeps its solemn momentum is, in a way, heavier than any six-string thundering. ""If We Knew"" and ""Oh My Heart"" (here known as ""Marriage"", with a partial lyrics sheet makeover) reappear on Lost Wisdom, Elverum's 2008 record with Julie Doiron and Fred Squire. It's interesting to hear Elverum sing the former tune, in particular. The Lost version has Doiron harmonizing with herself, while Elverum's Black Wooden take has him, as ever, sounding like the patron saint of solitude--appropriate for a song clearly born out of the stuff. Speaking of solitude, listening to the Black Wooden EP, as with Lost Wisdom, feels like taking in your own private Mount Eerie concert, complete with the pin-drop-audible reverent background hushed-ness that Elverum's gigs tend to inspire. And while most of the record is admittedly about as humorous as the Latitude series tagline, it's not entirely bone-dry: ""The Bottomless Pit"" has Elverum following the typical navel-gazery of ""Letting it all go, taking it all in/ Which way should I live out my short life?"" with ""meanwhile it all yawns indifferently,"" about as amusing a moment of jokey self-awareness we're liable to get from this guy. And hey, we'll take it. Verdict-wise, it goes something like this: If you're a big-time fan and you bought the super fancy photo book and the singles and the journal, you probably have Black Wooden already. If you've got the collector's itch and phrases like ""limited edition,"" ""never-to-be repeated,"" and ""artisan sleeve motif and insert"" get you giddy, you're definitely in the target demo. And heck, even if you're but an aspiring convert who's reluctant to make a huge commitment, as a welcome mat to the realm of Mount Eerie, you could do much worse.","Phil Elverum contributes to a series that asks musicians to create ""something spontaneous, collaborative, fun, or experimental.""

Zephyr EP,Basement Jaxx,by: Jess Harvell,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a7fc5e6ef959693210e6/1:1/w_160/09b4a47f.jpg,2010-01-22 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13857-zephyr-ep/,XL,"It's almost funny that an act like Basement Jaxx-- shameless populists, almost panderingly so at times-- can be so divisive. It's dance music overloaded with bubblegum divas and post-rave special effects created in an era when ""minimal"" has become a goddamned genre. (Lady Gaga can sell bubblegum diva and post-rave special effects as pop but she has personality-driven media appeal and brutally obvious songwriting.) But while they've continued to give subtlety the finger, the Jaxx have tightened up in recent years, doubling down on their hooks while clearing away the sonic clutter. For instance: 2009's streamlined Scars was originally meant to be a double album; Zephyr-- 33 minutes of synth washes, ethnographic pastiches, and soft-rock jams-- is the heretofore assumed scrapped second disc. Zephyr may seem slight, but, in theory if not practice, it affirms that Basement Jaxx refuse to limit themselves, and that's their main gift to 21st century dance music. Which is kinda perverse when you consider Zephyr could be sold as the Jaxx's ""downtempo"" album, a genre that all but prides itself on ruthlessly enforcing its well-known limits. On my first listen to Zephyr, I thought: This is the most antic ""ambient"" album of all time. On the second I was reminded of one of those Sublime Frequencies comps where a jackleg ethnographer recorded a few days' worth of indigenous radio, collaging the results together. Call it Radio South London 2009, maybe: The Jaxx have taken the borderless wash of sound around them-- on the airwaves and in the market stalls-- and given it a new coat of Jaxx-ian glitz. Whether it's moody balearic guitar (""Peace of Mind"") or ersatz Middle Eastern soundtrack music (""Alkazaar""), the Jaxx have infused sounds both currently hip and perennially winning with their usual wit and flash. But since when would Basement Jaxx be content with seamlessly recreating, well, anything? If the Jaxx are anything, they're inveterate mixers, DJs to the core. The best bits of Zephyr gently slip between genres in a manner that recalls a hyper-pop version of the KLF's somnambulent Chill Out, a travelogue that plays with time (the history of post-rave dance) rather than distance (the dreamed wide open spaces of the U.S.A.). Occasionally the Jaxx seem to be having a playful laugh at both downtempo's conventions, and their own. ""Check the Fuse"" makes a minute of hoary cocktail piano cheese come to Technicolor life through loony digital processing, while final track ""Ascension"" tries to squeeze in all of the Jaxx's late-90s obsessions (Latin jazz, ragga dancehall, the girliest bits of girly house). Zephyr is certainly chock full of Jaxx trademarks, but releasing it as a stand-alone maxi-EP, an experimental curio, means no one will mistake it for the sixth Basement Jaxx album. In a weird way I wish it was, though, because it'd earn the appropriate amount of attention due the last curveball the Jaxx had to throw at fans: a subtle, damn-near-chilled-out record after a decade-plus of OTT-as-aesthetic strategy. It'll be even funnier if it manages to divide fans as well as foes.","The house music legends go on an unexpected detour here, offering an EP of synth washes, ethnographic pastiches, and soft-rock jams.

Diplo Presents: Free Gucci (Best of The Cold War Mixtapes),Various Artists,by: Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a7ee9d034d5c69bf3907/1:1/w_160/97c2d83a.jpg,2010-01-22 06:00:00,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13845-diplo-presents-free-gucci-best-of-the-cold-war-mixtapes/,Mad Decent,"""Who need be afraid of the merge?"" When Walt ""Leaves of Grass"" Whitman wrote that, in the 1855 debut edition of the poem that would become ""Song of Myself"", his subject certainly wasn't Wesley Pentz. But the Philadelphia DJ/producer known as Diplo-- alongside such fellow global travelers as DJ /rupture-- has been among the 21st century's most dauntless joiners of disparate musical cultures. Whether Baltimore club (parties starting in 2003 at Philly's Ukrainian Club), baile funk (2004/2005 Favela mixtapes), Alabama hip-hop (2008's Paper Route Gangstaz mixtape), or Jamaican dancehall (last year's Major Lazer album), Diplo has a musically unimpeachable track record of taking the world's streets' worthiest sounds out of the neighborhoods and into your earbuds. With Free Gucci (Best of the Cold War Mixtapes), a freely downloadable mixtape of remixes for Atlanta gangsta rapper Gucci Mane, all that jet lag may have finally caught up with him. Never mind the usual point-missing accusations of cultural tourism-- ""Having white kids talk about race on the internet is the dumbest thing in the world,"" Diplo told Pitchfork's own Tom Breihan in a 2007 Village Voice interview. When it comes to the MC born Radric Davis, ""the merge"" already happened. After a prolific series of high-profile guest appearances (Mariah Carey, Black Eyed Peas, Big Boi) and mixtapes (his Cold War trilogy flooded the blogs one day last November) all but guaranteed Lil Wayne comparisons, Gucci Mane's Warner-sponsored The State vs. Radric Davis debuted in December at #10 on the Billboard albums chart. The New York Times hailed the rapper as ""one of the most vigorous and exciting in recent memory"". I mean, sure-- baile funk, Alabama rap, and Jamaican dancehall each existed for years before Diplo got them in his crates. But he introduced them to listeners who probably wouldn't have been exposed to them otherwise. Gucci Mane needs no introduction. Compared with Diplo's past projects, then, Free Gucci has little reason to exist. In fact, despite the title, most of the tracks here weren't on the Cold War mixtapes at all-- the bulk come from last year's superior The Burrprint: The Movie 3-D. Anyway, all that stuff would be just as academic as arguments about cultural appropriation if the music itself banged. And that's the problem. Yeah, Gucci's slurry, word-drunk absurdism is a huge part of his appeal. And Diplo's remixers have picked some of the rapper's signature tracks. But Atlanta producers such as Drumma Boy and Zaytoven, with their pin-prick synths and sweaty lurch, are also crucial to Gucci's sound, as even Warner must've recognized by sticking to them and other Southern producers on the new studio album. The indie-friendly mergers Diplo brokers in their place have their moments, but by and large they're no more accessible-- and definitely less complementary-- than their originals. The most significant connection Diplo makes here isn't between Gucci and casual hip-hop fans. It's between today's various underground styles of woozy, stoner-friendly electronic music. There's glo-fi/chillwave/whatever: Memory Tapes gives Burrprint's gloriously shameless jewelry boast ""Excuse Me"" some icy, extraterrestrial counterpoint (space abhors a bare neck). There's post-dubstep blippiness from Zomby, who adds a different kind of trunk-shuddering low-end to Guccimerica threat ""Boi"". There's also Warp-signed hip-hop instrumentalist Flying Lotus, fogging up 2008's ""Photo Shoot"" with siren wobble and extra mush-mouth. Unfortunately, gloomy lo-fi duo Salem have done much better Gucci remixes than this rotely ominous rework of another Burrprint highlight, ""My Shadow"". Overall, though, Free Diplo shows that some of the most notable home electronic producers right now have more in common than their fan factions might like to admit. The link between Gucci's intoxicated flow and Diplo's chosen remixers should be obvious, but bringing them together isn't always so seamless. French producer Douster puts post-""A Milli"" bass mumbles beneath Burrprint's (relatively) introspective ""Frowney Face"". OK-- but why did Philly's Emynd think his uptempo version of the same track needed irritating percolator bubbles? DJ Teenwolf, of Brooklyn's Ninjasonik, bur(r)ies Great BRRitain's ""I'm Expecting"" (""What you expect? I expect another check, man"") in constantly hammering kick drums and skidding sound effects. The same mixtape's ""I Be Everywhere"" gets an Asian motif and pitch-shifting from English producer Mumdance on one fairly solid remix, then burbling dubstep clichés from San Francisco's DZ on another. Austin's Bird Peterson replaces the mock-gothic sweep of one more Burrprint cut, ""Dope Boys"", with expansively conceived bass-synth grandeur that should please fans of Memory Tapes; still, it's an odd fit for such a playful song (""I'm paraplegic/ Where's my paralegal?""). Anyone reading this review can get a better sense of Gucci's weird charms by going straight to the source. Which you can download almost as easily. As for Diplo himself, the Mad Decent boss can take credit for a few of the mixtape's better tracks-- especially a stomping, synth-slithering ""Excuse Me"" (""He do all that lame stuff/ I just keep it gangsta"") that wouldn't be too far out of place on one of Gucci's own albums. Snares bustle and synths bend on Diplo's ""Break Yourself"", a much fuller production than the Burr Russia original. His Mariah Carey-sampling remix of Guccimerica's outlaw manifesto ""Dangers Not a Stranger"", with its satin-y keys, might be too precious for some, but it-- like DJ Benzi and Willy Joy's Daniel Bedingfield-sampling trance-rap take on 2008's ""I'm the Shit""-- uncovers enjoyably unexpected similarities between otherwise vastly different tracks. So Free Gucci isn't great. But even a mixtape without any duds would arrive at a time when Diplo's target audience no longer needs someone like Diplo to help them meet rap halfway. Washed Out, whose gauzy synth-pop isn't included here but shares the same spirit, came to his current sound after working on instrumental hip-hop tracks. Salem have been informed by chopped'n'screwed music since the beginning, and their remix of Jeezy diss ""Round One"" beats anything here, easy. Newest Warp signee Babe Rainbow, aka Vancouver-based producer Cameron Reed, calls his style ""surf-step"": lo-fi beach-punk goes dubstep? Reed is also a huge hip-hop fan. Diplo need not be afraid of the merge, but Free Gucci is too little, too late.","Quintessential Atlanta MC Gucci Mane is given an indie reinvention via Diplo and a host of top producers-- Zomby, FlyLo, Memory Tapes.

Dimensional Bleedthrough,Krallice,by: Grayson Currin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a7eaea9e61561daa56cf/1:1/w_160/5d5ed553.jpg,2010-01-21 06:00:04,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13840-dimensional-bleedthrough/,Profound Lore,"Dimensional Bleedthrough, the second album from New York metal supergroup Krallice, is the sort of record that should find favor in at least a half-dozen listening circles. Its relentless squall-- rapidfire drums, riff-and-raze guitars, and back-and-forth electric bass, plus the serrated screams of co-founder Mick Barr-- could appeal to devotees of classic black metal bands Burzum, Immortal, and Emperor. The distended shapes Krallice's pummel takes might work for fans of U.S. black metal marathon men Wolves in the Throne Room. Or for those who get lost in the massed guitar works of Rhys Chatham and Glenn Branca or in the overtone hysteria of composers like La Monte Young, ""Untitled"" flits around one note. Darkly radiant and completely mesmerizing, those eight minutes of drumless glow feel like a musical cocoon, an alternate version of Barr's work on Orthrelm's OV. And for noiseniks, there are harsh, finessed impasses, too, like the prelude to ""Aridity"", where feedback and split octaves howl and groan. What's more, Barr and Colin Martson (Dysrhythmia, Behold... the Arctopus), comprise a fairly infallible guitar duo. Their playing here is as complex as it is controlled and deliberate. Sidewinding riffs and rapidfire progressions scream above the dense rhythm section. Dimensional Bleedthrough's seven pieces twist and halt, lurch and sprint, shifting rhythms and directions without warning. It seems like a shoo-in as a new favorite for prog and math-rock zealots. And, for those living for death metal, there's ""The Mountain"". At three minutes and 14 seconds, it's the album's shortest track by nearly a third and its most direct by a mile. Bassist Nick McMaster takes the vocals this time, spitting the words above a brutal churn, his deep, irascible bellow recalling Suffocation and Cryptopsy. Whereas Krallice thrive at a rarified intersection of death and black metal, noise abandon and prog precision, pedestrian grit and academic commitment, it seems a lot of listeners might be afraid-- or too territorial-- to follow. At times, it seems too mathematical for metal kids, too tough for the avant-garde set, and too oriented for the noise dudes. It eschews those pretty passages that have long been Wolves in the Throne Room's popular bait, and it's certainly not setting out to terrify, either. Forget all of that, though, and keep listening-- closely. Dimensional Bleedthrough isn't and doesn't aim to be a headphones masterpiece. Its 77 minutes are almost uniformly brutal, and digesting it at such close proximity is bound to fatigue. But it is arranged and engineered to offer more than the benchmarks of second-wave black metal, or even the shock-and-tone tactics of a lot of noise and industrial acts. Notice the way the guitars pull against each other within the first two minutes of the splendid title track, tugging each other through the riff's hairpin turns, or how one guitar veers into a skuzzy, distorted counter to introduce Barr's vocals nearly four minutes in. Or listen for the way the progression of ""Autochton"" slides with Barr's growled glissando, especially in the first minute. It's those details-- and, of course, Krallice's gargantuan sound-- that make Dimensional Bleedthrough bigger and better than most other metal hybrids around.","Metal supergroup, led by Mick Barr, creates something for fans of black metal, noise, and drone to all love.

What Day Is it Tonight?,Trans Am,by: Jason Crock,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a7a85e6ef95969321027/1:1/w_160/1da110fb.jpg,2010-01-21 06:00:03,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13788-what-day-is-it-tonight/,Thrill Jockey,"Though their records have been received with varying degrees of ironic appreciation, the music of Trans Am has aged better than expected. What may have sounded arch or in-jokey before (and may have even been intended that way) now sounds more like the band has been planting flags and protecting the sometimes contradictory strains of rock they grew up with. That seemingly at-odds musical mix-- between 1970s rock cliché and 80s synth-rock cliché, icy electronics and analog sweat, musical discipline and wild indulgence-- sounds now almost like a masterplan. One reason these instrumentals still hold up is that there was always rock-solid musicianship behind them. Therefore, a live record suits them pretty well. On both the record and included DVD, it's immediately apparent Trans Am have the chops to pull off and maintain the pastiche. But unlike some of the artists they've lovingly sent up and/or paid homage to in their own music, that ability is pointed toward building tension and establishing surprise. It's evident all over What Day Is it Tonight?: From the extended drum fill at the start of ""Futureworld"" to its steadfast Krautrock-derived core to its fake-out closing minutes, many of the band's contrasts and idiosyncrasies can be located in that one track. Earlier songs like ""Firepoker"" build tension through manic stops and starts only to dissolve into one great John Carpenter-worthy synth drone. The tracklist culls from the band's entire career, and though it cherrypicks tracks from several different live performances, it flows smoothly. Many songs from their later albums shine in this setting: A stripped-down ""Positive People"" gets reclaimed as a worthy deep cut from the tongue-maybe-too-firmly-in-cheek TA, while Futureworld material like '""Television Eyes"" sounds that much more visceral. Trans Am are just as good at what they do now as they've ever been-- in fact, they've grown more subtle and sophisticated by now (if you can reach such a bar with homages to camp and cliché). But in hearing old against new on What Day Is it Tonight?, some of their most recent work sounds clinical by comparison. '""First Words"" (from 2007's Sex Change) finds a sturdy groove and has even better texture and open space, but it can't help but feel like a come down after the faster material. While it's somewhat difficult to reconcile their whole career in one live disc, the material remains unpredictable even as it gets a little more cerebral. For those who had even a passing interest in Trans Am's music over the years, this set is a fine reminder of why you likely tuned into them in the first place.","Trans Am explore a career's worth of 1970s rock cliché and 80s synth-rock cliché on this strong live album and DVD.

Up From Below,Edward Sharpe & the Magnetic Zeros,by: Paul Thompson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a7fa5e6ef959693210e1/1:1/w_160/0981ec0e.jpg,2010-01-21 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13852-up-from-below/,Rough TradeVagrant,"Remember Fruitopia? How good that sounded for a couple minutes? They'd roll out these big, beautiful kaleidoscopic ads before movies sometimes, swarming strawberries in stereo, and you'd look down at your Cherry Coke and feel somehow as though you'd failed. Of course, in the lobby's light, you came to find out that Fruitopia was not in fact made by hippies using ecologically sound methods for growing giant fruit, but rather extracted and besaccharined by the very Coca-Cola corporation that had seemed like the source of so much pancreas-punching horror not moments before. Fruitopia was, in a way, more evil than your simple soda; evil, because it tricked you into believing it was good when it wasn't. Remember Ima Robot? Ima Robot were one of those bandwagon-hopping jerk-punk bands that emerged around 2003 to capitalize on the burgeoning jerk-punk moment; there were many, alas. As nicely zeitgeisty as their leadoff single ""Dynomite"" was, there was always something weirdly disingenuous about Ima Robot-- that they were basically Beck's then-current backing band led by some shouty haircut probably had something to do with it-- but they came and went so fast it was hard to find the time to care. They weren't evil, but they weren't missed. Just as you'd feel a little funny if some hippie ideals were being espoused to sell you fancy Kool-Aid, you'd feel a little funny if a jerk-punker-- and I hesitate to say failed, but, yeah, failed jerk-punker-- reemerged a couple of years on as some kind of robe-donning, beard-rocking guru sort, wouldn't you? Well, get ready: Ima Robot lead singer Alex Ebert has reeimagined himself in the image of messiah-type Edward Sharpe. Gone is the lanky, nervy guy sticking an exclamation mark at the end of every thought; this Sharpe character's a real laid-back, lovey-dovey dude, one with his head very much in the clouds. But even he seems onto this dichotomy between the free-spirited music on Up From Below, his and the Magnetic Zeros' first one together, and the slightly disingenuous feel of it all. ""It's the magical mystery kind,"" he opines on opener ""40 Day Dream"", before adding another qualifier: ""must be a lie."" Indeed! Sharpe and his Zeros dip their many toes into the, um, ""sounds of the 1960s""; there's some Cowsills-like froth, Friends of Distinction multipart ooby-doobies, some Donovan-style slowpoke revelry, and even a little dour Village Green-era Kinks drollery. But the admirably far-reaching results nevertheless come up short. There's handclaps and horns, sprightly choruses and thousand-part harmonies to go around, but all the fluff either seems appliqued onto the song as an afterthought or the only real thought the song's got. A carefully curated list of influences abound, but no matter who they're reminding you of, Sharpe and company are careful not to outdo anything that's preceded them in energy or inspiration or both. It's oddly uptight, heavily studied music, too-- never once approaching anything like ""looseness."" Lyrically, it's a lot of love-your-fellow-man stuff that doesn't exactly pass for insight sitting next to some kinda gnarly Jamie Stewart childhood trauma. It's as if Sharpe's got his arms open so wide, he's never going to reach anybody. And all the weird juxtapositions and half-formed ideas in tandem on Up From Below lend it a repurposed feel, like Sharpe-- pardon me, Ebert-- had the songs and figured, with 11 musicians on hand he'd find something for them to do. But then there's ""Home"", a jaunty duet between Sharpe and ladyfriend/bandmate Jade Castrinos. It's the one moment that justifies Up From Below's existence. Sure, it calls to mind another fairly different classic sound of the 60s-- Johnny and June Carter Cash's conversational duets-- but, thanks in no small part to Castrinos' whiskey-splashed pipes, it feels glaringly original amidst the daisy chain surrounding it, an obvious affection passing between Sharpe and Castrinos as they murmur sweet nothings. Weird to say about a hippie, but it's humanity that's missing in Sharpe's mild but mannered and certainly unmemorable music, which feels focus-grouped, stone-washed, and artificial.","Dude from Ima Robot reemerges as a folk-pop singer, winning over satellite radio and late-night TV producers for some reason.

End Times,Eels,by: Zach Kelly,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a7e39d034d5c69bf38ea/1:1/w_160/63b29dd5.jpg,2010-01-21 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13835-end-times/,V2,"If sad bastard music is looking to nominate a new key-holder, consider End Times as Mark Oliver Everett's formal bid. Over the course of eight studio albums as Eels, Everett has made a career of feeling sorry for himself in some capacity-- typically, these misanthropic leanings have been juxtaposed against childlike flits of whimsy or coffee-black observations of varying degrees of wit. He was, for the most part, never humorless; he was gratingly self-referential and bogged-down by the Leonard Cohen-as-Eeyore thing he does. End Times does the sadness without the humor. Everett has described the album as a reaction to ""the state of the desperate times we live in,"" and it chronicles a very personal break-up through a prism of a collective hard times. It is by all accounts a break-up album, but one that's plodding, boring, and full of icky self-pity. ""Now I'm a statistic, but I'm not fatalistic,"" Everett's sings on ""In My Younger Days"", ""I'm not yet resigned to fate."" Like on much of End Times, the guy couldn't be further off-base. It starts with ""The Beginning"", a disparate picture of a down-on-their-luck couple that still views the world as ""beautiful and free."" A foreboding chronicle of the unpleasantness to follow, the typical arc of a break-up tale never materializes as ""The Beginning"" promises. Instead, the remainder of the record refuses to delve into any emotion more complex than pity or self-doubt (save for ""Unhinged"", the only moment where Everett takes a break from blaming himself and musters the courage to call his lover ""crazy""), until we arrive at ""On My Feet"", which really requires no further explanation. This isn't to say you don't kind of feel for the guy-- after all, you'd have to endure some seriously damaging emotional stuff to want to drag your fans through 40 minutes of it as well--especially without any real emotional payout. Somehow, this makes the outlying ""end of times"" correlation even more disingenuous. At its least intrusive, it just feels tacked-on: ""Gone Man"", a rare mid-tempo bid here, effuses like it's drinking to forget, but ultimately finds Everett mulling over every misstep. When there does seem to be something to say about the breakdown (not just the break-up), it comes off even cheaper. ""Paradise Blues"" finds Everett back in tongue-in-cheek mode, but it blows up in his face so spectacularly, it's pure contrivance. Eventually, Everett's disassociation with himself results in a disassociation with the music, as each painfully plain entry becomes simply exhaustively dull. By the end, he's left singing to the ""only friend [he] has in the world,"" the little bird on the back porch-- just in case you were wondering how sucky this thing could truly get.","Mark Oliver Everett returns with another record of sadsack self-pity, without even the tinges of humor that typically color his work.

Astro Coast,Surfer Blood,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a7ed13d1975652139534/1:1/w_160/8fddb262.jpg,2010-01-21 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13844-astro-coast/,Kanine,"There's plenty to like about Astro Coast, the debut LP from the youthful Floridians in Surfer Blood, but first and foremost it's a great guitar album. So what exactly does that mean these days? Often, it's a reference to either a display of astounding technical chops or innovative use of tone and texture, qualities which, to be quite honest, aren't particularly present here. This is a great guitar album in the way Weezer's Blue Album, Built to Spill's Keep It Like a Secret, or, more recently, Japandroids' Post-Nothing are: six-strings serve as a multiplier for hooks, making it every bit as easy and fun to air guitar with as it is to sing along to. Nowhere is this more true than on their breakout single ""Swim"", which spent the second half of last year generating so much praise that it threatened to make any future album unnecessary or future hype redundant. But even after so many listens, its snowblind-ish reverb is still disorienting-- especially contrasted with its crisp, power-chord hook. It may sound like they're hitting you with their best shot, but after an impassioned ""oh oh oh!"" from singer John Paul Pitts, Surfer Blood explodes into an even bigger chorus and ""Swim"" becomes almost overpoweringly fist-pumping. While ""Swim"" might just remind you of any number of Buzz Bin one-offs now stocking whatever's left of the used-CD store racket, Astro Coast has a strong supporting cast. Throughout, even the titles remark upon how each could've evolved from a killer guitar part into a full-on song-- ""Floating Vibes"", ""Harmonix"", ""Neighbour Riffs"". ""Floating Vibes"" lumbers with a chest-puffing, two-chord stomp that could evoke either Angus Young or Stephen Malkmus, before the guitars dovetail-- one chiming and light, the other a vocal-leading riff that makes Pitts' handling of the melodic contours sound effortless. The melodic intuitiveness of Astro Coast is in large part due to the interplay heard on ""Floating Vibes""-- if every riff is stand-alone hummable, then the vocals take care of themselves. Surfer Blood know from a good hook, but perhaps what's more promising is how most of their compositions build to their rewards. ""Take It Easy"" does the opposite at its outset, but by its midpoint the fidgety rhythms cool to a mesmerizing motorik that's continued on ""Harmonix"". ""Slow Jabroni"" is lonesome and crowded, distorted acoustics serving as a dusty backdrop for Pitts' Isaac Brock-ian carny barking. The riff that introduces ""Anchorage"" is as blunt as its sentiments (""I don't want to spin my wheels/ I don't got no wheels to spin""), but its second half unfurls a major-key riff that evokes the roomier compositions of Dinosaur Jr. Putting the record's two longest songs back-to-back might not be the canniest bit of sequencing, but it shows the confidence Surfer Blood have in their ability to escape the confines of three-minute power-pop. Though they hail from West Palm Beach and come at the tail-end of 2009's indie feel-good beach party, for all of the oceanic imagery that the band name, album title, and cover art convey, Astro Coast is lyrically landlocked and lonely. Pitts is straightforward when he's not being shrouded by the springy reverb favored by the Shins' James Mercer, and at points, he reads pointedly early-00s emo. Topics of concern include confusion about romance, confusion about friendship, confusion about the future, confusion about religion. It's hard not to think that most of Astro Coast was borne of a relationship dissolved by distance, especially if we're to take the otherwise chipper ""Twin Peaks"" at face value: Pitts travels to Syracuse, watches David Lynch films, and wrenches out lyrics of sexual frustration that suggest most of the drive was spent listening to Pinkerton. Perhaps unsurprisingly, Surfer Blood spent the latter part of 2009 touring with Japandroids, who, along with BOAT and Cymbals Eat Guitars align in a faux-genre some of us have jokingly referred to as ""alt-bro""-- guitar-heavy indie rock that's probably influenced by Pavement, likely about girls, and almost certainly made by people who at first blush sound more fun to get a beer with than, say, Dirty Projectors. But it's unfair to think of Astro Coast as reactionary in some way to the more overtly ambitious indie stars of last year-- there are no chamber sections, no pocket harmonies, no integration of West African rhythms (ok, there's some of that). But ambition can just as easily manifest itself as a desire to create a relentlessly catchy, ""classic indie"" album in your own dorm room, and if that's what Surfer Blood set out to do, Astro Coast succeeds wildly.","The debut LP from this young Florida band is first and foremost a great guitar album packed with sing-along hooks, but there's more going on beneath the surface.

You Are the One I Pick,Felix,by: Matthew Murphy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6eaea9e61561daa5489/1:1/w_160/522855d2.jpg,2010-01-20 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13637-you-are-the-one-i-pick/,Kranky,"You Are the One I Pick is the debut album by UK chamber-pop duo Felix, and it carries a deceptively direct title for such an understated and elliptical collection of songs. Vocalist Lucinda Chua rarely raises her voice to a volume beyond that of a private conversation, yet her frequently arresting performances here have an air of unusual gravity. This urgency owes largely to the steady undercurrent of quiet turmoil coursing beneath Felix's graceful arrangements, resulting in a number of lovely songs that veritably crackle with confused desires, anxieties, and needling self-doubt. For this recording Felix are comprised of Chua, who has toured with Stars of the Lid and here contributes piano, cello, and vocals, and fellow multi-instrumentalist Chris Summerlin. Most of the essential instrumental tracks are built as a skillful dialogue between Chua's piano and Summerlin's guitar, but the two also maximize their flexibility in the studio, fleshing out these songs with multi-tracked vocals, subtle percussion, and string arrangements. These instrumental flourishes do more than merely add atmosphere, as throughout these pieces the arrangements closely parallel and amplify the interior dramas depicted in Chua's lyrics. Informed in part by Chua's classical training, the album strikes an airy balance nearby the quieter moments of PJ Harvey's White Chalk and the spare chamber work of Rachel's' Music for Egon Schiele. Felix have cited the work of Erik Satie as an influence, and this is nowhere more evident than on ""I Wish I Was a Pony"", a piece whose central piano figure seems a direct descendant of Satie's Gymnopédies. This track, particularly when coupled with the following ""Where Is My Dragon?"" also serves as a fine example of Chua's quietly inscrutable lyrical style, as the simple images of ponies and dragons give way to such conclusions as, ""There's a secret you keep and it makes me dance,"" or, ""Everything you lost and everything you found is not worth it."" Whether or not these lines work on the page, in her performances Chua is able to make them sound like messages of great personal importance, communicating with an effortless touch the image of someone who will feel much better once she has gotten her words out and her mental furniture all set back in place. The album's vague sense of unease comes further into the forefront on ""What I Learned From TV"", where Chua's wry, media-borne list of anxieties are underscored by somber piano chords and scraping, slightly enervating strings. This thread continues on ""Back in Style"" which juxtaposes its David Lynch references with Chua's self-deprecating but still-caustic appraisal of a relationship (""What if I was kinder? What if I was nicer? What if I was not sick to death of you?"") Virtually every track on You Are the One I Pick showcases Felix's remarkable instinct for knowing when to ramp up their instrumentation and when to hold back. Yet when an album is this carefully arranged, there are also moments when all the fingerprints on a given track become distracting, as when the fanciful ""Ode to the Marlboro Man"" layers Chua's vocals in such a way that it sounds like a number of competing voices volleying around within a single rattled skull. So it is ultimately not too surprising that on many of the album's best tracks (""Waltzing for Weasels"", ""Bernard St."") the duo keep things refreshingly simple, with single strands of piano, guitar, and cello in quiet symmetry, leaving the listener ample room to savor Felix's knotty, enigmatic songcraft.","Kranky issues the debut album by this UK chamber-pop duo, who counts Erik Satie, PJ Harvey, and Rachel's among their influences.

Trust,Kaito,by: Joe Colly,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a7e8ea9e61561daa56cc/1:1/w_160/b2a63cdc.jpg,2010-01-20 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13842-trust/,Kompakt,"Of the many insults hurled at Jay Leno during his current beef with Conan O'Brien and NBC, the one that most stuck out to me was Nathan Rabin's claim in the Wall Street Journal that Leno ""suffers from a terrible dearth of personal demons. [He] is so normal and functional that he's practically a freak."" Comedians are self-loathers by nature, and Leno is too well adjusted to be funny, the argument follows. While Japanese producer Hiroshi Watanabe shares no notable similarities with Leno, I've always felt kind of the same way about the music Watanabe makes as Kaito-- his take on deep house, which incorporates elements of trance and minimal, is generally so pleasant and optimistic that it almost seems benign. The more frequent, concrete criticism of Kaito-- who, with clear ties to the oft-maligned 90s trance scene, is something of an anomaly on Kompakt-- it's that he seems to be making the same record over and over. Kaito's breakout was 2002's Special Life, an album that won folks over for its re-imagining of trance as a worthy component of chic modern techno and offered for many a lively alternative to Kompakt's usual stately bounce. Since then, though, Kaito has seemed content resting on his laurels, doing little to tweak or improve upon his signature sound-- a blend of swooshing synths and tightly packed keyboard trills presented in a happy-go-lucky style. Boasting song titles like ""Rainbow Circles"" and ""The Breath of Spring"", his latest LP, Trust, mostly follows suit, and will disappoint those who'd hoped Kaito would explore different narrative or sonic threads this time around. But wishing an artist will do what you think he should is a fool's errand, and Kaito's confident enough in his chosen approach to make up for a lack of inventiveness with tracks that carry a good amount of punch. On ""Spring"" and ""Nothing Could Be More Peaceful"", he employs breakbeats (something he's done before with success), setting them behind grand keyboard arrangements in such a way that lends depth and a herky-jerky momentum. Roughly 75 minutes long, the record takes a turn for the better around the halfway point when Kaito introduces some much-needed mystery via icy synth lines on the title track. The songs that follow flit between John Hughes-ian M83 instrumentals (""We Are Living Here"") and more classically Kompakt minimal pieces (""It Happens Suddenly"") but ultimately just seem too polite for their own good.","Kompakt producer continues to re-imagine trance as a worthy component of chic modern techno.

Make It Sound in Tune,Portastatic,by: Joshua Klein,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a7ef5e6ef959693210c2/1:1/w_160/44eca07a.jpg,2010-01-20 06:00:02,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13846-make-it-sound-in-tune/,Merge,"Cruising through the compulsively readable Our Noise: The Story of Merge Records, last year's excellent oral history of Merge Records, one comes away with the impression that the label wouldn't have lasted nearly this long if it didn't have so much continued faith in its acts. Sure, co-founder Mac McCaughan may have his favorites, but it always seemed like he rooted just as hard for acts such as Butterglory and East River Pipe as he did for such heavy hitters as Arcade Fire and Spoon. McCaughan cites both the Merge covers collection Score! and the occasional acoustic bookstore appearance supporting Our Noise as the inspiration for the recent Portastatic release Make It Sound in Tune, a seven-song EP of Merge act tracks given the Portastatic treatment, but that's just a roundabout way of citing all the hundreds of Merge acts he's supported over the years. ""Obviously, the Merge catalog is full of hundreds-- thousands, actually-- of songs I love, so I picked ones I either knew well or thought I could re-create without defiling too harshly,"" posted McCaughan, modestly. ""It wasn't easy to narrow down, so I just tried not to think about it too much."" True to his loyal instincts, the seven songs McCaughan picked to cover run the Merge gamut, from the obvious (Spoon and Magnetic Fields) to the unsung (Matt Suggs and Spent) to the cultish (Lambchop and Destroyer) to one song from Christchurch's Renderers, its source a one-off 7"" from 1993. Also true to his word, none of these covers defile the original. Rather, they do the acts and the Merge catalog proud, underscoring the countless numbers of gems and minor classics the label has curated alongside its conspicuous heavy hitters. It is interesting how easily McCaughan adopts, adapts, and otherwise sublimates such distinct songwriter personalities as Britt Daniel, Stephin Merritt, Kurt Wagner, and Dan Bejar. Admittedly, ""Anything You Want"" is one of Spoon's more straightforward songs, but McCaughan's version replaces the bright production with rougher lo-fi edges without ruining its tunefulness. The version of ""Old Orchard Beach"", from the Susan Anway-era of the Magnetic Fields (which also produced ""100,000 Fireflies"", a song that Superchunk liked to cover), is supported by Merritt's old-school allegiance to popular song structure, which McCaughan exploits with bits of strings, sax, processed vocals, and echoing drums. The more eccentric Wagner and Bejar port over just as well, the former's ""The Saturday Option"" (from What Another Man Spills) surviving the transition from Wagner's rumble to Mac's yelp, and the innate melodrama of the latter's ""Foam Hands"" subverted by the addition of a charming children's choir. Which brings us back to McCaughan's enduring feelings for the less obvious corners of the Merge catalog. Matt Suggs never broke through as some predicted, but the version of his ""Where's Your Patience, Dear?"" from 2000's Golden Days Before They End is pleasant enough to warrant a return to the original for another shot. Spent's ""West"" is no less lovely, further indication that the New Jersey group got unfairly lost in the shuffle during the mid-90s indie boom. As for the Renderers' ""A Million Lights"", chalk Portastatic's pretty rendition up as another representation of Merge's longtime and somewhat unappreciated support of oft distribution-challenged New Zealand acts. As McCaughan himself concedes, he could have chosen any number of alternates for the EP, or, for that matter, just kept recording in perpetuity. Twenty years down the line, it's clear the guy doesn't play favorites. This is all music close to his heart, so it's no surprise that this mini trip down memory lane should prove so heartfelt. And if you didn't like the guy's ethic to begin with, all proceeds go to charity. Talk about sharing the love.","Merge leader Mac McCaughan gives his label's acts-- including Spoon, the Magnetic Fields, and Lambchop-- the covers treatment on this charity EP.

Intimate Moments for a Sensual Evening,Aziz Ansari,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a7df13d197565213950d/1:1/w_160/e2d39f4c.jpg,2010-01-20 06:00:01,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13832-intimate-moments-for-a-sensual-evening/,Comedy Central,"Funny People was a divisive movie, but here's an indisputable fact: It was 146 minutes long. Some consider its forbidding runtime a byproduct of Judd Apatow's success and/or ego, others proof that his deep and genuine love for stand-up comedy inspired him to go all out to create its definitive film experience. I'm inclined to think the latter, since if you share Apatow's obsession with the artform, there were just tons of inside jokes, Easter eggs, and knowing winks that made those two and a half hours pass a little more quickly. Perhaps the most notable was that of RAAAAAAAANDY, the scene-stealing, blowjob-obsessed shock comic played by Aziz Ansari. Many wondered who exactly he was supposed to ""be""-- Ansari says it's an amalgamation, and judging from the nine-minute, in-character bonus track on his debut record, Intimate Moments For a Sensual Evening, it's a comedy Cerberus of Dice Clay/Funk Flex/DJ Khaled. But the funniest joke was how the casting threw people off the scent: here's the embodiment of crude, backwards-hat humor being played by a slight, fully-bearded Indian guy from South Carolina, best known for offbeat comedies like ""Parks and Recreation"" and ""Human Giant"". Then again, this undersells the kind of crossover appeal Ansari brings to his record. Though ""Human Giant"" was the kind of sketch show that would book the National as musical guests, as Ansari relates here on ""MTV's Next"", they also tried to find ways to shoehorn jokes about getting raped by dinosaurs. Much is made of Ansari's ties to indie rock, but in the span of one bit, you'll hear ""TV on the Radio"" and ""titties."" (Obviously, it's one of the two about Kanye West.) It's a tough gig to bridge the alternative scene at Upright Citizens Brigade and the business card swap meets at the Improv, but if there was a stand-up equivalent to the indie crossover of Phoenix's crowd-pleasing Wolfgang Amadeus Phoenix, this might be it. In a similar way, it's pop smarts that define Ansari's performance: He's relatable without pandering and clever without making a flex of intellect or being overly arch. Ansari isn't about upsetting convention but in light of his peers, his livewire reading is refreshing if not altogether innovative. The generally shitty nature of the post-election brought out the darkest albums in everyone from Patton Oswalt to Dane Cook. Ansari, however, is more interested in his chubby cousin Harris-- an obsessive viewer of TNT one-hour dramas and eater of Cinnabon. Harris is played as Aziz's foil, but they share the same teenage-like enthusiasm-- a selling point for Ansari's observational humor. In the album's first bit, Ansari has already brought up gay marriage, Jamba Juice, and the fallibility of the SmartType feature: in terms of contemporary comedy, those may as well be C, G, and D chords. He realizes they're clichés, but the humor comes in the hold and release-- I'll go easy on the spoilers here, but it's clear that Ansari knows what the crowd expects. He realizes we all notice. The idea that Southern Living conducted an investigation into thread counts could've stopped there, but the joke is in the absurdity of his reaction about finding out he'd been shorted 304 threads: ""If that was a drug deal, I would've shot Hotel Luxury Linens in the face! You didn't think I was gonna count that shit, motherfucker?"" Ansari nods to his Southern upbringing when describing the ""Simple Man Cruise"", a chance for Skynyrd fans to go on a luxury liner and rock out to ""Saturday Night Special"". In the hands of a more cynical comic, it's another elitist smackdown of flyover country, but Ansari turns it into a charming riff on Dixie colloquialisms. Ansari admits that he's able to track people with celebrity crushes on him because ""I do nothing but take naps all day!"" As such, a good portion of Intimate takes place in Ansari's downtime on the Internet-- he hilariously torments Harris on a Facebook study group page, envisions the obituaries after dying in a car wreck while checking his Blackberry, and plays diplomat in a blog war between Kanye West and his naïve cousin Darwish. But he often saves his best storytelling to relate what it's like to hang out with famous musicians. Granted, most of it is, ""I'm not even supposed to be here,"" and straight-up journalism from an R. Kelly concert could often pass for comedy-- you could make the argument that Kelly's special brand of genius did all the heavy lifting. But Ansari nails what makes the spectacle so spectacular: Kelly leaving a club because he's convinced he'll never get a better lapdance, and of course, completely unexplained non sequiturs that dot his concerts. Perhaps the musician Ansari is most closely associated with is Kanye West, and his ""Night Out With Kanye West"" bit once again does so much to capture the tics: Before doing a private show at Kanye's house, Ansari finds the singer alone, sitting on his couch listening to his own album. But earlier in the night, Kanye explains a long absence in the bathroom: ""I was on an important phone call. I wasn't taking a shit."" Between those two examples, he nails what often makes West such an engrossing figure-- a guy with an enormous ego and an incessant need for approval. It's 2010, and a famous comedian was able to do routines on R. Kelly and Kanye without using ""pee on you"" or ""I'mma let you finish"" jokes. Go see some more stand-up if that doesn't register as cause for celebration.","Indie comic follows his ""Parks and Rec"" stardom with a collection of his best stand-up bits, including nine minutes of RAAAAAAAANDY.

Real Life Is No Cool,Lindstrøm & Christabelle,by: Mark Pytlik,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a7f15e6ef959693210c8/1:1/w_160/f571211c.jpg,2010-01-20 06:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13848-real-life-is-no-cool/,Smalltown Supersound,"As supportive as Hans-Peter Lindstrøm's fans have been of his random acts of creative fitfulness, one wouldn't blame them for feeling a bit tested by his most recent string of output. Between his brilliant but impractical 2008 long-player Where You Go I Go Too and his 42-minute refit of ""Little Drummer Boy"", two of the Norwegian producer's recent major releases have accounted for nearly 100 minutes of music across a scant four tracks. In a scene where an elongated 12-minute remix is par for the course, that's still hard going. Real Life Is No Cool isn't just the achingly stylish and neatly accessible dance record to end all that, it also constitutes a fresh new take on the strand of retro-futurism that Lindstrøm helped create. The main difference is that whereas a lot of his output has been rooted in a genre-- disco, Balearic, new age-- Real Life Is No Cool often feels more like an attack on the very idea. It's almost as if Lindstrøm's response to years of genre exercise has been to atomise all of his influences into mist. What remains is a free-floating collection of sounds that not only still works as pastiche, but also somehow provides the basis for a remarkable dance record. Of course, it might well be that the reason Lindstrøm finds it easier to play loose with his productions is because he's got a voice like Christabelle's to anchor them. A Norwegian with Mauritian roots, she slides effortlessly into pretty much any groove he provides, moving between slippery spoken word and breathy falsetto with equal ease. Evidently years in the making, Real Life Is No Cool functions partly as a chronicle of the pair's working relationship, spanning as far back as 2003, when she was still recording under the name Solale. While those early collaborations, including the slinky Italo of ""Music (In My Mind)"" and the fluttering space disco workout ""Let's Practise"", make repeat appearances here, they barely hold their own alongside most of the newer material. Of the fresher tracks, the most immediate are probably ""So Much Fun"", a scattershot slice of end-of-the-evening disco that rivals Scissor Sisters at their friskiest; ""Baby Can't Stop"", an unequivocally shameless tribute to Off the Wall-era Michael Jackson that deserves airplay in even spite of Aeroplane's original-dwarfing remix; and ""Lovesick"", an irresistibly slinky head-nodder. Ultimately though, it's the slightly more unstructured, harder to hold tracks that make the most lasting impressions. Album opener ""Looking For What"" surfs along on a wobbly arpeggio, an occasional guitar chug, diffuse piano chords, and spoken-word samples; the stunning ""Keep It Up"" manages to transform a distinctly cheesy retro synth chime into a thing of effortless gorgeousness; and ""High & Low"" starts with a stodgy 1980s sitcom theme vamp before melting into something deliriously woozy.  If the man and his long songs have been off your mixtape radar for the last little while, this should see an end to that.","After elongating his brand of retro-futurism to great song lengths, the Norweigan producer crafts an achingly stylish and neatly accessible dance record.

Carousel,Robin Guthrie,by: Joshua Klein,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a670ea9e61561daa537f/1:1/w_160/186698ed.jpg,2010-01-19 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13536-carousel/,Darla,"The Cocteau Twins' gauzy sound, by Robin Guthrie's own admission, was something of a happy accident, those sheets of shimmering guitars originally intended to disguise his modest technical skills. And Guthrie's innovations went on to inspire a legion of imitators ranging from lazy shoegaze wannabes to the mighty My Bloody Valentine, though few ever improved upon his approach. That mysterious assemblage of patch chords and pedals at some point evolved from a sound to Guthrie's sound, a sonic palette with a personality all its own. No surprise, then, that Carousel, Guthrie's first non-soundtrack solo album since 2006's Continental, sounds like one would expect a Robin Guthrie record to sound-- the man and his métier will forever be linked. Like Continental and much of Guthrie's post-Cocteaus work, the disc is instrumental, and like the best ambient music, its impact will vary. Play it quietly and Guthrie's soundscapes will come off pillow-soft; play it loudly and his compositions prove deceptively dense and not exactly prone to gaps and silence. They are not, however, always memorable, and even though they are concise, they are prone to meander. But that may be the point. Longtime and likeminded Guthrie collaborator Harold Budd would, from the perspective of producer Brian Eno, ""write a piece of music, then take out all the notes [he] didn't like,"" and there's a similar simplicity to Guthrie's songs. Thanks to all the reverberating effects, they don't take that many notes to fill up all the space, and in turn all but demand to recede into the background, like a fog rolling out rather than in. The dynamics of the disc are relatively steady, the melodies redoubtably pretty, the production mostly sanded of any vestigial rough edges or volcanic peaks. Yet playing in the background, the music is, thanks to its particular provenance, never anonymous, with Guthrie's carefully layered guitars as majestic as ever, rippling away like ancient tapestries given a fresh airing. And every once in a while, your brain wanders away from mood and back to the actual music, ever-evocative songs such as ""Sparkle"", ""Delight"", or the particularly dramatic (and relatively oceanic) ""Waiting by the Carousel"", with each chiming note or sustained chord steeped in Guthrie's substantial history. If gorgeous tracks such as album closer ""Little Big Fish"" must come as easily to him as breathing, listening to Guthrie exercise his lungs today remains no less entrancing than it was decades ago. It's as if this music has been resonating somewhere in stasis that whole time and has only now been released to catch up with us.","The latest instrumental album from the mastermind of the Cocteau Twins' sound delivers the magisterial guitar tones one has come to expect from his projects.

Underwater Peoples Winter Review,Various Artists,by: Zach Kelly,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a7d2b1335d7bf169912d/1:1/w_160/e4746d22.jpg,2010-01-19 06:00:03,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13824-underwater-peoples-winter-review/,Underwater Peoples,"Having personality and being personable are two very different things. For a small, niche-centric indie label like Underwater Peoples-- the D.C. collective responsible for nurturing some of the finest examples of 2009 lo-fi-- possessing both of these characteristics is paramount. Reach back to last June's Underwater Peoples Records Showcase (the first installment of what appears to be a kind of bi-annual mixtape giveaway), and you'll find a group of shaggy young artists huddled around a sound that would, in some circles, define a small chunk of last year. Take a minute to peruse the label's blog (or sometimes more helpfully, UP's sister-blog Chocolate Bobka) and you'll find a convivial comraderie amongst handlers, fans, and bands-- a genuine congregation of friends rotating in-and-out of a stable of mostly solid acts. In the case of this second spotlight LP, Underwater Peoples Winter Review, a handful of forward-thinking tunes helpfully draws the focus in over the cozy, close-knit sounds that anchor the label so well. Here, these freshly ordained acts prove Underwater Peoples is not just the house that Real Estate built: In most instances, each new Winter Review artist that didn't appear on Records Showcase outshines the returning familiar faces. That's not to say there aren't highlights from Underwater Peoples' first wave-- Real Estate, Julian Lynch, and Liam the Younger all contribute excellent tracks that reinforce their patented sounds without much fuss or reinvention. But it's the varied collection of burgeoning outfits like Appalachian gospel maidens Mountain Man, sharp-fuzz shoegazers Big Troubles, and minimalist pop advocates Fluffy Lumbers that put up stuff so crisp and clever it almost devalues some of the same-sounding material from the smaller roster vets. It makes for some expected unevenness, but more importantly provides proof that the folks at UP have great sets of ears. While Records Showcase worked best at ""establishing a seasonal mood"" (as Pitchfork's Joe Colly mentioned last summer), Winter Review hinges less on trying to approximate the chillier extremes that mark this season. However, the wintry exceptions are often standouts: Julian Lynch's opener ""Es's"" is a delicate, crystalline swirl of synthesized flute and keyboards; Fluffy Lumbers' (Frat Dad's Samuel Franklin) ""Adoration"" culls mystic boogie from some warm, fictional Fleetwood Mac B-side heard from two rooms over. And while there is an errant chill in Mountain Man's ""Dog Song"", a bewilderingly lovely number from the all-female Vermont trio, its frightening foothill-harmonies prove perennially awing. Still, what's more important here is that the compilation succeeds when at its most distinct and inventive; failures can largely be attributed to a sort of general homogenization of the label's stock and trade. It's not that the sameness isn't welcome when applied properly: Real Estate's ""Orchard"" is a pretty, country-fried jam; Pill Wonder's ""Restless"" boasts woozy string clips that melt into a pleasantly churchy mid-tempo waltz; Liam the Younger's terrific closer ""Please See"" transforms a shy acoustic plea into a bright, Arcade Fire-like life-affirmer. But entries like Frat Dad's ""Totally Afraid"" (which sounds like a teenager's idea of an ironic Doors cover) or Real Estate bassist Alex Bleeker's ""These Days"" (the perfect soundtrack to watching your dad set up his brand new Margaritaville® blender) feel soggy up against more assured songwriting. Like, for instance, Air Waves' rolling strummer ""Sweetness"", a bright piece of folk-pop that sounds practically hi-fi in relation to everything else. It's in these moments we can see the real value in branching out-- however hospitable and homey Underwater Peoples needs to be, it's personality that goes a long way. And Winter Review has characters to spare.","The upstart Underwater Peoples-- the label that birthed Real Estate-- follows its summer 2009 comp with another seasonal collection.

Athens,Underworld Vs. the Misterons,by: Andrew Gaerig,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a7e25e6ef959693210a4/1:1/w_160/83afa0f5.jpg,2010-01-19 06:00:02,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13833-athens/,!K7,"Underworld like records. And not just records, mind you, but an eclectic array of records not entirely composed with sequencers and drum machines. Such seems to be the message of Athens, the new full-length compilation put together by the 1990s dance music figureheads. A spattering of jazz, techno, and pop, Athens is almost exactly what you would expect Underworld's record collection to look like, plus or minus a Mahavishnu Orchestra track. Credited to Underworld vs. the Misterons, Athens-- 12 mostly unmixed tracks (the record features slight transitions but for the most part presents its tracks in full)-- was compiled by Underworld's Karl Hyde and Rick Smith as well as studio buddy Darren Price and friend-of-band creative-type Steven Hall. The draw here, even for dedicated Underworld fans, seems dull: The cover features a painting by Hyde, and included are the 1997 soundtrack instrumental ""Oh"" as well as a ""hidden""-- it's track 12-- collaboration between Hyde and Brian Eno that closes the album on a strong note. The selections are mostly bulletproof: If you're looking for bad words against Alice Coltrane, Carl Craig, and Roxy Music, please look elsewhere. Athens actually flows fairly nicely. From the near-ambience of Coltrane's ""Journey in Satchidananda"" and Squarepusher's extra-jazzy ""Theme From Sprite"" to Roxy's comparatively cohesive ""2 H.B."", then culminating with a trio of banging dance numbers, Athens makes a reasonable case linking improvised jazz and Underworld's brand of hard-charging dance. Surprising choices like Laurent Garnier's ""Gnaumankoudji (Broken-Afro Mix)"" and Miroslav Vitous' ""New York City"" prove Underworld's crates at least a little deeper than their average fan's. The always underrated Moodymann's ""Rectify"" even offers the missing link between the earlier jazz fusion and the later electro-funk: looped jazz samples. Your enjoyment of Athens will depend disproportionately on how interested you are in Underworld's record collection at a time when Underworld's profile seems low, even for an aging electronic duo. Athens, after all, is a bit of an odd proposition (the promo materials also come stuffed with quotes from Underworld about how modern electronic music lacks musicianship). This is no surprise: You don't pull off career-defining, 13-minute shapeshifters like ""Mmm... Skyscraper I Love You"" by being modest and self-aware. Packaging a compilation of jazz-influenced work as an affront to modern trends, however, is a fresh brand of off-putting, one that begs the question of what, exactly, Underworld are listening to. More likely, Athens is merely an innocuous pet project packaged as something more significant: There is an ocean of perception between ""Underworld vs. the Misterons: Athens"" and ""Underworld and friends: Some Songs We Like."" Athens never descends into outright tedium, but it offers little insight into Underworld's creativity and just as little in terms of exclusives or rare tracks. If the tracklist here promises you true discovery, or if you're an Underworld junkie, dive in, just don't be fooled by the ""project"" posturing.","The famed progressive house band collect a few of their favorite things.

Inspired by ancient Pythagorean principles, each of the artists on Harmony of the Spheres strived to transform the base materials of folk, country blues, ambient, and psych-rock into vehicles for innovative, wholly unique personal expression. It's never easy to conclusively measure an album's influence-- particularly a boutique collection with a limited initial pressing. But at the very least, it can be said that Harmony of the Spheres has since proven to be uncommonly prescient, as the music contained on its six sides anticipated the direction of many subsequent branches of avant-rock, shadowy folk, and glo-fi. And the album's echoes are certainly in easy evidence on this split album by Portland's Grouper (aka singer-songwriter Liz Harris) and the prolific New Zealand guitarist Roy Montgomery, himself a Harmony of the Spheres alum. In fact, the echoes are literal on Montgomery's side, as he here presents a lovely live version of his majestic piece ""Fantasia on a Theme by Sandy Bull"", which first appeared on Harmony of the Spheres. But Grouper's songs seem to be direct spiritual descendents as well. Constructed using elemental strands of voice, submerged instruments, and field recordings, Harris' work here is never less than captivating, and a decade and a half later it seems in its own way a perfect distillation of Harmony of the Sphere's music and guiding principles. On the original version of ""Fantasia on a Theme by Sandy Bull"", Montgomery took melodic cues from Bull's album E Pluribus Unum, gradually layering his gently strummed chords with multi-tracked effects and overtones to build dense and formidable sheets of sound. For this solo recording, the piece has been necessarily stripped-down, and the loss of the overdubbed layers of dissonance and texture do somewhat diminish its overall effect. Still, Montgomery is a skillful player with a distinctive, immediately recognizable sound, and in the crowded field of solo guitarists, that can sometimes be half the battle. Though it is not quite as transcendent as the original version, it can be a hypnotic pleasure to hear Montgomery cycle through this track's revolving, raga-like melodic ideas. Grouper's half of the split is even more rewarding, and the music Harris presents here is among her most focused and spellbinding to date. Though divided into four tracks, her side seems composed to be heard as one continuous whole, as her vocals and source recordings bleed from one track into the next. As with such peers as Charalambides' Christina Carter or Fursaxa's Tara Burke, there is a timeless quality to Harris' vocals on ""Hollow Press"" or ""Hold the Way"". Her simple melodies and scales can occasionally recall the medieval vocal music of Hildegard Von Bingen, which, combined with her obscured or non-existent lyrics, can give her work a delicate liturgical character. Her primary backing instrument of choice here seems to be a processed Rhodes or Wurlitzer keyboard, and its warm, distorted texture blends invisibly into grainy tape effects to give the whole performance a welcome degree of hazy dissonance. It is especially lovely to hear the way these songs seem to emerge out of the static and then return again to darkness, as though they are being broadcast from an orbiting satellite that is only briefly in range of Earth, with Grouper's music already moving on to seek harmonies on another heavenly plane.","Grouper follows her outstanding 2008 LP with another mix of submerged instruments and field recordings, on a split with a new Roy Montgomery track.

Transference,Spoon,by: Matthew Perpetua,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a7e65e6ef959693210b2/1:1/w_160/75f51332.jpg,2010-01-19 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13839-transference/,Merge,"Up to this point, Spoon have employed their signature tight pocket grooves as a shorthand for authority, certainty, and swagger. It's one of the most appealing things about the band, and the sound has made even Britt Daniel's most vulnerable moments seem grounded and forthright. They've turned it all inside-out on Transference, subtly shifting the leading signifiers of Spoon-iness just so for a destabilizing effect. Their go-to trick for the first half of the album is to include bits of sound that abruptly cut off, usually sung phrases that drop entirely out of the mix mid-syllable. This may be aggravating for some listeners, but this counterintuitive move makes sense in context, indicating distraction and tongue-tied indecision. This is a perfect example of the group's genius as a studio band: They get very cerebral in arranging their material, but every clever move is entirely in the service of maximizing physical impact and gut-level response. These are not simply recordings of a top-notch rock quartet playing in a room; this is art built to hit precise emotional marks with an impressive balance of off-the-cuff improvisation and rigid discipline. Though their previous records have opened with stylish, immediately thrilling numbers like ""Small Stakes"" and ""The Beast and Dragon, Adored"", Transference begins with ""Before Destruction"", a pensive slow-burner that's more of a muted prelude than a flashy entrance. We're knocked off-balance from the beginning, and the next few songs sustain a sense of confusion and disorientation. ""Is Love Forever?"", a jaunty cut that sounds as though Daniel were aiming to write a much dizzier version of Phoenix's ""Listzomania"", bumps right into ""The Mystery Zone"", an excellent late-night groover that hits the same sweet spot as older gems like ""Don't You Evah"" and ""I Turn My Camera On"". When that track ends suddenly, it's like walking right into a wall before ""Who Makes Your Money"" has you wobbling along with Daniel in a concussed haze. The album sobers up as it moves along, and the progression always makes a certain emotional sense, but it's ultimately a big pile-up of unorthodox creative decisions. On first pass, Transference seems a bit off, even somewhat sloppy for a band known for keeping things focused and snappy. However, upon closer listening it becomes obvious that these guys have made a meticulously crafted ""mess"" that conveys the feeling of flailing around and failing in search of meaningful connections. The name of the album refers to the Freudian concept of unconsciously projecting feelings for one person or thing to another. It's also the term used to describe when a patient develops a romantic attachment to their analyst, mistaking the intimacy of that relationship for actual love. Transference isn't a concept album, but it's not hard to figure out why they might have chosen the title. There's a nagging desperation for ""real"" love at the core of this record, tangled up in a genuine cluelessness about what it is or how it works. ""The Mystery Zone"" finds Daniel theorizing about relationships and unknowable fates like a rambling, semi-coherent drunk, stumbling up to big ideas but trailing off or nodding out before saying anything that makes complete sense. ""Written in Reverse"" seethes with the bitterness of unrequited love, and Daniel's larynx-shredding vocal hits the right note of resentment and resignation as he spits out lines like, ""I wanna show you how I love you, but there's nothing there."" Even the most stable tracks seem frustrated or tentative. The gorgeous ""Out Go the Lights"" sounds as exhausted as it is lovesick, and the scorching ""Got Nuffin"" confronts neuroses head-on with plucky courage, but also a chugging riff that evokes gut-churning anxiety. It's hardly uncommon for Spoon songs to deal with failed love and thwarted desire, but Daniel has rarely sounded so vulnerable and his feelings have never seemed so unresolved. Some may hear Transference and get the impression that it's an incomplete or uneven work, but its elliptical nature is ultimately the key to its charm. All through the record, Britt Daniel sounds like a guy left hanging by life, waiting around to figure out the answers to all his questions. It wouldn't make sense for him to tell you anything he doesn't know himself. Though the band produced the album themselves, half of the songs on Transference are presented in their original ""demo"" form, resulting in unexpected shifts between raw and slick audio textures. Since Daniel and drummer Jim Eno are experienced engineers, almost nothing on the album could rightly be considered lo-fi, but there is a disarming immediacy to these less polished tracks that makes the record as a whole seem very relaxed and informal in comparison to their previous efforts. ""Goodnight Laura"", a straightforward ballad on the album's second side, gains a lot from this approach, with an intimate ""live"" sound that gives the impression that you've accidentally stumbled into a Spoon rehearsal. ""Trouble Comes Running"" has the opposite effect with its dramatic stereo separations, but the low-key feeling of the recording preserves an energy that may have been flattened with a more full production. Both of these tracks could be considered ""minor"" Spoon songs, but they reveal just how high the bar has been set for Daniel and company, and how easily their skill can be taken for granted. Following the creative strides made on their last few Merge releases, the only big surprise on Transference is that they've become willing to let their hair down a bit. It can be a bit of a let down if you come in expecting another blockbuster like Ga Ga Ga Ga Ga, but something of a revelation if you meet them halfway.","Trading some of their signature groove for a more destabilizing sound, Spoon have created an offbeat, unexpected, but ultimately cerebral record.

Climb Up,Apse,by: Joe Colly,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a7cbea9e61561daa5680/1:1/w_160/5b811c73.jpg,2010-01-18 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13819-climb-up/,ATP,"Apse's 2006 debut, Spirit, recorded for the Spanish imprint Acuarela Discos and later reissued by ATP, found the Connecticut-based band making woozy space rock with a solid sense of ambience. It was classic post-rock, updated with a slight twist. In part because of the nod from ATP (who know a thing or two about forward-thinking musicians), the group looked at the time like possible successors to genre vets like Tortoise and Mogwai. Since then, Apse shed a few members and decamped to Cape Cod to record their latest, Climb Up-- a vast departure from Spirit that trades their debut's gloomy swirl for a more linear, prog-leaning take on chugging radio rock. While I can certainly appreciate a band's desire to shake things up or approach its audience more directly, in this case the aesthetic shift doesn't seem to suit Apse's strengths. Their new formula, which puts a greater empasis on riffs and frontman Robert Toher's distracting vocal whine, swaps out the dreaminess of past recordings for something closer in style to the Mars Volta at their most straightforward, or more accurately, Muse. The ethereal qualities of Spirit have mostly gone missing, and with the exception of a few charming instrumental numbers (the pastoral psychedelia of ""Tropica"" and ""In Gold""), Climb Up is filled with an odd (for indie listeners, at least) brand of stadium-sized rock that can't quite escape the notions of cheese and bloat that accompany that term. Apse recorded the album themselves and do better with weight-- the sound is big and dense-- than they do economy. Climb Up's 12 tracks clock in at almost 60 minutes, and its individual pieces are stretched beyond their natural limits. That's particularly true on the slow-building numbers like ""Lie"", where Toher tests us, drawing each quavering vocal note out to several seconds over a plodding Dark Side of the Moon instrumental. Though a few winning songs are sprinkled throughout-- ""3.1"" nicely blends two sets of vocals over heavy stomps and chiming guitars-- even the faster-paced material here comes off as needling and overwrought. (Seemingly radio-ready prog-rock numbers ""Rook"", ""The Age"", and ""The Whip"" all suffer this fate.) By the time I get to the end of the record, which revs up the melody and swing too late, I'm spent. Toher goes on to claim on the final track ""Closure"" that he's ""never had a party as cool as this one"", and, man, I hope that's not true.","New England post-rock group trades their debut's gloomy swirl for a more linear, prog-leaning take on chugging radio rock.

July Flame,Laura Veirs,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a7a29d034d5c69bf3848/1:1/w_160/7837d2c4.jpg,2010-01-18 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13783-july-flame/,Bella UnionRaven Marching Band,"I'm trying to imagine Laura Veirs playing in a Pacific Northwest-style girl punk group. Apparently, that's what her first band was, back when she was studying geology and Mandarin Chinese at college in Minnesota. Her voice is so suited to the neo-folk path she's chosen to follow in her subsequent career that it's sort of tough to conjure an angry yelp from her. Not that she's all sweetness and light-- her albums have always housed their fair share of darkness and turmoil. They've just favored subtle ways to present those things. On her seventh album, July Flame, Veirs takes all the best things about her previous output, including her two justly lauded efforts for Nonesuch, and distills them into her best record. Veirs has never brought so many great songs to a single album, and longtime producer Tucker Martine captures a warmth in Veirs' voice and acoustic guitar that immediately welcomes you in, from the first floating, Leonard Cohen-ish guitar part that levitates the simple album opener ""I Can See Your Tracks"". Strangely for a record released in the grip of winter, July Flame has the atmosphere of a sweet summer night, with fireflies and an insect chorus-- it's not the direct heat of a summer day, but a fading, residual heat. It's also a patient record built around vocal melody and flashes of lyrical imagery. The summer feel is probably not accidental-- a July flame is a type of peach-- and it proves good inspiration for a lot of surprising and truly lovely moments. The title track orbits a simple but sturdy electric guitar phrase and mallet drumming, mixing real viola with a string synthesizer for a really interesting texture leading up to the choral final chorus. The instrumentation sometimes looks odd on paper-- a pump organ here, a bass clarinet there, tenor sax in a folk setting, but every unorthodox choice is well-made. Eyvind Kang's viola is played in a style halfway between bluegrass fiddling and classical formalism on ""Where Are You Driving?"", mingling with the pump organ and banjo to create a weird little world. Stephen Barber's string arrangement on the troubled but optimistic closer ""Make Something Good"" is less window dressing than a yearning answer to her assertion, ""It's gonna take a long, long time/ But we're gonna make something so fine."" There are a couple of spectacular song's at the record's heart-- ""Summer Is the Champion"" is a swinging rave-up that bursts with horns after its second jazz-inflected chorus, while ""Wide-Eyed, Legless"" is a mysterious, almost Floydian psych-folk song with an utterly infectious verse melody. But Veirs is just as effective in the understated moments. ""When You Give Your Heart"" wrings gobs of loveliness from just a few guitars and a canny rhythmic shift to the chorus, and then there's ""Carole Kaye"", a sweet and clearly heartfelt tribute to the great session bassist with lyrics fashioned from the titles of the some of the many huge hits Kaye played on. The refrain ""It would be so cool to be like Carol, Carol Kaye"" is disarming in its refreshing modesty. Veirs probably doesn't need to be so modest-- her band of Kang, Martine, Steve Moore, Jon Neufield, and longtime collaborator Karl Blau is bolstered by a couple of big guests in My Morning Jacket's Jim James and the Decemberists' guitarist Chris Funk. But a little bit of starry-eyed hero worship amidst all the poetic imagery keeps the album grounded in spite of all its poetic flights, and July Flame is ultimately a record that's easy to get into and just as easy to stay with.","Neo-folkie takes the best aspects of her two previous records and distills them into her best album.

Rain on the City,Freedy Johnston,by: Joshua Klein,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a7cfea9e61561daa5690/1:1/w_160/a4528201.jpg,2010-01-18 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13815-rain-on-the-city/,Bar/None,"Breakthrough and backlash: with some exceptions, the former eventually begets the latter, no matter how wrongly deserved. The transition is part of the natural balance of things, and many artists unable to circumvent and survive the inevitable have been left behind, wondering what went wrong. Freedy Johnston's no stranger to this familiar story. His much-lauded second album, 1992's Can You Fly, put him on the radar just as grunge was marginalizing singer-songwriters, and the conspicuous choice of Butch Vig as producer of his 1994 follow-up This Perfect World made the dialectic that much more apparent and severe. Johnston was an instantly unfashionable anachronism. All that and people still pronounced and spelled his last name ""Johnson."" The funny thing about good songwriters, however, is that they often stay good, even when no one is listening. Or, in the case of Johnston, even when they stop releasing albums. Rain on the City marks Johnston's first album in eight years, following a series of the usual stopgaps, including live discs, demo collections, and a classy but still pretty MOR covers album. And you know what? It's pretty good. That much anyone aware of Johnston's past highpoints probably could have predicted. What's more surprising is how effortless this long-in-the-making disc sounds, reminiscent of Johnston's best work without sounding consciously referential or reverential to the past, deceptively diverse despite its relatively conservative bent. Songs like ""Don't Fall in Love With a Lonely Girl"" or ""Venus Is Her Name"" are rootsy, but not quite roots rock. There are glimmers of jangly power-pop in songs such as ""The Other Side of Love"", country in ""Livin' Too Close to the Rio Grande"" and ""It's Gonna Come Back to You"", and soulful 70s AM rock in ""The Devil Raises His Own"", but none of those are really what this record is, either. Or rather, they are, but the disc is deeper than its default templates. As a practiced journeyman, Johnston remains first and foremost an observant and tuneful chronicler of odd characters (one must presume including himself), small lives and lost souls with big feelings, struggling to get by in flyover country and cities alike. His sometimes wronged, often wrong-headed subjects here find hope in hopeless situations and comfort when love and luck has run out, and Johnston finds ways to convey those contradictions with a minimum of fuss heightened by plenty of melodic flourishes. His take on bossa nova, for example, ""The Kind of Love We're In"", impressively skirts light rock kitsch, and the song is better minus the knowing wink that lesser writers might have leaned on for support. At every turn throughout the lean but hardly light album, Johnston once again proves himself a master of subtle songcraft, almost to a fault. Indeed, other acts would trade his ellipses for exclamation points. Yet here he is now, quietly residing in the same purgatory that houses such once-popular songwriters as disparate as Jackson Browne, John Hiatt, and Marshall Crenshaw, among countless other acts betrayed by cultural flux. It's not a question of whether someone like Johnston will ever reclaim a larger audience; it's whether an audience even exists for music like this anymore. His loss is their loss, too, but at least he can be confident that he tried his best.","The dependable singer-songwriter who debuted in the alt-rock era returns with his first album of new songs in eight years.

The Colossus,RJD2,by: Patrick Sisson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a7b7b1335d7bf16990f4/1:1/w_160/8faa7b19.jpg,2010-01-18 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13801-the-colossus/,RJ's Electrical Connections,"Independence is thrilling, but after those first tentative or defiant steps towards freedom, the urge to look back and survey the situation you just left can be hard to resist. That seemingly contradictory perspective, looking both forward and backwards, was at play when Rjd2 wrote The Colossus. His fourth solo album arrives at a pivotal moment, and not just because it follows the lyrical trainwreck and one man-band overreach of The Third Hand. The producer is now more than a successful yet hungry talent; he's the boss, head of the new RJ's Electrical Connections imprint. Taken in tandem with the recent release of the vinyl-only career retrospective 2002-2010, it's unsurprising he's in a reflective mood. The Colossus, as its name implies, strives for scale, but also strains a bit under a heavy burden. While Rjd2 excels at sonic collages, the mixed motives on this album-- a current spin on past techniques, a synthesis of old songs and a turn toward the future-- are difficult to balance. After years spent mastering instruments and recording techniques, he still finds a new way to overachieve, adding his own passable, if sometimes bland, live drumming to five tracks. But, as if admitting his DIY ethos and perfectionist tendencies on Third Hand went too far, he brought in a team of guest vocalists and instrumentalists to augment his own performances. Interlude ""Salud"", featuring a goofy British voice similar to the one on Deadringer, says as much: ""I've [#script:http://pitchfork.com/media/backend/js/tiny_mce/themes/advanced/langs/en.js]|||||| assembled a healthy bunch of folks who are much more talented than I am."" But more important to anyone put off by his unique foray into singer-songwriter territory, he rediscovers, or at least indulges in, some of the mood-setting backgrounds and rattling, rigged-to-explode instrumentals that originally made him such a vital producer. ""Let There be Horns"" opens the album with stretched-out, Looney Tunes strings and a vaguely Latin beat, jumping between staccato breakdowns and guitar riffs. The applause during the song's conclusion might as well be the sound of some fans breathing a collective sigh of relief on a partial return to form, since the dust-heavy samples have long been replaced with more electrified melodies. But just as quickly as he comes out of the gate, ""Games Can Win"" re-enters more shaky singer-songwriter territory. While his lyrical abilities, which still haven't caught up to his compositional skills, produce some clunkers (""Play your hand close/ Like you have a glass chin""), he takes a step forward in terms of balance with appropriately toned down percussion. The rest of the album trades off between rumbling tracks like ""Small Plans"" and a few songwriting efforts like the ""The Glow"", which --with it's smug focus on having ""the glow,"" overseas accounts and living a life of leisure-- seems like the interior monologue of a bailed-out banker. It's still pretty creaky but better than the cringe-inducing moments from The Third Hand. Rjd2 showcases a grasp of mood and a talent for arranging on The Colossus. His backing of Phonte Coleman's soulful vocal turn on ""Shining Path"" and the springy, triumphant synths on posse cut ""A Son's Cycle"" are both understated yet fitting. But on tracks like the eerie ""The Stranger"", rolling with punched-up drums and clipped guitars, or ""Giant Squid"", which bounces on a guttural beat, the career fusion concept pays off. His instrumental skills, and the synth-funk of Since We Last Spoke (in full overdrive on the movie theater sound check that is ""A Spaceship for Now"") help bring more string tones and textures to the mix, but he manages to capture some of that foreboding yet funky mood from his early work. He's spent the last few albums trying to go beyond sampling songs to creating them from scratch, and he still can sound like he's cramming tributes to half of his record collection on the same track. But when his relentless drive and sense of restraint match up, they make parts of this album a forward thinking look back.","After a foray into singer-songwriter territory, Rjd2 rediscovers mood-setting backgrounds and rattling, rigged-to-explode instrumentals.

The Dark Side of the Moon,The Flaming LipsStardeath and White Dwarfs,by: Rob Mitchum,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a7e1ea9e61561daa56b6/1:1/w_160/ec8bdaa9.jpg,2010-01-18 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13836-the-dark-side-of-the-moon/,Warner Bros.,"Like the prism on the iconic cover of Dark Side of the Moon, Pink Floyd's legacy can be refracted many different ways. For one, there's the different eras marked by different bandleaders, from Syd Barrett's storybook psychedelia to Roger Waters misanthropic art-rock to David Gilmour's inoffensive arena-filling stuff. But there are also more subjective takes on the Floyd's influence: you could view them as psych-prog pioneers or the bloat that inspired punk, the band that pushed the limit of the rock concert or the band that made the concert more about theatrics than music, studio wizards or mere inventors of a popular stereo test record. You might divine then why Floyd appeals to the Flaming Lips right now. I count at least five of those things on that list that could be lobbed (fairly or un-) at the Lips after 27 years; being hated by Johnny Rotten is the only one (probably) beyond their reach. And their appreciation runs deep-- in an interview with Pitchfork's Ryan Dombal, Wayne Coyne remembered goofing on Jesus and Mary Chain fans by covering ""Wish You Were Here"", when the bands toured together in 1984. But why tackle hoary old Dark Side now, on the heels of the band's triumphant return to in-your-face psychedelic weirdness on last year's Embryonic? And why invite a cavalcade of characters-- Peaches, Henry Rollins, Coyne's nephew's band-- certain to make people think it's all a gag? After all, Dark Side of the Moon is an album so ingrained in the collective consciousness your grandma can probably call ""Money” from the first ring of the cash register. It was also, arguably, Floyd's big money play-- a strange thing to say for a 40-minute continuous song cycle, but a clear conclusion when you look at the swollen 20-minute epics and found-sound experiments that came before it on Meddle and Atom Heart Mother. Ambitious and as tightly wound as a symphony, Dark Side is nevertheless made up of detachable movements that can double as standalone pop songs and classic rock staples. The Lips, of course, don't go for precision or radio-friendliness, even as they seem to be paying tribute rather than taking the piss out of Pink Floyd. Perhaps the Soft Bulletin-era Lips would've had some interest in recreating the grandeur of the Floyd's original, but the run-through sometimes resembles a sibling of Embyronic's oddities. ""Breathe"", in both its appearances, reprises the jagged bass grooves and guitar sqwonk of ""Convinced of the Hex"" and ""See the Leaves"", while ""On the Run"" and ""Any Colour You Like"" are fractured space-boogie that echo the gloriously messy sprawl of ""Powerless"" and ""The Ego's Last Stand"". Those standout instrumentals are collaborations with Stardeath and White Dwarfs, the band fronted by Wayne Coyne's nephew Dennis Coyne, and both make Coyne family reunions sound like good, illegal fun-- jammy affairs that sprinkle some much needed disco dust on Floyd's austere originals. Left to their own devices, Stardeath's take on ""Time"" and ""Brain Damage"" are less inspired, the former replacing the clockwork rhythm with coughing and panting and lost lyrics, the latter coming off relatively flat compared to the original, despite well-deployed singing saw. The kids shouldn't feel so bad, as the old guys don't fare too well themselves, neutering ""Money"" into a mechanized 8-bit lope, and minimally adjusting the track that needs the most help, the plodding ""Us and Them"". The second tier of guests are also a split decision. Peaches' job is basically to moan orgasmically through ""Great Gig in the Sky"". But Henry Rollins, tasked with recreating the snippets of dialogue from Floyd's crew that float around the original, contributes all the line-reading talent you'd expect from the star of ""The Chase"" and ""Feast"". At least he doesn't attempt an English accent. The guest star clusterfuck brings to mind the similar project of the Lips' former tourmate Beck, whose Record Club series brings a random cast of characters to record an album in one day. The comparison doesn't reflect well on this Dark Side though, which comes off stiffer than Beck's ramshackle recreations, but without much in the way of thoughtful annotations to add to the original text. At its best, it's a more unhinged take on Floyd's song cycle of insanity-- like putting the Floyd that played ""Interstellar Overdrive"" into a time machine to meet the Floyd that wrote ""Money"". But the Flaming Lips and their co-conspirators can't settle on a color of the Floyd spectrum and run with it, leaving this Dark Side as a lunar capsule lost somewhere between a love letter and a joke.","Originally conceived for a New Year's Eve show, the Flaming Lips and guests Peaches and Henry Rollins cover the Pink Floyd classic.

Hustler's Son,Jason Boesel,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a7d8c0084474cd0c0cbb/1:1/w_160/9ec8dfde.jpg,2010-01-15 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13828-hustlers-son/,Team Love,"If you happen to be in a cubicle while reading this, there's a good chance you've experienced the following. Look around you: These are people you've worked with 40 hours a week, for months, if not years. And yet you got to really know them better after a mere 40 minutes spent outside the office. It's interesting how this has applied to Rilo Kiley: since The Execution of All Things, they've been blatantly bear-hugging the most outwardly tacky and glossy aspects of pop music (except the songs), but each of their solo endeavors could be taken as a show of one-upmanship in ""keepin' it real"". Guitarist Blake Sennett followed the lead of the Postal Service by forming the Elected, a Jimmy Tamborello-endorsed indie-country act; Jenny Lewis' two solo albums boasted a rootsiness almost completely inverse to the arc of her main gig; while bassist Pierre de Reeder makes inward-looking folk-pop. And now, drummer Jason Boesel is letting his freak-flag fly with... an album of what might have been known about 15 years ago as alt-country. Now, that's about as entry-level as genres get for those looking to make their solo bow, but Boesel's C.V. checks out: after playing in the Elected, right around when Bright Eyes went full-bore (in both ways) troubadour, he joined its touring lineup, and would eventually contribute two songs to Conor Oberst's Mystic Valley Band album. Benmont Tench, Orenda Fink, and David Rawlings pay back favors by contributing to Hustler's Son, so you know it's going to sound tasteful. Boesel has a sturdy voice that sidles up nicely with the lower registers of the National's Mat Berninger and Okkervil River's Will Sheff, though he does lend himself to a bit of distracting hayseed diction. It's not quite as much of an issue on the opening ""Black Wave"", a country-noir piece that finds him rambling through Tennessee on a horse with no name, setting a loping pace that extends throughout and belies the album's title. The lyrics rarely become pointed outside of an interesting turn of phrase (""I thought I was a secret/ But I was too easy to keep""), but the specter of death and personal heartache hover over Hustler's Son. Even if the formalism of his songwriting tends to ensure that they never go somewhere you don't expect, Boesel occasionally builds to some rousing choruses that shake off the generally languorous mood. The hook of murder ballad ""Hand of God"" reaches for the rafters despite the heavy weight of guilt on its narrator and the lumbering waltz of ""I Got the Reason #1"" picks through the best parts of Grant Lee Buffalo's Copperopolis, though the latter's momentum is squandered when Boesel's pen game goes all Juelz Santana by repeating the same word at the end of nearly every line (""Was It, Man?""). But the obvious question becomes, ""Hey, I've never heard a second of Rilo Kiley in my life. What's this album going to do for me?"" Tough call: For Boesler, association does more to make Hustler's Son stand out than its preciously few musical curveballs. ""Getting Healthy (Good Luck)"" is the one track that nods towards Boesler's day job as stickman, but as a songwriter, he can't find his footing in the rhythm, and the title track, supposedly the first song he ever wrote, has an easy-going early Wilco vibe, but demands a vocal with more wear or grit in it. In its defense, Hustler's Son isn't spectacular, but it's an honest and modest document.

All Shall Fall,Immortal,by: Cosmo Lee,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a714c0084474cd0c0ae6/1:1/w_160/d8450a86.jpg,2010-01-15 06:00:03,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13671-all-shall-fall/,Nuclear Blast,"Unlike their 1990s Norwegian black metal colleagues, Immortal aren't glamorous. The band mostly avoided the church burnings and murders that made black metal notorious-- its core of vocalist/guitarist Abbath, drummer Horgh, and lyricist/ex-guitarist Demonaz has remained squeaky clean. They're not Satanists; they're inspired by Norway's wintry landscapes. Their lyrics often describe a fantasy world called Blashyrkh. For evidence of the band's un-hipness, do a Google Images search for ""Immortal."" You'll see some of the silliest band photos ever taken. Essentially, Immortal took KISS' white-faced shtick to risible extremes. The band is the butt of jokes inside and outside of metal. Its music isn't, however. Out of the ""second wave"" of black metal (the ""first wave"" consisted of proto-black metal like Venom, Bathory, and Hellhammer), Immortal's music has held up the strongest. Darkthrone and Ulver don't play black metal anymore. Enslaved and Satyricon moved towards prog rock and rock'n'roll, respectively. Mayhem and Gorgoroth have suffered from inconsistent lineups leading to inconsistent music. Immortal's core members, on the other hand, have perfected a singular sound. Their debut, 1992's Diabolical Fullmoon Mysticism, was a glorious, lo-fi blur. But the band's sound gradually sharpened. The drumming became more linear and precise. The guitars grew faster and more focused. Eventually, the band became an interesting combination of opposites. Its streams of blastbeats were hypnotic, yet Abbath's riffs were grand and melodic, referencing thrash and traditional metal. He sang about big things-- war, winds, and winter-- in a lovable, Popeye-esque croak. While the band's makeup came from black metal, its music had none of the genre's blasphemy or misanthropy. All Shall Fall emphasizes this in a big way. Its predecessors this decade, Damned in Black and Sons of Northern Darkness, featured clean production unusual for black metal. All Shall Fall sounds even more polished. It has state-of-the-art production, with highly compressed drums, huge-sounding guitars, and a massive overall soundscape. The sound may be startling for those accustomed to black metal's typical rawness. It's unconventional even for Immortal; the [#script:http://pitchfork.com/media/backend/js/tiny_mce/themes/advanced/langs/en.js]|||||| band now has a sound fit for stadiums. But the technical wizardry is appropriate. It brings out the fact that Abbath is a phenomenal guitarist. His axe chugs, sings, and weaves gleaming webs. Horgh no longer sounds like a drum machine left unattended. He pounds hard, buttressing Abbath's riffs with rousing syncopations. The result is powerful. All Shall Fall may be the closest black metal has come to sounding like the northern winds it references. When Abbath sings about ""warriors with cold blazing eyes,"" he could be referring to Immortal.","The 1990s Norwegian black metal band is still sharpening its singular sound.

Legendary Hearts / New Sensations,Lou Reed,by: Jess Harvell,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a7d69d034d5c69bf38c9/1:1/w_160/8d6b7bc3.jpg,2010-01-15 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13827-legendary-hearts-new-sensations/,Iconoclassic,"Lou Reed's run of early-1980s solo albums hit longtime fans with the force of revelation: Finally, after suffering through umpteen aesthetically schizo 70s albums, Reed had assembled his most consistent and adventurous band since the Velvets. 1982's The Blue Mask, featuring guitarist Robert Quine's virtuoso blend of post-Reed skronk and speed-folkie melodicism, is still the one to slot alongside Transformer and Street Hassle. The album realigned Reed with the punk and new/no wave movements he helped sire, and it was helped into the canon by Reed's strongest (and most heart-wrenching) batch of songs in years. But 30 years on, it's hard to hear The Blue Mask as sonically assaultive so much as brutally personal, in a way that's got less to do with guitar dissonance than Reed's fearless self-laceration. Not since ""Heroin"" had Reed written a song as harrowing as ""The Blue Mask"", where the lyrics have the hideous specificity of a newly sober man unleashing a lot of backed-up self-examination. 1983's Legendary Hearts-- which reassembles most of the Blue Mask band, swapping drummer Fred Maher for Doane Perry-- is fleeter and funnier where the previous album ground down at its themes. It's playful without being indulgent, the kind of record hardcore fans come to treasure because it proves that even their hero's second-tier efforts, the ones that get passed over when they're not starred in the record guides, can hide secret charms. What impresses 27 years on is Reed's range: ""Don't Talk to Me About Work"" is a nasty little one-note jab at 9-to-5 drudgery, akin to the gags that littered early Replacements albums (albeit way more literate, as you'd expect). But it's followed by ""Make Up Mind"", a ballad as tender as anything on The Velvet Underground, Reed and Quine feeding each other little bursts and swells of melody as the bass and drums keep heartbeat time. That range sometimes gets him into trouble, however. Reed's voice-- an instrument suited to, well, Lou Reed songs and very little else-- remains the most divisive component of his music. New listeners, or those not already charmed by his penchant for stretching his monotone sing-song via dramatic hops down an octave or two, may cringe a bit at the ultra-mannered emoting on ""Betrayed"". But by 1983, Reed had mastered the conversational style that starts with ""I'm Waiting for the Man"". The mumble-murmur of ""Turn Out the Light"" is so clearly Reed, providing such a specific kind of pleasure, that it might as well come with a trademark symbol attached to each line. 1984's gussied-up New Sensations sounds initially like a typically nuts Reed all-change after the naked sludge and howl of the previous two albums. Quine and Reed have separated-- in what must have seemed an astoundingly counterintuitive move given the results-- and Quine seems to have gotten the distortion pedals in the settlement. With the feedback and loathing dialed back considerably, the music itself is damn near power-pop in comparison, and the album's self-consciously big-and-clean production is second-string 1984 pop in a nutshell. The songs themselves range from just-okay to damned catchy, perhaps nodding to Reed's earliest days as a Brill Building-era hopeful. And since few artists have made such a virtue out of minimal arrangements, you'd assume an album of Reed bubblegum rock would be, at least, pleasantly perverse. But rather than let his guitar do any sort of heavy-lifting, Reed can't seem to resist adding a gospel choir or an off-the-rack string section or some such nonsense. The backing vocalists on ""My Red Joystick"", with their Vegas-y ersatz soul interjections, might have well been on loan from an ABC record. What can you say: That's how major label record-making went in the mid-80s, even with infamous proto-punk geniuses. Its a shame, because when Reed can restrain himself-- check the pastoral, late-Talking Heads-ish lope of the title track-- New Sensations has the makings of a curious new avenue for Reed's songwriting, a kind of ""Sally Can't Dance done right."" But the period touches, which just feel intrusive at this distance and never reach the unhinged heights of the Anglo-soul class of 1984, make New Sensations a curious period piece and little more.","The two very different paths that Lou Reed traversed after his 1982 comeback The Blue Mask are reissued and remastered.

The Little Match Girl Passion,David Lang,by: Jayson Greene,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a7989d034d5c69bf382b/1:1/w_160/a4bd7a77.jpg,2010-01-15 06:00:01,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13775-the-little-match-girl-passion/,Harmonia Mundi,"Composer David Lang, one of the founders of the art-music collective Bang on a Can, made his name in the late 1980s and 90s penning spiky blasts of music that dared you to hang on for the ride. Early works like ""Cheating, Lying, Stealing"" were statements of intent-- the bristling sort that artistically inflamed young men are prone to making-- and they encapsulated much of downtown New York's hardy oppositional spirit. Twenty-some years later, they are foundational texts for an entire new generation of gleeful polyglots who can't wait to mix their avant-punk, art-rock, electronic, and whatever-else records in with their childhood classical training. In 2008, this lifelong iconoclast won the Pulitzer Prize for Music for The Little Match Girl Passion. The 35-minute oratorio brought mainstream institutional acceptance to a career defined, at least in part, by its absence, and Lang seemed equally grateful and nonplussed by the honor. The Little Match Girl Passion is a breathtakingly spare and icily gorgeous adaptation of the Hans Christian Andersen fairy tale of the same name, and on the surface it couldn't be further from the punky provocations of Lang's youth. It is scored for only four voices-- soprano, alto, tenor, and bass, with the occasional addition of hand bells and percussion-- and the resulting sound world has more in common with Renaissance sacred music or English madrigals than the hip post-minimalism Lang is known for. To some of his acolytes, this sort of thing might look suspiciously like softening with old age. But Lang hasn't softened so much as deepened. Over the last 10 years, he's been increasingly pairing his brasher works with hesitant, quietly spiritual pieces that open up onto more expansive internal vistas, and his Passion is the culmination of this tendency. The Hans Christian Andersen fable is fantastically dark, one of those children's stories that still startles in its brutality. The titular little girl is sent out by her abusive father on New Year's Eve to sell matches, but finds herself ignored by passersby. Unable to return home without money, she tries to warm and distract herself by lighting matches, which summon comforting memories of her grandmother's house on Christmas morning. As she slowly freezes to death, the memories and visions become more vivid until they envelop her. She is found dead in the morning, clutching a handful of burnt-out matches but wearing a beatific smile. Lang has taken this story, with its impossible-to-miss religious overtones, and cast it as a Passion play. The piece is specifically modeled on Bach's St. Matthew Passion, which interrupts the story of Jesus' death with other texts that reflect and comment on the action. This treatment might sound ripe for egregious emotional manipulation, but Lang has nothing of the sort in mind; his gaze is clear-eyed and subdued. In interviews about the work, Lang has alluded to watching the Zapruder film and being struck by how its slow-motion graininess and silence amplifies the tragedy of the Kennedy assassination by placing it behind glass. It doesn't matter which frame of that fated motorcade you see; they are all equally devastating. By breaking up the timeline of the little match girl's suffering with choral lamentations, he has accomplished something similar. From Passion's opening moments-- a slowly accumulating round of voices chanting rhythmic variations on the words ""come"" and ""daughter""-- the tragedy of the story's end is already present. The work is relentlessly minimal, though it feels too unstuck in time to be pegged as ""minimalism."" With an almost ascetic discipline, Lang builds the piece out of tiny melodic cells-- four- or five-note fragments that he wraps around each other again and again, until they produce a haunting and evocative hall of echoes. The heart-stopping ""Have Mercy My God"", for instance, is composed of just two minor chords, broken into five pitches each, which reiterate endlessly and tangle slowly at the edges. Most sections make use of a similar number of notes, the ones that you can find on the piano under one hand without stretching. This humble insistence on economy reinforces the work's theme; Lang seems to be determinedly chiseling away at his music, tuning out outside clamor to hone in on a more elusive inner transmission. In its own quizzical, probing way, The Little Match Girl Passion is as much a devotional piece as the Bach Passion it is modeled on, and with it, Lang has produced the most profound and emotionally resonant work of his career.","Adapting a Hans Christian Andersen fable, the Bang on a Can co-founder has produced the most profound and emotionally resonant work of his career.

Heartland,Owen Pallett,by: Nitsuh Abebe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a7db13d1975652139503/1:1/w_160/d69a16dd.jpg,2010-01-15 06:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13830-heartland/,Domino,"If you're lucky, you might already know this guy as Final Fantasy. His reasons for dropping that name are probably boring and copyright-related, but still: The name change seems healthy on whole other extra-legal levels. I've never known anyone not to be wowed by Final Fantasy's live show, and Final Fantasy's live show is just Owen Pallett: the guy himself, a violin, and a loop pedal. It's about as solo as anything gets-- a performance, not a project. Stepping out under his own name feels like an acknowledgement of this, as if Pallett's ready to cast aside the modesty of having a ""project""-- it's just this thing I've been working on-- and present himself, fully upright, as an artist. And there are a lot of things about Heartland that feel like Pallett is presenting himself more and more fully as an artist; the scope of breadth and mood of it are all grander, more assured, making ever more of a case that the guy shouldn't be viewed as a side note (string arranger for the Arcade Fire, the Pet Shop Boys) or a minor interest (D&D enthusiast, guy who titled an album He Poos Clouds). After all, one of this album's closest cousins in the indie world is a notable, well-regarded one: Joanna Newsom's Ys. Both are ambitious, classicist, cleverly arranged, lyrically high-concept, dense with possible meaning-- and, yes, a little strange. It's that density that separates them, though, and makes me regret having to review this record in any kind of timely fashion. I'm still smarting over having underrated Pallett's last full-length; I knew I loved it, but had no way of knowing it would stick with me for months, years. And this one is richer: Pallett has leaped beyond arranging for chambers and quartets, working now with electronics, with drums, with electric bass, with the Czech Philharmonic, with Nico Muhly. These are pop songs through and through-- lively, propulsive ones. But the wonder of them is in those arrangements, which are just ripe with motion and detail-- and they're not decorative (as was sometimes the case with Ys), but central. The most immediate track here, ""Lewis Takes Action"", has Pallett singing grand, anthemic hooks, but the parts you're most likely to wind up humming are the stately brass and woodwind figures between them-- the amount of care and pleasure in these arrangements is extremely generous. If you're wondering who ""Lewis"" is and what sort of action he's taking, well, this is one of the things that's just singular and fascinating about Pallett, every bit as much as his music-school voice or the charmingly mannered way he approaches his melodies. On He Poos Clouds, Pallett seemed to be singing about real people, even ordinary ones; it was just that they tended to describe their emotional states in the grand terms of Dungeons & Dragons magic and conjuring. Since then, Pallett's jumped fully into fantasy: These twelve songs are monologues from Lewis, an ""ultra-violent farmer"" in a world called Spectrum, as he tries to come to grips with his own creator, Owen Pallett. Daunting as that might sound-- there may be hand-to-hand combat with a cockatrice involved-- all it really means is that these are songs about power and faith and control: songs that allow you to sing lines like, ""the night is split by the whistle of my amber whip,"" and have it be about feeling your own power, or just repeat, ""I'm never gonna give it to you,"" and have it be about rejecting someone else's. You'll have to get back to me in a few months to see how it all unravels, but in the meantime these songs are steadily revealing ever more to love. Martial drums and strings rumbling tense in the foreground with clouds of strings overhead. The sly, soulful melody of ""Oh Heartland, Up Yours!""-- something that feels new in Pallett's repertoire. A kind of orchestral motorik beat on ""Tryst with Mephistopheles"". The way something like an 808 kick drum loops its way darkly into ""Red Sun No. 5"". Hints of Kurt Weill. This stuff is rich with ideas, and they're offered in the kind of rich, warm sound that should be accessible to more fans than ever before. Those of you with the inclination to pick them up will find a lot to reward you.","After several releases as Final Fantasy, Owen Pallett makes his debut under his own name, and it's his grandest and most assured statement to date.

Eddy Current Suppression Ring / Primary Colours,Eddy Current Suppression Ring,by: David Bevan,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a7b913d19756521394ad/1:1/w_160/2d55524d.gif,2010-01-14 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13667-eddy-current-suppression-ring-primary-colours/,Goner,"The four members of Eddy Current Suppression Ring all worked for a vinyl pressing plant outside Melbourne, Australia. Six years ago, as their company Christmas party wound down, the four began jamming drunkenly together. They'd never penned a song or been in a band. Impromptu frontman Brendan Suppression simply ad-libbed lyrics into a tape recorder. Somewhere in there, more than just chemistry took hold. They settled on one questionable band name, an electrical circuitry term that also yielded three individual monikers: guitarist Eddy Current, drummer Danny Current and Brendan Suppression. Bassist Rob Solid held out. They released a spate of 7"" singles on their own with relative ease. Then they unleashed two mighty full-lengths that until recently have never been available outside of their native Australia at the same time. Both are primal slabs of minimalist guitar music. The ""M"" word might conjure images of bands falling anywhere between Wire and the White Stripes. While it's easy to detect notes of Wire, ECSR have developed an economy of sound that relies less on spiny riffs and more on an instinctual use of space. Within the clatter of each three-minute blast, Suppression is given the room to do just what he did during that Christmas party, not so much diarizing as slobbering each thought as it arrives to him. In ""Cool Ice Cream"", he screams for ice cream/sex over some guitar coiling and motorik bass, the end product a lot like a cuddlier, less creepy version of the Fall. And like the thrust of the Stooges, another easy reference point, that sexual drive (or template, really) lives and breathes in the dynamics as well. ""Pitch a Tent"" marries the same ideas to mangier soloing. When ECSR are at their best, they're working around an insistent groove, building before finally collapsing to saddle up again seconds later. There's little variation, but there needn't be. Even when the songs butt heads with one another, the melodies are pure comfort food. There isn't a weak song in the pack. The stronger record by a hair, last year's Primary Colours is a very natural, even artfully polished extension of its predecessor. The DNA remains the same, just married with less hitches. As ""Memory Lane"" opens with nearly identical chopping, Suppression makes a difference by slowing his roll. Always dynamic, he presents himself here as an insightful drunk rather than just a drunk. Take the way ""Wrapped Up"" runs along some really beautiful ribbons of guitar melody for instance, Suppression going so far as to harmonize the equally warm refrain. ""Colour Television"" hits harder and with more menace than anything they've done yet, but there's a softening of edges taking place throughout, a band testing limits after having already refined them. Current in particular is able to dictate the climate, forcing the band out of the garage and suggesting they never go back.","Australia's promising young garage rock band finally has its two best bits of minimalist guitar music issued in the States.

Fabric 48,Radio Slave,by: Tim Finney,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a7aab1335d7bf16990d7/1:1/w_160/b5c821a2.jpg,2010-01-14 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13791-fabric-48/,Fabric,"From late 2006 to late 2007, the slow death of minimal as the dominant movement in European house and techno seemed like a positive thing. During this era, producers creatively applied the various brands of insectile precision and druggy torpor they'd perfected in tracks with warmer, more organic-feeling sound design inspired by various moments in early 1990s house, not to mention ethnodelic touches ripped from world music of all stripes. The conventional wisdom is that this halfway house between the old futurism and the new traditionalism had been creatively exhausted within about 12 months of its emergence, but it's easy to confuse and conflate a swell of copycat tracks with a bottoming of the creative well. In truth, this sound had barely scratched the surface when trends shifted to a somewhat stultifying brand of straightjacketed house and techno classicism. Admittedly, it doesn't help that so much of this warmer ""deep"" minimalism got a bit, well, bad, with artists deploying African chant samples or tepid bongo performances with a grim air of necessity. It's almost comforting, then, to find that Radio Slave's mix for Fabric sounds almost like a tribute to 2007, in the best sense. Here's a reminder of when this sound seemed filled with promise, with its near-seamless blend of lush, hypnotic minimal-into-house, endlessly percolating synth patterns, and softly clanking percussion. Of course, it's not like Radio Slave could have done differently: having spent the last couple of years making of himself the go-to-guy for infinitely patient, mind-altering house, the dude (real name Matt Edwards) suddenly reforming himself as a U.S. deep house disciple would have seemed particularly tasteless. As it is, the producer's decision to remain true to his initial aesthetic (and that of his label, Rekids) is an excellent outcome, offering a precarious extension of life for a sound that in some ways has suffered from a premature creative foreclosure. Of course, the reasons people would eye-roll over such a prospect are present and correct: As you might expect from a guy whose own tracks can be so long and repetitive, where the only options left are ecstatic meditation or total coma, there are times when Fabric 48 gets a little, well, dry and desiccated. Nina Kravis's ""Pain in the Ass"" is the kind of hyper-minimal bleep track that everyone would ignore if not for the (not even terribly compelling) detached female monologue over the top-- typically, it's one of the best-known tracks here. Likewise, if there's a point to the unrelieved kickdrum pound of the following track ""Balada Redo"" by DJ Boola, I'm missing it. But maybe these moments are necessary. Perhaps the asceticism of Edwards' approach gives the flashes of color and melody just that little bit of extra luster needed to push them over the top. So the horn samples on Brothers' Vibe's ""Platter Sugar"" sound celebratory rather than merely diverting, while the rolling piano and scintillating percussion of Michel Cleis' remix of Spencer Parker's ""The Beginning"" can seem near-life-changing. Part of Edwards' talent and skill is that his negotiation of the narcoleptic and the arm-waving actually intensifies the highs rather than simply subjecting the listener to unnecessary lows. Michel Cleis reappears late in the mix with the marvelous (relative) anthem ""La Mezcla"", its trilling flute line and layered Spanish vocals providing what would be the set's peak if it made sense to think of it in those terms. The tune-- catchy, inventive, ""deep"" (not just in the sense of ""deep house"", but in the sense of bewitching layering, each listen allowing you to catch some new nuance)-- is a telling reminder that this particular sound was never about simply slapping a bongo pattern on top of a 10-minute groove anymore than minimal was ""about"" fashioning rhythm loops out of the sound of cockroaches fornicating. Rather, it's about the delicate interplay between old and new, between flesh and metal, between solipsistic drug taking and vicarious global tourism. More simply, it's about interplay in itself, and the fact that sometimes music on its way from one place to another can be much more exciting and, well, fun, than music that's arrived at its destination. I won't mind if Edwards remains creatively stuck for a little while longer.","Radio Slave's blend of lush, hypnotic minimal-into-house is almost like a tribute to the sound of 2007, in the best sense.

Damon Gough's debut as BDB, The Hour of Bewilderbeast, arrived back in 2000, winning the Mercury Music Prize (besting out, among others, fellow Mancunians Doves, who play on the record) and introducing Gough's shambling musical persona, one that veered radically from hushed pastoral folk to scattershot rock. He followed the strong debut with the impressive soundtrack to About a Boy, which found Gough increasingly focused while embracing his inner Harry Nilsson. But by Have You Fed the Fish?-- and this was still only 2002-- Gough seemed to be running out of creative steam. The personal, dour One Plus One Is One didn't turn things around, and the dull Born in the UK failed to deliver as well. So: it's back to the well with Is There Nothing We Could Do?, Gough's return to the world of soundtracks, specifically ""music inspired by the motion picture The Fattest Man in Britain,"" a British TV movie starring Timothy Spall as the titular big man. Gough proved himself adept at spring-boarding off the work of others before, and the same holds true this time around. Bobbling between songs, themes, and snatches of dialogue, Gough captures the right tone of wistfulness and sensitivity in his typically pretty tunes-- melancholy croon-and-swoon chamber folk and pop with an emphasis on upright bass and piano. As with About a Boy, instrumental cues seamlessly rub against more traditional songs. And although most of us can only imagine how well Gough's touching tracks fit the film, he conveys a healthy mixture of sad and hopeful captured in cuts such as the title track, the gorgeous ""Welcome Me to Your World"", ""Just Look at Us Now"", ""Wider Than a Smile"", and ""I'll Carry On"", songs so winningly winsome they survive being recycled again and again across the set as incidental cues like ""Guitar Medley"". In the end, the repetition actually serves to heighten the sense of Is There Nothing We Could Do? as some sort of song cycle, although the cynical may note that fragments such as ""Been There, Verified"" would work just as well for the average anonymous advert. But what is a record if not ultimately an advertisement for the artist at hand's particular talents? Listened to as such, Is There Nothing represents a bit of a return to form. While only time will tell if Gough can keep up the good work, fans waiting for a sign of his former self can rest assured the qualities that made his music so appealing the first time around remain pleasantly intact and, thankfully, no longer dormant.","The former Next Big Thing dusts off some of his long-dormant qualities for this appealing soundtrack record.

Funtown Comedown,Bonny Billy and the Picket Line,by: Stephen M.

Does he cackle to himself when critics note every name change or parse every reference to darkness and light? For someone who maintains a steady stream of releases, Oldham remains elusive, impossible to pin down. Take his latest, a live album titled Funtown Comedown, released digitally and on vinyl with little fanfare during the final days of 2009. As the story goes, he recorded it in the ""metaphysical community"" of Funtown, which lies just outside the Louisville of the mind. One presumes the hamlet appears in the mist annually and exists solely to host Oldham's shows. If Oldham didn't make good music, we might laugh right back at him. But for nearly 20 years, he has proved not only prolific but indefatigable, always ready with a quick hook and a dark thought on mortality and music. Funtown Comedown pulls from every corner of his rich catalog, spanning his first EP (opener ""Ohio River Boat Song"") through his recent peaks (""The Glory Goes"", from 2008's Lie Down in the Light). This being an Oldham release, these aren't simply run-throughs of familiar songs. He studiously avoids redundancy by constantly reinterpreting and reinventing his songs. Here, he resets them in a string-band context, courtesy of the Picket Line. Louisville's the Picket Line accompany him with a ramshackle sound and a hootenanny dynamic that fit his ramblin' songs nicely. The spry performances make some of the studio versions sound dour by comparison, as the musicians punctuate the songs with shouts and hollers. They actually howl like junkyard curs on ""Wolf Among Wolves"", and whoop it up on the clap-along closer ""Idle Hands Are the Devil's Playthings"". Cheyenne Mize plays Loretta Lynn to Oldham's Conway Twitty, harmonizing sweetly on ""We All Us Three Will Ride"" and ""You Want That Picture"". Oldham has duetted with so many female singers over the years, from Scout Niblett to former Frente! frontwoman Angie Hart, but Mize makes a dashing foil for him, with a wry, crystalline tone to counter his grainier, hangdog voice. (They released an under-everybody's-radar EP last year on Karate Body Records.) The Picket Line kick up the dust on the first set, delivering a stormy take on Ralph Stanley's ""Hemlocks and Primroses"" complete with raucous call and response, but they quiet down a bit on the second set. Cleetus Redundementia's bass makes a comfy bed for Oldham and Mize's vocals on the soft, subtly sinister ""Lay and Love"", and Pork Chop's ""outta-tune banjo"" snakes through the ruminative ""Rider"" (these are the names listed on their MySpace, so don't blame me). As with most of the current crop of string bands, there's a strong Appalachian feel to these new interpretations, as if the musicians have modeled themselves after the Carter Family. But they shoot these songs full of classic Nashville country flourishes and Kentucky bluegrass filigrees, and their Bakersfield licks light up their cover of Merle Haggard's ""Rambling Fever"" and ""May It Always Be"" like fireworks. This is Oldham's flip-side America, where regional distinctions and variations compress into one sound.

Campfire Songs,Animal Collective,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a7dac0084474cd0c0cbf/1:1/w_160/e0e03645.jpg,2010-01-14 06:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13818-campfire-songs/,Paw Tracks,"When the newly reissued Campfire Songs first came out in 2003, there was no such thing as Animal Collective. After releasing two albums of warped noise-pop under different combinations of weird names, Avey Tare, Panda Bear, Deakin, and Geologist were still learning how to integrate their distinct electro-acoustic preoccupations. The ""Animal Collective"" brand was later affixed to it, but Campfire Songs was originally intended to be the album's eponymous title. In truth, it's more appropriate. It's not simply that they hadn't picked a name; they really weren't Animal Collective yet. This was before the ""Letterman"" appearances and spectrum-wide media interest; before they became the object of hit pieces and big-picture rants in the trenches of online journalism; before Deakin wanted you to help him play Mali-- basically, before Animal Collective got about as formidable, culturally and aesthetically, as a modern indie band can be. This release retroactively stresses how hard they must have had to push to get there. It was the only time they used the name ""Campfire Songs"", and the album has other peculiarities. It's the only one featuring this exact line-up (Geologist didn't play, only ran the MiniDisc recorders, on the Maryland porch where the five songs were captured in one long take.) It's much more acoustic than electro, made chiefly of intertwined voices, softly droning guitars, and light natural ambiance. It's an uncommonly easeful entry into their catalog, and an important pivot. The feeling of discovery that attends it is not incidental. ""Congregate,"" they moan portentously on ""Moo Rah Rah Rain"". The album sounds like a careful group of musicians on the verge of figuring out what they are. As such, it lacks the authoritative veneer and durability of later records, from Sung Tongs onward. If you'd have said, based on this album, that these guys would be a cultural bellwether in a few years, people would have thought you were nuts (or at least massively stoned). It's difficult now to conceive of Animal Collective without vigorous rhythms, vibrant electronics, and a certain formality to their arrangements of chaos. But in retrospect, Campfire Songs already contains many essential elements that would come to define the band: Glowing vocal harmonies, the fearless use of negative space, the little snips and grafts that always temper their naturalism. The music also illustrates the drift away from masculine beats and toward sensual waves that has been indie music's prevailing current in recent years, as rock influences have lost ground. The ghosts of 1960s psychedelia and British folk haunt the vocal and guitar techniques at times, but this sound was in no way trembling on the verge of broad accessibility. They would take it there with sheer resolve, by broadening their ambition and stretching their comfort zone. Beyond its canonical interest, Campfire Songs has its own charms. Though rigorously composed, it feels deceptively spontaneous. The atmosphere is both inviting and severe, and startlingly vivid. It's difficult to argue that it's among their best, but it could easily be your favorite, because its allure is so simple and pure. You can feel the crisp air outside where they are recording, and it feels inescapably like nighttime. It's very much like sitting by a campfire, with a hot face and freezing back. While the album's impact is limited on a song-by-song basis, it has a powerful cumulative effect. It plays out with all the surges of inspiration and subtle modulations of mood of a mushroom trip or whatever kind of spiritual journey you favor, through the scraps of Spanish guitar of ""Two Corvettes"" and the shimmering ""Moo Rah Rah Rain"". The trip is beautifully completed with full-bore pastoral ""De Soto De Son"", where day breaks at last. It's the perfect cap to the record, not just aesthetically, but symbolically. Birds twitter, waking up with everything else, and the tape hiss really does seem to brighten. There's a total sense of calm, renewal, a journey completed, knowledge refreshed. Normal time resumes, and for the conglomerate creature now known as Animal Collective, it's time to get to work.","Animal Collective's transitional 2003 album, recorded in one long take on a porch in the Maryland woods, is reissued on their Paw Tracks imprint.

Low Tide Digitals III,Luigi Archetti & Bo Wiget,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6945e6ef95969320d90/1:1/w_160/8953577f.jpg,2010-01-13 06:00:04,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13569-low-tide-digitals-iii/,Rune Grammofon,"Low tide is a time of revelation: Bits of driftwood, seaweed, and shells form a cryptic record of the immense forces that arrayed them. Bo Wiget and Luigi Archetti could not have picked a more apt metaphor for their ongoing collaboration. They work exclusively in rubbish-- scraps of treated cello, guitar, and mandolin; layers of low-hertz tone and fizzing treble; sculpted interference; asphyxiated frequencies-- which their improvisational rapport turns into treasure. Their music possesses a sense of disclosure: These compositions feel like the exposed edges of vast, submerged things, soon to slip beneath the surface again. Ten years into their learning curve as a duo, Wiget and Archetti have gotten so good at listening to each other that their music feels telepathic. Low Tide Digitals III is the product of two minds operating as one, pursuing common goals with empathetic tension. Currents of severe modern classical, harsh noise, and ambient music pass in a fluid back-and-forth, like a comfortable but tendentious conversation between old friends. Both musicians are out-music veterans: Archetti, an Italian based in Zürich, was a member of Krautrock band Guru Guru, and Wiget, a native of Switzerland, has collaborated with many secret-stars of improv, like Taku Sugimoto. Their experience means they never have to rush or force anything; they close in on coherent themes with measured, effortless strides. An undulant pulse ties the pieces together, and each one is distinguished by its unique 3-D shape and finessed timbre. ""On ""Stück 26"", Wiget and Archetti gently dissect a glassy cluster of notes, gouts of dark matter spilling from the incisions. ""Stück 27"" is a huge onrushing shape, like a freight train bearing down in the darkness. The organic and electronic aren't grafted together; they're fused. Prickly strings melt into torrents of mechanical sludge, or shed pitch-bent droplets that swoop out into powerful arcs, or just flex and then roar. Wiget and Archetti exploit timbral overlaps to make noise and melody work in tandem. Or actually, more like negate each other-- social constructs like classical and experimental, organic and electronic, pretty and ugly don't appear to pertain in the private world of Low Tide Digitals III, an ocean built for two.","Out-music veterans continue their decade-long collaboration with an album of severe modern classical, harsh noise, and ambient music.

A Parallax I,James Husband,by: Rob Mitchum,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a72d9d034d5c69bf3718/1:1/w_160/f81ef751.jpg,2010-01-13 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13690-a-parallax-i/,Polyvinyl,"James Husband has haunted many Elephant 6-related liner notes, helping out with recordings by reserve-team E6ers Great Lakes and the Essex Green. But it's been his tireless work backing the perpetually touring Of Montreal that has put him most in the public eye, even if it involves laboring thanklessly outside the spotlight as the most normal-looking dude among Kevin Barnes' glam maelstrom. Now that Husband is the name on the marquee, it's tempting to interpret his solo debut through the lens of the band for which he performs sideman duties. Look at A Parallax I in that light, and you can find fragments of Of Montreal's genetic material all over the place-- some overdubbed choir-of-Husbands harmonies here, a schizoid synthesizer symphony there. But where Barnes has evolved his style to a point virtually unrecognizable from the band's basement psych-pop origins, Husband shows himself to be more of an Elephant 6 traditionalist, steeping his music in Syd Barrett and Love and other late-1960s paragons. Those classic Elephant 6 days were always marked by the inconsistency that tends to accompany a surplus of ideas, and Husband remains faithful to that element as well, alternating between moments that are rewarding and frustrating. The album gets off to a shaky start with the grating synth tone of ""Little Thrills"" and the mismanaged ""A Grave in the Gravel"", which wastes the album's best riff with clunky lyrics (spoiler warning: it's a pet's funeral). In other places, the unevenness accentuates the positive-- the chorus of ""Waiting on Rayne"" is as good as the clock-reading verses are irritating, and ""No No Baby"" takes forever to get going, but the synth fantasia at the end makes it worth the journey. When everything really clicks on A Parallax I, Husband sounds less like his tour boss than another indie rock icon, Guided By Voices' Robert Pollard. Husband is a clear admirer-- a bonus covers EP that comes with the record is one-third GBV-- and the best songs here faithfully recreate the early days of the Guided By Voices catalog. It happens first on ""Elephant Alibi"", a song whose title even sounds like a Pollard tribute, and you can hear Husband asking for liberal use of the reverb knob at the offset. That mid-fi warble, so similar to the early Sandbox or Self-Inflicted Aerial Nostalgia era of GBV, nicely infects ""While the Boys Went Down Under"" and ""Take the Train"" as well, giving both a hazy, homemade warmth that's a good fit (or less charitably, disguise) for Husband's straightforward vocals. Call me old-fashioned, but it's a pleasant sacrifice of fidelity that makes Husband's songs more charming, even if some drift off into the haze (""Gray Scale"", ""The Darkestness""). Husband may struggle to get out from the shadows of his influences or his employer-- call it the sideman's curse-- but A Parallax I is a throwback to a handcrafted indie sound where ideas go a long way to offset a lack of identity.","Of Montreal member and frequent E6 collaborator releases a solo debut full of fragments of his day band's genetic material.

Judy Sucks a Lemon for Breakfast,Cornershop,by: Eric Harvey,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a7c8b1335d7bf1699110/1:1/w_160/ca5987fb.jpg,2010-01-13 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13813-judy-sucks-a-lemon-for-breakfast/,Ample Play,"Sure, the late-1990s version of global alt-pop is weak compared to the current peer-to-peer-fueled, M.I.A.- and Vampire Weekend-populated stuff. But tell that to my carbound Case Logic between 1996 and 1998, which at the time felt like its own Model UN meeting. Cibo Matto, Cornelius, and Buffalo Daughter fueled my fascination with Tokyo's short-lived Shibuya-kei scene. Air, Daft Punk, and London-based Stereolab taught me that French pop culture meant more than 1960s New Wave flicks. The Score's Haitian expat hip-hop, Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan bringing Sufi to the NPR crowd-- hell, even Odelay exoticized Americana in a way that I'd never heard before. I could go on, but I'd rather not discuss Ozomatli and Buena Vista Social Club. None of that stuff cracked my head open in quite the same way as Cornershop's 1997 breakthrough When I Was Born for the 7th Time­. Tjinder Singh named his band after a bit of British racism, sang half his stuff in Punjabi-- including the snarky cover-as-cultural-reclamation project ""Norwegian Wood""-- but, along with partner Ben Ayres, loved hip-hop and Britpop just as much. Born was totally accessible (enough for David Byrne's Luaka Bop label, at least) but pre-Wikipedia, totally out of reach (Asha who?). It was quasi-political but not dogmatic, weird as shit but not ""mystical,"" sharp pop cut with extended bong-drones. Somehow, Allen Ginsberg showed up on this thing. By the time I was hooked, though, Cornershop had disappeared. Singh popped up in 2000 with the disco-fueled Clinton side-project, and the similarly clubby (and underrated) Handcream for a Generation two years later, but Cornershop's moment, like that fledgling flicker of world-weirdness in the late 90s, had more or less passed. Now that it's nearly expected for pop to have some sort of non-Western flair, Cornershop's latest LP Judy Sucks a Lemon for Breakfast feels positively quaint: Partially in comparison to its contemporaries, but partially because of the British trad-rock direction in which Singh has pushed this project. The title track, complete with a string-and-bassoon-laden arrangement, evokes Ray Davies' quirky domestic portraits with the Kinks. A cover of Manfred Mann's ""The Mighty Quinn"" induces a shrug, but the riffy, soulful (and wonderfully titled) opening track ""Who Fingered Rock'n'Roll?"" suggests Singh should play Exile on Main Street more. It's not clear whether the group embraced its rock leanings as a conservative reaction to his eclectic peer group, but regardless, the results can feel a bit light. Yet when Lemon embraces Singh's intellectual side, as well as the group's more playful and political tendencies, the album shines. First single ""The Roll Off Characteristics (of History in the Making)"" is insidiously catchy (watch the video for an instant smile)-- especially for a song that incorporates a brief spoken exegesis on the early roots of corporate globalization. Less didactic and more rock'n'roll, though, is the brief couplet early in the piece that clearly sums up the song's title: ""Winners will never be losers, and the losers will never win."" ""Operation Push"" combines a vaporous reggae rhythm and all manner of sound effects into an effervescent hybrid that simulates a walk through an open-air market (though what it says about Jesse Jackson's political coalition, I'll never know), and the ebullient fractured dub of ""Chamchu"" might be the best three and a half minutes here. A large part of why ""Chamchu"" registers so strongly is that is sounds so much like 7th Time. Considering cross-cultural musical hybridization has exponentially increased in the past decade, these sorts of ""wow"" moments are happening on an exponentially larger scale. And of course, this has also led to the sorts of controversies-- a Sri Lankan born art-school graduate making the pop hit of 2008 out of vaguely terroristic threats; an indie pop quartet regularly chastised for unironically embracing African pop-- that were stuck in Ethnomusicology seminars when Cornershop was ascendant. M.I.A. and Vampire Weekend are resented by many because, in their own way, they assume that everyone is on board with the new paradigm, and then start from there. This is exactly what Cornershop has always been so good at, and which occasionally comes through on Lemon-- expecting us to be on the same page, and feeling no need to explain anything to those who aren't*.* Much more than in 1997, we can't have enough artists with a global musical palette, wild imagination, and clever sense of humor-- and Lemon is a good start toward Cornershop's long-awaited return.","More than a decade after their peak, the UK band returns with their unique palette of perspective, imagination, and humor still in place.

Reality EP,Real Estate,by: David Bevan,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a7a65e6ef95969321021/1:1/w_160/a9d25cd1.jpg,2010-01-13 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13786-reality-ep/,Mexican Summer,"Recorded in chief songwriter Martin Courtney's apartment last Spring, ""Motorbikes"" features just one set of vocals: those of birds singing outside. Their pipes line the instrumental opening track of Real Estate's Reality EP, a quick end-of-year release that's assumed physical form just one month after the New Jersey foursome released their first (and equally loose) full-length. Weird then that a band known for taking its sweet time on tape seems to have rushed to share even more. But according to Courtney, the Reality EP is more a step toward starting 2010 fresh-- delivering songs either written or recorded too late to be included on their LP. Not surprisingly, not a lot separates the two releases sonically. If anything, Courtney's songwriting has relaxed even further. ""Motorbikes"" is anchored by Alex Bleeker's strolling bass line, while Matt Mondanile and Courtney's guitars are still plenty submerged. The racket from the titular motorcycles buzzsawing through the airspace outside the apartment that day never harshes the mellow. It's a moment that successfully bottles up the porch-swinging splendor of Real Estate's tie-dyed indie rock. But, notably, ""Motorbikes"" is the only track here on which all the band's members play together. With the added exception of ""Saturday Morning"" and Etienne Duguay's drumwork on highlight/closer ""Dumb Luck"", the rest of the Reality EP is the sound of Courtney working alone-- writing, recording, playing every instrument himself, harmonizing, jaaaaamming. Real Estate songs are often mood pieces, and this set sounds much more the product of a melancholy young man ruminating on his own than any group trip to the beach. On ""Basement"", Courtney stretches his guitars over shakers, letting them yawn and sigh to sweet effect. It's become a live staple and for good reason: Despite the lyrical tug inwards, its structure and melody are wide open. The same can't be said for ""Drum"", a circular, minor-key ramble that's languid enough to sound positively clenched at times. The Mondanile-penned ""Saturday Morning"" is distinctly his own: a phaser pedal-ed paean to simple pleasures that in a way is spiritual kin to Girls' Christopher Owens' lyrical prism. Just without words. And as is the case in his Ducktails work, Mondanile's guitar licks here are at once misty and syrupy, a curtain of repeating textures that often sound like harp more than a Fender. Though it sounds and feels very much like the brainlight of another guy at the wheel, it fits. Real Estate may be Courtney's vehicle, but his bandmates speak a similar language.","Real Estate cap their fruitful first year with a collection of new songs-- many of which are the solo work of chief songwriter Martin Courtney.

The Fame Monster,Lady Gaga,by: Scott Plagenhoef,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a7d1b1335d7bf1699129/1:1/w_160/75982b73.jpg,2010-01-13 06:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13823-the-fame-monster/,Interscope,"Remember that ""Simpsons"" Treehouse of Horror where the Krusty the Clown doll was trying to murder Homer? Turned out the problem was the doll had a switch on its back set to ""evil"" and with a flick of the wrist, it could be reset to ""good."" It feels like sometime late last summer, someone flicked a similar switch on Lady Gaga. For about a year, she was nothing but a lot of talk and a badge-- only without the badge. She filled her résumé and interviews with style icon namedrops-- Andy Warhol and his notions on celebrity, the denizens of New York's downtown arts scene, and avant couture designers like Thierry Mugler-- but her singles betrayed none of the artistry that she insisted was part of her package. ""Poker Face"" had about three big hooks, but next to her other singles-- which ran the gamut from forgettable fluff (""Just Dance"") to ""Muffin Top"" (""LoveGame"")-- it seemed like a fluke. Then, between the VMAs and ""Paparazzi"", she came into her own. And on ""Bad Romance"", the lead single from The Fame Monster, she became kind of awesome. The rest of The Fame Monster-- out late last year, while we at Pitchfork were wrapping up our 2009 content-- isn't as strong as its lead single (although the Queen-like ""Speechless"" comes close), but it at least stakes a claim that Gaga is a potential new Madonna rather than simply a new Katy Perry. If I had to guess, I'd say once she became hideously popular Gaga was able to take more control of her career, the early result being ""Bad Romance"", arguably the best pop single and best pop video of 2009. And the video is part of the package: Like Madonna or Prince, it's impossible to separate the song from the performer. But unlike those artists, Lady Gaga isn't particularly attractive, and she uses this to her advantage by suppressing her vanity and making herself a slippery figure. She's still largely unknowable and also almost unrecognizable from moment to [#script:http://pitchfork.com/media/backend/js/tiny_mce/themes/advanced/langs/en.js]|||||| moment, as she contorts, disguises, masks and maims her face and body like a Matthew Barney or David Cronenberg creation. Gaga comments on fame as she becomes more famous: It's in her record titles-- The Fame, The Fame Monster, ""Paparazzi"", ""Beautiful, Dirty, Rich"", ""Starstruck"". It's also in her wearable art, and the way she deconstructs her own look-- rigid, robotic dance moves as if she's a puppet on a string, moving in crutches after being damaged by her outsized fictional celebrity in the ""Paparazzi"" clip. In ""Bad Romance"" she alters whoever Lady Gaga the Pop Star might be into any number of female types-- at times recalling Britney Spears, Madonna, an Anime character, Angelique, Christina Aguilera, and Amy Winehouse. In that sense, she's a perfect 21st century pop icon-- a regular person willing to manipulate herself into whatever it takes at any given moment to be a star. And yet, unlike the empty famewhores climbing atop the shoulders of reality TV and tabloid journalism to notoriety, we know next to nothing about her personal life. In that sense, she's the anti-Kanye, the anti-Eminem, and the anti-Winehouse-- the twists and turns of her private life don't inform her art. Rather, she is whoever she wants to be at any time, and her art is as much the manipulation of that image and notions of modern celebrity as it is music or fashion. And it's refreshing to have a big pop star communicating to us from afar, like pop stars used to. Everything about ""Bad Romance"" is big but oddly clean and direct-- whooshing synths, jarring rhythms, and stratospheric choruses. It's not an earworm so much as something designed to just take over a listener, to force them to pay attention the way Gaga's image seems to have done to people in recent months. Sure, the choruses were also skybound on ""Poker Face"" and ""Paparazzi"", but they seemed bigger by working as a counterpoint to other elements of the song-- the odd way Gaga makes her voice go deep and guttural, the terrible sing-speaking she has ideally abandoned. ""Bad Romance"", on the other hand, has two volumes: 10 and 11. In that sense, it's almost template breaking-- reminiscent of stadium house with Gaga as a new KLF, fucking with us from the inside. (No surprise that it sounds so European either-- it comes across like futurist pop music without any hints of hip-hop's influence.) Elsewhere on The Fame Monster, she morphs into other stars-- Freddie Mercury on ""Speechless"", ABBA on ""Alejandro"", Madonna on ""Dance in the Dark"", Britney Spears on ""Telephone"", Kylie Minogue on ""Monster"", and Christina Aguilera on ""Teeth"". Yet instead of hopelessly retro, it comes off very modern, in part because U.S. pop and hip-hop is currently drawing heavily from Europop, hi-NRG, and dance music. It's almost as if we're experiencing a sonic present that's whitewashed most of the influence of backbeat sample-based hip-hop-- from Kanye and Cudi to Jason Derülo and the Black Eyed Peas, it's all presets and synths and dance. All of a sudden, Eminem's claim that ""nobody listens to techno"" seems like a hell of a long time ago. Where a lot of The Fame felt like rote pop with overt ""comments"" on fame, Gaga's recently acquired actual fame allows her interactions with an audience to become a theatrical experience. Her music, meanwhile, has become subtler, more playful, and more well-rounded, extending the electro-pop bubble she lived in on her debut. And instead of shoehorning references to celebrity into some tracks, she's borrowing elements and templates and simply focusing on quality control. The weird result is that, despite her flitting between personalities and personas, her music feels more like her own here than it did on her debut LP. The songs feel like they were written for Lady Gaga rather than simply for any modern pop star. Whether Gaga can keep up the streak is another matter. Maybe she'll get chewed up and spat out in the end, or maybe her chameleonic image changes are just Madonna's career at the speed of the Internet era and we're seeing all of her ideas at once. But all of a sudden, for a brief time at least, she's the only real pop star around.","Lady Gaga's second record, containing ""Bad Romance"" and ""Speechless"", finds her coming into her own as both a songwriter and a pop star.

Eggs,Oh No Ono,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a7ac5e6ef9596932102e/1:1/w_160/156976c1.jpg,2010-01-12 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13792-eggs/,Friendly FireMorningside,"There's a backwards-looking quality to many of Denmark's biggest indie exports. Figurines and Alphabeat play garage rock like it still has something to prove. Efterklang and Mew look back even further, as if striving for the breathtaking sweep of medieval Scandinavian epics. Both of these tendencies collide in Oh No Ono, who crystallize all kinds of 1960s moon-fluff into chipper psychedelic pop. There are bold indie rock songs nestled in the volcanic special effects and choice arrangements. Oh No Ono's 2008 debut album, Yes, emphasized grooves, like Junior Senior with more Strawberry Alarm Clock than Jackson 5 influence. Eggs plays down the dance beats, favoring slashing guitars, dry vocals, and stereophonic razzmatazz instead. For the detail-oriented listener who doesn't mind androgynous singing, it's a treasure trove of baroque trivia; a Ripley's Believe It or Not! museum of sound. Marvel at the intricate pitch and tempo bends of ""Eleanor Speaks""! Thrill to the impossibly detailed musique concrète bridge of the Stereolab-ish ""Swim"", where birds chirp, a coin drops and clatters to a stop, something rips, and water pours, each conspicuous yet on-rhythm! On headphones, it's like Avatar in 3-D: You aren't always sure what the hell's going on, but you don't care because you're so immersed in the wraparound mayhem. For an ""odyssey of sound""-type record, Eggs is admirably song-focused, and divested of any but the tastiest excesses. The timbres are varied, the melodies are broken into shards, and the drums primed for holy war-- yet all of this serves to accentuate strong through-lines, not to disguise their absence. Tower-of-light synthesizers dot ""Icicles"", throwing the rest of the song into shadow. ""The Wave Ballet""'s choral vocals confidently reach a soaring Broken Social Scene-style culmination. Throughout, the heavily treated vocals, often blended cunningly with computer-y blips and distortions, supply some genuinely catchy moments amid all the arch orchestration, especially on full-throttle rockers like ""Helplessly Young"" and ""Miss Miss Moss"". Still, this isn't the kind of stuff you're going to walk around humming. It's too weirdly shaped to really abide in you-- you have to be willing lose yourself in it instead.","This Copenhagen band seems to specialize in volcanic sound effects, but it manages to write some pretty compelling songs along the way.

Gonna Work Out Fine,Untold,by: Mike Powell,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a78d13d1975652139438/1:1/w_160/4326e2e9.jpg,2010-01-12 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13770-gonna-work-out-fine/,Hemlock,"At 6:30 a.m. on August 8th, Jack Dunning-- a producer and DJ who goes by Untold-- tweeted, ""Chirpy Heathrow passport officer: 'that was a short holiday' me 'I was djing' him 'what sort of stuff do you play?' me 'I dont know anymore.'"" Dunning has released six singles in the past two years, all sparse and aggressive, all tough to categorize. I always feel like I'm tiptoeing past sleeping parents when I write about dance music, which is one of the reasons I've come to love his singles-- it's easy to imagine people who really like dance music feeling slightly confused by them, too. Part of what makes his records hard to predict is that they draw on styles that don't usually end up together. There's no real regard for historical consistency, either-- something from the 80s bashes up against something contemporary before being swept away by something they'll play on the mothership after the flood. His tracks sound full in scope, but never cluttered-- most of them have only three or four things going on at any one time. That's part of his talent: He balances fluency with austerity; he knows which details bring depth and which distract. The other part of what makes his records hard to predict is that he beats half his sounds unrecognizable. The combination-- a cut-up sense of history mixed with self-conscious innovation, at least on a level of sound design-- makes for tracks that are uniquely dissonant. (It's also inspired a lot of silly efforts on my part to try and verbalize what these sounds do: they suck themselves in, they flip, they fizzle and smoke, they're coming from inside the house, etc.) Gonna Work Out Fine, a new EP of six tracks, is the longest and most abrasive set he's put out yet. The minimalism in his style comes off as hyperconfidence-- about half the time, he leaves the work of the kick drum to percussive bass sounds (""drums are for pussies,"" he tweeted in June). There are no ballads or showy climaxes. The atmosphere is tense and claustrophobic, but there's always an element that lets a little steam out-- on ""Gonna Work Out Fine"", it's a corny record-scratch sound effect; on ""Stop What You're Doing"" (whose remix, by James Blake, was one of my favorite tracks of the year) it's a set of big, airy chords that unexpectedly wash over the mix and then vanish. Dunning self-identifies as a dubstep producer, but his music doesn't feel like it's pushing dubstep forward as much as exploding it. If you haven't inferred the caveat that this is hardcore dance music, well: this is hardcore dance music. But if you read this website, you-- the hypothetically curious listener-- are accustomed to recommendations of Ethiopian Jazz and doom-metal, so I don't know why Untold would seem especially foreign. Whether Untold ""has something to offer a community of listeners outside the dance music world"" or some other such BS, I'm not sure-- at this point, I'm probably too interested in some contemporary dance music to say. Then again, it's records like Dunning's-- and everything he's released on his Hemlock label, and the new directions of now-older labels like Hyperdub, and the varied post-dubstep sounds of guys like Mount Kimbie or Joy Orbison-- that have made me interested to begin with. In a recent interview with Resident Advisor, Dunning said, ""At the moment, I want to make people screwface, shout, dance weird.""

Huntsville International,G-Side,by: David Drake,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a7c613d19756521394cb/1:1/w_160/74052189.jpg,2010-01-12 06:00:02,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13812-hunstville-international/,,"G-Side's Starshipz and Rockets LP was strong because of its rappers' humble honesty, but mostly due to the Block Beataz production crew, a team unafraid of re-imagining trance music as a soundtrack for a lonely southern stoner rather than as club anthem fodder. Follow-up LP Huntsville International doesn't feel quite as risky, but in some ways it's much stronger; where the rapping on their former record occasionally felt overwhelmed by the beats' epic emotionalism, ST 2 Lettaz and Clova sound more confident, stretching out over an impressive breadth of tracks and incorporating increasingly notable guest stars like 6 Tre G and Yelawolf. The group has also managed to sidestep the trance-rap tag that had become their signature, deftly avoiding gimmickry by maintaining a creative M.O.: keep things interesting. The record's most uncomfortable moments, in fact, pander to their niche; the kind of local-fanbase details that have made regional rap so evocative because of its specificity feel strangely self-conscious when rappers are shouting out bloggers and the interludes are drops from Europeans. This post-Internet internationalism feels like a hollow, awkward interaction for artists who otherwise seem so rooted in place. That said, even when they try some novel production tricks, like the spiraling EQ effects on ""What's It All About"", the first half of the record feels musically adrift. Aiming unsuccessfully for the grandiose on ""So Gone"", where the production can't quite match the rapping's all-conquering spirit, doesn't really justify its dramatic pretense. It isn't until ""My Aura"" where the full breadth of the album's stylistic playfulness really takes off; the single dances with the classic Dungeon Family tension between irreverent enthusiasm and an unwillingness to be less than genuine. ""College Chicks"", similarly, is a southern rap club track in the vein of 2009 anthems like 6 Tre G and Boosie's ""Fresh"" or Young Problemz's ""Boi (I Got So Many)"", but with the kind of lighthearted goofiness that lets a rapper pull off Auto-Tune this many months after ""D.O.A."" was D.O.A. Moments later, the group flips System's timeless R&B slow jam ""Don't Disturb This Groove"" into a sparkling mini masterpiece. None of these maneuvers are exactly unprecedented; part of what makes this work so well is the Block Beataz's dedication to details, the unwillingness to let a loop just be a loop. But more than that, it's the group's aw-shucks bravery, a willingness to subvert convention without making much of a big deal about it at all, that is so intriguing. The ability to take a fresh look at older approaches is most readily apparent on ""Who's Hood"". The Block Beataz take one of rap's most famous samples, originally flipped by one of the genre's most critically-beloved producers, and let it exhale into backyard southern wistfulness. It's the kind of trick that gives the entire record an aura of modest awe. At this moment, G-Side are a niche group, but more than ever this describes much of rap music. After so many years of billboard domination, hyperbole comes to rap fans easily-- after all, we're always arguing over who's the best-- but G-Side are artists who thrive in a world of decentralized discourse, who don't transcend their audience but who can upend the expectations of even the most jaded rap heads, if they give them a chance.","Underdog hip-hop group manages to expertly reimagine trance as a soundtrack for a lonely southern stoner rather than as club anthem fodder.

Fela: The Best of the Black President,Fela Kuti,by: Mike Powell,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a702b1335d7bf1698f66/1:1/w_160/f14708c5.jpg,2010-01-12 06:00:01,Global,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13660-fela-the-best-of-the-black-president/,Knitting Factory,"There's a diner in central Virginia called the Blue Moon that used to play a Fela Kuti compilation what seemed like every Sunday morning for at least a couple of years-- something I mention because it's how I first heard his music and how I remember it best: Over and over again, at a decent volume. His recordings are defiantly samey, but his style is unmistakable: the horn-head/solo structure of American and European jazz applied to funk; 12-minute songs that seem to start somewhere in the middle; lots of congas, lots of honking. Something like the Nigerian James Brown, sure, but also a little like Monet's series of haystacks-- each iteration a little different but disciplined in their similarity, always some minor variation on an ideal. So while two straight discs of Fela is exhausting, it's probably the most suitable way to digest him. I can't say that Black President (which is exactly the same as MCA's out-of-print The Best of Fela Kuti) contains all of Fela's best material-- he has too many records, and they've only been sporadically available on CD. (Knitting Factory, by the way, intends to reissue 45 of them over the next year and a half.) What I can say is that his music is so intense and consistent in mood that lesser tracks in his discography just make themselves obvious-- they don't appear hypnotized by the sprit; they lack energy. In 2006 I tried to listen to 20 Fela albums in a row and came to two conclusions: For the most part, his best songs had already made it on compilations, and that compilations best convey the full brunt of his music. There's also the issue of consumer value: Most of Fela's original albums featured only two tracks, each about 15 minutes, so a $20 compilation just gives you a lot more to chew on than a $12 album. Fela: The Best of the Black President isn't just a good place for someone starting out, it's probably the only Fela album many will need to own. True, some of the songs are edited, but if you need the full 15-minute version of ""Gentlemen"" instead of the 11-minute one, then the Best of is probably not for you in the first place. Fela changed the course of funk, African music, and almost anything groove-based that came after him, but it sometimes seems like his contributions to music in general are more interesting than actually listening to his music in specific, or that the sum of his work is more exciting than any particular set of songs. It's like seeing the forest but missing the trees, or being in love with the idea of love. Or like a complaint I remember being attributed to guitarist Arto Lindsay when he was in the no-wave band DNA: That people either loved or hated them, but never talked about which songs worked or didn't. This might be a personal opinion, though-- I also find it hard to actively enjoy James Brown after two hours. At a certain point I just become passively reverent, and have a suspicion that other people do, too, unless they're dancing. (This prompts the question of Fela's utility in scenarios facilitating human propulsion to rhythm. He's useful.) His biography is even more sellable-- and more bullet-point friendly-- than his music: twenty-seven wives, a commune/recording studio for his band members and family, an actively hostile relationship with Nigeria's military government. The African rebel. Even if you don't like his records, take the time to watch Stephane Tchal-Gadjieff and Jean Jacques Flori's 1982 documentary, Fela Kuti: Music Is the Weapon-- a real testament to the power of an artist as a political figure (quaint, I know). All to say that he's an outsized personality; a person who stands for an idea-- an icon, I guess. ""They cannot kill me, because my name is Anikulapo,"" he says in Music Is the Weapon-- an adopted middle name meaning, roughly, ""he who carries death in his pouch."" Fela's political lyrics usually forsake subtlety for immediacy, but I find it easy to forgive him-- the soldiers who threw his mother out the window after a raid on his commune weren't very subtle either. After she died, Fela dragged a coffin to one of the army's central barracks and wrote a song about it: ""Coffin for Head of State"". His music is feverish, urgent, and simple, but it reflects on simple evils: Corruption, subjection, brutality. Of all verbs commonly used to try and convey music's intensity, I prefer ""boils"" for Fela's-- nothing abstract, just a matter of excited molecules banging against each other to produce a state simultaneously sustainable, dangerous, and transformative.","With a full reissue campaign coming-- and a show in his honor on Broadway-- Fela's re-examination year kicks off with this comp.

VH1 Storytellers,Kanye West,by: Scott Plagenhoef,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a7c713d19756521394ce/1:1/w_160/aa799886.jpg,2010-01-12 06:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13821-vh1-storytellers/,Def Jam,"The producers of ""VH1 Storytellers"" must have thought they'd struck gold when Kanye West agreed to appear on the program. He was already responsible for four (and soon to be five) of the most WTF/OMG live TV moments of the decade: crashing Justice at an awards show (Taylor Swift would come later), his ""SNL"" freestyle, his Grammys performance, and of course, the famed Hurricane Katrina benefit. But VH1 wound up with too much of a good thing, or too much of a jaw-dropping thing: West's three-hour set had to be chopped to 90 minutes, including commercials. On record, it's all over in a little more than an hour. If you've ever seen Kanye live, you know what sort of stories he tells. There are no long intros explaining the hidden meanings of his songs, or where his life was at the time he wrote them. That would be unnecessary anyway, since his bio is already so entwined into his music. Instead, Kanye delivers monologues in the middle of songs. It's less storytelling and more golden age of entertainment-type stuff, like Sinatra or Garland holding court over an audience: Here's an anecdote, here's a joke, here are some inspirational words, here's what happens to be on my mind at this very moment. Dude should have had a highball in his hand. He was already wearing a bowtie. Live, West is an entertainer and a perfectionist-- a bang-for-your-buck guy. Those at this taping presumably got their money's worth, but other than the few excised morsels that leaked after the show (a long anti-Radiohead screed and a defense of Chris Brown's attack on Rihanna), we don't know what was cut. Alas, those who pick up this record get an abbreviated, neutered version. I understand the impulse: The people behind the album aren't looking to entertain us; they're looking to create a salable product. (A need that no doubt caused this to be released more than a year after it was recorded-- they were still working 808s and Heartbreak back when this was taped.) However it may have played in the room, breaking down a song in order to ramble doesn't make for a compelling at-home listen. The tracks here, from 808s in particular, are well chosen-- especially underrated ones like ""Say You Will"", ""Robocop"", and ""Heartless""-- even if the album versions are vastly better. But hearing them here did make me think again about that record and hardened my belief that it will ultimately sit in West's catalog as respectfully as his first three LPs. Really then, screw the songs. A better record-- albeit not a great product for those fronting the money-- would have been just the monologues. And why stop there? Why not about a best-of Kanye speaks: a Having Fun With Kanye on Stage, like the famous LP that collected clips of Elvis Presley talking at, rather than singing to, his audience. Hell, he's inching toward it already: 808s ended with ""Pinocchio Song"", a long monologue, and then he released this Storytellers disc. Remove the talking from each, balloon it to an unreasonable, audacious, bloated level, and you've got something worth hearing at least once. Granted, the highlights there might have still been the highlights here: West grappling with his old homophobia; West again explaining how badly he wishes he could experience his own live show; and the part in ""Amazing"" in which we don't get to hear him defend Chris Brown. What we do get is him saying Michael Jackson and Michael Phelps are amazing, to audience approval, and then that O.J. Simpson is also amazing, to stunned silence. Live, this section was apparently more drawn out, but on record the edits create an unintentional WTF moment when you realize Phelps is there for his transgressions rather than his accomplishments: ""Oh... he's equating a bong hit with allegations of child molestation and double homicide. Huh."" On the whole, this is another example of West trying something new, willing to risk looking foolish, and reacting to the twists of turns of his life in an honest way. It's what makes him equally refreshing and frustrating. Sure, when these impulses are channeled into his more reckless blog posts or stage crashes, it makes him look like an ass. I don't care about Swift's feelings any more than I cared about Justice's-- it was just some funny shit that makes West one of our only entertaining pop stars-- but picking on a teen girl was a breaking point in the court of public opinion, and if that affects his music, I ultimately care about that. In the end, I'd trade the sideline antics that bother people for a continuation of the serious winning streak this guy is on musically. It's possible, though, that you can't have the one without the other: Like he said in ""Touch the Sky"", his wrongs help him write songs. And his songs are awesome. Just not when they're broken up by long, one-sided conversations.","This live set finds Kanye inserting rambling monologues in the middle of his songs, not so much storytelling as a bizarre string of WTF asides.

Movies Is Magic,Klimek,by: Joe Colly,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a7be9d034d5c69bf388c/1:1/w_160/33f00bde.jpg,2010-01-11 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13806-movies-is-magic/,Anticipate,"Though he records under several different aliases, Germany's Sebastian Meissner is probably best known for his work as Klimek, his ongoing ambient-techno project that's been released on a handful of labels, most notably Kompakt. He's a regular on that imprint's annual Pop Ambient compilation but moved a few years back to New York's Anticipate for his full-lengths, starting with 2008's heavily processed drone suite Dedications. The final track on that record, ""For Steven Spielberg & Azza El-Hassan"", explored cinematic sweep and the notion of film music as home listening, and with his most recent release Movies Is Magic, Meissner applies that idea to an entire LP. A high-concept piece, Movies Is Magic deals directly with the transportive nature of movie music, its ability to enhance a visual experience or add depth to a story. In some sense it's a film score without a film, and how much you buy into the academic narrative behind it-- the album comes equipped with a lengthy essay, penned by Meissner, detailing its relationship to the writing of Slovenian film theorist Slavoj Zizek-- will likely impact what you take away from its songs. Each of the record's tracks, which range from anxious, slow-moving ambient pieces to pastoral modern-classical drifts, seem built with an imaginary movie sequence in mind, and some are more successful than others at conjuring the feeling of losing yourself in a dark cinema.
*
Movies Is Magic* is unlike a good portion of ambient-techno records in that it mostly eschews the genre's usual vaporous bliss in favor of much gloomier tones. It's dark and cold and the prevailing sentiments are menace and dread. (One gets the sense that if Movies Is Magic were actually a film, it would look something like Let the Right One In.) But Klimek does his best work in these shadowy areas, on songs like ""Abyss of Anxiety (Unfolding the Magic)"", a glittering drone number wound tight with tension. These ominous moments overlap with his attempts at visual storytelling, and though not always successful, it's easy to hear in the rolling drums and Morricone-referencing arrangement of ""Pathetic & Dangerous"", for instance, that Klimek is setting the stage for a spaghetti western-style shootout. If there's a central problem with Movies Is Magic, though, it's that it feels too much like a film score and not enough like an album. Which is to say that some of its tracks sound like background music, good in a supporting role but without the weight to stand on their own. That's true with ""A Lament"", which comes across slight and transitional, and the pleasant-but-forgettable ""For Whom the Bells Toll"". These uneven moments put on display the record's overemphasis of concept, and perhaps worse, keep Klimek from enchanting his listener in the way the best movies can.","Kompakt vet Sebastian Meissner explores cinematic sweep and the notion of film music as home listening on his new LP.

Rejoicer,Grooms,by: Matthew Perpetua,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a7a7b1335d7bf16990d1/1:1/w_160/f97048f9.jpg,2010-01-11 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13787-rejoicer/,Death By Audio,"Slowly but surely, but as if on a carefully calibrated cultural schedule, the aesthetics of guitar-driven 1990s indie rock have been coming back into style, gradually supplanting the 80s revivalism that dominated the past decade. This is great news if you grew up on this sort of thing, and even better if you've come to the point that you'd rather have your ears drilled than hear another new band that could be described as ""angular."" Grooms, a New York City-based trio previously known as the Muggabears, have been ahead of this curve for some time now, playing arty, Sonic Youth-derived rock music for several years to modest blog acclaim. Grooms have never been tremendously charismatic or distinctive, but they are thoughtful, skilled musicians who excel at building intricate compositions that come over as loose and casual. While fellow New Yorkers and 90s rock torchbearers Cymbals Eat Guitars shoot for the moon with ambitious epics like ""...And the Hazy Sea"", Grooms go to a far more relaxed zone with their churning chords and tangled arpeggios. The music is dramatic and potentially crowd-pleasing, but the songs sound like the work of a band that has long since stopped caring about anyone's pleasure but its own. Nevertheless, the wonderful thing about Rejoicer, the band's debut under the Grooms name, is that it's not actually insular and closed-off.  There's an obvious thrill in the way the band members connects with one another, locking into grooves and following one another on tangents, and that transfers over to the listener. It all seems very composed and refined, but the best moments come out sounding like spontaneous epiphanies, and you can just imagine them nodding to each other approvingly across their rehearsal space as they snap into particularly exciting sequences. At times, the musicianship gets ahead of the songwriting. The opening number ""Dreamsucker"" is a revelation -- dynamic, hooky, energetic! -- but the discipline on evidence in that song is lacking on less engaging tracks like ""Ghost Cat"" and ""She-Bears"", which both lean too heavily on drone and ambiance. Atmosphere is not exactly the band's strong suit. They come up with some nice noises and textures, but those sounds are far more effective when they bring character to melodic and rhythmic motifs, as on ""Thumbs"" and ""CJ"". Rejoicer is a quality album with some especially strong tracks, but as much as it is refreshing to hear a relatively young band nail sounds from a previous era, the record is more enjoyable than it is interesting. Sure, you could sit around dissecting it, figuring out what bits are more Sonic Youth, or more Dinosaur Jr. or Helium or Polvo or Gastr Del Sol, and on and on, but you'd have a very hard time isolating what makes this music distinctly Grooms-ian. The band have made a significant leap on this album as musicians, hopefully they will soon find their voice as songwriters.","New York's Grooms, formerly known as Muggabears, ably and enjoyably channel the spirit and sound of 1990s alt-rock and indie.

The Voidist,Imaad Wasif,by: Paul Thompson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a7bb5e6ef95969321054/1:1/w_160/fb6af482.jpg,2010-01-11 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13804-the-voidist/,Tee Pee,"Nearly everything you'll read on Imaad Wasif will lead with something or other about his work with the Yeah Yeah Yeahs, the New Folk Implosion, Alaska!, what have you, and this one's no exception. Trust that there's a reason for it; not only are Wasif's hired hands steady and limber no matter the situation, but over the course of a couple of solo albums, Wasif hasn't done much to distinguish himself from the impressive company he's kept. With The Voidist, however, Wasif's made a nimble, grandiose album all his own, one that feels like a move towards his own spotlight. Whereas his texture-heavy previous solo work has often felt a bit shy of things like, er, songs, The Voidist is a relatively grandiose affair, drawing on the widescreen sound of 1990s Radiohead and the more ambitious later Led Zeppelin stuff. But despite its outsizes ambitions, The Voidist feels deeply personal and intensely focused, the epic construction of its tracks tempered by the economy of their arrangements and Wasif's hypnotic, Jeff Buckley-indebted voice. From the swarming brood of tone-setting opener ""Redeemer""-- ""I got a bad mood that precedes me,"" Wasif confides, not that it wouldn't be apparent from all the solemn yearning that follows it-- to the ruddy, thunderous closer ""Razorlike"" (jokin' on Johnny Borrell, is he?), the dynamic, deliberate Voidist contains multitudes. Though Wasif's come a long way as a songwriter, his axework is still very much at the center of Voidist; the slate grey of his tightly wound tunes colored over by sharp shocks of neon from his guitar. It's easy to picture Wasif on the cover of some gearhead rag, seven-stringer in hand, but Voidis**t's more than just a fix for tone junkies. The easy ballast of bleary, very *Bends-*y ""Priestess"" does a whole swath of Jonny Greenwood acolytes a few better by keeping things simple, while the meandering folk-pop of ""The Hand of the Imposter (Is the Promise of My Own)"" and ""Her Sorcery"" feel deceptively complex, revealing more and more over time. Highlights abound, but it's the beyond-""Kashmir"" of the back half of ""Return to You"" that serves as the elliptical Voidist's centerpiece, a slab of shoestring-epic bombast that marks the perfect collusion of Wasif's cosmic craving and newly-honed prosaic prowess. There were times throughout Wasif's prior solo work when it seemed the center couldn't hold, but each tune on Voidist feels intricately mapped out around this highest of high points. Wasif's a slightly inscrutable lyricist, heavy on the hankering but without much indiction as to the source of said languish. As such, while it's easy to fall under Voidist's spell, its meanings can be a little tough to parse; one pictures Wasif staring off into the middle distance, seeing things words aren't always apt to describe. That feeling of being held at arm's length persists no matter how much time you put in with Voidist, and it's the record's only significant shortcoming. Still, one presumes with a little more time adjusting to the light, Wasif will open up a bit; for now, it's plenty just to sit and listen to T**he Voidist unfurl.","Yeah Yeah Yeahs sideman finally makes a nimble, grandiose album all his own, one that feels like a move towards his own spotlight.

The Burrprint: The Movie 3-D / The State vs. Radric Davis,Gucci Mane,by: Tom Breihan,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a7ad9d034d5c69bf3867/1:1/w_160/1bc30b71.gif,2010-01-11 06:00:01,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13793-the-burrprint-the-movie-3-d-the-state-vs-radric-davis/,,"In March 2009, Atlanta rapper Gucci Mane came home from prison after serving six months for violating parole. Then, in November, Gucci violated again and went right back to prison for another year-long bid. That means Gucci only had about eight months of freedom in 2009. In that time he still managed to release, by my count, six mixtapes (including the three-in-one-day Cold War series) and one official album. He also found time to crank out an absurd number of guest-verses, videos, and live shows, buried a long-raging feud with Young Jeezy, and made minor stars out of proteges OJ Da Juiceman and Waka Flocka Flame. Along the way, he became rap's most divisive figure, with the internet peanut gallery lining up to call him everything from a borderline-retarded grunter to rap's last, best hope. If you followed rap in 2009, you had to have some opinion on Gucci. He had quite a year. For the uninitiated, Gucci is a tough sell. The sheer volume of his output means there's no go-to entry point. He delivers all his lyrics in a marbled monotone so thick that his lyrics can be hard to make out on first listen. He never highlights his punchlines (or anything else, really); they just float by. He favors one simple, monotonic type of beat: a tense, sproingy, synth-based thing that always just sounds cheap. He raps way, way more about his cars and jewelry than anything else. Over time, though, those liabilities become strengths. Because he mushmouths his punchlines so hard, you have to listen harder and more often to hear them. And it certainly helps that his punchlines are often dizzily funny and inventively intricate: ""Popping Cris, think that I need Alcohol Anonymous/ 45 in the club, I could kill a hippopotamus."" His deadpan is great for ""wait, did he really say that?"" reactions. And even if his actual delivery rarely varies, he has some bottomless number of actual flows; he attacks the beat differently on every verse, putting inflections and pauses in unexpected places and still always finding the beat's pocket. His unrelenting focus on materialistic shit rarely rankles because he's better at rapping about that stuff than just about anyone else. Both his monochromatic beats and his staggering productivity give his work a sense of immersion, hitting the same note again and again with immensely satisfying results-- like a daylong sick-day binge on James Bond movies. And with Gucci, there's also a sense of shared experience. People are listening to this guy; he's not just another voice in the internet echo chamber. He's ascended to a very particular type of cult stardom in an age when rap stars aren't supposed to exist anymore. He's found his audience by elevating ignorance to expertly absurdist art, thus making his 2009 a worthy successor to Cam'ron's 2004 or Lil Wayne's 2005. He's been on a very, very serious roll. The October DJ Drama collaboration Movie 3D: The Burrprint remains the greatest of Gucci's 2009 mixtapes, in part because it's the purest example of his aesthetic. This is wheelhouse Gucci: Drug- and money-talk over simple, eerie Casio beats with no crossover attempts and almost no guest spots from rappers outside Gucci's close-knit camp. Gucci's boasts and put-downs are playful but matter-of fact throughout: ""You are not the owner of that car that is a loaner/ I got money stacks that's tall as you cause that's just my persona."" Even when he's describing crack houses in detail, he keeps telling jokes and making up goofy metaphors. There's one song about turning down ugly groupies and another about how he has to hang out with his shadow because he's so far beyond everyone else. The members of his inconsistent 1017 Brick Squad crew all nail their verses on the trio of posse cuts. But the mixtape's greatest asset might be its sneakily melodic sensibility. Gucci's delivery has a casual singsong elegance that you never quite see coming, and the result means virtually every chorus is memorable-- something unthinkable from almost any other rapper. And since Gucci almost never raps over other people's beats, that means you're getting an hour's worth of full-on songs, something that not even Cam and Wayne offered during their peak-era runs. You'd think that instinctive ear for hooks would convince Warner, Gucci's label, to let him do his thing unencumbered on the official album, The State Vs. Radric Davis. But lead single ""Spotlight"", a tone-deaf Usher collab that keeps exactly nothing of what makes Gucci likable; it had people doomsaying before the album ever came out. Mostly, though, the LP does a good job keeping Gucci's culty selling points intact on a larger stage. Regular collaborators Zaytoven and Fatboi turn in several beats each, and many of the other tracks, from name producers like Jazze Pha and Scott Storch, sound a lot like Zaytoven beats. Big-name guests like Wayne and Cam bring their A-games because they know they're dealing with a rapper on their level. Most importantly, Gucci maintains his singular weirdness throughout. He keeps finding unexpected ways to say the same stuff: ""I be runnin' gunnin' stunnin' with a hundred killers riiiiiidin'/ And you snitchin' bitchin' tattle tellin' and scared to stand besiiiiiide me."" He says some stuff that barely makes sense: ""Eat rappers like Jeffrey Dahmer/ Dope color Sinead O'Connor."" He has one song about wearing all-yellow everything and another where guest crooner Bobby Valentino offers to fuck you in front of your father. He sings the chorus of Amy Winehouse's ""Rehab"" mid-verse. There are a few missteps, like the run of mid-album R&B tracks that saps some momentum. But the LP has a energy rare to major-label rap efforts. Like Wayne's Tha Carter II, it translates Gucci's mixtape triumphs into something more digestible and immediate. Of course, the album came out when Gucci was back in prison and sold way fewer copies than expected. Gucci's detractors took the opportunity to declare his regional stardom a grand illusion. Those detractors should take a good, hard listen to the late-album track ""Worst Enemy""-- a rare introspective moment where Gucci extends something resembling an olive branch to Jeezy and frankly discusses his own self-destructive tendencies, all without compromising his dense, frantically hopscotching sense of wordplay. So: When he feels like it, Gucci can talk about serious matter with the same infectious verve that he uses to call your jeweler a loser. Artistically, at least, he's just getting started. And now that he's going to be locked up for a while, the world has a chance to catch up.","Underground rap's biggest breakout of 2008-09 finally releases his major-label debut; plus, a look at the best of his many recent mixtapes.

It's like they've spent the past two years building a bionic version of the band-- not only brighter and tighter, but weirder. The group nurtures its eccentricities and the result is a record full of them: Ezra's stretchy, dynamic voice; Rostam's fussy but colorful arrangements, packed with lots of orchestral confetti; and a sound that spans an increasingly multicultural array of genres, from American synth-pop to reggae, ska, calypso and Afro-pop. By comparison*, Vampire Weekend* sounds monochromatic and restrained. In terms of vanguard indie bands, this makes them more digestible than Dirty Projectors but also more exciting than the relentlessly sophisticated Grizzly Bear. But Vampire Weekend also outsold both those bands. Their music was optioned for major-motion-picture soundtracks. They played Letterman, and Letterman didn't passively mock them. Ezra Koenig sang with Fucked Up. Later, they were in Vogue. They're a cross-cultural, cross-generational new indie band. Contra's most sellable song, ""Giving Up the Gun"", is more polished than Vampire Weekend's, but its many stranger ones are more imaginative than anything on their debut. Considering Contra is only their second album, they're in an enviable position: Semi-popular and sincerely idiosyncratic. Contra works because of its juxtapositions-- of natural sounds to processed ones; of manners to tantrums; of party rhythms to deadpan poetry; of black music to white music. ""Diplomat's Son"" samples M.I.A. and features an 8-bit interpolation of Toots and the Maytals' ""Pressure Drop"" amidst characters getting stoned and falling asleep in unfamiliar houses. Almost every song on the album is this rich and this delirious. And for listeners with an aversion to richness or delirium, the band still plays sweet melodies with a light touch. Vampire Weekend's willingness to take cues from a variety of styles makes them thoughtful musicians, but it's the styles they draw from that makes them contemporary. Ezra Koenig once said that his clean guitar tone was a reaction to being force-fed grunge as a preteen, but he was also entering puberty when No Doubt was entering the charts, and when ska-- a sound that originated in Jamaica and became working-class British music in the 80s-- became a renewed phenomenon at teen centers across the New York metro area. Rostam Batmanglij's side project, Discovery, was an R&B album made on synths and sequencers-- which, by 2009, was another synonym for ""indie rock."" Adopting what they adopt and rejecting what they reject might make Vampire Weekend look like pretenders, but they're not-- they're reactionaries. Then again, these contradictions, passions, and superficialities are what the band seems to be thinking about-- and what Koenig has gotten sharper about writing into his lyrics. These lines don't scan as being about privilege or money, but about people struggling with their social status, something that everyone-- college-educated or not, rich or poor, people who hate Vampire Weekend and people who don't-- does at some point. (Though, as Pitchfork editor Scott Plagenhoef pointed out in 2008, the band's detractors probably wouldn't be nearly as hung up on Ezra's lyrics if the people in Vampire Weekend's songs-- or the people in Vampire Weekend-- seemed poor.) Ezra isn't writing about college or Northeastern geography anymore (terrific), but the loud nouns are still there. Take ""California English"": ""Sweet carob rice cakes, you don't care how the sweets taste/ Fake Philly cheesesteak but you use real toothpaste/ 'Cause if that Tom's don't work, if it just makes you worse/ Would you still lose all of your faith in the good earth?"" In other words, what if all the products and symbols that gave your life meaning-- and status-- fell away? What if you replaced the organic toothpaste with Colgate? (Which still ""says something"" about you, namely ""I don't have the time, inclination, or money to give a shit about toothpaste."") Would life still look as rosy? Or, roughly, ""Who gives a fuck about an Oxford comma?"" These aren't ad-copy platitudes about the irrelevance of image-- if image didn't exist, he'd have less to write about. His point is simple: Image is important, but don't think yours is better than anyone else's, especially if it's constructed by things you buy. If Koenig has pity, it's for people who don't accept who they are off the runway, like the guy in ""Taxi Cab"": ""When the taxi door was open wide, I pretended I was horrified, by the uniform and gloves outside of the courtyard gate""-- the key word being ""pretended."" For a band as superficially calculating and antiseptic as Vampire Weekend, the message is a challenge to accept that these guys-- these very polite young east-coasters who grew up with ska, punk, and African pop-- are exactly who they say they are. The album ends with ""Diplomat's Son"" and ""I Think Ur a Contra"", its two most musically scattered and lyrically opaque songs. ""Diplomat's Son""-- of the aforementioned M.I.A. sample and reggae breakdown-- is six minutes long; ""Contra"" fades to the sound of hand drums and acoustic guitars. On an album marked by ambitious, knotty lyrics, Koenig ends with the lines, ""Never pick sides, never choose between two, but I just wanted you, I just wanted you."" Commitment. Surprising, but it looks beautiful on them.","The divisive Vampire Weekend return with LP number two, and Contra finds them embracing their eccentricities without shame or apology.

An Exaltation of Laarks,Laarks,by: David Bevan,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a76bea9e61561daa55a5/1:1/w_160/607d8aaf.jpg,2010-01-08 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13743-an-exaltation-of-laarks/,Absolutely Kosher,"Laarks' Brian Moen wails on a drumkit that's more than 70 years old. That's amazing. At the time his instrument was crafted, our country hadn't yet experienced Pearl Harbor. As grim retrospectives are still stacking up, it's still weird to look back on the 2000s as a time defined in any way by Kid A or Is This It as much as towers falling or bubbles bursting-- most of the time it felt as if our popular culture was detached and separate from the actual realities of our times. Laarks, a foursome from Northern Wisconsin, seem to have sifted through the past 10 years of sound, homing in specifically on 00s indie rock moments that somehow feel increasingly distant. Perhaps even more than 1990s indie touchstones do at the moment. An Exaltation of Laarks, the band's debut LP, neither pushes any envelopes nor changes any games. It is, however, a well-crafted document of a time period we're still in the process of digesting. As opener ""What God Hath Wrought"" kicks things off over some synth and sleigh bells, everything feels both deliciously familiar and weirdly dated. Frontman/keyboardist/head songwriter Ian Jacoby's papery yelp is a near dead ringer for that of the Promise Ring's Davey van Bohlen (also a fellow a Wisconsinite) just as Kyle Flater's lead guitar hook is yanked straight out of a Killers single. Though the synthetic/organic bent is a little overdone at times, the gap traversed between those two reference points is comforting in a geeky, sincere kind of way. There's a lot of fun to be had in picking out Laarks' influences track by track, layer to layer. The first few seconds of ""The S Stood For Science"" maintain a whir and thrum that's pure Broken Social Scene. Couldn't be anyone else. Minutes later it charges into a stomach-churning coda with shades of Death Cab for Cutie at their most taut. Interpol? Yeah, they're in there, too. Let's face it: None of this would require repeated listens were the melodies non-existent or the execution flat. But these songs have great energy. Though Laarks have re-assembled ""indie"" parts and atmospherics moms can now recognize, they've done it all with a fizz and punch that's clearly their own. Moen (formerly of Eau Claire heroes Amateur Love and DeYarmond Edison) is an absolute mammoth with drumsticks in his hands and gives every number real verve, no matter the volume, vibe, or tempo. ""Where Do You Wanna Live?"" in particular showcases a fantastic stretch in which he swaps out a drum machine for his own rolls without so much as a seam. And although Jacoby tends to pickle some areas of the record with hiccuped synths (""You Know They Do"") and Win Butler-like vocal ticks better off avoided (""Telephone""), he lends that same song a real sense of place, politely repeating, ""Tell me where you wanna live? Milwaukee or Eau Claire? Tell me where do you wanna live, when you grow up?"" It's a moment of searching, of looking afield. Into the future.","Absolutely Kosher band creates a well-crafted document of the 2000s, a time period we're still in the process of digesting

It's not overly declarative or pushy-- in fact, there's a feeling of uncertainty in its delivery that asks you to step back for a minute and give the statement a fair once-over. For a San Franciscan four-piece that churns out the same kind of sharp, garage-minded jangle-pop as a lot of their fellow Left Coasters, it's a perfectly reasonable defense mechanism. Of course this kind of stuff matters to people on some level, and if the Mantles are ultimately fishing for a compliment, I'll give them this: Most of The Mantles is much tighter and more athletic than stuff you'd traditionally find in this vein of late, with nearly every groove-furnished, guitar-spiked rumbler feeling more taut and refined with each listen. A lot of the talk about this band contains references to the Chills or the Dream Syndicate, and while a cursory listen will be able to dig that stuff up pretty quickly, most of the Mantles' debut packs more of a punch, as the Radio Birdman-propulsed ""What We Do Matters"" suggests. Pretty soon, the question has little to do with what matters-- they should've just had the balls to tell us that what they do is good. Most of these songs do hinge on some Paisley Underground staples, leaving C-list cuts like the wandering ""Burden"" to be forever condemned to burn in Brian Jonestown Massacre demo hell. But with most of the livelier material, it's pretty clear that the Mantles are a band with a real set of teeth. ""Yesterday's Gone"", a psych-revved splash of Motor City thrash, boorishly boosts the infamous riff from ""I Wanna Be Your Dog"" while still retaining the grit and reinforcing the groove. Shaggy opener ""Disappearing Act"" can't help but interject surf's-up guitar licks, and even on the mid-tempo ""Look Away""-- nicely padded with organ hum and a little pissed-off soul balladeering-- the song grinds to a near halt so the band can twist it into a desperate flop-around. It's these welcome spurts of primal boogie that afford some of the lighter fare an honest sense of drama. The more dangerous themes become more and more apparent at almost every turn, as the titular theme of the sock-hoppy single ""Don't Lie"" feels less like a sad-sack plea and more like some weirdly formidable domestic warning. But read too much into anything on The Mantles and you'll run the risk of missing much of the purely pleasurable moments that require little effort to realize. Even with forgettable material, like the too-aptly titled closer ""Thin Reminder"", it's hard not to just plain enjoy these breeze-kissed tunes. In that respect, it's pretty easy to understand why these small fish are asking for that tiny bit of reinforcement in their big pond: ""If you don't think so, take a good look around."" It's only natural to feel a little bogged-down by your own niche constraints, but it really matters only if what you do works. Here, the Mantles have proved they have little to worry about.","San Franciscan five-piece churns out sharp, garage-minded jangle-pop with more bite than most of their peers.

Gone: The Promises Of Yesterday,24-Carat Black,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a79d13d197565213945d/1:1/w_160/aebeab1e.jpg,2010-01-08 06:00:02,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13779-gone-the-promises-of-yesterday/,Numero Group,"Buried somewhere down in the footnotes of the story of Stax Records is 24-Carat Black, one of the final acts to record for the label before it crumpled under the weight of debt and ceased to be in 1975. Their lone album, Ghetto: Misfortune's Wealth, is a soul obscurity revered by DJs and a certain stripe of crate digger. It was an expensive record to make, and it's safe to say it didn't recoup, flopping big time on its release in 1973. One wonders if anyone, including the band's leader, Dale Warren, expected it to succeed. It's a desolate, bleak concept record about ghetto life with virtually no pop moves and plenty of sermonizing about socio-economics. Not a recipe for chart-busting. There's something very of its time about 24-Carat Black. They were a kind of loose collective in the early 1970s, a moment when the Civil Rights movement had achieved most of its tangible goals and had to contend with harder things than laws, like ingrained prejudice and systemic inequality. Ghetto: Misfortune's Wealth was a record that spoke to the moment, but unfortunately spoke to almost no one. Even as Stax foundered and his record disappeared without a trace, Warren kept the band going, recording with two different lineups (one with 13 members, the second with 14 members) for the next couple of years in an attempt to craft a suitable follow-up. He made about 20 recordings, of which only six survive today-- the Numero Group guys found them by accident, cleaned them up and sequenced them like a 24-Carat Black sophomore album that never was. From the 37 minutes of music here, Warren seems unperturbed by the first LP's commercial demise. He's moved on from the ghetto narratives and songs of struggle on Misfortune's Wealth, dipping back to reinvent a few songs he'd written for other Stax acts in the 60s and moving forward with new ones built around romantic relationships. Here he's exploring desire and heartbreak with the same ear for lonely desperation, fluid arrangements and restraint that he showed on the band's album. It grooves, but not in a dancefloor sense-- ""I Don't Love You"" has a funk-spiked jazz underpinning, with lots of lead sax to back Princess Hearn's chilly soul wail. He brings the easy soul groove of ""I'll Never Let You Go"" to a simmering climax, only to drop the rhythm for the cooing, oohing, aahing breakdown, supplying what could have been a gooey sex jam with a cold, minimal backing. It's totally counterintuitive, but it works. The singer is sultry and desirous, but also possessive and demanding-- a valediction of the fact that love gone bad can still feel uncannily good. Love's just gone bad on ""I Want to Make Up"", a desolate duet of sorts that finds the female singer sparring with a spoken male vocalist who coldly dismisses her, walking out as the song ends, leaving her with just a few spectral harmonies for company. ""The Best of Good Love Gone"" is nearly a straightforward 70s soul song, with Jamerson-style bass and great, subtle drumming, but it cops a lot from jazz and psychedelia, taking on a character of its own that's clearly 70s, but has aged quite well. The epic closer, ""I Begin to Weep"", opens with funky choral grandeur, but collapses in a heap seven minutes in, leaving vocalist Robert Dunson to wander through a landscape of droning organ, whispering and mumbling to himself as drums call out into the emptiness with repeated patterns. Warren's music could be high-concept, but unlike 24-Carat Black's one true album, this stuff is approachable on a purely emotional level. In some senses, Gone: The Promises of Yesterday bests Ghetto: Misfortune's Wealth, but the two records are ultimately too dissimilar for a direct comparison to be of much use, especially considering how few people have actually heard Misfortune's Wealth. As a sort of long-delayed follow-up, this disc delivers easily, and it's bound to please fans of early-70s conscious soul-- think Isaac Hayes, Boscoe, the Pharaohs, Black Renaissance, and even the Temptations to get your bearings. Then dive into the singular musical world of Dale Warren. It's an interesting place, even after all those years of moldering in the basement.","Buried somewhere down in the footnotes of the story of Stax Records is 24-Carat Black.

By the Throat,Ben Frost,by: Grayson Currin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a7c113d19756521394be/1:1/w_160/1c52754f.jpg,2010-01-08 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13809-by-the-throat/,Bedroom Community,"Maybe it's By the Throat, the savagery-suggesting name of the fourth LP by Australia-born, Iceland-based producer Ben Frost, that gives the album its menacing reputation. Perhaps it's the three wolves stalking its cover, the threatening title appropriately scrawled above in a slanted, action-film font. Or it could simply be the music, which doles out new anxieties with each turn: The harsh noise and dissonant strings lashing above and around the beat of ""Peter Venkman Pt. I"". Or, on ""Leo Needs a New Pair of Shoes"", where howling wolves surround and overtake the rustle of a gentle chamber ensemble. Wolves again harmonize against the screech of a violin on ""The Carpathians"". From aggressive visage to animal vocals, By the Throat is, as another reviewer said, ""dread-inducing music."" No equivocation necessary, By the Throat is a sinister album, full of moments that rattle cores with sound (play it loud) and sound effects (beware those wolves). But Frost's work is more than a hall of terrors: These vivid instrumentals, which seem menacing at first, also feel somehow triumphant when heard again-- new details becoming more crucial. By the Throat might frighten on the first listen, and it might shock by the 12th. But, somewhere in between, Frost-- both a compelling new musical dramaturge and arranger-- might just show you the silver lining of all these fears. Blending musique concrète samples with exorbitant electronic production and the guest work of string quartet Amiina and composer Nico Muhly, Frost pulls ideas from sources far and wide-- his instrumental work bears traces of radio rock, heavy metal, rap. The closing triptych moves between metal, dark-wave, hip-hop, and harsh-noise influences, cycling them all through a bustle-and-collapse template that has as much to do with Aphex Twin as it does experimental composer Anton Webern. So, if ""Through the Glass of the Roof"" first sounds like a busted jungle track, it sounds more like black metal deliverance by the time ""Through the Roof of Your Mouth"" begins. That midsection, in turn, suggests Cluster, Radiohead, and Merzbow. And when it collapses into a sheet of harsh noise, Frost restores the bassline for the finale, ""Through the Mouth of Your Eye"". He isolates the bass, slows it down and eventually lets it drift away under cover of a few shrieking string parts, again deflecting the question of what matters most. Nowhere is the push and pull between muted triumph and tempered menace more apparent than on ""Peter Venkman Pts. I and II"", named for Bill Murray's Ghostbusters character. During ""Pt. I"", a chorus of horns and voices rise and fall through that razing static, moving in uneven arcs through broken rhythms. In ""Pt. II"", though, the voices grow and overcome the noise. The horns stretch out like steady winds, sometimes foreboding and low; loops of dulcimers, banjos, and bells float over the long tones, battling through wolf growls and bass throbs to float, at last, above the horns. Frost leaves it to the audience to pick favorites and winners. Listeners often relegate instrumental music into a series of intrinsic, reductive modifiers-- a drone is meditative, you know, and harsh noise is just mean. Post-rock is cinematic and sweeping, while finger-picked acoustic guitar music is nostalgic and ruminative. Unfairly, pop songs alone get the privilege of simultaneous juxtaposition. That is, Elliott Smith and Brian Wilson can sing heartbreaking words above bright, shining music, and we laud its bittersweet complexity. But when's the last time you heard someone argue for ecstatic noise (consider Fuck Buttons) or busy drones (see Rhys Chatham's A Crimson Grail)? Probably never. By the Throat demands those kinds of complex distinctions, though. Its radiance is a dark one, and its most sinister moments lead to deliberate calm.","Australia-born, Iceland-based producer creates one of the most menacing-- and rewarding-- ambient records of the past year.

We Are Young Money,Young Money,by: Ryan Dombal,Features Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a7c3b1335d7bf1699109/1:1/w_160/44d672a0.jpg,2010-01-08 06:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13810-we-are-young-money/,Cash MoneyUniversal MotownYoung Money Entertainment,"After recording a staggering amount of verses, hooks, and hallucinogenic hiccups for three-plus years, Lil Wayne topped-out with 2008's Tha Carter III, a success on every level imaginable. And then he basically took 2009 off-- relatively speaking, at least. He still grossed about $42 million in worldwide ticket sales, released two stellar mixtapes (Hottest Nigga Under the Sun and No Ceilings), and was the subject of one of the more fascinating music documentaries in recent memory, The Carter. (I'm just going to pretend to ignore his forever-delayed dalliance into mook-rock, Rebirth, for the time being.) But without new tracks and features hitting the web every week, it did seem like Wayne was M.I.A. He had spoiled us. And that missing feeling tugged harder when he pled guilty to attempted criminal possession of a weapon in October, a blunder that could put him in a New York jail for a year starting next month, when he's due to be sentenced. These dire circumstances loom over We Are Young Money, the first album from Wayne's cobbled-together hip-hop clique-- can his pupils come close to filling the creative vacuum left by their frighteningly prodigious mentor? Crazily enough, a couple of them just might be able to pull it off. Though Puff Daddy and the Family's pioneering 1997 boomtime opus No Way Out still boasts the greatest number of contributing stars-- Biggie, Mase, Lil' Kim, the L.O.X.-- when it comes to the single-ego-fueled-rap-crew-album genre, most of the time, side players have little chance of becoming anything but. Consider the sorry track record of Eminem's D-12, 50 Cent's G-Unit, Ludacris's Disturbing Tha Peace, or Young Jeezy's U.S.D.A. Even Jay-Z's most overt clique record, 2000's The Dynasty: Roc La Familia couldn't bolster main contributors Beanie Sigel and Memphis Bleek to much past staunch regional kudos. Last decade, Cam'ron was one of the more successful kingpins, with the 2003 album Diplomatic Immunity spawning semi-careers for Juelz Santana and Jim Jones before Dipset forgot why they were great and imploded. And while We Are Young Money undoubtedly marks a career high for most of Wayne's crew, there are two contributors who have an excellent chance of jumping out from behind their teacher's shadow. Drake is already there. After smashing with lover-not-fighter anthem ""Best I Ever Had"" and sussing out the logical continuation of Kanye West's 808s and Heartbreak sound with his So Far Gone mixtape last year, the singer/rapper's forthcoming major label debut LP is the uncontested Most Anticipated Hip-Hop Bow of 2010. And for good reason-- more than competitors like Kid Cudi and Wale, Drake has the sensitivity, wit, and commercial wherewithal to create the breakout album hip-hop fans longed for, and didn't get, in 2009. His encroaching stardom probably hurts We Are Young Money as an album-- he seems to be saving his signature Auto-Hooks for the solo LP-- but his four verses act as apt teasers, highlighted by a melodic and horny masterclass on ""Every Girl"" and an anchor lap on ""Pass the Dutch"", where he boasts: ""I told you catch up, did you make a mil yet?/ I can't predict how many of 'em I can still get."" Could be quite a few. The other current YM bold face is 25-year-old Queens native Nicki Minaj. A vixen with outlandish curves and a flow that pings between valley girl sex goddess and cartoon thug, Minaj could probably carpet-bomb hip-hop mag covers no matter her skills on the mic. Thankfully, she's much more than a pair of boutique high heels and a dirty mouth-- in fact, with her five WAYM verses, Minaj is the most consistent (and consistently amusing) MC on the entire album. She's as outrageously raunchy as vintage Lil' Kim (""flow tighter than a dick in a butt"") and as randomly hilarious as, um, Lil Wayne (""Switch my name, now I'm celebratin' Hanukkah/ Lewinsky, bitches, Young Money Monica/ I been hot since Hedgehog-- Sonic, the""). Like Drake, her 2009 mixtape, Beam Me Up Scotty, was a powerful opening salvo, and-- considering recent collaborations with Usher, Robin Thicke, and Mariah Carey-- Minaj has the potential to become the first new out-and-out female rap star in years. In between appearances from Drake, Minaj, and Wayne-- who offers lukewarm verses and/or deranged-but-palatable Auto-Tune hooks on most tracks-- a slew of numbskulls, weirdos, and little kids sometimes make things interesting. On the bonehead front are Gudda Gudda, Mack Maine, and onetime Dipset pal Jae Millz, who show up a lot but have comically little to say. (Sample Mack Maine brain fizzle: ""We on some other shit/ They on the same shit/ I'm Mack Maine/ I'm Mack Maine, bitch!"") There's an awful singer (Atlanta-based Shannell), an awkward emo refugee (Tyga, who's the cousin of Gym Class Heroes leader Travis McCoy), and a couple of screechy voiced teens whose contributions are mercifully kept to a minimum. Along with its top tier talents, what keeps WAYM from slogging along is a stylistic diversity and a selection of beats that sometimes borders on phenomenal. Unlike most rap crews, YM features artists from all across the continent and not just one regional enclave, so even when the lesser lights take over, at least they don't sound exactly like each other. Meanwhile, upstart producers Chase N. Cashe and Kane Beatz keep things moving sonically, whether it's CNC's baroque, Grizzly Bear-esque (!) beat for ""New Shit"" or Beatz's bright and haughty instrumental for the hit ""Bedrock"", which wouldn't sound out of place on a Wes Anderson hip-hop movie score (not to say that should ever exist, necessarily). But reliable Southern stalwart David Banner takes best beat honors with his absolutely-evil subwoofer mulcher ""Streets Is Watchin'"". It's a shining moment from an album that signals hope for Lil Wayne's collective enterprise even during his imminent state-sanctioned breather.","In the spirit of work from Dipset and Bad Boy, Lil Wayne creates a clique record, and-- with Drake and Nicki Minaj on board-- pulls it off.

Strange Gods,Mincemeat or Tenspeed,by: Marc Masters,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a79b13d1975652139458/1:1/w_160/44079e8c.jpg,2010-01-07 06:00:04,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13777-strange-gods/,Zum,"For something so simply designed and constructed, the music of Philadelphia's David Harms-- aka Mincemeat or Tenspeed-- is pretty tricky. Harms uses only effects pedals and a mixer to make rhythms so repetitive they suggest artistic OCD. But within those parameters, he also creates impressively diverse textures. As his mono-beats roll forward, he piles on layers of gritty, tactile sound, the sonic equivalent of a character in the video game Katamari Damacy gathering sticky debris with his growing ball. In the process, Harms evokes big-beat dance, abstract IDM, harsh noise, psych-rock, even death metal, all while sticking to his simple A/B rhythms. Which is probably why Dan Deacon, another artist with a knack for mixing abstraction and structure, told Pitchfork in 2007 that Harms ""is my favorite performer right now. He is the master of his domain. More human than human."" Strange Gods definitely sounds both fleshy and mechanistic, both monotonous and body-moving. It's as if Harms grafted the squall of Prurient or John Wiese onto the pound of Aphex Twin or Mouse on Mars (that is, if they made their beats without synths or drum machines). You could also shorthand Mincemeat or Tenspeeed as a more extreme version of Black Dice or Fuck Buttons, but Harms' purism sets him apart. The first beat he picks is the one he's sticking with, and he doesn't seem to care much if you stick with it, too. Sometimes it even sounds like he wants to outlast you. That's definitely the case on Strange Gods' longest tracks, such as the relentlessly bouncy ""Hulot"", the cuttingly metallic ""Points and Lines"", and the buzzsaw warp of ""Throw Hands"". Throughout these marathons, the rhythms can get swallowed by the bulging sounds-- distortion, feedback, a high-pitched din akin to a brutal metal guitar solo. But inevitably the beat returns, stronger and more repetitive than ever. Such stubbornness may seem tedious, but there's something indelibly hypnotic about the way Harms slowly changes the sonic envelope around his oscillations. It's like watching time-lapse footage of a city skyline, as the changing light and motion color the buildings but never erase their immovable presence. Whether or not that sounds like fun, it's hard to imagine being turned off by Strange Gods, since Harms always cuts his noise with a beat that's easy to hang onto. When he lets that beat take over, like during the catchy first half of ""Padre Iscand (Colonization)"", you can easily picture him performing inside the kind of ecstatic crowd circles that Deacon often attracts. But don't count on it-- my guess is that Harms is less interested in attracting fans than finding a personal nirvana inside his endless repetitions.","Reminiscent of Fuck Buttons or Black Dice, Philly's David Harms combines heavily repetitive rhythms with noisy, thickly textured loops.

By comparison then, their issuing of Triptych (1978) and Vice Versa, etc. (1970), which have never been on CD, is one of their least esoteric, plainly noble gestures-- they're just getting the music out there where it didn't exist before. Both pieces came at pivot points in Radigue's career. Vice Versa is a tape-based drone recorded in 1970, a year before Radigue started working with the ARP 2500, a synthesizer that looks like a telephone switchboard with a keyboard and weighs about 60 pounds. For decades after, she used it exclusively. 1978's Triptych was Radigue's first full composition after dropping out of music to dedicate herself to Tibetan Buddhism in 1974. (Though she didn't leave Buddhism behind-- her works through the 70s, 80s, and 90s are not only suffused with a sense of contemplativeness and unrepentant nowness, but they're literally based on events and stories from Buddhist literature.) Vice Versa is made from tape feedback, divided into four tracks played at different speeds, the shortest lasting 2:44 and the longest lasting 13:43. The set's second disc is the same tracks, backwards. Radigue's intention was to let a listener mix and match (which is unusual given that digital technology makes this infinitely easier than it would've been 40 years ago, though this also explains why VV's first and only run was limited to 10 copies). Unlike Triptych-- or most of what she wrote during the ARP years-- there's not a lot of rise and fall to the composition. It's sensuous music; it's actually about sound. Did I play the backwards tracks against the frontwards ones? Yes, and to great satisfaction. My speakers quivered, my mind released. But while the concept behind the music is elegant, it's also the music's driving force, and it ultimately makes the piece feel antiseptic compared to what came later. [For some good, honest writing on the dilemma of music designed to be listened to in specific, sometimes inconvenient ways, read Pitchfork managing editor Mark Richardson's recent Resonant Frequency column.] Triptych, conversely, is wonderful. Radigue's music doesn't just have depth, it has narrative: it rises and falls; it dilates and contracts, utilizing pure sound rather than harmony for its development. Watching Radigue work in the studio (there's documentary footage of this), it's easier to understand how her music sounds as hand-hewn as it does: She's actually sitting there, sliding sliders, patching cables, turning dials. It's guided by human hands and feels that way-- enveloping, almost sweet. Her stopwatch, which she uses to measure the duration of tones in a piece, is nicknamed ""nounours""-- ""teddy bear."" Triptych works over long periods of time in weirdly magical ways-- 40 seconds of the piece might sound exactly the same, but skip ahead five minutes and it will sound completely different. It's subtle, but it keeps a dynamic. This is the best defense it has against listeners who might just want to say that it bores them because ""nothing happens""-- it's right there; things are happening constantly, they're just almost imperceptible. Whether or not you want this experience in your life-- of deep listening to quiet music that does more to facilitate thought and imagination than guide it-- is up to you. Like rock climbing or marriage or anything else, all avocational arguments for it are slightly moral. I don't privilege Radigue's music over other music, but I do privilege it over other music of its kind. In a recent documentary by Austria's Institute for Media Archeology, Radigue said, ""In the beginning, there was a certain music that I wished to make. It was this particular music and no other."" It's not an overstatement: Hers is a particular music, but there's nothing like it.","Important Records reissues two albums from the French drone composer, which were previously unavailable in digital form.

Young One,The Mayfair Set,by: Stuart Berman,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a7b5c0084474cd0c0c5d/1:1/w_160/0370fcdf.jpg,2010-01-07 06:00:02,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13799-young-one/,Captured Tracks,"""SWM seeks female companion. Likes: obscure mid-80s British indie, home recording, BBC docu-dramas, cryptic album art. Dislikes: having picture taken, using birth name. Not opposed to LDRs."" Mayfair Set principals Mike Sniper (aka Brooklyn bedroom rocker Blank Dogs) and Dee Dee (aka one-woman L.A. garage band the Dum Dum Girls) didn't come together through some makeoutclub.com-style online hub for lonely, lo-fi enthusiasts, but given the limited information available about this secretive, camera-shy outfit, it's as good an origin myth as any. Because the Mayfair Set's debut EP, Young One, feels very much like a relationship forged in separate bedrooms thousands of miles apart, with Sniper and Dee Dee's shared points of interest and strikingly similar M.O.s ultimately underscoring the distance-- both spatial and aesthetic-- between the two artists. If the eight songs here weren't actually conceived via FedExed cross-country cassette swaps, then great care has been taken to make it seem so; often Young One feels less like two people collaborating together in the same room than each taking turns dubbing their parts over one another's decaying demos, with faint traces of taped-over recordings bubbling up into the murky mix. If Blank Dogs' distorto-pop tends to soak Sniper's vocals in static, on ""Already Warm"" he's practically buried beneath the Earth's crust, adopting a deep, almost comical gothic warble that makes Dee Dee's corrosive coos shine like high beams on an 18-wheeler. Extreme contrast proves to be Young One's defining quality, be it the beauty-and-the-beast dynamic between the two leads on the fuzzed-out funk of ""Let It Melt"", or the way the chilly post-punk pulse of ""Desert Fun"" suddenly yields to a bright, beach-bound chorus that sells you on the promise of ""fun, fun in the desert sun,"" as if having fun amid the opressive heat of a desert sun was a plausibility for these agoraphobes. Sonically, the Mayfair Set hew much closer to the Blank Dogs' mechanized squall than the Dum Dum Girls' garage rock, but Sniper is under no illusion as to who's got the better set of pipes, maintaining a shadowy presence while Dee Dee takes control of the liquefied C86 pop of ""Junked!"" and the curious, girl-group-gone-dub showcase ""Three for Me"". But it's on ""Dark House""-- tellingly, the one track where Sniper's voice complements rather than competes with Dee Dee's-- that the Mayfair Set feels like something greater than just a casual, lo-fi lark between friends. Here they deliver a potent dose of dream-pop melancholy that conjures the surrender-to-the-sea imagery of the Cure's ""Just Like Heaven"", but grows more intense and despairing with each line-by-line trade-off. It's the moment where the Mayfair Set overcome the binary, back-and-forth quality of a long-distance relationship, and start to feel more like a natural, face-to-face interaction.","Assembling previously released material, this duo-- he from Blank Dogs, she from the Dum Dum Girls-- revels in the contrasts between their music.

ATL RMX,Various Artists,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a7b313d197565213949d/1:1/w_160/b2c48481.jpg,2010-01-07 06:00:01,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13797-atl-rmx/,Adultswim.com,"It probably says less about the State of Hip-Hop than it reads, but Adult Swim, an offshoot of the Cartoon Network, is now one of the most trustworthy names in the genre. Doubt their cred if you must, but you can't doubt their sincerity: With all due respect, you don't release Witchdoctor albums in 2009 if you're just in it for a quick buck. Beyond that, they eased in naturally since there was always heavy overlap between the fanbases of, say, MF DOOM and ""Aqua Teen Hunger Force"". However, ATL RMX departs Adult Swim's safety zone for something more controversially curatorial: something called ""Imma G (Memory Tapes Remix)"" by Dem Getaway Boyz isn't some prank along the lines of Trent Reznor's Strobe Light-- it's the actual third track here, and pretty typical of what to expect, some of electronic/hip-hop's bigger producers reconfiguring a murderer's row of Atlanta rappers who... okay, let's be upfront: If you've had a discussion with someone concerned about the obsolescence of ""lyrical"" hip-hop, I'm almost certain you got an earful about how the MCs on ATL RMX are at fault. But even if El-P and Young Jeezy are the battle lines upon which ideological wars about what constitutes ""real"" hip-hop are fought, wouldn't it be worthwhile to see if there's any crossover between each's unique and impactful take on urban dystopia? They're both really good at what they do-- it's worth a shot. But is it worth a listen? Well, ATL RMX's first track, Jeezy's ""I Got This (El-P Remix)"" bangs like crazy, but it does so in a weirdly individualized way. It takes a monster of a beat to make Jeezy sound overwhelmed, and his boasts end up as a nearly incidental sound effect under all those clip-emptying drums and enjambed female vocal interjections (this mixtape appears to exist only as a ""clean version""... that doesn't necessarily help). I'd love to hear more, but maybe if Jeezy heard the beat first? Still, ATL RMX starts out strong: DJA adds a buzzier backing track to Rich Kids' ""Patna Dem"", but it's the irrepressibly emphatic chanting that's going to sell it every time. ""Imma G"" has a strangely sweet and sour tropical taste and essentially becomes a typical Memory Tapes track by its midway point, suggesting Dayve Hawk has incorporated more hip-hop into his sound than he's often given credit for. There's also honest to god rapping from Cee-Lo. If that doesn't justify this mixtape's completely nonexistent download cost, I don't know what to tell you. But elsewhere, the remixers seem compelled to justify their existence/appearance in ways that rarely do any favors to the source material. I suppose SALEM's reverence for both Chapterhouse and Swishahouse will pay off someday, but their decision to chop and screw Playboy Tre's subdued, lyrically potent sipper's lament ""Sideways"" feels like a misunderstanding of the material at best and a joke at worst-- the last interpretation this sort of thing needs. Many have remarked upon the influence of rave music on Lil' Jon's mid-decade work, but matched up with the BPMs and sinus-eroding coke bump of Danger Beach's ""Give It All You Got"" remix, he hardly sounds revitalized or even relevant. And if HEALTH truly want to make an impact in hip-hop, they'll let M.O.P. spit flame over ""Die Slow"", because that shit knocks. Their pounding, dissonant remake of OJ Da Juiceman's ""Good Night"" should be enough to really make M.I.A. rethink boasting her upcoming album as a crit-wank fantasy of Animal Collective-meets-Gucci Mane. But even when ATL RMX fails, it represents a discussion worth having-- though OJ Da Juiceman getting booed at a CMJ showcase served as a flashpoint, it was less ""OutKast gets booed at the Source Awards"" than ""Philadelphia Eagles fans boo Santa Claus,"" an understandable reaction (it was a skinny, poorly dressed Santa/I didn't hear Pill or Curren$y getting booed) with understandable timing (the Eagles were blowing a chance to get the #1 pick, oddly enough, O.J. Simpson/it was hours into a rap show running impossibly late on a Wednesday night) that made an audience with an already hostile rep look irreparably bad. No one comes out looking good, especially in the wake where sides are too easily taken, when hip-hop is considered a zero-sum game where only one region or mindset can be ""right"" and enjoyed only for the right ""reasons."" But is it worthwhile at all to wonder if Scott Herren enjoys Shawty Lo ""legitimately"" or whether it's ""correct"" to finally give Gucci Mane a shot only because he's being remixed by Flying Lotus (or vice versa)? Hell, most of hip-hop listening these days seems to revolve around conversation anyway, so let's keep it going. Maybe next time we'll hear DOOM over some Zaytoven beats.","Free mixtape from Adult Swim pairs Atlanta's top rappers (Jeezy, Cee-Lo, Gucci) with some of today's top indie producers (El-P, FlyLo, Dam-Funk).

Gazzillion Ear EP,DOOM,by: Nate Patrin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a7b6c0084474cd0c0c61/1:1/w_160/f4b3825d.jpg,2010-01-07 06:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13800-gazzillion-ear-ep/,Lex,"After the better part of a year's worth of listening, it's not out of the question to call ""Gazzillion Ear"" the standout track from DOOM's Born Like This. At the very least, it's one of the album's most attention-grabbing cuts. J Dilla's hauntological tour of the 2000s' second half manifested itself here as a fused-together unearthing of two of his archived beats: the organ-driven psych-soul ""Dig It"" and the ""Return of the 'G'""-gone-lo-fi Moroderisms of ""Phantom of the Synths"". DOOM united those two movements with a tour de force rendition of his characteristic hookless, free-associative pop-culture cliché-disemboweling that stands up to any of the top three verses on Madvillainy. And even through the rawness, he rode on that beat so securely that even without the Dilla shoutouts it'd be a fool's errand to separate his voice from it. Not that Thom Yorke or Dave Sitek or Jneiro Jarel are fools, of course-- it's just that they have their work cut out for them when it comes to remixing this song. The Gazzillion Ear EP includes the Yorke remix that accompanied the iTunes release of Born Like This, a collaboration between Sitek and Jarel, and another Jarel mix created under his ""Dr. Who Dat?"" guise. The EP also includes the original track, largely for completion's sake, and a brief, shrugworthy bonus beat entitled ""The.Green.Whore.Net""; it's probably for the best that most people who already own Born Like This (by which I mean pretty much anyone who would already be interested in ""Gazzillion Ear"" in any context) can pick this one up piecemeal. While Yorke's remix doesn't supplant the original, it doesn't bother to try-- in fact, it doesn't even use the same vocal track. DOOM's flow on the Yorke remix is both faster-spitting and more intense, a reserved yet intimidating raspiness on some Clint Eastwood business. It's also split up, giving his lyrics some breathing room, but part of the appeal of ""Gazzillion Ear"" is that DOOM just goes nonstop, so hearing his voice drop out every so often to let Yorke's distantly twitching, wordless-murmur ambience burble for a moment sabotages the momentum. And as much promise as that skittering, icy beat holds, it sounds way too ghostly and mournful to back up a verse featuring namedrops of ""The Gong Show"" and Ernest Goes to Camp. Jarel's two contributions make a lot more sense, since they capture the lyrics' menacing/absurd split personality in their own unique language. Given the advanced age of the Yorke remix, the Jarel/Sitek teamup is the blockbuster draw on this EP, and it doesn't disappoint. They pull a neat trick of turning Dilla's lifted keyboard melodies inside out and echoing it loosely with a burbling sound somewhere between highlife guitars and late-60s analog electronics, throwing in some truncated blasts of halfway-Afrobeat brass that eventually spill out into an invigorating horn outro. But it's Jarel's other contribution that steals the show: the Dr. Who Dat? mix is boom-bap that breathes through deep, thrumming digital bass, riding on zone-out synths and hi-hats that melt and freeze into crystalline sonics. He's done something better than distracting listeners from how great the original version is-- he's provided a good reason to speculate what DOOM might sound like over more beats like this.","The standout track from Born Like This gets the remix EP treatment, with work from Thom Yorke, Dave Sitek, and Jneiro Jarel.

Chimeric,Radian,by: Patrick Sisson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a7a113d197565213946d/1:1/w_160/8fd0c95d.jpg,2010-01-06 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13782-chimeric/,Thrill Jockey,"The cobbled-together beast from Greek mythology known as a chimera should be a recognizable concept for fans of electronic music, a genre that has evolved via the repurposing, re-contextualizing, and splicing together of sounds and samples. The instrumental, electro-acoustic Austrian trio Radian has spent more than a decade as a seemingly contradictory hybrid itself. Perched between precise composition and improvisational creation, members Martin Brandlmayr, Stefan Németh, and John Norman wear their glitch-heavy, avant-garde pedigrees on their collective sleeve, making sure their songs are sculpted and pockmarked just so. But on Chimeric, they stretch out and breathe a bit more, elongating melodies and placing more accent on organic sounds, such as wisps of brushed snare drums and the vibraphones' soft echo. The band's last album, 2004's Juxtaposition, blended labored-over microtones and billowy bass; on ""Rapid Eye Movement"", Brandlmayr's taps, scrapes and brushes don't accompany as much as sync up with oscillating, mechanical screeches and tones. Chimeric is relatively looser and less dense, owing to more reliance on live interaction. While it's arguable how loose the micro-managing trio allowed themselves to become during mixing, since recordings were re-organized and spliced together as if working with a tape machine, Chimeric sounds like the product of less tense and more spacious recording sessions. The band considers the record raw, broken, and unpolished, but they have nothing to be apologetic about. By loosening up they sound invigorated. The hum of a switch being slowly flicked on and off at the outset of opener ""Git Cut Noise"" could be a gesture toward the analog and imperfect. It continues stomping forward in fitful starts, eventually picking up a caustic tone and a bass line with a slow, creeping gait. The 10-minute ""Feedback Mikro / City Lights"" indulges in a slow-burning crescendo, with interplay between a bright, churning guitar line, wavering tones, and a circular, ramshackle drum pattern. Songs like ""Chimera"" find the band occupying a more open landscape. It's a dusty plateau dotted with lonely snatches of guitar notes and sweeping cymbals, one of the many finely tuned sounds Brandlmayr coaxes out of his drum kit. In his hands, the drums seem as rich a source of textures and tones as a sampler, ranging from slow, sweeping pulses to chaotic, jagged fills. Unlike Rec.Extern and Juxtaposition, Chimeric was not recorded with producer and Tortoise drummer John McEntire. But between Brandlmayr's swirling, textured percussion and the band's more breezy approach-- compare the jazzy brushes and washes of sound on the Chimeric track ""Subcolors"" with the more taut variations on ""Rapid Eye Movement"" and ""Shift"" off Juxtaposition-- the new album sounds more informed by the trappings of Chicago post-rock and improv. That's one of the main reasons Chimeric is much more a rearranging of existing elements and past themes than a reinvention. Despite the slight advantageous shifts, it isn't the new creature its name might imply.","A relatively looser, more open approach suits the Austrian electro-acoustic trio.

The Dance Paradox,Redshape,by: Philip Sherburne,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a7abc0084474cd0c0c41/1:1/w_160/8af169c6.jpg,2010-01-06 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13802-the-dance-paradox/,Delsin,"It's hard to describe Redshape's music without resorting to the word ""classic."" Both his grooves and his synthesizers suggest an almost idealized vision of mid-1990s Detroit techno. But using the c-word still feels like a failure of the imagination. (Depending where you stand on the whole ""retro"" issue, it also might feel like an insult.) For one thing, it's hard to think of many actual Detroit techno albums that actually sound quite like The Dance Paradox, Redshape's debut album. Carl Craig's Landcruising and More Songs About Food and Revolutionary Art both come to mind, in tone and instrumentation, but they're actually very different: more diverse and probably more ambitious, but also not as focused on a single, binding mood as The Dance Paradox. Urban Tribe's The Collapse of Modern Culture (one of the 90s' finest electronic-music albums, and criminally out of print today) might offer a better precedent for Redshape's anxious, brooding, sentimentally dystopian sounds, but again-- musically speaking, structurally speaking-- Redshape's record has its own agenda. A bit like Burial, who reworked the signifiers of UK Garage into an extremely personal sound, Redshape takes the essential tropes of techno's most fertile period-- grooves fused from chugging drum machines and quicksilver drum breaks, endless arrays of synthesizers that gleam like the skyline of a dead city-- to create a unique and compelling style, one defined above all by its sensuality. True to its title, The Dance Paradox refuses to take the concept of ""dance music"" at face value. Its salient elements-- lithe 909 patterns, roiling bass arpeggios, spine-tingling synth flourishes-- come from the club, but none of its tracks run above 123 BPM, and some sink to 118 or even 108. (For a measure of comparison, contemporary house music typically clocks between 120 and 125 BPM, while classic techno often reached well into the 130s.) But what the music sacrifices in tempo it makes up for in force. Slow and lumbering, it executes its maneuvers like a ship approaching port, unfurling long, interwoven melodic leads whose full arc only becomes clear by track's end. Despite their pace and their ruminative mood, these aren't chillout tracks; they're meant to be heard loud, the mass of the sound sweeping you up like a rising tide. Both cautious and immediate, deliberate and explosive, the music wonderfully captures the fraught drama of antecedents like Carl Craig or Urban Tribe. Just listen to the slowly churning ""Rorschach's Game"", which assembles itself as if from ashes, rising from white noise atop a thundering kick drum beneath an opalescent shimmer that wouldn't sound out of place on an Emeralds jam; shakers and skipping hi-hats flesh out its form, clattering like magnets clapped onto a metal exoskeleton. And then, to climax, Redshape unleashes an enormous series of drum fills, almost certainly played by a human drummer on a real drum kit, and the whole thing comes tumbling down, as though the rug beneath had been pulled free. ""Man Out of Time"" follows a similar trajectory, laying out layers of plangent string patches over a heart-in-mouth breakbeat. (A sort of industrial take on downtempo, it sounds like an armored-up version of Mo' Wax's 1996 Excursions compilation.) The lush ""Bound (Part 1 & 2)"", the album's most overtly techno track, rides dissonant mid-range arpeggios and a hard, overtone-rich bass throb, stoking a sense of unremitting tension; its melodic, ambient outro suggests how Redshape is looking beyond the dancefloor and the 12"", helping give The Dance Paradox a sense of flow that's uncommon for techno longplayers created in the 2000s. Redshape's synthesizers deserve special mention. The artist, who remains nominally anonymous (five minutes of internet sleuthing will lead you to an unmasking about as anticlimactic as Burial's), has claimed to favor analog gear, and it sounds like it-- although the way that software synths are evolving, it's getting harder and harder to tell. In any case, the specific tools matter less than what the artist achieves with them. Here, it's an array of sounds by turns metallic, velvety, porous, and pulverous. Emphasizing timbre and texture over melody and harmony, they're in constant motion-- sweeping, swelling, crumbling. They suggest Philly International's string ostinatos, frozen and then bronzed and crusted with oxidation; they billow out like dust-clouds around the base of a demolished high-rise. At the risk of tripping over techno's postmodern pathetic fallacy, Redshape's music, like that of his Detroit inspirations, almost invariably evokes visions of a kind of tarnished futurism. It throws up gleaming, industrial age surfaces and then revels in their decay.","As Burial reworked the signifiers of UK Garage into an extremely personal sound, Redshape takes the essential tropes of classic techno and does the same.

Alphabet 1968,Black to Comm,by: Andrew Gaerig,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a7a05e6ef95969321015/1:1/w_160/838adaa8.jpg,2010-01-06 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13789-alphabet-1968/,Type,"In a year in which some of the most successful ambient albums were extremely lengthy-- Brock Van Wey's White Clouds Drift On and On, Leyland's Kirby's 3xCD epic Sadly, the Future Is No Longer What it Was-- it's refreshing to find an album that understands the power of brevity. Black to Comm's Alphabet 1968 clocks in at a modest 43 minutes but probes the depths of ambient, drone, and modern classical composition with both restraint and imagination. Like a lot of experimental composers, Black to Comm's Marc Richter has operated on the fringes for a half-decade, placing several releases on an assemblage of labels, including his own Hamburg-based Dekorder. Alphabet 1968, on the increasingly impressive Type label, functions as his first widely available release, and it establishes Richter as a deft composer and an inspired stylist. The year 1968 permeates more than just the album's title, as the album's 10 tracks mimic the burbling, psychedelic compositions of German experimental music from that era. (Visually as well: the artwork bears a passing resemblance to Cluster & Eno, and the cheap-fade, dual-color tracklist reeks of import bin design hell.) More importantly, Alphabet 1968 privileges composition above method, repeatedly blurring the line between electronic and acoustic elements. Alphabet 1968 opens in intimidating fashion, rolling through nearly a third of the album's run time in the first two tracks, the rain-drenched piano ballad, ""Jonathan"", and the thumping, beatific ""Forst"", which sounds like the Field stretched putty-thin. From there, however, Richter lets Alphabet breathe, favoring short pieces that bleed into and out of each other. ""Rauschen""'s slowly thumbed acoustic guitar plays against an abstracted field recording. It lasts for just two minutes before segueing to the hectic music-box tinker of ""Musik Für Alle"". ""Traum GmbH"" features dollops of saturated organ noise. Richter anchors Alphabet with the ghastly, haunted pointillist whir of ""Houdini Rites"" and the monstrous bass tones of ""Void"" before redeeming the mood with ""Hotel Freund"", a harp-tinged orchestral movement that features an overlay of children's voices at play. ""Hotel Freund"" is a fittingly warm finale for an ambient/drone album that never lets its sound world become too insular. Richter's compositions function on a similar level as compositions by Tim Hecker and Fennesz, but they're far less abstract-- this is a guitar, and this is a harp, and that is rain. This is by no means a revolutionary accomplishment-- electro-acoustic composers have long toed the line between the abstract and the recognizable-- but, combined with Alphabet's manageable sequencing and length, it's refreshing on the heels of lengthy, career-defining efforts by similar artists. Alphabet 1968 is an adventurous, intriguing listen, but it succeeds because it takes sound worlds many consider epic and scales them down to palatable, weekday size.","Black to Comm successfully probes the depths of ambient, drone, and modern classical composition with both restraint and imagination.

Tracks are cheap and easy to compile, and sometimes you end up with a really fabulous mix or two. But even the turkeys are guaranteed to make blog rounds on the synergistic strength of your and your celebrity remixers' names-- thus extending the limited buzz-life of original material. So does Who Designs Nature's How mean Bell Orchestre is a real band and not just an Arcade Fire side project? Hold the emails; it's a rhetorical question. Still, you have to wonder what Richard Reed Parry, Sarah Neufeld, and the part-timing Luyas intended with this perfectly pleasant but hardly revelatory remix EP of their 2009 avant-orch-pop album, As Seen Through Windows. Bell Orchestre enlisted a credible lineup of mostly established electronic artists and studio wizards, including Tim Hecker, Mad Professor, Kid Koala, and Hôtel-de-Ville's Rhett Brewer, to rework the analog-recorded (by Tortoise's John McEntire) source material. Not surprisingly, none of the remixers embarrass themselves. Kid Koala, for example, strips some of the richer string and woodwind arrangements from ""Icicles/Bicycles"" and foregrounds a single plucked string tone, to hypnotic effect. In the process, he makes a minor point: Bell Orchestre, who rarely fail to indulge their whims-- from lumbering horn passages to the forced whizz-bang of group cheers-- might actually benefit from a little more focus. ""Water/Light/Shifts"" takes similar shape in Tim Hecker's hands. The original twinkles like twilight-drunk fireflies and damp fairy lights, which the remix distills into a thick spray of white noise. Both versions, however, offer the same soothing, mind-clearing mood of a yoga routine topped by a cup of green tea. ""As Seen Through Windows"" is probably the only remix that bothers to shift any frames. Dub legend Mad Professor reverb-warps the album track's melancholy melody (intentionally or not, a doppelgänger for Julee Cruise's ""Mysteries of Love""), layering it atop a hiccupping dubstep beat. What once implied a high school gym packed with band geeks who've locked their faculty advisor in the supply closet is now a 3 a.m. Special K-fuelled London nightclub hallucination. That Mad Professor's the rare guest who understands his remix assignment and stamps a legible signature on it is puzzling, but what's really weird is that Bell Orchestre's presumably content to release an EP of bland, faithful fare. I don't say this because they're experimentally inclined and genre-uncommitted, either. When a band plots an album around a concept like As Seen Through Windows, they're clearly curious about the subjective nature of art and eager to peer through as many lenses as possible.","Arcade Fire members' other band enlists Tim Hecker, Mad Professor, Kid Koala, and more to help craft this remix EP.

Enemy of the State: A Love Story,Lupe Fiasco,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a7afea9e61561daa563f/1:1/w_160/d1583c08.jpg,2010-01-06 06:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13794-enemy-of-the-state-a-love-story/,self-released,"A brief, incomplete recap of Lupe Fiasco's 2009: a stirring, live-band performance at the still hip-hop-phobic Coachella, a Hewlett Packard commercial that gets reprised as the last skit on this mixtape, unrelated plans to film with Matt Damon and climb Mount Kilimanjaro, an appearance on the Twilight soundtrack, and his influence manifesting explicitly in East Coast rhyme spitters Charles Hamilton and Wale as well as implicitly in L.A.'s jerkin' scene. Hell, planning to retire even before you release your first album got kinda big in 09, and Lupe was doing that before it got all trendy and shit. That's about as good a year a rapper can have while releasing almost no new music whatsoever. To cap it off? Actual music-- albeit just 22 minutes of it, on this mixtape that popped up in the middle of December. Maybe that needed to happen: If Lupe embodies any aspect of post-Kanye hip-hop, it's using greater access to candor and transparency to prove himself more unlikeable with every statement he makes outside of the booth. A lot of times, it's been tough to remember that we were intrigued not because he rapped from the perspective of a cheeseburger, but rather because he simply rapped his ass off. But outside of a few blips-- most notably, a RZA-styled, self-satisfied anthropomorphology of the United States tagged on to end of ""The National Anthem""-- Enemy of the State tends to steer towards the latter version of Lupe with often fantastic results. It's particularly true of ""The National Anthem"": Though rappers have been sampling Radiohead since the glory days of Chino XL, for the most part, it's an olive branch to alternative nation, the easiest way to show how refined your taste in non-rap music is. Suffice to say the biggest compliment you can give is that ""Anthem"" bangs even if you've never heard one second of Kid A. It's crucial that Lupe raps with the beat as opposed to merely over it, sounding equally adept atop the bassline as he is during the horn-led climax-- it's a great touch as his boast ""I don't think I'm best, I just think I'm better than..."" is completed by Thom Yorke singing ""...everyone."" A question that's been raised by Enemy of the State is whether it's Lupe ""going at"" Jay-Z. While it's been Lupe's M.O. to mostly beef with rap bloggers, there is a notable lean on Jay's material (""Thank You"", ""So Ghetto"") that goes beyond ""Blueprint 3 could've been something if someone else rapped over those beats."" ""So Ghetto"" showcases Lupe's ""Food & Liquor flow"" as a kite to an incarcerated friend, and perhaps self-consciously, ""Where I'm From"", one of Jay's gulliest tracks, gets flipped into ""Angels"", a rangy, Auto-Tuned love song. But elsewhere, Enemy keeps things short, vital, and mostly current: ""Back By Popular Demand"" is a fair exchange for Clipse's inclusion ""Dumb It Down"" on their Road to Til the Casket Drops mixtape, and ""The One"" is proof that DJ Khalil's beat could've been something had it not been saddled with that hook and the relentlessly personality-free raps of Slaughterhouse. Sure, there are still plenty of times when Lupe's charmingly overreaching with his punchlines, but I wouldn't trade it considering how revitalized Lupe sounds. Though it's pretty much impossible to not be amped by the ""Final Countdown""-styled bounce of Travis Porter's ""All the Way Turnt Up"" and the yo-yo synth of Lil' Wayne's ""Fireman"", the performances are potent reminders of Lupe's sheer technical prowess-- ""All the Way"" agreeably slouches through half-time punchlines (""I came to take it all back like I'm Miller High Life"") and while the former cuts off at about two and a half minutes, he raps like he could go on for five times that. So, is that grade up there justifying a lack of, I dunno, ambition? Tough to say: Though a conceptual framework gave us ""Gotta Eat"", it also resulted in ""Kick, Push"". Then again, mere days after Enemy of the State dropped, you could find Lupe dedicating about as many words as there are on this tape to putting RapRadar.com on blast for god knows what. Whatever becomes of that, at least we'll have this reminder of what Lupe is capable of when he's given a mic instead of a soapbox.","Getting back to business, the Chicago MC provides a potent reminder of his sheer technical prowess on this brief yet rewarding mixtape.

Of the Body Prone,Ahleuchatistas,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6e29d034d5c69bf3658/1:1/w_160/3596bc89.jpg,2010-01-05 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13633-of-the-body-prone/,Tzadik,"When they take the stage, Ahleuchatistas pretty much look like a classic power trio: guitar, bass, and drums. It's just a trick of the eye, though: Throughout its history, this band has sounded more like a trio with the power on the fritz, their instrumental music a series of sputtering Beefheartian paroxysms wedded to fleeting passages of muscular groove. They don't like you to get comfortable listening to their records, preferring to throw you off the scent of a rhythm with a sudden time change or all-out shift into dry, clattering freakout. So it makes sense that they've landed on John Zorn's Tzadik label, which is known for housing a lot of music that would sooner hit you with a shovel than caress or soothe you. The Asheville, N.C.-based trio hasn't changed its essential sound much, in spite of the departure of original drummer Sean Dail and the addition of his replacement, Ryan Oslance. The biggest shifts are a single, brief sample of a human voice low in the mix at the end of the sarcastically titled ""Dancing With the Stars"", and the very occasional use of distortion on Shane Perlowin's guitar, which until now had been dogmatically clean-toned, leaving the distorted playing to Derek Poteat's bass. Oslance's drumming is a bit looser than Dail's, and the album's overall balance is weighed more toward seething, arrhythmic passages than before. You get a fair tour of the band's unique world on opener ""2/3 Consensus on the Un-Finite Possibilities"". The first few minutes of the track is like climbing a mountain, as the combination of worming anti-melody and increasingly tense rhythm congeal until the five-minute mark, when the track explodes with cycling guitar and bass riffs as the drum part elasticizes, tightening and loosening at breakneck speed. It collapses into a meditative coda that could be the descent back to base camp. Oslance's best showcase is ""Why Can't We Be in Jamaica?"", where he plays a circular, almost tribal pattern that mutates over the course of the song as Poteat's distorted bass slings mud at it, and Perlowin's guitar swells in and out with spine-tingling drones. The band's signature onslaught of complex, hyperspeed interplay is on display on ""Owls"" and ""Racing Towards the Hard Kernal"", but in completely different ways-- the former sparkles with bright phrases and is full of breathing room, while the latter is heavy, dense, and violent. That's a pretty good example of what makes Ahleuchatistas work so well-- they've perfected their extremely basic approach to the point where it seems they can do anything they want with it. I do wonder if the faint whiff of a sample is a foreshadowing of change, but as the band continues to find more ways to make the chaos/order dynamic at its core interesting, it seems evident it doesn't need a lot of outside help to make good, surprising elements that hold your attention, so long as you're the type of listener who enjoys the abstract and somewhat difficult.","Asheville, N.C.-based trio releases its latest record on John Zorn's Tzadik label, a logical fit for their abstract, surprising music.

Milky Ways,Joakim,by: Andrew Gaerig,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a7735e6ef95969320fa1/1:1/w_160/93bd1ffe.jpg,2010-01-05 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13748-milky-ways/,!K7,"Joakim Bouaziz is one of those slyly ubiquitous artists who hangs around the periphery of your music collection. The busy producer/DJ/songwriter has spent the last decade remixing artists like Cut Copy and Annie while working for France's Tigersushi Records. A classically trained composer, Joakim periodically submits full-lengths of his own material, genre-jumping affairs that play like the product of an artist with disparate, long-developed ideas and non-traditional thoughts about what a full-length should accomplish. Milky Ways, Joakim's latest offering, vacillates between lengthy psych-rock dirges, Italo-disco frippery, and foggy art-pop, a de facto running commentary on contemporary trends. Despite his shapeshifting, Joakim's reputation lies firmly in the electronic realm, and even the open-minded will have trouble preparing themselves for ""Back to Wilderness"", an eight-minute squall of distorted guitars trampled by huge, live drums. This may be the product of Joakim's working band, the Disco (want running commentary, zeitgeist? The Disco were formerly known as the Ectoplasmic Band), a relationship that sees a handful of Milky Ways' songs recorded virtually live. Expectation obliterator, palate cleanser, band workout, whatever: ""Wilderness"" probably should've populated a B-side somewhere, because the remainder of Milky Ways musters plenty of variance without resorting to such transparent adventuring. Joakim's best work on Milky Ways comes via contemplative dance fodder. ""Spiders"" stretches out on short, timorous arpeggios and occasional guitar chirps, clearing room for a slow-chanted group chorus. ""Ad Me"" reestablishes order after ""Wilderness"" with blasts of dated, fake symphonics, and robotic, vocoder'd chatter. On ""Love & Romance & A Special Person"", a resonant major-key vocal melody burrows into Bouaziz's computer-love funk. The Kraut-y ""Travel in Vain"", its nodding momentum paced and familiar, touches on James Murphy's adroit simplicity. Joakim could probably roll off an entire album of these electro-punk gems, but he's too skittish. Sometimes-- the aforementioned ""Wilderness"", the post-rock jamminess of ""King Kong is Dead""-- he trips over his own shoelaces; often he molds weird, lingering pop music. ""Glossy Papers"" sounds like Giorgio Moroder taking on 1960s psych; ""Medusa"" mimics that chime and crash of Caribou's spicier compositions. ""Fly Like an Apple"" is ominous, lurking rock pastiche. ""Little Girl"", the album's closer and easily its softest moment, is a rhythmic ballad based on a William Blake poem. This is the work of a rarely satisfied auteur with a like-minded band: like Beck if he saw himself both too gaudy and too ragamuffin. This compositional variety results in an album that lacks a cohesive narrative. If you're keeping score at home, the above basically paints Milky Ways as a drone-metal-electro-soul-funk album, plus or minus some 18th century poetry. To those without the stomach for Joakim's waywardness, Milky Ways will often sound as much during the course of a listen. For those who are feeling adventurous but forgiving of the same, Joakim is a worthy companion.","French producer's latest veers from post-rock jamminess to rock pastiche but its best moments come when he settles into contemplative dance mode.

God Is a Twelve-Year-Old Boy With Asperger's,Eugene Mirman,by: Nate Patrin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a7a49d034d5c69bf384c/1:1/w_160/fdf1aa6b.jpg,2010-01-05 06:00:02,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13784-god-is-a-twelve-year-old-boy-with-aspergers/,Sub Pop,"Eugene Mirman's been responsible for some entertainingly preposterous comedy albums, but his stand-up sometimes feels more like an entry point than the entire package. It's integral to his career, but it's only one part of his repertoire-- a modern take on the glib ridiculousness and lighthearted arrogance that once were Steve Martin's specialties. And, like Martin, Mirman's recurring TV comedy roles (""Flight of the Conchords""; ""Delocated"") and writings (last year's exercise in self-help delirium The Will to Whatevs) display a range of humor at which stand-up can only hint. So when someone is so consistently and accessibly funny in all these different venues-- on the stage, on cable, in print, on his blog, on YouTube-- what's another 40ish minutes? Yet Mirman's second CD for Sub Pop, God Is a Twelve-Year-Old Boy With Asperger's, is just as characteristically amusing as anything else he's done in the past few years. It crams a lot of absurdity into its first half-hour: a discussion on bears living in the ruins of Detroit culminates in a debate between Mirman and an ursine member of the audience (""But there are bears! There's some in East Lansing--"" ""RERARARHGHG""), his tendency to concoct nonsensical slogans results in ideas for deranged internet banner ads (""Should the Iraq war be a war, or something else, like donuts or television?""), and there's a telling story about how a school-age Mirman delivered a book report by dressing as a cowboy and lip-synching a Bill Cosby record, subsequently dooming him to six years of special ed (""you get an A+, but you have to see a doctor""). Thankfully, Mirman's comedy never approaches the tedium of bad hey-remember-this pop-culture jokes or slapped-together ""OMG random"" ADD frivolity. It's more like a bewildered voyage through a mind that jumps from bafflement to surgical deconstruction in an instant. He throws around non sequiturs and oddball juxtapositions, but does so for real effect, using them them to punctuate the already existing weirdness of a situation, like he does when he deconstructs a Russian TV station's ethnically insensitive internet polls (Q: ""Roma around the world get a hard time because..."" The leading answer: ""They have a longstanding criminal reputation"") to riff off just how awkward racial discourse still is. And not just in Russia: Q: ""How should we deal with racism in America?"" A: ""Have Bruce Springsteen write a letter to poor people explaining that black people are just like them, but black."" The drawback to this album is its drawn-out ending, which puts Mirman in vendetta-against-faceless-companies mode for the second time on the album. There's a lot of frustration-borne laughs in the first instance, where Mirman gets mad at the gas company for screwing up his account and responds with threats as creative as they are petulant (""I will be mailing you a photograph of cows having sex every day because it isn't illegal""). But when he revisits that turf in a tirade against the customer service ineptitude of an airline that lost his luggage-- roping in another couple of comedians to play the CSRs, one of whom does an admittedly funny Christopher Walken-- it loses a lot of the unpredictable yet to-the-point sharpness of the material earlier in his set, and it pales next to the similar ""Fleet Bank"" bit from The Absurd Nightclub Comedy of Eugene Mirman. The closest the ""_____ Airlines"" bits come to his usual brilliant absurdity is the fact that the airline in question has its name bleeped out, yet the bleep is so short it's hard not to guess which one it is anyways. Granted, this isn't the first Eugene Mirman-based work of comedy you should buy. Absurd Nightclub Comedy is the best album to start with, and if you have to choose between God Is a Twelve-Year-Old Boy With Asperger's and The Will to Whatevs among his more recent offerings, go for the latter. But get this when you can, and give it a listen: Mirman is one of those comedians who just gets funnier with each new work he releases, and those 40ish minutes do a great job in moving that process along.","Indie comedy vet and ""Flight of the Conchords"" regular issues his latest Sub Pop stand-up album.

"The Singles, Vol. 8: 1972-1973",James Brown,by: Douglas Wolk,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a795ea9e61561daa5600/1:1/w_160/2d71f4fa.jpg,2010-01-05 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13774-the-singles-vol-8-1972-1973/,Hip-O Select,"In the early 1970s, James Brown wanted more badly than ever to be important. He re-entered the political arena on the wrong foot, pissing off his fan base by endorsing Richard Nixon for president in 1972; he tried to get in on Isaac Hayes and Curtis Mayfield's blaxploitation-soundtracking action, putting together music for Black Caesar and Slaughter's Big Rip-Off. He attempted to position himself as a crossover-minded mainstream entertainer, as a hardcore funk iconoclast, as an anti-drug humanitarian, and as a swinging party dude, all at the same time. Amazingly, he got away with most of it, and oversaw an expanding business at the same time-- People Records, a showcase for members of his revue, had recently launched. (Brown's name was plastered all over every People label's singles.) It helped that, as usual, even some of his moves that looked terrible on their face worked out just fine. Anyone else would have thought twice about releasing a dramatic reading, with strings, of a poem about heroin written by a waiter at the Godfather's favorite deli. (""King Heroin"" became a massive hit.) It also wasn't an obvious gesture to cover the ""5"" Royales' ""Think"" with a slick New York studio crew rather than his touring band in 1973-- especially since he'd already covered it as a single three times in the 60s-- or to pair it with a scenery-chewing soul version of the Beatles' ""Something"". (Shortly thereafter, he re-recorded his vocal for ""Think"", this time beginning with a little spiel about ""Soul Train"", and released it again as his next single; it hit the charts both times.) And it definitely seemed like a bad idea to bring saxophonist and former bandleader Maceo Parker back into his band without telling the rest of the group before they showed up at the recording studio, to release the result under his trombonist's name rather than his own, and to give its two parts separate titles that appear nowhere in its lyrics rather than naming it after the hook. ""Doing It to Death"", credited to Fred Wesley & the J.B.'s and released on People, became a #1 R&B single anyway. The one musical desire Brown still couldn't gratify was his longing for another ballad on the order of ""It's a Man's Man's Man's World"", which had been in his set for eight years (and would stay there for the rest of his life). ""Mama's Dead"" and the ghastly two-part ""Woman"" are both lugubrious rewrites of the real thing; ""Nothing Beats a Try But a Fail"" never even made it to the racks. The hard funk masterpieces, on the other hand, still flowed freely. ""There It Is"" is one of the hottest tracks he ever cut, a jubilant piece of cross-chatter whose fraction-of-a-second silences are like splashes of cold water. ""Get on the Good Foot"", ""I Got a Bag of My Own"", a jubilant strut through Bill Doggett's ""Honky Tonk"", the perfectly titled ""I Got Ants in My Pants (And I Want to Dance)"": the man was on a roll. Well, the man and his band, rather. Trombonist/bandleader Fred Wesley had been Brown's secret weapon for a while; by 1973, he was practically the co-star, the guy in charge of translating the boss's grunts and whims into hits. The soundtrack numbers on this set's second disc obviously bear his imprint, and even beyond ""Doing It to Death"", Wesley and the J.B.'s get off a bunch of great, slinky funk singles under their own name. Soul Brother #1 chants along for most of them, and even sits in on drums for a not-bad-at-all instrumental cover of Herbie Hancock's ""Watermelon Man"". Brown was starting to recapitulate his past hits more and more (""Sexy, Sexy, Sexy"", a substantial 1973 hit, is a note-for-note reprise of 1966's ""Money Won't Change You""), but for at least a few more years, his group's momentum was still pulling him into the future.","The latest set of JB singles finds him making odd decisions in an attempt to be seen as important and socially vital. Most of them work out fine.

Prison Break EP,The Tough Alliance,by: Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a796c0084474cd0c0c12/1:1/w_160/d967a605.jpg,2010-01-05 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13772-prison-break-ep/,Sincerely Yours,"""We have a world of pleasure to win, and nothing to lose but boredom."" That manifesto shows up a few times on the Tough Alliance-run Sincerely Yours label's website. As is the Gothenburg, Sweden-based electronic pop duo's habit, the words are borrowed, in this case from Belgian author and Situationist International member Raoul Vaneigem. You could think of TTA's music as sort of a living shrine to pleasure: unabashedly catchy, defiantly emotional, with gaudy synthetic beats and fuck-you bravado. But nobody can stave off boredom forever. In fact, TTA have been conspicuously quiet lately. Since releasing A New Chance, their second full-fledged album, in 2007, co-conspirators Eric Berglund and Henning Fürst have put out precious little new material under the TTA name: a pair of covers, a remix of Victoria Bergsman's Taken by Trees, and various remixes by other people of their own songs. The six TTA remixes collected on the mp3-only Prison Break EP are uniformly solid and occasionally revelatory dancefloor fare, well worth any Swede-head's $5.35. But Prison Break is an exceptionally weird release. As good as it is, this EP should have the duo's fans growing only more and more impatient for the next album or single-- unknown pleasures, still. In early November, Sincerely Yours mailing list subscribers received a typically enigmatic message, with one link to a new track by jj, and another to information about this EP. ""Better late than never,"" the linked page says; digital music seller Klicktrack lists Prison Break's release date as Oct. 31, 2008. The fuck? What's more, these remixes don't change the title of the original track, a naming convention that's usually standard for the Sincerely Yours crew (""Now That's What I Call Indulgence"", not ""Indulgence (The Tough Alliance Remix)""; ""The Sweetness of Air France"", not ""Sweetness (Air France Remix)""). One possible clue: Two of these remixes, a ravey ""Neo Violence"" by Dutch DJ/producer Laidback Luke (grab his remix of Robin S.'s ""Show Me Love"" with Sweden's Steve Angello) and a dubby space-disco ""Neo Violence"" by L.A.-based DFA/Rong signee Woolfy, came out in 2008 on Modular-- not Sincerely Yours. Regardless, rounding out a trio of ""Neo Violence"" takes here is a fine Daft Punk-style electro-house reworking by Perth-based Shazam. Whatever Prison Break's origins, the people you expect to be the heavy-hitters pretty much are. Barcelona's El Guincho is a TTA kindred spirit, sharing their yen for sunny globe-trotting, but his chiming, euphoric ""First Class Riot"" gets overshadowed a bit by jj's absolutely radiant ""touch of jules & jim"" version. Taking a name from 1962 French film Jules & Jim, jj's remix puts a hushed female voice alongside TTA's, which jj chop up and toy with like marionettes (or like that Grateful Dead sample on ""What Would I Want? Sky""), making TTA shout out ""touch of you"" and then a sublimely dumb ""da da"" melody atop girlish giggles and John Williams-grandiose orchestration. The Juan MacLean's ""A New Chance"", meanwhile, remains near perfection, ensconcing the original in the finest techno-house marble for future generations to marvel upon. ""It's not a question of understanding it, man. If you feel it, you feel it, stupid."" That quote, from a John Cassavetes film, shows up more than once on this EP, and it's still the best encapsulation of the Sincerely Yours spirit. We could quibble about the absence of Brooklyn duo Tanlines' highlife-meets-Whigfield ""A New Chance"" remix, or California krautrock-disco duo Windsurf's ""Neo Violence (Windsurf's Neon Violet Dub)"", or other DJ-ready TTA remixes by Alvy Singer and Stevie Tech Nicks. But those are all pretty easily downloadable at this point. More urgent: The Sincerely Yours catalog description for Prison Break mentions that TTA are ""on short term leave."" We have no new(-ish) TTA to listen to but this. Until the next random-ass listserv email.","This digital-only EP features uniformly solid remixes from El Guincho, jj, and others, plus an incredible one from the Juan MacLean.

Slow Attack,Brett Anderson,by: Joshua Klein,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a785c0084474cd0c0be7/1:1/w_160/b4227bd3.jpg,2010-01-04 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13761-slow-attack/,B A Songs,"Over in some alternate universe, Suede never fumbled, flamed out, and fizzled. Guitarist Bernard Butler never embarked on a lackluster solo career, singer Brett Anderson wasn't compelled to follow suit, and neither saw the need to reconvene as the inconsequential Tears. While we're at it, Suede never would have had that awkward and lame ""London"" affixed to their name in the U.S., either (thanks, anonymous coffeehouse singer!). Back in the real world, however, Suede doesn't carry nearly as much cachet as Britpop mainstays Oasis, Blur, or even Pulp, and in turn Brett Anderson's solo career hasn't been afforded nearly as much attention as, say, Albarn's post-Blur experiments. Then again, Anderson hasn't made a particularly strong case for himself as a solo act, either, debuting with 2007's prematurely autumnal self-titled debut and continuing with the next year's spare, dour Wilderness, which found him wandering the same. Sure, they were both clearly by the Suede guy, but at the same time, they were different. Or at least, Anderson was. Slow Attack, Anderson's third solo album, doesn't mark a return to Suede territory, either, but it does find Anderson increasingly confident and comfortable as a solo artist, especially in this particularly morose mode. Featuring Leo Abrahams as Anderson's primary collaborator and (reportedly) Talk Talk as an inspiration, Anderson finds in Mark Hollis' ineffable melancholia the right template for his own gloomy but oddly warm compositions. The Talk Talk influence manifests itself mainly in Anderson's embrace of woodwinds and droning strings, but also in the way Anderson feels little pressure to reach the cheap seats, taking some risk in leaving melodies intriguingly unresolved, and the arrangements more open-ended. ""The Hunted"" and ""Summer"", for example, could easily have been glammed up into familiar grand rock ballads, but Anderson keeps things restrained, trading bombast for patient and grace. Elsewhere Anderson alludes to traditional folk with songs such as ""Wheatfields"" and Frozen Roads"" without resorting to outright aping his influences (which Suede shamelessly had no problem doing). ""Pretty Widows"" and ""Ashes of Us"" quietly expand on the piano-based palette of ""Wilderness"" as Anderson embraces darkness and grey skies with none of the larger-than-life rock star lifer narcissism that marked his previous band. Of course, some, especially those looking for a little of the old swagger, would point to those qualities as signs of Anderson's failure, and indeed compared to Suede's ace catalog some of these songs may come off unduly po-faced in their pastoral drift. But if his first two solo albums came across self-conscious refutations of his roots, Anderson was at least brave enough to stick to his guns. Slow Attack doesn't always make sense in the context of Suede, but as far as solo Anderson goes, this album marks a logical next step in his transformation. Slow and steady, it's a promising sign of progress.","The former Suede singer finds unlikely inspiration in Talk Talk and makes his best solo album.

Kitsuné Maison 8,Various Artists,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a797ea9e61561daa5608/1:1/w_160/949f79fc.jpg,2010-01-04 06:00:03,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13773-kitsune-maison-8/,Kitsuné,"The Paris-based Kitsuné label has diverse tastes that can only be encompassed by the large ""indie-dance"" tent. Its aesthetic is built on a bedrock of retro house and future disco. It tends to like the flashy, upbeat, and stylish; the play of wiry digital sequences against brightly buffed analog electronics or sculpted guitars; pop-culture nostalgia and ingenuous good-life anthems. Its catalog leaves plenty of room for electro-pop, indie rock, and indefinable left-field music, provided that it has a certain chic air, polished production, and at least a toe on the dance floor. It's eclectic, but not in a haphazard way: Wherever cool people make music for other cool people to dance to, remix, and recognize while boutique-shopping, Kitsuné is there. Despite this variety, the makeup of their compilations is remarkably consistent. They always contain one or two rising stars (prior installments caught Phoenix, Hot Chip, Klaxons, and Bloc Party at ideal moments), some killer tracks that are either too techno or too weird to get really popular, and a bunch of stuff that would at least perk up your ears on ""Gossip Girl"" or at Urban Outfitters. This installment is no exception. Memory Tapes' ""Bicycle"" fills the breakout slot-- while he's unlikely to go on to Phoenix-caliber stardom, he's one of the signal acts of the emergent glo-fi genre. A couple of other standout tracks also get in on the endless summer that was 2009. French Horn Rebellion's ""Up All Night"" is a great opener-- irresistible, panting synth-pop, with fat new wave key tones and ecstatic vocals. And the Drums' ""Let's Go Surfing"", a delicious ""Young Folks""-meets-""Misirlou"" bon bon, maintains its winking yet earnest 50s feel flawlessly; the ""down by the rollercoaster"" break is especially contrived and convincing. They're like a Kitsuné version of Surfer Blood, with mannered aesthetics standing in for messy abandon. There are a number of entries in the cool-but-obscure camp this year. Siriusmo's ""High Together"" is an exciting ride-- cosmic disco that swoops down into hair-raising minor keys, as if Pantha du Prince had designed the music for Space Mountain. Le Corps Mince de Françoise's funky odd-pop number ""Something Golden"" sounds like something Micachu might have cobbled together, with bolt-action percussion accents and barnyard vocals. Slagsmålsklubben's brainy ""Brutal Weapons"" plinks and mangles like a tech-house kalimba, with lots of shapely pitch-bends. Promising new signing Delphic offer the forthcoming single ""This Momentary"", a streaming, dreamy electro-pop track with a blatantly emotional appeal. Midnight Juggernaut's ""This New Technology"" is an interesting wild card, a big blowsy guitar anthem with those ubiquitous zippering scales (hey, more glo-fi signifiers!) tracing icy whorls in the chorus. And Heartsrevolution's ""Dance Till Dawn"", a vocoder-glazed 80s flashback that's all neon reflected in chrome, swaggers persuasively. These tracks testify to the label's range, although the handful of negligible ones point out its limitations-- even turbo-charged sparkle can get played out at length. There's nothing truly bad here, although Crystal Fighters' tweaky ""I Love London"", which seems to be trying to vibrate its own frame off, might set your teeth on edge if you catch it in the wrong moment. But some tracks just dissolve into a sugary, distractedly pleasurable sense of conspicuous consumption and wanton eighties-humping. The remixes aren't very exciting this time around-- Harvard Bass' version of Beni's ""Maximus"" has a hot bass line and not much else. Ditto for Moulinex's remix of Two Door Cinema Club's ""I Can Talk"". Alex Kapranos turns in the best retrofit: A widescreen take on Chew Lips' ""Salt Air"", beaming with revelatory synths. And there's little to be said for ""Control"", Nottee's mildly dull Italo-tropical plodder, or ""I Am the Sound"", My Tiger My Timing's winsome electro-funk closer, except that they keep the urban bon vivant aura intact for a little while longer. Kitsuné Maison 8 lacks the insane highs of some prior comps, but its consistency testifies to the label's ongoing vitality.","The Paris-based label again shows its range and strong ear, with a comp featuring Memory Tapes, the Drums, and Chew Lips vs. Alex Kapranos.

In This Light and on This Evening,Editors,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6b75e6ef95969320de1/1:1/w_160/ae18f13b.jpg,2010-01-04 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13597-in-this-light-and-on-this-evening/,Fader,"Joy Division weren't exactly a laugh riot back in their day, and if Editors do anything to distinguish themselves from the numerous JD acolytes that emerged in the middle of this decade, it's that they actively push an image of being the least fun band of the bunch. Nevertheless, their 2005 debut The Back Room had singles like ""Blood"" and ""Munich"" that were tightly-coiled enough to honor their post-punk influences while being hooky enough to serve as a good entry-level primer. But like so many of their peers (I'm looking at you, British Sea Power), by album two they didn't let loose so much as get bloated, showing the smug healing powers of victory lap-era U2 without the years of artistic restlessness that earned it. Nonetheless, they play stadiums, so they're hardly the most likely candidates to do a complete about-face this far in. So give 'em credit here for going a long way towards dismantling what we've come to know about Editors. Chris Urbanowicz's windy tremolo riffs are mostly forsaken in favor of defiantly sterile washes of synths, the itchy 16th-note hi-hats are replaced by ticky-tack drum machines, and bass is now a lead instrument. Thanks to Flood's production, In This Light and on This Evening is still arena-aspiring in a early-1980s Depeche Mode sort of way, despite the emphasis on relatively primitive electronics. But with Tom Smith out front, it's like an early-80s Depeche Mode where ""Master and Servant"" is a turgid dirge about oppressive shadow governments and the hopes they squash. While we're on the subject of servitude, no matter what goes on behind him, every song is at the mercy of Smith. He's always sounded like a karaoke rendering of ""Atrocity Exhibition"", but more than ever, his delivery is imbued with a mojo risin' camp which only goes to emphasize lyrics that fall apart under the slightest bit of scrutiny. Which I guess is something of a gift: not everyone delivers your rebellious 15-year old cousin's next Facebook status-- ""living out our second-hand clichés""-- completely straightfaced like Smith does on ""Like Treasure"". I could spend the rest of this review dropping jewels from ""You Don't Know Love"", but I key on the kick Smith gives the line ""you were the truth... when you lied,"" a convenient summary of the dominant themes of portent and nonsense. The queasy intro of ""The Big Exit"" sounds promising enough in its willingness to imbue dissonance to In This Light's otherwise hermetic sound, but midway through, Smith moans ""Damn the passing hours/ Damn the summer flowers,"" before trying to hammer home the rhyme ""They took what once was ours,"" repeating it incessantly as if he's trying to figure out what he himself means by that. ""The Boxer"" dolls itself up with pretty-in-pink synth dots, and I guess it might be an Editors party song-- Smith at least acknowledges human connection by intoning a silly joke (""This place is a prison/ And its cells are the bars."") But immediately thereafter, ""Take me to the town/ I want to dance with the city/ Show me something ugly/ Show me something pretty"" is quite possibly the best Interpol parody since Our Love to Admire. It's sort of a catch-22 that Editors can write songs sticky enough to be memorable in unfortunate ways-- ""kicks like a sleep twitch"" is the sort of stray line that Juelz Santana might chuckle an ad-lib over, not something you should build your first single around. And yet, while the synth progression of first single ""Papillon"" cops heavily from ""Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)"", the beat drops out completely so Smith can stress that very lyric, warning you that you'll be hearing it a lot more before the song's over. Likewise, a song called ""Eat Raw Meat = Blood Drool"" pretty much ensures itself a failure; it's got the snappiest hook on the album, but every other part of the song plays out like a half-assed riff on ""Myxomatosis"". Whether the six-minute ""Bricks and Mortar"" copped influence from krautrock or just the last Horrors album is beside the point-- as Smith bellows ""pour saltwater onto the wound,"" he's throwing his arms around the world and feeling nothing. I used the phrase ""entry level"" earlier, and I keep on thinking of that term when trying to figure out the appeal of Editors. You know that kid in your dorm who took a semester's worth of intro lit and philosophy classes as a license to use the word ""Kafka-esque"" at every opportunity? In This Light and on This Evening is for that guy.","Album number three from the popular UK post-punk acolytes finds them moving to a more synth-based sound to dreary effect.

My Dusty Road,Woody Guthrie,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a79cea9e61561daa5611/1:1/w_160/64bfa9f8.jpg,2010-01-04 06:00:01,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13778-my-dusty-road/,Rounder,"Every year it seems someone finds a lost treasure in a mundane place: a Pollock at a flea market, a rare edition of Darwin stacked on a toilet, a Michelangelo gathering dust in the attic. In addition to perhaps filling a hole in an artist's catalog that we didn't even know was there, such occurrences garner enough headlines to make us think we could be sitting on top of similarly undiscovered treasures. That's the story behind My Dusty Road, which begins with the kind of phone call we all wish we got. In 2003, an archivist named Michael Creamer heard from a cousin who said he had been contacted by a woman in Brooklyn claiming to have rare, unreleased recordings of Woody Guthrie. She had, in fact, inherited the masters from the long-defunct Stinson label, which was founded by Herbert Harris and Moe Asch and had been active during the first half of the 20th century. Harris' widow had left the collection to her neighbor, Lucia Sutera, who left it stored in the basement of her apartment building. As he writes in the liner notes to My Dusty Road, Creamer couldn't let himself believe that such rare Guthrie recordings actually existed, but when he eventually rummaged through the piles of nickel-plated copper discs, he found more than 50 performances from the mid-1940s. In fact, due to the durability of the materials and the means of storage, they were of surprisingly crystalline sound quality, which was all the more unexpected considering Stinson had a reputation among collectors for releasing shoddy records during wartime vinyl rationing. Even the Guthrie recordings that Stinson actually released don't sound this good. For that alone, My Dusty Road, which collects the bulk of those sessions, is a treasure for historians and Guthrie fans alike. And Rounder has packaged them as such: the set arrives in a small, roadworn suitcase containing reproductions of the folkie's business card, a postcard from Florida to his wife back in New York, and a notice of booking from 1947. There are also novella-length liner notes that not only recount Guthrie's career but document in technical detail the process of discovering, organizing, remastering, and releasing these recordings. And then there's the music itself. Rather than adhere to the order of the original sessions, the tracks have been organized thematically across four discs: ""Woody's Greatest Hits"", ""Woody's Roots"", ""Woody the Agitator"", and ""Woody, Cisco & Sonny"", which features fellow folkie Cisco Houston and blues harmonica player Sonny Terry. Collecting some of his more popular songs, ""Woody's 'Greatest' Hits"" finds an instructive balance between patriotic flag-waving and outraged dissent. He extols American ingenuity on ""Grand Coulee Dam"" and memorializes dead sailors on the forlorn ""Sinking of the Reuben James"", about a U.S. aid ship torpedoed by a German U-boat. Those songs bristle against outraged numbers like ""This Land Is Your Land"" (which 60 years later seems to have lost most of its socialist connotations) and two versions of ""Goin' Down the Road (I Ain't Gonna Be Treated This Way)"", a powerful cry for empowerment and equality. That disc proves much feistier than ""Woody the Agitator"", a collection of protest and pro-union songs that sounds curiously subdued. Despite the famous image that adorns the cover (Guthrie and his guitar emblazoned with ""This Machine Kills Fascists""), there's little of the truth-to-power indignation that made him a hero to generations of musicians and listeners. Guthrie conveys some disgust on ""Hangknot, Slipknot"", but the song has only the barest of verses and the repetition of the word ""hangknot"" becomes quickly tedious. Despite the righteous ""Tear The Fascists Down"" and ""When the Yanks Go Marching In"", most of these songs sound barely agitated at all. Full of spirited run-throughs of songs he learned from his Uncle Jeff Guthrie and from his travels through the folk circuit, ""Woody's Roots"" and ""Woody, Cisco & Sonny"" comprise a more engaged and much more charming half of the box set. Guthrie offers a series of snapshots of poverty on the nineteenth-century parlor ballad ""A Picture form Life's Other Side"" and tall tales on ""Stackolee"", which finds a bit of humor in all that violence. By contrast, Houston's guitar trills beautifully on the funereal ""Will You Miss Me When I'm Gone?"" while ""Hard Ain't It Hard"" and the Carter Family's ""Worried Man Blues"" are mournful meditations on heartbreak marked by Guthrie's soulfully downcast vocals. Houston appears on most of the songs on ""Roots"", but their sessions with Terry sound more like a lark, launching into loose rags, medleys, and breakdowns with merry abandon. Terry is a dynamic addition to their dueling guitars, and his harmonica provides an organlike backdrop on ""Do You Ever Think of Me (aka At My Window)"" and doggedly chases the guitar on ""Brown's Ferry Blues"" as Guthrie calls out for him to repeat his solo. That fourth disc presents a very different side of Guthrie than is glimpsed elsewhere on this set. In fact, the folkie comes across as a highly complex artist on My Dusty Road, with all of his affectations and contradictions fully intact and in some cases even reinforced. However, one wonders how the set would have fared if it re-created these sessions rather than imposing such artificial categories onto the music. It too neatly compartmentalizes Guthrie's populist preaching from his more playful performances, his outrage from his joy. The man himself was never so organized; that he could sing a grave union ballad after a nonsensical number makes him seem very real even so many years after his death, despite the pains he took to create and sustain his folkie persona. By dividing the sessions into what amounts to an overview of his career, My Dusty Road detracts from the recently discovered source material, making it both an incredible find and a missed opportunity.","A treasure for historians and folk fans alike, this 4xCD set collects more than 50 long-lost mid-1940s performances from the American legend.

Untitled,R. Kelly,by: Sean Fennessey,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a7a913d1975652139482/1:1/w_160/e5e5182e.jpg,2010-01-04 06:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13790-untitled/,Jive,"Of all the things that could undermine-- and perhaps torpedo-- R. Kelly's career, laziness has rarely been considered. What a decade it's been for Kelly-- he's thrived in a curious way, morphing from true blue 1990s R&B icon into an increasingly strange and beguiling pop culture oddball. He is known by more people now than ever, though not always for the best reasons. He released bold albums (Chocolate Factory), brave albums (Happy People/U Saved Me), and bad albums (TP.3 Reloaded). He has been the maximalist to end all, creating and eventually overindulging his ""Trapped in the Closet"" video novella series. He collaborated on two disappointing albums with Jay-Z. He contributed two of his steeliest songs ever, both ballads, to Whitney Houston's comeback album, I Look to You, this year. He had sex in the kitchen, sex in the jungle, sex with your girlfriend. And on June 13, 2008, Kelly battled and beat child pornography charges. Which, to many, is all that matters now. But Untitled isn't sunk by the vestiges of scandal-- this just isn't Kelly at his best. He has survived for so many years in a ravenously young genre-- R&B pop-- by innovating. But too often here he trips over trends-- on ""Crazy Night"" he abuses Auto-Tune, on ""Text Me"" he overthinks modern communication, and on ""Superman High"" he mistakes OJ Da Juiceman for a suitable foil. These are the blunders made by an aging man working hard to stay relevant, expending energy on ephemera. In 2008, Kelly planned to release 12 Play: 4th Quarter, a third sequel of sorts to his astonishing 1993 debut. But the album (no classic) leaked months in advance, and the project was junked and rerecorded. A handful of songs from 4th Quarter have survived and made it to Untitled; but hearing Kelly moan ""This is the 4th quarter!"" on ""Go Low"" is a bizarre remnant-- it disrupts any chance at continuity and is otherwise just confusing to anyone who hasn't followed the story. Scrapping the remaining songs, all unremarkable, would have gone a long way toward trimming what, at 62 minutes, is already a slog. As with nearly every R. Kelly album, sex is Untitled's raison d'être. But now it's more discomfiting. Not because his perspective or predilections have changed. They haven't. The man wants to have sex for long periods of time. With multiple partners. At all hours available. But the consequences of his commitment are devastating. Only when he's at his best is it easy to imagine some other R. Kelly, one unmarked by shame, singing with vigor about banging headboards. ""Echo"", a melodic marvel, is the best song Kelly has recorded in years, managing to make yodeling (yes) elemental, not a gimmick. It's graceful and gorgeous and about a sex session. ""Exit"", too, is fascinating reinvention-- Kelly sing-raps every bar, lifting his elastic, burnished voice up at nearly each word's end. To wit: ""Now I can't leave(!) this club(!!!) without(!!) you girl(!!!)/ Swear I (!!) want more(!!) you deserve an encore(!!!)."" This kind of phrasing just isn't normal, and only a person who has written hundreds of songs with same-y lyrics is capable of altering delivery like this. Maybe it's a pittance in the grand scheme of his important career-- modern R&B is racked with artists like The-Dream and Trey Songz who simply would not exist without him-- but these are the things to root for on R. Kelly albums. That there are so few makes this a minor work.","After surviving for years in a ravenously young genre (and, of course, his legal battles), this beguiling pop culture oddball finds himself oddly adrfit.

"Fire in My Bones: Raw + Rare + Otherworldly African-American Gospel, 1944-2007",Various Artists,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a7875e6ef95969320fd9/1:1/w_160/be814200.jpg,2009-12-11 06:00:04,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13759-fire-in-my-bones-raw-rare-otherworldly-african-american-gospel-1944-2007/,Tompkins Square,"Fire in My Bones makes its intentions known within its first three songs. This 3xCD gospel collection opens with the spry, graceful instrumental performance of the traditional hymn ""Peace in the Valley"", recorded in 1963 by ace lap steel player Rev. Lonnie Farris. It's not the obvious choice for an opener, but serves as a kind of overture. Immediately following is ""Rock and Roll Sermon"", in which Mobile, Alabama's Elder Beck enumerates the evils of secular music and its degenerative effect on good Christian society. Amazingly, the song itself rocks hard, as Beck improvises on Bill Halley's ""Rock Around the Clock"" and an unknown guitar player fires off ferocious hellfire licks. After that Spirit-fueled sermon comes ""If I Could Hear My Mother Pray Again"", a professional recording by Rev. Anderson Johnson that manages to be both restrained and massively moving, his smoothly expressive voice effortlessly conveying his orphan angst. In just three songs, Fire in My Bones covers a range of musical approaches and emotional expressions: from contented to contemptuous, from professional sessions to field recordings, from fevered shouts to ruminative moans. Gospel, this collection insists, is not one thing but many. The term itself constitutes such a wide umbrella that it may have more to do with the performers and their intentions than with the noises they make. That mission explains some of the curious aspects of the collection, which was curated by writer, archivist, and Pitchfork contributor Mike McGonigal. First, there's that unhelpfully long time frame, which spans the height of World War II through the last days of the Bush II era. What can you say about gospel and its development throughout the 20th century if you're painting with such broad strokes? As a history of the form, Fire in My Bones offers little insight into how it developed across these 63 years. To be fair, though, McGonigal is after more than a simple chronicle of the genre. He eschews the post-war heyday th [#script:http://pitchfork.com/media/backend/js/tiny_mce/themes/advanced/langs/en.js]|||||| at many compilers and historians emphasize, setting his sights on the margins of the gospel mainstream. Those margins are lively and rambunctious, which makes Fire in My Bones an often mind-blowing listening experience-- a Nuggets-style mix from a guy with a deep knowledge of the subject. Disparity is the key theme: On ""Wasn't That a Mystery"", the Madison County Senior Center Singers deliver a mighty call and response, while Rev. G.W. Killens and the Mt. Calvary Congregation achieve a full upswell of wordless sounds-- a truly joyful noise, but also one filled with dark warning. The Abraham Brothers' ""Spirit of the Lord"" possesses a gravitational sway that isn't too far removed from the rockabilly rhythms of the Radio Four's ""How Much I Owe"". Not so much in their subject matter but in the quality of their performances, these recordings make clear these are first and foremost worship songs, but there are many ways to praise God: extolling His power to others, recounting personal experiences and commitments, and deploying a brand of scare tactics that might seem ugly if not set to such rollicking and urgent music. The musical and emotional diversity of this collection speaks to the range of circumstances under which these songs were performed and recorded, as well as to the variety of African-American experience throughout the latter half of the 20th century and into the 21st. These artists made music using whatever resources were available, for whoever was devoted enough to hear them: a professional studio, an archivist's reel-to-reel, a congregation that can double as an instrument, or just a beat-up harmonica. As Tennessee singer Joe Townsend exclaims, ""If I could not say a word, I would just raise my hand."" For showing the many different ways people can raise their hands, Fire in My Bones is an invaluable introduction to the power and breadth of gospel, as wide and disparate as ""rock'n'roll"" or ""hip-hop."" But that lesson isn't this collection's greatest quality. Rather, its true selling point is the intense power of these individual testimonies, which rock, roll, and revel with passion and real fire.","This gospel set covers a wide range of approaches: from contented to contemptuous, sessions to field recordings, fevered shouts to ruminative moans.

Xenophanes,Omar Rodriguez-López,by: Jess Harvell,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a7819d034d5c69bf37f6/1:1/w_160/ec2a92cf.jpg,2009-12-11 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13763-xenophanes/,Rodriguez López,"I am probably the only Pitchfork staffer who unabashedly loves the Mars Volta in all their dumb-assed grandiosity and shameless sprawl. I will suffer through their most meandering fusion-pastiche jams if it means reaching one of their Wagner-by-way-of-Dark Magus climaxes. But even I have to admit there are times where I wish Cedric Bixler-Zavala and Omar Rodriguez-López still had a couple of meat-and-potatoes punk-types around to act as foils. Not to equate the dudes from Sparta with Teo Macero, but at least in the At the Drive-In days you never worried you were footing the bill for someone's wah-wah pedal obsession. If you're already suspicious of the MV's concept album corpulence, then the idea of a solo project from one of the band's principals, freed from even the loosest commercial restraints, might seem like a definite no-go. And guitarist Omar Rodriguez-López's glut of one-man-band releases this decade-- this is his fifth solo album released in 2009 alone-- have indeed tended toward the sort of free-form/cut-up/noise-for-the-sake-of-it ""experiments"" that even Volta-lovers might listen to once-and-only-once out of fannish respect. Which is why it's a bit of a surprise that Xenophanes may be the tightest Volta-related product since De-Loused in the Comatorium, back when the tunes were still more riff than solo. And clearing away the show-off instrumental density-- it's admittedly hard to make claims for the Volta's sense of nuance when 900 people are wailing away in semi-unison, a racket that's often easy to mistake for a Latin-tinged prog band covering The Omen soundtrack-- reveals a delicacy to Omar's music that may surprise. Throw a slo-mo disco beat under the quiet storm of atmospherics in ""Ojo al Cristo de Plata"", and it could be one of those soft-prog/neo-Balearic dance tunes currently so beloved by young house aesthetes. And ""Sangrando Detras de los Ojos"" is actually damned beautiful-- a gentle and even-tempoed instrumental, without an attention-straining time-change in earshot-- akin to ATDI's always stirring breakdowns, the very necessary breathers between the band's attempts to knock the sense out of you. Of course, with typical Volta-ish perversity, ""Sangrando"" is also the shortest track here. The rest is pretty much what you'd expect: ""funk-rock"" influenced by the guitar FX dogpile of ""Wars of Armageddon"" rather than the streamlined party music of ""Flash Light"" (""Mundo de Ciegos""); portentous melodrama in search of a stadium full of RPG aficionados (""Oremos""); and plinky-plonky electronic miniatures more A-Musik than post-hardcore (""Azoemia""). As always, Rodriguez-López could benefit from an outside editor, since his internal editor seems to have been given his pink slip when ATDI broke up. (There's a sixth solo album arriving before the end of the calendar year.) And only staunch Volta cultists would claim every minute of Xenophanes is worth your precious leisure time. But damn if the best bits don't make an excellent in-car soundtrack for pretending you're on your way to something more dramatic than your day job.","The latest in a large run of 2009 solo records from Omar Rodriguez-López may be the tightest Mars Volta-related release in years.

Echo Kid,Turbo Fruits,by: Matthew Perpetua,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a78b13d1975652139433/1:1/w_160/f7a78045.jpg,2009-12-11 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13768-echo-kid/,Fat Possum,"Turbo Fruits started off as a Be Your Own Pet side project, and that was obvious enough on their self-titled debut album from 2007. Sure, BYOP were a rowdy bunch, but without frontwoman Jemina Pearl to keep the boys classy, they were given license to get even more lewd and obnoxious than usual, and the result was a record that was like the musical equivalent of a filthy off-campus apartment shared by a bunch of gleefully immature young single dudes. Echo Kid, the band's first album since Be Your Own Pet's dissolution last year, is a bit different. They're still a balls-out garage rock outfit, but main man Jonas Stein has refined his voice, sharpened his chops, and penned an album that can be loosely described as ""suave."" You'd never want to call this stuff mature, but they've definitely grown up a bit. Stein doesn't come close to Pearl's level of bratty charisma, but he's got a solid voice for British Invasion-inspired rock, and is especially good at affecting a playful, lascivious tone without tipping over into skeevy, unsexy Louis XIV territory. The most appealing thing about him is that, as much as he plays the horny flirt on songs like ""Naked With You"" and ""Lotta Lotta Ladies"", he comes off like a decent, respectful guy rather than some dumbass creep. In fact, Stein is kind of a sweetheart. This is most apparent on the tender yet snappy ballad ""Hold Me"", which I imagine is exactly the kind of song girls hope to have written about them by their rock-dude crushes. ""My Stupid Heart"", a gentle slow dance number, is even more corny and old-fashioned, but he's sincere enough that it doesn't just seem like an empty smirk of a tune. When Turbo Fruits get riled up, as on the opening track ""Want Some Mo'"" and ""Trouble!"", they build up a good energy, but it's noticeably different from what they went for on their debut or what Stein wrote as a member of Be Your Own Pet. He's set aside the cartoon violence and manic jolting rhythms, and settled into a relatively subtle quasi-rockabilly vibe. The songs are just as dynamic, but the music has more room to breathe, allowing for pretty melodic arpeggios and clever touches like the whistled hook in ""Mama's Mad Cos I Fried My Brain"". To some extent, you've heard this all before. There's not a lick, hook, or lyric on Echo Kid that won't give you a feeling of déjà vu, but the execution is strong and the music is pleasurable enough that it hardly matters. To complain about a lack of originality here would be like bitching about cheeseburgers being more or less the same at every diner. Actually, this album is just like a diner cheeseburger: Cheesy, greasy, bloody, goes good with beer. It may not the best example of its kind, but it's satisfying all the same.","Once a Be Your Own Pet side project, Turbo Fruits issue their first LP since the dissolution of their day-job band.

Klang,The Rakes,by: Jason Crock,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a77b9d034d5c69bf37e5/1:1/w_160/fb4a15b2.jpg,2009-12-11 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13755-klang/,V2,"Shortly after the Rakes released their third album, Klang, in the U.S., the band announced its breakup and canceled the remaining shows of its tour. Their announcement came across as unceremonious and humble-- they revealed they'd promised themselves they'd quit if they couldn't give the band 100%. If the party was coming down, however, one couldn't tell from the sound of Klang. Their previous record, 2007's Ten New Messages, saw the band branch out from their then-fashionable post-punk guitar-rock into electronic textures and more topical lyrics, and the results were a little mixed. Here, the band returns to its comfort zone, for better or for worse. From the start of the record, it sounds mostly for the better: On opener ""You're in It"", singer Alan Donohoe veers from exaggerated crooning to desperate yelps, and while the music treads the same pattern, the guitar tone is drier and the rhythm section starts and stops in fits; the band sounds more nervous and urgent than before. ""That's the Reason"" follows with a breathless tempo and just a touch of chirping keyboards in a chorus that's relentlessly catchy. While the Rakes have forgotten some of the better elements of their earlier records, the songs are still thankfully there. From the fast and smirking openers to liberal la-la-la's in the chorus of ""1989"" or the melodic bass thump of ""The Light of Your Mac"", Klang is a record of simple, memorable tunefulness. Lyrically, it comes across like the working-class perspective of their debut-- they're still writing what they know. ""That's the Reason"" weighs the pros and cons of leaving friends to chase after the unexpected, but hints that it's the search for something more lasting that has the narrator running off. They regain a good bit of the mania and charm of their early singles and debut, but Klang misses some of Donohoe's earlier eye for sharp detail that made that perspective more believable. ""The Light of Your Mac"" is a funny telling of a relatable situation, but among the hand-wringing and tiptoing around flatmates, the title is probably its most distinctive detail. So this is-- or was-- the Rakes stripping down and kicking out the jams, as it were, by glossing over some things to be sure to deliver on others. The band's sonic palette is slightly wider, with acoustic guitars in the breakdown of ""Shackleton"" and an urgent piano march in ""The Woes of the Working Woman"". It's a shame the Rakes stopped just as they were starting to sound fun again, but if they had to end it while they still had that last spark of fun left, it's a better decision than most successful bands can bring themselves to make. A few outstanding singles is more than most bands can ask for-- maybe even more valuable than that is knowing when to end a good run.","The UK indie band returns to the spirit and energy of their promising debut, and then unexpectedly breaks up after releasing this record.

Not to mention that just over a year ago Sugar Mountain - Live at Canterbury House 1968 came out, so that even seems relatively new. We're drowning in Neil Young this year, which for hardcore fans (and it seems like the percentage of his fanbase that meets this criteria increases every year) isn't such a bad thing. Add to the above the ""Neil Young Archives Official Release Series,"" which is the umbrella term for the wholesale reissue of Young's catalog in remastered form. The first four albums, from 1968's Neil Young to 1972's Harvest, were released on CD under the banner a few months back, which made the Archives set even more confusing than it seemed initially. Since much of Archives turned out to be previously issued material, with some albums appearing almost in their entirety, it stood to reason that it would serve as the best way to hear these songs for a while. Anyone ponying up between $100 and $300 for Archives surely already had all those albums, and they'll probably want the better-sounding versions in their original form, too. Young, like Bob Dylan, is almost impossible to read as far as stuff like this goes. It's easy to say that he's ripping people off by getting them to buy the same music over and over. But so many of his puzzling moves over the years, such as refusing to put out On the Beach on CD even though fans were clamoring for it, would seem to be to his financial detriment. Here's one more for the shelf: the first four albums have been packaged in two limited edition box sets. The CD version is pressed on 24-karat gold discs, and the packaging is new; the vinyl is pressed on 180-gram records (as opposed to 140-gram for the standard issue of the LPs). The vinyl set, which is what I listened to for this review, is going for $150, which certainly isn't cheap. It packages the records in extra-heavy gatefold sleeves that will probably outlive me, and includes full-size reproductions of the original inserts, but there's no extra documentation otherwise. For me, there's an irony in listening to these deluxe versions, because I've long regarded used vinyl copies of Harvest as a litmus test for record stores. If they're selling a used copy in excellent shape for $4 or $5, it's my kind of shop; if they're selling it for $8 or $9, I'm probably somewhere in the New York Metropolitan Area. Fact is, Harvest was the #1 selling album of 1972, and it continued to sell all through the 1970s. Literally millions of copies were pressed, and used copies are very easy to find. It's a record that shouldn't cost a lot of money. Which is not to say it's not a great record. All four of these albums, in fact, are excellent-- records that everyone should have in their collection eventually, in whatever format. I say ""eventually"" because Neil Young is an artist you shouldn't force yourself to get into; his most devoted fans are so convinced of his genius, and so bent on tracking down every last bootleg, that it's easy to hear a few songs and decide that Young isn't such a big deal. Sometimes it can just take a little while to come around to his music, and you need to be in the right frame of mind. Harvest, whatever your copy ends up costing you, closed out one of the stronger four-album career-opening runs in pop history. Of course, Young had some practice before he went solo, so he had a head start. After gigging around Canada as a teenager in the garage-rock outfit the Squires, he headed out to L.A. and hooked up with the newly forming Buffalo Springfield in 1966. They were a band with a few songwriters, each of whom had their own personality, and Young's songs (""For What It's Worth"", the group's biggest hit, wasn't one of them) revealed an emerging and distinctive voice. In 1968, he left the band and started his solo career, releasing Neil Young at the end of the year. The album bearing only Neil Young's name is the one that sounds least like him. It's a fine psych-tinged folk-rock set with colorful arrangements and top-shelf instrumental contributors like guitarist Ry Cooder and visionary keyboardist and arranger Jack Nitzsche, who would continue to work with Young periodically through the 70s. But Young himself sounds oddly tentative throughout, as if he weren't quite sure what he wanted his music to sound like, and this is his most restrained singing on record. There are echoes of the great music to come, like the ballad ""The Old Laughing Lady"", and the arrangements are lush and inviting, but Neil Young in a sense represents a road not taken, and it's most interesting now in comparison to what was to come. The opening riff to ""Cinnamon Girl"", the song that kicks off Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere, erases the memory of Neil Young completely in about five seconds. In the months following the release of his debut, Young hooked up with a ragtag trio of musicians from a band called the Rockets, renamed them Crazy Horse, and found his raison d'être. Where the performances on Neil Young were eminently professional, the sophisticated and exacting parts executed with polished precision, Crazy Horse were loose and sloppy, privileging groove and feeling above all. Many of Young's seasoned contemporaries considered them an embarrassment, but for him they represented a new way of thinking about music, one that favored intuition and stayed true to the moment. A year later he would hook up with the hugely successful Crosby, Stills and Nash; Young would eventually call CSNY his Beatles, while Crazy Horse was his Stones. By this logic, they were making music on the level of Sticky Fingers from the jump. Discussion of Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere usually gravitates toward the two extended guitar workouts, ""Down By the River"" and ""Cowgirl in the Sand"". Both are masterpieces of rock minimalism, demonstrating the power of repetition as the Crazy Horse rhythm section of Ralph Molina and Billy Talbot cycle through the chords and Young solos endlessly in his grimy, deeply-felt tone, playing off the subtle, prodding rhythm work of guitarist Danny Whitten. But the more compressed and accessible moments on the record are just as powerful. The title track is a brash, rollicking country-rocker in the vein of the Band, while ""Round & Round (It Won't Be Long)"" is a gorgeous acoustic ballad that finds Young, Whitten, and violinist Robin Lane engaged in three-part harmony on the achingly slow chorus. Best of all on Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere, Young sounds comfortable and confident, singing with the versatile (and hugely influential) voice that has changed remarkably little in the 40 years since. Everybody Knows was a sort of big bang for Young, a dense moment of creative explosion that saw possibilities expanding in every direction. So its follow-up was anything but a retread. With his newfound confidence, Young was poised to stretch, and After the Gold Rush sounds a bit like an overview of the Great American Songbook but with one guy writing almost all the songs. Members of Crazy Horse appear in various combinations on a few of tracks, and songs like ""Southern Man"" and ""When You Dance I Can Really Love"" have the hypnotically stoned but sneakily intense groove of the previous record. But more precisely crafted songs like ""Only Love Can Break Your Heart"", ""Birds"", and especially the astonishing title track, which has become a rock standard, show Young's gift as a writer of original melodies of extraordinary beauty in full flower. It's an aspect of Young's work that can be overlooked: the guy can write a simple tune over a chord change that hollows you out completely. Sure, the record has a phrase or two that might sound a little dippy to those with an aversion to hippies (Young was one of those, though of a very individualistic sort), but After the Gold Rush is basically unassailable. There's a reason why it's the favorite Neil Young album for so many. Which brings us back to Harvest, Young's mainstream breakthrough. Stepping away from Crazy Horse and hooking up with Nashville session musicians he dubbed the Stray Gators, Harvest finds Young experimenting again with a richer, more painstaking studio sound, but one informed by the spontaneity he'd found so inspiring. It's probably his best sounding album, and the ear tends to gravitate to the rhythm section in particular, as bassist Tim Drummond and drummer Kenny Buttrey are almost absurdly in the pocket throughout. (Here I should note that, while they certainly cost a lot of money, the vinyl pressings of these four albums live up to the hype: whisper quiet and clear but full and punchy-- these records have never sounded better). But Young's songs, though not up to the level of Gold Rush, continue his winning streak. ""Out on the Weekend"" and the title track set the table for a mellow, rootsy, and breezily melodic album, which later songs like ""Heart of Gold"" and ""Are You Ready for the Country"" continue, but Harvest has a more tormented side as well. ""A Man Needs a Maid"", recorded with the London Symphony Orchestra, is one of his stranger creations, an affecting portrait of loneliness undercut with a clumsy, lunkheaded chorus refrain, the sincerity of which has never been quite clear. ""Old Man"" is something of a signature song, laying out the wizened, long-view outlook that didn't fit with his chronological age (by the time of the record's release, Young was 26). And then there's harrowing and radiant ""The Needle and the Damage Done"": at just over two minutes, it's far too short, almost painfully so, just like the lives of the junkies it was written about. Soon enough, two people close to Young, Crazy Horse's Whitten and roadie Bruce Berry, would die from drugs. The unexpected success of Harvest, combined with the grief and guilt Young felt after Whitten and Berry died, would send Young into a dark and raw place with his next few records as he famously ""headed for the ditch"" to escape the middle of the road. Hereafter, an always-fascinating mix of success and failure would define Young's career, and along the way he'd make some pretty lousy records along with the great ones. To embrace Young as an artist after Harvest would mean accepting his many flaws (including the questionable business decisions, like the many confusing releases of this year), which have made his career unusually rich and varied as well as maddeningly inconsistent. But all that would come later. Enjoying this brilliant four-album run requires no special commitment.","Neil Young's first four albums, remastered and gathered together in a pricey (but impressive) box set.

Darkness Come Alive,Doomriders,by: Cosmo Lee,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a69b5e6ef95969320da3/1:1/w_160/e4d9f198.jpg,2009-12-10 06:00:04,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13575-darkness-come-alive/,Deathwish,"Rock, metal, and punk have long inhabited separate record store sections. But record stores are on their way out, and perhaps so are those distinctions, thanks in part to Nate Newton. His bands Converge and Doomriders feast on knocking down barriers. Converge, in which he plays bass, come from hardcore punk, but add math rock's angularity and metal's chops. Doomriders, in which Newton sings and plays guitar, also come from hardcore, but add Thin Lizzy's guitar harmonies and Motörhead's high-octane grime. The combination of punk and the 1970s rock it kicked aside might seem odd. But forget the orthodox view of punk as the Ramones/Clash class of '77; Doomriders are really descendants of the Stooges and MC5. Doomriders' debut, 2005's Black Thunder, wore its 70s influences overtly. It was also slightly tongue-in-cheek, talking about she-wolves and death marches with a wink. The irony level didn't reach that of, say, the Darkness-- Doomriders' live shows are too pummeling to be ironic-- but there was one. On Darkness Come Alive, it's gone. The title is apt, as Newton's demons now have both sonic and lyrical shape. While Gorham/Robertson harmonies still crop up, the songs focus more on lean, hard riffing. ""Bear Witness"" hugs the ground with a sport-tuned two-step, then shifts into a top fuel double-time. ""Come Alive"" is a violent, storm-tossed tribute to Danzig. Riffs are more metallic now (""Rotter"" is half Slayer, half Motörhead), and moody interludes add gloom. Instead of simply bashing it out as before, drums now rumble and grind with shifting speeds. The resulting bombed-out feel is something that Doomriders can rightly call their own. But for all the rock, metal, and punk in their mix, punk still commands the highest proportion. Newton's lyrics have gotten more personal; ""Lions"" is blunt and admonitory: ""Don't let these fuckers grind you down/ Don't let these bastards kill your soul."" That's as naked as the lyrics get. Newton isn't given to hardcore punk's typical sloganeering. But even when he waxes epic, asking that ""Light of heaven/ Be my shelter/ Please watch over me,"" he's speaking from the heart. His happens to have brass knuckles with wings tattooed over it. Now skin and flesh, though, are of a piece with the wood and metal they wield.","Converge's Nate Newton takes his band's hardcore punk roots and adds Thin Lizzy's guitar harmonies and Motörhead's high-octane grime.

Ghost,Tape Deck Mountain,by: Zach Kelly,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a77eea9e61561daa55d4/1:1/w_160/7350a79b.jpg,2009-12-10 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13757-ghost/,Lefse,"""Thinking you're a ghost, dreaming you're a ghost, being a ghost, and getting good grades in school."" That sounds either like a really fun ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" spinoff pitch or a self-described undergraduate rock project. Naturally it's the latter, but it turns out that Ghost-- the debut from the San Diego three-piece Tape Deck Mountain-- isn't able to turn its premise into something that isn't formulaic. (Come to think of it, unless Joss Whedon really was involved, that fake TV show likely wouldn't either.) Sadly then one of rising label Lefse Records' marquee fall releases is frustrating thanks to a feeling of rootlessness that stifles any chance of its finding a rhythm. On otherwise top cut ""Dead Doctors Don't Lie"", the band swaps a perfectly tenuous, lumbering 90-second stretch of feedback-slathered post-rock for three and a half minutes of corroded dialogue over an airy woodwind suite. Looped backwards. So it's not to say that Tape Deck Mountain don't have potential-- good chunks of Ghost boast bristly textures and psych-soaked noodlings that feel much richer thanks to surprisingly full-sounding production-- but it's rarely realized here, rendering this collection of songs, for the most part, inert. Like a sort of extended jam (bookended by two proper-sounding singles, ""Ghost Colony"" and ""Scantrons""-- two of the only songs that seem to truly adhere to the whole ghost/grades theme), most of the tracks bleed into one another, or borrow small pieces from their predecessor and transfigure them slightly, enough so we can discern one portion from another. Much of the spaced-out aimlessness of ""80/20"" is ramped up for that wild first quarter of ""Dead Doctors""; the irritating, bland ""F-"" is followed by the album's real highlight ""On My Honor"", which affords the album some necessary ""bigness"" it sorely lacks. Like an embryonic Spoon demo, ""Honor""'s pre-programmed bossa nova beats and dead-eyed sing-along chorus feel on the money. However, as with almost everything else on Ghost, that too is swiftly marred by frontman Travis Trevisan's flat, self-aware delivery-- ""Man down, dead on the field/ Wolves eat all of his meat/ Now I know the the pain, and I question the game,"" could've worked as pure camp, but not when presented so pensively. So even in those fleeting moments when there actually is something to sink your teeth into-- the dissonant decay on the back half of ""In the Dirt"" or the spooked-out tones on ""Ghost Colony""-- most of the energy you'll burn exercising these inane couplets from your mind (""Please don't marry that asshole Larry/ I know he'll move the place you're buried, next to me"") provides little patience for much else. Maybe it's just that Tape Deck Mountain suffer from some rare form of test anxiety. There are plenty of cues to be taken that would lead you to believe that if given a little space, TDM could properly expand some of these ideas and build something more expansive and full, most likely in a live setting. The singles might provide some of the clearest insight here: Opener ""Scantrons"" isn't very memorable, but something in Trevisan's approximation of Ian Curtis' ""Atmosphere""-cribbing lilt, coupled with those portentous drums, produces a feeling of real possibility. Even on the mundane ""Ghost Colony"" (which kind of sounds like a Thursday throw-away at half-speed), the bigger moments-- where guitars crash and sequencers explode-- offer helpful hints. But Ghost rarely does get the hint, often left too slight and too self-important for it's own good. In the future, hopefully TDM will take some time to carefully read the intructions and sharpen those No. 2s before making their mark, heavy and dark.","One of rising label Lefse Records' marquee fall releases, the debut from this San Diego three-piece is more about promise than delivery.

Television,Baaba Maal,by: Joshua Klein,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a7865e6ef95969320fd4/1:1/w_160/8d2441eb.jpg,2009-12-10 06:00:02,Global,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13760-television/,Palm,"For years, well-intentioned labels and publicists pushed Africa as some single monolithic entity rather than a collection of diverse countries, each with its own diverse musical scene. These days, of course, things are slightly different. Music from Africa is getting collected, compiled, and re-introduced on a regular country-by-country or scene-by-scene basis. Rock fans are increasingly well versed in the likes of soukos, juju, or mbalax, or the art of the kora and mbira. Heck, the late Fela Kuti, something of a cult act in the States, is currently the subject of a successful Broadway musical. Still, marketing African acts to the West remains something of an uphill slog, and that goes for established artists as well as new ones. In the past couple of years alone, I've seen both Mali's breakout Amadou & Mariam play to huge festival crowds (encouraging) but also Senegalese legend Youssou N'Dour play a less than capacity club (disheartening). Is it any wonder, then, that acts from throughout African so often seek Western assistance to help break through long-entrenched barriers? Amadou & Mariam, for example, worked with both global-pop keystone Manu Chao and Damon Albarn. Algeria's Rachid Taha regularly works with Steve Hillage. Ali Farka Toure teamed with Ry Cooder. Youssou N'Dour broke through in part thanks to his association with Peter Gabriel. And fellow Senegalese star Baaba Maal has worked with everyone from Brian Eno to reggae legend Ernest Ranglin. Admittedly, Baaba Maal has embraced most fervently his role as a pan-global fusionist, and his latest, Television, his first studio album since 2001's Missing You (Mi Yeewnii), is no exception. But while the disc was produced with Barry Reynolds (best known for his work with Grace Jones) and features musical contributions from members of the Brazilian Girls, it's a surprisingly mellow affair, generally tasteful in its eccentricities and outreach to a broader audience. On the latter front, tracks such as ""Cantaloupe"" and ""International"" come close to kitsch, the first with its cloyingly whistled melodies, the second with its awkward literal-mindedness. ""Dakar Moon"", with its flamenco guitar and English lyrics, too, comes close to crossing over into ill-conceived milquetoast territory. Other songs, however, such as the title track, ""Tindo"", and the atmospheric ""A Song for Women"", smartly and subtly find ways to bridge traditional music with contemporary technology; the song ""Television"", in fact, even concerns the effect of television's arrival in Africa. But Television is a markedly minor affair, especially once you factor in the long gap between it and its predecessor. Yes, Baaba Maal is in good voice throughout, but that voice all too often blends into the background like just another instrument, its dominance mixed down like he's almost a guest on his own disc, ceding the focus to the quiet interplay of real and programmed percussion, guitars, and synths, and particularly polyglot Brazilian Girl Sabina Sciubba. The results are perfectly pleasant but rarely inspiring, hardly sterile but at the same time too smooth. For a self-professed musical ambassador, the usually magnetic Maal simply seems too restrained, too eager to meet new listeners halfway rather than give them a compelling reason to come to him.","The Senegalese legend returns with his first album since 2001's Missing You (Mi Yeewnii).

Fantastic Mr. Fox OST,Various Artists,by: Rob Mitchum,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a77f9d034d5c69bf37ec/1:1/w_160/c3c1c316.jpg,2009-12-10 06:00:01,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13758-fantastic-mr-fox-ost/,ABKCO,"Characters in Wes Anderson movies tend to interact with and choose their own music. Max Fischer, attempting to seduce his teacher by faking a bike crash, pops a cassette of French love songs into the bedside table tape deck while her back is turned. Margot and Richie Tenenbaum, fighting incestuous desires in a child's tent, listen to two tracks off a (mis-sequenced) LP of the Rolling Stones' Between the Buttons. Steve Zissou keeps around a crew member whose sole duty seems to be perpetually covering David Bowie songs. And since it's not a stretch to assume Anderson sinks a lot of himself into his films-- the titular Fantastic Mr. Fox wears a mustard-colored corduroy suit I'm sure I've seen the director himself sport-- the intense need for music control may be the most autobiographical detail of all. For like his contemporaries Quentin Tarantino and Paul Thomas Anderson, Wes Anderson occasionally seems as obsessed with perfecting the film soundtrack as he is with the film itself. You just know Anderson has the music for his parties scripted down to the very minute: 11:43-- ""Days"" by the Kinks. But where QT and PTA, both eager scholars of film history, have habits of recycling music previously used for cinematic purposes, Anderson's musical vocabulary is more alchemical, an often brilliant combination of dusty-groove British Invasion and Mark Mothersbaugh's whimsical scores. Like most great tricks, it rapidly soured to a cliché, making Anderson's multiple slow-motion, Kinks-soundtracked scenes in The Darjeeling Limited risk lapsing into self-parody. Thankfully then, the soundtrack for Fantastic Mr. Fox is a different animal altogether, slightly more (groaaan) sly, even if it's still detail-obsessed-- it's on ABKCO Records, for cuss' sake. It's the first original score for a Wes Anderson flick not composed by Mothersbaugh (Darjeeling Limited also lacked the Devo vet, but featured music cobbled from Bollywood films); instead, the more traditional French composer Alexandre Desplat swings the baton. And other than the Rolling Stones' ""Street Fighting Man"" and several Beach Boys songs, Anderson's selections mostly veer a generation earlier than his usual picks to vocal groups, jazz, and, well, a whole lot of Burl Ives. At first glance, Anderson seemingly commits a Tarantino crime by drawing upon songs already bearing the imprint of other TV shows and movies, but there's a twist-- when they arise in the film, it's as the characters' own song choice. Because what else would funny animated animals listen to but the music of other funny animated animal entertainment? Ives was a fixture in the Rankin/Bass stop-motion holiday specials-- ""Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer"" and the like. Also featured on the record is the love song from Disney's Robin Hood and ""The Ballad of Davy Crockett"" (not an animal, but wore one on his head)-- each poured hissily out of on-screen radios in the film. The film's humans, meanwhile, sit around a campfire and listen to a puppet version of Jarvis Cocker (in a star cameo as Petey) making up a banjo song. It's cute, and as the movie nicely proves, cute ain't such a bad thing. Blending well with the quaint folk of Ives and Cocker is Desplat's score, which has all the colorful fancy you'd expect for an Anderson film meant ostensibly for children-- really existentially aware children. At first, banjo-and-strings chamber-music tracks like ""Mr. Fox in the Fields"" and ""Jimmy Squirrel and Co."" make one head-scratch over why Mothersbaugh-- someone with pretty good animation experience already-- wasn't tapped again. But as the film starts genre-hopping merrily through heist flicks, Spaghetti westerns, and war movies, Desplat's wider range helps the soundtrack keep up with the goofy march of ""Whack-Bat Majorette"" or the Morricone goof of ""Just Another Dead Rat in a Garbage Pail"". Ironically, the only part of Mr. Fox's music that feels off in the context of the film are the most Andersonish 60s-obsessed moves. Both the Beach Boys' ""Heroes and Villains"" and ""Street Fighting Man"" are jarring anachronisms even in a movie where old-timey badgers use cell phones, and stick out sorely on the record as well. Only the Bobby Fuller Four's ""Let Her Dance"" works in both media-- hopefully Anderson has learned by now that every movie he ever makes should end with all the main characters dancing to a 60s rock tune, as his best two now have. In the other one, Max Fischer, ever the obsessive director, picks ""Ooh La La"" for his last dance with Ms. Cross. With Fantastic Mr. Fox, Wes Anderson, ever the obsessive soundtracker, creates another value-added souvenir in the spirit of a literally wonderful film.","The OST to Wes Anderson's animated tale features the director's faves (the Stones, Beach Boys), plus Jarvis Cocker and composer Alexandre Desplat.

Til the Casket Drops,Clipse,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a78aea9e61561daa55ea/1:1/w_160/f9e8fd05.jpg,2009-12-10 06:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13767-til-the-casket-drops/,Columbia,"Time magazine recently declared that we're about to finish up the ""decade from hell,"" and it really does feel like people are more desperate than usual to flip the calendar and start something clean. In spite of the success they've achieved in the 2000s, count Clipse amongst that group looking to put the past 10 years behind them: After their manager got arrested for a role in an eight-figure drug ring, some of coke-rap's leading voices were put in the unusual position of having to deny they were coke dealers. While their mid-decade output was in large part defined by a combative relationship with Jive, they're now on Columbia after an ardent courtship. Hell, they don't even seem all that interested in dissing Lil Wayne anymore. With all that out of the way, when Clipse called themselves the Black Cards, it was because they were guaranteed to raise the bar for hip-hop with every verse. The Road To Till the Casket Drops mixtape actually showcased their punchlines more than their Play Cloths line. They quote Masta Ace. Albums still really matter to them. This is music by rap nerds for rap nerds. Which isn't a bad thing at all! Though Hell Hath No Fury was seen as something of a commercial brick back in 2006, three years later, their model is one that most rap groups would love to emulate. It galvanized a sustainable fanbase and opened up opportunities to precede Devendra Banhart on a Coachella stage (they ended up skipping it). And they may or may not have exchanged high-fives with Passion Pit at the 2009 mtvU Woodie Awards. So it's understandable if Clipse no longer feel like they have to actually prove shit to anyone, but perhaps that's why Til the Casket Drops awkwardly vacillates between confidence and complacency, between sneering at perceived competition and smarting at perceived and possibly self-made slights. Prior leaks ""Popular Demand (Popeyes)"" and ""Kinda Like a Big Deal"" feature sensible collaborations with Cam'ron and Kanye West, but might've done more to earn their titles back in, say, 2005-- on the former, a Yuri Gagarin reference is about the only thing that can jar you from Cam's sleepwalking verse, while Kanye does his ""Barry Bonds"" thing, completely stealing the show with the kind of class clown spitballing we've rarely heard from him since The College Dropout. Tellingly, an attempt to contemporize falls flat on ""Showing Out"": I know Clipse had a thing for T.I.'s ""Swing Ya Rag"" (it appeared on the Road To Til the Casket Drops mixtape), but trying to get Pharrell to duplicate its busy clatter without clearance issues grates, not to mention of their worst verses ever (the Lady Gaga one), and Yo Gotti spitting generic ""go hard, lil' daddy"" hustle raps that go nowhere. Not only does Til the Casket Drops refuse to settle into a groove, but you know right from opener ""Freedom"" that this is a very different kind of record from Clipse. The first track on a Clipse LP without production by the Neptunes (former Bad Boy associates and American Gangster curators Sean C & LV did it instead), ""Freedom""'s rock star geetar and live drums are a jarring shift from the desiccated, merciless clangor of Hell Hath No Fury. But the schizo production actually fits the uneven topicality as well as the truly dangerous sonics of Hell Hath No Fury fit Clipse's anger. While that album's relatively celebratory tracks (""Dirty Money"", ""Ride Around Shinin"") only amplified the amorality and emptiness that surrounded them, ""Door Man"", ""Never Will It Stop"", and ""Popular Demand (Popeyes)"" defiantly wave knots of hundreds. Clipse are far weaker at creating what they might term ""lifestyle music,"" which comprises most of Casket's side B. The mesmerizingly awful ""I'm Good"" is pure Velveeta, and the guys hardly bother to dignify this garishly fluorescent cheese with even a decent punchline. And the problem with the Keri Hilson feature ""All Eyes on Me"" and ""Counseling"" isn't the mere fact that they could pass for late-90s rap'n'b; it's that they could be late-90s softbatch rap'n'b from anyone-- Clipse are strangely anonymous in these contexts. There's no doubt that Clipse are an unusually introspective and self-aware group, but particularly since We Got It 4 Cheap, Vol. 3, you get the feeling they've been reading too much of their own press, however positive it's been. They know that some of their own fans have pigeonholed them as strictly criminologists (""Mistook my work for solely crack/ You should've got more out of it than that"") or martyrs in label warfare. (Pusha T describes the ""self-made prison"" of the music business in ""Freedom"" and ends his verse saying, ""my critics finally have a verse of mine to jerk off to."") On the reflective ""Footsteps"", Malice confides that an associate's prison sentence ""weighs on my conscience, and I hate conscious rap."" Earlier, Pusha calls himself ""Common on his 'D-Boy,"" and promising the truth ""no matter how bland it is."" As fascinating as this self-reckoning can be, it ultimately expresses why Til the Casket Drops is so uneven: It's Clipse questioning their perceived current fans (backpackers who got into ""Grindin'"") while trying to make amends with those they perceive to have lost (girls who got into ""Ma, I Don't Love Her"").

Jarvik Mindstate,Peverelist,by: Jess Harvell,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a7849d034d5c69bf37fc/1:1/w_160/69c4b552.jpg,2009-12-09 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13765-jarvik-mindstate/,Punch Drunk,"Peverelist's music is so thoroughly dubstep that I can't imagine anyone other than hardcore fans of the genre will get much out of it. You can recommend, say, Burial or Joker to dubstep newbies because at least the former's vocals and the latter's psychedelic touches might provide a way ""in"" to (more or less) instrumental music that can be pretty forbidding in its starkness. How do you review an album like Jarvik Mindstate, which could care less about the needs of listeners from outside the scene, for a general interest-ish publication like Pitchfork without shrugging through a 600 word ""caveat emptor""? So please understand that Jarvik Mindstate is not an album designed for indie rockers looking to spice up their iPods. Peverelist is making music for people like himself, people who've been following the UK's bass-centric and heavily syncopated post-jungle dance scene for most of its decade-plus history. That said, if you've got the Forward logo tattooed on your forearm and know Zed Bias' real name (without consulting Wikipedia), there are pleasures to be found here, most them nostalgia-based. As someone who's spent far too much money on UK dance imports myself, I enjoy the way the jittery loop on ""Yesterday I Saw the Future"" echoes the ""nature sounds"" ambiance once found on hundreds of Good Looking-era jungle tracks. And the title track is another intriguing, gloom-drunk Bristolian twist on acid house minimalism, just with the BPM turned down a bit since the days of Full Cycle and V. Faint praise, perhaps, but it'd be fibbing to say these tracks are going to inspire people to grab non-ravers by the lapels and force them to listen. Perhaps, like me, you're a long-time dance fan who still enjoys hearing someone remodel old genres (jungle, techno, IDM) into new shapes (dubstep), provided the producer in question is overflowing with wit/invention/idiosyncracies. Burial wasn't exactly doing much ""new"" either, at least if you'd heard a few Dem 2 and Horsepower Productions singles, something the producer has all but admitted in interviews. But at least he brought his own curious obsessions (that downcast vibe, that weather-beaten fidelity) to the always potentially ignoble art of influence mining. The real problem with Jarvik Mindstate is that there's just not much personality on display. It's a competent genre exercise that hovers right on the dangerous edge between ""pleasant diversion"" and ""inessentiality.""","One of dubstep's key producers makes his full-length album debut, with few concessions for non-fans for good or bad.

Kids Aflame,ARMS,by: Jessica Suarez,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a776ea9e61561daa55bf/1:1/w_160/3751d600.jpg,2009-12-09 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13751-kids-aflame/,Gigantic,"When Harlem Shakes called it quits earlier this year, it was less than six months after they had released their debut LP, Technicolor Health. Disappointing to see such a nice-guy band halt like that, but Kids Aflame, the first album from Harlem Shakes guitarist Todd Goldstein, shows that he, at least, has a lot left in him. Goldstein's solo project ARMS actually predates Harlem Shakes. But this album, which was released in Europe in early 2009 (the U.S. version comes with a couple of bonus tracks), feels as if it were recorded in bedrooms and on borrowed time. And it sounds nothing like Harlem Shakes. There's a lo-fi gauze wrapped around everything, though there are some nice nuances built into the layers. Take ""Whirring"" (the first song proper, following a half-minute of scene-setting texture), which bursts into a jangly, feverish tune with a hook reminiscent of Dinosaur Jr. This sense of familiarity occurs often throughout Kids Aflame, for better and worse. Some of it's due to the mostly unvarying instrumentation, though the sleepy title track is built on a ukulele, while ""Pocket"" gets a second boost of frantic energy from its closing horn melody. Kids Aflame feels like a solo album in another respect: Goldstein captures, in his croony baritone, that mixture of loneliness and anxiety that can come even when you're surrounded by people. Both ""Sad, Sad, Sad"" and ""Shitty Little Disco"" seem to be about that uncomfortable moment at a bad party when you either leave early or stay far, far, too long, drinking in a corner. Other songs are wrapped in metaphor-- Goldstein seems especially captivated by body parts that come in twos. Luckily we have plenty-- ARMS, legs that break, and eyeballs where he would ""...crack those orbs at the seams/ And suck out the juice/ I'd use those eyelashes as brooms to clean up my house."" In that song, ""Eyeball"", Goldstein delivers this quirky-creepy line in the same tone he uses on every other song. You can hear a little Bright Eyes in the way Goldstein chooses to begin his songs softly, building towards a fuzzy, messy climax. And while I'm no fan of Bright Eyes' melodrama, Goldstein's voice could use a little shaking up. Even in the first-person stories Goldstein feels like an observer, albeit one with a negative bias. Still, ARMS makes for an interesting contrast to Harlem Shakes' eternal optimism.","Ex-Harlem Shakes guitarist offers his first solo album of mostly unvarying, lo-fi instrumentation, which sounds nothing like Harlem Shakes.

Zounds,Dappled Cities,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6d59d034d5c69bf3639/1:1/w_160/f3b8adb8.jpg,2009-12-09 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13623-zounds/,Dangerbird,"Sydney, Australia's Dappled Cities are ambitious. They make widescreen music full of big gestures and sweeping melodies, and on this, their third album, they sound bigger than ever. Credit this partially to the addition of a small string section on a few songs, but far more to keyboardist Ned Cooke asserting himself at the heart of the band's sound. He provides huge textural washes and spiky riffs on just about every song, blowing the band's sound up from something that was already big on 2006's Granddance to something that sounds like it could make the jump to a stadium any time it wanted. The arcade fire burns a little Down Under too, apparently. While Cooke's more prominent role has changed the sonics a bit, the band remains built around the tension between the contrasting styles of guitarist/vocalists Dave Rennick and Tim Derricourt. Rennick is the theatrical one, opening ""The Night Is Young at Heart"" by crooning, ""Would you be open to a night of total chaos?"" shouting the last word of the line at the top of his lungs as Cooke's keyboards squiggle all around him. Derricourt is his calm, straightforward counterpart, delivering the tumbling verses of ""Kid"" in a smooth stream that rises to the rapids of the bashing chorus, and providing a direct foil on ""Miniature Alas"", where he provides the verse and leaves joins Rennick on the chorus, where the two making a distinctive pairing. Derricourt sing out a little more on lead single ""The Price"", possibly because he's competing with the sheet of strings and synthesizer that deliver the song's huge opening theme. The chorus is massive. While the use of two main vocalists provides instant variety, the band is also keen to explore a variety of moods over the course of the record. ""Don't Stop There"" is the closest thing to a ballad, moving at a spooky crawl, the keyboard theme doubled by a guitar to create a theme that's harmonically off-center and consequently quite otherworldly. Opener ""Hold Your Back"" comes in with a frenetic keyboard part that sounds like a descendent of Yes' ""Changes"" or Pink Floyd's ""One Slip"", but the song moves from there into a pensive, spacey main section that constantly threatens to turn bombastic but never does. At the other end of the record, big, choral vocals give ""Stepshadows"" a strangely nautical feel over a beat reminiscent of the shuffle of Paul Simon's ""Graceland"". Cooke uses a bizarre trumpet-ish sound for the opening fanfare of ""Wooden Ships"", lending the song a strangely medieval feel behind Derricourt's falsetto verse vocal. Dappled Cities haven't quite acquired a big reputation outside their homeland yet, but it seems likely they will. If they keep making big, boisterous records like this that are unafraid to be a little ridiculous in places, they'll have to.","Sydney band with prog leanings and widescreen inclinations blows up its sound even further this time out.

"White Water, White Bloom",Sea Wolf,by: Joshua Love,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a7745e6ef95969320fa7/1:1/w_160/b3d6c9fb.jpg,2009-12-09 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13749-white-water-white-bloom/,Dangerbird,"L.A.-based pop-rockers Sea Wolf snagged a spot on the soundtrack for the newest Twilight film, New Moon, and while the band's inclusion certainly didn't cause as much of a stir as that of, say, Thom Yorke or Grizzly Bear, appearing on the chart-topping compilation may prove to be a bigger boon to this group's career than to any of the other acts that participated. That's not just because the soundtrack is selling well and getting Sea Wolf's name out to the listening public in general, but more because the kind of person who is most likely to be voraciously devouring the album is also exceedingly susceptible to becoming smitten with the rest of Sea Wolf's oeuvre-- specifically, young people (mostly girls) with a weakness for moody romance and natural imagery. Should any of these Twilight acolytes be compelled by Sea Wolf's New Moon offering, ""The Violet Hour"", to seek out the band's newest album, White Water, White Bloom, they'll be welcomely rewarded with a collection of swoony, melodic songs delivered with aching sincerity by lead singer and songwriter Alex Brown Church, and featuring more sighingly idealized poetic images and symbols than you can shake a stick at-- orchards in the snow, morning dew, constellations, and ""a pheasant's feather,"" just to name a few. Presumably, anyone a bit older and perhaps musically savvier will hear Sea Wolf and immediately recognize that, sonically at least, they've already heard this all before from Bright Eyes and the Arcade Fire, as White Water, White Bloom, the band's second full-length LP (and first as a proper band and not simply a solo endeavor for Church), breaks no new ground. Opener ""Wicked Blood"" bites the Arcade Fire's exact aesthetic (chugging guitars, swelling strings, quavering vocals, simple but weighty piano melody) to an almost litigious extent, and while the remainder of the album is perhaps not quite as egregious, virtually every song is blatantly beholden to something that's going to be incredibly familiar to any halfway-avid fan of indie-rock. ""Orion & Dog"", ""The Orchard"", and the title track are the cuts most overtly indebted to Conor Oberst (particularly from a vocal standpoint), but Sea Wolf actually pillages inspiration from throughout the entire family tree of literate folk-rock, echoing not only Oberst mentors like Tom Petty (""Turn the Dirt Over"") and R.E.M. (the intro to the title track) but even the granddaddies of the form, the Byrds, on the album-closing ""Winter's Heir"". I can't deny Church is a solid craftsman capable of cranking out extremely inviting pop-rock hooks, but this ground is so well-trod that it's hard to find anything to get even a little bit excited about here unless you're relatively new to indie-rock patronage. A friend of mine who saw Sea Wolf in concert recently testified to the abundance of young attendees who seemed pretty obviously to have been turned on to the band via New Moon. If nothing else, White Water, White Bloom ought to convince plenty of those kids to join Team Alex.","Swoony, melodic songs delivered with aching sincerity-- no wonder this fit so well on the Twilight soundtrack.

Music For Insomnia,Lowell Brams,by: Rob Mitchum,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a788ea9e61561daa55e8/1:1/w_160/a278fcd9.jpg,2009-12-09 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13766-music-for-insomnia/,Asthmatic Kitty,"If you plug ""music and insomnia"" into PubMed-- the online library of scientific journal articles-- you get 24 results. Scientists have tested the ability of music to induce sleep in a wide variety of populations, from nurses and elementary school kids to abused women and senior citizens. And perhaps not surprisingly, it usually seems to work, improving parameters like time to sleep onset, nighttime awakenings, and longer sleep duration-- no news to this reviewer, who spent one entire tense year using Sigur Rós as a cheaper form of Ambien. A lot of these studies are opaque about the specific music actually used to induce sleep, but in one-- a 2005 paper from Case Western Reserve University-- there's a genre rundown: ""synthesizer (new age), harp (eclectic), piano (popular oldies), orchestra (classical), and slow jazz."" Music for Insomnia, the latest in Asthmatic Kitty Records' Library Catalog Music Series, is none of these, though it may perhaps be all of them. Credited to Lowell Brams, the co-founder of Asthmatic Kitty, and featuring contributions from his stepson (and the other co-founder) Sufjan Stevens and Bryce Dessner of the National, it's a record that most definitely would not have been used in any sleep research. Were Music for Insomnia's eight abstract tracks to induce sleep, it would likely be a pretty agitated sort. A good two-thirds of the music here is straight-up nightmare fuel, avant-garde experimentalism that resists any traditional rhythmic or melodic landing points and triggers physiological reactions of discomfort and paranoia more than relaxation and peacefulness. Consider opener ""Chattering Garden Trolls"", where even the title suggest a sadistic sort of slumberland. Within, Brams and his compatriots establish the project's palette: a bed of wheezing, dark drones where fragments of drums, guitar, and synthesizer phase in and out, like a box full of instruments falling down a long flight of stairs, very slowly and irregularly. It's sinister as hell, and yet doesn't hold a candle to the feedback shrieks of ""Short Circadian Partita"" or the 12-plus minutes of ""Hypnagogic Hallucination"", where the mélange is joined by the kind of high-pitched piano runs that usually foretell that a sorority girl is about to get stabbed by a dude in a mask. Also as lengthy is the far more soothing ""Alpha to Theta"", where a pixie-like synthesizer zips through the gaps of fluttery guitar and piano, producing a glittery soundscape reminiscent of Stevens' electronic Enjoy Your Rabbit, though less rhythmic. The only regular-tempo respite of Music for Insomnia is found on ""Dream About Vince Guaraldi"", where a gently chugging preset and an optimistic bassline provides some much-needed structure as the synthesizers frolic and a wah-wah effect chimes in. Dessner shows up only on the last track, ""A Cross Section of Clown Mountain""-- by far the least busy track on the entire collection and another feedback world. But unlike ""Short Circadian Partita"", Dessner's involvement lends the track some forward motion, journeying from eerie beginnings to finding beauty in the feedback currents at the resolution. It's also the only track that could ethically be used in a study of music and insomnia, as one could easily see a person's tension and consciousness melting away along its quiet path.","Asthmatic Kitty co-founder teams with his partner and stepson, Sufjan Stevens, and the National's Bryce Dessner for a record of avant-garde experimentalism.

Light: On the South Side,Various Artists,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a764ea9e61561daa558f/1:1/w_160/6a799640.jpg,2009-12-08 06:00:04,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13736-light-on-the-south-side/,Numero Group,"A camera is a window through which a photographer interacts with the world, and it's up to the operator to decide whether his camera will be a barrier or a mirror between he and his subjects. In the 1970s, Michael Abramson chose the latter path when he brought his camera to Pepper's Hideout on Chicago's South Side. Following in the footsteps of his acknowledged influence Gyula Halász, a Hungarian photographer better known as Brassaï who became the pre-eminent chronicler of the Paris nightlife he loved so much, Abramson insinuated himself into the nightlife of Chicago's predominantly black neighborhoods. He was very much a part of the scene he documented on film, drinking, laughing, and dancing with his subjects into small hours and becoming as much a part of the atmosphere as the locals who frequented the same nightspots he did. Numero Group has done a fair amount of work to preserve and document the South Chicago music scene of the 60s and 70s, releasing Eccentric Soul volumes on the Twinight and Bandit labels, reissuing Boscoe's phenomenal self-titled LP, and now giving us this set, which pairs a huge book of Abramson's striking photographs from Pepper's Hideout and its more risque counterpart, Perv's House, with a disc of music that mirrors the photos' sexuality and good humor. Abramson contributes a very short explanatory essay, but his black-and-whites are presented on their own, without captions, which is the best way to present them in this context. The intent of the project isn't journalistic after all. The whole package is built to include you in a party you likely never got to go to. In addition to Abramson's photos, there are scanned flyers for blues and soul shows, the front and back of Abramson's own Player's Playground Card-- which granted him admission to Perv's House-- and an assortment of business cards from the old regulars. The picture here is of a lively, vibrant scene where people came to have fun and forget about daily problems. They clown, preen, and pose for the camera at times, but for the most part they just do their thing while Abramson snaps away, capturing them in half-lidded, off-balance, smiling, yawning, ecstatic, and joyful moments. In a Facebook era, this might not seem unusual, but it's not often you see a cameraphone grab that preserves a moment with such honest artistry as the images included here. There's a reason Abramson's work is owned by museums. The accompanying disc of music is aptly subtitled Pepper's Jukebox, and though it lacks the archival and informational thoroughness that's become Numero's hallmark, it does provide a perfect soundtrack for the images. These are the songs they danced and laughed to, and the emphasis is one gritty, funky blues tunes. There's plenty of wailing harmonica and scratchy guitar, a hefty dose of double entendre and lots of plain great songs. Bobby Rush's classic ""Bowlegged Women, Knock-Kneed Man"" is a roaring and not really veiled tribute to the joys of doing it, and it's just the tip of the iceberg. Arelean Brown's ""I Am a Streaker"" works in similar territory, and she's not afraid to talk up her attributes: I'm built like an outhouse/ With not a brick out of place.../ Chest like headlights on a pimp's car..."" There are cool oddities, like the instrumental version of Syl Johnson's epochal soul cut ""Is It Because I'm Black"", and a bit of social commentary on Lucille Spann's gravel-voiced ""Women's Lib"", but the best songs get right to the heart of the blues. Willie Davis' ""I Learned My Lesson"" is flat-out powerful, with deep, dark verses and a ragged, finger-blistering guitar solo; it's a masterclass of smoky Chicago blues. On ""You Made Me Suffer"", Andrew Brown brings his blues noir into the funky 70s, mixing his lead guitar with heavy soul vocals and a popping drumbeat. Taken together, the photo book and the disc offer a taste of what it might have been like inside Pepper's Hideout on a good night, and it seems like most nights at Pepper's were good nights. That scene is long gone today, so the opportunity to get an outsider's peek in is appreciated. It's also a rarity in the mp3 era to make such a complete experience out of music and packaging, and the package here is outstanding. Come for the sights, stay for the sounds. And don't be afraid to have a good time.","Numero Group create their most lavish package yet-- a look at the 1970s Chicago soul scene, complete with a book full of Michael Abramson photography.

"How to Be a Lady, Volume 1",Electrik Red,by: Tim Finney,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6c25e6ef95969320df6/1:1/w_160/d844748a.jpg,2009-12-08 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13606-how-to-be-a-lady-volume-1/,Def Jam,"""I'm not a freak, I'm not a nasty ho... well I'm lying, but I'm classy though,"" Electrik Red member Binkie extemporizes on ""Muah"", the opener to the R&B group's debut album, How to Be a Lady, Volume 1. It's not the first evidence that the album's title is very much tongue in cheek. For Electrik Red, class is a nebulous quality, synonymous with an amorphous girl power cobbled together from the last decade of hip-hop and R&B femme fatales (Beyoncé, Lil' Kim, Kelis, Ciara). Accordingly, Electrik Red see no contradiction between slave-driving dominance (""W.F.Y."") and slavish submission (""Bed Rest""), modern female independence (""Friend Lover"") and its easy loss (""So Good""), mercantile sexual consumerism (""P Is for Power"") and incommensurate sexual generosity (""Devotion""). If that sounds like a criticism, it's not meant to be: Electrik Red understand that we don't know what we want even when we sound like we do; if they seem to conflate love and sex a little too freely, well, life's like that when the going's good. It's not a concept album, but if How to Be a Lady has a central concept, it's that of the fling, the romantic rendezvous that starts off as something fun and ends up much more intense and involved. And the music feels like a fling, too, its easy comforts concealing more mysterious, urgent impulses. Mostly written and produced by R&B singer The-Dream and his in-house production team (C. ""Tricky"" Stewart, L.O.S. Da Mystro), the album features that same penchant for intoxicatingly lush, swirly slow jams and rococo, information-overload uptempo tracks that characterize The-Dream's own work, not to mention lyrics that alternate between perfect, ridiculous, and perfectly ridiculous (""Tonight's the night, so baby order/ Now I'm biting on your body like an hors doeurve""). Undeniably, Electrik Red are contemporary R&B formula: four harmonizing and occasionally rapping vocalists covering the spectrum from breathy innocence to sly rasp; overripe synthetic productions drunk on 1980s Prince, R Kelly, and Polow Da Don; a near total obliviousness to matters outside of sex and dancing and their attendant concerns. Their confidence is the confidence of an entire genre, detached from the hallmarks of individualism that traditionally attract plaudits, such that it doesn't really matter whether it's Lesley or Naomi who takes time out from ""W.F.Y."" to compliment you on that thing that you do with your tongue (""Amazing. Stupendous. Marvelous. Exciting."") but then criticize you for wearing skinny jeans. How to Be a Lady is filled with gratuitous little surprises: the absurd and brilliant cod-operatic backing vocals in the rococo chorus of ""Freaky Freaky""; the commanding dance instructions (""Cup, sip, yep... yurrr/ Two step, stop... yurrr"") that interrupt the icy club banger ""Drink in My Cup""; the sudden shard of inadvertent melancholy that invades the breezy ""Friend Lover"" as Naomi tells her friend with benefits, ""You can't stay past five/ I gotta be at work by nine!"" Such moments make Electrik Red's music feel as real and lived-in as dazzling, shiny R&B can hope to, possessing a capacity for rightness that cannot be reduced to lyrical sophistication, performative flair, or production novelty, but is borne of the kind of charisma you can possess when you take success for granted. And because Electrik Red take it for granted, it's tempting to adopt the same stance as listener; but these songs have already outsmarted you. As ""So Good"" puts it, ""I shouldn't have let you hit that/ 'Cause now I can't forget that.""","With production by The-Dream and his cohorts, this R&B group's debut features lush slow jams and rococo, information-overload uptempo tracks.

Here are the other questions: What led drummer Jarle Vespestad to leave the band? Okay, well, that's a gossipy question-- his personal and professional reasons are his own. But does Supersilent want us to know he left the band? The liner notes, as always, refuse to list the personnel, and they do not mention that the quartet has become a trio. You might've noticed that the drums are missing, except that the remaining players have completely changed their instruments: For the session that produced this record, all three members played nothing but Hammond Organ. And that's not mentioned in the liner notes either. But I go back to their proficiency on the instrument, because it's key to what makes this so special-- if not successful. While regular keyboardist Ståle Storløkken probably knows his way around the Hammond, I can't tell whether Arve Henriksen is as comfortable on the organ as he is on trumpet. Producer and electronic noisemaker Helge Sten is probably responsible for the album's extreme dynamic range, which is half the show: What they play is far less engrossing than how they amplify it, sometimes excruciatingly, with the rotation of the Leslie speakers raised to a gale force bellow. You're pulled so close to the guts of the organ that by the end you'll think you could build one yourself. The first half of ""9.2"" simulates how it must sound to be eaten alive-- at least until the second half, when one player starts a loose vamp and the other two improvise against it. But in the back half of the album, the storm ends and the players switch to a hush. ""9.3"" is ambient and gentle, almost absent-mindedly turning upbeat at the end, and ""9.4"" grows so static that it's not even a dirge: It's lovely to listen to but bereft of tension. Which is why I'm so curious about whether they're ""good"" on the Hammond. On past dates I took it for granted that each member of the band was an excellent musician, and yet musicianship is rarely what draws the ear to their music. Like early Pink Floyd, they engaged in an exploration that was unrehearsed and maybe even naïve. The band tried to sound like something other than the sum of its parts-- and by emerging from free and unrehearsed improvisation, the music resisted containers. By the time Supersilent recorded 8, the members were inextricable from one another, the wails and ballads emerged organically, and their apparent goal-- of creating spontaneous, non-idiomatic, and exhilarating music-- was reached again and again. But this time, it sounds like they're winging it in front of us-- thrilling themselves with new discoveries one minute, and the next, batting around ideas that go nowhere. Is the organ lineup here to stay? (Probably not: Storløkken has said they'll be back to their usual instruments when they tour next year.) Is the pervasive melancholy a stylistic choice, a side effect of working without percussion, or an emotional reaction to losing one-fourth of their musical organism? Will Supersilent survive, evolve, or die? Whatever the future holds, this is some of the riskiest improv the band has ever recorded: In every moment of the album, you can hear all three guys trying to figure out where to go next.","The mysterious and often rapturous Norwegian avant-garde collective releases its first record as a trio.

But it's M.A.N.D.Y.'s continual crossfader curveballs-- the gleeful ease with which the German duo blends in tasty bits from across rave history-- that will make older listeners take a second listen to what appears on first glance to be yet another tasteful compilation of recent DJ fodder. Renaissance: The Mix Session is that rare up-to-date dance document with room for beats-and-bass legends like Dynamix II and electronic-indie hybrids like Junior Boys and Schneider TM. M.A.N.D.Y. have used the platform provided by UK superclub imprint Renaissance-- which once meant you'd ascended to the ranks of dance music's money-making populist frontline-- to put together a history-lesson-cum-slow-burn showcase, rather than a cutesy game of connect-the-dots between Old Tune X and New Tune Y. The oldest selection is the Black Dog's ""Virtual"", first released in 1989, which blends so perfectly with DJ Koze's 2009 ""Mrs. Bojangels"" that proto-IDM and 21st-century freak-house are revealed as kissing cousins. At 40-plus tracks, there's enough new-ish music from all the usual Euro suspects to keep fans of spacey and streamlined late-aughts dance music happy well into 2010. But it's the outré and half-forgotten stuff, the odd little hooks and nostalgia-triggering throwbacks, strewn among the austere beeps and pulses, that will keep you coming back. Like the quasi-noise/rock weirdness from Gang Gang Dance; Sebastien Tellier's laid-back flutes and strings, the kind of super-pungent Francophile kitsch that will leave you shaking your head with bemused laughter; and Gui Boratto's remix of Bomb the Bass, which features the best (and moodiest) riff of the set, the kind New Order should still be cranking out. The Mix Session is hardly the mini-masterpiece that was M.A.N.D.Y.'s 2005 Body Language, which was similarly broad-minded while sticking to mostly then-current material. Instead of going era-defining, M.A.N.D.Y's eschewed a seamless run-through of 2009's greatest hits in order to craft that ere-rare dance music object: the idiosyncratic commercial mix CD that's both ""deep"" and pop-friendly. It takes guts to include a killer record-- like, say, Felix Da Housecat's ""Silver Screen (Shower Scene)""-- that's old but not quite yet ""classic."" You risk being greeted with groans from the innovation-fixated cranks that comprise a large chunk of your audience. Maybe you think it's troubling that M.A.N.D.Y. have managed to stand out from the identikit minimal/deep pack simply by tossing in some moldy oldies-but-goodies, but I find their cross-genre/decade fearlessness refreshing. If nothing else we can all agree that it's surely the only mix we'll ever see to feature both Robag Wruhme and Mark Lanegan, Dominik Eulberg and P.

Elvis 75: Good Rockin' Tonight,Elvis Presley,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a77fea9e61561daa55d8/1:1/w_160/387a5ebf.jpg,2009-12-08 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13762-elvis-75-good-rockin-tonight/,LegacyRCA,"In 1992, Bono recorded a solo version of ""Can't Help Falling in Love"" for the Honeymoon in Vegas soundtrack. His take on the song is slow and somber, with almost no instrumentation save a bit of percussion. Filling out the sonic space is a recording of an Elvis Presley press conference, which finds him answering a few random questions, including one about what he's been reading. Elvis begins his replies with ""Yes sir"" or ""No sir,"" like the polite Southern boy he was, and he sounds distant, careful not to say anything that might offend. I suspect that Bono included this spoken bit because it represented for him a theme he had explored a few years earlier on U2's ""Elvis Presley and America"", a murky, hazy track found on The Unforgettable Fire that some see as filler but which I've always found fascinating. ""Elvis Presley and America"" and Bono's version of ""Can't Help Falling in Love"" both speak to one of Elvis' fundamental contradictions: How can singer say so much-- through someone else's song, even-- and then find feelings and ideas so hard to articulate away from music? Elvis now occupies a strange place in music in part because he was never a songwriter. Long ago, of course, very few singers were also writers, but the 1960s changed much of that. After Bob Dylan and the Beatles, there was an expectation that the words that came from the singer's mouth also originated in his brain. There have been many exceptions, some of them significant (disco comes to mind), but a strong sense of agency has continued to be important. Present-day pop singers who aren't writers (and most of the major ones have writer credits) still take pains to position their albums as personal statements. A rite of passage for a pop singer is the album that says, ""This is me-- this is what I'm all about."" Celine Dion is an outlier in this regard, but the list of singers of her ilk is not long. We've been conditioned to want some sort of direct line to the artist's point of view. With so much of Elvis' music, the sense that it reflected something about how he felt about the world wasn't there in quite the same way. This doesn't diminish his accomplishments, which are massive and undeniable, but it does mean that as new generations discover him, they'll be hearing him differently. Over the years, Elvis' estate and RCA have taken a few different tacks to position him as a vital musical force and win him new fans. In the early 1990s, the hardcore devotees and serious music obsessives hit the jackpot, as RCA and BMG released three well-received box sets totaling 15 CDs, which together offered a searching overview of his entire career, dividing his output by decade. The sheer scope of that reissue project, and its ultimate success (two of the sets went platinum, the other gold), affirmed that Elvis was an artist worth exploring in minute detail, with musical treasures that extended well beyond his dozens of top 10 hits. But the last of these boxes came out almost 15 years ago. Since then, as the ranks of those who had their minds blown after seeing him on ""Ed Sullivan"" continues to thin, Elvis' place in music seems a little less assured. ELV1S, a collection of his #1 hits released in 2002, sold well, but it still had nowhere near the impact of the Beatles' 1, upon which it was obviously modeled. It's tempting, in a year in which the Beatles catalog was remastered and Michael Jackson's music hit the charts after his untimely death, to stack Elvis up against these giants and see how he fares. Is he reaching new generations of fans? Are download-happy kids looking for ways to flesh out their Elvis mp3 collections? Good Rockin' Tonight, a 4xCD box set commemorating the 75th anniversary of Elvis' birth and covering his entire career-- from his first acetate in 1953 to the 2002 remix of ""A Little Less Conversation""-- could be seen as an attempt to answer the question of what he means today in a relatively succinct package (there are 100 songs here, but he recorded more than 700). There's little for the fans that own those decade sets-- the 50's Masters box was complete, and the 60s and 70s collections hit just about every highlight-- but Good Rockin' Tonight offers a thorough and well-rounded look at a seminal artist for those who might know only a handful of hits. There are a few songs from his gospel records, which are usually cordoned off from his pop work on Elvis comps, as well as selections from his many film soundtracks (these were omitted from the 60s box) and some live cuts. The lot is sequenced in chronological order according to when it was cut, and you come away from this set with a good sense of how his music developed and changed over the 24 years of his recording life. Ironically, because Elvis was not a songwriter and was so guarded about what he shared with the public, his music ends up having an odd sort of purity. All we have is surfaces-- the grain of his vocal, his phrasing, video and film images showing us how he moved (indeed, the easiest way into Elvis for newbies may well be YouTubes of performance footage from 1956 or the 68 comeback special, where his charisma, confidence, and physical beauty are as astonishing as ever). So in one sense, the story of this box set is the story of that virtuosic and unmistakable voice, how it grew and adapted and bent songs to fit Elvis' vision of what they should be. ""Jailhouse Rock"" has one of rock history's greatest snare sounds, but it's Elvis' half-screamed phrasing that makes it sound like a world-changing anthem. The assurance and richness of Elvis' tone on ""Love Me Tender"" is striking, but remembering when reading the set's well-done documentation that he was only 21 when he recorded it amplifies its depth. There's the drive and warmth of his tone on ""(Marie's the Name) His Latest Flame"", one of his more enduring second-tier hits, as Elvis seems to stick his neck out in the verses and then come back to a more assured place for the chorus. On ""Suspicious Minds"", he establishes a tone of anxiety and yearning and masterfully sustains it through the song's entire length without becoming tiring. And on into the 70s, when his hits were more likely to land only on the country charts, there's the big-hearted generosity of his version of the now-standard ""Always on My Mind"", showing how easily he could do simplicity when it was needed. For a singer whose vocal tics are so widely known that they became nuggets of pop culture history, the emotional range and variety of Elvis' singing here is extraordinary. There are plenty of revelations here for those who know only the biggest singles. ""How Great Thou Art"" and ""Crying in the Chapel"", two cuts from Elvis' 1967 gospel album, How Great Thou Art, feature over-the-top arrangements, but Elvis brings a palpable vocal intensity to the material-- these were songs he is said to have felt very deeply, and that's the way they come across. ""Pocketful of Rainbows"", a tune from G.I. Blues, with its thick reverb and spacious arrangement, sounds oddly contemporary, a haunting but straightforward bit of mid-century pop. To use a recent touchstone, you can just about trace Richard Hawley's entire oeuvre to it. Like the gospel cuts and 1963's ""I Need Someone to Lean On"", an ultra lean ballad with a cocktail jazz tone, it shows a side to Elvis' singing that hasn't been overexposed, and it still sounds terrifically fresh. Just as Elvis' voice pushed decent material into the realm of greatness, so it managed to wring something out of a duff song. ""Bossa Nova Baby"" is one of Leiber and Stoller's lyrically fuzzier and more dated creations, and it has the added handicap of not being not especially fun, but Elvis almost makes it worth hearing again. ""T-R-O-U-B-L-E"" from 1975 is a bland, unconvincing attempt to recapture the early rock'n'roll energy, and there are a couple of early ""That's All Right"" re-writes here that don't impress. But with the energy Elvis brought to his singing in the 50s, it didn't much matter. Even where the songs fail to connect as songs-- and for me there quite a few here-- Elvis' presence often redeems them. For music fans who have trouble following along with Elvis' Vegas shtick as his career wore on, it's a cliché to say that the Sun Sessions, those recordings Elvis made in Memphis before he was nationally famous, are the best thing he ever did. And while I won't make that argument, considering how much he developed and expanded what he could do as he went on, the six tracks here from those sessions have lost nothing and still resonate, and I'm probably more likely to play ""Blue Moon of Kentucky"" than just about anything here. Elvis sounds like a teenager (which he was) who is just starting to realize the thrilling power of his gifts. But oddly, the next track I'm likely to play is ""Unchained Melody"", the second to last cut on the set, recorded in 1977 during one of his final shows. As you can see from a stirring YouTube, Elvis during this period is bloated, caked in horrifying makeup, and drugged, a shell of a man only months away from death. But somehow, sitting down at the piano, he manages to wring something out of this song that no one else had imagined. It's garish, operatic, and morbid, and I feel a little guilty for how much I love it; Elvis failed in so many ways, but this was his one untouchable thing, and I love hearing him do it in spite of it all, speaking to the world in the one language he thoroughly mastered. That the song to follow it and close out Good Rockin' Tonight is the bland and forgettable big beat remix of ""A Little Less Conversation"", commissioned for Nike's 2002 World Cup campaign, is a reminder of how easily that communication can become garbled.","To mark Elvis' 75th birthday, Legacy issues a new 4xCD, 100-song box set drawing from the singer's entire career.

Endless Bummer,Pink Skull,by: Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a7385e6ef95969320f12/1:1/w_160/410d17a3.jpg,2009-12-07 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13699-endless-bummer/,Rvng Intl.,"New York's RVNG boutique has long distinguished itself for not only its expertly curated mixes, but also its imaginative packaging. When Philly mainstays Julian Grefe and Justin Geller, core duo behind disco freaks Pink Skull, put together the first Rvng Prsnts mix back in 2002, they recorded it straight to CD-R and did the printing at Kinko's. Each copy of Endless Bummer, Pink Skull's second album (first for RVNG), comes hand-typeset with a different ""bummer""-- real depressing shit like ""BUTT ACNE"" or ""NUCLEAR WARFARE."" I got ""JOHNHUGHESDIED."" In a year of summery new-music releases and celebrity deaths, Endless Bummer is neither glo-fi/chillwave trendfuck nor downer. Pink Skull's last album, 2008's Zeppelin 3, was a sprawling journey through psych, krautrock, Chicago house, rave, and other styles you might hope for on a killer RVNG mix. Jumping between live disco and acid house, with plenty of unexpected turns along the way, Endless Bummer is just as varied and transportative. It's also (relatively) focused. Recorded by Mazarin's Quentin Stoltzfus at the studio of Clap Your Hands Say Yeah's Alec Ounsworth, the release is available on mp3 and vinyl, with digital-only bonus tracks. Multiple online reports have suggested that Pink Skull got a full band together only prior to this album, but that's not the case. Grefe, Geller, and their abettors had actually expanded into a working live unit by 2007, and Zeppelin 3's dusty, freeform grooves-- the type of percussive dance-punk explorations that make you feel !!! drummer Jerry Fuchs' death all the more acutely-- get a wild and woolly reprise here. On the near-instrumental title track, for example, a variety of multi-layered, South American-flavored percussion parts support skronky sax and synths that alternately screech and lull. A bigger change since Pink Skull's last outing-- that rare album to feature vocals from both Mirah and Ghostface Killah-- is the new prevalence of Grefe's own singing, with guests' higher-pitched harmonies balancing out his gruff man-voice. Those vocals are nevertheless the weakest part about opener ""Peter Cushing"", a limber disco-funk swooner that trades Zeppelin 3's music references for film references, but it's an elaborately realized production that would sit nicely beside something from DFA or Modular. Ostinato bass drives the sweeping, majestic ""Oh, Monorail"", as Grefe wryly asserts, ""You know I hate songs about nightlife."" True to the idea of an album that is more than a collection of dance singles, the contemplative moments on Endless Bummer make return trips more rewarding. Each side of the album closes with elegant ambient synth pieces, while ""Circling Bwi"" toys with disembodied harmonies. The flute-trilling ""Fast Forward to Bolivia, 2000 Years Later, Our Hero Finds Himself..."" could score a futuristic update of that old Disney cartoon The Three Caballeros. A track with an even longer title floats a melodic synth line recalling Aphex Twin over complex drum programming. Endless Bummer won't bring John Hughes back, but it would make a hell of a DJ mix. Maybe even cure butt acne.","Philly disco crew mixes limber dance-punk and funk tracks with dreamier, more contemplative fare, resulting in a varied set that works as an album.

Dr. No's Ethiopium,Oh No,by: Nate Patrin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a76fea9e61561daa55ac/1:1/w_160/095f2d88.jpg,2009-12-07 06:00:03,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13745-dr-nos-ethiopium/,Stones Throw,"When you recontextualize other people's music, it's not enough that your sources fit a certain aesthetic sweet spot-- you have to do something transformative enough with those sources that it brings out new aspects in both their music and your own. The best producers and beat collectives could do this seemingly at will, get listeners simultaneously considering the inner musical workings of both the Bomb Squad and James Brown, RZA and Willie Mitchell, Basement Jaxx and Gary Numan. Like his older brother Madlib, Oh No seems as fascinated with the notion of picking a specific palette to work from as he is with advancing his own style, having previously done so with albums based on thematic source material like stage-and-screen composer Galt MacDermot (Exodus into Unheard Rhythms) and Middle Eastern/Mediterranean psychedelic rock (Dr. No's Oxperiment). But if Oh No's style isn't drastically different than that of his famously out-there brother, it's still a recognizably consistent and characteristic one, no matter what he feeds into his sampler. Dr. No's Ethiopium is the next in his string of dedicated-source concept records, and it's the kind of thing you'd think would have been done a long time ago. Drawing off Ethiopian music of the 1960s and 70s, especially since the Ethiopiques series rose to prominence, would fit the more adventurous styles of hip-hop production to a T, and the region's recognizable but culturally unique permutations of American jazz, funk, and folk music traditions (and the precursors thereof) would make for some accessibly exotic beats. That it was Oh No who came around to it is fortunate; the man has professed to be the kind of producer who's always willing to find a way to make beats out of anything, and his track record's revealed that M.O. to work out well for him. (He did have two of the best beats on The Ecstatic, in any case.) Ethiopium-- a top-notch genre name if there ever was one-- rests on the ability of Oh No's alchemy to preserve just enough of the original sound to make its origins recognizable, but still finds a way to whittle it down to shards and fit it to his own, differently-angled approach. The songs themselves are shreds of music in themselves, 36 tracks at two minutes or less, in the now-familiar structure of typical Stones Throw beat-tape concoctions. They're odd little see-sawing loops and stagger-step blasts assembled from thickly-stitched scraps of brass sections and chiming guitars and wailing vocals, all truncated into little bursts of disembodied, attention-grabbing remnants. Sometimes the rhythms feel built around the loops, like the sharply plucked notes (possibly from a lyre-style krar) that choppily bob along with ""Madness""' bounce. Other times, he lets the original rhythms play out for a bit like he does at the beginning of ""Problematic"", only to yank the rug out from under it and mold it into a new, more boom-bap-friendly cadence. And there are tracks where he just uses these loops and snippets like almost diversionary flourishes, garnishing tracks like ""Drive By"" and ""Midnight Missions"" with scattered Ethiopian ambiance. Not every sound on this album comes from Oh No's cratedigging trips through the East African reaches of Egon's record collection. There's lots of modern digital boom-clap beats, and I suspect that many of the drum breaks come as much from the go-to hip hop repertoire of vintage American funk and jazz loops as they do from a potential Addis Ababa equivalent to Clyde Stubblefield. Which is part of the appeal, really; some of the brightest moments come from the tracks where crackly shreds of Ethiopian source material push exclamatory notes through a wall of post-Dilla bass-glow rhythm (""Louder""; ""Strong""). And while Ethiopium has a few moments where Oh No teeters on the edge of irreverence-- some goofy non sequitur, expletive-filled movie soundbites, a few blasts of brass or vocals that seem picked as much for their foreign strangeness as their beauty-- it also lets the loop-Benihana structure recede every so often to just let the original texture of the sources shine through, like it does on the gorgeous ""The Pain"". Oh No knows just what he's got to work with on this album, and in finding every angle he can for an incredible array of source material, he's made that much more of a case for his own style, too.","Madlib's younger brother continues to develop his own recognizably consistent and characteristic style, here working with Ethiopian music of the 1960s and 70s.

New York-Addis-London: The Story of Ethio Jazz 1965-1975,Mulatu Astatke,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a71bc0084474cd0c0afa/1:1/w_160/7ea4560a.jpg,2009-12-07 06:00:02,Jazz,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13678-new-york-addis-london-the-story-of-ethio-jazz-1965-1975/,Strut,"Ethio jazz. That's what Mulatu Astatke called his style of music when he invented it back in the 1960s, and it means exactly what it implies: Ethiopian melodies played on Western instruments with room for improvisation. Astatke was a pioneer for his country's modern music. His concept of instrumental music as an end in itself was a bit foreign in his homeland, where singers rule the popular music sphere, and he was among the very first musicians from Ethiopia to learn about music while abroad. He started playing as a teenager at school in Wales, and after a stint at London's Trinity School of Music, he jumped the Atlantic for a brief stay at Boston's Berklee College of Music, ultimately winding up in New York City in the mid-60s. There, he was exposed to sounds he simply couldn't have heard back home in Addis Ababa, and his exposure to jazz and Western harmonic concepts led him to formulate Ethio jazz, the perfect hybrid of the traditional and the modern. His first attempts to forge his new genre occurred in the U.S., and his band members were mostly Puerto Rican. You can tell by listening, too. The several tracks here lifted from his two Afro Latin Soul LPs bear a strong stamp of boogaloo, Latin jazz, and other Americo-Caribbean forms. When he returned to Ethiopia, he arrived at a time when the country was opening up as never before, and Addis Ababa was as cosmopolitan as cities came, boiling with cultural restlessness that fed a vibrant nightlife. Recording resources were limited, but in 1969, Mulatu began cutting tracks for Amha Eshèté's Amha, the first independent label ever established in the country. He worked primarily as an arranger, but frequently wrote and recorded instrumentals to serve as B-sides for vocal songs, some of which are being issued here for the first time outside Ethiopia. Astatke brought a unique skill set back to Addis with him, where he was able to employ musicians who'd grown up with the music he was so consciously modernizing. The resulting music is simply brilliant, fresh even decades later. The way Mulatu harmonized horns, combining pentatonic Ethiopian melody with Western chord concepts, sounds like no one else-- the music seems both ancient and modern at once, befitting the mixture of raw ingredients. This compilation is utterly intoxicating from the first note to the last-- preternaturally funky, haunting, complex, memorable, exciting, and unique, Ethio jazz easily transcends the era in which it was made. ""Mulatu"", from his 1972 LP Mulatu of Ethiopia, recorded in New York with members of Mongo Santamaria's band during a visit to the States, is a brilliant signature track, a darkly funky tune with a hint of Caribbean shuffle, snaking sax solos, Mulatu's own cloudy vibraphone, and a bit of wah-pedaled Wurlitzer. The stately, smoky ""Netsanet"" is drawn from 1974's Yekatit: Ethio Jazz LP, the very first Ethiopian LP to be conceived as an album in advance (as opposed to a collection of 45 sides). Like the other songs from that album, it has a weighty solemnity to it that betrays the difficult revolutionary period during which it was recorded. My favorite Mulatu track, ""Ené Alantchie Alnorem"", was previously featured on Buda Musique's Ethiopiques Volume 4 compilation, and it still kills here. It is a song without a solid core: its fluttering electric piano, flute, and drums spin in an ethereal wash, held together by wind sound effects and a heavy sonority, and the descending piano line that outlines the chords feels like it's falling and catching itself on each beat. A handful of vocal tracks dot the compilation, and they're all outstanding as well. ""Ebo Lala"" features Seifu Yohannes putting on his best Bollywood-inspired show, huffing and puffing over a heavy Latin beat and blasting horn section. ""Wubit"", featuring Muluken Melesse, has a cool, funky crime jazz strut, a sick breakdown, and a quintessentially Ethiopian melismatic vocal-- that this song has remained hidden from all but a few collectors in Ethiopia until now is almost criminal. Even Mulatu's very first foray into recording, the Latin-tinged instrumental ""Shagu"", bears his unmistakable signature, playing its cycling piano riff two octaves lower than in most Latin music and featuring a dark, mysterious vibraphone lead playing between Ethiopian pentatonics and modal concepts nicked from post-bop jazz. Ethio jazz was never a commercial success in Ethiopia. That Ahma and Philips Ethiopia even saw fit to release any of it is a credit to their commitment to art over commerce, and even today it remains little-heard in its homeland. But Mulatu was a master craftsman and one of the most supremely inventive composers of a time when an awful lot of creative music was being made around the world. He's still going today, guesting on radio shows and teaching in Addis, and he released a great album with London's the Heliocentrics as his backing band earlier this year. But even if he'd disappeared after 1975, his legacy would be sealed.","This collection of tracks from the Ethiopian bandleader shows the power of his unique fusion.

Asleep in the Back [Deluxe Edition],Elbow,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a759c0084474cd0c0b80/1:1/w_160/d793834b.jpg,2009-12-07 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13728-asleep-in-the-back-deluxe-edition/,Polydor,"Elbow emerged fully formed at a time when it may have helped their cause to be more malleable. Around the turn of the century, hailing from the British Isles and playing mid-tempo rock served as qualification to be ""the next Radiohead,"" and even if Elbow got caught in that dragnet, they weren't quite as fresh-faced or brash as those now-laughably incompatible peers. Once that whole thing morphed into the search for the next Coldplay, Elbow weren't quite singles-minded enough to fit that bill either, and unlike Starsailor or JJ72, they weren't destined to be used solely as comic fodder for music reviews in 2009. True, they've carved out a pretty enviable career, but stateside I imagine someone right this very minute is confusing them with Doves. If Elbow did seem too mature for a new band, you can chalk it up to Asleep in the Back gestating for almost a decade. As such, it can be described in a lot of unsexy ways-- patient, stately, considered, professional.  There's only one song that really qualifies as ""rock"" (though the menacing ""Bitten By the Tailfly"" is defined by its tension as much as its volume), half of the tracks top out at over five minutes, moving with cruise-ship luxury and tempo, and there aren't really hooks so much as ""moments"" where the restraint and attention to sonic detail build into an undeniable payoff. Now, talking about production is usually viewed as a backhanded compliment-- we should be talking about the songs, man... right? But as languorous as the tempos can be, Asleep in the Back is studious and hardworking, proof that modern albums can still sound luxurious. Despite minimal soloing and nothing in the way of tricksy time signatures, it strangely got tagged as ""prog."" It sort of is in the way Built to Spill's Perfect From Now On was ""prog""-- constantly shifting textures and always sounding like it's headed somewhere. The dank bass and processed, dub-influenced drum sound that begins ""Any Day Now"" come off like a hungover transmission from Massive Attack's Mezzanine until the band opens the shades and lets the sun inside (to cop a quote from Cast of Thousands' ""Ribcage""). Two bright and major-key chords repeat throughout the track's six minutes with unease, breaking down for an a cappella mission statement: ""How's about getting out of this place... got a lot of spare time, some of my youth and all my senses on overdrive."" Most tracks are buffeted with horns and strings, but in retrospect it's all the more impressive how they're culled for shading than the kind of levels-in-the-red overkill that often resulted in post-Arcade Fire orchestration. So much about the gorgeous title track sneaks up you-- a whistling organ drone breezes easily through the mix, woodwinds seep into the guitar waltz like ink into water, and when the trumpets herald its hopeful finale, it feels earned. The violin shredding at the end of ""Red"" combines with the controlled chaos of Jupp's cymbal hits to mirror its subject's descent into substance addiction. ""Saxophone coda"" is the sort of thing that gets brought up when savaging an overblown cod-epic, but such a device is all the more effective on ""Powder Blue"" for how it contrasts with the powerless of its narrator (""I'm proud to be the one you hold when the shakes begin""). Which is not to suggest Elbow are merely a studio band. A couple of Steve Lamacq radio sessions and an early EP are included in the Deluxe packaging, and the band sounds great in a stripped down setting, particularly singer Guy Garvey. The Peter Gabriel comparisons were certainly fair, as the strongest melodic moments of Asleep tend to find Garvey in that register. But for the most part, Garvey turned out to have more in common with barstool-bound indie bards of America-- wryly romantic like the National's Matt Berninger without the class-consciousness, drunk like the Walkmen's Hamilton Leithauser but not as unhinged. Although the guitar hook of ""Bitten By the Tailfly"" rivals the earwax-blast of ""The Rat"", it's in large part due to how quiet its surroundings are-- it's a rare treat to hear a major-label album where the soft parts are quiet and the loud parts are loud. The dynamic volume of Asleep in the Back set the standard for what would turn out to be one of the most consistently well-produced bands out there. And then there's ""Newborn"", the centerpiece of Asleep. If you've heard only the radio version, you've literally got only half the story. Though clocking in at a mighty seven minutes, the first three were used as a compact single, while the the triplet guitar figure that bridges the verse and chorus become the intro for the stunning second half, a constantly building that sits somewhere between Catherine Wheel's most heroic moments and the strange, pastoral spirituality of latter-day Talk Talk (it's possible the abrupt ending is a direct nod to ""Ascension Day""). It's such a stunning, career-defining performance that the second half of Asleep in the Back can't help but take something of breather: The downtempo ""Don't Mix Your Drinks"" establishes the languid mood that isn't lifted until the lovely, fingerpicked nostalgia of ""Scattered Black and Whites"". I guess we're dancing around the obvious question of who knows why Asleep in the Back is getting the bonus treatment right in between rounder anniversaries-- about eight years old, and can be easily obtained in its original edition. Maybe it's contractual, maybe it's just a Hail Mary attempt to give critics a quick reminder while putting together Best of 00s lists (NME has it at #30), or maybe, as Jason Crock pointed out in his review of the recent Jesus Lizard reissues, it wouldn't be a surprise if it merely was done to cut through a poky December release slate to remind listeners of its existence. Either way is satisfactory as long as Elbow have a chance to be heard anew instead of taken for granted: Asleep in the Back shows one of this decade's most underrated bands in its finest hour.","Stately, luxurious sounding, professional-- one of the decade's quietly underrated bands has its best album given a 2xCD/DVD reissue.

Lifter Puller / Half Dead and Dynamite / The Entertainment and Arts EP / Fiestas and Fiascos / Slips Backwards,Lifter Puller,by: Nate Patrin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a76cea9e61561daa55a7/1:1/w_160/7b565651.gif,2009-12-07 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13744-lifter-puller-half-dead-and-dynamite-the-entertainment-and-arts-ep-fiestas-and-fiascos-slips-backwards/,Orchard,"How many people became Lifter Puller fans between 2000 and 2003? It's probably not a greater number than the fanbase that band built between their first single (1993's ""Prescription Sunglasses"") and their last (2001's post-breakup ""4Dix""), or the number of people that've gotten into the Hold Steady since 2004 and subsequently got the notion to check out what the deal was with Craig Finn's old group. But somewhere between the release of their final album, Fiestas + Fiascos, and the three-night final-reunion set that inaugurated the music room of Minneapolis' Triple Rock Social Club roughly six years ago, Lifter Puller's following grew to the point where they wound up becoming a feverishly adored cult band-- not quite famous, but infamous to just about everyone who'd heard of them. Fans took road trips to the Twin Cities just to visit intersections name-dropped in songs, Finn's lyrical mythologies were built and deconstructed on messageboards and fansites, and at least one person went and got himself a set of ""LFTR PLLR"" knuckle tattoos. This band bred fanatics. And it'll keep doing so-- this en masse reissue of the entire Lifter Puller discography should see to that. A decade past their heyday, there's still something that resonates unsettlingly in their songs, something even more seedy and desperate than the party-casualty scenarios that fueled the Hold Steady's breakthrough. With his first band, Finn's lyrical tics and themes were well in place already-- shady nightlife characters that introduce themselves with preposterous nicknames, unexpected collisions of different music-scene casualties, people fucking in bizarre locales and somehow waking up in even stranger ones. But it's all just a bit more threatening and sordid, the humor bleaker, the redemption more elusive. It could be that Lifter Puller's style puts an additional edge to things; trade in the Hold Steady's bar-band classic rock for a beat-up indie rock/newish wave that staggers between sludgy and jittery, and it'd be hard not to make the allusion-filled literary/pop-cult debris of Finn's burnout milieu feel just a bit more unhinged. And it didn't take too long to get there, either. Both their self-titled debut and Half Dead and Dynamite were released in 1997, and the leap between the two is startling. The first album's a sort of textbook indie rock feeling-out process, an effort that results in a surprising progenitor of the band as we know them: ""Star Wars Hips"", a song which introduces the nightclub fire that would become the dramatic turning point of Fiestas + Fiascos and Juanita, the recurring figure of the Lifter Pullerverse who might have been responsible for lighting it. Most of Lifter Puller is sort of an uncharacteristic slog, though-- Finn's lyrics show early signs of his off-kilter, unpredictable internal rhyme schemes (from ""Mission Viejo"": ""haven't been as high as this since the night I burned my lips"") but aren't quite as dense with referential humor and feel more like narrative sketches than vivid character portraits. And despite a few scattered songs like the Pavement-with-a-switchblade slink of ""Double Straps"" and the vertiginous half-Wire of ""The Mezzanine Gyp"" (in which it sounds like Finn is muttering through a Burger King intercom), the energy level tends to wane, especially during the hazy, vague breakup postmortem of the seven-plus-minute ""Lazy Eye"". Even then, Finn scores a hell of a lyric: ""Let this be a testament/ To every lightbulb filament/ That burned itself out before it got turned on."" Lifter Puller is best heard as a warmup for Half Dead and Dynamite, which is where the band started playing to their strengths (and adding a couple of new ones). Dan Monick's drumming provided a backbeat that sounded like it could trip and fall into the gutter at any moment but never really did, and doubled up with Tommy Roach's gelatinous basslines it was tight enough to make the hard rock strut of ""To Live and Die in LBI"" and ""The Gin and the Sour Defeat"" that much punchier. This was also the point when guitarist Steve Barone turned into guitarist/keyboardist Steve Barone, and his tendency to forgo solos for a restless array of post-punk/hard rock guitar riffs was augmented by a weirdly amateurish cheap-Casio minimalism that bled car-alarm panic all over ""I Like the Lights"" and turned the title track into some kind of John Carpenter nightmare; of course, it fit perfectly. And while Craig Finn sounded like Craig Finn from the start, this is where he really took off, spiraling deeper down into the subject matter of drugged-out, alcohol-soaked escapism and bad decisions, but tempering them with smart-assed punchlines (""She said she's waiting on the steady type/ Then she disappears with the eye-patch guy"") and enigmatic yet evocative characterization that comes close to justifying the haze of hangovers and unfamiliar beds the songs' subjects stumble through. Then again, they hadn't just figured out how to pull this balance off for the first time, they simply proved they could do it more consistently and from every angle; the slow-building bitterness and violence that punctuates ""Nassau Coliseum"" dates back a couple of years in its origins as a B-side, but it stands out as Half Dead's dramatic high point. 1998's The Entertainment and Arts EP feels like a brief but boisterous kick in the ass-- a quick-and-dirty intro (""Plymouth Rock""), three bewildered pill-addled hookup chronicles (""The Candy Machine and My Girlfriend"", ""Sangre de Stephanie"", ""Roaming the Foam"") and a slower yet more intense rerecording of ""Star Wars Hips"", all building up to the seething, feverish ""Let's Get Incredible"", as good a candidate for a Lifter Puller mission statement as any (""These kids want something new to get their eyes rolling back into their dreams/ They want a cellophane celebration/ A revolution rushing into dancefloor distribution""). But it's Fiestas + Fiascos, their rock-opera grand finale and the only Lifter Puller full-length to feature future Hold Steady guitarist Tad Kubler on bass, that the band should and will be defined by. Whether the cast of characters that had shown up in previous songs here and there had some grand design planned for them, or whether the album was simply a collection of callbacks fashioned into a loose narrative, F+F was a delirious blur of bloody fights and criminal activity and illicit sex rendered in ash-covered countertops and ripped upholstery. Everything comes in quick bursts, three and a half minutes at most, darting from song to song and event to event like a police blotter: a tweaky Springsteen lift turned into a tale of two drugged-up lovers screwing in a bathroom stall (""Candy's Room""), a jumpy little number about anonymous gay hookups and people ""making money with their mouths"" (""Manpark""), a sinister-sounding profile of the cracked-out, club-owning schemer Nightclub Dwight (""Nice Nice"") and the declaration by a criminal loan shark, namely Half Dead and Dynamite's Eye-patch Guy, that both Dwight and his nightclub are marked for destruction (""The Flex and the Buff Result""). Because Lifter Puller are all about the feeling of now-fucking-what panic, that's where the album ends, smothered in a muffled yet blown-out squall that sounds like the music itself is going up in flames, a story that ends with a gut-turning uncertainty. The story of Lifter Puller themselves almost ended that way, too, with tales of live shows getting passed around like rumors and those crucial albums lapsing out of print by the time the first Hold Steady album saw the light. 2002's Soft Rock compilation was a valiant effort at tying the mythos together before it could get any further unraveled, but these reissues easily top it by dint of including practically everything the band ever released. That includes the singles and B-sides accumulated on Slips Backwards-- not the most cohesive picture of Lifter Puller at their best, but nearly every song's characteristically theirs, and the two best tracks-- ""Math is Money"" and ""Secret Santa Cruz""-- sound so in tune with the vibe of Fiestas + Fiascos that it's hard to believe they didn't make the cut. Each reissued album also includes a few recordings, mostly bootleg-quality, of live shows that were roughly contemporaneous with the albums they originally toured behind. They're nice little bonus curios for the most part, though none of them have the electricity in the air that filled the room during the 2003 Triple Rock shows, six songs of which are included with Fiestas + Fiascos. Three years after Lifter Puller broke up, there they are performing to a crowd that's ecstatic at the possibility of finally getting to see this myth in person one last time, a crowd that can't help but sing along at every opportunity. Surviving the nightlife is tricky enough, but Lifter Puller survived potential obscurity, too -- and they've earned every fanatic.","The Hold Steady's Craig Finn has the bulk of his cult classic group's catalog digitally reissued.

Pyramids With Nadja,Pyramids With Nadja,by: Cosmo Lee,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a711ea9e61561daa54e2/1:1/w_160/c14ed5c0.jpg,2009-12-04 06:00:04,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13669-pyramids-with-nadja/,Hydra Head,"Pyramids With Nadja is a most natural pairing. Last year Pyramids, a Denton, Texas, outfit, debuted with a record that sounded as if A Storm in Heaven-era Verve and Blut aus Nord (a French black metal act known for warping sounds in the studio) left master tracks for their albums at the same mixing desk for an unsuspecting engineer to sort out. The result was a mess: blotches of ambience, snatches of vocals, and heavily treated guitars splayed over drum machines pitter-patting this way and that. Fortunately, the album came with a second disc of remixes by Jesu, Blut aus Nord, Birchville Cat Motel, and others. Though necessarily disjointed, the disc showed the potential of collaboration with more focused outsiders. Ironically, Nadja have also needed an editor. The Toronto shoegaze duo has issued over 20 releases in the past two years. Most are good listens, though Nadja's methodology virtually precludes producing duds. Guitar, bass, and synths go through software and effects, producing an overtone-rich, distorted soup. The tonalities involved are not especially challenging; strip away the technology, and you have pretty chords and melodies. Technology simply adds an element of randomness that helps to make them more prolific. After collaboration with like-minded acts Fear Falls Burning, Atavist, and Black Boned Angel, Nadja could have churned out yet another enjoyable-but-forgettable effort. Instead, working with Pyramids has produced something remarkably focused. Pyramids With Nadja is still expansive-- it spreads four tracks across almost 58 minutes-- but it is not something to get lost in. Listeners will always know where they are. The key is vocals. They're not the greatest or worst vocals in the world; they sound like Thom Yorke wandering by the abovementioned mixing desk. But they add a human element to the technology, providing time markers and textural contrast. Pop music often operates through tension and release between vocal and instrumental sections. This record dilates that interplay across long periods of time. It unfolds quite gradually. ""Into the Silent Waves"" is really a 10-minute introduction, massaging in drones and noise until it reaches a stirring density worthy of its name. Vocals enter in the next track, sounding like one of those free-tempo Bono vocal intros in late-1980s/early-90s U2. But instead of dropping into a pop song, the intro hangs and stretches into a gloriously time-free taffy. Another source of tension and release is piano. Along with vocals, the acoustic instrument provides an unadorned counterpoint to all the technology at work. Notes tinkle here and there, yielding a clean, naked feeling. Sometimes distortion surges in oceanic swells, and sometimes it falls away to small instrumental gestures. Such contrast is refreshing. So much of so-called ""metalgaze"" or modern shoegaze is really new-age music with distortion. Introduction of clearly defined dynamics is almost revolutionary-- until one remembers that the best of the original 90s shoegaze bands still wrote proper, robust songs.","Toronto metalgaze duo Nadja pairs with the Denton, Texas, outfit Pyramids for an expansive, effects-heavy album of surprising focus.

Armonico Hewa,OOIOO,by: Mike Orme,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a7759d034d5c69bf37d6/1:1/w_160/bed521a0.jpg,2009-12-04 06:00:03,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13750-armonico-hewa/,Thrill Jockey,"Japanese all-female group and Boredoms offshoot OOIOO's fifth album, 2006's Taiga, holds a more than respectable score of 78 on Metacritic, but it split Pitchfork listeners. The percussion heavy, often amelodic beast came off as needlessly difficult and even lazy to some staffers, yet Dominique Leone claimed it to be, in so many words, the easiest entry point in the OOIOO catalogue. I don't begrudge either extreme viewpoint: OOIOO's output is divisive for the simple reason that the band has a unique capacity to both wow and disappoint. To call the new Armonico Hewa one of the band's best mostly acknowledges the group has refined its curatorial voice. While not overtly acknowledging Boredoms comparisons, the group (founded by original Bore Yoshimi P-We in the mid 1990s) teases expectant Boredom-crazed trainspotters by sonically orbiting the mothership but never quite giving in to the white-hot bombast of its predecessor. At the same time, the group frustratingly ""rewards"" the careerist patience of its growing fanbase by fiddling with band dynamics with every release. You really never know what you're going to get, but it usually ranges between a take on Slits-esque post-punk to the incomprehensible stutter-start No Wave splendor pioneered by the antecedent Boredoms catalogue, all meaning abstracted out into pseudo-lingual screech. The first track on Taiga, for example, is a mess of jungle drums falling over one another, Yoshimi belting out like a megalomaniac cheerleader and announcing the abrupt (if brief) renunciation of the group's melodic sensibilities. What results is often ballyhooed, sometimes brilliant, but it almost always leaves sonic travelers all packed up for one of the group's pop-tinged psychedelic sojourns out in the cold. Armonico morphs between musical touchstones but engages the listener much more directly. ""O O I A H"" updates spacy funk with guitars in full face-melt mode and supporting members belting out a falsetto chant, but ""Ulda"" proffers a wonky, new age keyboard chord preset before morphing into a more familiar guitar-driven drone. Space-age rock guitar riffs remain a prominent signpost, but up against the monolithic axe slabs rub such dated synthesizer lines lifted from progressive electronic pioneers. Manic drumming abounds, metronomic but paradoxically indebted to the languid beatkeeping of centuries of world cultures. A notable referent is not only the rhythms of Africa, but those as transposed by progressives sharing an equatorial gaze such as Bruford-era King Crimson. OOIOO's drummer, Ai, came on board for 2006's Taiga, a record which arguably let its new percussive weapon direct the group's usually holistic jams. The group's previous record, Kila Kila Kila, suffered a similar problem in aimless, almost tuneless guitar riffage. Thing is, OOIOO operate best as a democratic entity, forming compositions out of the blind ambiguity of improvisation and the relative economy of instrumental balance. On Armonico Hewa, for the first time in years, the balance struck by the group's best work is approximated while largely preserving the same display of technical chops on their last two records. The group is also best served by developing the possibilities of their constituents' voices as instruments. Highlights like ""Be Sure to Loop"" from Feather Float and the incomparable, uneven singsong chorus of Gold and Green's ""Mountain Book"" elevate the female voice, sometimes to endless heights and sometimes to fall off false plateaus. Armonico casts the molten steel of meaningless syllables into machine-gun bursts, sonar echoes, radioactive dirges, and girl-group coos of the group's best work. It's a monument to the endless possibilities afforded by an improvisational spirit, but more importantly it highlights Yoshimi and her band's tireless and ever-evolving voice.","Japanese all-female group and Boredoms offshoot continues to refine its unique, experimental voice.

Tribute to the Sun,Luciano,by: Andy Battaglia,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6aa13d197565213922b/1:1/w_160/5360f548.jpg,2009-12-04 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13585-tribute-to-the-sun/,Cadenza,"You won't likely hear many tracks this year weirder or more unsettling than the first one on Luciano's Tribute to the Sun. Can you imagine sucking on a mouthful of pennies-- not just the taste of it, but also all the squirms and shudders that would come to pass? Does it make sense to describe a sound as ""sour""? If that means anything, does it make such a sound in a dance track sound appealing? Like something worth savoring? Would it help or hurt to know that the sour-pennies part is just one of several parts that run concurrently for almost nine minutes, with some of the others being an anxiously pitched-up tribal chant and what might well be a dozen murderous kids clapping? Luciano is a techno producer whose sound-world is uncommonly vast and even more uncommonly fertile. In a realm where steely shades of gray compete for space within formalist grids, Luciano favors subtle washes of color. More than that, though, he plays the minimalist's game of placing sounds where they can grow. An evocative rustle here, a suggestive tap there-- something interesting will always happen in between such things if the conditions are made right. They certainly are in ""Los Niños de Fuera"". That's the first track on Tribute to the Sun, and it works as both a functional charge and a wide-open statement of intent. As the distended vocal wail (the sour-penny part) duels with the handclap chant, the effect is simultaneously ghostly and bursting with life-- something both exotic and immediately identifiable. It's as good an encapsulation of Luciano's aesthetic as anything he has done. The whole album makes good on the wide spread of Luciano's sound, which shares a lot with the lilting experimentalism of Ricardo Villalobos and so many others tracing techno lines these days between South America and Europe. (Luciano has roots in Chile and a home in Switzerland.) ""Celestial"" follows the album-opener with a percussive mix of hand-drum runs and minimal house beats that scan as South American for all their airy, woody timbres and especially their patience. They're also trademark Luciano in the way they're haunted by a humid bass-line that seems to be humming to itself when not distracted to silence by something happening out of ear-shot. Tracks like ""Conspirer"" and ""Hang for Bruno"" take mellow forays through melodic passes, the latter with a gorgeous quasi-trumpet sound that would've worked on Miles Davis and Gil Evans' Sketches of Spain. But it's the dance tracks that prove most striking. ""Africa Sweat"" features vocals by Senegalese singer Ali Boulo Santo and an awful lot of touch, in the infectious rhythms as well as some subtle but wowing EQ-tweaks on the kora and drum sounds. The same subtlety plays into ""Metodisima"", which runs through an IDM egghead's store of rhythmic ideas while sounding effortless and contented. Much of Luciano's best handiwork on Tribute to the Sun works like that: It's easy to miss certain things in the rush or swell of the mood, but it's just as pleasing to go back and try to take stock of all that he's doing without making too big a show of it.","His second full-length marks Luciano as a techno producer whose sound-world is uncommonly vast and even more uncommonly fertile.

Score! The Remixes!,Various Artists,by: David Raposa,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a779ea9e61561daa55c6/1:1/w_160/64255554.jpg,2009-12-04 06:00:01,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13754-score-the-remixes-the-merge-records-companion/,Merge,"In one of the introductory essays to The Merge Records Companion, label co-founder and Superchunk bassist Laura Ballance trumpets the book as a ""representation of the essential relationship between 'product' and purchaser, or in this case, Music and Music Lover."" The same could be said for the other Score! releases-- the two publicly available compilations (The Covers, released in April, and the newly released The Remixes), as well as the 14 subscription-only compilations curated by a seemingly disparate group of folks that includes ""The Office""'s Mindy Kaling, novelist Jonathan Lethem, and bon vivant David Byrne. All these objects are examples of the implicit trust (or, if you prefer a more blunt phrasing, brand loyalty) that, to some extent, exists in the indie music world between the consumer and the purveyor. At the very least, it most definitely existed back when Merge Records engaged in the time-honored indie label tradition of glue-and-paste record-sleeve parties. Now, in an environment where labels are almost secondary channels through which fans can acquire their favorite tunes, the power of a label's brand is diminishing in conjunction with its profit margin. According to Merge's other co-founder/Superchunk member, Mac McCaughan, this waning of influence comes at a time when the importance of such branding is perhaps at an all time high. He recently mentioned in an indie-label roundtable organized by NPR contributor and former Sleater-Kinney member Carrie Brownstein: ""The Internet allows you access to all the music you could want, and that's the problem-- if you don't know what you are looking for, it's like trying to find a good record in a thrift shop. So the label is... a filter, or at least a starting point for fans."" In that rather stark light, the Score! releases can be viewed as a sort of prospectus for listeners, showing potential customers both the breadth and depth of their catalog, and their standing and influence within this musical community-- a label doesn't get to put out a charity remix compilation featuring far-flung folks like Barbara Morgenstern, Four Tet, and Jason Forrest without earning the respect of its peers. Thankfully, The Remixes is more than just a display of the power of the Merge Records Rolodex. Like any compilation, it's got its share of lackluster moments, but most of the material here presents both the remixer and the remixed in a flattering light. Of course, cherry-picking highpoints from this release would be the best way to tackle it, but listeners who opt to go from start to finish can take solace knowing that the album is bookended by two of the compilation's high points. To open things, Caribou takes a two-minute track (""Kalgon"") from Polvo's first full-length (Cor-Crane Secret) and expands it into an eight-minute epic, transforming the group's fractured brand of post-rock into something more sedate and spacious. At the other end of the record, there's the Junior Boys' take of Lambchop's ""Nashville Parent"", which reduces the source material to its haunting choral melody, and makes an alluring and lengthy JB-esque track from that one little snippet. In addition to offering of the album's remix highlights, Caribou manages also to be the beneficiary of a favorable treatment, courtesy of Lambchop compatriots Hands Off Cuba-- they add a persuasive syncopated backbeat to the diffused atmospheric musings of Andorra's ""Irene"". Remixers like Barbara Morgenstern (working with Pram's ""Mother of Pearl"") and John McEntire of Tortoise (on Spoon's ""The Ghost of You Lingers""), opt for a deceptively fussy approach that works hard at staying true to the song at hand. Jason Forrest (AKA DJ Donna Summer), on the other hand, doesn't do much to the Arcade Fire's ""No Cars Go"" except add some ominous synth flatulence that turns an already anthemic song into something even more grandiose (for better or worse). Along similar like-or-lump lines are the Blow's take on Portastatic's ""Drill Me""-- essentially a Blow song, but written over the bassline of the Portastatic tune-- and +/-'s take on the Rosebuds' ""Bow to the Middle"", which gives the duo the Postal Service treatment. Maybe Xiu Xiu's 52-card-pickup approach to the 6ths' ""Volcana!"" qualifies as well, though its chaotic fragmented approach might put off even the most patient listeners. The only truly regrettable remixes on this collection are Four Tet's rote rejiggering of Guv'ner's ""Baby's Way Cruel"" (which takes the source tune's chorus, and loops/ Auto-Tunes it ad nauseum over some pro forma dance beatz) and a not-so-fresh and ultra-flutey rendering of the Magnetic Fields' ""Washington, DC"" by Mark Robinson. Even if his remix leaves something to be desired, Robinson's presence on this compilation could be seen as totemic, if not simply a tribute-- his TeenBeat label, one of indie rock's most respected and individualistic bastions, and no doubt an influence during Merge's salad days, will be celebrating its 25th anniversary next year. While TeenBeat's certainly not working the same fields as its younger pupil, both labels exemplify the passed-down hands-on DIY aesthetic that's fueled the Amerindie underground for decades. Fittingly, The Merge Records Companion displays the art of the label in a similar hands-on fashion-- instead of just offering pages of record and CD sleeves, this handsome little book gives the browser pictures of hands holding these record and CD sleeves. The hands belong to all members of Team Merge-- the label heads, the PR folks, various other employees, folks in the bands, and family and friends (including Pitchfork contributor Grayson Currin). Even as the label's profile continues to grow and expand, and the music released by their bands finds its way into big-budget movies and prime-time television shows, Ballance and McCaughan don't want to forget how they got to where they are today, and who's helped them along the way. Cynical folks might view such a gesture simply as smart business, perpetuating a timeless image that appeals to a core demographic while not alienating anyone that's unswayed by such gestures. Those with more than red and black ink on their mind, however, can see such an act for what it most likely is-- a heartfelt show of thanks from a bunch of unabashed music lovers to a bunch of unabashed music lovers.","Merge caps its 20th anniversary year with a charity record that finds Four Tet, Caribou, Junior Boys, and more reworking songs from the label's catalog.

Dreamin' Man,Neil Young,by: Joshua Klein,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a73f13d1975652139381/1:1/w_160/9c6774ad.jpg,2009-12-04 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13708-dreamin-man/,Reprise,"Neil Young fans waited decades for his fabled Decade II project, later renamed Archives and finally released this year as the start-- or, technically, the continuation-- of the singer's long-simmering and fitfully realized reissue program. Reasonable people can quibble over the set's presentation and the relative redundancy of much of its contents, but it's hard to imagine anyone having a problem with how the set positioned Young within a definitive chronological context. Archives may be too awkward to be definitive, but no question they worked well as a portrait of a quixotic artist as a young man. For the Young faithful, the belated set seems to have gotten those rusty gears moving again. What was next? Will the second volume of the Archives encapsulate Young's formidable mid-1970s stretch? Would Time Fades Away finally appear on CD? Would any of Young's infamous live sets of that era show up? Rumors swirled. Well, Young threw one of his trademark wrenches in the works: What came next was Dreamin' Man, an unexpected jump to Young's 1992 Harvest Moon period-- itself an unexpected detour following the raging Crazy Horse reunion Ragged Glory. Dreamin' Man, deemed the Neil Young Archives Performance Series #12, captures Young solo, performing the entirety of Harvest Moon shortly before the album's release, albeit in a different order and compiled from multiple dates. Wait, back up. Or actually, fast forward. Neil Young Archives Performance Series #12? The Archive ""performance series"" releases began in 2006 with Live at the Fillmore East aka Volume 2, and continued in 2007 with Live at Massey Hall (Volume 3). Sugar Mountain: Live at Canterbury House 1968 (Volume 0) and Live at the Riverboat 1969 (Volume 1) appeared in the Archives boxed set this year (along with the previously issued installments). So what happened to the others? It must be in the fine print somewhere that Young didn't need to release this stuff chronologically. Alas, compared to the treasure trove of releases Young's compiled in the past few years, Dreamin' Man is a real letdown. With its patchwork (and, as of press time, unknown) 1992 sources, the set's neither particularly representative of Young live nor particularly different from the pleasant Harvest Moon album itself (cheering and lack of backing vocals, strings and session hands aside). Young's voice is in fine fragile form on ""Such a Woman"" and ""From Hank to Hendrix"", and not that the original versions of the album's tracks were ever larded up with embellishments, but it's always nice to hear Young this stripped down. Yet these versions adhere so closely to the studio versions, there's really little reason beyond completist impulse to pick them up again in this form. Dreamin' Man runs a mere five minutes longer than its original counterpart. Heck, the epic ""Natural Beauty"" was presented live on Harvest Moon to begin with. Then there's the possibility that Dreamin' Man, like its Performance Series predecessors, will just end up on a future Archives boxed set somewhere down the line anyway. There's no reason to believe it won't be, but after the amount of time and effort put into delivering Archives, wait for that boxed set at your peril.","The latest entry in Young's fabled Archives series is a peculiar one: live versions of the songs that eventually were released as Harvest Moon.

Cocoon of Love,Princeton,by: Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a71a13d1975652139330/1:1/w_160/dafc0480.jpg,2009-12-03 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13677-cocoon-of-love/,Kanine,"Sometime around 2004, cultural critics started typing up twee's obituary. The latest Wes Anderson film, The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou, had flopped. Mild-mannered bands like the Boy Least Likely To and Belle and Sebastian were about to cross over to the Guster/Ben Folds set. And hey, you hear this guy Kanye West? Precious, indie-label pop has regained some critical currency over the past couple of years, but the most contentious stuff is different now. It has swagger. At least, Vampire Weekend do. Sweden's the Tough Alliance and the acts on their Sincerely Yours label do, too, though they've obviously spent serious hours pining over old C86 and Sarah Records bands. L.A. baroque-pop quartet Princeton are similarly unapologetic about their self-presentation: boat shoes, a breakout 2008 EP inspired by London's Bloomsbury intellectual scene, and, on debut full-length Cocoon of Love, worldly references to everything from luxury cars and Kafka stories to hip-hop slang. But Princeton have been putting out records since before anyone heard ""Cape Cod Kwassa Kwassa"", and the group's singers-- twins Jesse and Matt Kivel-- actually grew up on Princeton Street in Santa Monica. A little too clever? You're starting to understand the problem with Cocoon of Love. Joined by longtime pal Ben Usen on keyboards and newer addition David Kitz on drums, the Kivels tend toward Jens Lekman's dashing orchestration, unexpected samples, doo-wop finger-snaps, and Eeyore vocals. When they toss in Afro-Caribbean flavors, the effect has more to do with the recent sounds of Gothenburg, Sweden, than with certain young Columbia grads. Nevertheless, for all the names (""Sadie and Andy"", Saul and ""Silvie"") and far-flung locales (Germany, Wall Street, San Diego) in these melodic vignettes about dysfunctional couples, there's little of Lekman's unforced charm. It's as if the songs are still growing into an older relative's finest suit. Princeton do better here when they outfit their jaunty tunes in more atmospheric styles: the frayed synth-pop of ""Martina and Clive Krantz"" and ""Worried Head"", the shoegaze whorls on ""I Left My Love in Nagasaki"", or the chiming tropical reverie of ""Calypso Gold"". Waltzing acoustic finale ""The Wild"", however, with its clumsy poetry, is an even bigger let down than Camera Obscura's own Leonard Cohen pastiche, ""Your Picture"", itself the worst song on the Glasgow band's still-great Underachievers Please Try Harder. Sure, Lekman remembers Warren G, Vampire Weekend appreciate Lil Jon's lack of modesty, and TTA have covered 50 Cent, but Princeton's ""Stunner Shades in Heaven"", featuring the kind of squeaks Serge Gainsbourg used to elicit from Brigitte Bardot (and an Arthur Russell quote you'll see coming a line away), is once again a bit too-- har har-- on the nose. If Cocoon of Love wants to be something bigger than it is, well, there are worse sins. Like Vancouver's equally mannered No Kids, Princeton are stretching beyond the staid chamber-pop of former tourmates Ra Ra Riot-- let alone Noah and the Whale or the disappointing new Boy Least Likely To single-- and that's to be applauded. They've even performed with a dance troupe at Lincoln Center as part of a Virginia Woolf event. And Jesse Kivel has made fine, Air France-style beach fantasy-pop under the name Kisses. None of this makes it any easier to stomach when, on Cocoon of Love's ""Korean War Memorial"", you hear a weirdly accented voice crooning, like nothing so much as a karaoker's Lekman, ""You said to me that you liked indie rock."" Here's the thing about swagger: You gotta own it.","This baroque-pop band comes off as the Left Coast answer to the Vampire Weekend/Grizzly Bear boat-shoe/literary reference set.

Their Day-Glo party had been going on for hours and the night was still youngish, their pupils weren't quite the appropriate size, and everything sounded like a really awesome idea. Since then, Urdur ""Earth"" Hákonadóttir, the singer whose robust wail was all over the last couple of GusGus albums, has left the band, they've hooked up with the Cologne minimal techno label Kompakt, and Iceland has gone into a financial tailspin that makes the U.S. economy look positively hearty by comparison. GusGus's seventh album isn't quite a hangover, and there's still a party going on-- but the party is somewhere far away. Sometimes that's literal: the bass thump that underscores these six songs sounds like it's echoing across an expanse of frozen desert. 24/7 is unmistakably a dance record, but it's about the most ascetic, burned-out, pissed-off electronic dance record anyone's made since Depeche Mode's ""Fly on the Windscreen"". (GusGus borrows a lot of mid-80s Depeche Mode's synth tones here, actually.) Its lyrical themes are exile, bitterness, overwork, and the emptiness of sex, and almost all of its beats are muted and clipped, as if the group's longtime core of Biggi Veira and President Bongo are reserving their machine's full strength in case they need it later. The album's title comes from ""On the Job"", which follows two verses of work-ethic boasting with a deliberately insipid sing-song come-on (""I wanna make you happy 'cause I like you a lot..."")-- in its context, it sounds like a weary prostitute's pitch. Dance music's usual strategy for dealing with hard economic times is pointed irony, and the claim that dancing is some kind of refuge from the bad stuff: think of Donna Summer's ""She Works Hard for the Money"" or Chic's ""Good Times"". GusGus, on the other hand, are just sarcastic and indignant. ""If you can't tolerate my kind you can kiss my fucking ass,"" Daniel Ágúst Haraldsson spits on ""Hateful""; when he croons ""I feel like dancing"" on the opening track, it's only so he can follow it up with the punch line-- ""...on the thinnest ice."" (Then the disco backing singers show up to repeat ""feel like dancin'"" a million times, their voices reduced to hollow ricochets between the speakers.) The only hint of hedonism comes on Jimi Tenor's brief guest appearance, ""Take Me Baby"", and even his sexed-up muttering is run through a filter that makes it sound mush-mouthed and creepy. 24/7 is full of huge, open spaces with just a few instruments streaking across them-- the sort of passages that trance producers and DJs tend to use for the sake of pacing and contrast. Here, though, they're the whole story. The album's sole instrumental, ""Bremen Cowboy"", is all breakdown and buildup; it keeps clearing the ground for the big beat and the big hook to come in, but they never do. And its closing 11-minute epic, ""Add This Song"", cannibalizes itself into nonexistence. The part Haraldsson sings is a desperate pitch for itself (to be added like an item on a DJ's playlist? like a vague acquaintance on Facebook?), and the rest of the song is fidgeting, flickering synths snipping at each other like they're running out of power. Dancing won't actually save your life when everything crashes, GusGus suggests. It might not even give you pleasure. But what else are you going to do?","The longtime Icelandic collective hooks up with the venerable techno label Kompakt on its latest record.

Florine,Julianna Barwick,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a7635e6ef95969320f76/1:1/w_160/f54c7659.jpg,2009-12-03 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13735-florine/,Florid,"Julianna Barwick recently told Pitchfork * *that she didn't ""think"" there was any guitar on her new EP. We can sympathize with her hazy recollection of the specifics-- Florine leaves a lingering impression of unreality in its wake. A breadcrumb trail of piano and synthesizer guide us through the misty forest of Barwick's voice, and we come out on the other side wondering if it really happened. The mood is blissful and bewitching; lost, but somehow secure. Using a loop station and pedals to produce cyclical patterns on the fly, Barwick's work can't help but recall Brian Eno's Music for Airports. Even so, Florine feels bracingly intimate and original, in its hieroglyphic way. The most cunning thing is how the music seems wordless at first, then divulges gentle commands, both real and imagined-- stay, higher, come back, choose. Because of the album's spare substance, these little imperatives take on a divine weight. And divinity is the spark that gets Florine going. Barwick begins with a halogen hymn, ""Sunlight, Heaven"", and then builds a cathedral in the sky, ""Cloudbank"". But when ""The Highest"" dips into tones of serene lament, her sacred equanimity begins to slide. ""Choose"" chirrups like Enya doing Kate Bush; ""Anjos"" spills Glassian waterfalls of piano; ""Bode"" epitomizes the cherubically neurotic flutter of Florine's second half. Nothing you can say about Florine directly accounts for its elegiac, magnificent aura. Except maybe this: Barwick has remarked that the album was inspired by her memories of playing music without instruments in church, and the course it charts, out of the choir loft and into the more fluctuant realms of leftfield pop and post-minimalism, could represent... gosh, all kinds of narratives: the loss of received values, the fading of religious conviction, the basic human learning curve from clean myth to murky reality. How fitting that the first song after the opening trio of tearjerkers, at the moment when the spiritual seems to lose ground to the postmodern, is called ""Choose"". This blend of uplifting sounds and postlapsarian concept might account for the music's sorrowing, joyful, dreamlike impression-- it moves in two directions at once, floating upwards to describe a fall.","Rising talent Julianna Barwick has her ethereal, gorgeous EP given a well-deserved wide release.

Good Evening New York City,Paul McCartney,by: David Raposa,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a77813d1975652139408/1:1/w_160/10797084.jpg,2009-12-03 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13753-good-evening-new-york-city/,Hear Music,"When it comes to a Paul McCartney concert at a sports venue in 2009, you know what you're going to get-- a little Wings, maybe some solo stuff, a whole lot of Beatles, and some stadium-sized production values, with a fair helping of do-you-feel-like-I-do stage banter. The CD portion of Good Evening New York City cuts to the quick, however, omitting as much banter as possible despite being spread out over two discs. At first, this seems to defeat the purpose of the live-concert-on-disc experience. Without the between-song bits, listeners are left with highly energetic and ruthlessly faithful takes on well-worn songs that more often than not fail to live up to their studio counterparts. In the case of the truckload of Beatles tunes essayed over the course of Good Evening, the qualitative gap between Citi Field and Abbey Road can be Grand-Canyon-esque. Some might chafe at the decision to use of synthesized strings and horns over actual catgut and brass during tunes like ""A Day in the Life"", ""Got to Get You Into My Life"", and ""Eleanor Rigby"", but that's as much a matter of logistics as anything-- recreating those bits of music for a country-spanning stadium tour might be a task that's too Herculean for even someone of McCartney's stature. As for the Wings tunes: old standbys like ""Band on the Run"", ""Jet"", and ""Live And Let Die"" are about what you'd expect, as is the sappy/heartfelt dedication to Linda McCartney, Red Rose Speedway's ""My Love"". A pleasant surprise is ""Mrs. Vandebilt"", a jaunty Band on the Run cut that might surprise folks that only think of the more famous Band singles when considering Wings. As contrarian as it might seem to say, McCartney and friends sound their best when they sidestep the greatest-hits cavalcade and give the audience something a little different. These offbeat selections certainly don't get the same reception as the more famous tunes, but it's nice to see McCartney give some of his more recent work a proper airing. He actually dips into that well after the first two songs of the show, following up ""Drive My Car"" and ""Jet"" with ""Only Mama Knows"" from Memory Almost Full and the title track from Flaming Pie. For ""Only Mama Knows"", the replacement of the original's real strings with canned ones is actually an improvement, and hearing someone of McCartney's advanced years sink his teeth into this sordid little ditty about airport-lounge hook-ups is a pleasant surprise. The same goes for ""Flaming Pie"", with the live version injecting the song with a sense of playfulness that the version recorded for the album sorely lacks. The highlight of the concert's eclectic first-half could be a moving emotionally overcome performance of Tug of War's ""Here Today"", a song written shortly after John Lennon's death that can still get something in a listener's eye. McCartney also gives the crowd pleasing versions of Flaming Pie's ""Calico Skies"" (one of the better ballads in Macca's post-Beatles catalog) and the mandolin-driven iPod-shilling single from Memory, ""Dance Tonight"", as well as two songs from the Fireman's Electric Arguments. After that album's ""Sing the Changes"" gives way to ""Band on the Run"", though, the concert becomes pure fan service, which, if you can come to terms with some of the show's aforementioned shortcomings, isn't half bad. There are some speed bumps along the way, like the treacly ""Day in the Life"" / ""Give Peace a Chance"" medley, and a totally duff sped-up and blister-free outro tacked onto an already lackluster run through ""Helter Skelter"". On the other hand, ""Hey Jude"" gives listeners a more palatable sing-along moment, the band rocks more much convincingly on ""I'm Down"" and ""Paperback Writer"", and Macca's tribute to George Harrison (a take on ""Something"" that begins with McCartney strumming a ukelele gifted to him by Harrison, with the rest of the band gradually entering the fray as the performance transforms into the version of the song most fans recognize) is the highlight of the entire show. So while the audio portion of this package loses something in the translation from event to document, the performances are good enough to make some listeners wish they were there to witness the spectacle, which is really all one could ask from a set like this. One would think that the live DVD packaged with Good Evening would make that regret grow a little fonder. One would probably stop thinking that after hearing Alec Baldwin's hopelessly portentous introductory voice-over. (If Baldwin's introduction doesn't wear down your resolve, his equally bombastic outro, paired with a somewhat scary ""message to Paul"" from an overamped fan, will no doubt do the trick.) In case you're not up on your Beatles history: One of the biggest concerts in the Beatles' career took place in 1965 at Shea Stadium, home of Major League Baseball's New York Mets. The McCartney concert documented here takes place across the street from that site at Citi Field, the current home of the Mets. Shea Stadium was closed in 2008, with one of the more notable non-baseball events that year being a Billy Joel concert that featured a McCartney cameo. (Joel's cameo in Good Evening, adding a little extraneous piano and belting to ""I Saw Her Standing There"", was McCartney's way of ""bridging the gap"" between Mets homes old and new.) In his introduction, over a slow-motion montage of the events in question, Baldwin recounts these factoids with the gravitas that one would expect from a speaker documenting an actual important moment in history (or an NFL Films highlight package), not a prohibitively priced rock concert. There's also the matter of Baldwin, and McCartney, repeatedly talking about the July concert ""opening"" Citi Field. While even diehard Mets fans might agree that the music at these McCartney shows was probably the best thing played at Citi Field in 2009, the Mets celebrated the field's official opening day way back in April, and played plenty of baseball prior to Sir Paul showing up. Once the concert actually starts, it's all fine and good so long as the camera stays trained on the stage. However, for the purposes of this DVD, there were multiple cameras scattered through the stadium, allowing fans to film the concert from their vantage point. It's a nice idea in theory, to make fans feel part of the event and to give those at home a sense of what it was like to be there. That sort of footage makes for great viewing during some of the sing-alongs, or when the stage pyro goes off during ""Live and Let Die"". But when the folks in the editing room decide to cut away from the group to show fans dancing in the concourse area, screaming, or sharing some awkward PDAs with innocent bystanders and/or offering their thoughts on how awesome and amazing the show is, it's a bit distracting. The only showy directorial flourish that the Good Evening DVD manages to pull off is, on paper, the most questionable one. During the performance of ""I'm Down"" (one of the songs played by the Beatles during their Shea show), the film flips back and forth between the modern-day footage and film of the Beatles playing the same song during the Shea concert. There's a slight disjoint in switching between the elder Paul and his much younger counterparts, never mind the atmosphere of the two shows-- the Citi Field crowd isn't lacking for enthusiasm, but they'd need a lot more sugar in their diet to match the unfettered frenzy that the Shea crowd achieves. As McCartney recounts between songs, the band could barely hear themselves over the Shea crowd, thanks in no small part to having their performance pumped through the stadium's rickety PA system. The performance footage definitely corroborates that-- McCartney breathlessly screams out the song's words, while Lennon and Harrison convene near an electric piano, offering their harmonies in a state of shock and awe, and with Lennon giving the keys a pounding worthy of Jerry Lee Lewis. It's a shame that the filmmakers couldn't (or wouldn't) offer more footage of the Shea show as a bonus to this package. If anything, one of the pluses of these crowd inserts is they distract from McCartney's cornier bits of stage patter, as well as some of the more regrettable images used as backdrops. This isn't to say that it's not fun to hear McCartney talk about how a faux-classical guitar lick he and Harrison used to play as teenagers became the basis for ""Blackbird"", or to see footage of the Band on the Run cover-art photo shoot play behind the band on the big screen. It's just a bit of a bummer when Macca resorts to tried-and-true Pavlovian call-and-response between-song shtick while switching between instruments, and even the most zealous Obama supporter would probably find it a bit much to see the President's visage drawn and redrawn in twinkling multi-colored lights during ""Sing the Changes"". Of course, touches like this-- the banter, the backdrops, the shots of the crowd-- are endemic of what Pitchfork's Stuart Berman called ""McCartney's unwavering dedication to maintaining his cheery, 'cute one' persona."" To expect anything different at a show of this magnitude, or of a document of said show, would be expecting too much. But where the music in Good Evening manages to mostly please without much compromise, the visual documentation of said music bends over backwards to make itself palatable to only the most fervent of fans.","CD/DVD package attempts the difficult job of capturing a stadium-sized show from the Beatles legend.

Felt 3: A Tribute to Rosie Perez,Felt,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a7775e6ef95969320faf/1:1/w_160/a375261f.jpg,2009-12-03 06:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13752-felt-3-a-tribute-to-rosie-perez/,Rhymesayers,"""Your favorite group that wasn't even a group to start!"" Murs makes this claim on ""Protagonists"", the leadoff track from his collaboration with fellow indie MC all-star Slug, Felt 3: A Tribute to Rosie Perez, and despite the humility this is more indie hip-hop supergroup than mere side project. With Aesop Rock on production, Felt becomes a triangulation that canvasses almost the entirety of U.S. undie rap in terms of geography and affiliation. So why is this thing kind of a bummer? It's got nothing to do with Aesop, whose beats go a long way toward invigorating Rosie Perez. Far from the gnarled and difficult production one might expect from a Def Jukie, Rosie Perez shows a good amount of sonic diversity while never straying too far from the sort of chunky, drum-knocking beats Murs and Slug typically rhyme over. You can't accuse Rosie Perez of being hookless: Even if Slug and Murs can't quite nail the double-time flows on ""Felt Chewed Up"", it's still nice to hear these guys do their own cheerleading over some pretty awesome turntable work, and the working man blues of ""Like You"" has an agile, back and forth vigor. The 21-deep tracklist is certainly foreboding, but the skit/interlude/instrumentals ""Kevin Spacey"" and ""Get Cake"" have a guileless charm that justify their inclusion. But you remember that Atmosphere album You Can't Imagine How Much Fun We're Having? OK, good-- now imagine the exact opposite sentiment. I have no idea what put these guys in such a sourpuss mode, but the celebratory ""we the best"" boasting of ""Protagonists"" proves to be a red herring instead of a mood setter. The rest of the way we get to hear Murs and Slug swap out the kickin' back at the BBQ vibe of their previous releases and go off on so many archetypes/strawmen you wonder if they even think they have fans. Either way, it gets to be awfully oppressive over the span of Rosie Perez's hourlong runtime for anyone other than the most insatiable consumers of complaint rap. Hipsters, critics, ""internet rappers,"" rappers who rap about violence (""Deathmurdermayhem"") all get dealt with, but in a manner so vague that their dismissals become toothless. Come on, I'm wearing a cardigan as I type this review-- work with it! Instead they save specificity for tracks boasting the concerned but condescending attitudes towards women I expect from a Taking Back Sunday album. It's one thing to lack sympathy, but Slug and Murs crucially forgo empathy too often, and their subjects come off like set pieces rather than real people-- oddly enough, the fantastical fairy tale character portrait of ""Henrietta Longbottom"" comes off like the most intensely written song on the whole thing. Even if you can get past the unctuous self-satisfaction, the lyrics are as lame to hear as they are to read. ""Bass for Your Truck"" almost entirely negates the draw of its speaker-blast beat by dogging girls who ""date losers 'cause it makes [them] feel superior."" Though I suppose I'll take that over Slug's insanely obtuse diss that ""the truth is just an excuse that you use to polish up a pair of selfish shoes."" Meanwhile, ""Permanent Standby"" is something along the lines of ""Welcome to the Jungle"" in its cautionary rendering of two women trying to make it in the big city, but the whole thing feels preordained-- both get caught up in drugs, prostitution, and the like, with only a lyric about ""dancing to some dubstep"" standing out as something other than stock characterization. I dunno, isn't Felt supposed to be a way for Slug and Murs to blow off steam in contrast to their more intense solo albums? Even the old-school party rhymes of ""Revisiting the Styleetron"" are rapped with ""I am being very, very serious"" intonation, and ultimately denying any chance it has at being played at an actual party. At the end of ""Paul Reubens"", it's announced Felt 4 will be a tribute to Heidi Fleiss, so I can only hope it augurs a record where the guys are more inclined to, um, enjoy themselves.","The cream of U.S. indie hip-hop—Murs and Atmosphere's Slug MCing, with production from Aesop Rock—combine for the first Felt record in four years.

The Treatment,Early Day Miners,by: Joshua Klein,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a69113d19756521391f2/1:1/w_160/6185cfe3.jpg,2009-12-02 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13564-the-treatment/,Secretly Canadian,"The first thing you notice about The Treatment, the sixth album from Bloomington, Indiana's Early Day Miners, is the relative lack of sonic cobwebs-- a bit unexpected from a band with a reputation for being shoegaze and slowcore revivalists. The percussion here is crisp, the tempos insistent-- even peppy at times-- and the guitar is slightly hazy but hardly dreamy. ""In the Fire"" and the Madchester echo of ""How to Fall"" are a far cry from musical wallpaper, and the band rarely embraces atmosphere for atmosphere's sake. The second thing you notice is that, for a band's sixth album (more, if you include Daniel Burton's parallel work in the instrumental Ativin), the disc doesn't sound like the latest endpoint in a gradual evolution as much as a new beginning, and this fresh-start theory makes some sense. The Treatment introduces Early Day Miners' latest lineup change, and with it has come a conscious shift in direction. Gone are the open-ended moodscapes and reverb excursions, making room for a newfound economy and an ear for greater accessibility. The Treatment's various studio effects are sympathetic to the songs rather than an end unto themselves. Daun Fields' backing vocals constitute perhaps the best effect of all. At the same time, the group doesn't always have a clear destination in mind. ""The Surface of Things"" and ""Spaces"" start off so cool, it's disappointing how static the tracks remain. What's missing is the kind of payoff songs like ""So Slowly"" or (the admittedly long and dreamy) ""Becloud"", to name two highlights, deserve. They glide along on cool basslines or swing with the weight of epic import, but fail to build up any melodic or emotional inertia to lend them greater force. That's not a real problem when crafting post-rock amorphousness or gauzy soundscapes are the tasks at hand; in those cases, lack of impact is partly the point. Here, however, Early Day Miners may have erred too strongly on the side of concision, overcompensating for past indulgence with a radical shift toward ec [#script:http://pitchfork.com/media/backend/js/tiny_mce/themes/advanced/langs/en.js]|||||| onomy at the expense of edge and impact. It's rarely boring, and often full of promise, but it's a direction that calls for further tweaks, experiments, and exploration to get the balance just right.","Indiana shoegaze/slowcore revivalists make a surprisingly crisp, economical record.

Dead Zone Boys,Jookabox,by: Eric Harvey,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a76213d19756521393dd/1:1/w_160/17580577.jpg,2009-12-02 06:00:03,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13734-dead-zone-boys/,Asthmatic Kitty,"It aired back in 2007, but I still vividly remember the end of VH1's documentary ""NY77: The Coolest Year in Hell"", when the talking heads were mulling over what had become of the formerly dangerous and tawdry Times Square, placed in contrast to that historically accursed year.  ""They turned it into Indianapolis,"" Jimmy Breslin succinctly said. And more or less, here you go: Aside from David Letterman and the Colts, Indy gets a bad rap, when it gets a rap at all. And sure, whatever. Indy can serve as a stand-in for generic urbanity, and it does more or less sell itself as the midwest's cleanest, cheapest convention town. At the same time though, Indy's the 14th largest city in the country. Outside of downtown-- which the chamber of commerce cleans up like the city's living room when guests come over-- there are more than a few unkempt corners. David ""Moose"" Adamson, as Jookabox (now without the ""Grampall"") hails from the East side of Indy, which is known both for the historic neighborhood Irvington-- which Adamson refers to as ""the Irv""-- and as one of the city's areas of benign neglect. Boarded-up former businesses, neglected slumlord-owned rentals, higher-than-average crime and poverty rates: you know the drill. My uncle used to jokingly tell out-of-towners he was from ""India-no-place,"" as a way of acknowledging the sort of cultural invisibility that guys like Breslin attribute to Indy. On his latest album, Dead Zone Boys, Adamson seems to take up that sense of inconspicuousness and civic inattention, and redefine it as supernatural: ""Dead zone boys wish to take your life away, and the desperate phantoms wish to put you in their place."" Sonically, Boys more or less picks up where Ropechain left off, but shapes that album's slapdash collection of half-formed songs and killer loops into something bordering on a B-movie soundtrack-- Adamson's own small-scale Escape From New York maybe. Jookabox is still only half-sane, but this time there's more of a method to the madness.  He gets Stockholm Syndrome with his phantasmic captors on the compelling back-to-back opening tracks, before later resorting to the artillery on the grisly guitar freakout ""Gonna Need the Guns/Doom Hope"". Sheet-metal boom-bap rhythms underscore ""East Side Bangs/East Side Fade"", a zombiefied extended metaphor for staying positive in the face of evil temptations, and ""You Cried Me"" is a sped-up hoe-down complete with helium-voiced werewolf-style howls, in which he convinces a girl to come with him to the underground. It doesn't take much: ""Now we can be together forever, you and me livin' side by side. In an evil way! Okay? All right!"" The first half of Boys has all of the action, and the second side can't help but drag a bit, namely the phoned-in ""Zombie Tear Drops"" and the bluesy meditation ""Evil Guh"". And like any cheesy drive-in feature worth taking your date to, Boys lets love win in the end, but on its own horny terms. Closing track ""F.I.T.F. #1"" stands for ""Faith in the Fucking"", and Adamson delivers that refrain in a gas-huffing slo-mo patois. It feels leftover from Ropechain, sure, but it works well here as a closing-credit sequence. So, here we have it: Adamson drops the ""Grampall,"" and sheds most of *Ropechain'*s ""fidgety surburban druggie"" tendencies as well. In their place, a new schtick more in line with that of Hoosier TV legend Sammy Terry, the host of a long-running weekly horror flick showcase that bore his name. Sure, he's kitsch now, but that low-budget Vincent Price routine still spooked the shit out of me when I was a kid. Different medium: no matter. That's an Indy indie legacy to follow.","Formerly Grampall Jookabox, David ""Moose"" Adamson here crafts an intriguing record about inconspicuousness and civic inattention.

The Seventh Seal,Rakim,by: Tom Breihan,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a766ea9e61561daa5597/1:1/w_160/b781618e.jpg,2009-12-02 06:00:02,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13738-the-seventh-seal/,SMC,"A new Rakim album should be a big deal-- or at least a bigger deal than this. Talking about the man's career, it's hard not to lapse into hyperbole, to talk like he invented rap, because in some ways he kind of did. The things that make rap what it is in 2009 existed in various forms back in 1986, when Rakim's career launched, but Rakim isolated, elevated, streamlined, and developed them. The seen-it-all thousand-yard stare, the twisty internal rhyme schemes, the innate sense of the meter of speech and its possibilities, the mystic codes that intrigued just as they alienated, the emphasis on sheer weight of presence-- these are all Rakim's legacies, and without them, rap would look very, very different. Rappers and old-head fans talk about Rakim the way they talk about retired legends; but Rakim's out there, hungry, ready to work, making occasional guest appearances. He hasn't recorded an album in 10 years, but he's only one year older than Jay-Z or Diddy. For a while, he was signed to Dr. Dre's Aftermath imprint, at work on a record that seemed so titanic (arguably the greatest rapper ever united with arguably the greatest rap producer) that it almost had to disappoint. But that didn't happen, and here he is, on an album full of budget beats and nobody guest singers, radiating rinky-dink half-hearted comeback attempt. He deserves much, much better. On ""Won't Be Long"", Rakim states his current aim: ""Complete my legacy/ Without compromising my artistic integrity."" In interviews, he's implied that he and Dre parted ways because Dre wanted him to record the sort of accessible gangsta music that's always been Dre's stock-in-trade, something Rakim wasn't interested in doing. And lyrically at least, The Seventh Seal sounds very much like the album Rakim wanted to make. There are a lot of love songs on the album, a lot of educating-the-youth songs, a lot of Obama namechecks. There's one song about God, another about the redemptive power of music. I'm pretty sure he doesn't curse once on the whole LP, and there's not a single crass commercial cash-grab here. That's great, admirable even, but you also hear what Rakim's missing without a Dre-level executive producer on board. The beats are generally flat, lifeless thumpers from unknown producers. And even the few decent beats from decent producers like Jake One or Nottz have to contend with the guest singers, who show up over and over and who feel like total dead-weight voids. No rapper would be able to maintain a consistent level of force or intensity in settings like these. Understandably, Rakim sounds exhausted more often than not, his laconic basso growl never quite as effortless as it once was. A Dre-type figure could also tell Rakim that it might not be such a good idea to rhyme ""euthanasia"" with ""youth in Asia"" or to point out that ""love backwards is evil,"" simply because it's near-impossible to make moves like these without coming off corny. But this is still a Rakim album, and that goes a long way. Some of the man's greatest strengths, like his technical rigor and fluidity, are the sorts of things that naturally wear away with age. But others-- principally the rush that comes just from hearing the unrushed weight in his voice-- have stuck around. Some of the songs here also make great use of the boundless goodwill that Rakim's built up over the years. Rakim's always taken his love songs seriously, committing to them as intensely as he does to his dropping-knowledge tracks; 1990's ""Mahogany"" is my favorite example. He pulls that off a few times here, talking about everyday struggles between couples without sounding like he's pandering or doing token for-the-ladies songs. And on ""Dedicated"", he brings enormous pathos to a song about his recently dead mother, making even the terrible-idea No Doubt sample on the chorus sound acceptable. But this album still falls way short of what it could be, and I have to wonder how this even happened. Rappers should be lining up to work with this guy, but the only guest rapper on the whole album is perennial C-lister Maino. A second-generation Rakim disciple like Cormega can score DJ Premier and Large Professor beats for his new album, but Rakim himself gets stuck with pale imitations of those guys' best work. I can't say enough bad things about these hook singers. It's not a new thing for rap veterans to make limp, uninspired new albums that only barely hint at past glories.

Toeachizown,Dâm-Funk,by: Nate Patrin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6e3b1335d7bf1698f22/1:1/w_160/f751b970.jpg,2009-12-02 06:00:01,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13634-toeachizown/,Stones Throw,"Imagine there's nothing funny about the 1980s. Block out your referential nostalgia, your tendency to make punchlines out of Cazals and keytars. Unlearn everything you know about Stock-Aitken-Waterman and gated drums and the synthesizers in ""The Final Countdown"". Try to think about how the music of the era might've sounded to you if you were experiencing it for the first time, without any knowledge of where or when it was made. Now you're ready to listen to Dâm-Funk. One of Stones Throw's recent breakthrough stars, L.A.'s Damon Riddick spent the 90s as a session keyboardist for assorted New Jack Swing and hip-hop acts (most prominently on the soundtrack to Master P's I Got the Hook-Up), and lately has parlayed his love for music into a popular 80s boogie/funk DJ night, Funkmosphere, at the Venice Boulevard club Carbon. His recent work reflects a confluence of these two bullet points on his résumé, as he jumps from retro-novel intrigue (2008's ""Burgundy City"" b/w ""Galactic Fun"") to indie-crossover remix buzz (his incredible transformation of Animal Collective's ""Summertime Clothes"") to the ambitious sprawl of a five-part debut album series, intended as a mission statement for what he calls ""modern funk."" That series has been pared down to the 2xCD, 140-minute collection Toeachizown, which shares the name of the collection from which it draws. It's your call how best to experience this stuff; each individual volume of the original Toeachizown series has its own thematic undercurrent (""Hood"", ""Life"", ""Sky"", etc.) and its own strengths, but this condensed aggregation pares it down to a manageable, cohesive 24-track introduction at the cost of editing down a couple of the songs. Either way, you've got a thorough rundown of Dâm-Funk's repertoire this year, which, even in its pared-down form, is an absurdly prolific output-- apparently it would've come out sooner, but the man couldn't stop recording new tracks for it. Anyone with a thing for g-funk should find instant geek-out recognition in this music, a garage-bound DIY love letter to the post-Worrell musical diaspora that covers everything from Roger Troutman's eternal bounce to the cosmic jazz crossover of the Clarke/Duke Project. In between, you get slow-ride R&B jams (""One Less Day""; ""I Wanna Thank You For [Steppin Into My Life]""), grooves that toy with the more prog- and fusion-influenced corners of funk (""Flying V Ride""), post-disco dance music (""Candy Dancin'""), proto-electro (""Keep Lookin' 2 the Sky""), and just about anything else you might've heard on the SOLAR label 25 years ago. There are nods to the retrofitting treatment that the cream of late-70s/early-80s Moog funk underwent once DJ Quik and Dr. Dre got ahold of it; ""Killdat aka Killdatmuthafu*ka"" actually sounds a bit more like 1992 than 1983, all sinister chords and bop-gun percussion. But calling Dâm-Funk's music straight-up throwback nostalgia only skirts what's really appealing about it. For the first minute or so, you might dredge up some roller-rink memories, but once that groove sets in-- granite-thick Moog bass coupled with drum machine breaks so propulsive their physical impetus overrides their mechanicalness-- it starts transcending historical allusions and becomes all about structure and groove, about how just plain fucking great fat Roland basslines and Oberheim kick drums sound together. That's about when you get waylaid by one of Riddick's solos-- fluttering and unpredictable, often flowing more like something that might come out of a free jazz sax or an acid rock guitar than a funk synthesizer. It's the secret weapon that underscores how seriously he takes this stuff, the catalyst that should provoke listeners to realize this music isn't just a fun update of a classic sound-- it's a work of real transcendence. This isn't a comedic tribute to talkboxes and widebrims; there's no Snoop Dogg descending a foggy staircase through a faded VHS haze here. Toeachizown is a deep, astute collection that feels like a natural resuscitation and progression of funk as it stood just before hip hop usurped it. Much in the same way that Sharon Jones and the Dap-Kings transform from a reenactment of a circa '66 soul revue to a distinct set of musical personalities the more you listen to them, Dâm-Funk uses all his vintage equipment as a medium to express his own voice, tucking a lot of stealthy forward progress and experimental tendencies between the notes. Chortle at that keytar all you want-- he can still make it sound like the future.","This 2xCD collection pares down the L.A. producer's 5xCD debut album series, intended as a mission statement for what he calls ""modern funk.""

Rated R,Rihanna,by: Ryan Dombal,Features Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a7689d034d5c69bf37b5/1:1/w_160/3db827ac.jpg,2009-12-02 06:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13740-rated-r/,Def Jam,"There was an exact moment when Rihanna stopped being a milquetoast pop automaton and started to establish a persona unto herself. It wasn't ""Umbrella""; however ubiquitous, that megasmash's most meaningful and believable utterances-- ""ella, ella, eh, eh, eh""-- meant nothing. It wasn't February 8, 2009, when Chris Brown beat her with enough force to warrant a 50-yard, three-year restraining order; though that incident and its aftermath informs most of Rated R. And it wasn't her piercing, uncomfortable, and ultimately valiant interview with Diane Sawyer, where she embraced her role as de facto domestic violence spokesperson with a level-headed understanding far beyond her 21 years. On 2008's no. 1 single ""Take a Bow"", Rihanna blew off a philandering numbskull and delivered her most realistic performance to date. When she scoffed ""please"" at the whimpering chump 43 seconds into the track, she officially put the ice queen routine behind her and entered the realm of full-blooded pop stars. (Her newly severe, emo-boy-esque haircut seen in the song's video did not hurt, either.) ""Take a Bow"" was witty, funny, and as full of attitude as kiss offs come, and Rihanna definitely sounded like she was having fun with the imagined breakup. Fallouts mark Rated R as well, though they are decidedly heavier. Over the course of the album, Rihanna puts a revolver to her temple on ""Russian Roulette"", recalls ""white outlines"" on ""Cold Case Love"", and even threatens to crash head-on into a boyfriend on ""Fire Bomb""-- not exactly the most politically correct metaphor in the age of IEDs, but it does get her point across. In a recent interview, Rihanna described the Rated R recording sessions as ""theraputic,"" and the vitriolic, rough, raw end product is about as brutal as you'd expect. The brutality comes in two modes: sentimentally self-lacerating and superhero defiance. The bulletproof guise is good for the record's high point on ""Hard"", a strutting statement of power bolstered by a roiling undertow of a beat from ""Umbrella"" producer Tricky Stewart. ""Brilliant/ Resilient/ Fan mail from 27 million,"" huffs Rihanna, slyly acknowledging the need for such an anthem while justifying its existence. The similarly chest-thumping ""Rockstar 101"" and ""G4L"" are harder to justify considering their mindless boasts and torpid production. The more melodramatic fare is also mixed. For every ""Fire Bomb""-- a stunningly overzealous power ballad Pink would blow shit up for-- there's something like the actually-quite-dim ""Stupid in Love"" or the lost-in-translation lesbian farce ""Te Amo"", both of which aim for Almodóvar but end up closer to Telemundo. The ballads also suffer due to the fact that they require singing-- which still isn't Rihanna's forte (tellingly, aforementioned highlight ""Hard"" is a near-rap with single-syllable ""yeahs"" for a hook). The strumming ""Photographs"" comes replete with teary-eyed remembrances (""all I've got are these photographs"") and a hint of poignant anachronism-- after all, most photos are a ""delete"" button away from nothingness nowadays. On the track, Rihanna is more wounded than ever, her voice offering as-yet-unheard levels of tenderness. Then, just as her sorrow peaks, the track is sunk by an infuriatingly tone-deaf and goofy verse from producer will.i.am, who can be a real asshole. It's a frustrating moment from an album pockmarked with them. Like its lyrical themes, Rated R's tones are decidedly darker than anything Rihanna's done; notably, UK dubstep producers Chase & Status provide production on a few tracks, marking a U.S. pop breakthrough for the bass-riddled genre. Specifically, the undercooked-yet-alluring ""Wait Your Turn"" shows promise for future dubstep crossovers, and the loping style matches Rihanna's dourness for better and worse (see: the cartoonish tough-chick clunker ""G4L""). Canned rock flourishes turn ""Rockstar 101"" [ft. Slash], ""Russian Roulette"", and ""The Last Song"" into instantly-dated missteps from a bygone era when a Slash feature was cool. The Stargate-produced ""Rude Boy"" is the flightiest thing here, a club trifle that would fit snugly on 2007's Good Girl Gone Bad. It also trumps much of the album's ""riskier"" material. Talking about Rated R in a promo interview, Rihanna said, ""Anybody can make a hit, but I wanted a real album."" Such is the flawed logic of a newly legal drinker who has known only skyrocketing commercial success. While the singer is trying to accentuate her individuality and independence with this album, the ""dark"" and/or ""mature"" LP is nothing new-- from Janet Jackson's The Velvet Rope to Christina Aguilera's Stripped to Kelly Clarkson's My December, the rebel record is now a de rigeur coming-of-age maneuver. Based on Rated R, Rihanna's artistic aspirations are currently loftier than her abilities. Then again, her tenacity in the face of the unimaginable public humiliation this year is beyond brave. For a while, Rihanna lacked a compelling narrative but couldn't yawn without hitting the Top 10. Now her story is overflowing, but her songs aren't sticking as they once did. Not just anybody can make a hit, and no one can make hits all the time.","The R&B star has described the Rated R sessions as ""theraputic,"" and the vitriolic, rough, raw end product is about as brutal as you'd expect.

New Worlds,Charlotte Hatherley,by: Matthew Perpetua,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a7705e6ef95969320f9a/1:1/w_160/1175db51.jpg,2009-12-01 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13746-new-worlds/,Minty FreshLittle Sister,"At this point in her career, Charlotte Hatherley is still best known for playing in other people's bands. She was a guitarist in Ash from her late teens through her mid-twenties, toured as a bassist for Client, and spent half of 2009 traveling the world as a member of Bat for Lashes. For fans of her first two solo albums, the fact that she is not known for her own material is rather vexing, as there is nothing minor about it. Hatherley is a confident vocalist and a deceptively clever guitarist, and if she ever experienced growing pains as a songwriter, she certainly got it all out of her system before penning her debut record, Grey Will Fade. Though her songs synthesize familiar elements of British art-pop and 1990s alt-rock, her style is distinct and refreshingly out of step with most of her contemporaries. This is not a woman who ought to be a footnote. Hatherley's third album, New Worlds, is her first to be formally released and promoted in the United States, and it is her most self-assured record to date. It's also the most lyrically focused, with nearly every track describing experiences and emotions in terms of color metaphors. Rather than attempt to evoke a state of synesthesia in the listener, Hatherley articulates a synesthetic point of view in her lyrics. The tell-don't-show approach is typically a misstep, but it makes perfect sense here, as the album's most thrilling bits come when she's excitedly explaining sensations and epiphanies that don't fully translate outside the boundaries of her imaginative mind. The point is not to totally grasp her crackpot color-coded cosmology, but instead to relate to the feeling of rediscovering the world and opening up to new possibilities. This is where she's all show-don't-tell: Even if her lyrics only scratch the surface of bold notions and personal revelations, the music nails the combination of urgency, fascination, and wonderment that often accompanies moments of profound inspiration. ""Full Circle"", ""Little Sahara"", and the title track are particularly effervescent and practically overflow with manic energy despite Hatherley's tight compositions and controlled performances. Gentler songs like ""Alexander"" and ""Cinnabar"" forsake gleeful intensity in favor of a pensive majesty that captures a similar sort of magic. Hatherley is a meticulous artist, and her songs are carefully constructed things designed for a powerful dynamic impact without sacrificing elegance and grace. She's the best sort of craft-driven writer, consistently avoiding ostentatious displays of technical ingenuity while subtly exerting her skill in ways that call attention to, rather than distract from, her melodies. Hatherley's focused approach to writing carries over to her lyrical themes. ""Full Circle"", the album's hyperactive centerpiece, is all about getting oneself to reject passivity and embrace creative action, and sounds something like a response to Marnie Stern's self-directed pep talks from This Is It and I Am It and You Are It and So Is That and He Is It and She Is It and It Is It and That Is That. Other songs, such as the lead single, ""White"", are more concerned with attaining a focused awareness of the self within a physical environment, and acknowledging how color, texture, and other physical stimuli shape our emotional responses. In either case, Hatherley is concerned with honing perceptions and getting the most of out of life by keeping her mind clear and alert. The primary tension, both musically and lyrically, on New Worlds is between disciplined focus and wild hair intuition. It's not a binary opposition, though, but instead a cycle that enables an artist to effectively communicate their ideas. Though Hatherley foregrounds the creative process in her lyrics at some points, she's never self-conscious or overly meta in addressing her process or her muse. The astonishing thing about the album is just how relaxed it all feels despite its mannered construction. The music never sounds improvised, but when the songs pop, the sensation is raw and immediate. Hatherley is not reinventing herself, much less rock music, but with New Worlds, she has refined her aesthetic and the result is an album that can draw comparisons to XTC, the Breeders, Wire, the Pretenders, and other top-shelf rock bands, but ultimately sounds like nothing else but the work of its creator. If there was ever a time for Charlotte Hatherley to finally enter the spotlight, this is it.","Still best known for playing in other people's bands-- Ash, Client, Bat for Lashes-- Charlotte Hatherley's third solo LP is her most self-assured to date.

Echo Party,Edan,by: Nate Patrin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a750c0084474cd0c0b69/1:1/w_160/7c7a76c9.jpg,2009-12-01 06:00:03,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13720-echo-party/,Traffic Entertainment,"For a dude who's been pegged as an old-school throwback, Edan's had this odd habit of turning hip-hop chronology into some kind of broken kaleidoscope. Just listen to the congealing synthesizers on ""'83 Wildin"" or the absinthe jazz piano of ""Ultra '88 (Tribute)"" from 2002's Primitive Plus and try to figure out just how they might've played in their real-world titular years-- not to mention 2005's Beauty and the Beat, which took its Bomb Squad-in-Beatles-wigs premise to a bewildering, psychedelic extreme. The fact that Edan's only rarely managed to create anything as memorable since then-- indeed, much of anything at all-- has remained one of underground rap's more nagging absences. And his first major undertaking in four years turning out to be a 29-minute mix might feel like more of a stopgap than the long-anticipated follow-up that fans have almost given up waiting for. Except that Echo Party is, as stopgaps go, completely deranged. Traffic Entertainment Group got the idea to set a mostly idle Edan loose on their old-school hip-hop archives for the purposes of creating a mix, and some two years' worth of mysterious alchemy later, the end result is, for good and bad, one of the weirder attempts to revamp the concept of an early-80s hip-hop tribute. It starts out conventionally enough-- a recognizable post-disco clap-break with some familiar vintage rockin'-it-shockin'-it lyricism, albeit sourced from a 12"" with more crackle than a burning sheet of bubble wrap. Then a creaky sounding piece of vintage electronics comes squeaking in like some kind of robotic slide whistle, the introductory break gets backspun into a sort of hissing slurp-beat, and things just go more haywire from there. Not to say that Echo Party isn't well-constructed. The mix does a surprisingly good job of maintaining a tight, steady momentum for most of its length, and there's more than its fair share of percussive breakdowns-- sourced from hip-hop, funk, disco, and go-go rhythms-- that prove Edan's ear is just as finely tuned to a great straight-up beat-drop as it is to the psychotropic inner-space quirks that've been his calling card. And it's not purely obscurantist thanks to appearances by the fondly remembered Mr. Magic and Spyder-D. But it does seem to draw from some of the odder corners of the epoch: ""Rapper's Delight"" basslines gone filthy, session-band noodling, raps about ditching this doomed planet for a life in outer space. And there are almost no moments where an MC's line is left unmolested-- lines get flipped and reversed, chopped up into haywire-synapse stammers, and tossed down into dubbed-out concrete bunkers so their voices can justify the mix's name. And the further Echo Party goes along, the deeper it descends into full-blown chaos, since Edan doesn't just stop at manipulating the sounds that already existed on the wax he had to work with. Aside from pulling a few odd tweaks with tape manipulation and reverb, Edan layers over his own instrumentation-- self-aware sloppy guitars, wobbly drum machines, banks of diseased-sounding synthesizers-- and pours it on to the point where most of the mix's last half diverts from the old-school mix premise and turns into a disorienting, almost grotesque flare-up of distorted fuzz and horror. And yet it still keeps that b-boy pulse going steady-- somehow, against all laws of nature and physics, though you might have to strain to focus on it. You could put together some pretty fucking alarming uprock routines to this. (An aside: the melody to b-boy national anthem ""Apache"" does appear-- but, along with a brief interpolation of the Rolling Stones' ""Miss You""-- it comes via kazoo.) Twenty-nine minutes does feel a bit short for a full-length-priced CD-- and ferchrissakes, get the CD, because the liner booklet that comes with it is a ridiculously elaborate typewritten transcript of every single thing that happens in the mix and it looks like some kind of rogue producer's shack-concocted manifesto. And this still isn't quite the official third full-length that people have been waiting for; Edan doesn't actually pick up the mic to rap on this thing (though he robotulates his voice near the end to thank you for listening). But if you've ever wanted to hear classic cuts from the dawn of hip hop turned into hallucinogenic setpieces that knock and clang like glitched-up King Tubby, Echo Party should justify whatever the hell it is Edan's been doing with his time over the past four years.","Much-missed underground hip-hop producer returns with an offbeat old-school mix taken from the archives of Traffic Entertainment Group.

A Retrospective 1998-2008 or I Was a Christian Emo Twentysomething,Lackthereof,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a7499d034d5c69bf375f/1:1/w_160/7299be4a.jpg,2009-12-01 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13713-a-retrospective-1998-2008-or-i-was-a-christian-emo-twentysomething/,Film Guerrero,"Danny Seim is best known for playing drums and singing in Menomena, but he's had a sort of parallel career as Lackthereof, putting out nine albums and two EPs since 1998. After self-releasing most of them in limited runs, he made the jump to Barsuk in 2008 with Your Anchor, his best Lackthereof album yet. That makes now an opportune time for him to look back on his long-running project and give people who haven't followed it (i.e., almost everyone) a chance to sample the best moments. It wisely doesn't draw at all from Your Anchor, focusing on material from the lesser-heard records. Seim has doodled illustrations and scribbled out complete lyrics for every track, and he's given it a title that reflects the central inner conflict of his life during the time he made most of this music. Seim plays and sings everything on all these records, and while you'd expect him to be a good drummer, he's good at writing bass and guitar parts that suit his talents, and his vocals, while mildly raspy, suit the songs. He's willing to push himself, too: His wordless self-harmony on 2003's ""Safely in Jail"" sounds good over popping programmed drums. It's stylistically similar to solo Thom Yorke, and when he brings the live drums and a small army of electronic noises in, it brings the song vividly to life. The conflict between Seim's religious upbringing and his own worldview is the subject of a few songs, but none highlight it more clearly than ""Abstinent Dry Sex"", which rides a fantastic bassline to the lines, ""You're bulimic/ I'm in love with porn/ I'd rather love you/ But that would be wrong."" The compilation is sequenced out of chronological order, but a quick check through the booklet makes it clear how much Seim's craft has developed over the years. The best of the four instrumentals is the most recent, 2008's ""Both of Us"", which is beautifully contemplative and essentially free of gimmicks in the production. The best track on the whole compilation, the closing ""The Columbia"", also dates from last year and benefits from being streamlined and spooky. Most Lackthereof albums before Your Anchor were uneven, so it's nice to have the bulk of the strongest tracks all in one place, though the occasional indulgence does slip through. ""Pimping Is Never An Easy Task!"" from 2002 is built up with shuddering percussion to the point of being cluttered, while the Wendy Carlos synthesizer solo that opens ""Half Off Drugz"" is amusing once. Other places where Seim appears to be entertaining himself work better-- the fuzzed-out Zeppelin crunch of ""Let U Down as Good as I Did"" or the odd beatboxing on ""Miko"", for instance. Lackthereof is an interesting and prolific project, and this compilation should make it easier to approach for people working their way back toward it from Menomena. Seim's well of inspiration runs deep, and people who've enjoyed his more high-profile work would be well served to check out the project that got him started.","Menomena's Danny Seim picks through the best tracks from his Lackthereof project, choosing from the self-released albums that preceded Your Anchor.

Blakroc,BlakRoc,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a772c0084474cd0c0bb4/1:1/w_160/7e9dafbe.jpg,2009-12-01 06:00:01,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13747-blakroc/,BlakRoc,"You might think the remarkably similar and undeniably terrible Black Lips/GZA collaborations from earlier this year would have made everyone involved in the BlakRoc project-- Black Keys plus hip-hop artists, to be reductive-- re-think their decision. But by being so blatant about what it did wrong-- combining notoriously sloppy and notoriously methodical artists-- the Lips and GZA may have actually have provided an unintentional boost. No such problem exists in BlakRoc-- the Black Keys recently toe-dipped into hip-hop by having Danger Mouse produce their last LP and their reverent, values-based approach to the blues nicely dovetails with the ethos of the MCs involved-- mostly guys who came up in NYC during the late and mid-1990s. And while this simpatico relationship ensures that BlakRoc allays all fears of being about as good as any previous rap-rock full-lengths, for better or worse, it ultimately serves as both the floor and the ceiling. If you're okay with ""solid"" being the main descriptor for a project boasting such well-known talent, BlakRoc won't be a disappointment. In the track review for ""Stay Off the Fuckin' Flowers"", Tom Breihan described it as resembling Edan's ""Beauty and the Beat, but with good rapping,"" which is pretty dead-on in two aspects. Raekwon is still in Gemstar-sharp Iron Chef mode here, in a performance worthy of comparison to deeper cuts from Cuban Linx... Pt. 2. Granted, it widely deviates from the typical subject matter on BlakRoc-- I suppose it's a testament to the respect given the Black Keys that most raps here work within the standard blues-rock tropes of hard times (most notably, ""Hard Times"") and no-good women (""Hope You're Happy"", ""Tellin' Me Things""). More importantly, in spite of the presence of tireless self-promoters like Damon Dash, Jim Jones, and RZA, they never go overboard and play up the masturbatory ""look at us, we made a rap record with psychedelic rock guitars"" angle like Edan and his ilk did, although the acknowledgment of the guys behind the boards make for the most awkward lyric on the whole thing-- ""fuck the white ones, the Black Keys got so much soul."" But the Keys and Mos Def make the most of the stoned salutation ""On the Vista"", the sort of sing-rapping about the kind of ""total control"" one only feels in a hallucinatory state-- it wouldn't feel out of place on The Ecstatic, and most importantly, it could close the door on Mos relying on Fishbone as being some sort of apotheosis of rock music. Meanwhile, short-lived Dipset hook lady Nicole Wray (the one who made 1998's awesome ""Make It Hot"" as just plain Nicole) simmers admirably on the streetlamp-lit noir&B of ""Why Can't I Forget Him"". And yet for all the brown-acid reverb, BlackRoc often comes off as a resolutely sober affair-- mutual respect leads to no on stepping on each other's toes or letting loose. I suppose the RZA's having fun, even if it rarely feels like anyone else is in on it-- he's strictly in quasi-erudite Bobby Digital mode here, where you actually prefer his nonsensical wordplay to moments when he's actually intelligible. Even if it never really syncs up, the attempt to match Zep-drum reverb to double-time Dirty South flows on ""Coochie""-- which isn't available on digital versions of the record-- turns out to be the record's riskiest sonic experiment, but even that seems too restrained. Yes, a song called ""Coochie"" with Ol' Dirty Bastard and Ludacris is too restrained: Think about that for a second. But even if the lame parts of BlakRoc are more noticeable than the enjoyable, what really sticks out is how easy this all feels--- not once does anything feel like awkward ambassadorship. For a project that spawned an accompanying tricked-out Camaro, it's a pleasantly modest album. And really, it's cool that a somewhat non-obvious choice like the Black Keys get to be involved with something like this. So, fine if BlakRoc's impact isn't always musical: At the very least, its optimistic approach feels pretty exciting when too many hip-hop fans are more willing to peel off self-satisfied jeremiads about the genre's demise.","The Black Keys combine with many of hip-hop's top stars-- Mos Def, Q-Tip, RZA, Raekwon-- on a surprisingly well thought-out record.

The Catalogue,Kraftwerk,by: Tom Ewing,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a76a5e6ef95969320f89/1:1/w_160/24515d5f.jpg,2009-12-01 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13742-the-catalogue/,AstralwerksMute,"Kraftwerk are a band trapped in the vast frame of their apparent influence. Aptly for a group so fascinated by travel they enjoy an image as the ultimate electronic pioneers-- ""the reason music sounds like it does today,"" as one BBC documentary put it. Let's take for granted then that it's impossible to imagine modern pop music without Kraftwerk and try a more interesting thought experiment: Let's try to imagine Kraftwerk without modern pop. What if they'd released the same body of work and influenced nobody? Would it still sound as good? This box set is an opportunity to find out-- a remastered, sealed-off package of what Kraftwerk (or at least remaining founder Ralf Hutter) would like you to consider its canon. This starts with 1974's Autobahn. The three albums Kraftwerk made before are beloved of many fans, but the group routinely ignore them as inconvenient prologues charting the band's messy discovery of electronics. The Catalogue skips past these to give you a run of five consecutive masterpieces, two albums whose flaws are at least intriguing, and then 2003's very fine Tour De France. Most of these remasters are available as separate issues (due to licensing issues three of them aren't in the U.S.), but the box as a whole is as full a Kraftwerk story as you're likely to be officially offered. As such it invites you to consider their achievements and development in relation to themselves, not to wider history. So why is Autobahn the official starting point? I like to think it's because this was the record where the band suddenly hit on one of the things they could do better than anyone else-- capture and make beautiful the precise sensations of everyday activity. Going for a drive, catching a train, using a computer, riding a bicycle-- these are terribly mundane things to create sound-portraits of, but Kraftwerk find loveliness and power in them without ever losing a basic accuracy. You might think of ""Autobahn"" itself-- the 22-minute breakthrough for this method-- as a perverse take on psychedelia: a recreation of a mindstate, not the altered state of a trip but the low-level trance of day-to-day travel. The electronic arrangements Kraftwerk were using turned out to be superb tools for achieving this: precise enough to suggest mechanization and able to showcase the group's gift for simple, wistful melodies (like Autobahn's ""Kometenmelodie 2""). On the follow-up, Radio-Activity, it's these aching, slowly unfolding tunes that make the deepest impression, on the title track and ""Radioland"". The album is Kraftwerk at its most melancholy and oblique-- wreathed in decaying fuzz and crackle and ghostly background tones. It's also where the band's remastering job is least effective. The remasters mostly add precision and sharpness to already finely-drawn music-- but Radio-Activity, uniquely for the group, sounds better the more indistinct it is. The ancient wireless on its cover is the record's ideal medium. Trans-Europe Express, on the other hand, is Kraftwerk hitting peaks of sublime clarity. Everything they do well is here: As a hymn to a mode of travel the title suite manages to better ""Autobahn"", and the opening tracks show off their emotional economy and subtlety. ""The Hall of Mirrors"" is the most chilling Kraftwerk song, a hollow man pacing a hollow space pursued by taunting, reflecting arpeggios. ""Europe Endless"" is a love song to a continent's history and new-found, hard-won peacefulness. The cuckoo-clock rhythms of ""Europe Endless"" turn up again on ""Franz Schubert"", clockwork keyboard figures that bring to mind the automata which delighted 18th and 19th century courts. As an electronic group Kraftwerk are routinely called futurists, but far more of their work is informed by the past. On The Man Machine, their lushest album, they do explore science-fictional themes, but it's the sci-fi of the 1920s and 1930s-- Fritz Lang's Metropolis and the earliest conceptions of robots. This era is a constant reference point in Kraftwerk's 1970s material-- a lost time and opportunity in European, and specifically German history, erased by totalitarianism and war. Generally, though, The Man Machine is unified only by consistent loveliness. Nothing has the dynamism or force of ""Trans-Europe Express"", but the title track, ""Spacelab"", and especially ""Neon Lights"" are thick, tone-drenched pleasures. Their next album, Computer World, took this richness and mixed it with rhythmic drive and conceptual rigour to create the group's most satisfying record. Computer World is the first album in The Catalogue with no nods to history-- it abandons the 20s and 30s as touchstones and explicitly relates to the then present day, that giddy era at the start of the home computer boom. Then as now, tech enthusiasts preached imminent social transformation with a mix of excitement and hope. Kraftwerk were happy to reflect this: ""I program my home computer/ Beam myself into the future."" But as was often the case, their lean arrangements and simple lyrics put them into a deliciously ambiguous place between delight and mockery. The appealing bounce of ""Pocket Calculator"" sounds rather faux-naïve after ""Computer World"" has coolly outlined the new networks of power which computer technology was enabling. At the center of Computer World is ""Computer Love"", its singer lonely and muted amidst some of the most delicately gorgeous synthwork the band ever crafted. Its interface of desire, alienation, and technology is a bridge into some of the music on 1986's Techno Pop, like ""Sex Object"" and ""The Telephone Call"". But where Computer World seemed timely, this follow-up feels like a bad magazine article: ""Five Hot Digital Trends for the Mid-80s"". Formerly known as Electric Cafe, it's a sluggish record and Kraftwerk's weakest by some distance. The first half is a suite of dry tracks about electronic music itself: people were making it, apparently. The second half is livelier and funnier, and the remastered edition adds 1987 remix ""The House Phone"" which becomes the record's best track-- as its name suggests it has a little more dancefloor kick than the others. Techno Pop-- so like a Kraftwerk record and yet so unsatisfying-- suggested that even the best of the group's material was a couple of bad decisions away from being enormously irritating. So it's easy to view The Mix-- a selection of their old work, digitised and retooled to 1990-era specifications-- with suspicion. But there's some great music on the album: a fierce re-write of ""Radioactivity"" and an edit of ""Autobahn"" that brings out the song's playfulness. Also, unlike most mix albums of the period this one had a purpose: these more physical and propulsive versions have fed into Kraftwerk's live set ever since. After The Mix, silence for a rumor-filled decade, and then at last new work: an album about cycling, built around their magnificent 1983 single ""Tour De France"" and probably their most thematically focused record ever. This wasn't simply revisiting old ground: the opening five tracks of the Tour De France CD build into a rippling 20-minute piece that shares only an idea and a few keyboard figures with the older song. This music is a wonderful piece of engineering, with the lightness and strength of a titanium bike frame, all weightless skitters and low-friction keyboard glide. It brings The Catalogue full circle, back to the impressionist style of ""Autobahn"" and the marvellous skill Kraftwerk have of collapsing the distance between the music and its subject. If you find Tour De France boring, that's surely in part intentional-- the aim of the distance cyclist is to hit an equilibrium where a genuine fusion of human and technology can take place, muscle and mechanics operating in a virtuous feedback loop. As with a lot of the music on The Catalogue, it shows Kraftwerk's true strength: not as futurists or speculators or robots, but as participants in technology. They are a band who, more than any other, catch in music what interaction with machines really feels like-- sometimes glorious, sometimes lonely and frightening, occasionally very funny. By presenting their story in its own context, The Catalogue does this remarkable talent a great service.","Long-awaited box from one of the most important bands of the last 35 years presents their output from Autobahn forward in remastered and repackaged form.

Maybes EP / Sketch on Glass EP,Mount Kimbie,by: Mike Powell,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a75c5e6ef95969320f61/1:1/w_160/9247e856.jpg,2009-11-30 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13731-maybes-ep-sketch-on-glass-ep/,Hotflush,"If you're still trying to figure out what dubstep is, keep in mind that people are already using the term ""post-dubstep"" (and ""halfstep"" and, god, ""brostep""). I'd rather not get neurotic about genre-- especially in the obsessively territorial underbrush of dance music-- so I'll say that Mount Kimbie is a London duo that makes pretty, mostly mid-tempo tracks between three and four minutes long with sped-up vocal samples, little tunnels of ambience, unimposing synth patches, and syncopated percussion that sounds like someone putting away the silverware (or that water-droplet effect people make by flicking their cheek with their finger). Small music, scarf music. Maybes and Sketch on Glass aren't always sunny, but they're playful, dreamy, and melancholic-- refreshing qualities to hear in dubstep, a genre slightly less emotionally versatile than hair metal. Even Burial-- its most expressive, articulate producer-- works in a kind of greyscale compared to Mount Kimbie (though, to be fair, Burial's music reaches a depth that Mount Kimbie's doesn't, and probably isn't aiming for). It's true that their rhythms are still dubstep in DNA-- deftly syncopated, slightly off-center, ambiguously danceable-- but most of what they lay on top of the beat sounds like it's being dragged out from places dubstep usually doesn't go: R&B, post-rock, IDM. Of the two EPs, Sketch on Glass is markedly funkier but also feels more self-assured and detailed: The bass is deeper but the sound is lighter and more agile; the plinks and pops-- sorta cute-- really ricochet around in the mix instead of just accenting it; the vocal samples are warped and flattened in weirder ways. Still, Maybes-- especially the title track-- is a good listen, and should be of interest to listeners who find dubstep's pervasive moodiness to be a turn-off (in his year-end column for this site, Martin Clark mentioned the group in a paragraph about records that went ""beyond the dubstep sphere""). Between both EPs, there's character, humor, light chaos, nice sound design, and real melodic imperative. It's strong music, and I want to hear more. Big ups, as they say in England. Oh, and some people are just calling this stuff ""step.""","One of the most promising dubstep producers is also one of those responsible for taking the dance genre places it usually doesn't go: R&B, post-rock, IDM.

What We All Come to Need,Pelican,by: Cosmo Lee,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a712b1335d7bf1698f8b/1:1/w_160/c182ad0a.jpg,2009-11-30 06:00:03,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13670-what-we-all-come-to-need/,Southern Lord,"Rock music developed as an art form with vocals, so when people hear guitar, bass, and drums in unison now, they expect to hear vocals, too. That's a reasonable expectation. The human voice is the oldest musical instrument, and the one that resonates most frequently with people. Instrumental rock attempts to supply that resonance with, well, instruments. This is a difficult task, given that no musical instrument is as expressive as the human voice. Pelican have worked with these problems for most of this decade. Early efforts, a self-titled EP and the Australasia full-length, got by on power and a little atmosphere. At that time, the band sounded like a more expansive, drone-oriented Neurosis. Its riffs were dark, and its tones were thick. In that style of rock/metal, vocals are often screamed or growled, adding textural abrasion instead of functioning as a lyrical instrument. Thus, Pelican's lack of vocals wasn't noticeable, since their guitars more than compensated. On 2005's March Into the Sea EP and The Fire in Our Throats Will Beckon the Thaw full-length, Pelican changed direction. They added light and shade, stretched compositions into multi-part opuses, and experimented with major keys and acoustic guitars. No longer could the band depend on sheer volume to replace vocals. Still, vocals weren't necessary. Once a song exceeds eight minutes in length, listeners' traditional expectations fall away. Pelican's current conundrum began with 2007's City of Echoes. The band scaled back its songs to more conventional lengths but didn't change much otherwise, making them feel like strings of sometimes-cool riffs. But the group shored up its songwriting with the Pink Mammoth and Ephemeral EPs, and now the songs on What We All Come to Need flow smoothly. Their riffs work with each other instead of next to each other. Drummer Larry Herweg, once maligned for playing metal like an indie rock drummer, has tightened up his act, not only keeping steady time but also providing a pleasing propulsion. Pelican no longer sound like they're grappling with their identity. However, the band is almost too comfortable with its vocal-less shtick. Now it's writing efficient, fat-free five- to seven-minute songs that, with a few edits, could end up on radio. And therein lies the problem: These songs feel like conventional rock songs, with short intros and verse-like sections. With moderate distortion and loping tempos, they sound like some long-lost Pearl Jam demos, owing much to 1990s alternative rock. Divest the Smashing Pumpkins or Hum of their singers, give the bands room to jam, and this album might have ensued. Without vocals, it feels slightly empty. The final track underscores this, as a guest singer lends a ghostly air to an Alice in Chains-esque dirge that begs for radio play. It turns out what we all come to need is vocals.","No longer grappling with its identity, this instrumental band now writes efficient, five- to seven-minute songs that, with a few edits, could end up on radio.

Buzzrock Warrior,Jahdan Blakkamoore,by: Patrick Sisson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a70ab1335d7bf1698f77/1:1/w_160/6557aa1a.jpg,2009-11-30 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13665-buzzrock-warrior/,Gold Dust Media,"Jahdan Blakkamoore's solo debut begins with familiar sounds: a coy flute melody, a clapping cadence, and then the sub-aqueous bass notes of Baby Kite and Nokea's ""Reef"", the slow burner that kicks off DJ /rupture's Uproot mix. The track-- co-produced here by Rupture and Matt Shadetek and rechristened ""Get Hustlin""-- is a shot across the bow from the Guyana-born Brooklyn MC. That opening selection might be broadcasting intentions, suggesting this heavyweight hybrid is another the-music-world-is-flat spin on bass culture. Buzzrock Warrior doesn't reach that plateau, but it does due diligence, rattling with digital bass and opening the floor to showcase the headliner's vocal talents. Co-produced by Rupture and Shadetek with a roster of collaborators, the music here drives but doesn't dislodge the bassbin, mostly settling on sleek, polyglot rhythms, some of which have been floating around for months. ""Go Round Payola"", a Shadetek joint that originally came out last year, is a restless bit of fizzy, 8-bit energy. ""Let's Go"", by cumbia artist Chancha Via Circuito (Pedro Canale), rides jazzy cymbals and bass in a tight but shuffling rhythm. ""Earthshaking"", a dirty shuffle produced by Brazilian Maga Bo, drops plodding low end over the sound of sizzling electricity, and Modeselektor's ""Dem a Idiot"" fuses strings and depth-charge beats into a midtempo burner. Buzzrock is positveily laid-back compared to something like the Bug's London Zoo. Blakkamoore's delivery gets plenty of room to flex, pointing to a promising talent who can bridge margins and is at home with dancehall-style riffs, dub-friendly pronouncements, and sweet harmonies, vital in a free-flowing exchange of global rhythms. He doesn't fully rise to the occasion, however, delivering a dexterous but not truly memorable performance that favors delivery over content. Blakkamoore bounces between loose and languid duets (""Rise Again""), duels with gruff MCs and soulful material such as ""Come With Me"", where he recounts his immigration experience-- staying with family as his parents worked and saved for his trip, his first snow storm, and middle-of-the-night quizzes so his story would be straight for U.S. customs officials. But his voice occasionally gets saccharine. Fired-up lover's ode ""She Said"", with pace-setting bass riffs, burns out, and the slack groove of ""The General"" is tweaked too far with Auto-Tune. On ""Get Hustlin"", he smoothly lays down rote and unremarkable lyrics, and ""Mesmerized"", a muddle of world-in-peril lyrics, is redeemed by Blakkamoore's alternately sweet and gruff wordplay while trading off lines with grime MC Durrty Goodz. Combining too many flavors can often dull the final results, and while this album is far from bland, it also lacks a compelling identity or strong message. A decent set of global grooves isn't bad, but Brooklyn internationalist Blakkamoore sounds poised to achieve more.","Co-produced by DJ /rupture and Shadetek with a roster of collaborators, this Guyana-born Brooklyn MC's debut offers a decent set of global grooves.

Stir the Blood,The Bravery,by: Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a75813d19756521393bd/1:1/w_160/2892a8ed.jpg,2009-11-30 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13727-stir-the-blood/,Island,"Nobody remembers Louis XIV, right? So the Bravery are just about the last quasi-big rock band anyone might expect to come within downtown sneering distance of a noteworthy hit by a bona fide pop starlet. But here we are: Sam Endicott, frontman for these oft-abused New York electro-rockers, co-wrote Shakira's Italo-crazed ""She Wolf"". He didn't, however, write the lyrics. New Order-style bass lines like the one on ""She Wolf"" could practically be the story of this guy's career. They anchored the Killers-lite dance-rock of the Bravery's self-titled 2005 debut-- particularly its best song, ""Honest Mistake""-- and turned scarce when the band dialed back the synths for rootsier wannabe-Brit mope on disastrous 2007 follow-up, The Sun and the Moon. While that synth-pop bounce is back on Stir the Blood, so are the group's shortcomings. Some are familiar, and some are worse than even the most hardened mid-2000s NME skeptics could've anticipated. Endicott's voice still alternates between operatic Ian Curtis croon (remember Elefant?) and adenoidal Robert Smith whine (remember Stellastarr*?). He still sings songs that manage to evoke greats from bygone eras without any of the greatness: ""Baby, we were born to be adored,"" repeats glumly hooky synth-rock opener ""Adored"", neatly desecrating the most famous choruses from Bruce Springsteen and the Stone Roses in a single refrain. ""Born again"" stomper ""Song for Jacob"" contains a sideways allusion to the Smiths' Louder Than Bombs, and make-out anthem of sorts ""She's So Bendable"" has that ""How Soon Is Now"" guitar wobble. Soma-dropping dystopia ""I Have Seen the Future""-- in which the band accurately concedes, ""I am a nerve ending without a brain""-- might as well be called ""I have become aware of the title and primary neologism from Brave New World."" Druggy (I guess?) finale ""Sugar Pill"" avers, ""I am blissed out/ I have kaleidoscope eyes.""

""She Wolf"" collaborator John Hill, who co-produced Santigold's excellent debut album, doesn't seem to have been much help sonically, either. Someone clinically extracts whatever trace of messy humanity made it through the first time the Bravery worked the nu-wave shtick, on their debut; Stir the Blood is a parodoxically bloodless listen. In another evolution of the band's sound, lead guitarist Michael ""Moose"" Zakarin now tops the cookie-cutter chord progressions with needlessly frilly prog-metal solos. See ""Hatefuck"", which gives the band's previous woman-unfriendly tendencies a shrill, witless apotheosis (""No one can hear you here""-- hey, wasn't that part of a David Spade dirtball-comedy routine?). As if that weren't enough to get us all excited, there's utterly unremarkable first single ""Slow Poison"": ""Burn, burn, house on fire/ I'm so sick and tired."" It goes on like this.","After a misstep of a second album, these modern rock survivors return to the synth-pop that got them on the NME's good side earlier this decade.

One Fast Move or I'm Gone: Music From Kerouac's Big Sur,Jay FarrarBenjamin Gibbard,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a7699d034d5c69bf37b9/1:1/w_160/0fa43559.jpg,2009-11-30 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13741-one-fast-move-or-im-gone-music-from-kerouacs-big-sur/,Atlantic,"Big Sur was Jack Kerouac's post-fame novel. On the Road had turned him into one of the voices of his generation, and the demands of sudden celebrity were too much for him. Living in New York, he drank heavily and got jumped outside a bar, so he moved to San Francisco, where he continued to drink heavily. Finally he decided to sober up and remove himself from the society that wanted increasingly larger pieces of him, so he trekked out to Lawrence Ferlinghetti's cabin in the wilds of Big Sur, where he dried out in seclusion and tried to right himself. He also wrote a thinly veiled fictional account of his experiences-- about the big demons, like addiction and messing with his friend's mistress, but also about the simple pleasures of washing dishes and meeting donkeys in Bixby Canyon-- called Big Sur, which only furthered his celebrity. Kerouac's sojourn to Big Sur is the subject of a new documentary by Curt Worden and a new album by Jay Farrar and Ben Gibbard, both of which are titled One Fast Move or I'm Gone. The doc is a fawning appreciation of one of the most romanticized writers of the 20th century, and it never lets the actual man obscure the accepted myth of troubled genius. Farrar actually appears in the movie, performing ""San Francisco"" while seated on the floor of a hotel room next to an unmade bed, and the scene plays like his version of rock-and-roll fantasy camp. Even so, he and Gibbard approach the album less as a soundtrack than as a kind of Mermaid Avenue project, constructing songs from snippets of Kerouac's prose and setting them to languid acoustic arrangements. The album actually follows the novel somewhat faithfully, opening with Gibbard and Kerouac crossing America on the California Zephyr: ""I'm on the California Zephyr, watching America roll by,"" Gibbard sings painting Kerouac as the most matter-of-fact writer imaginable. In both the doc and the album, the Beat writer is more idea than individual, and he seems burdened with everything that his readers and fans project onto him. For Farrar, who wrote all but the title track on One Fast Move, Kerouac embodies certain notions of America and Americana that jibe with his post-Uncle Tupelo output; Kerouac is Woody Guthrie with a typewriter. Once upon a time, however, Farrar was a punk in suburban America who displayed no compunction about hammering out loud and fast arrangements of old country tunes. Over the ensuing 20 years, he's grown increasingly reverent and deferential toward his heroes, which (like the worshipfulness of the doc's talking heads) saps Kerouac of his countercultural menace. Worse, it makes for an album about as listenable as a graduate seminar paper. On most of these self-serious songs, Farrar brings his usual unwavering gravity, but only on ""Low Life Kingdom"" does he find a melody strong enough to highlight that burr of a voice. For an album about a doc about a book about going into the wilds of California, One Fast Move sounds awfully sleepy. Taking a cue from Kerouac's spontaneous approach to writing, Farrar and Gibbard recorded the songs over a five-day period, with Earlimart's Aaron Espinoza at the helm. Trouble is, it sounds that way. Lacking the earnestness in folk-rock that comes so easily to him in indie pop, the Death Cab singer takes on Kerouac's words and Farrar's melodies, but he sounds ill-suited for the setting and so can't do much with ""California Zephyr"" and ""Williamine"". Still, the title track, which is his only songwriting credit, captures some of the novel's antsy restlessness, drawing out the title as a low-key bluesy howl. What this album about the so-called King of the Beats lacks is, well, a beat. Gibbard plays drums on just a few tracks, but he just hangs back timidly, barely even keeping time. The songs remain sedentary rather than hitchhike, steal a car, run, or hop a freight. This particular disregard is unfortunate, especially since the documentary takes great pains to point out the rhythmic quality of Kerouac's prose, which splattered words across the page the way Pollock applied paint to canvas. As a result, you don't get much sense of how his words sound, what they do, or what they can mean. For that, skip both the album and the doc and just read the book.","The Death Cab for Cutie and Son Volt leaders construct songs from Jack Kerouac's prose, all for a doc on the famed writer.

Flecks of heavy stoner fuzz and wafts of breezy modern rock blow in and out of Spells, but at its core, it's a ripper. Most of the credit goes to Sarah Negahdari; she's a powerful but economical guitarist, jutting in and out of the tracks like a jagged saw. And her voice, while thin at times, commands attention on both the stompers and the serenades; she's equally adept at twisting around the pile of power chords that is ""Silver"" as the unsettling buzz and hum of ""Turtle and Hare"". With all the right angles and sharp left turns underpinning Negahdari's acrobatic vocals, Spells can feel downright Deerhoofy at times, and while Spells goes glam and grunge where Deerhoof would opt for space and skronk, there's a feeling that this music could literally go anywhere-- and that Negahdari could figure out something to sing over it no matter where it might roam. This isn't to say Negahdari's bandmates, drummer Chris Hernandez and bassist and occasional vocalist Charlie Mahoney aren't worthwhile; with somebody like this in the lead role, though, they were bound to pale in comparison. Mahoney's time behind the mic is would've been best left on the cutting room floor; his two tunes, ""DeLorean"" and ""A Man, A Plan, A Canal"" are bogged down by lyrics best described as dumbassed, and despite a tumescent chorus on ""DeLorean"" and a Pavlovian Les Savy Fav thing on ""A Man"", keeping Negahdari front and center seems in everyone's best interest. Great as Negahdari is in the moment, the Hollows songs can feel a bit piecemeal in their composition, and they don't have too many tunes memorable enough to stick with you all the way through its many twists and turns. The cracking Whip-Smart-indebted lead single ""Death to Vivek Kemp"" gets pretty close, but it's the lone [#script:http://pitchfork.com/media/backend/js/tiny_mce/themes/advanced/langs/en.js]|||||| exception; it is the single, after all. At 50 minutes of occasional mania and infrequent tranquility, Spells can seem a little much  to take in straight through; it's eclecticism does occasionally feel jumpy, but the easiest fix would be to excise the numbers Mahoney sings and just let Negahdari hog the spotlight she so clearly deserves. As good an introduction to Negahdari's obvious and still-burgeoning talents as Spells is, it gives the impression her best is yet to come.","Promising L.A. band-- led by the particularly intriguing singer and guitarist Sarah Negahdari-- is another worthy entry in the 90s alt-rock revival.

Were that true, one of the last things we should be spending our time with in the final days of 2009 is the second record from a spazzy, lo-fi electro-funk band from Montreal. But to their credit, Think About Life's sophomore album doesn't feel passé-- even if the best qualities on Family have already been used on better records. Melding the four-on-the-floor funk and falsetto of their neighbors in Chromeo, the chaotic, catchy samples of the Go! Team, the eight-bit blips of Crystal Castles, and the soulful vocals of TV on the Radio's Tunde Adebimpe, the raucous, lightweight songs of Think About Life feel like they were designed in a lab to get indie kids dancing. Family is, however, the definition of front-loaded. Its three best songs-- ""Johanna"", ""Havin' My Baby"", and ""Sweet Sixteen""-- kick off the album, which then spends the rest of its runtime trying to reach the blissful highs of its opening trifecta. Thanks to a fixation with both radio-ready hip-hop and weirdo synth-punk, Miracle Fortress' Graham Van Pelt (the band's producer, keyboardist, and primary sound architect) gives Think About Life an adaptable aesthetic that is equal parts rococo hedonism and arty affectation. To wit, ""Johanna"" kicks off with an incongruously groovy flute sample before giving into the rhythmic horns and funky guitars that could be a bed for a Kanye single; ""Havin' My Baby"" is built on a sped-up sugar-rush hook repeated so insistently that we dare you to get it out of your head; and ""Sweet Sixteen"" builds a sexy, deadpan groove worthy of James Murphy out of videogame bleeps and a steady, sparse beat. As proved by the album's opening songs, Think About Life are at their best when they are playing fast. The furious energy of their buzzing synthesizers and throbbing basslines are often enough to make up for some of the more uninspired melodies or overly repetitive sections (especially given that they have washed off much of the noisy grime of their debut). But that is not to say that the album's slower moments are all duds. ""The Veldt"" is built on a plucky, almost dubby guitar melody and prominently features an ascending melody (with appropriately reflective lyrics) ripped from the Temptations' ""My Girl"". And the juxtaposition of the band's most synthetic impulses (the skittering, interrupted dance beat, the glossy, almost Italo disco synths, the chirpy vocal sample) against Martin Cesar's most world-weary, emotive vocals on ""Nueva Nueva"" is disarmingly tender. With its sloppy, homemade charm and riotous dancefloor impulses, Family is easy to like, but in an era of likeminded indie dance dabblers, equally easy to forget. Songs like ""Havin' My Baby"" are so winningly infectious that they will buy the band some time on the cultural radar. But as an album, Family feels a bit like the last gasp of an era.","We've spent a lot of the decade with a choice of spazzy, lo-fi electro-funk bands from Montreal, but here's one more worth tracking.

Now, I'm certain nominal frontwoman Clare Manchon, her husband and prime collaborator Olivier, and the rest of the band's contributors would claim a wealth of other influences, particularly classic makers of cosmopolitan pop standards and cool orchestral platters, who've lent the group's sophomore album, Arrow, its air of sophisticated frothiness. Yet it doesn't change the fact that overt Beatles simulacrums are all over this record, to the point where it begins to pull your attention away from any recognition of Clare and the Reasons' charms-- though perhaps those charms aren't quite pronounced enough in the first place to convincingly outweigh games of spot-that-soundalike. The Manchons learned melody well at the feet of Lennon-McCartney and the couple's other masters, as Arrow comes equipped with an estimable measure of charming refrains that linger with you long after the album, particularly the delicately wounded ""Ooh You Hurt Me So"", the buoyant ""You Getting Me"", and the swooningly swinging ""This Is the Story"". Unfortunately, these lightly agreeable tunes are ornamented by music that's even more unobtrusive. St. Vincent has lately demonstrated that you can construct a compelling aesthetic by juxtaposing highly mannered vocalisms with arty, unpredictable sonic fare, but Clare and the Reasons refuse to stretch beyond polite listenability in any arena. It's hard to encounter these songs and not daydream about how a little dissonance and unpredictability could add a wealth of tension and gratification to the proceedings. Instead, we get modestly friendly string-and-horn arrangements, and, if the band's feeling especially frisky, perhaps a bit of mildly burbling synth (""You Got Time"", ""Perdue a Paris""). And we get lots and lots of stuff that sounds like the Beatles-- the solitary pealing guitar blurts of ""Ooh You Hurt Me So"", ""This Is the Story"", and ""Kyoto Nights"", the ""Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da"" bass of ""Murder, They Want Murder""-- even the horns on the band's superfluous cover of Genesis' ""That's All"" hearken back to Revolver and *Sgt. Pepper'*s far more than anything from the Phil Collins playbook. The moptop mimesis reaches its boiling point on ""Photograph"", which manages in its two and a half minutes to evoke ""She's Leaving Home"", ""Eleanor Rigby"", and side two of Abbey Road (it also conjures up ""Paint It, Black"", so perhaps we should be on the lookout for Stones hagiography next time around).

New York,Frank Sinatra,by: Stephen Troussé,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a75f9d034d5c69bf37a1/1:1/w_160/72ddfb02.jpg,2009-11-25 06:00:01,Jazz,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13733-new-york/,Rhino,"This week Jay-Z finally bagged his first Billboard #1 single, courtesy of the civic cheerleading of ""Empire State of Mind"". It's a relatively thin jingle with which to declare oneself king of the hill, but then today's New York is not what it was. Once upon a time, claiming the metaphysical mayoralty of Manhattan was something akin to becoming Heavyweight Champion of the World (back when that meant something). Ever since some pie-eyed Long Island dreamer declared himself ""Walt Whitman, a cosmos, of Manhattan the son,"" the keenest, hungriest, most desperate sons and daughters have slugged it out to make the island their own. Norman Mailer typically took things literally and actually ran for mayor. But the battles for the city ring out like classic 12-rounders: Benny Goodman vs. Artie Shaw. John Coltrane vs. Charlie Parker. Andy Warhol vs. Bob Dylan. Robert De Niro vs. Al Pacino... With barely a contender to speak of, Jay has taken the title almost by default. But now, like a sleeping giant roused by the sound of his name being taken in vain (""I'm the new Sinatra/ Since I made it here/ I can make it anywhere""), the Chairman of the Board has risen from the grave, with a hulking 5xCD-disc box set called simply New York, as though part of some posthumous attempt to be declared boss of the joint in perpetuity. Never mind that he was a Hoboken boy who left for L.A. and Nevada as soon as Hollywood and the casinos called. As this lavish package-- complete with supporting quotes from Martin Scorsese, Nat Hentoff, Yogi Berra, Twyla Tharp, and William Friedkin-- would have you believe, New York was the capital of the 20th Century, and Sinatra was its voice. Not that actual music on these discs would go very far in making the case. Compiling six previously unreleased New York shows from 1955 through to 1990, on the face of it these recordings tell a sorry tale of grand decline. The 1955 set is a surprise appearance at a 20th-anniversary celebration for Tommy Dorsey, in whose band the young Sinatra first made his name. ""You know, there was a time about 50 years ago when I would have said you GOTTA sing,"" laughs Dorsey, inviting his ex-front man up on stage. Dorsey was famously, reputedly, the original guy to receive an offer he couldn't refuse, as Sinatra attempted to extricate himself from Dorsey's 33% of lifetime earnings contract in the early 40s. But there seems to be no bad blood: Sinatra is gracious, crooning respectfully through old Dorsey numbers like ""I'll Never Smile Again"", introducing a lovely Dorsey solo with the gracious ""you're on, Thomas,"" and only briefly forgetting the words on ""Oh! Look At Me Now"". Things are sloppier on the set from 1963, playing a staff event at the United Nations. Backed solely by the campy vamping of pianist Skitch Henderson (""We rehearsed for exactly one and a half minutes tonight,"" he cracks), Sinatra is awful-- forgetting words, insulting a stagehand who addresses him as ""monsieur,"" generally losing the plot. ""We've all had a lot of problems these last few years,"" he drawls to the UN staff. ""Vietnam, the Congo, Lake Tahoe... [Referring to his doomed Cal-Neva resort] Anyone wanna buy a used casino?"" The 1974 sets, recorded in the wake of the successful return-from-retirement TV special and LP Ol' Blue Eyes Is Back, are more rewarding. In the first, recorded at a Variety Club benefit at Carnegie Hall (complete with mawkish tribute to the wonderful work of the charity), his impatience with some of the crowd favorites, particularly ""My Way"" is evident. But in the saloon singer heart of the show-- a medley of ""Last Night When We Were Young"", ""Violets for Your Furs"", and ""Here's That Rainy Day""-- Sinatra is indomitable. The second show from 1974, the renowned ""Main Event"" recorded at Madison Square Garden in a stage mocked up as a boxing ring, is better still. Most notable is ""The House I Live In"" originally recorded for a 1945 10-minute movie pleading for racial tolerance, now revived as a hymn of post-Nixon national healing. (He was later to sing it for his pals at the 1985 Reagan inauguration). There's also a hushed, awestruck ""Send in the Clowns"" which makes you wonder what later Sinatra might have been like if he'd chosen to record more songs by Stephen Sondheim, and fewer by David Gates or Joe Raposo. Though he starts off snarling at the thought of Marlon Brando singing ""Luck Be a Lady"" in the film of Guys and Dolls, the 1984 set, recorded back at Carnegie Hall, finds Sinatra almost mellowing. The shows are dedicated to the memory of Count Basie, Don Costa (arranger of Sinatra and Strings), and, particularly, Gordon Jenkins (arranger of the starkest moments of Sinatra misery, including Where Are You? and No One Cares)-- whose work is celebrated with a stunning ""This Is All I Ask"". The 1990 show, recorded at Radio City, finds Sinatra grouchily insisting, ""I hated and still hate this song,"" as he introduces ""Strangers in the Night"", but gradually being won over by a crowd clearly in love with him. By the end, with a triumphant homecoming ""Theme From New York, New York"" somehow overcoming the limitations of his creaking voice, the cool has dropped and he's declaring, ""You're the most exciting audience I ever played to, I swear!"". If you wanted to make a real case for Sinatra as the voice of New York's urban anomie, gangster charm, and existential romance you'd need to compile a far different box: It might start with the shriek that greeted Sinatra's 1942 debut at the Paramount. It would include field recordings of the sounds of the 1944 Columbus Day Riot, when 35,000 girls tried to get into the same venue. There'd be the 1961 Carnegie Hall benefit show for Martin Luther King, Jr. And then the 1978 Radio City set where he debuted ""New York, New York""... Until that anthology, the incredible run of Capitol albums from 1955's In the Wee Small Hours to 1959's No One Cares, will have to do. Because, though recorded in the Capitol Records Building in Hollywood, Los Angeles, these songs remain the most vivid documents of that old New York state of mind this side of The Great Gatsby.","Compiling six previously unreleased New York shows from 1955 through to 1990, this large box is a sequel to Sinatra's similarly themed Vegas set.

Fall Be Kind EP,Animal Collective,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a761c0084474cd0c0b8d/1:1/w_160/ccbb636e.jpg,2009-11-25 06:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13739-fall-be-kind-ep/,Domino,"The first song on Fall Be Kind, Animal Collective's new five-song EP, is called ""Graze"", and it starts with a colorful swirl of Disneyfied strings as Dave Portner (aka Avey Tare) sings teasing lines like ""Let me begin"" and ""Let light in"" and ""Some ideas are brewing."" The song seems to be partly about the struggle of creation-- grazing on the imagination, maybe-- and then Noah Lennox (Panda Bear) comes in with his thick, honeyed voice to sing a bridge that seems a distant cousin of the Beach Boys' ""Don't Talk (Put Your Head on My Shoulder)"". There's tension in this opening section; the words and music suggest a sticking point, something that needs to be punctured before the song (and ideas) can really flow. And then it happens, the break, but in an unexpected way: a peppy flute melody materializes and the rhythm becomes a kind of stomp that seems designed to inspire folk dancing, while Portner and Lennox pick up the tempo and start singing rounds: ""Why do you have to go?/ Why do you have to go?"" The first time through, hearing ""Graze"" explode into this weird sing-along RenFaire jig is a bit of a shock. It sounds very far from what we imagine a hip, frequently name-checked indie band with abrasive experimental roots to sound like. And their performance of it is certainly not tongue-in-cheek: They sound joyful, and they're not smirking. (I'm not sure they're capable of that particular expression, to be honest.) And thus it becomes clear that Animal Collective, despite having become a certain kind of alt touchstone in 2009, doesn't much care about conventional notions of cool. If they want to get dorky and put in a section that asks you to bust out the medieval garb and hop around on one leg for a minute, they'll do it. And maybe they'll put this song in the lead spot on an EP that follows up the biggest and most successful record of their career. All this went through my mind before finding out, after reading Fall Be Kind's credits, that the flute sample comes courtesy of an artist whose name became a punchline after an endless run of goofy TV spots advertising his music: Zamfir, the Master of the Pan Flute. Cool? These guys aren't sweating it. Like their last three EPs of new material, Fall Be Kind exists in the orbit of the full-length that preceded it but it isn't defined by it. It's got songs written before and during the creation of Merriweather Post Pavilion, but they're songs that didn't fit that record for one reason or another. Given its fragmented genesis, it's surprising how listenable and of-a-piece Fall Be Kind is. ""Graze"" flows directly into ""What Would I Want? Sky"", a song that samples Grateful Dead's ""Unbroken Chain"" and is easily among the most warm, likeable, and melodic tracks Animal Collective have recorded. It refracts Aquarian optimism through a modern sense of uncertainty, undercutting the loop's jovial lilt with a tricky structure and lyrics that seem confused about what will happen next. ""Sky"" contains the first officially licensed sample of the Dead, and it's the best marketing move the band's organization has made since they greenlighted Cherry Garcia. It's not easy to take a cut-up voice and make it the centerpiece of a tune, and it's harder still to sing along with it in a way that doesn't sound forced. But ""What Would I Want? Sky"" sounds as natural as something that grew out of the earth. The final three songs are more abstract and dreamy. ""Bleed"" feels like an interlude, something the band might have put on an album five years ago. It's a shifting drone, with Portner and Lennox's treated voices singing one simple refrain. It doesn't develop or do much, but it's not supposed to. Instead, it serves as a bridge to the EP's darker second half, which kicks off with ""On a Highway"". Something like the A.C. version of Bob Seger's ""Turn the Page"", ""On a Highway"" is a lonesome tour lament. Over a throbbing, dubby background, which is punctuated by thwacks of hand drums that slowly rise in the mix, Portner offers a series of scenes glimpsed out the window of a van, and he gets unusually personal, even referencing his bandmate directly (""Sick of too much reading/ Jealous of Noah's dreaming/ Can't help my brain from thinking""). Lennox's closing ""I Think I Can"" is the one song here that takes a few listens to sink in. It's longer (a touch over seven minutes), with busier production (sequenced piano notes, synth pulses, percussion, and voices flying back and forth between the speakers) and a more circular melody, but the final two minutes provide a terrific payoff to the opening clatter, with Lennox repeating the title's affirmation in a quick descending pattern as the song finally opens up. At 27 minutes, Fall Be Kind is short enough to invite another play once ""I Think I Can"" fades out, which means a return to that striking second half of ""Graze"". When a band tries something that shouldn't work and brings it off, it's a sign of confidence. Animal Collective's focus and general disinterest in looking over their shoulders obviously makes what they're doing that much more appealing. But the most interesting thing about them at this point may be that, despite all the great music they've been making the past few years, it's not hard to imagine them failing. They've honed their craft and become very good at what they do, but there still seems to be a desire to go to unfamiliar realms, and it's possible that wherever they head next will turn out to be place they don't inhabit as easily. There's still a sense of gamble with Animal Collective, nothing is fixed-- and that's exactly what makes them an especially exciting band.","Ten months after the release of Merriweather Post Pavilion, Animal Collective return with an EP that finds them still on a creative roll.

Seconds,Gary Higgins,by: Grayson Currin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a748b1335d7bf1699006/1:1/w_160/02bb94d3.jpg,2009-11-24 06:00:04,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13712-seconds/,Drag City,"Connecticut songwriter Gary Higgins was arrested in the early 1970s on ""very, very serious"" charges for drugs. He served a few months in prison. After his release, he found a job, got married, and raised a family. But before he went to jail, Higgins made the album Red Hash on a shoestring budget during a 40-hour marathon recording session. Over the next three decades, the self-released LP spread through bootleg iterations. Finally, in 2005, Six Organs of Admittance Ben Chasny wrote, ""If anyone has any information on the whereabouts or fate of Gary Higgins, please contact us at Drag City,"" in the liner notes of School of the Flower, on which he'd covered Red Hash's masterpiece, ""Thicker Than a Smokey"". By that time, Zach Cowie, the Sub Pop A&R guy who signed Chasny's other outfit, Comets on Fire, was leading a one-man letter-writing campaign to find Higgins. He sent the right letter to the right address. Higgins responded. Drag City re-released Red Hash, and Higgins began playing occasional live shows with many of the musicians that had played on the record. He, of course, made a comeback record. Unfortunately, Seconds, Higgins' first album in 36 years, doesn't match the vitality of its backstory. In a 2005 interview for Splendid, writer Jennifer Kelly asked Higgins about his influences when Red Hash was put to tape. After he started explaining David Crosby's guitar tunings, she asked about his interest in non-Western music, ostensibly seeking the roots for the freak in his folk. ""When the Beatles went towards the Indian influence and the tabla and the sitar, everybody became somewhat into that,"" he answered in much the same way you might expect of your parents or your uncle and aunt. And that's how Seconds feels, too: avuncular and kind, experienced and maybe a tad bitter-- like a CD Baby adult-folk offering by someone with a sketchbook of songs, some friends who like to ""jam,"" and a new copy of Garage Band. While Red Hash was a collection of wonderfully refracted folk-rock that seemed just out of focus, Seconds errs on the side of the straightforward and sharp. ""When I Was Young"", Higgins' testimonial to music's tonic power, works mostly to remind how immediate the songs and singing of Jackson Browne and Tom Petty could be. ""Demons"", meanwhile, is an overly calm three-verse reflection on a debauched friend whose riches lead him to ruins. It begins with a duet for badly recorded acoustic guitars and eventually makes way for a harpsichord solo. And ""Ten-Speed"", a laborious seven-minute listen, suffers in the worst ways-- schlocky synthesizers, slogging electric bass, thick-string acoustic solos, end rhymes you can predict a few seconds out. ""She came to me in a hand stand/ She wiped my tears with her own hand,"" it goes. ""Then I wanted to fly/ Then I wanted to cry."" Seconds isn't a total loss, though. Higgins works best here when he sidesteps the grown-man folk blues trope, either by breaking stride sonically or by taking a playful turn on a somber subject. ""Little Squirrel"" does both, floating Higgins' wise baritone over a synthesizer daydream. With no guitar to chase, Higgins relaxes to ease out a tender observational parable about a squirrel killed by a dump truck. Sure, it's a tad pedestrian, but the concern in his voice and the reflective textures beneath afford gravity to lines like, ""Mama is high in the treetop/ Daddy is chasing a new nut/ Who'll be the one that will tell them what he's done?"" The 12-minute ""5 A.M. Trilogy"" hints at both Dylan and the Dead-- the former with its juxtaposition of two unrelated stories that, in the end, make each other strong, and the latter for the intertwining acoustic guitar lines that move from sunny consonance to brooding dissonance. Higgins begins ""Mr. Blew"", another droopy mid-album blues rock number, with a bit of spoken-word encouragement: ""Now there's just one thing I want everybody to know: It just doesn't fucking matter. And if there was one lesson out of this song, that would be it. Yeah, that's right."" In the end, that's the lesson of Higgins' story and this album, at least as it relates to any dismissive review like this. Even if these songs and their performances are lackluster, the tragedies of their characters-- the dead squirrel, the selfish ""Mr. Blew"", the mother mourning her soldier son on ""5 A.M. Trilogy""-- and Higgins' overarching insistence that the world will keep turning are poignant. After all, before Higgins went to jail in 1973, he spent 40 hours with many of the people who play on Seconds, recording Red Hash, the strange curio that, decades later, lent him a cult legacy. Essentially, he gave the last bits of his freedom to music before heading to prison and, then, into private life. That he was able to make another record at all-- let alone one with the support of an institution like Drag City-- says more about the possibilities of resolve and redemption than I'd ever care to say about the failure of these songs.","The cult songwriter behind the beloved, once-lost folk-rock classic Red Hash makes an inevitable return to writing new songs.

Distillation,D. Charles Speer and the Helix,by: Marc Masters,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a74eea9e61561daa5562/1:1/w_160/d3c58c5c.jpg,2009-11-24 06:00:03,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13718-distillation/,Three Lobed,"As one cog in the leaderless wheel known as the No-Neck Blues Band, Dave Shuford makes music so thoroughly unplanned that even he and his bandmates can't predict what it will sound like. NNCK don't just improvise, they don't even discuss what they're going to play, traversing many styles and moods with no safety net save the one that emerges from their collective creativity. Compared to NNCK's free-form tightrope-walk, Shuford's side project D. Charles Speer and the Helix can sound downright risk-averse. A straight-up roots-rock band, the Helix deal in moves that any fan of alt-country has memorized: twangy guitars, swinging piano chords, honky-tonk beats, tear-in-beer ballads. Distillation, the group's second studio album, is its most unapologetically traditional, full of 10 well-worn songs that rarely stray far from the patterns set by each opening bar. And yet, just as NNCK's seemingly random improvisations coalesce into unforeseen peaks, the Helix offer quite a few surprises lurking below the familiar surface of Distillation. One of them is actually right there on top-- Shuford's low, creaking voice, an impressively emotive tool that makes otherwise plain lines sound wistful, wry, even creepy. ""But in the end, everything works out fine,"" he sings in opening road-poem ""Mason Dixon Crime"", instilling the words with knowing irony. On the slow, stoic ""Open Season"", his bellow makes consolations like ""If it seems there's no way out/ At least you've earned some clout/ By tying up loose ends"" sound more resigned than resolved, suggesting that even simple goals like closure are ultimately mixed blessings. As Distillation progresses, the songs slowly grow stranger, and stretch out into looser, more open territory. On the intoxicating swinger ""Life Insurance"", pianist Hans Chew spins a comic yarn about the trials and tribulations of making all your appointments on time, even if your doctor ""just makes it worse"" and ""drives a beautiful hearse."" The heavier ""Gravedigger"" is even weirder, a melange of odd imagery set against rising music that feels like a classic-rock epic, filled with Chew's pounding keys, Marc Orleans' ripping guitar solos, and passages of wistful, ""Layla""-like sway. Interestingly, the album's most far-out tune, ""The Fallika Stair"", does away with words altogether, carving a path from Russian-sounding waltz to star-seeking guitar jam. Throughout these well-crafted songs, shades of proven trad-rock tweakers seep through, from the mature lilt of Wilco to the proggy curves of Stephen Malkmus and the Jicks, back to the ethno-ripping stomps of Camper Van Beethoven and even the stoned lurch of the Grateful Dead's most rural moments. But the closest parallel to the Helix's smokey croon is the drunken balladry of North Carolina's Spider Bags. Play that group's excellent Goodbye Cruel World, Hello Crueler World back-to-back with Distillation whenever you want to wash away any fears of alt-country's demise.","No-Neck Blues Band's Dave Shuford continues to find success with his roots-rock offshoot, which trades in twangy guitars and tear-in-beer ballads.

Escape 2 Mars,Gift of Gab,by: Jayson Greene,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a75bc0084474cd0c0b85/1:1/w_160/264a1f56.jpg,2009-11-24 06:00:02,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13730-escape-2-mars/,Cornerstone,"An early press release for this comeback album offered this surreal description: ""Escape 2 Mars combines various mundane elements intermixed with an electronic sound scheme."" This is the sort of insane statement you tend to come across either in a composition student's doctoral thesis or in an interview with a musician who has been awake for 108 straight hours on speed, and, considering the album's title, it had me braced for the kind of project that would make Common's Electric Circus look grounded. I wasn't sure whether to feel surprised, disappointed, or relieved, then, when I discovered that Escape 2 Mars sounds more or less exactly like a Blackalicious album. Whether or not you think this is a good thing probably depends entirely on your residual affection for early-2000s Blackalicious records like Nia and Blazing Arrow. The sonic template is basically the same, with beats split evenly between the sort of moderately bumping soul/funk tracks designed to politely rattle your Prius trunk and languorous, vaguely dubby ""space funk"" explorations. Gift of Gab, still a technically astounding but painfully limited rapper, comes off far better on the former than on the latter. When he is called upon to shower you with goofy, hyperspeed tongue-twisters, he remains pleasant company: On ""El Gifto Magnifico"", he packs his syllables so tightly that the yammering verses spring out like paper snakes from a novelty peanuts can. Don't slow down to examine the lines, though, or you might notice that he is calling himself ""a black nerd thug showin' you the total strength of what a word does."" Blackalicious were always nerdy, of course, but at least they used to be nerds trying out weird, audacious shit like the wild dragons-and-swords fantasy of Nia's ""Cliff Hanger"" or the insane tempo-switching lyrical workout ""Chemical Calisthenics"". Escape 2 Mars, sadly, doesn't contain any surprises. Instead, there's your sermonizing money-isn't-everything cautionary tale (called, yup, ""Richman, Poorman""); there's the save-the-environment ""Electric Waterfalls"", which rails against ""technology and cell phones"" in an uncomfortably Matisyahu-level Jamaican patois. And, of course, there's the ""all-rap-sounds-the-same-now"" rant: ""Mini-me clone MCs talk, but they all are sayin'/ The exact same things, the exact same themes and hooks the exact same way,"" Gab gripes on ""Rhyme Travel"", a not-untrue observation that would nonetheless carry more bite if Gab himself had varied his subject matter even once in the past 10 years. There is another moment in ""Rhyme Travel"" where Gab talks about testing out new cadences-- ""let me see how it sounds when I rap this way!"" he cries-- and it's illuminating. As a rapper, Gab is pretty much all cadence, a flow tinkerer so caught up in devising new rhyme schemes that he forgets to listen to what he's actually saying. He gets in his own way time and again here; on ""Dreamin'"", he flounders over a stuttering, malfunctioning-robot delivery while both Del Tha Funkee Homosapien and Brother Ali lap him easily by trying half as hard. Worse, once you extricate his words from the horkheimered contraptions he has ensnared them in, you are usually left with lines limper than day-old pasta. Would that he actually pen the misbegotten freakazoid space-travel opus I was fearing; at least that would have taken him someplace unexpected. As it stands, Gift of Gab don't seem likely to escape the gilded cage of the Okayplayer ghetto any time soon.","The Blackalicious MC makes a comeback on this solo album, which recalls...

"Oh, Glory. Oh, Wilderness.",Holopaw,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a74a5e6ef95969320f3b/1:1/w_160/a5f4fbb3.jpg,2009-11-24 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13714-oh-glory-oh-wilderness/,Bakery Outlet,"Have we had Holopaw wrong all these years? The Gainesville, Fla.-based band's first two albums were lumped in with the indie Americana crowd, thanks as much to their rustic instrumentations as to singer John Orth's 2002 collaboration with Isaac Brock. But a few years and a label change later, now they seem a band apart, loners entrenched in no particular scene but their own. Even the recognizable elements on their third album, Oh, Glory. Oh, Wilderness., sound slightly askew. The warble in Orth's voice, more pronounced here, is too high-pitched to ever be mistaken for Conor Oberst; the drawling pedal steel is more mood-setting than alt-countrifying; and the band arrive at insinuating hooks not with pop GPS, but with the patient wanderlust to know that each song will coalesce into something expressive and affecting. Holopaw's indieward progression from Sub Pop in one corner of the country to Bakery Outlet in the other only reasserts their peculiarities and idiosyncrasies, and if Oh, Glory isn't their most immediately commanding album, it's most definitely their Holopaw-est-- and a grower to boot, relinquishing a few more mysteries with each listen. Gone are the grafted-on electronica elements of their self-titled 2003 debut and the shambling settings of their 2005 follow-up, Quit+/or Fight. Instead, the band has developed a livelier sound that fluctuates between the looseness of Pavement and the melodic focus of Death Cab. The change in sound mirrors a change in line-up: Following Quit, most of the band members split, leaving core duo Orth and Jeff Hays to carry on. They rounded out Holopaw with a new rhythm section that moves these songs along at a more rambunctious pace, a new guitarist who doodles curlicues all over the songs, and a cellist who adds sweeping undercurrents to Orth's melodies. Oh, Glory tries to take in every style of music from Seattle to Gainesville, although Holopaw aren't merely shuffling through geographical traditions. They take many different avenues and incorporate many different styles, but nothing leads them too far from a unified sound. Horns form the bedrock of ""Little Stallion With a Glass Jaw"" and ""Oh, Glory"", suggesting neither Memphis nor New Orleans; with their fades, crescendos, and fanfares, they're more akin to Athens' Elephant 6 bands. Rangey guitars spike ""The Lazy Matador"", but it's the fluttering of Jody Bilinski's cymbal trill that drives the song to its measured finale. The band members bark out encouragement on ""P-a-l-o-m-i-n-e"" and ""Black Lacquered Shame"", their voices propelling the songs as forcefully as the rhythm section. Compared to the newfound breadth of Holopaw's sound, Orth's lyrics remain often startlingly specific, striving for a soft-spoken poetry that reads on the page as well as it sounds aloud. His imagery is striking and crisp. On ""The Lazy Matador"", he recalls a lover who smells ""like changing rooms, unbridled afternoons and horseplay and towel-whips and bathing suits rolled down off sunless hips."" On ""The Art Teacher and the Little Stallion"" a teacher inspires a crush when he tucks in a student's shirt and smoothes his hair for a visit to the Met. At times these songs approach Decemberistic levels of self-conscious erudition, but Orth is more restrained and less storybookish than Colin Meloy. Oh, Glory is motivated by desires thwarted and passions unrequited, and Orth's practiced quaver conveys an appropriate urgency and renders these songs as breathless inner monologues. For many listeners, his mannered delivery may prove as off-putting as Oberst's own vibrato, but for these songs, it sounds fittingly evocative, as if only he could sing them. In fact, no other band but Holopaw could have dreamed up this album.","Four years after their last full-length, Holopaw seem reinvented, sporting a looser, more melodic sound that moves easily between styles.

For Your Own Special Sweetheart,Jawbox,by: Matt LeMay,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a75e5e6ef95969320f68/1:1/w_160/773caa81.jpg,2009-11-24 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13732-for-your-own-special-sweetheart/,DischordDeSoto,"The eight-year career of Jawbox could be written as a cautionary tale: indie band signs to a big label, makes two great records that eventually fall out of print, and breaks up. But listening to Jawbox's freshly reissued 1994 major-label debut, For Your Own Special Sweetheart, it's difficult to conclude they made the wrong decision by recording this album for Atlantic. The obvious reason is cold, hard cash: Sweetheart might sound unassumingly direct, but it takes a lot of time and money to make a record this precise and balanced. The other reason is more nebulous, but no less relevant: You don't jump ship from a dogmatically anti-major label like Dischord to a behemoth like Atlantic without understanding that the next thing you do had better be really, really good. While a more naïve band might have diluted its sound to seek fame and fortune, Jawbox cashed in the chips on their shoulders and made their most uncompromising and ferocious record. Sweetheart's return to Dischord reintroduces the album as a win-win prospect: a record with a mid-90s alt-rock budget, but none of that era's corny or diminishing relics. Bob Weston's thoughtful remaster retains the dynamic range of the original while breathing new life into its low end; Zach Barocas' kick drum finally feels like a punch in the chest. The essential B-sides from the Savory EP are included as well. Even the cover art has been revised, the dated sepia toned blow-up doll image of the original replaced by a solidly cast marble figure rendered in high-contrast grayscale. The new cover is apt; FYOSS is downright sculptural in its attention to form and structure. The brilliance of FYOSS lies not in any one melody, guitar line, or drum fill but rather in the interaction between these elements. Every song is a thoughtfully interrelated system, an organic economy of sound, rhythm, and gesture. At times, once-distant guitar parts come together with such effortless strength that you can visualize guitarists J. Robbins and Bill Barbot bending the necks of their instruments in unison. Ted Nicely's impeccable production lends a subtle sheen to the album's pop sensibility but never dulls its harsh edges, revealing a band that is well-versed in both harmony and discord (no pun intended). At its best, FYOSS compresses the energy of hardcore into something more nuanced and deliberate. ""Savory"" is a masterfully constructed study in tension and release, as Robbins' simple vocal melody is made infinitely more potent by layers of dissonant guitar chords, sparse bass, and violent, propulsive drumming. Even the song's angelic chorus seems subtly unresolved and menacing, though Robbins' and Barbot's guitars chime rather than stab. The guitar ""solo"" consists of little more than occasional muted feedback bursts, instead serving to emphasize the monolithic force of the band's rhythm section in the absence of Robbins' vocals. The J.G. Ballard-inspired ""Motorist"" narrates a car crash as metallic guitars jut out from a spare, skeletal frame. ""Cruel Swing"" sounds exactly like you'd think, Barocas absolutely pummeling his kit over a walking bass figure that sounds like it's challenging you to a fight. Album closer ""Whitney Walks"" contorts the limitations of Robbins' vocal range into a uniquely seething, uneasy kind of melancholy that perfectly prefigures the song's explosive finale. The highlight of this reissue of Sweetheart, however, may very well be Savory B-side ""68"". For an odd-time-signature rock song, ""68"" is disarmingly elegant, to the point where you barely even notice that it's chugging along in 7/4. Here, you can understand why the Dismemberment Plan were quick to cite Jawbox as an influence: The improbable chord changes and impossible rhythmic ideas on FYOSS are rendered as seamless and intuitive as possible. Though the playing here is solid throughout, nothing about the record is flashy or unattainable-- restraint and discipline consistently best self-aware complexity. While FYOSS itself doesn't sound dated, the notion that plainly recorded guitar, bass, drums, and vocals can add up to something extraordinary sometimes does. The onslaught of radio-friendly ""alternative"" bands that followed Jawbox has left us understandably wary of well-produced, punk-informed rock music with no obvious quirks or departures. But FYOSS has aged well precisely because it did not pander to the aesthetic fads of its time-- mainstream or underground. Instead, Jawbox honed their sound, maximized the resources at their disposal, and made a record that hides behind no extraneous instruments, sounds, or ideologies.","The D.C. band's 1994 major label debut, long out of print, has been reissued by Dischord and DeSoto, and it has aged exceedingly well.

Trust in Numbers,Lake Heartbeat,by: Zach Kelly,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a74f13d19756521393aa/1:1/w_160/02613e7a.jpg,2009-11-23 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13719-trust-in-numbers/,Service,"Trust in Numbers is Lake Heartbeat's inaugural bow at Service, one of a very precious few labels responsible for a sort of Swedish pop renaissance in the past few years. But unlike labelmates the Embassy or the Tough Alliance, Lake Heartbeat has little to no predilection for the quirky or slightly obtuse-- boasting a set of cleanly cultivated songs that employ a definitive celestial theme, their debut is a delicate reminder of how easy it is to still appreciate this brand of wistfully earnest pop romanticism. If it weren't for Dan Lissvik (one-half of the Balearic duo Studio)-- whose production lends a stardusted quality to the music that's so well honed it often upstages the actual songwriting-- Numbers would likely fail to register as full and melodic as it is here in finished form. By submerging these stately singer-songwriter sketches in shimmeringly ethereal sonic environments, the record takes on an authentically transportive quality that joyously maps a strange and unfamiliar world where prom night was not only fun and meaningful, but the student council actually managed to pull-off the ""Midsummer Night's Dream"" theme. In Stockholm, Sweden, where the duo-- former Brainpool frontman Janne Kask on vocal and electronics duty and guitarist Kallå Kåks-- is based, they're approaching that time of year where the city will be subjugated to 17 hours of darkness a day. And though there's certainly nothing dark about Lake Heartbeat, it makes perfect sense-- in Stockholm, at least-- to sit down with Numbers right now. Perhaps doomed to be lazily tagged as ""summery"" in some respects (the word itself is sung at least half a dozen times), this is a record that operates quite oppositely as perfectly suited for star-gazing: While the bulk of the lyrical content is steeped in love's cause and effect (heartbreak and longing, specifically), it's impossible to ignore the cosmic inclinations that afford this album much of its chilled, intoxicating whimsy. Almost everything is coated in dream-drenched twinkles, moonlit synth bursts, and loose gossamer guitar work, bolstered by playfully low-key beat programming and Kask's breathy, frost-bitten vocals. Reminiscence of a former love on ""Blue Planet"" finds Kask recalling lights in the sky and a promise that's now ""a thousand miles away""-- much like with the rest of Numbers, its heart remains in orbit no matter how landlocked the owner may be. So it goes without saying that it's a little schmaltzy. Songs with more oomph tend to fare better: ""Pipedream"" has a polite anthemic quality to it, affording the peppy yacht-rock template some substance; ""Build the Wall Up"" nicks Spandau Ballet's ""True"" for a sparklingly airy lovers-only mid-tempo waltz. Wisely, the more patient numbers-- like the diluted-M83 appeal of ""Between Dreams"" or the irrepressibly comely ""Southbound""-- feature wonderfully balanced female backing vocals that add melodic shape to Kask's verging-on-the-creepy hushed tone. When left to handle long stretches of verse on his own, like on the tepid mostly-acoustic closer ""Let It Die"", the absence of all that fanciful hypnotic resonance renders things downright hammy. But the big starry-eyed moments win out with each repeated listen, even if songs like ""Mars By Night"" share more in common with a John Mayer deep-cut than anything this side of Jens Lekman. There's either a fun 1960s pop twist (""Golden Chain"") or a guardedly erotic soft-rock jam (""Between Dreams"", ""Southbound"") to move onto, sublimely woven into the fabric of this big, swirling dreamscape. For the most part: pretty far-out.","Latest find from Service, the Swedish indie pop label that helped launch the Tough Alliance and Jens Lekman. Studio's Dan Lissvik produces.

Ouled Bambara: Portraits of Gnawa,Various Artists,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a753c0084474cd0c0b73/1:1/w_160/4481d23b.jpg,2009-11-23 06:00:03,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13723-ouled-bambara-portraits-of-gnawa/,Drag CityTwos & Fews,"To build a truly deep understanding of Gnawa music, its history, the story of the people who play it, and the religious and superstitious beliefs that inform it and determine its structure, you'd probably have to read a few books or live your whole life in Morocco. I'll give the digest version here. There, Gnawa are practitioners of a musical-spiritual tradition rooted in Sufism, a mystical strain of Islam. The Gnawa tradition has its deepest roots in the Arab slave trade, in which sub-Saharan Africans were kidnapped and brought north over the desert to the Maghreb, in modern-day Morocco and Algeria, though today there is no ethnic dimension to it. Gnawa musicians, mystics, and dancers provide a communication conduit between people and the jinn, unseen beings of smokeless fire that are important not to anger. The word is the source of our ""genie,"" and one particular type of jinn, the mluk (literally, ""the owners"") is said to possess people who cross its path. One of the purposes of Gnawa ceremony is to negotiate with the mluk and send it packing-- it dovetails with the Sufi quest for spiritual purity. An ""Ouled Bambara"" is a suite of Gnawa songs played during the Fraja, or entertainment, phase of a Gnawa ceremony. This set of field recordings made in Marrakesh by Caitlin McNally offers samplings of both this phase and the actual mluk phase. The recording carries the sonic flavor of the courtyards in which it was made, and the musical ingredients are simple. The singing is essentially a series of solo and group chants, and it doesn't follow any song forms familiar to Western ears. The whole body of music evolves as one, pushed along by hand claps on some tracks, and iron castanets or shakers on others, and at the heart of the sound is the guimbri, a three-stringed, guitar-like instrument with a large, closed rectangular resonating box. The instrument has loose, thick strings and plays in a bass register, and the musicians frequently drum on the resonator while playing. While it provides a harmonic outline, the primary function of the guimbri is rhythmic, and the musicians favor gradually shifting patterns, changing tempos and rhythmic emphasis as the song suites unfold. The CD offers about an hour of recorded ceremonial music, and it's very transporting. Even without the extensive liner notes, it's an interesting experience to sit in on a ceremony so different from any of our own. The accompanying half-hour DVD adds a visual dimension, showing the playing techniques for the guimbri and castanets, giving us a glimpse of the dances and trance states, including one somewhat frightening moment where a trancing dancer collapses. It includes interviews with each performer and brief insight into their lives. Mohamed Hamada, the same dancer who collapses, works a day job stoking the flames of a furnace, while Brahim Belkani shows off photos of himself with Dizzy Gillespie, Robert Plant, and Jimmy Page. It's hard to rate a recording like this in the context of a bunch of indie rock and hip hop records, because it comes from a different angle entirely-- music in this world is spiritual currency, not a product or a showcase, and it's important not to go into listening to it expecting something catchy or straightforwardly funky. It's a genuine field recording and makes no concessions to pop convention or avant-garde ideas. Of course, that's also what makes it a fantastic document of a unique and thriving cultural tradition, one that has a curious place in Moroccan society as neither mainstream nor outcast. Come to listen with the right mindset, and you'll learn a lot about it.","This CD/DVD package documents the suite of songs played in Moroccan Gnawa ceremony; it's music that's more spiritual currency than a product or showcase.

Idol Omen,Glass Ghost,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a7529d034d5c69bf3776/1:1/w_160/d1246414.jpg,2009-11-23 06:00:02,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13722-idol-omen/,Western Vinyl,"The music of Glass Ghost, a Brooklyn duo assisted on Idol Omen by guest stars like Luke Temple and Joan Wasser, is eerie and elusive-- the musical equivalent of a word on the tip of your tongue. Eliot Krimsky sings about everyday mysteries in a relaxed, uncanny falsetto, tending to keyboards that dryly flicker and drone. Instruments from the classical world, as well as various junk percussion and vocal harmonies, meld unobtrusively, with the same laconic drift. The songs feel paradoxically compact and diffused, thanks to Mike Johnson's careful blend of live and electronic drums. His gauze-wrapped take on hip-hop makes all the wispy scrollwork feel unaccountably durable and lively. Just looking through Glass Ghost's early press clues you in to the difficulties of classifying them-- people have already cited Deerhoof, Captain Beefheart, Dirty Projectors, and J Dilla, comparisons that range from approximate to baffling. Glass Ghost truly resemble just one band I can think of, and them only abstractly: the Dismemberment Plan circa Change, whittled down to the most salient gestures. It's all there on opening track ""Time Saving Trick""-- the hip-hop swing disarticulated in shining banks of fog, the wafting existentialism, the unspoken melancholy. And ""Mechanical Life"", with pointillist bass and skating keyboards, is mostly about brushing your teeth in a mirror. It perfectly captures the sort of mundane, displaced, anxious introspection that the Dismemberment Plan borrowed from Talking Heads and ran with so fruitfully. That said, Glass Ghost is less lovable than the Dismemberment Plan-- perhaps less ingratiating. They're relentlessly sleepy and captivating, all ""Sentimental Man"" and no ""Following Through"". The complacent tonal register, Krimsky's dusky singing, and the deliberate scrawniness of the music all promise to be highly divisive, as most unique things are. And there are a few moments when the taste level falters-- on ""Ending"", when Krimsky sings, ""There's a place way up high where I hold my soul and cry,"" you hope he gets back to cryptic circumlocution quickly. ""The Same"" sports a poppier, more bugged-out look that Glass Ghost wear a bit less comfortably than swirling evasion. They're at their best on ""Time Saving Device"" and ""Mechanical Life"", not to mention ""Divisions"", with its ice-drop synth arpeggios, or ""Like a Diamond"", where a piercing vocal melody floats over keyboards like reflected clouds on scattered rain puddles. This is subtle, spooked, reflective music-- a distracted elegy for something or other.","Brooklyn duo gets assists from Luke Temple (Here We Go Magic) and Joan as Police Woman on its eerie, elusive, late D Plan-like new album.

Can You Dig It? The Music and Politics of Black Action Films 1968-75,Various Artists,by: Nate Patrin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a727b1335d7bf1698fc0/1:1/w_160/fa20fcd0.jpg,2009-11-23 06:00:01,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13683-can-you-dig-it-the-music-and-politics-of-black-action-films-1968-75/,Soul Jazz,"There's an interview with Curtis Mayfield on Rhino's 2xCD reissue of his Super Fly soundtrack that puts the contradictions of blaxploitation cinema's relationship with soul music into sharp, clear terms. ""For film, I usually would follow a script, and the script and its contents and all the characters and what the story was about would basically furnish me with ideas and depth to get actually into the happenings of that particular movie for scoring. However, when you're writing, just in general, you use the society and the happenings about yourself, the observances-- that becomes your script."" The perception of life through the lens of entertainment came through two separate channels when the rise of black action films in the 1970s coincided with the peak of soul music's conscious period. And when those two art forms combined in an attempt to define African-American pop culture in the post-civil rights era, a precarious balance was struck. The eyes see the hustler in his custom Cadillac, take-no-shit masculinity defined through his money and his sexual conquests and the way he throws his weight around; the ears hear a portrayal of that man as ""a victim of ghetto demands... been told I can't be nothin' else, just a hustler in spite of myself."" Mayfield's ""Pusherman""-- along with Willie Hutch's ""Brother's Gonna Work It Out"", Bobby Womack's ""Across 110th Street"", James Brown's ""Down and Out in New York City"", and many other songs-- represents that contradiction as part of Soul Jazz's 2xCD, 34-track collection Can You Dig It? The Music and Politics of Black Action Films 1968-1975. And because it's such a wide-ranging collection for its size, this box tells a thorough story just through the names on the back. You have stars at their peak, up-and-comers, fusion icons, jazz innovators turned soundtrack specialists, and a few composers who adapted to the genre from the outside. (The theme to The Soul of Nigger Charley, for instance, was written by Don Costa a few years after he produced and arranged Frank Sinatra's rendition of ""My Way"".) But this collection's personality doesn't just come through the motley collection of musical backgrounds and career arcs represented in the personnel, and the songs on Can You Dig It? run a gamut of moods and themes even broader than the movies that spawned them. The aforementioned social-conscience numbers stand out; ""Freddie's Dead"" and ""Across 110th Street"" in particular are peerless when it comes to fusing cool, resilient poise and deep, desperate sorrow. And there are a few choice examples of the other big musical trope to come out of the genre-- the wave of ""introducing the badass"" title themes that followed in the wake of ""Shaft"", flashy character sketches of a new epoch of black power-meets-action hero icons. To give you an idea of how varied these could be, check out the themes for two different Pam Grier vehicles: Ayers' ""Coffy Is the Color"" uses the protagonist's name as a jumping-off point to riff off an abstract awareness of blackness as strength (""Coffy is the color of your skin/ Coffy is the world you live in... Coffy is feelin' something deep, yeah""), while Hutch's ""Theme of Foxy Brown"" falls somewhere between a declaration of the heroine's tough-woman nature and a straight-up mash note (""Oh girl you're cute and you're sweet/ No, but you don't play around""). Still, it should be noted that well over half of the tracks on this collection don't have any lyrics at all, and it's in these instrumental selections that the notions of pimp chic, ghetto struggle, and outsized bad-motherfucker caricature recede into something more nuanced and transformative. The wah-wah pedals, conga drums, and sucker-punch horn stabs of the genre are omnipresent, but with such a glut of films to be scored in such a short period of time, musicians had to constantly outdo themselves and find outlandish ways to be creative. That's how you get Dennis Coffey and Luchi De Jesus overlaying a bizarre, almost kazoo-esque scat-singing chorus over the theme from Black Belt Jones and Marvin Gaye pushing the envelope for 1972's Trouble Man by taking a Moog out of the turf of sci-fi films and A Clockwork Orange to create the bassline for ""'T' Plays It Cool"". Selections by Ayers (""Aragon""), Quincy Jones (""They Call Me MISTER Tibbs""), and the Blackbyrds (""Wilford's Gone"") parallel the developments in jazz-funk's rich crossover period. And uptempo selections like Hayes' tense but funky ""Run Fay Run"" and ""Pursuit of the Pimpmobile"", J.J. Johnson's Latin jazz-tinged ""Willie Chase"", and Grant Green's all-percussion monster ""Traveling to Get to Doc"" aren't just music to stage car chases by, they're also dancefloor-ready classics that fit neatly into the early, pre-boom phase of disco. Speaking of which, by an odd twist of fate the tone of black cinema mostly shifted from a focus on gunslinging action flicks to comedies and musicals around the same time disco started supplanting soul on the charts, and by 1978-- the same year The Wiz bombed hard enough to scare Hollywood away from big-budget films aimed towards black audiences-- the standard for R&B-star Oscar winners had shifted from Isaac Hayes to Donna Summer. It's a mixed blessing: As the exhaustive, bigger-than-the-CD-case liner-notes book observes, there's a current generation of black directors and actors that have expanded roles far beyond the pimps, dealers, and private eyes of the 70s, but the veterans of that original, hard-fought renaissance period eventually wound up disappearing from both sides of the camera. And yet the music survives as strong as ever, renewed through the lens of the hip-hop generation that grew up with and reinterpreted it. When Spike Lee revisited the early 70s of his childhood for Crooklyn, ""Pusherman"" resurfaced not as the backdrop for a cocaine kingpin's internal struggles, but the accompaniment for a couple of siblings fighting over a box of Trix and the appearance of a couple of neighborhood glue-sniffers floating through Bed-Stuy upside-down. It worked there, too.","The Soul Jazz label offers an excellent 2xCD compilation of early-70s soul and funk from films.

Glitter and Doom Live,Tom Waits,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a75513d19756521393b9/1:1/w_160/e2f581fa.jpg,2009-11-23 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13725-glitter-and-doom-live/,Anti-,"It's hard to think of gruff Tom Waits getting his start as an earnest, albeit eccentric singer-songwriter in the 1970s. Almost immediately after releasing his debut, Closing Time, in 1973, Waits began shaking up his act and developing the oddball facets of his current persona: the hipster Beat delivery, the fascination with prowlers of back alleys and underbellies, the appreciation for jazz and blues and other American idioms, and the unmistakable voice that has grown stranger and more thunderous with each album. By the 1980s, the transformation was complete, although albums like swordfishtrombones and Rain Dogs were gambits, alienating as many fans as they attracted. In the 2000s and likely in the 2010s, few of his peers have proven so durable, so unique, so successful. His music no longer begins and ends with an acoustic guitar and a piano, but his foundational commitment to these instruments has kept his musical excursions anchored to a songcraft that favors strict structures and bold melodies. Critically speaking, Waits-- aided and abetted by wife and musical partner, Kathleen Brennan-- is a tinkerer, assembling musical contraptions out of various styles and traditions and synthesizing blues, rock, jazz, schmaltz balladry, and even hip-hop into a truly idiosyncratic art. But I seriously doubt anyone bought tickets for his Glitter and Doom Tour last year because of his relationship to American blues. Instead, they went to see Waits the showman's showman, who regales them with tall tales of hopeless city dwellers and heartbroken hucksters with a campfire intimacy that makes these otherworldly denizens feel very real. He comes across as a scourge of the past, an affront to the modern world of blogs, bailouts, and reality TV. His reluctance to tour regularly made Glitter and Doom one of the most coveted tickets of 2008. For those (of us) who missed it, we have Glitter and Doom Live, an album that reconstructs a typical evening with Waits (even though the tracks were recorded at different stops along the tour). While his nightly set lists generally covered every phase of his career, going back as far as ""Christmas Card from a Hooker in Minneapolis"" from 1978's Blue Valentine, this live album culls primarily from his 90s and 00s output, including several tracks rescued on 2006's Orphans. There are few nods to the 1970s and 80s, as if he's trying to avoid any overlap with his previous live album, 1988's Big Time. Glitter and Doom Live is not simply a souvenir of a tour most fans didn't attend but a de facto greatest hits of Waits' fourth decade of music, during which his gnarly adventurousness didn't wane but only intensified. Waits leads a small but versatile band that makes these songs swing, playing up the tension without overwhelming his melodies. Omar Torrez's guitar snakes around Waits' vocals sinisterly, punctuating ""Goin' Out West"" with spiky notes. Horns flare in the crosswinds of ""Metropolitan Glide"", as if alluding to all the early 20th century artists, poets, and musicians who tried to capture the hectic rhythms of the cities with equally hectic jabs of paint, word, and noise. The percussion is crucial here, whether Waits is breathing beats into the mic or his son Casey is pounding out railroad rhythms on ""Get Behind the Mule"". Opener ""Lucinda/Ain't Goin' Down"" sounds better here than it did on Orphans, losing its beatbox backing track for a lurching ranginess that suits Waits' delivery. Likewise, ""Such a Scream"" and ""Goin' Out West"" possess a new aggression as Waits unleashes a series of dime-novel machismo boasts: ""I don't lose my composure in a high-speed chase,"" he grunts. ""My friends say I'm ugly, but I got a masculine face."" Waits flirts with self-parody on ""Circus"" and ""I'll Shoot the Moon"", but he's been doing that for years. ""Circus"", from 2004's Real Gone, is a rambling tale of carnival characters, and ""Moon"" is a loose, loungey crooner with minimal accompaniment-- two sides of the same Waits. On the latter, he commandeers the bridge to hit on a barfly, rattling off a fake phone number: Is it unintentional schtick or simply part of the character Waits is playing in the song? He can get sentimental and even maudlin on ""Fannin Street"" and ""The Part You Throw Away"", but he's never sappy. Closer ""Lucky Day"" (like ""Moon"", from 1993's The Black Rider) ends the albums on a note that's both dreamily optimistic and earthbound by the vagaries of his voice. That's the essential contradiction of late-career Waits: He is both an incorrigible dreamer and an inveterate realist. He's also a darn good storyteller. Right before launching into ""Lucky Day"", he holds forth on the subject of eBay, namely bidding on the dying breath of Henry Ford. It's a typical Waits yarn, drawn out with unbelievable details dug up from America's weird past, and the audience reacts with guffaws and applause. What's atypical about this story, however, is that it's the only one included on Glitter and Doom Live. The rest have been compiled on a companion disc titled ""Tom Tales"", which consists of one 35-minute track of Waits expounding on a variety of subjects (Nazi alphabet soup, uncharitable shrimp) at a variety of venues. He's funny, of course, rattling off arcane factoids and admonishing a rowdy audience to get organized with their requests. While it's better to have these stories than not, their inclusion feels like an afterthought, a tacit admission that they might have been better mixed in among the songs to give a better sense of what an evening with Waits is really like. That's only a minor complaint, as their presence here-- even excised from their original context-- nicely supplements a particularly lively live album that is also a persuasive retrospective of Waits' last 20 years.","This live record is a de facto greatest hits of Tom Waits' fourth decade of music, during which his gnarly adventurousness only intensified.

Carpet Madness,Get Back Guinozzi!,by: Rebecca Raber,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a742ea9e61561daa5545/1:1/w_160/390dcc8c.jpg,2009-11-20 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13706-carpet-madness/,Fat Cat,"The debut album by Gallic pop-dub-electro hybrid Get Back Guinozzi! follows in an increasingly long list of records made via pen-pal collaboration. But unlike the most famous example of this phenomenon-- the Postal Service's Give Up-- the story of Carpet Madness' creation (short version: London-based French singer Eglantine Gouzy and South of France resident and instrumentalist Fred Landini exchanged tracks across the English channel via the Internet) is inaudible in its execution. These songs, delivered chirpily in Gouzy's charmingly butchered English, don't sound like the product of loneliness, estrangement, or longing, and in fact, the experimental brio of their creators makes them seem like the casually tossed off results of hours spent goofing off together in the studio-- even if the duo was separated by more than 600 miles the whole time. Get Back Guinozzi!'s quirky aesthetic mines the coquettish 1960s pop vibe of yé-yé, the hollow drum machine precision and melodic bass throb of UK post-punk and dub, and the syncopated rhythms of reggae, and tropicalia to create a deliberately lo-fi result that fuses the homegrown and the exotic. But despite such worldly appearances, there is a deliberate naivety to the songs on Carpet Madness. ""Go Back to School"" is marked by overdubbed vocals that sound like a children's choir, before girlish giggling punctuates its final minute. Their standout cover of Junior Murvin's ""Police and Thieves"" is sung in such a sweetly effervescent coo that it makes you wonder if Gouzy understands that the English-language lyrics are about police brutality. And ""I Don't Want to Sleep Alone"" is a ballad in a sea of uptempo tracks that opens with an unusually vulnerable vocal and a repetitive, twinkly guitar riff. Though there is something to like about each of the giddily scattershot tracks on the album, they have a tendency to meander, either eschewing a conventional chorus and/or hook or developing one only to repeat it ad nauseum. But since Get Back Guinozzi! have no regard for genre conventions, restraint, or indie rock's self-seriousness, they are easily forgiven for such kookiness. After all, there is something delightfully gluttonous about them; they want to pursue every impulse they have and squeeze as many influences as possible into a barely three-minute pop song. And throughout it all, Gouzy sings like a Gallic crossbreed of Yoko Ono and Björk-- she is a mess of shrieky ululations and mush-mouthed pronunciation. Though that probably sounds like it would be annoying (and honestly, it can be at times), it is mostly fascinating, adding another layer of drama to tracks that are already bursting at their home-sewn seams with theatricality. Carpet Madness sounds like it was well served by the long-distance that created it. It has an audible try-anything-once spirit that is clearly a result of two friends trying to amuse each other from across La Manche without fear of reproach for being too weird. And as a fantastical, playful collection with many stamps on its musical passport, Carpet Madness is all the better for letting its freak flag fly.","Gallic/English duo mines the coquettish 1960s pop vibe of yé-yé, the precision and throb of UK post-punk, and the syncopation of reggae and tropicalia.

Hot Wax,Grant Hart,by: Joshua Klein,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6abea9e61561daa53fa/1:1/w_160/09d13286.jpg,2009-11-20 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13586-hot-wax/,Con D'or,"Hüsker Dü broke up more than 20 years ago, but in some ways it feels like the dust never completely settled. In fact, Bob Mould and Grant Hart went their separate ways with such force that, if anything, nearly as much dust has been kicked up in the band's wake than even a group as volcanic and vital as Hüsker Dü managed to produce during its alt-landscape-shaping lifespan. In interviews over the years, both Mould and Hart have revealed a lingering bitterness over the breakup and its aftermath, with only bassist Greg Norton apparently able to totally leave the past behind. If Norton got off easy it's likely because he got out, pursuing a career as a chef. Mould, on the other hand, has released nine solo albums and a couple with Sugar, each earning comparisons (for better or for worse) to his Hüsker Dü work. Hart, always the poppier and more rousing half of the Hüsker Dü equation, has been significantly less prolific. He was first out of the gate with a solo album, 1989's raw Intolerance, but after the failed band experiment Nova Mob, he didn't release another solo album until 1999's equally great but sadly overlooked Good News for Modern Man, a DIY affair that found Hart's voice and songwriting in top form. Another decade has passed, and at last Hart has returned with a third solo album, Hot Wax, which he recorded off and on over the past few years in both Montreal and his hometown of Minneapolis, with members of Godspeed You! Black Emperor and Silver Mt. Zion assisting. The pedigree of the collaborators has changed Hart's musical outlook: Hot Wax is no slab of apocalyptic post-rock; rather, it's 1960s-infused garage pop clearly from the same soul that wrote all those era-defining Hüsker Dü classics. Unfortunately, Hot Wax isn't nearly on par with Hart's Hüsker highs, let alone his two previous solo albums. While all the parts are in place, the results are oddly unfocused, too unpolished to do Hart's songs justice but too hooky and promising to stop you from to considering what could have been. In an ideal world, songs such as ""You're the Reflection of the Moon on the Water"", ""Charles Hollis Jones"", or ""California Zephyr"" would be blasting out of passing cars with all the primal zest of the best garage rock revivalists. Here, however, they come off relatively neutered by lo-fi fuzz, muffled and restrained where they should be exploding. We do get a couple of stylistic excursions in the form of the British Invasion throwbacks ""Barbara"" and ""I Knew All About You Since Then"", each of which displays a firm grasp of the Kinks' theatrically foppish tendencies. At the same time, the power-ballads ""Schoolbuses Are for Children"" and ""My Regrets""-- power ballads once being one of Hart's greatest strengths-- falter where likeminded anthems like ""A Letter From Anne Marie"" (from Good News) soared, and the rollicking rocker ""Sailor Jack"" never takes off the way ebullient frat rock templates like, say, ""Hang On, Sloopy"" do. It'd be one thing if Hart's records graced shelves (virtual or no) more often. But 10 years is a long time to wait for a writer of Hart's stature, and the fact that Hot Wax delivers such uneven goods is, let's face it, a bit of a bummer. Hart can do-- and Hart fans deserve-- better. The only silver lining is the fact that the record exists at all, since by ending his silence Hart implicitly suggests there may be more to come. At least, one can hope.","A decade after his sadly overlooked Good News for Modern Man, the former Hüsker Dü member finally issues his third solo record.

Up to Now,Snow Patrol,by: Tom Breihan,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a7309d034d5c69bf3727/1:1/w_160/8bde9771.jpg,2009-11-20 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13693-up-to-now/,Interscope,"Here's a depressing exercise: Sit down and try to figure out how many of the bigger alt-rock bands that emerged this past decade will one day crank out a half-decent greatest-hits album. It's a short list. The White Stripes will release a great one. So will Coldplay, the Yeah Yeah Yeahs, and the Killers. Franz Ferdinand and Bloc Party have a chance, and Tegan and Sara could get there, too. And... that's pretty much it. Many of the great alt-rock artists of this decade were also the great alt-rock artists of the decade before-- Radiohead, Beck, Björk, the Flaming Lips, etc. With radio going directly into the shitter, most good rock bands haven't had a chance to make anything that could, even charitably, be regarded as a hit. Sorry, Animal Collective. The whole function of a greatest-hits album-- to rescue transcendent pop singles from shitty or just-OK albums-- doesn't even make sense when transcendent, monocultural pop is something that barely even exists anymore. Given a few more OK albums, widescreen MOR archdukes Snow Patrol might've snuck their way into the above paragraph. Snow Patrol have always come across like a more workmanlike Coldplay. Same celestial choruses, same overwhelming sense of longing, same epic U2-derived comfort-food melodies. But with Snow Patrol, you never get the idea that they're out to save the world or get their faces plastered up 80 feet high in Times Square. Even their biggest, most heartstring-yanking tunes (""Chasing Cars"", ""Run"") concern simple and relatable experiences: falling in love and shutting the whole world out, or falling out of love and feeling your whole world crumble. They're good at what they do, and they've quietly built up a deeply solid and satisfying run of singles. It shouldn't be a problem for these guys to slap together 12 of their biggest and call it a day. That's not what they do on Up to Now. Instead, the band has to throw every goddamn thing at the wall: singles, sure, but also B-sides and unreleased tracks and covers and side-project joints and live tracks. If you just want to hear the hits, you're not going to need a set of random tracks from the Reindeer Section, the Scottish indie supergroup that Snow Patrol frontman Gary Lightbody also leads in his spare time. And if you're such a die-hard Snow Patrol completist that you need all their shitty B-sides, you're... well, I don't know what the hell your deal is, but you probably don't need to own ""Chasing Cars"" again. The result: two deeply overstuffed CDs with a few great moments but just as many songs that nobody will ever need to hear a second time. The worst excess on the whole set is the band's half-joking ""Crazy in Love"" cover, which-- unlike, say, Antony's version-- does not excise the Jay-Z verse. Instead, someone from the band has to fuck around with one of those awful joke-rap voices. Jay-Z's cultural references must not have quite the same currency in Britain, since whoever takes the verse gets a few things blatantly, hilariously wrong; ""Handle like Van Exel"" becomes ""candle like benex soup"" or something. But even without the verse, it's the limpest, most unfunny MOR Brit-rock joke-cover since Travis did ""Baby One More Time"". Nearly as bad is the ""Run"" B-side ""Post-Punk Progression"", on which Lightbody flattens his voice into an imitation Ian Curtis mutter and repeats the same line again and again over a fake Joy Division crawl: ""You won't be around forever, girl; you gotta grab life with both hands."" Is the song a joke? I have no idea. I just know it has no place on what could've been a pretty great greatest-hits album. The biggest problem, though, isn't the outright clunkers; it's the sheer length of the thing. Snow Patrol's basic sweep isn't the type of thing that holds up over two hours, and after the 20th straight-faced lovelorn hymn, you'll start climbing the walls. A crisp, chronologically sequenced set could've been a whole lot of fun-- we could've heard them evolve from the light Stereolab and Imperial Teen influences of their early days on Jeepster to the blandly expert arena jams they'd learn to crank out. But Up to Now just piles everything together and dares you to delete the extraneous stuff from your iTunes.","The Coldplay acolytes release a deeply overstuffed 2xCD best-of when a crisp singles collection could have done.

Live in New York,The Doors,by: Chris Dahlen,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a75113d19756521393b0/1:1/w_160/7d1142de.jpg,2009-11-20 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13721-live-in-new-york/,Rhino,"So I'm 13, and I'm slouching through Harvard Square on my way to get Pink Floyd boots at the used record store. I'm just starting to grow my hair long-- which never really worked out-- and I'm wearing a grey t-shirt sporting the hundred-yard-stare of Jim Morrison of the Doors. From across the street, a guy three times my age shouts: ""Fuck! Yeah! The Doors!"" And for that moment, we are brothers. *The Kids in the Hall'*s Bruce McCulloch argued that Doors fans are born, not made. But he ducks the question of why we're not making them anymore. Today, one of the first standard-bearers of rock is less hip than Journey. Let's review the case against the band: First we have Morrison himself, who's been blown into a caricature by his super-sexual persona, his wifty poetry, and his early death in a Paris bathtub. The music sounds like a weird cross between shit-kicking blues-rock and brain-spraining acid-jams, and it's easier to get your avant-garage fix from the Velvet Underground, your rock shaman verse from Patti Smith (or not at all), or your psychedelic extravagance from countless Nuggets bands. As dead 1960s rockers go, Jimi's legacy has left Janis and Jim in the dust. It may be a strange way to put it, but the problem with the Doors is that they were not efficient. Let's say that's where you are with this band. So here's how this set might change your mind. Rhino has reissued all four sets from their gig at the Felt Forum in January 1970, right before the release of Morrison Hotel-- and still in the shadow of Morrison's drunken, obnoxious, and allegedly obscene performance in Miami, which threatened him with jail time. Many tracks from these shows have been released before, but on this box you can listen to them bootleg-style, with all the repeated songs, tuning breaks, and banter with the audience. The Live in New York set sounds like an unedited performance, but in fact, the tapes had been so worked-over for other live albums that the team had to meticulously reconstruct it from 8-track and 2-track source tapes, using fan tapes as reference. Guest John Sebastian's harmonica wasn't even captured in the original mix; producer Bruce Botnick brought him back to the studio this year to replay the solos, based on what they got from tape bleed. Why go to the trouble? Because this is the truth. It's what the Doors sounded like, without the heavy hand of an Oliver Stone looking for the juicy parts-- and without the impatience of the iPod generation trying to trim it down. As you listen to the set, Morrison doesn't come off as a self-absorbed mystic: He's far more like the troubled kid in school who couldn't sit still and didn't fear anything. He demands and rewards attention. He's petulant with the audience, even barking at them or pleading to ""give the singer some"" when they won't stop talking. The vibe from the crowd may explain why the fourth show starts rough: After scolding the crowd, Morrison sounds disengaged or mocking as he wanders through the first few songs. But then he suddenly rewards the audience with a rare performance of his rock suite/poetry slam, ""Celebration of the Lizard"". The piece isn't exactly a lost classic-- it's not his most powerful verse, and musically it doesn't gel like ""The End""-- but the best thing about this recording is how into it Morrison gets, from the quiet couplets to the screams. It's easy to see how people fell in love with the poet no matter the poetry, although some of his verse is still dangerous: The ""Horse Latitudes"" poem that he interjects in ""Moonlight Drive"" boasts his strongest imagery, and the contrast between that and the seaside groove is still striking. The rest of the band is here to support the star, and it never lets him down: The Doors were a loose, groovy, and ferocious combo, here playing a setlist that sticks to rock and blues and skips all the winsome and folky stuff that cluttered up Waiting for the Sun and The Soft Parade. Organist Ray Manzarek played the hooks that turned songs like ""Hello, I Love You"" into pop hits, but here he's focused on driving the rhythm section. Even his legendary solo on ""Light My Fire"" changes in concert from a melodic improvisation to a jam that climaxes in frustration, as you can hear him stabbing the keys with all ten fingers and wishing he had another ten besides. On the other hand, guitarist Robby Krieger is ferocious right from the riff of ""Roadhouse Blues"", and he makes their cover of Bo Diddley's ""Who Do You Love"" one of the best recordings the Doors ever made. History hates this band for its excess, but so what? The Doors thrived on excess. When Morrison gears up the crowd with his groin and his ego and roars, ""gonna have a re-al, good time,"" no excess, no overdose, no scream is big enough for the good time he's got in mind. And that's the way to remember him.","The much-maligned band makes a case for itself on this sprawling 6xCD collection, recorded just before the release of Morrison Hotel.

2002-2010,RJD2,by: Nate Patrin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6e0ea9e61561daa5476/1:1/w_160/0785a19a.jpg,2009-11-20 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13631-2002-2010/,RJ's Electrical Connections,"Is RJD2 slept on? I've wondered that occasionally ever since I listened to 2007's odd pop-soul detour The Third Hand and wound up feeling disappointed at its almost defiant shift away from the production style that put him on the mainstream radar seven years ago. His buzz was still strong as of early 2006, when he helmed the beats on solid albums by Soul Position and Aceyalone that dropped in consecutive months. But it seems in the ensuing years that the only prominent reminder people still have of the often-melancholy but heavy-hitting style which once made him an heir apparent to the prog-cratedigger genius of DJ Shadow and Dan the Automator is the 37 seconds of ""A Beautiful Mine"" that accompanies Don Draper's animated freefall in the opening credits of ""Mad Men"". So now that RJ has his own label and the rights to put his first three Definitive Jux releases out on it, he's created a good excuse to revisit his earlier catalogue in the form of a misleadingly-titled collectors-quality vinyl box set. The titular timeline notwithstanding, 2002-2010 as it's packaged sticks significantly to the first few years of his breakthrough success, starting with 2002's Deadringer and encompassing its 2004 follow-up, Since We Last Spoke, and a couple of EPs (2003's The Horror and the unreleased-material collection Tin Foil Hat). So if you want a crash course in what made RJ Krohn one of the most exciting new hip-hop producer-auteurs of the decade's first half, you've got a good headstart in here. Deadringer was the crucial first impression that many fans and critics intially judged RJD2 by, and that impression still lingers. After honing his skills with Columbus' MHz crew in the late 90s, RJ broke out big time as a production auteur with his solo debut, and already you can hear how versatile he could be. Opener ""The Horror"" is still completely, wonderfully ridiculous-- threatening and absurd at the same time, cartoon haunted house music that actually bumps harder than most early-00s indie rap. And that sense of semi-gothic hip-hop eeriness carries on through a number of different guises-- mournful soul-blues (""Smoke & Mirrors""), break-chopping John Bonhamisms (""Chicken-Bone Circuit""), glowing psych-funk drone (""The Proxy""), mocking baroque choruses (""F.H.H."", featuring anti-backpacker broadsides from sneering MHz vet Jakki da Motamouth) and, most memorably, Copywrite's anguished message to his late father on the folk-jazz requiem ""June"". That album's lasting impact ensured that at least some people might be thrown off a bit by Since We Last Spoke-- it's put together with much of the same cratedigger eclecticism and airtight drum programming as Deadringer, but in the service of a work that feels more like an attempt to build a rock- and new wave-influenced funk album out of samples. RJ went completely batshit crazy on this one: The opening title track turns the Stooges' ""Gimme Danger"" aesthetic inside-out and garnishes it with nicotine-stained synthesizers, ""Iced Lightning"" is arena-prog for fog-and-laser b-boy battles, ""Exotic Talk"" rides on a beat that sounds like Keith Moon/Tony Williams conjoined twins going at a 90-piece drum kit, and ""Through the Walls"" resembles a peak-period Cars track so much he actually got Ric Ocasek himself to sing on the remix. But the soulful sorrow that made Deadringer stand out still comes through in the more subdued moments-- ""Clean Living"" cops Sly Stone vibes off a late-70s funk rarity featuring a young L.A. Reid on drums, and closer ""One Day"" is heartbroken, late-night cocktail R&B of the finest caliber-- making Spoke the equivalent of an unusually good alternate-universe free-form radio station circa 1978. The other two pieces of the box aren't quite as essential, though people who already own the two full-lengths might want to keep them (and the really sharp screenprinted poster) in mind when considering this purchase. The Horror EP doesn't include much that's worth going out of your way for, though it's nice to have instrumental versions of Deadringer tracks ""Final Frontier"" and ""F.H.H."" and there's a song, ""Sell the World"", that does one hell of a number on Randy Newman's ""Last Night I Had a Dream"" with some phantasmagorical Brides of Funkenstein vocals. The Tin Foil Hat EP is the completist's draw, featuring seven mostly-good tracks left, it seems inexplicably, on the cutting-room floor; the nine-plus-minute suite ""Thine Planetarium"" and the ""Takeover""-gone-uptown strut of ""The Move"" (featuring underrated, since-vanished MHz member Tage Proto) are the most desirable of the bunch. 2002-2010 isn't entirely inaccurate as a title, since the box itself is large enough to accommodate your vinyl copies of The Third Hand and, presumably, next year's The Colossus if you want. (Or the lost-classic In Rare Form: Unreleased Instrumentals, for that matter.) But as it stands on its own, this slice of RJD2's 2002-2004 is a necessary reminder that, as hip-hop producers of this decade go, he still deserves consideration for top 10 status. And for that short window of time-- assuming the material on Tin Foil Hat doesn't fall too far outside that chronological window-- the scope and quality of the music here should be seen as nothing less than impressive. Here's hoping his next decade starts off as hot as this one did.","This lavish vinyl-only boxset includes full albums like Deadringer and Since We Last Spoke along with some impressive unreleased material.

Blackout Summer,Christmas Island,by: Zach Kelly,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a7335e6ef95969320f05/1:1/w_160/ef77ed30.jpg,2009-11-19 06:00:04,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13697-blackout-summer/,In the Red,"""Does it ever weird you out that I want to be with you, every minute of every hour and every day, too?"" the unnamed, unauthorized focal character at the center of Christmas Island's debut, Blackout Summer, asks on ""Weird You Out"", the album's best and most defining cut. Honestly? Yes, you totally weird us out, dude. Unlike with most of the neurotic arrested development cases you come across in popular culture-- your Woody Allens, anyone who has Judd Apatow in their ""five""-- this sadsack figure possesses literally no sense of self-deprecating humor, is constantly waxing pathetic, and yet is somehow no less endearing and sympathetic for it. Now whether these songs document the real-life romantic pinings of frontman Brian Island or are simply a batch of shaggy jams ripped from the lovesick diary of a 15-year-old beach punk, there's an underlying story arc that saves Blackout Summer from being just another collection of ramshackle bummer strummers. Part of the burgeoning San Diego lo-fi scene that's home to seedy droners like Crocodiles and garage revivalists like the Soft Pack, three-pieced Christmas Island are the most obvious candidate for a middle-ground house band of the movement, their amateurish ambling rendered more charming with every heartbroken admission, typically undercut by a radiant guitar lick or a breezy little groove. It's this same sort of dichotomy that characterizes most of Blackout Summer: The sunniest numbers are usually about rejection, depression, or the inevitability of rejection and depression (the cheery ""Doin' Swell"" boasts the lyric, ""He hung his head and cried, he hung his head and died"") and the flatter, murkier numbers are usually the hard-line love song laments (""I Don't Care"", a flip of the Ramones' song of the same name, is actually a lap-dog fantasy-- ""I don't care what you wanna do... I will do anything with you""). The band itself was actually formed after Island and now-drummer Lucy Wehryl started dating, which is kind of surprising, seeing as most of the songs here sound like the hopeless brooding of a frustrated virgin-- if that shit flew with most girls, 80% of existing pop songs would vanish instantaneously. And even while the music itself might be too categorical or flat (the band never dares delineate from their brand of frayed, play-it-loose garage-pop), a curious and compelling little study in teenage misanthropy emerges, nicely defining a complex hormonal state and the dunderheaded frustration that accompanies. Take ""Dinosaurs"", by all accounts a mercilessly dumb goof that proudly features lines like, ""I can't believe you ever existed, I'm really bummed out that I missed it."" But with Island's slouch-shouldered delivery of lines like, ""I wish I could take a time machine, to a time before human beings,"" the song transforms into a simple confession of feeling out of place. It's especially apparent when wedged snugly up against ""It's True"", a less-nerdy version of ""Dinosaurs"" that's such a truly unbecoming song, so full of self-pity and doubt (""I don't know what the hell I'm doing, I'm no good at being human"") that it's hard not to see the two sides of the typical adolescent experience coexist: one shrouded in pimpled vices, the other embarrassingly earnest. This eventually brings us to ""Weird You Out"", an unsettling climax that's as sadsack as it is nutjob, a hopeless final plea that hinges on the very creepy promise, ""I'll see you at 10."" Played as both a timid first-date confirmation and a chilly threat at the same time, it affords some much needed contextual support for Blackout Summer; you won't remember the chorus, but hopefully you remember feeling sorry for someone, maybe even yourself. If any of this is deliberate, it works extremely well, though obviously not subtly. Ronettes-influenced slow burner ""My Baby"" closes things out, as girl-leaves-boy (or disputes existence of boy) and fuck-everything thoughts like, ""It's like you're nonexistent"" permeate the air, confirming what everyone but our protagonist saw coming. It's a neat little package, even if the music itself is so stubbornly unvaried. However, if over time Blackout Summer proves to be little more than a themeless accumulation of lonely complaints, we've got a serious problem. For now, we'll be gracious and wait for a second album before making plans to wash our hair the next time Christmas Island comes calling.","Part of the burgeoning San Diego lo-fi scene that's home to Crocodiles and the Soft Pack, Christmas Island make shaggy, sadsack hymns to heartbreak.

Local Currency: Solo 1992-1998,Franklin Bruno,by: David Raposa,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6ebb1335d7bf1698f33/1:1/w_160/3040583e.jpg,2009-11-19 06:00:03,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13639-local-currency-solo-1992-1998/,Fayettenam,"Usually the liner notes to a compilation of hard-to-find or out-of-print material from an obscure musician includes an essay that makes (or overstates) a case for the artist's worthiness. In the case of Local Currency, a collection of vinyl releases and compilation appearances made in the mid-to-late 1990s by Franklin Bruno, the honor is given to award-winning poet and The Nation. columnist Ange Mlinko. In addition to offering many kind words in Bruno's behalf, Mlinko compares his brand of musical erudition (specifically his lyrics) with the ouevres proffered by a rather daunting Mount Rushmore: Elvis Costello, Morrissey, Jonathan Richman, and Bob Dylan. Impressive company, to be sure, even if it's company that one would be hard pressed to weigh any songwriter against. For those a little suspect of such lofty praise, you're not alone: The liner notes also include some words from Bruno himself, a self-administered roast to Mlinko's well-meaning toast. Going through this album track by track, he leads listeners down this decade-old memory lane, never hesitating to point out the overgrown lawns and dilapidated storefronts that dot the landscape. Of course, an artist is often his fiercest critic, especially when it comes to their earlier works, as this description of one of Local Currency's few low points (""Soggy Girl"") demonstrates: ""Imitate Calvin Johnson over a borrowed Public Enemy cassette and gratuitous key changes? Sign me up."" Bruno also makes unflattering mention of his penchant for arcane references (cf. the shout-out to ""goddamn"" Joseph Cornell on ""In a Sourceless Light""), his less-than-robust singing voice, his more-than-robust vocabulary, and even, as he describes it, ""my disinclination to distinguish between 'pop' and 'experimental,' thus resulting in releases no one could enjoy straight through."" And while there are a small handful of examples on Local Currency where Bruno's impeccable melodic instincts clash less favorably with his more experimental impulses-- the mish-mash of feedback, lo-fi tape-splice chicanery, and all-but-spoken-word meandering on ""About You I'd Ask"" come to mind-- it's those potentially questionable digressions that inform and strengthen his more traditional verse-chorus work. As growing-pain portraits go, Local Currency is the sort of warts-and-all release that most songwriters would love to call their own. In many ways, this compilation serves as a microcosm of Bruno's musical growth, running the gamut from his days fronting the power-poptastic Nothing Painted Blue (with ""Wholly Heavy Heart"" sounding just like a lost 0PB cut) to his modern-day dalliances with more traditional forms of songwriting (exhibited by the solo-piano Tin-Pan-Alleyisms of ""News From Cupid""). In between these poles, Bruno offers some of the more thoughtful songs, love and otherwise, that the Amerindie underground had to offer. Bruno himself politely mocks this practice in one of the tunes here-- ""The 101st"", with the number in the title referring to the number of songs the narrator has written (or is about to write) about a certain special someone. But there's not much to mock if the songs in question are as heartbreaking as ""Keeping the Weekend Free"", or as despairing as ""Pointless Triangle"". Both these tunes were given flattering higher-fidelity interpretations by former Tsunami bandleader/Simple Machines labelhead Jenny Toomey-- the former on Liquorice's Listening Cap; the latter on Toomey's Bruno-abetted Tempting-- and while those versions might be prettier and shinier, there's something to be said for hearing these sentiments and songs in the writer's original voice. What could get lost while admiring Bruno's lyrical knack is that his way with a tune, and his knack for getting form and fucntion to work together, is equally impressive. ""In a Sourceless Light"" finds Bruno playfully prodding someone who'd look better in the titular light-- ""if your shadow didn't follow you around""-- with a chiming Rickenbacker echoing his spry wit, while ""Shooting Past Me"" is an embittered and eloquent kiss-off whose starkness feeds into the song's autumnal pallor. Bruno also manages to pull off a ""pop""/""experimental"" coup of sorts with ""Medium of Exchange"", melding one of his sweeter melodies and seemingly sweeter lyrics (""If I could wave a magic wand/ I would cross every lily pond"") to a Frankensteinian backing track that's anything but sweet. Even when he tackles subjects less fraught with pathos, like his own medical misfortunes on the whimsical ""Cat-Scratch Fever"", there's no lacking for musical or lyrical cleverness-- it's rare for a track here not to offer the listener something worth holding onto. In the decade-plus since the newest tune on this compilation was originally released, Franklin Bruno's songwriting has grown immeasurably, exchanging the more pronounced flourishes of skill and smarts with more subtle, yet no less effective, shows of intellectual force-- it's evident on Bruno's last solo album (A Cat May Look at a Queen), and on Civics, the first album from his new band, the Human Hearts. Some that are fond of the songs from Bruno's salad days might see this newer work as a step back from what's on display in Local Currency, while others are more in tune with where Bruno's muse is currently leading him. But regardless of where fans stand, it's safe to say that Bruno himself won't ever be complacent with what he's done-- in regards to the final track on Local Currency, ""Dream Worth Dreaming"", the usually effusive Bruno has only two words: ""Still looking.""","Cult guitar pop veteran releases the sort of warts-and-all release that most songwriters would love to call their own.

Street Anthems,Roll Deep,by: Martin Clark,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6fd13d19756521392ea/1:1/w_160/1ac5b6f2.jpg,2009-11-19 06:00:02,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13655-street-anthems/,Roll Deep,"In the relentlessly forward-moving world of UK grime, retrospective compilations are rare. Many of grime's primary mediums are transient: pirate radio sets, rave clashes, or street DVD slews. So it's difficult to sum up even the best grime artists on recorded output alone. Roll Deep's Street Anthems compilation comes close to doing so, however. It helps that Roll Deep are heavyweights, the equivalent of the Murderer's Row of baseball's New York Yankees or galacticos of soccer's Real Madrid. Among the stars that have passed through its ranks and repped on this compilation are Wiley-- who formed Roll Deep from the ashes of another great grime collective, Pay As U Go, and helped usher the genre from rap-infused UK garage to what it is today-- the chart-topping Dizzee Rascal, supersub star Tinchy Stryder, yardcore MC Riko, Boy Betta Know's Skepta, dubstep fave Flowdan, and wordsmith Trim. Through their vision, experimentation, and aggression, much of grime's best moves were devised. In fact, when the crew falls it's when they try to play by other people's rules-- namely the pop industry's. You can understand the motivation behind such chartbait as ""Shake a Leg"", ""Avenue"", and ""Do Me Wrong""-- commercial gain, the chance to reach a wider audience, and a reverence for U.S. pop-- but those tracks pale in comparison to the output of their transatlantic cousins that inspired them. Like grime itself, when Roll Deep define their own terms they are strongest-- shockingly innovative and brutally uncompromising. Recent bangers, made before the crew's focus shifted to respective solo projects, hold their own. ""When I'm 'Ere"" lays fearsome bars from the crew over Danny Weed and Target production trademarks. ""Celebrate"" is the closest they come to credible pop, its riff hinting at their early Sinogrime productions. But it's when Street Anthems unearths the relatively lost classics that the importance of the compilation is apparent. Early grime anthems like ""Roll Deep Regular"" and ""Bounce"" were critical in the creation of a unique, shockingly original genre, different from the DJ-based, house-inspired UK garage scene it rose out of. Wiley's glacial ""eski"" synths sounded cold and alien. MCs laced these distant and strange beats them with acutely local bars-- lyrics dripping in East London slang and narratives. Yet early Roll Deep wasn't exclusively explosive and aggressive. ""U Were Always"", which features Wiley, Dizzee Rascal, and Ruff Sqwad's Tinchy Stryder, shows a gentler side to the sound, exchanging jungle and dancehall for R&B slowjams as an input variable in their mutant new algorhythm. Yet even amid this embarrassment of riches, Street Anthems has two glittering centrepieces. If there's one track that cemented grime as a unique proposition and propelled Roll Deep to an A-list crew, it's the instrumental of Wiley's ""Eskimo"". Even after nearly a half-dozen Wiley solo albums-- and twice as many affiliated mixtapes from the crew-- these vocal mixes remained lost until now. The original vocal is completely unheard and the fearsome remix was to be found only on the leaked Creeper Vol 2 mixtape. Their appearance here is long overdue, with Riko and Trim destroying the remix and Dizzee-- his voice young, angry, and raw-- spitting the kind of gunchat you wouldn't catch him dead doing these days. These days Dizzee rules the charts: Roll Deep not only run the roads, they paved them.","The grime crew that featured Dizzee Rascal, Wiley, and Flowdan gets a welcome retrospective that gathers their raw early work alongside stabs at pop.

"Do What You Want, Be What You Are: The Music of Daryl Hall and John Oates",Hall and Oates,by: Douglas Wolk,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a747ea9e61561daa554f/1:1/w_160/1090b55e.jpg,2009-11-19 06:00:01,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13716-do-what-you-want-be-what-you-are-the-music-of-daryl-hall-and-john-oates/,Legacy,"What, exactly, is wrong about Daryl Hall and John Oates? It's not a lack of talent-- they've got a stellar singer (and a pretty good one), and their songs are smart and durable. They're not particularly derivative, aside from their undying love for the Philadelphia soul scene that brought them together, and anyway it's not as if there are many pop artists with a fixation on that particular sound. Hall's a fascinating interview subject. But the pong of tackiness hovers around them, and this lovingly assembled, more-than-complete boxed set doesn't dispel it. The first disc begins with shruggable late-1960s singles by their individual teenage soul projects, the Temptones (Hall) and the Masters (Oates), then surveys the early albums on which Hall and Oates were a nearly hitless cult item (""She's Gone"" squeaked up to #60 on the pop charts on its initial release). It ends with five songs from a 1975 London concert, by which point they seem to have settled into being an agreeable, quirky soft-rock band with really nice harmonies and a taste for the smoother end of R&B. On the second disc, though, both their gifts for tune and arrangement and their peculiar lapses of taste start to assert themselves. The heavy, daisy-chained hooks of ""Gino (The Manager)"" are ahead of their time-- it wouldn't sound far out of place on an A.C. Newman album-- but it is, in fact, about their then-manager (Tommy Mottola!), and for this set, Hall has jarringly replaced the original recording's drums and remixed it. ""I Don't Wanna Lose You"" is an airy Philly disco pastiche with a great chorus, but Hall nearly sinks it with oversinging. Oates takes the lead for a totally unnecessary cover of ""You've Lost That Lovin' Feeling"". Perfectly nice grooves are defaced with curlicues of check-out-my-bulging-forehead-veins saxophone. Everything is bluntly in earnest. (Hall, in the liner notes, on ""Wait for Me"": ""It's a true story. I was feeling a certain way. I sat down and wrote the song and there it is."" Well, that settles that.) Their willingness to bend with the times worked out well for their career peak, the 1980-1985 period documented on Disc Three. Hall and Oates were never quite a new wave act, but new wave's insistence on formal economy and freshness of sound were just the tonic they needed: ""You Make My Dreams"" appropriates Devo's jerky rhythms in the service of yacht rock, and ""Private Eyes"" is essentially David Bowie's ""Fashion"" with all the archness stripped out of it. ""I Can't Go For That (No Can Do)"", their biggest hit, is everything they do best in one place: an ingeniously knotty melody, effortless starbursts of harmonies, Hall vamping freely, and an arrangement like nothing else on the radio. ""One on One"" builds a ballad around its percolating drum machine pretty much the same way. Then they discover the Mid-80s Massive Gated Snare Sound, fire off a few more good songs from within the chasm of the big bam boom, and wrap up their pre-separation career by trotting out David Ruffin and Eddie Kendrick for an embarrassing Temptations medley on a live-at-the-Apollo album-- the official jump of the shark. The fourth disc, documenting everything from 1988's way too optimistically titled reunion album Ooh Yeah! to the present, is one long comedown, chiefly because their songwriting mojo seems to have totally dried up around 1990. After a sampling of that year's Change of Season album, we get one live track from a Japanese tour five years later, and then boom, it's 2003, and as Oates puts it, ""we were working with a team of English writers for the Do It for Love album,"" and they're covering Billy Paul and Mad Lads songs, and everything's wrap-up and nostalgia and testimonial dinner. (There's no sign of 1997's Marigold Sky or 2004's covers album Our Kind of Soul, or for that matter 2006's Home for Christmas. Just as well, really.) There's about a disc's worth of excellent pop sprinkled throughout this set-- the same disc's worth that makes up half of The Essential Daryl Hall and John Oates, in fact. Hall and Oates are one of the last long-running, big-name acts to get a boxed set, and listening to the thing suggests why: their hits are toweringly better than almost everything else here, and the ""everything else"" part doesn't do much to illuminate the hits. They insist they're still a going concern, but Do What You Want, Be What You Are feels like a gold watch-- a pro forma reward for four decades of more or less reliable service.","This too expansive look at the lengthy career of Hall and Oates features two great discs and two not so hot ones.

Them Crooked Vultures,Them Crooked Vultures,by: Joe Colly,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a74db1335d7bf1699012/1:1/w_160/f7296f7d.jpg,2009-11-19 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13717-them-crooked-vultures/,Interscope,"There was something almost quaint about watching Them Crooked Vultures' recent performance at Washington D.C.'s 9:30 Club. Yes, the music was punishingly loud and, sure, the chops on display were near godlike, but a bunch of dudes pumping their fists to a hard-rock supergroup? Once the domain of the Claptons and Crosbys of the music world, the supergroup seems to be coming back into vogue. From the Jack White-helmed Raconteurs and Dead Weather to the multi-bearded onslaught of Monsters of Folk, it feels like the confines around a musician's ""main band"" are looser than ever. Which makes sense: the majors' slow death and the general grab-bag atmosphere of the industry makes these collaborations easier than ever. And, of course, they open a new revenue source and creative outlet for the parties involved, so why not? Well, history is littered with plenty of reasons why not (Velvet Revolver or Zwan ring a bell?), but even those dubious of these projects couldn't help but register excitement for Them Crooked Vultures, the much-talked-about alliance of Queens of the Stone Age's Josh Homme, Nirvana/Foo Fighter Dave Grohl, and John Paul Jones, who once played bass for this band called Led Zeppelin. (Also recording and touring with the band is QOTSA's Alain Johannes, let's not forget.) A few of those being, y'know, some of the greatest rock groups of all time and each player a fierce instrumentalist in his own right, the stage seemed set for these gents to join together, like Voltron, into some kind of indestructible hard-rock juggernaut. That happens occasionally on their self-titled debut, but the band also tussles with some of the same problems that have befallen many a supergroup before them. As he's done with past iterations of QOTSA and his long-running Desert Sessions project, Homme takes the lead here, serving as frontman and steering the musical direction. The record features all the trademarks of a Homme-led affair-- druggy, mutant blues, loud/soft dynamics, songs about sex, and regular forays into the silly and absurd. The musicianship throughout is as phenomenal as you'd expect, and on a gut level it's thrilling just to hear these three men play together-- the way Grohl's snapping drum hits ricochet off Jones' rapid-fire bass notes on songs like ""Scumbag Blues"", for instance. (Grohl, in particular, is excellent throughout, affirming once again his destined place in a rock band.) And the guys themselves are clearly having fun. Amidst all the technical shredding, there's a looseness at play that seems to stem in part from Homme and Grohl getting to live out a boyhood fantasy. Oddly that becomes kind of a problem on the record. One of the negative aspects of a supergroup is that the presence of multiple stars tends to disrupt the natural hierarchy of a band-- meaning that there's no one to shoot down bad or unnecessary ideas. If you're Josh Homme and John Paul Jones or Dave Grohl wants to take a bass or drum solo, you let him. And Them Crooked Vultures often feels overstuffed with the weight of too many ideas. This is especially true on longer cuts such as ""Elephants"" and ""Warsaw or the First Breath You Take After You Give Up"", the latter nearly eight minutes of prog-fueled, time-signatured madness that closes with an extended instrumental outro. Sure, these guys have earned the right to do that, but that doesn't make it a good song. Yet for each of these trying numbers, there's a muscular hard-rock track like ""Dead End Friends"" that helps make up for it. And if you simply want to hear Homme/Jones/Grohl sync into a furious, interlocking groove, there are songs like ""Gunman"" that offer that too. Having said that, Them Crooked Vultures still feels like a record to be checked off a list rather than one to live with and fully invest in.","Led Zeppelin's John Paul Jones, Nirvana/Foo Fighters drummer Dave Grohl, and Queens of the Stone Age's Josh Homme resurrect the hard rock supergroup.

Historicity,Vijay Iyer Trio,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a62213d19756521390f4/1:1/w_160/5a1d1405.jpg,2009-11-18 06:00:04,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13412-historicity/,ACT Music + Vision,"The classic Bill Evans Trio, with Scott LaFaro on bass and Paul Motian on drums, is sometimes cited as the best jazz piano trio ever. It's not a point I'd argue-- they were otherworldly. On Portrait in Jazz it doesn't even sound like three musicians playing. The record meets your ear like a feeling meets your brain-- you can't grasp it but you know it's there. Few pieces of music made by more than one person suggest quiet and solitude as powerfully. The Vijay Iyer Trio, with Stephan Crump on bass and Marcus Gilmore on drums, is almost a negative image of the old Bill Evans Trio. The sense of telepathic interplay is there, but it's put toward different ends. If Portrait in Jazz is the sound of aloneness, Historicity is the sound of crowds, a heaving, seething swirl of cross-talk, phrases meeting in often unexpected combinations. It reflects how far both jazz and our world have come in the last 50-odd years. Today, we're never far from information and chatter, and Iyer uses both his own compositions and those of others to stir conversation with his bandmates. The most strikingly modern and heavy-hitting track is Iyer's cover of M.I.A.'s ""Galang"", a startling, compact, and ultimately breathtaking reinvention of the song. It's not some Brad Mehldau look-a-jazz-guy-playing-Radiohead thing either-- this has all the vitality of the original coursing through its thundering block chords, funky backbeat, and fluttering hints of melody on the chorus. He uses the upper octaves of the piano to hammer out a Morse code-like pattern at the beginning of each verse. It stands perfectly well on its own, but it also made me appreciate the original more than I used to, which is about all you can ask of a cover. The other covers don't require quite as much stretching. Stevie Wonder's ""Big Brother"" is a natural fit for this trio, while the version of pianist Andrew Hill's ""Smoke Stack"" reveals an ingredient in Iyer's own sound with its rushing phrases and unceasing motion. Historicity is defined in the liners as ""a condition of being placed in the stream of history,"" and this is something jazz musicians have long been conscious of and displayed in the way they quote each other or interpret each other's tunes. Iyer's placement of a Hill interpretation right next to his own ""Helix"", a cascading, slow-building composition that showcases his pulsing chord-cloud style, historicizes his work in a way by showing its roots. Gilmore's solo is a marvel of textured, nuanced drumming that never gives up its sense of rhythm. The trio's take on Julius Hemphill's ""Dogon A.D."" is faithful to the original's sense of hobbled rhythm and high/low melodic interaction, with Iyer's piano dueling against Crump's lurching arco bass. Iyer's own ""Segment for Sentiment #2"" creates a space for reflection at the album's close, dialing back the ferocity of the trio's interplay for a quiet, almost Evans-ish conversation. It's the kind of respite from daily overstimulation we all need. Iyer and his cohorts have spun the piano trio format into great art here, acknowledging their contemporaries and their musical ancestors. Iyer may be floating in the stream of jazz history now, but if he keeps making records like this, he may one day be a rock that influences the stream's very flow.","The jazz trio continues its outstanding work, reflecting in their music our age of information and chatter. And they do a mean cover of ""Galang"".

Yankee Reality,Hush Arbors,by: Paul Thompson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a745b1335d7bf1698ffb/1:1/w_160/624b19e5.jpg,2009-11-18 06:00:03,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13711-yankee-reality/,Ecstatic Peace,"Keith Wood makes it look easy. Yankee Reality is the second Ecstatic Peace! release from his Hush Arbors in as many years, but his umpteenth this decade, from the same brother-can-I-lend-a-tapedeck school as Six Organs of Admittance and MV & EE and every bit as prolific and collaboration-friendly. His voice-- a gentle, reedy, wafting falsetto reminiscent of Bon Iver's Justin Vernon or TV on the Radio's Kyp Malone-- emotes nimbly, with little apparent effort. His music, a mostly laid-back blend of all sorts of rusty Americana, rarely causes a racket; hushed, you see. And he and the Arbors have made a leap from last year's self-titled affair that feels markedly deliberate and completely natural. With help from another guy who makes what he does look easy-- Dinosaur Jr.'s J Mascis, who produced and plays on the LP-- Yankee Reality does its predecessor a few better in the song department"", and then close it with to ""For Reality, Wood brought in 10 appealing agile country-rock leaning yearners, then he and Mascis went to town on 'em; whereas a good chunk of Hush Arbors' past work got by on a lot of impressionistic detail, for a genial, unhurried folk record, Yankee Reality feels pretty direct. Yankee Reality's a confident but freewheeling set of finely tuned heartbreakers dressed up in rollicking arrangements that aren't allowed to run riot over the tunes. Things get off to a nice start on brief spindly strummer ""Day Before"", brighter and busier than anything on Hush Arbors, imbued with an affecting lilt and lent further warmth once Wood gets to singing. Riding a standup-slap bassline, the searching ""Lisbon"" smacks of a properly medicated Okkervil River, while ""Fast Asleep"" shuffles and drones like a less maudlin Will Oldham number. Mascis makes his presence known with a few odd guitar stabs here and there, but he's at his best behind the boards, reigning in all the jerry-rigged instrumentation and keeping the spotlight on Wood's voice. Like Mascis, Wood's a bit of a mumbler, but his plainspoken lyrics have never felt so central to the music. And, while he'll occasionally lose you in a few too many swallowed syllables, every once in a while you get a ruminative road tripper like ""that old highway in my life"" or ""wondering how many bottles have led me to here,"" and Yankee Reality's hazy essence rushes into focus. There are a couple of moments on Yankee Reality that pass by without much notice, the warmth of Wood's voice and Mascis' enveloping production occasionally coming together to lull rather than linger. But on an album this mellow, a little balance is key to cohesion, especially when you get around to closer ""Devil Made You High"". It's a barnburner, blasting off into the stratosphere on the back of Mascis' racket and Wood's bleary, almost bluesy vocal. It's testament to what a fine pairing this is that they could pull off a tune like ""Devil"" and a tumbling rockabilly ballad like ""Coming Home"" with equal success and, more importantly, ease. Wherever Hush Arbors takes Wood next, here's hoping he and Mascis run into each other again along the way.","Freak-folk vets make a leap from last year's self-titled Ecstatic Peace! debut that feels markedly deliberate and completely natural. J Mascis produces.

Ask the Night,Orenda Fink,by: Stephen M.

That album took her outside of her comfort zone, setting her vocals in ever more intricate soundscapes and tempering its shortcomings with a see-what-sticks experimental approach. Ask the Night was recorded in Omaha and Athens, Georgia-- two of Fink's old haunts-- and written partly with fellow Alabaman Chris Lawson, a Birmingham poet and artist who designed the album cover. It ought to be more engaging and comfortable than O+S, but Ask the Night displays little of the compelling weirdness of her previous material. Losing the full-band sound of her 2005 solo debut, Invisible Ones, Fink adopts a more austere and rustic approach, recording a batch of coffeehouse tunes with a parallax relationship to genre: Her history and label suggest staunch indie folk (think any of the female Broken Social Scene offshoots). Considered from a slightly different angle, however, Fink sounds like she could open for more mainstream artists like Norah Jones or Vienna Teng. ""High Ground"" is an exception and the most obvious keeper, with its spectral mandolin, ragged backing vocals from Modest Mouse's Isaac Brock, and a chorus as incisive as it is evocative. ""There's a rain comin' down to the valley below, and I know just how they feel,"" Fink sings plaintively, before adding the clincher, ""'cause when the water rises, they start to look for high ground, just like me when you come around."" It's the album's best moment, a hint at what it could have been, but nothing else on Ask the Night even begins to approach the stark candor of that unraveling metaphor. Instead, she's content to ask vaguely rhetorical questions about the night (""Why is the night sad?"") or to counsel you to ask such questions (""Ask the night what it stole from you, and can it be returned?""). Such a fixation comes across not as a powerful existential equation, but as a frustrating obliqueness that gives the album a slipshod quality, as if these songs are rough-draft sketches instead of finished paintings. In fact, at times she comes across as pandering, delivering pallid bromides like ""The Garden"" with its disingenuous there-there: ""If you lose your home, and you lose all you've worked for, if you lose it all, it's all right."" That's all the wisdom she's got for us, and her perkily staccato phrasing on that last syllable suggests a passive-aggressive spirituality that's useless in the face of real tragedy. Such moments might be more forgivable if they were more ignorable, but Fink writes spartan arrangements meant to highlight her vocals. That de-emphasis doesn't benefit the music, which is too tastefully low-key even on the lazy strut of ""Alabama"" and the modified waltz of ""Sister"". Fink has a lovely voice, clear and direct and expressive especially in its lower register, but her lyrical cadences don't always match up to their melodic lines, resulting in some awkward phrasings on ""Why Is the Night Sad"" and ""The Garden"". This is an album that suffers in the context of Fink's career. She is an obviously talented artist working well below the standards she's set for herself as both one half of Azure Ray and a solo artist, and if that makes for a disappointing album... well, it's not all right at all.","Azure Ray singer trades the full-band sound of her solo debut for a more rustic approach.

The Apple and the Tooth,Bibio,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a7415e6ef95969320f2a/1:1/w_160/72ee6d3f.jpg,2009-11-18 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13707-the-apple-and-the-tooth/,Warp,"After switching up his game on the startlingly good Ambivalence Avenue, Bibio became his own tough act to follow. As if lingering in the moment, he now issues The Apple and the Tooth, which collects remixes of his breakthrough album with four new tracks. They lack the immediate impact of Avenue's highs, because they pull back from wrenched beats into the more familiar territories of folk and psychedelia. They're good tracks, they just grow on you more slowly. They'd have been even better if he'd finished them. The title track is killer, although it sounds more Stones Throw than Warp-- bounding flute loops, ratcheting percussion, and whizzing guitars shimmy like a bum wheel. It seems like it's building toward something great, but then just ends after a couple of minutes, mid-development. ""Rotten Rudd"" does the same thing. At least ""Bones & Skulls"", sparkling but thick with incense, feels more like a song than a draft. But then on ""Steal the Lamp"" (lava, one presumes), we're back to the two-minute bailout, after glowing scales traced around pittering drums prime us for a drenching psychedelic anthem. The compelling yet skimpy new material feels mostly like an occasion for the remixes, some of which are actually quite worthwhile. Bibio's own retooling of ""Palm of Your Wave"" is arguably more essential than his new productions. The vocal is the same, but there's a new guitar part that snakes like ivy. It's meaningfully transformed, yet still angelically songful. The other successful remixes follow suit. Wax Stag smooths out the jumpy ""Sugarette"" into a dreamy new-wave ballad, its vocal accents cunningly wrought into a dainty music-box lead. Eskmo turns ""Dwrcan"" into a lurching, primordial thing, amplifying a faint oozy quality already latent in it. And Leatherette puts ""Lovers' Carvings"" on ice, using pitch-shifted vocal snippets to abstractly sketch its melody. Others squander the rich source material, usually by interpreting ""remix"" as ""molest."" Clark epitomizes this approach, dousing fragments of ""S'vive"" in his magic powder and reorganizing them into a scattering, tempo-warped pulse. He produces some fascinating effects, but it seems more like an expo for his skills than a tribute to Bibio. If Clark goes too far, the Gentlemen Losers don't go far enough-- they simply strip ""Haikuesque"" almost nude, though it remains very pretty. Detuned squelches have gotten tired by the time Keaver & Brause's ""Fire Ant"" comes around-- the baggy evocation of horns is kind of neat, but it's more like an extended vamp than a composition. At the nadir, Lone makes ""All the Flowers"" sound abysmal with unattractive detuning and throttling. Why take on a minute-long interstitial, anyway, when no one's touched ""Jealous of Roses""? The omission of Avenue's most daring, soulful track, and the recruitment of some remixers who represent the murky style Bibio only recently grew out of, make The Apple and the Tooth feel faintly regressive, although you can't read too much into a stopgap like this. The frugality of the new material forestalls the answer as to how Bibio will be able to top Avenue, but it's good enough to keep us asking the question.","The Warp producer collects remixes from his breakthrough album, Ambivalence Avenue, and adds four new tracks on this 2009 punctuation mark.

Don't Stop / All Night EP,Annie,by: Matthew Perpetua,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a734ea9e61561daa5525/1:1/w_160/78e0cf01.jpg,2009-11-18 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13696-dont-stop-all-night-ep/,Smalltown Supersound,"Annie's second album, Don't Stop, was supposed to come out last year, and for the Norwegian singer's net-savvy audience, it basically did. The version of the record that is being commercially released now is a bit different from what leaked in 2008-- a few tracks have been cut, a few more have been added-- but since it is being released with a bonus disc that includes every notable excluded track save for her cover of Stacey Q's ""Two of Hearts"", the final product is less glass-half-empty and more cup-runneth-over. Her final running order for the album proper is certainly an artistic statement worth taking seriously, but we all know that our experience with this music has been and will continue to be a flexible thing, so why should the boundaries of plastic discs matter so much for an artist so closely associated with mp3s? Even if CD releases and official track listings are formal considerations that are not entirely significant to Annie's context as a star in a largely theoretical Internet pop universe, it's almost impossible to engage with any version of Don't Stop without thinking about what is ""missing."" The most notable omissions from Don't Stop are its top-notch lead single ""I Know UR Girlfriend Hates Me"" and its Italo-disco follow-up ""Anthonio"", each co-written and produced by Hannah Robinson and Richard X, the duo who previously collaborated with Annie on the excellent Anniemal tracks ""Chewing Gum"" and ""Me Plus One"". Though these songs were cut, ostensibly in the interest of keeping the album fresh, it's perplexing to remove such strong material. To make matters worse, the only track from Robinson and X to make it to the official Don't Stop is the clear highlight ""Songs Remind Me of You"". This is a strange thing: If Annie has so much proven chemistry with these two writers, why isn't she doing more with them? At least part of the answer to that question is that she's been busy working with other producers, namely Girls Aloud masterminds Xenomania, Bloc Party and the Rapture collaborator Paul Epworth, and Timo Kaukolampi, who co-wrote a majority of her debut. Each has a distinct aesthetic, but there is enough balance and common ground in the arrangements that Epworth's sleek electro and Kaukolampi's dense rhythms are complemented rather than overwhelmed by Xenomania's hyperactive hooks. That's not always the case for Annie herself, though. Her demure yet sassy voice is flattered by the production team's efforts on the zippy ""My Love Is Better"" and the cutesy ""Heaven and Hell"", but she's flattened by ""Loco"", a terrific song that is nonetheless so Xenomania-by-numbers that it simply sounds like a Girls Aloud single dropped in the middle of an Annie album. It's not all her fault, though. The Xenomania sound is just so overpowering that you'd never guess that Alex Kapranos and Nick McCarthy of Franz Ferdinand happen to play on the track as well. Though the Xenomania cuts are all of good-to-great quality, Paul Epworth's tracks are far more successful in emphasizing Annie's character. ""Hey Annie"", a song not present on the original leaked version of Don't Stop, kicks the record off with layered rhythms and spare synthesizer accents that allow her usually wispy voice to be the richest, most alluring element in the arrangement. Whereas the Xenomania crew seem indifferent to her limitations as a vocalist, Epworth is good at finding ways to highlight her best qualities-- the gentle wit, the worldliness in her girlish tone-- while keeping the emphasis placed firmly on grooves. ""Hey Annie"", along with Epworth productions ""I Don't Like Your Band"" and ""Don't Stop"" are the songs that are most effective as dance music rather than perky Europop. That said, Kaukolampi's ""The Breakfast Song"" strives for dance floor utility, but unfortunately its blunt, insistent chorus-- ""What do you WANT? What do you want for BREAK-FAST?""-- comes out sounding like a maddening jingle for the Scandinavian equivalent of IHOP. His other contributions are respectable but not particularly exciting, though ""Take You Home"" does provide a dark center for a record generally lacking in melancholy and heavy moods. It is standard practice for modern pop records to be assembled in this sort of piecemeal fashion, but Annie's choice of collaborators is very deliberate, both in terms of curatorial taste, and in finding the right artists to achieve the specific end of assembling a dynamic album. Though it is typically the producer and co-writer's job to bring out the best in the star, Annie's best work has a way of encapsulating the appeal of her partners, whether it's showcasing Richard X's gift for giving 1980s pop aesthetics a modern make-over, or Xenomania's glossy, super-charged pop-rock hybrid. Not every song on Don't Stop or its bonus All Night EP is a classic, but Annie's good taste has yielded another fine crop of pop tunes. As with anything else these days, how you listen to this music is entirely up to you, but there is more than enough excellent material here to customize your own version of the record, slip your favorite tracks into a playlist, or you know, listen exactly as Annie intends.","After a long wait and a battle with her former record label, electro-pop should-be star finally issues her second album, plus a bonus EP of older ideas.

Continent,CFCF,by: Zach Kelly,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6f55e6ef95969320e72/1:1/w_160/b7891a4b.jpg,2009-11-17 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13648-continent/,Paper Bag,"Much of the music one might compare to CFCF's debut album, Continent, leans on an external medium or function. Like a lush film score, theme for a forgotten Don Johnson TV pilot, or an unused in-house mixtape intended to fill intermission space, Continent at first seems like a throwback record that really opens up only in a specific time and place. And to a degree, that's to be expected coming from a self-professed film geek who is likely keener on the idea of chatting about Cronenberg than Kraftwerk. Michael Silver, the Montreal-based 21-year-old behind CFCF, has garnered a modest following as a producer and prolific remix artist (you might remember him as the guy who won that Crystal Castles remix contest with his ambitious reconfiguring of ""Air War""). And Continent, a surprisingly confident debut, suggests that he's equally concerned with how his music sounds as he is with where it's heard. As successful as Continent is at evoking mood using deliberate pacing and ripe textures, it also managed to wrap its meticulously pruned pop reticence around everything from hushed poser-disco suites (""Invitation to Love"") to sexy, swoon-struck soft-rock grooves (""Raining Patterns""). Hell, there's even a great Fleetwood Mac cover wedged in there, too. Since it's so easy to lose yourself in these lithe, languid electronic ruminations, it's no wonder that nearly everything I've read about CFCF-- and more specifically Continent itself-- has focused on the cinematic characteristics in Silver's work. But fair may it be to categorize these dozen tracks as a series of very accomplished daydream canvases, Continent becomes a richer experience when looked at as independent of any peripheral distraction, with its pop-friendly attention-grabbers very much in the foreground. There's a patient, reserved quality at work that will no doubt land Continent a few iPod gigs in chic bistros. But to water down these beat-bolstered two-steppers-- like the propulsive, joyous Mac cover ""Big Love"" or the Quincy Jones-styled funk-out ""Half Dreaming""-- is to rob them of their inherent catchiness and accessibility. Often a little sad or playing to a kind of ethereal, out-of-body vibe, most of the memorable moments here are ones that are felt with the hips, not the head. And that's likely because these are, for the most part, unapologetically svelte tunes jam-packed with cues taken from body-high inducing ambient atmospherics, beatific house loopings, 70s AM Easy Cheese, and bubbly Balearic turns. All of this might appear indicative of how we spent our 2009 summer vacation (see ""chillwave""), and while there are unmistakable nostalgic underpinnings that help define Silver's music, it's never cloyingly obvious. Where artists like Neon Indian or Washed Out rely on instant gratification to transport a listener back to specific time or feeling, CFCF's music is less concerned with arriving at a discernible destination than it is with detailing the journey. These are lengthy tunes for the most part (a few of the best clocking in well over seven minutes), so it's easy to lose track of every fleeting emotion or quirky little melody that happens to float on by. Indeed, large parts of Continent may be considered too cautious or circuitous for the casual listener-- Easter eggs like that Prince-in-the-driving-rain guitar solo on ""You Hear Colours"" or the patient, synth-soaked yearning that plays throughout ""Snake Charmer"" might not be able to so readily produce any real effusive payoff for some. However, by employing a bit of listener fortitude, you'll hopefully unlock the vibrancy that lies at Continent's core and defines it as the sure-footed, elegantly stated electro-pop record it most certainly is.","This young Montreal producer, best known at this point for his remixes and a collaboration with Sally Shapiro, offers an accomplished debut full-length.

Sugarland,Talk Normal,by: Marc Masters,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a70613d19756521392fe/1:1/w_160/8a73a0b9.jpg,2009-11-17 06:00:03,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13662-sugarland/,Rare Book Room,"A year after forming in 2007, Brooklyn's Talk Normal self-released Secret Cog, an EP filled with rigorous beats, post-punk dissonance, and the darkly evocative vocals of guitarist Sarah Register and drummer Andrya Ambro. Echoes of No Wave-era noisemakers-- particularly the dogmatic rants of Lydia Lunch's Teenage Jesus and the Jerks and the urgent abstractions of Ut-- were unmistakable. But the duo also has firm roots in the present New York underground, specifically the noise-rock of veteran trio Sightings, whose Richard Hoffman guested on Secret Cog's best track, ""33"". Not long after that debut, Talk Normal signed to Rare Book Room Records, enabling them to record their first LP, Sugarland, with producer and label-owner Nicolas Vernhes. This has naturally brought an increase in clarity and detail, but the band's propensity for thick noise and rhythmic tension hasn't waned. In fact, the essential grit and guts of their music have deepened. Songs and lyrics remain simple-- most tracks feature a repetitive beat and blunt statements like ""You had it coming,"" ""Don't shut me down,"" and, aptly enough, ""I believe in structure."" But the way the pair rides these patterns to bracing climaxes is deft and relentless. And their eerie horror-movie tone has grown, approaching the cavernous territory first dug out by the early dirges of Sonic Youth and Swans. That heavy atmosphere relies on Register's diverse, textured guitar, which is like a muscle stretched across the skeleton of Ambro's beats. She often begins songs with minimal chords, but soon morphs them into layered blare that sounds like Thurston Moore and Lee Ranaldo inhabiting one body-- or, perhaps more accurately, a multi-dimensional take on Lunch's spraying blasts. On strident pieces like ""In a Strangeland"" and ""Bold Face"", her churning noise matches the duo's coolly desperate howls. Later, her see-sawing treble on ""Transmission Lost"" adds hopeful swing to the call-and-response. And her guitar is the clear star of ""River's Edge"", a kind of ""Death Valley '69"" update that slowly loses its strict beat, indicating the duo can loosen up their rhythmic lock-step when they want to. In fact, you can hear seeds of expansion on the four tracks that follow ""River's Edge"". ""Uniforms"" offers a raga-like guitar figure; Ambro's drumming on ""Warrior"" has a digital crunch not far from slow-burn IDM; and ""Outside"" features a wiry, scraping saxophone. But it's on Sugarland's best track-- a cover of Roxy Music's ""In Every Dream Home a Heartache""-- where Talk Normal stretches farthest. Opening with three minutes of beatific synth and half-spoken vocals, the duo follows the original's ultimate line-- ""but you blew my mind""-- not with glam bombast, but muscular, stomping noise. It sounds less like Roxy Music than the Velvet Underground, particularly the moment when Lou Reed used the declaration ""and then my mind split open"" to throw ""I Heard Her Call My Name"" into overdrive. Talk Normal may not yet possess VU-level power, but the fact that they can even evoke such magic practically guarantees a promising future.","No Wave-inspired band makes its Rare Book Room debut, bringing an increase in clarity and detail to its thick noise.

Ultraviolet,Kid Sister,by: Tom Breihan,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a7299d034d5c69bf370f/1:1/w_160/e7588dea.jpg,2009-11-17 06:00:02,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13684-ultraviolet/,Downtown,"Ultraviolet doesn't sound like an album nearly three years in the making, but that's what it is. Chicago party-rapper Kid Sister dropped the breezy nail-salon jam ""Pro Nails"" in spring 2007, and the song went viral when Kanye West showed up for a superstar cameo. Kid Sister's spent the intervening years recording a debut, scratching it, starting over, tinkering, and finally coming out with the product she really wanted to release. And it's... a 40-minute, 12-track dance-rap full-length without a single hard punchline or trenchant moment, the sort of thing that sounds like it could've been banged out in a couple of weeks. Turns out this isn't the hipster-rap Detox. Fortunately for Kid Sis, Sparks-addled party rap has not, as a genre, advanced much since ""Pro Nails"". A number of the tracks on Ultraviolet became blog favorites years ago, but beyond that, the album sounds about as current as it would've if she'd cranked it out in a timely manner. In fact, the record comes considerably less stuffed with ideas than, say, Spank Rock's YoYoYoYoYo or Fannypack's So Stylistic, years-old albums that covered similar stylistic ground but twisted and sputtered and wriggled as much as they could've without leaving their dancey, lightweight wheelhouses. Those albums came equipped with a restless, inventive sense of fun. Ultraviolet, for the most part, just sits there. Production-wise, Ultraviolet is a dance album, not a rap album. The beats, from folks like XXXchange, Sinden, and boyfriend/label boss A-Trak, blow by at frantic but assured clips, picking up and then discarding little melodic ideas as they go. We hear a lot of ravey, diffuse synth stabs and compressed Ed Bangery blurts. ""Big n Bad"" stops just short of jacking Europe's ""Final Countdown"" synth riff. ""Let Me Bang 2009"" rests on a pretty cloud of keyboards. A few moments of hammy melody call up memories of cheesed-out 90s hi-NRG Euro-dance, stuff like Vengaboys or DJ Sammy. But the only time the album's musical palette shifts in any significant way is on ""Switch Board"", where Chicago juke producer DJ Gant-Man uses the same ingredients to push a more frantic, furious idea of party-rocking. When Kid Sis and Gant-Man abandon rapping entirely near the end and resort to barking out dance instructions and party-chants, it's like finally. Kid Sister is not a great rapper, or even a good one. She spits out all her words with a nasal, scrunched-up, exaggerated pronunciation, the kind of thing that reminds me of actors in teen movies rapping for laughs. When she attempts punchlines, the results are pretty grisly: ""Boy, you got a problem? Holler at Dr. Phil/ I'll put a hurting on ya and I do it in some heels."" She barely stays on top of her beats, and she never switches up her cadences. Lyrically, she rarely steps far outside her favorite subject-- partying-- or even implies that much life exists beyond it. After three tracks of ""yeah, let's dance"", it's almost a relief to her her come with ""Step"", a song about flirting with an overly aggressive dude in a club-- still a song about partying, mind you, but at least a slightly new aspect of it. Kid Sis's hipster-circuit party-rap has always been a weird and barely acknowledged corner of the rap universe, but the subgenre's best rappers (Spank Rock's Naeem Juwan, for instance) radiate the same intensity that all good rappers do-- the idea that they have to keep rapping or they'll fall to pieces. Kid Sister doesn't have that. And as she shows on Ultraviolet's best moment, she doesn't necessarily need to lean on it. My favorite song on the album is the one with no rapping whatsoever. ""You Ain't Really Down"" is an irresistible little piece of freestyle/electro revisionism, Kid Sis working a surprisingly nimble singing voice over a pinging, bottom-heavy track. Even though she's singing about being heartbroken, there's a fun approachability in her voice, and she multitracks in some new jack swing backing vocals that remind me of ""Motownphilly"" more than anything else. An album of Kid Sis singing songs like this might be worth a three-year wait. An album like this one? Not so much.","After three years of work, the once-anticipated Kid Sister album finally sees its release.

Space Oddity [40th Anniversary Edition],David Bowie,by: Stuart Berman,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6c79d034d5c69bf360e/1:1/w_160/f4920f1b.jpg,2009-11-17 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13610-space-oddity-40th-anniversary-edition/,EMI,"Through the 1970s, David Bowie built his legend on a parade of changing persona and shrewd stylistic shifts. But his initial, late-1960s forays into the music industry illustrate that there's a fine line between ""chameleonic"" and ""indecisive""-- in his early years, Bowie tried make his name variously as a mod bluesman, a traditional folksinger, an Anthony Newley-schooled theatrical raconteur and, on his 1967 self-titled debut, a music-hall dandy. Ironically, it was a song seemingly most susceptible to a brief, novelty-tune shelf life that would prove to be his first enduring work: the 1969 single ""Space Oddity"", which, of course, riffed on the similarly titled Stanley Kubrick blockbuster of the day, and was fortuitously timed to court a space-crazed populace still abuzz from that summer's lunar landing. The ploy didn't quite pay off-- though the ""Space Oddity"" single cracked the UK Top 5, the sophomore album on which it appeared flopped, as the efforts to establish the David Bowie brand resulted in a confusing release strategy. His UK label, Phillips, issued the album in Britain as David Bowie (making it his second self-titled album), while his U.S. benefactors at Mercury christened it with a title that begged to have it relegated to the folk-section cut-out bin: Man of Words/Man of Music. But rather than prompt another career about-face, the album's prog-folk hymnals (complete with guest keyboard wizardry from Rick Wakeman of Yes) helped point the way to the artful glam-rock that would make Bowie a superstar-- upon which he would reissue the album in 1972 and rename it after its most famous song. As such, this 40th-anniversary reissue of Space Oddity does not so much commemorate a great album-- it doesn't even rank among Bowie's 10 best-- but rather the true first chapter in an often brilliant career (not to mention the dawn of Bowie's fruitful collaborative relationship with producer Tony Visconti). Tellingly, the title track has opened pretty much every Bowie greatest-hits compilation of note, and rightfully so-- not only does its still-thrilling rocket-launch structure anticipate Bowie's own supernova ascent, the song's themes of splendid isolation and uncertain futurism would prove ever-present motifs in his work up through 1980's Scary Monsters. But if the song dramatically reinvents Bowie as a sci-fi folkie-- serving as the middle-man between late-60s hippie idealism and early-70s disillusionment-- with few exceptions, the rest of Space Oddity isn't quite as eager to thrust forth into the great unknown. Instead, we hear a young dude who's still back home with his Beatles and his Stones (see: the perfunctory ""Hey Jude"" group-chorus coda of ""Memory of a Free Festival"" for the former; the extended blues boogie of ""Unwashed and Somewhat Slightly Dazed"" for the latter), with a well-worn copy of Love's Forever Changes close at hand-- all that's missing from the mellotronic psych-folk serenade ""An Occasional Dream"" is an Arthur Lee co-write credit. So amid these stately surroundings, side-one closer ""Cygnet Committee"" stands out not just by virtue of its nine-minute length, but for its strident disavowal of hippie platitudes (""[we] stoned the poor on slogans such as 'Wish you could hear!' 'Love is all we need!' 'Kick out the jams!' 'Kick out your mother!'""); likewise, Bowie's voice overpowers the song's languid folk-rock sway as if it were a shackle, introducing his signature technique of intensifying and accelerating his delivery to break free of the verses' pre-established cadences. It's the birth of the classic David Bowie Affectation-- the one that's been embraced/lampooned by everyone from the Frogs and Ween and Destroyer to Flight of the Conchords-- making ""Cygnet Committee"" as important a breakthrough for Bowie as Space Oddity's more celebrated title track. Comparatively, Space Oddity's other epic set pieces-- the over-orchestrated fable ""The Wild-Eyed Boy From Freecloud"" and hippie-dream requiem ""Memory of a Free Festival""-- are too baroque in their presentation to fully transcend the status of time-capsule curios. But they're still historically significant for introducing Bowie's future foil Mick Ronson, who makes an uncredited appearance on the former, while contributing some six-string muscle to the improved, two-part single version of ""Free Festival"", included on this set's 15-track bonus disc. A handful of these rarities have surfaced previously-- namely on the 1989 Sound+Vision box set, the 1990 CD reissue of Space Oddity and the 2000 Bowie on the Beeb radio-sessions compilation-- and the set feels excessively padded with (not-so) alternate mixes. But taken together, they illuminate the rapidity of Bowie's evolution between the album's conception and its promotion, from an embryonic demo version of ""Space Oddity"" (sung in a higher register and different meter) to the superior, stripped-down versions of ""An Occasional Dream"" and ""Freecloud"", the Marc Bolan-backed single version of eventual Aladdin Sane track ""The Prettiest Star"" and the proto-Spiders From Mars swagger of ""London Bye Ta-Ta"". And throughout it all, Bowie even found the time to learn another language, cutting a lyrically revised Italian version of ""Space Oddity"" (""Ragazza Solo, Ragazza Sola"") to compete with a wave of successful cover versions in Italy. It 's hardly the most flattering portrait of a man who would go on to sell the world, but still a quaint keepsake from a time when he was just trying to blag his way through mainland Europe.","Celebrating the true first chapter in an often brilliant career, David Bowie's second studio album is reissued, complete with a 15-track bonus disc.

Real Estate,Real Estate,by: David Bevan,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a73c5e6ef95969320f1a/1:1/w_160/d09115ef.jpg,2009-11-17 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13703-real-estate/,Woodsist,"Real Estate were born in the depths of one New Jersey summer. Frontman Martin Courtney had just returned home to his native Ridgewood from college in Washington State, a few fresh songs in his pockets. He'd been playing music with bassist Alex Bleeker and guitarist Matthew Mondanile since high school in various forms, even covering Weezer and the Strokes records from tip to tail. But during the summer of 2008, Real Estate didn't get nostalgic for just their specific suburban nights, crushes, or favorite bands as teens-- they fashioned a tin can-and-string to memories more universal. Their self-titled debut LP is a collection of those first underwater pop songs and onward, 7"" cuts and mpfrees that have been backstroking their way across the Web and into lo-fi nerdpiles. Over the past year, many of these songs have soundtracked a time when it feels like every kid in or just out of college seems to be handcrafting/clamoring for music that shuttles us back to a time before career choices, adult responsibility, and this recession. And while the Jersey Shore has clearly become the beating heart of their current aesthetic, Real Estate captures a rock band several lengths ahead of the fuzzy beach bums with which they pine. Real Estate share tones with North Jersey indie rock titans Yo La Tengo and the Feelies, pouring those influences through warm impressions of oldies radio. Riffs are cyclical and massaged, harmonies familiar. Each song is dunked in reverb and delay, though always with serious restraint. Most importantly, all boast architecture that still allows for swaths of jamming, the feeling that every measure's unfolding as easily as life ought to. ""Atlantic City"" is a fitting entrance point, an instrumental that lopes along on a humid bass line before Courtney and Mondanile (the mind behind the cassette adventures of Ducktails) begin gently braiding together strands of trebly surf guitar over Mexican güiro. Single ""Beach Comber"" keeps things light as Courtney looks for meaning in the sand while Mondanile pokes around with his Strat. The bedrock here (see ""Fake Blues"") is almost krautrock-y in the way each layer repeats itself, a bent that might prove too drowsy for some. But as is the case for much of the experience, Mondanile adds classic rock sugars throughout, taking off on a solo at the three-minute mark that unbuttons everything really gracefully. Elsewhere, ""Black Lake"" is a gorgeous waltz whose slide recalls Modest Mouse's late-1990s take on the 1959 Santo & Jonny classic ""Sleepwalk"". Because Courtney's croon can be tough to make out at times, those watercolor frequencies lend that overwhelming sense of longing real grip, jam passages often more evocative than spaces that feature vocals. Nowhere on this debut is that better absorbed than on midpoint palate-cleanser ""Let's Rock the Beach"" or the six-minute shimmer of ""Suburban Beverage"". With the exception of the limp ""Pool Swimmers"", every part remains remarkably crisp. But what sets Real Estate apart from the rest of the herd is how evergreen its beauty can be. Despite the summery song titles and the beach balling associations that might follow these guys around, this music transcends the notion of seasons. Inside the overcast tenor of ""Black Lake"" and the airy upstrokes of ""Green River"", there's much more at play here than what goes on between the months of June through September. And impressionism aside, this is a band whose chemistry and technical gifts suggest there's more coming down the pipeline: more good times to be soundtracked, and more songs and records and sounds to communicate exactly that.","After several excellent singles, New Jersey's Real Estate deliver on their full-length debut with a rich collection of evocative and haunting songs.

Machine Dreams,Little Dragon,by: Matthew Perpetua,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a73a13d1975652139374/1:1/w_160/73f54c9d.jpg,2009-11-16 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13701-machine-dreams/,Peacefrog,"Throughout much of the past decade, dance-oriented electronic-leaning pop music has erred on the side of stark utility, reducing beats and hooks down to an elemental thud and grind. What tends to get lost in this sparsely arranged music, particularly when we're dealing with lesser artists and total hacks, is color and atmosphere. Without these things, songs can feel incredibly clinical and soulless-- throbbing grooves almost completely devoid of context. Little Dragon, a quartet from Gothenburg, Sweden, are not entirely removed from the electro and modern R&B influences of their time, but their arrangements make a point of foregrounding ambiance and texture. Whereas too many post-Timbaland, post-electroclash records can seem like sentences stripped of adjectives and proper nouns, the tones on the group's sophomore album Machine Dreams suggest complex emotions and vivid scenery with exquisite detail. The emphasis on atmosphere is made clear from the very start of Machine Dreams, as album opener ""A New"" begins and ends with electronic drones, as if to bracket the song in ellipses like an unfinished thought. The subsequent song, ""Looking Glass"", is firmer, more beat-driven, but as much as its groove is steady, as a whole it seems to wander. Motion and physicality is strongly implied by the rhythm, but the leisurely pace and subtly shifting keyboard tones indicate changes in setting, evoking a sense that we're stumbling around lost in some strange, beautiful city. This sets the tone for the rest of the album, which goes off on the tangents of different rhythms into other textural zones, but maintains a feeling of searching around for something, whether it is a person, a destination, a state of mind, or the right words to express some ineffable thought. Little Dragon's palette is broad enough to lend the album a rich, luscious sound, but specific enough to ground the work in a particular time and place, though the definition of both terms is left to the listener's imagination. Some of the songs, like ""Looking Glass"" and ""My Step"", sound like a 1980s version of the future, and owe a debt to the keyboard aesthetics of freestyle and Prince circa Sign 'O' the Times. Others, like the gorgeous ballad ""Feather"" and the claustrophobic ""Thunder Love"", bring to mind the dystopian sexiness of Tricky's early classics on Maxinquaye and Pre-Millennium Tension. Yukimi Nagano, the band's charismatic Swedish-Japanese vocalist, has a smokey yet agile voice, and it serves as the anchor of each song. She avoids melisma, but her phrasing is in the general wheelhouse of modern R&B, particularly British iterations of the genre. As with every other element of their sound, Nagano's voice places Little Dragon's music in a lineage of recognizable influences under a vague ""urban"" umbrella, but it all comes out just a bit off, which is to say, unexpected and original. Machine Dreams is at once familiar and slightly alien, and the emotional center is both intuitively obvious and intentionally vague. Nagano is the type of writer and singer who lets her words roughly sketch out a feeling that she embellishes with her voice. This approach puts more faith in the unique effects of music-- there is no sense in being direct and literal when singing can convey the sort of nuance that is almost impossible to express in other forms of communication. The album falters slightly when the music becomes more abstract and inscrutable, but on the whole it is not difficult to relate to Nagano or slip into the mood created by her bandmates. That mood is slippery and hard to define, but that's not so much a problem as it is part of the appeal, as the band navigate the strange spaces between big, easily identifiable emotions.","Swedish quartet make dance-oriented electronic-leaning pop that foregrounds ambiance and texture, as Tricky once did so well.

Ignore the Ignorant,The Cribs,by: Stuart Berman,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a740c0084474cd0c0b46/1:1/w_160/db1ad929.jpg,2009-11-16 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13709-ignore-the-ignorant/,Warner Bros.Wichita,"Halfway through the Cribs' new album, singer/bassist Gary Jarman issues a plea to remember him like ""last year's snow,"" but really, the Yorkshire band should be feeling a little more secure in their standing within the mod-eat-mod world of Britpop. Not only have the band lived to see their fourth album-- while other post-Libertines peers like the Others and the View get cast aside like so much NME roadkill-- their chart placements keep going up; Ignore the Ignorant recently hit No. 8 in the UK. And the band have been equally successful at turning its heroes into collaborators; having previously enlisted the services of everyone from Bobby Conn and Orange Juice's Edwyn Collins to Franz Ferdinand's Alex Kapranos and Sonic Youth's Lee Ranaldo, the Cribs are now living out the ultimate indie pop fantasy-camp dream by recruiting Smiths guitar hero Johnny Marr as a full-fledged official fourth member. That development may seem less staggering given Marr's recent Modest Mouse tenure, but while the guitarist was absorbed into that band's backwoods art-funk framework, the crystalline guitar pop heard on Ignore the Ignorant-- produced by Public Image Ltd./Birthday Party vet Nick Launay-- leaves little doubt as to who's taking cues from whom. Marr's presence is immediately felt on opening track ""We Were Aborted"", which fills in the spaces between the Cribs' usual staccato-riff schematic with counter-melodies that give the song more room to breathe without sacrificing its pressurized thrust, rendering it a distant British cousin to the Foo Fighters' ""Everlong"". This transformative process-- from post-punky pub-rockers to graceful pop songsmiths-- plays out all through Ignore the Ignorant, though not without its growing pains. As a band fond of naming indie rock influences that are several degrees more idiosyncratic than the music they actually produce, the Cribs are prone to hampering their songs' increasingly dignified presentations with screaming; the hoarse chorus howls on gleaming lead single ""Cheat on Me"" feel overly melodramatic, and the circa-1963 slow dance reverie of ""Save Your Secrets"" is upended by a lumbering, overwrough [#script:http://pitchfork.com/media/backend/js/tiny_mce/themes/advanced/langs/en.js]|||||| t middle eight that feels like it barged in from another song. The six-minute anomaly ""City of Bugs"", meanwhile, sees the Cribs stretching out into nocturnal, Sonic Youthian terrain, but despite Ryan Jarman's best attempts at Thurston Moore-like sing-speak, the song just feels like an excuse to unleash some string-snapping guitar squall. Ignore the Ignorant fares much better when the Cribs keep their contrarian tendencies in check and remind themselves that, ""holy shit, we've got Johnny fucking Marr in our band!"" Compared to Morrissey's oblique but resonant lyricism, the Jarmans deal in provocative sound-bite slogans (e.g., ""your virility has made me forget empathy""), but the Cribs prove themselves worthy successors to a lineage of cheekily erudite Britpop that spans David Bowie (see: the ""Rock 'n' Roll Suicide"" sway of ""Stick to Yr Guns"") through to the Smiths ( the ""Panic""-style swing of the title track) to Pulp (the rather excellent ""We Share the Same Skies"", a shot of organ-swathed jangle-pop urgency would fit snugly on His 'n' Hers). And in the jubilant Jam-ready rocker ""Victim of Mass Production"", the Cribs seem to finally accept their status as a pop commodity beholden to the ""powers that be."" They might never acquire the iconoclastic cool of a Sonic Youth, but a Top 10 fate is certainly one they can live with, because, as the Jarmans sing in unison, ""we're not supposed to be here anyway.""","Smiths guitar hero Johnny Marr joins one of the brightest lights of post-Libertines UK rock for their fourth album.

Before I Self Destruct,50 Cent,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a739c0084474cd0c0b3a/1:1/w_160/6fd56c76.jpg,2009-11-16 06:00:02,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13700-before-i-self-destruct/,Interscope,"So I bought The 50th Law. Like most non-musical projects involving 50 Cent, his co-authored book of Machiavellian strategy stood a good chance at being mindlessly entertaining, and fuck-- I wouldn't mind being as rich as he is. Surely, I'd learn some sort of hustling tactic that would allow me to make back my $20 and then some. It held up its end of the bargain on the first part, but amidst the surprisingly practical advice and hilariously revisionist history (a staged thrashing of an Interscope office is remembered as a PR coup for Curtis. Kanye West isn't mentioned once in the book), there was little insight to 50's music-making process. The ""50th law"" essentially lionizes fearlessness and a deep connection with the public, qualities almost entirely absent from his last two albums-- Curtis sounded a hell of a lot like a rap record made by a guy who lives in a Connecticut mansion, while the profoundly bored War Angel LP only served as proof of how the mixtape game he revolutionized had completely passed him by. But 50's nothing if not calculating, and while Before I Self Destruct might not be designed to reach the pretty impressive first week sales of Curtis, it may be a wiser move making it to appeal to listener who still might be rooting for the guy.  In other words, the sort of guy who thought ""Blood Hound"" and ""Back Down"" were by far the best tracks from Get Rich  or Die Tryin'. It's transparent pandering on the level of ""Amusement Park"", but the difference is that 50 still can rap convincingly about his financial power moves whereas every bit of sexual pursuit simply bores him to death-- he can't even really make a love song about his guns these days (see ""Hold Me Down""). He's still got that voice, and when he wants, it can still intoxicate and overwhelm with sheer menace. ""The Invitation"" and ""Death to My Enemies"" snarl with a ferocity that's refreshing in the context of 50's recent output as well as the current hip-pop landscape where meat'n'potatoes gangsta is actually kinda novel. He disarmingly sings along with the Jackson 5 sample that begins ""Then Days Went By"" before reshaping his ""Hate It or Love It"" verse into a squalid blaxploitation that makes you think he'd view Precious as a comedy. There's the part where a trip to the South turns into a murder spree and he pistol-whips his drug-addled uncle, but it's his staggering anti-romance that provides the most creepy shock: ""she was 20, I was 12/ Nana said she raped me/ I just smiled ear to ear saying 'take it, baby, take it.'"" As good as the ruffneck stuff generally is, he's way more entertaining when he's fucking around with people. On that note, ""So Disrespectful"" is the most successful track, in that it'll be the one that gets talked about. We can argue about the moral implications of using other people's serious problems as comic fodder, but 50 has no such use for that. He starts off using the Game's claims of sexual molestation against him and just goes from there, railing on anonymous hangers-on and, most comprehensively, former ally Young Buck: ""tell momma he done smoked the TV/ I ain't know he fucked with more dope than B.G."" * * A production team including Dr. Dre,  Rick Rock, and Polow Da Don ensure that the cold and clinical Aftermath sonic architecture constantly allows Before to reek of amorality and fuck-you money. It's apt since you could make the argument that Before is something of a concept album portraying human relations in purely transactional terms-- it's not called a ""social contract"" for nothing. There's genuine hurt residing deep within a lot of the tracks here, but nearly every time, it's rendered financially and finds 50 going from playful to extremely bitter as the album goes on. Regarding the dissolution of G-Unit, he jokes ""keeping these motherfuckers rich ain't easy,"" but later, ""Strong Enough"" becomes one of the angriest tracks he's done in years. On ""So Disrespectful"", even his absentee father is seen as a drain on his bank account: ""I don't even know him/ So now the fuck I owe him?"" If there's any line that could serve as Before's thesis statement, it's this song's closer: ""Enemies stay enemies/ But friends they change/ Niggas go crazy over money."" But the fun of talking about the record overstates its actual quality. After initially promising a return to form, 50 doesn't have the ability or initiative to hold the listener's interest over the long run. The middle bogs down in post-2001 Aftermath muddle and by the second half, he's back trying to make would-be hits again without the inevitability. It's almost like even he's unsure of his hitmaking abilities, and in a weird way, that sorta softens him. But who really wants that?

Suitcase 3: Up We Go Now,Guided by Voices,by: Paul Thompson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a725c0084474cd0c0b14/1:1/w_160/b7e8c7ac.jpg,2009-11-16 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13681-suitcase-3-up-we-go-now/,"Guided By Voices, Inc.","There are just some bands whose output is so staggering in terms of both quantity and quality-- the Mountain Goats, say-- that sometimes you just want to load up the catalogue, close your eyes, hit shuffle, and let somebody else decide for you. Then, of course, there's Robert Pollard. With his Boston Spaceships and at least one fine solo offering, Bob's been having a kickass 2009. But you're forgiven if you're still poring over his even more kickass 1993; there's simply so much to listen to, and more all the time. Take, for instance, Suitcase 3, Pollard's latest 100-song foray into the mythical valise-cum-vault that contains Pollard's unreleased material. These Suitcase sets, obviously, have been mixed bags, flitting between fidelities and vintages and bit players with little rhyme or reason and with even less consistency than your typical Pollard 28-songer. The third time out's much the same, with 75 cuts seemingly chosen and arranged at random (credited, in trademark Pollard style, to fake bands with names like Kelsey Boo Flip, Heartthrob Johnson Firestone, Erotic Zip Codes and the like) followed by an off-the-cuff demo session from the particulary fertile Bee Thousand/Alien Lanes era. It's a neat trick, really, doing it this way; though the first three-quarters of the set will almost instantly be relegated into every Bob fan's random shuffle, the last disc's total fanperson catnip, the basement of Indie Rock Valhalla, that sort of thing. At least on paper. It's true that going through the first three discs of Suitcase 3 front-to-back isn't too far off from typing Guided by Voices into the search bar in iTunes and just letting it fly, for a couple reasons: jumping from a filthy Vampire on Titus track to a frothy Do the Collapse and almost everything changes: sonics, approach to hooks, song length, and personnel. There's no organizing principle that I can discern in Suitcase 3; a beat-up little banger from the early days sits next to stately late-era sweep, and back-and-forth it goes. There's an emphasis on the gnarly yet hooky mid-90s stuff, and even a few all-too-fleeting nods to the era; ""Coastal Town"" shares a few moves with Alien Lanes' ""Closer You Are"" and ""Old Engine Driver"" is a slightly different spin on ""Hey Aardvark"" from the sorta-classic Static Airplane Jive EP. You get drunken, silly Pollard (""You Gotta Lotta Nerve""), stoner metalworker Pollard (""Psychlophobia""), not-taking-more-time-to-record-this-than-it-did-to-write Pollard (""Take Me Back"", among so many others); all the Pollards, really. But even if one focuses on the good stuff, the sheer volume of this thing means that these first three discs to overwhelm. Something like ""Janet Wait"", a ruddy, barely-hanging-on ballad, is as fucking sad and gorgeous a drunk's lament as this guy's ever given us (no, really). It's just a shame it'd be so easy to miss, floating in a sea of middling half-sketches and neural misfires here. I mean, were the suitcase being used for its intended purpose, at this point we'd be down to black socks and sandals, and maybe that emergency bathing suit. Which I reckon goes some way toward explaining why the fourth disc falls far short of expectations. The very existence of a bunch of unheard demos from the pinnacle of one of indie rock's greatest bands seems the equivalent of a Gary Young version of Crooked Rain, Crooked Rain or something. What if there's another ""Echos Myron"" waiting in the wings? But Bob's been through this stuff a few times already, so if it was really something to hear, we probably would've heard it. And, as it turns out, these sessions really couldn't be more off-the-cuff. Everybody seems a little drunk and a lot worn out, several songs don't even attempt an ending, and at one point someone wanders down to the basement to chatter as the tape rolls. Sure, there's at least one great scrap of Pollardiania to be had-- the acoustic intro to ""Tractor Rape Chain"" is here, in full, as ""South Rat Observatory""-- but there's also more than enough long stretches of random strumming and Bob grasping for lyrical straws. The last bit of Suitcase does offer some insights into Pollard's process-- turns out, for all the jokes, the guy's not exactly shitting gold, nor was he ever-- but once the voyeuristic glee of being a fly on the wall while a bunch of cool dudes get loaded and write some rock songs wear off, you're not left with a whole lot. That is, until you start moving things around. The first three discs of Suitcase suffer from a lack of cohesion; the fourth, from far too much of it. Mix it up a little bit more, though, and you've got playlist padding and mixtape fodder and shuffly stuff for days. That relatively little of it could stand next to Bob's best isn't really the point; this is the bottom of the baggage, so to speak, and its far-flung nature and relative lack of quality control make it one just for the superfans. But that lot's hardly going to mind 100 new and newish GBV jams to have and hold in their own vaults. When you really need it, it's good to have a little extra on hand.","The third 100-song vault-clearing contains unheard demos from Guided by Voices' classic mid-90s era.

No Ceilings,Lil Wayne,by: Tom Breihan,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a7169d034d5c69bf36e5/1:1/w_160/d122ae90.jpg,2009-11-16 06:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13672-no-ceilings/,Young Money Entertainment,"No Ceilings. Nice title. Nice concept, too. Here's Wayne explaining it, on one of his new mixtape's blessedly few skits: ""I would love for you to look up into the building and understand that there is no ceilings; there is only the sky."" And in his case, it's true; Wayne's potential greatness seems to have no limit-- or if it does have a limit, it's difficult to say what it might be. Wayne's tough to evaluate because he's so very rarely operating at peak capacity. Whereas a classically great rapper (Ready to Die-era Biggie, say) might hammer his concepts straight on until he's bludgeoned them into atoms, Wayne barely ever has any concepts, hopscotching frantically but lazily between ideas and chasing digressions down gopher holes. Wayne's digressive, distracted spirit is a huge part of what makes him great; even at his Carter II peak, he was always slippery and unpredictable and defiantly weird. But ever since he indisputably became the most popular rapper in the world last year, he's been in a strange zone, trusting his instincts to the point where he's now preparing to drop a whole album of somebody's idea of rock on us. And his instincts are, more often than not, bad. Add that to his purportedly staggering drug use and his upcoming prison sentence, and it's tough to tell just how far he could fall. Wayne's got no ceilings, but he's got no floors either. And given the increasingly scattered nature of his post-Carter III work, the existence of No Ceilings is just a tremendous relief. After last year's wildly disappointing Dedication 3, Wayne's finally back to something like his Dedication 2/Drought 3 fighting shape and doing what he does best, swiping beats from all the songs on rap radio and rendering the originals obsolete. Pity F.L.Y. and Dorrough after what Wayne did to ""Swag Surfin'"" and ""Ice Cream Paint Job"". Beats like those are where Wayne traditionally comes off best; those cheap, tense, springy synthetic tracks make Wayne's berserk rasp sound something like catharsis. Wayne's got no compunctions about snatching up a middling regional dance-rap mini-hit, and that appetite serves him well. When you throw him on something busier and bigger-budget like Jay-Z's ""D.O.A."" or ""Run This Town"", he doesn't sound quite as at home. So it's fortunate that Wayne still has a bug up his ass about Jay. On those two tracks, he just goes absolutely ripshit, throwing slick subliminals at Jay or just laughing Jay's barbs off. At least on mixtapes, Wayne doesn't have Jay's drive to build eternal monuments to his own importance; he's free to just spazz out. So, on ""Run This Town"": ""New Orleans Coroner, his name is Frank Minyard/ Fuck with me wrong, you'll be waking up in his yard."" (A Google search confirms that New Orleans' Coroner is indeed named Frank Minyard. Wayne: Backing up his insane threats with verifiable facts!) In some intriguing ways, the rise of Gucci Mane presents an interesting challenge to this sort of Wayne mixtape. Gucci represents an evolution of Wayne's free-associative style, one simultaneously spacier and more focused. Gucci has none of Wayne's cursory desire for acceptance from NY true-schoolers, and he favors the kind of dinky, catchy budget beats that Wayne loves stealing on tapes like these. Wayne raps over three Gucci tracks on No Ceilings, as well as one from Gucci associate Waka Flocka, but he doesn't treat these tracks like challenges the way he does with the Jay songs. He probably should, since the Gucci songs are the rare mixtape tracks where Wayne can't erase the memory of the originals. And No Ceilings certainly has its problems. Wayne might never again sound as flat-out committed as he did on Dedication 2. His punchlines don't always carry the same impact, and he's more likely to laugh at his own jokes. He shares valuable mic time with tolerable nonentities like Lucci Lou and Gudda Gudda. He picks a few tracks like the Black Eyed Peas' ""I Gotta Feeling"", songs that just aren't conducive to great rapping. He swipes a few terrible sex-rap tracks and makes slightly less terrible sex-rap tracks out of them, though even those will dependably include a few appealingly loony lines (""I get it wetter than bass pussy"" is supposed to be seductive?). He's not quite the animal he was. But No Ceilings once again finds Wayne in total control of beats, motivated and sliding freely between ideas. He pronounces ""alps"" and ""stealth"" and ""milf"" like they all rhyme with each other. He's scatological: ""I'm on some shit ain't even been out the ass yet."" He's haughty: ""Elevator in my crib cause it's five floors/ I'm not expecting you to have one inside yours."" He's on his half-sensical pop culture shit: ""I get big chips; you get Alvins."" He's capable of coming up with lines that get stuck in your head for no conceivable reason: ""I'm flyer than the highest flying bird around this ho."" He's frankly disgusting: ""I made the pussy gleek."" And with the twin trials of prison and Rebirth looming, it's just enormously gratifying to hear that he still knows how to rap, that he loves doing it. After all, nobody does it like him.","Weezy returns to mixtape form, where he shows off his digressive, distracted spirit-- still a huge part of what makes him great.

Waiting For You,King Midas Sound,by: Nate Patrin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6cdea9e61561daa5447/1:1/w_160/6dfa66ed.jpg,2009-11-13 06:00:04,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13616-waiting-for-you/,Hyperdub,"The Bug's London Zoo aged well over the past year: It still stands as one of the more exciting albums of 2008, a roots-heavy dubstep/dancehall crossover with rib-cracking rhythms and an amazing guest roster of singers and toasters that stands as a remarkably distinctive collection of voices. But there was a surprise harbinger in that album, a song that my original review actually completely overlooked due to-- or maybe despite-- a stripped-down, ambient eeriness that offset the rest of the album's aggro-beat feel. That song was ""You & Me"", a strikingly delicate yet powerful collaboration with the soft-voiced singer/poet Roger Robinson. And about three months after London Zoo dropped, the creative partnership of Robinson and producer Kevin Martin brought forth a deservedly lauded single under the name King Midas Sound: the ghostly ""Cool Out"", which rivaled the best of Burial when it came to the more desolate corners of dubstep. One year later, ""Cool Out"" has reemerged as the lead track off the first King Midas Sound full-length, and it's retained its impact-- assuming you can refer to the feeling of becoming slowly enveloped in abandoned-high-rise ambiance and serenaded by quivering, sweetly voiced murmurs as an impact. It also stands as one of the highlights of Waiting for You, or at least one of the most chilling moments; the fact that this album can conflate the two is a sure sign of where it's coming from. Every strength this record holds draws off the symbiotic relationship between Martin's beats and Robinson's voice, which adapt to each other in a way that the last two people in a barren environment might. This is dub production rendered as the final reverberations of a deserted cityscape, infused with a crumbling low-end that does for bass what a single fluorescent tube in an underground concrete tunnel does for light. And the voice decorates it like a spiderweb-- fragile in appearance, but structurally resilient enough to hold strong against the rhythm. Robinson's singing sells his idea of zero-gravity lovers' rock like a champ, filling in the evocative cracks that his mostly straightforward lyrics don't do much to cover. The title track's lovesick sentiments are familiar, but there's this pang to his voice-- a bit disbelieving, bitter, hopeful and agonized all at once-- that holds the deeper meaning. And he's just as powerful on the other songs where he's called upon to invoke that lonely brooding atmosphere-- ""One Ting"" (sonically bleaker than the nano-orchestral lavishness of Dabrye's remix from the ""Cool Out"" 12""); the misty-eyed take-me-back begging of ""Darlin'""; ""Meltdown"" and its heavy-sighing pleads for intimacy. Robinson does have an intriguing vocal counterpart on a few tracks in the person of Dokkeki Q member Kiki Hitomi, at her ethereally malicious best on ""Goodbye Girl"" delivering spiteful reprimands and Elvis Costello quotes with a scalpel's agility (""I wish you pain 'til you can't ever feel joy/ I wish you luck with a capital F, boy""). But the more remote and abandoned Robinson's aching voice sounds, the heavier it hits. Not all of Waiting for You has that same ambiance, though it rarely rises above the level of a soft rumble. Martin's production forgoes the stereotypical dubstep war of bassbin attrition to let the beats glow instead of flash, and even when it approaches an actual heavy knock-- like the underwater dancehall bump of ""Outta Space"" or the smothered Mantronix boom-clap of ""I Man""-- it still resembles the starker moments of *Mezzanine-*era Massive Attack more than it does something along the lines of Bug tracks like ""Skeng"" or ""Warning"". Still, a little something is lost when things digress from the cutting isolation that made ""Cool Out"" work, especially when Robinson breaks from his singing to issue scoffing spoken-word holistic reprimands on ""Earth a Kill Ya""-- a decent bit of preaching with a heavy scowl of a beat beneath, but oddly harsh and self-assured on a record that thrives on sounding vulnerable.","With stripped-down, ambient eeriness, the debut LP from this dubstep/dancehall crossover is like a mirror image of the Bug's London Zoo.

Rock is Dodelijk,Brakes,by: Paul Thompson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a736b1335d7bf1698fd9/1:1/w_160/cc3cda64.jpg,2009-11-13 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13698-rock-is-dodelijk/,Fat Cat,"The going rate to get into a Brakes concert-- Stateside anyhow, where they're known as BrakesBrakesBrakes-- is within a coupla bucks of what you might pay for the Brighton foursome's new live set, Rock Is Dodelijk. In an era when everything's preserved for posterity within a few minutes of it happening, the live album seems a particularly antiquated artifact, despite the prevalence of the things in the marketplace (this is, after all, not the only live record Pitchfork is reviewing today). Rock in Dodelijk, however, avoids a lot of what makes the live album seem superfluous, thanks to the band's breathless, ripchord performance and the set's searing up-front sound. Dodelijk blasts off with the snidely whiplash of ""Hi How Are You?"", that great bite-sized kiss off from the band's 2005 debut, Give Blood. It's a perfect attention-grabber, and Brakes knock out all its right angles with aplomb. Brakes trade in the kind of zippy, word-forward, world-weary Britrock of Arctic Monkeys or Art Brut, almost unfailingly sarcastic, as much about inflection as the words spewing from singer Eamon Hamilton's mouth. As such, a live album's a trickier proposition for Brakes than most, as the post-punky precision of the music and all that shit Hamilton talks have to fall in line just so for the whole thing to work. But Brakes have that covered-- they sound beefier here than on record, with some of the nervous energy from the studio converted into pure heft onstage. Lead guitarist Tom White, in particular, lets loose with some billowy solos given far more room to unfurl in front of the audience. As they slide from one tune to another, hardly a scrap of banter or even a few seconds' respite to be had, Brakes' blinders-on, frills-free rock feels taut, terse, and immediate; Dodelijk might be culled from a couple of different shows, each at least six months old, but it sounds a lot more like last night's PA mix still rattling around in your head. Kudos to producers Paul Savage and Ric Peet, who, by minimizing crowd noise and pushing Hamilton way up front, lend this thing a real immediacy. The setlist largely sticks to tunes from their first and still best album, Give Blood, and it's here we find our highlights: silly little country ditty ""NY Pie"", name-drop nose-turner ""Heard About Your Band"", single-that-wasn't ""What's in It For Me?"" As with their studio sets, punky thrashabouts sit comfortably next to twangy tear-in-my-many-beers ditties. The already apparent holes in some of the Brakes' tunes, which at their worst can seem little more than a stutter from Hamilton and a steady scrape from the band, do pop up occasionally; then again, they rarely overstay their welcome, as Dodelijk sneaks 20 tunes into just shy of 45 minutes, and in a way even help the good stuff kick harder in contrast.","Brighton rockers offer a breathless, ripchord performance on this new live disc.

Flashmob,Vitalic,by: Jess Harvell,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a73e13d197565213937d/1:1/w_160/f4c7fce0.jpg,2009-11-13 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13704-flashmob/,PIAS,"Few 21st-century house/techno tracks have proven as oddly influential as Vitalic's 2001 ""La Rock"" and ""Poney Part 1"". Released when microhouse's delicate sound-sculpting was being touted as dance music's future, and strangely first claimed by electroclash fans during that trend's brief and ignoble peak, Vitalic offered speaker-frying synth-riffs (or sometimes just synth-squeals) to scare off wannabe aesthetes and IDM refugees, reaffirming the productive struggle in post-acid dance between funk and floor-clearing noise. But as ""Poney Part 1"" and ""La Rock"" reared their ugly heads again and again, showing up on one compilation after another during the next three years with little new Vitalic material in sight, fans who valued humor and nuance as much as focused brutality may have wondered if producer Pascal Arbez had exhausted his one distortion-drenched trick. So it probably helped Vitalic's long-term career prospects that his 2005 debut album, OK Cowboy, included enough oddities (like ""Wooo"", with John Carpenter subbing for the oompah band at a local polka night) and slow jams (like ""The Past"", a rare non-unctuous trawl through 1980s synth-pop romanticism) to keep John and Jane Doe from tuning out after the 10th consecutive helping of fuck-you. Which is not to say Monsieur Arbez wussed out in the name of crossing over. The fearsome ""Poney""-alikes far outweighed the goofball interludes, and if he'd released his second LP 12 months later, his rep as middlebrow dance music's premier scourge would have been secured. Instead, another three years passed between OKC and Flashmob, a period during which a horde of noisy, uncouth producers (many of them fellow Frenchmen in the Ed Banger orbit) popped up, turning overblown feedback and digital grime into exhausting shtick in record time. With the landscape glutted with punk-dance nobodies, Vitalic's mission-- to create deranged, over-the-top dance music that nonetheless honors disco's body-moving tradition-- became that much harder. If he succeeds, and Flashmob proves that he does, it's because Vitalic's best productions have a near-psychedelic sweep, a sensuous appreciation for the way he can overlap often grating textures until they become both beguiling and disorienting, while so many of his contemporaries are happy to strangle the details right out of their tracks with volume. Even if he's unerringly loud, his weakness for buzzsaw mid-range obliterating the dub-influenced sense of space you hear in the best minimal and deep house, Vitalic offers sublime, spaced-out moments as crucial punctuation in even his least compromising tracks. Opener ""See the Sea (Red)"" is undeniably dominated by the fat, fuzzed-out riff that takes the place of a traditional bassline, but Arbez knows said riff will flatten listeners all the harder when it rears back up after a twinkly, almost Kompakt-ian breakdown. Justice, by contrast, would just let the riff build and build until you're begging for relief that never comes. Arbez obviously appreciates this no-mercy approach, but realizes that what's effective on a lone 12"" gets wearying when repeated a dozen times in an hour. This contrast-- between short moments of catch-your-breath beauty and the violence of riffs on the edge of pure noise-- has proven to be Vitalic's greatest weapon. Perhaps that's why Flashmob's slower, more even-keeled tracks feel like filler. Necessary filler, but nonetheless. ""Poison Lips"" is fine as post-Italo/hi-NRG pastiche goes, but it's too streamlined, too emotionally flat to feel like anything other than an interlude that got out of hand. Ditto ""Allan Dellon"" and its slow-motion electro-house, where Vitalic proves he can do straight-up, classically synth-driven beauty well enough, while lacking the melodrama of Flashmob's obvious highs. But you also sense that Arbez knows these tracks are glorified breathers, and has sequenced the album very carefully. For instance, following the relatively low-key and carefully sculpted vocoders of ""See the Sea (Blue)"" with ""Chicken Lady"", Flashmob's most unrepentantly thuggish moment-- three minutes of Arbez dragging his knuckles around his studio as his melody-spurning machines groan and growl. Taken individually, neither is a jaw-dropper, but in tandem they mimic the one-two punch of his best work. Little of Flashmob could be described as ""tender,"" or even traditionally catchy, but Arbez has enough of a pop instinct to know that drama results only from careful pacing. He also knows that when you're making big, potentially dumb, and definitely unruly dance music, a sense of humor and a lack of pretension is crucial. It's hard not to laugh when a robot tells you, ""This is your disco song, made for you, for those rain days, to chase the shadows away,"" over a backdrop of mock-menacing see-sawing synth-grind. That's why the best track here is ""Terminateur Benelux""; it squeezes everything Vitalic does well into four minutes, a summary of Flashmob's well-crafted, winking brutalism and my pick for a single-serving download for the curious. It's hilarious and a little terrifying all at once, an unhinged homage to early-90s hardcore rave, with a clattering quasi-breakbeat that sounds like it's agitated itself into a fit, sampled ""woo!""s and ""ah-ha!""s straight off a 2 Bad Mice single, and the kind of freaky Belgian techno drone-riff that's probably ground zero for Vitalic's sonic signature. Listening, you don't know whether to giggle, run for cover, or start breakdancing. Like those first-wave rave producers, Arbez wants to have it all: to make listeners smile, shake their shit, and still walk away a little shaken by the music's intensity. Flashmob pulls off this near-impossible combo with more skill than even Vitalic's fans may have expected.","The influential dance artist unveils his second act-- and first after blog house producers turned overblown feedback and digital grime into exhausting shtick.

Get Yer Ya-Ya's Out! The Rolling Stones in Concert [40th Anniversary Deluxe Box Set],The Rolling Stones,by: Joshua Love,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a719c0084474cd0c0af6/1:1/w_160/e482d339.jpg,2009-11-13 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13675-get-yer-ya-yas-out-the-rolling-stones-in-concert-40th-anniversary-deluxe-box-set/,ABKCO,"If the Rolling Stones really were the World's Greatest Rock and Roll Band for the better part of the 1960s and 70s, then surely somewhere along the line they must've released one of the great live albums of all time too, right? This rationale is the only way I can account for the fact that the Stones' best-regarded live release, 1970's definitely pleasurable but less-than-transcendent Get Yer Ya-Ya's Out!, routinely places highly on lists of the best concert documents in rock history. It feels like the kind of perfunctory acknowledgment that virtually all of the other typically high-ranking sets (for instance, Neil Young's Live Rust, the Who's Live at Leeds, and the Allman Brothers Band's At Fillmore East) don't need, seeing as how they're genuinely awesome. Live performance never seemed as intrinsic to the Rolling Stones' essence as it did for most of 60s and 70s rock's other heavy hitters. Sure, as soon as playing basketball arenas became a viable rock-star option the always-avaricious Stones rushed to embrace the financial potentialities, but the group's music never cultivated the kind of epic, transformative breadth that best fills an enormous space like Madison Square Garden, where Ya-Ya's was recorded. Big venues demand that everything else be larger than life as well, but outsized song lengths (think the Grateful Dead, Allmans, Led Zep), outsized emotions (the Who, U2), and outsized spectacle (KISS, David Bowie) have never been indispensable components of the Stones' music. It's not for nothing that some of the band's most cherished officially sanctioned live work happens to be the El Mocambo club stuff from 1977's Love You Live as well as 1995's intimate Stripped. Nonetheless, Ya-Ya's persists as the Stones' go-to concert recording, so it's hardly a surprise to see the band now putting out a deluxe, 3xCD/DVD reissue of the two-night event. Unfortunately, as a purchasable product, this $60-retailing set ($41.99 on Amazon) is damn near felonious. Disc One is the original album itself, remastered, though keep in mind it was already given the SACD treatment in 2002. Disc Two is a grand total of five tracks-- recordings of the tracks the Stones played those two nights that didn't make the album proper. Disc Three is material from opening acts B.B. King and Ike and Tina Turner, and ironically enough it may the part of the box that's most worth getting excited about-- particularly the devastating way Tina digs into Otis Redding's classic ""I've Been Loving You Too Long"". Disc Four is a DVD, which seems pretty enticing until you realize it only captures performances of the same five songs that were on Disc Two. Why, at the very least, a disc couldn't have been assembled that put the songs in the order in which they were actually originally played is beyond me. Now, by denigrating this Ya-Ya's reissue as a commodity and by questioning the album's canonization in general, I don't mean to imply this set doesn't cook. Even if it's not larded with 20-minute workouts, Ya-Ya's is manna for guitar freaks, thanks to the fiery interplay between the immortal Keith Richards and inarguably the greatest lead guitarist the Stones ever boasted, Mick Taylor. ""Under My Thumb"" and ""Live with Me"" feature wondrously rejiggered riffs, while ""Love in Vain"", ""Street Fighting Man"", and ""Sympathy for the Devil"" soar with brilliant solos (two solos in the case of ""Sympathy""). Rhythmically, the whole set (aside from a two-song acoustic blues interlude) coagulates into one long, sweaty, irresistible throb. All that said, the fault for Ya-Ya's falling just short of the Pantheon must then lie at the feet of Mick Jagger. In the studio, Jagger has always had time and takes to work a wealth of subtle ironic nuances into his readings, but Madison Square Garden isn't the place for nuance. As the Stones became less sexy and stylish in the 80s, Jagger's routine grew more goofily athletic, and the gigantic football stadiums the band preferred were perfect conduits for his crowd-pleasing mugging and gymnastics. In 1969, however, image and venue failed to mesh, and Jagger just seems to lack fire and imagination, aside from lasciviously dropping the age of the sexually uncaged teenage girl in ""Stray Cat Blues"" from Beggars Banquet's 15 to the Roman Polanski-approved 13. For the most part, however, Jagger fails to recognize that this was the band's moment, and that unawareness of Ya-Ya's epochal promise is the primary thing that keeps the album from truly belonging alongside the preeminent aural snapshots in rock history.","The Rolling Stones' go-to-by-default big live album gets a remastering job, but also an odd multi-disc treatment.

iTunes Originals,Yeah Yeah Yeahs,by: Jessica Suarez,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6f29d034d5c69bf3682/1:1/w_160/a8910a2f.jpg,2009-11-13 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13646-itunes-originals/,DGC,"In 2000, Karen O, a Tisch transfer student, was as self-assured as any newly-minted New Yorker. So she and guitarist Nick Zinner thought of a band name and a logo before they had written any songs, as they reveal on one of this album's interview tracks. After they'd written some (very good) songs, their reputations-- Nick Zinner's cool, Karen O's beer-soaked bravado-- still preceded their records. But then YYYs released ""Maps"". Then they became less fashionable but no less good. And they matured, even before Karen O did the most New York thing of all: move to L.A. This iTunes collection spans from their first EP to Its Blitz!, and it shows a band willing to adapt and change without regrets or nostalgia for its past. That YYYs are ready to have a greatest hits album pangs their older fans more than the band themselves. They don't hate getting older, or ever being that young. That's most apparent from their choices and interviews here, beginning with an acoustic version of their debut EP's ""Our Time"". Abrupt and bluesy, clunky and amateur, it's also got a swagger that none of their subsequent songs matches-- not that the band wants them to. By their debut LP, YYYs were already a different band. ""I was feeling a little bit more aversion to the more rockish, noisy, kinda histrionic vocals, because I wasn't relating to it as a 27-year-old or 26-year-old as well as I did when I was 21 or 22,"" Karen O explained to Pitchfork in an interview. ""And I felt like the angst fizzled out when we were writing this album, and it was more kinda like a brewing sort of... I don't know what it was."" So ""Our Time""'s makeover is YYYs' makeover. Three of the five acoustic versions are from It's Blitz: ""Runaway"", which Karen describes as ""epic"" in one of the iTunes interviews, melts into a torch song, while ""Hysteric"" takes on a spacious, ponderous quality that its spare melody barely supports. Breaking from the cliché of the solemn acoustic version, It's Blitz!'s ""Dull Life"" becomes an even better stomper, one that, as Karen O says in her interview still has ""that YYYs energy."" The interview portions are far too short, and even shorter than you think, since the band hem when explaining their songs. Karen O ends her answers in a trailing, adolescent ""so...."" But what's fascinating is their phrase ""that YYYs energy."" This attitude is exactly what's kept them sane, and kept them good. Since YYYs define themselves not in terms of a particular sound or instrumentation, but rather ""energies,"" the supposed leaps they've made-- from sweaty punk band to doe-eyed balladeers to electronic pied pipers-- really seem like iterations of the same band, different outfits on the same body. This may be what they mean when they hope to be, ""bigger than the sound,"" as Karen O sings on their rousing ""Cheated Hearts"" (here in its original form). Other songs (""Y Control"", ""Gold Lion"", ""Down Boy"", ""Heads Will Roll"") appear in their original versions. Their best song here and everywhere else, is still ""Maps"", a song that's come to stand for YYYs in a way that transcends even a ""signature song""--more than a hit, it's bound to the band DNA. They back up Zinner's acoustic guitar with violins as they did for their Radio City Music Hall gig. Writing it was, as Karen O says, ""a moment in time for us."" A ""moment in time"" for them, for their fans. But this collection includes YYYs singles too familiar to be worth re-purchasing. As Tom Breihan said, all the acoustic versions can be purchased separately via iTunes for $5.25. When you price music by the song, you start to think cost per track; and in this case the product only justifies the price if this is your first YYYs album. Ever. That said, the interviews are worth it, though the band can't talk about themselves for any length. You really do have to marvel at Karen O, though. In her 2005 interview with The Believer, she said, ""I'm fully putting myself out there for the people and for the sake of trying to lure them into the experience and out of... detachment."" It's the sort of platitude you expect from a front woman of Karen O's consummate skill and charisma, and yet it's her sheer ability as a communicator and perpetual optimist that is the real source of YYYs ""energy.""","This iTunes collection spans YYYs' whole career, and it shows a band willing to adapt and change without regrets or nostalgia for its past.

Dog Poison,Thee Oh Sees,by: David Raposa,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a72e9d034d5c69bf371d/1:1/w_160/e8ae7699.jpg,2009-11-12 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13691-dog-poison/,Captured Tracks,"Here's what Thee Oh Sees have given the world in 2009 to date: six singles (three of their own, three split with pals), one demo collection, and, oh yeah, two LPs. (There are six weeks left on the calendar, which might give them time to cut a few more tracks and maybe record and release a couple dozen live sets.) This flurry of activity comes on the heels of a comparatively sedate 2008, which saw the group push out one measly studio full-length, one LP of the live persuasion, one and a half EPs, and just the one single. Suffice it to say that whatever caffeine-laced tall boys and/or illicit recreational substances John Dwyer has been (ab)using since adding an extra E to his band's name, they are most definitely working. Thee Oh Sees' Nuggets-friendly aesthetic could very easily wear itself thin, but Dwyer and friends have found plenty of ways to keep that formula from falling flat. The group's first full-length offering this year, Help, is the apotheosis of what Thee Oh Sees can do as a rock group-- namely, kick out jams that pack a thick and brutal punch while offering a softer, poppier, and not-so-mildly psychedelic side at the same time. If the group rolled their joints on the sleeve of a first-edition copy of Black Monk Time, and took slugs of moonshine from the 13th Floor Elevators' electric jug (unplugged, of course), it wouldn't come as a surprise. And while they couldn't be blamed if they simply opted to offer more Help on their second 2009 LP, it's to their credit that they upset that particular apple cart, among many others, on Dog Poison. If it were approached from a different angle, a song like album opener ""The River Rushes (To Screw MD Over)"" might not have sounded out of place on Dog Poison's predecessor. But by switching to an acoustic guitar and letting the flute player channel Ian Anderson, Thee Oh Sees give their sound a new wrinkle. Indeed, with Dwyer copping a few vocal moves from Mark E. Smith, ""River"" ends up sounding a little like the Fall covering the Kinks. There's another, purer, Kinks-like turn on Dog Poison, with the loping high-pitched tra-la-las of ""The Sun Goes All Around"" sounding like something left on the cutting room floor from Village Green Preservation Society. Elsewhere on the album, the group emulates the cavernous, smoky gait of Deerhunter (""Head of State""), shambles in a folkier fashion (""Fake Song""), spaces out a bit (""Dead Energy""), and mostly just lets it all hang out over the course of this LP's 24 minutes. Even when they decide to rock out, like on the appropriately titled ""The Fizz"", Thee Oh Sees sound footloose and fancy-free. Or ""sloppy,"" if you prefer-- in terms of sound and vibe, this record has more in common with Zork's Tape Bruise (the aforementioned demo collection) than either of the last two ""real"" Thee Oh Sees LPs, with a not-unwelcome what-the-fuck yeah-more-flute attitude taken to how the songs get put together. But instead of damning this as an uninspired odds-and-sods mishmash, I'd rather think of Dog Poison as the band officially unwinding from the (relatively) exacting precision of Help, and cleansing their own palette in preparation for what's next. After all, given how John Dwyer seems to operate, it wouldn't surprise me if he'd take a relaxing break from making music by simply making more music.","The hyper-prolific garage-rockers manage to put a few new spins on their familiar formula.

Belly of the Lion,Ola Podrida,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a7265e6ef95969320ee5/1:1/w_160/b1c6556c.jpg,2009-11-12 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13682-belly-of-the-lion/,Western Vinyl,"David Wingo is better known as a soundtrack composer than as a songwriter, and you may have heard his music already in most of David Gordon Green's films or in the new Jared Hess mess, Gentlemen Broncos. Yet, as Ola Podrida, he emphasizes lyrics and music equally, using each to evoke what the other cannot express. Ola Podrida may bear some similarities to groups like Band of Horses and My Morning Jacket-- in the expansiveness and Americana textures of his songs-- but his second album, Belly of the Lion, is unlikely to get fists pumping or crowds surging: Wingo is a strong live performer, but his music remains private rather than public, introverted rather than outgoing. He projects these songs inward, creating a record that is quietly cinematic. Belly of the Lion is more compact than Ola Podrida's 2007 self-titled debut, which means it is sharper, shapelier, and only slightly less substantial. Lyrically, the themes are identical: Every silver lining has a dark cloud, and relationships of any kind-- whether romantic, familial, or social-- are fraught with the potential for loss. What makes them especially affecting is their specificity: Wingo fills these songs with concrete nouns, proper names, and crystalline details, effectively rooting them in a real and recognizable world. ""Your Father's Basement"" imbues its coming-of-age story with a certain vérité, as two teenage boys blast Eric B. & Rakim and look for dirty mags behind the water heater, while the music crests into an uncertain conclusion that lends magnitude to their adolescent conspiracy. Elsewhere, Wingo's guitar shimmers as ""Lakes of Wine"" pans across a tableau of mysteriously related images: a notebook found on the side of the road, a phone number scrawled on a bathroom stall. There's nothing out of the ordinary here, yet Wingo invests each carefully selected object with symbolic weight. And yet, these lyrics would have much less power without the music. Wingo recorded Belly of the Lion in his apartment, playing all the instruments himself (although he did hire a drummer for four songs), so the range of sounds is limited. Their range of use, however, is not. He knows just how to score these miniature movies to enhance their drama-- when to bring in the droning guitars to bolster the tension of ""Donkey"", how to overlay the delicate melody of ""Monday Morning"" against a backdrop of guitar distortion, how to wring maximum effect out of an incremental tempo change on ""Roomful of Sparrows"", and when to counter a stormy crescendo with a stark acoustic guitar on closer ""This Old World"". Such techniques, no doubt picked up during his soundtrack work, draw out deeper shades of meaning in his songs, balancing optimism with despair. Or, as he sings on the countrified opener ""The Closest We Will Ever Be"": ""There's always some shadows within the prettiest of scenes/ I'll cast one on you, and you'll cast one on me."" That realization gives this short, modest album an inordinate emotional heft and makes it linger long after those last notes have stopped reverberating.","Composer and songwriter David Wingo issues another strong LP whose expansiveness and Americana textures are reminiscent of MMJ or Band of Horses.

Solar Life Raft,DJ /ruptureMatt Shadetek,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a72413d1975652139340/1:1/w_160/96a4378f.jpg,2009-11-12 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13680-solar-life-raft/,Agriculture,"After blowing minds with his 2008 survey of global bass music, Uproot, Brooklyn's DJ /rupture shifted gears with Patches, a mix of live recordings with the Ex guitarist Andy Moor. In some ways, the two albums were opposites. Uproot flowed like water, while Patches, with its live guitars and abrasive textures, scorched like fire. On Solar Life Raft, Rupture works with Matt Shadetek, with whom he runs the fledgling Dutty Artz imprint, and who contributed his breathtaking dub remix of Iron Shirt's ""I Gave You All My Love"" to Uproot. You might expect another new collaborator to give rise to another new style, but the album backtracks over Uproot's well-excavated terrain instead. Solar Life Raft is heavy on deformed, quaking bass, with a variety of remixes, original content, and tweaked lifts, built in real time into a hulking apparatus. It also uses brief left-field surprises as ligaments, oases, and head-crackers: An excerpt from Nico Muhly's Mothertongue stands in for Uproot's Ekkehard Ehlers drop, and 30 seconds of Luc Ferrari's strident computer noise bridges ""4th Story Waterline"", a sinuous original production, and an airy but tuff Shadetek remix of Jahdan Blakkamoore's ""Long Road"". If Uproot felt like it was establishing a new template, Solar Life Raft follows one-- one of its creator's own devising, but a template nevertheless. The selections are mostly excellent, although once in awhile, concept trumps efficacy-- it's really neat that the poet Elizabeth Alexander, who read at Obama's inauguration, appears on the record, but her flat delivery is only tangentially musical. The use of poetry is much more effective on ""More Pets"", where Caroline Bergvall recites cheery nonsense about animals in a voice as fluent and mellifluous as the music. And the mixing is, of course, excellent. With two turntables, our sense of space remains somewhat flat-- this happens over here and that happens over there, with only a lateral distance implied. Rupture's three-turntable approach adds another plane, breaking that narrow tunnel wide open. The album embodies the maxim ""live locally, think globally."" Geographically diverse selections from Paavoharju, Mizz Beats (""Blue Night"", an album standout), and Timeblind rub shoulders with Brooklyn natives like Telepathe, Blakkamoore, and Gang Gang Dance, who get a fleet remix of ""Bebey"". Even globe-trotting DJs have to tighten their belts in this economy. The whole thing was recorded in Brooklyn, where Shadetek also lives. He's been touted as the gritty pugilist to Rupture's tweedy chin-stroker, but that's probably an overstatement for convenience: This is a guy who named one of his albums, Pale Fire, after a Nabokov novel. The record opens with a splicing-- ""mash-up"" does not do the transaction justice-- of Timeblind's ""Space Cadet"" and Shadetek's ""Strength in Numbers"". If you're unfamiliar with the original tracks, good luck figuring out where one ends and the other begins. You'll be surprised when you look them up. (Spoiler: the ruffling ambiance belongs to Timeblind, while the confetti-throwing reggae horns are Shadetek's.) The same goes for Stagga's ""The Bad Dance"" and Babylon System's ""Get on Up""-- it's not about just matching up bpms; the tracks get fully field-stripped and then recoupled with new functionality. The original productions rough out the poles the album navigates, from the bendy bass of collaboration ""Underwater High Rise"" to the haunting ambiance of Rupture original ""El Verdugo"". It's a thoroughly enjoyable album that rewards many listens, even if it does feel a bit, to borrow from Ghostface, like it could've been called More Uproot. But as someone who still spins last year's Rupture regularly, I can certainly live with that.","After blowing minds with 2008's Uproot, and working with the Ex's Andy Moor, Brooklyn's DJ /rupture teams with Dutty Artz co-owner Matt Shadetek.

Harvest Festival,Joe Goddard,by: Sean Fennessey,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a7185e6ef95969320ec3/1:1/w_160/f687d8e1.jpg,2009-11-12 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13676-harvest-festival/,Greco-Roman,"Coming on Strong, the debut album by Hot Chip, feels very far away. In the span of five years, the British five-piece have grown in interesting ways, becoming arguably the premier electronic pop act of the decade. In that time, Alexis Taylor emerged as the wounded soul of the group, and was subsequently at the center of their best moments-- the gentle cooing of ""And I Was a Boy From School"", the narcoleptic drone of ""Over and Over"", and the brave glee of ""Ready for the Floor"". But returning to Coming on Strong reveals a surprisingly even divide between the wispy de facto front man and Joe Goddard, Hot Chip's burly, good-natured percussionist and synth player, with both men playing a sort of down-tempo electro, rippling with tongue-in-cheek lyrics about love and sex and their favorite songs. Goddard sang in his Burl Ives-on-Ambien moan nearly as much as his counterpart, but Taylor's stripped down aesthetic seemed to dominate. Over the years, as Hot Chip's songs have become deeper and more complex and Taylor has stepped out as the face of the group, Goddard's swooping production and fearless programming appears to be winning out sonically. So it was little surprise that Taylor's small-run solo debut last year, Rubbed Out, was a quiet, almost painfully intimate affair. His ""Baby"" made Lou Barlow sound like a tough guy. With Harvest Festival, Goddard completes the circle with a rippling set full of throbbing synthesizers and thudding drum machines. He has assembled an accomplished but sterile batch of tracks, some best heard mid-mix at the club rather than in full. Each song title is a goofy play on natural culinary treats (from the straightforward ""Strawberry Jam"" to the clever ""Half-Time Oranges"", wisely placed as track number six of 12). Throughout there are flashes of the drama Goddard crafted in Hot Chip's more skittish songs-- the through line from The Warning's ""Tchaparian"" to Goddard's twitchy, dissonant ""Pineapple Chunk"" is straight and narrow. Loop is the operative word here. ""Pear-Shaped"" is dubstep-- good dubstep, really-- through and through. It burrows deep into your body and moves with a fluidity that sounds easy to construct but is deceptively difficult to conjure. Rarely does Goddard flip the mic on and sing, most explicitly on ""Lemon & Lime (Home Time)"", a throwback to Coming on Strong's quieter moments of self-reflection. ""Take me out, I want to see the morning,"" he burrs-- whether he's emerging from an all-night rave, or an isolated cycle of despair is hard to tell-- Goddard's voice is nothing if not mysteriously monotonous. In many ways Harvest Festival just feels like a workout; a jaunt for Goddard's recently founded label, Greco-Roman. It's a landing place for kinetic but somewhat unformed songs-- like the pulsating, irresistible, and sort of silly ""Go Bananas""-- sloppier, dance-driven ideas that cannot or will not make it to Hot Chip's next album, which Goddard told the NME will be ""club tunes but not the really banging ones. We just felt like we wanted to focus on trying to write some really strong pop songs, rather than making hard, aggressive dance floor tracks that have bits of songs bolted onto them."" A synthesis of the old Hot Chip and the new seems wise. But it makes Harvest Festival feel like nothing more than a buffer; an appetizer. Ultimately this is smart but unfinished work. Goddard has found a rare thing in Taylor: a match; they make an implacable team. And they needn't stray to be great.","Hot Chip's co-frontman records his debut solo LP, a rippling set full of throbbing synthesizers and thudding drum machines.

Stills,God Help the Girl,by: Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6ed9d034d5c69bf3673/1:1/w_160/ecff38dd.jpg,2009-11-12 06:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13640-stills/,Rough Trade,"Belle and Sebastian's Stuart Murdoch keeps putting out music from his planned musical film before anyone has seen the movie. This is a tricky proposition. And, so far, a successful one. This summer's self-titled debut album from the Glaswegian singer and songwriter's God Help the Girl project brought together a fine cast of female vocalists, led by Catherine Ireton, for girl group- and musical theater-leaning songs centered around some longtime B&S preoccupations: sex, religion, pop. The five-song Stills EP, as its name and format suggest, plays more like a collection of scattered moments than a full-length motion picture. The best of these snapshots comes with the EP's heartbroken title track and centerpiece. As on much of God Help the Girl's LP, we're in Anne Murray or Karen Carpenter territory here-- the kind of soft, melodic, adult pop once derided as ""Happy Housewives' Music""-- and there's nothing wrong with that. Relying on little more than minor-key piano, strings, and a wonderfully pent-up female vocal, this is a hell of a torch song, full of a level of vulnerability, tunefulness, and lyrical detail that's a lot less common, and a lot more controversial, in underground circles than supposedly more avant-garde approaches. Multiple listens reveal subtle shades of humor: ""I'm getting a lot of work done/ I smoke two packs a day."" Nice work if you can get it. The four other songs may manage to captivate on film, but here they can come off sounding like relatively slight genre exercises-- well-constructed and well-sung, yes, but inessential. ""I'm in Love With the City"" has a swinging, jazz-standard feel as Ireton worries about her ""cat's chance in hell"" in a love triangle. Better than an ice cube's chance, anyway. Murdoch takes the lead on ""He's a Loving Kind of Boy"", which plays nicely with the old ""chip on his shoulder"" cliché, though mariachi-tinged horns add a distracting, novelty element. On the smoldering, bluesy ""Baby's Just Waiting"", multiple female vocalists wait on their boy to come of age, get it, then complain about losing ""the kid who was eager to please."" Finale ""The Psychiatrist Is In"", with clattering hand percussion and a whiff of Roy Orbison-style rock'n'roll balladry, builds on this theme of maturation, but Green Day did the whole shrink/whore thing more succinctly 15 years ago. Murdoch recently scheduled a few God Help the Girl live shows. Available video evidence suggests the songs from the album come across even better in concert than they do as 1s and 0s, and that will no doubt be the case with the Stills EP material, as well. Still-- ""Stills"" aside-- though this release is now available on iTunes, it often feels like what it originally was: a 10"" vinyl issue for the diehards who signed up to receive Murdoch's God Help the Girl subscription series. Then again, if subscribers get to find out more about the story behind all this music before the rest of us, membership may indeed have its privileges.","Belle and Sebastian's Stuart Murdoch follows his soundtrack to an unfinished movie with a new EP from his girl group- and musical theater-leaning project.

Islands,The Mary Onettes,by: Matthew Solarski,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6ff13d19756521392f0/1:1/w_160/6f0c95d5.jpg,2009-11-11 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13657-islands/,Labrador,"When we last left the Mary Onettes, the Swedish quartet was diligently channeling the sounds of the 1980s without a lick of the irony that often imbues such revivalism. Their retro moves seemed less about building upon the decade's musical legacy as encapsulating its finer points for consumption by a new generation. Which, hey, was a perfectly cool way to go about things. At their best, the band positively nailed the bruised romanticism and exquisite melancholy that marked a certain strain of that decade's best pop, and besides, most of the signature propagators of said pop were by then long gone or, worse yet, distant shadows of their former selves. Plus it's not like you'll catch any of the old guard in the tiny-ish clubs and early-afternoon festival slots the Mary Onettes are used to playing, so for those seeking stadium-sized grandeur in parlor-intimate spaces, the band has something relatively unique to offer. The self-titled The Mary Onettes from 2007, in fact, turned out not unlike many records from the era it emulated: several excellent singles or would-be singles (""Lost"", ""Slow"", ""Void"", ""Under the Guillotine""), the token slow jam (""The Laughter""), an effective opener and closer (""Pleasure Songs"" and ""Still"", respectively), and, well, some not terribly memorable stuff in between. All of which makes Islands, the Mary Onettes' follow-up, an at once enchanting and frustrating listen. Yes, the high points of the previous record are duplicated here-- but so too are the same problems that occasionally bogged down that record. Opener ""Puzzles"" actually betters The Mary Onettes' lead track, the great-tune-with-questionable-lyrics ""Pleasure Songs"", galloping along on a spritely keyboard riff and setting an appropriate tone for the nine tracks to follow. ""Let's talk about what feels strange on the inside,"" vocalist Philip Ekström offers, an apt enough invitation to the scores of disaffected youngsters with which this sort of music has always resonated best. ""Dare"", ""Symmetry"", and ""The Disappearance of My Youth"", then, are the hot singlez here, and each has the band showing off a few new tricks. ""Symmetry"" gets extra sentimental with the strings, ""Dare"" soars near the heights of ""Lost"" on the strength of plenty of ""ooohs"" and ""ahhhs"", and ""Disappearance"" features-- what else?-- a children's choir joining in to sing the title line. Their brief major label dalliance a half decade behind them, it's clear the Mary Onettes' ambitions haven't wavered in the least. Elsewhere, a few numbers-- notably the slow jam (""Cry for Love"") and the closer (""Bricks"")-- fall short of their counterparts on LP1. The former lacks the poise and grace of ""The Laughter"", while the latter generally sounds like a limp rehash of several earlier tracks on Islands, very much in want of a distinguishing feature. At least ""Still"" settled on a strident march beat that evoked a spirited departure off into the sunset (or, better yet, the rain); ""Bricks"" just kind of meanders off in a mid-tempo haze. Indeed, distinction would serve the rest of the tracks on Islands well; as on The Mary Onettes, the stuff in between here tends to drift by largely unnoticed. Ekström has stated that the title Islands refers to how ""every song is like a record of its very own,"" and ironically this is perhaps the biggest snare this time around: without a sonic story arc of sorts to create continuity across Islands, we're encouraged to hold the tracks against one another (hence the partitioning above into ""great"" and ""just okay"" camps) rather than consider them in relation to the whole of the album. In short, somebody needs to introduce these guys to transitions, interludes, intros, outros, deliberate sketches, ambience, that sort of thing (although, in fairness, Islands does open with a nice bit of panoramic, cloud-parting feedbackery)-- a means to more effectively tie all these so-called ""islands"" together. The otherwise unremarkable ""Century"" includes a telling line: ""I've never been good at holding back,"" Ekström declares there. Until he is, the Mary Onettes will likely remain a killer singles band that makes just pretty good albums.","Heart-on-sleeve Swedes return with another album of 1980s-indebted exquisite melancholy.

A Good Year for Hardness,Six Finger Satellite,by: Jason Crock,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a722c0084474cd0c0b0e/1:1/w_160/e553ffd1.jpg,2009-11-11 06:00:03,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13679-a-good-year-for-hardness/,Anchor Brain,"A Good Year for Hardness doesn't sound like what you'd expect from Six Finger Satellite, but during the first 10 years of their career before their hiatus in 2001, they never really played to expectations anyway. From gnashing noise-rock to synth-heavy freakouts to Krautrock rhythms and electronic textures, the band never lingered on any particular style or sound for very long. Listeners and critics alike have compared them to Shellac, Devo, Braniac, even Kraftwerk-- a pretty disparate group of pretty innovative bands. Even the album they recorded before breaking up, the traightforward hardcore Half Control (which only saw release last year), was another relative left turn. But throughout all the personnel changes and stylistic shifts, the band was never dull. Until now. Singer J. Ryan and drummer-turned-guitarist Rick Pelletier are the only founding members left, joined here by Dan St. Jaques and Brian Dufresne on bass and drums. ""Hot Food"" starts the record on a reassuring note, with biting and saturated guitars, backup vocals rearranged until they sound like gargling robots, and a short, spooky Moog. The repetitive riff and call-and-response of following track ""Roam From Home"", however, are more indicative of the rest of the record.  Almost all the songs are recorded with monotonous bottom-string guitar riffs and lurching, staccato rhythms. In their swagger and bluster, most of these songs have a surprisingly classic rock feel. (Ryan goes so far as to quote ""Come Together"" on ""Half Life"" and ""Macarthur Park"" on ""Midnight Rails"".) As for any electronic textures, there are few synthesizers in earshot, save for the aforementioned ""Hot Food"" and the occasional low-in-the-mix accoutrement on ""Half Life"" or ""Hearts and Rocks"". ""Wilson P."" adds a glassier, more distinctive guitar riff along with some organ for some needed variety, and the hushed patter of ""Rise"", the closing track, is the record's most intense moment. However, the songs fail to distinguish themselves from one another and bleed into one lumbering, forgettable whole. That said, the band sounds excited to be back together. The austere production catches an undeniable energy, and although their lyrics are a little less manic in their delivery, they're still sung with convincing menace. Holding them to their past glory may not be fair, but before their hiatus, they were a forward-thinking and creatively restless band. If there's any standard they should be held to, it's that. Given that the band has been touring, there still may be bolder efforts ahead.","After a 10-year hiatus, the hard-to-pin-down, forward-looking indie rock band returns.

Extended Vacation,On Fillmore,by: Grayson Currin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a732ea9e61561daa551e/1:1/w_160/5a60adfb.jpg,2009-11-11 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13694-extended-vacation/,Dead Oceans,"Ah, the instrumental side project, where the ""serious"" musician in a relatively popular group heads to explore the ideas that are beyond the rest of his bandmates. Humorless, esoteric, unaccomplished, dilettantish-- you know, those kinds of ideas. From a consumer standpoint, such music is generally the domain of completists, fans so devoted to the flagship that they must own every record any member has ever touched. Thankfully, Wilco fans need not fear Extended Vacation, the fourth LP by On Fillmore, the long-running if infrequent instrumental side project of Wilco drummer Glenn Kotche and upright bassist Darin Gray, formerly of Chicago standouts Brise-Glace. These seven interwoven pieces delight: Accessible but not pedestrian, complex but not esoteric, Extended Vacation feels improvised in spirit, but, in both structure and sound, it reveals two focused, imaginative composers and performers. The melodies and the warped sounds-- a vibraphone blurred into an organ, animal samples sculpted into a symphony, xylophone lines fashioned into music box tunes-- make Extended Vacation the most instantly likable On Fillmore album yet. But the latticework way in which it all comes together-- in pieces that flirt with Tropicália, drone, and Sunday morning jazz on an album that treats the unexpected like its favorite conquest-- likely makes it On Fillmore's most enduring album, too. (The Album) included, it's the only essential Wilco-related release of 2009. The first On Fillmore LP since 2004's Sleeps with Fishes, Extended Vacation starts with a pun-- the album title. Get it: They're back? Its opening and closing tracks-- ""Checking In"" and ""Clearing Out""-- joke on function, too. Sure, On Fillmore might be instrumental, but they're also a playful band, evidenced by the fun they seem to be having with sound here. While ""Master Moon"" is guided by Gray's upright bass saunter, it's the circus of music surrounding it-- junk percussion like rattles and shakers, or a wah-wah effect applied generously to a thumb piano-- that supplies the spirit. Or when the bass and drum enter together a minute into ""Checking In"", Gray and Kotche sound ecstatic, as if they've been waiting five years for this moment. Though Kotche is only an equal star here, no mention of Extended Vacation would be complete without acknowledging his special place in modern music. Who else in rock bands as popular as Wilco-- these days, smiling on the covers of the biggest music magazines and selling out amphitheaters and arenas on multiple continents-- consistently works with so many boundary-bending projects? Kotche has composed for Kronos Quartet and, last year, wrote new works for the Bang on a Can All-Stars that tapped the folk traditions of the American South. His most recent solo album, 2006's Mobile, mixed the legacies of modern composers with huge chunks of world music. Even on his flagship act's records, Kotche's never been just a drummer. He's been an explorer who refused to be circumscribed by his band's public ascendance. As appealing as it is challenging, Extended Vacation is the sort of album that might even make those Wilco fans who can sing only ""Kingpin"" believe it.","The latest from the long-running side project of Wilco drummer Glenn Kotche and upright bassist Darin Gray, two focused, imaginative composers.

Rewolf,Asobi Seksu,by: Eric Harvey,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a72bb1335d7bf1698fc7/1:1/w_160/058e3343.jpg,2009-11-11 06:00:01,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13685-rewolf/,Polyvinyl,"Remix albums might be the new live albums, but over the past few years, ""sessions"" have also come to prominence as a way for artists to reimagine or repurpose their music in a variety of different scenarios. Things like Daytrotter, La Blogotheque, Black Cab Sessions, ""Don't Look Down"" and other Pitchfork.tv shows, and AOL Sessions, have become the ""MTV Unplugged"" for the era of inexpensive digital technology, constantly shifting economic imperatives, and small-but-fervent online publics. Though not sponsored by an outside entity, Asobi Seksu's Rewolf, sold at merch tables earlier this year as Acoustic at Olympic Studios, fits perfectly in this niche, offering nine stripped-down reimaginings of the duo's music-- most from 2009's Hush-- with a cover of Hope Sandoval's smoky 2002 single ""Suzanne"". One of the last works recorded at the London studio most known for legendary sessions with the Beatles and Stones, Rewolf-- cut on an off-day during a tour-- contains a few nice surprises. Where Hush felt too safe and familiar, walking carefully in the footprints of the still very good Citrus, a few recut tracks here emphasize some of the group's best qualities. ""Blind Little Rain"", for instance, was too delicate to be as pumped up with echo as it was, but the Rewolf version-- for just piano and voice-- sounds lovely and pristine in comparison, placing all due emphasis on the fragile melody. Though I liked the wobbly sci-fi undertones of the Hush version of ""Gliss"", and the brawny guitars of Citrus highlight ""New Years"", the stripped-down models of each-- reduced to xylophone and acoustic guitar, prove that strong compositions can withstand a bit of transformation. On the other hand, ""Urusai Tori"", from this year's Transparence EP (now called ""Bossa""), shifts the focus fully to the duo's aptitude at interpretation. What started as a punchy number with well-placed glitchy electronic undertones gets thoroughly, and imaginatively, remodeled as something of a Stan Getz pastiche. Not everything works so well, though. ""Thursday"" is more or less the duo's signature-- and best-- song, in large part because it's the group's best use of the studio-as-instrument. Blowing away the overdubbed fog and leaving nothing but a skeletal piano/acoustic guitar/voice structure is an act of bravery, but my over-familiarity with the original is the only thing holding my attention. It's certainly not the breathily spoken French overlaying the song's second refrain. Along the same line, the inclusion of 2004's ""Walk on the Moon"" does little here save remind us that it's more or less ""Thursday""'s first draft (Hush's ""In the Sky"" was version 3.0). And though there are atmospheric similarities between Chikudate's and Hope Sandoval's approaches to singing, the ""Suzanne"" cover doesn't do much other than reaffirm the fact that the former Mazzy Star frontwoman has a lock on hazy, smoky ambience. Chikudate's porcelain-doll approach works for a lot of things, but does nothing to improve the original. Rewolf is, of course, a quickie one-off interstitial between new material, meant more as an accompaniment to previous releases than a standalone work. At the same time though, it still manages to highlight that, when they want to, these two can stretch into a starker (yet still pretty) realm that would frighten off less-talented groups with equal predilections for studio wizardry. Hush left me confused, and a bit concerned, as to what Asobi Seksu's next move will be. Though it's lightweight, Rewolf gives me a bit of hope that they'll push themselves outward a bit more next time.","The dream-pop band offers nine stripped-down reimaginings of the duo's music, with a cover of Hope Sandoval's smoky 2002 single ""Suzanne"".

Bleach [Deluxe Edition] / Live at Reading,Nirvana,by: Stuart Berman,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a71d9d034d5c69bf36f4/1:1/w_160/fc9b1cde.jpg,2009-11-11 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13686-bleach-deluxe-edition-live-at-reading/,Sub Pop,"The line between cool and uncool has never been less defined: We live in a world where Hall and Oates have become as influential to emergent indie-rockers as Joy Division, and Journey's ""Don't Stop Believin'"" has become as much of a hipster-bar last-call anthem as ""There Is a Light That Never Goes Out"". And yet, even in an era of omnivorous musical consumption and boundless genre tourism, the sight of a computerized Kurt Cobain belting out Bon Jovi's ""You Give Love a Bad Name"" in a recent Guitar Hero 5 demo reel was enough to revert the good/bad taste divide back to 1988 borders. For Nirvana fans, the Guitar Hero scandal was more than just a case of a dead rock-star's visage being exploited for the sake of peddling product. Few artists treated record collections as an extension of personal politics quite like Cobain; having him sing a hair-metal hit is not just contrary to his musical taste, but his entire value system. (Though one can't help but wonder what a guy who once skewered alpha-male behavior in a song called ""Mr. Moustache"" would make of indie's current facial-hair fetish.) And yet, Cobain was no stranger himself to challenging accepted notions of cool. When it first emerged 20 years ago, Nirvana's debut album, Bleach, represented an equally heretical notion to some indie aesthetes: Flipper-grade sludge-punk molded into Beatles-schooled pop schematics. By 1989, indie rock was already making a rightward shift across the radio dial-- Dinosaur Jr. had covered Peter Frampton, the Butthole Surfers were dropping in not-too-subtle Black Sabbath and Zeppelin references-- but rather than using post-hardcore noise to desecrate their traditional FM-radio influences, Nirvana used it to give their dinosaur rock more teeth. In Cobain, they had a frontman with uncommonly melodic instincts, but shot through a voice that sounded like it was coughing up blood; in Krist Novoselic, a bassist who could hit the heretofore untapped sweet spot between Paul McCartney and the Melvins. But unlike most rock bands who divided pop history between before and after, Nirvana's impact was not immediate. Upon its release, Bleach was a modest indie rock success at 40,000 copies sold, and the album's low-budget legend-- it was recorded for a scant $600, footed by the band's temporary second guitarist, Jason Everman-- often overshadows the music within. At that point, Nirvana had yet to divest itself of its Pete Best: drummer Chad Channing, whose scrappy style wasn't fully suited to the band's growing propensity for crater-inducing stompers. (Three Bleach tracks-- ""Floyd the Barber"", ""Paper Cuts"", and ""Downer""-- were actually helmed by Melvins thud-master Dale Crover, and you can really tell.) And the album's first single-- a cover of 1960s Dutch-popsters Shocking Blue's ""Love Buzz""-- is more emblematic of the dementoid new wave that Nirvana would indulge in on their future B-sides than the metallic Pixies-punk that would turn them into stars. But rather than unfairly compare it to the platinum sheen of sophomore release Nevermind, Bleach is best appreciated today as a snapshot of a specific time and place, of a Seattle scene bubbling up before it turned into a media adjective: In the Aero Zeppelin grind of ""School"" and the Mudhoney-quoting scum-bucket thrash of ""Negative Creep"", you have the perfect audio manifestation of the stark, exhilarating black-and-white Charles Peterson photos that captured late-80s Seattle like a series of strobe-light flickers (and which populate much of this reissue's 52-page photo booklet). Original producer Jack Endino's new remastering job gives Bleach a much-needed boost in fidelity, but there's an intrinsic, primordial murkiness to this album that can't be polished-- while Axl was welcoming the masses into the Sunset Strip jungle, Nirvana dragged the Sub Pop set into the bleak, chilly backwoods from which they came. Though briskly paced, Bleach is a front-loaded record, the maniacal/melodic contrasts of its stellar first half-- anchored by the epochal anti-love song ""About a Girl""-- ceding to the more period-typical grunge of its second. The bonus live performance included here (recorded in 1990 at Portland's Pine Street Theater) suggests as much, mostly ignoring Bleach's side B to showcase important transitional tracks: the scabrous pop of ""Sappy"" (later to emerge as ""Verse Chorus Verse"" on the 1993 No Alternativecompilation); ""Dive"", a blueprint for Nevermind's plutonium-grade rockers; and ""Been a Son"", which bears the influence of Cobain's beloved Vaselines (whose ""Molly's Lips"" is covered here). It's a testament to both Endino's live-in-the-room production style and Nirvana's raucous onstage energy that Bleach and the bonus concert set sound like they were cut in the same session. But the concert also presents Nirvana in a light that the band's subsequently troubled and tragic story so rarely affords them: a simple, playful power trio who could lay waste to a drunk club crowd on a Saturday night. Two years and one Dave Grohl later, the circumstances couldn't have been more different for Nirvana. Amid rumors of Kurt'n'Courtney drug problems and inter-band acrimony, the trio took to the stage for their headlining Sunday-night appearance at the Reading Festival, effectively cementing their status as the biggest-- and most gossiped about-- rock band in the world. If Bleach contains just trace evidence of the band that would, almost overnight, force radio stations to flip formats and record stores to open up ""alternative"" sections, the Live at Reading CD/DVD provides formidable evidence of perhaps the last rock'n'roll band to transform the monoculture in its own image. And yet, despite Cobain's cheeky show-biz entrance-- rolled onto stage in a wheelchair by music journalist Everett True, singing a line from Bette Midler's ""The Rose"", and then mock-collapsing-- the Reading set shows a band that hadn't changed all that much fundamentally from that Pine Street Theater gig two years previous. Cobain's newly acquired, generational spokesmen duties didn't make him any more fond of engaging the audience with stage banter, ceding emcee duties to the jovial Novoselic during guitar changes. And even when playing to the biggest audience of their career, Nirvana blast through the 25-song setlist with a barrel-down, no-bullshit intensity that suggests it didn't matter if they were playing to 100 people or 100,000. And most pertinently, both concerts capture the band at crucial, between-album turning points: where the Pine Street Theater set shows a band burnishing its pop appeal, Live at Reading betrays Cobain's eagerness to tear it down, dispensing with the obvious Nevermind hits by the mid-set point, while reserving the encores for seething covers of 80s California punks Fang's suitably sardonic ""The Money Will Roll Right In"" and the Wipers' ""D-7"". In retrospect, the concert crystallizes the moment when Cobain stopped serving his servants and started serving himself, pointing the way to 1993's notoriously caustic In Utero. Given its long-standing popularity as a bootleg, you can't help but wonder why Live at Reading wasn't officially released back in the mid-90s instead of the live compilation From the Muddy Banks of Wishkah; certainly, Reading makes for a more appropriate, electrified complement to the band's other career-defining performance, 1994's Unplugged in New York release. And for the sake of squeezing the entire set (save for ""Love Buzz"") on a single disc, the Reading CD excises pretty much all of the DVD's between-song interactions (most notably, the goof on Boston's ""More Than a Feeling"" that precedes the similarly riffed ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"") and key contextual interludes that reveal the tumult leading up to this triumphant performance (e.g., a heartfelt plea from Cobain to have the crowd shout a conciliatory ""We love you Courtney"" in the wake of her receiving the Yoko treatment from the British tabloids). But the CD's career-spanning tracklist-- touching on the best of Bleach, most of Nevermind, choice singles and B-sides (""Sliver"", ""Aneurysm""), three In Utero previews (""Tourette's"", ""Dumb"", ""All Apologies""), and the aforementioned covers-- actually makes it a far superior, more comprehensive introduction for Nirvana newbies than the band's 2002 greatest-hits compilation. Like the Who's Live at Leeds or Cheap Trick's At Budokan, it's an indispensible document of a legendary band at their most invincible. And even if you're the sort of Nirvana die-hard who's been sitting on an audio bootleg of this gig for the past 17 years,you really need the DVD-- for a band whose visual legacy mostly amounts to a handful of stylized videos and the lowkey Unplugged special, Live at Reading effectively grants you side-stage access to the band in their mosh-pit-stoking, drum-set-toppling prime, putting you as close to the action as the band's mysterious friend Tony, who's seen flailing onstage throughout the show like an epilpetic Bez. Like the Bleach reissue, the Live at Reading packaging is heavy on photos and other scrapbook visuals, but entirely bereft of liner-note reminiscences and analysis-- because lord knows we don't need another essay-length rumination about Nirvana's cultural import and Cobain's conflicted relationship with stardom. The most lasting images on the Live at Reading DVD-- from the 60,000-strong pogo pit, to the blood sprayed on Cobain's pick guard at set's end, to the awkward but poignant post-show meeting with a young, leukemia-stricken fan-- tell you everything you need to know.","Nirvana's scrappy Sub Pop debut is reissued with a 1990 live show as a bonus, and their legendary 1992 set at Reading is finally given a DVD/CD release.

Warm Brother,Digital Leather,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a65513d197565213916e/1:1/w_160/28f5e9ca.jpg,2009-11-10 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13511-warm-brother/,Fat Possum,"Shawn Foree is just your typical Midwestern American-Lit student who plays ""new-wave Nazi fag punk"" (among other memorable epithets he's coined) under Jay Reatard management. Since 2004, he's been releasing his home recordings as Digital Leather, seeming to court perpetual obscurity. His music fits squarely into an arcane lineage of indie-rock bands who combine awkward vocals, lyrics that run the gamut from weird to transgressive, and oddly-shaped instrumental parts into unaccountably catchy songs: The Frogs, Mink Lungs, Thinking Fellers Union Local 282, My Dad Is Dead. In other words, he's sui generis, fitting in only with other acts defined by not fitting in. Foree's up to his usual tricks on his first Fat Possum album, squeezing a Nazi reference and a gay joke into the title alone (look it up), and inscribing it on an old guy's chest for bonus lulz. That's offensive on so many levels, but at the same time, it's hard to get worked up about, because it's trying so hard for shock value. You don't get the feeling that Foree is really a Nazi homophobe, just a louche IRL-troll with a sense of humor stuck in South Park. Nevertheless, Warm Brother threatens to win him a wider audience. While it's still off-kilter garage- and indie-rock with a blown-out electronic sheen, it's his first album recorded in an actual studio, and from the tootling shlock of ""Your Hand, My Glove"" to the M83-in-a-garbage-can stomper ""Not Now"", the songs really pop. It still feels defiantly niche, even as it alludes to better-known acts. The album recalls the submerged, piecemeal anthems of early Guided by Voices and the hoarse-throated barnburners of Wolf Parade (see ""Kisses"", with its chant-like vocal exhortations, and flat-footed drums thwacking through ringing chords). And the lyrics are actually pretty sweet. They're also negligible. Foree's voice is nothing special-- a deep, level croon-- and while he cooks up some indelible vocal melodies, the music is the main attraction here. The drums detonate and echo like mortar rounds in a canyon; the infectious guitar parts explore gnarled acres of timbre and distortion; and the synths-- good god, the synths. They roar and spark and rip holes in the music in a way that instantly elevates offhanded ditties into four-alarm blazes. ""Photo Lie"" blends guitar-fuzz and keyboard-fuzz into an indistinguishably pounding mass. But the best songs exploit the contrast between quiet guitars and loud electronics, seeming to actually explode in Foree's hands. ""All the People"" starts off as a blocky folk strummer, before a chewed-up synth line pops out, and in ""Bugs on Glue"", a side-winding riff-fest spills riotously out of an anxious tape-manipulated haze. The balance between carefully fitted parts and their edge-of-danger deployment keeps us on thrillingly unsteady footing for the album's duration. It's a kitschy, shticky, charming curio.","Managed by Jay Reatard, Shawn Foree's project has a predictably rude sense of humor; here, he takes advantage of a full studio for the first time.

Visitation,Division Day,by: Jayson Greene,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a721ea9e61561daa5505/1:1/w_160/4ead1180.jpg,2009-11-10 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13689-visitation/,Dangerbird,"They may claim Santa Cruz, Calif., as their hometown, but Division Day can't help but sound as if their hearts are rooted elsewhere: specifically, in Omaha, circa 1999. Their debut full-length, 2007's Beartrap Island, was tricked out with all manner of art-pop production flourishes, but all the atmospheric whooshes and vaguely dubby drum sounds in the world couldn't disguise the good ol' cornfed American emo heart beating at the music's center. When they stuck with this basic impulse, they gathered momentum; the rest of the time, they lingered in muddier waters, coming across as a better-than-average average rock band with some grand ambitions. Their second full-length, Visitation, doubles down on the art-rock signifiers, which means, unfortunately, it also doubles the production effects-- those whooshes are now accompanied by billowing synths, glitchy bursts of noise, sirenlike blares, and seven or eight different vocal filters. It's a somewhat disorienting look for what is basically meat-and-potatoes guitar rock, and it doesn't do these guys many favors. The scrapyard drums of opener ""Reservoir"" immediately set the agenda. ""Devil Light"", meanwhile, is pockmarked with slowed-tape noises and bursts of static, with harp and celesta glimmering in the background, and yet it still sounds what it is-- a nice-enough midtempo rocker. The same goes for ""Carrier""; despite a massive wall of synths quivering in the background, the vocal melody is straight prom slow-dance material, right down to the softly glowing saxophone solo. Division Day don't write bad songs, or ones that lack hooks or decent melodies. The problem is that this stuff is just too smooth and inoffensive for its layers upon layers of studio trickery. Even on the off moments when the band manages to work up some abrasive energy, Rohner Segnitz's glassy, featureless voice pours a big pot of Sleepytime Tea all over it-- see ""Malachite"", which manages to sound vaguely King Crimson-esque right up until the exact moment the vocals enter. Too much of Visitation lingers in draggy, po-faced ballads, making the false equation between slowing down and Saying Something Important. The brisk, thrumming ""Reservoir"", which recalls the martial thrust of Bloc Party's ""Like Eating Glass"", is one of the album's most invigorating moments, and Visitation could use more of them. ""Surrender"", another of the record's handful of uptempo numbers, is also one of the only songs that benefits from its processed sound, its clanking industrial drums recalling a more streamlined version of Radiohead's ""15 Step"". Most of the time, though, the record's stagey atmosphere does little service to Division Day's earnest melodic gifts, and it reminds me of the Promise Ring's ill-advised bid for art-pop legitimacy with 2002's snoozy Wood/Water. Division Day would be doing us a favor with the more straightforward route next time; the world needs reliable emo bands more than it needs charisma-challenged art-rock hopefuls.","This California band blends the ambition of Omaha turn-of-the-millennium emo with tricked-out studio atmospherics.

Truce Opium,Dark Meat,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a72013d1975652139339/1:1/w_160/82f1a461.jpg,2009-11-10 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13688-truce-opium/,Emergency Umbrella,"I saw Dark Meat play a small club in Washington D.C. shortly after the release of their debut album, Universal Indians. The Athens collective, whose members numbered well into double digits, couldn't all fit on the tiny corner stage, so a guitarist and a horn player had to play from the audience. Decked out in warpaint and throwing handfuls of confetti like grenades, they actually outnumbered the crowd, which seemed at the time both sad and somehow impressive. Bandleader Jim McHugh has a vision, and while it may not be logistically or financially feasible, he never leaves that fifth tambourine player at home. For their second album, Truce Opium, Dark Meat have shed a few members-- they're back down into the single digits-- but they actually manage to expand their sound. Where once they mixed the most avant of jazz influences with the Stonesiest of classic rock, now the band blends in, well, pretty much everything imaginable: metal drone, prog effects, throat singing, Southern folk, even granola-crusted jamband. Predictably, Truce Opium bursts at the seams with ideas: A fife rises out of the din on opener ""The Faint Smell of Moss"" to give the percussive riffs more emphasis. On ""Future Galaxies"", the horns swell and subside hypnotically, recalling the Doppler Effect keyboards on Kraftwerk's ""Autobahn"", and closer ""Song of the New Year"" is a 12-minute sing-along dirge that slowly accrues instruments even as it threatens to fall apart. That crammed conceptuality is an essential part of Dark Meat's appeal, but those densely packed ideas don't seem to be arranged as exactingly or as excitingly as they were on Universal Indians, which is another way of saying the new songs aren't as strong. By embedding free-form noise into traditional song shapes, they made classic rock sound exotic and made the conceptual sound earthily accessible. But on Truce Opium, the songs are almost carelessly loose, with no recognizable elements to tether their jamming or shape their noise. ""When the Shelter Came"" twists and tangles itself melodically, initially coming across as anthemic before eventually wandering off into an extended horn break and then collapsing. It sounds unfinished; the shelter never comes. Still, the novelty of such an unwieldy lineup translates into a distinctively dense sound, so that even when Truce Opium feels unmoored and aimless, the sheer force of Dark Meat comes through clearly, as on ""The Faint Smell of Moss"" and the short, spastic ""Yonderin'"", two of the most lucid songs here. Ironically, the best track may be one of the longest: After a rambling intro, the 10-minute ""No One Was There"" breaks down into an extended drum-rooted jam punctuated by an ascending theme that makes an effective hook for 10 minutes. Dark Meat still play it as loudly as possible, which compensates for so many shortcomings.","Ambitious Athens collective blend almost everything imaginable-- from drone metal to avant-jazz, Southern folk to classic rock-- into their huge sound.

Chomp More,Pylon,by: Patrick Sisson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a71fc0084474cd0c0b05/1:1/w_160/bd3d7f2c.jpg,2009-11-10 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13692-chomp-more/,DFA,"""Life is nothing but death and taxes/ And all the trees that get the axes,"" Pylon singer Vanessa Briscoe Hay dryly coos on ""K"", against a backdrop of prickly guitar tones and a taut bass line. ""I'm tired of moving my jaw,"" she also sneers, in case you didn't pick up on her disinterest. The morose opening track on Chomp More reinforces the standard notion that the R.E.M. contemporaries were Athens, Georgia's version of Gang of Four. But this reissue, another DFA-sanctioned dip into the band's brief back catalog, highlights the unhinged spin the band put on post-punk, a joyous take on mechanized funk. Recorded in 1982 after Pylon had already taken a U.S. road trip with Leeds' most famous Marxist rock collective, Chomp sounds more assured and more open. Packaged in a record sleeve with a die-cut ""bite"" on the edge and filled with stripped-down dance rhythms and proto-indie guitar riffs, it telegraphs bigger ambitions than 1980's Gyrate. Hay's attitude and vocals, the flipside of the bright camp coming from her contemporaries in the B-52's, swings from dry observations to passionate fury, further broadcasting the group's desire to evolve. She's slick yet airy on ""Yo-Yo"", a taut take on a relationship's heavy emotional swings, while she growls on the bright New Wave of ""No Clocks"", a passionate song about the honeymoon period. ""Crazy"" finds her slowly becoming unhinged, escalating into possessed, shriek-laden crescendo. R.E.M.'s jangly cover, which appeared on Dead Letter Office, wisely dials back, since Stipe's vocals lack Hay's fury and sharp edge. The creative guitar playing of the late Randy Bewley, who passed away earlier this year, highlights the stylistic crossroads the group never steered away from. Bewley pivoted a bit towards college rock riffs on Chomp, with the wry, surf-like playing on instrumental ""Italian Movie Theme"" and the crisp, cold runs on ""Crazy"" and ""Gyrate"". But his wiry, pointillistic style, like the flinty tones that open ""Beep"", dominate and helped drive Pylon's dance floor rhythms. His scratched, staccato notes on ""Yo-Yo"" were a perfect counterpoint to the oozing bass of Michael Lachowski. The expanded section of Chomp More-- which includes three alternate mixes and ""Four Minutes"", an echo-laden, slow-motion collage of samples and sounds-- is mostly surplus reels of studio experimentation, intriguing considering the group disbanded shortly after album's release. The 7"" mix of ""Crazy"" is more breezy and less interesting than the album cut, but the pitch-shifted vocals and faint echoes found on ""Yo-Yo (Male Version)"" suggest a faint dub feel, and the reworked ""Gyrate"" churns together sound effects, a vortex of rhythms that collapses on itself. It's unlikely there will be additional Pylon releases in the future (the band had hinted at new recordings prior to Bewley's death). In addition to getting more work from this pioneering band into wider circulation, Chomp More points to the upward trajectory they achieved after only a few years. Coming years after the post-punk revival strip mined the genre's signifiers, this album still manages to sound unique.","An expanded reissue of the Athens post-punks' second album offers some clues to where they could have gone next.

Attention Deficit,Wale,by: Sean Fennessey,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a72f5e6ef95969320ef9/1:1/w_160/8e3adfad.jpg,2009-11-10 06:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13695-attention-deficit/,InterscopeAllido,"It's no secret that the Internet is hurting rappers. Hurting their record sales. Hurting their ability to control narrative. And, perhaps most crucially, hurting their ability to self-edit. Flip cam freestyles, track-a-day mixtapes, local radio interviews delivered worldwide. Reining it in has never been more difficult. To his credit, Wale has appeared to be in clear control of his output. In the space of three years he's released three proper mixtapes: 2007's giddy grab bag 100 Miles & Running, 2008's triumphant and savvy The Mixtape About Nothing, and this year's modest Back to the Feature. But even that tempered rollout may have been too much. Wale's proper solo debut, Attention Deficit, feels like a mishmash of those three tapes, flashing greatness but almost never transcending, and always sounding effortful. Has he said too much already? Initially positioned as a refreshing rejoinder in a new generation of rappers, Wale was never fit for savior-dom. He's said the Roots' Black Thought is his favorite MC. That's about right: technically gifted, occasionally thrilling, mostly destined to be a cog in a machine. Attention Deficit seems to ignore that, especially on the front end. What's made so many rap debuts successful is a fluidity, a connectivity from moment to moment. Wale's been slapped with the dreaded ""no personality"" tag in recent months. The opposite is true: Wale seems to jump constantly from persona to persona. Opener ""Triumph"", a terrific, Afro-beat-inspired production by TV on the Radio's Dave Sitek, indicates this will be a sonic adventure. It's not particularly. ""Mama Told Me"" is a sort of post-Kanye reflection on how difficult it is coming up in the game, namedropping people in his life whose names you will not recognize. It's been done before and better. ""Mirrors"" is sonically consistent-- squealing horns and down-low bass-- but also features that tried-and-true rap trope: the Bun B feature. It's negligible. ""Pretty Girls"" is an ode to women via his native Washington D.C. sound, produced by longtime partner Best Kept Secret, sampling legendary Go-Go crew the Backyard Band, and featuring that group's Weensey. It's a classic hip-hop raveup, loose and fun. And then Atlanta's Gucci Mane shows up. Wasn't this supposed to be a D.C. anthem? ""World Tour"" is typically bland, R&B diva-led (in this case Jazmine Sullivan) nostalgia-stroking patter. ""Let It Loose"" is the Pharrell record. Six songs in and we're hitting all the bases, without any sense of what it means to be Wale. The second half reveals a bit more: Wale is obsessed with women, whether recounting the story of a coke-addicted fameball on Mark Ronson's delicate ""90210"", or emotionally thrashing over an ex on the loping, gorgeous ""Diary"". He is distinctly interested in the female experience, even if the subject is launching him into paranoia by refusing to pick up the phone at 4 a.m. on a Saturday night. This is a unique gift-- I can't recall the last time an MC seemed so tapped into a woman's perspective while still feeling the chill of romantic strain. Sitek returns with the astounding ""TV in the Radio"", a song that both convinced me of K'Naan as a serious rapper (debatable until now) and positioned Wale properly in the mix, rapidly firing syllables like a semi-automatic. It's a bravura performance. ""Contemplate"", produced by Syience, samples Rihanna's ""Question Existing"" and transforms it into a dark, brooding piece about the difficulties of love. That it arrives amidst Rihanna's troubling trauma-as-promotional run is sad and fitting. Alas, there won't be much to gain from ""Chillin'"", the much-maligned Lady Gaga collaboration and botched first single. This was the first step in Wale's multiple personality debacle and he seems to know as much-- nothing else on Attention Deficit resembles the goofy sneakers-shouting writing here. Ironically, it's the song that directly precedes ""Chillin'"" that feels most truthful. ""Shades"", featuring Chrisette Michele, is a resilient look at being a dark-skinned African-American (Wale is first generation Nigerian-American). On the song he raps, ""They napped and slept on me/ Man, I hate black/ Skin tone, I wish I could take it back/ But rearrange my status, maybe if I was khaki/ Associating light-skinned with classy/ The minstrel show showed a me that was not me."" Internal rhyme schemes, halting phrasing, thoughtful self-exploration; this is Wale at his best. Not as a preening star filling in the gaps for a king-making debut. A regular person, with doubts and sadness, joy and confidence. There's just not enough of it on Attention Deficit.","After three mixtapes-- highlighted by 2008's triumphant and savvy The Mixtape About Nothing-- Wale finally issues his debut LP.

Horror Disco,Bottin,by: Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a7075e6ef95969320ea0/1:1/w_160/8cde7361.jpg,2009-11-09 06:00:04,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13663-horror-disco/,Bear Funk,"Almost three years ago, Justice sampled Italian prog band Goblin on their second single, ""Phantom"". If the French-house headbangers wanted to show they could weld metal's gothic nightmarishness onto disco's giddy dancefloor excess, they could hardly have made a better symbolic choice. After creating classic film soundtracks for horror auteur Dario Argento with Goblin starting in the mid-1970s, keyboard player Claudio Simonetti went on to help pioneer what is now lovingly known as Italo disco. Horror, disco-- okay, you've met. If cinematic scariness and electronic dance music were ever strange bedfellows, they certainly aren't anymore. Since ""Phantom"", Justice-style floor pummelers from Kavinsky to CFCF have acknowledged Goblin's influence. The band itself reunited for European live shows and a new album in recent years. And the guys behind German house and techno label Kompakt just started a new imprint, Fright, citing Goblin's Simonetti and Halloween film-scorer John Carpenter as touchstones. Within this burgeoning micro-movement, Venice's William Bottin has shown moments of demonic mastery, but his full-length debut, Horror Disco, rarely makes you jump out of your seat. Wielding a Farfisa Syntorchestra synth like a slasher-movie villain brandishing a murder weapon, Bottin comes up with an album that is more about a spooky mood and quirky sonics than hypnotically pristine repetitions. No surprise, then, that excellent single ""No Static"" first emerged on darkly atmospheric New Jersey label Italians Do It Better; spacey arpeggios interlap and unfold seamlessly, subtle cries of ""don't stop"" and ""can do it"" giving this the feel of a contender for Nike's ""Run"" series. ""Sciarando El Scuro"" is the most ear-catching track after ""No Static"", its chirpy hook less poltergeist than poultry-geist. From there, Horror Disco remains deeply reverent of horror and retro-futurist film music, with plenty of solid grooves to offer DJs, but not quite enough personality to make for a completely satisfying home listen. The stuttering rhythms and horn fanfares of ""Venezia Violenta"", the Halloween-esque repetitions of ominous finale ""Endless Mother"", and the creepy vocoder warnings of ""Slashdance"" are never unpleasant, but they're not exactly thrilling, either. Underscoring Horror Disco's revivalist tendencies is ""Disco for the Devil"", which features matter-of-fact mayhem from Douglas Meakin, who sang for some of Simonetti's Italo disco projects. As (dig the name) Black Devil Disco Club have shown, nu-disco doesn't have to be novel to be good, but it should usually be entertaining. Horror Disco proves Bottin knows his craft, and the standout tracks are worthwhile even for Italo disco noobs, but there's too much dull drift here to let me recommend it unreservedly for your 2010 Halloween party-- especially with so much similarly minded disco spookiness out there. After all, at 78 minutes, Horror Disco is already eight minutes longer than the Flaming Lips' sprawling new double-album. As great as Embryonic is, that's still a little scary.","With one foot in Italo disco and one in Goblin-like 1970s horror soundtrack, this debut LP is one of the more appropriately titled of the year.

Performing Parades,Efterklang,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6fa9d034d5c69bf369a/1:1/w_160/46984014.jpg,2009-11-09 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13653-performing-parades/,Leaf,"The music made by Danish art-rock ensemble Efterklang is powerful but, in some ways, unsubtle. They like grandly marching percussion, swirling orchestration, and frequent crescendos. Their vocals are stirring but stiff: Lusty chants, murmurs, and held notes fill out sweeping choral arrangements, mostly devoid of melisma and swing. Compensating for the slight stuffiness is a certain breed of indie gravitas-- they clap their hands and close their eyes and lift their faces to the sky with convincing reverence. If Under Byen, another Danish band who collaborated with an orchestra (on Siamesisk), are Denmark's Sonic Youth, then Efterklang are its Arcade Fire, with a bit of Sufjan Stevens' rootsy chamber music for good measure. Under Byen are good, but they have a sneaky, disturbing sound. Efterklang are Denmark's most world-class indie band, and they seem acutely aware of it, wearing the mantle of cultural ambassador heavily. From debut album Tripper to Parades to Performing Parades, a live recording of their sophomore album with the Danish National Chamber Orchestra, they've charted a bourgeois-friendly course from post-rock to orchestral-rock to classical. Performing Parades is beautifully played and immaculately recorded-- only the well-bred applause betrays its live status. However, the music was a lot to take in before the orchestra was added, and now, it blurs the line between pageantry and pandering. From the sorrowing piano of ""Mimeo"" to the towering string trills of ""Illuminant"", the music is monotonously epic. It's like one dramatic image stretched feature-length: The hero on the cliff, jaw jutting, with his cloak blowing romantically in the wind, for a solid hour. Still, there are many wonderful moments on Performing Parades that inspire undiluted awe. On ""Polygyne"", the orchestra lays low during the tense verses, then pushes into the mounting vocal harmonies with gusty strings and horns, to goosebumpy effect. ""Mirador"", already a very pretty song, becomes even prettier with weepy strings in counterpoint to its staggered vocal refrains. ""Frida Found a Friend"", which was originally a sort of organic IDM track, benefits from the added thickness and weight. It's just that after a few tracks, all the blood-pumping orchestration gets banal, almost deadening. The many opportunities for subtly recasting the songs are mostly ignored, in favor of high-piled fanfare. The whole thing starts sounding like postmodern holiday music, darkly chipper and overwrought-- something like Haydn's Toy Symphony, but with big drums and elves chanting about birds doing inspiring things on top of it. Gorgeous, but the pomp overloads the circumstance.","The Danish art-rock collective records their second album with some of the Danish National Chamber Orchestra, so their already-epic songs become more so.

"Ghana Special: Modern Highlife, Afro-Sounds & Ghanaian Blues 1968-1981",Various Artists,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6f6b1335d7bf1698f4a/1:1/w_160/83b127b7.jpg,2009-11-09 06:00:02,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13649-ghana-special-modern-highlife-afro-sounds-ghanaian-blues-1968-1981/,Soundway,"Earlier this year, Soundway treated us to Nigeria Special: Modern Highlife, Afro-Sounds & Nigerian Blues 1970-1976, a double-disc compilation that served as a snapshot of the country's popular music scene in the 1970s, taking in sounds from the traditionally rooted to the progressive and experimental. There was a great deal of affinity between the scenes in Nigeria and Ghana during that era, owing in part to their shared history of British colonization and the free flow of people back and forth between the two nations. During a period of exile, Nigerian Afrobeat king Fela Kuti sheltered in Ghana, and many of Ghana's musicians did stints in Lagos and other Nigerian cities. The horn-heavy dance band highlife sound that developed in Ghana was easily exported by E.T. Mensah to Nigeria in the 50s, and the two countries keep up their musical dialogue even today. So now Soundway gives us Ghana Special, a two-disc, 33-track companion to the Nigerian volume and a successor to the label's two Ghana Soundz compilations from several years ago. Where Ghana Soundz focused on heavy funk and Afrobeat, this draws from a much wider spectrum, providing a panorama of the country's pop music. The influences range from local rhythms and age-old songs and the divergent palm-wine and big band highlife styles of Ghana itself to American blues, soul, and funk, European and American rock and psych (the Barbecues quote ""Black Magic Woman"" in the organ solo of ""Aaya Lolo""), Cuban pachanga, and Nigerian Afrobeat. The cycling guitars of highlife are sometimes tinged with a bit of wah pedal, and wild analog synthesizers rub shoulders with hand drums whose design hasn't changed in centuries. Highlife's two strains-- the upper class big bands with their horn sections and lower-class palm-wine with its simple guitars and socially observant lyrics-- essentially merged during this period, as record players became widespread, economic decline made it tough to keep the big bands together, and technology changed everything. Some names are familiar. Collectors of these compilations will recognize the African Brothers, TO Jazz, the Sweet Talks, K. Frimpong, Ebo Taylor, Mercury Dance Band, Uhuru Dance Band, Gyedu-Blay Ambolley, and others (including a guest shot on sax by Fela Kuti backing Basa Basa Soundz), but there are plenty of other names that will be new even to the well-versed. The Barbecues, Boombaya, Pagadeja, the Wellis Band, St. Peter & the Holymen and Houghas Sorowonko aren't exactly well known, even to enthusiasts. The liner notes are stuffed with biographical and collector wonk information, shedding light on just how extensive the music industry was in Ghana before its collapse in 1981. For a collector, it's a treasure trove of backstory-- I've had K. Gyasi and Kyeremateng Atwede albums for years, and now I finally know who these people were. It's hard to put a foot wrong when stepping into the tracklisting. Christy Azuma & Uppers International supply ethereal Afrobeat on ""Din Ya Sugri"", the Sweet Talks get sweetly funky on ""Akampanye"", the members of Pagadeja have fun imitating animal noises on ""Tamale"", and we get to hear Hedzoleh Sounds, known in the West primarily for the record they cut backing South African trumpeter Hugh Masekela, on their own, laying down a couple of mean grooves and getting crazy with a Jew's harp. ""Bukom"", by Oscar Sulley's Nezele Sounds, brilliantly showcases Sulley's arranging skills, pitting an army of traditional drums against thundering brass-- if I ran a good college marching band program, I'd be slipping this in to the repertoire to blow some minds at half-time. Soundway's Miles Cleret also includes K. Frimpong's stone classic ""Kyenkyen Bi Adi M'Awu"", which here sounds far more cleaned up and clear than any remastering I've previously heard, be it on a cassette from Ghana or Kona's excellent 2002 Afro-Rock, Vol.1 compilation, where it made its Western debut. The long instrumental intro to Vis-A-Vis's ""Obi Agye Me Dofo"" is very nearly a cover of ""Kyenkyen"", and they share a type of syncopated, hopping beat that seems unique to Ghanaian records-- it's heard several times here, including on Ebo Taylor's ""Twer Nyame"". Though no two songs handle it exactly the same way, it's something of a national rhythmic stamp that's instantly addictive. And that's one reason that Soundway had to make a Ghanaian companion to Nigeria Special: As intertwined as the countries' music could be, neither scene was subordinate to the other, and this music is distinctly Ghanaian. In any event, Ghana Special offers a spoil of riches you can dance to in any language.","This fine 2xCD companion to the earlier Nigeria Special comp highlights the musical connections between the two countries.

World Painted Blood,Slayer,by: Cosmo Lee,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a715b1335d7bf1698f95/1:1/w_160/3c209f64.jpg,2009-11-09 06:00:01,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13673-world-painted-blood/,SonyAmerican,"World Painted Blood is the best album to come from the Big Four of Thrash (Metallica, Megadeth, Slayer, Anthrax) since the 1990s.  That's not saying much, as their prime was the 1980s. Since then, three of those bands flailed about: Metallica went the radio route, Megadeth tried to do the same, and Anthrax turned to hard rock. Slayer, on the other hand, remained Slayer. They kept their core ingredients: spiky tonalities, no-frills thrash laced with punk, and lyrical obsessions with serial murderers and blasphemy. But after 1990's Seasons in the Abyss, the Slayer team underwent turmoil. Drummer Dave Lombardo left, producer Rick Rubin reduced his participation to executive production, and cover artist Larry Carroll didn't get called back. The band fell off for several albums, generating a few great songs and a lot of filler. The return of Lombardo on 2006's Christ Illusion helped right the band somewhat. Now Slayer are fully functioning again-- and it's hard to believe that a 27-year-old band can be this intense. World Painted Blood races through 11 tracks in 40 almost fat-free minutes. Slayer haven't written a great slow song since ""Seasons in the Abyss"", but the few that are here break up the album nicely. The rest of the record is fast and finely controlled. Hooks peek through often, and the interplay between guitarists Kerry King and Jeff Hanneman is lively. Their trademark whinnying-horse solos are intact, and Lombardo still pushes the beat hard. ""Unit 731"" features some of his best drumming ever, with delightfully crackling fills. An extremely dry mix practically brings the listener into the room next to the band. This performance aspect is crucial to Slayer's success. Unlike, Metallica, whose drummer Lars Ulrich is inconsistent live, or Megadeth, who have settled into a monotonous precision, Slayer have retained their organic energy. They are one of the most electrifying musical units working today. This upfront sound is double-edged, however. It's thrilling to hear the band in such close audio quarters. But as a result, it loses some mystique. The production quirks of past albums helped give Slayer an aura. Hell Awaits, for example, indeed sounded hellish due to an excess of reverb. The tedious sludge of Diabolus in Musica had a certain charm. Although Rick Rubin's production on Slayer's classic trilogy (Reign in Blood, South of Heaven, Seasons in the Abyss) was dry, the songs still had a smoke-rising-in-the-distance quality. Now the band is aurally inches away from one's face. Additionally, the band has turned its attention from the underworld to the real world. ""Americon"", for example, condemns the U.S.' blood-for-oil foreign policy. Slayer being timely is not Slayer being timeless. But the way they're still playing, they sure sound like it.","The best album from thrash metal's Big Four (Metallica, Megadeth, Slayer, Anthrax) since the 1990s is fast, finely controlled, and nearly fat-free.

Beast Rest Forth Mouth,Bear in Heaven,by: Eric Harvey,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6cfb1335d7bf1698ef4/1:1/w_160/8321119f.gif,2009-11-09 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13618-beast-rest-forth-mouth/,Hometapes,"While it may seem as if there's not a new release without a hyphenated genre to give it birth, Bear in Heaven's second LP feels fresh simply because it resists easy categorization or comparison. This isn't to say it's sonically groundbreaking, though-- fitting for an album whose title references the four main navigational directions, Beast Rest Forth Mouth is as familiar-feeling as it is difficult to pinpoint. Mostly made up of textural, spacious three- to four-minute pop anthems with towering choruses, BRFM is a welcome reminder that an album doesn't have to be bombastic to feel huge and important. Take out the earbuds and let it fill a space: This is music that's bigger than your iPod-- music you'll want to feel all around you. Though not quite coming out of nowhere, BRFM seems like a surprise gift-- a striking consolidation of the spiky psych-prog tendencies of their debut into a pop framework. In terms of career gear-shifts, the move Caribou made with Andorra is the most recent precedent. Though at 41 minutes the album is economical and sharp in its execution, the band-- all from Georgia and Alabama-- still imbues its compositions with the generosity of spirit that makes the best Southern rock so invigorating. ""Beast in Peace"" opens the record with a gentle lockstep before shifting seamlessly into a mile-wide chorus. Then, they expand that chorus even further, like switching to the widest camera lens to capture a vista they just realized the full vastness of. Elsewhere, as its title indicates, ""Ultimate Satisfaction"" is an IMAX-wide ode to what starts out as a simple thought, then turns bodily-- the refrain of ""coming down!"" charts the sensation spreading like a spasm. That towering exultation is also felt on the primal ""Deafening Love"". While aiming for a similar sense of awe-inspiring bliss, ""Love"" widens the focus and luxuriates in the tremors, approximating a more protracted take on Jane's Addiction's ""Mountain Song"". Yet Bear in Heaven's greatest trick is creating music that evokes the sort of physicality and scope that could soundtrack a Hollywood film, but also works equally well at stirring up intimate bodily passion. Lush synth beds, warm electronics accenting polyrhythms, and Jon Philpot's yearning, boyish howl coalesce into a vibe that's muscular without being macho, and which strikes a rare balance between nuanced emotion and overwhelming sensation. Even when delving into more disconcerting subject matter-- dabbling in self-loathing on ""Wholehearted Mess"" or confronting paranoia on the slinky ""You Do You""-- Philpot still manages to imbue the songs with an atmosphere of seduction and intrigue. An album like BRFM couldn't exist without a paean to the most severe and high-stakes of endeavors, and first single ""Lovesick Teenagers"" more than meets the requirements for 2009's Epic Song About Tortured Young Romance. With briskly alternating synth chords spitting by like fast-moving highway stripes, the titular couple are doomed to crash, but most likely in a JG Ballard sort of way. The pair martyr themselves in order to eternalize their passion, and the band is generous enough to resurrect them later, in the reprise of ""Teenagers"" that closes the album, seamlessly and surprisingly emerging from ""Casual Goodbye"". As a gesture, it's a slight nod backwards to the suite-like structures of their debut, but moreoever a celebration of abundance that wraps up an album overflowing with feeling. It's also an exclamation point signaling that Bear in Heaven not only clearly recognize their own best instincts, they're not shy about dwelling on them. Sure, bands can adapt to the current musical climate by adding extras to LPs, tweaking release dates to accommodate fan interest, or even giving away their music free. A curtain call like ""Teenagers"", though: now that's generosity.","The second full-length from this Brooklyn band is a striking consolidation of the spiky psych-prog tendencies of its 2007 debut into a pop framework.

Everything Is New,Jack Peñate,by: Joshua Klein,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a69213d19756521391f5/1:1/w_160/b7080501.jpg,2009-11-06 06:00:04,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13565-everything-is-new/,XL,"If there's one thing the past decade achieved, it was further emphasizing the amorphous, ambiguous meaninglessness of the word ""pop."" After all, every artist, no matter how outré, wants people to listen to their records, and ideally as many people as possible. Sure, some make it easier and some make it harder, but no one wants their music to be ignored. Still, those who aspire to make pop music as such presumably value accessibility, and there are any number of tricks-- studio, stylistic, marketing-- one can enlist to pull that off. Yet it's an uphill slog if you don't have the songs to begin with, and on that front the relatively under-the-radar Jack Peñate has a leg up. This being the 21st century and all, Peñate's brand of pop is predictably broad. He's a soul singer, of sorts, but his voice is closer to a charming yelp than a smooth croon-- more Edwyn Collins or Terry Hall than, say, Jamie Lidell. His music, too, references horn-drenched R&B, but it also broadens its scope to include everything from Afropop to Tropicália. Best of all, it does so naturally, rarely coming off as some cynical or awkward train-jumping exercise. In this way Peñate's second album, Everything Is New, recalls 1980s UK pop at its most blinder-free: dance music that doesn't pander, globetrotting grooves that don't over-reach, songs hardly short on hooks but not smug about them, either. The title track, with its polyrhythmic percussion, strings, harps, and copious other overdubs, could have gone the overblown route, but as busy as it may be, it's never less than down to earth in its homebrew house party vibe. ""Pull My Heart Away"", ""So Near"", and ""Be the One"" explore different sides of soul, the former slower and more melancholy despite its handclaps and massed backing vocals, the latter two string-laden disco but far from unctuous in their historical references. ""Body Down"" is down-tempo jazzbo rock that makes room for backwards vocals and a noisy space guitar breakdown. When Peñate does incorporate non-Western elements, he does so minus the usual distracting assembly seams. ""Tonight's Today"" and ""Give Yourself Away"", for example, have as much West African funk in them as London club, but they don't sound like shallow fashion-parade pastiche. And when Peñate gets moody or weird, as he does on ""Every Glance"" and the herky-jerk ""Let's All Die"", respectively, he does so in keeping with the same sense of sophistication and stylistic scope that pervades and informs the rest of the album. It's harder to pull off than it sounds, but no less easy a listen for it. It's wide-eyed pop minus the fizz, demonstrating that sizzle can still be subtle.","The sophomore full-length from the UK singer-songwriter finds him broadening his palette to include textures from genres like Afropop and Tropicália.

Thriller,Part Chimp,by: Jason Crock,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6bfea9e61561daa5426/1:1/w_160/091ef32c.jpg,2009-11-06 06:00:03,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13604-thriller/,Rock Action,"London's loud, smart-assed Part Chimp have spent two studio albums and one compilation finding nuance in dirty, clobbering rock. In the four years since their last LP, they've offered the ""New Cross"" single, one of their sleekest and most bruising tracks, while it's B-sides showed the band at their most experimental (all of which ended up on 2007's Cup compilation). Now they're using their third LP to slow down, stretch out, and indulge their metal side a little more-- aside from the cheeky title, it almost sounds as if they want to be taken seriously. Opener ""Trad""'s title seems apt for the familiar ground it covers: simple, sludgy riffs and a swinging beat-- although the sludge is thicker, the tone more ominous, and the pace a little more trudging than their earlier work. While there's nothing here to disappoint their fans, the band does take some chances. ""Sweet T"" has the group playing in syncopated, palm-muted unison on every note. The tones on ""FFFFF"" are so distorted they sound as if they're breaking apart, while its central riff is a nauseating, teetering two-note circus ride. The song's abrupt outro provides an artful buildup to another left-turn: the simple and satisyfing wall-of-sludge ""Dirty Sun"", a skyscraper-sized anthem that serves as the album's high-water mark. Elsewhere, ""Tomorrow Midnite"" is a teasing, patient diversion that crawls to its inevitable climax. The dry, far-away tone of its opening minutes carries like the sound of an exhausted metal act coming from the rehearsal space down the hall, building to the singer's barely audible croak of simple, defeatist lyrics. ""Super Moody"" mostly lives up to its name, and its abrupt ending is less of a wry trick than an intentional experiment in dynamics, yet it's a little less fun because of it. ""Starpiss"" isn't the band's first 10-minute-long track, but, unlike B-side ""Hell Is Behind Me"", this one actually builds tension and lets the band finally release some of it in a fast and loose cacophony of snare hits and guitar soloing. No one's going to mistake Part Chimp for Isis, but getting a little slower and heavier, they've left some of their irreverent charm by the wayside. That charm was part of what made the band stand apart from its sludge-rock peers, but hearing Part Chimp continue to tweak the formula and expand upon it is still plenty rewarding.","On their third album, loud Londoners Part Chimp slow down, stretch out, and sometimes indulge their metal side a little more.

Turning the Mind,Maps,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6db5e6ef95969320e38/1:1/w_160/0bd9e9a3.jpg,2009-11-06 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13628-turning-the-mind/,Mute,"Typically, a good-but-not-great debut gets critically retrofitted as ""promising,"" but I'm not so sure that's apt for Maps' 2007 Mercury Prize-nominated We Can Create. It was certainly an auspicious beginning for leader James Chapman: I could go on trying to nail down what his electronically composed, beat-minded UK singer-songwriter format seeks to accomplish, but I'll just leave it at this: I've heard no less than three of his songs at a Banana Republic or someplace similar. But right away, his limitations were readily apparent, and they were not the kind that typically improve with age. There was little evidence that he might expand the range of his whispered wheeze and use lyrics for something more than placeholders, write another melody as intuitive as the slam-dunk hook on ""To the Sky"", or create an arrangement as swoony as that of ""Lost My Soul"". Turning the Mind doesn't build on those successes so much as offer a sort of fake-out. It's a more aerodynamically composed album than We Can Create, though there's still plenty of shoegazy gravy for your earbuds to sop up. Hooked up to headphones, you can hear how the intro of ""I Dream of Crystal"" manages to evoke the bookends of M83's discography, combining the icy funk guitars of ""Couleurs"" with the saturated synth buzz of Dead Cities, Red Seas & Lost Ghosts. On the other hand, the most immediate hooks on Turning the Mind come from a Saturdays=Youth rip so baldfaced (""Everything Is Shattering""), you figure that it was allowed to slide only because the two are on the same label. Elsewhere, Turning feels more distinctly European than its predecessor-- Chapman and producer Tim Holmes (Death in Vegas) embrace prevalent influences like French touch and Kraftwerk, but elsewhere they skew too glowsticky. ""Let Go of the Fear"" (not to be confused with We Can Create's ""Don't Fear"") is an embarrassing piece of Matrix-inspired cyberpunk dystopianism, while ""Love Will Come"" feels like little more than a five-minute vehicle for a two-second Faux-kenfold vocal trigger. Whether or not Turning the Mind is a more personal work than We Can Create is debatable, but Chapman certainly invests himself more in the lyrics. He's said that the album was inspired by the therapy school of Mindfulness, but what you'll mostly notice is how much it seems to be about drugs. As is the usual case when people decide to start writing about drugs, there are plenty of awkward baby steps here-- I don't think I have to explain why the title of ""Chemeleon"" isn't a typo. The Vaseline-smeared ""Valium in the Sunshine"" comes off like a soft-focus ad for its titular subject (""You make me feel good/ Just like I should""), while the robo-Teutonic narrator of ""Let Go of the Fear"" mutters about ""A cocaine fury/ Mother's little helper."" But more pointedly, lead single ""I Dream of Crystal"" shows how far Chapman has to go as a storyteller-- in the first verse, he's an invested observer of an abusive relationship (""But please don't hurt her, man/ Because I'll hit you as hard as I can/ But that ain't really the plan""), and next he's the defensive addict on the receiving end (""You can't knock what you've never done... so get the fuck off my case""). And then... he repeats, ""You can't change this state of mind,"" for nearly three minutes over a swollen foundation of synths, the lack of resolution coming off more like lazy songwriting than intentional ambiguity. If anything has carried over from We Can Create, it's Chapman's use of repetition-- the kind you lose your place in, not so much the kind you can get lost in. Over the span of its six minutes, the title track morphs from a hushed salutation to a multitracked maze of harmonies and ringing chords, but it doesn't build so much as blur, its direction preordained. ""Die Happy, Die Smiling"" has a juddering rhythm that shakes you out of the second half's generally slumberous arrangements, but its format is almost identical to the penultimate track from the last album as well-- two dodgy lines repeated over and over again (""It hurts my soul to know you're crying,"" rhymes with the title), but with little else to incur the pulverizing force of ""Don't Fear""'s saturated lead lines and joyous handclaps. Perhaps unintentionally, Turning the Mind feels chemical itself-- it's a cheap buzz that ultimately should have no problem finding its way into the wheelhouse of people who just can't get enough whooshy sound effects. But as Chapman tries to be therapeutic from the psychologist's couch instead of the mixing board, this shift on Turning puts him behind not just nu-gaze all-stars like M83 and the Big Pink, but also role players like Telefon Tel Aviv and Ulrich Schnauss. Then again, that might not be such a bad thing-- as Axl Rose's actions proved, you never know who's listening to this stuff.","Mercury-nominated producer with an ear for shoegaze textures returns with an album more invested in lyrics.

Broken,Soulsavers,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a68aea9e61561daa53bb/1:1/w_160/35377c0e.gif,2009-11-06 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13558-broken/,V2,"For most of the 2000s, Mark Lanegan has been a wandering samurai in search of a master. He released only two solo full-lengths and an EP this decade, and those have been handily overshadowed by his hired-gun work with Martina Topley Bird, Melissa Auf der Maur, and the Baldwin Brothers, as well as his collaborations with Greg Dulli and Isobel Campbell. He could easily take the lead on any of these projects, but Lanegan seems to think we'll like him better in small doses. That, or he's planning a sort of Yojimbo double-cross that will pit the Twilight Singers against Belle and Sebastian. Who knows where Soulsavers would come out in such a melee? The British duo-- Rich Machin and Ian Glover-- are something of an unknown quantity, especially on American shores. They formed in 2003 as an electronica outfit specializing in remixes for bands iike Starsailor and Doves. Their distinguishing characteristic seems to be their fascination with American traditional forms, texturing their songs with buzzy threads of blues, gospel, folk, and jazz. Reportedly, touring behind their second album, It's Not How Far You Fall, It's the Way You Land, shifted their priorities even further, away from programmed beats and toward live instrumentation to create a cinematic atmosphere on Broken, their third album and second with Lanegan. If How Far You Fall was formatted to fit your screen, then Broken is in CinemaScope. Spaghetti-western strings swell and shiver on ""Shadows Fall"", guitars grind vigorously on the Gene Clark cover ""Some Misunderstanding"", stray synthesizer blips shoot through ""Death Bells"" like sparks, and a lone piano provides an almost gothic solemnity on the Palace Brothers cover ""You Will Miss Me When I Burn"". The record features a sizable cast that includes Jason Pierce of Spiritualized, Mike Patton of Faith No More, Richard Hawley, and Gibby Haynes of the Butthole Surfers, and Australian newcomer Red Ghost, aka Rosa Agostino. Entering late in the album, she makes a good supporting actress, her smooth voice a nice compliment to Lanegan's rougher textures on ""Rolling Sky"". Perhaps she'll get more screen time on the sequel. Lanegan, however, remains our main protagonist, roaming Soulsavers' musical landscape mostly in isolation. His miles-of-bad-road voice is an obvious match for Soulsavers' gothic Americanisms, and he sounds like just another instrument in their arsenal, communicating meaning via sound more than lyrics. That's a good use of him, especially when his lyrics veer toward Biblical overstatement, as on ""All the Way Down"" when he sings about ""crystalline dawn"" and ""six white horses."" Also, there's this gem from ""Can't Catch the Train"": ""Sure as the shovel is blind, deaf, and digging/ One day you're alone at the end of your road."" And that's perhaps the problem with Broken: Too often its soundtrack atmosphere is too thick, its arrangements as obvious as a painted backdrop. The strings sound too much like Morricone, and ""Wise Blood"" recalls the quieter moments from Trevor Jones and Randy Edelman's score for The Last of the Mohicans more than the John Huston movie. On ""Unbalanced Pieces"" the whispered backing vocals dogging Lanegan have all the spooky effect of a horror trailer, and the menacing bassline is both seedy and Bad Seed-y, which only reinforces the unflattering comparison with the recent soundtrack work of Nick Cave and Warren Ellis. In trying to literalize the often dismissive term ""soundtrack rock,"" Soulsavers emphasize the former to the neglect of the latter.","Mark Lanegan again teams with UK electronic vets, with guest spots from Spiritualized's Jason Pierce, Mike Patton, Richard Hawley, and Gibby Haynes.

Warp20 (Box Set) / Warp20 (Chosen) / Warp20 (Recreated) / Warp20 (Unheard),Various Artists,by: Scott Plagenhoef,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a70cea9e61561daa54d7/1:1/w_160/c0fa2b6f.gif,2009-11-06 06:00:00,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13668-warp20-box-set-warp20-chosen-warp20-recreated-warp20-unheard/,Warp,"Kode9's dubstep label Hyperdub is celebrating its fifth anniversary this year with a two-disc compilation. Venerable Berlin techno imprint Get Physical is turning seven, while the even more beloved Cologne label Kompakt is 10. In the fickle world of electronic music, any anniversary it seems is worth noting. Warp Records-- at 20, almost as old as all three put together-- is doing it right with an expansive, expensive-looking (and, ok, expensive) box set, some elements of which are available separately. Let's be frank about the overall package: It is in no way for the casual fan. But was it ever going to be? Warp, aware that a 20th anniversary collection couldn't work as both an introduction and a want/need item for its rabid fans, wisely went all in on the latter. If music is now, to many, free, and the draw of a music product is everything but the music, Warp embraced this dilemma: Yes / Dan Holdsworth (designers of the box itself) and the label's longtime visual collaborators at the Designers Republic (who are responsible for much of the art inside of it) have created what amounts to a fetish object. Housed in a 10"" slipcase, this thing has physical heft; and with a 192-page book detailing the complete visual history to date of the label, the full Warp set looks more like an item for your shelf. Even the CDs are housed in case-bound 10"" folders rather than delicate little sleeves. Inside the box, aside from the perfect-bound book, are five sets of music, three of which are also available on their own. Warp20 (Chosen), is a 2xCD set featuring 10 songs selected by warp.net users (from a pre-selected pool) and 10 selected by Warp co-founder Steve Beckett. Warp20 (Recreated) is a 2xCD collection of new covers of Warp songs by Warp artists. Each of those are out now. Warp20 (Unheard)-- which comes in the box as a 3x10"" set but starting November 9 will be available on its own as a single CD or LP (as well as included as a digital add-on for box-set purchasers)-- is an 11-song gathering of unreleased tracks from Warp stars such as Boards of Canada, Autechre, Broadcast, and Plaid. Also included in the box is Warp20 (Elemental), a 65-minute mix of Warp songs by Osymsyo, and Warp20 (Infinite), a 2x10"" set of locked grooves. The original packaging for Warp's IDM template Artificial Intelligence wondered, ""Are you sitting comfortably?"" before claiming that the record of home-listening electronic music was for, among other things, ""quiet nights."" The same could be said of this set, which works best when you allow yourself to live in it, to fully explore the label rather than simply skim off the top of it. That's true of any vinyl experience to a degree, but Warp's collection is a true pairing of art and sound, rather than one being supplemental to the other. The steady avoidance of fashionable, ephemeral stylistic choices in favor of clean, classic lines and colors makes the look of the set seem remarkably timeless and universal. This is particularly impressive for an electronic imprint, which avoided the temptation to look futuristic or au courant, and has allowed the label to retain a look from earliest singles by Forgemasters and Nightmares on Wax through their 10th and now 20th anniversary sets. When Warp did this whole thing 10 years ago, before the full impact of file-sharing, the music was the thing. Back then, Warp compiled three 2xCD sets-- one of non-Warp techno and house classics, mostly from the half-decade that immediately preceded their label's launch; one of the label's top work; and one of Warp artists remixing songs from the Warp catalogue. If you somehow have not yet heard Warp's music, that actually might be a better place to start, since you'll therefore almost certainly not have also heard the Chicago and Detroit pioneers that populate that set's first disc. But it's also true that Warp in part succeeded because it hasn't been beholden and overly reverent to the pioneers of techno and house. It avoided the dead end of traditionalism by both breaking from electronic music's dancefloor utilitarianism and embracing artists with wit and charisma over the sometimes monochromatic communalism favored by techno's more faceless producers. It's no surprise then that Warp found many fans outside of dance: Its colorful music tends to emphasize shifts and melodies and complex rhythm structures over the more subtle builds and crescendos of repetitive dance. As Warp has became an influence on rock and hip-hop-- Radiohead most famously championed the label around the turn of the millennium-- the label wisely invited pop-structured acts that carried the spirit and sensibility of electronic music into its fold. It now boasts a roster of not only top-notch electronic producers but also the fussy, prim indie of Grizzly Bear, the loose-limbed modern soul of Jamie Lidell, the haunted, avant-pop of Broadcast, and the askew hip-hop and wonky of Flying Lotus. Picking out highlights from the 20 years would be nearly impossible, so thankfully the label has done it for me. The half of Warp20 (Chosen) selected by fans is music of extremely high quality, but it is also the least essential aspect of the box set. If you're interested in paying for the set, or even if you're interested in adventurous modern music, you're probably pretty well versed in most of its contents. The results of the vote provided the 10 tracks here, and unfortunately older tracks were undervalued, and arguably novelty was overvalued. The fan vote disc is complemented by a disc of tracks chosen by Beckett, which breaks up some of the predictability of the choices and thankfully provides spots for first-decade favorites like Nightmares on Wax, Seefeel, and Black Dog Productions (here recording as Xeper). Boards of Canada, Squarepusher, Battles, and Aphex Twin make second appearances on the set, but those Beckett-chosen selections provide alternate looks at the work of each, and aren't obvious song selections. The exclusion of more primitive early tracks from artists like Sweet Exorcist, Forgemasters, and Tricky Disco is slightly regrettable. But considering that Warp10's best of, Warp10+2, was limited to tracks from 1989-92 it makes some sense, allowing these discs to work practically as a Volume 2 to that set, with only LFO's ""LFO (Leeds Warehouse Mix)"" and Nightmare on Wax's ""I'm for Real"" appearing on both. Warp20 (Recreated) is the most grab-baggy thing here, at times leaving you wondering why this is a set of covers rather than remixes (see Luke Vibert's take on ""LFO"" for one). Not surprisingly, the tracks here work best when artists start with material that isn't within their comfort zone. Nightmares on Wax's slinky version of the stiff ""Hey Hey Can U Relate?"" is a marvel. Elsewhere, Mira Calix and Autechre manage to re-work Boards of Canada and LFO, respectively, without losing either a sense of the original or their own sensibilities. Gravenhurst's take on Broadcast's ""I Found the F"" and Born Ruffians' deconstruction of Aphex Twin's ""Milkman/To Cure a Weakling Child"" are odd clashes on paper that turn out to be highlights. Leila continues the decade-long rehabilitation of Aphex Twin's Drukqs album with a moody, hollow, piano-led take on ""Vordhosbn"", while Jimi Tenor is one of the few artists here who unearthed a relatively lost gem with his redo of Drexciya-related project Elecktroids' ""Japanese Electronics"". More on-the-nose things like Jamie Lidell's take on Grizzly Bear's ""Little Brother"" or Tim Exile's take on Lidell's ""A Little Bit More"" don't seem necessary. Osymyso's mix provides a solid overview of the whole label, highlighting the strong universal sensibilities of the founders. Best known for providing himself rigid constructs (his ""Intro-Inspection"" takes the starts of 100 pop songs and combines them into one 12-minute marvel) and changing out tracks quickly, here Osymyso wisely relaxes and lets the tracks play. Warp devotees can still enjoy trainspotting song titles, but if things moved at the pace of some of Osymyso's other work it wouldn't give the less initiated a chance to catch up and locate sounds and shifts. With deft pacing and relative seamless mixing, it also rewards long after that first listen. The unreleased set, Warp20 (Unheard), is limited to 11 well-chosen tracks. The new Boards of Canada song ""Seven Forty Seven"" sounds like Boards of Canada and you're reminded why these guys own this hazy, nostalgic sound. Broadcast, too, have tossed aside the retro albatross and become one of the more singular and consistently excellent artists of our time, and their contribution, ""Sixty Forty"", keeps the winning streak going. Clark provides the too-short ""Rattlesnake"", Flying Lotus stretches out a bit on the bleary-eyed ""Tronix"", and Plaid and Nightmares on Wax each provide a pair of songs. The most consistent record in sound and tone, Warp20 (Unheard) recalls the feel of the Artificial Intelligence comps that helped secure Warp's fame. The locked grooves disc, Warp20 (Infinite), is obviously a specialty item. But with so many of these tracks built on repetition to start, it's a natural albeit esoteric fit. And if you ever wanted to play ""Atlas"" by Battles or ""On"" by Aphex Twin forever, now you can. Hilariously, this leaked as mp3s for some reason. Warp has long staked out its own ground online, fussy and protective of its product. The label opened its own Warpmart early in the digital music era rather than do so via a third party, and it doesn't seem to subscribe to the idea that just offering free shit all over the web is good for its artists. Part of the reason is Warp's big wigs care about sound and presentation, and it shows. Warp20 (Box) is another reminder of the thought that goes into what they do-- not just the records they release, but the total package of the label. It's one reason they've survived for two decades. Another reason, aside from the obvious (a good ear; a willingness to regard their artists as family, giving them license to record at their own pace without regard for their bankability), is that they've slowly and organically adapted to the growing indie and dance worlds. Nominally known first as a center for the blippier end of rave, and then as the home of IDM, Warp has made wise, cautious steps toward embracing other sounds and styles. IDM itself, seen as a fad with a sneered-at tag, has proved endurable. Indeed, one of the stories of indie this decade is that mocked sounds from the margins-- freak-folk, dance-punk, electroclash/nu-rave-- wound up becoming central to the whole. IDM is practically the grandfather of this trend, and the best of its music outlasted the name, until the textures and sounds that once necessitated new descriptions no longer had to be boxed in. If Boards of Canada, Squarepusher, Authechre, Black Dog/Plaid, and Aphex Twin may have once been IDM musicians, today they're just individual artists making beloved music, more known for their own singular styles than as part of an umbrella trend. Warp has outlasted conceptual and contextual constructs in ways that are rare in the electronic world, where music is often tagged as easily dated. Throughout Warp's history, care in the construction of sound is important, so are syncopated rhythms, wit and whimsy, and the blending the abstract and the melodic. In the end, that there are no shortcuts to defining a Warp sound; that they are a fully trusted brand name that doesn't embrace 21st century eclecticism for the hell of it is admirable and rare. It may have been unthinkable 20 years ago that an electronic music imprint would still be around today, but it's no surprise Warp made it. And if music labels are still around in another 20, it would be no surprise if Warp was one of the survivors of these times as well.","Warp celebrates 20 years in business with a massive box set collection.

When the Devil's Loose,A.A. Bondy,by: David Raposa,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6539d034d5c69bf34ea/1:1/w_160/aacf3cda.jpg,2009-11-05 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13509-when-the-devils-loose/,Fat Possum,"While A.A. Bondy realizes that acknowledging his tenure as Verbena frontman Scott Bondy could help shift a few units, that doesn't mean his former life is a point of pride. This is how a writer describes Bondy's indie-rock days in the singer/songwriter's Fat Possum bio: ""He told me that he used to go by the name Scott and had played in a Rock'n'Roll group went by the name Verbena. I asked him what that was like and he muttered something about being an infant in a crib full of bats."" Still, for A.A. Bondy to now exist, Scott Bondy had to go through that ill-fated bat-crib phase. And despite the sonic differences and the name change-- the A.A. stands for Auguste Arthur-- there's an obvious through-line to be drawn between then and now. Where the old Bondy took his cues from all sorts of rock'n'roll progenitors (classic and otherwise), the new Bondy cribs notes from the blues and country folks that influenced those rock'n'rollers. And where the old Bondy would sometimes show his hand too blatantly, the new Bondy is playing his cards with greater aplomb and much greater skill. When the Devil's Loose, A.A. Bondy's second album, is evident of this ever-growing skill. But that's not to say there isn't room to grow. In many ways, When's the Devil's Loose is nearly the same as 2007's American Hearts. Bondy's warm and weathered moan is used to good effect, abetted by some down-home instrumentation and a fair helping of flattering reverb, all in the service of songs that do their damnedest to recall a more agrarian time-- coal burning in a train furnace, rivers running free, pines dancing in the moonlight. Loose puts its best foot forward right from the start, with ""Mightiest of Guns"". If any tune on this album deserves to be called ""Dylanesque"" (possibly the most unbearably portentous modifier/ honorarium thrown in Bondy's direction), it's this one, with its plainspoken torrent of elusive yet evocative images-- ""And the shadows go like ghosts across your rope/ Or take the world and burn it in a spoon."" Each verse offers its own portrait of quotidian drama enlivened by Bondy's wracked croon and tasteful strokes of arcing guitar. The rest of the album offers downtrodden pleasures in a similar vein-- see the elegiac ""To the Morning"", or the player-piano balladry of ""On the Moon"". Even when Bondy's band kicks up its heels, as on the relatively ebullient ""I Can See the Pines Are Dancing"", it's doing so through a weary hard-livin' haze. Still, the music never suffers for the song's overall sorrow. Where Loose does suffer, if only slightly, is in its words. Think back on the image of an infant trapped in a crib full of bats-- it's definitely colorful, and reads off-the-cuff, but there's something a little off about it, like it's trying too hard to be colorful and off-the-cuff. The bio's first line, an introduction that could be framed as a not-so-sly jab at folks like yours truly, suggests it's the singer/songwriter himself is sitting at the typewriter: ""I don't know much about music, so I guess that makes me an expert."" Regardless, it's the sense of desperately trying to sell one's self as authentic, rather than simply acting the part, that undercuts what Loose does so well. More often than not, the music and the mood can make any potential lyrical faux pas a non-issue-- ""A Slow Parade"" and the title track falls into pat fire/desire rhyme patterns, but Bondy's voice smooths over those rough edges and sells the tunes' worry and desperation like a carny selling tickets to the egress. And while Bondy's awkward deployment of colloquialisms like ""a-callin'"" and ""a-cryin'"" in ""Oh the Vampyre"" almost steers the tune into True Blood fanfic territory, the succinctness of a line like, ""You know I could drink the world/ And never get my fill,"" rings as true as anything. But talk of ""a Mississippi night"" (on ""The Mercy Wheel"") or ""the cars of silver and gold"" (on ""The Coal Hits the Fire"") comes off like all-hat no-cattle flourishes from someone trying to pull a fast one. They're placeholder phrases that a more experienced and exacting writer would backtrack and replace, yet Bondy uses them to embellish, if not illuminate, his songs. That Bondy shows a fair amount of evidence on Loose of being the sort of exacting writer that could effortlessly avoid these pitfalls makes such missteps all the more disappointing. And that Bondy can still conjure up a collection of evocative and intriguing songs that succeeds despite this only augurs well for his future.","The second solo album from the one-time Verbena frontman continues his obsession with rough-hewn imagery and earthy song structures.

In the Gardens of the North,Sleeping States,by: David Raposa,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a673b1335d7bf1698e24/1:1/w_160/6ba47568.jpg,2009-11-05 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13539-in-the-gardens-of-the-north/,Bella Union,"It's only fitting that the first thing you hear on In The Gardens of the North is Markland Starkie's voice. After all, collaborators and live-show bandmates notwithstanding, Sleeping States is Markland Starkie. The ""group"" began as a self-sufficient one-man operation back in 2004, though enough people eventually got hip to Starkie's potent and heady lo-fi brew that he didn't need to continue self-releasing his music. It doesn't hurt that some of these folks have impeccable pedigrees-- members of Grizzly Bear and the Klaxons have given Sleeping States some free press, and the label that currently pays Starkie, Bella Union, is run by former Cocteau Twin Simon Raymonde. Gardens is actually Sleeping States' second Bella Union release-- the first was an EP, Old vs. New, wherein Starkie re-recorded some of his older tunes. Even at only five songs, its stylistic careening between gussied-up punkish fervor and soothing indie-rockery showed Starkie to be as restless and precocious as he is talented, and served as an appropriate portrait of what Sleeping States were at that point. But one listen to ""Rings of Saturn"", the first track off Gardens, and the notion of Sleeping States as the brainchild of a pastoral yet hyper-caffeinated lo-fi mad scientist quickly falls away. Starkie sings in a breathless lilting croon, a voice that might remind some of a less bombastic Rufus Wainwright. Most of the song is just Starkie gracefully navigating a halting and beguiling melody as a bass guitar is steadily strummed. The words he sings are equally beguiling, offering haunting images of ""bones of lost towns"" and ""the coast at your cheek,"" which lend the song a nostalgic and melancholy air. The circular guitar figure that enters after a minute of this adds to the mood. But this gentle setting is gradually intruded upon-- first by a queasy bed of feedback, then (courtesy of Rose Clark, Starkie's only collaborator on Gardens) rolling, crashing drums. These interlopers slowly emerge from the background of the song like shadowy figures walking out of a thick fog. Soon Starkie stops singing, and lets the intruders have their way. While all this is going on, however, the bass remains steadfast, weathering this ever-growing storm, playing the same sequence of notes it's played since the track began. As the noise slowly relents, Starkie's voice returns, offering more fragmented phrases that ache with an unspecified longing-- ""every day, so many times, we never see you anymore,"" ""this is what you let us see,"" ""impressions of the morning sun""-- until the song reaches a resigned conclusion. ""Rings of Saturn"" covers a lot of ground in its five minutes, ground that Starkie's previous work merely hinted at in passing, if ever. If this track was meant to introduce listeners to a more mature and self-assured Sleeping States, then they made one hell of a first impression. Gardens finds Starkie ably synthesizing lessons learned from his DIY home-taping years into fully-realized songs of all shapes and sizes. It's to his credit as a songwriter that the weakest tracks on Gardens are a) the most ordinary and b) weak only in comparison to their surroundings. Perfectly fine tunes like ""Red King"" or ""The Cartographer"" might be highlights on someone else's record, but they pale in comparison to the magic Starkie works throughout the rest of the album. When he cuts away from the pensive tension he's been building in ""Showers in Summer"" to let the song briefly pause and breathe, switching from tight snare rolls and expectant guitar plucking to gentle rushes of cymbal and guitar picking, it's like the sun briefly breaking through the clouds as the rain relents. ""Breathing Space"" is that moment of pause and reflection extended, Starkie filling the space with casual strums of guitar, the ambient noise of a lazy city street, and his enviable voice multi-tracked behind him, posing as an acrobatic angelic chorus. His voice being his best instrument, Starkie wisely employs it as much as he can, and often to fantastic effect. Nowhere is this more apparent than on the pseudo-title track, ""Gardens of the South"". In some ways, the track's sparseness mirrors that of ""Rings of Saturn"", except that in this case it's the drums providing the song's steady rhythm as multiple Starkies sweetly swoon and dive around the narrator's unabashed and unapologetic desire-- ""When you ask if I've been saying too much/ I reply, 'I can tell by your eyes and your hands/ That you haven't said enough.'"" If there's anything negative to say about Gardens, it's that it doesn't lend itself to casual listening. These restless and nearly immaculate tales of love and longing, when taken in as a whole, might blend together to form a tastefully indistinct blur. That was never an issue in Sleeping States' past, when an album would change gears without either hesitation or purpose. The closest this album comes to offering that sort of pace-change is with the ever-so-brief guitar squeal that opens ""On the Beach at Aldeburgh"". But exchanging that sort of free-and-easy inconsistency for a steadier and more stately hand, if it leads to works like this, is a trade-off worth making at every opportunity. The restless spirit that fueled Markland Starkie's previous work is still present. It's just being expressed in a way that demands your attention instead of distracting it. And the attention that In the Gardens of the North demands, it rewards tenfold.","Bandleader Markland Starkie transforms lessons learned from his DIY home-taping years into fully-realized songs of all shapes and sizes.

Ay Ay Ay,Matias Aguayo,by: Andrew Gaerig,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a7089d034d5c69bf36c4/1:1/w_160/624666ca.jpg,2009-11-05 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13664-ay-ay-ay/,Kompakt,"This review was going to write itself: ""Matias Aguayo killed minimal dead,"" it would read, this on the heels of Aguayo's 2008 star turn, ""Minimal"", in which he convicted his home genre of growing stale. It was an easy plotline: The man who helped popularize and expand minimal-- a seminal contributor, as one half of Closer Musik, to Kompakt's early discography, and author of 2005's still-underheard Are You Really Lost-- would, with Ay Ay Ay, re-order our expectations for minimal's future. Ay Ay Ay explodes that meme, however, with an album so far removed from Aguayo's past-- it's a record of maximal, fermented oddity-- that it borders on the bizarre. Ay Ay Ay is an album composed mostly of the human voice, continuing Aguayo's penchant for silly/sexy singspeak but filling out the rest of the compositions with throaty squelches, triple-tracked a cappella nonsense, and sampled chants. More than simply ""that techno guy who sings,"" Aguayo seems to have developed a childlike fascination with the human voice on par with Timbaland, Rahzel, or (frequent collaborator) DJ Koze. Because of its sparse percussion, preponderance of voices-- chatting, yelling, singing-- and Chilean-born Aguayo's tendency to sing in Spanish, Ay Ay Ay often feels like world music, though less in a 1980s-Borders-Books-and-Music-endcap sense and more because it sounds well-traveled and totally foreign. Foreign as in unfamiliar: Ay Ay Ay sounds like no other album this year, and it's no stretch to say it's one of the most out-of-character releases ever for Kompakt. Any discussion of musical influence almost seems superfluous, however, as Aguayo spends much of Ay Ay Ay proving his credentials as an inspired goofball. Lead track ""Menta Latte"", which barrels out of the gate with whumping bass voices, sounds like a group of skilled six year-olds putting Saturday morning to song. ""Koro Koro"" is Soweto-style pop undercut by compressed, clacking beats. The title track is stepping tropic pop. The clingy ""Rollerskate"" is disarmingly coherent in its form and presumed function: it sounds like rollerskating. ""Rollerskate"" is easily the most parse-able jam; I don't speak Spanish, but Aguayo's history indicates that the rest of the lyrics are husky shit-talk and/or crappy come-ons. It's hard to wonder what else would fit into the hum-hum-grind of ""Desde Rusia"" or the Talking-Heads-on-E of ""Ritmo Tres"". If Aguayo's electronic background rears its head, it does so abstractly, as long stretches of the hour-long Ay Ay Ay can dissolve into prattling sound-soups, the clicks and thumps of the producer's previous work replaced with tongue-snaps and party favor whoops (""Mucho Viento""). Despite the expectations for the record, Ay Ay Ay doesn't redraw the lines of minimal electronic music. Naturally, it's not trying to. It does reroute our conception of Aguayo, however. Ay Ay Ay is a sticky-sweet, unbounded mess, but only the priggish and unimaginative will hold that against it.","Kompakt star and former Closer Musik member returns with a record of maximal oddity, an album far from his minimal roots.

Invisible Girl,The King Khan & BBQ Show,by: Paul Thompson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a63ac0084474cd0c08ed/1:1/w_160/102a2e58.jpg,2009-11-05 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13484-invisible-girl/,In the Red,"Chuck Berry had ""My Ding-a-Ling"", AC/DC had ""Big Balls"", King Missile had ""Detachable Penis""; perhaps, for the song title ""Tastebuds"", we should thank King Khan and Mark ""BBQ"" Sultan for their discretion. The tune, the seventh track on the shuffly garage-rockers' third LP together, is a disarmer no matter your take on it; without ruining the surprise, the tastebuds in question are attached all over the nether quarters, allowing for some heretofore unknown pleasures. It's not half as funny as Khan and Sultan think it is, but it is precisely as catchy as they think it is. If their goal was to get me to walk around my apartment describing the new sensations in my bathing-suit area, well, mission accomplished, gents. Both Khan and Sultan are as good as anybody at brushing 40-odd years of dust off old Nuggets tropes; since their last meeting on wax, 2006's What's For Dinner?, Khan and his Shrines and Sultan by his lonesome have each crafted one heck of a snarling platter of 1960s-indebted rock'n'roll. But there was also the recent debacle from the Almighty Defenders, an ""evil gospel"" supergroup featuring Khan, Sultan, and the Black Lips that boasted of its quick conception while failing to address how slapdash the end product felt. It's easy to see why they were confident in pulling that off: Khan's a stupendously stylish vocalist, able to ape everybody from the Big Bopper to Otis Redding without losing a move, and Sultan's got some ear for compact arrangements and clever melodic interjections. There's a swagger here borne out of totally earned confidence; these dudes are good, and they know it. But confidence can take on ugly forms from time to time, and it does get a little grisly on Invisible Girl; sometimes you feel like these guys were just a bit too cocky in their abilities to finish writing the damn song. It's easy to become taken in by opener ""Anala"", what with Khan's ooh-mow-mows and Sultan's surprisingly sweet croon. The somewhat curious but nevertheless successful title track comes next; eschewing the chug'n'thwomp for which they're both noted in favor of a straightahead shimmer that suggests both the Byrds and the La's, it's a lovingly crafted tune and perhaps a hint at a new direction, only slightly out of step with the other material here. From there, it's throwback time, as Khan and Sultan navigate the divide between Little Anthony and the Seeds. Throughout, it's Sultan's voice that stands out-- particularly on the slow-burning, ""Still of the Night""-like ""Third Ave.""-- among everything, sweet and shape-shifting next to Khan's gruntier style. The Sultan-led tunes tend to be less aggressive than Khan's, which is odd; not for Sultan, who handles himself admirably as a singer and player throughout Invisible Girl, but for Khan, whose does best when he's got a little more space to work with. Among the sharp shocks of ""Truth or Dare"" or ""Lonely Boy"", he sounds perfunctory, rushed. Something you might say about even the best stuff on Invisible Girl. Khan and Sultan move between the trappings of doo-wop to skid rock so fitfully it's easy to miss that some of these tunes aren't all there lyrically. Once the guffaws stop, it can get a little predictable. Songs like ""Spin the Bottle"" and ""I'll Be Loving You"" are indebted to a period in music that was by and large not its most fertile poetically, but for all their musical formalism, they're obviously irreverent cats-- remember ""Tastebuds""? It's just too bad, for every ""Animal Party"" or ill-fated game of ""Spin the Bottle"" and well-placed anatomical joke there's one too many tunes that just go through the motions, and old ones at that. Still, the tunes on Invisible Girl work, because Khan and Sultan's love of the music they're ripping off is obvious and infectious, and because they've got a knack for capturing the feel of the records they're taking cues from most throwbacks can't quite muster. Sam the Sham would be proud; that is, if he's cool with dick jokes.","Shaking off the Almighty Defenders misstep, King Khan and Mark Sultan collaborate for another distillation of Nuggets and Brit Invasion rock.

Phrazes for the Young,Julian Casablancas,by: Ryan Dombal,Features Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a70b13d197565213930b/1:1/w_160/64e61d83.jpg,2009-11-05 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13666-phrazes-for-the-young/,RCA,"In 2002, the Strokes played their song ""Take It or Leave It"" on ""The Late Show With David Letterman"". The performance was so incredible it almost seems unfair. In it, a 23-year old Julian Casablancas manhandled his mic stand, eyed the camera with a hypnotic mix of rage and anxiety, and tugged at his jacket as if he was about to burst. At one point, Casablancas swatted his mic down and left the stage in a huff only to return exactly as guitarist Albert Hammond, Jr. wrapped up a brief solo. Chaos; control. At the end of the song, the singer tripped, completely wiped out in the middle of the stage, and somehow ended up even cooler for it. The ""Letterman"" blitz showed the Strokes at full tilt-- a rock band that set the pace for what a rock band should look, sound, and feel like in a new millennium. In 2009, a 31-year-old Julian Casablancas played his solo song ""11th Dimension"" with a band that wasn't the Strokes on ""The Tonight Show With Conan O'Brien"". The performance just seemed unfair. In it, the singer had no mic stand, eyed the camera as if he were scared and/or lost, and hunched through some of the song like he was trying to hide himself. At one point, he awkwardly pretended to roll some dice. During an atrocious circus-organ solo, Casablancas just idled in the middle of the stage. There was no chance of him falling over because he barely moved. Perhaps it's unfair to gauge Casablancas against his younger self, but this is a star whose entire currency is based on a youthful brand of Lower East Side punk rebellion that's too cool to actually rebel. Considering the uncertain future of the Strokes-- ""a band is a good way to break up a friendship,"" said Casablancas in a recent interview-- and the fact that the group's last album, 2006's First Impressions of Earth, was something of a shit sandwich, there's more riding on the singer's solo bow than he'd probably like to admit. Phrazes for the Young is a jumble of contradictions. The music and artwork is steeped in 1970s and 1980s tropes yet also vaguely futuristic. The words are apocalyptic, depressing, and sometimes worthy of a zen self-help manual, and while there are only eight songs, this thing seems to go on forever. The ""Conan"" performance was not a momentary blunder-- this album is overstuffed with production do-dads, yet disappointingly devoid of anything coming close to the sort of tossed-off brilliance this guy used to come up with during an afternoon nap. The title of Phrazes for the Young was based on a series of Oscar Wilde one-liners called Phrases and Philosophies for the Use of the Young. Among the witticisms are gems like, ""Pleasure is the only thing one should live for. Nothing ages like happiness,"" and ""In all unimportant matters, style, not sincerity, is the essential. In all important matters, style, not sincerity, is the essential."" But instead of continuing with Wilde's flighty ""words of wisdom,"" Casablancas takes the ""from on high"" elder statesman attitude but ditches any and all traces of humor. So we get a batch of anti-pleasure, anti-happiness parables that are often too sincere for their own good. Opener ""Out of the Blue"" has Casablancas reeling off a list of downers-- sadness, bitterness, anger, vengeance-- before settling with premature nostalgia: ""All that I can do is sing a song of faded glory,"" he admits. Meanwhile, ""Left & Right in the Dark"" is even more dire as the singer offers lines like, ""We're in a race against time, and time might be winning,"" before imploring the world at large (or is it himself?) to ""Wake up! Wake up! Wake up! Wake up!"" Here's another Wilde phrase worth re-reading: ""Dullness is the coming of age of seriousness."" Produced by Jason Lader (Rilo Kiley, Maroon 5) and Mike Mogis (Bright Eyes), the album is comically slick and bouncy when it's not offering five-minute industrial-synth clusterfucks (""River of Brakelights"") or slow-motion dirges (""Tourist""). Broken free of the stylistic constraints that come with the Strokes, Casablancas makes the classic rookie solo mistake of stuffing his songs with everything in the studio while never stepping back and realizing that a six-minute, country-synth historical lament in honor of Manhattan's Ludlow St. may be a few twangy guitar solos and plodding hooks too much. The record fares best when channeling Cyndi Lauper or the Eurythmics while keeping the tempo close to jumpy. Offstage, ""11th Dimension"" pumps along with endearing silliness, even if Casablancas claims he's stuck ""on the frozen surface of a fireball"" on the track. And the gorgeous electro ballad ""Glass"" finds something lovely amidst a world sadly insulated by bulletproof windows. The irony is that Phrazes for the Young is so smoothed over-- nearly all of Casablancas' trademark vocal roughness is airbrushed into oblivion-- it instantly sounds like a plexiglass-covered museum piece. At their best, the Strokes had no trouble adding spontaneity to their meticulously arranged pop-rock songs. Phrazes leaves no room for such spur-of-the-moments. And, when coupled with Casablancas' often-suffocating, old-timer sentiments, the record allows itself only brief glimmers of life. ""The ages live in history through their anachronisms,"" wrote Wilde in his Phrases and Philosophies. And, at this rate, this one-time wunderkind risks becoming little more than an emblem of the past if he can't figure out how to harness the present once again.","Strokes singer makes his solo bow with a record of post-millennial synth-pop.

Midnight Soul Serenade,Heavy Trash,by: Stephen M.

Midnight Soul Serenade is their third album together as Heavy Trash, and the duo continue to reinterpret the King of Rock'n'Roll and his early-rock noblemen as raunchy, bug-eyed Ralph Bakshi cartoons. That's not to say their schtick isn't schtick or that it doesn't constantly threaten to expire on every song. Even Presley, perhaps the least introspective rock musician ever, evolved and developed from 1956 to 77. Meanwhile, Spencer still whoops it up like he did a quarter-century ago. That's why Verta-Ray makes such a good foil for him-- even more dynamic than the Dickinson brothers or even the Sadies. The former Madder Rose bass player and Blues Explosion touring member either draws out more nuance from Spencer or allows Spencer to draw it out himself, but without watering down his delivery. That makes Heavy Trash his most successful project this decade, or at least the one that most inventively restages his schtick. Compared to Spencer Dickinson or even JSBX, the range of styles and sounds on Midnight Soul Serenade­ is anarchic, full of goofing-around (but never winking) allusions to Sun Studio, Louisiana Hayride, Muscle Shoals, and juvenile delinquent films, as well as more than a few side glances toward contemporaries like the Flat Duo Jets, the White Stripes, and, ahem, Southern Culture on the Skids. Out of the gate, ""Gee, I Really Love You"" cribs off the Dixie Cups' cheat sheet, turning their ""Chapel of Love"" into a lascivious wedding-night come-on. On ""Good Man"", the duo hire the chain gang from either Sam Cooke's ""Chain Gang"" or Tennessee Ernie Ford's ""Sixteeen Tons"", as if to let you know how effortless it is. On the other hand, proximity to Link Wray (the stalled ""Pimento"" and the rattletrap ""Sweet Little Bird"") just shows how hard they have to work. What saves Heavy Trash in general and Midnight Soul Serenade­ in particular is their unironic jocularity. For them, rock is supposed to be fun and freeing, and critical handwringing over Spencer's intentions toward rock seems to miss the point of his fairly straightforward goofball approach. Even if his music is something to ""get"" rather than to just blindly enjoy, the duo's approach here means they rarely get too caught up in provenance. Sure, there are dead ends here, such as the hallucinogenic story-song ""The Pill"" and the hokily ramblin' closer ""In My Heart"", but ""Bumble Bee"" is a fever-dream cartoon that's funnier than the old SNL skit, and ""(Sometimes You Got to Be) Gentle"" hurls increasingly randy single entendres over tremulously dissembling guitar riffs. In fact, name aside, Heavy Trash never get too heavy on Midnight Soul Serenade. It might be Spencer's lightest and breeziest album to date, a testimony to his stick-to-it-iveness despite the advancing years and changing trends.","Jon Spencer and Matt Verta-Ray continue to reinterpret the early days of rock'n'roll, emphasizing the rawness and raunchiness of it all.

"Goodbye Cruel World, Hello Crueler World",Spider Bags,by: Stuart Berman,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6f7ea9e61561daa54aa/1:1/w_160/0f2e96d1.jpg,2009-11-04 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13650-goodbye-cruel-world-hello-crueler-world/,Birdman,"""Everyone's heart gets broken some time/ Just not like mine."" If North Carolina (via New Jersey) drunk-rockers Spider Bags ever want to sell bumper stickers at their merch table, let this line-- taken from the teary, beery ballad ""Lord Please""-- be the slogan. It's a lyric that perfectly sums up the band's place in a venerable tradition of country-rock hurtin' songs and their singular status within it. Sure, you've heard bands like Spider Bags before; on first contact, you'd swear they were some half-remembered mid-1990s band that got lost in the college-radio shuffle among the Silver Jews, the Grifters, and Ass Ponys. But it's been an awful long time since you've heard a band pull off this sort of southern-fried slop-pop with such charm, craftiness, and self-deprecating wit. On their second album, Goodbye Cruel World, Hello Crueler World, Spider Bags re-imagine Neil Young's Tonight's the Night as a Saturday-night party album: They're bleary eyed and wobbly kneed, but they're going down on swinging (or, at least, swigging). Spider Bags' ragged but resilient spirit has made them heroes to Titus Andronicus, who have covered the Bags' signature song ""Waking Up Drunk"", though Bags don't share their New Jersey successors' penchant for burn-it-down drama. But the songs on Goodbye Cruel World twist and turn more than you'd expect from a country-rock album, riffing on standard verse-chorus-verse templates before introducing an even more rewarding, final-act change-up, whether it's the poignant pedal-steeled finale to the front-porch picker ""Swimmer on a String"" or the giddy stream of ""na na na na na""s appended to the early-Replacements trash-pop of ""Dishrag"". Even the typical juke-joint rave-up ""Long White Desert Rose"" upends the formula, revealing its chorus only during a sustained build-up in the final 90 seconds, and sending it aloft on a bed of ""ooh ooh ooh"" backing harmonies. Though Spider Bags have just two albums and a handful of 7""s to the their name so far, the band's MySpace bio is quick to point out that its members have been playing in bands for 15 years, and Cruel World's best songs ruminate on their refusal to grow up, albeit with a wisdom and clarity that you acquire only in your mid-30s: on the corroded jangle-pop of ""Hey Delinquents"", frontman Dan McGee plays an advisory big-brother role to a younger generation of misfits, while ""Que Viva El Rocanroll"" is a sloshed, shoulder-to-shoulder last-call waltz for those who really should know better than to stay out past 3 a.m. on a weeknight. And then there's the seven-minute colossus ""Trouble"", on which McGee owns up to a lifetime of deviancy before his mantric chorus line yields to a surprisingly nasty bout of wah-wah-pedal abuse. If there's a problem with Cruel World, it's that it never regains its proper footing after this monster jam; for an album that routinely inspires a certain raised-fist perseverance, the somber, Califoned pastorale ""Here Now"" is a bit of a bummer note to go out on. Sure, that album title sets you up for life's great letdowns, but Spider Bags' greatest attribute is making you believe you can rise above them.","It's been a long time since you've heard a band pull off this sort of southern-fried slop-pop with such charm, craftiness, and self-deprecating wit.

Received Pronunciation,Pants Yell!,by: Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6c113d1975652139263/1:1/w_160/49fe45c1.jpg,2009-11-04 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13605-received-pronunciation/,Slumberland,"Who gives a fuck about Oxford English? Pants Yell! have named their fifth album after, basically, the Queen's accent. If the title of last year's Alison Statton placed the Boston trio in the less-is-more lineage of Young Marble Giants, then Received Pronunciation acknowledges what they still more or less are: indie pop formalists, mastering a given dialect rather than inventing unknown tongues. The band's latest does away with the horns and strings of its predecessor, following a bit more conservatively in the tradition of wordy, tuneful, earnest underdogs from Small Factory and the Trashcan Sinatras to the Lucksmiths. What Received Pronunciation loses in variety-- my kingdom for another ""Two French Sisters""!-- it largely makes up for with increasingly accomplished songcraft. Since when has subtlety been supposed to call attention to itself, anyway? You're probably not going to like Received Pronunciation unless you occasionally enjoy breezy, midtempo songs with jangling/shimmering (choose one) rhythm guitar, slinky lead guitar lines, bustling drum fills, warm bass, and shy vocals, but the appeal of Pants Yell! is less about a particular sound than about lyrics and melodies. It also probably helps if you tend to appreciate understated storytelling and unexpected rhymes, though a line like, ""I remember your white sunglasses/ And the way the sun just went right past us,"" is a little more Billy Bragg than Upper West Side soweto. Received Pronunciation won't close you out like new slang; Pants Yell! would rather you make yourself at home, look around the place. First single ""Cold Hands"" sounds more inviting on each listen, with its ""First of the Gang to Die"" bounce, relationship anxiety, and wordplay that works without coming across like its singer needs a pat on the head. Parisian postcard ""Rue de la Paix"" luxuriates in detail, as singer Andrew Churchman declares, ""I remember every little thing."" But the songs more often show only what's needed: It's up to the listener to puzzle out the hungover unease of measured opener ""Frank and Sandy""; ""Not Wrong"", in which the narrator admits he can't tie a tie, has to be one of the most peaceful songs ever about getting into a fight. Underneath the polite surfaces is seething coming-of-age pathos: ""Does that asshole ever tell you that he still thinks of Megan?"" Churchman demands on ""Got to Stop"". The biggest misstep is ""Spider"", a 50-second bit of sympathy for the arachnid in winter. You can be too understated. ""What's the point of all this living?"" Churchman sings on accusatory finale ""To Take"", adding, ""Living's all I ever do."" He has told Swedish magazine Devotion that Received Pronunciation will be the final Pants Yell! album. They want to go the way of Huggy Bear and Felt rather than grow old and predictable. Too bad, because Received Pronunciation isn't my favorite Pants Yell! album, nor the most varied. If a recent Guardian column by critic Simon Reynolds is right, though, and what makes the Beatles, Motown, and great synthpop all immortal is not necessarily revolution, but ""melody and emotion,"" then Pants Yell! definitely have the ingredients to last forever-- if only for a faithful few who speak their language.","The Boston trio continues the tradition of wordy, tuneful, earnest underdogs from Small Factory and the Trashcan Sinatras to the Lucksmiths.

Molina and Johnson,Molina and Johnson,by: Stephen M.

Neither hilly nor flat, verdant nor desert, this section of I-40 feels like a time trap: You can drive for what seems like hours through the blank fields and past service stations that dot the roadside, but once you look at the clock, you'll find that only a few minutes have passed. On their first collaboration together, Jason Molina and Will Johnson have made the musical equivalent of that length of Arkansas highway. The 14 tracks on Molina and Johnson comprise an especially slow drive through somber countryside, windows up and speed limit carefully maintained. It's especially disappointing from these two prolific indie lifers, who have painted such distinctive American landscapes throughout their careers. An underrated singer and decoder-ring-demanding lyricist, Johnson oversees a range of projects, from the relatively pop-motivated Centro-Matic to the dustily atmospheric South San Gabriel, each playing off hardscrabble Lone Star rock to create something unique and accessible. Molina, on the other hand, has grown only more direct in his songs, abandoning the avant-Americana outfit Songs: Ohia for the more straightforward classic rock of Magnolia Electric Co., which tends to work best in big, broad landscapes (the box set ­Sojourner) rather than in life-size portraiture (Josephine, from earlier this year). The duo wrote and recorded Molina and Johnson during a 10-day respite in Johnson's home base of Denton, Texas, where they drank, smoked, and reportedly shot BB guns. Rather than showcasing any of that genial amity, the result is a sleepy, soundtracky, unexcitable record. Slow and subdued are legitimate musical choices, but an album of such low-key songs, especially from a pair of musicians who have displayed a broader palette in the past, seems like a missed opportunity, as if each is narrowing instead of expanding the possibilities for the other. Especially in its middle third, Molina and Johnson lags sluggishly, packing in too many gravely austere and relentlessly funereal numbers, like Johnson's slow-moving ""In the Avalon/The Killer"" and Molina's studiously stark ""Each Star Marks a Day"". There are hints of intriguing contrast on songs on the album-- Johnson's gritty rasp, wandering piano, and earthy imagery versus Molina's airy tenor, sparking guitar licks, and celestial navigations-- but they're never explored or examined in any interesting way. There are a few bright spots on this otherwise monochromatic album, most crammed toward the beginning. With its shuffling percussion and mournful guitar, opener ""Twenty Cycles to the Ground"" delivers a hook forged from hard syllables and mixes their voices evocatively. The hummed ""Now, Divide"" sounds like Dylan's Pat Garrett & Billy the Kid soundtrack played at the wrong speed, and ""All Gone, All Gone"" is positively Oldham-esque as a hitchhiking Sarah Jaffe shows up to wrap her voice around Johnson's. But these moments never coalesce into anything larger or more sustained, nor do they make the scenery all that intriguing, which is a shame considering the wanderlust of their previous projects. They have always been curious to see what's around the next bend or over the next hill, but Molina and Johnson too often sounds like it can barely make it up the incline to enjoy the view.","Magnolia Electric Co./Songs: Ohia's Jason Molina and Centro-Matic's Will Johnson team for a sleepy, evocative record.

Raditude,Weezer,by: Rob Mitchum,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6fe5e6ef95969320e86/1:1/w_160/91843387.jpg,2009-11-04 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13656-raditude/,Geffen,"Right now, psychiatrists are feverishly debating over what to include in the next revision of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders: the DSM-V, the psych bible. Among the syndromes those experts may decide whether to include in the latest edition is Peter Pan Syndrome, adults who long for youth so powerfully they begin to act like eternal children. Think Michael Jackson, who in naming his ranch Neverland, certainly invited the diagnosis. But most people with Peter Pan Syndrome regress to pre-pubertal life, an age before the complications of responsibility and sexuality. So what do we call what Rivers Cuomo has? The Weezer frontman seems to be stuck in an eternal puberty, forever 13-- confused, horny, hyperbolic, obsessed with brand names. It's a characteristic that has always been at the heart of Weezer, from ""In the Garage"" onward. But it's never been more concentrated than on Raditude, which, from its goofy name and cover art to its Mountain Dew-jacked sound and melodramatic lyrics, is designed to hit 13-year-old boys directly on target. And Cuomo is damned good at getting inside the frightening mind of a teenage boy. ""(If You're Wondering If I Want You To) I Want You To"" is a perfect title for a song about awkward courtship, and the fact that the narrator takes his date to Best Buy (teenage Mecca) before a home viewing of Titanic is pinpoint detail. Echoes of ""In the Garage"" turn up in, well, ""In the Mall"", written by drummer Patrick Wilson but sold by Cuomo emphatically chronicling the cruising circuit of elevator-to-escalator-to-elevator. Elsewhere on Raditude, Cuomo whines about going to work, pressures girls into third base, parrots hip-hop slang, escapes into ridiculous fantasy, and on bonus track ""Get Me Some"" portrays the teenage experience in four words: ""Right now/ Everything sucks."" Of course, these journal scrawls are backed largely by power-pop-- what else could it be? Cuomo proved for all time with the first two Weezer records (and fleetingly since) that he's a master of the genre, popping out melodic sing-alongs and fuzz-guitar riffs, and Raditude largely goes back to those basics. ""Let It All Hang Out"" is a song about celebrating the weekend and forgetting your troubles and sounds like the song you would play to do exactly that. The peppy (if a bit on the creepy side) ""I'm Your Daddy"", made with Britney and Miley collaborator Dr. Luke, justly turns the table on rock-borrowing pop like ""Since U Been Gone"". All together, it sounds like the first record ever written with the goal expressly in mind of being kick-ass to play on Rock Band. The departures from that formula are harder to stomach, particularly the Bollywood-drenched Hallmark card ""Love Is the Answer"", which is absolutely awful. I still get hate mail for saying Make Believe was so bad that it retroactively ruined the Blue Album and Pinkerton, and I still believe it-- ""Beverly Hills"" was the sound of a band that had learned to do as little as possible to write a hit. But Raditude doesn't have that stench of minimal calculation on it; if anything, it's as earnest as the famously confessional Pinkerton, just written by someone whose age doesn't match his POV. But the record's teen-boy empowerment message doesn't have much to offer anyone over 13 years old. Perhaps the proper fictional character to reference isn't Peter Pan, but Matthew McConaughey's Wooderson from Dazed and Confused-- we all get older, Rivers Cuomo stays the same age.","Melodic sing-alongs, fuzz-guitar riffs-- Weezer are going back to basics, making music that sounds for (but also often by) 13-year-olds.

Unbalance,2562,by: Nate Patrin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6d6c0084474cd0c0a63/1:1/w_160/15fd06eb.jpg,2009-11-03 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13622-unbalance/,Tectonic,"Like most electronic dance genres, the centrality of anonymity to dubstep has been a bit overstated. The greatest strength of the genre right now is the fact that there's a unique niche for every producer, or at least those who deign to nichedom instead of making their name as a scene-hopping rhythmic polyglot. So there's something weirdly blank about the idea of a producer who, having already burned through a couple of other pseudonyms, decides to make his name as a post-dubstep figure by picking his own postal code as an alias. And that might be by design. 2562-- né Dave Huismans, aka A Made Up Sound-- has put the idea across that dubstep is more of a chassis than a full vehicle for his style, and it's not just the geographical distance from Croydon that sets his music apart. With an interest in a wide-spanning range of techno sounds and a background in broken beat, Huismans made his initial impacts with a pair of 2007 singles-- ""Channel Two"" and ""Kameleon""-- that blended mutated, uptempo 2-step rhythms with glassy synths to compellingly frigid effect. And, as the album Aerial proved the following year, it was an aesthetic he was able to draw some intriguing cross-pollinations from, owing as much to classic Orbital as it did the latest sounds out of South London. But if his new album Unbalance is a progression, it's a regimented one. Where Aerial ran a wide BPM range, used chord progressions that fluctuated between ravey and ambient, and traded on a tension between static-filled negative space and percussive snap, Unbalance is a bit more confined and busy, establishing a narrow tempo window-- quickly paced, with little breathing room-- and sticking to it. It's one of those odd albums where nearly every track sounds good, but it's all so singleminded and monolithic in its approach that taking it in as a whole almost feels smothering. In single-serving doses, it's easy to get drawn in, and picking any individual track off this album will reveal its own unique touches: the keyboards hacked up into skipping-CD stutters that make up the melodic undercurrent of ""Flashback"", the jump-cut vibes and mosquito Moogs in ""Dinosaur"", the slow build of the title track from floating dead-satellite gristle to densely stammering percussion punctuated by panicked-sounding organ stab chords. And ""Love in Outer Space"", the first single off the album, is one of Huismans' nerviest pieces of drum programming, a frenetic trap/kick/clap Benihana act that becomes only more jolting when a bank of borderline-acid synths jumps in to act as a manic counter-rhythm. In comparison to Great Lengths-- the latest album from his closest analogue, fellow countryman and stylistic shapeshifter Martyn-- 2562's latest is missing a bit in the area of soulfulness, or much of a human touch at all. That's a serious bonus if you're in the right mindframe; revisiting this album when it's 15 degrees out and it gets dark before 5 p.m. could do it some good. And in the search to find a specific track to single out as a detriment, I couldn't do much worse than finding analogues to tracks where he did certain tricks more deftly-- i.e., the conga drums on ""Narita"" being reminiscent of but not quite as lively as ""Kameleon"". Just keep in mind that listening to this entire album's one-note routine in one sitting-- great as that note can be-- may lead you to believe that 2562 is more indistinct and anonymous than he really is.","Dave Huismans, aka A Made Up Sound, uses dubstep as the center rather than the totality of his sound as he here also explores techno and broken beat.

Eccentric Soul: Smart's Palace,Various Artists,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6df9d034d5c69bf3651/1:1/w_160/76530d83.jpg,2009-11-03 06:00:03,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13630-eccentric-soul-smarts-palace/,Numero Group,"Imagine a word-association game matching cities to their defining characteristics. I say Boston, you might say chowder or Red Sox or baked beans. For New Orleans, you might say gumbo or Mardi Gras or Katrina. Wichita... a lot of things might come to mind (my #1 is lineman), but soul music is probably not among the first hundred or so. Well, the Smart family begs to differ. Back in the 1950s, 60s, and 70s, various Smart brothers (there were eight of them) ruled various aspects of a soul empire that included a band, club, restaurant, record store, and record label. They sent raiding parties to major cities on the West Coast, East Coast, and Third Coast, and cut enough great records to fill a pretty killer compilation. The Smart Brothers Band was one of a few R&B show bands to rise in Wichita in the late 50s, and by all accounts they delivered in concert, as recounted in Numero's typically extensive liner notes. John and Leroy Smart were the band's animated front line, jumping from table to table in the club while soloing, popping handstands, and dragging audience members onstage in unusual ways-- by grabbing their belt buckles with their teeth and tugging, for instance. Their bass-playing brother Dick was the businessman of the bunch, launching all the ventures listed above apart from the band itself, and he in many ways was the engine under the hood of Wichita's soul scene. The discography of the various Smart Brothers lineups, which themselves went by a few different names, is limited, and here is augmented by recordings made by other artists for Dick Smart's Solo label, many of which feature a similar group of musicians. Outfits that lasted from the 50s into the 70s weren't that uncommon, and it's always fascinating to hear their evolution as styles changed around them. These tracks, recorded between 1963 and 1975, chart a progression from hard-boogying R&B to deep soul and hard funk noir with a strong social conscience. The earliest sides have a ramshackle quality befitting their low recording budgets and utter obscurity. The Smart Brothers' ""Barefoot Philly"" is an instrumental led by screaming sax and packed with shouted exhortations from the other band members, while the brothers' tracks as the backing band for C.C. ""Baby"" Neal are rough but spirited and clearly the work of talented people. ""I'm Not Ashamed"" is borderline doo-wop slathered with fake crowd noise to imitate the vibe of their shows, and ""Lorraine"" has an interesting drum beat and an atmosphere similar to the frat-rock records of the same era, with lots of in-studio conversation and shouts. A full 10 years later, Neal was back, leading a band called the Hard Road through a couple of sides of harmony-laden throwback soul with a decidedly more refined sound. In between, Dick Smart made some cool records hampered only by their microscopic distribution range (i.e., Dick Smart's record store). Theron & Darrell's ""It's Your Love"" is a slamming Sam & Dave-style soul track with a wicked bounce in its step and a breakdown that oddly quotes the breakdown of Chicago's ""South California Purples"". Fred Williams & the Jewels Band's ""The Dance Got Old"" is a standup example of the ""name as many dance steps as you can"" micro-genre, and John Smart's Band's ""Herbie's Bag"" is a great R&B show band instrumental-- I can see the brothers doing those backflips while the band digs into this. The unfortunately-named Chocolate Snow didn't include any Smart Brothers in its multiracial lineup, but their ""It's Like Heaven"" and ""Inflation"", both released for the first time ever here, are outstanding. ""Inflation"" is a great funk-noir track featuring a spoken rumination on unemployment: ""My goodness. You gonna tell me you got no jobs today? You told me last week to come back this week."" There's also an instrumental version that purports to be a cover of the Beatles' ""A Day in the Life"", but it's pretty much unrecognizable as such, and that's probably for the best. Tracks like this make Numero's soul-archeology project more than worthwhile, and Smart's Palace is yet another strong entry in the Eccentric Soul series. So, will this disc shoot soul music to the top of your Wichita free-association list? Probably not. But it might put it in the top 10.","A soul music empire from Wichita, Kansas, and nearly lost to history is resurrected by the Numero Group on the latest comp from the imprint's winning series.

Blue Record,Baroness,by: Grayson Currin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6beea9e61561daa5422/1:1/w_160/cbdb5938.jpg,2009-11-03 06:00:02,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13603-blue-record/,Relapse,"Blue Record, the second LP from Savannah, Ga., hero-metal quartet Baroness, feels like it spins for either 30 or 90 minutes, but never the 44 minutes the tracklist advertises. Full of stops and starts, dynamic swells and swan dives, razor-sharp guitar leads, and dense full-band bludgeons, these 12 tracks swell with parts and counterparts, condensing epics into tightly arranged, executed, and edited two-minute stretches. Within most any given track, Baroness twist between feelings of triumph and trouble, elation and depletion, playing all with unequal parts grace and grit. When those extremes and the sonic care that goes into creating them win over, the Blue Record feels like a marathon where everyone wins. That description, however, runs the risk of making Baroness' triumphant follow-up to 2007's Red Album seem like a laborious listen. It's not: Via expert pacing and meticulous sequencing, those peaks and valleys arise precisely where they should, creating an experience that feels more like a sunny ride in a sports car than anything resembling hard work. No, Baroness, along with producer and mixer John Congleton, have done all of the heavy lifting for you. Congleton-- more familiar to the indie rock world than the metal set thanks to his work with bands like Black Mountain, Explosions in the Sky, and, more recently, St. Vincent on the texturally astounding Actor-- coaxes more sound out of this four-piece than they've ever allowed. Still using only bass, drums, guitars, John Baizley's full-throated roar, and a touch of piano, Baroness and Congleton render a surprisingly rich palette of sound that's well-suited for atmospheric lulls and electrified roars. Guitarist Pete Adams, new to the band after the departure of Brian Blickle late last year, flanks Baizley now. They make quite the sympathetic pair, lifting from the mid-level, mid-tempo chug that shapes the band's core into the sort of high-flying, skydiving riffs that decorate it effortlessly. But Baroness are more than the sum of their guitar glories. Drummer Allen Blickle tweaks time habitually. On ""A Horse Called Golgotha"", he crams stacks of beats into tiny fills, adding exclamation marks to a tune that doesn't even need them. And on ""The Gnashing"", he steadily builds from a simple, bar-band plod into the sort of triumphant rumble that sends grown men into mosh pits. Congleton treats all of the pieces like interconnected games of seesaw, constantly cloaking one in the mix to highlight another, keeping it all in motion. For this, ""Jake Leg"" becomes more than the album's bruiser. In the verses, Congleton pulls back the marching drums back to push Baizley's bark to the fore. In the breaks, he pushes everything together, creating a mess of guitars and drums that rolls like a boulder into the next line. Think Torche with greater control and finesse. That is, the song's anthemic quality doesn't get in the way of its million moving parts. One just augments the other. You're only going to notice details like that when you listen, rewind, and listen again. Blue Record is simply much too fun and kinetic to analyze in real time. With Baroness, one part is always changing while another prepares to do the same, everything working in concert to pull the listener along, too. These songs are invitations that are easy to accept. You'll be excused while digging for your lighter and singing along during ""Steel That Sleeps the Eye"", fingerpicking an air guitar during the serpentine intro to ""O'Er Hell and Hide"" or pumping a fist and shouting, ""Flesh is weak!"" and ""My lip needs a meal,"" during the relentless ""Jake Leg"". Even ""Ogeechee Hymnal"", a slow-burning instrumental ostensibly intended as the mid-album respite, magnetizes with its gorgeous sheets of guitar and bass. When it bleeds into ""A Horse Called Golgotha"", any inkling you might've had to think gets crushed by sheer power. It feels as good as Journey's ""Don't Stop Believin'"", but it's as accomplished as the best of a masturbatory metal dude like Marc Rizzo. Baroness makes this all seam so seamless, casual, and spirited, as if four Southern badasses simply walked into a room one afternoon and ripped through this album in a jam. Every song bleeds into the other, and its flow is impeccable. But the whole production-- the peerless sound, the acoustic interludes, the interwoven lyrics-- betray careful, deliberate construction. Still, Blue Record never feels overthought or overworked. These guys are having too much fun for that. Complex enough to reward repetitive listening and compact enough to encourage it, Blue Record is one of the year's most generous hours. Or half-hours. Or, hell, however long the thing is.","The second LP from this Savannah, Ga., metal quartet finds producer John Congleton coaxing more sound out of the band than they've ever allowed.

Greatest Hits,Foo Fighters,by: Matthew Perpetua,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a700ea9e61561daa54c2/1:1/w_160/e76c409d.jpg,2009-11-03 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13658-greatest-hits/,RCA,"We all know the hero myth of Nirvana: Kurt Cobain stormed MTV and radio with punk anthems of genuine rage, and saved us all from the vapidity of hair metal. This story has been repeated so many times that it's rare to find Cobain's music framed in any other context, especially since his suicide served only to make him a rock'n'roll martyr. Foo Fighters have something of a hero myth going on too, but it's a lot less dramatic: Following the death of his comrade, Dave Grohl rocked on as the leader of his own band, and spent the next 15 years making mainstream rock radio, uh, slightly more listenable. Grohl's task may not be anywhere near as glamorous or as era-defining as that of his former band, but in a way, it's much more difficult and thankless. In the years after Cobain's death, corporate consolidation of rock radio took hold and quickly snuffed out nearly every bit of underground weirdness that made its way into the mainstream after the record industry went through its phase of signing every cult band they could get in the hopes of finding another Nirvana. The playlists got tighter, and if you're reading this site, we probably don't need to tell you just how bad the music on these stations got, and how to this day it only seems to get worse. Grohl and his band may have been grandfathered into the radio format mainly for his connection to Nirvana, but he earned his keep and turned out a reliable string of enjoyable hits. This probably sounds like faint praise. Indeed, you barely need to be mediocre to outshine the likes of Nickelback, Creed, and Hoobastank, but Foo Fighters are not merely a tolerable band floating along in a sea of crap, or a decent band that somehow remains mainstream against the odds. Foo Fighters are excellent at being mainstream, and, over the course of six albums, Dave Grohl has gone through the unlikely transformation of being known only as the powerhouse drummer of Nirvana to becoming his generation's answer to Tom Petty-- a consistent hit machine pumping out working-class rock. Part of what makes Foo Fighters thrilling, at least from an indie/alt-rock perspective, is that Grohl manages to smuggle bits of underground sounds into his arena-filling hits. ""All My Life"", a smash from 2002's One By One, owes a significant debt to the slashing chord progressions of math rock titans Chavez, and ""Big Me"" is one of the few songs to come out of twee to enjoy major commercial success in the United States. ""Everlong"", perhaps Grohl's most enduring and beloved composition, bridges the gap between the midwestern post-hardcore emo of Hum and Braid and the more commercial iterations of emo that would follow. Grohl doesn't appropriate in order to seem hip, and his reference points are not particularly relevant to getting across the appeal of his music-- he simply has good taste and borrows ideas that work. His soaring ballads, like ""Learn to Fly"" and ""Times Like These"", are not nearly as cool, but his punk influences shine through in his total commitment to a sentimental tone without allowing for mawkishness or surrendering to cheesiness. Grohl is known to be a funny guy, but there is never a trace of an ironic smirk in the guy's music, and he shines when his earnestness is most apparent, whether it's the gleeful riffing of ""Monkey Wrench"" and ""This Is a Call"", or the tortured romantic angst of ""The Best of You"". As a compilation, Greatest Hits offers few surprises other than that Grohl somehow resisted the temptation to title this thing The Best of Foo. Though the record conspicuously lacks the band's breakthrough single, ""I'll Stick Around"", the first 13 tracks make good on the promise of the title and provide a relentless hit parade of modern rock radio staples. Of course, modern-hits compilations are unnecessarily larded with new tracks recorded to promote the set upon release, and this is no exception. Like nearly all songs recorded specifically for these releases, ""Wheels"" and ""Word Forward"" are catchy but uninspired, and have no place among the heavy hitters in this collection. ""Wheels"" is particularly aggravating, sounding something like a half-hearted attempt at a country-rock crossover, which indicates a nervous desperation for continued success that has been absent from Grohl's work to date. The band surely had better options for non-album tracks. Why not instead include their well-known cover of Prince's ""Darling Nikki"", their soundtrack hit ""The One"", or a new recording of a strong B-side like 1996's ""How I Miss You"" or Grohl's sole Nirvana composition, ""Marigold""? At least those songs would've fit into the general conceit of a career survey. These bonus tracks are contractual obligations and a simple fact of the modern record industry, but Foo Fighters' Greatest Hits is a perfect example of an otherwise valuable catalog release marred by this unnecessary meddling in the interest of stimulating first-week sales.","Despite missing early single ""I'll Stick Around"", and including blah new songs, these modern rock survivors prove their singles band cred on this comp.

Swords,Morrissey,by: Stephen Troussé,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6f89d034d5c69bf3692/1:1/w_160/c0871004.jpg,2009-11-03 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13651-swords/,Polydor,"Call me morbid, call me pale, but when the news of his onstage collapse twittered and flickered across the screens of the world the other night, I couldn't help but relish the way the flame of the Morrissey Myth seemed to flare briefly back into gaudy life. You see, as Swords, mopping up of the stray B-sides and bonus tracks from the comeback years, suggests, Morrissey now has a dilemma: Following group glory, solo vindication, political notoriety, sullen exile, and dramatic revival, what on earth does he do for an encore? It's not as though he can comfortably retire to civilian life. David Thomson once wrote of how fame had condemned an elderly woman to live out her days ""sequestered in the cathedral called Greta Garbo."" By contrast, the young Steven Patrick eagerly triple-locked the door and then tossed away the key upon entering the gothic mansion called Morrissey. But, self-condemned to the stage, are his fifties to be an ever decreasing circuit of provincial theaters, hawking threadbare B-sides? I'm not cynical enough to suggest that the fall was psychosomatically stage-managed, but you can see how the suggestion of a final savage spotlit exit might spice up the prospect of a Saturday night in Swindon. I suppose the elegant option would be to retreat to some Tuscan villa or Parisian hotel, like Dirk Bogarde or Louise Brooks, and compose his perfectly poisonous memoirs. Or he could fade to gray in Vegas residency, crooning guttering torch songs to senile old Smiths fans. He could even return triumphant to his homeland which is eager at last to embrace him as an iconic, harmless old English eccentric, become a chatshow fixture, and accept a knighthood. In the MGM biopic that he has always been reshooting in his head, the Swindon swoon makes a much better opening scene for the closing chapter of The Morrissey Story. Of course, he has been announcing the murderous urgency of life since he was a boy, but the best tracks on Swords seem designed to provide the perfectly piquant soundtrack. ""The Never-Played Symphonies"", perversely tucked away originally on second CD and 12"" of ""Irish Blood, English Heart"", when it's finer than several recent singles, finds our hero reflecting from his death bed. Consumed by regret, sighing over a stuttering player piano, he doesn't see the glory, wealth, or adulation, only the never-laid and the never-played: those errant hearts and songs never now to be captured. Similarly, ""Christian Dior"" addresses a fellow ""lionized maverick,"" and sympathizes with a life hemmed-in by style. Musically the song is another humdrum strummed waltz, but the image of what might have been stirs him to heights of falsetto, hysterically overcompensating for the lack of drama in the tune. ""Sweetie-Pie"", a rare co-writing credit for keyboard player Mikey Farrell, is more satisfying. Morrissey's voice is tossed and submerged amid a vortex of effects, as he delivers a fierce last plea for deliverance, before disappearing beneath the waves. [Correction: Morrissey's voice was not pitchshifted on the track, as was originally stated-- the second vocal on the track belongs to singer Kristeen Young-- Ed.] But elsewhere the music offers the singer too little to work with. On ""Good Looking Man About Town"" Alain Whyte tries to spice things up with hints of raga, but unfortunately brings to mind Kula Shaker. ""Ganglord"" is the latest doomed attempt to repeat the dense swampy drone of ""How Soon Is Now?"". Lyrically, Morrissey casts around for subjects other than himself, without much success: both ""Teenage Dad on His Estate"" and (the iTunes-only) ""Slum Mums"" would like to report back fearlessly from the frontline of the modern underclass, but feel peculiarly dated, right down to the reference to the ""Jensen Interceptor"" as someone's runaround. Once upon a time, asked what it exactly it was he does, Morrissey would reply ""Well, I'm not bad with words."" For a long time now, he's been a great pop star first, a great singer second, and a lyric writer somewhere around fourth or fifth. In the past of course, this needn't have been a problem. In his 50th year, Frank Sinatra could call upon songs of the quality of ""It Was a Very Good Year"". Morrissey naturally takes the precisely opposite tack, but without Brill Building industry to fall back on, he increasingly resorts to covering the heroes of his youth: David Bowie (a stilted live take on ""Drive-In Saturday"") and the New York Dolls (the iTunes-only ""Human Being""). In the absence of a compelling partner, Morrissey must rely on his audience to bring him to life. Initial quantities of Swords come bundled with a bonus disc of songs recorded live in Warsaw, and what's striking is how even second division songs like ""I Just Want to See the Boy Happy"" or ""Black Cloud"" seem turbo-charged with intensity when performed live, how as a singer he is able to simultaneously celebrate, interrogate, and mock his own back catalogue, while basking in the spotlight and the crowd's devotion. ""It is the terrifying power of the true pop artist,"" Morrissey once wrote, in the sleevenotes to a compilation celebrating Klaus Nomi, Nico, Johnny Thunders, and Marc Bolan, ""who seems to finally come into full bloom only at the hour of Death (as if Life is just not quite the point)?"" And though there's often been something touchingly hypochondriac about a drug-free, vegetarian millionaire insisting at 50 that the hour of his death is imminent, the melodramatic possibility has now been raised that every show ever after might be his last, and that, like the nightingale in that Oscar Wilde fairytale, his song will grow ever sweeter as he approaches his doom.","Twenty-track compilation gathers the B-sides of the indie legend's recent comeback years.

Under Stellar Steam,Richard Youngs,by: Marc Masters,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6f413d19756521392d6/1:1/w_160/53c0e548.jpg,2009-11-02 06:00:04,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13647-under-stellar-steam/,Jagjaguwar,"There's a lyric early on in Under Stellar Stream that neatly encapsulates the album's subtle hypnotism. ""The shift-shapes still shifting like shift-shapes now,"" Richard Youngs sings over a droning see-saw of two-note organ and bass. On paper, the line seems trivial, an empty truism on the level of ""it is what it is."" But he repeats the words as if trying to penetrate them, creating something bigger than literal meaning. In the span of just a few seconds, he makes a fleeting tongue-twister sound like a time-honored hymn. Under Stellar Stream is filled with such fertile repetition. In most of the songs, Youngs sings one simple phrase in one simple melody, adding small variances in the words and even smaller ones in the notes. This might seem like a recipe for monotony, especially since his backing instrumentation is sparse and minimal-- sometimes more an echo than a tangible presence-- and his lyrics are cryptic and elusive. But Youngs' knack for catchy, familiar-sounding lines, which sound plucked from traditional folk songs, makes Under Stellar Steam mesmerizing. It also makes lengthy repetitions sound surpisingly like fully fleshed songs. Take the second track, ""All Day Monday and Tuesday"", wherein Youngs sings the title phrase 42 straight times, each instance followed by an addendum which itself gets repeated. ""All Day Monday and Tuesday, the fuel of day, the fuel of day,"" he hums over reverberating bass plucks. ""All Day Monday and Tuesday, the machine of time, the machine of time."" As he patiently draws out each syllable, Youngs sounds most like a monk, chanting a mantra in search of meanings below the words' surface. That exercise-like quality is even stronger on the meditative ""My Mind Is in Garlands"". Here Youngs tries to empty his mind by examining it: ""My mind is in my mind/ My mind is in Garlands... My mind the underwhelming... My mind sees a clearing."" After all this searching repetition, Youngs ends the album with his least repetitive piece. But even though most of the lines in ""The Bells of Spring"" don't recur, the lyrics echo previous themes. ""The underwhelming... I see the clearing,"" he sings in the same bold tones he began with. With its plaintive chords-- reminiscent of the simple piano figures on his 1990 classic Advent-- ""The Bells of Spring"" has the feel of a celebratory breakthrough, as if Youngs' devout chants have finally taken him to the other side. So it's possible that Under Stellar Stream is a journey, and ""The Bells of Spring"" is its climax. But I'd rather think of it more as a cycle without beginning or end-- if only to hope that he might someday return to this entrancing mode.","British multi-instrumentalist mines fertile repetition on the latest compelling record in a compelling career.

Entropy,Panther,by: Rebecca Raber,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6adc0084474cd0c0a03/1:1/w_160/fade4d9d.jpg,2009-11-02 06:00:03,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13588-entropy/,Kill Rock Stars,"The third offering from Charlie Salas-Humara's former solo project, Panther-- drummer Joe Kelly joined the fold before last year's 14 kt God-- is one of the more surprising follow-up records in recent memory. The Portland-based band known for its spazzy, sweaty live shows is absent on Entropy. Gone are the Prince-ly sex jams and Casio freakouts of debut Secret Lawns, as well as the Rapture-ous yelps and jagged beats of their sophomore effort. Instead, on Entropy, we get tightly constructed piano pop nuggets replete with overdubbed, harmonized vocals and loosely jazzy rhythms. Written mostly on the piano (a first for the usually guitar-dependent Salas-Humara), the songs on Entropy owe an obvious debt to soft-rock stars like Steely Dan and ELO. Recorded at home in the DIY spirit of their label (Kill Rock Stars), it's an aughts version of louche 1970s pop with a puckish (and punkish) experimental attitude that keeps it from sounding like homage or imitation. Opening salvo ""Laditudes for Centuries"" sets the tone with its crashing, disorienting piano line, insistent, rubbery guitar riff, and psychedelic vocal harmonies. The song feels strangely spare, despite its myriad elements, thanks to the repetition of each instrument's vamp and the space between the plinky pianos and the jangly guitars. That space is evident throughout Entropy, as pianos collide into shouty choruses but still leave pockets for breath or the anticipation of Kelly's syncopated rhythms. Ever since Kelly joined the band, he has given it a rhythmically sophisticated underpinning, moving Salas-Humara from breakdancing laptop trickster to full on rock'n'roll frontman. And on Entropy, the complex swing of his spastic drumming adds not only energy but also polish to Panther's sound. The album's title is a clue to its creation. Entropy, as a doctrine, is about disintegration, degeneration, and disorder, and in many ways, Entropy, as an album, feels like the breaking down of a pop record. Cyclical piano lines roil insistently, their dissonant notes rubbing up against each other uncomfortably. Choruses are held together by the tension between Salas-Humara's alternately dreamy and shouty vocals or the hammered piano arpeggios and noodly guitar flourishes. Rhythms dizzily change pace. Songs end abruptly. On ""Bridge on Fire"" and ""Birds That Move"", it's easy to hear the fingerprints of Panther's AM-rock influences-- mathy piano figures, aloof, jazzy drums, an overall sense of cerebral cool-- but they are fractured, as if viewed through the warped lens of a broken mirror. There are moments, too, in which the pair remind you of their back catalog; ""Springwater"", for example, is the rare track that makes use of Salas-Humara's famed falsetto and features a brief glimpse, about a minute before it ends, of the jittery rhythms and playfully buzzing synthesizers of the band's past. And for those who miss such bleeping dance beats, Entropy ends with a collection of bonus tracks that outnumber the originals-- including remixes by Portland producers Copy, Lips and Ribs, and E*Rock, which prove that these newer songs, though evolved from the band's glitchy past, are still able to be gussied up in an old guise.","Portland dance-rockers offer an album of tightly constructed piano pop nuggets replete with overdubbed, harmonized vocals and loosely jazzy rhythms.

Shaft OST [Deluxe Edition],Isaac Hayes,by: Nate Patrin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6de5e6ef95969320e3d/1:1/w_160/b34a4e6b.jpg,2009-11-02 06:00:02,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13629-shaft-ost-deluxe-edition/,StaxStax,"It's not often that a musician gets a chance to initiate a massive shift in two different fields of entertainment at the same time. Things were different before Isaac Hayes made the leap to scoring movies: you had your Beatles vehicles and your concert documentaries, your ripped-from-the-charts soundtracks (Easy Rider) and your film scores that became pop hits (The Good, the Bad and the Ugly). But there was nothing quite like the convergence of popular and cinematic music in Shaft, at least not since Duke Ellington was tapped to soundtrack Anatomy of a Murder 12 years previous. With Shaft, Hayes didn't just break through with a #1 pop album, #1 pop single, and Academy Award, he changed the musical directions of Hollywood and R&B simultaneously. Within two years, damn near everybody in soul had a soundtrack in their discography, resulting in career-defining classics (Curtis Mayfield's Super Fly) as well as creative transitional experiments (Marvin Gaye's Trouble Man). And it hit hard in the other direction, too: by 1973, Bruce Lee and James Bond alike were busting heads to Lalo Schifrin and George Martin scores that threw in the same serpentine wah-wahs and supple funk percussion that nabbed Hayes his Oscar. And yet most people have a hard time looking past that first song. For all the ""baaaad mother--/ Shut yo' mouth"" rapport and whocka-chicka style that provoked a thousand deconstructions of 1970s attitude, ""Theme from Shaft"" was an intricate overture doubling as a character-establishing theme that made a title card all but redundant, and it proves how easy Hayes' transition from songwriter to film-score composer actually was. The liner notes to Stax's new, remastered Deluxe Edition reissue of the Shaft soundtrack make note of Hayes' previous foray into the field (the semi-obscure Norman Mailer film Maidstone) and the advisement of jazz composer Tom McIntosh to ""just do your thing"" instead of worrying about taking cues from the score to an epic like Doctor Zhivago. But despite his non-traditional approach-- The Isaac Hayes Movement was said to have recorded ""headwise,"" without the use of sheet music-- Hayes reached an ideal midpoint between film scoring convention and R&B auteurism, and Shaft is full of cinematic cues and motifs that came naturally to a musician who'd already pushed the boundaries of symphonic soul two years before on Hot Buttered Soul. The majority of Shaft is instrumental, with lots of incidental music that runs between a minute to four and change; it's best experienced in the original filmic context but still has a certain appeal on its own. Aside from being a rich vein of sample material (the agitated cricket-chirp guitars in ""Walk From Regio's"" and the simmering, brassy strut of ""No Name Bar"" being two of the richest), these tracks are also an illuminating cross-section of what Hayes and his musicians-- the Bar-Kays, the Movement, and the Memphis Strings & Horns-- were capable of. The Hammond-driven ""Bumpy's Lament"" is the most distinctive nod to Stax as it existed in both the mid 60s and the early 70s, combining the grittiness of gospel roots with opulent strings and flutes. ""Ellie's Love Theme"" and ""Shaft Strikes Again"" take it even further, grafting Burt Bacharach/Hal David light-pop melodies into the mix to add an undercurrent of upscale sophistication. And the nods to jazz (the Wes Montgomery-esque guitars in ""Café Regio's"") and blues (""Bumpy's Blues"", one flying-V and raspy-smooth drawl away from being an Albert King single) were, if anything, emblematic of how versatile the Stax/Enterprise ""house style"" had actually become. There are still a couple moments of Isaac Hayes as we know him in a more traditional, non-cinematic sense, even though one of them isn't just montage-ready but a sort of montage in itself. ""Soulsville"" is one of the quintessential 70s slice-of-life-as-protest songs, and while its travelogue-style breakdown of ghetto strife is a now-familiar theme, it's also clearly written as an entreaty for otherwise-oblivious whites to sympathize with Black America's troubles (""The chains that bind him are hard to see/ Unless you take this walk with me""), and its mournful sax might be the most iconic moment outside the title theme. Then there's Hayes as marathon runner: the simmering funk of ""Do Your Thing"" takes vamping to a staggering extent, starting with a slinky backbone and working its way into a manic, wailing-guitar frenzy that seems calculated to top the already-intense climax of Hayes' own ""Walk on By"". It's that rare 19 1/2-minute song that's so propulsive and energetic that it goes by like it's five, though the band does get so exhaustively thorough with wringing every last drop of sweat and power out of its groove that eventually one of the guitarists just starts riffing off the three-note NBC theme for no apparent reason. (Left on the CD/digital version: the sudden, hilariously meta ""fuck it, we're out of time"" needle-scratch ending.) Within a couple of years of Shaft, Hayes had become so much of a soundtrack celebrity that it briefly threatened to eclipse his other work, and by 1974's Tough Guys and Truck Turner he was able to knock out an entire album's worth of soundtrack-ready funk so easily that he had more than enough time to star in the movies themselves. But while his music never really regressed-- Truck Turner, soundtrack or no, might be his best album of the 70s-- Shaft is where Hayes' meteoric popularity peaked. And for damn good reason: he created a theme song that was both ubiquitous and game-changing. But, as the liner notes reveal, it was the last thing he wrote for the score-- making it a song whose strengths were simply the culmination of an already extensive and finely-crafted soundtrack.","Isaac Hayes' game-changing film score, which launched the soul/funk soundtrack craze in the early 70s, is given a deluxe reissue.

And it is... except when it isn't-- ""Rock Co.Kane Flow"", taken from De La Soul's The Grind Date, actually finds DOOM doing something of a victory lap in 2004 after his essential triad of Take Me to Your Leader (released under the name King Geedorah), Vaudeville Villain (Viktor Vaughn), and Madvillainy (Madvillain). ""Rock Co.Kane Flow"" is a fantastic symbiosis of DOOM's many playful styles, but the beat itself feels weightier than what we're used to from De La and the stakes higher (ahem) than what we're used to from DOOM when he guests on a track. The other high(er)-profile collaborations on Unexpected don't always fare as well-- while ""Da Supafriendz"" spotlights a nerdy side of Vast Aire that often goes overlooked amidst Cannibal Ox's doomsayer image, ""Fly That Knot"" is the second hopelessly corny track DOOM's done with Talib Kweli (see also: ""Old School"" from The Mouse and the Mask) and most of the blame lies with Kweli's increasing ineptitude at hook-writing, it's clear these two share more camaraderie than chemistry. So, Unexpected Guests would appear to be a primer of DOOM's work on other people's albums... except when it's not. Even the most modest DOOM discographers likely know ""?"", a track with Kurious that dates back to 1999's Operation: Doomsday. If we're opening it up to collaborations from actual DOOM albums, why nothing from Madvillainy, or even career highlights like ""Let Me Watch"" or ""Rapp Snitch Knishes""? Well, we can at least be sure this is a compilation of tracks DOOM raps on, right? Sure, except when it isn't: ""E.N.Y. House"", a DOOM production taken from Masta Killa's underwhelming sophomore album Made in Brooklyn is a entropic flop, two lackadaisical approaches that never seem to mesh, though the ""Street Corners (Remix)"" fares better when Inspectah Deck and GZA join the proceedings. *But besides that, *Guests reinforces its inessential nature by presenting, for the most part, a one-dimensional rendering of DOOM as a lyricist. It's not as easy to, um, Mad-lib a verse of parody lyrics as it is for fellow weirdo faves like Cam'ron or Lil Wayne, but you get an idea of what others expect out of DOOM-- a handful of offbeat pop culture references, alcohol abuse, plenty of third-person talk. And if you've ever faced the cold reality of trying to find a liquor store in Atlanta on Sundays, you're sure to get a kick out of ""All Outta Ale"", which combines the bootlegger science of Viktor Vaughn with the unquenchable thirst for booze that marked MM...Food. To say nothing of ""My Favorite Ladies"", which takes the narcotic personification of ""Drink Away the Pain (Situations)"" to its logical extreme. The thing is, for a guy whose prolificacy was once his most identifiable characteristic, DOOM is still more comfortable in the album mindset than mixtapes-- whether it's structure or just artistic freedom, working under an established alias allows him to branch out into stone-cynical politics (""Cellz"", ""Strange Ways"", ""One Smart Nigger""), storytelling (""Bloody Chain"", ""Let Me Watch""), or any number of experimental flows (""Fancy Clown"", ""Change the Beat""). It's tough to turn down raps like, ""If the price is right he might sing a new smash/ Then laugh and twist his Rollie Fingers moustache,"" and taken in five-minute chunks, Unexpected Guests is undeniably entertaining. But the slapdash stitching of verse after verse of ""wacky"" DOOM manages to make one of the most consistently satisfying rappers go in one ear and out the other.","DOOM has the more scattershot pieces of his already scattershot discography compiled on this LP of lesser-known tracks.

The Unforgettable Fire [Deluxe Edition],U2,by: Ryan Dombal,Features Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6fbea9e61561daa54b3/1:1/w_160/ec15bbe8.jpg,2009-11-02 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13654-the-unforgettable-fire-deluxe-edition/,Mercury,"The first song on 1984's The Unforgettable Fire is called ""A Sort of Homecoming""-- not just ""A Homecoming"". And that shade of uncertainty-- that ""sort of""-- is key. Compared to U2's first three albums-- and almost everything that has come afterward-- The Unforgettable Fire is marked by a sketchy in-between-ness that works as a gracious foil to the the band's natural audacity. It's sort of stadium rock, sort of experimental, sort of spiritual, sort of subdued, sort of uncharacteristic, sort of brilliant, sort of a classic. After their first major breakthrough with 1983's War and its anthems ""Sunday Bloody Sunday"" and ""New Year's Day"", U2 could have easily continued to perfect the fist-pumping, flag-waving arena battle cry. Instead, they sought out producer Brian Eno, a bold choice for a band looking to parlay semi-success into something Springsteen-ian. While Eno is now seen as a go-to stadium savior (see: Coldplay's Viva La Vida), back then he was still the guy who coaxed magnificent weirdness out of David Bowie and Talking Heads, to say nothing of his own work, which ranged from prog-rock insanity to elegant wallpaper. The U2/Eno braintrust has since become one of the most out-and-out successful in rock history, but The Unforgettable Fire finds the pair-- along with frequent conspirator Daniel Lanois-- feeling each other out and testing limits. The album ebbs and flows along the spectrum between the spiky, post-punk U2 of old and the impressionistic, Eno-assisted U2 they were yearning to become. Not only were U2 and Eno an odd match musically, but their personalities clashed in a remarkable way as well. The album's interpersonal drama plays out on a half-hour making-of documentary originally released in 1984 and included in this reissue along with the remastered album and a disc of requisite B-sides and live cuts. While U2 were caricatured as honest and hardworking Irish boys who never met a stone-faced portrait they didn't admire, and Eno was the aloof London aesthete who openly mocked rock convention, you can watch the two subtly influencing each other throughout the intimate documentary. For example, after Bono is seen roiling himself into a frenzy while improvising over ""Pride (In the Name of Love)""-- screaming, sweating, and flailing like a wounded lunatic in the recording booth-- Eno is nearly left speechless before he utters a totally sincere understatement for the ages: ""I must say, this track is really bringing something out in your singing."" The producer's unflappable cool often leads to a fatherly kindness that goes lengths to explain his lasting appeal. The documentary, much like the album itself, humanizes U2 while fueling the idea that this band's head was completely up its own ass in the 80s. ""I believe the songs are already written, and I think the less you get in the way of them the better,"" says Bono at one point in the film, explaining his muse, ""The minute you take up that pen... you start interfering with the song-- I don't know if that sounds too spiritual."" And while I'm not sure if the idea that God is writing your songs is truly ""spiritual,"" it does sound quite presumptuous. But that's also the beauty of this band; whether in ironic or world-saving mode, their ambition is boundless. This can lead to garish stadium extravaganzas, but it can also birth something like ""Bad"", The Unforgettable Fire's centerpiece and one of the grandest arena-rock songs ever written. There's no half-assing ""Bad"". After years of radio repeats, the track seems commonplace, which is a testament to just how much U2 have burrowed their way into the world's collective musical memory. Because this six-minute monoculture moment chronicling the torment of heroin addiction has no discernible chorus. Its hook is a burning build passed down from the Velvet Underground's ""Heroin"". But whereas that song ends with Lou Reed smacked up and despondent-- ""And I guess I just don't know,"" he mutters-- ""Bad"" is the sound of revelation, recovery. ""I'm wide awake!"" belts Bono, triumphant in the face of isolation, desolation, and pretty much every other -ation there is. Once again, U2 put a patently cool underground icon-- this time it's Reed-- through their mega-band filter and end up with a song that sounds just as strong in record-collector headphones as it does to 100,000 fans physically forced to clap along by some primordial urge. The Reed tribute is cemented on the live version of ""Bad"", filmed at Live Aid and included in this package, where Bono introduces the song with a little ""Satellite of Love"" and ends it riffing on ""Walk on the Wild Side"". In between, the possessed singer jumps down from his high perch onstage to slow dance with a fan, effectively bringing some punk-inspired spontaneity and compassion to an event that typified notions of classic rock heroism. The performance single-handily upped U2's stock in the global rock realm, and it's easy to see why. So The Unforgettable Fire isn't U2's biggest commercial success (that would be The Joshua Tree) or its most rewarding artistic coup (Achtung Baby), but without it those records would not exist. It's a transitional album of the highest magnitude. The hits-- ""Pride"", ""Bad""-- still hit, and even its sometimes-derided abstractions like ""Promenade"" and ""Elvis Presley and America"" contain enough mystery to keep unraveling 25 years later. The opener tells of an ambiguous return. And ""A Sort of Homecoming"" would come to define this band's fascinating internal struggle between sticking to what they know and venturing toward something undiscovered.","U2's first collaboration with Brian Eno and Daniel Lanois comes across as a transitional album of the highest magnitude.

III,Espers,by: Tom Breihan,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6efb1335d7bf1698f39/1:1/w_160/4171a3b0.jpg,2009-10-30 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13642-iii/,Drag City,"When Philly collective Espers entered the stage with their 2004 self-titled LP, they rode the freak-folk wave that was then taking over indie and made it freakier, adding a spaced-out acid-rock sensibility that took them to some unexplored middle ground between Bert Jansch and Hawkwind. When I interviewed Devendra Banhart around that time, Banhart made a big point about how the new weird America vanguard wasn't actually folk at all, pointing out along the way that the Espers folks were all big Sabbath fans. Made perfect sense. Chuck Eddy (my former editor at The Village Voice), once pointed out that that first album-- and the one after it, 2006's II-- sounded like wispy, atmospheric goth-metal (Katatonia, say, or Candlemass) with all the metal stuff stripped away. Totally true. It also sounded something like screwed-and-chopped Renn Faire music. It was some seriously blissed-out opium-den shit. On III opener ""I Can't See Clear"", something's different. The tempo has crept up a couple of notches. The drums are actually audible in the mix. Meg Baird's voice remains as otherworldly as ever, but she's using it to sing a relatively straightforward melody. In short, ""I Can't See Clear"" sounds like pure Renn Faire music-- not screwed, not chopped, just straight. There's still a great little psych guitar lead in there, but the addictive gloom of previous albums is gone. And, for the most part, it stays gone throughout III. Only one song breaks the six-minute barrier. The vocals, from Baird and leader Greg Weeks, aren't quite so buried in the mix. The arrangements come relatively packed and, at times, almost choked or cluttered. When violins start dive-bombing the lovely ethereal acoustic harmonies of ""Sightings"", for instance, it's like the band is actively resisting the afghan-rug rapture they're capable of. So what we've got here is Espers' move toward simplicity and directness, a look that doesn't suit them especially well. Those arrangements are a big part of the problem. Weeks has numbers at his disposal-- the first time I saw Espers live, they peaked at 12 people onstage. And on III, he apparently can't resist using those numbers. So moments that would've worked fine with just an acoustic guitar or a murmuring organ get both, plus a spindly violin or a flanged-out electric guitar or some kind of mandolin thing. When you're using all these folks to crank out some sort of stoned drone-raga, it works a whole lot better than when you're trying to play a simple folk song. The songs on III seem to want to be simple folk songs. And unlike on previous albums, the players aren't always pushing each other higher into new celestial realms. Sometimes, they're just getting in each other's way. And yet there's an implacable heaviness to this band that III doesn't even come close to dissipating. Moments on the album rank among the band's heaviest, and a few of the riffs here (on ""That Which Darkly Thrives"", on ""Meridian"") could be just utterly kick-ass stoner metal riffs if played on huge distorted guitars rather than tiny lutes or whatever. If Espers don't float off into the ether on III as often as they once did, they still get closer, more often, than just about anyone else who came to prominence during our last great freak-folk wave. Long may they eerily flutter.","Philly collective of freak-folkers-- led by Greg Weeks and Meg Baird-- move toward simplicity and directness.

Opiate Sun,Jesu,by: Jess Harvell,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6bab1335d7bf1698ec4/1:1/w_160/a1238056.jpg,2009-10-30 06:00:03,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13600-opiate-sun/,Caldo Verde,"The EP might be the ideal format for Justin Broadrick's music, regardless of his alias. Whether he's trying to erase your head via concrete-slab guitars in Napalm Death, reduce techno to a series of clockwork hammerblows with Final, or massage your pleasure centers with neo-shoegaze in Godflesh, Broadrick's music has a laudable singularity. The three-or-four-song dose mainlines his all-consuming mood of the moment without the potential dilution of trying to fill up a CD. Broadrick claims to be channeling his long-unused (or presumed non-existent) pop instincts via Jesu, and the band's DNA always has too much of hard rock's cathartic oomph and pop's peaks and valleys to pass for ambient. But Jesu's extended-players like Silver, Lifeline, and now Opiate Sun do seem to bring out Broadrick's more memorable riffs and choruses. If nothing else, they foreground those riffs and ringing climaxes in a way that the hour-plus ebb-and-flow of Jesu or Conqueror isn't designed to do. Opiate Sun isn't as good as the all-over bodiless sparkle of Lifeline, which may be the best non-collaborative release in Broadrick's unwieldy discography. It's more of a Jesu sampler, a four-song distillation of the band's major modes, with some of Broadrick's most accessible, ingratiating songwriting-- radio-ready if not for the tempos and the fuzz. ""Losing Streak"" and the title track are more or less arena alt-rock at a snail's pace, almost cuddly and triumphant enough to be a Foo Fighters single, or maybe Probot if Dave Grohl had drafted Kevin Shields instead of Lemmy. (Plus, I swear, a hint of slow-motion southern rock grandeur in ""Losing Streak""'s mid-song solo.) ""Deflated"" is one of those oxymorons Jesu do so well-- the angelic dirge-- with bass skirting doom metal while the guitar auditions for some early-1990s Creation Records A&R dude. ""Morning Light"" really is doom, the only out-and-out metal tune here, skewed only by Broadrick's multi-tracked sad-dude vox. Add it all up and (more or less) you've got Jesu. So Opiate Sun is both the most recent fix for Jesu addicts anxiously awaiting album número tres, and an easy-access jump-on point for not-quite-yet-fans. Opiate Sun's heavy enough to act as gateway drug for those who still know Broadrick only as the guy behind Godflesh's decade-long bad day (if such creatures even exist). It will please the post-'gaze guitar-texture freaks who cream on contact with sonorous feedback. And it's memorable enough to hook those one-and-done consumers of the album-abjuring age. Not bad for four songs.","Stop-gap EP from Justin Broadrick's most pop-oriented project foregrounds his memorable riffs and ringing climaxes.

Beak> sounds like almost nothing else going around in 2009, though admittedly some of it sounds an awful lot like 1971. It's menacing and even potentially alienating. It's a work of loving pastiche with none of the deadening, touchy-feely hesitancy you can get when musicians attempt to wrestle with their heroes and wind up embarrassed by their own hubris halfway through the process. Beak> is off the cuff in the best sense, a burst of itchy inspiration. Many of the same influences colored Portishead's Third, but Beak> unshackle them from singer and song structure, gaining intensity for what it loses in memorability. There's a ruthlessness to Barrow's writing here, especially in regards to rhythm. Barrow understands the appeal of Can in full-tilt flow-motion far better than the average band who earns the comparison because they swipe a Jaki Liebezeit drum pattern every now again But while the stamp of Cologne's finest is all over Beak>-- mixed with a little Neu! on ""Iron Action""-- Barrow's more interested in figuring out what gave Can's records their vibe, rather than Xeroxing their jams. ""Pill"" evokes that classic krautrock feeling of wandering clammy castle halls, getting dripped on by condensation as you try to find the band you could swear you heard jamming on one fierce, hypnotic note. All the vocals on Beak> seem to emanate from the far end of one of those hallways, like the mumbly moans of ""I Know"", vocals that don't suggest dread or terror so much as a low-grade but fully saturated eeriness. There's something plain off about Beak's tense vibe -- a creepy hollowing-out of rock's usual boundless energy. In one sense it's a vibe not so far removed from Portishead proper, minus Beth Gibbons' drama-queening. But it's hard to imagine Portishead ever writing ""Ham Green"", which noodles for a while before dropping the boom with 1970s doom metal's ""let's drink Cisco by the train tracks and call it a seance"" camp menace, funny and coarse in a way you just don't associate with the trio that made Barrow famous. Of course, Beak> don't have Portishead's moments of mannered majesty, either. There's certainly nothing as emotionally overwhelming as ""The Rip"" on Beak>, and compared to Third, this is obviously the ""lesser"" work. But that looseness and liberating inconsequentiality is kind of the point. You're getting Barrow's obsessions here, unfiltered, and Beak> is as full of odd, compulsive energy as you'd expect from something cranked out in two weeks, made by a guy who probably had creative fuel to burn, considering that his day job took 11 years between their second and third albums. This is Barrow off the leash and free to chase the beat.","Portishead's Geoff Barrow unveils an odd, menacing, and even potentially alienating work that sounds more like 1971 than 2009.

Sainthood,Tegan and Sara,by: Joshua Klein,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6f0b1335d7bf1698f3e/1:1/w_160/2199125f.jpg,2009-10-30 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13644-sainthood/,Vapor,"Carefully selected case studies could convince you anyone can be a star with a well-timed leak, blog post, or P2P push, but there are still few substitutes for good ol' fashioned hard work. Case in point: Tegan and Sara, who have worked their way up from cult status to wider prominence through a steady regimen of touring and a gradual musical evolution and maturation that's made it harder to ignore their increasingly impressive achievements. Those achievements peaked to date with 2007's The Con, but that shouldn't negate the merits of the Canadian Quin sisters' somewhat likeminded follow-up, Sainthood. The Con, sympathetically produced by Chris Walla, found Tegan and Sara trading the occasional preciousness and banal power-pop tropes of their earlier work for something more eclectic and personal, and Sainthood, which once again enlists Walla, continues to showcase the pair's confidence and peculiarities. What's different is that the Quins have closed the aperture ever so slightly, retaining some of the character of the album's predecessor while applying a slightly sharper focus to the songs and their musical scope. In theory, tracks like ""Don't Rush"", ""Hell"", ""The Cure"", and ""The Ocean"" count as power-pop, but tightly wound as they are, they're closer to high-strung 1980s new wave (think: Missing Persons), albeit thankfully short on the attendant affectations and coursing with subtly dark undercurrents. ""I've got the cure for you,"" sings Tegan in ""The Cure"", and in fact, given the enigmatic lyrics, it's unclear if the object of her attention should accept or refuse the help. Or whether they even have a choice. Those aforementioned songs, incidentally, are Tegan's-- the more pop-oriented of the pair. But to set up such a dialectic does a disservice to sister Sara, whose own pop instincts clear the quirkier hurdles of songs like ""Arrow"" or ""Red Belt"". Certainly, ""On Directing"" or ""Alligator""-- two obvious album highlights, the latter playing like a late-night backroom flip of Madonna's ""Holiday""-- don't lack in hooks, but they're developed with a welcome austerity and Sara's disinclination for easy ""big moment"" build up and release. Sara's ""Sentimental Tune"" is no less restrained; it could easily go for Kelly Clarkson bombast, and maybe would even be better for it, but kept in check, that song-- like Sainthood as a whole-- achieves a less immediate but perhaps more gratifying impact. The album's infectious, but with enough edge to temper its undeniable desire to connect. Which it does, just on its own terms, a broadcast from two idiosyncratic musical minds whose biggest talent may be in making their most eccentric traits sound downright normal. After all, from the Quin twins' perspective it's the audience that's accessible, and they know just how to reach them.","The Quin twins follow their career peak The Con with another eclectic and personal record.

What Will We Be,Devendra Banhart,by: Grayson Currin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6f15e6ef95969320e69/1:1/w_160/4a96ac64.jpg,2009-10-30 06:00:00,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13645-what-will-we-be/,Warner Bros.,"Within one five-month span during 2004, Devendra Banhart-- a hirsute, multilingual, 23-year-old enigma with a wanderer's tale to tell and a sprawling, intriguing debut to his name-- released two 16-song albums: the near-flawless Rejoicing in the Hands and its less cohesive though memorable follow-up, Niño Rojo. He sang about human fragility and little yellow spiders, about old folk songs and with old folk singers, about the beauty of beards and the wealth of the world. With a versatile warble and a graceful touch to the guitar, Banhart seemed slightly manic yet strangely endearing, the rare eccentric who could turn the lightest of larks into irresistible bits of tunes. That winter, the magazine Harp likened him to Van Morrison, John Lennon, and Jeff Buckley, saying he possessed ""a deeper connection to the cosmos than most of us share."" By year's end, Banhart had emerged as the preeminent songwriter and personality of what was generally dubbed New Weird America, or freak-folk. He was bound, it seemed, for some bigger glory. Banhart pursued that career in the most expected fashion: In 2005, he left Young God Records and Michael Gira, the small independent label and producer that had served as his guide, for XL, an international imprint of the label group that controls 4AD, Matador, and Rough Trade. Two subsequently guest-heavy records followed and looked to expand beyond those fundamental early works. Disjointed psychedelia concerned with seahorses, nothing tunes about Chinese children, smeared ballads about the war, the Beatles, and the slow burn of memory: Altogether inconsistent but often interesting, those albums seemed to find Banhart pursuing a global vernacular he'd yet to define. His audience grew, certainly, but, with these experiments, real fame still seemed beyond his grasp. He began dating a Hollywood starlet, hired Neil Young's manager, Elliot Roberts, and landed a big-time booking agent. A spotty supergroup with some friends and a New York rockstar followed, as did a bit role in a teenage romance and songs doled out to soundtracks and commercials. And, earlier this year, he signed to Reprise Records, home to Young, among many others-- a platform, it would seem, for [#script:http://pitchfork.com/media/backend/js/tiny_mce/themes/advanced/langs/en.js]|||||| that bigger glory. So one might assume that now is the time for Banhart to complete that cliché ascendance-- to make a levelheaded album of straightforward songs that stands a chance of selling. Well, maybe next time... At first glance, What Will We Be-- Banhart's sixth album and his first for Reprise-- does feel a bit like the kind of record that might break him to an audience on the right side of an FM dial or using WiFi at Starbucks. ""16th & Valencia, Roxy Music"", after all, is an agile, escapist folk-disco rave about ""ridin' six white horses"" and ""free dancin'."" ""Rats"" is a Led Zeppelin-baiting anthem with a midsection about, again, dancing, kissing, and general merriment. And from the bright-eyed opener ""Can't Help But Smiling"" through the whispered, pale country boogie of ""Goin Back"", the album's first quarter offers a rather sunny, upbeat initiation. Banhart's writing seems normalized, too: ""Love is the only thing truly worth needing,"" he posits at one point. ""Every kiss that we miss is another life we don't live,"" at another. Love, drinks, drugs, colloquialisms, creation myths: What Will We Be could be a great big common lawn for aged hippies, album-rock veterans, and college-rock kids alike. But across its 14 tracks and 50 minutes, What Will We Be again sounds like Banhart's attempt to prove he can take risks and sound interesting without his acoustic guitar. A mess of scrambled styles that ostracizes more often than it charms, at least one-third of this record plays like a batch of covers cribbed from one of those Putamayo world-music collections at Whole Foods. ""Angelika"" veers left from its Brazilian-cum-bluegrass lilt to show it can samba and Banhart can twist and yowl in Spanish. ""Foolin'"" splices reggae with the Beatles and succeeds in sounding just slightly less milquetoast than Eric Clapton's turn at island music. Meanwhile, first single ""Baby"" gets goofy about romance (which makes you say ""holy moly"" and feel like a bow-tied kangaroo, apparently) over a flimsy highlife trot. And every time Banhart lands something genuinely agreeable, he finds a way to hamstring it: ""Walilamdzi"", one of the most wistful tunes in Banhart's catalog, is a simple fingerpicked reverie. Sung in the mostly lost language of Northern California's Pit River Indians, though, it comes with an inherently off-putting defense. And it's not enough that ""The First Song for B"" is the latest in a series of sublime Banhart piano ballads. No, it meanders into the acoustic morass ""The Last Song for B"", where Banhart listlessly intones, ""A movement/ Attunement/ A new dream/ Beyond dream."" Who knew it was so easy to sound more vague than Akron/Family? In 2004, Banhart sang, ""It's like finding home in an old folk song/ That you've never ever heard/ Still you know every word/ And, for sure, you can sing along."" And that's how those early records felt-- familiar yet foreign, as if Banhart had found and reshaped something we didn't know we'd lost. Favorable reviews of What Will We Be will likely toss off adjectives like multicultural or eclectic and epithets like polyglot or plunderer. ""He's only exploring,"" they'll say. But Banhart's third album of unhinged stylistic exploration feels more like a reach than a quest-- a timid attempt to distract with a grab bag of forms rather than to engage any one idea with vigor and innovation. We're left with songs afraid to stake interesting artistic claims (""Goin Back"" puts the Flying Burrito Brothers in an autoclave) or defend them (see the needlessly circuitous ""Chin Chin & Muck Muck"") for very long. More focused on offering Banhart's international and oddball bona fides than crafting songs that feel at all like home, What Will We Be finds Banhart in need of direction and editing. Or, as Banhart sings on that awful dance tune of his, ""We don't know what to do."" Here's hoping that, someday soon, he may figure it out.","The preeminent songwriter and personality of New Weird America moves to Reprise without losing any of his eclecticism or quirk.

Smoke the Monster Out,Damian Lazarus,by: Tim Finney,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a53fb1335d7bf1698b5b/1:1/w_160/809e56d1.jpg,2009-10-29 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13307-smoke-the-monster-out/,Get Physical,"This year marks the 10-year anniversary of Position Normal's excellent debut album of found sound sample-tapestries, Stop Your Nonsense. You may not have celebrated, but I'm betting Damian Lazarus did. Lazarus has seen fit to shoehorn Position Normal tracks into his compilations on two occasions-- once in 2000, and again in 2006-- and the little-known act's influence is all over his own debut album, Smoke the Monster Out. When not stanning for Position Normal, the UK DJ and producer has spent the past 10 years setting himself up as a kind of bellwether for middlebrow trends in house and techno: He co-ran early electroclash label City Rockers, before jumping off at the exact right moment to form his own platform Crosstown Rebels. Like many dance labels in the middle of the decade, the latter imprint smoothly charted the successive rises and falls of electro-house and then minimal as the clued-in European clubber's soundtrack of choice, and Lazarus' Rebel Futurism Session Two mix from 2005 is one of the absolute best snapshots from the center of these stylistic drifts. How to reconcile a penchant for idiosyncratic, functionless sample collages with a career based on giving the crowd what it wants? At some point Lazarus must have realized that, if you drew a line between these two impulses, in the middle you'd find those ""soundtracks to imaginary films"" that dance producers and rockers both intermittently turn to when they feel like alienating their audiences. So what's remarkable about Smoke the Monster Out is how it pursues this strategy while also sounding inviting and gregarious at every turn. In this, and in the album's clean lines and uncluttered rhythms, Lazarus follows the example of Booka Shade, who have comprehensively staked out this minimal-as-soundtrack territory, for better (their first two full-lengths, their DJ-Kicks mix) or worse (their tepid last album). Still, Lazarus' impatient, rifling pose feels kind of unique, most ostentatiously on ""Moment"", which flits from forlorn-sounding British nursery rhyming to a smooth Björkalike chanteuse to clipped spoken word to warped baritone mewling, while the music slips from winsome tinkles through steady house pulses, on to clattering percussion, and then eerie strings and horn sections. He knows how to make the transitions subtle, but still, that's a lot of ground to cover. If the ideas-per-track count is slightly lower elsewhere, this is only relative: ""Come & Play"" curiously combines a gorgeous, nervous but torpid house groove with more ethereal vocals and self-conscious samples from Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds' ""Red Right Hand"" (""with your red hand, come and play,"" the singer acknowledges in some cryptic allusion to copyright). ""Neverending"" is cheerful, fidgety anthemic vocal house whose marvelously fuzzed-out clomp almost makes up for its laconic, semi-Auto-Tuned indie vocals. Closing track ""After Rave Delight"", all haunting chimes and honeyed vocoder choruses, veers between moving and repellant. But the inviting median position Lazarus occupies hinders as much as helps his cause, as this music seems never quite to satisfy completely any of the goals it sets itself. Only on the 45-second ""King of Fools"" does Lazarus let his sampladelic tendencies run free, with a garbled TV jingle for monster children that's straight Position Normal. Perhaps more surprisingly, there's not a single moment here that feels like it would really blow up a dancefloor, the producer's understanding of groove left underutilized. If this music were darker and more difficult, it might attract a cult following, but I suspect the very audience Lazarus most desperately wants to cultivate will find his halfway-house constructions too obvious in their reliance on melodious emotionalism. This is a shame, but I hope it also acts as a goad: Lazarus owes it to himself and to us find even better ways to make his divergent impulses run together somehow.","UK-born, L.A.-based producer tries to reconcile a penchant for idiosyncratic sample collages with a career based on giving the crowd what it wants.

Strict Joy,The Swell Season,by: Joshua Klein,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6d4c0084474cd0c0a5e/1:1/w_160/89f00d4f.jpg,2009-10-29 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13624-strict-joy/,Anti-,"The two are so inextricably linked that it's easy to forget the Swell Season actually preceded Once, the little movie that rocketed Glen Hansard and Markéta Irglová to global fame. For that matter, several of the songs on that film's breakthrough soundtrack precede the film, too. In fact, ""Falling Slowly""-- the standout track from the film and the song that won the Swell Season its Academy Award for Best Original Song-- first appeared on the Swell Season's 2006 debut and soon after on The Cost-- the sixth album by Hansard's underdog band the Frames. Which all goes to show the power of a prescribed narrative to trump the natural progression of a real life, though in the case of the Swell Season Hansard and Irglova have made it increasingly difficult to separate fact from fiction. The film focused on two struggling musicians falling in love, and over the course of its making and promotion Hansard and Irglova themselves did indeed become lovers. While no longer a couple, the pair continue to work together in the Swell Season, so it's hard to keep in mind that Strict Joy, the band's second album, is a sequel to its first and not, as the prescribed narrative dictates, a sequel to the film and the emotions it captured. It is complicated, however, considering this new collection of songs of romance gone wrong and right may in fact be a musical document of an actual break-up. Or, depending on the provenance of each track, a break-up that already happened. Even separated from the impact and influence of the film, a new Swell Season album-- or Frames album, or Hansard album, or Hansard and Irglova album-- would have likely gravitated to similar themes. And yet listening to songs like the fragile, heartbreakingly intimate ""In These Arms"" or the lovely Irglova-led ""Fantasy Man"" free from the pull of Once proves impossible, though never to the disc's detriment. The tracks don't sound forced or awkward as they follow well-trod lyrical roads littered with wounded ""you""s and ""I""s, they sound honest, and an honest love song as always is hard to resist. Slightly easier to ignore are jazzy, workmanlike Van Morrison nods like ""Low Rising"", ""Feeling the Pull"", and ""Love That Conquers""-- not due to lack of craft or merit but simply due to the familiarity of the model. Elsewhere, when they're not sticking to gorgeously clear-eyed ballads like ""Two Tongues"" or ""I Have Loved You Wrong"", which highlight the duo's vocal chemistry, Hansard and Irglova do right with the atmospheric alt-MOR of ""The Verb"", ""High Horses"", and ""The Rain"", an album highlight that merges the passion of the Frames with the Swell Season's slightly gentler bent. Now that the prescribed narrative has run its course, it'll be interesting to hear where the pair heads next (assuming they keep it up), not because what they've recorded so far is necessarily exceptional or unique, but because at this point the story is clearly bigger than the band itself. From here on out, the Swell Season is making it up as they go along, and there's no reason Strict Joy shouldn't entice all its new and old fans to come along as well.","The Oscar-winning duo made famous in the popular indie film Once returns with their first post-film (and post-breakup) record.

Let's Build a Roof,LAKE,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6ca5e6ef95969320e11/1:1/w_160/39aa4f0b.jpg,2009-10-29 06:00:02,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13613-lets-build-a-roof/,K,"LAKE seem like a chipper lot, so I feel kinda bad calling out the title of their album as bullshit. The ""let's"" part I get-- the Olympia, Wash., group's second K Records LP is definitely a team effort, switching up between three complementary vocalists and they're on a label almost synonymous with community. But it's a major stretch to think about this remarkably sunny album soundtracking the construction of anything, let alone something intended to keep mother nature out. Opener ""Breathing"" is certainly one for the beach chairs, a lulling piece of Pac-NW by way of Glasgow tunesmithery, but don't lose sight of how carefully it's composed. There's plenty going on, but it never feels like these instruments are fighting for space-- tambourines shake in and out of the mix, along with piano tones, acoustic strums, and glittering electric leads. It's indicative of LAKE's ability to sound simultaneously airy and earthy. Eli Moore's sleepy vocals deliver a catchy but subtly complex song, while Karl Blau's production lends a natural but never Spartan tidiness. Similarly, ""Loose Wind"" is gorgeous, threatening to drift off into the ether before a surprisingly clangorous bridge leads into one of Roof's many sumptuous horn charts. But it's unfair to play these guys off as softies: ""Sing 99 & 90"" sports a deceptively rugged garage-rock arrangement to back up some clever back and forth between the vocals. A shroud of reverb surrounds the harmonies of exploratory midpoint ""The Roof Caves In"", before a strange, dissonant guitar riff leads it off the grid. Minutes later, ""Remote Control Cars"" is likely the slinkiest song ever written about camping, but even as an instrumental, it shows LAKE's ease with more soul-inflected sounds, working in the album's most buoyant horn chart. Perhaps most impressive is how Let's Build a Roof traverses so much ground without making a big deal about it. Between the polyrhythmic ""Gravel"" and ""Madagascar""'s sojourn into Margaritaville, it's amazing that LAKE never seem to be playing to the hackey-sack set. Similarly, closer ""Christmas Island"" cops a Camera Obscura feel without sounding derivative. So yeah, maybe Let's Build a Roof isn't a good indication of what to expect here: Oh, the Places We'll Go might've been the name of their last album, but it captures the playfulness and easygoing adventure of this outing as well.","The Olympia, Wash., group continues quietly to build an impressive arsenal of indie pop songs.

Axe to Fall,Converge,by: Cosmo Lee,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6d3ea9e61561daa5457/1:1/w_160/55039f06.jpg,2009-10-29 06:00:01,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13625-axe-to-fall/,Epitaph,"Converge are this generation's Black Flag. This generation might not remember Black Flag, so here's a refresher. In the early 1980s, Black Flag and peers like Bad Brains and Minor Threat took punk beyond ""three chords and the truth."" The result was hardcore punk. It was deliberately ugly and harsh; Clash-fetishizing critics have mostly ignored it. Black Flag epitomized DIY-- they booked their own shows, handed out their own flyers, rehearsed with military discipline, and put out records on guitarist Greg Ginn's label, SST. Despite shifting lineups, their mission never wavered: to destroy. Destruction isn't Converge's agenda. They differ from Black Flag in that aspect: They build things up, not tear them down. But they can do so because of Black Flag's groundwork. Black Flag made it okay to fight cops, to fight fans, and to do what punk always promised but rarely did: be oneself. The band was both explosive and implosive. It was destined to end. Converge have learned from Black Flag's mistakes. They work as a team and have taken DIY to new levels. Singer Jacob Bannon runs the Deathwish, Inc. label and does artwork for Converge and other bands. Guitarist Kurt Ballou runs a recording studio and has become this generation's Steve Albini. Bassist Nate Newton and drummer Ben Koller have made waves with other bands like Doomriders and Cave In. Together, they whip up a catharsis matched by few. They play hard and wear their hearts on their sleeves. As a result, kids in droves wear Converge on their sleeves. (The band's Twitter handle is ""convergecult."") No other current punk band's imagery is as iconic. The face on the cover of 2001's Jane Doe, the hand on the cover of 2004's You Fail Me-- they are the Black Flag bars of today. The band wasn't always so potent. It took a few albums to work through a wiry hybrid of mathcore and metal. Jane Doe was Converge's watershed, honing their sound to a lean, abrasive essence. Over You Fail Me and 2006's No Heroes, it expanded to include slower, abstract sludge. Black Flag went through a similar transformation. Their landmark album My War was equal parts lightning and Black Sabbath. Axe to Fall is Converge's My War. The album is, to quote The Exorcist and Pantera, a vulgar display of power. Bannon's howl is exfoliating. His lyrics aren't hard to parse: ""I need to learn to love me""; ""No longer feel anyone/ No longer fear anything."" Basic stuff, but it reaches deep and pulls no punches. Ballou's guitar dials up the crackle of Metallica's Kill 'Em All. It gallops, shoots electric arcs, dives down to subterranean depths. Ballou mines the upper register more than ever before, turning leads into leitmotifs. The frenzied pull-offs in ""Dark Horse"" are pure Kirk Hammett; the supercharged chug of ""Reap What You Sow"" recalls the fire of early Megadeth. Ballou isn't really playing metal-- his band is too short-haired and quirky for that-- but he's out-metalling 99% of metal bands today. The title track rotates through thrash beats, blastbeats, and d-beats like a race car driver shifting gears. It's fast, greasy, and loud as a motherfucker. Axe to Fall isn't all axes, though. It's also anvils and stone pillows and beds of fallen leaves. The record is perfectly sequenced. It starts with three seamless barnburners, then settles into smooth toggling between slow and fast. The slow numbers likely won't get live airing-- kids prefer speed-- but they're amazing constructions of texture and friction. Near the end, piano and glockenspiel make like Tom Waits and Godspeed You! Black Emperor. They're elegiac and haunting, an inversion of the napalm death that preceded them. A huge array of guests help out, representing acts like Disfear, 108, Genghis Tron, and Neurosis. They are too many to list, but the bottom line is, they work. Whether they're yelling, singing, or laying down leads, they fit their songs. And that in itself is fitting.","One of the decade's best metal and post-hardcore bands finish the 2000s with one of its best records.

Live at the Olympia,R.E.M.,by: Matthew Perpetua,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6ecc0084474cd0c0a9d/1:1/w_160/56a57395.jpg,2009-10-29 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13641-live-at-the-olympia/,Warner Bros.,"Unlike most canonical, highly celebrated artists with a large catalog of albums, there is no generally accepted entry point to the R.E.M. discography. They don't have a Daydream Nation, a Bee Thousand, an Enter The Wu-Tang (36 Chambers), or a Thriller. The band has a large number of classic albums, and each is distinct enough to have its own passionate partisans and detractors. Except for the most hardcore fans, most anyone with a love for R.E.M. seems to have some cut-off point where their interest falls off dramatically. For older fans, it's often the bombastic arena fodder of Lifes Rich Pageant and Document. If you fell for the group at the height of ""college rock"" in the late 1980s, there is a good chance that you either tuned out during that strange cultural moment when they achieved their greatest commercial success as a morbid chamber pop outfit, or the even weirder abrasive day-glo glam-rock phase that came immediately afterward. More obviously, the departure of the band's original drummer and co-songwriter Bill Berry practically gave a large chunk of their audience permission to jump ship and/or casually dismiss their post-Berry material. Part of the problem in how people understand the band's catalog is that there is no adequate career-spanning retrospective for R.E.M., and, almost as if by design, their body of work does not fit comfortably into a tidy narrative spanning from 1982's Chronic Town on through the present day. The three existing collections that focus on their IRS Records albums service that period well, but at this point those releases amount to only the first act of the band's story. The only hits collection focused on their Warner Bros. output is an unfortunate mess that omits songs like ""Shiny Happy People"", ""Drive"", and ""Bang and Blame"" in favor of less popular singles and lackluster bonus tracks that needlessly distort chronology. Whereas artists with similarly sprawling discographies with multiple peaks, such as David Bowie, Bob Dylan, and Prince, have anthologies and singles compilations that satisfy casual listeners and provide a useful starting point for new fans, the hit-centric approach has a perverse way of underselling R.E.M. and their legacy. ""Shiny Happy People"", ""Stand"", and ""Everybody Hurts"" may be excellent songs, but they are not particularly representative of the band's core identity as a folk-tinged rock band. Live at the Olympia, a 39-song live album recorded over a five-night public rehearsal at a small venue in Dublin in 2007, is not the ideal gateway collection the band needs, but it does a provide an intriguing tour through the band's body of work that avoids obvious selections and highlights deep cuts and forgotten favorites. About a third of the set is comprised of raw and/or unfinished drafts of songs that would later turn up on 2008's Accelerate. The rest comes across like an alternate universe version of R.E.M. that made all the same records as in our world, but never had a significant hit after 1985's ""Driver 8"", and thus do not feel pressure to perform anything but whatever feels best in the moment. The tracklisting is heavy on early-80s material-- five tunes from Fables of the Reconstruction, just over half of Reckoning, all but one cut off of Chronic Town. From there on out, they play at least one song from every album aside from Green, Out of Time, and Up. Their choices are often surprising, and a large chunk of the selections had not been performed in well over a decade, in some cases nearly 20 years. Michael Stipe's stage banter is self-deprecating, calling to attention how long it had been since revisiting some of the songs, and commenting on the crudeness and opacity of his early lyrics. There's a bit of nostalgia at play here, for sure, but it's very clear that this is not a desperate attempt to ingratiate themselves to older fans but instead a healthy reexamination of previous work in an attempt to reconnect with the essence of being a rock'n'roll band after nearly a decade of being more of a studio ensemble. Despite their longevity and numerous live concert films, Live at the Olympia is only R.E.M.'s second full-length live record. Their previous live album (which doubled as a DVD set) was released only a few months after the recording of these rehearsal concerts in 2007, and the difference between the two releases is quite stark. R.E.M. Live was tight, polished, and context-free, and as such was rather boring, even if it included several top-notch performances. Though nothing on Live at the Olympia matches or surpasses the group's studio recordings, the loose, playful, and occasionally sloppy performances are far more listenable. Sitting through all 39 tracks is hardly a chore if you already like most or all of the songs, and only the previously unreleased Accelerate outtake ""On the Fly"" and the Around the Sun dud ""The Worst Joke Ever"" drag at the momentum of the sequencing. The band sounds casual but charged with urgency and purpose as it attempts to rejuvenate itself and work its way out of the bad habits that yielded the sterility of Reveal and Around the Sun. Muscle memory guides them through spirited takes on ""Harborcoat"", ""Circus Envy"", ""Carnival of Sorts (Box Cars)"", and ""These Days"", while hunger for relevance and enmity directed toward the Bush administration give Accelerate numbers like ""Living Well Is the Best Revenge"", ""Horse to Water"", and ""Man-Sized Wreath"" a rush of vibrancy and vitality. The remarkable thing about Live at the Olympia is that, despite all appearances to the contrary, it actually has utility for people other than R.E.M. completists. The notion of a 2xCD set of rehearsal recordings smacks of unnecessary indulgence, but whether you take this as an alternative canon of R.E.M. music or a document of a band working hard to find its future by revisiting its past, the album is successful in providing a new perspective on a classic group desperately in need of a new narrative thread. Though it's doubtful that many uninitiated listeners or lapsed fans will find their way to this record, it does serve as a compelling argument in favor of a staggering body of work that is too often dismissed or outright ignored by modern indie audiences simply because the group had the nerve to keep making new material rather than retiring with a neat, easily digestible discography. This is definitely not the accessible, carefully curated survey their catalog deserves, but it's close enough for now.","This 2xCD LP, recorded over a five-night public rehearsal at a small venue in Dublin in 2007, attempts the colossal task of summing up a sprawling career.

Let's Just Stay Here,Carolyn MarkNQ Arbuckle,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6cb5e6ef95969320e15/1:1/w_160/0bec7c7e.jpg,2009-10-28 06:00:04,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13612-lets-just-stay-here/,Mint,"Warning: Let's Just Stay Here is not a Carolyn Mark album. It's a Carolyn Mark & NQ Arbuckle album. There's a big, slightly frustrating difference. Rather than a full set of songs written and sung by Mark-- songs that typically sparkle with self-deprecating, seen-it-all humor and delivered in her husky, dusky voice-- Let's Just Stay Here pairs her with the Toronto-based alt-country band, splitting singing and songwriting between her and frontman Neville Quinlan. He's a fine singer, with a deep, roughly textured voice that sounds a bit like Richard Buckner after a few years on the rodeo circuit, but as with most artists in this genre, his proximity to Mark reduces him to mediocrity. Really, only Neko Case has sung with Mark and come away unscathed. To be fair, NQ Arbuckle put up a good fight. Like Mark, Quinlan favors languorous country tunes full of concrete details and proper nouns that evoke the open highway or a decrepit roadhouse or a second-guessed relationship. Looking at life from a similarly skeptical perspective, he's fond of tragicomic lyrics full of grim humor and stabbing insights. ""Just 'cause you got chased by some bull makes you an honorary cowboy,"" he smirks on ""Saskatoon Tonight"", which might actually be a jab at bass player John Dinsmore, who was a bullfighter before joining the group. Not sure that's the guy you want to make fun of, especially when he's holding a big blunt instrument. Quinlan's best moment, however, comes early in the album: ""Officer Down"" is a well-observed consideration of marriage and music that manages to find a kernel of contentment in a tumultuous marriage. ""It's hard to be a good man listening to the Drive-By Truckers,"" he sings, not as an excuse but as a peek at his pathology. I've found just the opposite to be true, actually. In truth, there's a real spark between him and Mark, who previously sang together on her 2006 duets album, Just Married. Their voices blend well together as they trade off lead and backing duties, although a few more proper duets like ""Itchy Feet"", with its mandolin and wine bottle solos, would have showcased their chemistry a bit better. Mark gets top billing here for a reason. With her warm twang and nonchalant sass, she has an easy way with a song, settling into opener ""All Time Low"" and the closing title track like she's crashing on someone's especially cozy couch. ""You can't get dinner in Reno/ At a place that ain't a casino,"" she sings on ""All Time Low"", making the line sound like both a Zagat critique and a philosophical inquiry. And on ""The 2nd Time"", she turns a simple question-- ""How can the second time be an accident?"" which has a certain tramp-stamp wisdom-- into a massive, ""Hey Jude""-style sing-along, during which she calls out commands that the band and her live audiences can't help but obey. It takes NQ Arbuckle a few songs to finally find their niche with Mark, but by the album's second half, they've proved themselves a solid backing band. Thanks to a sturdy rhythm section and to the dueling guitars of Quinlan and Peter Kesper, they kick up a rambunctious honkytonk verve that sounds livelier than her last album, 2007's mostly acoustic Nothing Is Free. There's just the right amount of NQ Arbuckle on these songs, but not nearly enough Mark, who gets shunted to the margins of ""Too Sober to Sleep"" and ""When I Come Back"". She's a commanding presence relegated to a supporting role, and that imbalance means Let's Just Stay Here is never quite as rewarding or as satisfying as it should easily be.","One of alt-country's best vocalists and underrated songwriters collaborates with some Toronto-based kindred spirits.

Hors d'Oeuvres,Tickley Feather,by: Matthew Perpetua,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a693ea9e61561daa53d0/1:1/w_160/6bc757e7.jpg,2009-10-28 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13566-hors-doeuvres/,Paw Tracks,"In the early 1990s, lo-fi recording was a way for artists to wear their low economic status and limited resources as a badge of honor, and to emphasize a sense of intimacy and immediacy. The implication in early recordings by lo-fi luminaries such as Lou Barlow and John Darnielle was that the music was homemade and authentic, and the product was the result of pure inspiration with minimal technological intervention. In the case of Guided By Voices' Robert Pollard, the hum and fuzz of intentionally lousy recordings added aura and a patina of age to his dense audio collages, encouraging the notion that each track was a magical artifact unearthed from some lost, forgotten corner of rock'n'roll history. In the late 2000s, lo-fi production is a more confusing thing, having shifted from a matter of pragmatism to a sub-genre with its own dogma, canon, and stylistic offshoots. Reasonably decent digital home recording technology has never been more widely available, and as such, the impulse to create deliberately hissy and murky recordings has become more an artistic choice than a practical consideration. This is not meant to be a damning statement. The aesthetics of lo-fi are valid, and there is no reason for this style not to become a tradition unto itself long after technology has moved along. Annie Sachs, the musician known as Tickley Feather, is an artistic descendant of Robert Pollard. She has released two albums to date, and on both, lo-fi production is used mainly to create ambiance and suggest subtext rather than highlight rawness or spontaneity. Her sophomore effort, Hors d'Oeuvres, is about as sloppy and informal as her self-titled debut from 2008, but it is far more concise and deliberate in its construction. The record is largely successful in evoking a severely addled state of mind, but it fails to convey much more than wooziness. Sachs leans so hard on distortion and reverb that any potentially communicative element to her music is essentially obliterated. She sings on a majority of the cuts, but since her lyrics are entirely incomprehensible, the overall effect is rather like meeting someone who keeps quietly mumbling in your general direction, but mutters a peevish ""nevermind..."" if you ask them to speak up. Enigmatic evasiveness may be part of Sachs' project, but it denies her art from attaining any sort of depth. At best, Tickley Feather is only superficially interesting, and even then her briefest songs can try even a generous listener's patience. It is difficult not to suspect that her lo-fi approach is actually a preemptive defensive tactic intended to defuse criticism by foregrounding her limitations. If this is the case, Sachs is only holding herself back. Though her songwriting skill is rather amateurish, she occasionally displays a knack for melody that is smothered by her chintzy instrumentation and crude production. ""Trashy Boys"", the album's centerpiece and high point, has the potential to be quite good, but it suffers because Sachs' commitment to her aesthetic trumps her ability to fully commit to her songs. It is not necessary for her to project confidence, certainly not if she actually wants the music to feel shy and low-key, but there is a nagging sense throughout Hors d'Oeuvres that Sachs does not have faith in herself or her material, and it is incredibly off-putting. Though Sachs' music would be greatly improved by a more assertive spirit and a willingness to fully realize her best ideas, she need not abandon her lo-fi sensibility. Her ear for interesting synthesizer tones is one of her albums' saving graces, and she is generally effective in establishing her desired mood of vaguely sinister nostalgia. The lo-fi sound is not the problem; it's her inability to push her music beyond the realm of insecurity and self-indulgence. She doesn't need to hire a band or work in a studio, but she desperately needs some kind of boldness and ambition.","Annie Sachs, an artistic descendant of Robert Pollard, follows her self-titled 2008 debut with a far more concise and deliberate release.

Normal as Blueberry Pie - A Tribute to Doris Day,Nellie McKay,by: Scott Plagenhoef,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6da5e6ef95969320e34/1:1/w_160/739af459.jpg,2009-10-28 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13635-normal-as-blueberry-pie-a-tribute-to-doris-day/,Verve,"In one way or another, Nellie McKay has spent a decent chunk of her fruitful career paying tribute to Doris Day. Openly embracing the jazz and vocal standards of the Tin Pan Alley era, McKay, like Day, projects unaltered exuberance, shameless optimism, and brisk and effortless confidence. McKay is certainly more of an eccentric, but both singers carved out careers with a sense of control and precociousness that belied their ages. Each is also a polyglot in a way, working with a range of styles and sounds-- their understated, commanding vocals easily adaptable to a variety of sounds. All the more ironic then that most people know Day's career only from the playfully innocent films she made in the late 1950s and early 60s, particularly a trio of bedroom comedies co-starring Rock Hudson and Tony Randall. During that run of movies, Day usually portrayed a brash, independent, accomplished career woman (a union boss, a leading advertising executive, a journalism professor) who nevertheless projected both a lack of street smarts and a wholesome attitude toward sex-- she was essentially the original 40-year-old virgin. On her full-length tribute to the film and music star, Normal as Blueberry Pie, McKay redresses some of these misgivings, covering a wide range of Day's work, from her earliest hit, ""Sentimental Journey"", to ""Send Me No Flowers"", a Burt Bacharach/Hal David song that served as the title track to one of those bedroom comedies. For the most part though, McKay skips the hits, choosing instead lesser-known album and film tracks closely associated with Day along with selections from the Great American Songbook that Day tackled. Irony-free, McKay channels Day's elegance and liveliness on not only swing, Dixieland, and showtunes, but also makes detours into bossa nova and western-inspired songs. Not for nothing is the whole project named for a lyric from ""(I'm in Love With) A Wonderful Guy"", the South Pacific number that could double as a s [#script:http://pitchfork.com/media/backend/js/tiny_mce/themes/advanced/langs/en.js]|||||| ummation of Day's persona: It's a song about unaltered glee, feeling overjoyed rather than cynical about love, and aiming to convince others to think the same. One of the song's phrases, ""No more a smart little girl with no heart,"" could practically have been the tagline to most of those Day films above. To McKay, the song's aggressive optimism seems to work as a defiant personal statement to those who'd call her fixations on pre-rock music old-fashioned or a mere affection. (And as a bonus, the South Pacific character it was written for is named Nellie.) And so Day and McKay each shrug off claims of the corny or clichéd by embracing these qualities, proudly being themselves rather than playing dress-up. Similarly, their communicative, crystal-clear voices project subtlety, giving each a sense of normalcy and approachability. McKay does play with the material, often styling her voice in the sort of close-mic breathiness of the crooner era, or the wistful nouveau-cool of vocal jazz. She doesn't situate the songs in the arrangements of their time, however; instead, she typically leads with her piano and avoids the fuller, orchestral accoutrements that buffered Day's swing-era recordings. Appropriately, McKay takes the lead here-- embodying Day's time without being completely in debt to it. Her version of ""Sentimental Journey"" jumps immediately into the lyrics, for example, whereas Day's star-making version-- with music written, arranged, and credited to Les Brown-- allowed its creator and his Band of Renown to take center stage for almost half of its run time (as many songs of the day did). Similarly, McKay's version of the jazz standard ""Crazy Rhythm"" is blissfully free of the tap dancing that that dominates Day's version. Decisions like these, plus McKay's obvious affection rather than reverence for the material, make this a tribute rather than a pantomime. Normal is the rare tribute then that actually works to introduce and illuminate the songs it contains. McKay doesn't so much seize ownership of Day's songs as co-star with her hero. And with Day's having slipped from the public consciousness, McKay is presenting music that in many cases here is upwards of a half-century old. With the vogue in major American cities for speakeasy-style cocktails-- see NYC's Rye and Death & Co., Chicago's the Violet Hour and the Whistler, and San Fran's Bourbon & Branch-- it's not as old-fashioned and out of step as it may seem. Death & Co. even features a gin cocktail on its menu called the Sentimental Journey. Don't worry: If you're not ready to take the leap into Doris Day or Les Brown and the Band of Renown, they have another called the Joy Division.","The eccentric singer-songwriter pays tribute to the music of Doris Day, from classics like ""Sentimental Journey"" to lesser-known songs from films.

Kaleidoscope,Tiësto,by: Jess Harvell,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6dd5e6ef95969320e3a/1:1/w_160/e95a7d1c.jpg,2009-10-28 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13638-kaleidoscope/,Ultra,"I never thought I'd be typing these words, but: Tiësto makes me miss trance. Not that the genre really went anywhere. Certain kids still scream through all holes whenever a DJ drops a circa-1998 hiccuping synth line. Dudes like Armin Van Buuren are still compiling mix CDs full of recent tracks with titles like ""Satori Waterfalls"". (Really.) But like most of you reading this, I couldn't set foot in a trance club without a lethal chemical cocktail to mute my sense of shame, and keeping up with the mix CDs and ephemeral whatnot feels a little too pricey when the belt is tightened enough to risk amputation. So there's a new Tiësto CD, and I think, ""Hooray, a little walk down memory lane in a neighborhood I didn't really get to explore first time out."" Except Tiësto goes and makes some lame crossover electro-pop album larded with guest stars-- Jónsi from Sigur Rós, Kele Okereke from Bloc Party, Tegan and Sara, Nelly Furtado, Dizzee Rascal, which explains why we're writing about the thing in the first place-- that's ""trance"" in the way ""Poker Face"" and the recent crop of Britney singles are ""trance,"" i.e., you have to extend the definition to ""anything uptempo featuring programmed drums and synthesizers."" At which point you might as well throw in Hyperdub and ""Dare to Be Stupid"", too, you know? The difference between ""prime"" (again, weirded out to be writing this) Tiësto and nu-Tiësto is apparent just by scanning Kaleidoscope's tracklist. In 2004, the man was still releasing nine-track albums featuring 11-minute voyages into the smiley faced ultraworld. Here we get 17 songs (note noun choice there) averaging your pop-standard four-minutes-and-change-- a sure sign that a producer's shooting for blogland instead of clubland. On the other hand, this is a guy who released a cackhanded trance version of ""Adagio for Strings"" four years ago, so you might think this change to a popward direction isn't such a bad idea. But Kaleidoscope is terrible, a masterclass in half-assed dance-meets-pop ""songwriting"" that gets only slightly better when it leans on outright clichés, which Tiësto then beats 'til they're ugly. That's not even counting the times he rips off Todd Edwards (the title track), Justice (""Bend It Like You Don't Care""), and your current dance-rock act of choice (""Escape Me"") in a way that's both shameless and too technically adroit to induce enjoyable eye-rolls. Or the ""love is the message""/""universal harmony"" hippie drivel that becomes way harder to swallow when they stop being six-word catch phrases and start aspiring to actual lyrics (""I Am Strong""). The beats? They dutifully trudge along, never sounding like presets but never remotely wowing you, adding a little electro grit here, a little Van Dykian wax there. About the only time Kaleidoscope perks up is when it stops fucking around and decides to become a trance album. ""Louder Than Boom"" has to be something of a personal peak/nadir in this regard, with synth effects that sound like god's going for a new high score on his own personal tabletop Galaga. But these cheesy respites are too few and far between to even recommend Kaleidoscope as nostalgia for the trance-deprived. The problem with dance producers trying to reclaim the sounds that pop producers have been swiping for over a decade is that by now the pop producers are just too good at it, along with the added bonus of (sometimes) having singers and (certainly) song-doctors to add that extra special radio pixie dust. When Diddy steals your vocab and starts spitting out gems, you need to come harder than Kaleidoscope in response.","Trance superstar trades voyages into the smiley faced ultraworld for collaborations with Sigur Rós, Bloc Party, Tegan and Sara, and more.

5: Five Years of Hyperdub,Various Artists,by: Mike Powell,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6ccc0084474cd0c0a4e/1:1/w_160/4e92fb7b.jpg,2009-10-28 06:00:00,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13614-5-five-years-of-hyperdub/,Hyperdub,"Beatportal.com user Yield Load thinks ""dubstep is wicked music, but I didn't know how your suppose to dance to it."" The grammar's not there, but the idea is: Dubstep-- the nocturnal, claustrophobic subgenera of British electronic music that emerged from garage and 2-step-- is descended from dance music but doesn't sound like it's made for dancing. The tempos feel slow, the mood is usually threatening, lonely, or both. If there's any movement I can imagine going comfortably with dubstep, it's what Three 6 Mafia's DJ Paul rapped about on ""Side 2 Side"", and the standard step at indie-rock shows worldwide: ""I'm in the club posted up, got my arms folded... twistin' my body from side to side."" Of all the videos of dubstep dancing I clicked through online, two stick out in my mind. One is by an overweight teenager in what is likely his parents' living room, a decorative ship's lifesaver on the wall between what appear to be illustrations of the seaside, a large desktop computer at one end of the room, an open door leading to a yard on the other. A track by the producer Skream comes on, and he starts to move his fists up and down like a child banging steadily on a table, taking very deliberate steps across a carpet. That's it. The other is of two men, one black and one white, dressed in suits, dancing in some kind of white, computer-generated void, as the names of their dance steps flash across the bottom of the screen. My favorite is called ""Lost in the woods (with bewildered stare)"". I don't know if the comedy was intentional. Either way, it's a sign that dubstep has reached a particular position of cultural importance: hundreds of thousands of people are watching a suburban kid dance to it on YouTube. Hyperdub is usually cited as dubstep's most prominent and progressive label, but it's hard to even call most of their releases dubstep, strictly speaking. They've released off-centered hip-hop (Flying Lotus), brooding chill-out music that recasts the chill-out room as a bunker (Kode9 & the Spaceape), and misfit rave music (Zomby). Hyperdub's sound isn't dubstep, it's urban noir in the 21st century, or at least how the 21st century looked in 1970s science fiction: A procession of florescent signs over an empty street. 5: Five Years of Hyperdub-- their first CD compilation-- has the tall task of trying to anthologize the label without making it seem like they've run out of ideas. Their solution is sensible: One disc of new material; one disc of classics. Like any label compilation, 5 functions as a kind of mission statement: Here's what we've done; here's what we do. Most of the music on it sounds made for the head, not the feet. In a way, it's like a modern analog to Warp's 1992 compilation, Artificial Intelligence, whose sleeve was a picture of an empty armchair in a living room-- electronic music that has a place in the home. Describing his music to The Guardian in 2007, the producer Burial said, ""I want it to be like a little sanctuary. It's like that 24-hour stand selling tea on a rainy night, glowing in the dark."" His two albums, Burial and Untrue, have more in common with Massive Attack and ambient music than anything you'd hear at a club. Zomby, on the other hand-- whose Where Were U in 92? sounded like jungle and drum'n'bass chewed up by a Game Boy-- described his daily routine to XLR8R magazine as ""lots of rolling joints"" and ""eating some chicken-based dish à la carte."" These guys aren't public faces, they're lost in the crowd-- they're people spacing out in their living rooms, alone. Burial's identity was secret for two years after he started putting out records. Zomby will be photographed only while wearing a mask. Anyone familiar with Hyperdub-- or dubstep in general-- will know most of the classics disc. That's the point. One of the label's first singles-- Kode9 & the Spaceape's bloodless cover of the Specials' ""Ghost Town""-- doesn't even have a beat behind it; it floats. Burial shows up twice, once with ""South London Boroughs"", once with ""Distant Lights"". There's Zomby's nightmarish ""Spliff Dub (Rustie Remix)"", whose sampled vocalist sings, ""One spliff a day keep the evil away,"" over a track of 8-bit garbage and what sounds like synthesizers in a deep fryer. (The music captures weed's paranoia more than its elation-- I mean, is it supposed to make me like pot or fear it?) The word ""classics"" has a kind of accelerated, lax definition in dance music, and some of the tracks on the second disc are from as recent as earlier this year. The heaviest is Joker's ""Digidesign"", a spacious, bone-simple piece of 80s-style R&B based around a handful of acidic countermelodies, so elegant it almost plays like a jingle. The first disc-- the new one-- is good, but doesn't hold up to the classics. Those expected to bring it, as it were-- Burial, Zomby, Joker, Flying Lotus-- do, just not in any revelatory ways. Of the bunch, Zomby is probably the most satisfying because he's so hard to pin down: ""Tarantula"" doesn't sound exactly like anything he's released before, and his most recent single, ""Digital Flora""/""Digital Fauna"" doesn't sound like ""Tarantula"". I was never sold on Quarta 330's chiptune routine, nor on Kode9's music either-- their new contributions roll off. The only track that actively perplexes me is Black Chow's ""Purple Smoke"", whose junkshop hip-hop beats are the most brainlessly retro flourish on the whole compilation, and whose come-hither Japanese vocalist confuses sexy with corny. Minor complaints. Hyperdub deserves this: They've reshaped the little world they work in, and they've reached out to a wider one-- whether that world dances or not.","To celebrate five years in business, the Hyperdub label gathers tracks from Burial, Flying Lotus, and more into a convincing statement on the range of dubstep.

Summer of Fear,Miles Benjamin Anthony Robinson,by: Amy Granzin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6e1c0084474cd0c0a84/1:1/w_160/89fcdec0.jpg,2009-10-27 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13632-summer-of-fear/,Saddle Creek,"If I'm being generous, Miles Benjamin Anthony Robinson's second LP is a purple-prosed, passionate, and yet self-aware love letter to the musician's formative influences. Summer of Fear, a breakup album, streams like an hour-plus-long AOR-radio rock block, trafficking in strong, self-righteous, juvenile emotion, frustrated desire, and frequent, crashing instrumental climax. Robinson calls out specific heroes like Tom Petty (recasting ""the waiting is the hardest part"" as ""the whole thing is the hardest part""), Bruce Springsteen (appropriating the Boss' fist-pounding ""hey""! to launch riff-rafting, piano-slamming, sax-soloing ephiphanies), and Bob Dylan (adopting just about every nasal, marble-mouthed vocal trick). Love makes you do strange things. I'm trying to cut Robinson a break because I liked his 2008 self-titled debut, a bleak, disheveled, and frequently wonderful record produced by Grizzly Bear's Chris Taylor. That album came together in a couple of weeks in someone's Brooklyn living room, and despite its emotionally fraught preoccupations with addiction, homelessness, and other dead-end, drain-circling scenarios, it sounded lived-in and loose, thanks to the players' casual noise-folk jamming and Robinson's flair for leavening grim scenes with wry humor (best lines: ""Hey boy you're a death head/ I bet you'd be alright in bed/ Still I'll take sleep instead""). Fear, on the other hand, is a clusterfuck of bad pacing, pretentious lyrics histrionically sung, and overseasoned arrangements boiled to a gray mush. Robinson and producer Kyp Malone enjoyed 50 days in the studio (recording it before Robinson's first album was even released), and their shared affection for the classic rock canon, 1970s soul and funk, and complex sonics could have yielded something pretty great instead of the hot mess on hand. ""Hard Row"" makes as good (or bad) a case as any, starting spare and promising with a tight-snapping beat and pulsing guitar, only to slam into a brick wall of sneering synths, lyrics like, ""Honey, it's a hard row/ And it's one that you have to hoe"" (both the Black Keys and OutKast have deployed that awful aphorism to much sharper effect), and, finally, a pumping organ line with all the verve of a carnival carousel's. Then again, you don't know how unfocused this record is until you study ""Death by Dust""'s template, in which a modest Americana ramble segues into a noisy art-guitar solo, then yields to a full orchestra of brass, woodwinds, and the inevitable swooping, valedictory strings. If you happen to like its teeth-clenched, tears-streaming, utterly unearned ending, ""Always an Anchor"", ""The Sound"", ""The 100th of March"", and ""Summer of Fear, Pt. 2"" all repeat the trick. The album's not a complete wash. When Robinson hews to his fine melodies and checks his more baroque and myopic fan-boy impulses, he gets something like the enjoyable ""Trap Door"" or populist handclapper ""Losing 4 Winners"". But for the most part, the over-styled Fear repudiates Robinson's low-key and actually good debut, which he's now downplaying as a demo never intended for release. Word of advice: Save excuses like that for records that aren't so hot. This one, for example.","Following a bleak debut produced by Grizzly Bear's Chris Taylor, MBAR's follow-up streams like one long AOR-radio rock block.

Let It Die,The Shaky Hands,by: Stuart Berman,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6d9c0084474cd0c0a6e/1:1/w_160/2f886274.jpg,2009-10-27 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13627-let-it-die/,Kill Rock Stars,"The Shaky Hands are one of a million rock bands who cite the Beatles as an inspiration, but the influence runs deeper than just the swirly guitar solos, bouncy piano lines, and buoyant harmonies woven into their songs-- frontman Nicholas Delffs is probably one of the few Fab Four acolytes who can claim a soul-cleansing India retreat of his own. The effect of the trip was not so much musical-- rather than experiment with sitars, tablas, and eastern modalities, the Portland band's third album, Let It Die, is actually their most straightforward set to date. But amid Let It Die's ragged bar-band workouts, you hear a singer who's had time to peacefully ponder his place in the world, and question the predominant Western values of rat-race competitiveness and material acquisition. Let It Die isn't dramatic enough to count as a midlife-crisis record, but the album is consumed with midlife stasis: references abound to aging, setting suns, and flames dying out. And yet, that the Shaky Hands opt to wrap these anxieties in unfussy, steady-as-she-goes rockers that suggest a certain shrugged-shoulder resignation, forsaking the jittery energy and textural nuance of 2008's Lunglight for more surface-level classic rock comforts. But while the laissez-faire quality of Delffs' raspy voice makes him an eminently likable mouthpiece, the Shaky Hands aren't an especially incendiary rock'n'roll band: Delff's title-track rant is backed by a standard-issue Rolling Stones strut that doesn't waver for four verse-chorus cycles; the cruise-controlled workout ""Caught in the Storm"" splits the difference between Haight-Ashbury 1967 and the Bowery 1977, but stops cold just as it seems to be accruing some force. Only on the piano-pounded stomper ""Slip Away"" does the band exude an intensity that matches the frustration heard in Delffs' lyrics. After kicking out the jams (however casually) on the album's first half, the Shaky Hands simmer down even more on Let It Die's second side, downshifting into cowpoke laments like ""Don't Fail Me Now"" and, with ""Gonna Hold You Tonight"", a rather blatant attempt at a couples-cuddling, lighter-waving acoustic ballad. But the band's playful spirit is still evident in the winsome, piano-rolled lullaby ""Already Gone"", while the album's theme of dead-end ennui is best manifested on the bittersweet ""Allison and the Ancient Eyes"", whose deceptively cheery jangle-pop dressing only makes the unfulfillment described within seem all the more tragic. So, in search of spiritual salvation, Delff looks once again to the Beatles-- namely, John Lennon and George Harrison-- as he transforms the imagine-no-possessions rhetoric of closing piano ballad ""Leave It All"" into a full-on Hare Krishna hymn. Let It Die may speak of the sour times, but, in the end, at least Delffs has found his sweet lord.","Portland band continues its Beatlesesque pop, here wrapping studies of mid-life anxieties in unfussy, steady-as-she-goes rockers.

Wayfaring Strangers: Lonesome Heroes,Various Artists,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a674ea9e61561daa5389/1:1/w_160/52bf9de5.jpg,2009-10-27 06:00:02,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13540-wayfaring-strangers-lonesome-heroes/,Numero Group,"Wanderlust has always been a distinctly masculine trait in America, as the trekking pioneers became cowboys itching to move along the trail, then Depression hobos riding the rails, then troubadours playing one town after another. It's a romanticized view perhaps, more applicable to literature and cinema than to actual history, but that doesn't mean the need to travel-- or its cousin, the fear of standing still-- doesn't affect each generation with the force of historical truth. In the 1960s, this wanderlust coincided with a back-to-nature movement and an aggressive military draft, spurring young men to take their worldly possessions on the road to seek adventure and experience. Most of the acts on the Numero Group's new compilation Wayfaring Strangers: Lonesome Heroes were itinerant in some way: They were nature photographers, hitchhikers, or touring musicians, and almost all of them were hounded by their local draft boards. Some reluctantly enlisted (Tim Ward); others fought their orders and won (Rob Carr); some lost brothers or friends in battle (Jack Hardy); and at least one fled to Europe (Tucker Zimmerman). Their nomadism puts them in sharp contrast to their female counterparts on 2007's Wayfaring Strangers: Ladies From the Canyon. The females are identified more or less with Laurel Canyon, or at least with a brand of folk music closely associated with that place, but as Rob Sevier writes in the Lonesome Heroes liner notes, ""The more positive experience common to these men was time spent on the open road: by car, train, or thumb, the urge to keep moving was pronounced."" That urge translated into songs emphasizing guitar and voice, with fuller accompaniment only a secondary concern. The implication is that the musicians are making rough sketches on their travels, then fleshing them out during a studio respite. That's certainly the case with Jim Ransom's ""It's So Profound"", which was composed at the top of Independence Pass in Colorado. On the luminous ""As I Walk"", Kalamazoo-based strummer Richard Smyrnios is joined by his sister, who adds ghostly backing vocals, and by a fife player; the simple combination of elements gives the song an out-of-time quality. Jack Hardy managed to corral slightly higher-profile guests on ""The Tailor"", which is punctuation by harmonies from Suzzy and Terre Roche. Les Moore's strange ""Ooh Pah Do Pah Do"" is perhaps the most studio-bound composition here, although his imagery sounds somewhat out of place: ""See those who blow a big nose, see them foul up the air,"" Moore sings very gravely, ""while some in slums suffocate with Kleenex everywhere."" There's possibly a pointed metaphor buried underneath all that tissue, but on the whole, these songs aren't overtly political, despite the politicized times. They approach these issues either very generally or from a particularly obtuse angle: ""Before"", by then-Buffalo Sabre Jim Schoenfeld, casts a wide net, addressing pollution, violence, war, and unhappiness in their broadest definitions, but rather than an athlete-turned-folkie novelty, the song is redeemed by Schoenfeld's sensitive guitar work and the odd background vocals that hum out a tectonic bass pattern. Similarly, Tucker Zimmerman's ""No Love Lost"" is a downcast send-off to either a friend or perhaps a politician, but underneath all its slang (""I'm not getting heavy because no one here feels you""), it's a deeply sad song and tender, almost whispered performance. It's difficult to determine if that shared glancing approach is truly reflective of their output or just a byproduct of the compilers' song choices. In fact, there's little connecting these men beyond their acoustic guitars, and that ambiguity gently undercuts this collection as a historical document. Of course, the Numero Group is less concerned with documenting particular scenes than with gathering the detritus of certain movements-- the artists who made great music but never gained notoriety-- and in some ways, the loose organization of Lonesome Heroes reinforces the artists' nomadic isolation. Ultimately and ironically, they make good company for each other.","Numero Group's choice Wayfaring Strangers series continues with an LP of wanderlust often inspired by the draft. Ex-NHLer Jim Schoenfeld appears.

Investigate Witch Cults of the Radio Age,Broadcast and the Focus Group,by: Mike Powell,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a68bea9e61561daa53bd/1:1/w_160/1da0a100.gif,2009-10-27 06:00:01,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13560-investigate-witch-cults-of-the-radio-age/,Warp,"Broadcast and the Focus Group form a likely pair: Both groups make warped psychedelic music rooted in jazz, Euro-pop, and 1960s BBC interludes instead of rock or blues; both conjure a bookshelf's worth of cultural blasts from the nocturnal side of the world-- Satanic texts, Czech horror films, pulpy science fiction lit; both are-- as if there were any doubt after hearing their records-- acutely British. Julian House-- the man behind the Focus Group and the co-founder of Ghost Box records-- has designed Broadcast's album sleeves for years (in addition to work for Primal Scream, Stereolab, and others). The specificity of their aesthetic projects-- and yes, these are bands with ""aesthetic projects""-- is so pronounced that calling them kindred spirits implies too much accident: they're more like co-conspirators. So Witch Cults of the Radio Age is predictable-- actually, it's surprising that they didn't decide to record something like it earlier. But for all their similarities, Broadcast and the Focus Group approach their peaks in very different ways. Broadcast's music is sensual and chic; it has poise, groove, and sex; it's black eyeliner. Nitsuh Abebe, writing on this site about the band's outtakes collection The Future Crayon, pointed out that they'd become almost expert in mapping weird onto what were ostensibly pop songs. I'd agree, but almost to their discredit. Broadcast wear their idiosyncrasies like bangles-- even when I like their music, it feels like it could change shape at any time. By contrast, the Focus Group's native tongue is the stutter; the music's imbalance is in its DNA. Rarely does it ever coalesce into something intelligible, and when it does, there's usually something smeared overtop to throw it off-course. Though the album is a collaboration, it's obvious which side anchors which tracks: ""The Be Colony"", sung by Broadcast's Trish Keenan, plays like a nursery rhyme trapped in amber; ""Mr. Beard, You Chatterbox"" is 80 seconds of disjointed harpsichord and flute that flares out into static and echo. Broadcast's contributions are intoxicating and lovely; the Focus Group's sound like a three-legged kitten knocking over teacups. It's refreshing to hear two seemingly similar bands highlight each others' differences, but it's also why their collaboration isn't as impacting as the albums the bands make alone. Witch Cults is like the sound of Broadcast and the Focus Group trying to cast their spells at the same time: Some of the record is great, plenty of it is cross-chatter. ""For me, the paranormal is most powerful when it's unassuming,"" Trish from Broadcast recently told The Wire-- ""not obviously spooky or dark."" She went on to talk about how when she and Broadcast bassist James Cargill moved houses, familiar names and places took on new forms-- for example, their new downstairs neighbor looked exactly like their former roommate's girlfriend. ""Even my mom was replaced by an old toothless poodle."" It's a benign sense of horror and disorientation-- compare it, for example, to Animal Collective's professed interest in slasher movies and all the gross, visceral sounds they integrate into their songs (squish, guts, screams). Europe breeds romantic monsters like Dracula; America breeds disturbed children who grow up to disembody teenagers with mass-market appliances, like Leatherface or Michael Myers. Broadcast and the Focus Group -- together and apart-- offer something a little more prim than the image of someone getting a wooden spike through their eye, but I think the intent is roughly the same: To create a space where, for a second, there's no sense to be made.","The exceptional avant-pop group combines with the Ghost Box records founder for a mini-LP that highlights their differences as much as their shared vision.

Head [Deluxe Edition] / Goat [Deluxe Edition] / Liar [Deluxe Edition] / Down [Deluxe Edition],The Jesus Lizard,by: Jason Crock,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6e55e6ef95969320e4e/1:1/w_160/267e1315.jpg,2009-10-27 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13636-head-goat-liar-down/,Touch and Go,"While not unwelcome, this batch of Jesus Lizard reissues come as a surprise. After all, these albums were still available and in print. In terms of needing remastering, the CD wasn't exactly a young or uncharted medium at the time, and the guy recording them, Steve Albini, is generally regarded to know what he's doing behind the boards. I'm starting to think that the reissue craze is less about keeping music on the shelves (which is arguably not an issue these days) and more about reminding overwhelmed listeners that records even exist. If someone were to tell me something sounded wrong with the old versions, I would have recommended that the listener locate their volume knob and turn it clockwise. But then again...the new digipacs and their fold-out inserts for these records look great, and the remastering job was done by Bob Weston (Shellac) and Albini himself. The bonus tracks included are sparse, but are carefully chosen from singles, soundtracks, and live performances. They're separated by a track of silence from the rest of the record, but their additions make sense in the context of each album. Without analyzing each song's waveform, the drums seem a little louder now (rarely if ever a bad thing), and certain moments may pop out a little more, like the atonal feedback in ""Seasick"" that sounds like it may swallow your whole head when heard through headphones. If these reissues needed to be done, then they did them right, and if people really need reminding, so be it: At their best, the Jesus Lizard created some of the best rock records of the 1990s. Head lacks some the high points of later records, save for the essential ""Killer McHann"", but it shows the pieces in place from the beginning-- especially the fearsome rhythm section that asserts itself from the opening moments of ""One Evening"" and throughout. ""If You Had Lips"" also marks the beginning of the satanic rodeo rhythm that would suit them so well throughout their career, often shaking up the second sides of their later albums (see Goat's ""South Mouth"" or Liar’s ""Rope""). The CD reissue includes the Pure EP (as the 1992 CD did), as well as the ""Chrome"" single and live versions of ""Bloody Mary"" and ""Killer McHann"". Guitarist Duane Denison himself calls the album transitional in the new liner notes, and while he's being a little modest, Head can't help but sound a bit thin compared to what would come afterward. Enter Goat, at a lean and ferocious nine tracks. Singer David Yow is his usually expressive self here: His vocals are tense, funny, and occasionally terrifying, from bullhorn-ready hollering to howls of anguish if the song calls for it. Sometimes he's just making muffled slurping noises, often multi-tracked and through both ears, like some supernatural character in a David Lynch film. Yet it's funny to think that despite how depraved the lyrics may have been (see ""Lady Shoes"" from this album, among many, many others), Yow's most enduring epithet may be calling someone a ""mouth breather."" It might have something to do with the track itself, with its elastic, repetitive riff snapping back and forth under Yow's wails and backhanded insults. The appended live version of ""Seasick"" from 1992 has crowd members audibly calling out for the song moments before it's played, showing how their reputation had been solidified-- and while one song here is called ""Seasick"", the whole record is unpredictable and queasy. Yow and Denison steal the show here somewhat, but the vicious bob of the rhythm section on ""Monkey Trick"" goes way beyond a memorable moment; it's a reason to get up in the morning. Goat and Liar show the band at the obvious peak of their powers. It's splitting hairs to call one record that much better than the other, though Liar's second half is a little slower and moodier than the tour-de-force of the first side. (In fairness, what record wouldn't start to go downhill after something like ""Puss""?) The start of ""Boilermaker"" is like coming out of a blackout to find yourself in the middle of a bar fight. It's weird to hear a moment of nothing but the rhythm section for even a few seconds on the track's bridge-- for most of side one, the band are become one singular, heaving thing; the band is completely in step with one another as Yow is free to bellow, wail and hiss over it all. You can't overestimate Duane Denison's contribution to these records. Few guitarists in rock this side of Thurston Moore or Gang of Four's Andy Gill did as much to tear down and reimagine the form. His sound on these records is jagged, minimal, and instantly recognizable. It's hard to pick just one example, but listen to ""Puss"" from Liar, as he uses a wah pedal to make the guitar sound like a hive of angry wasps, and then finds a glassy, piano-like tone in the bridge to let out arpeggios over a rhythm ready for a strip club. Even outside of his tone and feel, the balance he struck between blues-inspired riffs, punk catharsis, and general dissonance is nearly without peer. Down is a little less celebrated than the earlier records-- I don't know how many fans were looking to the Jesus Lizard for subtlety and nuance, but Down shows they were ready for it as musicians. Not to say it isn't heavy, from the swaggering descending riff of ""Fly on the Wall"" to oddly melodic bruisers like ""Destroy Before Reading"" and ""American BB"". But if the jazzy leanings of tracks like ""The Associate"" don't throw you, then Yow's earnest croon on ""Elegy"" indicates they were ready to mature-- and honestly, as they lost very little of their tempo or edge, they were doing it in all the right ways here. When people continue to mention Chicago in the early 90s or Touch and Go Records as a brand, they often start with these records. It's worth noting band members hail from Texas-- once home to Roky Erickson, Willie Nelson, and Butthole Surfers-- and Austin is a great place to nurture an individualist streak. Moreover, by the time the Jesus Lizard would release Down, their fourth album, Touch and Go and its subsidiaries were already becoming too diverse a label to be summed up by a handle like ""pigfuck"" or any other name lobbed by journalists at bands like the Jesus Lizard, Shellac, Killdozer, or the many others from that decade. And yet, whenever I try to think of one representative sound for that small pocket of gnashing geniuses, it's the sound of drummer Mac McNeilly and bassist David Sims locking in on the band's heavy, inimitable groove that they perfected over these four records. For all the breathless praise, the Jesus Lizard weren't necessarily the loudest or the most twisted band out there, or had the singer that exposed himself the most often. (Well, maybe the last one is true.) And that's not why we still talk about these records. Their aggression was taut, minimal, and artful. Even amidst the controlled chaos of ""Boilermaker"", they hold back for a delicious blink-and-you'll-miss-it full-band rest in the song's final moments, one of countless examples where they asserted themselves as musicians-- not a sideshow-- in all these tracks. The band thrived in the underground of the 90s, and from the freedom of Touch and Go in particular; under pressure from no one but themselves, the Jesus Lizard raised a bar that few bands have reached since (and, for whatever reason, one they struggled to reach themselves after migrating to Capitol Records after Down). They were raucous and heavy without the rigidity of later hardcore or the meat-headedness of metal; they played art-rock that actually rocked. There's no shortage of good stories about David Yow's stage behavior, which you can swap with those who were really there or just read them from the new liner notes. But there are so many more reasons to pick up these records-- including Yow's talent as a singer and lyricist. Rarely does a band have each member adding something essential to such a united, ferocious whole. (Zeppelin gets mentioned more than once in the new liners; it's not much of a stretch.) It's why after a decade, they're welcome back.","The first four full-lengths from the hugely influential noise-rock band have been remastered by Steve Albini and Bob Weston and reissued.

Transition,Lokai,by: Philip Sherburne,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a67bb1335d7bf1698e34/1:1/w_160/83a139c5.jpg,2009-10-26 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13552-transition/,Thrill Jockey,"Lokai-- the Viennese duo of Florian Kmet and Radian's Stefan Németh-- can't be accused of making pop music. Németh, a member of the group Radian and co-founder of the Mosz label, has a background in electro-acoustic improv, low-intensity noise, and what might be described as full-bodied microsound. Kmet, a guitarist and member of the group Superlooper, has a similar pedigree. Their debut album, 2005's 7 Million, was a rough blend of guitar feedback, bell tones, and buzzing drones-- the music sounded exposed and at the mercy of the elements. But a strange things happen just two minutes into ""Roads"", the opening track on their new album for Thrill Jockey. Out of a delicate scrabble of indeterminate clicks and clacks-- the sound of a bassy piano string being pulled from its frame? An underwater recording from a sailboat dock?-- grows the unmistakable shape of a song. The clanking finds a rhythm, and against a background of massing strings, a melody arises out of the pitter-patter of glockenspiel and mbira. Or, in any case, sounds that evoke those worldly instruments: With Lokai, you can never be sure exactly what's being played, sampled, or processed. But there's no doubting the songliness of the thing. It's more than mere suggestion, as contrapuntal tones stack up and ambient rustle settles into an unmistakable groove, a 104-BPM pulse that wouldn't be out of place on one of Lawrence or Efdemin's more muted 12"" singles. And then, before you know it, it's gone. A similar tension animates all nine tracks here, where musical structure is always on the cusp of dissolving into pure sound, or possibly vice versa. Usually we assume that tones are the building blocks of what we perceive as music, but Lokai reverse that hierarchy. Their ephemeral constructions play with the assumption that we're hard-wired to recognize patterns in chaos, redirecting our attention to the chaos inherent in patterns. But if that's a heavy-handed explanation of their process, fortunately, the music is anything but. The supple timbres of brushed percussion, bells, Rhodes, melodica, and guitar are warm, immersive, and somehow deeply reassuring. The songs lull the listener into such a receptive state that they may seem much longer than they really are. In reality, only four tracks stretch beyond the five-minute mark, and barely, at that; the rest run between two and four minutes. They're sketches that open up into panoramic landscapes, evoking the vistas of a Caspar David Friedrich with the brushtrokes of a Klee. Unlike some of their peers, Lokai are content here to leave their acoustic sources relatively unvarnished and unadulterated, unmarked by, say, the foaming granular processes of Fennesz or Tim Hecker. (A closer comparison might be to Sweden's Tape or Germany's September Collective.) The duo recorded the album in Kmet's home studio over the course of four years, and that freedom-- the musicians have described it as ""a joyful process""-- is felt in the music's unhurried pace and limpid clarity. ""Volver,"" which feels in many ways like the album's gravitational center, rolls out pensive guitar chords over sinewave drones whose gentle dissonances create slowly undulating pulses. ""Bruit"", which begins with muted, rolling toms, slowly masses into a geyser of splash cymbals and guitar feedback before subsiding into measured hand-drumming, regular as clockwork. ""Tik"", honeycombed with tightly-looped string drones, is the album's most luminous track, its intensity a perfect setup for the final wind-down of ""Roads (Reprise)"", which returns to the themes introduced in the album's opening track. You're unlikely to pick the moments apart like this, however. At only 38 minutes long, the album invites repeat listening and extended wandering through the labyrinthine passages hidden within its folds.","Viennese duo of Florian Kmet and Radian's Stefan Németh come together for an accessible and appealing album of electro-acoustic instrumentals.
