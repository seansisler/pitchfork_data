Everything's Fine,Willard Grant Conspiracy,by: John Dark,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929aa39c0084474cd0c1174/1:1/w_160/0531269f.gif,2001-03-31 06:00:07,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8685-everythings-fine/,Ryko,"Aside from death and taxes, there's one other thing I've learned is certain: if there's pain in your life, you're not alone. The juvenile, angst-ridden poet believes he's alone, much to the amusement of those who know better. More world-wise souls like Robert Fisher and Paul Austin realize that the catharsis is found in expression, communication and that neatly tied package that weds the two of these together: storytelling. They know pain, but their pain is mature. And as a result, their expression of it resonates more universally. Willard Grant Conspiracy has always made music with one hand on the razor blade. A collective-- more in the New England, Walden Pond transcendentalist tradition than any sort of sun-baked, hippie Californian way-- WGC has, over the years, been a halfway house for like-minded and not-so-like-minded stray musicians. This time out, Fisher and Austin are augmented by luminaries James Apt (Six Finger Satellite), Chris Brokaw (Come, Codeine, The New Year), Terri Moeller and Carla Torgerson (Walkabouts) and Edith Frost (Edith Frost), among others. On Everything's Fine, Fisher and Austin once again put their demons on display, soundtracked by populist instrumentation. A menagerie of lap steel, dobro, banjo, and mandolin might suggest alt-country, but the delivery is more mainstream and surface appealing, even despite the tendency to brood. You could call it ""alt-folk"" if that didn't a) smack of unnecessary genre-pigeonholing, and b) sound just plain silly. Sunnier than the tormented, abyss-peering Mojave, Everything's Fine is also more piano-centric. The slight, simple ""Hesitation"" stands out early, reminiscent of R.E.M.'s ""New Orleans Instrumental No. 1"" with its gently shimmering, plain keyboard countermelody. The true-to-form ""Ballad of John Parker"" follows immediately, and shifts around point-of-view while creeping out the listener with lines like ""Early one morning in the warehouse of souls/ Digger was bent to carry the load/ Digger, oh, digger what's left to reveal/ Known by the way that he carries the load."" The song is exceptional but not representative. Instead, more often than not, the lyrics draw attention as the weak link. The narrative voice Fisher has culled over the course of three studio albums is undermined here by goofy, unnatural-sounding turns of phrase (""o'er,"" ""brace of crows,"" etc). What's more, the hard-luck attitude permeating these gentle, plodding death ballads isn't convincing. It rings false, even though those familiar with the band's previous work know it to be true. The album ends on a narcotic note, first with the languid, hesitating strums and lap steel if ""Closing Time,"" followed by the piano bar introspection of ""Massachusetts."" And so, eleven tracks pass by with hardly an urge to hit the reverse-track skip and hear one again. A pleasant listen, yes, but ultimately disposable. Even though the title is understood to be intentionally ironic, the nose-wrinkling number of watered-down tracks on Everything's Fine suggest that things might actually be headed for fine, if not dandy. Which is bad news for Fisher and Austin's muse.","Aside from death and taxes, there's one other thing I've learned is certain: if there's pain in ...

Funny Cry Happy Gift,Tiffany Anders,by: Camilo Arturo Leslie,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a096ea9e61561daa45cd/1:1/w_160/abbb2f63.gif,2001-03-31 06:00:06,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/183-funny-cry-happy-gift/,Up,"""I think we're alone now/ There doesn't seem to be anyone a-rah-ound/ I think we're alone now/ The beating of our hearts is the only sah-ound."" --Tiffany (covering some 60s singer I can't be bothered to look up) If you like your Tiffanies less saccharine than that, but only slightly, then Anders is the Tiffany for you. Not to say that it's all sweet going here. Funny Cry Happy Gift takes the cloying edge off Anders' sugary, sometimes grating pipes by adding a heap of desert sand and set props from spaghetti Westerns. This should come as no surprise. Anders is the talented progeny of filmmaker Allison Anders, best known for Gas Food Lodging, the early-90s film about slow-mo life in a miserable New Mexico highway town. In addition to Ione Sky and Fairuza Balk, the film featured a cameo by Dinosaur Jr's J Mascis. And wouldn't you know; Funny Cry Happy Gift also features flashes of J Mascis, this time mostly in a percussive capacity. Lest you infer some sort of Dubya-esque favor-currying on the part of Anders Sr. for her daughter, it should be mentioned that Tiffany befriended Mascis on her own, unaided, at the age of 14. Legend has it, she wrote a fan letter to the then-svelte guitar hero, to which Mascis graciously responded. As if by magic, a friendship and creative relationship was born. But we're not done name-dropping yet! Anders, a native of Los Angeles' Echo Park neighborhood, spent several years in Seattle, exploring its music scene before tiring of the social homogeny. New York was her next and most fruitful stop. While playing out at clubs, Anders caught the attention of PJ Harvey. When Anders' asked Harvey to produce her debut full-length, Harvey agreed, much to Anders' delight. With all that fame and talent hanging around, you'd expect some spectacular results. The truth about the product is considerably less lustrous than that. Fortunately, the loss in shine is made up for in grit. ""Person I Knew,"" the lead-off track and the album's finest moment, showcases all that's good and moving in Anders' musical world: lush, interesting chords, multi-tracked vocals, smart instrumentation, and a gripping melody. Her voice can become tiresome, due to its sharp, brittle quality, but she's usually able to mitigate her shortcomings by layering the vocal tracks and thickening things up with gorgeous harmonies. The feel of Funny Cry Happy Gift is distinctly Western, or as my friend Ivan might say, ""dusty."" The thick, choking melancholia that pervades Anders' music is definitely mesquite-flavored, scarred by lasso-burns and spur marks, and branded in the ass with a big C for ""corny."" But there are worse things, as Anders too convincingly proves. After all, for a Los Angeles-to-NYC transplant to put out 40+ minutes of dark cowboy ballads (replete with distorted slide-guitar accompaniment) is a foolhardy proposition in theory. The actuality works surprisingly well. ""Here I Forget"" is the best paced of the ten tracks. While several songs lose some of their momentum and lack discernable arcs, this one builds to a palpably tense finish. ""I See How Much Has Changed"" is the most maudlin and silly of the bunch, and still, that's not enough to sink it. Imagine if they made another installation in the Young Guns series, bringing the heavily brat-packed, b-list original cast back for another try, only this time in present day New York City. This would be the perfect background music for a shot of Kiefer Sutherland's Doc character and Lou Diamond Phillip's Chavez walking down the Bowery in chaps and tasseled leather vests looking for a bordello. Did I mention that PJ sings background vocals on this one? And that J Mascis has a bit part as well? Star-studded! ""Summer Gold"" is representative of Anders' weaker material. The song sounds rather rote and leans too heavily in the direction of Alannah Myles' ""Black Velvet."" Bad. Harvey's harmonies on this track prove, pretty definitively, that no amount of star-shine can polish a turd. ""Concrete Like Quicksand"" is an interesting mix of ""works"" and ""flops."" Tiffany's voice is at its most grating here, but the melody, interestingly enough, is one of her best, and the chords are appropriately bittersweet and unresolved. High profile friends (I imagine) are mixed blessings, especially for someone in Anders' position. While it must have been a treat to have the help-- both technical and personal-- of an esteemed somebody like PJ Harvey, and the musical input of an icon like J Mascis, the weight of those names could do her more harm than good. This album is bursting with potential, so it's a shame that it might be unfairly dismissed for its imperfections, owing to the unrealistic standards those high-gloss names sort of imply. Anders' songwriting is no fluke, and as she finds her own stylistic voice, she could become a real force.","""I think we're alone now/ There doesn't seem to be anyone a-rah-ound/ I think we're alone now ...

Group Sounds,Rocket from the Crypt,by: Nick Mirov,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a292c0084474cd0c008c/1:1/w_160/c0440dca.gif,2001-03-31 06:00:05,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6812-group-sounds/,Vagrant,"Someone had better save John Reis a spot on the canonical list of Hardest Working Men in Rock 'n' Roll. This is a guy who, at one point, was in two incredible bands at once (this one and Drive Like Jehu), and somehow convinced Interscope to sign them both; a guy who's maintained whole warehouses of credibility during his stay on a major by churning out seven-inches and compilation tracks for a plethora of tiny labels; a guy who pledged that anyone with a tattoo of the Rocket from the Crypt logo would get into their shows free forever, and a guy whose fanbase is so incredibly loyal that they actually went ahead and got tattoos of said logo. Now that's rock 'n' roll. It was a mighty pleasure to hear Reis reunited with fellow Drive Like Jehu alumnus Rick Froberg on last year's Hot Snakes record, and now he's back with his main gig's first full-length since 1998. Blame the wait on the search for a new label after being predictably dropped by Interscope, because from the first blast of Group Sounds' ""Straight American Slave"", it's like Rocket from the Crypt were never gone at all. Huge, beefy guitar riffs punctuated by the crisp lines of the horn section (I hesitate to call one trumpet and one sax a ""section,"" but hey, that's more than most non-ska bands have) form the basis of Rocket's 50s-garage-rock-of-the-future sound, with Reis leading the way with his indomitable Elvis-gone-punk shtick. It's the way RFTC have always done it, so why fix something that's so obviously not broken? Group Sounds could be considered a ""back to basics"" record, eschewing much of the slicker production work of their last Interscope release, RFTC, most likely because their new label couldn't splurge on six-figure recording budgets. While I'm always happy to see major-label castoffs find homes on indies, I also think Rocket is one of those rare bands that truly benefited from having tons of money to funnel into their sessions; RFTC remains my favorite release of theirs because they were able to further develop the more classic-sounding facets of their sound. Group Sounds is nonstop, straight-ahead rock for the most part, more reminiscent of Scream, Dracula, Scream!, but with enough flourishes to keep things from sounding too monochromatic. ""Carne Voodoo"" sports a nasty 7/4-time riff that wouldn't have sounded too out of place on a Drive Like Jehu record, but then the horns jump in with a perfect rhythmic counterpoint and it becomes a bona fide Rocket song. That's probably the most important development on Group Sounds: The horn section continues to come more and more into its own. In the early years, they seemed a rather superfluous addition to the band's sound, but on this album, trumpeter JC2000 and saxophonist Apollo 9 are as vital as the guitarists or drummer-- maybe even more so. When they're not playing, they're providing the backing vocals, handclaps, and assorted rhythmic instruments that elevate otherwise regular rock songs to the level of Rocket songs. And for the first time ever, they actually get to take honest-to-god solos on ""Venom Venom"" and ""Savoir Faire"". Rocket from the Crypt motor through the first two-thirds of Group Sounds like they've got something to prove. (Which they don't, but they proved it anyway for good measure.) And just as their need for speed is starting to wear a bit, they thankfully kick it down a notch for the moody yet propulsive ""S.O.S."", ""Dead Seed"", a slower anthem right out of the Circa: Now! years, and ""Ghost Shark"", which appears to be a dramatic piano-laden ballad for a Scooby-Doo villain. (I jest.) Right through to the end, every song on Group Sounds is solid, pure, high-octane Rocket fuel. The hardest-working man in rock? I stand corrected: Try the hardest-working band in rock.","Someone had better save John Reis a spot on the canonical list of Hardest Working Men in Rock 'n' Roll ...

Isolation Drills,Guided by Voices,by: Matt LeMay,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bfc113d197565213b92a/1:1/w_160/4f7b9929.gif,2001-03-31 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3593-isolation-drills/,TVT,"Tonight, the people of Dayton, Ohio will sleep a sound sleep. Children, tucked tight in their beds, will dream dreams of twirling microphones, of feet flying far above gray-haired heads, of striped white pants and barely coherent Who covers. For the day has come that many feared they would never see: their dubious hero, Robert Pollard, the Silver Captain, has released a decent post-Mag Earwhig! Guided by Voices record. Perhaps that isn't entirely accurate. Robert Pollard has always pointed out that, for the most part, people in Dayton couldn't give two shits about him or his band. Furthermore, it doesn't seem all that likely that the children of Dayton will be comforted in sleep by visions of indie rock instead of Celebi, the mystery Pokémon. I can, however, think of one demographic that will undoubtedly be affected by the release of Isolation Drills. Tonight, formerly disillusioned Guided by Voices fans will sleep a sound sleep. Indie kids, shuffling into record stores, will dream dreams of catchy melodies, of tasteful production, of quirky song structures and sloppy, beer-soaked rawk. For the day has come that many feared they would never see: their dubious hero, Robert Pollard, the Silver Captain, has released a decent post-Mag Earwhig Guided by Voices record. Which is not to say that the archetypal Guided by Voices fan is getting what he or she wanted. Isolation Drills is not a return to the crusty four-tracks of days of yore. It is not a Beatlesque pop album bursting at the seams with indelible hooks. It does not feature hastily fingered, partially tonal, and obviously inebriated guitar solos. It is, however, a solid, riff-driven rock record that may disappoint those still awaiting Bee Thousand II, but which offers plenty of treats for those who are willing to approach it with open ears. Like its predecessor, the vastly disappointing Do the Collapse, Isolation Drills is a fully produced record, with Beck, Foo Fighters and Elliott Smith producer (and Reverbaholics Anonymous member) Rob Schnapf twiddling the knobs. But whereas Ocasek's production covered up inherently weak songs with layer after layer of extraneous studio garbage, Schnapf's production never interferes. Guitars crunch, drums crash, bass rumbles, and Robert Pollard's vocals resonate with that oh-so-adorable faux-British accent. There are occasional touches of backwards guitar, strings, and a few seconds of Elliott Smith tapping away on his organ, but these additional flourishes always remain sonically distinct, preventing Isolation Drills from succumbing to the kind of sloppy sonic stew that marred Do the Collapse. While the production has certainly changed since past efforts, it's the character of the songs themselves that mark the biggest difference between this album and the band's back catalog. Pollard flirted with arena rock swagger on Mag Earwhig!'s ""Bulldog Skin"", and here, he takes the big rock aesthetic to its logical next step, constructing tracks centered around big riffs rather than poppy vocal hooks. Which is not to say that Isolation Drills is bereft of compelling vocal melodies. Whereas many of the tracks on Do the Collapse (""Zoo Pie"", ""In Stitches"") had practically no vocal melody to speak of, this album couples its increased instrumental presence with some of the better melodies Pollard has penned in recent years-- most notably the poppy sing-alongs of ""Glad Girls"", and the album's first single, ""Chasing Heather Crazy"". If Pollard's vocals are much improved on Isolation Drills, the tight instrumental interplay amongst Pollard's backing band really makes the album shine. Ex-Breeders drummer Jim MacPherson, whose playing seemed utterly lost in Ocasek's mix, comes through on the new record as a truly frenetic skin-beater. And guitarist Doug Gillard, whose technical prowess transformed the very essence of Guided by Voices circa Mag Earwhig!, is joined by his Gem bandmate Tim Tobias on bass, resulting in some excellent guitar and bass interplay. Yet, though Isolation Drills does attain a degree of big rock attitude that its predecessors never quite approached, it's far from a perfect album-- in fact, it's perhaps the most homogenous Guided by Voices release to date. Sure, there are subtle differences between the sneering, pouting rock of ""Want One?"" and the subtle balladry of ""Fine to See You"", but gone are the days when a single Guided by Voices record covered everything from sparse bubblegum pop to fuzzed-out rock to wacky four-track experiments. And while Isolation Drills is, without doubt, a much, much more consistent offering than Do the Collapse, none of its 16 tracks are effortlessly catchy enough to lay claim to ""GBV classic"" status. Still, Isolation Drills is the most mature, darkly sophisticated record Guided by Voices have laid to tape (or, in this case, DAT), and Pollard's untainted love for rock 'n' roll makes it a fully serviceable record. And if nothing else, Robert Pollard has finally answered the question of what he'll do when he runs out of pop songs: he'll write rock songs instead.","Tonight, the people of Dayton, Ohio will sleep a sound sleep.

Lemonjelly.ky,Lemon Jelly,by: Paul Cooper,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bcceeb335119a49ecd4e/1:1/w_160/33d5a17c.gif,2001-03-31 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4727-lemonjellyky/,XLBeggars,"The Pitchfork staffer originally assigned to write a review of Lemon Jelly's EP collection determined that he was too cool for the job. And I have to agree. The guy gets sent demo recordings from Icelandic bands seeking his guidance/approval on material for their forthcoming albums. Rumor has it that Stephen Frears consulted him about what vinyl should be prominently displayed during High Fidelity. He's too cool to even wear vintage RayBan Aviator shades! Suffice to say, he's too good for this. So Lemonjelly.ky was passed to me-- apparently because my cool-to-nerd ratio needs major improving. Though I haven't yet got what it takes to carry off designer stay-press suits, I feel comfortable in my facsimile RayBan Aviators. But even I'm too cool for the lurid banality of this record. This compilation of three EPs' worth of downtempo ditties aims for the same market that scarfed up The Beta Band's Three EPs disc, but the similarities swiftly end there. The packaging is lush, deluxe and probably shortlisted for a graphic design award, yet Lemonjelly.ky's nine tracks consist largely of samples from atrocious Nana Mouskouri songs and soundclips nipped from 100 Strings' mood music albums. What binds these samples together is a series of predicable hip-hop beats and root-note basslines. In the UK, Lemon Jelly are probably pin-ups for a certain type of elitist freshman who considers himself ever-so superior for conspicuously enjoying this stuff. By arranging Lemonjelly.ky in chronological order, we can at least appreciate that by July 2000's The Midnight EP, it had at last occurred to the duo of Fred Deakin and Nick Franglin that splicing Bert Kaempfert with drum machine presets wasn't going to get them the St. Tropez mansion they'd been promising themselves since The Bath EP was released in August 1998. I get all mangled up inside about Lemonjelly.ky as a whole, but it's The Bath EP that gets me frayed. ""Nervous Tension"" samples a relaxation tape monologue which, unironically, has the opposite effect on my well-being. The only person who might be truly thrilled with ""A Tune for Jack"" is Jack himself-- the rest of us can live without hearing Johnny Pearson's Sounds Orchestral version of ""Wichita Lineman"" mixed with the hypothetical beats of the Captain & Tennille's deck-shoe shuffling version of Young MC's ""Bust a Move"". ""The Stauton Lick"" heads back into instructional tape land for a lesson in basic folk guitar techniques, and ends up sounding like a 14-year old imagining Fairport Convention covering New Order's ""All the Way"". ""His Majesty King Raam"" is the sick fantasy of two thirty-something Brits-- a kindergarten tale broadcast on the BBC's Jackanory program enhanced with Henry Mancini's ""Days of Wine and Roses"". After these trite and scoffing appropriations of bad taste, the Midnight EP seriously engages. Here, Lemon Jelly have gotten beyond novelty value and begin to layer elements, and to distill some palpable beauty from their thrift store sources. Thus, ""Kneel Before Your God"" threads folk guitar lines with delicate turntablism and seraphic synth lines; ""Page One"" is skittering, piano-driven, and club-ready. And the guys display hitherto unexpected restraint during ""Come"", in which they refrain from lubricated smut in favor of a sparse, harmonica-led treat. It's almost as though the schoolboy graphic design team within the duo has been partially defeated by their adult musician personas. But the rout is merely an incipient one; this more mature Lemon Jelly is far from being a confirmed victory for subtle moderation. Because the three tracks that comprise the Midnight EP rely far less on snickering, snobby kitsch, we can hope that Lemon Jelly will eschew juvenile mockery and perfect their technique. Only then will Deakin and Franglin overcome the tossed-off vapidity of Lemonjelly.ky and take their place with chill-out's recent masters. Of course, if the band choose to further investigate bad taste, they'd better consult WFMU's outsider music expert Irwin Chusid, and study Stock, Hausen & Walkman's considerably cooler Organ Transplants series.","The Pitchfork staffer originally assigned to write a review of Lemon Jelly's EP collection determined that he was too ...

Mass Romantic,The New Pornographers,by: Rich Juzwiak,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c3e3eb335119a49ed802/1:1/w_160/13de9ea0.jpg,2001-03-31 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5771-mass-romantic/,Mint,"Of the myriad reasons my mid-90s high school years seem, in retrospect, pretty goddamn embarrassing, my obsessive love of Britpop ranks high. Sure, my tawdry affair with the genre was spawned from an admiration of great bands like Blur, The Stone Roses, and The Smiths. I overdid it, though. Virtually any band garnering even mild buzz in the UK warranted immediate purchase, including such dodgy blokes as Sleeper and Embrace, whose music I often paid steep import prices to obtain. During college, I realized my folly and soon ditched the bulk of my Anglophilic collection, and can now officially consider myself a reformed addict. I've overcome my once-rampant desires for quick spins through Gene's Drawn to the Deep End or Kula Shaker's K. But perhaps overconfident in my ability to resist the brash, huge, often theatrical sound Britpop offers, I wandered carelessly into The New Pornographers' Mass Romantic. They're a Canadian supergroup-- how Brit can they be? Uh-oh. Here comes the relapse. The New Pornographers features the talents of Zumpano's Carl Newman, John Collins of Thee Evaporators, Dan Bejar of Destroyer, Limblifter's Kurt Dahle, filmmaker Blaine Thurier, and country chanteuse Neko Case. But it matters little that they're from this side of the Atlantic-- their peppy, gleeful, headstrong guitar pop sounds a hell of a lot like yesteryear's Britpop. Look no further than track #3 for the most telling evidence: ""The Slow Descent into Alcoholism"" showcases that rinky-dink stop/start feel that Oasis offered in ""Digsy's Diner"", a sound to be replicated by nearly every English pop act that released an album between 1994 and 1998. In ways, The New Pornographers equal the embarrassment of any bad 90s UK band. Their hyper-charged sound is of huge, circus-like proportions. Their lyrics are as ridiculous and melodramatic as they are witty. The production is absurdly clean, layered to death with sweet guitars and confectioner's multitracked vocals. But what really gets me is, I'm deeply immersed in an intensely passionate affair with Mass Romantic, to the point where my pleasure no longer feels guilty; it's ecstatic. On an album this consistently enjoyable, it's difficult to pick out highlights-- especially considering that highlights aren't something the band seems at all concerned with: the record is constructed and assembled with such cohesiveness that individual moments within songs stand out and raise the bar from infectious pop fun to raw glory. Take, for example, the sublime, Brian Wilson-inspired bridge on the bouncy, Bejar-chirped ""Jackie"", which features three vocal tracks harmonizing in rounds, singing, ""Are you gonna start the sunshine?"" ""Mystery Hours"" is heavily synthesized with zipping Moogs that emanate a thick exhaust around Carl Newman's vocals. The chorus blasts off at a frenetic pace to a place where whiplash drums and keyboards meet. The song smacks of the 1980s, though it's less an attempt at cashing in on the decade's renaissance than a channeling device to conjure a sound that's simultaneously cheesy, endearing, and contagiously synthy. ""Letter from an Occupant"" serves as an exercise in Buggles-reforming. Neko Case's shrill vibrato is initially runny and abrasive, but quickly congeals as she pours her heart out in lines like the Joni Mitchell-referencing, ""I've cried five rivers on the way here/ Which one will you skate away on?"" Again, the harmonies are top-shelf as Newman's joyous ""whoo's"" perfectly compliment Case's vocal swagger. The quality rarely ceases. Only for a brief moment, on the march, ""To Wild Homes"", does the band become too comfortable with their cheeky and toothsome niche. Still, it's only a momentary dip on an album that gives scads more to the listener than it takes from its influences. Make no mistake, The New Pornographers are a brazen bunch. Their pop is saccharine, and at times, even smarmy. It's over-the-top, but not quite beautifully absurd. Nonetheless, it makes me nostalgic for the days when ""all ages"" was a blessing, and adult theaters were something I'd only dreamed of-- a time when 60 Foot Dolls could be seen on days other than Thanksgiving, and Kenicke was, like, the best band name ever. Yes, The New Pornographers' rose-colored pop has the power to make even those times seem respectable. Unbelievable!","Of the myriad reasons my mid-90s high school years seem, in retrospect, pretty goddamn embarrassing, my obsessive love of Britpop ...

Sewn to the Sky,Smog,by: Matt LeMay,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a47cc0084474cd0c04d0/1:1/w_160/55304da0.gif,2001-03-31 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7280-sewn-to-the-sky/,self-releasedself-released,"Over the years, as I've become more and more adept at picking out which CDs from my collection to inflict on my friends, they've become more and more adept at finding swift, comical ways to write them off as crap. Most of them revolve around the central phrase, ""You spent money on this?"" But a few specific releases have given birth to fun, pointed catchphrases. Gamelan music has been christened ""Thai pot-banging music,"" and any mention of Will Oldham prompts my friends to deadpan something about bleeding mules. My friends react similarly to the works of Smog, donning a laidback expression and muttering about death and sex in a baritone. But I've only ventured to expose them to his more recent, cleanly produced records. I do this because I realize that the early efforts of Smog will earn the harshest indictment my friends can cast upon an album: a resounding ""Fozz!"" ""Fozz,"" a dramatized version of ""fuzz"" (best said in a heavy Eastern European accent), is serious business. So far, only a few select recordings have elicited the angry retort. The first, and the one responsible for originating the term, was the lo-fi classic Bee Thousand. Since then, the term has been applied mainly to such diverse albums as Pavement's Slanted and Enchanted, Boredoms' Super Are, and any record with Steve Albini on guitar. Whenever I play these guys a ""fozzy"" record, I'm confronted with the question of how I can like something so badly recorded. It seems obvious to me: it's the songs! Of course, different production techniques are highly effective in subtly altering perceptions. Crystal-clear, wide-open production can leave you feeling larger than your body; lo-fi fozz, when used properly, can make you shrink into your own mind, and leave you feeling trapped and claustrophobic. Such is the case with Sewn to the Sky, Bill Callahan's 1990 debut full-length, freshly reissued by Drag City. The album presents Callahan as equal parts singer/songwriter and grating noise generator. Using little more than a guitar, a ""dumpster portastudio,"" and his own shaky voice, Callahan constructs what could best be described as a ""wall of fozz,"" a dense amalgamation of brutally strummed acoustic guitar, various types of analog hiss, and ambiguous junkyard percussion. Sewn to the Sky captures Callahan at a pivotal moment in his career, experimenting with the textural explorations that define his early instrumental work, and the compelling songwriting that would go on to become the focus of his recording career. The record's 20 tracks run the gamut from pure guitar noise experimentation on tracks like ""Souped Up II"", to fairly structured songs like ""The Weightlifter"". But even the most structured tracks here are decidedly scrappy-- guitars are slightly out of tune, blasts of hiss come from nowhere, and Callahan's voice wavers in and out of key. Though none of Sewn to the Sky is as refined as any of Callahan's later recordings, there are hints at the kind of oddly humorous, well-constructed songs that have now become the hallmark of Callahan's work. On ""I Want to Tell You About a Man"", Callahan sings, ""I want to tell you about a man/ You won't see him on the MTV.../ His name is Jesus Christ/ Don't make me say it twice."" Sewn to the Sky is by no means an easy listen; there's very little that warrants the term ""melody."" At times, the album is just plain jarring. But while not always pleasant, its strength lies in the fact that it is deeply mood-altering. Sewn to the Sky doesn't end with your speakers-- the dirt, the claustrophobia, the awkwardness, and the unsettling terror of the record seem to seep out into your surroundings, leaving you shaken, disturbed, and insecure. The fact that Bill Callahan managed to construct such a deeply affecting record out of chaos and noise is impressive enough, but the fact that he did so one year before Slanted and Enchanted, and three years prior to Bee Thousand, is nothing short of prescient. By reissuing Sewn to the Sky, an album that can no doubt be considered a lo-fi landmark, Drag City has proven that Bill Callahan is not only one of America's most talented songwriters; he is also the godfather of fozz.","Over the years, as I've become more and more adept at picking out which CDs from my collection to ...

Few rock songs have been written solely about the explosive, orgiastic joy of unbound pleasure. In fact, most deal with the stress, anxiety and loathing that results from a lack of contentedness. Even songs that do focus on satisfaction generally mention the stress, anxiety and loathing that results from too much of it. Boiled down to its essence, rock and roll isn't about the wild pleasures of having a good time; it's about-- all together, now-- stress, anxiety and loathing. With such a set of themes, the question becomes, ""What are you supposed to do with this mess?"" No group has ever drawn a bead on this problem like the Soft Boys. Their definitive statement on the subject, Underwater Moonlight, taps into all the icky, oozing rage and fear that are necessary parts of adolescence, and, thus, the primary interests of its ideal audience. Thanks to both the roiling undercurrents of the music and the vague, paranoid rantings of singer/guitarist/songwriter Robyn Hitchcock, Underwater Moonlight sounds like a record by the nicest bar band in Freud's crazed Id. And as an added bonus, the album's not nearly as bleak and freaky as that description suggests. It's the darkest, heaviest light pop album anyone's ever made. Freshly reissued by Matador, Underwater Moonlight presents the classic Soft Boys lineup-- Hitchcock, guitarist Kimberly Rew, bassist Matthew Seligman, and drummer Morris Windsor-- as the Band of the Avenging Dorks Who Can't Get Laid. Though the bonus set of unreleased demos from the period certainly sweetens the deal, the real show here is all in the original LP. Playing honeyed pop songs with punk fury, the Soft Boys ran through tracks like ""I Wanna Destroy You"" at breakneck pace, all the while dishing up Byrdsy harmonies and jangling guitars. Hitchcock, who came off like a fey, scarf-wearing art student in the middle of a psychopathic killing spree, slurred angst-ridden, surreal images about sex and death and loathing and rot and ruin, and the joy of it all. Take, for example, the throbbing ""I Got the Hots,"" the band's endearing take on wooing: ""Said the dentures to the peach/ Said the tide of filth to the bleach/ Said the spike to the tomato/ Said the curry to the corpse/ I got the hots for you."" Fun stuff, assuredly, but not exactly the make-out record of the year. To somehow explain the weirdo menace of the production, liner-note writer David Fricke describes the circumstances of its creation. The album was made, apparently, under horribly stressful circumstances, with the band rehearsing in a humid little shack and recording under brutal low-tech conditions. Completely out of favor with the hipster record industry of the day, the band ended up initially releasing the thing themselves. That stress can be heard throughout the album: Rew knocks off genial pop riffs that conceal sharpened fangs; Seligman thumbs his bass like he's auditioning for hell's blues-rock band; and Hitchcock spits out stories about lamps and bugs and people who turn into animals. Anyone put off by the endearingly hippyish novelty act Hitchcock has become of late will be surprised to hear how genuinely monstrous he manages to sound on these sides. Whereas a lot of new-wave and punk reissues end up disappointing due to the datedness of older band's sounds, the Soft Boys seem more timeless than timed-out. Though they hardly sound of a piece with the art-rock of the modern day (no 20-minute, drum-and-bass instrumentals here, kids), they don't really fit in anywhere else, either. Instead, their peculiar fusion of the sexy and the creepy exists in an odd little world of its own. Though there are certainly reference points shared with glam, punk and folk rock, the claustrophobic-but-bouncy attack Underwater Moonlight exhibits is another thing entirely. This is all that stress, anxiety and loathing percolating under every great rock song, and made to dance in front of the crowd. In the end, of course, the power of the Soft Boys' music remains intact largely because of their strangeness. Because nobody's ever made a record that sounds exactly like this, or that even comes close to mining its depths of weird vigor, Underwater Moonlight ends up being that much more fascinating a listen. Turns out all that stress, anxiety and loathing are good for something after all.","If rock and roll is, as has always been said, the music of demonic teenage possession, of raving thugs and ...

They usually travel in pairs. Clean-cut, reed-thin young men from America's heartland. Skinny ties. Starched white shirts. Academic horn rims. ""Dressed polite,"" as we used to say, smiling even as they thrust their leg into the living room. Looking you in the eye, they ask with a mountain of conviction and concern: ""Friend, do you know the Truth?"" Earnest men. Missionaries. I think you know who I mean... fans of the Embarrassment. Clueless as to what I was in for, I asked them in for some coffee. We sat on the couch. They came a little too close, cramping my personal space. I noticed the younger one was clutching a square, wrapped package whose outline suggested a compact disc. Ken and Martin they said. ""Have you ever heard of a place called Kansas?"" the older one asked. ""What, Oz?"" I replied, and they snickered. The evangelist continued, ""Well, Kansas was the place where hundreds of people first heard the Truth, twenty years ago. There's a place there called the Cedar-- a club, actually-- where the Gospelwriters played often. The Faithful make a journey to the mecca at least once in their lifetime."" The regurgitation of scripted convers(at)ion starters tapered and dulled as I keyed in on a particular word. The gospelwriters? ""Matthew, Mark, Luke and John,"" some catechism part of me recalled. Must have been aloud, because Martin looked taken aback. ""No,"" he said. ""No, no. Bill, Ron, Brent and John. From the Embos."" Ah. It sunk in. Cult band. I offended further. ""Oh yeahhhhh. Don't they sound like the Buzzcocks? Or the Feelies?"" ""Ken,"" said the elder and gestured toward his partner. Ken stood and made for my CD player, taking two jewel cases out of his package: Blister Pop and Heyday 1979-1983. ""They go together,"" he informed me. Old Testament and New, I thought to myself (silently, this time). ""Blister Pop is the arcana,"" Martin explained. ""Outtakes, live appearances, radio spots, demos."" As the music began, his eyes just glazed over. ""The sound quality is so good, it's just like being there."" And then with a straight face, ""Live concerts are the Masses of our generation."" The stereo throbbed with the rough, flatly recorded mixes. John Nichols' everyman vocals weren't half as impressive as the furious mess of organ, cheap guitars and amps, and chocolate-chunk bass ripping out post-punk with a nervous, gangly energy. Music for small, tight places-- as lost in a stadium (or, for that matter, a cathedral), as a wandering kid in a department store aisle-maze. Music for people who can't keep their hands still. As a matter of fact, by the sixth track, Ken could hardly contain himself. He twitched a bit unnervingly, nearly in time to the music. My ministering friend: ""Do you watch public television, John?"" ""I don't see how..."" ""I thought so. Have you ever stumbled on a fascinating, well-made documentary about a subject or place that you never knew existed? Some alien species of insect living in the parched desert; the untold story of a bridge-building project 50 years ago that snowballed out of control; true war stories of one-legged women spies operating in Vichy, France? Blister Pop is like that-- it opens the door to a world that you weren't aware of. It's enlightenment, John. It's one of our most effective evangelical tools, really. It makes people aware."" ""Well, sure."" Based on what I heard, I could go along with all that. ""Thanks. I think I'd like to hear more of this."" But once the floodgates of soul-saving were opened, Martin was unstoppable. ""The genius of 'Podman' or 'Elizabeth Montgomery's Face'-- those could only have been divinely inspired. Mere mortals couldn't have written them. And look what the Embos did to covers like 'Maybe Baby' or 'Time Has Come Today,' 'No Reply.' You already know a lot of these songs; Blister Pop is one-third covers. But you don't know them the way the Embarrassment plays them."" ""How old were you in 1981?"" asked Martin, changing gears. ""Ten"" I said, suddenly growing more skeptical. ""You missed it all. This is your only hope for understanding, John. These twenty tracks of rarities. You need this."" The younger picked up the liner notes and turned to Page 8: Track 13. He quoted from ""Song for Val"": ""I don't care for old people/ Very, very old people."" That was the proverbial straw. ""No, thank you."" I said and stood abruptly, shoving them toward the door and handing them their coats. ""We're here to help you..."" Martin began. ""No, thank you,"" I interrupted. Shove. ""But they were influential"" he pleaded. ""I gave at the office."" Martin's voice took on a desperate pitch. ""Can't you see? You missed out on something special, something unique. The synchronicity of life is all about being in the right place at the right time. Those happy few who attended University of Kansas or Wichita State at the dawn of the post-punk era, they were the fortunate ones-- far more fortunate than you or me. They had the Embarrassment in real time. We only have their legacy!"" ""I prefer the Del Fuegos!"" I lied. ""Get out!"" I slammed the door and waited until the pair was all the way to the sidewalk and safely out of earshot. Then I walked to the stereo, reset the disc and boosted the volume.","Have the evangelists come to your door yet? They usually travel in pairs. Clean-cut, reed-thin young men from America's ...

How I Loved You,The Angels of Light,by: Rich Juzwiak,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a099c0084474cd0bfbfb/1:1/w_160/9dd5b895.gif,2001-03-27 06:00:01,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/186-how-i-loved-you/,Young GodYoung God,"If my 22 years of pop culture consumption have taught me anything, it's that clichés are the vertebrae of our language. Mainstream media perpetuates the sad state of our communication as a society-- our tendency to say what we believe is true because we've heard it so many times on television or from Hollywood or on Top 40 radio. This cycle that produces, nurtures, and transforms our interaction undermines individuality. And yet, there's something comforting in using stock phrases to help us express our feelings; if we are to believe in a construct like ""the human condition,"" it might as well follow that there are only a handful of ways to express our state(s) lucidly. Certainly, the bombardment of triteness simply can't hypnotize all of us all of the time. We who wear the badge of ""cynic"" proudly do our best to develop linguistic calluses and shun clichés as much as possible. M. Gira, the mastermind of the Angels of Light and formerly of the Swans, is one such cynic who does his damnedest to thwart all things trite in his art. Odds are that he should fail on his newest record, How I Loved You, since he's singing mostly about the most potentially insipid subject: love. Generally, Gira is successful in sounding at least somewhat fresh in his amorous lyrical approach. The problem is, he seems so afraid of rehashing that he ends up utterly obtuse (those who read criticism in The Village Voice are all too familiar with this unfortunate phenomenon). A line like, ""The red sea is raging/ With my coughing and spitting/ My love is bitter sulpher [sic] burning"" (from ""My True Body""), is too preoccupied with flowery, unlikely imagery to even make sense. And in ""Song for Nico,"" he comes closer to ""gross"" than ""provocative"" when he sings, ""I am the reason your legs are apart/ Mother, come into my heart."" Though Gira and his Angels are less cautious musically, they don't necessarily fare better in that department than they do lyrically. With two songs clocking in around eight minutes, and two more pushing the 12-minute mark, the Angels of Light are clearly attempting Gladiator-scale epics. But these songs (along with most of the others on How I Loved You) are bereft of a sense of experimentation. The drab, forgettable songwriting and acoustic folk framework is rarely altered over the course of the record, save in terms of texture. The ubiquitous crescendos and sparse-to-large-to-sparse dynamic become too predictable to sustain interest for more than three minutes, let alone an entire hour. The space between the pedestrian and the abstract is a dubious void that only the most skilled lyricists and musicians can squeeze down. The fact that Gira attempts the monumental, snug fit is admirable. Sure, he sounds like he means what he's saying, but his esoteric words seem born more out of self-satisfaction than pleasing listeners. Ultimately, conviction does not compensate for inaccessibility; Gira's calluses, you see, sound much more like warts.","If my 22 years of pop culture consumption have taught me anything, it's that\n\ clich\xE9s are the ...

Month of Sundays,Chamber Strings,by: Dan Kilian,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a57f9d034d5c69bf32ed/1:1/w_160/58cd6796.gif,2001-03-27 06:00:00,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1394-month-of-sundays/,BobsledBobsled,"I read a review of Neil Finn's latest album on NME's website. It described this former Crowded House leader's work as ""shite"" or some other of those British term that makes those tooth freaks of the United Kingdom so indecipherable. I'm pretty sure from the context that the reviewer hates Neil Finn, and always has. Perhaps they had really good music in England in the mid-'80s, because I thought Crowded House was a breath of fresh air at the time. Whenever I was trapped listening to someone's Top 40 station, there were few such happy oases as ""Don't Dream It's Over."" Crowded House's biggest sin was their continuous drift further into the mellow, leaving some of the snap of their melodies and smart harmonies. So maybe the new Neil Finn record is ""shite,"" maybe it's not, but don't write off the guy's whole career. Chamber Strings sounds a lot like later Crowded House. Don't know Crowded House from Bananarama? Well, then, sorry about that first paragraph. Chamber Strings, of course, aren't as good as Crowded House was. Frontman Kevin Junior, whom some may remember from the Rosehips or Mystery Girls, has a nice, likeable face, dresses sharply, and can write competently good, if not compellingly great songs. There are a lot of strings (presumably played in some sort of chamber) that have the effect of a hackneyed production device joining a band. Sort of an Acoustic Light Orchestra. The most hummable tune is ""Make It Through September,"" which sports a bouncy piano, a good tune, and some chronologically and thematically scattered lyrics about summer and love. I'm pretty sure that, in one verse, Junior describes December as ""The end of summer/ Autumn time."" Maybe he's saying September, and I'm just going deaf. Or maybe, like a good rock star, he's just confused. It's a fine song, anyway. Unfortunately, too many of these ballads just drift in the reverb, and sometimes the songwriting seems lazy. Too often Junior falls back on languid ""doot de doots"" on a song that hasn't fully explained itself. An irritating device used a few times is the Beatle-trademarked fadeback (though, technically, the Beach Boys did it first on ""Caroline No""). It's always some dreamy continuation of the song that just played, and always unnecessary. Month of Sundays isn't a bad record, and I could see how some could like the Chamber Strings. Perhaps diehard Crowded House fans or Sarah McLachlanians wanting to trade up. I can't, however, see anyone saying, ""This is the greatest album in the world!"" It's simply soft and nice. And soft.","I read a review of Neil Finn's latest album on NME's website. It described this former Crowded House ...

By the end of my vacation, I was seriously looking forward to going home-- to the fluffy pillows, the hundred channels of cable television, and a bathroom that's only slightly vermin-infested. But no sooner had I set foot in the front door than I began to slink back into that all-too-familiar rut that only home can provide. I immediately settled into the firmly established ass-groove in my desk chair, received the hundred or so e-mail messages that were waiting for me. And then I stubbed my fucking toe. Fortunately, I was also coming home to my stereo. If I was going to be miserable, at least I was fully equipped to provide an adequate soundtrack for low-level depression and aching digit. And while Home is Where it Hurts could sadly not provide decent accompaniment for the throbbing toe pain, it makes a rather pleasant companion for a transition from care-free vacation days to the saddening realization that I'm going to be in the same place for a long, long time. Home is Where It Hurts, the most recent entry into the band's massive canon of work-- they've issued 4 full-lengths, 11 singles, 4 split singles, 26 compilation tracks and 4 remix records over the course of the past 10 years-- is 25 minutes of deliberate, meditative rock, served up with flourishes of piano, strings, and skittering drum machine beats. At the heart of its best moments is the pairing of straightforward, slow-to-mid-tempo songs with frenetic, glitchy percussion. This combination is the first thing heard on Home is Where It Hurts, and largely defines the sound of the record. The EP's title track begins by pairing hyper pre-programmed kicks and snares with plucked acoustic guitar. As layers of guitars, drums, and muttered vocals build, the track develops into a lovely rock song, though the interplay of the electronic percussion with the organic instruments gradually loses steam. A better example of Hood's incorporation of crazed drum machines amidst melancholy pop strains would be ""The World Touches Too Hard,"" the EP's standout. A hissing electrobeat permeates layers of strings, reverb-tinged guitars, and claustrophobic vocals. The piercing blasts of treble amidst a sea of mid-range really brings the track to life, elevating it above the pretty but occasionally dull nature of the rest of the record. Indeed, many of the strengths and weaknesses of Home is Where It Hurts seem to come simply with the type of music Hood plays. The songs here develop quite deliberately, but never really deviate from the path that they carves out for themselves at the outset. Hood may not possess the fragile beauty of their better contemporaries, but the music is sonically dense enough to keep you interested. In other words, it's nice accompaniment for relaxing or applying ice to a swollen toe, but you probably won't be taking it on any road trips.","Having just come back from a really nice four-day vacation, I can pretty safely say that the boys in Hood ...

BBC Sessions 1964-1977,The Kinks,by: Ryan Kearney,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bbb8eb335119a49ecadb/1:1/w_160/9dccc321.gif,2001-03-20 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4459-bbc-sessions-1964-1977/,SanctuarySanctuary,"Although many critics are content to rank them alongside second-tier bands such as the Animals and Creation, the Kinks were arguably one of the four great bands of the British Invasion. Maybe they weren't as bold as the Beatles, as contentious as the Stones, or as audacious as the Who. But if you consider true greatness in terms of influence and innovation-- not to mention a little popularity, as the times required-- then the Kinks, namely Ray and Dave Davies, have secured their place atop rock 'n' roll's Mount Olympus. Consider this: when the Kinks released ""You Really Got Me"" in 1964, the Beatles were nodding their heads, playing to the ladies; for they had yet to cry ""Help!"" The Who were still a year away from ""My Generation,"" but in the meantime would come up with ""I Can't Explain,"" which owed Third World-degree debt to ""You Really Got Me."" And when the Stones weren't still covering R&B; songs, they were busy taking cues from the Beatles-- which wouldn't change until the epiphany of the following year's ""(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction."" At a time when rock 'n' roll was evolving faster than ever before, the Kinks were, for the time being, the loudest (white) rock out there. So the Kinks' relatively congenial relationship with the traditional BBC was indeed odd, especially considering that the BBC primarily broadcast music by dance bands and orchestras. The relationship started, as one might expect, with ""You Really Got Me,"" as well as three other tracks recorded at London's Playhouse Theatre on September 7, 1964. Usually, the BBC-- referred to in the liner notes, eerily enough, as ""the great Corporation""-- would have screened a track such as ""You Really Got Me,"" particularly since rock 'n' roll was in its infancy and was thus considered both an aberration and a threat. But the single tore through the charts so fast that they waived the review process. Appropriately, this double-disc opens with a quintessentially stiff voice saying, ""And now meet the Kinks, five more representatives of the [exaggerated pause] shaggy set. And let's hear that number one, 'You Really Got Me.'"" That revelatory track-- astoundingly, just their third single-- follows. The defiant riff, groundbreaking solo and trademark harmonizing and screaming vocals are there, but this classic song is marred by the same limitations that hinder this entire collection-- those being underproduction and sloppy musicianship. After all, most of these tracks are one-and-done takes with only essential overdubs, and they were recorded to BBC's equipment, which was subpar even for its time. The admittedly extensive liner notes say that this ""adds to the charm of the recordings,"" but they couldn't have backpedaled more had they insisted that the Kinks, despite popular belief, were indeed a strong live act. Wait, they do that, too. And then when you consider the abundant between-song introductions and banter-- ""Now, why do you wear your hair so long, lads?"" ""I think the girls go for it, man, you know. They used to go for a moustache, but now it's long hair."" ""Well, I'm sorry to hear that. I couldn't grow mine long if I tried, so let's change the subject."" -- you've got an album that, despite all its protestations otherwise, seems simply intended for its historical insight. As such, it is worthy indeed. Arranged chronologically, the album provides a fluid musical timeline of the Kinks from their R&B; roots (""Cadillac""; ""Milk Cow Blues"") to their creative peak in the late 60's (""Death of a Clown""; ""Village Green Preservation Society"") and then on to the unfortunate rock opera grandiosity of the 70's (""Demolition""; ""Money Talks""), which renders the second disc disposable. (For all intents and purposes, the collection stops at 1974, as only one song-- 1977's ""Get Back in Line""-- dates later.) Other than a few exceptions-- ""Love Me 'til the Sun Shines,"" for instance-- almost all of these songs are inferior to their album versions (the Kinks were an underrated studio talent). Furthermore, plenty indisputable classics, like ""Shangri-La"" and ""Lola,"" don't appear here; undoubtedly, some were never broadcast on the BBC, but it's hard to believe so many weren't played during the 24 sessions. And then there's the issue of the last four tracks, which, by inexplicably jumping back in years, disrupt the chronological fluidity of the album. Thus, BBC Sessions 1964-1977 must be deemed worthwhile for completists only. For those who lived during the Kinks' early rise and their subsequently rocky ride, this album will provide an interesting flashback. And for those of us who didn't, this album is mildly interesting-- once. Yes, the Kinks were a great band that stood out even during the rock 'n' roll explosion of the 60's, but you won't sense much of their brilliance on these recordings.","Although many critics are content to rank them alongside second-tier bands such as the Animals and Creation, the Kinks were ...

Bob Dinners and Larry Noodles Present Tubby Turdner's Celebrity Avalanche,Thinking Fellers Union Local 282,by: Joe Tangari,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a77bea9e61561daa55cc/1:1/w_160/356d630e.gif,2001-03-20 06:00:03,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8008-bob-dinners-and-larry-noodles-present-tubby-turdners-celebrity-avalanche/,CommunionCommunion,"Remember Kool-Aid Man? You don't? Oh. Well, let me tell you about him. He was this gigantic pitcher of Kool-Aid who used to blast through the walls of people's homes whenever mom was mixing up a batch of the horrid bug-juice and yell, ""Oh, yeah!"" in a guttural Hulk Hogan growl. I had a lot of problems with this. For one, he was fucking terrifying! What would you do if an oversized vat of red, watery liquid came bashing through your wall, yelling, ""Oh, yeah!"" and sloshing on your floor? You'd freak out, that's what. And these people were thrilled! What about the bills for wall repair? And where did he come from, anyway? What is he, even? Though my traumatic memories of Kool-Aid Man-- and his short-lived Saturday morning cartoon-- may never truly fade, I think I may be able to put them in some perspective now. You see, a bizarre monstrosity recently crashed unexpectedly through my wall. And I like it. I call this monstrosity Thinking Fellers Union Local 282, and you should, too, because that's their name. Bob Dinners and Larry Noodles Present Tubby Turdner's Celebrity Avalanche is possibly the worst album title in the world, ever. But then again, the band's name is so long and awkward that the two cancel each other out. These guys' history dates back more than 15 years, but the time the band took off after 1997's disastrous tour opening for Live seems to have paid off in spades. For the life of me, I can't imagine what was going through the head of the concert promoter who teamed one of the weirdest bands San Francisco has ever produced with Secret Samadhi-era Ed Kowalczyk. Celebrity Avalanche blasts open with ""Another Clip,"" a raging mass of garage rock guitars alternately pounding the Stooges into the ground and mimicking J.S. Bach with tossed-off guitar figures. The vocals are melodic, but understated. Noises enter and exit the mix seemingly at random, like a bastard offshoot of the Residents. Kool-Aid Man has arrived. The Piper at the Gates of Dawn-style hand percussion and heavily processed vocals of ""Sno Cone"" call this band's collective sanity into question, especially when followed by the off-key falsetto caterwauling of the chorus. Somewhere in Heaven, Frank Zappa is smiling. Or doing speedballs with John Belushi. The album is filled with short interludes that seem to be randomly extracted bits of larger performances. ""You Will Be Eliminated"" is a 12-second gossamer burst of wind noises and distant, mechanical voices, while ""Birth of a Rock Song"" sounds exactly like what its title suggests it is. ""Boob Feeler"" distorts an ages-old descending bassline under spooky whistling, but refuses to develop itself, preferring instead to fade out and leave you wanting more. And then the Fellers give you ""In the Stars I Can Sizzle Like a Battery,"" which showcases more demonic guitar work from Hugh Swarts and Mark Davies. The guys also offer up some truly demented lyrics here, delivered in a hilariously melodramatic falsetto. See if you can catch the Zappa reference: ""Call Me Bruce or call me Troy or call me Dave/ I'm selling sauce in a crass parade/ Lumpy gravy dripping through my psyche/ I suspect that my synapses are flickering/ Thick and greasy, ploggered and pasty/ I do declare, there's a syrup on my sanity."" Indeed. Even Kool-Aid Man has fled in terror by now. The simple truth here is that I have no idea why I like this music. I just do. There's a madcap genius that pervades everything from the brilliant prog-rock send-up ""Holy Ghost"" to the ten-minute, eddying closer ""He Keeps Himself Fed."" And that's not to mention the album's true masterstroke, ""You in a Movie."" Bassist Anne Eickelberg and drummer Jay Paget lay down a thick groove while Davies, Swarts and Brian Hageman layer noises and quivery guitar riffs over the proceedings. Lee Ranaldo wishes he could be this dissonant. And the lyrics! ""A cow mooed, then it called my name/ 'I could put any one of you in a movie'/ It licked me, then it looked away/ I lost a lot of blood that day/ How's a cowpie like a cow?/ The secret's in the cow."" What does it all mean? Frankly, I don't care. All I know is that these Thinking Fellers have made one crazy album after another for the past 13 years, and that Celebrity Avalanche is one of their best. Left field recordings like this aren't exactly hard to come by, but they're rarely this good. Provided they don't go on strike anytime soon, Thinking Fellers Union Local 282 stand to make a lot more wonderfully warped music. And Kool-Aid Man ain't got nothin' on that.","Remember Kool-Aid Man?

What he means, I think, is that the current of popular culture doesn't flow in a straight line; it rolls into little tributaries and unpredictable whirlpools without any regard to what we'd like its direction to be. With all the late-60's hero-worship going on these days, this might be something we'll want to keep in mind. Of course, the Minders might disagree. Like their spiritual godfathers, the Apples (in Stereo), the genial Portland collective make four-track-recorded symphonies, clearly indebted to the Beatles and Beach Boys. As if the history of popular music could be represented as one of those monkey-to-man charts where the subject in question starts out knuckle-dragging and hairy and ends up straight-postured and clean-shaven. To Martyn Leaper, the Minders' guiding light, it's pretty apparent that the collective personage of Lennon, McCartney and Wilson represents the pinnacle of human evolution, and anything that steps too far off the path of their particular beliefs runs the risk of turning into something completely alien-- like if you don't have massed harmonies, elaborate arrangements, and sweetly naïve lyrics about love and loss, you're not really human anymore. This is, of course, a patently extreme way of putting things, but that doesn't mean it's not a little bit true. Over the Minders' assembled body of work, they've only really developed a single idea. Their debut, Hooray for Tuesday, was sweet and goofy chamber-pop with a few modern touches thrown in, and the following collection of demos and old singles indicated that Leaper's heart had been set on such sugary confections from the get-go. Golden Street is a slightly more complex recitation of exactly the same values, and, if you don't mind setting the Wayback Machine every time you turn on your CD player, it's a pretty nice way to spend an afternoon. The trouble, though, is that there's not much new to be unearthed here. According to Costello's Elephant Principle, the Minders want very badly to be exactly in the path of what they perceive as being the single direction popular music is evolving in. Having hitched their aesthetic wagons to a single horse, they no longer seem to feel what they're doing. Instead, Leaper and his band of pals (which includes current Jick Joanna Bolme) have chosen a specific vocabulary for what they do, and they're more than content to ride the angle out as far as it will take them. What's more unfortunate about Golden Street is that it's clearly more restrained and traditional than any of the band's previous outings. The best moment on Tuesday was, by far, the funny transition between ""Bubble,"" an oddly minimal instrumental for bass drum and guitar, and the relatively epic closer, ""Frieda."" There's little of that kind of experimentation on Golden Street, as the band just try to write as many Pet Sounds-era gems as they can before their well of inspiration runs dry. Unfortunately, without the deep, intuitive commitment to sound Brian Wilson had, the Minders end up sounding rote and a little bit straightjacketed. Whereas the Beach Boys' finest moments came out of tossing the rulebook they'd been handed in the past, the Minders are so committed to following their ancestors that they can't find anywhere for their own more idiosyncratic moments to fit. This kind of rigid formalism is unfortunate, because Leaper's a very talented songwriter: he has a way with a hook, and the mannered arrangements are modestly compelling. But because everything here has been done somewhere else-- and by someone driven to create a sound they could only hear in their head-- we don't get the same thrill out of listening that Leaper got out of writing. Instead, it sounds like he's lashed himself to an elephant that can't possibly change direction however much it wants to. If the rest of us have to put up with the more confusing rivulets and rivers that get produced by the pop-music-as-water metaphor, we're still better off. At least we're given the occasional pleasure of being genuinely surprised.","Elvis Costello has said that pop music isn't an elephant charging directly\n\ at you; it's more like ...

Hoshi No Koe,Nobukazu Takemura,by: Mark Richardson,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a7215e6ef95969320ed6/1:1/w_160/624ddc95.gif,2001-03-20 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7922-hoshi-no-koe/,Thrill JockeyThrill Jockey,"Most Americans know Nobukazu Takemura by Scope, his first album for Thrill Jockey. As high as the highs on that record were (I've written before about how emotionally engaging I find ""Kepler""), it offered only a narrow slice of Takemura's musical personality. The precise and abstract line drawings on the cover in part reflected the album's content. ""Taw,"" for example, resonates mainly as an example of what can be done with modular synthesizer software. The base sound material of that track is interesting, sure, but I still find the composition of the track confusing and ultimately devoid of feeling. Aside from Scope, the majority of Takemura's solo work (most of which is only available on import) has been released under the name Child's View. The title of this project gives some clue as to where he's coming from. What does it mean to have a child's view? There's the romanticized notion that there's something good and pure about the way kids see the world-- the idea that children have some special insight into the essential, an insight lost somewhere around the same time as ""innocence."" Indie pop fans might recognize this attitude as one of the founding principals of K Records. I think of childhood and the ""child's view"" differently. To me, childhood is a time of hyper-intense feelings that are almost possible to understand or express. Internally and externally, nothing makes sense. For example, I remember Walter Cronkite anchoring the CBS evening news in 1975. I always left the room to play with toys when Cronkite showed up, but one day I decided to stick around and see what all the fuss was about. As I watched, I could only understand every third or fourth word. He was probably talking about Cambodia or something, reeling off Southeast Asian place names. Suffice to say, I couldn't make out a thing. I wondered how other people in my house could enjoy it. It was a lonely feeling. I think Takemura has an uncanny understanding of this perspective, and even more amazing, realizes how to turn it into music. Hoshi No Koe is a rich album that goes a long way in fusing the split between Scope and his Child's View material. The simple melodicism is here. There's even a semi-traditional pop song in ""Sign,"" complete with vocodered singing (I know everyone is sick of vocal processing; it's still working for me). But the fuzzy abstraction on Hoshi No Koe seems more grounded and easier to access. Take the sixth track, ""A Chrysalis."" Through its long first section, it seems to move randomly as small clusters of distorted chords are occasionally interrupted by clanging percussion. But somewhere around the eight-minute mark, the haphazard buzzes coalesce to form one long, gorgeous tone that extends for another eight. A chrysalis is, of course, a pupating butterfly, and this title makes perfect sense. It's so much easier to hear the sounds squirming in their cocoon when you realize how beautifully they'll emerge. ""Anemometer"" is the only place Takemura indulges his pronounced Steve Reich fixation. Electric piano, organ and clarinet play hypnotic patterns that don't so much change as build up and fall apart. Underneath the pulses lies an awkward drum machine that tries to keep up, misses beats, and occasionally drops out altogether. It's fascinating to hear how ""Anemometer,"" which is very pretty even during a casual listen, as it constantly struggles to find its footing. Equally poignant, but in a completely different way, are the short, almost folky tracks that crop up between the lengthier statements. The opening ""One Day"" features the distant sound of oceans and forest beneath the lone instrument, an organ playing a MIDI variation on a music box theme. ""Stairs in Stars"" find the same keyboard playing what most would describe as a carousel melody, stark and alone in the absence of children's voices. ""Sign"" is the pop tune, and a fine one it is; the warm electro beat seems wrapped in a layer of cotton, and the sunny melody is immediately appealing. At 77 minutes, Hoshi No Koe is perhaps too long and varied for its own good, and some of the noisier bits still seem somewhat out of place. But nothing else I'm hearing these days can match Takemura for capturing the complicated feelings I associate with growing up. It's always been hard to talk about. Now I can just listen.","Most Americans know Nobukazu Takemura by Scope, his first album for Thrill Jockey. As high as the highs on that ...

Once,The Tyde,by: Joe Tangari,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a85c13d1975652139628/1:1/w_160/3227cb0e.gif,2001-03-20 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8231-once/,Orange SkyOrange Sky,"So there we were, sitting around waiting for the hallucinations to start. ""Man, this is going to be so cool!"" I said to Jimmy, who was leaning on a pine tree, looking at the fire. Neither of us had ever tripped on mushrooms before. ""Yeah, dude,"" he said. ""Way cooler than that time we ate raw Kool-Aid and I puked on your sister's shoe."" ""Yeah, way cooler than that,"" I said. ""Turn the music on, man. We need a little atmosphere if this is going to work correctly."" Jimmy put the Tyde's debut album in the stereo and hit play. ""Dude, I hear this is, like, totally psychedelic. Three of these guys are in Beachwood Sparks."" ""Aren't they a country band or something?"" I asked. ""I thought they were basically a throwback to the Flying Burrito Brothers."" ""Well, kinda."" But it's just the drummer, the lap steel guy and the bassist. The other half of the band is different, so it's not really the same band."" The album's first song, ""All My Bastard Children,"" wafted out of the speakers. Big, clean guitars arpeggiated over a leisurely drumbeat before being joined by Darren Rademaker's baritone musings on cheating lovers and drug abuse. It was pleasant, but I couldn't see it enhancing the mood much. ""Hey, this is pretty good,"" said Jimmy. ""It's nice and mellow. This song, 'New Confessions,' is close to Beachwood Sparks, with all the swelling steel guitars."" ""The melody sounds like it came from a Blue Oyster Cult song, though,"" I said. ""Either way, these guys are stuck in 1972."" ""Strangers Again"" began to play. ""Whoa! If I didn't know better, I'd say that intro was lifted from an early Flaming Lips song or something. Ann Do's warbly, pitch-altered keyboards and the strained falsettos are pretty psychedelic, I guess. But I'm still not seeing anything."" ""Yeah, me neither,"" intoned Jimmy, reaching for the bong. He took a big, long puff and immediately started coughing like crazy. ""Ugh. I don't know if this is working like it's supposed to. This smoke is really weird."" ""It smells kind of like a French restaurant,"" I offered, as the ""Get Around Too,"" yet another ode to lovers going everywhere but to their own bed, swooned from the stereo. ""Wow, when the cymbal-heavy drums finally kick in and those guitars start the slow, raking strums, it's pretty cool. I think this is my favorite part so far. It's pretty psychedelic, but man, I'm still not seeing anything."" ""You know what I don't like about this stuff?"" Jimmy asked, suddenly looking more focused than usual. ""Every song uses the same types of scales. It's all this pentatonic stuff over and over again."" ""You can't really fault them for that, though, dude. Every other psychedelic song ever recorded is pentatonic, be it British, American, or... I don't know... Italian. It just sounds spacy. Which makes this music kind of weird. The Tyde sound like a country band from space. They should all go live on a space ranch or something."" ""Whoa. Space ranch! That'd be so cool!"" Jimmy sat back and gazed at the stars for a second. ""Damn! I'm fucking still not seeing anything. What about you, spaceboy?"" ""Well, I made that stupid space ranch remark a little easier than I'd like to admit, but, no, I don't think I'm seeing anything. You'd think with all the phaser on that organ in 'The Dawn' we'd be seeing all kinds of crazy stuff by now."" ""Phasers are cool,"" mused Jimmy, throwing a stick onto the fire. ""We should have brought marshmallows, you know that?"" ""The Dawn"" petered out in a wash of phasers, harmonies and buzzy organs. A slightly chill breeze blew through the woods. You could hear the highway in the distance. The sky was so clear. You could see the band of the Milky Way stretching out in both directions, 100,000 light years thick. If I was going to have my first trip, this was the place to do it. Of course, the trip was refusing to materialize. ""Are you sure we're doing this right?"" I asked. ""Is the bong set up properly? Are you even supposed to smoke mushrooms? I heard you're supposed to eat them."" ""This is how my friend Al said to do it!"" defended Jimmy. ""I don't know why it's not working. Maybe the music's not psychedelic enough. I should have brought Disraeli Gears."" ""The music's plenty psychedelic, Jimmy. I think we're doing it wrong. You kind of have a point about the music, now that I think about it, though. It's psychedelic in a very American way, with those California steel guitars and the loose, jammy vibe. It's the kind of music that'd probably be enhanced by hallucinations, but it's not the kind of stuff that'd ever produce them. 'Improper' even sounds a bit like Crooked Rain-era Pavement, only more produced."" ""Hey, I think I'm starting to see stuff!"" said Jimmy, getting excited. ""Oh, wait, that's just a smudge on my glasses."" I took another puff from the bong. ""Dude, nothing's happening. What kind of mushrooms are these, anyway?"" ""They're Portuguese. I think they're called 'portabello.'"" ""What?! You idiot! You can't trip on fuckin' portabello mushrooms! My mom serves these when we have important company over!"" There was an awkward silence between the two of us as ""Your Tattoos"" played in the background. It was a pleasant little mid-tempo number just like most of the rest of the record, filled out with subtle steel guitar flourishes and some understated two-part harmonies. ""Well, I guess that explains the French restaurant smell,"" said Jimmy dejectedly. He pulled the collar of his flannel shirt up a bit to ward off the breeze. ""Damn, we should have brought marshmallows."" ""Shit. Well, man, it's no big deal. There'll be other times for this. Let's just listen to the last song and go home."" ""Yeah, okay,"" said Jimmy. ""I suppose it wasn't a totally wasted evening."" ""Silver's Okay Michelle"" opened with quiet strumming and delayed guitars echoing in the background. Rademaker entered sounding a lot like Seven Percent Solution's Reese Beeman-- appropriate given how much the music sounded like modern Texas psych with a steel guitar. It was good. A regular chip off the chocolate fireball. As the body of the song gave way to an extended coda, full of rumbling drums, freaked-out guitars and swirling keyboards, I swear I had a little, four-second hallucination-- a sunset in the middle of the forest. The Tyde's pastoral psych had finally hit me where it wanted to, and with no drugs at all. ""Hey, let's go,"" said Jimmy as the laser slid back across its track in the player. ""Make sure we've got everything."" ""Yeah, it's all here,"" I said. I threw the remaining mushrooms into the woods and stamped out the fire. ""Next time, we'll bring marshmallows.""","So there we were, sitting around waiting for the hallucinations to start. ""Man, this is going to be so cool ...

Consciousness,Windy & Carl,by: Mark Richardson,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929aa485e6ef95969321567/1:1/w_160/9ca70ff5.gif,2001-03-19 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8699-consciousness/,Kranky,"I had a professional massage the other day, my first. I thought about bringing my own music, figuring I knew a bit more about The Chill than your average bodywork technician, but then I decided to defer to her experience at the last minute. One of the CDs I considered bringing to the Big Rub was this Windy & Carl album. Consciousness would work better for a massage than past albums by the duo, because it has a slightly warmer, more pastoral feel. Absent is the vague dread of Antarctica and the claustrophobic edge that drifted in and out of Depths. The song titles on Consciousness reinforce the relative buoyancy of sound. I heard the first track a half-dozen times before I noticed that it was called ""The Sun,"" which immediately seemed the perfect title. Consisting of just three major chords plucked on an electric guitar and then run through a delay pedal, it's a simple, direct statement. ""Balance (Trembling)"" is the only track that touches on the darker shadings of albums past, but that's quickly corrected by the glowing shafts of light that grace ""Elevation."" The guitar feedback here is far too controlled to be threatening, and the various synthesizers and effects pedals are programmed to deliver the roundest tones possible. As a kid, I had a dream in which I slowly orbited the Cloud City from The Empire Strikes Back. ""Elevation"" is the soundtrack to that dream. Indeed, given the tone of many of these tracks, Subconsciousness would have been a better title for the album. Unfortunately, that title was already taken by Japanese ambient glitch project Neina, for their record on Mille Plateaux last year. Windy & Carl seem to acknowledge the hallucinatory quality in this particular state of awareness with ""The Llama's Dream."" Picking up with the shimmering tones of ""Elevation,"" the tune features Windy's first vocals on the album about three minutes in, as the drone gives way to Carl's Dean Wareham-inspired strumming. The title track is similarly song-oriented, with hazy strums and quiet singing, and then ""Resolution"" takes one more stab at the ultimate Om. More than anything, Consciousness documents Windy & Carl's relentless search for the perfect drone. These two won't be happy until they find a combination of sounds that encompasses all feeling, at which point they will then stretch that chord to the vanishing point. Windy & Carl are too committed to their quest to consider variety for the sake of variety, so don't approach this one expecting a major departure. But if you're tuned in, it should turn you on.","I had a professional massage the other day, my first. I thought about bringing my own music, figuring I knew ...

Know Your Enemy,Manic Street Preachers,by: Brendan Reid,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c38c5e6ef95969323864/1:1/w_160/6a67a834.gif,2001-03-19 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5072-know-your-enemy/,Virgin,"THE STATE OF THE WORLD
by Brendan Here is what I know about the state of the world: 1. We are rich. 2. There are no wars or anything (real wars, that is). 3. Ummm. Very little continental drift going on (that's probably normal). 4. Somewhere, the president's daughter is ""like, totally wasted"" right now. There. One minor problem. Otherwise, things are swell. I haven't really researched this much, but if something major was going wrong, I'm sure someone would have told me. So what are these Manic Street Preachers bitching about? They've certainly got as solid a basis for their angst as anyone else. To briefly rehash the requisite facts that every Manics review must by law contain: on the cusp of fame, after courting British stardom for years and releasing the critically acclaimed The Holy Bible, the band's famously unstable lyricist Richey James suddenly and completely disappeared, leaving the band stranded. Although they went on to fulfill all expectations, releasing the huge-selling (in Britain, at least) Everything Must Go and This is My Truth Tell Me Yours as a trio, that's sure to leave some personal issues. As personal as the songs on Know Your Enemy may be, there's always a definite political thread tied up in there, too. Though the band's agenda can get mighty opaque at times, the album feels throughout like some sort of call to arms. And they're not just preaching to the converted. Rather than aiming stylistically at a certain audience, Know Your Enemy finds the Manics attempting to write a protest song in just about every genre. This project, stretched out over 16 tracks and 75 minutes, quickly reaches epic proportions, with an ambition approached only by the magnitude of its flaws. The range of the album makes it difficult to discern where the band's stylistic allegiances really lie. While punked-up anthems like the opening track, ""Found That Soul"" and ""Intravenous Agnostic"" make the most immediate impression, the band seems to be at its most sublimely confident in the jangle-pop of tracks like ""The Year of Purification"" and ""Epicentre."" Even some of the songs that initially sound like goofs have a core of sincerity. Ignore the sleighbells and ""So Why So Sad"" sounds like a genuine Beach Boys homage. The ballad ""Let Robeson Sing,"" while flirting with parody in its brazen, throaty admiration, positively drips with honesty, cutting closer to the heart of the band's politics than any other song on the album. Some of the more interesting tracks paste together a number of styles: ""Wattsville Blues,"" with its collage of drum machines, acoustic guitars, organs, and Fall-ish speak-singing, finds the band wearing their influences as prominently and distinctly as their varied politics. The band spreads itself thin, for sure; but, amazingly, it doesn't spread itself too thin. With the exception of an annoying anti-European Union disco number, the music is delivered with energy and ability. The songs aren't uniformly memorable, however, and with the better songs clustered toward the front of the album, the Manics have started repeating themselves by the time ""Dead Martyrs"" and ""His Last Painting"" roll around. But what a beginning-- ""Found That Soul"" distills all of the band's exhortations into a concentrated blast, while ""Ocean Spray"" takes a more melodic and compassionate approach without losing any of the passion. The excellent trio of ""Let Robeson Sing,"" ""The Year of Purification,"" and ""Wattsville Blues"" follows two songs later. It's not until ""Epicentre"" that they reach the same heights. The tracks in between are nothing to trifle with; however, perhaps because of the album's length, they tend to get lost in the shuffle. Of course, the words should be on par with the music in an album like this. Nicky Wire, though he may never live down the ""replacement frontman"" designation, is fairly well spoken, even at his most vehement. Most of his projectile bile is directed at America (""The Devil's Playground,"" as it's referred to in ""Baby Elian""). While there are moments of clarity, as in the near-narrative anti-McCarthy recountings of Paul Robeson's political activism, most of the invective comes buried under layers of imagery and allusion. Again, however, it's not buried too deep. While the references can get a bit dense (""Little Guernica"" contains the line ""Alfred J. Prufrock would be proud of me,"" which might dip a bit too deeply into the Modernist well), it's usually not too difficult to figure out what he's getting at. Even though, in a song like ""The Convalescent,"" I'm not sure what ""Brian Warner has a sweet little ass"" signifies, the Luddite message comes across in the chorus: ""DNA means do not accept."" The album's final song, ""Freedom of Speech Won't Feed My Child,"" gives the Manic's benediction in its eponymous chorus, a warning against complacency, self-righteousness, and lax activism. As a statement for the entire album, this works fairly well-- it's provocative, well done, but not quite focused enough to take the listener anywhere in particular. So, the world's fucked up, and these guys can write pretty good songs about it. What am I supposed to do? Like, what about that Bush girl? 'Cause man, she's fucked up.","THE STATE OF THE WORLD

Mokoondi,Mice Parade,by: Mark Richardson,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c451eb335119a49ed909/1:1/w_160/77e17abd.gif,2001-03-14 06:01:40,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5257-mokoondi/,Bubble CoreBubble Core,"My job requires a certain amount of attentiveness in addition to time spent talking on the telephone. Though I have a CD player in my computer, I haven't been able to find any music that's good for my environment. Everything was either too dynamic, and hence interfered with my concentration, or too quiet, and got lost in the ambient noise of the office. So I just listen to records I've memorized in my head-- things like The Wild, the Innocent, and the E Street Shuffle, Straight Outta Compton, and Bad Timing. This Mice Parade album solved that little problem. For good or ill, Mokoondi walks the razor's edge between too engaging and not engaging enough. The dynamic range is minimal. The sounds-- mostly acoustic guitar, Chinese harp, vibraphone and drums, with the occasional violin, saxophone and Moog accompaniment-- are universally pretty. And they're arranged in a way that's variable, without changing so much so as to be distracting. It's the perfect music for getting something done. Things like, oh, I don't know, writing record reviews. My first pass through Mokoondi was uneventful. It's tough to hear instrumental rock music with prominent vibraphones and not think of the ""t"" word. That's right, ""thrombosis,"" the medical condition that consists of a blood clot forming near the heart cavity. I get a thrombosis every time I hear music that reminds me too much of Tortoise, a band I currently find boring. But after a few listens, this record does so much more than Tortoise has for me in a long while. For one thing, Adam Pierce (who, in addition to running the fine Bubble Core label and being a member of the Dylan Group, is Mice Parade) doesn't even attempt to make ""songs"" on this record. These pieces are best described as ""patterns."" There's barely a chord change on Mokoondi. Perhaps inspired by the beautiful sound of the cheng (that's a Chinese harp), Pierce constructs pieces that evolve horizontally, and have more to do with addition and subtraction than linear movement. So ""Pursuant to the Vibe,"" the only real nod to dub (not surprising, since parts of it were recorded live with HiM), consists of nothing more than a hip-hop beat, droning clouds of vibes, and an acoustic guitar playing about five notes over and over. Amazing how such simple elements, deployed on a track that has no real melody or chords, can yield something so tuneful and satisfying. About that cheng-- I have to admit that the tracks featuring this ""exotic"" instrument (well, not so exotic to the half of the world that lives in Asia) are my favorites. ""Circle 1"" is just cheng and violin, playing a hypnotic pattern with some uncredited vocalizing in the background. Considering how beautiful this track is, it's far too short at just under three minutes. Pierce uses the cheng on ""Ramda's Focus"" to interact with dulcimer, guitar, and his most inspired drumming on the record. He plays just about everything on Mokoondi, but Pierce can really throw on the drums, and when he starts double-timing about halfway through, it's breathtaking. Probably due to the instrumentation, this song reminds me of Macha's first record, though I find it much more organic in the way it combines the geographically varied sounds. I introduced Mokoondi as background music to work to, but I've since scrutinized it in more intensive listening sessions, and it holds up rather well. It's an unassuming record that opts for sustained beauty over ""the big moment,"" so you shouldn't approach it expecting crescendos. Given what Pierce has to working with, Mokoondi borders on great. Sixty-five minutes of instrumental rock that never gets dull is an impressive accomplishment.","My job requires a certain amount of attentiveness in addition to time spent talking on the telephone.

It's practically brainwashing, isn't it? Daft Punk seem to be operating under the premise that if you hear something enough times, you'll start to believe it. But after more than 15 listens to Discovery's first single and opening track, ""One More Time,"" vocodered vocalist Romanthony doesn't have me ""feeling the need,"" much less not waiting, celebrating, and dancing so free. This could just be me, of course. Maybe I just haven't taken enough ecstasy and horse tranquilizers to appreciate the tinny, sampled brass ensemble, the too-sincere ""chill out"" midsection, or the fat drum machine beats that throb in time with my headache. Few things are more incriminating than Daft Punk's own lyrics, which, while generally deeper than ""don't stop the dancing,"" rarely go beyond sensitive junior high poetry and ""could this be love"" Whitesnake-isms. But music like this wasn't meant to be judged on its lyrics. And since Discovery relies heavily on the French neo-disco stylings established by 1997's Homework, the duo would probably suggest we shut up and dance. In truth, Discovery rarely invokes its predecessor's slap-bass funk, and few other tracks resemble the obviously single-designed ""One More Time."" Instead, Daft Punk focus on fusing mid-80's Kool and the Gang R&B; beats with post-millennial prog flourishes and more vocoders than you can shake at Herbie Hancock. Of the six tracks that feature vocals, four are smothered with the synthesized pitch corrector. On tracks like ""Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger,"" the duo make it work by pushing the instrument to its breaking point, squeezing out subhuman glips and merging the vocals into a Vai-style synth-guitar solo. But when the band relies on the tool merely as a gimmick, as on ""Digital Love"" and ""Something about Us,"" the sentimental love songs come off with all the heart-melting earnestness of Kid Rock's ""Only God Knows Why."" Daft Punk typically succeed in an instrumental environment, though. Discovery's first big score comes with the rousing ""Crescendolls."" The obscure Imperials sample makes the song with spirited ""hey's"" and ""everybody y'all's"" yelled out from a crowd. ""Superheroes,"" which draws its repeated refrain from a late 70's Barry Manilow track called ""Who's Been Sleeping in My Bed,"" sates with a massive, fist-pumping kickdrum, complex chord changes, and light-speed keyboard bleeps. The snapping percussion and Phantasy Star II phaser synths of ""Verdis Quo"" recall a somber Flashdance-era Giorgio Moroder. And the 16-bit pitch-bent tones and Klymaxx electro-bass of ""Short Circuit"" would have felt at home on Trans Am's Surrender to the Night. Prog and disco have never openly begged for their own hybrid, but the genres' newborn Frankenbaby is alive, whether we like it or not. Still, this beast, however grotesque, is relatively harmless-- rather than running amok in the village and snapping the necks of civilians, it only wants to ""celebrate and dance so free, one more time.""

Onsumothasheeat,Carl Craig,by: Paul Cooper,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6969d034d5c69bf358c/1:1/w_160/8de86f46.gif,2001-03-13 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1654-onsumothasheeat/,Shadow,"Founder of the Detroit Festival of Electronic Music and formerly the mack daddy of techno, Carl Craig, has answered the siren call of inevitability and has released a mix album on Shadow As longtime readers of Pitchfork will recognize, we're only too happy to pour scorn on sad-sack labels, and few have had sad-sackier pasts than Shadow. Actually, Cleopatra have long worn the sad-sack crown, but Vitamin's foisting of The Electronic Tribute to Radiohead rivals even that label's madcap ventures into digitally stored effluent. These stultifying acts of barbarism have pushed Shadow well into the sphere of the acceptable. As does Carl Craig's mix album. Despite the apparent handicap of having the Shadow roster to pull from, Craig makes Onsumothasheeat an enjoyable study in future funk and electro-jazz. Sometimes we don't even notice that he's dropping in some of his own label's material. The Shadow tracks he mixes showcase the adventurous A&R; policy the label has been adhering to. Indeed, the reason for Shadow's recent sweet perfume is their willingness to license underground tunes from boutique labels. Chief amongst these is Jamie Odell's Freerange label, a compilation of which Shadow recently released under the title Scrambled. Craig takes a couple of scoops from the Freerange catalog, beginning Onsumothasheeat with ""Wild Light"" by Jamie Odell's alter ego, Jimpster. Between LB's (aka Atom Heart) datacore versions of James Brown's ""Superbad"" and Prince's ""The Future,"" Craig slides the psychedelic soul-jazz of Marasma's ""I Have Got Garlic Hanging on My Front Door"" and Goo's giddy deck-cutting ""The O.G."" Craig's sequencing skills and innate musicality ensure that what sounds jarring on paper flows more plausibly than an Internet gay porn rumor about Tom Cruise. The second half of Onsumothasheeat takes a beatfreakier route-- Reginald Craig's ""Second Wind"" is jacking techno hijacked by instrumentally violent daycare infants, whose frenzy slips into the cello-baiting and vibes-thrashing Japanese jazz of Shinju Gumi's ""Hide and Seek."" Then follows the definitive Detroit dub'n'drum'n'bass'n'Joe Zainwul jazz concoction, ""Landscaping"" (it's tougher than Craig's own ""Bug in the Bassbin""). The track lulls us with its subdued skronk until the pills kick in and we're careening around, our synapses zapped in a battery of rimshots, echoed sub-bass, and flashbacking vibes washes. Nothing could follow ""Landscaping,"" but Shadow's flat-footed Droid sure try. Their contribution, ""Poly Bell,"" was snipped from their NYC D-N-B album. The juxtaposition confirms what I already knew from subjecting myself to their record: Droid's Hot Pockets variant on Jon Hassell's treated trumpet and Grooverider's beats plain sucks! Hey! I don't care if the sweeping ambitronics and pedestrian I-think-this-is-what-a-Robbie Shakespeare-bassline-sounds-like are all performed live. So's me laying a turd. And that, my friends, also ain't worth recording. So after Droid embarrass themselves for seven minutes, Craig gives us the three minutes of Sneakster's Ethan Allen electro-dub track, ""Twisted,"" to settle ourselves before concluding with Marasma's fusion phantasmagoria, ""The Bed and the Window."" By virtue of Craig's precise selecting skills, Onsumothasheeat desultorily skips over the big-room clichés that far too many DJs mix into their discs-- no ""exclusive"" (read: previously rejected) remixes of Moby's ""Porcelain""; no grand-standing anthems to distract you. Though he does toss in a couple of sub-par tracks, on balance Craig deserves loony praise, since Onsumothasheeat divines unsuspected depth and artistry within vague recesses of the Shadow.","Founder of the Detroit Festival of Electronic Music and formerly the mack\n\ daddy of techno, Carl Craig, has answered ...

Up the Country,Sixth Great Lake,by: Ryan Kearney,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a4399d034d5c69bf2ffb/1:1/w_160/dbb61fff.gif,2001-03-13 06:00:00,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7213-up-the-country/,KindercoreKindercore,"I can't possibly count how many times I've pissed in Lake Champlain. Not that I can count how times I've canoed or sailed on its surface, both praying for and fearing a sighting of its mythic, Loch Ness-ish beast, Old Champ. But every time I think of the eight consecutive summers I spent at a camp on its shoreline, I think of myself swimming naked in its frigid waters at 6:30 in the morning with dozens of other naked little boys, most of us leaving behind conspicuous pockets of warm piss. This memory may sound crude to some of you, but to me it's among the purest, most innocent moments of a childhood long since passed. The feeling is perhaps better described in the title track of the Sixth Great Lake's Up in the Country: ""We haven't got a care in the world except for each other and the ground we walk upon""-- or, in this case, the lake we swam upon. While this connection might seem dubious at best, I should also mention that Lake Champlain is unofficially-- and officially, according to Senate Bill 927-- the sixth Great Lake. Fittingly enough, this five-member band, which includes Jeff Baron, Chris Ziter and Sasha Bell of the Essex Green, recorded the basic tracks of the album in a house overlooking Lake Champlain. While the Sixth Great Lake gain plenty of inspiration from Lake Champlain, they're also clearly indebted to the country leanings of The Band. For evidence, one need look no further than the cover itself, which resembles The Band's eponymous second album. But if you're not convinced, then I should also mention the Sixth Great Lake's excellent cover of The Band's ""Rockin' Chair""-- yes, from that aforementioned album-- which approximates The Band's unique male harmonizing without forfeiting a character all its own. But, as the Sixth Great Lake prove with fourteen other tracks, they don't need to cover The Band to make great music. The sublime opener, ""Duck Pond,"" features beautifully understated keyboards and perfectly balanced male/female vocals during the chorus. ""Across the Northern Border"" follows, supplanting lead male vocals with lead female vocals. With its bongos and nimble acoustic guitarwork, the track pulls you forward from the laid-back position demanded by ""Duck Pond."" The soft strumming and harmonica of the title track then knocks you out of your Adirondack chair and all the way back to 1968-- albeit more the 1968 of Music from Big Pink than that of The Graduate. Throughout Up the Country, there are hints of other musicians. The opening of ""Last in Line"" recalls Johnny Cash's ""I Walk the Line."" ""The Ballad of a Sometimes Traveller"" translates Dylan's ""I Shall Be Released"" into the third person. And the flute-inflected ""Cannon Beach"" suggests that the Sixth Great Lake and Belle and Sebastian share a taste for Donovan. But this album is first and foremost an homage to The Band-- the kind that pays its respects by not only emulating the sound, but by bringing it into a whole new light. Like any good camp memory, there's little here to find fault with. Sure, things sometimes become a little too airy, or reflective, or reclined, or soft-edged. But that's what you'd expect from an album as temporally displaced as this one. While too many bands, including the Essex Green, are rehashing psychedelic 60's pop, the Sixth Great Lake have resurrected of an oft-forgotten sound of the decade. Yes, there were the dirty mud pits of Woodstock, New York. But not too far from there was Lake Champlain, with its crisp, unbroken surface, just waiting for someone to piss in it.","I can't possibly count how many times I've pissed in Lake Champlain.

God Bless the Blake Babies,Blake Babies,by: Dan Kilian,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a2fe9d034d5c69bf2d0a/1:1/w_160/c182d74e.gif,2001-03-06 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/789-god-bless-the-blake-babies/,ZoeRounderZoeRounder,"""What I wouldn't do: Go back to '92...""
Hatfield/Strohm from ""Disappear"" As steam-fired pistons power the magnetic oscillator and the clocks run backward, we don't have to wonder why Juliana Hatfield is returning to this pivotal moment in history. It's not to undo the breakup of her old band, the Blake Babies. Hell, going solo did wonders for her career. No, she's going back in time to nix a bad boyfriend and make him ""Disappear."" Sure, back in the future, the Blake Babies are reuniting for a one-album project. But all that really matters is boy trouble. In the late 80's and early 90's, the Blake Babies emerged from the Boston underground to release some post-punk pop that earned them good reviews and album sales. The band featured the breathy Hatfield, a young bassist with an appealing girlish hitch in her voice. The music was catchy and charming, if unexceptional in the long run. Of course, like so many bands, the Blake Babies didn't have a long run. Hatfield went solo and became an MTV darling, hitting the same market that bought Letters to Cleo records. The two other Babies, guitarist John Strohm and drummer Freda Boner (aka Freda Love, and now, Freda Love Smith), formed Antenna, then Velo-Deluxe and the Mysteries of Life. Now the trio is back with another album of somewhat charming and unexceptional tunes. How come? Obviously, their schedules were all open. It's clear in the music, which features the passion and inspiration that can only stem from having nothing better to do. It's tempting to see the reunited Blake Babies as just another repackaging of Juliana Hatfield, who, along with performing solo, has also fronted the Juliana Hatfield Three and Juliana's Pony. The songwriting credits on God Bless attempt disprove this notion, but if Strohm and Smith truly collaborated on the record, I'm in the dark as to why it sounds so much like Become What You Are. This may be an unfair assumption, since Hatfield has always dominated the band, but with the other members on autopilot, there's very little to distinguish this record from recent Hatfield solo outings. What's more, the Blake Babies spend themselves early on. After the catchy boy basher, ""Disappear,"" ""Nothing Ever Happens"" kicks in with guitars that sound less like grinding rocks than cellophane being crinkled. Still, the song displays a pop flamboyance that works in the band's favor. The standout, a cover of the Madder Rose b-side ""Baby Gets High,"" uses chord plucking similar to the Troggs' ""Love is All Around"" to underscore a weary acceptance of a loved one's debauchery, which from Hatfield sounds like a confession. Nothing happening and drugs are revisited themes on this album, as is faking it in a song, which they unfortunately address twice, on ""Civil War"" (""When you don't have anything to say you can make it up"") and ""On"" (""I never did you wrong/ But it makes a better song""). The band could use better subjects, and for creative purposes, if not their health, a cleaner lifestyle. Or at least better drugs. The fourth track, ""Waiting for Heaven"" is the album's prettiest. It shows how just a couple perfectly chosen notes can create a transcendent moment. When Hatfield skips up to her higher register to sing, ""I'm on a wave coming down from a beautiful face,"" that ""I'm on a wave"" is a surgical insertion of heaven. Unfortunately, the rest of the album lies in limbo between midtempo pop and mediocre balladry, and as such, Hatfield's breathy words evaporate into the ether. What I'm trying to say is, the needle on the quality meter never jumps above ""pretty good."" Guitarist John Strohm penned a couple of competent numbers to sing. He seems obsessed with blissful love and optics on both ""Picture Perfect"" and ""Invisible World."" Even former Lemonhead Evan Dando (interesting music trivia: the Lemonheads were once huge! No one knows why! It's speculated that the ""alterna-hunk"" constituent factored heavily) gets to sing an obligatory duet with his former lover, Juliana. Long ago, at the peak of their affair, their chemistry was undeniable; ten years later, their voices are a horrible mismatch, like butterflies and tennis balls trying to fly together. The magnetic oscillator slows and stops. The clocks start spinning the right way again. We are back in the present. An old boyfriend has been murdered, and an old band reunited. How will these changes affect history? The Blake Babies step through the clouds of steam with wondering expressions on their faces, only to find that the space-time continuum has corrected their every move. It's as if the entire journey never happened.","""What I wouldn't do: Go back to '92...""

Musipal,Wagon Christ,by: Spencer Owen,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a9b5ea9e61561daa5aa9/1:1/w_160/5f9b79b8.gif,2001-03-06 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8555-musipal/,Ninja TuneNinja Tune,"""Now the premise of this album is very, very simple. What's that? To listen to messages of soul with a solid beat, make you move your feet. Now the premise of the album is to find a passing spaceship and get rescued by it. Oh, come on. Now the premise of this album is, well, the dance, actually, dance business. The highest definition ever achieved in recording. I'll even tell you what two of the secret ingredients are: pure electronic modern electronics. That'll make 'em happy! Oh, look at 'em, they want to get up and dance! Let's have a party, we gonna go swinging! I'm gon' fuck the whole world up! Hahahaha, I'm so full of ideas, and here's a good one!"" If that were a quotation from one person, you might well think that they were a raving lunatic or schizophrenic. ""Those,"" you would probably say, ""are the ravings of a lunatic schizophrenic!"" Well, the above quotation can be found in ""The Premise,"" the slick introductory track on Wagon Christ's fourth album, Musipal. And although it's culled from all sorts of different sampled spoken voices, it feels as if it's been transferred from the personal schizo thoughts of mastermind Luke Vibert to his flexible fingers. I can't vouch for his sanity or any lack thereof, but the man is pretty full of ideas, and I'll be goddamned if the ones found on Musipal aren't good ones. Vibert hasn't created an incredibly innovative record, by any means. References can be made from the smooth and dirty grooves of DJ Shadow and UNKLE to the jungle agitation of Squarepusher to full-on dementia, either giddy (Kid Koala) or sinister (Aphex Twin). But Musipal is so stocked with variety and, moreover, actual fleshed-out substance, that it manages to bypass the simple ""wacky"" status of Vibert's previous release as Wagon Christ, 1998's Tally Ho! This record has moods-- some unnerving, some smooth, dark, mechanical, choppy, bouncy, funky, soulful, and even back to wacky, occasionally, all whenever Vibert sees fit. And each of these elements help create the perfected Wagon Christ formula: an unpredictable mixed bag that comes out even, regardless of how many contents are shifted. Musipal has more than a couple standout tracks, but out of those, its holy trinity comes during its first half. ""Natural Suction"" is Vibert's only full-on journey into jungle and drum 'n' bass beats this time out, and pad synths and strings complement the jittery grooves nicely. The title track follows, flowing modestly and effortlessly with the inclusion of a shuffling hip-hop beat, squawking horns, and a duet of bluesy lead guitar and whistling. Up to this point, Musipal would be perfect for your next social occasion. That is, until the unsettling and dark beats of ""It is Always Now, All of It is Now"" come in. Despite it being the album's obvious highlight, it's probably a bit too paranoid for the houseguests. Dark synths and orchestra hits punch through the ranting of a madman-- possibly Vibert himself-- whispering and mumbling through a distortion filter and squealing feedback. There are plenty of flavors for anyone on Musipal, although the record as a whole may be too diverse for some, if that's possible. In my book, diversity is a plus. If there's one thing Luke Vibert can do well, it's everything at once. He seems to mock himself by starting his album with a track called ""The Premise"" and then never fully being able to explain it. It may be that he'll never decide on a certain premise, or idea, or concept; consequently, he'll probably never cover the same ground quite the same way twice. And the schizophrenia and variance that is Wagon Christ has finally controlled itself just enough to avoid sounding piecemeal. Musipal is, as of now, the quintessential Wagon Christ record, and its only preconceived purpose is one of simply letting you have fun while trying your damnedest to find one.","""Now the premise of this album is very, very simple.

Quiet is the New Loud,Kings of Convenience,by: Rich Juzwiak,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bbac5e6ef95969322c7b/1:1/w_160/41a01580.gif,2001-03-06 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4448-quiet-is-the-new-loud/,AstralwerksSourceAstralwerksSource,"There's a delicate balance to be achieved by men who are to be considered ""good guys"" by the female species. The nice guy is a sort of once-removed son, plagued by an acute insight into society-- a society that allows just enough room for him to be ""sensitive."" Of course, if boundaries are overstepped even slightly, say by a penchant for Oprah Winfrey or gardening, a ""nice guy"" runs the risk of societal emasculation, being called the worst of epithets: a pussy. Misguided attempts at DuBoisian theory aside, I often find myself in such a bind, unsure if a love for Jeanette Winterson's outrageously flowery prose is indeed offset by Milan Kundera's slightly spacier, though equally ornate writing. (Intuition tells me it doesn't.) Regardless, being in this semi-fragile, self-important state, I'm completely honest when I say there's no mistaking the Norwegian duo Kings of Convenience as two gigantic pussies. I realize that this isn't kosher and that I'm adhering to unfair and ultimately oppressive constructs of gender roles. That doesn't change the fact that the Kings are the pansiest musicians this side of James Taylor. The duo, Erlend Øye and Eirik Glambek Bøe, revel in their softness. The musical framework they adopt is a sparse brand of acoustic folk more akin to the work of Nick Drake than just about anyone of the myriad artists to which Drake is compared. And if there's a curious novelty to listening to a release on Source/Astralwerks bereft of electronic tinkering, it wears off before the first listen ends. The formula of acoustic arpeggios, light drumming, tender pianos, and the occasional subtle horn or string section makes for an album that's as slight and gentle as Saltines and mineral water. The boys never deviate from this, and thus Quiet is the New Loud, inane title and all, never reaches higher than saccharine easy listening. With midtempo breezes like ""Winning a Battle, Losing the War,"" and ""Little Kids,"" these innocuous sweetie-pies floss their knack for penning delicate, pretty songs. Of course, wispiness can't be beaten off for long when lines like, ""Even though I'll never need her/ Even though she's only giving me pain/ I'll be on my knees to feed her/ Spend a day to make her smile again,"" come a-sucking. The lyrics here are pitiable to the degree of laughter, and far more likely to encourage hysterics than introspection. Quiet is the New Loud, as with any record, has its highlights. ""Singing Softly to Me"" and ""The Girl from Back Then"" are parts one and two of the same song, and both sport a slinky, blue-eyed jazz sound akin to Van Morrison's Moondance. ""Summer on the Westhill"" is notable if only for its vocal melody which bears intense similarity to Klymaxx's ""Meeting in the Ladies Room."" Whether or not this was intentional is anyone's guess, but hearing echoes of an '80s disco-cheese anthem cushioned in wistful folk music makes for a nearly fascinating dynamic. Though equally somber and flighty, Erlend and Eirik wisely keep the vocal melodrama to a minimum; the only instance of intentionally affected singing comes during ""The Weight of My Words,"" when Erlend repeatedly belts, ""The weight of my words/ You can't feel it anymore."" It's a rare agonizing moment that illustrates just how Herculean an effort listening to Norwegian nancy boys whimper testiculessly can be. It's important to note the inclusion of simultaneous guitars, played by both members, as well as almost uniformly sung vocals. Erlend and Eirik spend the bulk of the album in unison, when they're not harmonizing. The set-up reminds us of another folk duo, this time of the American persuasion: the Indigo Girls. As if it were even a question, Quiet is the New Loud gives strong indication that if the duos were to come to blows (hopefully, over what constitutes ""true"" folk music), Amy Ray and Emily would kick some major Scandinavian ass.","There's a delicate balance to be achieved by men who are to be considered\n\ ""good guys"" by the ...

Sunny Border Blue,Kristin Hersh,by: John Dark,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c0c2abf31b7dc71564f5/1:1/w_160/f1579262.gif,2001-03-06 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3839-sunny-border-blue/,Beggars4ADBeggars4AD,"Kristin Hersh has been a great many things: the snakecharmer, the Queen Mum of indie rock, Vic Chesnutt's biggest supporter, and fan-friendly (to a fault). But I like to think of her as a veteran major league pitcher-- though she may slump and streak, she still keeps up the high baseline output that justifies contracts the size of Denmark's gross national product. You get what you pay for, and Hersh is always a bargain. Sunny Border Blue-- god, is it really her fourth solo full-length already?-- lacks both the expansive, electronic band-backed arrangements of Sky Motel and the too-sparse skeletal sound of Strange Angels. Here, horns, organ, piano and ambient vinyl noise dress up Hersh's guitar-vox-barstool aesthetic nicely and efficiently. Little else is required. No electric rockers to bring down the house. Alas, poor Muses, we knew them well. Like anyone who spends too much time in the studio over the years, Hersh has logged enough hours tinkering with other instruments to arrive at the point where she can proudly add that liner note to the effect that ""all instruments [were] played by"" you-know-who. Diminutive, but mom-tough, Hersh casually cusses her way through a baker's dozen songs that are as personal as ever, and far less cryptic than in the past. Her voice remains creaky and pregnant with emotion, matched against her signature bright-toned Collings guitars. ""White Suckers"" is representative of this slight reinvention of solo Hersh. Moving from the plodding and fingerpicked verses, the song metamorphasizes with a trumpet player (Kristin?!) shifting into uptempo gear for a California-dreamin' chorus sporting fractured words like: ""You come off like a distant moth, aimless and driven."" The once-a-disc ""'Gazebo Tree' moment"" comes early in the album, this time with the sublime ""Spain,"" a hissing crescendo of organ, melody and vowels. The innocuous opening slowly seethes into a classic Kristin barrage, belting out lines like: ""Sucking down mother's milk/ Singing my throat away/ It's not an awful secret, you know/ It's just a secret."" A moving cover of Cat Stevens' ""Trouble"" is a welcome curveball, prompting a little more campfire-style swaying and head-bobbing in the audience than normal (i.e. none). ""Ruby,"" the album's highlight, has an accessible pop elegance. Uplifting, oscillating ooh's lounge amid major key chordal melodies and equestrian drumming. Lyrics shine white-hot with a burning-magnesium bright light: ""This baby's like a winter bird/ Raunchy and sweet/ With snowflakes melting in his hair/ The boys are supermen wondering..."" Hersh's reputation and strength-- being off-kilter lyricwise and left-field musicwise-- almost feels like a nephew of a song rather than a child of her own. Ah, but there's a saving grace bridge that affords us a few moments of familiar University-ish unpredictability. The few faults of Sunny Border Blue occur during the rare songs when Hersh goes on autopilot. Put the thumbscrews to me and I'd admit that ""Summer Salt"" sounds like so much filler. ""Candyland"" feels non-specific to the record and could have appeared innocuously on any of her solo efforts without seeming invasive. But in the long view, such sniping seems pretty lame when taken in the context of the disc's assets, which are nearly every song. At this point in her Methuselan career, Hersh has no one left to surpass but herself. That can be challenging enough, given her tendency to meet and exceed expectations with alarming regularity. Anyone familiar with her entire corpus gets the sense that she'd have to work a hell of a lot harder to put out a bad album than a good one. The world is jealous.","Kristin Hersh has been a great many things: the snakecharmer, the Queen Mum of indie rock, Vic Chesnutt's biggest ...

Dog in the Sand,Frank Black & the Catholics,by: D.

In the process, he morphed into a true road warrior, endlessly crisscrossing the barrooms and honky-tonks of America, carving out a niche, and turning out a live-to-two-track album every year or so. His last two full-lengths with The Catholics were reasonably well-crafted and invigorating, though it's hard not to miss the wild creativity of the Pixies or his early solo work. By now, though, even Frank may be chafing at the limitations of their bar-band sound, staunch as he is in refusing to do overdubs or even edits in the recording process. Fortunately, there are just enough tweaks to that process this time out to enliven the resulting album, making it his most diverse and listenable since Teenager of the Year. The most notable change on this record is the induction of his former producer and keyboardist, Eric Drew Feldman, to The Catholics, a veteran of Captain Beefheart's Magic Band and Pere Ubu. His contribution mainly consists of tasteful grand piano and Hammond organ, though the odd Rhodes piano or synth flourish crops up now and then. Fellow Magic Band alumnus Moris Tepper and ex-Pixie Joey Santiago also turn up to play guitar on the record. The result is that Frank gets to flesh out his songs with an expanded sonic palette. And while neither as polished as his self-titled debut or as sonically diverse as its follow-up, Dog in the Sand adds a much-needed freshness to the proceedings. Producer Nick Vincent keeps everything crisp and tidy, with as many as eight people playing on any given track. Dog in the Sand plays as a true classicist rock 'n' roll album, without resorting to cliches or sounding reactionary. The main reference point seems to be Exile on Main Street-era Stones and early Bowie, and all the tracks share a rootsy feel, accented by Rich Gilbert's frequent use of a pedal steel guitar. Luckily, there are enough stylistic flourishes to keep things interesting. The opener, ""Blast Off"", begins like your typical slow-paced Catholics track before shifting into Black's most peppy and angular riff in years. His lyrical genius makes appearances, too, with lines like, ""I'm in a Beckett trance from all the chemicals."" Still, the track drags on just a bit too long, making one regret that no edits were allowed. ""I've Seen Your Picture"" magnifies the Rolling Stones influence; when Black pronounces ""away"" in the chorus as ""uh-waayy-yeee,"" he's a dead ringer for Mick. ""Robert Onion"", which features Joey Santiago on guitar, comes the closest to the good ol' Boston post-punk, though it sounds more like Mission of Burma than his former band. And the irrepressibly hooky ""If It Takes All Night"" demonstrates exactly the kind of purity and spirit that one might hope to capture in a live environment. Frank Black indulges his obsession with obscure bits of California and Los Angeles history in his ode to California's first Socialist collective on ""Llano del Rio"", as well as the excellent ""St. Francis Dam Disaster"", which recounts an early 20th century incident that resulted in a wall of water cascading 53 miles across the California countryside to the sea. On the latter, Black counts down the miles as the water devastates thousands, and Feldman's piano work gives it a tragic feel. Often, though, Black's lyrics remain willfully obscure, as Frank eats dictionaries for breakfast. Black has made comments recently that indicate he doesn't consider the Catholics his ""permanent"" backing band. Though this record is hardly a sonic breakthrough, at no point does it sound exactly like anything he's done before. It's refreshing if only because he hasn't allowed himself to become stuck in a rut, and because it dispels the feeling that he might have been growing complacent. Though there's no denying his most groundbreaking days are probably over, it's nice to know that his future still promises to be anything but predictable.

The little girl clutches her palms to her ears and wears an inscrutable expression that vacillates from pouty to fearful to verge-of-tears, depending on what mental angle you hold it at. Or she could just be pressing hard on earphones concealed beneath her baby tresses, trying to soak up every bit of this album. Azure Ray resides on the new Warm label, also home to Eric Bachmann's Crooked Fingers output. Bachmann produced their self-titled debut, and his prints are all over it. Like Crooked Fingers, Azure Ray relies heavily on emotional theatrics-- a sort of southern gothic ambience-- and submersion under miles of murky mood. The project pairs Orenda Fink, a veteran of Japancakes, Little Red Rocket, and Bright Eyes, with a fellow Bright Eyes and Little Red Rocket member Maria Taylor. Faux-cult figurehead Brian Causey (of the Causey Way and Man or Astro-Man) is also credited with production and some guest musician spots. Of course, it's hardly original. Azure Ray is extremely pretty, soft, easy-on-the-tympanum pop music built around acoustic guitar strumming. If you were silly enough to try to delineate an 'indie music aesthetic,' this would fall many city blocks outside of it. No fuzz, no feedback, no indigestible chords, and all with polished production and solid arrangements. Lap steel guitar, cello, violin, church bells, piano, brass, and tape loops all make appearances on these eleven tracks. The meat of these songs-- if something as pretty as Fink and Taylor's singing can support such a metaphor-- is, of course, the duo's vocals. Their gentle trills manage a good balance between ethereal and corporeal, like an apparition you could touch. It's a great mix between a haunting, somnambulant femininity and understated strength. Sort of Linda Ronstadt, in a way. What's that they say about how women are stronger then men because they can withstand the pain of childbirth? The first three songs are the album's strongest. ""Sleep"" features a gorgeous vocal line, some backwards guitar, and nice piano accompaniment; the whispered, minor-chord melody and background noises of ""Don't Make a Sound"" drown you in atmosphere. ""Displaced,"" though, comes away the obvious winner, with a suspiciously familiar melody. So familiar, in fact, that I wouldn't be surprised if they'd stolen it. Not that I'd care, personally, being relatively certain that whoever they'd stolen it from couldn't do it one-tenth as nice. Again, what can you say except that the singing is haunting and the melody exquisite? It's the platonic ideal of a lullaby. The eight songs that follow definitely have their moments, even if the contrast is noticeable. ""Another Week"" layers ghostly, effect-laden singing over slowed-down Western saloon piano music. It's audio sepia-- not terribly provocative but pleasurable nonetheless. ""Rise,"" meanwhile, could be an epiphany scene anthem for a John Hughes movie, if he were still making teen flicks. Indie label-ghetto obscurity will keep this from attaining massive popularity. But an indie-ghetto habitué such as your self shouldn't have any trouble digging up a copy of this. If maudlin but beautiful, expertly crafted pop songs keep a room in your heart's hotel (under an assumed name, naturally), get with it. You friggin' wuss, you.","Maudlin at its best.

Bring on the Snakes,Crooked Fingers,by: Nick Mirov,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6a99d034d5c69bf35bd/1:1/w_160/a4005f1b.gif,2001-02-28 06:00:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1672-bring-on-the-snakes/,Touch and GoWarm,"How long should an artist wait between full-length releases? Should prolificacy be an unconditionally celebrated trait, or should some consideration be paid to audience fatigue? I don't have any hard statistics on this, but I'd guess that the average wait between any two full-length releases is about a year and a half. It's a long enough period of time to allow one album's hype to grow and fade out, and give the fans a bit of a breather before having something new foisted on them. It's also probably beneficial to the artist, since it gives them some time to fully develop ideas and visions for the next album. I mention this because Bring on the Snakes has come along only thirteen months after the release of Crooked Fingers' eponymous debut, which has yet to leave my stereo's heavy rotation. And regardless of a desire to be fair toward it, the album still feels like afterbirth of its predecessor, a shrugged-shouldered sophomore slump. Eric Bachmann, the main creative force behind Crooked Fingers, has a proven track record of continuing musical experimentation; as part of the Archers of Loaf and Barry Black, he attempted to develop a different facet of his sound on each album. He certainly wasn't always successful, but there's something to be said for the effort. The first Crooked Fingers album, an outgrowth of Barry Black's expanded arrangements, combined with further refinements of Bachmann's curmudgeonly lyrical outlook, was just varied enough to avoid criticism of being repetitive. But Bachmann was clearly treading on thin ice, and with Bring on the Snakes, he falls right through. The saving grace of Crooked Fingers was the small group of friends Bachmann assembled for recording, who provided much-needed instrumental variation between songs. On Bring on the Snakes, however, Bachmann goes it alone, sticking with a steady stream of fingerpicked guitar, droning tones, and sparse percussion. Less interesting arrangements combined with less focused lyrics turn the album into one long, generic Crooked Fingers track, laying bare the slightness of Bachmann's songwriting formula. To be fair, there are some minor differences between the two Crooked Fingers albums, but they're far outweighed by the similarities. ""The Rotting Strip"" clatters along with Magnetic Fields-like toy-synth noise, and near-optimistic lyrics, a first for Bachmann: ""[We] crossed our hearts half-hoping/ That we could both quit smoking/ And kick the booze and blow/ And one day go make something of ourselves."" His characters-- usually broken-down, self-destructive drunks haunted by devils and lost in crowds of strangers-- have started to think that there may be a way out of their hopeless lives after all; but it's really only a minor development that gets folded into the larger lyrical picture, which is still rife with decay and decimation to the point of tedium. So while Bachmann's lyrical ideas and melodies creep forward ever so slightly, the only thing to take solace in is the occasional odd atmospheric noise or unintentional musical reference. The fingerpicking on ""Devil's Train"" strongly recalls Jim O'Rourke's Bad Timing; ""Doctors of Deliverance"" is propelled by an oddly clean electronic pulse; and the title track features the subtle ticking of a clock, or perhaps the clip-clop of a horse's hooves, to keep time. When it comes down to it, though, Bring on the Snakes remains Eric Bachmann's first album that doesn't exhibit a significant musical development. Had more time been allotted to experiment with other techniques, or even to just develop the songs, it's conceivable that something better might have come out of it. I guess we'll never know.","How long should an artist wait between full-length releases? Should prolificacy be an unconditionally celebrated trait, or should some consideration ...

Complete B-Sides,Pixies,by: Ryan Kearney,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a08a5e6ef9596931ff92/1:1/w_160/72a63861.gif,2001-02-28 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6316-complete-b-sides/,4AD,"This review was as good as written ten years ago, since by then, all of these songs had already entered the short canon of music memorized by my adolescent mind. As I acquired every new piece of Pixies material, I saw songs by other bands expunged from my cramped brain. As I absorbed ""In Heaven"", Big Black's ""The Model"" all but disappeared; ""Into the White"" burst in, Dinosaur Jr's ""Freak Scene"" ran screaming. I distinctly remember R.E.M.'s ""The One I Love"" getting the boot from, of all songs, ""Winterlong"". And these are just the b-sides. I think it goes without saying that the Pixies' b-sides don't make for an average, run-of-the-mill outtakes compilation, as many of the songs are almost or equally as radiant as the more fortunate tracks that made it to the five classics between 1987 and 1991. And if nothing else, this release proves that, like Dylan in the 60s and Brian Eno in the 70s, the Pixies were the blinding visionaries of the 80s. Virtually everything they touched was groundbreaking and revelatory, leaving one to wish they could only have touched more. Although Complete B-Sides isn't actually totally complete, leaving out live versions of ""Planet of Sound"" and ""Tame"" from an alternate ""Alec Eiffel"" single, everything else is here: 19 tracks, amounting to 48 minutes of music. The disc also features classic videos of ""Here Comes Your Man"" and ""Allison"" (though the wind-tunneled ""Alec Eiffel"" is curiously absent), as well as enlightening, albeit short liner notes for each song. And because 4AD is an intelligent label, Complete B-Sides is sequenced chronologically. The tracklist is exactly what you'd get if you burned the singles for ""Gigantic"", ""Monkey Gone to Heaven"", ""Here Comes Your Man"", ""Velouria"", ""Dig for Fire"", ""Planet of Sound"", and ""Alec Eiffel"" to CDR, in that exact order, minus the album track that opens each disc. An alternate take of Surfer Rosa's ""River Euphrates"" opens the record with nearly a minute of Joey Santiago's guitar antics, as well as a dynamic ending which replaces the fade-out of the original. ""Vamos"", which appeared on both Come on Pilgrim and Surfer Rosa, was always a live favorite and usually their set closer: between lead singer Black Francis' yelping and Santiago's brutal guitar torturing, this live version is as explosive as they come. But Complete B-Sides truly takes off with one of the best under-two-minute songs ever: a live cover of ""In Heaven (Lady in the Radiator Song)"" from David Lynch's Eraserhead. Often their encore, the song grows gradually louder and louder, ending with one of the band's most cathartic moments on record. The disc moves from Surfer Rosa-era to Doolittle with ""Manta Ray"", a classic Pixies head-bobber boasting Mexican-style guitar strumming and quick, two-note drumming. ""Weird at My School"", as Black accurately notes, spotlight the ""hyperness"" that defined so much of the Pixies' work. ""Dancing the Manta Ray"", meanwhile, shows the band's surf-rock tendencies, as does the sublime ""Wave of Mutilation (UK Surf)"". ""Into the White"" follows with a killer bassline and Kim Deal's breathy vocals; the perfect balance of tension and release, and one of the real standouts here. The Doolittle era concludes with ""Bailey's Walk"", one of the Pixies' slowest and weirdest songs, featuring Black Francis in fractured and tortured yowls. The Bossanova b-sides open with drummer David Lovering's tepid ode to Debbie Gibson, ""Make Believe"", followed by Deal's beautiful cover of Neil Young's ""I've Been Waiting for You"". After ""The Thing"" (essentially an outtake from a section of ""The Happening""), we're offered a driving instrumental Frank Black wrote at 15. And the era's rounded out by another gorgeous Neil Young cover (""Winterlong"") and ""Santo"", another slow, chanty number straight out of a bar scene in El Paso, 1864. ""Theme from 'Narc'"", the first track from the Trompe le Monde years, is just that-- a cover of the theme song from the ""Narc"" video game. It's another adrenaline-pumping instrumental, displaying the raw, interstellar quality that characterized Trompe le Monde. ""Build High"" works as a kind of south-of-the-border space-jam, and on the Spanish-sung Graham Gouldman cover, ""Evil Hearted You""-- as with the instrumental version of ""Letter to Memphis"", which closes the record-- the guitar mimics the lyrics so well you can almost hear the ghost of Black Francis departing. When I bought this album the other day, wearing my Pixies shirt by coincidence (I swear!), the shave-headed girl behind the counter said, ""Nice shirt. I love the Pixies."" I told her that I already owned all these songs, but just had to buy the album, anyway. ""Oh, really,"" she said cautiously, as though there were something pathetic about that. ""Maybe there is,"" I later thought to myself. But then I looked at my tattered Pixies shirt, so beaten and worn it was practically falling off my body, and I thought otherwise. Like the music itself, which remains as vital and exciting as it was upon the day of its release, I'll never let this shirt go.

Live in Chicago,The Apples in Stereo,by: Spencer Owen,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a0dc13d19756521384c4/1:1/w_160/60f4ee7c.gif,2001-02-28 06:00:03,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/253-live-in-chicago/,eMusic,"Here's my quandary with live albums: the prototypical one selects live favorites-- sometimes from one show, sometimes from multiple shows-- along with a couple of obscure numbers, and one or two covers in the middle to give it the appearance of having more diversity than your garden-variety singles collection. So what's a reviewer to do? He can't grade the songwriting; that's already been done. Basically, a reviewer judges your traditional live record based on gaps. For instance: what gaps are filled that might have been missing in the original recording? What gaps have been created by thrusting the song into a more primitive live setting? I mean, bands can easily be made to sound like competent musicians thanks to recording software, but it's harder to manipulate that stuff for live albums, which often reveals the gaps in a band's abilities. Of course, bands don't generally decide to pick one of their off nights to release as a live album. And yes, there's the gap between studio quality recordings and live recordings, whether it be crisp and vital, or muddy and dull. The Apples in Stereo are new to the live album game. Not like I'm surprised-- it's never seemed like a necessity for these studio-oriented kids. Available as an MP3-only release through eMusic, Live in Chicago is a prototypical live affair that feels somehow dissimilar from the rest. It sounds like an audience member's well-made DAT recording. It emanates authenticity and innocence, like a band proudly and generously offering a tape of their first good gig. ""You can actually hear the vocals very well over the noise,"" says leadman and Elephant 6 deity Robert Schneider. ""This is the first time one of our live recordings accomplished this."" Rarely has an indie icon sounded so earnest. Still, it's time to judge the gaps. First off, on these eight Apples originals and one Beach Boys cover, Schneider and the band sound like they're having a blast, and the energy is instantly detectable. You can sense it in moments like when Schneider breaks into jubilant faux-Van Morrison shouting at the end of ""Ruby"", originally from 1999's Her Wallpaper Reverie. Or when the band crashes into the hyper-jam guitar solo instrumental bridge on ""Go"", off last year's The Discovery of a World Inside the Moone. It's hard to help imagining how much better it all would have sounded if you'd been there. But you take what you can get. As for what's missing in arrangements and/or production, the Apples usually compensate. On ""Dots 1, 2, 3"", the Apples' most driving and least characteristic track to date (culled from their 1995 landmark Fun Trick Noisemaker), the noisy electronic opener of the original is well interpreted with simple stuttering guitars. And in the case of ""Go"", they compensate by not compensating: the horn section and heavy drums on the studio version had always been the extra weight that pushed the song over the line from fun to annoying; with this live version, the band sounds nimble and spontaneous, unfettered by such distractions. And then there's their take on the Beach Boys's ""Heroes and Villains"". Unfortunately, the straightforward Apples treatment doesn't really translate effectively to tape, even if it would have been a pleasant surprise in person. Still, the gaps between Smile-era Beach Boys and Robert Schneider are large, to say the very least that could possibly be said. But they get points for covering an honest-to-god great song, and their effective segue from the lost Wilson-penned classic into one of their finest tracks, the melancholy ""Get There Fine"", off 1997's Tone Soul Evolution. Live in Chicago has the charm of a well-recorded audience bootleg sanctioned by the group on one of their best nights. It falls flat at times, but rarely; the energy of pretending to be in the audience watching Schneider and his bandmates jam through a few well-crafted pop tunes just can't be denied. Enough gaps are even filled to warrant a recommendation. And as the reviewer, I must say, as prototypical live albums go, it turned out to be relatively painless. So there.","Here's my quandary with live albums: the prototypical one selects live favorites-- sometimes from one show, sometimes from multiple ...

Ride the Skies,Lightning Bolt,by: Matt LeMay,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd0c5e6ef95969322f95/1:1/w_160/cda9f62c.gif,2001-02-28 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4787-ride-the-skies/,Load,"Ah, the bass guitar. So overlooked, so underappreciated. Look how it sits, looking so innocuous, so pure. Its warm, rich tones and angelic harmonics tell a story of innocence and chastity. But its seductive curves, its smooth metallic hardware, and its rock-hard, finely crafted neck tell another story. Oh, how it begs to be perverted! To be slapped, to be twisted, to be warped, to be forced into making terrible, alienating sounds. Lightning Bolt bassist Brian Gibson is perfectly in tune with the secret language of the bass guitar. He knows all its tricks. He knows when it says it's going to call him, and when it really is going to call him. He knows that, no matter how harmless it pretends to be, all it wants is to be fed back through a 32 bajillion-watt amplifier. Upon first listen, you may be hard pressed to believe that the squealing, searing treble tones you're hearing on Ride the Skies are indeed being produced by a bass guitar; the idea of scorching riffs being played by a bass seemed to bite the dust when Cliff Burton got squashed by his tour bus. But on Ride the Skies, Gibson makes his bass do things that would make a whore blush, resulting in some of the most distinctive tones ever to be produced from the instrument. Brian Chippendale, a drummer and vocalist who's known to impress his audiences with small feats of gymnastics between songs, rounds off the dynamic duo of Brians that is Lightning Bolt. With a style that's similarly frantic, though decidedly more conventional than his fellow Brian, Chippendale completes the musical package nicely, intensifying the furious energy that makes Ride the Skies so fucking awesome. Indeed, the palpable energy that permeates Ride the Skies is Lightning Bolt's greatest asset. Sure, this is instrumental rock, but it bears none of the sterility of a band like Don Caballero; if this is math-rock, it's math-rock made by kids who failed math. Add to this the we-don't-give-a-fuck attitude of Boredoms' propensity towards sonic exploration, and Lightning Bolt become a force to reckon with. While the band's death metal-meets-free jazz sound is maintained consistently well over the course of the record, there are a few highlights that are definitely worth mentioning. The album's opener, ""Forcefield"", begins with high-pitched, end-heavy squeals that sound like a synthesizer, or maybe a guitar being run through some heavy effects pedals. But certainly not a bass. As the song builds, the quasi-electronic bass sounds give way to terrifying blasts of pure fuzz-- a medium that Lightning Bolt manages to infuse with distilled energy, making it some of the most convincing noise ever to come out of Rhode Island. ""13 Monsters"" sees Lightning Bolt ripping apart schoolyard chants, Brian Chippendale's fractured vocals sounding like they're being screamed through a megaphone that could use a couple of fresh Duracells. On ""The Faire Folk"", Brian Gibson's bass finally sounds like a bass, at least for a little while. See, one of the great things about Ride the Skies is that you can never expect one sound to stick around for long-- the songs embody a perfect blend of spontaneity that, while often repetitive, manages to never become dull. So it seems that Lightning Bolt have managed to do what many would have deemed impossible: They've created a hard rock album centered around the bass that doesn't suck. But you know the bass always wanted it. It's been begging for it all along... secretly. It was only a matter of time before some guys named Brian would come along with open ears and fulfill its secret desire to squeal and wail at ear-shattering decibels.","Ah, the bass guitar.

The grand prize for, ahem, straddling this line, doubtless goes to the Japanese. Just tune into ""Pokémon"" or their other bizarre, anime-tinged creations for proof. Pikachu might strike you as a cute, cuddly companion, but piss him off and he'll zap your ass faster than you can drop $2000 on his limited-edition trading cards. Not that I'd know or anything. While the Japanese may lay claim to the crown for traumatizing our children by mixing the harmless with the violent and disturbing, Kindercore runs a close second. That Masters of the Hemisphere disc may have seemed like a fun-lovin' romp through innocuous twee-pop fields. But its horrid combination of bad music, bad art, and mind-bendingly illogical storytelling had many listeners in a fetal position, begging for the sweet release of death. Luckily, Kindercore is home to one band that's managed to put the blurry distinction between the darling and the disgusting to use for the powers of good, rather than evil: Of Montreal. As the sappiest, most sugary, and probably most talented group on Kindercore's roster, Kevin Barnes and company have managed to pump out some of the most sickly sweet pop music in my collection. So sweet, in fact, that it's at times bordered on terrifying-- a dizzying, disorienting sugar rush that, while probably not very good for you, leaves you wanting more. The Early Four Track Recordings is a collection of demos-- mostly recorded by a solo Kevin Barnes before Of Montreal released any official material-- with each track incorporating Dustin Hoffman into its title. It's also packaged in a jewel case that contains images of psychotic children in chains, mole-birds, and bizarre skull creatures. What the hell? Luckily, the music contained within is less alarming. In fact, The Early Four Track Recordings may very well be the least cloyingly saccharine album released under the Of Montreal moniker to date. Kevin Barnes' masterful pop songwriting is in prime form, with the occasionally overpowering sound of Of Montreal playing as a full band is replaced by a more stripped-down, acoustic feel. Songs like ""Dirty Dustin Hoffman Needs a Bath"" and ""Dustin Hoffman Thinks about Eating the Soap"" are classic Kevin Barnes: peppy, poppy, and slightly insane. ""Dustin Hoffman Quits Bathroom and Climbs a Tree"" couples a flawlessly delivered vocal melody with hypnotic backwards guitar, resulting in one of the best tracks Barnes has ever committed to tape. But given that The Early Four Track Recordings is a compilation, it comes as no surprise that it's not a particularly even album. ""Dustin Hoffman Gets a Bath"" is a bit too corny to be anything but annoying, and much of the record's midsection suffers from competent, but not particularly memorable songwriting. But while many of these tracks are less than stellar, none of the 16 Hoffman-inspired tracks ever approach being unlistenable. Sometimes lackluster songwriting aside, The Early Four Track Recordings is a must for fans anxiously awaiting the upcoming Coquelicot Asleep in the Poppies, and a perfectly good starting point for those who might find Of Montreal's over the top pop intimidating. Whereas Of Montreal's proper albums can leave you with a pounding ice cream headache, The Early Four Track Recordings gives you almost all the goodness with none of the harmful side effects.","There's a fine line between cute and terrifying.

Turn 21,The Donnas,by: John Dark,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b9f6eb335119a49ec8fe/1:1/w_160/520ada50.gif,2001-02-28 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2419-turn-21/,Lookout!,"The Donnas have always been a better gimmick than a band. When they broke onto the scene, they had all kinds of Spin-worthy selling points: they were teenage girls still in high school; they all wore the same t-shirts, emblazoned in busty 3-D with their ""Donna initials""; and they played music that was always able to be succinctly summarized as ""band x meets band y."" People fawned over the Donnas' image more than the music the girls produced-- and by all rights, they should have become bigger than they have, based on America's love affair with style-over-substance. Most people overlooked the best thing about the group, though: they successfully appropriated the sounds of the testosterone club. Not exactly like the riot grrls, who famously hijacked the attitude of boys-only punk, but in their own more invasive way. The Donnas were like geologists exploring the deepest strata of hard, heavy rock, and forcibly carved their niche out of granite-sized preconception and prejudice in that gender-imbalanced world. People-- especially music journalists-- seemed to forget that the Donnas' initial Ramones-clones sound gradually yielded in favor of 70s and 80s metal plagiarism. Each release inched them further away from the fun three-chord punk spirit that made such an initial impact. And now, with the arrival of this year's Turn 21, their fourth full-length, The Donnas have become the male nurses of American beer-fueled heavy metal, in danger of digging their own rut so deep that they won't even be able to peer over the edge, let alone ever escape it. Every song drips with bawdy attempts at sexual promiscuity. But just Vince Neil screaming ""girls, girls, girls"" and name-checking strip bars is unlikely to whip a woman into a frenzy of amour, The Donnas attempt to titillate and fail miserably. Lines like, ""You pulled me over and I pulled you in/ C'mon, officer, let's go for a spin,"" from ""Police Blitz"", and the blunt metaphor, ""Let's play ball, we don't need a court/ Just you and me, baby, full-contact sport,"" in ""Play My Game"" feature all the eroticism of The All-New Three's a Crowd with Alan Thicke. The Donnas are boring for the same reason pornography is: a boggling lack of subtlety mixed with crudeness. ""Little Boy"" is the most enjoyable track, mainly because it has more of an early Donnas sound, and because the lyrics are funny in that bad-sitcom kind of way. Evidence: ""Have you ever even tried to use a comb/ I think you might be missing a chromosome/ 'Cause you keep coming back for more."" The only other song worth a mention is the first single, ""40 Boys in 40 Nights"", which sounds like Kiss at their best (but still Kiss, y'know). Its melody dives and surfaces, and the diesel-chug of the guitars bursts into riff-as-punctuation at just the right times. The lyrics are right in line with the rest of the album: ""Spendin' every night in a different state/ Spendin' every night with a different date."" In keeping with their trend of covering a metal classic, the girls turn in a perfectly humdrum treatment of Judas Priest's ""Living after Midnight"". Without improving or reinventing it, there remains little reason to even include it, other than to give the listener a glimpse of their influences and favorites. Really, girls, there was no need to tell us-- it couldn't be more obvious. As for the rest of the disc, try not to get lost in the crowd. It would be futile to attempt identifying the low points, as each same-sounding song after song is as forgettable as it is mediocre. The biggest disappointment is that the title implied we were going to get older, wiser Donnas. For a young adult, turning 21 is a milestone; a time when their perspective on life changes, and society has no choice but to finally regard them as an adult. I may have held out a little glimmer of hope that The Donnas' Turn 21 was going to be a similar landmark turning point in their maturation as a band. But not everyone who turns 21 is the beneficiary of a sudden boost of the maturity hormone, and The Donnas are still playing some pretty juvenile rock 'n' roll.","The Donnas have always been a better gimmick than a band.

Amid confusing reports that Royal Trux have broken up, Neil has gone the route of that other early Drag City artist and released a solo album. I still haven't heard the Malkmus record, but I gather from reviews that it's similar to his work with Pavement. Neil Michael Hagerty, on the other hand, is a bit of a curveball. This record shares the Royal Trux fixation on rock history, but with looser songwriting and weirder instrumentation. And, of course, it doesn't feature Jennifer Herrema's crazed singing. I found her voice increasingly grating over the last two records, so that initially seemed a major plus. And in truth, I do enjoy this record more than Pound for Pound. Still, Herrema's vocal sneer was in some ways the soul of Royal Trux, and there does seem to be a hole in this record where her Steven Tyler-isms once existed. Maybe it's just me, but Hagerty seems a little lonely. He's playing every instrument; he's singing and writing every song-- the only person he's interacting with is himself. Royal Trux, at their best, always got mileage out of the image of partners in love doing it their way. But now I'm getting into the circumstances surrounding this record, as if they mattered. What counts is the music. And the music sounds like the demo tape for the Grateful Dead's Aoxomoxoa, with better songwriting and worse sound quality. Seriously, for a guy that owns his own studio and frequently collects checks as a producer, Hagerty has made some bizarre sonic choices on this one. The drum machine and bass are way down in the mix; a deliciously cheesy organ (just like Pigpen used to play!) is way out front, and nearly every track is about one-third guitar solo. The songs are short, though, so that's not as bad as it sounds. And while not technically one of the better guitarists in music today, the guy can still make it howl like Allen Ginsberg in a wind tunnel. The harmonized guitar and organ parts on ""I Found a Stranger"" are a drone-lover's wet dream; when Hagerty bursts into his soulman falsetto around the three-minute mark, the contrast is divine. The tunes these guitar solos hang on are 100% pure Americana, but filtered through a guy who's clearly removed from any sense of ""authenticity."" That is, Hagerty can sing a good folk tune like ""Repeat the Sound of Joy,"" even though he doesn't sound like he's spent any time in the country. (And this despite living in rural Virginia!) This quality is what makes the Stones' Exile on Main Street such a great record. Both ""Whiplash in Park"" and ""Fortune and Fear"" thrive on classic rock riffs of the Allman Brothers kind, and ""Creature Catcher"" sounds like, I don't know, Canned Heat.

The Blue Trees EP,Gorky's Zygotic Mynci,by: Rich Juzwiak,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bf79abf31b7dc71562f9/1:1/w_160/59a3f66f.gif,2001-02-20 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3529-the-blue-trees-ep/,Beggars,"Though they dabbled with softer, folky material on 1999's Spanish Dance Troupe, Gorky's Zygotic Mynci are essentially a pop band whose accessible style has manifested as a more cerebral and elegant facet of Britpop. The idea of the ever-jangly Myncis generating a record comprised almost entirely of acoustic instruments and rootsy tunes isn't exactly jaw-dropping; before The Blue Trees it seemed about as likely as Ida recording a record with balls. Even so, if their new EP is to be considered shocking, it has little to do with the surface aesthetics, and much more to do with how accomplished it is. Gracefully sliding the genre into the acousto-folk realm results in a record that will be widely considered as Gorky's foray into ""maturity."" Such a claim, though, superficially tends to degrade what's actually going on-- a grown-up record full of pretension and seeped in hebetude is not what Gorky's are offering. Rather, it's an accomplished 24 minutes that are as wise and adroit as they are delightful. If some of the band's past melodies have come off a bit oversweet, they make up for it in spades with The Blue Trees. Though the EP is undeniably candied, Gorky's turn down the tone knob to ""understated,"" and avoid sounding cloying. The shimmery instrumental title track opens the record with a gently picked guitar. The song's instrumentation is like a sonic capillary with a piano, fiddle, and another guitar joining in one at a time, until they swell to a dense climax. ""Wrong Turnings"" is another sublime instrumental that benefits from a similar dynamic, though is further bolstered by drastic tempo changes. What could have been merely a languid, pretty composition is made gorgeously unpredictable by what paradoxically feel like uncontrived musical twists. What's most impressive, though, is that The Blue Trees remains effortlessly sincere. Euros Childs' wispy, affectation-free vocals are undeniably suited for the subtle nature of the material. He's got the kind of voice that can make lyrics like, ""We slept underneath the stars/ And we talked about girls seen from afar/ What's her name?/ I don't know/ How do I get to know?"" over a ""Rosewood Casket"" melody, sound completely believable, if not heartfelt. ""Face Like the Summer"" is a similarly winsome tune that could have been perfect campfire sing-along fare, had it been played on the guitar instead of Childs' keyboard. This is no gripe, though-- Gorky's turn up the melancholy just enough to achieve poignancy, but swiftly avoid maudlin indulgence. Childs' aw-shucks approach to lines like, ""So young in years/ Probably end in tears/ But I somehow don't mind,"" endow the song all the more endearing. Slight deviations from the quiet acoustic on a few tracks, though, makes for shakier business. ""Foot and Mouth '68"" is the low point, a mournful instrumental with an ambient keyboard foundation. The song is perhaps too meandering for its own good, and seems out of place on a release so succinct and cohesive. Their Honeybus cover, ""Fresher Than the Sweetness in Water,"" is slightly more poppy and psychedelic than the rest of the songs on The Blue Trees, but far more successful than ""Foot."" Though drums make one of two cameos during the EP in this cover, a fiddle helps countrify the track and ensures integration. The folk sound of The Blue Trees comes at the expense of Gorky's signature fun. Still, when a record is this coherent in its abandonment of previously established conventions by its creators, a sense of festivity is barely missed. With their neo-psycho-prog-pop abandoned, Gorky's Zygotic Mynci have created a work that is an illustration in the beauty in risk-taking by a band that's apparently more deft than they've been letting on for over a decade. Fluke or not, The Blue Trees proves how unjust it's been to have Gorky's playing second fiddles to that other Welsh band, Super Furry Animals. Finally, Gorky's are playing their own.","Though they dabbled with softer, folky material on 1999's Spanish Dance Troupe, Gorky's Zygotic Mynci are essentially a ...

Girls Can Tell,Spoon,by: Nick Mirov,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a51cc0084474cd0c064e/1:1/w_160/24022098.jpg,2001-02-20 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7429-girls-can-tell/,Merge,"Over the past week I've scrapped several quasi-amusing, only-tangentially-related-to-the-topic-at-hand anecdotes that would have served as some sort of introduction to this review. Among them: a tedious explanation about how what I'm learning in grad school about connectionism and neural networking somehow applies to Spoon's songwriting methodology (hint: it really doesn't); a comparison of Spoon to the ugly metallic monstrosities that pass for public sculpture these days; and a tired parody of VH1's ""Behind the Music"" (""Spoon: They had it all. And then it all came crashing down! But now they're back! Etc.""). I ran out of clever metaphors to describe Spoon's music a while ago. In fact, I don't think I've ever really captured in writing what it is about Spoon that I like so much. Their music just seems to possess this attitude that's both fresh and rooted in the origins of rock 'n' roll, an anger that's at once stylish and direct, a compassionate ache that's as oblique as it is palpable. And Girls Can Tell wraps all that is great about Spoon up in a shiny new package. It's been nearly three years since Spoon's last album, A Series of Sneaks, rocked heads and broke hearts, and even though the band was without a label for most of that time, they forged ahead with the writing and recording of Girls Can Tell anyway. They had more than enough time to get the album sounding just right, and it definitely shows in the finished product. But an open-ended recording schedule has its advantages and disadvantages: Girls Can Tell is more mature and accomplished, but at the expense of the spark of spontaneity. Fans of Spoon's mannered sloppiness will most likely be taken aback at their new sound, one which is significantly spookier and cleaner-sounding, with more conventionally structured songs. It may be worth noting that John Croslin, who's produced most of Spoon's output to date and may be responsible for the more off-kilter ideas on previous albums, is barely present on this album. Where A Series of Sneaks was a giddy grab bag of intentional loose ends, Girls Can Tell ties those loose ends up, perhaps a bit too neatly. The irony, of course, is that this album sounds much more like a major-label release than Sneaks. But the ""maturing"" of Spoon should by no means be a point of contention. No, they no longer sound like the Pixies, Gang of Four or Wire; instead, they sound like Spoon now. And initially, Girls Can Tell sort of feels like a recap of Spoon's brightest spots within their oeuvre, recast in a new light. ""Believing is Art"" uses the insistent eighth-note rhythm of ""30 Gallon Tank""; ""Lines in the Suit"" recalls the stark living-room production of the ""Agony of Laffitte"" single; ""Fitted Shirt"" starts where the one-note riff of ""Mountain to Sound"" left off; ""Anything You Want"" hums with the easy melodic brilliance of ""I Could See the Dude,"" or ""Metal Detektor,"" or ""Plastic Mylar."" The one new addition to their sound is a foggy-midnight moodiness enhanced by mellotron, vibraphone and viola on tracks like ""Everything Hits at Once"" and ""Chicago at Night""; still, this shift in sound was presaged by ""Change My Life"" off the recent Love Ways EP. But any perceived straddling of the line between self-cannibalization and self-reference is rendered moot on subsequent listens; these songs not only stand strong on their own, but also complement each other in unexpected ways. The eerie tones floating throughout ""Everything Hits at Once"" drift into ""Believing is Art,"" where martial rhythms, Britt Daniel's breathless stuttering, and even the jarring fuzz riffs that tear apart the chorus do nothing but build tension until it fades into nothingness. The tension is finally broken with the ringing chords that open ""Me and the Bean."" ""Lines in the Suit"" offers the first solid indication of development within Daniel's lyrics; whereas they were once resolutely abstract and liberally peppered with odd turns of phrase, here, they point toward concrete emotions and situations. Written during the fallout from being dumped from their former label, it's the sound of Britt sitting on his couch, strumming his guitar, staring out the window and wondering, ""How come I feel so washed up/ At such a tender age now?"" Daniel may regret some of the decisions he's made in life, but so does everyone else; eventually, he comes around to remembering that while being a rock musician may still be a job, it's still better than real work. Better that than the human resource clerk on her lunch break who says, ""It could have been good by now/ It could have been more than a wage."" ""Fitted Shirt,"" the most recognizably Spoon-like song on the album, concerns itself with a considerably lighter subject; namely, how Britt wishes that shirts didn't always come in one-size-fits-all proportions. Of course, there are also songs on Girls Can Tell that are just about, well, girls. And hanging out. And telling off record labels. On the heartbreakingly pretty ""Anything You Want,"" Britt pines for the girl that he knows full well won't work out anyway; on ""Take a Walk,"" he lashes out with a snarling, swaggering blues riff as he spits, ""Now that song's been sung/ It's just the cost of what's been done/ The cost of talking a walk with you."" ""1020 AM"" returns to the mooning about, with elegant acoustic guitar and flutelike organ imparting an almost chamber-music-like aura. ""Take the Fifth"" has nothing better to do than to strut down the strip on a Saturday night, handclaps and tambourine included. Girls Can Tell slithers to a rather downbeat conclusion with ""This Book is a Movie,"" a rather incidental instrumental number that wants to build tension as effectively as ""Believing is Art,"" but doesn't quite get there; and ""Chicago at Night,"" where the desolate guitar twang seems to dissolve into a cloud of smoke. It's an ending that seems to echo the uncertainty of Spoon's existence over the last few years, as if the continuation of the band is still somehow in question. While Spoon definitely shows signs of life on this album, it's also clear that their more negative experiences have changed them irrevocably. It's not necessarily a qualitatively good or bad change, it's just change. Digging deeper into Girls Can Tell, I get the feeling that Spoon is trying to reconcile their distinctive tics with deeper traditions of rock. They've always seemed like an indie rock band with a rock 'n' roll soul, and here, they're trying to lose some of their outward quirkiness and just be a rock band. But they'll never sound like just another rock band; some of their peculiarities are so engrained in their sound that they stick out even more here: the deceptively simple-sounding drum patterns, the combinations of succinct riffs that somehow miraculously fit together just so, and of course, Britt Daniel's voice, which if were up to me would be ranked as one of the classic voices in rock. It's a great thing, hearing a band grow up without losing sight of what made them so vital in the first place; and seeing as how Girls Can Tell might not have ever seen the light of day, it makes it even better. It's worth cherishing.","

Complete Recordings,LiLiPUT,by: Sam Eccleston,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a0d45e6ef95969320046/1:1/w_160/66d11180.gif,2001-02-20 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4791-complete-recordings/,Kill Rock StarsKill Rock Stars,"Liliput have been part of post-punk's vast cultural myth since its inception. Who could resist a passel of Swiss kids with a jones for punk rock and outfits made of newspaper? Their work is as tart, wry, political, thoughtful and exciting as anything to come out of that scene. At least, so we were told. The band's output has been out of print for at least a decade, and, although authorities across the cultural landscape have sold the band as the lost grail of the punk rock scene, anyone seeking to hear their music had to content themselves with occasional used-record finds and the stories related by others. The concern that accompanies a reissue like this is, once stripped of the mysteries of history and unquestioned praise, how does the band sound? After all, encomiums by Greil Marcus carry all the weight in the world when nobody can listen to the records and say differently. What's more, how kind will history be to a bunch of Swiss kids prone to outbursts of unrestrained gibberish and clattery squall? Plenty kind, as it turns out. Liliput, known in less copyright-concerned territories as Kleenex, sound very much of a piece with contemporaries like Gang of Four and Wire, minus those bands' dour miens. The lumbering, funk-with-a-Ph.D-in-gender-studies basslines that spot most records of this ilk are in full effect here, and guitarist/singer Marlene Marder declaims in that bored-but-purposeful vocal style Rough Trade fans lap up like milk. The lyric themes du jour center around social issues in miniature. Here, dates, love, and even grocery shopping all take on unconsidered political ramifications. Anyone wondering why this lavish, two-disc collection of everything the band ever put to tape was issued through Kill Rock Stars will have their doubts addressed in short order. After all, the political, aesthetically adventurous punk roster the Olympia-based label was built on seems directly descended from Liliput's family tree. The nascent beginnings of the Sleater-Kinney/Bikini Kill/Huggy Bear DNA-chain can be heard here in luminous clarity. What separates Liliput from the pack, as has been noted elsewhere, is their giddy sense of Dada humor. The instrumentation on many of these songs has to be heard to be believed, overstuffed with the rattles of kitschy percussion, the ping of triangles, the hooting of clearly new-to-the-owner horns. ""Hitch-Hike"" features hysterically incompetent saxophone accompaniment, with the song's hook played on an urgent-sounding traffic whistle. ""When the Cat's Away"" prefigures the deceptive innocence of twee-pop by backing up its tale of contemporary anxiety with an awkward sounding-polka and outlandish kissing sounds. Adding to the good humor of the proceedings, Liliput's patented flair for gibberish-- different languages, babble, speaking in imaginary tongues-- pours out everywhere. Take the aptly-titled ""Outburst,"" where deadpan verses alternate with a chorus composed of glottal grunts and occasional, high-pitched birdcalls. Though the band's late-period penchant for dubby-sounding rhythm tracks doesn't serve them as well as their earlier punkish urgency, ""Umamm"" generates menace and charm purely through quiet, wordless growls. Liliput sound so excited to be saying anything that even pure, human-generated noise is expression enough. Which is probably where this band connect with the Kill Rock Stars' present-day celebs. Like the best post-punk, Liliput celebrate the right rock gives to say anything, expressing their keen, not-humorless intellects through voices and music alike. Their influence can be heard throughout the riot-grrl Diaspora of modern times, but Liliput managed one crucial difference: they made radical social and aesthetic re-engineering sound like the greatest party you've ever been to in your life.","Liliput have been part of post-punk's vast cultural myth since its inception.

The Sleepy Strange,Japancakes,by: Matt LeMay,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b9c913d197565213af2b/1:1/w_160/b2b34850.gif,2001-02-13 06:01:40,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4205-the-sleepy-strange/,KindercoreKindercore,"Up until a few hours ago, I'd never really seen a downside to caffeine addiction. Since the beginning of the 7th grade, cup after cup of piping-hot coffee has allowed me to pull all-nighters while retaining a moderate degree of awareness, maintain a degree of sociability at late-night events, and overcome general lethargy in nearly all cases. So, I figured, what better way to prep myself up for the new release from the Japancakes than a coffee binge? After all, I was certainly expecting the record to be dull-- perhaps a few hundred milligrams of sweet, sweet caffeine would make it go by faster. A good three to four heaping cups of brown gold later, I set about listening to The Sleepy Strange, ready to take in whatever the band had lined up for me. I wasn't expecting much, though-- their recent EP, Down the Elements proved once and for all that when your goal boils down to being as boring as possible, success equals failure. But I was willing to give the group a chance. After all, the idea of a ""subtle jam music"" is at least slightly intriguing. Combining this with the fact that I'd just consumed a large quantity of coffee, I was even-- dare I say-- optimistic? Within the opening ten seconds of The Sleepy Strange, however, all the awful memories of Down the Elements, which had been conveniently crammed into my subconscious, came pouring back. And there still were 49 minutes ahead. For the lucky individuals who have never heard Japancakes, let me offer a brief synopsis: Basically, the band grew out of an impromptu, unrehearsed jam session in which ""mistakes"" became ""melody."" Apparently, though, none of the band members are particularly prone to mistakes; my greatest gripe with Japancakes is that there's no discernible melody at all. This isn't necessarily a bad thing. I listen to plenty of music which could be called ""non-melodic."" But the ultimate failure of Japancakes is that their music just begs for a melody. I mean, repetitive instrumentals can be excellent if crammed with enough variety to keep you guessing, or even with just enough subtlety to keep you entranced. But Japancakes have none of those qualities. They do, however, have what sounds like a lap steel, and they're not afraid to use it. The awkward, faux-twang does add a more organic feel to an album suffering from cheap, synthesized quasi-melodies, but even that winds up being bogged down in the drony crap stew that is The Sleepy Strange. While it is by no means a good album, The Sleepy Strange is a small step up from its brain atrophy-inducing predecessor. On the album's closer, ""Vinyl Fever,"" the band almost attains a tight, Tortoise-esque instrumental groove. But after over 40 minutes of boredom and frustration, odds are the album will most likely be occupying a precious spot in your septic tank before you get there. Another cautionary warning: never, ever listen to Japancakes when you're hopped up on coffee or other stimulants. As this album went on, the caffeinated blood running through my veins began to boil in anticipation of something, anything interesting to happen. After just a few songs, I was felt a bit like a fox caught in a trap, ready to gnaw my own ears off if I could. Luckily, I avoided the severe neck trauma of attempted ear-biting, and just turned off the album. After about an hour of relaxation, with intermittent listens to Max Tundra's Some Best Friend You Turned Out to Be to remind me just how exhilarating music can be, I gave the album a few more listens. And while I no longer found myself fighting off self-destructive urges, The Sleepy Strange was still every bit as frustrating and monotonous. Once again, Japancakes have lived up to their name: as accessible as Japan, and flat as a pancake.","Up until a few hours ago, I'd never really seen a downside to caffeine addiction.

Live,Luna,by: Michael Sandlin,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a0ecb1335d7bf1698121/1:1/w_160/09cb38e7.jpg,2001-02-06 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4916-live/,Arena RockArena Rock,"Most great bands know when to break up. The Beatles, the Sex Pistols, the Velvet Underground, the Replacements, Television, the Stooges, and Eddie and the Cruisers all acknowledged their own death knells and instinctively grasped when to pack it in. Of course, we all know what happens to the bands that linger on in the face of old age: these human relics become live nostalgia acts sharing double bills with Dylan's kids, or hobbling into the studio every two years leaking geezer-drool like Pop, Voodoo Lounge and Two Against Nature. Then again, there are always more demented geriatric tendencies: inexplicably befriending Burt Bacharach, hiring underfunded symphony orchestras, or even teaching adult education courses such as ""How to Make It in the Rock Biz."" Sadly, Luna seems like just another once-great, now-aging band enduring a slow disintegration, and thus sorely in need of the proverbial ""bitter break-up."" After being dropped by Elektra subsequent to 1997's non-million selling Pup Tent, they've been floating in artistic limbo without even a permanent label to call home. Original drummer Stanley Demeski is long gone, as is bassist Justin Harwood. Dean Wareham is trying his hand at acting. Sean Eden has a side project called the Weeds of Eden. And unfortunately, Luna live shows are simply not as thrilling as they once were. Besides, Dean just isn't all that funny anymore. Where's all the witty between-song chatter? Is it really enough to say, ""Thanks!"" and ""Are you guys French?"" Not to mention that the band's cover of the iconic 80's white-trash anthem, ""Sweet Child O' Mine,"" only retains its knee-slapping Ivy League irony for one listen, if that. In the mid-90's just after the release of the critically lauded Penthouse, Luna were at their peak, both as a live unit and studio band. After having spent years on the road opening for everyone from the briefly reunited Velvet Underground to the Cocteau Twins, Wareham and Eden's inspired guitar synergy began to achieve a surprising intensity in concert. In fact, the band often achieved a rare quality musicologists often refer to as ""rocking."" Lately, Luna's been touring incessantly without writing much new material. I guess they figured, hey, why not play live in support of a live album? Logical. So, Luna released this no-big-deal live affair on the Brooklyn-based Arena Rock Records, as a partial justification of their continued existence as semi-functional band. Sadly, the album is a few years too late in coming. As an example, the guys, while opening for Lou Reed sometime back in 1996, pulled off an amazing rendition of the Velvets' ""Ride into the Sun"" with Reed and Wareham handling the vocals together. Where were all the tape recorders back then? On Live, Dean sings with a tired and less charming sort of ""let's get this over with"" detachment. Sean Eden's guitar lacks the creative spark it once had, as he now plays second-fiddle to Wareham as a soloist-- although Eden does manage to gets away with rambling Tom Verlaine mimicry during the endless guitar break in ""23 Minutes in Brussels."" Oddly though, Wareham seems to be in top form as a lead guitarist. He turns in some great scratch-acid wah-wah playing and other effects-enhanced psychedelic fuzz-outs. The understated lines on ""Tiger Lily,"" and the loose, extended workouts on ""Friendly Advice"" channel the ghost of Sterling Morrison. He even gives a little history lesson to Luna fans with a rare Galaxie 500 live cut, ""4th of July."" But-- speaking of friendly advice-- you might want to do yourself a favor and ignore the newer songs included here: ""Hello Little One,"" and ""4000 Days."" They only serve to suggest that Wareham will probably never write another ""Slash Your Tires."" New bassist Britta Phillips doesn't play with the authority that Justin Harwood did, but she's easier to look at. And hearing her speak French during the band's sexy cover of Serge Gainsbourg's ""Bonnie and Clyde"" just may be the only known aural cure for erectile dysfunction. Still, don't expect some stratospheric Live at Leeds-evoking performance. Then again, Live isn't as dismal a live affair as many of the historic failed live albums of the last thirty years: the Stones' criminal Flashpoint, the notorious 1971 Chicago IV recorded at Carnegie Hall, and 1976's Wings over America. So, if you're already in the habit of buying Luna albums, may as well add this to your collection. If you reside in Greenland or Antarctica, and don't get to see the band play much, Live is adequately representative of what the band sounds like onstage in front of an animate audience. I guess it's at least worth pinching from your local multimedia megamart.","Most great bands know when to break up.

Loop-finding-jazz-records,Jan Jelinek,by: Mark Richardson,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b9e4c0084474cd0c26f5/1:1/w_160/308ce8c6.gif,2001-02-06 06:00:01,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4234-loop-finding-jazz-records/,~scape~scape,"A mold used in casting needs to be the precise spatial opposite of the desired object. If you want a piece of iron that looks like a human foot, you need a mold with empty space shaped like a human foot. It's obvious-- as the material is cast, matter becomes space and space becomes matter. This image comes to mind as I listen to Jan Jelinek's Loop-finding-jazz-records; this album is like hearing the mold used to cast proper pop. It's a perfect inversion of conventional music, a sonic negative. Everything that would typically be foreground is moved back or pushed off the screen altogether, and the flecks of sonic debris that would normally be covered by other sounds are left to carry the melody and rhythm. These thoughts came to me the first time I heard ""Do Dekor,"" which I would swear is the negative image used to imprint the ""AFX Fast Mix"" of Seefeel's ""Time to Find Me."" The rhythm is just as relentless (and nearly identical, beat-wise), but Jelinek's percussion of choice is not drums or even a drum machine, but tiny rips of static pasted into place. Taking the same idea even further is ""Them, Their"" which uses a single microscopic click as a substitute for a snare drum, as the full bass outlines a funky rhythm a half tick from hip-hop, and dreamy out-of-tune keyboards seem lifted from some distant memory. It's so computerized it hurts. And yes, it's fucking gorgeous. The title here is meaningless, a joke coming from a guy who named a track on one of his records (under his Farben alias) ""Live at the Hollywood Bowl."" Some of the noises here may well have been sourced from jazz records, but you'd never know it. Besides, the palette here is similar to Jelinek's last album as Gramm, even though the goals are quite different. Gramm's personal_rock (which you should definitely check out if this record interests you) was more intent on exploring Jelinek's microsound ideas in the context of 4/4 dance rhythms-- something Loop-finding-jazz-records only touches on with ""Rock in the Video Age"" and ""Tendency."" With these tracks, Jelinek works territory similar to Wolfgang Voight's Gas project, anchoring his amorphous textures with the familiar house groove. The bulk of Loop-finding-jazz-records is given over to a more idiosyncratic pulse, which sheds more light on what Jelinek is doing with his peculiar mixing ideas. That Jelinek would create his deep anti-pop for Stefan Betke's ~scape label makes sense, as Pole is definitely the most apparent reference point. Though his ideas are similar to a degree, Jelinek has far surpassed Betke in terms of expressiveness. Among the current spate of glitch artists, Germany's Jelinek designs his tracks with an ear for emotion. Part of this comes from the textures he chooses, which veer toward the liquid and organic, and part of it has to do with the manner in which Jelinek operates. The natural inclination with music this minute and detailed is to pay very close attention to the individual sounds, and a palpable intimacy emerges from the listener's proximity. Call me what you will, but I find this album to be incredibly sensual. It's like lying naked in a bed of freshly washed flannel sheets, rolling back and forth, feeling massaged by every strand of cotton. This is the real digital love, baby.","A mold used in casting needs to be the precise spatial opposite of the desired object. If you want a ...

Mission Accomplished EP,Tricky,by: Spencer Owen,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a80cea9e61561daa571a/1:1/w_160/42486789.gif,2001-02-06 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8154-mission-accomplished-ep/,EpitaphAnti-,"When I saw Tricky on ""Sessions at West 54th"" about four years ago, his performance intrigued me. I watched him hunch over his mic and breathe his raspy, smoke-stained vocals. His vocal partner in crime Martina Topley Bird crooned seductively, and his band rhapsodized his unique take on trip-hop. I watched astounded, enveloped by the layers of sound emanating from my small television speakers. I immediately scrambled to pick up Maxinquaye, his 1995 debut. It soon became one of my all-time favorites. Maxinquaye was a strong, cohesive, brilliant, unpaved road of a record, filled with clattering, arrhythmic beats, haunting vocal interplay, and a dark and dismal atmosphere that still gives me goosebumps with every listen. In 1998, I got a copy of Angels with Dirty Faces during my internship at a now-defunct alternative radio station here in Los Angeles. While not as groundbreaking as Maxinquaye, it was certainly more focused than 1996's somewhat scattershot Pre-Millennium Tension. Far from a let-down, the album left me hope for the future of Tricky's musical landscape. But 1999's Juxtapose was a significant step down. While probably worthwhile record for those that prefer Tricky's hip-hop material, it seemed largely inessential for a fan of his more creative output. Even at its best, Juxtapose played like straightforward rap/hip-hop incorporating a more watered-down Angels backdrop and uninspired rhymes. It didn't help that Martina, such an essential element in Tricky's earlier, better work, was nowhere to be found on the album. I hoped this would only be a brief, Pre-Millennium-style detour. Fortunately, I was half right. But only half. I was optimistic that his new EP could signal a return to the creativity of Maxinquaye, or at least to that of Angels with Dirty Faces. The four-song Mission Accomplished EP, however, took this naive assumption of mine, threw it to the ground, and kicked it with steel-toed boots while shouting degrading insults at it. As exaggerated as I may sound right now, I need only describe the unoriginality of the record's opening title track to back my claims. Tricky utilizes (read: rips off) the main riff of the Mission: Impossible theme-- a song which has already been retooled to fit 4/4 rock/pop formats at least twice on a mainstream level over the past four years-- and retools it to fit a 4/4 rock/pop format. He then whispers nearly unintelligibly along with this for just over three minutes. Some of the vocals make cliches out of his past work (he even says ""brand new, retro,"" as in ""Brand New You're Retro"" from Maxinquaye), though the majority simply consists of a repetition of the chorus of Peter Gabriel's ""Big Time."" Word for word, note for note. And with no hope for relief until it finally and mercifully ends. The next two tracks feature rapper Lynx, who rhymes about, well, probably sex, and some other things I can't possibly make out through his abominable, incoherent stylings. And to continue Tricky's newfound tradition of carbon-copying the already prosaic and mundane, he even reuses one of the drum loops from ""Mission Accomplished"" as the primary beat for ""Crazy Claws."" The only track out of the bunch worth half a listen-- at best-- is ""Divine Comedy,"" an alternate version of ""Money Greedy,"" one of Angels with Dirty Faces' strongest tracks. Here, Tricky and his cohorts endlessly rip on his former record company, repeating ""Polygram!/ Fucking niggers..."" quite a few times. This may or may not seem amusing initially; either way, it quickly becomes pointless and monotonous. I've listened to this EP twice; that's once more than I would have ever liked to have heard it, give or take one listen. Mission Accomplished nearly destroys all hopes I once held for Tricky's future. I could dream about the next Maxinquaye, or even the next Angels. But sadly, my hopeful, innocent wishes have already been beaten senseless.

Lost Souls,Doves,by: Sam Eccleston,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ba01c0084474cd0c2738/1:1/w_160/780dd43b.gif,2001-01-31 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2429-lost-souls/,Astralwerks,"You know, we music journalists have to contend with a myriad of internal voices while reviewing. There's the simple, straightforward, credulous voice of the listener, who takes bands, songs and packages at face value. As a counter check, there's a savvier, hipper voice that considers music a constructed, made-up thing, sold to us by bands and manufacturers through advertising, press buzz and the ever-enticing promise of press photos. And, finally, there's a purely contrarian voice that plays devil's advocate, finding the easy path and countering it at every turn. This kind of intrapersonal debating occurs with every release, but rages almost uncontrollably in the instance of a talked-up offering. Because in such a case, it becomes so important to keep oneself from being swept up in embarrassing critical groundswell without dismissing a record that might be good just because someone else likes it. Case in point: Doves' * Lost Souls * , an album currently coasting on tons of buzz. Follow us as we take a look at three different approaches to reviewing the record, while revealing the secret tricks of the reviewer's game: __ * Step One: Snappy, Superficial Introduction * __ __ Straightforward: __ While, in the United States, electronic music is considered a new, arty, futuristic medium, it's been a part of the European palette for years. While Underworld seem spacy and abstract on these shores, they're a legit commercial force for our friends across the sea. What's more, techno's such a known quantity across the Atlantic that it's become strictly pro forma for any self-respecting rock band to incorporate a little 808 thud into their rock and roll mix. __ Cynical: __ After the ""electronica"" ""boom"" rose and fell like Keith Flint's spiky haircut, all the big fancy record companies-- and the attendant faux-raver acts to whom they'd promised the world-- had to find a way to shore up their losses. Thus, the awkward shotgun marriage of rock to drum machines, resulting in efforts ranging from lovely (Radiohead) to dull (Smash Mouth) to bizarre (Rolling Stones produced by the Dust Brothers). All in all, the experiment can be deemed a bust. __ Contrarian: __ Techno? Techno-rock fusion? Fuck that! __ * Step Two: Introduce the Band * __ __ Straightforward: __ A good, if somewhat surprising, example of the Euro tech-rock fusion is the debut LP from Doves, * Lost Souls * . Where most of the fusing has gone on in the rock camp as aging amp-powered dinos struggled for relevance, Doves' effort provides a rare example of techno-schooled musicians digging in the crates for inspiration. Having made their first splash as a straight-ahead club act called Sub Sub, this trio of blokes woodshedded for a long time, started playing anachronistic instruments you strummed, plucked and hit, and ended up with a collection of damn-near-normal rock songs. Of course, the tincture of their throbbing house-kid past lurks in the shadows all the same. __ Cynical: __ The latest group of cred-hungry beat monsters to cross this writer's desk are Doves, a frustratingly non-capitalized or articled threesome from the UK. Their record's got everything written in lowercase, there's a lot of noiry photos of a boxer, and the damn thing is called * Lost Souls * , all of which reeks of art (or, perhaps more aptly, ""ahhht""). Scowling in front of a cityscape, clad in flannel, and sporting ridiculous stubblefields on their faces, Doves look like they're running as hard as they can from their bow as Sub Sub. There's a reason the single they released under that moniker never made it stateside, and I'm sure it had everything to do with the description ""M People-esque,"" which appeared in the press kit. __ Contrarian: __ Hairy, serious-looking songwriter types from England? Fuck that! __ * Step Three: Flailingly Desperate Attempt to Describe the Record * __ __ Straightforward: __ * Lost Souls * is nothing if not a sprawling, ambitious effort. Padded for U.S. arrival with three bonus tracks, the disc stretches out to more than 72 minutes, and I'll be damned if it isn't a solid, engaging effort throughout. Where the increased running time of a CD is usually more beast than beauty, the breathing room allows Doves to stretch out. Few of these tracks weigh in under the five-minute mark, and most of their durations are given over to jangling acoustic guitars and mid-tempo rhythms that, in places, resemble Mogwai's moments of plaintive contemplation. Tonally, * Lost Souls * reflects the after-after-midnight hours, as if the boys felt the need to document the hung over and blissed-out aftermath of the dancing-hours frenzy their Sub Sub days offered listeners years ago. That rarest of animals, a singing drummer named Andy Williams, wails discontentedly and virtually wordlessly over swelling and receding musical themes, while atmospheric keyboards and ominous samplework provide texture the barebones acoustic arrangements wouldn't achieve on their own. __ Cynical: __ The heart of the problem on * Lost Souls * is its overreaching ambition. Naming the first track-- the virtually instrumental ""Firesuite""-- after the famous four-song suite from the Beach Boys' * Smile * sessions gives it away instantly. Doves are, in both their tilting and endlessly sculpted sounds, after the same instrumental evocations Brian Wilson made and destroyed at the peak of his compositional powers. In most principle respects, this album is straight, rockist Brit-pop. But the samples and keyboards serve only to dress up fairly conventional songs, as if to conceal their pedestrian nature. __ Contrarian: __ More Brian Wilson name-checking? Fuck that! __ * Step Four: Track-by-Track Highlights and Lowlights * __ __ Straightforward: __ * Lost Souls * , despite its reach and ambition, works best in its most conventionally melodic moments. The aptly named ""Melody Calls"" juxtaposes a typically languid vocal against an uncharacteristically jaunty guitar riff, and the result is a little radio-ready wonder. Similarly, the title cut's deep, throbbing chords work as this melancholy work's catalytic center, distilling the band's mixture of atmosphere and song down to a kind of essence. Among the more adventurous tracks, ""Firesuite"" and ""Break Me Gently"" work best because of their carefully planned development and the skillful use of heavily effected vocals, which flesh out what could have been almost Dave Matthews-sized swaths of dull 'jamming.' But the stately ballad at the end of the album proper, ""A House,"" accentuates the songiness of this effort. These boys are interested in beauty, power, emotion and feeling. Not idle wanking. __ Cynical: __ Hey! He stole my stuff! Punk. __ Contrarian: __ Emotion and feeling?! Fuck that! __ * Step Five: Summation * __ __ Straightforward: __ Despite its excesses, * Lost Souls * offers a novel twist on the electronics-plus-rock-equals-fun-for-trainspotters equation. The tech-rock fusion isn't dead in the water yet. __ Cynical: __ Okay, fine. Even Brits can do something decent from time to time. __ Contrarian: __ Fuck England! Rating

Stephen Malkmus,Stephen Malkmus,by: Nick Mirov,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c37cc0084474cd0c34a6/1:1/w_160/ac88d606.gif,2001-01-31 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5057-stephen-malkmus/,MatadorMatador,"I'm not the first to imagine a parallel-universe version of Being John Malkovich entitled Being Stephen Malkmus-- that credit goes to weblogger Adam Kempa, although he neglected to take the concept to its logical extreme and consider the ramifications of Malkmus going through his own portal. Of course, one would expect there'd be a lot of ""Malkmus Malkmus Malkmus. Malkmus? Malkmus, Malkmus!""-type carrying on, but the punchline would have to be that he'd actually enjoy the experience, so much so that he'd abandon Pavement and the rest of the outside world to stay in there, maybe form a band with other himselves, and record an album called, oh, I don't know, Stephen Malkmus. I won't presume to be able to gauge how much influence Malkmus' new bandmates (Portland gadabouts Joanna Bolme and John Moen) had on this, his eponymous solo debut; anyway, it's his name and mug plastered on the album's cover, so he's going to get the majority of praise and blame. There are two immediately apparent differences between Stephen Malkmus and Pavement's catalog: First and least surprisingly, there's less of a group dynamic. It definitely has the sonic hallmarks of a ""solo"" album-- the songs are less jammy and spontaneous, more rigidly structured. Second, it's a lot more fun-sounding than Pavement was near the end of its shelf-life. Let's face it, Pavement hadn't really sounded ""fun"" since Wowee Zowee-- Brighten the Corners and Terror Twilight had occasional moments of playfulness, but on the whole they were considerably more sober, bordering on ponderous. As Malkmus has noted in interviews, this increasing lack of fun was one important factor in Pavement's dissolution; now having escaped from the handcuffs of ""band""-dom, the solo Malkmus is savoring his freedom, the spring back in his step. He's not indulging in that freedom to the extent that he would confound all expectations and, say, record an album of Swedish reggae; Stephen Malkmus is Stephen Malkmus as Stephen Malkmus, splitting time (as always) between smirky loopiness and wistful melancholy. The whimsy factor may have been turned way up, but Malkmus spends his time on the album learning how to focus that whimsy towards specific ends, not just for its own sake. If Pavement fans were grinding their teeth over the prospect of Stephen Malkmus being a flop, the first single, ""Discretion Grove"", didn't help matters much. It's about as MOR a song as he's ever written (with the exception of, perhaps, ""Major Leagues""), chugging along mindlessly when it should be building toward a more satisfying climax. Also in the less-than-desirable category is ""Jo Jo's Jacket"", a prime example of Malkmus at his least appealing. In what is ostensibly a song about Yul Brynner, he doesn't do much beyond tack a sample of a Brynner interview at the beginning and namecheck Westworld, abandoning the subject matter entirely by the second verse and freestyling his way to the end. Let's be clear about something: songs about nothing in particular are fine if done right, as are songs about specific subjects, but switching between the two formats doesn't speak well of properly realized intentions. Fortunately, Malkmus doesn't let his whimsy get the better of him elsewhere on the album; ""Phantasies"" is so unremittingly goony with its annoying samples, rubbery guitar and gratuitous falsettos that I can't help but love it. Likewise, ""Troubbble""'s farting keyboards and guitar spasms make it a quick spurt of inspired head-bobbery. Ever since ""Zurich is Stained"" and ""Here"", I've always preferred Malkmus' achier, laid-back songs, of which this album has an abundance: ""Church on White"" is a lush, tender tribute to a deceased friend, and ""Deado"" and ""Trojan Curfew"" balance sublime, shimmery beauty with gentle humor. Malkmus' biggest departure from his work with Pavement, however, lies in ""The Hook"" and ""Jenny and the Ess-Dog"", where he puts his gift for non-sequitur detail in the employ of an actual storyline. I've heard some people describe ""The Hook"" as Malkmus' ""Lou Reed song,"" which seems sort of appropriate given his speak-sing delivery and deceptively simple, classic-sounding guitar solo. Naturally, it's a song about pirates, and an unromantic one at that: ""We had no wooden legs or steel hooks/ We had no black eyepatches or a starving cook/ We were just killers with the cold eyes of a sailor."" ""Jenny and the Ess-Dog"" unrolls a relationship between a young rich girl and an older slacker; the song's resolution initially feels like a shrug, with the things between them sputtering out when she goes off to college. But it speaks to something deeper about relationships as a temporary escape from the expectations of real life, and the eventual obligation to face ""real life"" again, albeit with a slightly different perspective. Stephen Malkmus is a more coherent album than any one Pavement release, which can be seen as both a good and bad quality. There's less variation between the songs in terms of structure, but it's the minor tweaks to the sound that are the things to savor-- the ghostly sample that ties together ""Deado"", the silly but completely apropos steel drum bit on ""Vague Space"", the flute that swoops through the snarling trudge of ""Black Book"". Malkmus has regained his songwriting stride, and he sounds more confident than he's been in a long time. There aren't as many extremes or chances taken as some Pavement fans might like; it's not ""important"" or ""groundbreaking,"" and it probably won't make many best-of lists come December. But it's still an enjoyable album with its share of Malkmus-worthy moments.","I'm not the first to imagine a parallel-universe version of Being John Malkovich entitled Being Stephen Malkmus-- that credit ...

Easy Come Easy Go 1994-2000,Starflyer 59,by: Camilo Arturo Leslie,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a53fc0084474cd0c0695/1:1/w_160/1ca5dc43.gif,2001-01-23 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7462-easy-come-easy-go-1994-2000/,Tooth and NailTooth and Nail,"I hate their band name, their cover art, and the fact that they're on a sort of Christian label, too. Okay, so ""hate"" is a bit strong. How about ""it makes me really uneasy."" Well, except for their cover art; I do hate that. Of course, you're probably a lot more sophisticated and mature than I am. You own Jeremy Enigk records. His born-again-ness doesn't faze you a bit. Good for you. I, however, came at this band with a fair amount of prejudice and cynicism. I was expecting Stryper meets Amy Grant, only alternafied. So, it's to Jason Martin's credit that the better material on these two discs was able to win me over thoroughly. In fact, I like it so much that right now I'm dancing the Pentecostal version of the ""running man"" with a rattlesnake between around my neck while speaking in tongues and listening to the octogenarian rock gospel quartet from Tulsa that I've hired for the occasion. Sorry, just joking. These guys aren't overt bible thumpers. They're apparently just ordinary California guys that have mastered a few Britpop tricks and made some great music out of it. This two-disc release attempts to compile the best of Starflyer 59's career, with the added bonus of b-sides, rarities, and live recordings. What ordinarily would be thought of as the afterthought, the second disc is a viable album in and of itself, not just a mess of odds and ends. So, okay, we've established that Easy Come Easy Go isn't the modern equivalent of To Hell with the Devil. But what do they sound like? Well, they're slow and dreamy, and they really dig reverb, phaser and delay. Martin sounds like he's nodding off in that breathy, super-sensitive way and the drumming is understated but more than adequate. Sound familiar? It should. Starflyer don't exactly have Our Lady of Divine Innovation on their side, unless she's providing just enough originality to keep this Christian band from sucking. Basically, Starflyer 59 play shoegazery, Britpoppy, atmospheric wimp-rock in the sensitivo vein. You wouldn't know it from the first few tracks on disc one, though. The mysteriously much-beloved ""Blue Collar Love"" sounds like slightly less terrible Alice in Chains. ""Monterey,"" another of the band's early ""hits,"" is likewise heavily derivative while offering little in the way of sing-along-ability. It's not until the fifth track, the dark yet delicate ""Duel Overhead Cam,"" that things stabilize. The My Bloody Valentine infused pop of ""You're Mean"" follows, showering layers of jangle and hissy vocals through which Martin's crooning and melodic guitar shine. ""The Voyager"" is the most egregious radio oversight of all the best-of tracks, though, due largely to the fantastic bluesy guitar riff in the chorus. ""The Hearttaker"" adds a touch of spaced-out dreaminess to the mix with a Moog synth bit. So, great. Martin proves he's a versatile songwriter, and his soul is saved. Which is more than you can say for most musicians. Things generally follow at an even keel until ""We're the Ordinary."" Here, an already much-better-than-solid collection of songs gets a shot of vitamin B12 in the ass, and things get downright cash-worthy. The dancy, criminally hummable second-to-last track, ""No New Kinda Story,"" features some beautiful keyboard details. Think New Order meets James. Disc two, as I stated before, consists of rarities, b-sides, and live versions of fan favorites. It's just as, if not more cohesive than the first disc, and packed tight with brain-thistle melodies. You could dig through their five studio albums-- Silver, Gold, Americana, The Fashion Focus, and Everybody Makes Mistakes-- or you could just hit Easy Come Easy Go. For those of you already in possession of the Starflyer 59 back catalog, this could make a worthy addendum, with almost an entire album's worth of rare material included. Take it from this reluctant proselyte. Don't make me start leaving Gideon's bibles on your nightstand.","I hate their band name, their cover art, and the fact that they're on a sort of Christian label ...

From the Desk of Mr. Lady EP,Le Tigre,by: Rich Juzwiak,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bcb8c0084474cd0c2b4e/1:1/w_160/84d59575.gif,2001-01-23 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4704-from-the-desk-of-mr-lady-ep/,Mr. LadyMr. Lady,"""What is it that younger women are pushing up against?"" asks a male interviewer. A few women's voices can be heard, stumbling over words, grappling for an answer. The nervous giggles, uh's and um's are then sampled into a lo-fi electro sound collage to create the composition Le Tigre call, ""They Want Us to Make a Symphony Out of the Sound of Women Swallowing Their Own Tongues."" The track, previously heard on last year's Hot Topic UK-only single, is the beguiling centerpiece to the band's new EP, From the Desk of Mr. Lady. Because Kathleen Hanna has quite admirably never been one to mince words, the track's message is a puzzle. What exactly are ex-Riot Grrl Hanna, videomaker Sadie Benning, and zinester Johanna Fateman trying to accomplish with ""Symphony?"" Is it an attack on the insensitive males who ask stupid questions? An assault on the girls who betray their more noble sisters with stupid answers? A simple reclaiming of voice? The answer to the question is as unclear who the titular ""they"" pertains to. The word ""they,"" or ""them,"" frequently has a vilifying connotation, and in this respect, it seems like it's the corporate, white, conservative man in charge-- we'll call him The Man-- who wants such a track. But The Man doesn't listen to Le Tigre. If he's heard them, he hates them. Le Tigre's audience is primarily comprised of like-minded, liberal individuals who most likely have been listening to Hanna for a while. Of course, it's not without reason that Hanna's audience has stuck with her. When fronting Bikini Kill, she aggressively showed off her considerable brainpower and a voice as vital as it was abrasive. Her solo project, Julie Ruin, proved her a self-sufficient mastermind of lo-fi electronic bedroom recording. Hell, even last year's debut from Le Tigre, while markedly more accessible, was a gem-- a testament to the unlikely fun that can come of ""message music."" But it's because of Hanna's sterling past that the new Le Tigre EP seems a disappointment. Previously, Hanna balanced indignant self-righteousness with irony and intellect, throwing foul-mouthed temper tantrums laced with wit. She took anti-female slurs, wrote them on her stomach and made them her own. Now, she's reclaiming the notoriously anti-feminist comic strip character Cathy, who's pictured on the CD shouting, ""In seeking specific technical information, we discover that behind the hysteria of male expertise lies the magic world of our unmade art."" It's cute and ironic, but feels like a half-hearted slap when compared to the punch in the face that once jumped around the stage in a midriff with ""Slut"" inked across her stomach. It should be explained, I feel, why the focus is on Hanna. Simply, it has to be. Hanna's such a commanding frontwoman, obviously capable of autonomy, that it's often hard to tell, or even care, where the other members fit in, save for sporadic vocals. Hanna appears the navigator of whatever her musical vehicle happens to be at the moment, and when she's not in top form, the whole operation is threatened. And on From the Desk of Mr. Lady, Hanna is simply not in top form. The EP opens with ""Get Off the Internet,"" a lo-fi dose of old school hip-hop beats and Motown riffs that, like most of the music on the record, trods a similar path to the one Le Tigre paved on their debut. Hanna hollers, ""Destroy the right wing,"" preaching to an already-converted-years-and-years-ago set. Though the lyrics are dabbed with self-awareness in the mix (""This is repetitive/ But nothing has changed""), it doesn't make up for the broken-record effect of the song. As always, Hanna deserves props for saying what few others bother to explore. ""Bang! Bang!"" decries the NYPD for the murders of Patrick Dorismund and Amadou Diallo. The song doesn't necessarily add anything to the liberal outlook on police shootings of unarmed men, but does distill the widespread beliefs admirably and simply into a pop song. At the end of the track, the members of Le Tigre count in unison to 41, a number for every bullet Diallo received. It's resounding, stirring, and as effective as Hanna gets. And that's saying a lot. But that's about it when it comes to notable messages that Hanna brings to the table. ""Gone B4 Yr Home"" has the bounce of ""Girlfriend in a Coma,"" the pseudo-Caribbean schmaltz of ""Kokomo,"" the electronic-Casio feel of an early Nintendo game, and lyrics that criticize clueless men. ""Mediocrity Rules"" is the musical high point, propelled by an insatiable new wave riff. Still, its lyrics are a bit too similar in theme to ""Home."" The most harshness Hanna achieves here is contained in the line, ""Nothing scares you like a real idea."" This is lame when compared to the exemplary brashness Hanna wreaked when she wailed, ""I'm so sorry that I think/ White boys/ Don't laugh/ Don't cry/ Just die!"" in the early days of Bikini Kill. It's that brand of chafing fury that's absent from Desk, and not surprisingly, sorely missed. Mostly, From the Desk of Mr. Lady comes off like sub-standard material that didn't make it on to last year's full-length. Even so, bonus material or not, Hanna has set her standard so high that there's potential for catastrophe in the event that she slips. From the Desk of Mr. Lady marks the first time in over a decade that Hanna's cursive letters don't feel like knives.","""What is it that younger women are pushing up against?"" asks a male interviewer.

Things We Lost in the Fire,Low,by: Ryan Schreiber,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Founder</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd7fabf31b7dc7155f70/1:1/w_160/2b62dadd.jpg,2001-01-21 06:01:40,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4892-things-we-lost-in-the-fire/,Kranky,"When Low emerged from snowy Duluth, Minnesota with their 1994 Kramer-produced debut, I Could Live in Hope, their trudging funeral marches, sparse instrumentation, and Royal Albert Hall production values were strikingly fresh. Though they were preceded in the slowcore movement by earlier innovators like Galaxie 500 and Codeine, it was Low that defined the genre's sound. Of course, by their third album, 1996's The Curtain Hits the Cast, the formula began to wear thin. New producer Steve Fisk brought little to the trio's sound, which remained virtually unchanged. While Low turned out a few great songs on the record-- namely, ""Anon,"" ""Over the Ocean,"" and ""Lust""-- the near-Canadians failed to branch out, save for the 15-minute jam session ""Do You Know How to Waltz?"" Low began loosely experimenting on 1998's Songs for a Dead Pilot EP, but returned to less adventurous songwriting the following year with the full-length Secret Name. The album sported crisper, less dramatic production, but failed to deviate from the concept the band had begun with five years earlier. Regardless, the songs were of a similar caliber to those on previous outings, and a whole legion of new fans sprung up. Most newcomers haven't grown tired of Low's penchant for lethargy, since, to this day, few bands have attempted what the three have already perfected. The closest runners-up may be New York's Ida; the two bands are often considered contemporaries within the same genre. But this comparison belies one simple backbone fact: Low rarely force themselves to sound beautiful. Instead, they focus on building tension and atmosphere around sloth-paced pop songs, while Ida witlessly water down their own country/folk influences with syrupy strings and gaudy ""prettiness."" Vanity has never been Low's concern, and on Things We Lost in the Fire, their humility has never been so affecting. The opening track features a double-timed, pounding snare, a basic descending chord structure, and the gratingly ""nice"" refrain, ""You bought some sweet/ Sweet/ Sweet/ Sweet Sunflowers."" But a more attentive listen reveals a new lyrical direction. They've toned down the ambiguity and opted for creepy surrealism: ""When they found your body/ Giant x's on your eyes/ And with your half of the ransom/ You bought some sweet sunflowers/ And gave in to the night."" Even if the British EP hadn't been available since last year, ""Dinosaur Act"" would stand out as the obvious single. Mimi Parker's tiny snare drum is squashed beneath pummeling tympani like the song's prehistoric namesake, as frontman Alan Sparhawk closes the song's final chorus with a shouted ""Dinosaur!"" But Things We Lost in the Fire's finest moments come just as the album draws to a close. On ""Like a Forest,"" the band dig themselves out of their somber rut to briefly uplift; the track is paced at nearly twice the speed of their other pieces, and seems generally optimistic, if lyrically vague. ""Like a Forest"" is filled out with an economy-size string section produced to sound incredibly dense. But rather than overwhelming the song with soaring drama, the strings are incorporated conservatively low in the mix, and generate a warm hum for the sake of ambience. Meanwhile, a lone plinking piano note keeps pace alongside Parker's snapping percussion. Were ""Like a Forest"" the only Low song you'd ever heard, it's unlikely you'd suspect its somewhat psychedelic chord structure and absolutely engaging, see-sawing vocals were the product of the progenitors of slowcore. ""In Metal"" is a simply crushing Parker-sung ode to she and Sparhawk's new baby, Hollis. Parker's chilling voice, as she confesses her hopeless longing for the child to stay small forever, simultaneously attains both heartbreakingly desperation and jubilance: ""Partly hate to see you grow/ And just like your baby shoes/ Wish I could keep your little body/ In metal."" There's a bizarre David Lynch quality to the concept of immortalizing a baby in some kind of Han Solo freeze that prevents the song from crossing over into blatant sentimentalism. But Parker's affection for the child, who can be heard squeaking at low levels during the song's first verse, is not feigned. The song serves as a flawless finale, to the point that it can alter your view of the album as a whole. In truth, the whole of Things We Lost in the Fire rarely equals the impact of ""In Metal,"" and at many points, even floats out of immediate consciousness to dwell in pits of mediocrity. ""Whitetail,"" despite spectacular brushed cymbal loops and effects, flounders aimlessly for more than five dragging minutes; ""Laser Beam"" is beyond minimal, with just Parker singing quietly over pausing guitar; ""Embrace"" is painfully melodramatic as Parker spouts such ridiculousness as ""I fell down the stairs/ I wished I were dead""; and the 49 second-long untitled track that precedes ""In Metal"" plays like a manufacturing error that accidentally caught a portion of labelmates Windy & Carl's Consciousness. Still, Things We Lost in the Fire's high points are, without question, the best they've done. An endless list of studio guests-- including ex-Soul Cougher Mark D'Gli Antoni on piano and sampler, trumpeting by Bob Weston, and impeccable production by one Steve Albini-- certainly add to the enjoyment. But above all else, it's Low's willingness to finally live up to their Kranky cohorts by experimenting with ambient textures, eerie tension, and advanced songwriting methods that saves this from being yet another I Could Live in Hope. Here's hoping they get even weirder.","When Low emerged from snowy Duluth, Minnesota with their 1994 Kramer-produced debut, I Could Live in Hope, their trudging funeral ...

Liberation Afro Beat Vol. 1,Antibalas Afrobeat Orchestra,by: Jonny Pietin,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a0b5c0084474cd0bfc39/1:1/w_160/310e8244.gif,2001-01-16 06:00:04,Global,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/213-liberation-afro-beat-vol-1/,Ninja TuneNinja Tune,"Music is a political statement. This fact is inescapable. All forms of music, regardless of national origin or temporal placement, have in some way reflected the struggle and separation, the spaces in which artistic expression is allowed, as well as the spaces between those spaces, of the particular societies that bore them. In America, politics are mostly, if not entirely, about economics; oddly, we often make much of the emotional content of a particular piece of music, but rarely, especially in what is known as the ""indie"" community, examine its economic context. Antibalas want to destroy capitalism. Really. They say so right in their liner notes: ""Time to destroy capitalism before it destroys us."" A holy imperative. And they have the beginnings of an army to back it up: fourteen people contributed musically to this record. Based out of Brooklyn, Antibalas Afrobeat Orchestra is a collective of like-minded revolutionaries bent on liberating minds from the bounds of a free-market economy through the performance of mostly instrumental funk in the tradition of Fela Kuti. Failing that, they hope to create a space beyond in which they and others are not held down by ""corrupt institutions like governments, armies, and banks,"" and can start anew, cooperatively rather than competitively. As they state in the less Mumia-esque-than-Metaphysical Graffiti-ish spoken-word intro to the album closer, ""World War IV,"" this struggle is just that: a war. Liberation Afro Beat Vol. 1 is their first missile. So where's the explosion? Certainly not in that ultimate track, recorded live at the Jazz Café in London. In an unexpected turn, both the live tracks on the record emphasize how much stronger Antibalas is in the studio. Thankfully, it's not the rhythm section that falters in performance situations (what would a funk band be without a rock-solid beat?), but the horns. While the brassists and reeders do manage to piece together some nice soloing when they're in the glass booth, they end up faltering mightily when playing out live, letting their lines trail off into unexciting sighs. Or, at least, that's what happened during the Jazz Café show. In any case, the live recordings are about the least explosive thing on Liberation Afro Beat Vol. 1, which is a bit like saying sparklers are the least explosive things in a box full of caps. The album begins with a noise that sounds a bit like a distant bomb going off; an organ enters, then screams, then a rhythm. And it's a very good rhythm, but not an explosive one; it does not fulfill the promise of the bomb-noise. The song itself, a nearly ten-minute workout titled ""Si, Se Puede,"" goes a little somewhere, eventually, but not very far into that somewhere. There's a funky groove, that's true; there's some nice horn solos, yes; but is there any fire? The answer there would have to be a resounding maybe. The truth is, for a band that makes so much noise about being political revolutionaries, they end up coming off, musically, rather boring. This is not to say that the music itself is tepid; played for a party full of open-minded friends, it would cause more than one head to bob. It's just that Liberation Afro Beat Vol. 1 should be so much more than head-bobbing music. It should grab you by the heart and the loins, lift you out of your chair, and force you to fuck with the world. Songs like ""N.E.S.T.A. (Never Ever Submit to Authority)"" promise, in their titles, that kind of experience; in their execution, however, they become seven-minute exercises in Fela Kuti/James Brown worship. And these two artists, at their pinnacles, could achieve this kind of affective artistry by translating a type of music that was, in itself and its time, politically incendiary, into an even more radically politicized context. All Antibalas do is take the gestures of afro-funk and graft them onto the current political climate; in doing so, they end up speaking for no one. Hip-hop is the music of the politically oppressed now; Jay-Z has more to say than Antibalas about the dangers of complacency in a corporate-ruled world, and he does it by acting as a case study. We can't forget, of course, that rap has its roots in funk, dating back to the first Kool Herc James Brown breakbeat; however, it would be truly something for a group like Antibalas to capture some of the emotional heat generated by hip-hop and ""sample"" it, integrating a real magma flow into their currently dormant volcanoes. Then maybe they could live up to their liner-note goals. Antibalas is a band that, in their concept and through their words, makes you want to be revolutionized. There is so much promise, so much possibility in their music, and in music in general; they could not only make a statement about the world as it is, but also be a trigger-force for change. It's regrettable, then, that Antibalas do not fulfill this promise, nor take this possibility and turn it into a weapon. I really wanted them to.","Music is a political statement.

New Orbit,Matthew Shipp,by: Matt LeMay,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a3d5c0084474cd0c035f/1:1/w_160/f84d124b.gif,2001-01-16 06:00:03,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7117-new-orbit/,Thirsty Ear,"We live in a world of disasters and near-disasters. Accidents, misfortunes, and catastrophes seem to present themselves to us with alarming regularity, and oftentimes, we're completely unaware that they exist. Such is the case with the career of jazz pianist Matthew Shipp. At the cusp of a new millennium, Shipp was ready to go on what could be described as an indefinite hiatus-- a break from recording to determine exactly what he wanted to get out of his career. It was unclear if another Matthew Shipp record would be released in the near future, if ever again. Shipp's body of work previous to his breather was certainly impressive, but a recess, whether temporary or otherwise, seemed far from tragic. But be it through divine inspiration, meditative thought, or just a flash of brilliance, Shipp has come back stronger than ever, releasing what could be the two greatest albums of his career. Last year's excellent Pastoral Composure, Shipp's first record since announcing his possible lull in recording, hinted at a level of excellence his previous work had yet to approach. Experimenting with jazz and traditional standards, Shipp constructed what is without a doubt the most accessible album of his career thus far. But if there was any fault to be found with Pastoral Composure, it was that it at times adhered too strictly to standard jazz rhythms and textures. With New Orbit, Matthew Shipp has crafted an album that manages to merge the accessibility and raw appeal of Pastoral Composure with adventurous new textures that go beyond anything he has produced in the past. New Orbit centers around four ""Orbits,"" spread across the record. The first, second, and fourth Orbits focus on a beautiful piano theme that combines the emotional pull of a descending chromatic scale with the complex, ever-changing melodies and rhythms Shipp is known for. The third Orbit brings the central piano melody to the bass guitar, with frequent Shipp collaborator William Parker extracting remarkably human sounds from his instrument. The rest of New Orbit complements the central pieces perfectly. In ""Paradox X,"" Shipp's amorphous melodies echo sheer treble, as drummer Gerald Cleaver and bassist Parker rumble beneath. But many of the album's high points come with the work of revered trumpet player Wadada Leo Smith, whose articulate and lively playing lifts the album's sonic palette to even greater heights. It's kind of startling to think that Matthew Shipp came so close to possibly not recording this amazing album. After 10 years and 17 releases, he's finally released an album that would be as at home in space as it would in a smoky jazz club.","We live in a world of disasters and near-disasters.

Scavengers,Calla,by: Rich Juzwiak,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a4ea9d034d5c69bf3197/1:1/w_160/932031e9.gif,2001-01-16 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1252-scavengers/,Young GodYoung God,"Calla's 1999 self-titled debut was the type of record that's typically filed under ""avant"" in loftier music stores. Not quite rock, not quite post-rock, it was a fuzz-caked affair described by luminaries like Alternative Press as, ""Quiet tension without release and music without boundaries."" Truth be told, with its vocals mixed super-low, screeching guitars, and nearly formless songwriting, Calla was inaccessible and came off as almost absurdly pretentious. The group's second LP, then, is a sweetly stinging smack in the face. From the start, with the stellar ""Fear of Fireflies,"" it's clear that the Brooklyn-by-way-of-Texas trio is shedding more skin than the snakes they grew up around. With tinny percussion, folky acoustic strumming, melodic basslines, and vocals way up front, it seems that singer/guitarist Aurelio Valle, occasional Bowery Electric cohort drummer Wayne B. Magruder, and bassist/keyboardist Sean Donovan have ditched the obtuse atmospheric electronics that made their debut so impenetrable. The biggest shock, though, comes not from more straight-ahead instrumentation, but from the quality of songwriting. The opener slinks along a brooding line during the verses, until an undeniably infectious, image-laden chorus, in which Valle sings, ""See your fireflies hover at the dark/ Following tracers scattered in the park/ Following me."" And much of Scavengers finds Calla on similarly melodic and gorgeous ground. The album's greatest strength is its consistent moodiness-- the brooding air of desperation and paranoia that looms but never wallows in self-importance. It's evident in the twangy ""Hover over Nowhere,"" which is framed by sluggish slow-core drums washed away by a (slightly) brighter chorus with a lamenting guitar packed with reverb. The claustrophobic ""Traffic Sound"" sports a low-end pulse and ominous guitar riff similar to the one in Portishead's ""Sour Times."" ""Love of Ivah"" is a sparse guitar and bass ballad in which Valle remarks, ""I hope I never see you in another life/ I just might try seeking shelter underneath my skin."" If the music and lyrics create the mood of Scavengers, Valle's vocals realize and perfect it. His breathy, sometimes whispered delivery sounds alternately affected and apathetic, as though he's fatally wounded and using his waning strength to attempt to shrug it off. Though his approach is potentially disastrous, he sounds utterly genuine, like when he sings, ""Sorry for the inconvenience/ It's only 'cause I'm losing patience,"" after the song has just rapidly built up to dynamic cacophony. Calla temporarily revert back to the ways of their debut on two Scavengers tracks, ""Mayzelle"" and ""A Fondness for Crawling."" While neither song seems out of place, both serve as the record's low points. When a band is as adroit as Calla at more or less ""conventional"" songwriting, atmospheric compositions consisting of polyrhythmic tablas, atonal hums, and harsh scraping sounds simply feel like unnecessary experiments. But for the most part, Calla bypass revisiting their difficult debut and instead reinvent themselves as a brooding, masterfully melodic pack. And Scavengers is testament to the success that comes when a band turns its back on self-written exposition, and expertly comes out of its shell.","Calla's 1999 self-titled debut was the type of record that's typically filed under ""avant"" in loftier music stores ...

Styles of the Unexpected EP,Andy Votel,by: Paul Cooper,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a979ea9e61561daa5a3d/1:1/w_160/a3a7e465.gif,2001-01-16 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8500-styles-of-the-unexpected-ep/,Twisted NerveXLBeggarsTwisted NerveXLBeggars,"Andy Votel has been knocking around the UK blunted beatz scene for a while now, and for the most part, he's not been just another stoner stinking up post-production studios with antique Adidas purchased online from a Shibuya-based retro-chic boutique. Since his 1995 remix of Mr Scruff's ""Sea Mammal,"" Votel has achieved acclaim for turning Badly Drawn Boy from a thrift-store Jamiroquai into an award-winning George Harrison substitute. Setting aside the arrogance of the title, the seven tracks on this EP offer no great leaps in form, no turning of the tables of the money changers, no brave new vistas for the rest of us cloth-eared schlubs to follow on wide-eyed. The blunted beats here have long since made their way into the vernacular of TRL-pop and high-cost consumer durable commercials. After a brooding start, the rinky-dink Rosemary's Baby melody of ""Urbanite Rocks"" rides through a devastated cityscape where malformed infants cruise around in leper-pushed carriages in search of parents, sources of nourishment, and sunlight. ""Girl on a GoPed"" renews Votel's partnership with Jane Weaver in a Pram-for-Dido-fans style. Weaver kittenishly purrs about a ""slinky little number"" while Votel frames her in chiming glockenspiels, the revving sounds of Vespas, and dollar-store organ lines. The conservatoire-trained, romantically swollen pianist who drops in and out of ""Return of the Spooky Driver"" is stubborn against the blasting surf guitar punks that intend to rid the planet of such academic prettiness. Can the two reconcile their differences? Is this track big enough for both styles? Votel fades the song out with the punks. Who knows where the pianist's body has been dumped? If the Coen Brothers feel like following up the bluegrass adventures of Ulysses Everett McGill, what better theme song could they wish for than the jaunty banjo twang and xylophone clank of ""Pickpocket?"" And the ostentatious production of ""Diode"" allows us a glimpse of what Tortoise might sound like if they recorded for Grand Central. Along identical lines, ""Doe-Eyed"" is the fuzzy gamelan of Macha packaged for the sneaker-conscious. Styles then closes with Lee Gorton's world-weary, work-shy, cello-accompanied vocals on the oddly constricted ""RiderBrow."" Styles of the Unexpected does little to rid me of the notion that Votel's sole intent behind it was to release something-- anything-- on 10-inch vinyl. Having been recently discovered as God's preferred format for the storage of musical information, Votel likely thought he'd give the Old Man something new to stroke his gray beard to. Knowing that Speaka's far more worthy Bespoke album couldn't be fit on anything less than a 12"", Votel felt as though these seven tunes would ring out as sound as a pound. I don't want to speak for God in this matter-- after all, he has his own unique ways of displaying favor or annoyance-- but I'll keep Bespoke spinning long after the so-called Styles of the Unexpected have worn out their meager novelty.","Andy Votel has been knocking around the UK blunted beatz scene for a while now, and for the most part ...

"Very Soon, and in Pleasant Company",Shipping News,by: Ryan Kearney,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a3d9b1335d7bf1698806/1:1/w_160/2d5ca3c4.gif,2001-01-16 06:00:00,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7122-very-soon-and-in-pleasant-company/,Touch and GoQuarterstick,"Seeing as the Shipping News took their band name from E. Annie Proulx's National Book Award- and Pulitzer Prize-winning novel of the same name; and, considering that guitarist Jeff Mueller, of the now-defunct June of 44, and bassist Jason Noble, of Rachel's-- who previously collaborated in Rodan-- decided to form the band while composing and recording music for the NPR program ""This American Life,"" I would venture that, individually, they're more literate than the entire lineup of a band like, say, Buckcherry. Thus, I'd also presume that the three members of the Shipping News-- which also includes Rachel's drummer Kyle Crabtree-- see through the generally shallow lexicon of music criticism. For sometimes reviews, mine included, seem to be comprised of the same common-- that is, stale and overused-- words and phrases. As both critics and entertainers, we try and keep our language fresh, but there are only so many relevant words to describe a drum, a bassline, a guitar riff, or an overall aesthetic. Thus, I freely admit to occasionally consulting J.I. Rodale's semantic tome, The Synonym Finder. (Fuck Roget's!) And then there are times when a critic relies instead on common words and phrases, if only to better communicate with an audience that, in being familiar with these popular words, understands their contextual meanings within music reviews. (William Safire, for instance, might take issue with an ""angular"" guitar.) Take the description ""critically acclaimed."" Because there's no standard for this, critics-- not, er, Pitchfork critics, mind you-- will slap this tag onto any album that garnered one positive major review, and sometimes they'll do so just to legitimize their positive review of the follow-up. This term has been used in reference to the Shipping News' debut effort, 1997's Save Everything, but for good reason: it retained the raw aspect of Rodan's southern post-rock, but refined the sound by replacing the chugging metal riffs with dynamic guitar and bass interplay (a la June of 44). It sounded like the third album Slint should have made. Did I say ""post-rock?"" Well, I'm not touching that, except to say that, other than the consistent vocal accompaniment, this term is still largely apt in regards to the Shipping News. Ah, yes: ""apt."" As in, the ""aptly titled"" opener, ""The March Song."" Dulled, repetitive guitar strumming and consistently off-kilter drums set the marching pace over which Mueller speaks truncated vocals like, ""Wish for air/ Cocoon man/ Smothered in soil/ Deep in the earth again."" The groove exits halfway through, though, as Noble's propulsive bass and Mueller's distorted guitar lend a genuine rock-ness to the track. One might even call ""The March Song"" ""explosive."" Likewise for the 8\xBD-minute ""Quiet Victories,"" which opens with dramatic drums and heavy guitar delay before settling down to sparse percussion and Noble's faint, fragile voice. Later on, a guitar cracks into the song like an ax to wood. And even deeper into the track, the band nicely employs a pause without the reward of an ""explosion,"" and follows it with a crescendo of cymbals, throbbing bass and soaring guitars. But that's about it for ""crescendo."" With its, yes, ""angular"" bassline, ""Nine Bodies, Nine States"" might be called ""energized"" or ""driving""-- at least relatively speaking-- but it never materializes into anything more than repetitive three-chord arrangements. The remaining songs could be described as ""mood pieces"" or ""drifts."" ""Actual blood"" offers brushed cymbals and a spare kickdrum and snare, as well as Noble's hurt voice managing lines such as, ""The words you use spill actual blood."" Beneath the surface of ""Simple Halo"" lurk scratchings, clickings, and a distorted organ, but when the surface contains (literally) tired vocals and the same old drum pace, what good are those intricacies? And ""Contents of a Landfill,"" with its lightly-swirling guitar notes and percussive crashing waves, is more Rachel's than Rodan. The closer, ""How to Draw Horses,"" would be called ""deliberate"" or ""disciplined""-- or perhaps, since the Shipping News are often referred to as math-rock, ""calculated."" In other words, what they're playing is probably complex in a music theory sort of way, but translates into unemotional noodling. Aside from the occasional noise drudges in the background and the dual vocals, the song comes across as an exercise in musical pedantry. Very Soon, and in Pleasant Company represents what some reviewers might call ""a period of transition."" And given the device I'm using in this review, I'll do the same. They've... let's see... ""eschewed"" the bursting emotion that marked Save Everything (as well as Rodan), but have kept its skill, thus creating graceful record without a core. Which is why, in describing Very Soon, I've used the very words I've singled out as being overused: this album isn't innovative or moving enough to warrant a fresh vocabulary.","Seeing as the Shipping News took their band name from E.

Verse by Verse,The Caribbean,by: Spencer Owen,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a525b1335d7bf1698b24/1:1/w_160/e167f9f5.gif,2001-01-15 06:01:40,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1307-verse-by-verse/,EndearingEndearing,"It's time for a new definition of the phrase ""lounge music."" Sure enough, this term seems appropriate enough for the genre it usually represents, but something tells me there's other music that begs for the genre name that doesn't recall sipping martinis under a slowly rotating disco ball, leaning on a bar in your leisure suit, and chatting it up with the dark-haired, pseudo-intellectual, all-too-stylish chick with the sequined dress. No, perhaps the word ""lounge"" can be transferred from the noun to the verb. As in, the type of music you put on when you want to lounge around the house, reclining in your La-Z-Boy by the window on a sunny day. Or maybe out in the yard in the hammock on that same day, if you're lucky enough to have a hammock. Or a yard. Clearly, this has to do with the Caribbean's first full-length release, Verse by Verse. The songs are crafted with pop chord progressions, and certainly, a couple of songs, like ""Have You Thought about Turning Pro?,"" feature a somewhat vigorous pop leaning. But more often than not, Verse by Verse drifts lazily through your ears and reverberates through your mind, although it may take a few listens to notice. And even if the tempo is upbeat, Don Zientara's versatile production style helps each instrument hover just off the ground, subdued and with clarity, rather than settling them in busy rhythmic excitement. The ex-Townies sect of the Caribbean includes Michael Kentoff and Matthew Byars. Kentoff's nasal, restrained vocals pervade the group's sound. And they also bring Townies' knack for interesting titles to the mix as well, with tracks like ""Help Would Only Confuse Me"" and ""I Am the Mosque."" Ex-Smart Went Crazy drummer Tony Dennison shows off his skills by including the announcement of ""Tony's drum part, take one"" at the beginning of the closing track, ""Girl at Fairgrounds,"" to prove that he can do a one-off just as well as anyone. That being said, these musicians in this ""new lounge"" trio are not virtuosos. In fact, they proclaim that, as a consequence of visiting guest musicians who handle certain parts in the studio and on stage, the three members of the band are ""the three least talented people"" present at any live or studio session. This fact is hard to deny, although perhaps almost as hard to accept, since their record proves their chops to be quite competent. Kentoff, Byars and Dennison are a studio group, and as such, they exchange instruments based on individual ideas, which are then put together to create a seamless collaboration on each song. Comparisons to other artists are occasionally notable; a fraction of the wide range of Beatles influences are detectable, and the guys sometimes sound not unlike their polar-coastal indie ""new lounge"" counterparts, Death Cab for Cutie. At times, both comparisons can be made in the same song, such as the opener, ""I'll Simplify My Life (In Fremont),"" featuring Ringo's beat, Lennon's piano, and Benjamin Gibbard's boyish croon. Meanwhile, ""To Call Your Very Own"" resembles a lost Loud Family song. But the tone of Verse by Verse's entirety comes off as something entirely their own-- one of those mixes of influences and familiar sounds that ends up surviving any likenesses and, consequently, creating originality. Now, me, I'm listening to Verse by Verse in my computer chair, occasionally partaking of my mug of caffeine-free Diet Coke ahd trying to ignore the ever-increasing carpal tunnel symptoms, as always. Yet I imagine that the recliner/window or hammock/yard scenarios-- the ""new lounge""-- would be perfect for the bulk of a record like this. When I have a chance, I expect I'll try it out. And you should, too, friends, for you have witnessed the coining of a phrase that will be widely acceptable in our elite musical lexicon in no time at all. Whoever said this gig wouldn't influence people, anyway? Oh, and thanks to the Caribbean for being the effective catalyst. Nice album you got there.","It's time for a new definition of the phrase ""lounge music."" Sure enough, this term seems appropriate enough for ...

What's Next to the Moon,Mark Kozelek,by: Ryan Kearney,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bbf9eb335119a49ecb6a/1:1/w_160/43ae4d28.gif,2001-01-10 06:01:40,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4523-whats-next-to-the-moon/,BadmanBadman,"Mark Kozelek needed a change. Over the course of four years and six albums in the '90s, the Red House Painters frontman penned enough slow, open-hearted tunes to satiate even the most severely-afflicted melancholic patient. But they were so pleasant that most of us were willing to overlook Kozelek's numbing consistency-- or, at least, we couldn't bring ourselves to criticize such an apparently delicate man. Kozelek, after all, was addicted to drugs by the age of ten. Ten, people! I think he has the right to bleed onto every record, if he so desires. Of course, Kozelek kicked his drug habit before forming the Red House Painters, and in 1992 he began a new love/hate relationship: with London's respected 4AD imprint. The ""hate"" part came in 1996, when label head Ivo-Watts Russell wanted to edit the long guitar jams on Songs for a Blue Guitar. Kozelek didn't yield, and took the record to Supreme Recordings, which released the album as it was. Unfortunately, not everything was resolved by this maneuver. In 1998, Red House Painters recorded Old Ramon, which will finally see release in late April through Sub Pop after years of being tied to contractual obligations with the now-defunct Supreme. So Kozelek needed a change. He split off from his band, recorded an acoustic potpourri of covers (John Denver, AC/DC) and original material, and released the album through the Badman Recording Co. in 2000. But Rock 'N' Roll Singer hardly sounded like a change. And while the covers may seem unusual to some fans, they're no surprise to those aware of Kozelek's history with odd remakes; in the past, he's refashioned the likes of Kiss, the Cars, and Yes, to name a few. But something must have really hit home with those three AC/DC covers, because now they've appeared on a whole album's worth of acoustic interpretations of Bon Scott-era AC/DC. Cock rock, meet your new partner: wuss folk. Admittedly, I've never been a big fan of AC/DC, but I have heard enough of their '70s output-- capped off by 1979's Highway to Hell-- to know that this is a strange marriage. Surprisingly, though, Kozelek makes the hard classics sound introspective simply by placing their lyrics in a plaintive musical context. If there's one positive remark to be made about What's Next to the Moon, it's that it sheds revelatory light on the subjective nature of lyrics. Yet, that might be the only truly positive remark this album deserves. Sure, Kozelek's voice is still smooth and sad, and his guitarwork is still deft, yet modest. But these are standard factory settings. Once again, he's made music that just about everyone would describe as ""pleasant."" Except, that is, for die-hard AC/DC fans, who would most certainly be appalled at what Kozelek has done to their sex anthems. Suddenly, ""Love at First Feel"" isn't about statutory rape, but about a falling in love in spite of reason. And ""Bad Boy Boogie"" is the fatalistic admissions of a helpless rebel, not the sexual boasts of a misogynist. Fooled me. Not that some sentiments here don't seem written for Kozelek. The first number, ""Up to My Neck in You,"" begins, ""Well, I've been up to my neck in trouble/ Up to my neck in strife/ Up to my neck in misery/ For most of my life."" Here, his languid delivery suits the material. But when he exerts the same energy for, say, ""Walk All Over You"" or ""If You Want Blood,"" he's no longer convincing. And other times, the lyrics just don't fit Kozelek, as hard as he tries to sensitize them. On ""Love at First Feel,"" for instance, he sings, ""I don't know what your name is/ I don't know what your game is/ I'm gonna take you tonight, animal appetite."" Go get 'em, foxy. In the liner notes to his latest part-covers album, Johnny Cash wrote, ""I worked on these songs until it felt like they were my own."" Kozelek doesn't seem to have done this at all. Instead, these tracks seem to have been worked on less than most ""MTV Unplugged"" sets. There are a couple high points: the bluesy title track, which sounds like a cut from Mark Lanegan's infinitely more successful covers album, I'll Take Care of You. And Kozelek's vocals hit previously uncharted highs on ""You Ain't Got a Hold on Me,"" where he briefly inhabits the ghost of the sane Brian Wilson. But overall this is Red House Painters lite, with one of Kozelek's most vital assets-- his confessional honesty-- entirely absent. Now he really needs a change if he wants to keep our interest. A big change, like reinterpreting his own songs as testosterone-fueled arena rock.","Mark Kozelek needed a change. Over the course of four years and six albums in the '90s, the Red House ...

Sad Sappy Sucker,Modest Mouse,by: Spencer Owen,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c371c0084474cd0c3490/1:1/w_160/830952f7.gif,2001-01-04 06:01:40,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5356-sad-sappy-sucker/,K,"This is a document of a case study performed at the Pitchfork Institute of Technology (P.I.T.) in which three listeners, chosen at random from a sample group, were subjected to the latest release by the group Modest Mouse, Sad Sappy Sucker. They were given a set of facts about the release, which will be reproduced here. Fact Sheet: Modest Mouse in 1994-95 consisted of Isaac Brock on vocals and guitar, Dan Gallucci on guitar, John Wickhart on bass, and Jeremiah Green on drums. Sad Sappy Sucker was their debut album, recorded over this time period by Calvin Johnson at Dub Narcotic, but never released until now. It was shelved in favor of 1996's This is a Long Drive for Someone with Nothing to Think About. By that time, the lineup had removed Gallucci on second guitar and replaced John Wickhart with Eric Judy on bass. The first half of the newly issued Sad Sappy Sucker consists of the original album, which runs at about 27 minutes. The second half is about nine minutes of tracks recorded for Brock's amateur Dial-a-Song service in the same time period. On Their Opinions of Modest Mouse: Listener #1: I enjoy Modest Mouse. Listener #2: I dislike Modest Mouse. Listener #3: Am I in the wrong room? I think I'm supposed to be hearing the new G. Love and Special Sauce. On Isaac Brock's Vocals: Listener #1: This seems to be the decision point for those who are on the fence about whether they enjoy the band or not. So naturally, I love his voice. And on this early record, he definitely sounds younger and more, well... mousy. But the shaky, always slightly aggressive quality of his voice has always appealed to me. Listener #2: Naturally, I hate the guy's voice. It's like they got a tone-deaf retarded guy who's missing teeth to sing for them. I can't say this record has helped me warm up to it, and I probably would have hated it more if I'd heard this record before the others. Listener #3: Hey, fuck this. I'm out of here. On Indie Style: Listener #1: The early form of the group seems to owe more to Archers of Loaf than the Pixies. The structures are less varied, not as tight, and more laid back, with simple, catchy, guitar-pickin' hooks and a healthy, upbeat groove. It often works to their advantage. Sometimes the Pixies influence shines straight through even here, though, like on ""Red Hand Case,"" which features a bluesy progression and quirky, screeching vocals. And strangely, Brock uses his accordion a lot more than usual on both the Dial-a-Songs and the album itself. Jeremiah Green still proves himself to be one of indie rock's best drummers, even this early on in the game. Listener #2: I agree. Although the music has never made much of an impression on me-- especially with that guy's nasal yelp to get past-- Green's a fucking awesome drummer. On Guitars and Overdubbing: Listener #1: I prefer the sound of the band's latest records, with Brock's masterful guitar stylings pervading the sound, overdubbed ten times over, adding the complexity that makes it so fascinating. But even before 2000's The Moon & Antarctica, when his guitar was simpler, he still managed to pull off some fascinating riffs by himself. Here it's sort of entry level ""indie,"" and he's got a supporting guitarist to help him out. Nevertheless, the riffs are often engaging enough, especially for a fan like myself. Listener #2: For me, the more interesting the guitars the better, and if the sounds of the previous records failed to interest me, you can bet this one bored me to tears. On Lyrics: Listener #1: Isaac's lyrics here are clearly not as philosophically developed as they became in the later years. He still tries to tackle the big issues, like life and death; on the brief, solo-accordion ""Think Long,"" he sings, ""Sit and think for a while, and you'll realize that you still die/ If you're not thinking at all, I'm not sure why you're alive."" But with titles like ""Worms Vs. Birds"" and ""Mice Eat Cheese"" dominating the pack, it's clear he had a ways to go until he got to pensive musings like ""The universe is shaped exactly like the earth/ If you go straight long enough, you'll end up where you were."" Listener #2: I'm sort of glad that he's sticking to the basics. The other words were simply pretentious bullshit. On Length and The Dial-A-Song Bonus Tracks: Listener #1: It's interesting to see that the songs are so short. I mean, of course the Dial-a-Song tracks are all under a minute, but the songs usually run about two-to-three minutes here, and that's atypical of the band. Of course, it's further proof that Brock was just carving his niche; he was simply at the beginning of his path as a musician, his ideas not being able to sustain an epic track or maintain interest for longer periods of time as they so easily can these days. The Dial-a-Song tracks prove this even further, featuring ideas stretching out over only thirty seconds with no cohesive way to connect them with others. They're often silly-- sometimes painfully, atonally so, especially when including kazoos and whistles-- but sometimes they hint at bigger, better songs. The most interesting of the Dial-a-Songs come early on, so they work best as a sort of afterthought to the bulk of the record. Listener #2: The songs are mercifully short. The Dial-a-Song tracks are painfully amateurish. I can't believe I'm being subjected to this garbage. On the Completely Idiotic Decision to Make the Fourth Song Unlisted, Thereby Causing the Tracklist as Seen on the Packaging to Be Off by One for the Majority of the Record: Listener #1: It's interesting that the unlisted fourth track happens to be one of the record's catchiest and best tracks. But even I'll admit that it's stupid to sequence it that way. Listener #2: Doesn't fucking surprise me. On Favorite Tracks, Most and Least: Listener #1: Besides the unlisted track, I enjoy the opener, ""Worms Vs. Birds,"" as an example of the best track which fits the overall style of the record. It's loosely played, melodically simple, but highly enjoyable. My other favorite is ""Every Penny Fed Car,"" which strikes me as the most obvious hint to their future work; it begins instrumentally with a driving riff and a complex beat and then suddenly switches mid-song to chanting vocals and gradual, overstated power chords. My least favorites are the minute-or-less tracks within the body of the record. The ideas don't seem developed enough to have a place with the rest of the songs. Listener #2: I guess I like the first half of ""Every Penny Fed Car,"" since it's instrumental and all. But the rest just bugs me. Obviously. Conclusions: Listener #1: Overall, Sad Sappy Sucker feels as if it was sort of put together in a hurry, despite it having sat around in the warehouse for seven years. The album part has plenty of good songs, though, and any completist will want to hear it. The Dial-a-Songs seem disposable, but they're interesting to hear at least once to see how Brock got his start. Listener #2: Man, I thought I hated them before. They're going to have to work really, really hard to impress me now. Listener #3: Oh, what? Sorry, I forgot my Gatorade. I'll leave again.","This is a document of a case study performed at the Pitchfork Institute of Technology (P.I.T.) in which ...

Abilene,Abilene,by: Camilo Arturo Leslie,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/59299fe75e6ef9596931fe24/1:1/w_160/b639b115.gif,2000-12-31 06:00:09,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12-abilene/,Slowdime,"The Portland Trailblazers, Christmas fruitcakes, and the cast ofThe Man in the Iron Mask all suffer from the same malady: each is considerably less than the sum of its parts. You might blame the Blazers' woes on weak coaching. And you could pin that insufferable failure of a movie on the presence of not one, but two Dicaprios. So why is it that, even though the individual ingredients of fruitcake are generally palatable, the final product is so repulsive? Abilene, a moody, pensive outfit from Chicago benefits from a cohesion and synergy that elevate them far above the working of their individual components. Gerard Depardieu and Rasheed Wallace take note. For a trio, Abilene fill a great deal of space, and for the simplicity of their guitar/drums/bass arrangement, they're a remarkably dynamic group. They're busy, yet, at the same time, exemplars of the less-is-more school of songwriting. The seedy, post-rock noir of the album's opening track, ""Detroit Locker,"" utilizes a quirky time signature and sparse, hushed vocals while relying heavily on the constant ting-ting of the ride cymbal and a sharp, foreboding guitar riff. This 35-minute, six-song semi-album was recorded by Bill Skibbe, and Juan Carrera of the lamentably long-defunct Warmers from Washington, D.C. But lest you assume otherwise, Abilene aren't as fixated on the D.C. sound, coming off more like a less self-consciously art-oriented ""Chicago band."" Even at their relaxed, stoner tempo, Abilene kind of rock. The oil that keeps this act running is, without a doubt, its mood. The music, even in its most rhythmically jagged moments, sways in slow, opioid motions. Credit the sound mixing for this effect. When not carrying on a melody of its own, the warm, well-phrased bass parts are buried deep in the mix, just loud enough to anchor the guitar parts, but never enough to infringe on Scott Adamson's bright, expressive drumming. ""October"" is perhaps the album's best moment from a sonic perspective. Only towards the song's end are the players allowed to come together at full volume to create a climactic din and provide a supporting fabric for a rare instance of yelling by Alex Dunham. Abilene brings to mind June of 44, and to some degree, its off-shoot the Letter E; it recalls the quiet but tenser moments of the former, and does so well what the latter could never pull of at all. A veritable musical gelding, the Letter E has, to date, sounded sterile, bloodless and totally devoid of passion; Abilene resides at the opposite end of the quality spectrum, playing a similarly ""jammy"" brand of music, but one that conveys feeling and a unified stance. And there are very few vocals here, so it goes without saying that I'm not talking about a lyrical or philosophical stance. The instruments do seem to be ""speaking"" from the same place, functioning organically, and displaying a unity of purpose. The songs all have a strong sense of drama, nice interesting shapes, and a sort of narrative quality to them, too. All that said, this is just a taste of, hopefully, more impressive things to come. So far, the trio has only shown that they work very well together. Though Dunham's vocals are pleasant and judiciously spaced, you sometimes get the feeling that the low sound levels are meant to mask his shortcomings rather than create a dramatic effect. The music has enough going for it to pique my interest and is strong enough in its execution to warrant respect. I hope they keep following whatever it is that brought them to this point to a more confidently delineated musical identity.","The Portland Trailblazers, Christmas fruitcakes, and the cast ofThe Man in the Iron Mask all suffer from the same ...

Accepted Eclectic,Aceyalone,by: David M. Pecoraro,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/59299fec5e6ef9596931fe32/1:1/w_160/f417d742.gif,2000-12-31 06:00:08,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17-accepted-eclectic/,Project Blowed,"A word of advice to all would-be musicians: the manifesto, while it has certainly proved its worth to terrorists and psychopaths alike, may be one literary form to steer clear of when slapping together that first album. Just ask veteran MC Aceyalone. Aceyalone has made a career as something of a hip-hop missionary. In 1991, he appeared on a scene flooded with gangsta-rap wannabes as a member of the L.A.-based Freestyle Fellowship. The Fellowship would eventually grow to the status of underground legends by pushing the limits of the form, criticizing hip-hop's increasing commercialization, and choosing social criticism as a lyrical subject over the romanticizing of violence so popular at the time. On 1998's Book of Human Language, Aceyalone raised his greatest challenge to those who would continue to pigeonhole his chosen art form. Structured as the sort of dark fairy tale one might find in an antique volume in the far corners of some rustic library, Book of Human Language was a stunningly dark and brooding foray into the twisted mind of a brilliant wordsmith, each song unfolding like a chapter over music culled primarily from old jazz cuts. Back in those days, Aceyalone reveled in his role as a poet-laureate of the hip-hop world, spitting out lines like, ""I'd rather stimulate your mind than emulate your purpose/ And we have only touched on the surface of the serpent,"" sprinkling his verse with literary allusion. Accepted Eclectic opens with a challenge to ""all you shallow rappers/ Bottom of the bottle rappers/ Spit and swallow rappers/ Hollow rappers/ Love to follow rappers."" Appropriately enough, Aceyalone's greatest competition turns out to be himself. While above par when compared to most recent releases from the hip-hop underground, Accepted Eclectic cannot hope to compare to its creator's previous works. Not only does Eclectic lack the cohesiveness that made Human Language such a stunning listen, but the songs seem tossed off in comparison. While tunes like ""Five Feet,"" a rant against those who invade the personal space of others, are certainly amusing, they hardly pack the same punch as the introspective rhymes that occupied his other efforts. ""Give me five feet all around the world/ I don't want nobody touchin' me unless it's my girls,"" is a great rhyme, provided verses like, ""The more I look around, the more it hurts/ I quietly go berserk when I work/ Hoping to find that part of my mind/ That's mostly confined and blind,"" haven't been swimming around your head for three years. Indeed, it's hard to believe three years of work went into Eclectic. Not only are the backing tracks sparse and cartoonish, the carefully chosen drumbeats of earlier albums are replaced with generic drum machines that could have been pulled off any mediocre hip-hop album in the bargain bin. It also lacks a cohesive theme to bring one song into the next. Eclectic is hardly a bad album, though. Even these seemingly phoned-in rhymes offer more playfulness and insight than those of many of his better-known contemporaries. And there are still those moments where his ingenuity shines through. Take ""Master Your High,"" in which Aceyalone mocks those unaware of their own limits. ""First you start mumbling/ Then you start stumbling/ Then your motor skills start malfunctioning/ Could it be the intake/ Of the chemical that makes your body shake?"" The stupendous ""Hardship"" offers the only real glimpse of Aceyalone's introspective rhymes of lore. Not only is the musical accompaniment the only place where the album's seven (yes, seven!) producers comes close to matching producer Mumbles' intricate arrangements on Human Language, but it's reassuring to hear Aceyalone pontificating like he once did: ""Some people, they live life inside a glass case/ Some people, they live life in the vastness of space/ And others will live long at a snail's pace/ I live with hardship slapping me in the face."" Pavement's Stephen Malkmus endured similar criticism when his solo debut failed to continue in the experimental vein his former band had been heading prior to its demise. But Malkmus' love for the project and the joy brought about by his newfound musical freedom shone through. Sadly, the same cannot be said for Aceyalone. Accepted Eclectic comes across as second-rate. Sure, it's often funny, and occasionally exciting, but ultimately, the attention to detail inherent in previous works has been marked absent. All this brings up the ages old argument: when an artist has created work that can only be called revolutionary, should his later efforts be held up against the work of his peers, or should his previous work be used as fodder for judgment? The question is still up in the air. But Aceyalone's case, he's asked for it. It's right there, in pure manifesto form, on the opening track of the very first Freestyle Fellowship album: ""Acknowledging rap as an art form, we break the rules and set new standards in the arena by experimenting in tonal and harmonic inflections and sporadic pitch changes and deliveries. We'll stir your emotion and take rap music to its threshold of enlightenment.""","A word of advice to all would-be musicians: the manifesto, while it has certainly proved its worth to terrorists and ...

From Here to Infirmary,Alkaline Trio,by: John Dark,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a049c0084474cd0bfb27/1:1/w_160/0568061d.gif,2000-12-31 06:00:07,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/110-from-here-to-infirmary/,Vagrant,"See, I have high blood pressure. I've had it for ten years, actually, but only recently did I do something about it. My meal plan in college was couch change and 49-cent tacos. I don't get much exercise, either. Although the other day I did play a very strenuous game of street hockey against some neighborhood 10 year-olds who appeared to be in excellent cardiovascular health. The worst part is my wife; she's so overly concerned about my condition: ""You're going to die,"" ""Don't forget your Accupril,"" and, ""Here, eat this celery and rice cake casserole I made for you,"" have all been in heavy rotation around my place. I don't care what fucking Martha Stewart says, you cannot bake celery. So I'm getting real tired of what's good for me. Eating right, driving safe. Even listening to gourmet music. It's all starting to blur: is it the genius of tofu and the healthiness of Sonic Youth or the other way around? There's quite a bit that Alkaline Trio's music is not. It's not challenging, ambitious, or visionary. It's not clever or self-aware. It's not even terribly skillful. But what it is, is tasty. Pure musical junk food: fast, greasy, and crafted for a general palate. Some people can't bring themselves to ever go to a fast food joint once they've tasted better. Others, like me, well... we shouldn't, but we do, anyway. Already known for playing paradoxically dour but upbeat pop/punk, the Trio, dive a little deeper and darker on From Here to Infirmary than on previous efforts. But even with an obsidian sheen, they still play catchy, riff-saturated edgy pop. A dozen tracks of it, if that's what you're craving. Admittedly, some of the music is a tad too derivative for your average rock snob. The riffs on ""You're Dead"" are pretty suggestive of the mid-90's Everclear hit ""Fire Maple Song."" And ""Private Eye"" opens with tonal qualities borrowed from the Bossanova sessions. The band often hits the mark in their lyrical imagery, though. Not necessarily whole lines of brilliance, but just the smallest turn of phrase. Snippets like, ""Sense DNA on barbed wire fences,"" and, ""Drank my insides raisin dry"" demonstrate that they can write with restraint rather than aiming to shoot their lyrical wad all at once on a grand, poetic angst manifesto (and failing, no doubt). Occasionally, however, the Trio jar you back to reality with bonehead moves like spelling out the very, very thinly-disguised metaphor in one song for the listener. Not only was it obvious to the most casual ear, but the repeated outro, ""In case you're wondering/ I'm singing about growing up,"" in ""Mr. Chainsaw"" only serves to draw attention to itself and the fact that we weren't wondering... at all. Another comical moment is the bits of Colin Hay vocals that slip into Matt Skiba's singing on ""I'm Dying Tomorrow."" But for all its flaws, From Here to Infirmary remains nothing more than simply what it is: tuneful, consumable, and guiltily satisfying. Sometimes you just have to put regard for your own well-being aside and consume what you want, even if you know it's bad. Even if you just read Fast Food Nation. Go on, have that triple whopper. After all, it's only here for a limited time.","See, I have high blood pressure. I've had it for ten years, actually, but only recently did I do ...

If You Happy With You Need Do Nothing,Alfie,by: Brent DiCrescenzo,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a045b1335d7bf1697fa9/1:1/w_160/3f28feef.gif,2000-12-31 06:00:06,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/106-if-you-happy-with-you-need-do-nothing/,Twisted Nerve,"Alfie, though continuing the deplorable Brit trend of naming bands after proper male names, overcome the associative images of Michael Caine and a midget in a hairy orange alien suit to create impressionist folk music that prioritizes fiddling with the bells and whistles-- at times literally-- over troubadour tradition. In American hands (and more specifically Athenian, Georgian hands), music of this ilk would wander into Brian Wilson's territory. But the Anglo angle leans more toward Syd Barrett and Fairport Convention. Woodwinds bleat. Dewy pianos twinkle. Bare guitars tiptoe. Harmonies ooze and fade. Sunny Day Real Estate frontman Jeremy Enigk flirted with similar sounds on his 1996 solo album, Return of the Frog Queen, before taking the path-- one Pink Floyd and Henry Cow blazed decades ago-- into prog. The grammatically mangled If You Happy With You Need Do Nothing collects the lite, sylvan psych singles Alfie have released to date on Badly Drawn Boy's Twisted Nerve label. And though never reaching the levels of attempted irony and wit (or the hooks) of the Boy, Alfie nevertheless wear wool hats and weave album covers of corduroy. The aural chamomile commences with ""Bookends,"" making the prerequisite reading references. Fortunately, there are no songs of tea or sheep, but farms and rain are covered in the Alfie syllabus. Simple strings and chimes establish the mood with a relieving yawn. ""It's Just About the Weather"" shaves the hair off Gomez's back and throat to reveal a more tolerable rural emotion hoe-down. It's impossible to play in the lanes of lithe acoustic music with violins, pianos, and tambourines in the northern United Kingdom without sideswiping Belle and Sebastian. ""2 Up 2 Down"" does just that, strumming clean guitars like ukuleles with the dog-eared corners of Far from the Madding Crowd and punctuating with bike bell percussion. The second side opens more interestingly with the Flaming Lips-like ""Umlaut,"" where drug-cracked symphonies stomp lightly alongside crashing brass. ""Check the Weight"" tries on the fashionable baggy loops of the Beta Band, and the closing ""Montevideo"" chirps with wristwatch electronics. The beauty lies in the details, which, while comforting and ear-piquing, offers merely relaxing vacations rather than environments which beg to be inhabited. Alfie treat folk like mood music, and might slip through this current ""quiet"" trend by hiding their true colors under heavy coats, hunched shoulders, and closed eyelids. Ol' Mum was onto something when she nagged, ""Speak clearly! Mind your posture!"" Hopefully, they'll rip open the rain-soaked cardboard on their debut LP.","Alfie, though continuing the deplorable Brit trend of naming bands after proper male names, overcome the associative images of Michael ...

'Neath the Puke Tree EP,Smog,by: Matt LeMay,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a47fea9e61561daa4f06/1:1/w_160/cb224db0.gif,2000-12-31 06:00:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7282-neath-the-puke-tree-ep/,Drag City,"When I was younger, I always displayed a penchant for botany. So much, in fact, that I had the entire plant world broken up into three botanical classifications. There were the ""things that go ouch,"" such as stinging nettles and briar, ""things that make itch,"" like poison oak and poison ivy, and ""things that smell bad,"" like the cat pee-smelling ailanthus, and the vomit-smelling, fruit-bearing female ginkgo tree. Granted, I was working within a very limited geographical scale. The world outside the Northeastern United States undoubtedly contains many, many more prickly, poisonous, and smelly plants than I've encountered. For me, a puke tree will forever be a female ginkgo, but I get the distinct feeling that God's green earth is home to many, many more plants that smell like vomit. When I first saw Smog's new 'Neath the Puke Tree EP, I immediately assumed that the EP's title alluded to the ginkgo. But then I looked on the back of the jewel case, and noticed that the EP was recorded in Melbourne, Australia, a place that is no doubt home to more puke-scented flora than even New York City. But that's not the only level on which I'm failing to connect to this record. For the first time in a while, I'm starting to get the feeling that Bill Callahan's instincts aren't working to his advantage-- a scary and depressing thought, considering the amazingly consistent body of work he's produced in the past decade. 'Neath the Puke Tree has a decidedly more country feel to it than Callahan's past work. And no, I don't mean ""alt-country,"" with its twanging Telecasters and torn denim jackets. There's a serious, old-school country influence at work here, especially on the EP's opener, ""I Was a Stranger"". Utilizing a simple but effective motif of strummed acoustic guitar, relatively straightforward drumming, and flourishes of slide guitar, the track effectively paints a dusty picture of a sun-drenched desert that would be very much at home in modern-day western music. Breaking slightly away from this formula, the record's second track is its standout. Barren and desolate, ""Your Sweet Entrance"" is classic Smog, full of vague romantic longing as expressed through Bill Callahan's claustrophobic vocals. It also contains one of the most masterfully executed weirdo chord changes I've heard in ages. Unfortunately, at about this point, Callahan seems to have forgotten the first rule of recording sparse, guitar-driven ballads: tune the fucking thing! ""A Jar of Sand"" could be a great track for all I know, but I just can't get past the fact that his guitar is so painfully out of tune. I'm not sure what would be worse: if the guitar were out of tune due to general laziness, or due to a shoddy attempt at adding an ""experimental"" feel to the track. Either way, it's not any fun, and makes what would otherwise be a perfectly listenable couple of tracks (this and the fourth track, ""Orion Obscured by Stars"", are both plagued by this problem) unbearable. Yet, even with these few thoroughly frustrating tracks, 'Neath the Puke Tree manages to yank itself out of the abyss in time for its closer, the swampy ""Coacheecayoo"". After having this EP on repeat play for a few hours, I'm feeling three conflicting emotions. First, I'm frustrated that Bill Callahan didn't bother tuning the damn guitar (we've established that, right?). Secondly, I'm grateful that this isn't a full-length, because even though it's at times really likable, none of the tracks have the same punch as the better of Smog's album tracks. Finally, I'm hoping that my two major gripes with this EP won't carry over to the next full-length. I mean, shit, maybe it's just really hard to find a tuning fork in Melbourne.","When I was younger, I always displayed a penchant for botany. So much, in fact, that I had the entire ...

Parts Water,Safety Scissors,by: Paul Cooper,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a3329d034d5c69bf2d6f/1:1/w_160/83ef8e9d.gif,2000-12-31 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6965-parts-water/,Plug Research,"Safety Scissors is one of several monikers chosen by Minneapolis-born, San Francisco resident Matthew Patterson Curry. And in this case, the alias is wholly appropriate. Parts Water is essentially a glitch-dub album with occasional vocals. But just as the round-edged scissors that are given to kindergartners to cut out construction paper shapes are, for the most part, blunt, Curry has blunted and de-hazarded glitch music as we know it. Like his peers, Kit Clayton and Sutekh's Seth Horvitz, Curry believes that glitch could stand to be incorporated into genres other than dub (I'm looking at you, Stefan Betke). The most visible manifestation of this interpolation of glitch is, of course, Björk's Vespertine. But even though, like Vespertine, Parts Water sports Curry's untarnished, self-sung vocal tracks, the album is also easily likened to Herbert's masterful Bodily Functions. No, Parts Water doesn't go all out for the dancefloor like Bodily Functions generally does, but it hints that, with some minor remixing, he could find himself the creator of several dancefloor staples. Parts Water opens with ""Two Letter U's,"" in which Curry applies his sonic malfunctions to a slow go-go swing, and contrasts a loping swagger with a stuttering Hammond organ figure. ""A Wash"" opens with guitar twangs tugged at by glitches, until a horn imposes rhythmic order and ushers in the gospel organ that flourishes towards the end of the track. Curry turns to glitch balladry for ""Stormy Weather,"" using vocal treatments similar to the ones Herbert messed with on Bodily Functions. Harpsichordian sounds tinkle in and out of the mix as Curry inserts the same terse hi-hat sounds that characterized Neil Landstrumm's Bedrooms and Cities. Disconcerting harmonic wobbles are then allowed to breach the meniscus of the melody as Curry sings a heartfelt admonition: ""So don't make up your mind/ Your vision may be cloudy/ So now is not the time/ We're in for stormy weather/ I feel it in my knees."" With the bass drum barely even a presence, ""7 Glasses a Day/7 Days a Week"" relies on Landstrumm's taut percussion set to propel the track. Under the trebly rhythms, an intoxicated Basic Channel-style organ pokes around, only to be accosted by a marauding band of dub echoes. ""Your Beautiful Feet"" begins with calm tones and a stuttering bass guitar. Then, after Curry reveals himself in disconsolate vocals (""I'm a puddle/ Down on the street/ Watch where you're standing/ I'm six feet deep""), wobbly chords bubble up from beneath to replace the gentle keyboard's song. Though glitch-bossa makes its debut on ""Esperanto,"" Curry returns to the fuzzy dub of Pole for the drifting clunks of ""Before (Less)."" On ""(Water)phone,"" he sings surrealism about waiting for someone to pick up the phone he's dialing. After a scratchy miniature, lo-lo-lo-fi New Order-ish guitar joins the fray and Curry concludes that the person he wants to talk to is in the shower, and that the running water is drowning him. Curious. But the aquatic theme that permeates Parts Water is never more prominent than during ""Sailor Stripes""-- a viscous melody figure swims through shards of sub-surface sunlight, like some winding eel searching for a plankton which is represented by fragments of human humming. ""Dipsy Daisy"" stays submerged in Curry's ocean, but for once, he allows his kickdrums to pound, taunting them that they can break the surface and make it to dry land without a remixer's assistance, but only when he permits it. After the upbeat, cowbell-driven ""Slipper,"" Parts Water closes with ""Mirror (Wet)."" The track not only reprises most of Curry's lyrical concerns (""I drank all the water I can drink/ I can't drink anymore/ My eyes are floating in my head"") but also the deft incorporation of glitch-dub into unexpected song forms. What impresses me above all about ""Mirror (Wet)"" is that Curry has written chord progressions and intriguing melodies that I've come to associate with his labelmate, Low Res. ""Mirror (Wet)"" could have been one of the terran tunes the extra-terrestrials captured on Res' Approximate Love Boat, the Plug Research release that first alerted me to the possibilities of applied glitch. However, Parts Water stands apart. Surely, we must afford Curry the same laurels we've bestowed upon Matthew Herbert and Björk.","Safety Scissors is one of several monikers chosen by Minneapolis-born, San\n\ Francisco resident Matthew Patterson Curry.

Second Nature,All Natural,by: Sam Eccleston,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a04d5e6ef9596931fefa/1:1/w_160/48b973b0.gif,2000-12-31 06:00:03,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/115-second-nature/,Thrill Jockey,"The beauty of hip-hop, as it reaches ever-higher levels of cultural significance and societal approbation, is that it still remains a storyteller's medium. Even the most textural backdrops are always based around human voices saying human words. Where rock bands of various stripes head farther and farther out into the realm of poncy abstraction, hip-hop narrows its scope. The best MCs-- save those meandering, fine-art fans in the Anticon camp-- are driven by precision, detail and narrative skill. But however weird the backing track might become, there's always a person up front, speaking. What divides the underground from the mainstream, then, isn't so much the level of experimentation as the choice of narrational tone. Where the can-you-top-this tower of mainstream braggadocio is bound to eventually topple over, the rapidly surfacing regional scenes that compose the alternative maintain high levels of heavily personal weirdness or a degree of honest, searching levelheadedness that's astonishing to hear in the hyperbolic world of popular song. All Natural-- MC Capital D and DJ Tone B Nimble-- clearly fancy themselves a fairly traditional battle-rap combo. None of the band's post-rocking labelmates pitched in ambient marimba soundscapes on Second Nature; most of the production sounds like a more obvious Wu-Tang, or veers into Native Tongues-style jazz suites. Fitting in with all this straightforwardness, Capital D and his various compatriots sling verses about how good they are at rapping-- especially in light of how crappy you and your sucka friends are. And able as they are at this kind of stuff, there's an added bonus involved: All Natural can't hide how smart they are. Aside from the various introspective asides sprinkled throughout the tougher tracks, plenty of songs here take up issues of note. ""Vegetarians"" is about avoiding stupid conflicts, while acknowledging the tricky temptations of manliness. Elsewhere, the band takes up issues of class, race, and how fucked up rap is in the '01. Most extraordinarily, Capital D takes a good, long time to address a topic that the grime-obsessed freestyle union usually shies away from: it's a quiet, ruminative paean about how good it actually is to be alive. That very quality, though, sometimes gets the band in trouble. All Natural's utterly unassuming nature keeps them from stretching too hard, allowing them to retread stuff any hip-hop fan has heard elsewhere. There's nothing wrong with hanging out in the background, perfecting a craft, and letting the world make of it what it will. But when a group's lyrical engine is this flexible, it's a shame that the beats themselves don't stretch as far as they might. Still, like the old Greil Marcus-penned adage says, sometimes it's enough for music to remind you that there are still people in the world you might like to meet.","The beauty of hip-hop, as it reaches ever-higher levels of cultural significance and societal approbation, is that it still remains ...

The Impossible Thrill,Alpha,by: Rich Juzwiak,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a06013d1975652138388/1:1/w_160/19c2133d.gif,2000-12-31 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/132-the-impossible-thrill/,AstralwerksMelankolic,"Like most people, I hate being bored. I'm shackled to whim, a slave to fancy, perpetually impatient, high strung, and terrified of tedium. As a makeshift cure, I've developed an attention span that rivals a hyperactive prepubescent Christian Scientist. It's not ideal, but at least I'm occupied most of the time. Of course, the key word there is ""most."" Snags are hit every time I'm forced to stand in hellish lines, endure overlong anecdotes from friends and strangers alike, and withstand multiple listens of records I would otherwise turn off before the first track was finished. Alpha's sophomore album, The Impossible Thrill, is emblematic of the latter example. If having to write about Bristolian trip-hop is taxing, having to listen to it enough to get to that step is brutal-- especially when the material in question makes unintentional strides toward epitomizing dullness. By bombarding the listener with innocuousness, Alpha forge a test to determine exactly when the pedestrian becomes excruciating. By the third track, they more or less have their answer. The Impossible Thrill is so pig-headed in its goal to evoke mood that conventions like variation, song structure and memorable songwriting are completely forgone. The album's redundancy is particularly inappropriate because of its premise. Instead of continuing on a beat-heavy, electronic path to atmosphere, Alpha employ mostly live instrumentation to augment the rich, bluesy arrangements. Layers of strings glaze the songs, and are heavily depended upon to set the dour, spacy tone. The Impossible Thrill sifts through the constituents of pop trip-hop, exploits its darkness, and ultimately lacks any semblance of groove. A song stringed as manipulatively as ""Dim"" plays like a reject Blaxploitation theme. And, when the occasional dank beat from a drum machine does pop up, like on ""South,"" it only retreads the same sterile fare we've heard a million times before from artists like Hooverphonic and Morcheeba. The vocalists on the record, Helen White, Wendy Stubbs, and Martin Barnard, only contribute to the drabness. The interchangeable White and Stubbs both exhibit the conviction of mumbling somnambulists. Though aiming to recall a more drugged-out Beth Gibbons, the two never muster anything greater than ""wispy."" Barnard's approach is more affected, but just as unmoving. With the vocals low in the mix, it's hard to hear exactly what he's (seemingly) complaining about. And, when the rest of the content is taken into account, it's even harder to care. The Impossible Thrill is utterly pedestrian and overwrought. Though the songs are mostly composed gracefully, with each part impeccably interlocking, this ultimately can't erase the record's inherent mundaneness. But at least the album lives up to its name; with the knowledge that the thrill is indeed unattainable, it's clear that adventure is best sought in virtually any other outlet.","Like most people, I hate being bored.

The Scene's Out of Sight,Actionslacks,by: Ryan Schreiber,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Founder</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/59299ffc5e6ef9596931fe5c/1:1/w_160/49a74796.gif,2000-12-31 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/33-the-scenes-out-of-sight/,Self-Starter Foundation,"The Self-Starter Foundation imprint is far from prolific-- their website even proudly announces, ""Averaging almost two records a year since 1995""-- but the records they choose to release range from above average to beyond great. On one side of the fence, there are the winners: Les Savy Fav's first two albums and Lifter Puller's Fiestas and Fiascos; on the other, there are the decent: Haywood's Men Called Him Mister and Enduro's Half Rack of Sugar. Actionslacks' The Scene's Out of Sight falls somewhere in the middle. Though not nearly as innovative as the art-punk onslaught of Les Savy Fav, Actionslacks' only aim is to make great pop music. Their sights aren't set on pushing music to new peaks; they just want to satiate the pop-deprived with solid hooks and charged delivery. And where so many of their indie pop contemporaries fall victim to asinine, three-chord rehashing and inept guitarwork, Actionslacks overcome with a fierce intensity and inspired songwriting. The J Robbins-produced The Scene's Out of Sight is the third for the Berkeley, California-based foursome, and betters both its predecessors-- the Skene!-released Too Bright, Just Right, Goodnight from 1996, and 1998's One Word on Arena Rock-- in every respect. The guys are considerably more confident now than on past outings, and they have every right to be; drummer Marty Kelly pulls off complicated fills effortlessly while bassist Ross Murray interplays complex rhythmic structures with singer/guitarist Tim Scanlin's plucked steel strings. Even Scanlin's lyrics have grown up over the years. Sure, he'll still stumble over SweeTart prose like, ""Tonight we're gonna scrape the sky,"" but what he lacks in poetic genius he makes up for in melody. If there's a complaint to be made about The Scene's Out of Sight, it's that being berated with stories of scenesterism and tour vans gets tired after a while. Surely, there are more important things in life than how many stickers you can slap on newspaper dispensers and the number of shows you went to last week. But power-pop lyrics are renowned for their genericism, and simply put, they're just not the point. If nothing else, these guys are a hell of a lot more skilled with the pen than better-knowns like the Get Up Kids and the Promise Ring. The Scene's Out of Sight isn't going to change anyone's life, and thankfully, it wasn't meant to. Actionslacks are more than satisfied assaulting ""the kids"" with their blissful, high-energy performances. And with their most competent album to date for sale at the merch table, it looks like the guys'll be riding the music geek fantasy for at least another five years. Which is really all a Californian power-pop band can ask for.","The Self-Starter Foundation imprint is far from prolific-- their website even proudly announces, ""Averaging almost two records a year since ...

Versus the World,Action Time,by: John Dark,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/59299ffbb1335d7bf1697f06/1:1/w_160/9c83591f.gif,2000-12-31 06:00:00,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/32-versus-the-world/,Southern,"You'll rarely find me preaching atop the soapbox of originality. I never bought into the idea that just because something hasn't been done before means it has an inherent advantage over excellent but derivative work. Spurious logic, if you ask me. The Action Time is a co-ed London sextet that are too busy nurturing and their free-spirited scorn at everything in the world to be bothered with establishmentarian concepts like ""originality."" They wallow in the anger and attitude of youth, living through the personas they've created for themselves: Susie Sparkles, Miss Spent Youth, Black September, CC Rider, etc. I picture them spending lots of time practicing walking down the street together with a synchronized, ganglike swagger. The fuck-all attitude-- contrived or sincere, who cares?-- comes across perfectly in their music. I never even questioned the motives behind their rage. Good for them. They're young; they'll grow out of it someday. Whether they're nicking the cracked screech of Joe Strummer or referencing icons of revolutionary Black literature like Eldridge Cleaver and James Baldwin in the titles of songs (""Soul on Ice"" and ""The Fire Next Time,"" respectively), the Action Time have made their debut album their pastiche manifesto, their vent at their myriad enemies. Versus the World opens with the call-to-arms ""Soul on Ice,"" a fiery fusillade of raw, distorted guitar tempered by retro keyboard accents and an overall Phil Spector girl-group dynamic. A bit later, the Action Time offer up the pure, full-tilt fun of tit-for-tat vocals in ""Stranded on a Lonely Planet."" September engages in a sassy dialogue with Sparkles and Miss Spent Youth on top of a distorted grind that urges people into doing early '60s dances. The other superlative is the made-for-a-single old-wave sound of ""(We're Just) Killing Time."" The raging guitars yield briefly and slightly in favor of some keyboard squealing and sweet vocals about proletariat alienation. With climbing melodies and the reverb on overkill, ""Stay in the Car"" feels like a RockATeens outtake. After this early misstep, the pace doesn't falter again until the last couple of songs. But Versus the World ends with two consecutive duds, one of which, ""I Will Fear No Evil,"" is a good example of the road not taken: it's a poor execution of the ideas that they've already spent the record proving they can tackle. Bringing to bear the scrutiny of the audiophile on Versus the World would almost surely result in disappointment. It's sloppy music, all heart and no technique. Yet, when listening to the Action Time, the old feel older, and the conservative more conservative. All by virtue of considering the chasmic distance between where you are now, and the embarrassments, audacities, idealism and consequence-less fun of youth that the Action Time embody. But as youth, they couldn't care less. And then sometime during the third or fourth listen, you suddenly don't, either; it's enough that they're reckless and self-important.","You'll rarely find me preaching atop the soapbox of originality.

Peel Session 2 EP,Autechre,by: Ryan Kearney,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a1489d034d5c69bf2911/1:1/w_160/d32b3a18.gif,2000-12-12 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/360-peel-session-2-ep/,Warp,"""Odi et amo,"" reads a famous epigram by the Latin poet Catullus. ""quare id faciam fortasse requiris? nescio sed fieri sentio et excrucior."" Translating, with some artistic license, as, ""I hate and love [Autechre]. Perhaps you're asking why I do that? I don't know, but I feel it happening, and am racked."" Of course, Catullus didn't have Autechre in mind when he wrote this poem, but I had this poem in mind when I heard Peel Session 2. Generally, I love Rob Brown and Sean Booth, the English duo that comprises Autechre. But at the moment I hate them and am exhausted, because I have to describe their sound. Nearly every comparison the critics use to describe Autechre seems terribly desperate, from architecture to computer source code to virtual landscapes. But this is not by any fault of the critic. The difficulty of Autechre's music is surpassed only by the difficulty of describing it. Nonetheless, the attempt must be made, so critics invariably use any number of the following words: blips, bleeps, farts, echoes, sparkle, skitter, clanks, pulses, drone, chopped, synapses, and on and on. These words may as well be Latin. But rest assured, I'm no different: plenty of them undoubtedly will appear below. And so the inevitable attempt, however futile, begins. This four-song, 27-minute EP, which was originally broadcast on September 9, 1999, opens with ""Gelk."" (It should be noted that the song titles were chosen by John Peel because the audio masters delivered to Radio 1 contained none.) The track begins calmly with a trotting beat, analog hiss, and an occasional bass pulse that raises static as if the music were played through blown speakers. Foreign synths chime in, and a piano descends into the sonic plane just as the keyboards turn intergalactic, flickering out of earshot in perpetual reverberation. But nothing too surprising. Then ""Gelk"" turns ominous. Deep synths set the dark tone, but the thickened beat, no longer clean now but crackling and popping, sends the song into the dungeon. Given the gurgling and indecipherable whispering, there must a deformed creature down here, maybe Sloth or the Gimp. The song soon strips down to one single sound, which most nearly resembles someone plucking the low strings of a grand piano. A more standard beat ends the interlude, as does what might as well be considered electronic steel drums, and soon the track is washed over by distant crashes, like Godzilla and King Kong playing soccer with a Zildjian delivery truck. When it finally ends, you realize you've almost run the full gamut of emotion. The next three tracks, unfortunately, aren't quite as varied or complex. Before you can even digest ""Gelk,"" the raucous ""Blifil"" breaks in with a more furious and uneven beat, thick drones, and muffled, chopped vocals. But the song barely progresses from there; the only other significant addition is droplets of digital water. Still, by the end of the track, one does sense that, over the course of seven minutes, Autechre have taken you from an underground dig to an extraterrestrial voyage. The clacks that open ""Gaekwad"" consistently stutter and fizzle out like a spinning coin coming to rest. Other sounds reminiscent of creaking doors and radiators fill in the background noise. More steel drum-like notes and ghostly ambient whines keep the ear trailing along, and eventually, trebled beats skip in to carry the tune. When mellow synths, orchestral stutters, and high-pitched pings achieve melody over the skittering beat, Peel Session 2 achieves its most Aphex-like moment. But the cackling and wheezing that soon interrupt make this the only obvious and direct comparison on the EP. Then there's the aptly-titled ""19 Headaches."" Some might say it's avant-IDM, but isn't IDM avant enough? I say it's Brown and Booth doing their best Phish impression-- digital jamming, if you will. The same skittering sounds are here, in addition to a synth straight out of ""3-2-1 Contact."" Sounds chirp into the foreground like pikas popping their heads out of a rock bed. Like these small, darting mammals, ""19 Headaches"" is at first interesting, then uncompelling, and finally, annoying. This effort could almost be called lo-fi drill-n-bass, if there were such a thing. Perhaps their grittiest work to date, the EP is always worn raw by fuzz, static, or hiss-- a sharp contrast to the clarity of efforts such as Tri Repetae++, which rests on the opposite end of Autechre's oeuvre. Still, although Peel Session 2 is uneven and oftentimes bears similarity to their less-popular work (Chiastic Slide and EP7, for instance), we should nonetheless consider ourselves fortunate that, unlike Latin, this music has yet to bastardized out of existence.","""Odi et amo,"" reads a famous epigram by the Latin poet Catullus.

While it seems to suggest some kind of rational, mathematical explanation of chaos, it's really just a qualitative study, examining the properties of a system in a state of flux. The most well-known application of chaos lies in the fractal, an ever-repeating geometric pattern based not on traditional shapes, but on complex, non-linear shapes. Everything is offset by an immeasurable and elusive factor. And yet, out of the chaos, can come something as beautiful as a mandlebrot. The chaos theory has been put to work for everything ranging from telecommunications to washing machines that use fuzzy logic circuits to attempt to untangle clothes moving in a chaotic fashion. Chaos theory and fractals have also been applied to music-- some of the algorithms that are used to create fractals have also been applied to the realm of sound. Unfortunately, the result is a complete disappointment when held up to the beauty of a fractal. But those trying to get the sounds of chaos down on record, take heart. Put away your theoretical physics textbooks and graphing calculators, and pick up a copy of Some Best Friend You Turned Out to Be. Max Tundra's latest effort is undeniable proof that a record can be chaotic without succumbing to dissonance. ""Cakes"" kicks off the album with an analog flute and snare drum segment that would be at home in a ""Legend of Zelda"" game. Seems innocent enough-- pleasant, but not that far from traditional electronic music. Soon, however, the song shifts its structure completely, employing a drum machine beat and a piano track that seem to have little, if anything, to do with each other musically. And when you think you've got the segment figured out, the drum machine gives way to a blissful synthesizer loop, and ambiguous drones call to you from beyond. Suddenly, as the song begins to shift back towards its second segment, an elephantine trumpet comes out of nowhere, blasting the track, and your expectations, to smithereens. The album's second track, ""Lamplite on a One Horse Shoe,"" opens with a seemingly random analog mantra. Like the greatest works of electronic minimalism, that relatively simple figure is built upon, added to, and transformed until it becomes something different, but retains a discernible similarity to its original. But the real beauty of Some Best Friend You Turned Out to Be isn't in its electronic segments, but in the fact that the album doesn't limit itself to electronic elements. Instead of creating a record using all analog synthesizers, all samplers, or all acoustic instruments, Max Tundra has crafted an album that uses all three. ""6161"" uses lo-fi, reverb-doused guitars, xylophones, and layer upon layer of crusty analog synthesizers to construct a sonic collage of mammoth proportions. But what makes the track truly stand out is the amazing melodic complexity demonstrated-- what seems like hundreds of individual, unrelated melodies adding up to an alarmingly cohesive whole. The 11-minute ""Carbon Cones"" serves as the perfect closer, and summary, of Some Best Friend You Turned Out to Be. At times explosive, at times meditative, and always putting to use an eclectic series of acoustic and synthetic instruments. Due to its at times overwhelming nature, it would be natural to put something here to the effect of ""this record is not for everyone."" But to say that would be ridiculous-- this is the kind of dynamic, creative record that should be heard by as many people as possible. Though it occasionally resembles electronic minimalism, Some Best Friend You Turned Out to Be is the first of its kind: a true maximalist record.","""Chaos theory"" is a deceptive term.

Flip a switch, twiddle a knob, 33 to 45, instant D&B.;"" Tell this to a junglist, and he'll bite a chunk out of your arm. Or, tell a punk that he's just listening to sped-up garage rock, or a hardcore devotee that his music is just even faster punk, and you'll be met with a similar response. It's both temptingly simple and degrading to these genres to suggest that the speed they're defined by is simply a variable that can be tweaked to produce another style. But what's often overlooked is how difficult tempo is to master; anyone who's ever been in a band can attest to the challenges involved in starting at the right speed and keeping a beat with three other people. And it's at the extremes of the tempo spectrum that some of the most musically thrilling artists reside, proving that speed can be seen not only as an aesthetic quality but also as a genuine aesthetic in itself. Take Tokyo, Japan's Melt-Banana, for instance. ""Free the Bee,"" the first track on the band's new album (somewhat unfortunately entitled Teeny Shiny) comes off as drum-n-bass. Until you realize the drumming is live, and that what you thought were samples of police sirens are actually guitarist Agata's high-pitched string twistings. The blindingly fast beat continues under a loopy guitar riff and vocalist Yasuko's barked rhymes, only to shift into an even higher gear when the crushing chorus hits. As on Melt-Banana's previous four LPs, speed is the rule here. Although continuing in the tradition of 1998's Charlie-- a savagely well-produced album that found the band's songs consistently stretching beyond the two-minute mark in search of more cohesive and varied song structures-- the band rediscovers the breathless energy of their earlier 25-song-apiece albums, Scratch or Stitch and Speak, Squeak, Creak. Yasuko neatly demonstrates that speed isn't a function of testosterone as she spits out syllables chosen more for their sound than their sense. Even when the main vocal or guitar part (the term ""melody"" doesn't quite fit) slows down, as on ""Lost in Mirror"" and ""Moon Flavor,"" the complex drum patterns churning underneath still seem detailed at the subatomic level. The brittle, martial rhythms provide the perfect counterpart to Agata's amazingly versatile guitar work, which can change from staccato skullfuck to elastic playfulness in an instant. In ""Third Attack,"" the guitarist imitates a turntable, a yappy little dog, and a power drill, all before the chorus kicks in. Agata's playing invites comparisons to Rage Against the Machine's Tom Morello, and Yasuko's fixation on Public Enemy and Cypress Hill would seem to tie the group to the ""rap-rock"" movement. Luckily, none of these comparisons come anywhere close to being accurate. Though influences can be picked out of Melt-Banana's sound (most immediately, hardcore and noise-rock), the end product is wholly unique, seeming to subsist purely in the speed at which their music is played. The band itself seems to be under a mortal imperative to work as fast as it can; the production certainly falls flat in comparison to Charlie, and it's a sure bet that the entire thing was slapped onto tape in a day or two between live shows. Their constant touring is usually attributed by fans to Agata's ""rare blood malady,"" an unspecified but eventually fatal condition that spurs the band to play as many live shows as they can together. These sources are a bit dubious; however, the guitarist fuels the rumors by wearing a surgical mask in concert. For someone like me, though, whose biggest speed fix comes from playing along with the ""fast money"" round on ""Family Feud,"" this rough taste of pure energy beats half an hour with Louie Anderson any day of the week.","""Drum-n-bass is just fast techno.

Lullaby of Clubland EP,Everything But the Girl,by: Paul Cooper,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bcbeeb335119a49ecd25/1:1/w_160/2f494adc.gif,2000-12-05 06:01:40,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2856-lullaby-of-clubland-ep/,AtlanticAtlantic,"Of course it's boutique music. You won't be able to dip niftily into Cole Haan for a pair of pumps without being brushed by Tracey Thorn's morose vocals or Ben Watt's primed-for-Lazy-Dog deep house setting. But why is it boutique music? What drives floor managers at Banana Republic to slide EBTG discs into the store system and expect the crepe de chine blouses to breeze out the store? Before hypothesizing on that one, I'd like to examine why ""Lullaby of Clubland"" and many other post-Missing EBTG songs are perfect disco. Disco's initial power was its diversity. Before the term denoted a style, it marked out a feeling. What was the common thread between Michael Olatunji's ""Drums of Passion"" and the Temptation' ""Cloud Nine?"" Though they might arguably share the same low-budget production values, they both reflect an underground sensation. After the 1969 Stonewall riots, when the love that still could not speak its name burst out onto the sidewalks and right in the public's dropped-jawed face, gay men found that they wanted to have tremendous fun together and be open about their lifestyle. The fact that, before then, any encounters had a distinctly clandestine buzz about them was admittedly mild arousing, but anyone so engaged could easily end up in a drunk tank or holding cell with some very unattractive bedmates. Juice bars and gay-owned establishments relished the newly grasped visibility and gave their clientele a place that wouldn't make them vulnerable to public scrutiny and loathing. The music that blasted out of these places was R&B;, heavy rock, psychedelic soul-- anything that had either an outsider vibe or a message of liberation and hope. It's no surprise that the flag of the queer nation is the rainbow of ""Somewhere Over the Rainbow"" promise. But soon, the price of visibility and exposure had to be paid, and the retreat kicked in-- just as the so-called gay plague began to rob cities like New York and San Francisco of their sons. At this very time, disco had become the monster that forced Rod Stewart and the Rolling Stones to fashion their own disco tunes just to appear au courant. Culture, like nature, obeys Newton's Third Law: for every action there's an equal an opposite reaction. Underground dance tunes still expressed hope, but now as more and more clubbers got sick, a cruel and stalking dramatic irony leaked into the uplifting grooves. No record expresses this ambivalent reality than Machine's ""There But for the Grace of God."" Other tunes, such as DC La Rue's almost tribal anthem, ""Cathedrals,"" express regret for past behaviors and a reticence to give those habits up entirely. This melancholy marks the second and more enduring wave of disco classics. Melancholy mixed into euphoric rump-shaking tunes is a potent force and one that speaks to our mortality. Of course, an entire night of songs about how there's a Hell below and we're all going to die would bum out even Kant's philosophical brain. But you can find a fine thread of this introspection in the songs of Pet Shop Boys and the turbine house of Felix da Housekatt. Everything But the Girl fit into this aesthetic perfectly. Before their conversion to club music, the duo's jazz-folk miserablism made them favorites for barflys who sank brews with Sade's Diamond Life in the background. The rest of us found their albums fussy, overly concerned with throwing jazz shapes, and way too art-schooly. But translate Thorn's lyrical preoccupations into a heavy house setting, and you're guaranteed to come up with club classic after club classic. It's all about the context, after all. Because of the winning juxtaposition of Thorn's moaning on about being a mixed-up lonely kid who can't even get a shag off a soaked beardy-weirdy jazznik, and some stylin' deep house, Everything But the Girl have been surrounded by folks who wouldn't have even pissed on them previously. How must they be grateful to Todd Terry for opening their ears to house! So why do you find yourself tearing up when shopping in Sephora? Is it because your arch-rival in eyeliner, Gabby Glickman, has sashayed off with the last bottle of ""No, I'm not really a waitress"" nail polish? Maybe. But more likely, the shrewd floor manager has put this disc on. You will part with money. You will have been targeted out for extreme credit card abuse. You will be sobbing not in spite of your appreciation of the inherent genius of EBTG's funky mopeyness, but directly because of it. Studies in fashion boutiques consistently prove that Tracey and Ben sell slingbacks. They also charm the pants off of me. But you wouldn't want to go near any of my fervidly discarded skootz, I assure you.","Of course it's boutique music. You won't be able to dip niftily into Cole Haan for a pair ...

Add Insult to Injury,Add N to (X),by: Matt LeMay,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a00dea9e61561daa449b/1:1/w_160/d61cdbb1.gif,2000-11-30 06:00:06,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/51-add-insult-to-injury/,Mute,"There was a time when I sneered at analog purists. Tucked away in my room, with my computer, CD player, and digital Casio keyboard, I laughed at the fools who wasted their cash on fuzzy-sounding crap that can be almost perfectly replicated by software. I would chuckle to myself whenever I saw some poor sap dropping a grand on a vintage keyboard. After all, for a mere 200 smackeroos, all the sounds on that big, bulky keyboard, along with many others, can be compacted onto a small, friendly CD-ROM. This summer, all that changed. I was at a Guitar Center in New Jersey, and I spotted a compact, odd-looking keyboard from across the room. That day, I fell in love with a 1985 Korg Poly-800, a bizarre digital-analog hybrid made immensely popular by its powerful circuitry and affordable price. That, and the pitch bend joystick. Mmmmm... As soon as I brought my new love object home, I immediately understood the appeal of analog, especially as it relates to the creation of bizarre, quirky sounds. Something about knob-twiddling, or even compulsive button-pushing, just seems much more conducive to creative sound creation than sitting in front of a computer and clicking repeatedly. If you don't believe me, check out Add N to (X)'s debut album, On the Wires of Our Nerves, or to a lesser extent, their second album, Avant Hard. On these two albums, especially the former, the three members of Add N to (X) seemed to have a complete grasp over the infinite orgasmic joy of the analog synthesizer. On these albums, abrasive, insane sounds were extracted from a variety of analog synth sources, making for some of the damned coolest electronic music to grace the 1990s. Unfortunately, the appeal of the analog synthesizer, like so many other toys, can't last forever. There are only so many parameters that can be edited, so many filters that can be applied, and so many oscillators that can be, uh, oscillated, before the newness wears off, and you find yourself seeking out ""new directions."" Uh-oh. Add Insult to Injury is the first Add N to (X) record to sound in the least bit forced. On both of their previous records, the plethora of amazing sounds incorporated, combined with some completely crazy ""songwriting,"" made for a truly exciting listen. Here, we see the group at a loss for new ideas and recycling strikingly similar melodies, sounds, and song structures over the course of 12 tracks. Add Insult to Injury's greatest weakness comes with the formula which seems to have generated about 1/3 of the songs on the album-- a vaguely surfish bassline, drums that would sound at home in cheesy 70's soundtracks, and sadly ambiguous synthesizer sounds. Yes, it's a cute formula, and it's in some ways more accessible than Add N to (X)'s earlier works. But there is a huge structural problem with this formula: by applying the same bass and drum backbone to slightly different songs, the awesome analog synthesizer noises that once constituted the bread and butter of the group's sound now seem to float aimlessly over the song, resulting in a disjointed mess. Despite this giant flaw, Add Insult to Injury does have a few exceptional moments. The funky ""Pokerole"" is one of the finest songs the group has penned, as is the album's single, the Bruce Haack-esque ""Plug Me In."" The album's closing track, ""The Regent is Dead,"" is also pretty cool, utilizing a fucked-up analog marching band sound and some high-pitched, squelching blasts of pure analog joy. So it turns out that Add Insult to Injury may be a more apt title than the group had planned. For those of you disappointed by Avant Hard, this record may very well be the final straw. It's sad to hear a group that once had so much potential descend on a slippery slope towards mediocrity. Thus, Add Insult to Injury serves as a disappointing reminder that sounding cool can only get you so far.","There was a time when I sneered at analog purists.

Apple Street EP,Asteroid No. 4,by: Nick Mirov,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a126ea9e61561daa471b/1:1/w_160/0647453b.gif,2000-11-30 06:00:05,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/325-apple-street-ep/,Audio Information PhenomenaAudio Information Phenomena,"On the surface, there's nothing wrong with wanting to revive the gently loopy spirit of early '60s psychedelia. But just because you slap a Hammond organ on top of some garage-buzz guitar, toss in a backward solo, and hand a tambourine to a band member's girlfriend, it doesn't mean you're suddenly the Kinks, or even Strawberry Alarm Clock. Are you listening, Asteroid Numberfour? If you're going to be copping moves from the same moribund genre that spawned ""Austin Powers"" and his many oft-repeated catchphrases, you'd better have some style of your own to bring to the party. Bands like the Olivia Tremor Control, Guided By Voices and the Lilys can get away with this kind of thing because they have passion, skill, and the knack for a catchy pop hook. Asteroid Numberfour seem to think that hiring the Lilys' Kurt Heasley to co-produce the five songs on Apple Street will get them by. Well, guys, the genius didn't exactly rub off. At least Heasley did his job well, since Apple Street has enough little flourishes to pass for a reasonably authentic replica. But it never sounds like the band cares at all about originality, or has any remotely compelling reasons for making music. And that's not even the bad news. You want the bad news? Here it is: Apple Street sucks, and it sucks hard. Not because the music isn't well written or because there's so little effort put forth, but because it's shot through with the kind of sneering condescension and vapid posturing that makes Marilyn Manson seem earnest. Take the tired, by-the-numbers scenester-dissing of ""Local Fashion Junky"": astoundingly, Asteroid Numberfour makes us feel sorry for the title character when jeering, ""If you're feeling lonely/ There's no need to cry, I'll tell you why/ You should hear the way we talk about you."" I don't think I need to point out the irony here. Then there's the sickeningly saccharine flute solos on ""Poor Man's Falls"" which manage to turn a half-baked portrait of go-nowhere small-town life into something almost reprehensibly exploitative. Why don't I believe a word you sing, Asteroid Numberfour? Perhaps the cynical lyrics and bouncy pop melodies works for countless other bands, but you just fail miserably at it. Get the fuck out of my sight.","On the surface, there's nothing wrong with wanting to revive the gently loopy spirit of early '60s psychedelia. But ...

Danelectro EP,Yo La Tengo,by: D.

They seem to head further into an almost post-rock territory (albeit of the melodic Mogwai type) than their previous records. Still, the songs bear much resemblance to the hazy, dusky, organic atmosphere of And Then Nothing Turned Itself Inside-Out, during which sessions these songs were recorded. The two songs lull me into a dreamlike state before I'm jarred awake by the intro of Danelectro's first remix, by the Arsonists' Q-Unique. As with any Arsonists track, it begins with terribly rote DJ scratching, and here, seems to follow the 'rock remix' formula to a T. Sorry, but the last thing these songs needed was rank turntablism. The track ends up a jarring contrast to the previous two, with quick cuts and electronic percussion, and within seconds has shattered the atmosphere established by the band. Kit Clayton's remix opens Danelectro's second half, following the form of the previous, by simply abandoning much of the smooth texture of the original in favor of rough cuts and synthetic textures. ""Danelectro 1"" follows, which provides a smooth transition into Nobukazu Takemura's 11-minute remix of ""Danelectro 2,"" the most effective remix presented here. He adds some subtle polyrhythmic percussion layers and keyboard effects which bring the whole thing closer to Tortoise brand post-rock. While it can't really be considered an improvement, it at least retains the atmosphere and feel of the original. Nothing on this EP is particularly awful-- Yo La Tengo certainly can't be blamed for their efforts-- but sometimes things are better left unremixed. The sequencing is overwhelmingly tacky, and really, how often do you think you'll find yourself in the mood for Takemura's epic reworking of a vaulted Yo La Tengo instrumental? The record has its moments of beauty, but in the end, it fails to add up to a satisfying whole.","Yo La Tengo's Danelectro EP begins with two dreamy, gorgeous, but similar instrumentals, ""Danelectro 2"" and ""3,"" built on ...

It's no different than yesterday, the day before, or last year. But they don't need your sympathy-- not yours or anybody's. They live for it. After all, it's what allowed them the means to record their debut full-length, the angstfully titled Fuck Fight Fail. It's all very dramatic. During the course of eight songs, these guys mourn their way to personal fitness over dramatic, synthesized string sections, weeping guitar and the occasional airy effects. But rather than whining overwrought emo sentiments about dark Septembers and forgotten mix tapes, Kepler go in for darker and artier statements like, ""There's blood on the sidewalk/ Bones behind the garbage."" Alright, so the emocore has left some kind of impression on these guys, and it shows up in their songs from time to time. Kepler, however, are closer in execution to traditional slowcore outfits like Codeine and Rex than burgeoning monstrosities Sense Field and Fireside. Fuck Fight Fail opens with the glistening, minute-and-a-half-long instrumental ""I Will Not Return Your Records"", spotlighting Jeremy Gara's glossy guitarwork and Michael Sheridan on 'space machine.' ""Light House"" follows the tidal, almost shoegazer ""Loose Ground"", with frontman Jonathan Georgekish-Watt delivering the refrain ""Everyday, my sentence is remanded/ My execution is stayed"" over wind chime guitar and ex-Pitchforker Samir Khan's cello-like basslines. The record's highlight, though, comes in the dead center, with ""Upper Canada Fight Song"". Over nine minutes, the song gradually builds to a Godspeed-esque crescendo that peaks with crashing cymbals and huge drums that drown out nearly every other element. So, yeah. Kepler are better than I'd hoped they might be, despite the melodramatic flair for song titles like ""The Way You Fall Apart"", and a bandname that references that astronomer guy who discovered that planets move in elliptical paths. Still, they could stand to shed some of their emo tendencies in lieu of something a little more artistically viable. Fuck Fight Fail's louder territory, and even its more 4AD areas, are really the album's shining moments. Regardless, the boys have got a great deal of promise, and their next album will likely shock this one into submission.","Kepler are feeling a little down today.

In a Beautiful Place Out in the Country EP,Boards of Canada,by: Paul Cooper,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a32eb1335d7bf1698681/1:1/w_160/0c951dba.gif,2000-11-30 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/835-in-a-beautiful-place-out-in-the-country-ep/,Warp,"What we have here are more insights into the preoccupations of the Boards of Canada compound. Notoriously journalist-shy (they're rumored to run screaming into haggis-infested forests at the sound of an incoming fax), Michael Sandison and Marcus Eoin leave it to their records to inform us of their politics, their preferred abandonments, and the ill winds that blow through the purple-heathered glen. But those expecting a poorly judged foray into two-step garage will be crushingly disappointed, as In a Beautiful Place Out in the Country runs like updated material from their majestic 1998 offering, Music Has the Right to Children. And like that album's namesake, these five elegantly mournful melodies creep and explore like adored but unruly children, full of wide-eyed astonishment and naïveté. These songs speak to those of us who've bartered our innocence for the experience of rent payments, asinine bosses, rolling blackouts, and a suborned democracy. After the effortless, ingratiating simplicity of the record's opener, ""Kid for Today"", Sandison and Eoin roll out the heavier bass of ""Amo Bishop Roden"". Though the song is easily the most groove-dependent on A Beautiful Place, the duo nicely retain their electro-agrarianism-- a strain of folk music I've yearned for since Ultramarine abandoned the Fairport Convention-styled techno of Every Man and Every Woman Is a Star. When Boards of Canada's acknowledged appreciation for the laughter of children opens the vocodered titled track, it's as though Daft Punk's ""One More Time"" had calmed down and realized it forgot to have a childhood. This track, like ""Kid for Today"", stands as a persuasive reminder to grown-ups that it's alright to lead simple lives, free from adornment. The vocoder is a little hackneyed-- its lifespan as a relevant music-enhancing device has officially drawn to a close-- but there's a distinct ""innocent abroad"" aesthetic here that many bands seem too media-savvy and advert-aware to pull off convincingly. (When the Boards of Canada protest that they never meant to become as huge as they have, I believe them-- Belle & Sebastian these Scots are not.) In a Beautiful Place Out in the Country concludes with ""Zoetrope"", a slowly revolving pastiche of minimalist melodies and Eno/Lanois ambience. There are no children's voices and no tunes reflecting wonderment-- just an echoing cleansing of the palette. Perhaps they'll shock us when they return with a violently beautiful, Alec Empire-inspired remake of the Minutemen's Double Nickels on the Dime next year. Or perhaps they'll just carry on doing that at which they excel: creating the music of innocent eyes.","What we have here are more insights into the preoccupations of the Boards of\n\ Canada compound.

OVO: The Millennium Show,Peter Gabriel,by: Spencer Owen,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bed5ea9e61561daa7973/1:1/w_160/2e1b0b32.gif,2000-11-30 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3373-ovo-the-millennium-show/,RealworldRealworld,"Geffen A&R; executive Tony Berg was quoted a few years back as suggesting that Peter Gabriel should call his next album Peter Gabriel Makes Grown Men Cry. To this day, I'm not exactly sure how he meant that. Either: As for the frustration thing, it's been eight years, and Gabriel still hasn't finished it. 2000, however, did see the release of a new UK-only Peter Gabriel record titled OVO: The Millennium Show. The album is technically a soundtrack to the disastrous Millennium Dome show that occurred in England a year ago. Just as Geffen attempted to convince the public that Beck's Mutations was not an ""official"" follow-up to Odelay, OVO is being deemed ""not the official follow-up to 1992's Us"". So, what's a fan to do, except simply take this as consolation for four-fifths of a decade of waiting? For one, they can hope that the real album is better. OVO has its moments, sure, but it's also fairly inconsistent. The sentiment and plot-- yes, there's a plot-- is, in fact, so hackneyed it's hard to believe that Berg Implication #1 could be the case. Despite all this, Gabriel does at times come through: a little over half of the record ranks alongside his early 90s work. Had the rest been cut, OVO's runtime would weigh in at 20 minutes less, but because they're all here, their mediocrity preserved in plastic for all time, the album's pitfalls prevent it from gaining consistency and cohesiveness. According to the liner notes, Gabriel has recruited some of his ""favourite voices"" to sing the bulk of OVO's material. The female presence is welcome; like Kate Bush and Sinéad O'Connor before them, Iarla O Lionaird and the Cocteau Twins' Elizabeth Fraser provide a lovely, sensual atmosphere to their cuts. When Richie Havens and Paul Buchanan pop up, though, it's unclear why Gabriel, whose vocals would have lent themselves infinitely better to these songs, didn't just sing them himself. ""The Story of OVO"" opens the album with promising, ethnically rich accompaniment, until Rasco (??) and Neneh Cherry start rapping. In the more than thirty years Peter Gabriel has been recording, he's never before written a rap, and it becomes clear immediately: ""A long time ago in a far away land/ There was a man/ Who learned to understand."" The Gabriel-sung chorus and the rhythmic closing almost make the trite lyrics worth enduring. Okay, they don't. But that's somewhat easily forgiven with a casual press of the 'skip' button. The first half's only major standout, ""Low Light"", follows with a beautiful ambient feel and an intro previewing the orchestral melody of a later track, the musically stunning ""Downside-Up"". ""The Time of the Turning"" sounds nice initially, but ultimately reveals itself as mediocre, with Havens and Fraser taking lead vocals on a generally forgettable melody. ""The Weavers' Reel"" pairs a reprise of ""Turning"" with a formulaic, lifeless Celtic reel, augmented with an unforgivably cheesy dance beat. And ""Father, Son"" attempts to go the way of Gabriel's previous ballads, but with such a saccharine sentiment and ordinary melody, it goes the way of elevator music. It's after this track that the line of demarcation from indifference to actual greatness becomes apparent, since the next song sets a new standard of quality which is ultimately fulfilled by OVO's remainder. ""The Tower That Ate People"" is Gabriel's funkiest track since ""Sledgehammer"", with growling verse vocals, phased guitars, overdriven organ, and a gorgeously haunting bridge melody. ""Revenge"" follows flawlessly with a breathtakingly strong, layered rhythm by African drum group The Dhol Foundation. And the 10-minute closing collaboration with electronic artist BT, ""Make Tomorrow"", is consistently enjoyable throughout its extravagant running time, bearing enough melodic and tonal changes to keep the listener interested. But the best track by far arrives just before the ending. ""Downside-Up"" is, melodically, one of the best songs in Gabriel's entire catalog-- and it was a damn strong catalog to begin with. The banal lyrics keep it from joining the ranks of his other classics, but the fluidity and richness of the chorus melody, and the skilled, outstanding guitar line that enters at the bridge, makes it a strong contender. OVO should nicely tide over you longtime fans until the eventual release of the forthcoming Up. It's inconsistent, though, and at times overbearingly trite, but it does contain some surprisingly effective material. If nothing else, the $30 import tag is a better bargain for the obsessive fan than a plane ticket to Britain.","Geffen A&R; executive Tony Berg was quoted a few years back as suggesting that\n\ Peter Gabriel should call ...

Pelo,Aluminium Group,by: John Dark,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a067c0084474cd0bfb7f/1:1/w_160/e3f21e5e.gif,2000-11-30 06:00:00,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/139-pelo/,Hefty,"Pelo is a pretty versatile word. According to my old college Spanish textbook, it translates as follows: pelo - n. 1. hair, coat of animal, down, fiber 2. hair trigger 3. triffle, nap, color of a horse 4. hairpiece, toupee In the case of the Aluminum Group's fourth release, I'd wager the rug definition is the most apt. They're both kitschy, questionable, and suggest a lifestyle that's usually the butt of jokes. But the vain man who dons a toupee is convinced it looks great, no matter how weighty the evidence to the contrary. It's the sort of affected sophistication that the Aluminum Group has raised to an artform. But it begs the question: ""Just why exactly?"" Pelo finds the influences of brothers John and Frank Navin firmly in place, if not their caliber of songwriting. The Aluminum Group sound is evident in every track, every lyric, every nuance. This shit is as smooth as a Bacharach's ass. It's a soundtrack to a 70s made-for-TV movie, but a quality one-- something like Brian's Song or Sybil, not that Boy in the Plastic Bubble tripe. Some of the first few tracks are a little more daring than previous efforts by the Navins. Though not quite worthy of the adjective ""experimental"", they're definitely a departure for the group, who work in sampled noise and dancier beats on the opener, ""Pussycat"". But Pelo settles into its form-fitting, comfy oeuvre soon enough. The too-rich bass in ""If You've Got a Lover, You've Got Life"" gets the groove going early and is among the highlights of the disc. Ultimately, though, Pelo is a triumph of average-- a zero-sum game. The few noteworthy tracks are negated by the bombs. For every standout, rare as they are, there are embarrassing nadirs like ""Tom of Finland (An Homage)"". Nobody had any business wasting perfectly good studio time ensuring that this turkey made it onto plastic. But maybe I assume too much. Perhaps the intended ""homage"" was slap-in-the-face sarcastic-- so intentionally bad that Tom has rolled over in his grave with an embarrassed grimace. Equally weak is the clumsily titled ""Good-Bye Goldfish, Hi Piranha"", a song that dramatically builds only to crescendo with the brief, impotent lyric: ""I took advantage of your honor/ In the cellophane/ What looks like one thing/ You bought cocaine but got flour"". This is part of the problem with Pelo; the bad stuff is ultimately more memorable than the good. Say what you will about the Aluminum Group; they certainly are earnest. Whether or not they're misguided is irrelevant. Just as there's no sense in arguing religion or politics at the dinner table, one gets the sense that any persuasions attempting to get the Aluminum Group to see the error of their ways would be at least equally futile. Their resolve even makes me doubt myself. Perhaps rock will wane and disappear, leaving odd niche bands like the Aluminum Group vindicated. Vindicated, but very, very alone.","Pelo is a pretty versatile word. According to my old college Spanish textbook, it translates as follows:

Gerroa Songs,Archer Prewitt,by: Ryan Kearney,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a1295e6ef95969320113/1:1/w_160/13e9d618.gif,2000-11-28 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6469-gerroa-songs/,Carrot Top,"This eight-song, 27-minute LP is clearly of a particular time and place-- not so much historically as personally. It's an intimate moment captured in sound. As Archer Prewitt himself accurately phrased it, these songs are ""documents."" Recorded live to eight-track in March 1999 (with a little post-production overdubbing), Gerroa Songs arose out of a vacation of sorts. Tony Dupre, a friend and engineer, invited Prewitt and others to a haunted, dilapidated ex-Nunnery by the seaside cliffs of Gerroa, New South Wales, Australia. During the day, they swam, relaxed, talked, watched leaping dolphins, and recorded pleasant songs. During the evening, they watched the house become dark, listened to insects drone on, and recorded gloomy songs. They never saw the much-rumored ""phantom lady"" who supposedly appeared in a chair at the end of the long dark hall. But she seems to have surfaced on the opening track, ""Gerroa."" Two computer glitches and an abandoned drumbeat pass by before the song ascends into waves of rattling and whirring machinery, like a specter floating among the hanging pots and pans of an industrial kitchen. It's hard to say if this is intentionally orchestrated or if it's the ambient noise of the building. That it fades away for a quaint guitar and simple percussion suggests the former. But the noises return, this time accompanied by a cacophony of deep cello notes, eerie moaning, and discordant noises reminiscent of parts of Jackie-O Motherfucker's Fig. 5. As the guitars and drums reenter, these sounds pull out again, but for one high, sustained violin stroke that holds for the last minute of the five-minute song. Following ""Gerroa"" comes ""The Bay,"" an brooding two-minute guitar instrumental that sounds recorded in a large, empty room with a bare wooden floor. Waves, wind and birds are barely audible in the background, adding a natural depth to the sound that, while completely opposite from the studio depth of his finely-crafted sophomore album, 1999's White Sky, is equally effective. On ""Meant to Be,"" these ambient sounds are even more audible, as are the insects that Prewitt alludes to in the liner notes. Finally unveiling his soft vocals, he sings, ""Meant to be, yeah, you were the one/ Meant to be, now never."" This must have been one of the night songs. ""Along the Coast"" is the first song that one can be sure was recorded in the afternoon. Featuring only Prewitt's deft guitarwork and the occasional interjecting cello or background harmonies, the song is like much of his other work: subdued, but not sad. Likewise, the strings and guitar of ""Waves Waltz,"" the Nick Drake-ian fingerpicking of ""Tell Me Now,"" and the beautiful, personal closer, ""Her Magic"" are more similar to the pensive, autumnal White Sky. However, with the exception of ""Her Magic,"" these entries aren't quite as engaging. But the EP's standout track, ""Another Peace of Mind,"" is among Prewitt's best efforts. A simple drumbeat returns-- bass drum, hi-hat, snare-- as does light guitar strumming. ""The time it takes you to be late,"" sings Prewitt. ""Beware the folks that you berate/ Take care the steps you have to take."" The song then leaps down into a sublime epiphany of deep bass, evocative strings, and the worrisome lines, ""Never going to find/ Another peace of mind."" Surprisingly-- given the mellow, lush White Sky-- gloominess and underproduction suit Prewitt well, but this different approach allows for decidedly less hummable melodies to balance out the quieter, sunken confessionals. Still, Gerroa Songs is successful at what it attempts to accomplish. And while Prewitt's experience recording Gerroa Songs is probably more memorable than our experience listening to it, that he would share his pleasant, creepy vacation with us is enough to warrant appreciation.","This eight-song, 27-minute LP is clearly of a particular time and place-- not so much historically as personally.

Let me explain. In my life, I've exposed myself to extreme situations, not out of nonchalance regarding my own mortality or for the masochistic thrill of risk, but so that I may have an extensive archive of abnormal experiences with which to judge every moment I walk this Earth. In order to judge pain, I contracted a rare meningeal condition. In searing, cortex-rupturing agony, I suffered experimental surgery. Now when I get a boo-boo, I run my fingers through the still-springy-to-the-touch furrows in my skull and console myself that the minor injury could be a whole lot worse. When I was in college, I witnessed the most drunk a human male could become and live. My housemates and I, having relished 746 quarts of Carlsberg Special Brew, forgot to pass out. Instead, I watched as two of them repeatedly threw themselves down a flight of stairs. Needless to say, the morning after was not only heralded with a bastard-behind-the-eyes hangover, but also major contusions and 48-hour paralysis. When reviewing, I also use extreme baselines of excellence as well as ones of disgust. These reviewing baselines are pan-genre and are obvious. Pet Sounds, Otis Reading's Otis Blue, and Pale Saints' The Comforts of Madness at one extreme; Anthea's Words and Beats and Yes' Tales From the Topographic Oceans at the other. So where does Jamie Lidell's debut album, Muddlin Gear, fit? Upon first listen, all but those of you who wake up to Merzbow would term Muddlin Gear ""unlistenable spunkjazztossfrenzyfuckshite,"" and would prefer to deal with a suppurating glans rather than suffer a rewind of that spastic electronic crap. But let me tell you, a burst bell-end is a whole lot less enjoyable than Muddlin Gear. I agree that, initially, Lidell's record is a tempest of fuzz, 220bpm jungle beats, and interplanetary lounge jazz. But once you get past the gag reflex, you can delve deeper into the album's tight constructions which only seem to blast apart. Lidell's time as one half of Super_Collider, with the skillful Cristian Vogel, should have been a giveaway that he don't produce nothing if not a sweet smelling turd. Where Vogel's Rescate 137 album, released about the same time as Muddlin Gear, toned down the frenetic runaway towtruck beats and scorching beams of white noise, Lidell's album conceals the delicacy with heavily splenetic tricks. And beauty abounds during the record, but it's more of a Cronenberg beauty than a Merchant Ivory one. This beauty radiates fully in the closing moments of the final track which glimmers like the gaseous giant that is Tangerine Dream's pre-Streethawk masterpiece, Zeit. But in order to get to ""Daddy, no lie,"" we got some mountains to traverse and some jungle to cut our way through. ""Ill Shabata"" begins with a duet between Pavarotti and someone throwing his guts up before a 303-sounding chainsaw slices through this cartoon scene. ""La Scappin Rööd"" is bacterial bleep jazz, such as the Mars Lander discovered under a rock late one Martian afternoon. ""Silent Why"" riffs on Miles in a woodblock-scraping style before the Autechre algorithm gets nasty on some electro beats innocently passing by. More Miles gets abducted for ""Da Doo Doo""-- this time it's Chick Corea's tinkling electric piano that competes against the ambient sounds of monumental structures sheering. By comparison, the clicks and cuts of ""The Cop It Suite"" make a soothing glitch of a light respite. Which leaves us with my pick for highlight, ""Dröön_99,"" which is nothing less than Charles Mingus and Teddy Charles' ""Laura"" remixed by a stratospherically bolloxed Danny Zelonky. Jamie Lidell has taken the Trash Collective's aural-invasion aesthetic and tweaked it for far subtler ends. Though this album doesn't present a baseline criterion, Muddlin Gear will prep you for when the body-snatching pods land to give you the most visceral baseline experience of your life.","The main technique I use for sorting the men from the boys in this reviewing\n\ lark is the extreme ...

But if I had a techno outfit, having a 12"" released on Underground Resistance would be more ego-massaging than Plus 8 picking up my squelching scorcher. With partner John Aquaviva, Hawtin cherry-picked the foremost in Detroit-style cyber-sheened techno. It was Plus 8 that introduced the world to Speedy J, Vapourspace, the Kooky Scientist, and Hawtin's own abstract acid alter ego, Plastikman. Most of the label's releases can rightly be called classics. For instance, Vapourspace's Gravitational Arch of Ten remains one of the most soulful of all techno records. And who could not be wowed by Kenny Larkin's sumptuous bleep-n-beat roller, ""Colony?"" These three compilation discs break down the seven years of Plus 8's existence, there's a definite sense of a house style that comes with listening to them in succession. Hawtin's roster kept to the cyber-Detroit blueprint drawn up by Juan Atkins and Derrick May. In the label's life, it didn't deviate like Warp or Rephlex. Not that deviating is in any way an unsound strategy. Immersing yourself in these compilations, you're without doubt immersing yourself in an unmistakable, immaculately constructed vision of the future. Talking about purity is a particularly pitfall-laden pastime, but it's to be said that from Cybersonik's ""Technarchy"" to Theorem's ""Mantra One"" Plus 8 delivered consistently pure product. Come to think even harder about it, Plus 8 tracks, in some ways, are remixes of each other. And, yes, just like any Dr. Moreau-type experimentation, the Plus 8 catalog does have a few mutations and chimeras. But unlike chimeras in the natural world, they're more than welcome in art. Hawtin's own ""Substance Abuse"" (recorded under his FUSE moniker) is one such luridly fascinating aberration, and the soundclash between FUSE and LFO (merely titled ""Loop"") pretty much constructed the ideal filtered loop track that so many have been borrowing from since. But the masterpiece on these discs is certainly Plastikman's ""Spastik."" Created with nothing more than a epileptic drum machine, the track is like having a synchronized helicopter display team waltz and tango around your brain. It's like Bach's Goldberg Variations, or Steve Reich's Music for Twelve Musicians, in that it explores all possibilities within a given musical constraint, whether that be Baroque aria, American minimalism, or Detroit techno.

Morse Code in the Modern Age: Across the Americas,Brokeback,by: Spencer Owen,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a3a89d034d5c69bf2e98/1:1/w_160/c3cbe45e.gif,2000-11-22 06:01:40,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/949-morse-code-in-the-modern-age-across-the-americas/,Thrill JockeyThrill Jockey,"This is the information age, so we've been told, and with mastery of information comes mastery of communication. Right now, virtually any piece of information can be transferred from any place on the planet to any other place instantaneously. Less direct methods become outdated, and therefore obsolete. Morse code is one of these outdated methods. Whereas nearly anyone can use a cellular phone or e-mail, it requires time, patience, and training to decipher even a sentence of Morse code. Brokeback have chosen to name their second and latest record, Morse Code in the Modern Age: Across the Americas, after this particular method of antiquated communicative technology, and it seems to fit, somehow. It's not a literal thing; there are no Morse code sequences hidden anywhere on the record. But the entire work seems to exude a lack of clarity and directness. It's the feeling of driving in open country, listening to AM radio, and listening to only static broken occasionally by purely gorgeous music from an unknown source, which promptly fades away again. Chicago-based post-rocker Douglas McCombs, on hiatus from Tortoise, Eleventh Dream Day, and Pullman, is the original and once sole member of Brokeback. On 1999's Field Recordings from the Cook County Water Table, he approached his new project from a solo standpoint, creating simple, often concise compositions around his bass, the contributions from outside collaborators, and the found, ambient sounds of his environment. On this record, however, Noel Kupersmith of the Chicago Underground Trio and Quartet has officially joined the project, and the difference in sound is ultimately striking. The first two tracks on Morse Code in the Modern Age seem as if they could drift endlessly. ""Lives of the Rhythm Experts"" begins with a Yo La Tengo-style sudden organ-- which, appropriately enough, happens to be YLT bassist James McNew's donation to the 16-minute track. The organ drone reverberates and hovers aimlessly throughout, never even accidentally stumbling upon a melody or a structure, as a subdued electronic stutter provides the rhythmic base. Kupersmith's drum kit fades in and out with restrained clatter until it finds a steady rhythm all too briefly, only to once again collapse and disappear. McCombs and Kupersmith are both bassists, but on this track, as on the rest of the record, McCombs uses his six-string electric bass for more melodic purposes, and Kupersmith's acoustic double bass handles most of the low end. They remain absent for the majority of ""Lives of the Rhythm Experts"" until the 13-minute mark, at which point the humming organ and electronics fade away to reveal McCombs' beautiful, silvery melodies and Kupersmith's anchoring support. ""Flat Handed and On the Wing"" comes off as an improvisational piece built on Kupersmith's wandering double bass, with the exception of a brief bassless coronet interlude. McCombs' bass is unrecognizable, ostensibly treated with effects that resemble oceanic sonar. Joey Burns of Calexico contributes trembling, echoing electric guitar that appears sporadically within the track's 12 minutes. The song rambles and almost begins to flounder towards its end, until Burns' shimmering, strummed guitar saves the piece, creating the record's clearest and most radiant moment. After these long, largely meandering compositions, Morse Code in the Modern Age seems to end rather abruptly, with an effective but poorly placed instrumental cover of Roy Orbison's ""Running Scared"" that runs just under 2\xBD minutes. Featuring both members of Calexico this time (Burns and John Convertino), as well as the choral vocals of Stereolab's Mary Hansen, this traditional rendition utilizes McCombs' capable imitation of a baritone guitar lead with his six-string bass. It's short, sweet, and to the point, and would be one of the record's highlights if it hadn't been placed with such desultory works as the previous two. The disc includes an enhanced, visual portion to be viewed on your computer, which features videos of the first two tracks created by Dutch Harbor filmmaker Braden King. ""Lives of the Rhythm Experts"" is accompanied by images of South American villages, and ""Flat Handed and On the Wing"" coexists with footage from the wing of an airplane. The videos seem to compliment the tracks nicely, but after time, they become boring, as these pieces generally lend themselves to the background and the audio/visual experience doesn't hold enough interest to maintain the full attention of the viewer. Like the subject of its title, Morse Code in the Modern Age seems inefficient, and involves a heightened level of patience to decipher. The first listen is rewarding and, at times, fascinating, involving full recognition of Brokeback's incorporations of various layers and structures of sound and effects. But with future listens, the static moments become too static, and the majority of the time is spent waiting impatiently for those glimmering moments that you know are there, when the beautiful music comes through the white noise and then just fades away again.","This is the information age, so we've been told, and with mastery of\n\ information comes mastery of communication ...

Music:Response EP,The Chemical Brothers,by: Rich Juzwiak,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a594b1335d7bf1698c21/1:1/w_160/bda658f0.gif,2000-11-21 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1414-musicresponse-ep/,Astralwerks,"We Yanks are rarely privileged to the low-cost singles routinely marketed to Brits. Shelling out $9.99 for two remixes or b-sides accompanying an LP version of the single's title track can be maddening-- especially since UK prices of such releases can run as low as £1.99. The Chemical Brothers know this and they care. Almost all of their releases, including albums, DJ mixes, EPs, and singles have been released in America in some form, eliminating the need to buy over-priced imports. Music:Response is yet another in this series of the Chem's 'cross-the-Atlantic fairness. The boys are giving it back to us Americans. Aren't we lucky? I must note, though, that the sarcasm stops here. True, it's tempting to hate the Chemical Brothers, the Pied Pipers of the Discotheque that brought their music to America and led an influx of big-beat biters to our turf. No longer (were they ever?) regarded hip by the horned-rimmed elite, it would be easy to take this opportunity to preach to the converted and assault Music:Response. I mean, really, the Chemical Brothers are to, say, La Bouche as Face to Face are to Blink-182, in terms of hipster cred; and that's not saying much for any of those implicated. This said, though, Music:Response is an arresting release if only because it defies the banality that arises from what we've come to expect from big-beat. Unlike Fatboy Slim, the Chemical Brothers aren't making tepid strides to hang on to their waning popularity. Music:Response is not subversive, per se, but it's a surprising bit of raucous fun for the dancefloor. It's all about making asses shake, and at this point, if the Chemicals can do that, they're far more successful than the majority of their contemporaries. The title track appears three times over the course of the EP, and it's this sort of overkill that detracts from a potential mini-LP aesthete, and betrays Music:Response as merely a 48-minute single. The album version of the title track, taken from the Brothers' 1999 full-length, Surrender, is MOR big-beat, high on funk and electro bleeps but lacking in unlikeness. Justin Robertson's ""Gentleman Thief Mix"" of the track, though, turns up the plush factor by adding a deeper, groovier bassline and clinking cowbells a la ""Rappers' Delight."" With Robertson at the helm, the track is revamped as a late-nite house number and benefits greatly from the cross-over. The ""Futureshock Main Response"" mix, while not as successful as Robertson's reworking, improves its source material by pumping it up a notch and adding keyboard effects that recall a tinny wind-up symphony. ""Freak of the Week"" and ""Enjoyed"" are both outtakes from the Surrender sessions, and, surprisingly, the best tracks on the EP. The former is a funky, frenetic house song with a brooding, sculpted bassline. Though big-beats monopolize the song within three minutes, the jaunt into house is a welcome one. It's even better in ""Enjoyed,"" with its high-energy house beats and a highly synthesized bassline that sounds ripped out of Donna Summer's much-sampled electro-disco hit ""I Feel Love."" In actuality, the bassline comes from Surrender's ""Out of Control,"" of which a live Glastonbury version also appears. Live versions of ""Got Glint?"" and the aforementioned ""Out of Control"" close out Music:Response. ""Out of Control"" is mostly stripped of the Bobby Gillespie/Bernard Sumner vocals of the original, and comes off as a trivial dub reworking with audience cheers at the opening and closing. ""Got Glint?"" is similarly pointless, as its sole variation is the inclusion of a dicing guitar riff that accelerates until it sounds like hummingbird wings. The disc features an enhanced portion featuring the video for ""Let Forever Be."" If you can get past the fact that the Noel Gallagher-sung tune is ultimately just a sad parody of Revolver's ""Tomorrow Never Knows,"" director Michel Gondry's wacky visual effects rank up there with Björk's ""Human Behaviour"" and ""Army of Me,"" and Daft Punk's ""Around the World,"" as the talented videomaker's best. Music:Response is an altogether satisfying affair, though as most of the songs clock in at around eight minutes, it's not exactly the best of home-listening electronica. The Chemical Brothers are still doing what they've always done, without watering down their sound and attempting to reach to a wider audience. With big-beat's allotted 15 minutes near the 13:30 mark, the Chemicals seem poised to gracefully fade into obscurity. God bless 'em for it.","We Yanks are rarely privileged to the low-cost singles routinely marketed to\n\ Brits. Shelling out $9.99 for two ...

The Best of Blur,Blur,by: Rich Juzwiak,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a329ea9e61561daa4bfe/1:1/w_160/6967113e.gif,2000-11-21 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/830-the-best-of-blur/,VirginParlophoneFood,"A few things within the post-Britpop sphere are inevitable. Among them: 1) The Gallagher brothers will keep fighting and releasing records that no one cares about; 2) Bobby Gillespie will keep trying to push Primal Scream into making a new Screamadelica and end up with a big-bunch of big-beat bullshit; 3) Jarvis Cocker will keep taking forever to record and end up with a Pulp album that pales in comparison to its predecessor. And while it might not rank up there with the most inevitable events in a post-Britpop landscape, we still should have seen this decade-spanning career retrospective of Blur's coming. Blur is easily among the best bands to come out of the '90s Britpop scene. Borrowing from their influences (a teaspoon Stone Roses, a healthy dose of the Kinks, a dab of the Beatles, and a sprinkling of the Smiths), they carved out a sound that was uniformly accessible. Though they produced five great albums out of the six they recorded (their debut, Leisure, was lacking), their strength has always been their singles. The Best of Blur might be a little useless to old fans who already own their old stuff, since 17 of the 18 tracks are taken from previous albums. However, if any fans are like me and verging on becoming burnt-out on Blur, the disc is a perfect way to get reacquainted and fall in love all over again. The Best of Blur serves as a document for an astonishingly consistent career full of hits over in Britain. It's a shame that their success in America has been limited to a three-month span in the summer of 1997, during which teens screamed, ""Whoo-hoo!"" along to the Pixies-induced parody of American rock, ""Song 2."" But disappointing as it may be, it's not at all surprising; Damon Albarn's voice is a working class English croon, and his lyrics are decidedly British (example: the use of the word ""jackanory"" to describe how things are going in ""Country House""), something that doesn't play well with this nation's blind patriotism. As with any retrospective, the track listing isn't going to please anyone. Though much of essential Blur is collected, there are notable omissions. Their second album, Modern Life is Rubbish, is underrepresented with only ""For Tomorrow"" making the cut (""Chemical World"" and ""Popscene"" should have been included, since they're easily among Blur's best). Additionally, b-side-turned-Trainspotting-anthem, ""Sing,"" is six minutes of psychedelic perfection that would have added contrast to many of the jubilant pop songs presented here. Still, it's hard to argue with the material that made it to this record. The disc, though not sequenced in chronological order, covers all facets of Blur's career. There's the early shoe-gazing days of ""She's So High,"" the bouncy dance beats of ""Girls and Boys,"" the riff-heavy pure pop of ""Country House,"" and the more ""experimental"" (though completely characteristic) lo-fi crunch of ""Beetlebum."" The one new song included, ""Music is My Radar,"" warrants an appearance not just as a previously unavailable track, but as truly one of their best. It's minimalist, groovy, and combines the shiny poppy old Blur with the ragged noisy new Blur perfectly. Throw in a bonus disc of 10 live tracks taken from last year's singles show at Wembley Arena, as well as great packaging, and the two-disc set seems more than worth its price. Blur themselves would probably dismiss the album as shit. Supposedly, none of the members were concerned enough with this release to speak up and say what should be included. Damon Albarn, particularly, has been vocal about taking a dislike to the band's previous material (which led to Blur's branching out on their previous two albums). Additionally, he's recently expressed distaste for the pop music scene as a whole. Latter point taken, the former seems like arrogant self-deprecation. Perhaps Albarn looks back on his past, sees catchy melodies, accessible production, and myriad screaming fans who love not only his music, but his good looks as well. From that perspective, Blur not only perfected Britpop, but also opened the door for boy bands who have helped contribute to the compost heap that is Top 40 radio. Yes, Blur may have been a boy band (and they might very well still be one), but there's no doubt that they're the most clever, likable, and best boy band in the world... Ever!","A few things within the post-Britpop sphere are inevitable. Among them: 1) The Gallagher brothers will keep fighting and releasing ...

Things Falling Apart,Nine Inch Nails,by: Ryan Kearney,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c3fd69fc7814a47cd7a3/1:1/w_160/5ccbf04f.gif,2000-11-21 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5798-things-falling-apart/,InterscopeNothing,"Usually, my first thought upon hearing the phrase, ""When it rains, it pours,"" is of Morton Salt and its iconic logo: a strolling girl in a yellow raincoat hoisting a purple umbrella to deflect airborne particles of sodium chloride. And yet, though this girl seems not to have a care in the world, the phrase is usually associated with a quick succession of unfortunate events (after all, no ""Today Show""-watching human being likes a downpour). But when I used this phrase the other day, I had a different vision altogether. I must first explain why. First, it took almost three hours to complete a 40-minute flight from Boston to New York. Second, I've been looking, or rather finding, love in the all the wrong places. And third, I got fired. When it rains, it pours, indeed. So then, the image: an open, festering wound a la Requiem for a Dream, into which salt slowly trickled, fizzled, and dissolved in a bubbly, bloody mess. A bit dramatic? You bet, with some hyperbole added-- like salt-- for good measure. But what better mindset could there be for facing Nine Inch Nails' latest remix album? Trent Reznor, after all, has a distinct place in my history: I was prevented from attending my junior high graduation because, during the year-end dance, I ""slamdanced"" to ""Head Like a Hole,"" kicking a chair over in the process. I didn't deserve that then, and I don't deserve this now. But that's what NIN is all about: the weight of minor injustices on human emotions. The title was promising, if only because it mirrored my sentiments (so long as it's not a tactless reference to Chinua Achebe's classic novel; plus, The Roots got first dibs). Likewise for some of the song titles: ""Slipping Away,"" ""The Great Collapse,"" ""The Wretched,"" ""The Frail."" Overdone yes, but sometimes one wants unfiltered emotion, as much as it resembles adolescent angst. Little did I know that the album and aforementioned song titles actually refer to Reznor's talent. Despite its inherent relation to The Fragile, Things Falling Apart should, like any other album, stand on its own. But this album doesn't stand; it never gets up. It's a toddler with two knobs for legs and arms like a Mr. Potatohead. The 53 minute-long album kicks (read: dozes) off with ""Slipping Away (Into the Void Manipulation)"" by Reznor and Brit mixer/engineer Alan Moulder. Does this sound familiar?: a plodding, Neanderthal beat; a dated guitar; a violin; searing but sanitized fuzz. Then, everything stops so Trent can scream his first line: ""I keep slipping away."" After throwing in those same blips he's employed since the beginning of time, the song becomes predictably muddled and furious. ""The Great Collapse""-- the only new track here-- seems out of time, in a bad way. It combines the simplistic beat of the Pretty Hate Machine era with the tasteless piano atmospherics of his later work. ""The Wretched,"" reinterpreted here by Keith Hillebrandt of the Nothing ""collective,"" is another ""Hurt""-style subdued song that slowly builds and then crumbles. And Benelli's take on ""The Frail"" is still a cheap, pseudo-stringed-quartet piece, but with a few clanks here and there. Brilliant! But here's the best part: three, count 'em, three remixes of the truly unforgivable ""Starfuckers, Inc."" Dub producer Adrian Sherwood gives the song a, well, dubby makeover. Skinny Puppy's Dave Ogilvie, hot off his work remixing Mötley Crüe, goes the house route. And Charlie Clouser's version is a drum-n-bass-via-trance journey that doesn't even remotely resemble the original. All three remixes are slight improvements over the original, but isn't that automatically the case? The only bright spot here wasn't even originally composed by NIN: a cover of Gary Numan's ""Metal."" Reznor drenches the first five minutes in fuzz, but during the last two minutes, pleasant, unforced acoustic strumming and quavering keyboards subtly rise above the fuzz. It's these two minutes that saved the album rating from goose eggs. I desperately wanted this album to speak to me. To join me in this rut. To agree that yes, when it rains, it pours. But as suspected, it didn't. Instead, it sunk lower-- way down below me. Listening to this album was so painful that the festering wound no longer seemed so serious: a cut mends itself, but Things Falling Apart is around for the long haul.","Usually, my first thought upon hearing the phrase, ""When it rains, it pours,""\n\ is of Morton Salt and its ...

Volume Two,Echoboy,by: Rich Juzwiak,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bbfeeb335119a49ecb72/1:1/w_160/8a14fbb7.gif,2000-11-21 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2677-volume-two/,MuteMute,"Electronica is inescapable. Not only have we experienced it in a multitude of television promos and movie soundtracks, but it's infested other genres of music to the point of ubiquity. This year alone has seen myriad releases from those eager to defy genres and shift forms. From Badly Drawn Boy's folk-electronic hybrid to OutKast's full-on jungle hip-hop of ""B.O.B,"" it's clear that artists in even the most unlikely genres can't seem to keep their hands off their knobs (no pun intended, but if it were, Bright Eyes could most certainly be included in the list). We've come to the point where the integration of electronic and rock is a virtual no-brainer, to the extent that, for the most part, ""experimenting"" with the combination is becoming quite dull. On previous outings, Echoboy's Richard Warren delivered a rock-techno sound to widespread acclaim. Volume Two finds him treading over similar ground just as successfully. Instead of crashing rock and roll and electronica head-on, his integration is a more subtle mix. He's not a pioneer by any means, but Volume Two is testament to his more nuanced approach. On this, his third album, Warren allows the guitars and ""real"" instruments an equal say, and ends up with music that sounds incredibly intelligent in light of many other clumsy cross-breeding musicians. Take ""Sudewestfunk No. 5,"" for example. The pure-funk of the guitar riff is complemented by an understated drum machine that sounds like a piston releasing steam. The song morphs and the steam is usurped by big, tinny drum sounds and high-pitched bleeps. Similarly, both""Siobhan"" and ""Schram and Sheddle"" recall Squarepusher's foray into jazz, without abandoning the glorious and frightening noises that electronica offers. ""Schram"" is particularly exceptional; two distinct drum parts match at the start of the song, then spiral out of synch, and almost work themselves back together. All the while, reverb cascades all over and the song closes as a mere drone. And using only an 8-track to record, Warren is cognizant of the fact that every layer counts. Though some of the more rock-oriented numbers are a bit too big beat for my taste, the production isn't really the problem; Warren's lyrics are. Though adding vocals to an album made mostly of electronic-based music helps vary a potentially monotonous sound, it often doesn't work so well for Echoboy. On the airy ""Circulation,"" Warren seems to be taking a confessional approach and spinning a tale of lost love (he has a ""heart so cold"" and wants to ""circulate your system with love""). The result is trite and sounds out of place in contrast to the relatively intelligent material presented in other areas of Volume Two. On the other tracks that feature singing, Warren chooses to distort and filter his vocals so that the listener is barely able to make out what he's saying; probably a smart move. Here, Warren merely uses his voice as another distinct layer to the sound, managing not to distract the listener with cliches. And it's greatly appreciated that these pains have been taken, because what's happening musically on Volume Two is leaps and bounds more interesting than any lyrics Warren could possibly muster.","Electronica is inescapable.

Buzzle Bee,The High Llamas,by: John Dark,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c0dac0084474cd0c325c/1:1/w_160/9c3edf18.gif,2000-11-14 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3861-buzzle-bee/,Drag CityDrag City,"There are 810 ""la-la's"" on Buzzle Bee. I know because I, unlike the Palm Beach County Board of Canvassers, counted every last one. A high number to be sure, but one that takes on an even greater and more absurd significance when you consider that half of the tracks on the album are instrumental. Make no mistake about it, friend, that's a lot of fucking la's. But is it too many? The factual and unsubjectivicated answer is, in a word: yes. We're talking roughly a 3:1 nonsensical-to-intelligible lyric-syllable ratio here. That's up there in doo-wop territory (though not as high as scat). Those are ""Teletubbies"" numbers! And at its worst, that's just what Buzzle Bee is: music for ""Teletubbies."" Not the surreal banjo-and-snare marches of the theme song, but rather, the kind of music that Tinky-Winky, Dipsy, La-La and Po might enjoy kicking back to after a hard day's romping with bunny rabbits. Sonically, the High Llamas couldn't offend someone if they tried. The music has an Eddie Haskell character to it-- very proper and calculated. One might suspect an ulterior motive, if not for the fact that frontman Sean O'Hagan steeps his chord progressions in penultimate sincerity the way only a certifiable perfectionist can. It's music not just for a happy world, but for a world in which nothing unhappy had ever occurred. With more vibraphonic chime-farts than Lionel Hampton on Quaaludes, and Mary Hansen on semi-permanent loan from Stereolab, Buzzle Bee gurgles like a symphony of swamp gas idiophonica. And it's not treading new ground so much as it is the same old ground with different shoes. The opening track drifts along, buoyed by a sing-songy chorus of ""Lay down/ Watch the traffic go by,"" a lyric so dreamy it sounds phoned-in from the Astral plane. O'Hagan's plain-jane vocals are an asset to the track, though, if only because he wisely avoids the vocal posturing and hammy crooning that his contemporaries so often fall victim to. ""Get into the Galley Shop"" attempts to be a microcosm of the album, if not the band's entire back catalog. It's catchy and retro in its technique (all the drums are right-channeled), and the three-part harmonies glisten like tubs of Nickelodeon Gak. The lyrics are cryptic enough to be either profound or goofy; you make the call: ""You need to take your sandals off to take away the porcelain/ Hopping in a hotel bar hidden in a marching band/ Music popping from the bar, driven by a cosmic man."" Buzzle Bee's low point comes with ""Tambourine Day,"" which shark-circles its melody without ever finding it. But the other instrumentals, taken as a clutch, are a mixed bag. ""Switch Pavilion"" centers around Hansen's-- you guessed it!-- wispy ""la-la"" phrasing; the sedative ""Sleeping Spray"" is the gentle mellow break of the album-- the place where they ""take it down a notch,"" despite the fact that it's already practically off the scale. ""New Broadway"" does its best to be endearing while catching the listener off-guard with its many style shifts and rhythm variations. It also showcases some of the better bass work on Buzzle Bee, which is otherwise lackluster punctuation-- commas and periods rather than pop exclamation marks. But once the closer, ""Bobby's Court,"" gets past the pedestrian verse, it features an enraging five-note syncopated loop that's surprisingly juvenile for the Llamas. Usually, O'Hagan's arrangements are deeper and a little more intricate; this one sounds like something he dug out of his pre-microdisney days. What we're left with when all's said and done is a brief eight tracks and 40 minutes of somnambulist, pianissimo music. But you know, when push comes to shove, those ""la's"" are a real bitch. 810!

Maxi On EP,Takako Minekawa,by: Spencer Owen,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c53dc0084474cd0c36dd/1:1/w_160/bcc6580f.gif,2000-11-14 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5300-maxi-on-ep/,Emperor NortonEmperor Norton,"Cultural differences: ain't they a riot? I tell ya, we Americans think they're a veritable source of knee-slappin' hilarity. Those big, funny sombreros that all those Mexicans wear? Killer! Those crazy Russians with their thick accents and pocket-sized vodka? Comedy gold! And don't even get me started on the Canadians. Why, the Great White North is a genuine Fort Knox of amusement! But perhaps the greatest thing that separates our fine union from those denizens of the far-reaching unknown is the odd translation method the Japanese use to write and speak in English. With a different phonetic system entirely, the Japanese come up with entirely bizarre English phrases that leave out and add words at random and, at times, seem to have no affiliation with what's actually trying to be communicated. Read any electronics manual for proof. Takako Minekawa is Japanese. Japanese, of course, being synonymous with ""not American."" Therefore, she's not exempt from our droll Western stereotypes. On her new release, the seven-song Maxi On EP, as well as on most of her other material, Minekawa's lyrics come chock-full of fractured English. In any other context, her strange take on the language could seem hilarious. But for some reason, the novelty wears off quickly on her records. This being a good thing, since it doesn't seem like she's particularly aiming for a laughing good time. She even demands we ""stop laughing"" in ""Lullaby of Gray,"" and it's an apt request. Minekawa should be taken seriously. Takako has made a habit of collaborating with other established artists on her solo efforts. On 1996's Roomic Cube, she worked extensively with Buffalo Daughter; on 1999's Fun9, DJ Me/DJ You and current beau Cornelius split much of the backing. Things aren't much different here: the title, Maxi On, seems to be a play on words regarding her new collaborators, the New York City duo Dymaxion. Technically, only the Jeremy Novak half of Dymaxion was involved, but he uses his group's moniker and shares writing, arrangement and production credits for Maxi On's first four tracks. Novak's presence on the opening title track immediately indicates a slightly new sound. Sure, Minekawa's trademark chirping vocals and pulsing rhythms are present, but the overall tone is dirtier and funkier. ""I can touch deeply your mad dreams,"" she trills over muted minor-key guitar, thick basslines, and a canned old-school beat. ""A Report on an Investigation"" has the air of a spiritual film noir, a dark detective story with shimmers of hope. In fact, the only track out of the four Dymaxion collaborations that doesn't bear a similar aura is ""Brioche,"" just under two minutes of shimmering, polyrhythmic synthesizer and her gorgeous, layered vocal harmonies. But though it's all been good so far, Maxi On's peak arrives with Minekawa's strictly solo tracks. ""Picnic at Loose Rock"" is a relaxed instrumental with a harmonium melody, wordless, bubbly vocals, and a pulsating yet calming rhythm. ""Follow My Dreams"" is truly dreamlike; featuring Cornelius on various electric guitars, each aural element touches off the ground and gracefully soars through ethereal melody. And ""Sleeping Bag,"" the final cut and the bonus track for us Yankees, closes the disc similarly with the simple repetition of the word ""sky"" chiming throughout the shifting, hypnotic accompaniment of pianos, electric bass, xylophones, subtle brass, and ocean waves. Yes, her past is littered with song titles like ""SHH Song"" and ""Kangaroo Pocket Calculator."" Yes, the phrases ""it's serious fairy tale with an extension cord"" and ""a beautiful things for the after crying"" can be found in Maxi On's lyric sheet.

Necrophones,Lungfish,by: Camilo Arturo Leslie,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bda313d197565213b5ab/1:1/w_160/21567f7f.jpeg,2000-11-14 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4926-necrophones/,DischordDischord,"Frodo Goes to Washington is a better sounding title than Necrophones, don't you think? I do. Then again, I just sat through it for the third consecutive time and have lost all perspective. Third time, it turns out, is not a charm. I'm further from comprehending this album than I was prior to hearing it. Daniel Higgs is the vocalist for Lungfish. He's got an unruly prophet-chic beard and a face stuck on ""stern."" Higgs looks like he might have gotten kicked out of the Brethren for taking it all too seriously. His lyrics are exceedingly imagistic, paradoxical, puzzling, sometimes fascinating, and highly likely to make you shake your head and mutter ""what the fuck?"" Sometimes it seems to work, but it never makes sense. Or maybe it does, who the hell knows? I, for one, have neither the exegetical skills nor the time to delve into the kooky-ass cosmology of Higgs' head. Consider the following passage: ""The kiss embalmed for state display/ The state as defined by broken minds/ The mind a concentric mirror maze/ The mirror swirling begins to drain."" Scattered bits seem to cohere into themes but the connective tissue is pure schizophrenic spew. The above passage continues, ""A drain sucking at its own remains/ There remains an echo migrating through space/ The echo draped in a bridal gown/ The gown reveals a fist of vapor."" The music is standard Lungfish fare but significantly darker than on previous albums. The classic Lungfish technique, in case you were worried, is quite intact. Another all-you-can-eat of re-pe-ti-tive riffery that spins like machinery, or slowly, like parodies of nature cycles, over and over with little or no change. The first time I heard Lungfish I remember expecting that the endless terrain of riffage might pay off at the song's end with some surprising climactic change. Wrong! The changes only come with the silence between tracks and the beginning of a new endless expanse of riffage. Lungfish is also sounding more medieval than ever these days. It's up to you to decide if that's a good thing. It took a while to get that mini-Stonehenge scene from This is Spinal Tap out of my head. And when I finally did, it was instantly replaced by shitty scenes from Tolkien novels. This is punk rock for hobbits, or maybe a soundtrack to the Black Plague. It's background music to distract you from the lice multiplying in your hair, the fleas in your ass-crack, the blood-gorged tick on your eyeball, the biting draft in your roofless stone hovel, and the putrid week-old bowl of gruel you're having for dinner. Now that's rock. This has as much to do with Higgs' singing as it does with the music. Back around the release of Songs for Walking and Talking, he pulled off hoarse punk in a fairly conventional but effective way; now he has this sort of ""evil"" affectation to his singing. He sounds alternately whiny and wannabe creepy, like the three witch sisters in Desmond Davis' Clash of the Titans. The result sounds menacingly like Jethro Tull: unvaryingly dirge-like and unpleasant. All in all, though, this is just Lungfish. Necrophones won't win them new fans and it won't cost them any, I'm sure. The man with the tumbleweed convention on his face and his band of slow-motion marauders have been around 13 years and aren't hanging it up anytime soon. And if you've stuck it out through their first eight albums you're probably already eating this one up. Like the shrill cries of a baby, or the sound of shelling, or tinnitus, Necrophones gets more slightly more tolerable with every repeat listen. In the meantime, I've got a pot of Quaker Instant Gruel on simmer, and a fair wench over, so I really must be going.","Frodo Goes to Washington is a better sounding title than Necrophones, don't you think?

Silence Magnifies Sound,Six Parts Seven,by: John Dark,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a431c0084474cd0c0436/1:1/w_160/94c3f5c7.gif,2000-11-14 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7205-silence-magnifies-sound/,Troubleman UnlimitedTroubleman Unlimited,"Having caught some very polite flak from Mike at Troubleman Unlimited over my last review, from which some people inferred that I claimed his label lacked a diverse sound, I decided that I would highlight the label's variety in my next review of a TMU disc. The Six Parts Seven makes my goal easy-- it handily shatters every preconceived notion I had about the label's roster. It's about as far away from a Harriet the Spy-style blistering hardcore attack as is humanly possible. About the only thing shared by the Six Parts Seven and their labelmates is their locale. This Kent, Ohio-based quartet has been making mature, shimmering, instrumental post-rock for over six years now. And e-bow, viola, guitar, lapsteel and percussion are mixed gently and equally on Silence Magnifies Sound, their second full-length. Very reminiscent of their debut, 1999's In Lines and Patterns (released on Donut Friends), nothing new or different is on the menu here. It's more of the same: silky smooth, clean, ringing tones of twin guitars create the atmospheric conditions that allow for evocative touches by the e-bow and viola. At its worst, Silence Magnifies Sound flirts dangerously with Windham Hill new age, like a weathered Michael Hedges. At its best, it's exploratory, ambient rock with an art-school panache. More a suite divided into nine parts than a traditional album with nine different tracks, the album is clearly jazz-like in its modus operandi: choose one musical phrase, flesh it out, develop it and watch it metamorphose. Let it drive the piece. Each song highlights a single theme and kneads it repetitiously with slight variations that cumulatively build. The standouts come when the rhythm picks up somewhat, such as on the looping, and moderately peppy ""The Day After the Day After Here"" or the mid-paced, melodic ""The Constant Variables."" Though the somnambulist nine minute closer, ""Changing the Name of October,"" seems to end long before you're ready for it to be over. It starts slow and builds to, well... slowness, but it's the song's intricacies that save it from neverending mediocrity. Silence Magnifies Sound is a perfect backdrop for a refined, sophisticated experience like a museum tour or an art exhibition. But for those other times in your life, when you happen to be outside of such a cultural institution, you'd damn well better be in the mood before popping this one in the player. Because, you see, if you aren't in the exact frame of mind needed to appreciate music like the Six Parts Seven create, Silence Magnifies Sound will put you there. Whether you like it or not.","Having caught some very polite flak from Mike at Troubleman Unlimited over my last review, from which some people inferred ...

The View from This Tower,Faraquet,by: Camilo Arturo Leslie,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd4e5e6ef95969323024/1:1/w_160/f0cd56bf.gif,2000-11-14 06:00:00,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2992-the-view-from-this-tower/,DischordDischord,"If Louis Farrakhan should ever decide to enhance his famously incendiary brand of oratory with Supremes-style back-up singers (picture three lovely, impeccably coifed ladies in sequin gowns, elbow-length gloves and bow-ties oooh-aah-oooh'ing about ""Zionist Conspiracies"") he might very well settle on the Marvelous Farraquettes as their title. At which point these guys will just have to choose a new name. But sticking with the Likely, they'll get to keep their name and people will continue asking themselves, ""What the hell is (a) Faraquet?"" After listening to the band, though, they'll decide that it doesn't much matter because the name, like Faraquet's singular brand of rock, just sounds cool. During my first semester at a certain overrated university on New York's Upper-West side, the Ministry of Housing placed me in a tiny room with a prep-schooler named Neil. Though eventually we became great friends, that first semester was a real goddamned trial. Skipping straight to the point, our musical tastes clashed. Badly. Like oily cat and watery dog. Sure, over time we performed our little token exchanges-- I came to enjoy the De La Soul album he blared incessantly, and Neil quit rolling his eyes and saying, ""Kill your mother!"" in his faux-demon voice while making the heavy metal hand gesture when I'd put on my music. Or my ""music"" as he preferred. And no, I wasn't listening to fucking Black Metal or anything of that sort. Rather, those were the years when I was listening, almost exclusively, to a handful of Dischord bands. I remember running down the list of them, hoping one would break the streak: Fugazi (""Kill your mother!""), Nation of Ulysses (a truly heartfelt ""Kill your mother!""), umm... let's see, Jawbox (unjustifiably, ""Kill your mother!""), Minor Threat (well, you can imagine), and so on. The first thing that came to mind when I'd finished listening to The View from This Tower was how I wished it'd been around in 1996. A Dischord band to stump Neil! Not even he could've kill-your-mother'd Faraquet in good faith. At the risk of earning myself another cheeky missive from a jazz snob, I'm going to invoke the genre in vain and simply say that Faraquet ""has horns."" Their riffs whir and run circles around your head. Scarcely a moment is left unadorned by Chad Molter's tight drumming. Devin Ocampo's spindly, spidery guitar lines virtuosically toe the line between scorching and wanky. On the harder, more discordant songs, mood and direction zigzag violently while the quieter stretches of the album lend those same deft maneuvers calm and entrance, like time-lapse photography or stoner laser-light shows. But though the vestiges are there, this ain't Smart Went Crazy. It's more like Crazy got smart, taking astronomy classes and intensive music courses. Say Thrill Jockey fucked Dischord and the resulting child lived long enough to get a taste for, among other things, Synchronicity-era Police. Odd time signatures, tempo change-ups, the occasional use of brass-- in short, all the things on a ""rock"" record that would normally send people screaming from the room. They're all here in abundance. Did I mention cellos? Congas? It all works perfectly. Nothing about The View from This Tower sounds the least bit contrived or ""experimental""-- it's exactly as it should be. They aren't going to change any lives with this one, but quietly and effectively, Faraquet has issued a challenge to their peers: to expand their musical lexicon and range of expression, and throw off some of that stifling rock and roll orthodoxy. There's some biblical passage and it goes something like, ""If your faith was as big as a mustard seed, you could move a mountain."" I'm not trying to get holy on you or anything, but Faraquet reminded me of that, albeit incongruously. If you could replace only 1% of all the unconscionably shitty bands out there with bands like Faraquet... well, you get my drift.","If Louis Farrakhan should ever decide to enhance his famously incendiary brand of oratory with Supremes-style back-up singers (picture three ...

Ghost Tropic,Songs: Ohia,by: Ryan Kearney,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a4b65e6ef9596932092b/1:1/w_160/8239b301.gif,2000-11-13 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7336-ghost-tropic/,Secretly Canadian,"Will Oldham has a doppelganger of sorts in Jason Molina, the singer-songwriter behind Songs: Ohia. No, Molina hasn't been known to sport a Marxian beard, and he's long since ditched his multiple monikers. But he has a few other things in common with Oldham, alt-folk's reigning Prince of Darkness. Consider the following: in 1996, Molina released a single on the Palace imprint; he now consistently records with a rotating cast of musicians; and Ghost Tropic was Molina's second full-length release of 2000 (The Lioness came earlier in the year). But the connection runs deeper. Molina also plays hushed, somber folk music, usually with sparse instrumentation. His lyrics, while more personal, are nearly as poetic and dark. Then, of course, the most obvious comparison: the fragile voice. Generally speaking, Molina's pipes are cleaner than Oldham's-- a fact that becomes particularly apparent during those rare high notes. But when low-key, his voice sounds disconcertingly similar. Thus, given that since 1999's Axxess & Ace-- his highwatermark thus far-- Molina has become subtler and even more subdued, and his voice has moved closer in nature to Oldham's. On Ghost Tropic, where Molina's voice is now similarly broken, the difference would be indistinguishable to the untrained ear. The comparison between Molina and Oldham has been made time and again, and is probably as sickening to Songs: Ohia's fans as it is to him. But there's a reason I insist on making the tired comparison: never before has it been more apt. Ghost Tropic, the band's fifth proper full-length, makes even The Lioness seem, at the very least, content. For his version of ""I See a Darkness""-- or rather, ""I See a Heart of Darkness""-- Molina again enlisted Alasdair Roberts of Appendix Out, who also played on The Lioness, as well as members of Lullaby for the Working Class. Their influence, though, goes sadly undetectable. Ghost Tropic was recorded at Dead Space Recording Studio in Lincoln, Nebraska, but sounds as though it were recorded live in a haunted hut somewhere in an Ecuadorian rainforest. At night. Take, for instance, the opener, ""Lightning Risked It All,"" which begins with wooden percussion, a sparse acoustic wrenched out of tune after each note, and the lines, ""Still no guides/ It's not a generous world/ It is a separate world/ The bad luck taste of the dark/ The broad luck of blood on the water."" But these words aren't delivered with any rapidity: you're given enough time between each line to consider eternity. A random kickdrum might snap you back to reality, as might subtly increasing percussion. Or you might continue wandering off, set further adrift by the increasingly restless wooden clacks that sound like water dripping in puddles. The rest of the album isn't much different, with the bulk of its tracks rarely progressing from where they begin. South American percussion usually offers tempered accompaniment along with a thunderous piano, both of which are occasionally complimented by a Spanish guitar, pedal steel, glockenspiel, eerie keyboard-chorus or shrill triangle. And Molina's voice inevitably enters in, usually after the one-minute mark, to deliver, in a death-bed rasp, lines such as, ""Death as it shook you/ You gave it a fool's look/ You said I am an empty page to you"" (""The Body Burned Away""), or, ""Simply to live, that is my plan/ In a city that breaks us/ I will say nothing"" (""No Limits on the Words""). But what really holds the album together-- perhaps better than the choice of instruments, lyrics, or Molina's voice-- are the tropical birds. Unlike, say, Phish or Quasi, Molina doesn't tactlessly plop a mess of birds in the middle of his album. Instead, birdsong slides in now and then, reminding you where you are (the tropics, fool). Only occasionally do the chirps reach a cacophony, as on the two instrumental tracks entitled ""Ghost Tropic,"" where the birds sound as though they've been awaked by the unsettling music emanating from the hut. None of the eight tracks that comprise Ghost Tropic are true songs. They're more like movements that make up the larger whole of the album, which acts as a 51-minute song. There are no tangible choruses; at best, you'll hear a couple lines repeated two or three times. In short, this is a mood piece. As such, it'll suit your needs perfectly at times, and incompletely at others. The two 12-minute tracks that essentially end the album-- separated only by one of the short instrumentals-- won't seem long enough for you one day, and will be horrendously sluggish and repetitive on another. It's like watching a Brita filter a liter of water: sometimes you're too damn thirsty to wait, so you give in to tap water; other times you hold out, knowing that your patience will make the experience entirely satisfying.","Will Oldham has a doppelganger of sorts in Jason Molina, the singer-songwriter behind Songs: Ohia.

The Masterplan,Oasis,by: Michael Sandlin,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b9935e6ef959693229c1/1:1/w_160/f6d42c23.gif,2000-11-13 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5930-the-masterplan/,Epic,"Let's face it: some outtakes are initially scrapped for good reason. Calling a collection of largely inferior previously unreleased tracks The Masterplan is a little presumptuous, to say the least. But, then again, Oasis have, for years, thrived on presumption, pretension and hype. Until finally, their boasting, preening and carrying- on backfired with 1997's uninspired pop failure Be Here Now. Now that Oasis, too, are bigger than Jesus Christ, they suddenly they find themselves at a major creative impasse. And hey, what better time to hawk a few throwaway tunes to the general public? This previously- ignored garbage gets scraped from the bottom of some dumpster behind Epic records, and packaged as newly- discovered gleaming treasures. Easy, eh? ""Blimey, look wot I found, it's The Lost Oasis Anthology!"" Maybe the Gallagher brothers caught wind of Yoko Ono recently raiding her late hubby's closets for every last note, screech or belch he ever put on tape. ""Noel's brain's in hibernation, chaps,"" you can hear Liam saying. ""Somebody raid the rubbish dump. Check in a basement or dustbin or somethin'. That's where they usually find lost tapes. An' gimme another snort o' that fookin' Borax, chappie..."" On The Masterplan there are a few scattershot moments of crackling energy on ""Fade Away,"" and ""Headshrinker"" that certainly blow away ""Wonderwall"" and ""Alcohol and Cigarettes,"" for example. But they're the kind of updated '60s power-pop anachronisms that Matthew Sweet had already perfected on 1991's Girlfriend and 1993's Altered Beast. ""The Swamp Song"" is an endless, clumsy blues jam. ""Going Nowhere"" is thoughtless, meandering orch-pop. Oasis' Beatles affectations reach unintentional comedic heights on an extended live version of ""I Am The Walrus,"" where Liam turns in a real wheeze of a vocal performance. You begin to realize they might not even pass for a good imitation of Wings, really. I'm afraid this compilation just isn't enough to spark a renewed interest in these quickly fading toss-pots. Obviously, it's much easier for Oasis to package shit as diamonds and chuck it out among the entertainment- starved rabble, rather than actually try and transcend the vacuum they've been writing songs in for so long. (Hunker down in the studio and possibly re-think your incredibly narrow approach to pop tunesmithing, lads?) Being the stubborn Beatles snobs they are, though, they'll most likely continue with the same unforgivably lame Revolver- era Beatles knock-offs while making futile genuflections at the altar of Mr. Paul Weller. Maybe it's about time they debut the talents of the long- forgotten, previously outtaken third Gallagher brother: autistic, pennywhistle- blowing Tosser Gallagher. Poor wanker's been gathering dust in a London basement for years, you know.","Let's face it: some outtakes are initially scrapped for good reason.

Who Stole the I Walkman?,Isotope 217,by: Ryan Schreiber,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Founder</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b9915e6ef959693229bc/1:1/w_160/2f21361d.gif,2000-11-12 06:01:40,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4139-who-stole-the-i-walkman/,Thrill JockeyThrill Jockey,"Isotope 217 was once a jazz fusion band relying almost solely on the catalog of electric Miles Davis to get them through an album. They pulled it off pretty well on record, and even better in concert. But while last year's Utonian Automatic showed massive improvement over their 1997 debut, The Unstable Molecule, the last thing I expected them to pull off was a genre-bending blend of creative jazz and German-style minimalist electronica. Yet, here it is in all its glory: Who Stole the I Walkman? The album's bizarre title merely hints at what lies inside. Burbling cut-ups of incidental noise boil over rumbling bass tones and insect sounds. Subtle preprogrammed keyboards and digital twicks tumble along sporadic percussion. Backwards instruments float softly upon grids of glassy space effects. And mingling with these warped squirm-atics are elements of the tried-and-true jazz-funk Isotope 217 have cranked out on past efforts. Who Stole the I Walkman? is, simply put, the next level of jazz. Isotope 217 meld genuinely inventive ProTools ambience with fusion, and end up with a genre that has never been explored. Their unsettling mixture of casual found sound, chopped clicks, gentle tones, and augmented chords is strangely comfortable, and the combination achieves a remarkable seamlessness, considering that these two styles of music were invented more than 30 years apart from each other. It also didn't hurt that Casey Rice-- who has, since the early '90s, evolved from an assistant engineer on Liz Phair's Exile in Guyville and the Sea and Cake's self-titled debut, into a studio wizard whose angular manifestations as Super ESP have hoisted him amidst the electronic elite-- recorded the album. ""Harm-O-Lodge"" kicks off the largely downtempo record with an almost random bassline which serves as a meandering foundation for the song's sampled Atari beeps, cropped cymbal crashes, and insane sax. ""Moonlex"" opens with quiet, pre-set crowd noise-- likely from any of the billions of shows they've played at Chicago's prestigious Empty Bottle venue-- and over four minutes, melts into a thick syrup of Rob Mazurek coronet, computer-generated drones and various reversed instruments. The crowd theme continues throughout ""Kidtronix,"" but this time, there are twice as many people in the audience. Over the scenester racket, Isotope lay a chaotic assemblage of manipulated bass, jingle bells, and purposefully clumsy drumming. But the album's standout is easily ""Sint_d,"" which consists of warm, organ- impersonating keyboards spilling microwaved chords over a series of clicks and cuts straight off a Mille Plateaux label sampler. Who Stole the I Walkman?'s cover art is an homage to Squirrel Bait's self-titled album, but it's hard to know why they chose it for this album-- the record itself certainly doesn't sound anything like Squirrel Bait. Utonian Automatic featured nondescript, blurred photos that seemed to suggest genitalia (maybe it's just me), while The Unstable Molecule more accurately depicted the splattered disarray of their music with an oil painting of jumbled shapes. But the simple silver mosaic is oddly fitting for Who Stole the I Walkman?, in that, if nothing else, it looks ""computery."" It hints that there've been some unexpected changes in the Isotope camp. This record breaks barriers for Chicago's tireless post-rock addiction, breathing new life into the city's stagnating avant-garde and jazz scene. Solely on the merits of its electronic facets, Who Stole the I Walkman? would blow away such recent innovators as Autechre and Squarepusher in terms of sheer originality. But combined with the band's trademark fusion skronk, it is the birth of a new music, and the resuscitation of truly exploratory jazz.","Isotope 217 was once a jazz fusion band relying almost solely on the catalog of electric Miles Davis to get ...

Remixes: 1997-2000,Jazzanova,by: Paul Cooper,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b9ddea9e61561daa70b6/1:1/w_160/afe0f816.gif,2000-11-08 06:01:40,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4225-remixes-1997-2000/,CompostCompost,"Jazzanova, the Austrian nu-jazz collective and Sonar affiliate, appear to view this album as a handy portfolio. Just as freelance graphic designers carry around a folder of their snazzy java jacket designs for the local coffeehouse or program booklets for the neighborhood Peanut Butter Contemporary Kids Christian Street Dance Theater Ten-Year Jamboree, Remixes 1997-2000 serves as a quick introduction to give you a firm idea what they can do for your act. In unexpected antithesis to the resurrectional artwork of Creed's Human Clay, these discs come functionally housed in brown cardboard, lest we get distracted from their 20 minor variations on light bossa beats and smooth Hancock chords. Miraculously, though, some Jazzanova remixes have ousted the original versions. Who remembers the King Britt mix of Ursula Rucker's succulently breasted (just listen!) ""Circe?"" The tech house has been altered to make time for a Sunday evening ale or two. As a bonus for ham-fisted DJs, Jazzanova have incorporated the exact sample as used by Daniel Ibbotson in his ""Things Change"" track. DJ-friendly this may be, but it sure isn't going to wake, say, the Elephant 6 collective into ""outside the box"" thinking. The Jazzanova rework of Ski's ""Fifths"" exhibits two noticeable tendencies of this collection. Firstly, in an attempt to dupe us into believing that the band have earned their remix-fee and actually come up with fresh music, Jazzanova sample the Larry Levan mix of Gwen Guthrie's ""Seventh Heaven"" and clunkily incorporate that song's signature squiggle. By doing this, Jazzanova perhaps think they can convince us that they're spontaneous, off-the-wall, and possibly a smidgeon out-to-lunch. We're not fooled. To its credit, the remix finds all the right shimmy-shimmy dynamics, but dropping that squiggle is awkward at best. Secondly, who the hell is Ski? Do Jazzanova scour the world for jazz-dance acts that only the sub-editors at Straight No Chaser care about? If the band's reputation bears any weight, we'd expect to find huge names on this collection of three years' worth of sweet labor. So where are they? Why is it that Groove Armada and Deep Dish get to tinker with Madonna's ""Music"" and not these fellows? Are Destiny's Child Austriophobes? Would the bassist from Jamiroquai walk out if this lot were let loose on their precious grooves? I can't believe record companies are fearful of what Jazzanova might hand over. As Remixes 1997-2000 amply testifies, this band are utterly dependable; one can be entirely certain how the remix will sound. It comes down to one of two reliable styles: a bossa groove or a batacuda thumpathon. Either way, it gives lazy DJs huge amounts of style points (one copy sold to Paul Oakenfold! Another shipped to Dave Ralph!). The one thing I'm still unclear on is why the biggest names artists-- 4 Hero, Incognito, MJ Cole-- all bear Gilles Peterson's stamp of approval? I'd like to suggest that the band's consistency and dependability, rather than launching them into riches beyond the dreams of avarice, have rendered the band and their work unfortunately ignorable. Record execs know they're not going to be paying for a Jazzanova mix that incites like ""A Galaxy of Scars,"" the high-anxiety samba that opened the Third Eye Foundation's You Guys Kill Me. This is a real shame. Yet more annoyingly, you can hear nagging echoes of far greater mixes in Jazzanova's lesser sounds. During the mix of Liquid Lounge's (who?) ""Complete Life,"" the vocalist is left to perform a passable ""Relax""-era Holly Johnson ""nya nya nyaah,"" for example. Fittingly complementing these unimaginative reworks are the unimaginative track titles. Scanning the tracklist is akin to reading every sentence on a detention blackboard: ""[name of remixee] Jazzanova Mix."" Sure, this is functional-- it lets everyone know who's on the job. But where's the flair, the wit, the slightest amount of interest? You don't find Richard D James simply signing his work ""The Aphex Twin Mix."" Given how much of a chore remixing has become in recent years, I'm imagine that inventing a snappy title for your version is one of the few really fun parts. But Jazzanova, like the Cinematic Orchestra, take everything just a little too seriously. So, we must ask ourselves, is jazz-dance really quite the most tedious genre in music? Not at all. Jeff Sharel's self-titled album floors with its delicately OvalProcess-esque take on jazz dance-afro beat fusion. And how about the special funky mess of Chet Baker's 1977 version of ""Love for Sale"" with Alphonso Johnson on a nether-hugging Moog? Or San Francisco's Luv N' Haight, who adoringly compile bags of jazz-dancy goodies that abound in irresistible exuberance? Clearly, the genre is more than sufficiently capable of delivering excitement in armfuls. For Jazzanova, though, their melodic predictability is their selling-point. They've crammed their portfolio with stolid workouts and earnest pastiches. These are far from ideal qualities when it comes to an album. Any of these tracks inserted into a set would usher in a soothing ersatz Rio carnival vibe, but releasing it all in a block like this offers the band little credit. I could be apologetic and state that this was bound to occur, given the band's preferred method of referencing not only the source track, but also other tracks by the remixed artist. This, of course, is utter shit-- to appreciate superlative remixing skills you only have to consider what a stupendous transformation the Fat Cat roster pulled off when asked to tackle Emilana Torrini's lumpen Love in the Time of Science LP. I'm caught. I want uplifting, challenging, complex, beard-free, fun, jazz-dance! I want to be captivated by their takes on art, life, and humanity! Yet, if I want to find these things out about Jazzanova-- what they can really do when released from remix pressure-- I'm left hunting for a three-song EP released in 1998, and their one-off, ""Fedtime's Flight,"" from a year earlier. Needless to say, that shit just doesn't cut it. Hrrumph. Well, at least I'll always have Chet to fall back down on. I'm never left in doubt as to what motivates him.","Jazzanova, the Austrian nu-jazz collective and Sonar affiliate, appear to view this album as a handy portfolio. Just as freelance ...

Given that he was the frontman for the classic 80's panstick-and-synth band Japan, and that he's played Icarus so many times with the ferocious prog-rock sun, the fact that he's not a punchline to a Where Are They Now segment on VH1 persistently astounds. Japan, contrary to the beliefs of the uninformed, were not just another panstick-and-synth act. Entirely separate from Ultravox, Visage, Spandau Ballet, and of course, Duran Duran, Japan confused New Romantic signifiers and slipped some awe-inspiring songs past the phalanx of make-up artists and featured-in-The Face costume engineers. Though Japan never had the overwrought campy wit of ABC or the low-rent wink of the Human League, Japan can justifiably claim to have written a song (maybe even two) that should become a standard. When I first heard ""Ghosts"" (my prime candidate for elevation into the Canon), my head had previously been cluttered with Duran Duran's ""Planet Earth"" (primarily because my classmates and I would recreate the rhythmic synthline by tapping our wooden rulers up and down the edges of our desks) and Depeche Mode's ""See You"" (primarily because my yet-to-break voice could just about carry that simple tune whilst replacing ""see"" with ""bonk"" or any scatological verb we could come up with in fits of short-trousered laughter). The slow thrump of marimbas and Sylvian's dry, too-many-Gitanes lament of this track gave my 12-year-old mind extreme pause and sent me into a premonition of mid-life anxiety. Even at twelve, I knew I would never compare that song with ""Girls on Film."" Like ""Autumn Leaves,"" it's an indelible, perennial melancholy. It's one of the realest, most human, songs I have ever heard. And even if David Sylvian had turned into a bloated sack of toss like some of his VH1 vaudevillian New Romantic contemporaries, I would still praise him for giving the world that song. However, Sylvian habitually overeggs the custard; he simply can't resist the temptation of slipping some arty prog-rock beneath the radar. Remember, two steps from David Sylvian lies Marillion's toss-strewn territory. I think Sylvian recognizes how epochal ""Ghosts"" was and remains to be. Though the other songs on its host album, Tin Drum, attempted to incorporate a similar curl of deep contemplation, nothing managed the simplicity and grace. Sylvian's post-Japan career, I believe, has been a striving for another ""Ghosts."" And while I don't believe he's succeeded, his attempts have always fascinated me. Sylvian's songs, their blend of poetic regret and delicately dismal cadences, are like loved ones who clasp their hands against your cheeks to hold you still in order to tell you a hurting truth. Alas, he's not achieved his goal. You have a whole lot of earthmoving to do to reach that tender core. The two discs of Everything and Nothing compile previously unreleased, re-recorded, and lesser known tracks from Sylvian's post-Japan career. Though the ponderous title of this collection is occasionally mimicked in the music, this retrospective is largely contemplative and charmingly overblown. This is such pretentious toss that I can't help but adore it. Unlike the pretension of Gary Numan or Rush, Sylvian never forsakes beauty; he just chooses to shine a trillion-lumen floodlight upon a tender moment. Sylvian will never escape the often justifiable charge that he expresses his emotions in a studied, calculated manner. Everything and Nothing provides ample material to back this up. Sylvian sounds burdened by the cachet that his collaborators will bring him. He sounds as though he's got to make the most of working with Holger Czukay, Jon Hassell, and Marc Ribot. Though these collaborations never collapse into utter muso-boarishness, these songs have an undeniable plod factor to them. ""Weathered Wall,"" excerpted from the Brilliant Trees album, and performed with Czukay twiddling a Dictaphone and an SW radio, sneaks away without sounding too much like a stodgy art piece. ""The Scent of Magnolia"" (previously unreleased and drawn from the Dead Bees on a Cake sessions) mixes Bill Frisell's indie-sanctioned jazz guitar with martini-lounge beats. The naked sincerity of ""Heartbeat (Tainai Kaiki II)"" is spoilt by the screeching guitar that marauds its cock-rock way across the song's sweet sward. ""Blackwater,"" excerpted from the Rain Tree Crow project that served as a reunion for the members of Japan, sounds like a Mike and the Mechanics song that's gone hoity-toity and entirely too uptown. ""Albuquerque (Dobro #6)"" is a brief but utterly Saks Fifth Avenue appropriation of twanky American folk that features a dobro and Sylvian imagining himself as-- heavy-handed wordplay ahead-- a soul proprietor. I suppose the New Mexico tourist board can at least thank Sylvian for not crooning about a mistaken left turn at Albuquerque like Bugs Bunny did so many times. Hey, if your state were being turned into a dumping ground for nuclear waste, you'd be grateful for such crumbs, too. ""Ride"" picks up Sylvian's Western theme, as he shouts ""saddle up and ride away!"" against the tsunami swells of a nine-thousand piece orchestra and some lone trumpeter who's spent way too much lolly on mystic Miss Cleo's attempt to draw down Miles Davis' mojo from some ethereal plane. ""The Golden Age"" is a lounge-industrial indictment of decadence, reminiscent of a cello-and-clank version of Talking Heads' ""The Overload"" as performed by doom-and-double-mochachino string quartet Apocalyptica. ""Pop Song"" is hardly true to its title. The late 80's synthfunk and the fuck!-my-keyboard-player's-a-nutjob solo would sit awkwardly in Carson Daly's playlist, and Sylvian's moaning about the Sunday Supplements' being at the beck and call of the government isn't exactly graceful, either. Besides, by harassing the glossy magazines that accompany the Sunday New York Times, isn't Sylvian attacking his own audience? Since Gentlemen Take Polaroids, Sylvian has shown his ambivalence towards popular music. When he wrote and performed ""Nightporter,"" he was flashing his contempt for new-wave rawness. He was courting the conservatoire while thumbing his nose at the kids. Or perhaps he wanted to make sure that Ultravox wouldn't get away with the amateurish ""Vienna."" Sylvian is an awkwardly transgressive artist that fails more often than he succeeds in combining avant-gardish elements with his unmistakable grasp of the pop song form. Nonetheless, I'd like to suggest that Sylvian explore more electronic territory. As ""Godman"" and the bowed-cymbal ambient project Approaching Silence prove, he has a Prince-like appreciation for sound. In the same way that Pete Astor reinvented his shuffly jangle pop into the lo-fi electronica of the Wisdom of Harry, if Sylvian dropped his Peter Gabriel by way of Bryan Ferry shtick, he would truly achieve something remarkable. While he persists being an irritatingly partial success, Sylvian will garner only the fawning empty praise of his fans and stark indifference from the rest of us.","David Sylvian's career has never been less than remarkable. Given that he was the frontman for the classic 80 ...

Halfway Between the Gutter and the Stars,Fatboy Slim,by: Rich Juzwiak,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd61eb335119a49ece7d/1:1/w_160/664f5dc5.gif,2000-11-07 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3008-halfway-between-the-gutter-and-the-stars/,AstralwerksSkint,"After enjoying a few years of relative popularity, it seems big-beat's appeal and relevance are waning. Like a designer club drug that delivers heady waves of euphoria before cutting out, leaving the brain depressed and deprived of seratonin, this hip-hop/breakbeat/techno (with a dash of rock n' roll) hybrid is rapidly fading. True, big-beat by the likes of the Chemical Brothers, the Propellerheads, and our subject at hand, Fatboy Slim has gone strong for a good two and a half years-- far longer than your average hit of ecstasy. After listening to Slim's latest, Halfway Between the Gutter and the Stars, it seems we've reached come-down time. And surprise! It's no fun at all. Like technology, the nature of electronic music remains in an eternal state of flux: constantly changing, evolving, and effortlessly remaining hip. Kitschy disco throwbacks and penchants for analog keyboards aside, subgenres like drum-n-bass and big-beat that combine, rather than defy, previous influences have a relatively short shelf-life. The dank, yellow-fluorescent glow of stagnation that emanates from Halfway is emblematic of the decline. I'm tempted to give Norman Cook the benefit of the doubt and assume that he's at least slightly aware of this. After all, this is the guy who, on his solo debut, Better Living Through Chemistry, sampled the Who's ""I Can't Explain"" and transformed it into the hyper break-filled dancefloor throwdown ""Going Out of My Head."" This is the guy who carved funk out of the light jangle of Cornershop's ""Brimful of Asha."" These previous recordings and a slew of others, dependent on Slim's often impeccable taste for hooks and samples, have proven him able to reach virtuoso status when it comes to filling the dancefloor. In short, he's proven himself as a shrewd producer whose intelligence is not to be discounted. It's perhaps because of these past successes that Slim seems a divided man on Halfway, his undeniably difficult third LP. At times, he continues his role of happy-go-lucky party music mastermind, as on the acid-house-tinged anthem ""Star 69"" or the similar ""Retox."" Both tracks feature incessant vocal samples of only a few words over throbbing, gooey beats. Slim's playing it safe here, doing what he knows he does best: mindless music meant for little more than dancing. Of course, with the current state of big-beat, these tracks sound all but redundant, but you can't fault a guy for preserving what he helped popularize, right? Slim, though, apparently feels some pull from his previous Top 40 hits and tries a few stabs at reclaiming that popularity from the masses. If his big-beat tracks on Halfway are somewhat of a musical stagnant pond, the more commercial-minded tracks here are like the resident fish flailing and gasping for oxygen once the pond has dried up. The record's first single, ""Sunset (Bird of Prey),"" with its techno-lite arrangement and spooky Jim Morrison sample, is a glaring example. It's a mere quarter-inch away from Enigma territory and would have fit nicely on Pure Moods 3 had it been released in time. Even worse than ""Sunset"" are the collaborations with neo-soul poseur, Macy Gray. ""Love Life,"" in particular, allows Gray to ramble aimlessly for almost seven minutes over a quasi-funk/R&B; beat, rather than adhering to standard verse-chorus-verse conventions. At the song's conclusion, she breaks it down ""Sesame Street""-style: ""Said I'm gonna A ya/ And I'm gonna B ya/ And I'm gonna C ya, gonna D ya/ If I E ya, 'cause I wanna F ya/ Yeah, I wanna F ya/ Yeah, I wanna F ya."" It's all really too embarrassing. So, Slim gave it a third shot and ended up with a lackluster-- spotty at best-- finished product. Can't blame him for trying, as the problem lies more with the everchanging landscape of electronic music and the dying big-beat genre than it does with his technical skill. To paraphrase a character from last year's British slice-of-club-life film, Human Traffic, ""When the comedown outweighs the fun, the party's over."" This is exactly the problem with Halfway Between the Gutter and the Stars, and most of the popular big-beat currently being offered. I hear two-step garage is gonna be massive, though. Can't wait.","After enjoying a few years of relative popularity, it seems big-beat's appeal and relevance are waning. Like a designer ...

"Model 3, Step 2",Microstoria,by: Mark Richardson,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c46313d197565213bf42/1:1/w_160/16e95746.gif,2000-11-07 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5273-model-3-step-2/,Thrill JockeyThrill Jockey,"Every once in a while, I find a record that causes me to hear music in a new way. One of my most profound examples is a Microstoria release that has an Oval remix called ""Microstoria Runtime Engine"" on one side and Stereolab's mix of ""Endless Summer NAMM"" on the other. I picked up this unassuming 12"" used a few years ago, just before a long weekend when, for some reason, most people close to me were out of town. During those blessed three days of solitude, I listened to that Oval remix probably twenty times, and my amazement grew with each spin. Drawing elements from five different Microstoria tracks, Oval's Markus Popp (who was, in a sense, remixing himself since he comprises one half of Microstoria with Mouse on Mars' Jan St. Werner) created with ""Runtime Engine"" a piece that was both the most ""digital"" track I'd heard and the most organic. The way the various clicks, buzzes and drones were organized, ""Runtime Engine"" didn't sound ""played"" by something living, but seemed to be some kind of life in itself. The image that came to me during the first few listens was a heavily magnified film of cells diving in the womb. As the various loops interacted with and built upon each other, the components remained the same but swelled according to some strange underlying algorithm. And this precise arrangement of seemingly random electrical impulses struck me as very beautiful. I still put on ""Runtime Engine"" every month or so (it's also on the Microstoria remix album Reprovisiors), and it hasn't lost its luster. But there is a downside to this kind of listening transformation. I've spent the years since digesting clicks, cuts, glitches and squirms in search of something with similar personal impact, and it's hard to come by. This exploration has led me through the complete catalogs of both Microstoria and Oval, and still, nothing for me matches ""Runtime Engine"" for sheer wonder. Model 3, Step 2 is Microstoria's first studio album since 1996's snd, and while it's very good, it falls short of that highly subjective ideal. Still, this is a fine collection of warm, glitchy ambience that should appeal to admirers of abstract electronics. Much more subdued than Oval's more recent efforts, and more random than St. Werner's solo work as Lithops, Microstoria find a happy medium of strange, nervous, consistently surprising atmospheres. Drawing from similar sound sources as Ovalprocess (sampled guitar buzz digitally stretched to its limit, oddly percussive texture shifts, manipulated organ chords), Microstoria construct an alien, yet still oddly familiar environment. One reason I think Microstoria is lost on people is that they think of it as ""ambient"" music to be played quietly while doing something else. Quite the contrary, music this dependant on detail demands to be played loudly, preferably through a decent stereo or headphones. ""Glocky Bit"" features layer upon layer of delicate sound buried beneath its bass-heavy synth chords. These tiny repeating melodies hover several leagues beneath the more menacing surface, adding levity to the outwardly oppressive foreground. The distantly pop ""Flexen"" is a glowing drone constantly bumped off track by digital clicks, and only at volume can one hear just how. Close your eyes and crank ""Paro Fadeout"" and you'll swear you're floating in the ocean, listening to a whale trying to speak the language of a submarine. Model 3, Step 2 may not represent a paradigm shift, but it deserves to be heard.",,8.0,
Parachutes,Coldplay,by: Spencer Owen,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a61cc0084474cd0c08a2/1:1/w_160/244d0414.gif,2000-11-07 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1539-parachutes/,Nettwerk,"Pretty, lovely, fine, fair, comely, pleasant, agreeable, acceptable, adequate, satisfactory, nice, benign, harmless, innocuous, innocent, largely unobjectionable, safe, forgettable. I have just summed up in 19 words what I am about to say about Coldplay's debut full-length, Parachutes, in 600. Aside from being seemingly tailor-made for the paper-thin adult contemporary market, what is it about this Britrock quartet that's driving them up the American charts? Is it their popularity in their home country, or their Mercury Music Prize nomination? Could it be their charming, boyish good looks? Perhaps, even, a reputation built by Noel Gallagher's projected insistence that they're ""a bunch of fuckin' pansies, the lot of them?"" In reality, Coldplay's secret deadly weapon is vocalist Chris Martin. With the ability to mimic a Brit-accented Dave Matthews one minute, Jeff Buckley revived from the dead the next, and sometimes even a young Peter Gabriel, Martin's heartfelt delivery seems to be what's winning the hearts, wallets and alternative radio request lines of Americans young and old. That's not to say that the rest of the group isn't sharp. Guitarist Jon Buckland provides plaintive, strummed acoustic guitar with the occasional amplified wail, and bassist Guy Berryman with drummer Will Champion form a competent rhythm section. Oh yeah, the songs. They're nothing special. Most of the 10 tracks on Parachutes are indeed pleasant enough, often consisting of standard alterna-pop fare with the occasional folky ballad. They're innocent and inoffensive in general, but in turn, they're also exceedingly generic and immediately forgettable-- so much so, in fact, that after a minute of one song, you've usually already forgotten what the last song sounded like. And that's even after a few listens. Parachutes opens with ""Don't Panic,"" the title of which is likely lifted from British mock sci-fi classic The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, despite the fact that the song has nothing to do with it. This subdued, dreamy opener contains Martin's falsetto chorus of ""We live in a beautiful world,"" which seems to sum up the overall sentiment of the record; the record also closes with the inspirational swinger ""Everything's Not Lost."" Most of the other songs sort of drift in and out of consciousness, with the exception of the second track, ""Shiver."" It's the only truly decent song on Parachutes, but simultaneously, it's the only one that blatantly shows its influences. In fact, the influence can even be pinned to a single song: Jeff Buckley's ""Grace."" Martin has his Buckley impression down cold, complete with dynamic range and the trademark vibrato. But as enjoyable as the song may be, there's no question that Buckley did it better. And of course, you've probably heard their smash hit single, ""Yellow,"" by now. Indeed, it's the most obvious choice for a single, and it represents Martin's vocal stylings effectively, but it's also the record's weakest moment. Buckland's grating, slightly tuneless guitars seem jarring, especially when sequenced in the middle of a series of songs that generally lack dissonance. And the saccharine lyrics are those that might have caused Mr. Gallagher's hypothetical remark: ""Look at the stars/ Look how they shine for you/ And everything you do."" You'd practically expect the band to show up at your doorstep with a wilting bouquet and Hallmark card. Parachutes is ultimately a promising debut for Coldplay, if by ""promising,"" I mean, ""promising them a windfall of cash and international popularity."" If nothing else, it's harmless and pretty. Unfortunately, it's nothing else. If that's what you look for in your music, by all means, go for it. If you want substance, I suggest moving on.","Pretty, lovely, fine, fair, comely, pleasant, agreeable, acceptable, adequate, satisfactory, nice, benign, harmless, innocuous, innocent, largely unobjectionable, safe, forgettable.

Valedictory Songs,The Bevis Frond,by: Matt LeMay,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a2935e6ef95969320445/1:1/w_160/9cd5daf0.gif,2000-11-07 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/682-valedictory-songs/,RubricWoronzowRubricWoronzow,"I was always a bit perplexed by the fact that ""lo-fi"" was given credence as a genre. I mean, sure, the layers of tape hiss and analog crust did give lo-fi music a unique sound. But it seemed to be an utterly superficial distinction, and one which had little bearing on why I was such a big lo-fi fan for so long. I mean, Bee Thousand is one of my favorite albums of all time; it could've been produced by Todd Rundgren for all I care. The songwriting was the only ingredient necessary. Notice how much of that is in past tense. The perhaps ill-titled lo-fi genre has all but disappeared. Just pop in the latest album by Pavement, Sebadoh, or Guided by Voices for proof. Or the Bevis Frond. That's right, Valedictory Songs, Nick Saloman's first record on Rubric, is thoroughly produced-- no hiss, no clipping, no crust. What's more, the record is Saloman's first studio release in years that includes touring band Andy Ward and Adrian Shaw, whose instrumentation on last year's live Frond record proved them more than technically proficient. When I received Valedictory Songs in the mail, I was hoped desperately that it would be an album every bit as good as Saloman's last two solo outings under the Bevis guise, the irrepressibly cool North Circular and Vavona Burr. Both of these records are testaments to Saloman's sick talents both as a guitarist and a songwriter, chock full of insanely catchy melodies, air-tight grooves, and enough heavy riffage to keep a Sabbath fan satiated. Saloman also demonstrated a knack for penning compelling organ-driven ballads, as well as the occasional 10-minute anti-corporation/music critic rant. But the truly remarkable aspect of Saloman's work to date isn't the ground it's covered, but the fact that it's been so consistent. Valedictory Songs doesn't break this mold; it's a fine rock record in every possible sense. Nary a weak moment to be found, in fact. But it lacks the strong moments, the backbone of past efforts. Valedictory Songs finds Saloman in more ballad-heavy territory than on previous releases. ""High on a Downer,"" ""The Speed of Light,"" and the mid-tempo, '70s-inspired ""Early Riser"" certainly tread closer to ""monster ballad"" status than anything Saloman has done in the past, due in no small part to the syrupy, multi-tracked vocals. And while all of the ballads on Valedictory Songs are undeniably well-written, never succumbing to soppy-ass lyrics, they just don't have the distinctive edge of other Frond recordings. The album does have a few damned fine rock songs on it, though. The opener, ""Godsent,"" chugs along on a typical Saloman guitar riff, beating '70s rock at its own game. ""China Fry"" swaggers on a slide-guitar riff and a ""you fuckin' ingrate"" chorus that will bring a tear to the eyes of those who miss the days of T.Rex. As a rock songwriter, Saloman is simply unstoppable. Sadly, the lack of musical momentum on Valedictory Songs suggests that he may be slowing down. My suggestion? Take two shrooms and record another album in the morning.","I was always a bit perplexed by the fact that ""lo-fi"" was given credence as a genre. I mean, sure ...

All That You Can't Leave Behind,U2,by: Brent DiCrescenzo,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a8c95e6ef959693212b1/1:1/w_160/a15b454b.gif,2000-10-31 06:00:06,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8329-all-that-you-cant-leave-behind/,Interscope,"The title can work both ways. For the band, ""all that you can't leave behind"" implies facing up to their platinum salad days of the Edge's trademark echo shimmers and Paul ""Bono Vox"" Hewson's Lexus-honk vocals. For the general public, the title reifies our struggle to leave behind the image of Bono hatching from a disco lemon, dressed in that rayon six-pack t-shirt. For a band settled into four-letter pseudonyms from their 1980 debut, breaking up never seemed like an option. From day one, U2 was a rock constellation-- a warplane-- and we expected epics. It's an early affair, a hazy infatuation, that has since bloated into comfortable taking-for-granted. As with all ubiquitous products, the familiarity of logos, slogans, and icons eventually supplants whatever original feelings we may have had. U2 are, indeed, a universal product, much like the Catholic Church Bono humbly admires. The swoosh on The Edge's skully cap, and the golden arches of Bono's glasses spring to mind. Song titles and lyrics on All That boldly declare familiar, safe dogma and generic commandments, such as ""Grace"", ""Peace on Earth"", ""I believe in you,"" ""Won't you take me, take me please,"" ""I know it aches, and your heart breaks,"" etc. This new batch of songs heralds a conscious and welcome revocation of dance-inflected bubbleglam, but scales back too far. In searching so hard for their souls, U2 have hacked away their flesh and skull, leaving a lobotomized approximation of glory. ""Beautiful Day"" opens with bombast after a cheeky keyboard tease, and peaks with Bono's cracking voice in the shouted coda: ""What you don't have/ You don't need it now!"" And so the album climaxes at 3\xBD minutes. The gospel ballad, ""Stuck in a Moment You Can't Get Out Of"", maintains the buzz admirably, again peaking in the coda with Brian Eno's faux-brass keyboard belts. Elsewhere, Eno's fingerprints remain undusted. The album could have benefited from more of him; apparently, it takes Brian Eno + Berlin to = renaissance. ""Elevation"" slaughters hope with reckless chops of the hackneyed sword, as Bono commits songwriting faux pas #1: rhyming ""sky"" with ""fly"" and ""high."" The details will be spared, but you can work it out. Damn you, God and aerodynamics, for making altitude a necessity for flight, in the sky, which happens to be above us. As the album's sticker proclaims, ""Walk On"" is locked and loaded as the second single. Epic midtempo should always follow punchy power-rock, you see. Nice, but unexciting. Here, Bono seems dead set on ruining U2's return with clichés. Minutes after the aforementioned poetic gaffe, he returns with, ""A singing bird in a cage/ Who will only fly/ Fly for freedom."" That little bird is you, guys! Free yourself from your cage! For freedom! The record stomps around in this valley before mounting another two-song peak with ""In a Little While"" and ""Wild Honey"". On the former, the vulnerability of Bono's ""vox"" makes a welcome return from minute 3:30 to inject some heartfelt emotion into the tingling doo-wop. ""That girl!/ That girl!/ She's mine,"" Bono bellows with larynx scratches, evoking the dead spirit of Van Morrison. ""Wild Honey"" similarly ob-la-dis like a giddy Van, and somehow escapes the shame of Bono declaring, ""I was a monkey."" Testament to the band there. But it's back into the dark nadir until the album's closer. Bono joins hands with Sinéad O'Connor in healing the world on the tepid carol, ""Peace on Earth"". ""Jesus, can you take the time/ To throw a drowning man a line,"" Bono asks. Hey, if the world is so dark, take off your sunglasses. Bono's Healing Heart takes a ""look at the world"" on the next track, and discovers that people ""feel all kinds of things."" Indeed. But not even Tom Waits' grizzled pipes could salvage the atrocity of ""New York"". Over one of the best musical beds he's ever been offered, Bono weaves a Hallmark lover's tale, in the city where ""Irish, Italians/ Jews, and Hispanics/ Religious nuts [and] political fanatics/ [Stir] in the stew/ Happily/ Not like me and you."" Subtle breakbeat drumming and glistening guitar be damned, Bono will ruin a song. And so the story goes for the entire album-- one of the band's finest, if not for the tweeting and hooting of The Fly and his grating lyrics. Beautiful day, certainly, but the rest of the week was all jetlag and rain. Can't The Edge sing, too?","The title can work both ways.

Forbidden Love EP,Death Cab for Cutie,by: Camilo Arturo Leslie,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a8dcb1335d7bf16993a6/1:1/w_160/20e7a0b5.gif,2000-10-31 06:00:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2231-forbidden-love-ep/,Barsuk,"More infectious than Ebola! More hooks than your grandpa's tackle box! Sticks like a hanging chad in your brain! Alright, enough, I'll stop. But, seriously, these guys have really got potential to spare. Enough potential, maybe, to someday become a capital ""G"", capital ""B"" Great Band. But what a terrible name! Really. I mean, c'mon, Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band allusion or not, that's a hell of a thing to call yourself. When I'm forced into saying the name out loud, I feel just like the fat white dude from the old IHOP commercial that haunts the pancake house in a cheap masquerade get-up because he can't endure the shame of asking the waitress for ""the rooty-tooty-fresh-and-fruity breakfast, please."" But the important thing is that Death Cab cares. Every release these guys have turned out to date evinces an affectionate attention to detail and an unwillingness to cut corners. From their consistently well-sculpted, sad and saccharine pop songs to the beautifully designed CD sleeves they commission from Thingmakers, these guys obviously enjoy what they're doing. And, most importantly, they want the listener to enjoy it as well. The Forbidden Love EP consists of three new songs and two retooled tracks from this year's We Have the Facts and We're Voting Yes. ""Photobooth"", the eminently hummable opening song, begins with a four-bar intro of lo-fi and cheesily perfect Casio-style dance beat that gives way to the round, warm-blooded splendor of the first verse. The effect attained when the grainy, submerged-sounding lead-off is suddenly overtaken by the fuller and lush sound of the song's main body is powerful. The no-tech Casio beat persists for the song's duration, buried subtly in the mix, and makes a nice percussive counterpoint to Michael Schorr's tastefully restrained drumming. Decorative flourishes like synthesized strings and toy piano effortlessly enhance where they might have obtruded, and keep Benjamin Gibbard's cloyingly sweet melody from becoming stale. The next track, ""Technicolor Girls"", is a lazy ballad whose melody bears more than a passing resemblance to those of Quasi's Sam Coomes. Though pretty, it's definitely the EP's weak link, dragging on longer than is probably called for, and offering little to chew on other than the repetitive, cleanly picked guitar line and a general pleasantness. Things are back on track, though, with ""Song for Kelly Huckaby"". Waltzy, driving drums, nice interplay between the synth lines and the vocal melody, along with the distorted but low-key guitar playing come together beautifully. At times, Gibbard's singing is outmuscled by the synthstrings, but problems with the mix aren't quite enough to sink the song, which is easily as good as anything they've released before. The EP's two final cuts are alternate versions of arguably the best songs off We Have the Facts: ""405"" and ""Company Calls Epilogue"". Ordinarily, this kind of thing is a good indicator that you oughta stay the hell away; 40% of this EP is, after all, old material. Death Cab, however, does a beautiful job of reprising these tracks, revamping not just the arrangements but their entire personality and tenor. The new takes on these two songs are wonderfully refreshing in contrast to the bland demo mixes and alternate versions of most EPs. As you might surmise from the title, ""405 (Acoustic)"" strips the original down to its essence. The omission of the drum tracks leaves the high notes strummed on the upbeat as the song's sole rhythmic force, and the result is striking. Compared to the original, this version is much more intimate as well as, um, pretty. And it's certainly not gonna quell further comparison to Elliot Smith. Gibbard isn't quite the songwriting sophisticate that Smith has been-- yet. But his easy grasp of melody and his great voice bode well for the future. ""Company Calls Epilogue (Alternate)"" boasts several cool changes. Delay has been added to the main arpeggiated guitar line, turning every picked note into two, and a touch of delay has been layered on Gibbard's singing. The song has a more relaxed, narcotic feel to it. Rhythm-wise, the great boom-tap, boom-tap, kick-and-snare bit that underlined the lyrics ""But I can't"" and ""Date's been set"" in the original chorus have been removed, and the drum levels have been lowered to subconscious levels. The result is a floaty effect. The soporific scenery makes the ideal background for the addition of a bright ride cymbal in the pre-chorus that's panned sharp to the left and seems to be coming from directly behind you. Spooky! Again, these guys realize it's all in the details. Yes, they obviously know what they're doing. But they've still got to change that name. I suppose it's working for them, though, what with the Seventeen interviews and all. For now, just hold your breath and hope they don't get huge and make the jump to the ""adult"" market. You'd have to knock them substantial cutie points if they appeared in Cosmo as delegates from the Land of Sensitive Guys, or to weigh in on blowjob technique, or worse still, to appear photographed hanging out with Courtney Love. Or god forbid, Drew Barrymore. Come to think of it, maybe they ought to just add five members and change that name of theirs to God Forbid Drew Barrymore. Yeah!","More infectious than Ebola!

Hashin' It Out,Euphone,by: Spencer Owen,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bcb3abf31b7dc7155da0/1:1/w_160/8e641ddb.gif,2000-10-31 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2846-hashin-it-out/,Jade TreeJade Tree,"The name Euphone has a pleasant connotation. While not technically a word, at least by dictionary standards, it's closely linked to the word ""euphony."" For the ""differently literate"" among you, ""euphony"" means a sound or collection of sounds crafted to please the ear. It implies pure, unfettered joy through music, an uncommon melodic experience that rises above many others. Euphone, then, would appear to resemble an instrument or mechanism responsible for creating this type of euphony. That being said, Euphone still don't quite live up to their namesake, but they're getting closer. Chicago's Ryan Rapsys and Nick Macri are both multi-instrumentalists, but at their hearts, they're simply drums and bass, both part of the former Heroic Doses rhythm section, and masterful at their craft. Unfortunately, 1999's The Calendar of Unlucky Days was a fairly drab record with minimal instrumentation and little jazz-inflected post-rock variety. Luckily, with the 13 new tracks on Hashin' It Out, Rapsys and Macri attempt to bring more diversity to their sound, as well as more guest musicians than ever to flesh it out. And it works; why, without the brilliant, all-star conga work by Dan Bitney of Isotope 217 and Tortoise on ""Do You Up,"" the record would have surely failed! Okay, I'll cut the sarcasm. In reality, the new formula does work to Euphone's advantage. Hashin' It Out isn't a terribly cohesive record, and it does drop in quality near the end, but its pleasures are substantial, common, and fun enough to be commendable. When acting alone, there are more hits than misses this time out, such as the laid-back opener, ""Gyrations,"" featuring electronically manipulated vocals and dreamy, effect-laden guitar and bass. Despite their multi-instrumental capabilities, though, Euphone had the good taste to give their guests some creative input, and it works strongly in the album's favor. The record's finest tracks were created with the help of Jeremy Jacobsen, a member of 5ive Style and otherwise known as the Lonesome Organist. On ""Press On"" and ""Bad Ascending,"" easily two of the record's highlights, Rapsys and Macri act as the skilled rhythm section, adding occasional keyboard accompaniment while Jacobsen contributes complex guitar parts. It all comes off effortlessly, and stands as the closest thing to euphony these guys have created yet. The other two songs featuring Jacobsen don't quite match the others, but they do succeed. ""Where's the B?"" is just over two minutes of pure funk with Jacobsen's occasional angular guitar. Without Jacobsen, Euphone seem to meander a bit more. The record's oddball is ""Newscast,"" a minute-long foray into the world of composing theme music for your local TV news program. But tracks like ""Nick is Ryan"" seem to create the result of effective spontaneity that many of the others on Hashin' It Out strive for. And while the rest achieve varying degrees of success-- excepting ""Confirmation of Suspicions,"" the aimlessly rambling five-minute closer-- there's rarely another memorable melody or structure to be found. Euphone have finally discovered that collaboration is the key to their success, and Hashin' It Out is the proof. That's not to say that they aren't talented on their own, but if Jeremy Jacobsen joined Euphone to create a full-time trio, perhaps we could expect more cohesive results on their next effort. Far be it from me to offer a band career advice, of course, but it never hurts to mention it, right?","The name Euphone has a pleasant connotation.

No Kill No Beep Beep,Q and Not U,by: Brent DiCrescenzo,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a1cdb1335d7bf169834c/1:1/w_160/2c081637.gif,2000-10-31 06:00:03,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6626-no-kill-no-beep-beep/,Dischord,"In the psychological search for the roots of behavior, the simplified final verdict comes down to environment versus genetics. If music can be brought into the study, chromosomes might as well throw in the towel, since environment seems to have behavior in a headlock when you put D.C. under the scope. The first five seconds of ""Fever Sleeves"" project more D.C. landmarks than the Mall. Taking a quick survey of the city, we find ghettos reaching into suburbia and suburbs reaching into ghettopia. Georgetown gentrification rubs against white government blocks as other sectors rot under boarded windows. So, it's not surprising that pop bands from D.C. can carry nasty faces and ragged edges, while hardcore bands may spice their spikes with coats of glucose. Q and Not U roll out of the mold of the Capitol dome in the stereotypical D.C. form and find an ideal home in the roster of D.C. archivists, Dischord Records. For Dischord's 20th Anniversary, No Kill No Beep Beep serves as suitable a summation as the label's upcoming box set. Beeping guitars flutter, thrash and crash like wuxia. Drummer John Davis leads the listener through the herky-jerky chaos like an acrobatic fullback. At times, the rhythms and changes rumbling from his kit hog too much spotlight, and songwriting takes a backseat to cluttered post-hardcore aerobics. Q and Not U pummel through their disc in piecemeal haste. Duel guitars stutter to spit out all they learned from Fugazi and Circus Lupus. This is punk rock filibustering. Loopy finger-tappings and harsh pick-hammerings take precedence over the chordal strumming of those other cities. Lyrically and vocally, the band's three singers follow the lead of the guitars-- cutting and spewing random thoughts that smash suburban imagery with violence, politically charged vocabulary, and disdain. The result is a sometimes silly, sometimes screamy mishmash of typical collegiate new-wave ramblings. Take lines like, ""Kill me with that favorite comb,"" and, ""We breathe clock and telephone/ Basement fires keep us so alive."" They mean little more than rock din. Q and Not U have a notion of what they should sound like, but haven't yet discovered what they will and can sound like. Their best song, ""End the Washington Monument (Blinks) Goodnight"", mimics the loose Fugazi of End Hits. They proclaim: ""Inside the convex lens/ We all crash new jet planes tonight,"" in an attempt to emulate their icon, Fugazi's Guy Picciotto, who put it much better when he sang, ""Your eyes/ Like crashing jets/ Fixed in stain glass/ With no religion."" Still, few bands sound like this, and even fewer towns sound like this. Zeal may outmeasure experience and uniqueness, but blaming D.C. for producing Q and Not U is like blaming Keebler for making cookies. A scene which constantly cannibalizes and cross-inspires, D.C. looks to produce some slight new variations yet. No Kill No Beep Beep comes with all the frustrations and thrills of a debut. I'm just waiting for them to put the ""new"" in ""new wave.""","In the psychological search for the roots of behavior, the simplified final verdict comes down to environment versus genetics. If ...

"Stories From the City, Stories From the Sea",PJ Harvey,by: Spencer Owen,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c06ceb335119a49ed3b9/1:1/w_160/d87ccf6b.jpg,2000-10-31 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3756-stories-from-the-city-stories-from-the-sea/,Island,"My philosophy has always included the tried-and-true motto, ""You have to take the good with the bad, and the bad with the good."" More and more, though, I'm beginning to wonder if there aren't some holes in that philosophy. Good and bad are, by definition, polar opposites, but whoever first penned this motto forgot to mention the center of the spectrum: things that are neither good, nor bad, just... there. Do you have to take that as well? After hours of internal deliberation, I've decided you don't. Bland, middling music can often be more offensive than something genuinely awful. If you're hearing something bad, at least emotions and feelings are evoked. Average music, though, just fades into the background. You feel nothing, so you virtually hear nothing; the frequencies are wasted on your ears. You could have used that time to hear something that at least causes some kind of reaction. With each album, Polly Jean Harvey moves gradually from the barrage of passion of her previous work into the central category. 1993's Rid of Me captured her in her raw environment, setting fires and creating primal rhythms with just her electric guitar. On her fifth solo release, Stories from the City, Stories from the Sea, she may be maturing, or more vulnerable, or more vulnerable to her maturity. But regardless, the sheen gets slicker and her music gets duller as the time passes. As inspiration for this album, Harvey spent six months in New York, fully shedding her old wolf's skin for a more stylish, expensive wool-lined jacket. The record begins with ""Big Exit,"" a track that shows Harvey posing as a bored Patti Smith. Granted, the chorus hook is one of her best in recent memory, but even that moment emits a vague feeling of by-product familiarity. ""Good Fortune"" sustains a similar but even more banal pop sound, with Harvey distinctly recalling Chrissie Hynde, both musically and vocally. And ""A Place Like Home"" and ""We Float"" further the tepid attitude, replacing the live drums of the first two tracks with cheap, glossy programmed beats that would feel right at home on a Des'ree record. The lyrics on Stories from the City are just as average as the music-- so average, perhaps, as to seem much worse than they actually are. On ""Big Exit,"" Harvey feels intimidated by this crazy world, singing, ""I want a pistol in my hand/ I want to go to another land."" On ""This is Love,"" she barely elaborates on the already mundane title, adding this seemingly non-sequiturial commentary: ""Does it have to be a life full of dread?/ Wanna chase you 'round the table, wanna touch your head."" Most of the rest of her prose is similarly culled from an elementary rhyming dictionary. Stories from the City does have a couple of songs interesting enough to almost save it from the desert of mediocrity. ""One Line"" provides a pleasant musical backdrop for once, with rhythmic muted guitar, a sustained vibraphone, and ethereal background vocals by Thom Yorke. Yorke then takes a gorgeous turn at lead vocals in ""This Mess We're In,"" continuing with a similar cadence, with Harvey singing the chorus over Yorke's wordless crooning. And ""Kamikaze"" has enough actual aggression and feeling to make it the record's only real standout, featuring a live duplication of a frantic, jazzy jungle beat, rough guitars, and a vocal performance that comes her closest to resembling passion since To Bring You My Love. But three good songs do not a record make. In the end, Stories from the City ends up just slightly to the right of the dead middle ground. A shame, too, since Harvey once used space and dynamic to make exciting music. Now, more often than not, she uses music to make empty space. Optimistic as I am, though, I'd like to look at it this way: as far between as the moments of enjoyment may be, they're still there, which proves Harvey still has a little bit of the knack left. She may now appreciate style over substance, but she surely still loves making music, even if her sense of conviction is less powerful than it used to be.","My philosophy has always included the tried-and-true motto, ""You have to take the good with the bad, and the bad ...

The Fire Show,The Fire Show,by: Ryan Kearney,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd9cea9e61561daa773d/1:1/w_160/28aaeb9b.gif,2000-10-31 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3061-the-fire-show/,Perishable,"On the first Friday of every new year, a fleet of dump trucks winds through the narrow, sloped streets of the seaside New England town where I live and picks up the dry Christmas trees that people have dragged to their curbs the night before. Nearly every resident participates in the ritual, likely out of both convenience and duty: to add ammunition to the upcoming bonfire. This year, I found myself driving around the town much as the trucks had. Usually, one can see a long trail of needles running the length of people's long driveways, but this year a significant snowstorm had hovered over the area for more than a day. So, instead, there were deep, grooved channels in the feathery snow, as one might expect to see in the Minnesota woods in the heart of hunting season. The snow was still falling when I passed the enflamed mountain of Christmas trees on the harborside beach, which the town firemen had ignited without any apparent difficulty. Given the slippery road conditions, I drove by the fire as if in slow-motion. I was surprised to see so few spectators. An event that usually looks like a joyous burning of minor holiday sins instead seemed like a silent vigil to the year 2000. And, indeed, the true death of the millennium coupled with an enormous fire can render one hopelessly reflective. In a rare moment of literary convenience, I happened to be listening to The Fire Show in my car. The band's members-- M. Resplendent, Olias Nil, E.S. Roth and Crian Lubinsky-- refer to their songs as jigsaw puzzles, but their music puzzles more like fire: you can't solve it, only experience it. Like fire, the Fire Show are composed of a consistent molecular structure that continually changes shape. Up close, one can't help but wonder at their irreverent fluctuation and familiar yet unpredictable delivery of sound: each track is five, ten, fifteen songs crashing together; from afar, they don't move at all: the album feels like one long fluid song. The eight-minute album opener, ""F. Pilate,"" begins as you now might expect: with feedback like crackling fire. Labored drums and a casual guitar triumph over the subdued chaos when M. Resplendent sings, ""I'll find my way inside your heart/ My city smog in your country lungs,"" his reverberated voice not unlike Robert Plant's on ""In the Evening."" Then, the eerie song begins a journey in which it loses to the fuzz, clarifies, is enhanced by sternly plucked strings, meets passing noises of indefinite origin, is interrupted by Dylan Thomas, and ends on a poignant note: piano, acoustic guitar, and Resplendent, a vocal chameleon, now soaring above it all. ""Please Kill the Barium Swallows"" has the Fire Show mixing strings similar to those of Godspeed You Black Emperor, with alternately muffled and crisp vocals and guitar pickings straight out the Northwest. As M. Resplendent takes on the appearance of Home's Andrew Deutsch-- one of the Fire Show's nearest kin-- one feels ready for a more straightforward rock song. But then it breaks. Pieces are strewn everywhere, and the Fire Show seems in no rush to put them back together. But the song repairs itself as quickly as it crumbled, and the rush of hearing it is like watching a car crash in reverse. Not until the fourth track, ""The Antipathetic,"" is producer Brian Deck's impact obvious. The distant, hollowed vocals, atmospheric guitar and randomly-trebled drums are all Deck trademarks. That the Fire Show worked with him is no surprise at all, for they also resemble the later, more meandering and experimental work of Red Red Meat. Which is why a comment about Radiohead on their website surprised me: ""I feel betrayed... Perhaps Radiohead have made a completely lovely record, but, in the process, they've sacrificed we-ism for me-ism.... Long live the Rock and Roll Band!"" The Fire Show employ guitars, sure, but they're not a verse-chorus-verse, three-minute rock band. And this record would certainly be considered ""challenging"" by most mainstream rock fans. ""4 Times Through the Angel,"" for instance, relies on a mechanized beat and synth threads. There are also two guitarless ambient numbers. The reason my town's tree-burning wasn't well attended is obvious: the storm. The few who braved the weather saw the relentless snow melt as it came within ten feet of the burning trees, leaving a clear halo around the flames. The few who listen to this album will have a similar experience. It may make you uncomfortable at times, reflective at others, and just as often, it will energize you. But, as reliably as fire itself, this music is sure to transfix you. Just don't try and solve it: you'll end up in the hospital with third-degree burns.","On the first Friday of every new year, a fleet of dump trucks winds through the narrow, sloped streets of ...

Tiny Reminders,Two Lone Swordsmen,by: Paul Cooper,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a85313d1975652139612/1:1/w_160/59df3bbd.gif,2000-10-31 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8223-tiny-reminders/,Warp,"Two Lone Swordsmen have never been less than shrewd predators. Just like the spider's web, their strategy for securing prey is utterly elegant and jaw-droppingly efficient. Rather than churning out remix after remix like Timo Maas or Junior Vasquez, they spin their unique style, take cover, and wait for us to pass by and become entangled in their sticky electro funk. This isn't to say that the duo are indolent scruffs. They rapidly followed up last year's liquid Stay Down with the avant hip-hop of A Virus with Shoes. They reconstructed Paul Weller's ""Heliocentric,"" as well as taking a manky squeegee mop to St Etienne's ""Heart Failed."" They haven't pandered to hard house or courted the self-infantilizing day-glo trance massive. Their vision is fixed and no one can distract them from it. ""Cotton Stains"" capitalizes on the elastic properties of that drum-n-bass staple, the bassline wobbler, by bouncing flecks of sound off its bucking back. ""Machine Maid"" reminds us just how downright gorgeous unfiltered electro-boogie can be. As a dispatch to the two-step messengers, ""Akwalek"" merges a minus-28'd UK garage rhythm with Eno/Lanois ambient guitar. The bubbling percussion caresses as much as it urges you to get down. The tiny reminders of the album's title (there are three of them, in increasingly ornate sophistication) are dense packets of hypermolecules, bearing superficial resemblance to entire Chain Reaction albums, or any number of Stefan Betke's fuzzed-out dub sessions. These congregations of ill vapors cleanse the palette between the thoroughly filthy electro of the other 16 tracks here. Two Lone Swordsmen shape electro and post-punk disco as Henry Moore sculpted the human form. Weatherall's abstract beats are as curvy as they are playful, as precise as they are liberated. Because Weatherall doesn't give props to an erroneously hierarchical tradition, he incorporates whatever he chooses into his tracks. And rather than finding an ancient instructional LP or sampling a stinky b-movie, Weatherall and Tenniswood craft their own twisted sounds and uniquely freaky beats, and thereby give permanence to an inherently vapid genre. By grafting the art house experimentation of Krautrockers Neu! and Can onto post-punk disco, the Two Lone Swordsmen are stoking up the same fires that Liquid Liquid, ESG, Dinosaur L, and (before them all) Cymande ignited years ago. Bet the bastards can hold their own in a punch-up an'all!","Two Lone Swordsmen have never been less than shrewd predators. Just like the spider's web, their strategy for securing ...

Aix Em Klemm,Aix Em Klemm,by: Mark Richardson,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a032b1335d7bf1697f80/1:1/w_160/98ceb5fd.gif,2000-10-27 06:01:40,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/87-aix-em-klemm/,Kranky,"There's a scene in The Graduate where Benjamin Braddock is relaxing in the pool, directly after the montage that follows his first sexual encounter with Mrs. Robinson. His father asks him what he's doing, and Benjamin says, ""Well, I would say that I'm just drifting here in the pool."" His father wants to know why, and Ben answers, ""Well, it's very comfortable just to drift here."" Adam Wiltzie of Stars of the Lid and Bobby Donne of Labradford are two men who understand such comforts. And together, as Aix Em Klemm, they've created a very pleasant place to drift. It's fun to hear a collaborative record like this, where every note can easily be traced to its creator. I imagine Wiltzie to be responsible for the gorgeous guitar drones that pulsate through ""Prue Lewarne"" and ""The Girl with the Flesh Colored Crayon."" Both tracks feature the delicate, low-level hum that his full-time band perfected on The Ballasted Orchestra. Wiltzie also vocalizes on both these tracks (calling it singing isn't quite right) in hushed, reverberating tones. His vocals are just another shading, really, the melody flowing with the current instead of paddling anywhere on its own. The voice is effective, adding a welcome layer of gloomy ambience. Labradford's brand of quiet music has always been too ordered and precise for my taste, somehow lacking a vital emotional component. But on Aix Em Klemm, Bobby Donne's contributions seem the perfect counterpoint to Wiltzie's organic guitar sculpture. On ""3x2 (exit),"" I'm guessing that Donne contributes the high-pitched buzz that burrows between the sheets of feedback, as I remember something similar from E Luxo So. And the otherwise respectful ""Sophteonal,"" which consists mostly of slowly repeated electric guitar picking and delicate piano, gains much from a disorienting layer of computer manipulation. I'm reminded of Markus Popp's contributions to Gastr del Sol's Camoufleur, the way he ran the acoustic information through his notebook computer and returned a digital ghost to the mix. These high-tech embellishments add textures that the lo-fi Stars of the Lid would be unlikely to attempt, and are a large part of what makes this collaboration unusual. The final track, ""Twentyone,"" is a theft of Angelo Badalamenti's ""Twin Peaks"" theme, with its dreamy piano chords and too-pure bassline, but it's so pretty we can forgive the transgression. This is a lovely piece of ambient drone rock, and fans of either band will not be disappointed.","There's a scene in The Graduate where Benjamin Braddock is relaxing in the pool, directly after the montage that ...

Lift Your Skinny Fists like Antennas to Heaven,Godspeed You! Black Emperor,by: Brent S. Sirota,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bf4ec0084474cd0c2ffd/1:1/w_160/e661e567.jpg,2000-10-25 05:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3489-lift-your-skinny-fists-like-antennas-to-heaven/,Kranky,"Jeremiah is Godspeed You Black Emperor!'s prophet. The Hebrew emblazoned in dirty copper on the cover of their Slow Riot for New Zero Kanada EP belongs to him: tohu-va-bohu, it reads: void and waste. The lengthy passage on the sleeve of that EP is lifted from his book. Blase Bailey Finnegan III, the Providence street preacher whose rantings appear on the two first Godspeed You Black Emperor! releases, is his avatar. The music of Godspeed, for all its bombast and lament, extends Jeremiah's ministry into a new millennium. Preaching in a vocabulary drawn from Boston hardcore, in a spidery array of radical leftist rhetoric, Godspeed You Black Emperor! have delivered a blistering (albeit politically imprecise) homily on the new world order. That said, the Canadian nontet's Lift Your Skinny Fists Like Antennas to Heaven is a massive, achingly beautiful work, alternately elegiac and ferocious. However, Lift plays like an oddly transitional album: much of the first disc presents a refinement of the sound that crystallized on 1999's Slow Riot EP, while the second disc flirts with moments of vertiginous shoegazing, looser rock drumming and reckless crescendos of unalloyed noise. Succinctly, the first disc is easily continuous with their earlier work; the second disc might just be the future. The disparity is immediately striking. This is not to suggest that the first disc is not wonderful-- it is, but mostly as a cultivation of ideas and sounds embedded in F#A#oo or Slow Riot. The waltz-like grace of the opening part of ""Storm"" (titled ""Levez Vos Skinny Fists Comme Antennas to Heaven"") is dominated by rising cello and violin which evolve, with the addition of guitars and martial drum taps, into a loud triumphal procession. Blaring trumpets seem to announce the advent of some head of state, and the whole affair proceeds with military discipline and measured effect. The violent explosion never comes: the parade merely approaches and recedes. The second part, ""Gathering Storm,"" begins in entwined guitars: one bowed, one screwdrivered, one gently plucked. With the entrance of the cello, violin and rumbling toms, the guitars begin to shriek in distortion. The effect is amped-up slowcore sludge that's all tension and no release, merely dissipation and noise reminiscent of Cale-era Velvet Underground performances. Seven minutes later, ""Cancer Towers on the Holy Road Hi-Way"" ends the track in crushing paranoia with locomotive percussion thundering toward breakdown. (It is also Jeremiah who predicted that destruction would come from the North.) The second track, ""Static,"" opens with a looped recording of a supermarket welcome message, giving way to indecipherable megaphone vitriol. Sparse piano and drone frames the static-drenched field recordings with mournful effect. ""Chart #3"" is treated guitar drone and distant buzzing similar to records released by the Fatalists or James Plotkin. Piercing static and high frequency ambient yields to the monologue of a fringe Christian preacher. ""When you see the face of God,"" he intones, ""you will die and there will be nothing left of you, except the god-man, the god-woman, the heavenly man, the heavenly women...,"" girded by skeletal string arrangements. Near the end of the first disc, ""World Police and Friendly Fires"" initially reminds me of Erik Frielander's Watchman compositions, and his work with Greg Feldman on John Zorn's Bar Kokhba. Eventually, however, ""World Police"" erupts into thick, layered drone rock (think the Dirty Three, but less dispersed) that sounds like a heavy metal riff slowed to quarter-speed and suddenly accelerated into wailing guitars and slashing strings. It is, I think, the first disc's finest moment. The final part, ""The Buildings They are Sleeping Now,"" is a quiet whoosh of fragmentary strings and deep noise. The disc simply falls apart; the last moments are so inaudible that you're never sure when the music has actually stopped. Murray Ostril introduces the second disc with his reminiscing on the heyday of Coney Island. The sentiment is so politically and religiously neutral that it stands apart from other Godspeed field recordings: nostalgia for the good old days. Nothing more. The second part of ""Sleep,"" ""Monhein,"" is dominated by Efrim Menuck's wailing screwdriver-on-frets effect. From this plodding dirge comes an incredible air raid siren of sound, flagging and rising over the military percussion. But instead of the familiar tension and release, Godspeed opts for maddening sustain. When the drums die out, all that remains is the tremulous scream. After a Labradford-like introduction of repetitive guitar and subtle chimes, ""Broken Windows, Locks of Love Part III"" erupts into sheets of noise somewhere between Loveless and Pangea. The advent of nimble, almost hip-hop drumming, is a shock, and a loose, raucous jam coalesces, recalling Cul de Sac's country-surf-kraut concoctions. Part of you will say: why can't it all be like this? The final track, ""Antennas to Heaven,"" begins with an old mountain folk tune, which is inevitably consumed in processed machine noise. Echoey chimes and looped glockenspiel reverberate through ""Edgy Swingset Acid"" while Francophone children dreamily play and sing. The playground, however, is weirdly menaced by liturgical organs that soon give way to a momentary burst of dense, jangly rock. On ""She Dreamt She Was a Bulldozer She Dreamt She Was Alone in an Empty Field,"" guitars and bells tick-tock over delicate dark ambient, counting the moments as the instruments flare up on fire and descend like a sunset. Godspeed You Black Emperor! have apparently expanded their emotional repertoire of indignation and grief to include joy. But the appropriately titled ""Deathkamp Drone"" is ghostly electronic gloom. The track's final moments are a wash of humming synths, echoing guitars, and pins-and-needles noise that comes just a little too close to human screaming. By the time the piece ends, the tide is way out. Real innovation in a leaderless nontet must be geologically slow. Lift Your Skinny Fists succeeds precisely because it utilizes Godspeed You Black Emperor!'s numbers in a way that previous works did not. Lift opens up its sound to various voices and influences within the collective, letting moments of pop/rock, ambient and even hip-hop blossom where once there was only gravelly symphonics and aural landscape. Those moments were, for me, nothing short of thrilling. This is why Lift shouldn't be accused of merely preaching to the converted fan who has long since accepted the grandiosity of their sound and the vague rhetoric of their dissent. They show signs of doing what they condemn the world for not doing: changing, evolving, experimenting with new approaches, growing. And that's why Godspeed You Black Emperor!-- along with Jeremiah, Blaise Finnegan and every other prophet of doom-- might all turn out to be wrong. Perhaps it does get better before it gets worse.","Jeremiah is Godspeed You Black Emperor!'s prophet. The Hebrew emblazoned in dirty copper on the cover of their Slow ...

In her 1964 essay, ""Notes on Camp,"" Susan Sontag pretty much laid the floor plan for the culture industry to make profitable factory-issue kitsch. You can hear the jingle of change today as it's spewed out in the form of 1-800-COLLECT commercials, hideous neon Old Navy vests and the shamelessness of constant movies being remade. And then there's the fixation on all things outmoded, which becomes a sort of retro-fetishism. It's pretty harmless in most forms, just a retread of the corporate ideas of yesteryear; trinket stores that specialize in 50's metal lunchboxes are an eyesore, but they're also an aspect of Americana. The question, then: when does obsession arise? You can't sell something that doesn't have a shared history that people can identify with. Washington, DC's Barcelona probably understand that. That's why the first song on their new album starts with bubbly Casio keys and the kind of lean, linear drumming that immediately sounds the 80's alarm. But bassist Jennifer Carr's straightforward delivery and cute vocals are bound to bring a wry smile to any former new-waver: ""Your friends all wear too much black/ Girls think it's funny he dances like that/ Boys all think he must be strange/ I don't see what they mean.../ Your hair looks like Robert Smith/ Nightclub straps around your wrist."" Most modern synth-pop bands rely on the form New Order perfected, full of smooth transitions and layered electronic sequencing. Barcelona share some of that sophistication, but their simple keyboard sound harkens further back, to the type of unpredictable analog burps and squiggles that populated the music of the Buggles and Thomas Dolby in the early 80's. There are also elements of indie rock in their music, heard in the way their basic song-frames seem built around guitar, bass and drums rather than extended electronic passages. But here's the catch: each of the four members of Barcelona are computer programmers, and nowhere is this more evident than in the lyrics. ""Bugs"" begins with a gleeful little keyboard melody and guitarist Jason Korzen's vocals, which aren't nearly as endearing as Carr's. He repeats the song title a bunch of times along with the chorus, ""But I've got a plan/ If you'd only hold my hand/ We'll make this through."" That's new wave for you-- dull double-meanings. The bugs could be computer- or relationship- related. Yes, we get it. ""Electronic Company"" opens with some Kinks-esque guitar chords and Korzen's geek fantasy: ""With your hardware, you're almost new/ With my eyes closed, you're almost human."" You'll catch a friend tapping their foot to the beat, but how many will really identify with, ""Given the choice, I'd choose electronic company/ No pain, no hassles, just electricity?"" ""Obsoletion"" shows an introspective side of Barcelona with a downbeat groove that would sound at home on a Peter Murphy record. The verse-trading boy-girl harmony here gets your head nodding, until you hear the lyrics: ""My friends are so unfashionable/ My friends are models from last year/ My friends have strange addictions/ I'm always wishing they would leave."" The kids' assertion in the chorus that this is ""just another way to speak of obsoletion"" doesn't satisfy. Are they being brave here? Or do they not have any friends they care to keep? That question is partially answered on one of the album's better songs, ""Paging System Operator."" Korzen tells the story of himself at 13, just a hacker looking for direction. He finds a pirated copy of ""EA Winter Games"" and dials up the guy who pirated it at his BBS (a precursor to the Internet, where your computer rung up another personal computer). He's seeking guidance, so he creates a chat room to page the guy. You don't find songs about meetings in primitive pre-cyberspace often. It ends in a sort of self-reflective, mirrored moment: on the other end, it's just another 13-year-old hacker. The problem with this album is appeal: new wave kids obsessed with obsolete tech and rhythm sections that sound like early Cure tracks aren't going to sell that many records. But Barcelona are like any great local band-- they'll keep playing their cute songs with studied indifference, perfectly comfortable in their retro world. Or maybe, as Carr suggests on one song, they'll ""have to bring your server down."" But that's the revenge central to so many 80's movies: you eventually develop sympathy for the nerd. Sometimes they even work their way into your heart.","So, as it turns out, there are different degrees of retro. In her 1964 essay, ""Notes on Camp,"" Susan Sontag ...

Eternals,The Eternals,by: Matt LeMay,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bcaf5e6ef95969322ecc/1:1/w_160/d2cb7aff.gif,2000-10-24 05:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2842-eternals/,DeSotoDeSoto,"It's been twenty-five years since George Clinton asked us to give up the funk. But the fact that even Mr. Funkadelic himself couldn't track down the funk these days is testament to the funk's elusive nature. Indeed, trying to track down the funk can be not only difficult, but dangerous as well; it's been known to lead to a variety of maladies, including bad hair and cocaine addiction. Take Rick James: a prime example of what happens when an unprepared individual attempts to tame the funk. So, it's a good thing the Eternals haven't tried to track down the funk. If they did, the funk may be lost forever, depriving future generations of hours of mindless ass-shaking. On their self-titled debut LP, these guys manage to pull out the kind of syrupy, deep grooves that could trap anything, even the wily funk, like quicksand. Furthermore, I'm not sure if the funk could make it past the Eternals without being severely warped and mangled. Catchy and keen as the funk may be, it is fairly predictable, relying on a few tried and true (in some cases, trite and true) rhythmic techniques, most of which involve bass and drums, or heavily wah'd guitars. So, instead of repackaging the old style, the Eternals created some of the thickest, deepest, and most beautifully fucked-up grooves imaginable as their new funk prototype. Insane keyboards and samplers grind like dentist drills under the powerful baritone tremolo and fractured sing-speaking of frontman Damon Locks. But given the nature of his voice, and the similarly dramatic and concise bent of his lyrics, it's often hard to say whether or not his delivery is intended to be taken so seriously. The real beauty of this record is the way the Eternals seamlessly combine so many diverse elements into such a stylistically unique mix. Traces of dub, rock, jazz, reggae, and, yes, the funk, are all present, but thankfully lack the cartoonish exaggerations implemented by other recent bands as a way to garner acclaim. Instead of accomplishing this with a few samples, distorted guitars, a horn section, and a twinge of wah, the Eternals combine the melodic and rhythmic sensibilities of these genres to create a perfectly integrated sound, and then flavor it with their own warped sense of song structure. If there's any criticism that can be levied against the Eternals, it's the fact that, while their music is definitely diverse, the songs on this album tend not to stray far from mid-tempo. But when a band has come so close to perfecting a given style, would it really be all that advantageous for them to try something radically different? Never forget what happened to Sunny Day Real Estate when they tried to become Rush. Yes, a lot has happened to the funk in the past 25 years, as evidenced by the fact that the closest thing to a funk band you'll see on MTV these days is the Red Hot Chili Peppers. A sharp contrast to the Eternals, who eschew the trappings of traditional funk to create the rich, organic grooves the genre could only have dreamed of achieving in 1975.","It's been twenty-five years since George Clinton asked us to give up the funk.

It All Has to Do with It,Town and Country,by: Brent S.

Pitchfork served up a favorable review, but nothing so imperative that it warranted purchase or some form of semi-legal piracy. I have a soft spot for Gastr del Sol's Camoufleur, but I wouldn't call myself a fan. And in the interest of full disclosure, I found Grubbs' beloved The Thicket to be artfully dull. Bill Bradley-dull. Last year, New Haven's 33.3 copped a Grubbsian stance on their Plays Music with predictably somnolent results. Town and Country's It All Has to Do with It treads the same abstract ground. Perhaps the era of detached music is passing. Sure, people bristle at Godspeed You Black Emperor!'s apocalyptic pomposity, but-- calculated or otherwise-- it beats the hell out of Town and Country's studied indifference. You may not like your emotional content spoonfed, but would you rather have it in abeyance? Simply unavailable. Town and Country make music to accompany cigarette-smoking and beard stroking-- it's to be, in a word, appreciated. This is not a particularly sophisticated observation but it seems that music designed to have a solely cognitive appeal must be so intellectually satisfying that the listener is not distracted by the absence of other aesthetic dimensions. Such music must be good to think, and this music isn't. Truth be told, It All Has to Do with It is something of a one-trick pony: Drone. Rinse. Repeat. People will talk about texture, but it's just something to do to keep from turning the television on. It All Has to Do with It has virtually no percussion at all, making it a spectral array of plodding contrabass (two of them!), arty harmonium, muted trumpets and ultra-delicate acoustic guitars. The bells and vibes are obligatory garnishing, and the whole affair is shrill and ugly. The final track, ""That Old Feeling,"" is the album's only promising piece. But the ten minutes of limpid, jazzy noise backed by a remarkably constant piercing drone (and followed by four minutes of screeching, aimless guitar) fail to excuse the prior 25 minutes of irritating drift. It All Has to Do with It is constantly up in the air, lingering: virtually nothing that might suggest a theme, either musically or emotionally. The effect is singularly amazing: the music is so difficult to locate oneself in that you'll always find yourself outside of it, obstructed and pushed around by it. I had several minor epiphanies of how incredibly annoyed this music made me. But just because you're interrogating your threshold for aggravation doesn't necessarily mean you're in the presence of art. Like becoming aware of a buzzing fluorescent light, or a distant car alarm, the intellectual commitment doesn't stretch far beyond: Where is that coming from? When will it stop? And finally: why won't it stop?","I noticed David Grubbs' The Spectrum Between made its way onto some of last year's Worst and/or Most ...

Love Ways EP,Spoon,by: Nick Mirov,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a51ac0084474cd0c064a/1:1/w_160/e8bc762d.gif,2000-10-24 05:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7427-love-ways-ep/,MergeMerge,"It was once said of Picasso that he could draw a single line and everyone who saw it would know immediately that it was Picasso who drew it. Now, don't think I'm going to be so gauche as to compare Spoon to Picasso directly, but hear me out here: you can hear a simple, forceful drumbeat, a barked syllable, a quick strum of the guitar, or the crackling note of a dying keyboard, and immediately identify it as a sound created by Spoon. That's why they're such a great band-- they have the ability to stamp their indelible signature on the most atomic components of rock 'n' roll. Of course, not everyone shares my pro-Spoon sentiment-- take Elektra Records, the label that half-released A Series of Sneaks in 1998, shortly before unceremoniously dropping the band from their roster. For nearly two years now, the band has floated around without a label, releasing only two singles and a compilation track in that time. But finally, Merge Records came to their senses and hooked the band up with a deal. Thus, we are graced by the presence of Love Ways, an EP recorded after their long-awaited third full-length, Girls Can Tell (which will be released early next year by Merge), but released now as sort of a ""hi, remember us?"" statement. Although one gets the sense that Spoon saved their best material for the full-length, Love Ways showcases the band's evolving sound and songwriting skills quite well. Spoon's best work in the past has hinged upon their apparent deliberateness-- in the skeletal arrangements of the songs, in the placement of decorative sounds, and of course, in the band's playing. In this sense, Love Ways' looser vibe works both for and against it; it's proof that Britt Daniel can write great, catchy songs even when he's casually tossing them off, but it's also not quite as substantial as previous releases. Still, there are at least two classic Spoon tracks to be found here: ""Change My Life,"" a spooky sigh of a song cut through with lightning bolts of guitar clang, and ""Jealousy,"" a deceptively sprightly tune with a Beatles-esque bounce playing off a shimmery organ backdrop. But even when they're not 100% on, Spoon can still polish the most tarnished cliches to a reflective glimmer. ""I Didn't Come Here to Die"" sports a pushy, twangy riff that hiccups just often enough that it doesn't get too repetitive. On ""The Figures of Art,"" Daniel's voice is such that he can sing a cheap line like, ""It's easier to eat a broken stomach than drink on an empty heart,"" and still sound heartfelt. Finally, there's ""Chips and Dip,"" a doo-wop song without the actual doo-wops; the track seems to exist solely so Britt can sing the words, ""Shuck and jive."" Although if someone compiled a list of ""Top 10 Words or Phrases We've Always Wanted to Hear Britt Daniel Sing,"" I guarantee ""shuck and jive"" would be on there somewhere. I've tried to explain the greatness of Spoon to newcomers and nonbelievers, without much success; it's just that they have the indescribable ""it"" that 99% of bands sorely lack. It's the way the molten-glass strands of guitar shatter against Jim Eno's Ironman drumming, the way Daniel sings so lackadaisically from the back of his throat, the genuinely odd sound loops and warm, buzzy layers of organ. Love Ways may not completely deliver on Spoon's ""it,"" but it shows that they haven't lost it, and that's pretty darn alright.","It was once said of Picasso that he could draw a single line and everyone who saw it would know ...

Mini review-within-a-review of that amaZINE split: Fly Pan Am's track is nothing special-- just a pretty, low-key instrumental rock track. But the Godspeed cut rocks the Bauhaus. It begins in typical Godspeed fashion-- an interview with some old crank. But this guy has a fascinating story to tell about the old days of circus sideshows and geeks who were, he claims, alcoholics or drug addicts denied their fix. The problem now, he says, is all the geeks are roaming the streets, instead of in cages where they should be. Perfect. Some cheap strings then burst in (I think this was an earlier, 4-track version of Godspeed) and they build to a grand, tragic climax until the track is overwhelmed by bassed-out electronics. Wow. Now, back to our regularly scheduled review. A 1999 eponymous full-length came next from Fly Pan Am, and now comes this 30-minute, three-track EP. So, now that we have the background out of the way, here comes the part where I tell you what's good and what's bad about Sedatif en Fréquences en Sillons. The good is that these guys can build an appealing and peculiar instrumental groove. The bad is that they spend too much time on other stuff. Let me explain. The opening track is a kind of remix/reworking of some material off their debut. After a few seconds of random noise, Fly Pan Am fall into a driving two-chord vamp that features some beautiful picking by Tellier-Craig. This opening section builds a head of steam, with a good bit of tension added by some threatening noise that weaves in and out. And then, around the four-minute mark, the song disappears completely, and we're treated to what sounds like an extended recording of a piss-drunk Norm Abrams tearing through his shop, trying to find the right tool to amputate his leg. It's nothing particularly interesting, just a bunch of cans rattling about and the occasional saw or power drill. The band eventually breaks free of this wreckage, staggers back into that beautiful opening, and adds to the mix the ethereal, wordless voice of Norsola Johnson, who is seemingly trying out for a part in Steve Reich's Proverb. The second track ""éfférent/afférant"" is essentially a Can tribute, and a fine one at that. More electronics and sound effects weave in and out of the steady rhythm, with the bass in particular evoking the pulse of ""Yoo Doo Right."" Because it's so hypnotic, it's a short ten minutes. And this time, Fly Pan Am make good use of the added dissonant textures. The final track is a shorter, slightly more compelling tape noise collage, but again, there's nothing too striking or affecting about it. That about says it.","Fly Pan Am is the main gig of Godspeed You Black Emperor! guitarist\n\ Roger Tellier-Craig, and their first recording ...

Unsolved,Karate,by: Camilo Arturo Leslie,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bb6ac0084474cd0c2859/1:1/w_160/5cd61ea2.gif,2000-10-24 05:00:00,Jazz,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4385-unsolved/,SouthernSouthern,"On 1997's In Place of Real Insight, Karate made an intelligent, straight-ahead rock album that borrowed the stop-start cadences and tired loud-soft dynamics of D.C. rock, and filtered them through a grad student geek-chic sensibility. And it worked. The resulting music was rough-edged but musicianly, sounding kind of like the Warmers after a half-year of music lessons. Geoff Farina's effete, lilting vocals might have come across as just plain annoying in any other context, but the earnestness of his delivery along with the album's unhurried, lounge-core feel, and the punchy guitar tone Farina coaxes out of his Fender gear worked. Like, synergy, man. 1998's The Bed is in the Ocean took Karate down a new path. The album was like your friend's hairbrained scheme that you agree to go along with, if only because the last one worked out well. And again, it worked. Bed smoothed over the abrasive elements of their previous album, employed more complex chord changes, and garnished it with meandering, jazzy guitar lines. Many of the songs incorporated ""jammy"" interludes that narrowly evaded corniness on the merits of their execution, a feat in and of itself. But it was a balancing act that worked precisely because of the precariousness of the proposition, and not despite it. Which brings us back to the album at hand. Unsolved is a jazz album. Whether or not it's an ""authentic"" jazz album, or just three rock guys playing jazz make-pretend, I couldn't tell you. My knowledge of jazz guitar begins and ends with having read the name Django Reinhardt somewhere, once. But, does it matter? The drummer uses brushes on some songs, distortion is scarce, and the progressions sound damn jazzy. Gone is the sugar that once made the medicine go down. It couldn't even be called jazz in rock clothing. And it doesn't always work. The album's second track, ""The-Lived-But-Yet-Named,"" comes across, both musically and lyrically, as scathing parody. Unfortunately for Karate, it isn't. Consider the following lyric: ""How much will the Leitmotiv sway to compensate for our fallow-yet-vigorous play?"" Can you imagine a context in which that line wouldn't sound completely pompous? Yeah, neither can I. And that's because there isn't one. The fact is, certain language is just ill-suited for song lyrics. The old Geoff Farina sounded like the sort that might steal your girlfriend, then come back later in the day to cart off all your old college textbooks. The worst lyrical moments of this album paint the portrait of a guy emasculated by excessive studying, in dire need of an extension on his dissertation so he can go get some sun and air. On the third track, ""Sever,"" Farina makes a passing and pointless reference to cultural critic Raymond Williams that, instead of enhancing this otherwise good song, adds an unnecessary and unsightly pedantic touch. The same song, however, marks one of the album's rare incursions into rock turf. After the opening jazz-cum-'70s-buttrock riffage and a few jazzy verses, it delves into a prolonged instrumental midsection that pays homage to Black Sabbath. In a good way. ""One Less Blues,"" the album's longest and, perhaps, strongest track, opens with dissonant, gently-picked guitar over an ominous bass-line. At one point, a blues/jazz solo gives way to delay-drenched guitar that eventually circles back to the '70s jam-rock feel of ""Sever."" Karate ties these segments together seamlessly into an evocative whole. Its missteps aside, Unsolved is both good and daring. It shows Geoff and company as the versatile, gifted, and skilled musicians and songwriters they are. Perhaps, the strongest case for it is that Karate goes for broke whereas fans would have been satisfied by The Bed is in the Ocean II. In doing so, Karate made another rewarding and compelling album that forces the listener to hear them on their terms.","On 1997's In Place of Real Insight, Karate made an intelligent, straight-ahead rock album that borrowed the stop-start cadences ...

Fig. 5,Jackie-O Motherfucker,by: Brent S.

This is, after all, the New World; we dedicate these talismans against ruin across the landscape almost as if to keep history itself at bay, to keep time from catching up with us. Underfoot are bones and detritus, though, the debris of the little nameless events that are excluded from American history. It's all a rather shallow grave when you think about it. Jackie-O Motherfucker's unprecedented Fig. 5, the group's first CD release, presents a dim and unsettling archaeology of American music. Released in the wake of the American century, it's the first unapologetically brilliant piece of experimental music I've heard this year. Somehow constructed bereft of any postmodern irony, Fig. 5 transforms a commanding grasp on the celebrated tributaries of American music-- jazz, Appalachian folk, soul, African-American spirituals, West coast surf-rock, Protestant hymns, Louisville post-rock, bluegrass, electronic noise-- into an autochthonous gospel. Jackie-O Motherfucker-- two multi-instrumentalists, Tom Greenwood and Jef Brown and the cadre of eclectic talents with whom they surround themselves-- abandoned the remix loop jazz-fusion of their first two albums (available only as LPs) and literally emerged from the basement and the soil with a masterpiece. The gust-blown digital hum of the first track, ""Analogue Skillet,"" underpins plucked and scraping strings, like a bow on the nervous system itself. It's buzzing neon yielding to something like a screen-door creaking on its rusted hinges behind wind chimes in ""Native Einstein,"" a kind of front porch minimalism. There's a faint chorus of young girls counting down in the recesses, playing Double Dutch in the road. The strings sound like saws; the lone sax whines like an animal. The scene is replaced by the solemn repetition of guitar twang; ""Your Cells are in Motion"" is the working man's Mogwai: a funereal procession of rising guitar and faint vocals coalescing steadily into shantytown post-rock, tarnished but true. Labradford will spend the entirety of their career trying to create this song and never get it right. The choral ""Go Down, Old Hannah,"" performed here by the Amalgamated Everlasting Union Chorus Local #824, is a prison camp work song dating back to the turn of the century-- a plea for sunset to end the workday. ""Amazing Grace,"" the slave trader John Newton's ubiquitous 1779 hymn to God, is barely recognizable as Appalachian free jazz: steely banjos and twittering horns that sound like bagpipes are equal parts mountain folk and Pharoah Sanders. The lilting ""Beautiful September"" provides an interlude of catchy No Depression dream-rock. But the album's centerpiece is clearly the tribal 24-minute ""Michigan Avenue Social Club,"" a track that sounds at times like dismembered Gershwin, and at other times like Cul de Sac with horns. Fig 5. fades out on the brief, chirping ""Madame Curie,"" dissolving into the earth from which the whole work arose. For all its disparate strands, Fig. 5 is surprisingly cohesive, constructing some ratcheted new sound with junk and memory rather than laundering old sounds with the irony and veiled contempt of other pastiche exercises. The disc itself is packaged in an oddly fascinating die-cut cardboard folio, complete with snippets of Alan Lomax's celebrated American ethnomusicology. Fig. 5 is slow and plodding like time itself. This work, again, simply has no precedents. Or rather, its precedents lie in the dusty anonymities of American musical history, instead of the proud and touted monuments of our cultural past.

Electric Waco Chair,Waco Brothers,by: Sam Eccleston,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a9b25e6ef95969321469/1:1/w_160/aa4ee291.gif,2000-10-17 05:00:08,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8552-electric-waco-chair/,BloodshotBloodshot,"The Waco Brothers should be awful. There shouldn't be any way possible on God's green earth that a British art-punk with anarchosyndicalist leanings could put together a band that includes an acknowledged ex-member of KMFDM on pedal steel guitar and make credible-sounding circa-1960 roots country. Worse, this lot of expats do it a lot better than most Americans of the same ilk. Admit it. It rankles a little bit when someone from exotic climes with his or her own cultural legacy waiting to be exploited comes along and exploits ours better than we do. By all rights, Jon Langford's roots project ought to be a collection of rockin' madrigals and ballads about flowers. We've got a brace of alt-country upstarts who can defame our glorious traditions just fine, thanks. Where does this pack of goofy bastards get off thinking they can one-up our national heritage? But they do, damn it. Jon Langford has always utilized his extracurricular time with the Wacos to exorcise the C&W; demons that have lurked in his work with the Mekons since the 1980s. Where great Mekons albums integrate a vaguely folkish, space cowboy vibe, the Waco Brothers sound like real-deal ten-gallon hatters with a grouchy streak and a subscription to The Nation. There are no body-positive-feminist allegories about pirates to be found here. Sure, there's a William Blake nod on occasion, but mostly, Langford and co-singer/songwriter Dean Schlabowske invoke the spirit of the common man, crank up the hollow-body guitars and rock their wary ways. Hoping for artistic growth is completely off the subject when talking about the Waco Brothers. After all, the band's an acknowledged nostalgia act. All the same, despite its bellicose title, Electric Waco Chair finds our boys in a relatively contemplative mood: the songs center generally on getting older; the tempos aren't nearly as frantic as they've been in the past; and the jokes here are at least a little bit subtler. The Wacos still want to be the party band in the honky-tonk at the end of the world, but they've come to realize they need a couple slow jams for couples to dance to. Chair, eager to please as other Waco offerings, includes a brace of crowdpleasers. The air of scabrousness that hovers over most Mekons projects isn't anywhere to be found here, replaced instead with a rummy goodheartedness in short supply among independent-label socialists these days. Langford seems unnecessarily into channeling Billy Bragg at times-- particularly on the egregious ""Walking on Hell's Roof Looking at the Flowers""-- and some of the arrangements are a little shticky, like when the Brothers attempt a Spanish-flavored feel on ""Cornered."" But nit-picking individual moments here is pointless spoil-sportsmanship. It's like going to a great rent party and complaining that the beer sucks. The Waco Brothers aren't about flawless, detailed songcraft. They're about lager-soaked good times with just enough anxiety and doubt to make the trip worth taking. And, in that respect, Electric Waco Chair never disappoints. Though these fellas don't take the country idiom as seriously as your favorite American punk-countryist might, they sure have a great time doing their work. If anything, their irreverence toward country music is what separates the Waco Brothers from the herd. Where American revivalists are frustratingly serious about their music, treating country like holy writ, the Waco Brothers don't have the same stake in it. Because it's not their history, they can treat it as a contemporary event and return it to the go-for-broke fun spirit behind all that worship old-time tunage gets subjected to. Besides, who wants to listen to madrigals all day, anyhow?","The Waco Brothers should be awful. There shouldn't be any way possible on God's green earth that a ...

(Yes, that old thing.) Well, Jega went to architecture school with \xB5-ziq and Aphex Twin, so he'd know more about that than most. Unsurprisingly, Jega sounds not unlike his better-known classmates. Falling squarely into the this-is-techno-but-don't-dance-to-it camp, Dylan Nathan tics and quirks like any addled British gent with too much time, an ugly beard (I presume) and an 808 should. But, distinguishing him from the rest of the ""Look, ma! I'm a genius"" dance music crowd, Nathan clearly took better notes in architecture than the rest of the IDM crowd ever bothered to. Far more than his stateside debut, Spectrum, Jega's Geometry is preoccupied with questions of space. The record opens with a vast humming sound, as if Nathan were demonstrating how big a space he's working in by recording a huge wind rushing through it. Though the first appearance of actual music diminishes that scale down to the humble bleeps and clicks of ""Alternating Bit,"" a caustic little digibyte of electro-inspired troublemaking, every piece here is as carefully thought out as a building might be. Principally, Geometry supplants the fury and blistering speed of the first few Jega offerings with a glassy, almost pretty surface. Where the last record took a page from Squarepusher's relentless, haywire jitteriness, many pieces here sound like Philip Glass with a shorter attention span and no interest in opera. Keyboards slither between, over and under beats; songs move with almost mathematic precision (Geometry, get it?). If the last Jega album, as some pundits remarked, invented drill-n-bass, this is ""chill-n-bass."" This isn't the chamber-music transcendence of Aphex Twin's slower moments; it's a gorgeous absense of feeling. The tracks work like clockwork and with approximately as much emotional commitment. And just because it won't make you cry doesn't mean you won't nod your head. Still, anyone who's looking to techno like this stuff for matters of the heart is missing the point.

In the Valley of Dying Stars,Superdrag,by: Steven Byrd,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a5daea9e61561daa5227/1:1/w_160/71d61eda.gif,2000-10-17 05:00:06,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7622-in-the-valley-of-dying-stars/,Arena RockArena Rock,"In 1996, I was one of twelve people in the continental United States that owned a copy of Superdrag's major label debut, Regretfully Yours. I'd heard the album's first single, ""Sucked Out,"" somewhere and more or less liked what I heard. It was your basic pop song-- nothing to write home about-- but what made it stand out were its slick pop vocals. I mean, the other components of the track might not have set my ass ablaze, but those harmonies and melodies were just too goddamned catchy for me to ignore. So, like any curious music fan might, I went out and bought the album under the assumption that if the band had written one good song, they might have written more. Well, they did, technically. Every track on Regretfully Yours lived up to the standard set by that first single. Unfortunately, none surpassed it. In fact, none of the songs on the album seemed the least bit interested in deviating from that standard in any way, whatsoever. So, instead of having bought one enjoyable, guilty pleasure of a power-pop song, I'd sunk my money into an entire album of them. At first I was okay with it, but as I listened to the album over time, I began to feel cheated. I wanted substance to my music-- some change or risk, not x number of cloned, lazy pop-rock tracks. So Regretfully Yours, which had potential to be a truly entertaining album, ended up being a mildly pleasant, but completely insubstantial piece of disposable modern music, instead-- something you listen to while waiting for the really, really powerful music to come your way. Four years later, the boys in Superdrag-- now minus one major label record deal with Elektra-- hit us with In the Valley of Dying Stars. Besides bearing one of the most comically melodramatic titles of the year, In the Valley has the unfortunate pressure of being Superdrag's ""comeback album."" After strip-mining the already predictable sound of Regretfully Yours and recycling it into their universally ignored sophomore album, Head Trip in Every Key (even I didn't buy that one), Superdrag hit the skids, stopped selling records, and like so many unlucky bastards before them, fell out of the public eye. Now they're back, out to reclaim a place in the spotlight. How do these musical pioneers plan on doing this? Frankly, by releasing the same damn album for a third, and hopefully final, time. I guess someone in Superdrag is going to have to lose an eye before they figure out that this gimmick just doesn't cut it. Two albums' worth of dismal record sales and critical dismissal hasn't yet convinced them that you need more than slick production and greasy, infectious vocal hooks to make good music. Don't get me wrong, this stuff isn't actually that awful. I mean, they could do a hell of a lot worse. A lot of the music on In the Valley (and their other albums and EPs) is catchy, cleverly arranged and generally well put together. The music is respectable rock, and whoever writes their songs deserves a pat on the back for their sugary-sweet harmony work. Still, In the Valley is music that's more likely to make you fall asleep than air guitar. Built around their trademark fuzzy guitars and drums buried so low in the mix they sound almost embarrassed to be there, Superdrag's latest offering comes off as a predictable, less intelligent alternative to Built to Spill's There's Nothing Wrong with Love. Crammed with standard chord progressions and lyrics too vague to have any emotional impact, In the Valley of Dying Stars is nice enough to listen to in small doses, but it's that less intelligent and predictable part of the Superdrag sound that keeps the album from being all-around good. Twelve tracks is apparently not enough breathing room for these guys, as the boys rarely bother to vary from their standard three-minute, three-chord, pop-savvy formula, churning out an album consisting of one texture, one style, and one trick. The real bitch, though, is that In the Valley hints at what these guys might be capable of if they just took some chances. Three tracks stand out on the album: the ridiculously titled ""The Warmth of the Tomb,"" ""Ambulance Driver,"" and ""Unprepared."" These three tracks have one thing in common: they sound different than the rest of the shit on the album. ""Ambulance Driver"" has an obvious country/ southern-rock twang that adds some much-needed soul to the Superdrag catalog; ""The Warmth of the Tomb"" and ""Some Kind of Tragedy"" are both slower, looser numbers than the band's typical hyperactive, economy-sized numbers. On these tracks, the band actually sound like they're enjoying playing the music, and not just trying to get the hell out of the studio before their time expires. There is honest-to-god musical potential here, I swear. Superdrag isn't a total lost cause. In fact, even their mistakes as better than they used to be. This, combined with the genuinely good tracks on the album might mean that, after three records, they're finally hitting their stride. Now, if they'd stop trying to sell the same album time and again, they might actually start selling some of them.","In 1996, I was one of twelve people in the continental United States that owned a copy of Superdrag's ...

Kingdom of Champions,Earlimart,by: John Dark,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bbe013d197565213b1b0/1:1/w_160/2ed17e5b.gif,2000-10-17 05:00:05,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2651-kingdom-of-champions/,Devil in the Woods,"Earlimart's second full-length for Devil in the Woods Records, Kingdom of Champions, grows on you at a rate that would make the Andromeda strain proud. Each time I listened, my tentative rating for it jumped at least a point, to wind up at a respectable, if not outstanding 6.8. Which is fairly impressive for a band that plays some of the most straightforward, guileless music west of the San Andreas Fault. Initially, I vainly sought some higher meaning or nobler purpose in the band's music. But the joke was on me; there's only one level to Kingdom of Champions: a visceral level. So light your smoke, drink your beer, lower your expectations, and enjoy the music. Frontman Aaron Espinoza channels Social Distortion's Mike Ness fairly effectively (sans the poor-man's Rob Halford faux-biker chic image) throughout half the disc. Side-stepping harmonies work surprisingly well in place of sneered ones, and the shouted backup vocal adds... well, shouting. The songs are also very mildly dissonant, but in measured, tried-and-true ways. Aside from the early Social Distortion feel, though, a lot of the ubiquitous post-punk influences pop up blatantly, in that nose-on-your-face kind of way: Hüsker Dü, Wire, Buzzcocks, the Fall and the Pixies. About the only thing you couldn't see coming is the bass intro terrifyingly similar to Circle Jerks' ""15 Minutes"" that makes an appearance on ""Eileen."" Dismiss that as coincidence, I suppose. Kingdom of Champions' highlight comes at the halfway mark in a triumvirate of blessed, fortunate songs. The droning ""Dead on the Dancefloor,"" which feels like a more agreeable ""Levitate Me,"" declares ""Backwards she bent/ And now she's dead/ She got what she asked for/ She's dead on the dancefloor/ She cut a rug."" While far from revelatory, the lyrics affect through a seditious whispered delivery. The balladry of the title track follows with a casual and effortless grace that drifts from your consciousness almost before you realized it was there, like a wisp of hickory campfire smoke. ""A.M. Countdown"" recalls something borne out of the same Southern Gothic sensibility that sustained bands like Pylon and the young REM for so many years. Also in strong contention is the penultimate ""I Can't Take This,"" which nods ever so slightly to their more rootsy debut, Filthy Doorways, with rollicking verses set against its angrier, malevolent chorus. Oddly, Earlimart chose to end Kingdom of Champions anti-climactically, with a recorded drunk rant that clocks in at nearly 5\xBD wasted minutes. It seems little more than an in-joke committed to plastic, and baffles with every listen. I mean, far be it from me, whose bands have never made it to the point of walking through the doors of a recording studio, to cast stones at others. Still, my mama told me not to waste food because other people in the world are starving. And this track stands out as one of the few poor decisions here. Even weaker songs like ""Cabin Fever"" and ""Tuxedos"" don't bomb as much as lurk in boring anonymity. On this record, Earlimart abandons the country-folk leanings of their debut full-length in favor of executing some fairly accomplished, pop-informed post-punk. But they're not the second coming of your favorite defunct band, as their influences might suggest. (Would you really want that, anyway?) Rather, Kingdom of Champions has the feel of a local band made good. Every mid-sized, Midwestern, middle-income college town has a dozen bands just like Earlimart. You buy their records, go to their shows, and hang out with the members. And you root them on, hoping they manage to make the jump into the minor leagues where they can begin to get the recognition they deserve. And if nothing else, Earlimart is one band that's worth rooting for.","Earlimart's second full-length for Devil in the Woods Records, Kingdom\n\ of Champions, grows on you at a rate ...

Our Aim is to Satisfy Red Snapper,Red Snapper,by: Mark Richardson,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a234ea9e61561daa49a9/1:1/w_160/aa2cea1f.gif,2000-10-17 05:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6723-our-aim-is-to-satisfy-red-snapper/,MatadorWarpMatadorWarp,"Upon listening to Our Aim is to Satisfy Red Snapper, I went back to Making Bones, the group's last release, to make sure I hadn't underestimated it. Like everybody, I occasionally dismiss a record and find out later that I kind of like it. I remembered that I didn't think much about Making Bones when I reviewed it way back in 1998, and Our Aim is to Satisfy sounded good right out of the blocks. A quick listen to Making Bones eased my mind: it's not terrible, but it sounds pretty average. This year's model is anything but. The songwriting is sharper, the sounds are more varied, and there is barely any British-accented rapping (an extreme and possibly xenophobic personal bias). Oddly, the thing that keeps this band from greatness is their insistence on a live rhythm section. I never could have imagined myself saying such a thing five or six years ago. Back then, I always wanted drums to sound live, even if I knew they were sampled. I liked a certain amount of electro and '80s pop, but the sound of drum machines in general turned me off, especially when there was no ""song"" working as a counter. But having ingested so much digitally-based music over the last couple of years, I've come to appreciate the expressive power of the computer. Red Snapper's drum sound and the stand-up acoustic bass are very similar on most of their tracks (also the problem with my once-beloved Soul Coughing), and it now strikes me as a limitation. Still, there's much on Our Aim is to Satisfy to love. The first track, ""Keeping Pigs Together,"" sets the tone. An instrumental (my favorite kind of Red Snapper track), the song borrows its chords from U2's lovely ""October,"" adding a churning beat beneath to drive home the plaintive melody. Soon, the disc rolls into ""Some Kind of Kink,"" wherein Red Snapper bring the funk with two basslines at work: one owes a lot to the O'Jays' ""For the Love of Money""; the other works its scholarship for the Roni Size Brown Paper Bag School of Slippery Acoustic Drum-n-Bass. Tack on a pounding snare, a spooky synth refrain, and some pinched, stanky vocals right out the 1970s and you got yourself a killer track. Similarly impressive is ""The Rake,"" with an odd Donald Duck style vocorder and the kind of spare, low-key rapping I can deal with. And several of the new trip-hop-meets-soul cuts, which were unbearable on Making Bones, end up working rather well. ""Shellback"" contrasts slow, heavy beats with the angelic voice of Karime Kendra. Sure, she hasn't got anything to say, but she says it rather beautifully. A few of the tracks in the latter half of the record fail to register at all, but enough standouts remain to recommend Our Aim is to Satisfy to the curious.","Upon listening to Our Aim is to Satisfy Red Snapper, I went back to Making Bones, the group's last ...

Train of Thought,Reflection Eternal,by: Sam Eccleston,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5eda6c55fd5cd0dd6940662d/1:1/w_160/Talib-Kweli.jpg,2000-10-17 05:00:03,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4548-reflection-eternal/,Rawkus,"A theory as to why the snotty misfit kids-- the ones the once-glorious indie empire would have, not so many years ago, claimed as staunch subjects-- are now defecting for the surprising country of underground hip-hop: it's the directness, stupid. Have you noticed them missing? Sure, you have. The kids sneaking into grown-up rock shows are getting putzier and putzier, and the bands are getting older and older. Where once one could expect the rare, youthful outburst to transform itself into redemptive wonder, indie rock coolness is largely derived these days by relative oldsters. Meanwhile, underground hip-hop websites, fanzines and record stores are showing up left and right. How come They of Beats and Rhymes are getting the enthusiasm They of Cardigans and Uncertain Rhythms once enjoyed? For a fairly detailed answer, look no further than Reflection Eternal, the new LP by Black Star stalwart Talib Kweli and DJ wunderkind Hi-Tek. The album's a good example of what's right with hip-hop lately and wrong with a lot of rock and roll. Like his sometime groupmate Mos Def's Black on Both Sides (though with a substantive drop in articulation and a proportional increase in kneejerk argumentation), Talib Kweli's new joint is wry, reflective, principled and questing. Despite his occasional propensity for self-righteousness (""[I'm a] best-selling author writing great chapters in history""), Kweli is generally expressive and concerned, rather than hectoring and moralizing. Because it lunges forth from NYC-based undergroundism, Kweli and Tek aren't particularly concerned with funkiness. Instead, Hi-Tek's beats thud and thwack steadily, possessing flow instead of heft, and reliability in lieu of inventiveness. Kweli uses the rhythm as a foundation, building rambling, baroque rhyme structures on top of them, exhibiting his cock-eyed ""skills."" This kind of braggadocio doesn't weaken the effort in the same way his moralizing self-canonization does, if only because he can often back those claims up. Unlike a lot of present and future 12"" soldiers, Kweli is full of things he wants to say. When he thanks his parents for not divorcing until their kids were older, it's a rending, astonishing moment; his praise for African-American women is a crowning moment for rap empathy. It's one of the few occasions where hip-hop has deigned strive for tenderness over all else. Which brings me to the music's current ascendancy among the weird-teen set: Reflection Eternal includes, among its other virtues, an open description of its self-perceived place in the world. Where independent rock music has abandoned its own position as an aesthetically driven, non-dogmatic community of performer/audience equals for interesting, but ultimately non-communicative abstraction, hip-hop continues to build from the essential impetus for lasting, powerful art: ""Hi, how are you? My name's...""","A theory as to why the snotty misfit kids-- the ones the once-glorious indie empire would have, not so many ...

The Coroner's Gambit,The Mountain Goats,by: Sam Eccleston,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c3d6eb335119a49ed7e5/1:1/w_160/9ea475e3.gif,2000-10-17 05:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5453-the-coroners-gambit/,Absolutely Kosher,"The Mountain Goats have long been considered a boutiquer's taste: a little something for a highly specialized portion of the population, but hardly a crowd-pleaser in any sense of the word. After all, Mountain Goats albums sound like most band's demos, superficially speaking-- the lion's share of the project's corpus is John Darnielle singing and strumming an acoustic guitar into a boombox. One can't claim stylistic innovation for the group, exactly, because whatever innovation has occurred over the course of their many records has been purely internal. The introduction of a violin, an electric guitar, a Casio keyboard or, hell, a studio is an occasional treat for a listener, but the Goats are hardly going to be called reinventors of rock music or synthesizers of a bold new style. The question presented by any record of this ilk is, of course, do we need more of this stuff? With formally adventurous rock music pushed progressively to the fringes of culture, do we need more records on which people further explore territory that's already been mapped to perfection? But, then, does innovation really matter in the end? What Darnielle and his merry band are doing, with more acuity and aplomb than virtually anyone in that great fog of ""independent music,"" is preserving a specific kind of craft and clear-headed thinking that, in these days of Grooveboxes and 20-minute remixes, is going the way of the dinosaur. These kinds of portentous statements might irk someone with a casual awareness of the Goats' oeuvre, partially because Darnielle stubbornly refuses to hand over the goods on a casual listening. A lot of the band's songs sound, at first, like a frantically battered acoustic guitar accompanied by vocals which don't come near anyone's definition of sonorous or pretty, however passionate their delivery. Craft and aplomb don't seem to enter the equation. That ain't Darnielle's fault, though. The years of lo-fi supremacy have forever paired home recording and acoustic musicianship with the most unctuous kinds of sincerity and confessionalism. Consequently, Darnielle's writing, loaded with narrative trapdoors and non-explicit references to other works, is grouped in with every piece of my-girl-done-wrong twaddle any college student with a Tascam might decide to dress up with a drum machine and a made-up record label. But to view the Mountain Goats as a contemporary Cat Stevens project with a higher tolerance for speaker damage is to miss the pleasure. On The Coroner's Gambit, our fearless guide shows off some of his sharpest writing yet. There are both cutting lines (""I'm just grateful my children aren't here to see this/ If you'd ever seen fit to give me children"") and masterful set pieces (the rending ""Elijah"") which exhibit Darnielle's storytelling ability. But those descriptions imply that The Coroner's Gambit is pleasant singer/songwriter craft-- all spare arrangements and lilting whimsy. On the contrary: ""spare"" is hardly the word for this stuff. These songs are filled to bursting with feeling, with words, with characters, with purpose. It often seems like there's nothing going on at all on a Mountain Goats track. But careful listening to rhythmic flourishes, throwaway choruses, and the inflections of single words reveals that there's more happening here than anyone could possibly ask for. Put the emphasis on ""story,"" of course. Though Darnielle's readings sound anguished and intimate enough at times to suggest that this is a bad-breakup record without parallel, he never suggests that these are real-life nuggets of wisdom. Instead, The Coroner's Gambit is a deeply heartfelt record about, among other things, the impermanence of life and relationships that draws from actual feeling but recontextualizes those feelings in carefully wrought ballads and story songs. Even better, the musical accompaniment on Gambit is Darnielle's best yet. Where records like Nine Black Poppies got along on guitar bashing and enthusiasm, the new offering uses an almost astonishingly subtle approach. ""Island Garden Song"" floats over a surprisingly intricate guitar filigree, and the violin that weaves in and out of ""Onions"" is cleverly integrated enough to put to rest any Goats-directed accusations of primitivism. Of course, any rabidly enthusiastic review for a record of this nature-- one that executes its given project carefully and movingly, and shows little interest in smashing boundaries-- begs a question: why do we need more of this? Why do we need more well-executed folk-pop songs about the travails of the heart? For those of us out here in the weird-rock hinterlands, sandwiched as we are between cloying, cute obviousness and foggy abstraction, the answer to that question is simple: we need this more now than ever.","The Mountain Goats have long been considered a boutiquer's taste: a little something for a highly specialized portion of ...

This is Cinerama,Cinerama,by: Sam Eccleston,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a5d3b1335d7bf1698cbc/1:1/w_160/a95ca724.gif,2000-10-17 05:00:01,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1472-this-is-cinerama/,spinARTspinART,"It's perfectly reasonable to want to dismiss new projects led by David Gedge. Hell, at this point, he seems damn near anachronistic, reeking of floppy canvas sneakers and backwards baseball caps and songs about girls and inoffensively distorted guitars. Gedge fronted the long-also-running UK group the Wedding Present for 12 years, patenting a strummy, light-angst sound that was frustratingly difficult to take seriously, despite the craft and quality concealed in their best work. The Wedding Present legendarily shoved early Pavement buzz into high gear with their b-side cover of ""Box Elder,"" and no less an authority than Steve Albini deemed them ""nice enough to date your sister."" Couple that with a brace of songs that define the mid-'90s non-twee pop aesthetic, and the race is over: in a quiet, continually underplayed, terminally unhip way, the Wedding Present stand as possibly the most important U.K. indie-pop act of the decade. Though Madchester bands and shoegazers often pick up the most dap for such achievements, the Wedding Present delivered more quality for a longer period than your favorite Limeytalk-spouting heroes could dream of. The Wedding Present have apparently folded, having maintained a resolute four-year silence, and Gedge has recouped with Cinerama. The band still features Gedge's endearingly froggy vocals jousting with their self-consciously ""cute""-voiced foil, keyboardist Sally Murrell. The songs still revolve around banal/timeless troubles of the heart, though the driving forces are still so defiantly pro-craft, pro-pop and anti-experimentation that it makes one wonder where Gedge does his record shopping. It's as if the man's never heard hip-hop, jungle, free jazz or any of the other rock-band additives du jour. Gedge has, however, definitely heard of Portishead. Either that, or he's a closet '60s-exotica soundtrack fan. Cinerama spike the dorkcore stylings of their frontman with heavy doses of tinkly cocktail Moog, smatterings of wah-wah guitar, and chilly Serge Gainsbourg arrangements. Once again, starting a trip hop-inflected pop band in A.D. 1998 is hardly cutting edge, but hipster cred has never been Gedge's principle motivation. Though the band's long-players, Va Va Voom and the near-fabulous Disco Volante, have been quite cool, any longtime Gedgeophile can tell you the real story of the man's work is in the singles. This is Cinerama studiously compiles the first slew of less-than-12"" action by the group, and keeps the winning streak going. ""Kerry Kerry"" kicks things off with a slab of affable, acoustic pop, but the song's b-side, ""Love,"" really gets things going. Over a bed of the funkiest guitar a SpinArt recording artist's ever mustered, and a fugue of keyboard lines, Gedge sings of the titular subject while the Delgados' Emma Pollock circles him with gorgeous, sweeping harmonies. ""Manhattan"" clocks in at a relatively epic five minutes, and it's a crowning example of Cinerama's more atmospheric approach. There's barely any guitar on the track, the melody sounds played on a synthetic harpsichord, and sampled horns build to the chorus. Where most groups who traffic in such aesthetic oddities are content to congratulate themselves for figuring out ProTools, Gedge's rock-solid pop instincts smoothly integrate such atmosphere into yet another love-gone-wrong standard. The insertion is so seamless, it becomes hard to remember there's anything remotely odd going on at all. So, no, Gedge's new atmospheric palette hasn't taken him far from his favorite, untimely concerns. He hasn't suddenly embraced Marxism, Hegelian dialectics or post-structuralism. He's still talking about love and sorrow, growing old when you still feel like a child. None of these social problems are as au courant as the WTO or the death of language, but they'll never be irrelevant, either. Somebody's got to keep a handle on this stuff, and who does it better than this?","It's perfectly reasonable to want to dismiss new projects led by David Gedge. Hell, at this point, he seems ...

Unreasonable Behaviour,Laurent Garnier,by: Matt LeMay,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bef15e6ef9596932331d/1:1/w_160/7fd29baf.gif,2000-10-17 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3400-unreasonable-behaviour/,MuteMute,"I folded back the five year-old's scribbling on crack cover art, and removed the small silver disc contained therein. Suddenly, staring up at me from beneath the clear plastic tray of Laurent Garnier's Unreasonable Behaviour were the following words: ""J'espére que tu t'es lavé les mains avant de me toucher!!!"" Or, as those of you who endured four years of high school French have already translated, ""I hope that you washed your hands before touching me!!!"" ""My God,"" I gasped as I read the words over and over. ""It can't be-- a clean Frenchman!"" (Tactful, yes?) Sadly, Garnier's request didn't quite mesh with my usual ritual of soaking my hands in rancid donkey piss before reviewing an album. (I figure, if athletes are allowed their fucked up good-luck charms, who's to say critics shouldn't be allowed the same idiosyncrasies?) I hadn't yet listened to the album, and I wasn't sure if it was worth the effort of heeding its warning. But here at Pitchfork, we believe in giving any album, regardless of nationality, the benefit of the doubt. Popping the disc in, I couldn't help but harbor a secret hope that Garnier would single-handedly manage to cast away the obnoxious kitsch that is too often associated with French dance music. It wouldn't be easy, though-- within a few seconds of Unreasonable Behaviour's opener, it was pretty clear that Garnier was working well within the range of Mute Records' burbling synth and drum machine electronica. Indeed, the album has all the tenets of this particular variety of electronic music: relatively simple, slightly lounge-tinged chord structures, spastic synth melodies, and stereotypical drum machine beats. What makes Unreasonable Behaviour of note is the fact that, at his best, Garnier understands the single greatest asset of the type of music he's working with: it sounds really cool. Unreasonable Behaviour excels through simple flourishes-- the thundering bass synth in ""The Warning,"" the blaring trumpet in ""The Man with the Red Face,"" and the flanged snare drum of ""Forgotten Thoughts."" Melodically, though, there's nothing new here. Typical techno fare. Though this record is, at times, immensely cool-sounding, Garnier seems to have difficulty overcoming the quirk. An open note to all techno musicians: Vocoders are not cool. ""Hey! It's a voice, but it sounds like a computer! Neat!"" No, not neat. On Unreasonable Behaviour's mercifully short title track, Garnier couples a thoroughly annoying vocoder with an equally annoying speech about techno. One minute and twenty seconds of sheer annoyance. And just as irritating, but longer, is the extended foray into heavy-handed manipulated vocals on ""Greed (Part 1+2)."" Unreasonable Behavior is a very well-executed album at times, but it certainly doesn't live up to its name. Garnier is quick to point out that the CD and vinyl versions of this album contain different tracks and mixes: ""Unreasonable behaviour? You said it!"" No, Laurent, I didn't say it. But aside from putting words in your mouth, Garnier seems hell-bent on putting words on his albums. Bad, bad words. Minus the kitsch, this album would get a pristine thumb pointed upwards. But it's going to take a lot more than Garnier's brand of uneven techno to get me to wash these hands.","I folded back the five year-old's scribbling on crack cover art, and removed\n\ the small silver disc contained ...

If I Could Only Fly,Merle Haggard,by: Ryan Kearney,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c03dea9e61561daa7bac/1:1/w_160/6e4dc26f.gif,2000-10-10 05:00:01,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3704-if-i-could-only-fly/,EpitaphAnti-EpitaphAnti-,"After languishing on Curb Records during the '90s, releasing albums that no one paid attention to (including, it sometimes seemed, himself), Merle Haggard signed with the Epitaph subsidiary Anti-. This move afforded the prolific veteran an opportunity to do exactly what made him a legend in the first place: compose excellent, commercially-unconcerned country music. But there's a discernible difference: Merle Haggard has grown into his surname, and it suits him well. ""Watching while some old friends do a line/ Holding back the want to in my own addicted mind"" is the lyric that opens If I Could Only Fly, an album strong enough to remind one of Haggard's work in the '60s and '70s. Accompanied by an acoustic guitar, snare brushes, occasional electric pickings and a barely audible organ, Haggard continues, ""Wishing it was still the thing even I could do/ Wishing all these old things were new."" Its subtle power is enough to make my 23 year-old body somehow feel old and tired. As strong as the opening track is, a whole album of it would leave me a shriveled heap of flesh and bone. Haggard, of course, realizes this. So he quickly jumps into the Hank Williams-inspired ""Honky Tonky Mama,"" which he delivers in an odd, but engaging, swallowed voice. After the laid back slide guitar of ""Turn to Me,"" the album hits another high point with its title track. Largely just an acoustic guitar, a harmonica and his smooth baritone, Haggard sings, ""I feel so good and then I feel so bad/ I wonder what I ought to do."" Written here, it reads like the sad, simplistic reflections of an old man. Yet, everything about the song is so beautifully understated as to make one understand, if not sympathize. But, again, Haggard moves through various subgenres with impressive ease. ""Crazy Moon"" sounds as if it were written from the shores of Hawaii; ""Bareback"" is Bob Wills-style country swing; ""Proud to Be Your Old Man"" is a blues-inflected ragtime number. And through Haggard's consistently subtle approach, the songs flow together with no disruption. Despite these worthy numbers, the best moments here are when, as on ""Wishin' All These Old Things Were New,"" and ""If I Could Only Fly,"" Haggard sticks closely to his acoustic guitar and alludes to his past. ""I'm Still Your Daddy,"" for instance, opens with the nearly spoken lines, ""I knew someday you'd find out about San Quentin."" An unsettling harmonica rides through before he resumes: ""It's time you knew the truth about your papa/ I've not always been the man I am today."" With compelling, confessional honesty, he goes on to address his criminal past, his former youthful naiveté, and to admit his wrongfulness. The stripped-down ""Uncle John"" begins with a reference to the death of his father. Then, he informs us how his career began: ""Looking back, it all looks like a marathon/ And it started with an E chord I learned from Uncle John."" The final number, ""Listening to the Wind,"" is just what you might expect: the description of a man at the latter end of his life, alternately listening to everything around him, and to the concerns in his own mind. The obvious comparison is to Bob Dylan. Both men, thankfully, still have a message, albeit of a nature quite different from their earlier years. Although Dylan's Time Out of Mind is certainly a greater triumph, If I Could Only Fly shows that perhaps Haggard has more to say, given the upheaval of his youth. In either case, that Dylan and Haggard are still making music is a blessing to the rest of us. Perhaps, in listening to their reflections on aging and the accompanying doubts, we can learn how to face our own mortality with greater equanimity and fewer regrets.","After languishing on Curb Records during the '90s, releasing albums that no\n\ one paid attention to (including, it sometimes ...

Nixon,Lambchop,by: Kristin Sage Rockermann,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc8713d197565213b348/1:1/w_160/47206701.gif,2000-10-10 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4657-nixon/,Merge,"Lambchop's Nixon is the result of a collaboration between Lambchop members John Delworth, Deanna Vargona, Paul Niehaus, Allen Lowrey, Jonathan Marx, C. Scott Chase, Marc Trovillion, Kurt Wagner, Paul Burch Jr., Mark Nevers, Dennis Cronin, Alex McManus, and Matt Swanson, with non-Lambchop members Tony Crow, Ken Coomer, Matt Bach, Paul Booker, the Nashville String Machine, and a choir. The list is so long I considered throwing my name in there to see if anyone noticed, but I don't really want to slip casually into ""the Lambchops"" (as I like to call them). Here's why: First off, I'd have to be really quiet. Even if my only involvement in the band was irresponsibly tossing my name into a list of band members, I'd probably be typing too loudly to be let into the club. Lambchop don't rock at all. Sometimes they embody the lilting tempo and achy narratives of a slow, Southern night. Other times, they explore the soul-inspired fantasies of an obedient student at orchestra practice. They do, however, occasionally approximate swelling mushy-movie music, with the help of the Nashville String Machine. Secondly, I'm sure I'm not cool enough to be on the inside of this joke. My family and I listened to Nixon on the car ride to my brother's graduation. My grandmother liked it, but it was ""too smooth"" for my parents to get through. Much like Bacharach, an influence in Wagner's writing on ""You Masculine You,"" Lambchop's smooth n' easy orchestral pop-meets-country-meets-soul sound sits best with grandmothers who like the style of the music but can't make out the lyrics, and with hipsters who ""get it."" Lambchop is a fusion of styles that both transgresses formal genre boundaries and creates an unsettling disjuncture by pairing in-the-know lyrics with the more conservative sounds and production styles of Nashville. That being said, Nixon serves as a reminder that expertly executed stylistic hybrids and ironic juxtapositions-- great though they may be-- don't replace memorable songwriting. Sure, it's a novel concept, but while some of us may still be patient enough to ""get it"" five albums into the band's career, Wagner's talent and unique vision should demand a more challenging album. For a project involving so many musicians, there's something stifled and almost claustrophobic about this album's overall sound. It's not unlike spending several hours with your family in a small box that moves at a consistent pace over farmland and rolling hills. Images of families and endless days are cataloged as the countryside maps itself through a car window, cleansed of the intellectual stimulation or emotional strain of staying in one of the many passing homes. Both the ironic distance built into their indie-intellgensia-meets-Appalachian lyrics, as well as the almost scientific blending of styles, feels like detached pastiche. You're listening through a car window. Did I mention that one of your family members sometimes sings in an annoying ""soulful"" falsetto after listening to one too many Earth, Wind and Fire records? In the plainest terms possible, Nixon is a record for grandmothers and hipsters. It's also turned out to be a record for yuppies who ask, ""Who was that pleasant group that opened for Yo La Tengo?"" when in pursuit of the perfect album to soundtrack their wine-and-cheese parties. Several of my friends who heard Nixon said, ""This isn't bad."" But it isn't bad in the most damning way. The songs are decent, it's carefully arranged and well produced, and it's even innovative in ways. But while it's hard to imagine hating Lambchop, it's also hard to believe they could be anyone's favorite band. On Come On Pilgrim, Black Francis sings, ""I wanna be a singer like Lou Reed."" While Kurt Wagner's voice at times recalls Lou Reed, no one will ever pen, ""I said I wanna a be a singer like Kurt Wagner/ 'I like Kurt Wagner,' she said sticking her tongue in my ear."" That's because Wagner's songwriting is smart, well-crafted and creates its own stylistic niche garnering critical acclaim, but simply fails to inspire or leave a permanent mark the way Lou Reed or Frank Black have. I'm perusing Nixon's liner notes in a failed attempt to find something smart to write regarding the ""Suggested Reading"" list of books on Richard Nixon, but the album's already fallen out of rotation. You got it-- my grandmother and I are listening to the Pixies.","Lambchop's Nixon is the result of a collaboration between Lambchop members John Delworth, Deanna Vargona, Paul Niehaus, Allen Lowrey ...

American Don,Don Caballero,by: Matt LeMay,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b9f1ea9e61561daa70ef/1:1/w_160/23612a87.gif,2000-10-03 05:00:07,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2414-american-don/,Touch and GoTouch and Go,"Several years ago, Michael Jackson told reporters that he incessantly grabs his crotch because he is a ""slave to the rhythm."" While this statement went largely unnoticed-- probably due to the fact that Jackson's public image at the time was more closely related to his choice of ""friends""-- those four little words came to me at the perfect time. As I was rapidly becoming more obsessed with music, my physical reactions to music were amplified as well, and before long, anything with even a twinge of rhythm had me dancing around like a caffeinated flea. Needless to say, this didn't do much for my social life-- I became something of a circus freak, ""that weird guy with headphones."" To make matters worse, I had yet to come up with an acceptable wise-ass response to the question, ""What the fuck is your problem?"" Thankfully, the King of Pop came through for me. Yes, ""I am a slave to the rhythm"" certainly did its job, eliciting knowing chuckles from those well-versed in pop culture, and quizzical stares from everyone else. I thought I had the whole thing worked out. Until Don Caballero entered my life. Despite the relative spaz factor of my movements, there had always been a pretty constant rhythm behind the music I listened to, assuring that no matter how goofy and awkward I looked, there was always at least a discernable rhythm to my soulless twitching. But when Don Caballero's What Burns Never Returns found its way into my collection last year, any shred of dignity that might have remained quickly disintegrated. Layer upon layer of paroxysmal rock guitar, coupled with Damon Che's insanely inventive drumming, left my nervous system in tatters and my body seizing in suitably bizarre patterns. Suddenly, being a slave to the rhythm just wasn't enough. I had become a slave to Don Caballero. And what a blissful servitude it was. The band combined the driving, distorted guitars of heavy metal with the intricate arrangements and percussive elements of post-rock. It was a match made in heaven, and I was more than happy to forego my social standing to experience the immeasurable thrill of this band. Even when I learned of the imminent release of American Don, I was still hooked on What Burns Never Returns, as well as Don Cab's earlier records. Though For Respect and II are considered by most to be their masterworks, I found the more fractured and complex rhythms of What Burns Never Returns more appealing. Thus, I hoped that American Don would take the band's signature formula one step farther, rocking harder and tossing in even more curveballs. But while American Don does show the band attempting to take several steps forward, they too often wind up tripping over their own feet. The most noticeable difference between American Don and previous Don Cab records is the relative lack of distortion. While previous efforts balanced gritty, abrasive chords with intricately plucked clean guitar parts, American Don places the emphasis almost entirely on the latter. As a result, the album lacks the driving rhythmic and melodic force of their previous outings. Another disappointment is the lack of surprise on American Don. Talking about individual tracks seems futile since they all seem to follow a very similar formula: clean, layered guitars, thumping bass, and thankfully, Damon Che's always-refreshing drumming. Still, time changes come far less frequently and are much less fluid than on past albums. And adding to the less exciting nature of American Don is the saddening fact that the more adventurous studio techniques hinted at on What Burns Never Returns still haven't been fully fleshed out. But even with all its weaknesses, American Don still has the one distinct advantage of being a Don Caballero record. Of the countless bands trying their hands at instrumental post-rock, Don Cab may be the best at giving the rock equal billing with the ""post. So even if it isn't suited for moonwalking, crotch-grabbing, or settling out of court for an undisclosed fee, American Don does little to change Don Caballero's status as the greatest band in the world for intense, convulsive head-nodding and the like.","Several years ago, Michael Jackson told reporters that he incessantly grabs his crotch because he is a ""slave to the ...

DJ Kicks,Nightmares on Wax,by: Paul Cooper,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a12db1335d7bf16981c4/1:1/w_160/12bdaa6e.jpg,2000-10-03 05:00:06,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5793-dj-kicks/,!K7!K7,"George Evelyn, lone survivor of Nightmares on Wax, curates the latest in Studio !K7's uptown DJ Kicks mix series. And following the path of greatest predictability, Evelyn sequences music you'd imagine he'd compile. This should not have been the case for several reasons. A Word of Science, Nightmares on Wax's debut as a trio, reveled in a warped aesthetic that peaked with the hallucinatory ""Aftermath,"" a track so twisted and evilly looped that Second Summer of Love casualties are known to wander throughout Greater London muttering the thought-crimping vocal refrain. With Evelyn abandoned by his crew, he turned his musical attention from funk-avant-garde, to just honest-as-the-Earth hip-hop. No more messin', Evelyn wanted to slam some real street shit on us. And well qualified he seemed to do this. ""Night's Interlude"" had become one of the Ur-texts for James Lavelle's Mo'wax roster, eliminating the necessity for anyone to get up and strut their bad selves. Nope. Just bob yer 'ead, mate and that'll show your appreciation. But the signifiers got more than a little muddled. Unlike Sotheby's auctioneers trained to notice and respond to the merest suggestion of a flick of a bidder's wrist, one couldn't distinguish between a too-cool-for-this-shit Mo'wax devotee or the involuntary head-lolling of some zee-onked bong-boy. The unhappy result of this indistinguishability was the sloppy deluge of trip-hop, amid which subsequent Nightmares on Wax albums Smoker's Delight (prosecution rests!) and Carboot Soul barely floated. With the opportunity to assemble a mix disc for Studio !K7, I'd hope that Thomas would put down the pipe and give us something noteworthy. I'd like to imagine that a mix disc from a respected label such as Studio !K7 would seek to be part of the great tape-compilation tradition. Obsessive pause-button compilers across the world, sweaty-palmed with the excitement of introducing friends, family and the mail-room guys to music outside of their usual zone, challenge themselves to juxtapose pleasant oddities. An Otis Redding soulwrencher against a Sandy Denny lament, perhaps, for a natural and expected collision. I remember the compilation tape my hippie friend Mike made for me that introduced me to the Third Bardo, the Third Ear Band, and Love. If I ever lost that tape, I'd be devastated. So, commercially available compilation CDs should ideally be replaceable irreplaceables. Studio !K7 have provided us with at least one such disc. Nicolette's installment swerved effortlessly and logically between Shut Up and Dance urban hardcore and deep ambient to IDM stalwarts Plaid. The never-disappointing Nuphonic label has become the motherlode of such desirable compilations. Not only have they released the two David Mancuso Loft sets, but also Norman and Joey Jay's Notting-Hill-Carnival-in-your-living-room Good Times. It irks me to report that you'll have just okay times with Nightmares on Wax's compilation. It's not that any of the tracks are cornball or turgid. The artists and the labels represented have all licensed high quality drops of wax. From ""Ay, Ay, Stutter,"" Saukrates' unintentional tribute to UK comedy rappers Morris Minor and the Majors, to the nu-oldskool breaks of Grand Unified's ""Shake Up""; from the Stax horn section-adoring ""Ease Jimi"" by Nightmares on Wax to the jazz-disco of Syrup's ""Chocolate,"" Evelyn plays one good record after another. Though he thankfully didn't attempt to turntable some cross-fader action, or to perform the crab-walk, the scoozy, the backspin-shuffle, or even a salvo of triplicate zickity-zags, Evelyn could have done something a bit special than wait until one record was fading out before pressing the start button on another. This just lends a blandness to a disc that could have been an ear-opening, run-down, dumpster-strewn alleyway of musical unexpectations. Free of anything out-of-the-ordinary, the Nightmares on Wax's contribution to the DJ Kicks series will find favor with those who love their music barely audible, and with those who cherish their music collections more as qualifications for admittance into the scenester clique. Or, of course, with those who spend time prospecting for a missing eighth (last seen underneath a sofa cushion... or was it in the freezer cabinet?) than considering the quality of the contents of their disc-changer.","George Evelyn, lone survivor of Nightmares on Wax, curates the latest in Studio !K7's uptown DJ Kicks mix series ...

Down in Fall EP,The Minders,by: D.

Or perhaps E6 has distanced themselves from the Minders: no logos on the package, no Robert Schneider production. So, perhaps thankfully, out go my extended comparisons of prominent Elephant 6'ers to their counterparts in '60s pop music. On Cul de Sacs, Martyn Leaper repeatedly demonstrated his sharp instincts for pop songwriting and tight, efficient arrangements. Each song did exactly what it needed to do in two or three minutes. Somehow, though, this five-song EP fails to gel or show any consistency, despite its brevity. It shows the band making a few tentative steps outside the limitations of their sound, but losing some of their appeal in the process. The group takes over full production chores here, and the tape hiss still present on their last album has since departed. The first track, ""Young and With It"" bears the largest similarity to their previous outings, with its economical guitar work, brisk drums, and chiming keyboards. Sure, it's pleasing, but far from remarkable, and it definitely wouldn't have stood out on their last LP. The next track, ""On and On,"" is better, driven by a pulsating bassline; harmonizing flutes, and dueling harpsichords enter the mix as the song progresses. The problem with Down in Fall as whole becomes apparent with the following song, ""Time Machines,"" an ominous piano-driven track accompanied by an old time-management seminar tape. It's interesting, but only serves to derail the continuity. A track like this could work in the context of an LP, but here, it's merely distracting. Based on the music, Down in Fall certainly counts as a minor entry into their discography, but, rather frustratingly, it's the CD-ROM footage in the enhanced portion that raises the rating a few notches and keeps my interest in the band's future work piqued. Leaper shows off his expanding array of home recording gear, and the patient can listen to him endlessly hem and haw over the pros and cons of home recording. But the footage of the band doing a take on the new songs ""Golden Street"" and ""Light in the Morning"" instantly outshine the tracks on the audio portion. The hooks are here in full force, and the band is far more successful in venturing beyond its peppy pop background. During the interview portion, Martyn Leaper states, ""All of this has already paid for itself,"" indicating his first reel-to-reel machine in the corner. So perhaps this is just a way of generating the funds to finish their next album. If so, I suggest you make a contribution through purchasing their earlier records.","The Minders seem to have divorced themselves somewhat from the Elephant 6 collective since last year's singles compilation, Cul ...

EP,Red Stars Theory,by: Ryan Kearney,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a13d5e6ef9596932013b/1:1/w_160/9511c142.jpg,2000-10-03 05:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6727-ep/,Touch and GoTouch and Go,"The cover of Red Stars Theory's first album, 1997's But Sleep Came Slowly, is largely comprised of a black-and-white photograph of a room with a wood stove, a modest lamp and a bed with a wrinkled blanket draped over it. The cover of their sophomore release, Life in a Bubble Can Be Beautiful is even more sparse. It's a photograph of a cloth, perhaps cotton or wool, with ""Red Stars Theory"" stitched in white along the border of the two competing colors of the cloth: brown and dark red. So what the hell is with the bright-blue-and-pink lamb, knotted scarf and all, hopping on the mint-green cover of their new EP? Album covers can serve many purposes, of course, but artists usually create covers that they feel are visual encapsulations of their album's theme. Those artists who aren't striving for thematic unity-- which is often because they haven't got any-- simply want cover art that fits their sound and image. Covers, therefore, also act as signifiers, which often double as warnings-- that, for instance, their sound and ideology have changed. But this is just an EP, so what does one make of its odd, surprising cover? Well, don't worry. This five-piece outfit-- which features 764-HERO bassist James Bertram and Modest Mouse drummer Jeremiah Green-- haven't gone Elephant Six or anything. The first track of this four-song, 30-minute EP, ""And Often Off Again,"" is the original version of ""An Alarm Goes Off,"" the closing track from Life in a Bubble that was ""constructed"" for that album by Sientific American. Not surprisingly, this version is shorter (although still over six minutes long) and more rock-oriented. The guitar frolics comfortably in the foyer while the edgy violin and swirling atmospherics remain in other rooms on other floors. Although the subtle digital manipulations are missed, the song builds a palpable and rewarding momentum absent from its sliced-up offspring. The following track, ""Our Nearest Neighbors,"" was recorded during the Life in a Bubble sessions, but left off the album. God knows why. Had it been included, it would have made for one of that record's strongest numbers-- which speaks volumes when considering that Life in a Bubble was easily the most underrated post-rock record of 1999. After two minutes of a guitar walking in circles and classical arrangements of cello and violin encouraging, Bertram sings, ""We're almost home/ A few more blocks."" It's all so comfortable until he continues, ""When we get back/ There's gonna be a lot of fighting and curse words."" And at this point, the song's torso is ripped open, guitar strings stretching and snapping like weak tendons. The track best exhibits Red Stars Theory's unique strengths: to harness the emotion of emocore without indulging in the maudlin lyrics; and to exercise the artistic grandeur and complexity of post-rock, but without the cold detachment and pretension. The EP's third track is a remix by Sientific American of Life in a Bubble's ""Parts Per Million."" Eerie, atonal whirs (à la Boards of Canada) open the number, soon accompanied by pockets of static and a crisp guitar. This song's original version only becomes recognizable when, two minutes in, the familiar stringed notes rise out of the murky digital cutting board. The violin and cello are soon distorted and eventually suffocated by guitar interjections, hollow drums and exponential bleeps that inevitably define the song as an electronic, but organic, auditory trip. The final number, ""Boring Ghosts,"" is another remix by Sientific American from a song off the previous album. That song, unfortunately, was Life in a Bubble's only truly weak point (let's just say it was aptly-titled). While this remix is similarly aimless, a wavering hum and other indecipherable sounds lend the song more depth. So, instead of a short, boring song, we're offered an eight-minute, Eno-esque ambient jaunt that's perfect to listen to while, say, sitting against the stone wall of the main terminal at Grand Central at 6:00pm on a Friday. So how, then, does the record's cover make sense? The fuzzy, carefree lamb reflects the somnolence of Red Stars Theory's dreamlike movements through space, as exemplified by the first two tracks. But, while soft and inviting, the colors are nonetheless off: lambs aren't pink and blue. The comforting image of the lamb has been visually manipulated, but remains equally comforting, albeit in a more surreal way. The same could be said for the remixes that make up the latter half of this EP: the pleasant music has been cut-and-pasted, but it hasn't lost its pleasantness. Or maybe they just thought it would be funny to put a lamb on the cover.","The cover of Red Stars Theory's first album, 1997's But Sleep Came Slowly,\n\ is largely comprised of ...

Structured ostensibly as a tribute to the group's ""European roots,"" Blonde Redhead could be forgiven for trumping the ""global village"" exotica card. The concept is not sound enough, however, nor is it executed as smoothly as one might have hoped. The EP consists of five songs, the first two of which are versions of songs off their Melody of Certain Damaged Lemons album (""In Particular"" and ""Hated Because of Great Qualities"") sung in French and Italian. These opening tracks form the crux of Melodie Citronique's misgiving. They're nothing special; the songs themselves are, note for note, exactly like their previous versions, suggesting that Kazu Makino, who sings on both, simply dubbed foreign language vocals over the backing tracks. While that's an underwhelming prospect to say the least, the awkward vocalizations add no new dimensions to the songs. The questionable premise is undercut by the fact that the Japanese Kazu has no ""European roots"" to speak of, and a certain laziness is apparent in neglecting to translate the chorus of ""In Particular,"" which remains exactly as it was on the album. The one new original track, ""Chi E E Non E,"" is an entirely different matter. The first song written by the group in Italian, it's a delicate acoustic track sung beautifully by guitarist Amedeo Pace that brings to mind the more subdued moments of Os Mutantes. Why the song is tucked away and not given prominence in the EP's tracklisting is a mystery. Following it is a well-executed Serge Gainsbourg cover, ""Slogan,"" sung in French by Kazu. Melodie Citronique closes with ""Four Damaged Lemons,"" a remix of Melody's ""For the Damaged"" by Third Eye Foundation's Matt Elliot. The remixing apparently had to do mostly with texture and atmosphere, as Elliot opts not to tinker with the actual song, preferring instead to drape a translucent sparseness upon an otherwise unchanged track. Pleasant enough, it's not the dramatic reworking necessary to round off this lukewarm collection. Simply put, the first two tracks are completely dispensable, the remaining three only lightly.","This release is a bit problematic.

So Much for the Ten Year Plan: A Retrospective 1990-2000,Therapy?,by: D.

From that point on, the dream is just a blur of abstract terror, and I'm still overwhelmed by thoughts of how that thing might have survived, and what horrible form it might have taken on. The experience of listening to Therapy?'s career retrospective is not unlike that dream. It feels like the return of my perfect teenhood, which was spent as a long-haired, greasy, flannel-and-torn-jeans-wearing (though admittedly dorky) rocker. My musical consciousness had begun with Nirvana, the Smashing Pumpkins, and their grungy ilk, and hard rock was my bread and butter. As the years passed, though, I found myself distanced from anything that could have been classed as ""metal,"" due to the increasing backward-cap-and-wifebeater aesthetic which didn't mesh with my delicate sensibilities. Plus, it sucked trying to convince people that Paranoid was a work of art far more sophisticated than it's generally given credit for. To be honest, Therapy? missed me the first time around. And I probably wouldn't have given these guys much credence if I'd heard them then, as I generally liked my metal bands at least as arty as Soundgarden. These guys haven't got a trace of art in them. What they do have is at least as much rock and roll spirit as the MC5. And an endless supply of undeniably catchy riffs and hooks, all delivered with the same ham-fisted bludgeoning delivery. The tracks are remarkably consistent, if arranged seemingly at random. But that hardly matters; the band's oldest tracks are at least as good as the two obligatory new ones. ""Bad Karma Follows You Around,"" one of the latter, is such a spirited number it's hard not get swept up in the sheer ""rock power"" of it all. On the other hand, So Much for the Ten Year Plan is an embarrassing reminder of the worst cliches of pre-Bizkit '90s hard rock, give or take an Alice in Chains record. Like Nirvana, Therapy? were equally influenced by the Ramones and Black Sabbath, so those elements coincide easily within their songs. There's no evidence of ""growth"" or ""progression"" over the course of their careers, aside from the inevitable quieter tracks that came in recent years. But even these are as tuneful and as their loud/fast counterparts, with the exception of an ill-advised cover of Hüsker Dü's ""Diane,"" where the band attempts the tired ""string arrangement = maturity"" equation with roughly the same success as a Poison power ballad. Lyrically, these guys are all brooding and intense, and they've got the goatees to prove it. The teen angst is here in spades; they speak to the rock geek within with lines like ""Your beauty makes me feel alone"" in ""Screamager."" Who can't identify with that, man? And who wouldn't cringe when it's followed by ""Screw that/ Forget about that/ I don't want to think about anything like that?"" They do lighten it up on ""Potato Junkie"" with the anthemic line ""James Joyce is fucking my sister,"" putting themselves right in line with their native Ireland's rich literary heritage. I can't stop myself from feeling that this music is somehow ""bad,"" and I have a palpable sense of guilt as I listen to it. Still, there's an undeniable appeal. Therapy? seem almost unabashedly retro and geeky compared to the current spate of rap-metal bands currently flashing across the MTV eye. What's most difficult to quantify, though, is that it's completely enjoyable, while simultaneously impossible to take seriously. File 'em under ""guilty pleasure.""

For the first time in my life I experienced actual ennui. Can you believe that? Just like characters in 19th century novels! Not just dull, run-of-the-mill boredom, or impatient, fidgety disinterest, but enn-fuckin'-ui! Yeah! Watering Ghost Garden finds this San Francisco quartet serving up a low-sodium, reduced-calorie six-song helping of Blah. Considering the effusive praise and lofty predictions lavished upon 1998's I Become Small and Go, you might be inclined to hope this EP is some sort of red herring. You know, to, uh, throw the sophomore slump off their scent, and ensure smooth going to their forthcoming Dreamworks full-length. Or, perhaps this is just the lackluster batch it appears to be on first listen. But things get off to a good start. ""Centipede Eyes"" is lush, not unpleasantly overproduced pop. Remember Shudder to Think's more conventional sounding songs from the First Love, Last Rites soundtrack? Well, take out half the quality and pour it on the ground as a libation to the god of unmet expectations. You're left with a perfectly good half-bottle of Creeper Lagoon. Drink up. ""Roman Hearts"" is more of the same. Unfortunately, maudlin piano lines and synthesized string arrangement pretty much torpedo the song's passably pretty melody. Also, something about Ian Sefchick's vocal inflections here hints strongly at the onset of delusions of Radiohead. Prognosis: grim. The verse to ""Big Money Struggle,"" a track produced by former Talking Head Jerry Harrison, is great. And if that looked like a barbed compliment to you, you get a cookie. Or a free copy of the new Creeper Lagoon EP. The verse is to the overall song what the face is to the girl about whom people say, ""Well, she has a pretty face."" The chorus, accordingly, is the big, ungainly ass and hunched, pimply back that makes a pretty verse more a badge of shame than a redeeming element. Or perhaps they meant for it to sound like an NBC sitcom theme song resulting from a Wallflowers Crap Music Summit. ""Chain Smoker"" sports an electronic drum kit, more misplaced sounding piano tinkling, and best of all, sitar. ""My Friends Adore You,"" meanwhile, is gorgeous. The Creepers keep things simple, adding decorative flourishes like a chorus of falsetto voices, and subliminal keyboard parts, where appropriate. But, inexplicably, around the fourth minute-- like that fuck-up friend everybody has who can't handle good fortune-- they throw in a ""heavy rock"" section with a jarring 3/4-to-4/4 tempo change, and a turgid, stinking guitar solo. Then, Watering Ghost Garden draws to a close with ""God Will Understand,"" a track that seems like more of a moody outro than a proper song. Owing to its brevity, there's not enough time for the guys to actually ruin it, and consequently, it's the EP's most successful minute. You know the rap on these guys. Spin readers' designated ""Best New Artist of 1998,"" lauded by the New York Times, featured on a big time movie soundtrack (well, okay not quite-- Dead Man on Campus). Though Watering Ghost Garden is an awkward, ankle-busting step off the curb for these four, Creeper Lagoon may just redeem themselves with their next album. In the meantime, this EP proves again that, apart from promoting music sales and exposure, Napster is invaluable as a guide for what not to throw your cash at.","After sitting through Creeper Lagoon's new EP for about the fourth time, something truly remarkable happened to me-- epiphanic ...

Xen Cuts,Various Artists,by: Mark Richardson,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a7bdc0084474cd0c0c74/1:1/w_160/b91a70b5.gif,2000-10-03 05:00:00,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1947-xen-cuts/,Ninja TuneNinja Tune,"Some time around 1987, I bought a 7xCD box set called Atlantic Rhythm & Blues 1947-1974. I think this was the first time I realized that certain record labels were identified with a specific ""sound."" The hugely influential R&B; singles cut during those years by people like Joe Turner, Otis Redding, Joe Tex, Wilson Pickett, Aretha Franklin and Ray Charles are rightly identified with their performers, but the music definitely shared a sensibility. After all, these tracks were recorded in a small handful of studios, with many of the same producers, session musicians and songwriters. So, though it was nowhere near as mechanized as Motown later became, Atlantic R&B; had an aesthetic, and this meant that the heavenly box set was a unified listening experience, with each disc flowing like melted butter. The fantastic Ninja Tune retrospective Xen Cuts, celebrating the label's 10-year anniversary, has a similar cohesiveness. Though the several dozen artists on these three discs come from at least four continents and work in different genres, there's always some thread that's still vaguely ""Ninja Tune."" It must have something to do with the kinds of records that turn label founders Jonathan More and Matt Black on. We can guess that they appreciate '60s exotica and Blue Note jazz, and they especially dig the hip-hop of the late '80s-- the time when they made their first recorded impact by remixing Eric B and Rakim's ""Paid in Full."" Consciously or not, they've kept their ears open for artists with a similar quality, even though the roster they've accumulated is as rich with variety as it is with talent. Fine DJs that they are, Coldcut know how to select and sequence tracks, further upping this collection's listenability factor. Each disc here seems to have a loose theme. The first showcases the hip-hop side of Ninja Tune, with a good chunk of the 18 tracks featuring Native-Tongue influenced MCs. Highlights include Lyrics Born and Lateef of Bay Area rap duo Latyrx turning in their best rap ever over a groove by the Herbaliser on ""8pt Agenda."" Kid Koala offers ""Emperors Main Course,"" his beautiful, funny and previously hard-to-find reworking of Ryuichi Sakamoto and David Byrne's theme from The Last Emperor. And Luke Vibert's funky ""I Hear the Drummer"" is a slice of drum programming perfection. Hard as it is to believe, there really isn't really a weak cut here. The second disc gives a nice overview of Ninja Tune's various other personalities, from the rare groove-inspired funk of Clifford Gilberto to the sampling virtuosity of Amon Tobin to the exotic trip-hop of Funky Porcini. It's mostly a downtempo affair, never straying too close to the kinetic drum-n-bass some of the artists here dabble in. Though they're all keepers, special props go to the percussive jazz grooves built by Neptune on ""Soul Pride,"" and Up, Bustle & Out on ""Los Locos Cubanos."" The final disc contains rare and unreleased tracks, and it's a testament to this collection that, while it's a tad more schizophrenic than the other two discs, it's nearly as strong. John McEntire's mix of Coldcut's ""More Beats & Pieces"" bubbles with rhythmic ideas. Kid Koala's live ""Drunk Trumpet"" (recorded at Chicago's Metro) is a useful indicator of the depth of Eric San's talent, as he improvises turntable jazz that's actually melodic without the benefit of the studio. Fourtet finds the dark heart at the center of the Cinematic Orchestra's drifting ""Channel 1 Suite,"" further distinguishing him as a major remix talent (check out his EP with Pole). And DJ Food's ""Peace Pt. 1"" is an all-out bongo-heavy party jam. As a label retrospective, Xen Cuts does indeed have something of the Buddha nature; instead of thinking back as we listen, we are blissfully immersed in The Now.","Some time around 1987, I bought a 7xCD box set called Atlantic Rhythm & Blues 1947-1974.

Kid A,Radiohead,by: Brent DiCrescenzo,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a1ebb1335d7bf1698393/1:1/w_160/dddaf5bb.jpg,2000-10-02 06:01:40,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6656-kid-a/,Capitol,"I had never even seen a shooting star before. 25 years of rotations, passes through comets' paths, and travel, and to my memory I had never witnessed burning debris scratch across the night sky. Radiohead were hunched over their instruments. Thom Yorke slowly beat on a grand piano, singing, eyes closed, into his microphone like he was trying to kiss around a big nose. Colin Greenwood tapped patiently on a double bass, waiting for his cue. White pearls of arena light swam over their faces. A lazy disco light spilled artificial constellations inside the aluminum cove of the makeshift stage. The metal skeleton of the stage ate one end of Florence's Piazza Santa Croce, on the steps of the Santa Croce Cathedral. Michelangelo's bones and cobblestone laid beneath. I stared entranced, soaking in Radiohead's new material, chiseling each sound into the best functioning parts of my brain which would be the only sound system for the material for months. The butterscotch lamps along the walls of the tight city square bled upward into the cobalt sky, which seemed as strikingly artificial and perfect as a wizard's cap. The staccato piano chords ascended repeatedly. ""Black eyed angels swam at me,"" Yorke sang like his dying words. ""There was nothing to fear, nothing to hide."" The trained critical part of me marked the similarity to Coltrane's ""Ole."" The human part of me wept in awe. The Italians surrounding me held their breath in communion (save for the drunken few shouting ""Criep!""). Suddenly, a rise of whistles and orgasmic cries swept unfittingly through the crowd. The song, ""Egyptian Song,"" was certainly momentous, but wasn't the response more apt for, well, ""Creep?"" I looked up. I thought it was fireworks. A teardrop of fire shot from space and disappeared behind the church where the syrupy River Arno crawled. Radiohead had the heavens on their side. For further testament, Chip Chanko and I both suffered auto-debilitating accidents in the same week, in different parts of the country, while blasting ""Airbag"" in our respective Japanese imports. For months, I feared playing the song about car crashes in my car, just as I'd feared passing 18- wheelers after nearly being crushed by one in 1990. With good reason, I suspect Radiohead to possess incomprehensible powers. The evidence is only compounded with Kid A-- the rubber match in the band's legacy-- an album which completely obliterates how albums, and Radiohead themselves, will be considered. Even the heralded OK Computer has been nudged down one spot in Valhalla. Kid A makes rock and roll childish. Considerations on its merits as ""rock"" (i.e. its radio fodder potential, its guitar riffs, and its hooks) are pointless. Comparing this to other albums is like comparing an aquarium to blue construction paper. And not because it's jazz or fusion or ambient or electronic. Classifications don't come to mind once deep inside this expansive, hypnotic world. Ransom, the philologist hero of C.S. Lewis' Out of the Silent Planet who is kidnapped and taken to another planet, initially finds his scholarship useless in his new surroundings, and just tries to survive the beautiful new world. This is an emotional, psychological experience. Kid A sounds like a clouded brain trying to recall an alien abduction. It's the sound of a band, and its leader, losing faith in themselves, destroying themselves, and subsequently rebuilding a perfect entity. In other words, Radiohead hated being Radiohead, but ended up with the most ideal, natural Radiohead record yet. ""Everything in Its Right Place"" opens like Close Encounters spaceships communicating with pipe organs. As your ears decide whether the tones are coming or going, Thom Yorke's Cuisinarted voice struggles for its tongue. ""Everything,"" Yorke belts in uplifting sighs. The first-person mantra of ""There are two colors in my head"" is repeated until the line between Yorke's mind and the listener's mind is erased. Skittering toy boxes open the album's title song, which, like the track ""Idioteque,"" shows a heavy Warp Records influence. The vocoder lullaby lulls you deceivingly before the riotous ""National Anthem."" Mean, fuzzy bass shapes the spine as unnerving theremin choirs limn. Brash brass bursts from above like Terry Gilliam's animated foot. The horns swarm as Yorke screams, begs, ""Turn it off!"" It's the album's shrill peak, but just one of the incessant goosebumps raisers. After the rockets exhaust, Radiohead float in their lone orbit. ""How to Disappear Completely"" boils down ""Let Down"" and ""Karma Police"" to their spectral essence. The string-laden ballad comes closest to bridging Yorke's lyrical sentiment to the instrumental effect. ""I float down the Liffey/ I'm not here/ This isn't happening,"" he sings in his trademark falsetto. The strings melt and weep as the album shifts into its underwater mode. ""Treefingers,"" an ambient soundscape similar in sound and intent to Side B of Bowie and Eno's Low, calms after the record's emotionally strenuous first half. The primal, brooding guitar attack of ""Optimistic"" stomps like mating Tyrannosaurs. The lyrics seemingly taunt, ""Try the best you can/ Try the best you can,"" before revealing the more resigned sentiment, ""The best you can is good enough."" For an album reportedly ""lacking"" in traditional Radiohead moments, this is the best summation of their former strengths. The track erodes into a light jam before morphing into ""In Limbo."" ""I'm lost at sea,"" Yorke cries over clean, uneasy arpeggios. The ending flares with tractor beams as Yorke is vacuumed into nothingness. The aforementioned ""Idioteque"" clicks and thuds like Aphex Twin and Bjork's Homogenic, revealing brilliant new frontiers for the ""band."" For all the noise to this point, it's uncertain entirely who or what has created the music. There are rarely traditional arrangements in the ambiguous origin. This is part of the unique thrill of experiencing Kid A. Pulsing organs and a stuttering snare delicately propel ""Morning Bell."" Yorke's breath can be heard frosting over the rainy, gray jam. Words accumulate and stick in his mouth like eye crust. ""Walking walking walking walking,"" he mumbles while Jonny Greenwood squirts whale-chant feedback from his guitar. The closing ""Motion Picture Soundtrack"" brings to mind The White Album, as it somehow combines the sentiment of Lennon's LP1 closer-- the ode to his dead mother, ""Julia""-- with Ringo and Paul's maudlin, yet sincere LP2 finale, ""Goodnight."" Pump organ and harp flutter as Yorke condones with affection, ""I think you're crazy."" To further emphasize your feeling at that moment and the album's overall theme, Yorke bows out with ""I will see you in the next life."" If you're not already there with him. The experience and emotions tied to listening to Kid A are like witnessing the stillborn birth of a child while simultaneously having the opportunity to see her play in the afterlife on Imax. It's an album of sparking paradox. It's cacophonous yet tranquil, experimental yet familiar, foreign yet womb-like, spacious yet visceral, textured yet vaporous, awakening yet dreamlike, infinite yet 48 minutes. It will cleanse your brain of those little crustaceans of worries and inferior albums clinging inside the fold of your gray matter. The harrowing sounds hit from unseen angles and emanate with inhuman genesis. When the headphones peel off, and it occurs that six men (Nigel Godrich included) created this, it's clear that Radiohead must be the greatest band alive, if not the best since you know who. Breathing people made this record! And you can't wait to dive back in and try to prove that wrong over and over.","I had never even seen a shooting star before. 25 years of rotations, passes through comets' paths, and travel, and ...

American III: Solitary Man,Johnny Cash,by: Ryan Kearney,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a53ec0084474cd0c0693/1:1/w_160/c334d581.gif,2000-09-30 05:00:05,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1332-american-iii-solitary-man/,American,"We're constantly bombarded by noise. Especially for those of us who live in city, there's no escaping it; the noise of dense humanity has become a part of our lives. We accept and ignore it just to survive. But sometimes the noise becomes so overwhelming that the brain can no longer shut it out. That's when we do one of two things: lose ourselves, or lose our geography. Earlier in the day on which I wrote this, I woke up to a busy hammer just ten inches from my head, flooding through the porous plaster wall. I swore at someone whose face I'd never seen. Then, the alarm clock joined in, providing a grating beat that lasted all day, accompanied at times by the horn blasts of sedate cabdrivers, the parade of victors and their drunk fans, and the deafening screech of the old red 6 train. The noise got so loud as to erase my memory of it having never existed. Isn't it amazing, then, that I arrive home only to subject myself to more noise: music that to virgin ears would sound like a drowning robot or a greenhouse explosion? Yes, and understandable, too: the heightened stimulus threshold must be met. But just as silence makes clearer the urban noise I live through, so too does listening to Johnny Cash expose my mostly stentorian music collection. Like 1994's American Recordings and 1996's Unchained, American III was produced by Rick Rubin and includes covers of well-known and lesser-known songs. On the opening number, for instance, Cash boils down Tom Petty's ""I Won't Back Down"" to its essence, employing just two guitars and a barely audible organ. The only important instrument here, though, is Cash's voice. As deep and heavy as a mudslide, it raises the dead, the lonely, and the heartbroken. What makes this not just a covers album is that, as Cash explains in the record's liner notes, he makes the songs feel like his own. Sure, Petty wrote it, but its hard to deny that, ""You can stand me up at the gates of hell/ But I won't back down,"" is a quintessential Cash sentiment. They're not his words, but they are. Call it a vocal strongarm. And he does this again and again, from Neil Diamond's ""Solitary Man"" to Egbert Williams' ""Nobody"", from David Allen Coe's ""Would You Lay With Me (In a Field of Stone)"" to U2's ""One"". But American III's high point is its two-song centerpiece. The first is Will Oldham's ""I See a Darkness"", on which it becomes clear that, perhaps because of his neurological disorder, Cash's voice isn't as sure and strong as it once was. When he quavers, with Oldham singing backup, ""Is there hope that somehow you can save me from this darkness?"" the effect is absolutely devastating. You won't listen to the song the same after this. The shivers will eventually leave your spine, but the residue remains. That song's transcendent power also stems from its production, which, although still sparse, is relatively lush. The organ and piano that rise to match the guitar remain in use for Nick Cave's ""The Mercy Seat"". Chronicling the first-person thoughts of a man being executed, this song, more than any other on the album, was written for Cash. Building to a rumbling crescendo, he belts out, ""And the mercy seat is smokin'/ And I think my head is meltin'."" This would've brought even Gary Gilmore to tears. The second half of the album features mostly original compositions. Sparse like the early tracks, ""Field of Diamonds"", ""Before My Time"", ""Country Trash"", and ""I'm Leavin' Now"" prove that Cash hasn't lost his songwriting step, and they show why he can temporarily lay claim to other artist's songs. While some critics take issue with Rubin's underproduction, none of the songs on American III require ornate instrumentation. Whether they've been fluffed up or stripped raw, at the core of each is a compelling statement from one of our greatest humanists. I keep telling people that I'm going to leave the city and move westward to the country or the mountains. I've done it before, and did so with enough success that I didn't concurrently sentimentalize the journey in an effort to reduce cognitive dissonance. It may be in two months or twelve, but sooner or later, I'll hit my breaking point, when I either lose the noise or it loses me. The survival instinct requires that I move. Guess who's going to be guide?","We're constantly bombarded by noise. Especially for those of us who live in city, there's no escaping it ...

Fragments of Freedom,Morcheeba,by: Al Shipley,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c3b8eb335119a49ed799/1:1/w_160/bdff28ea.gif,2000-09-30 05:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5424-fragments-of-freedom/,Sire,"When I hear a record like this, it's of import to me whether a live drummer is playing or if it's simply a drum machine. Usually, there are enough telltale signs that such a factor can be picked up by ear, and if not, consulting the liner notes provides the necessary information. But in the case of Morcheeba's Fragments of Freedom, I find it difficult to tell the difference, let alone care. Either way, it's clearly been sanitized by an omnipresent click-track to serve the simple, shuffling beats and lush, labored production. Apparently, Morcheeba have grown tired of their trip-hop also-ran status and now search for a new pigeonhole to fit squarely into. This is just as well since they've never really nailed the subgenre's active ingredient of paranoia. Fragments of Freedom finds the nondescript trio of two pale producers and a chick singer bravely staking their claim on record shelves already packed with slick, passionless contemporary funk-- right between Macy Gray and Lenny Kravitz. Aside from the old-school Morcheeba sound of the opener, ""World Looking In"", and a couple of low-key instrumentals that scream ""didn't feel like writing lyrics that day"", Fragments of Freedom is a consistent and predictable stylistic overhaul into hyphenated hipster-pop for people who actually liked Cibo Matto's last album. It fits the form to a T, right down to the brief, pointless Biz Markie cameo. The tracks here sport such similar singalong choruses and easy midtempo beats that I'd be extremely hard-pressed to guess which one's the single, much less select a personal highlight. And backup singers now crowd Skye Edwards' once subtle and distinctive vocals, obscuring the outfit's only exceptional charm. There's nothing the least bit distasteful or offensive here, and maybe that's the problem. One can appreciate the skill and craft that Morcheeba exhibit, but when you lean in to get a glimpse at the slightest bit of personality or creativity, there's simply nothing to speak of. It'd be an excusable shortcoming had so many artists not already proven that intelligent dance music isn't necessarily an oxymoron. If Morcheeba manage to land an actual club hit with this record-- which is plausible if given the proper promotion-- I say more power to 'em. I'd probably prefer their tunes on pop radio to the bulk of what's out there now. But as a personal listening product, the contents of this record are no less flat, smooth, or mass-produced than its jewel case.","When I hear a record like this, it's of import to me whether a live drummer is playing or ...

Get on Jolly EP,Bonnie “Prince” BillyMarquis de Tren,by: Ryan Kearney,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a2a69d034d5c69bf2c4d/1:1/w_160/43bf2c45.gif,2000-09-30 05:00:03,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/700-get-on-jolly-ep/,Palace,"Keeping up with Will Oldham is like selling condoms in a nunnery: you can try all you want, but you'll end up broke. Having already released three EPs and a singles collection this year, not to mention a few guest appearances, Oldham probably said to himself, ""What's one more?"" But there's a significant difference between Get on Jolly and his other recent outings: this is his first under the moniker Bonnie ""Prince"" Billy since last year's devastating masterpiece, I See a Darkness. Anyone who's heard that record can understand why I passed on his other 2000 releases, but simply had to buy this one. Your suspicions about the EPs title are probably correct. Joined by the Marquis de Tren-- aka Mick Turner-- Oldham has created yet another slow, somber, minor-key mood piece. The opener, ""2/15,"" begins with an ambling bass reminiscent of Turner's full-time band, Dirty Three. The cautious pickings of an electric guitar move in along with an organ, but that's all-- not just for the song, but pretty much for the whole record. Oldham sings, of course, and on ""2/15,"" he sings about singing. I can't help but wonder if he's talking to his fans when he says, ""I know you take pleasure in my singing."" But I also can't help but find meaning in the final line, ""My life can only break out in songs that have no purpose."" Not that this 21-minute, six-song EP is purposeless; it just lacks any apparent direction or palpable momentum. Still, since this is, after all, Will Oldham, Get on Jolly is a worthwhile listen. Although it sounds as if he's singing in a tiled bathroom, Oldham's delicate, shaky voice is as distinct and touching as ever. On ""25,"" he slowly admits, ""All other desires that distract me day and night are empty to the core,"" with Turner's background vocals providing stability. And on ""81,"" he manages to sing, ""Hidden in the heart of things/ You make flowers into edible things,"" with a minimum of awkwardness. Following on the heels of this glacial spoken-word track, ""64"" is the record's most engaging number, if only because it contains consistent guitar chords and cymbal splashes. The closer, ""66,"" also features cymbals, but they're more haphazardly employed. And Get on Jolly ends just as it began: quietly and discretely. Can you sense my struggle to describe this album? If you've read this far, then you've read three more paragraphs than necessary. But since you're still here, you might as well see me through a final summation: if you need some Oldham music to listen to during that 20-minute period of time between arriving to work and actually working, Get on Jolly serves the purpose nicely. Of course, if you're really in the mood to listen to him, chances are, you have time for one of his better full-lengths.",,7.0,
Himawari,Swayzak,by: Paul Cooper,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a5f59d034d5c69bf340a/1:1/w_160/ab2977cf.jpg,2000-09-30 05:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7648-himawari/,Medicine,"Details, rather than innovation, matter to dub-house duo Swayzak. James Taylor and David Brown have long garnered 'nuff respec' from tech-house trainspotters, but not for introducing the world to the analog ""cuzzah-cuzzah chzam"" sound or updating the Belgian Hoover preset. No, Swayzak, rather like Orbital, have striven to express their deeply chunky selves within strict limits by sticking to their unique sound palettes. Swayzak's debut album, Snowboarding in Argentina, abounded in polished tubes of dubbed delights and attracted envious attention from Plastikman Richie Hawtin's M_Nus label. M_nus' Dale Lawrence, under his Theorem guise, then initiated a sample-trading dialog which has resulted in some swoonsome, small-room techno 12-inches. So Swayzak know how to wow their peers, but what about us, the discerning public? Himawari is, to be fair, a valiant attempt to grab some mass appeal. But I'm afraid that if they're hoping to grab some Madonna remix action, this album isn't going to persuade the execs at Maverick. While the tracks here are recognizably Swayzak's own, the duo have, in places, diluted their chrome-plated, Chain Reaction sound so that those who haven't had the unquestionable pleasure of shagging to Snowboarding in Argentina can catch up with their grooves. And therein lies the problem. The impressive thing about Swayzak's debut album was the manifest care and attention they funneled into every painstaking detail. That they hadn't propelled the genre to new heights didn't matter-- they perfectly adapted what others had left behind in their rush for the next farthest horizon. Himawari, however, suffers from sometimes straying from this admittedly restrictive focus. After dub-poet Benjamin Zephaniah has exhorted us to slightly criminal acts on ""Illegal"" (the most Jah-inspired track on Himawari), Kirsty Hawkshaw, likely out of work since her days with Opus III, lends her thin vocal talents to ""State of Grace"". Before listening to this disc, I was intrigued at the prospect of a Swayzak vocal track. How would Taylor and Brown subtly graft a voice onto their alloyed techno? ""State of Grace"" could have been a rare moment of true experimentation for them. But they chickened out and made the song into a passable Visage pastiche, complete with a verse sung-spoken in some dissolute European language. ""The Frozen Loch"" is Swayzak's bid for some Groove Armada chill, but a Scottish lad's poem set to drifting beats isn't going to get too many Salinas beach babes dancing horizontally. Swayzak have apparently recognized the critical success of Circulation and Peace Division, and contribute ""Caught in This Affair"" to the house/techno interface. Driven by a melting rhythm track and topped off with the title's vocal sample, the band has a low-key chance of being used as cross-fader fodder. The track sounds awkward, and the careful confidence that made me pay close attention to Snowboarding in Argentina and their Blufarm 12"" is noticeably absent here. But for every fumbled attempt at crossover, Himawari provides a true thrill. ""Mysterons"" is entirely unencumbered by its blatantly techno title and scoops up contention for the jackiest, rim-shot marathon of acid techno I've had the delight to hear this year. ""Pineapple Spongecake"" (I guess we should be grateful that they didn't have Ho-Ho's lying around on the mixing board that afternoon) harkens back to the Snowboarding in Argentina sessions and preserves the band's techno-purist appeal. ""Betek"", Himawari's final and finest track, reprises Zephaniah's words from the opener. It stands as a true floor-buckling classic, relentlessly building like Underworld's DJ staple ""Born Slippy"". Swayzak, so much more than many other techno acts, deserve huge success. Taylor and Brown are conscientious and hard-working-- qualities rare in these bandwagoneering churn-'em-out times-- and all of these tracks have a manifest beauty to them. Yet, I find it hard to recommend the present release unreservedly because of the apparent compromises they've made to their previously exemplary sound.","Details, rather than innovation, matter to dub-house duo Swayzak.

The Hour of Bewilderbeast,Badly Drawn Boy,by: Brent DiCrescenzo,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a1f713d1975652138761/1:1/w_160/8d0d53f5.gif,2000-09-30 05:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/526-the-hour-of-bewilderbeast/,Twisted NerveXL,"At the Independent School for Emotionally Fragile Male Singer/Songwriters (mascot: the Fightin' Beatles) the headmasters award graduates tattered wool ski caps, uneven facial stubble, torn t-shirts and wristbands before nudging them into the real world. The degree doesn't get them very far, though, so the alumni typically find positions as dishwashers or heroin junkies. The pay is shit, but it's all songwriting fuel. The whimpering Elliott Smith exploded as the school's first success. With that grizzled face and old hat, Elliott quickly wore himself thin, sounding dangerously close to Aimee Mann, a recent graduate of Smith's rival public school, Solo Careers for Failed Leadsingers State. Smith's dried leaves became plastic houseplants as his once delicate acoustic numbers bloated into George Harrison knock-offs with the maudlin emotional subtlety of a Bone Thugs 'N' Harmony video. Meanwhile, gifted foreign exchange student Badly Drawn Boy's Damon Gough was bored doodling in ISEFMS classes and huffing whiteout in his shed with R.E.M's ""Hairshirt"" blaring on repeat. Now, as Elliott Smith slips dangerously close to Bryan Adams' ""(I Wanna Be) Your Underwear"" territory, Gough hits the real world with his debut full-length, The Hour of Bewilderbeast. The loose, scatterbrain album operates much like the early solo endeavors of Paul McCartney, with 80% developed gems flowing effortlessly from the damp, rustic English countryside. Yet, (fortunately?) Gough still seeks his Linda. ""It's killing me/ I'm dying,"" he sighs over Sunday morning horns, cleverly pausing before finishing: ""To put a little sunshine in your life."" In less modest mouths and over colder sounds, the song could only fail. Here, it fires up the enzymes before the shimmering guitar of ""Everybody Stalking"" suddenly echoes with verve. Just as quickly, the number dissolves into the multitracked organs of ""Bewilder."" Inconceivably, the British press heralded Badly Drawn Boy as the next Beck and Beta Band, due mostly to his lazy, absurd live performances. Clever rouse, for Gough pulled his act together brilliantly at Glastonbury 2000, securing the coveted Mercury Prize in the same critics' hearts moments before The Hour of Bewilderbeast even hit streets. After the hype, the result sounds baffling; there's not a pinch of irony to be found in the shifting, meticulous mix. ""Stone on the Water"" pummels Belle & Sebastian in the race to approximate Nick Drake's brilliance with jazz drum brushings and spider-fingered acoustic fluttering. But, not content to merely skip stones on a Scottish pond, Gough stomps harder on ""Once Around the Block,"" which similarly surpasses Elliott Smith in the crown for reaching George Harrison's ""My Sweet Lord."" Piano, strings, harps, and Wurlitzer attach insect wings to the lovely songs. They'll swarm and pester your head for days. With this concise tour through the gentler side of British songwriting history-- from understated psychedelia to sylvan protest folk-- Badly Drawn Boy proves what shallow saps American liberal arts majors can be behind a guitar.

Three,The Black Heart Procession,by: Ryan Kearney,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a0d2c0084474cd0bfc70/1:1/w_160/0a6ec20f.gif,2000-09-30 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/762-three/,Touch and Go,"Before the transformation, I wasn't particularly computer-savvy. Not that I stumbled over basic operations, but I didn't have a clue about anything that required working beneath the manageable facade of the system software. Then, while thumbing through the New York Times' Book Review, I saw a piece about Inventing Software for Dummies in which Harold Bloom insisted the book would ""make Gateses-- nay, Einsteins of us all."" How could I resist? So, I bought it, read it, and was thereafter a brilliant man. But as I also remained a music critic, I insisted upon first inventing something that would take music to a new level. Here's what I came up with: a program that creates images inspired by music. With an instantly accessible Internet database of trillions of images and videos, the program could be used by anyone, anywhere. What's more, you could play the same album as many times as you please, and the visuals would never be the same. Legitimate art on your very own desktop! And, if you think about it, I was the creator of all of it. I would be the most viewed artist of all time. When I finished the program a few months ago I wanted to test it with something really out there, to witness its full potential. So, I put in Captain Beefheart's Trout Mask Replica. Do I need to tell you what happened? The screen displayed a bubbling, vomitous mess of every color imaginable, each one appearing beside the least compatible color (brown against pink, and so on). It was the most beautiful rotten mess I'd ever seen. Then, the program crashed. After recently fixing it, I was still hesitant to run it, so I chose an album I thought wouldn't require as much range: Black Heart Procession's Three. The opening track confirmed my suspicions. Responding to the simple, ominous beat that begins ""We Always Knew,"" my computer screen flashed consecutive images of a lone soldier's stiff legs as he marched down a narrow stone corridor. The stroboscopic effect warped time, further slowing the soldier's progress. Once an equally deliberate bassline entered, the images turned into a fluid video, the camera panning back while other sounds unfolded-- drums, metallic scrapings, classical organ chords, falling piano bars, blasts of mechanized fuzz, and parabolic guitar pickings. Just as the soldier's face was about to be exposed, Pall Jenkins' low voice began singing, ""You want to know/ Where the truth is found/ We try to breathe/ But life was never found in you."" The camera stopped broadening its scope until the vocals rose in pitch, peaking with ""Did you come back from the fires?/ Did you come back from your quest?/ Was it all to see the blood was on our hands and say I guess I knew."" At that point, the screen burst into a blinding, radiant whiteness that dissolved into black-and-white catscans of fidgety brains, melting as seen through tears. For the next song, ""Guess I'll Forget You,"" the program stuck with the idea of human organs. This time it focused on the heart, starting with pictures of oversized ones, descending to that of a premature baby, and ascending back again. It repeated this process with such rapidity as to mimic a beating heart, but a horribly grotesque one. Black swaths drifted across the screen, and occasionally, when a trumpet sounded, the program showed a bull goring a Spaniard. A bit overt, but wrenching nonetheless. My computer fell asleep during ""Once Said at the Fire,"" but quickly awoke to ""Waterfront (The Sinking Road),"" with its frightening whirs, guitar strokes like sonic axes, heavy drums, and vengeful piano. A silhouetted figure on the screen maneuvered large, slippery rocks. Heavy rain obscured detail-- even the time of day-- and eventually concealed the man. When the clouds receded, only footprints in the mud remained. The entirety of ""Till We Have to Say Goodbye"" was accompanied simply by a very accurate sketch of Leonard Cohen that I could have sworn I'd seen earlier, perhaps buried beneath the ruins. Over the next three songs, the program returned to the visual themes of ""Guess I'll Forget You,"" yet with enough variation to keep the experience fresh, as all heartbreakings are. And with ""The War is Over,"" the program offered a continuous video of a sweeping bird's eye view of ravaged hillsides. For the seven-minute closer, ""On Ships of Gold""-- a thematic reprise of the opening track-- the screen returned to the lone soldier, marching to the familiar beat. As the song slowly built up, the camera pulled back and rotated to show the back of the man as he walked toward a legion of ships. His pace picked up, and he began running until he neared the shore, at which point it became clear that all the boats were sinking.","Before the transformation, I wasn't particularly computer-savvy.

Oui,The Sea and Cake,by: Brent S. Sirota,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a384ea9e61561daa4cc4/1:1/w_160/b81a3016.gif,2000-09-27 06:01:40,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7040-oui/,Thrill Jockey,"The Sea and Cake have never trafficked in revolutions. Those quick to decry a foolish consistency forget that there's an angel in the details-- an angel of our better natures, let's say, urging the hard elegance over the easy noise. To charge The Sea and Cake with rehashing the same album amounts to deriding Monet for painting the same haystacks. Not only is it wrong, it has simply missed the point. It's strange that an album as demure as Oui will have such a bitterly polarizing effect; the skirmish over the fine line between continuity and paralysis seem so irrelevant to the grace and sophistication of this work. This album's October 3rd release date already presents a small parable for Oui; it's a day consecrated to Saint Radiohead. But superficially, the day marks the release of two eagerly anticipated albums; it concludes a three-year absence of serious studio output from both bands. By way of contrast, Kid A puts its predecessors through the dream cuisinart; it turns oedipally on its forebears. Oui, however, recalls past Sea and Cake albums like lost loves: fondness tempered with regret. Some will search Oui for signs of the radical innovation and disruption than lend Kid A its oneiric vitality, but they'll search in vain. Rather, the studied affirmative of Oui is sober in the face of the past, almost sad and not quite dreaming. The Sea and Cake were born middle-aged, their respective musical puberties farmed out among a handful of preceding bands. The self-titled debut always sounded seasoned and precise. Its various musical styles are fused with such mastery and deliberation that one would never have believed that the band was intended as a one-off project. 1995's Nassau regressed into a newfound adolescence: Sam Prekop yowled; John McEntire set aside the brushes for hard sticks; Archer Prewitt's rhythmic strum dominated the album. Remember the sloppy jangle of ""Nature Boy"" or the snaky garage fusion of ""A Man Who Never Sees a Pretty Girl That He Doesn't Love Her a Little"", the churchy farfisa in ""The Cantina""? But even amidst the regression and brilliant irresponsibility of Nassau sat the shattering seaside dolor of ""Parasol"", recalling an earlier clarity, and virtually anticipating the grievous composure of Oui. The shrill yelps and jagged swing of Nassau and The Biz have faded into memory. Electronics have come to play a greater role in the band's more recent output. Whereas the electronic elements of earlier work never really moved beyond warbling afterthoughts, The Fawn was virtually engulfed in twittering synths and subtle machinery. The title track was perhaps the most artificial work of the band's entire catalog heretofore: drum machine, synthesizer loops and the sweep of programmed symphonics. The spontaneity of Eric Claridge's understated bassline served to single- handedly save that track from seeming a pale recursive remix of itself. The jazz-like spontaneity of earlier efforts was replaced with methodical studio construction. The album was lovely but somehow artificial. The abysmal Jim O'Rourke-molested remix EP follow-up, Two Gentlemen set new standards for warmed-over ambient pablum, virtually anticipating the entire Casino Versus Japan discography and receding limply into obscurity and dim regret. When was the last time you heard someone mention ""The Cheech Wizard Meets Baby Ultraman in the Cool Blue Cave?"" Please. Oui is less an apology than an awakening. A lesser band might have recanted with knee-jerk speed, hooking a fistful of lite-funk Nassau-style tunes up to the jumper cables. Instead, the Sea and Cake disappeared into painting and solo pursuits, emerging three years later with Oui like the afternoon sun in your eyes. They haven't revived the improvisational flex of their early canon; if anything Oui is the most meticulously produced thing they've done. And the electronics remain virtually omnipresent-- to strange effect, since the melodies are reminiscent of the very low-tech jazz-croon of Sam Prekop's 1999 solo album. But nothing is taken for granted. Intimacy reigns. The fact that it all holds together is astounding. McEntire's drumming is inhumanly nimble, almost approaching robotics. Beneath the boss-level video game music frenzy of ""Afternoon Speaker"", the effect is digital clockwork. Prekop oozes, ""Wasn't that a putdown?"" ingenuously over Prewitt's incredibly rhythmic lilt. It's pure synchronicity, but driven. The instrumental, ""You Beautiful Bastard"", ruminates like late summer; the music exhales. Paul Mertens' faint string arrangements meld with Prewitt's sighing wah-wah lines; Claridge's listless bassline seems to stand in for the narrative. While initially promising to be a predictable nod to vogue Brazilian music, ""The Colony Room"" subsumes its hints of tropicalia into a rising chorus of Prekop's disjointed lyric of fortune-cookieisms and found conversation: ""Welcome to the top, well, I thought so/ Bring it to an end, without hassle/ No disaster, I guarantee."" The very Tortoise-esque ""The Leaf"" fuses gamelan music with blue-eyed soul. Prekop's voice flutters out like sweet cigarette smoke: ""I'm waiting till the winter dies, skillfully."" Again, ""Two Dolphins"" flirts with tropicalia but subverts the sound with languid electronics and McEntire's too-tight percussion. Prekop stage-whispers the line that could serve as the motto for Oui: ""And I know that it sounds right/ Many miles away/ Paradox stay forever/ Celebrate this day."" Oui is stunning easy listening in recession, but up close it's genius. The production, the arrangements, the instrumentation, the electronics would sound cumbersome in the hands of the unexperienced, but The Sea and Cake fuse these elements with economy and care. If Oui doesn't erupt like an outright revolution, it's only because the band makes it look too easy. Great art doesn't always come like a shot heard 'round the world. And maybe that's the mark of a truly brilliant work of music: it's explosive inspiration masquerading as a lullaby.","The Sea and Cake have never trafficked in revolutions.

Dream Signals in Full Circles,Tristeza,by: Craig Griffith,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a8189d034d5c69bf3966/1:1/w_160/ea748df7.gif,2000-09-26 05:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8165-dream-signals-in-full-circles/,Tiger StyleTiger Style,"In the beginning, there was Nothing. And it was good. But many people proposed that Something be done about it. There exists a concept of too much of a good Nothing. The people started creating things to fill Nothing, and most of them created things worse than Nothing. After a while, people started to clamor for a return to Nothing, or at the very least, not much more than Nothing. And thus, the ""new age"" dawned, with soft synth purrs and bird noises ruling the day. Other people started making big Somethings again, usually with guitars, basses, and drums. And over time, the Nothings and the Somethings grew apart until, from the heavens of alpha-wave sleep, came Tristeza. And it was horrible. Picture a combination of Paul Winter-ish new age, the worst traits of '80s synth-pop, and post-rock of the Tortoise school. Then, take a lot of psychedelics and convince yourself that you really are interested, and that you're not just saying that to impress the aging hippie you're trying to get in the sack. If what you look for in your music is a whole lot of self-delusion, just try to get into Tristeza. I dare you. It's not as this band puts up so many barriers to entry that a gut reaction occurs, telling the listener to eject Dream Signals in Full Circles from the stereo before permanent brain damage occurs. No, they're far more subtle than that, using the age-old ""first song doesn't suck nearly as much as everything else"" bait-and-switch to paralyze the languid listener into an instant torpor. Once there, the suck is laid down like the bricks of a charnel house. To Tristeza's credit, the production values here are so high that, at any moment, Windham Hill could ring them and invite them to a vegetarian lunch to discuss a contract. Everything's clean and well-played, with only the occasional buzzy bass lick reminding one that this isn't a bunch of session musicians dozing away in an L.A. studio. The complete lack of melody is what keeps the chiming guitars and background synth pads from fully rising up from the subliminal level. You could at least hum the main/only motif of ""Mogwai Fear Satan,"" but this is like mental doldrums orchestrated for two guitars, keys, bass, and drums. The dynamics, both of volume and timbrel change, are as absent as you were on Senior Skip Day. But you can't intentionally go to bed with Tristeza, as you'll actually wake up to the mindless repetition. Dream Signals in Full Circles is Tristeza's second full-length album, and it's a goddamned Nancy Drew mystery to me how they've managed to appear on the covers of several small indie zines and accumulate a small following. But in the realm of independent music, virtually any band can establish their own fanbase. I don't know any of Tristeza's fans personally, but I do have a name for them: Children of the great Nothing-Something.","In the beginning, there was Nothing. And it was good.

Golden Lies,Meat Puppets,by: Al Shipley,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c411ea9e61561daa8079/1:1/w_160/1e956658.gif,2000-09-26 05:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5198-golden-lies/,AtlanticBreaking,"Don't let the cover art fool you. Golden Lies may continue the tradition of nearly every previous Meat Puppets album with its surreal cover illustration, but the consistencies end there. In fact, it's questionable whether the words ""Meat Puppets"" should even appear on this album's artwork, since the artist behind it is the only remaining member of the band's original lineup, guitarist Curt Kirkwood. To be fair, the outcry over the exclusion of founding members Derrick Bostrom and Cris Kirkwood is for mostly sentimental reasons. Cris' continuing downward spiral of drug addiction is an understandable if unfortunate circumstance of his absence, and Bostrom has retired to the Puppets' birthplace of Arizona, presiding over the band's legacy with an official website and last year's comprehensive series of Rykodisc reissues. In the meantime, Curt Kirkwood has relocated to Austin and enlisted a new backing band, including second guitarist Kyle Ellison, who served as an addition to the original trio's last few tours together. As such, one might hope that this Texan incarnation would recall the ZZ Top-inspired southern fried boogie of 1987's underrated Huevos. No such luck. Before we go any further, though, let's get a few things straight: a lot of the criticisms I'm levelling at this band would be rendered moot if the guys had stuck with their original name, the Royal Neanderthal Orchestra. But without the name recognition and expectations that go with the first new Meat Puppets album in five years, Golden Lies likely wouldn't even see release. And I can't say that I'd consider that such a bad thing, having heard it. Kirkwood barely even got Golden Lies issued under the Puppets' name, having been screwed on their contract to London/Polygram thanks to the Unigram merger that rendered so many of the labels' bands and workers unemployed. So, Kirkwood ended up on Breaking Records, an imprint run by none other than Hootie and the Blowfish. That's right, Hootie and the Blowfish. Yes, of Hootie and the Blowfish fame. If that isn't a severe indicator of the music industry's inability to deal with any kind of music that could be even vaguely categorized as ""rootsy,"" I don't know what is. Contrary to the conventional wisdom about commercial breakthroughs by cult favorites, 1994's Too High to Die was actually one of the best Meat Puppets albums in years at the time of its release. Its hard-spined rock approach and Curt's top-notch soloing would have made it a great guilty pleasure if they hadn't suddenly found themselves in vogue for that fleeting moment. Unfortunately, the album's follow-up, No Joke!, was just that, placing them in another rut with a droning alt-metal sensibility. Now, with half a decade and the entire rest of the band laid to waste, the band's future seems far from gleaming. And indeed, it is. Initially, Golden Lies confuses too much to allow for disappointment. After all, confounding expectations with a tweaked, fuck-all attitude was always an active ingredient in these guys' appeal. But the album's ""Intro"" itself is none too promising, a bizarre sample of the forest people of Cameroon set to a mechanized dance beat. From there, the album settles into a series of unremarkable mid-tempo hard rock tunes, with an increasingly marked sense of melancholy and resignation. With Butthole Surfer Paul Leary largely absent from the proceedings, Kirkwood's self-production comes off as a pale imitation of the inspired touches Leary offered their last couple of records. Flangers and other flashy effects twirl around at random intervals as if to distract from the inescapable blandness of the songs. Atmospheric whooshes begin nearly every track. Processed drums clank and synths bubble over. It might actually be considered slick over-production if it weren't so sloppy. ""Hercules,"" however, marks the first clear sign that something is terribly wrong. An awkward a cappella intro gives way to an even more awkward attempt at a catchy rock tune with simply awful lyrics. Later, ""Pieces of Me""-- not the Jewel song-- makes the exact same mistake. But this a cappella intro suddenly and conspicuously fades out as if Kirkwood realized they'd already done it. The goonish riff rock of ""Take Off Your Clothes"" and the downright corny ""Batwing"" are also prime contenders for sending you straight to the stop button. The evolution of Curt Kirkwood's vocal delivery has been one of the least predictable in recent history. On early Meat Puppets records, he alternated between an unsteady croon and a throaty mumble. Over the years, he's cultivated a flat, almost deadpan, approach that manages not to skirt the melody, while harmonizing with Cris in a way that only brothers can. On Golden Lies, Curt's multi-tracked vocals eerily recall Cris' harmonies, though lack the chemistry that made the combination work. And often, Curt resorts to shouting in halting syllables that vaguely resemble rapping. It's representative of the sad state of affairs that the best moments on Golden Lies transparently recall highlights from later albums already past the Meat Puppets' prime. ""Turantula"" would be a solid contender for the best song here if not for the fact that it's a lazy fusion of the jumpy rhythm from Too High to Die's ""Never to Be Found"" and a melody similar to that of half the songs on No Joke. The single, ""Armed and Stupid,"" a holdover from last year's You Love Me EP, rocks harder and more hummably than the rest of the album, but can't shake the feel of being just another No Joke outtake. Some bands display a consistency of craft that keeps them listenable even during their fallow or experimental periods. Others stumble so often and so badly that even the fans are forced to question the validity of the rewarding moments. Curt Kirkwood and the Meat Puppets have built a long career out of both disappointing and surprising, and have still managed to turn out a fair share of enduring works. But with even the identity of the band behind the name now in question, I wouldn't expect any more pleasant surprises from the Meat Puppets.","Don't let the cover art fool you.

(It (is) It) Critical Band,90 Day Men,by: Craig Griffith,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c40813d197565213be74/1:1/w_160/7f18272b.gif,2000-09-26 05:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5807-it-is-it-critical-band/,SouthernSouthern,"Well, my goose is cooked. The deadline's coming up and I can't find a simple comparison of the 90 Day Men's sound to that of two or three other better-known bands. I can only think that it reminds me of an instrumentally more accomplished and quieter version of Sonic Youth. I figured I shouldn't show my ignorance too much in this review (oops, too late), so I decided to ask my close friend Joe to identify some possible influences. Some writers get a reputation for being encyclopedias of modern music history made flesh, but Joe surpasses that mark by a few Scott Walker references and a casually mentioned connection between Travis Morrison and Laurence Welk in four degrees. If anyone can help me with this review, it's him. He's immediately impressed and surprised by the opening track, ""Dialed In."" After a minute or two of trance-inducing repetitive guitars, he asks if the band is purely instrumental. In short order, he receives his answer in the form of Brian Case's loosely rhythmic spoken vocals. As I'd previously thought, his ""slacker of the year"" delivery creates the primary anachronism of the 90 Day Men's sound. For standard delivery, his voice is as animated as a cockroach drowning in maple syrup, and in moments of expression, he simply whines in lack of diction. We both agree that if we could change one thing about this band, it would be the vocal style, or even the vocalist himself. Joe comes up with the first similarity: to Slint. He's right-- the interlocking guitars and spoken vocals satisfy some of my need for review fodder. On to another track. I skip to ""Exploration Vs. Solution, Baby,"" which begins in a more frenzied variation on the first track's ostinaticism. Case offers a bit of post-modern worry about the fate of society, then steps aside for bassist Rob Lowe (not that Rob Lowe, naturally) to chant, ""The future will not be like the past/ The future will not be like the present/ The authority of the rational as opposed to the unseen/ The importance of the concrete as opposed to the symbolic/ The importance of the individual versus group."" It struck me, as it had before, that 90 Day Men are, overall, pretty fucking pretentious. And being a fan of progressive rock, I don't throw that term around lightly. It bothers me only inasmuch as the use of overtly self-important material is done in a ham-fisted manner, as in ""Exploration Vs. Solution, Baby"" and a few other spots on the record. I can't complain too much as, at the very least, Case avoids such clumsiness most of the time. As the album progresses, Joe often mentions potential references for my review. The structures and obvious art-house attitude call Marquee Moon-era Television or the somewhat obscure Welsh band Jack. The guitar orchestration (done entirely in the studio, since Case is the only guitarist) with the occasional, subtle addition of electric pianist Andy Lansangan remind both of us of early-'80s King Crimson and Talking Heads, giving credence to their claim on New Wave influences. As previously mentioned, they ride the No Wave as well, with touch points like the frequently discordant riffing guitars and tossed-off vocal delivery of the old, good Sonic Youth. Despite such diverse influences peppered throughout the album, the 90 Day Men come up with a feel that, despite its rich heritage, sounds quite unique. I've never heard a band that created the same dark, ennui-laden feel as this one, and they deserve credit for that alone. Joe and I agree: we're giving it to them.","Well, my goose is cooked.

Though Sweet is actually pleading to an unresponsive lover in the song, he might as well be singing directly to me. No, I've never been romantically involved with the guy; I'm just having a hard time grasping Sweet's significance to '90s music. It's true that with his modern rock radio breakthrough, ""Girlfriend,"" Sweet immediately stood out as the premier power-popper of the decade. But three years later, Weezer came along, instantly seizing the crown with their perfection of the genre and pushing Sweet into runner-up position. In 2000, Sweet emerges as a somewhat inferior predecessor to Elliott Smith; they're both undoubtedly well versed in writing catchy melodies, and they both adore their own voices enough to multi-track virtually every vocal delivered, harmonizing with themselves throughout their hook-laden choruses. But whereas Smith comes off as a brooding troubadour that grew up listening to Lennon and Garfunkel, Sweet often seems like a smiley, shiny chap who was fed a steady diet of Zeppelin and Big Star. Matthew Sweet boldly embraces his influences, seemingly unconcerned about the highly derivative nature of his music. Not that there's any post-modernist mechanism at work; Sweet's music is far too simple to hold any grand, elusive meaning. In fact, Sweet's willingness to snatch ideas from his best-loved artists is often the very thing that frees his music. Let's face it: the stuff is pretty enjoyable, and doesn't pretentiously proclaim to be anything but that. And when Sweet is successful, he's truly masterful, like on the lovely mid-tempo shuffles, ""We're the Same,"" ""Sick of Myself,"" and ""What Matters."" When Sweet veers away from his usual mid-to-uptempo brand of arena pop, though, he's likely to fall on his face. The worst career highlights documented on Time Capsule include all-out ballads like the too-Phil Collins sap-fest ""Until You Break,"" and the aforementioned ""You Don't Love Me,"" which is redeemed only by its quotability. Here, Sweet does his best James Taylor, and predictably, winds up sounding... a lot like James Taylor. It's hard to say how history will remember Matthew Sweet. Less than a decade after the then-labeled ""seminal"" Girlfriend LP, there don't seem to be many people around who still care all that much about him. But at his best, Sweet made music that was at least fun, and Time Capsule suggests that while that may not secure him a place in the annals of Important '90s Rock, the attempt to get there sure was a blast.","""You can't see how I matter in this world,"" sings Matthew Sweet on ""You Don't Love Me,"" a ...

Can't be ignored-- Pinback's background noise blares with critical acclaim of an intensity easily strong enough to drown out the focused signal of their recent output. Zach (more properly known as Armistead Burwell Smith IV, but Zach'll do just fine) and Rob (Crow, that is) boast formidable genealogies in both quantity and quality. Zach's Three Mile Pilot not only rarely gets a bad review, they also share lineage with Black Heart Procession. And Rob Crow's brought no less than a Midas' touch to pretty much every project he's awkwardly strummed through. We're talking seven proper full-length albums under such worrisome monikers as Heavy Vegetable, Thingy, and Optiganally Yours. And the list just keeps growing... As such, Some Voices' four songs look like a squadron of X-Wing fighters going up against the Star Destroyer of their discography-- the odds aren't good. But when a recorded voice opens the EP with ""Hyperdrive sequence begun, hit it Pinback..."" and a synthesized drum-n-bass loop gives way to an ""Every Breath You Take"" guitar phrase, at least we know they've mastered another new angle of attack. From there, the title track coalesces into a multilayered machine of a song, tossing in a disconcerting synth noise here and an understated piano line there. Anybody recall 4AD's the Wolfgang Press in their heyday? Weird, I know, but Some Voices makes me do just that. Crow's lyrics exude a similar low-register darkness-- sort of a David Lynch-ian, lost soul tale that ends up making narrative sense in that borderline senseless Rob Crow way. ""Trainer"" follows, furthering the impression that the loose and itchy recording tendencies of their 1999 self-titled LP have tightened into the cleaner digital warmth of very modern, very inexpensive production. The opening lyric, ""Rubber wings/ Butterflies/ Tangled strings/ Choke the victim,"" places this track squarely at the end of a Rob Crow timeline; the same can be said of its more basic quartet of guitar/bass/drum/piano. ""Trainer"" comes out exuberant and spooky; if one of these four songs is a holdover from 1998's To the Innocent, this is it. ""Manchuria"" and ""June"" round out this short set in dramatic fashion. A speck of overblown rock opera sparkles in these two pieces. The grandiose lyrical war metaphors of floating along in a waterproof capsule read like bricks in someone's heightening wall. And the too-sincere emotion of Crow's ""Why must all those pretty things be sad, somehow?"" catch the sing-a-longer in you with the disturbing pointedness of near-megalomaniacal Roger Waters efficiency. But where Waters ended big records poignantly, Pinback go for off-kilter beauty; guitar, piano, and horn trundle out towards silence after reflecting: ""It's up to the trees with the firestorm."" Pretty enough for the words not to matter. Too often, EPs could easily be titled Some Songs We Didn't Get Around to Recording Until Now. But Some Voices exhibits a rare mix of cohesion and experimentation that defies the ""throwaway"" label. Very good things decorate the future of two musicians who toss this many ideas into an otherwise minor four-songer.

Bit Sand Riders,Pluramon,by: Michael Wartenbe,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a0b1c0084474cd0bfc2d/1:1/w_160/8f4edf19.gif,2000-09-19 05:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6352-bit-sand-riders/,Mille PlateauxMille Plateaux,"The name Pluramon has always brought to my mind some kind of insane animated character with a ball bouncing around in its torso and protruding through its elastic skin. It might also be a Pokémon existing in multiple realities simultaneously-- a plural-mon, if you will. It's fitting, then, that in some ways, Pluramon (aka Marcus Schmickler of the A-Musik family of Cologne) music is the aural equivalent to those humorous and outrageous visualizations. Bit Sand Riders is not technically a Pluramon release, of course. It's a remix album of tracks from Pluramon's first two albums, Pickup Canyon and Render Bandits. Nevertheless, the analogy is apt in describing the contents of the record. The lineup of remixers here is impressive in both caliber and diversity. It isn't everyday that you see Mogwai, the High Llamas, and FX Randomiz credited as having participated in the same project. And while it might appear that such disparity between contributors would be a detriment to an album's coherence, Bit Sand Riders maintains a surprisingly consistent feel throughout its progression. Sensorama opens the record with a remix of ""Flicker."" Prior to obtaining this disc, I had no idea that Sensorama even existed. It was a pleasant surprise that their involvement in this project turned out to be a relatively impressive exercise in digital processing, similar to that of the Viennese Mego camp. Music like this is often written off as coldly intellectual or pretentious, but the truth is that the sonic palette and overall texture of the track are more immediately appealing than most pop songs, despite the lack of rhythm or melody. Mogwai turn in a much more conventional interpretation of ""Hintergrund,"" from the Render Bandits album. The original material is transformed into a half-goth/half-shoegazer groove hybrid, complete with trip-hop drum loop and tension building bridge. It's definitely a catchy tune, but it tends to become a little tedious after repeated listens, since there really isn't much meat to it aside from what's apparent on the first listen. The decidedly quirky San Franciscan duo Matmos take a stab at ""Hintergrund"" as well, to a greater degree of success. In fact, the remix, entitled ""Pluramonthermatmos,"" is one of the album's standouts. In addition to the source material from Render Bandits, Drew Daniel and Martin Schmidt incorporate toy piano and banjo, among many other things, into their reworking. The result is an extremely dense drum-n-bass track with all the funny/interesting sound combinations we've come to expect from Matmos. The song is complex enough to provide hours of entertainment as an audio puzzle alone, but to top it off, it's also engaging and fun. Other notable moments on the disc include Lee Ranaldo's breezy acoustic-riff-turned-frenetic-electronic-number, which employs material from the entirety of Render Bandits and, consequently, wins the prize for most hilarious song title for ""Microchip, Shit! My Cock is Analog."" SND, the Sheffield dyad, offer a catchy, bouncy track of glitches and overloads that's refreshingly straightforward. And providing the most annoying track on Bit Sand Riders is Mego's own Hecker, who comes through with the most grating (but lovable) sounds this side of Pita. But then, who could top Merzbow in the exasperating noise department? If there's any noteworthy downside to Bit Sand Riders, it's that there's a lot to digest. David Byrne has been known to say that it isn't easy for anyone to listen to more than six tracks in one sitting, and he might even lower that figure when the concept is applied to IDM fare. The upside, of course, is that every track stands on its own as an individual presentation of the material that inspired it. Even if you're unfamiliar with Pluramon's discography, Bit Sand Riders is an absorbing and, more importantly, enjoyable listen, regardless of genre specificity.","The name Pluramon has always brought to my mind some kind of insane animated\n\ character with a ball bouncing ...

"Designer Music: The Remixes, Vol. 1",Carl Craig,by: Paul Cooper,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6979d034d5c69bf3590/1:1/w_160/3a4ae2da.gif,2000-09-19 05:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1655-designer-music-the-remixes-vol-1/,Planet E,"Some people are born to ride free. Some people, on the other hand, will parade through life to the applause and acclaim of all around them. Carl Craig is one of those people. Since he stepped out onto center stage of Detroit techno, whatever he's released has been graced with universal acclaim. And while it's true that much of what he's produced is noteworthy, he's far from being able to turn muck into brass. I've found that it's Craig's work under aliases that merits the real props. His 69 and Paperclip People guises give him the freedom to funk and get the floor buckling; as Innerzone Orchestra, Craig seriously indulges in his Sun Ra fantasies and I can't help but be sucked in. But the two albums released under his birthname seem awkward, stilted, and striving for ""art"" status. Designer Music: The Remixes is an awkward compilation of Carl Craig's remixes of other musicians' material and as such showcases both his strengths and his indulgent arty weaknesses. On this disc, Craig veers from excellence to insouciance, and expects not to be called on it. United Future Organization's ""Planet Plan"" is first up, setting the tone for the first half of the collection. The remix sounds as though the extent of the additional production was appending his own name to the track credits. As for his reworking of conguero Johnny Blas' ""Picadillo,"" Craig has stripped the Havana party horn blasts and let the congas rumble on for eight minutes. To be fair, ""Picadillo"" works as a DJ tool, and in doing so, harkens back to the original Designer Music 12"" Craig released for the long since defunct Planet E subscription series. ""Picadillo"" could easily serve as a transition disc from one Nuyorican effort to the next, but I question the need for it to be compiled. However, Craig's Planet E Special mix of Incognito's ""Out of the Storm"" more than deserves inclusion on every techno compilation. Yes, every one. Craig takes Incognito's smooth, radio-friendly vocal jazz and transforms the band's oh-so sophisticated schlock into unadulterated techno soul. This is the track you should play to those who claim that music made by machines (e.g. techno) is devoid of soul. Out of a slopping, slinky downtempo rhythm, Craig develops a whirling dervish of ARP lines capable of transporting even the most stolid heart. Unfortunately, the high induced by ""Out of the Storm"" is robbed from us by the mix of Telex's ""Moscow Diskow."" But to his credit, Craig isn't working with great material to begin with here. Contrary to what the Belgian cultural attaché might have you believe, Telex never did anything to disabuse the rest of the world of the notion that Belgium is an artistic vacuum. ""Moscow Diskow"" is an excruciating, Ed Wood Jr.-esque attempt at aping the glories of Kraftwerk. Telex's abilities are so minuscule that Craig is left to extend the track by four minutes or so, plopping in some extra-spacy blurps and blops, and collect his large honorarium check. By the time you've reached this point in the album, you're praising whoever designed the skip forward button. Why bother with Craig's mix of Inner City's ""Buena Vida,"" which is little more than an a cappella or the directionless Urban Affair mix of BT's ""Moment of Truth?"" Of course, Craig forces us into enduring such brackish gruel in order to reap our reward: the final three tracks. Here, he showcases the dancefloor, where he's inarguably most secure and expert. The remixes of Spacetime Continuum, Alexander Robotnik, and Ron Trent each exude the no-nonsense nous Craig demonstrates whenever he produces a Paperclip People track. Yes, these remixes are minimal-- there are no jazzy tropes, no Latin flourishes. But in their stead, you get the pure sound of mechanical funk that sets Detroit apart from the rest of the world. Designer Music: The Remixes just about makes a case for remixing being more than a mere marketing ploy. But only just.","Some people are born to ride free.

Felt Mountain,Goldfrapp,by: Matt LeMay,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bf5eea9e61561daa7a52/1:1/w_160/863dd0ba.gif,2000-09-19 05:00:02,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3504-felt-mountain/,Mute,"If you'd told me a few weeks back that I'd be lusting after some chick named Goldfrapp, I'd have told you to pack your bags for an all-expenses-paid trip to my fist. But writing this review, all I can think of is Goldfrapp. Sweet, sweet Goldfrapp. Mmm... Goldfrapp. Before I get accused of any level of chauvinism here, I feel I should defend myself. I am, after all, only a male variant of the human species. And what sane, sexually functional guy could resist a woman who whispers in a throaty voice, ""No time to fuck/ But you like the rush?"" Not me! What's more, she's English! English from England! And she hangs out with Orbital! C'mon, now! Taking cues from apparent influences ranging from Marlena Dietrich to Siouxsie Sioux to Björk, Alison Goldfrapp has constructed an album that's simultaneously smarmy and seductive, yet elegant and graceful. Describing the sound of Felt Mountain comes easy not because it's a simple album, but because the devices used throughout are so ingrained in our musical vernacular. If Austin Powers had been a film noir flick, its soundtrack would probably sound something like Felt Mountain. The hushed vocals, the crying analog synthesizers, and the sustained seven chords all evoke amazingly strong images of things past. Still, the album manages not to sound dated, kept fresh by occasional journeys into more experimental electronics and Goldfrapp's always-engaging vocals. Felt Mountain opens with ""Lovely Head,"" a track that juxtaposes a shuffling drum beat and whistling that sounds like it could be 50 years old with futuristic analog beeps. Goldfrapp's voice, with all its warmth and expressiveness, sounds instantly familiar. And it retains this familiarity over the course of the album, excepting a throaty, Siouxsie-esque yelp or two in ""Human,"" and a bizarre passage at the end of ""Deer Stop,"" in which her voice is made to sound eerily childlike. Creepy, especially considering the sexual undertones present. All this taken into account, Felt Mountain's greatest strength lies in its overall elegance as a record. While certainly not ""poppy,"" it never has a truly weak moment. And while the songs aren't all that different from one another, the flow from track to track makes perfect sense. To summarize, Felt Mountain is a really swell record, and I am madly in love with Alison Goldfrapp. I'd have her name tattooed on my arm, but... you know. There just isn't room in this world for a man with ""Goldfrapp"" inscribed in his flesh. Luckily, there's always room in the world for a damned fine record.","If you'd told me a few weeks back that I'd be lusting after some chick\n\ named Goldfrapp ...

Ghost of David,Damien Jurado,by: Rich Juzwiak,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c35213d197565213bced/1:1/w_160/6b7803c9.gif,2000-09-19 05:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4328-ghost-of-david/,Sub PopSub Pop,"The first eight words Seattle folkie Damien Jurado sings on his third LP proper, Ghost of David, masterfully sum up the record in both tone and subject: ""It just so happens I have many concerns,"" Jurado delivers, taking the listener by the hand and calmly curating an album-long tour of woe. Jurado's grip is as matter-of-fact as his lyric, as subtlety is, perhaps paradoxically, his most outstanding trait. Jurado isn't here to batter listeners with social commentary or to weave heavy-handed themes into his arsenal of character-driven story-songs. Thank god. With Ghost of David, Jurado more than makes up for his last effort: the silly, if not pointless, Postcards and Audio Letters. Ancient tape-recorded conversations acquired from thrift store bins were assembled onto a CD and packaged as Jurado's own to form one of the most bloated ""concept"" pieces 2000 saw. Bereft of music, the album seemed a cop-out, and an unworthy follow-up to Jurado's previous studio gem, 1999's Rehearsals for Departure. Regardless, Jurado is in top-form on Ghost of David, bettering his previous sound. Gone is the folk-pop hybrid that often had the effect of mixing brownish canned peas with lumpy mashed potatoes. Instead, for the first half of the record, Jurado cooks up toothsome, bare-boned, mostly solo-acoustic folk. Too important to be considered a mere side dish are Jurado's eloquent and accomplished lyrics. Often, he takes the traditional route of folksinger-as-storyteller to great success. The album's opener, the bleak ""Medication,"" tells the story of a man who must divide his attention and affection between his married lover and his mentally ill brother. On ""Tonight I Will Retire,"" he assumes the role of a man about to commit suicide as he sings over a whisked beat and eerie piano. Jurado laments, ""If I should taste fire/ Save me not, I deserve to die,"" tenderly straining his voice. It's doubtful that Jurado, the fine Christian chap that he is, has been in either of these situations personally, but his empathetic delivery and avoidance of sappiness propel the tracks to a sincerity that even the most confessional, soul-bearing songwriters often fail to deliver. Jurado dives into more experimental territory during the second half of the album-- an interesting move after playing it so straight. I can't knock him for his initiative, and his shunning of sing-along pop is dually commendable. However, the second half of the album is largely hit-or-miss. ""Parking Lot"" is lulling and pretty but sports Sarah McLachlan-esque lead vocals by Rose Thomas. Why Jurado chose not to grace the song with his own molasses-coated pipes is a mystery, as it could have been the record's best track. ""Paxil"" is a grinding, garage-rocker that only reinforces Jurado's strength with folk-based material. Still, the organ flourishes on ""Rearview"" and ""December"" add an ethereal quality that surprisingly complements the folk components of the tunes. Unfortunately, the last half of Ghost of David, while sometimes as stunning as the first, gives the album a slightly inconsistent feel. And though this record proves that Jurado has yet to release a masterpiece, Jurado is aware of his flaws. In ""Great Today,"" he sings, ""I could be so much better."" I don't know about the ""so much"" part, but with that attitude, a perfect album can't be too far away.","The first eight words Seattle folkie Damien Jurado sings on his third LP proper, Ghost of David, masterfully sum up ...

The Friends of Rachel Worth,The Go-Betweens,by: Meg Zamula,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bf3f13d197565213b871/1:1/w_160/23c7882e.gif,2000-09-19 05:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3475-the-friends-of-rachel-worth/,Jetset,"Once upon a time, everything the local ""modern rock"" station played sounded like The Friends of Rachel Worth. Before Papa Roach, before the Presidents of the United States of America, before even the Toadies, the likes of the Lightning Seeds, Lloyd Cole, and the Blue Aeroplanes dominated the alternative airwaves. I'm not going to attempt some kind of authoritative history of the era, since I didn't get a chance to exercise my 12 year-old critical skills that often before Nirvana broke. As I recall it, though, there were lots of keyboard-augmented, mid-tempo British (and faux-British) bands, tempered only by the occasional Jane's Addiction outburst. The Go-Betweens were better than that scene, and content to be Australian. But their sound wasn't fundamentally different from many bands in the post-new wave/ pre-grunge era. When Robert Forster and Grant McLennan released the first Go-Betweens album in 1981, their smart, organic approach to pop was no doubt refreshing. Still, by the time they disbanded in 1989, there were numerous aspirants to the clever pop throne, and even if those bands never wrote songs quite as well as the Go-Betweens, they often sold more records. The album opens on a high note with McLennan's ""Magic in Here,"" a tuneful, bittersweet anthem with a propulsive bass line. But while 11 years have passed since the last Go-Betweens album saw release, the band's sound hasn't changed significantly. Yes, Forster and McLennan recruited a good percentage of the northwest indie scene to appear on this record (Elliott Smith, Corin Tucker and Carrie Brownstein of Sleater-Kinney, Sam Coomes of Quasi, and Janet Weiss of, erm, both), but their presence is largely undetectable. ""The Clock"" is a notable exception, beginning with an unmistakable edgy Brownstein riff, but the song quickly retreats into wistful jangle-pop. Even when Tucker contributes her normally explosive vocals to ""Going Blind,"" her harmonies with McLennan evoke Papas Fritas more than punk rock. I'm not deluded. I didn't expect the Go-Betweens to start rocking just because they hung out in Portland for a little while. In fact, ""German Farmhouse,"" the most aggressive song on the album, is easily its least appealing. When the aging Forster makes a shaky attempt at bravado and earnestly croons, ""There was a rumor that Pavarotti would sing there/ To raise funds for a music school, but then the whole thing just vanished into thin air/ I said, thin air,"" it's just too much to take. Forster's songwriting, in fact, proves consistently disappointing. ""Spirit"" and ""When She Sang about Angels,"" a tribute to Patti Smith, strive for meaningful sentiment, but Forster's awkward phrasing makes it difficult to listen to without a smirk. ""When she sang about a boy/ Kurt Cobain/ I thought what a shame/ It wasn't about/ Tom Verlaine."" Uh, what? It's dispiriting to see the composer of gems like ""Spring Rain"" and ""The House That Jack Kerouac Built"" in such poor form. For a band returning from a decade-long sabbatical, these guys are surprisingly spry. Their consistency is also, to some degree, their downfall, since they still sound uncannily mid-'80s. And whereas past Go-Betweens records, like 1984's Spring Hill Fair and 1988's 16 Lovers Lane, have maintained their charm after the passage of more than a decade, The Friends of Rachel Worth comes off as a relic of another era. New generations of Aussie pop bands have emerged since those early days, and the wit and harmonies of the Lucksmiths and the subtle melancholy of Sodastream sound fresher and more relevant now. But even past their prime, the Go-Betweens are still better than anything on present alternative radio playlists.","Once upon a time, everything the local ""modern rock"" station played sounded like The Friends of Rachel Worth.

Not the Tremblin' Kind,Laura Cantrell,by: Michael Sandlin,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a50eb1335d7bf1698aeb/1:1/w_160/f742b878.gif,2000-09-15 05:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1286-not-the-tremblin-kind/,Diesel OnlyDiesel Only,"Not long after its official origins in the early 1900's, country music quickly began to endure the vicious cycle of having its authenticity tainted by commercial compromise, then redeemed, however fleetingly, by some ""underground"" roots movement. And it's a relief to hear so many of those redeeming qualities in the voice of Laura Cantrell, a city gal who celebrates country tradition in her music even as she augments it. Cantrell reclaims the essence of country songwriting, but she also puts subtle twists on familiar slice-of-life songs about whiskey drinkin', relationships gone sour, livin' on the road, and simple girl-wants-boy longing. Her music, whether inherently sad or jubilant, is always delivered with convincing sincerity. She's also not afraid to explore uncomfortable psychological truths in intimate and eloquent detail. Such affecting down-home realism, of course, is always glossed over by the homogenous evil of the ""new"" Nashville country. But contrary to country tradition, Cantrell sings no songs about blowing away her spouse with a shotgun 'cause she loved him. It's just not her style. Anyone who's heard Cantrell's weekly WFMU New Jersey radio show, ""Thrift Shop Radio,"" knows she has impeccable taste in country songwriters. On Not the Tremblin' Kind, she chooses to filter great songs by George Usher, Amy Allison, and Joe Flood through her supple vocal cords. And although her own writing talents are evident, this album contains only four originals-- the standout, ""Queen of the Coast,"" is a tear-jerker about a small-town singer whose vague dreams of stardom succumb to routine, old age, and bungled marriages. Comparisons to a young Dolly Parton or Kitty Wells seem justified enough, as Cantrell possesses a heartbreakingly sweet voice without being cloying in the way, say, Olivia Newton-John was during her frightening early 70's country phase. True, Cantrell may not have the voluminous pipes of a powerhouse vocalist like Tammy Wynette or Rosanne Cash, but we're not talking about the feeble peep of some Dixie Chick here, either. In fact, on ""The Whiskey Makes You Sweeter,"" Cantrell floors with her lilting phrasing-- singing of the strange aphrodisiac effects of that favorite country-song libation. This could easily be an answer to Loretta Lynn's ""Don't Come Home a Drinkin' (with Lovin' on Your Mind)."" A Byrdsy 12-string flourish prefaces ""Do You Ever Think of Me?,"" which is more a conventional 60's pop tune than anything else, with its lively, un-country Farfisa lines bouncing around the verses. The title track could be the anti-""Stand by Your Man,"" considering defiant sentiments like: ""You want me to get down on my knees, and beg for just a little sympathy/ You want me to go to bed defeated and resigned/ Oh, no, I'm not the tremblin' kind."" Then there's the rousing country-rock of ""Pile of Woe,"" whose bright orange sunrise chords and uptempo rhythms reinforce faint hope of deliverance from the world's misery: ""This whole world's a mess a trouble,"" she sings, just before that great refrain, ""But I'm lookin' out for rain in every grain of hope I sow, plowin' this pile of woe."" Pure gen-u-wine country-fried poe'try, friend. Instead of applying the old-school production ethic of distancing the singer's voice with lonesome reverb, producer Jay Sherman-Godfrey lays off the effects board and goes for stark intimacy. This approach accentuates and isolates Cantrell's voice, so that at times, you get a sense of her delivery being tentative, as if she's unsure of her range. Ultimately, though, this heightened vulnerability seems to work in Cantrell's favor: even her slight vocal inadequacies become endearing after awhile. And too bad Cantrell couldn't employ multi-instrumentalist Jon Graboff's weepy steel guitar more often. His style is lifted right off Sweetheart of the Rodeo and could've made up for the less-than-inspired electric guitar. Graboff also turns in some impressive Doc Watson-style acoustic flatpicking. And his ubiquitous mandolin playing is as easy on the ears as Cantrell's singing, as its accompanying melodies frolic endlessly behind the vocals. For the most part, Not the Tremblin' Kind features the sort of instrumentation and arrangement you'd find on the most classic of traditionalist country albums-- the focus being mainly on the voice and lyrics, with unobtrusive acoustic guitar and mandolin carrying most of the lead instrumental duties. But again, this is not 50's Nashville or even the 60's Bakersfield sound being faithfully updated. The spirit of Gram Parsons, and the influence of other country-rock innovators like Emmylou Harris can be heard as well, as Cantrell juggles her neo-hillbilly roots (hell, she was actually born in Nashville) with her more cosmopolitan pop/rock instincts. Although not a flawless album, Not the Tremblin' Kind can still measure up pretty well to most of the revered alt-country releases of the last decade: albums such as Freakwater's Old Paint, the Blood Oranges' Corn River, and Victoria Williams' Loose. And it damn sure beats any neo-country slop Son Volt, the Jayhawks or the Handsome Family could ever shovel up, no matter how hard those college-rockers try to sound hick.","Not long after its official origins in the early 1900's, country music quickly began to endure the vicious cycle ...

...With Ghost,Damon & Naomi,by: Ryan Kearney,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a8935e6ef95969321243/1:1/w_160/bca15789.gif,2000-09-15 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2156-with-ghost/,Sub PopSub Pop,"Naomi Yang was involved in graphic design before she ever picked up a bass guitar. Or, at least, I think so. In explaining how Dean Wareham, Damon Krukowski and Naomi Yang formed the seminal Galaxie 500 while at Harvard in the mid-1980s, the liner notes of Rykodisc's reissues of their only three albums state that Naomi began only as the ""graphic advisor."" After a failed search for a bassist, ""Naomi announced that she would play bass (something she had never done previously)."" While at first I assumed that ""graphics"" referred to technical production-- that is, as in ""graphics equalizer""-- I became confident in my present conviction after noticing that she's credited for the design of the Galaxie 500 albums, and Damon and Naomi with Ghost. So, why does this matter? Because everything about the latter album's artwork is incredibly deliberate. I don't feel myself stretching when I say that Naomi Yang probably envisions the new album's ""look"" as a reflection of its sound. If these are her thoughts, she's quite right. The manner in which Damon & Naomi with Ghost appears on the front and side of the jewel case is the first of many telling visual signs; for ""Damon & Naomi"" is printed in standard black ink while ""with Ghost"" is given a silvery gray that almost disappears when viewed at certain angles. In other words, like an incarnation of the fantastic, Ghost's influence is often imperceptible, though it's always around. Since Masaki Batoh aided in the album's production, and since he, Michio Kurihara and Kazuo Ogino provided background instrumentation, Japan's Ghost-- or at least its core members-- had a hand in every song here. One would think that, coming off of last year's rich Snuffbox Immanence, the psych-folk collective would add profound depth and originality to Damon and Naomi's dreamy folk. Ghost were just what the duo needed to put the ""core"" back in the slowcore; it had been noticeably absent in their post-Galaxie output. But, regardless of who's to blame, Ghost's role isn't large enough to alter Damon and Naomi's sound. The tasteful shiver of a pedal steel on the opener, ""The Mirror Phase,"" could be attributed to Ghost, as could an accordion-esque undercurrent. But even if they're the work of Ghost, these and other less identifiable atmospheric sounds are by no means overt. Instead, they're buried frustratingly deep below the simple drums, acoustic guitars and vocals, and often inaudible without intense scrutiny. The only moments when Ghost's influence on Damon & Naomi's material takes centerstage-- other than the album's four conspicuous electric guitar solos-- is on ""The New World,"" the music for which was composed solely by Ghost. And it shows: the acoustic guitar steps aside to make room for a sprightly harpsichord, orchestral keyboards, haunting choir-chords and, beneath it all, metal that clanks, clashes, shatters and splashes. Other than these few exceptions, Ghost never unleash the lush, varied instrumentation-- not to mention Batoh's distinct voice-- that makes their work so unique. But just because this is essentially another Damon & Naomi album doesn't render it unlistenable. Damon Krukowski's off-key falsetto works nicely alongside Yang's simpler, more consistent vocals; by sharing the microphone, they prevent either voice from becoming unbearable. And tracks such as ""The Mirror Phase,"" ""Judah and the Maccabees,"" and ""The Great Wall"" are beautiful songs, even if they do contain simplistic, pseudo-proverbs such as ""The ocean is wide, the tides run deep,"" and, ""These heights will rise faster than they fall."" And then there are songs like the conveniently-titled ""Don't Forget,"" which are as forgettable as they come. The photographs in the album artwork are of a moss-covered hillside bathing in sunlight, a bamboo shaft against mud-packed reeds, a parabolic shadow in the sand, and a slant of light against an interior barn wall-- all of them nearly surreal pastoral scenes that are pleasant to the eye. The well-focused images contain significant detail, but there are only a few distinct objects to focus on. After looking over them a few times, there's nothing else to be gained. One must accept them for their elevated warmth alone. The same could be said for the music, which is why Ghost with Damon & Naomi would have made for a more compelling listen.","Naomi Yang was involved in graphic design before she ever picked up a bass guitar.

They've worked on solving the difficulties inherent in performing techno live. Or performing techno live at arenas or festivals, anyway. The first time I saw the band play out, just before Dubnobasswithmyheadman was released, was at a twisted club called the Soundshaft, which adjoined the famous London boite, Heaven. That night (a Good Friday, I almost recall), the owners of the two clubs opened up the doors that partitioned the very different styles. The Soundshaft Drum Club techno massive shimmied and sashayed with the amyl house of Heaven. After a few hours of DJ sets, a band took the small, almost ad hoc stage, and stylistic divisions in the area immediately vanished. Underworld, for it was they, performed extended versions of songs off Dubnobasswithmyheadman, liquidly morphing from ""Mmm Skyscraper, I Love You"" and ""Rez"" to ""Cowgirl"" and ""Dirty Epic."" I didn't know any of these classics at the time, but after a two-hour set and having been a part of the euphoria this band concocted, they became my most precious band. And rarely have they, in the years since that club gig, disappointed. I saw them perform before Second Toughest in the Infants saw release. Their set at the mid-sized Astoria mixed the familiar sounds of Dubno with the breakbeats the band had been experimenting with for the album. That set sounded like evolution, and the audience participated in the rolling out of the new style Underworld. Everything, Everything documents the live stage that followed breakbeat Underworld. Beaucoup Fish hinted at trance and electro, but depicted a more melancholy Underworld. Beaucoup Fish recapitulated the styles of its predecessors but struck them through with a palpable mourning. That Darren Emerson-- the member who took them from third on the bill opening for the Eurythmics to dance music icons-- would leave the band after that album, and their largest U.S. reception to date makes it all the more poignant. Though Everything, Everything is unquestionably a swan song for the Emerson years, it's far from a mopey affair. In fact, it tackles early tracks like ""Rez"" and ""Cowgirl,"" and pumps them up with megawatt power. It also serves as a greatest hits package, including their most famed numbers, ""Pearl's Girl"" and ""Push Upstairs,"" among others. Vocalist Karl Hyde predictably reserves his loudest delivery for the ""Shouting Lager! Lager! Lager!"" line in the 12-minute, bone-buckling rendition of ""Born Slippy Nuxx."" But as with all live albums, one misses the being-there. Sure, Everything, Everything documents the crowd's loopy joy when the piano vamps of ""King of Snake"" break though the filthy Giorgio Moroder-inspired bass line. But we miss the visuals. The sine qua non component of Underworld is Tomato, the experimental graphic design firm of which Hyde and Smith are members. The cut-up, scraggly, ugly beauty of Tomato's type solutions are matched and amplified in Hyde's Byron Gisin-ish lyrics (e.g. ""Got my 501s freeze- dried with a new religion""). Underworld are aware of the significant piece missing from Everything, Everything and will soon release a DVD version, which will insert Tomato into the live document. Looks like these lads really have thought of everything.","The members of Underworld are smart, savvy lads. They've worked on solving the difficulties inherent in performing techno live ...

Holiday in Rhode Island,The Softies,by: Nick Mirov,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a4a2ea9e61561daa4f50/1:1/w_160/64a38fe6.gif,2000-09-12 05:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7316-holiday-in-rhode-island/,K,"Nearly everyone remembers the moment when their hearts broke for the first time. But there are those who never seem to be able to live it down; they're stuck in that moment, unable to achieve escape velocity from an emotional black hole. Some such people cling desperately to anyone who passes by in the hopes that they can be pulled out; others wallow, becoming permanently embittered and cynical. And then there are those who learn to live comfortably in that moment, even going so far as to do a little interior decorating-- matching drapes, throw rugs, comfy chairs, and the like. You can probably guess which category the Softies fall into. For five years and four albums now, Rose Melberg and Jen Sbragia of the Softies have remained ensconced firmly in their sweet, sad little universe; with just two guitars and two voices (not counting the occasional xylophone or piano overdub), they've taken a setup that would otherwise be used for Indigo Girls-style coffeehouse-folk evil and spun dreamily melancholy indie-pop songs from it Holiday in Rhode Island isn't exactly an ambitious artistic leap forward from their previous albums, but so what? As far as rainy Sunday morning hangover listening goes, it fits the bill perfectly. On top of a bed of willowy guitars, Melberg and Sbragia exhale cherry blossoms with every cooing sigh. Generous amounts of reverb slathered over every sound ensures that nothing hits harder than a hail of cottonballs, not even the drums that tiptoe their way through ""Me and the Bees."" But the Softies temper all this precious prettiness from the very outset; the first lyrics you hear on Holiday in Rhode Island are, ""If I beg you will you smother me / Just to put me out of this constant misery,"" followed by lines like, ""I wish I had never known/ A heart that beats just like my own""; ""Take it downstairs/ No one here cares""; and ""Now my empty arms are of no use to anyone."" The combination of happy melodies and sad lyrics is by no means an innovation, but lesser bands often get the balance between the two wrong, ending up sounding either coy or overwrought. The Softies take a page from the Magnetic Fields' fakebook and sing as straight and as dispassionately as possible, and it works, lending an emotional authenticity to otherwise undistinguished lyrics. Despite the sameness of instrumentation and mood, though, the songs don't all sound alike; the Softies aren't repetitive so much as consistent. Not all the songs here are about heartbreak or depression, either; the title track and ""You and Only You"" express the inverse-- love gained rather than lost. Is it any surprise that they sound much the same as the other songs on Holiday in Rhode Island? Perhaps the Softies understand that there actually isn't much of a difference between the feelings of falling into and out of love. It's still a sensation of falling, except on Holiday in Rhode Island it feels more like floating. And as much as the word ""nice"" is overused, it's quite nice. Just like the Softies themselves. Nice.","Nearly everyone remembers the moment when their hearts broke for the first time. But there are those who never seem ...

Kelly's Locker EP,Sarah Cracknell,by: Paul Cooper,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a695b1335d7bf1698e73/1:1/w_160/463a404a.gif,2000-09-12 05:00:02,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1653-kellys-locker-ep/,Instinct,"About this time of year, in the run-up to the holiday season, my thoughts turn to Frank Capra movies. I wonder whether that venerated director's view of humanity has ever been fully validated. Can one point to a person as compassionate as those so memorably portrayed by James Stewart? I also think about the premise of It's a Wonderful Life. What would be the ripple effects of anyone of us not ever having existed? Would I experience a quantifiable depreciation in my hedonic quotient if your mom and dad had never procreated? Rather than directly answering that specific question, I prefer (for social reasons of politeness) to consider the effect of certain celebrities' non-existence. I'd like to think that I wouldn't miss Calista Flockhart. But I rather enjoyed her self-mockery on a recent episode of ""Saturday Night Live."" Would I feel a nagging tug if Lou Diamond Philips had never walked this Earth? Probably not. I certainly wouldn't have missed Bats. The only justification I can discern for Kevin Bacon is that the parlor game Six Degrees of Charlie Sheen wouldn't be half as much of a brain-teaser. In music, while I wouldn't hesitate to scream for the births of Miles Davis, Dr. Alex Patterson, Stephen Patrick Morrissey, the Hartnoll Brothers, Kate Bush, Grace Slick, Zoltan Kodaly, and Fela Kuti, I have to think long and hard about Elizabeth Fraser, Seal, Norman Cook, and Sarah Cracknell. In the cases of Elizabeth Fraser and Seal, I have to grudgingly consent to their conceptions on the grounds that many of my friends have had very successful sexual encounters soundtracked by this pair's unique, orgasm-encouraging vocal talents. Sarah Cracknell, though a marginal candidate for existence, would have passed the test-- just. But that was before I heard Kelly's Locker. Never the brains behind St Etienne's glossing of long since abandoned bachelor pad, girl-group, three-minute pop, she provided a convenient dolly head for Pete Wiggs and Bob Stanley to proliferate their Xeroxed fanzine-esque adoration of a load of old thrift-store tat. And for a while, I was hooked. ""Avenue"" and ""California Duvet"" still rank among my favorite Brian Wilson rip-offs. I can overlook the boys' dumping of original vocalist, Faith over Reason's Moira Lambert, when I remember fondly David Holmes' skull-crushing acid remix of ""Like a Motorway."" And come to think of it, I rather enjoyed Sound of Water when I last paid attention to it. However, stripped of the Croydon lads who long for a walk-on part in a Nick Hornby novel, Cracknell comes severely unstuck. Far more dire than a One Dove-less Dot Allison, Cracknell minus Wiggs and Stanley exposes her own childish dream to be Julie Christie in Billy Liar. Except Cracknell would be filmed stumbling over her shopping bags, ending up arse-over-tit in a gray-skied shopping precinct, confused, embarrassed, and cursing the world for being so unfair to her. In an attempt to disbuse us of this image, Instinct Records, fresh from causing no stir whatsoever with a new Marianne Faithful album, release a companion b-sides EP to the lousily selling Cracknell album, Lipslide. Which, by the way, was released a donkey's age ago in the UK and has been re-jigged for American audiences. Notice? I hardly even cared. So I'm presented with the splatty back end of Instinct's campaign to get a little Cracknell into every home. Do I really wish to describe the pallid piano ballad that is ""Judy, Don't You Worry,"" or the Euro-dance dreck that Cracknell calls ""Taking Off for France?"" Nico's Liquid Steel remix of ""Anymore"" adds a modicum of drum-n-bass excitement to the original but not enough to excuse the Vengaboys-for-Uptown-Soirees statement of vacuity, ""Penthouse Girl, Basement Boy."" How about if I skip the would-be anthemic were-it-not-so-Michael Bolton ""How Far?"" Thank you for your consideration of my feelings and not pushing me to describe this purposeless release any further. Just like the characters in a Capra flick, I feel I've learnt a great moral lesson. I feel your warmth and humanity, and your concern for my well-being humbles me. I am now very glad you were born. You have improved my life substantially. There's a place for you at my Thanksgiving table. Do stay a while, friend.","About this time of year, in the run-up to the holiday season, my thoughts turn to Frank Capra movies. I ...

Secret South,Sixteen Horsepower,by: Al Shipley,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a4355e6ef95969320804/1:1/w_160/228dc1b9.gif,2000-09-12 05:00:01,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7209-secret-south/,Razor & TieRazor & Tie,"I can't tell you how many times I've listened as someone boasted their eclectic tastes and love for ""all kinds of music, except country."" You've probably heard it, too. Hell, I bet you've gone around saying it yourself. At least until that alt-country hype gave you hope that you weren't necessarily too cool for it, and didn't even have to buy boots or take line-dancing classes to indulge. Sixteen Horsepower might be ideal country music for those who think themselves too hip for twang, but are too nauseated by Son Volt's slide-guitar fluff. Rather, this band inhabits the same dark corner once occupied by the Geraldine Fibbers, where goth and southern gothic intersect without much to interest purists of either form. David Eugene Edwards is the son of a preacher man and claims that his lyrics come to him from a higher power. So why isn't his band working that angle for the hard sell, opening for DC Talk or, at the very least, releasing records on Tooth & Nail? Well, for starters, Sixteen Horsepower's music is scarier than any rock n' roll Antichrist you can name. In fact, if there's anything Edwards' holy rants bring to mind, it's an enraged Jules Winnfield reciting Ezekiel 25:17 with his gun's barrel bruising your temple. Secret South blasts forward with a pump of fuzz bass that immediately puts emphasis on one of Sixteen Horsepower's more distinctive but less obvious defining traits: a massive low end. Bassist Pascal Humbert and the groaning cello occasionally supplied by guest string players suggest the kind of floor-rattling hum more closely associated with Jeeps than the horse-and-buggy that would make the band's ideal touring vehicle. Jean-Yves Tola completes the formative rhythm section, anchoring the surrounding banjo, fiddle, and bandoneon flourishes with galloping beats that not only serve as the foundation for these songs, but also justify the band's moniker-- they provide a relentless engine to Edwards' songs while dragging them away with wild horses. But at the moment, Sixteen Horsepower are knee-deep in the awkwardness that follows being dropped from a major label. After reaching a plateau of quality with 1998's Low Estate, their doomed contract with A&M; Records reached its inevitable conclusion. So now they're not only operating on a smaller label with less promotional reach, but they're also facing an inability to raise the stakes and satisfy the remaining fanbase. Secret South is a characteristically strong showing, but ultimately, it pales in comparison to its predecessors. The self-produced album retains the band's unique sound, but fails to measure up to the perfect match they found in guitarist John Parish for Low Estate's crisply rustic atmosphere. Even without any of the droning squeezebox ballads that accounted for Low Estate's few weak spots, it somehow lacks the momentum and fury that made that album such an engaging listen. Whereas Low Estate could be cleanly divided between the upbeat back porch sing-alongs, rambunctious quasi-cowpunk bursts, and the aforementioned dirges, Secret South almost wholly falls into a middle ground with less consistent results. The one mode that is most often in stock here is the slow burn, patiently building but never accelerating past a frustrating mid-tempo. Sometimes it works, as with the teasingly incomplete crescendos of ""Poor Mouth."" But elsewhere, the formula borders on unbearable, best evidenced by the overwrought wailing of ""Cinder Alley."" With Edwards' songwriting in a bit of a slump here, it's not surprising that the album's most enjoyable moments are covers. The traditional ""Wayfaring Stranger"" suits him as well as any of his originals, with a tinny vocal tone giving the song an honest, folksy rendering. Even better is ""Nobody 'Cept You,"" a gorgeous vow of dedication from Bob Dylan's Bootleg Series. And even if the lyrics aren't his, the song still shows Edwards in rare form, laying aside his usual rhetoric for earthly love and naked sincerity. Ultimately, Secret South shows Sixteen Horsepower nailing their trademarks perhaps too well. With no ironic crutch or overtly modern traits (aside from a vaguely post-grunge sensibility), there's little to save them from niche, or worse, caricature. For the most part, they fend off these concerns with material that demands to be judged on its own merits. But let's face it, ""Praying Arm Lane"" resembles the theme from ""Rawhide"" just a little too closely to be taken seriously. Nonetheless, Sixteen Horsepower remains a breath of fresh air for those of us who aren't afraid of a little twang but would rather stay away from Nashville and No Depression.","I can't tell you how many times I've listened as someone boasted their eclectic tastes and love for ...

The Museum of Imaginary Animals,Pram,by: S. Murray,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a1115e6ef959693200e1/1:1/w_160/00d5c23c.gif,2000-09-12 05:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6445-the-museum-of-imaginary-animals/,MergeMerge,"As a child, I often found myself terrified of effigies in the dark. I wasn't afraid of the dark itself, it's just that I couldn't bear having the lights turned out and witnessing an ominous residual glow imbue my stuffed animals with a sinister impression of life. I got rid of my E.T. poster because it looked absolutely horrific in the moonlight. It seems as though Pram's entire recorded career has focused on this childhood fear, characterized mainly by an otherworldly eclecticism in approach and an alien tentativeness in execution. And Pram's ballooning number of band members has articulated their work's quirky effervescence over the years. The opener on this, their fifth album, is titled ""The Owl Service"" after a children's horror story by Alan Garner. Pram courts the actively uncanny with a delicate balance of childlike irreverence and apprehension. The Museum of Imaginary Animals frames Rosie Cuckston's schoolgirl vocals within an intricately homespun dream jazz symphony. Less sparse than their previous releases, the flute, clarinet, and trumpet contributions are more pronounced, and the songs are stylistically denser. ""The Owl Service"" is almost funky in its avant-jazz-pop amblings, while ""Bewitched"" bludgeons the conventional pop song, blossoming into a shadowy anti-anthem while Cuckston subversively intones: ""From certain corners where I used to hide/ I could act as a satellite spying on my own life/ Decode the message in the space between the words."" The greater instrumental dexterity runs the risk of overwhelming Cuckston's Moe Tucker-by-way-of-Britain vocal capacity, but her voice remains Pram's secret weapon. In the swoops of her delivery, and her cracked straining for high notes, one finds a detached expression of the vaguely fascinated in the face of the surreal. One of the first Too Pure signings, Pram was, in many respects, the first Broadcast, offering a distinct take on the French-pop core manifest in early Stereolab. Both Pram and Broadcast hail from Birmingham, and the drummer on this album even drummed for an earlier incarnation of Broadcast. But what distinguishes the two is that Pram continues to showcase the foggy insular quality of their work while Broadcast has buffed its approach to a glossily synthetic sheen. Pram remains caught up in a loosely crafted fairy tale of its own making, a musical Brother's Grimm hell-bent on examining the puzzlebox of a child's dark imagination.","As a child, I often found myself terrified of effigies in the dark.

Sakura,Susumu Yokota,by: Mark Richardson,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ab02c0084474cd0c12c2/1:1/w_160/29e18292.gif,2000-09-11 06:01:40,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8874-sakura/,LeafLeaf,"Though they're working in dramatically different styles, I think it's safe to say that artists like Nobukazu Takemura, Aki Tsuyuko, Neina and Susumu Yokota share a sensibility. Each is capable of crafting subtle music that's not afraid to be warm and pretty, but they shade the tender melodies and hints of violence and loss. With now-familiar techniques like malfunctioning technology (Neina's Oval-style glitch is the sound of the digital world colliding with nature) and clipped vocal fragments (Takemura's ""Kepler"" traps Tsuyuko's innocent voice inside a machine), the pretty music becomes something more complex. Susumu Yokota made his name in Japan as a House DJ and producer, and this functional background could explain why his ambient music is the most outwardly ""pleasant"" of the artists mentioned above. Sakura is his latest home-listening entry, a placid display of slow, careful movement with a few unexpected twists. Much of this album features Yokota's dreamy, processed guitar as a distinctive sound tool. On the lush, cascading ""Saku"" and ""Tobiume"" he drowns the electric strings in reverb, and the plucked melodies are hard to trace to their source. The faint guitar melodies work well against the synthetic drones, offering a subtly percussive counterpoint to the electronic tapestry. On ""Genshi,"" Yokota pulls out his this-old-House tools, wielding a gentle, steady kickdrum and shimmering high-hat to push along a gurgling guitar pattern reminiscent of Manual Göttsching. Adding further variation to the six-string texture, ""Hagoromo"" loops an acoustic guitar pattern to hypnotic effect. Despite its use in the above tracks, this is by no means a ""guitar album,"" not even in the Fripp & Eno sense of the word. Each of the elements, the guitars, the occasional beats, the vocal samples (heartbreaking on ""Azukiio No Kaori,"" which reminds me of Nobukazu Takemura's amazing remix of ""Proverb"" on Reich Remixed) and the flowing synthesizers, are used to further the dreamy, contemplative mood. There are a few missteps, most notable the oddly jazzy ""Naminote,"" which seems to strive for Amon Tobin territory but mucks up the flow of the album considerably. Still, this is a worthy artifact from what seems to be an incredibly fertile scene.","""Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?"" has been a huge hit in more than thirty\n\ countries, but it failed ...

All Most Heaven EP,Rian MurphyWill Oldham,by: Matt LeMay,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c41613d197565213be96/1:1/w_160/28e4d508.gif,2000-09-05 05:00:09,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5512-all-most-heaven-ep/,Drag City,"Back in the days when I rabidly followed basketball, the yearly NBA all-star game stood out as a particular pet peeve. Granted, it was a chance to see the game's finest playing their best. But, as an idealistic young fan, I couldn't get over the fact that it didn't really matter. I couldn't bear to see players who spent the rest of the year cursing and beating the shit out of each other playing on the same team. Despite a few coast-related rivalries, the game was really just a trap for fans and their money. At first, All Most Heaven struck me as not too different from the all-star game. The credits gracing the back of the record are a who's-who of indie recording artists, including Jim O'Rourke, Bill Callahan, Archer Prewitt, David Grubbs, ""recorder"" Steve Albini and, of course, Will Oldham. So how did Chestnut Station frontman Rian Murphy manage to recruit all these illustrious names for assistance on his record, including the notoriously feuding Grubbs and O'Rourke? Well, not only is Murphy a big shot at Drag City Records, but he's also lent his production talents to artists like Edith Frost (who also appears on this record), the Silver Jews, and Palace Music. Plus, this was recorded in Chicago, a place known for its artist collaborations. It's a good thing, too, because it's the presence of Murphy's stellar collaborators that truly makes the four-song All Most Heaven a relatively tasty morsel. Jim O'Rourke's instrumental arrangements are both lush and refreshing, augmented no doubt by the amazing pool of players O'Rourke had to choose from. Indeed, every instrument here is played and arranged almost perfectly. All Most Heaven's few serious flaws lie not in instrumentation or production, but rather in a few songwriting missteps that prevent the record from approaching the sum of its contributors. Within the first few seconds of ""Fall Again,"" a duet between Oldham and Bill Callahan, Oldham's presence is made quite clear by the very Oldham-ish piano arrangement, not to mention his vocals. And while the song may bear quite a striking resemblance to an Oldham solo tune, it lacks that inexplicable quality that makes him one of the great songwriters of the moment. Rarely does the song, or any of All Most Heaven, hit a sour note, but it somehow lacks the significance and emotion of Oldham's work. Of course, there's a good possibility that my listening has been slanted by the way Oldham's voice sounds on this record. In the past, the shaky, warbling tones of Oldham's voice have given him a unique personality. And at a few points, such as on the chorus of ""Song of Most,"" this holds true. Unfortunately, his voice seems to be lacking both the relative tonality and the emotion found on previous works. But if All Most Heaven doesn't get credit for its vocals, it certainly does for its lyrics. While I initially thought that Oldham was just singing incoherently, a quick glance at the album's liner notes revealed that the line, ""Ess for da beda/ Basted ada deedle eye/ For the way to be hated/ Is abated audobye,"" is written exactly as spoken. With so many painfully self-aware lyrics being penned these days, guttural sounds such as this are, if nothing else, a welcome change. So perhaps my initial assessment of All Most Heaven was wrong. Had this truly been an all-star record, it would have been marketed as such. As it stands, All Most Heaven marks a very shrewd move by Rian Murphy-- with a little help from his friends, he and Will Oldham have managed to turn a batch of four merely average songs into an above-average record.","Back in the days when I rabidly followed basketball, the yearly NBA all-star game stood out as a particular pet ...

A Spectrum of Infinite Scale,Man or Astro-Man?,by: Ryan Schreiber,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Founder</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c37f13d197565213bd45/1:1/w_160/efdf0838.gif,2000-09-05 05:00:08,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5060-a-spectrum-of-infinite-scale/,Touch and GoTouch and Go,"""Last I heard from starfleet command, the new Man or Astro-Man album, Experiment Zero, is to be released on April 16, 1996 A.D. By clicking on the astronaut you can warp to my official Experiment Zero Countdown Page. Thank me later.""
--Surflyer's Astro Site It says something about Man or Astro-Man that, of the seven fan pages listed on the band's official website, three of them no longer exist, and three of them haven't updated since 1996. There's a reason for this. The band released the pinnacle album of their career, Experiment Zero, that year. After that, it seemed to become more about the packaging than the actual music contained within. Star Crunch left the band, as did Dr. Delecto, who was replaced by Dexter X, who has also since departed. Realizing that their members were as interchangeable as Duplo bricks, the remaining members of Man or Astro-Man launched their Clone Project Alpha Phase One Tour. The concept was to send out three ""clone"" bands on separate tours to play the band's music for them. While this gesture would be completely ineffective for any other band, Man or Astro-Man understood that it didn't take a genius to replicate their instrumental surf-rock sound verbatim. Over the next few years, Man or Astro-Man released 1997's forgettable Made from Technetium and 1999's utterly disposable EEVIAC: Operational Index & Reference Guide. Of course, that hasn't stopped them from releasing another. No, they're not letting their nine other seemingly identical full-lengths slow them down. They won't be undersold! But, hey, if nothing else, you have to give them credit for keeping at it. How many other surf-styled instrumental bands have lasted eight years? With two original members (Coco the Electronic Monkey Wizard, Birdstuff) and two surrogate guitarists (Trace Reading, Blazar the Probe Handler) intact, Man or Astro-Man advanced to the nearest studio to record A Spectrum of Infinite Scale. Rarely has there been an album so seemingly mistitled; the spectrum of this band's sound has, until now, had all the range of a casually tossed sheet of paper. But something's changed here. Though the band still sticks faithfully to their trademark sci-fi surf gimmick, they've omitted the annoying science film samples, and actually show, for the first time in years, traces of creativity. A Spectrum of Infinite Scale integrates abrupt time changes, sudden halts, and actual memorable melodies. In fact, the mutation is so dramatic that it's safe to say no one has ever made surf-rock like this in the history of music. Granted, it's still surf-rock, but now it comes with unexpected twists and turns, and moments of genuine inspiration. When A Spectrum of Infinite Scale opens with a crescendoing electronic gong and a woofer-shattering snare/cymbal combo, followed by a synthesized orchestra submerged in reverb and a mammoth drum sound-- all underscored by subtle, menacing effects-- it's immediately apparent that this is anything but the same record they've made a million times since 1993. The band's new incorporation of faux-ambient electronic textures suggest they've grown tired of their scratchy Ventures LPs and now search for new territory to conquer. And considering the sheer sonic wallop this album packs, they've found it in post-punk instrumental ensembles like Trans Am and Pittsburgh rockers Don Caballero. Even their song titles reflect a hazy image of Don Cab, with such numbers as ""Curious Constructs of Stem-Like Devices Which Now Prepare Themselves to Be Thought of as Fingers,"" ""Many Pieces of Large Fuzzy Mammals Gathered Together at a Rave and Schmoozing with a Brick,"" and the possibly cocaine-inspired title, ""Multi-Variational Stimuli of Sub-Turgid Foci Covering Cross Evaluate Techniques for Cognitive Analysis of Hypersignificant Graph Peaks Following Those Intersubjective Modules Having Biodegradable Seepage."" Particularly of note is ""Within One Universe There are Millions,"" easily one of the best tracks of the band's repertoire. In just under three minutes, it achieves Astro-perfection with head-scrambling feedback, a dizzying stop/start introduction, a killer chord progression, and Macintosh vocals. The squelching ""Spectrograph Reading of the Varying Phantom Frequencies of Chronic, Incurable Tinnitus"" barrels out of even the tiniest speakers like a discharged bullet. And ""A Simple Text File"" is the song you knew the future would eventually produce-- an ASCII text file written as music for a dot-matrix printer. Naturally, the sound of an ancient Apple Imagewriter II in action doesn't exactly make for a symphonic masterpiece, but the amount of time that went into making this decrepit device sing, and Albini's beautiful mic job are, at the very least, commendable. Of course, in the end, this is still surf-rock, albeit a very unusual hybrid. But it's nice to know that after all this time, Man or Astro-Man are finally trying to sound original and, perhaps most surprisingly of all, succeeding.","""Last I heard from starfleet command, the new Man or Astro-Man album, Experiment Zero, is to be released on April ...

Such is the question posed by this edition in the series of at-home-with-[insert name of flavor of the month dance act] compilations, Back to Mine. Previously, Danny Tenaglia rifled through his dustier boxes and tempted us with nothing too revelatory. Faithless, in the most recent installment, reveal that they listen to little else but Faithless tracks and the band members' solo efforts. But even before you press play on your hi-fi-- with one glance at the Chardonnay-quaffing track listing-- you'll yawn, collapse, and curse yourself for shelling out beer money for such meager slurry. Just how self-absorbed can Tom Findlay and Andy Cato be that they start with their own poo-stik acoustic rework of A Tribe Called Quest's ""Description of a Fool?"" Granted, they're not as solipsistic as Faithless, but you'd be hard-pressed not to agree that the two have long since begun to believe all the hype about their band. From then on, all you have to do is imagine the least offensive, least un-Groove Armada-ish records you could hear if you were, against all the odds, invited back to their pad. By the way, does this compilation really imply that Findlay and Cato live together, like Bert and Ernie? Hmm... So it is with no astonishment that track #2 is a hugely stringed Barry White number (""Playing Your Game, Baby""), trendily followed by some Mancunian hip-hop courtesy of Grand Central Records. While I'm thrilled to hear BBG's summery ""Snappiness,"" I can't say the same for Mica Paris' ""I Should've Known Better."" Rather than moving out of (or getting off) their tight little box and spinning some psychedelic nuggets or a snippet of a Richard Strauss tone poem, the lads persist in flying their faker flag higher and higher. Al Green's less than shamanic take on ""Relight My Fire"" is as forgettable as the woefully Ibizan dreck that constitutes Schmoov's ""Destination (Beachtowel Remix)."" So I'm disappointed-- what did I have a right to expect? Well, seeing as how one of these guys is a fairly accomplished trombonist, I would have liked to hear at least a little Curtis Fuller, J.J. Johnson, or Kai Winding-- 'bone players with more soul than most of the copyist slags compiled here. But I'm being naïve. Back to Mine: Groove Armada is just another foot soldier in the corporate army dedicated to removing all that's incendiary and revolutionary about modern music.

Bringing Home the Last Great Strike,Pinetop Seven,by: Brent S. Sirota,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a080ea9e61561daa45a0/1:1/w_160/42dbc2a4.gif,2000-09-05 05:00:06,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6305-bringing-home-the-last-great-strike/,AtavisticTruckstop,"In the museums of the distant future, America will be reduced to an animatronic Wild West saloon, with the Pinetop Seven's Bringing Home the Last Great Strike stuck on a perpetual loop. We'll be nothing but a kickline, a poker game, and a roomful of hard luck stories. Everything will be dusty. The anachronisms will be lost on our descendents. We'll have been an empire of cowboys. It's not such a bad obituary. Bringing Home the Last Great Strike would definitely not count as insurgent country; there isn't a punk bone in its body. It's an incredible line-up of bruised and tired music where folk, bluegrass, Louisville post-rock, Eastern music and electronics all drink side by side. As pristine and complex as the arrangements sound, the album's been kicked around and beaten up. Brimming with unglamorous stories of circus freaks, drifters, stranglers, ghosts, and drunks, Pinetop Seven have crafted a rich, melancholy work of music for the unemployable. And vocalist/lyricist/multi-instrumentalist Darren Richard seems to play barkeep to the whole lot of them, telling their stories as if he'd eavesdropped on them, sometimes even assuming the voice of their own confessionals. The record store guy warned me about the vocals: too white, too nasally, too haunted, he said. But in truth, I've come to adore them; a dire, warbling falsetto somewhere between Jeff Magnum, Jeff Buckley and Jeremy Enigk. The bizarre instrumentation and languid arrangements lend the music an almost timeless quality, drawing you in while the searching vocals repel. You may come to love them as I have but many will be discouraged. After all, they're quite white, nasally, and irremediably haunted. Fair warning, in any case. The introductory fanfare, ""As the Mutiny Sleeps,"" is a somber homage to the Band's ""Theme from the Last Waltz,"" twittering with bells and glockenspiel while a muted trumpet whimpers and dour clarinet calls the album's plodding approach. ""On the Last Ride In"" is a lazy, twanging tale of departure. The drifter's regret is a familiar theme, but Richard's evocative lyrics lend color and depth to the sketch: ""From under the clouds/ His father's face/ Promising rain, rain, rain/ And all sides came crashing down."" One of the more traditionally instrumented tracks on The Last Great Strike, the acoustic strum melds with the soft Fender Rhodes, upright bass and distant violin. ""An empty trunk no longer full of all that trust,"" Darren intones as the music recedes. ""A Black Eye to Be Proud Of"" is one of the record's standouts; emerging from electronic loops, fat vaudeville piano stomps out the melody. Darren Richard assumes the first-person narrative of a young man who's fallen in love with a whore: ""But Leah, I think that could change/ I've got money for you to teach me."" The narrator is a boy compared to the brothel's other clientele: ""My own black eye to be proud of never came/ I'm a coward still the same/ Skinny arms and watery eyes."" The Pinetop Seven have cited director Jim Jarmusch as an influence, and in ""Black Eye,"" that influence becomes apparent, rewriting the conventions of the unrequited love song with humor and subtle sadness. ""Ten Thousand to Carlisle Came"" opens with an alarum of Middle Eastern horns and proceeds into a profoundly disturbing country-western ballad about a deaf-mute girl that's become a roadside attraction: ""To spite us in car loads/ They came to see this sadness displayed."" The song's final verse is particularly horrific, but sung with the slight distance of the greatest storytellers: ""Cut the lights off/ Pull the car close/ Let the gasoline run/ Beneath the locked door/ Throw the match down/ Let her sleep."" ""At His Kitchen Table"" executes a rustbelt tribute to Slint's ""Breadcrumb Trail""; a dead, insistent guitar-lick, the blank spoken-word narrative. Vibes punctuate the monologue as a maelstrom of howling electronics blows beneath. The bored observational candor is pure Brian McMahan as Richard intones: ""A sound outside finally caught his attention and he looked out the window across the street to where a young mother was yelling. She was yelling at her little boy who had found a dead bird and brought it into the house."" The narrative goes exactly nowhere. Wheezing Keen-O-Tone keyboards and skillet percussions mark the final song with a vocal track, ""A Friend to the Minnesota Strangler,"" a sketch of the relationship between a fugitive serial killer and the bird he ""kept in a hat box by his bed."" Richard plucks the nylon guitar strings like plucking on the nerves themselves in pointed, rhythmic pops. ""The Minnesota Strangler"" fades into the final track, ""Buried in St. Cloud,"" a funereal procession of bass clarinet, flugelhorn, accordion and cello winding all stories down to their inevitable conclusions. Bringing Home the Last Great Strike is unique in trafficking so liberally in human misery without ever approaching angst. Richard deftly avoids every inclination to wallow in his characters' misfortunes as a cipher for his own, while also never deriving the kind of morbid thrill in the rustic bizarre like a certain sister-/mountain-fucking Kentuckian whose music is often strikingly parallel. The Last Great Strike is a jukebox anthology of American unhappiness. All its nostalgia seems directed toward a more miserable time. This, in the end, seems to be the West worth remembering.","In the museums of the distant future, America will be reduced to an animatronic Wild West saloon, with the Pinetop ...

Com Plex,The Helio Sequence,by: Camilo Arturo Leslie,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c09feb335119a49ed40a/1:1/w_160/feb652be.gif,2000-09-05 05:00:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3804-com-plex/,Cavity SearchCavity Search,"There's a whole lot to be said for a person possessing the wisdom to seek an outside opinion. ""An attorney who acts as his own defense,"" goes the old saying, ""has a fool for a client."" The same goes for bands. Generally speaking, it's not such a hot idea for a group-- especially a young group still feeling out a sonic identity and songwriting style-- to produce its own album. Enter the producer. Ah, yes, the producer, that enigmatic specter behind the crisp boom-boom-tap, the wicked guitar skronk, and the buttery-smooth fade-out. The producer is usually conceptualized as either the antagonist attempting to impose his serpentine Svengali will on the naïve genius of the hapless band members, or as a fix-all mercenary commissioned to make wine from water. But though these scenarios clearly do occur from time to time, independent bands generally choose someone that sees their grand vision. The idea, of course, is that the producer, with the band's best interests in mind, will set them on the path towards self-realization and help them to exhaust their potential. This is a good thing. Com Plex is not such a good thing, though, in fairness, it isn't quite terrible. It aptly showcases Benjamin Weikel and Brandon Summer's respectable songwriting skills, though it's more an exhibition of potential than something you'd want to rush out and buy. Sadly, like the self-advocating lawyer, it's an ambitious performance doomed from the start by a lack of perspective. The opening track, ""Stracenska 612,"" sets the bar a little too high for the eight songs that follow. Raspy guitar feedback, clean, reverbed guitar lines, suggestive, ghostly whispering, and beautiful keyboard sequences braid into one another, making for a truly blissful six minutes. What follows begins to steer things toward the recipe for disaster spelled out in the Helio Sequence's press release: ""the band is a unique blend of Beatles-esque melodies crossed with My Bloody Valentine's wall of sound noise layering."" Hmm. Uh, sure. Equal parts. Lennon/McCartney and Loveless. Right. Whatever Helio Sequence is, timid they're not. ""Just Mary Jane (Calypso)"" is the first of many embarrassing moments on Com Plex, wherein the boys reveal how much they long to be the Beatles. And at times, it can be almost endearing to hear the boys incorporate lyrics like, ""Lucy's lost diamonds."" Okay, that's a lie. Musically, though, they're still on solid ground. Until song three. ""Transistor Radio"" mixes a hackneyed attempt at Revolver-era Beatles with modern British psychedelia. To his credit, Brandon Summer's voice sounds as close to John Lennon's as could be hoped for from a guy from Beaverton, Portland. ""My Heart,"" on the other hand, is far more successful. Beatles-esque flourishes (well...) are filtered through that liquid, delay-heavy production they likened to My Bloody Valentine. But ""Sassafras"" attempts the same with shoddier results, coming off like some Bono-esque hybrid of Duran Duran and the Swirlies. Still, it's not a bad place for these guys to start-- they'll come around. Com Plex's crowning moment comes two tracks later when the Helio Sequence lean heavily on the stretchy membrane of Unnecessary with a cover of an old classic by-- take a guess, go on-- yes, the Beatles! ""Tomorrow Never Knows,"" to be specific. Though comparably as vital to the world as the Egg-Wave or unsold Power Rangers merchandise, I suppose they do a fair enough job of it. But, again, why? ""Big Jet Sky"" is the second-to-last track and a final chance for the boys to play a breathtaking round of ""how sincere can we be before it becomes self-parody, and how self-parodic can we be until it comes around to sincerity again?"" Take in a deep breath, and then these lines: ""Now is the time to make up your mind/ Now is the time to break these ties/ Now is the time to shut things down/ Now is the time to shut things down."" Ringo! Ringo, wake up! The finale, ""Demographics,"" is Com Plex's second best track after the opener, situating their best material like bookends. And you know what? These guys can actually write a nice tune when they put forth the effort. Their production skills are pretty impressive, too, considering they recorded this album by night, in the one-room music store at which they were employed. Com Plex's two standout cuts are beautiful, heavily electronic, space-pop, which will hopefully be the focus of future releases. Assuming they bury their Beatles record next time out, I'll be the first in line to hear what they've come up with.","There's a whole lot to be said for a person possessing the wisdom to seek an\n\ outside opinion ...

Heartbreaker,Ryan Adams,by: Steven Byrd,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/59299ffeea9e61561daa4478/1:1/w_160/30151f8d.jpg,2000-09-05 05:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/36-heartbreaker/,Bloodshot,"Ryan Adams, part-time solo musician, full-time frontman of indie-country band Whiskeytown, is from North Carolina. As chance has it, I happen to be from North Carolina, too. Adams hails from a city you've probably never heard of, a little pit-stop on the way to the beach called Jacksonville. I've lived most of my life in a tin-shack of a town called Lumberton, only two hours from Jacksonville by highway. Both towns are small geographical afterthoughts, and about as ""southern"" as any place you're likely to find in modern-day America. You have to understand, ""southern"" no longer means cotton fields, plantations and beautiful belles waiting to escort you to Big Daddy's formal ball. Still, despite all the changes history has brought us, three things remain true about the south: In the south, the good music is like sunshine-- you just can't escape it. This is the place Ryan Adams and I both call home-- this boring, but melodic, pit of despair. So is it any wonder that Adams, a young man of only 27 years, is able to craft an album as stark and as enjoyably bleak as Heartbreaker? Singing in a voice that's just filthy with despair, Adams delivers his first solo album with the practiced swagger and genuine hurt of a veteran country crooner. A startling 15-song masterpiece, Heartbreaker is a drinker's album, an ode to sadness that deals exclusively with all the dark and dirty corners of the human heart. It's music written in the language of loneliness, depression, and, above all, heartbreak, in all its varied forms. And it makes perfect sense that this should be Adams' first solo album, as-- aside from a couple of notable collaborations-- the material here is far too personal and focused to have been produced by anything but one man with one soul. Heartbreaker shows Ryan Adams sweeping all of the clichés of mass- produced, ""new country"" under the rug and tapping into everything that makes genuine country music unique and beautiful: raw emotion, deep groove and clever storytelling. There are no simple, melodramatic, commercial-ready ballads here; the music is too deeply rooted in old-school country music, folk-rock songs and bluegrass jams to produce anything that predictable. With that musical philosophy firmly in place, it stands to reason that each track on the album is a gem, showcasing Adams' considerable songwriting ability and a way with words that most musicians would sell their spines to possess. The record begins with the misleadingly upbeat ""To Be Young (Is to Be Sad, Is to Be High),"" a swinging bluegrass number that wouldn't sound out of place in a honky-tonk. But Adams gets to the business of bringing us down soon enough. When Adams sings, ""I just want to die without you,"" on ""Call Me on Your Way Back Home,"" orphans run out into the street and weep. For ""Damn, Sam (I Love a Woman That Rains),"" Adams calls on the patron saints of sparse folk music and lyrical tomfoolery while channeling the troubadour vocals of early Bob Dylan to produce one of Heartbreaker's lighter, but better, tracks. Still, even this stylistic similarity is superficial, as the blood- and-guts of the song are all his own. Adams continues his winning streak by making great use of a rare cameo by country-rock legend Emmylou Harris on ""Oh My Sweet Carolina,"" as Harris' trademark falsetto blends beautifully with Adams' own rich vocals for a simple, affecting song about one man's longing to return home. ""Come Pick Me Up,"" a track about a man struggling with a bad relationship and pining for his cheating girlfriend weighs in as the album's most affecting moment. Gluing crushing lyrics to undeniably catchy drum riffs, greasy guitar work and soulful harmonica playing, the song is five minutes and thirteen seconds of damn near perfect music. There's nothing terribly complex or tricky about Heartbreaker. In fact, it's probably one of the simplest, most straightforward albums you'll hear all year. But this album wasn't written to be complex. It isn't electronica designed to tickle your cerebral cortex. It isn't music to figure out. It's music to feel to. It's music to drink alone to. And it's sadder than witnessing your grandmother's burial. Heartbreaker is the soundtrack to the last ten minutes of any relationship you've ever watched crumble before your eyes. It's music for the ruined romantic in all of us. Usually, that little romantic simply sits quietly, tearfully watching everything disappear without so much as a single complaint. But on Heartbreaker, Ryan Adams has not only convinced that voice to speak, he's taught it to sing. The result is an album of astonishing musical proficiency, complete honesty and severe beauty.","Ryan Adams, part-time solo musician, full-time frontman of indie-country\n\ band Whiskeytown, is from North Carolina.

Hyacinths and Thistles,The 6ths,by: Matt LeMay,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a43a5e6ef9596932080f/1:1/w_160/1caffacd.gif,2000-09-05 05:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7214-hyacinths-and-thistles/,MergeMerge,"How do you follow up a critically acclaimed album? Well, that all depends. If you're Thom Yorke, you shatter expectations by burning the rulebook and creating something completely unique and groundbreaking. If you're Kevin Shields, you become a fucking hermit. And, apparently, if you're Stephin Merritt, you don't. Since the release of 1999's critic's darling, 69 Love Songs, Merritt has revived two of his side projects-- the 6ths and Future Bible Heroes-- thus, providing him with the opportunity to release an abundance of material without actually facing the dreaded follow-up to his three-disc box. While Future Bible Heroes provided Merritt with a songwriting collaborator, the 6ths consists of a motley crew of guest vocalists covering a batch of all-new Merritt tunes. And, like 1995's Wasps' Nest, Hyacinths and Thistles seems to be in keeping with Merritt's musical style du jour. Whereas Wasps' Nest contained brilliant synth-pop gems much in keeping with The Charm of the Highway Strip's better tracks, Hyacinths and Thistles contains more organic material reminiscent of 69 Love Songs, along with the occasional synth-driven throwback. But the biggest difference between the two 6ths records is obvious: Wasps' Nest allowed some of indie rock's finest vocalists to lend their talents to a grade-a batch of Merritt tunes; Hyacinths and Thistles pairs remarkably average Merritt songs with largely substandard vocalists. The record kicks off with ""As You Turn to Go,"" a run-of-the-mill, baroque Merritt ballad, with fellow synth-pop purveyor Momus providing vocals. Aside from the addition of a British accent and a few added notes in the upper register, Momus and Merritt are virtually indistinguishable from one another. But like Puffy Combs attempting the resurrection of ""Kashmir"" with Jimmy Page on guitar, it's a long way off from the real thing. But while ""As You Turn to Go"" is far from brilliant, the worst of Hyacinths and Thistles is about as much fun as a glass shard enema administered by a spastic mental patient. Melanie's rendition of ""I've Got New York"" is the sound of an alcoholic grandmother picking warts off her feet. As her voice twists and grates, you can't help but wonder what exactly Merritt was thinking when he asked for her ""help"" with his record. Why choose a 1970s flash-in-the-pan over Low's Mimi Parker, Stereolab's Laetitia Sadier or Movietone's Rachel Brook? Jesus, even Ana Voog would be better suited! Bob Mould offers up another awkward moment on the ballad, ""He Didn't,"" a song that fits Mould about as well as leopard-print spandex. Admittedly, his discomfort is somewhat endearing for a few brief moments, but it's not the kind of thing that makes for repeated listens. But the album's nadir comes with the album's mind-numbing closer, ""Oahu,"" which ends with a synthesizer looping the same few bars for nearly 10 minutes. But despite its glaring flaws (Gary Numan among them), Hyacinths and Thistles is still graced by the inherent decency of Stephin Merritt's songwriting. His witty take on life and love, while dampened by the lack of his trademark delivery, is still present. Besides, there are only so many side projects Merritt can toss off before the next true Magnetic Fields record is released. Maybe after one more Gothic Archies album, Merritt's fans will finally get what they deserve.","How do you follow up a critically acclaimed album? Well, that all depends.

Private Suit,Bettie Serveert,by: Kristin Sage Rockermann,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a28aea9e61561daa4a83/1:1/w_160/e3a48186.gif,2000-09-05 05:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/673-private-suit/,ParasolParasol,"Let me get this out of the way before things get too awkward. In spite of it all, I like Bettie Serveert. When I say ""it all,"" I'm referring to the banal rock drums, the overused pop hooks, and the cute, ""light,"" lyrics that are almost too appropriately executed by a charming Dutch tomboy vocalist. Carol Van Dijk's (no, her name isn't Bettie) appeal has always been her ability to load her vocals with palatable sentiment. They ooze with earnest spunk, comfortably shallow yearning, and a naïve idealism rarely present in American rock n' roll-- complete with a sincerity that might be harder to stomach coming from this side of the Atlantic. I can't explain why this nostalgic pop cocktail doesn't make me puke. In fact, Bettie Serveert usually makes me smile. I'm convinced that the whole ""Dutch"" thing is a cover to stave off questions. They claim that their first three albums were imported from the Netherlands by Matador. But don't be fooled; Bettie Serveert were shipped in from one of those daydreams where everything is okay. In this daydream-- or rather ""the Netherlands""-- rock bands still have fun playing simple songs that tell modest stories. Mentions of the Alesis SR16 or Roland 808 meet quizzical faces as the people here have only heard of real drums. And the bands are capable of writing songs with jangle-guitar hooks sticky enough to linger after the snap-back into the land of taxes, face-lifts, and MTV. Every once in a while, that's enough. But most of the time, I'd rather invest my money and time in bands producing more creative and challenging material. To be blunt, one is enough. When it comes to the Serveert Catalog, the completist plays the fool, and this one has just confessed her sins so that others can learn from her dirty example. If you're going to pick one, put your money down on the now classic 1992 debut, Palomine. From the dreamy questions posed in the title track to the perfectly heart-warming head-bobber, ""Tom Boy,"" Palomine is considerably stronger than Lamprey or Dust Bunnies, which are stylistically similar, yet lacks the ""kid sister you never had in a jewel-box"" quality. However, Private Suit shows the band taking some risks. They continue to write catchy and cute guitar rock songs, but also experiment with backing vocals and strings, a noble ambition that raises the bar higher than ""the little band that could"" is able to reach. Satisfied is a dark track with lyrics like, ""Callous on the soul/ There's a tale untold/ About how you spend your life/ In a place where no one goes."" Just when it becomes clear that Bettie Serveert are treading on territory best left to... well, anyone else, the song laughably breaks down when it ""breaks it down"" into a funky counterpoint that sounds exactly like part of the Lovin' Spoonful's ""Summer in the City."" The title track wears a serious hat, too; with lyrics like, ""We're half seas over/ In a nostalgic mood.../ But on top of everything, it sounds absurd/ That I tried to fit my life into a word/ And it still turned out the same."" For a brief moment, the resigned tone of the lyrics marks a reflexive maturity, but then the song lapses into depressing nostalgia as the chords-- almost a decade later-- retrace those of Palomine. The tired progressions don't know any other way, yet they must be aware of their own shame as they're loosely disguised with fluttering strings and slightly different timing. ""White Tales"" unfortunately sounds ""very Natalie Merchant."" As in, ""Now why can't we stay here for a why-ee-eye-ee-eye-ee-ile/ Why-ee-eye-ee-eye-ee-ile,"" and later, ""I never felt this way before-ee-or-ee-ore."" So, the self-aware nostalgia for naïve American rock songs has evolved into a naïve nostalgia for marketing-savvy American trash, starting with Natalie Merchant and moving on to the last dance craze you want your daydreams or little sisters to take part in: ""Don't just stand there, let's get to it
Strike a pose, there's nothing to it
Vogue, vogue"" Keep the style and pacing, but replace the lyrics of Madonna's cultural phenomena with ""Forget about your weakness/ Forget about your pride/ Everybody is sane on the innocent side,"" and you have the conclusion of ""Healer,"" Private Suit's finale. I'm doing that modified funky- chicken dance to it right now and crying. Listening to this album is so far from that innocent guitar-rock daydream-- the one that made me like Bettie Serveert in the first place. But I guess that's what happens to a band that refuses to wake up. Speaking of which, Bettie Serveert open for Counting Crows and Live this October.","Let me get this out of the way before things get too awkward. In spite of\n\ it all, I ...

Stalled Parade,Eleventh Dream Day,by: Michael Sandlin,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc3e5e6ef95969322dd9/1:1/w_160/59b7cd71.gif,2000-09-05 05:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2741-stalled-parade/,Thrill JockeyThrill Jockey,"Four years ago, I bore witness to the musical mismatch of the century: Eleventh Dream Day opening for Thrill Jockey label mates Tortoise. All the look-alike post-rock Tortoise followers, sporting the fluorescent rave garb and matching backpacks seemed genuinely flummoxed by the band. As these grizzled, perennially underrated veterans roared through an uptempo rocker, frontman Rick Rizzo laid into his guitar strings for an eyebrow-singeing solo. My girlfriend at the time, senses previously dulled by hours of French techno, exclaimed, ""Wow, this is rock 'n' roll!"" Yes, for all those kids brainwashed by the hi-tech hijinx of late-'90s Pro Tools-manufactured and sonar blip-rock, Eleventh Dream Day must have sounded pretty anachronistic. After all, they're veritable alt-rock dinosaurs: along with Sonic Youth, and Yo La Tengo, Eleventh Dream Day are one of the precious few surviving bands from that mid-to-late '80s pre-grunge milieu of college-rock ruled by long-expired bands like the Godfathers, the Blasters, the Replacements and the Feelies. Hey, that's way back when Kurt Cobain was still a roadie. Yep, this was before youth culture embraced Tony Bennett, and before ""alternative"" became a media-whore buzzword to mean ""anything except Boyz II Men."" To his credit, math-whiz John McEntire does an agreeable production job on Stalled Parade. And granted, it would be kinda difficult to turn Eleventh Dream Day into Gastr del Sol or Tortoise. Luckily McEntire hasn't really disciplined Rizzo's disobedient guitar all that much. As on 1997's McEntire-produced Eighth, Eleventh Dream Day seems more concerned with texture and atmosphere than song form and melody. Which is fine, but as a result, they never quite rock with the kind of manic intensity they did on earlier efforts like 1990's Beet and 1991's Lived to Tell. Those early Atlantic recordings, as under-produced and shoddy as they often were, held some of the finest and most overlooked guitar moments of the decade. And featured, arguably, the best male/female vocal interplay in rock since X. The title track and opener, probably the album's high point, fades in with a dramatic flood tide of distortion engulfing the rhythm section. Its slow dirge-friendly pace sets off, with Bean and Rizzo's distanced, ghostly vocal tracks making for some eerie but beautiful synchronized singing: ""Save yourself,"" they urge, ""'Cause you might save me."" And possibly taking a cue from their more successful cousins, Yo La Tengo, Rizzo and company are beginning to write songs showcasing the blond chick singer with the angelic voice-- the one who also happens to be the drummer. In this case, it's Janet Beveridge Bean, sounding like a proper No Depression alterna-country gal on ""Valrico74."" She's paid her dues singing in Freakwater for the past few years, so she's certainly earned her place in front of the mic. ""Ice Storm"" and ""Interstate,"" more than anything else on Stalled Parade, are fairly standard Dream Day numbers. Rizzo's Neil Young-meets-Tom Verlaine guitar heroism is still in evidence, especially on ""In the Style Of..."" giving a sampling of the swarm of angry hornets he's capable of conjuring from his axe when inspired. McEntire himself adds some droning keyboard that fits in well enough, mainly because it's barely conspicuous much of the time. Although on Bean's near-perfect vocal number, the sparse, mid-tempo ""Bite the Hand,"" McEntire's keyboard sounds like a chainsaw slicing through sheet metal, and explodes into a needless frenzy towards the end. The Thrill Jockey-era Eleventh Dream Day has, unfortunately, lost some of its songwriting focus at the expense of tinkering with their overall sound-- mainly under the pretense of some sort of progress, I'm guessing. Yet, they still can't approach the awesome combination of squalling guitar rock tempered with pristine Pretenders-worthy melodies, and simply great songwriting on 1993's El Moodio. Eleventh Dream Day seem caught between Rizzo's irrepressible instincts for Live Rust-style garage-rock and a gradual shift to a more advanced, studio-processed sound. Creeping towards a slightly more experimental sonic philosophy has, I suppose, become necessary for a profitable existence amongst all the Tortoises and Trans Ams. This somewhat ""new"" direction is refreshing in some respects, and it may even help attract a larger, more diverse audience. Still, at times, ol' nostalgic fussbudget Grandpa Sandlin just wants 'em to rock out like them good ol' days.","Four years ago, I bore witness to the musical mismatch of the century: Eleventh Dream Day opening for Thrill Jockey ...

The Red Line,Trans Am,by: Mark Richardson,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a7fa9d034d5c69bf392a/1:1/w_160/23263509.gif,2000-09-05 05:00:00,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8136-the-red-line/,Thrill Jockey,"Two great things about Trans Am: first, though they draw heavily from the past, they have a wonderfully selective memory. They move through classic rock, prog and Krautrock and then hop directly to new wave, leapfrogging over the naive simplicity of punk. By virtue of the churches where they worship, Trans Am make the listener confront his or her own musical prejudices. To fully appreciate Trans Am, you must concede that there's nothing inherently terrible about Led Zeppelin or Thin Lizzy; all that's required is for you to hear this band in a way that either ignores or pokes fun at the horrible specter of classic rock radio. Which brings up the second great thing about Trans Am: their killer sense of humor, even more impressive considering 90% of their music is instrumental. The laughs stem from both the great song titles, and from a purely musical source: those quirky, unusual glimpses of misunderstood genres. As befits a band so devoted to pre-CD rock, Trans Am's albums have always been designed with vinyl in mind (each side of the Surrender to the Night LP artfully spiraled into a noisy locked groove). And though the 73-minute The Red Line is packaged as a single CD, it serves as Trans Am's first real double album. We're all tired of bloated CDs where one song is needlessly piled atop another simply to flesh out running time. But the brilliantly sequenced The Red Line is something different altogether. This is the double LP done right, with bizarre interludes, lengthy experiments and direct statements that serve as punctuation. I dare say The Red Line makes better use of its running time than any long album since the Olivia Tremor Control's Black Foliage. And like OTC's masterpiece, there seems to be an overriding concept here. I've heard that the title refers to a Metro line, and that the album is meant to be taken as a ""musical journey"" (to quote Larry Mullen Jr.) of sorts. If that's true, it's a bit of a circular trip-- one that shuttles you to the outskirts of rock's proving grounds and then drops you back home, dazed, confused and happy. The trip begins with a shimmering, train-like synth on the brief ""Let's Take the Fresh Step Together."" This leads to ""I Want It All,"" a crunching tune with Moog and vocoder that ranks among Trans Am's catchiest pop songs yet. And that's no mean feat considering the entire melody consists of two notes. ""Casual Friday"" is a short transition consisting of nothing but the sound of pounding, tribal drums (a recurring motif on The Red Line). Meanwhile, ""Polizei (Zu Spat)"" is dense, oscillating Krautrock that beats Add N to X at their own game. There's a slight dip in quality in the next few tracks, but ""For Now and Forever"" contains some pretty backwards guitar feedback that almost sounds like bagpipes. ""Play in the Summer"" is definitely the early album highlight, a punishing blast of rhythmic rock distantly related to Zeppelin's ""The Immigrant Song."" ""Play in the Summer"" is also notable for a straightforward melody sung without vocal processing, a new wrinkle Trans Am explores throughout this record. But it's ""Where Do You Want to Fuck Today"" that offers the first peek into Trans Am's newfound interest in ambient electronics: it consists of a keyboard drone, a chorus of whispering voices, and glitchy digital percussion. ""I'm Coming Down"" is the next plateau, featuring ominous guitars processed to sound like synthesizers churning beneath a gothic vocal melody (again, delivered sans processing), like something off Depeche Mode's Black Celebration. And on its heels come The Red Line's longest cut, the nine-minute instrumental centerpiece, ""The Dark Gift."" It begins with a stately acoustic guitar and morphs into a folk-rock groove before building in intensity and busting into full-throttle rock mode; as it reaches the breaking point, ""The Dark Gift"" slowly cools into a dazzling roller-rink synthesizer coda. It's like the essence of all Trans Am distilled into one epic song. After that, the group offers fine slabs of Pan Sonic-style digital squirm (""Talk You All Tight"") and a bit of shoegazing (the lovely ""Slow Response"") before returning us home with ""Shady Groove,"" a track which reprises the opening synth drone before building steam and cutting off just prior to climax. Though Trans Am once seemed a band that ping-ponged between two distinct musical personalities, they come into their own as a band that's mastered a dozen on The Red Line. Even better, this time it's hard to tell where one ends and another begins.","Two great things about Trans Am: first, though they draw heavily from the past, they have a wonderfully selective memory ...

Commodore Rock EP,Ladytron,by: Mark Richardson,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc6d13d197565213b308/1:1/w_160/4fe08dd6.gif,2000-08-31 05:00:04,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4632-commodore-rock-ep/,Emperor Norton,"This being an Emperor Norton release, the first question is: what kitschy genre will be paid homage? Lounge? E-Z Listening? Krautrock? Salsa? Krautrock played as salsa? True to form, Ladytron indeed are working the retro angle. They're two guys and two girls in love with the early 80s, a time when several flavors of pop music discovered electricity all over again and began to channel the machine pulse of Kraftwerk. And who can blame Ladytron for this love affair? We came of age in the 80s, after all, so we can expect the sounds from this era to cycle through our lives continuously until we all bite the dust. The 1980s were our 1950s, a statement that makes a lot more sense if you grew up watching ""Happy Days"" with your pre-Baby Boomer parents. So we may as well get used to it. Fortunately, there's more to Ladytron than a moonwalk down memory lane. They slavishly ape ancient production techniques on Commodore Rock, but also apply them in the service of catchy pop songs. So while ""Play Girl"" cops the instrumental signifiers of early New Order (cheap drum machine, sweeping faux-string synth washes, prominent, bouncing bass), it also measures up in melody, and that's saying something. Helen Marnie's voice is perfect for the song; inviting and warm, yet just bored enough for new wave. The slightly more original title track features the appropriately Rhinelandish speaking voice of Bulgarian Mira Aroyo. Somewhere behind a fuzzy 303 bassline and choppy electrified drums, Aroyo wields her commanding tongue in a way that will remind Krautrock aficionados of Kluster's 1970 debut, Klopfzeichen. But the oddest moment of this compelling track comes at the three-minute mark, when beautiful, ghostly sheets of feedback drift in and overtake the song completely, transforming it into epic drone music with cheap beats. I don't remember hearing that fusion on the early days of MTV. Bravo. The second side of this four-song EP isn't quite as strong. ""Miss Black"" is a synth instrumental (the only voices are a phalanx of giggly girls that sound like the models from Duran Duran's ""Hungry like the Wolf"") that steals the organ hook already lifted by DJ Shadow for ""Organ Donor"". Meanwhile, ""Paco"" unconvincingly reaches for the darker, colder sonic realm of Gary Numan, and the lyrics (again recited by Aroyo), which detail the layout of a department store, make it a bit difficult to take seriously. Still, though uneven, Commodore Rock remains a worthwhile listen and should be counted as a promising debut.","This being an Emperor Norton release, the first question is: what kitschy genre will be paid homage?

"It Was Hot, We Stayed in the Water",The Microphones,by: Matt LeMay,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c45d13d197565213bf38/1:1/w_160/e75f2da3.jpg,2000-08-31 05:00:03,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5268-it-was-hot-we-stayed-in-the-water/,K,"Rock musicians have always drawn inspiration from fairly eclectic sources. Painters, poets, writers, and filmmakers have been providing fodder for some of the best, and worst, rock songs ever written. But isn't it about time that rock musicians began seeking out influence from another source? How about those oft-forgotten but nevertheless vital entertainers, stand-up comedians. Why stand-up comedians? Well, for starters, comedy is perhaps the only form of entertainment in which the performer must perpetually be in direct connection with the audience. Comedians don't have pretension to hide behind; they can't argue that their comedy is boring because it's ""art."" If they aren't getting laughs, they simply fail. Similarly, they don't have any kind of glossy production to hide behind. If a comedian were to run his voice through a reverb pedal and put Steve Albini at the mixing board, no one would notice. That's why there are no famous comedy club sound guys. But perhaps the greatest single element found in comedy that seems to be sorely lacking in rock music these days is the element of surprise. Now, I've always taken nothing short of personal offense at the notion that rock music is dead. But the almost complete lack of absolute, startling originality that currently plagues the majority of rock music cannot be denied. Don't believe me? Well, let's take a quick quiz: three fill in the blank questions, ranging from the extremely easy to the more advanced: Granted, the last one was a bit esoteric. But odds are, you figured out the first two with very little effort. The archetypal ""rock song"" has become a complete cliché, utilizing the same structure, sound, and instrumentation as 99% of the other rock songs ever written. By the time you've heard the first thirty seconds of almost any song on the radio, you could finish the song as well as the person who actually wrote it. If the rock song were a joke, comedy would have died out years ago, or at least been severely injured due to hurled projectiles. Too often, rock musicians forget that in order to elicit any kind of genuine response from an audience, you have to keep them on their toes. Sure, some comedians, such as Neil Hamburger, are under the impression that telling the same ancient jokes over and over again is funny. But when's the last time somebody said to you, ""Oh, man! You've got to check out this new Neil Hamburger album!"" Like the best stand-up comedians, It Was Hot, We Stayed in the Water makes a point of never letting on where it's going next. It's one of those rare albums that obliterates your expectations of a traditional rock album, yet remains potent and accessible. It's not a record that can be passively listened to-- the constant, drastic shifts in structure and dynamics simply demand your full and undivided attention. It Was Hot opens with lightly-strummed acoustic guitar switching rhythmically from the right to left channel of your speaker-- a subtle effect, but one that sounds remarkably cool, and lends a whole new dimension to an already good song. Suddenly, a small click echoes in the background. A low-level, barely audible hiss lingers just below the fluttering guitar and frontman Phil Elvrum's angelic voice. It's a most subtle change, but it hints perfectly at the oncoming sonic blast. Reverb-drenched snares drive with three times the force of a steam engine, and twice the volume. Fuzz-soaked electric guitars blast slightly off-key. But despite the dissonance and the atypical song structure, the track never breaks down into complete anarchy-- it's still a rock song, just not the one you're used to. The album's next track, ""Ice,"" plays out kind of like its predecessor in reverse, starting with a cacophonous blast of huge-sounding percussion, bass and guitar, before dissipating into strummed acoustics, with K Records songstress Mirah providing backing vocals. The track is a short-lived affair, leading up perfectly to the album's climax, the laid-back yet riveting charms of the Microphones' otherworldly cover of Eric's Trip's ""Sand,"" and the epic ""The Glow."" The former utilizes a shuffling drum sample, and layer after tasty layer of indistinguishable instrumentation and harmonizing vocals, before cutting off abruptly mid-verse. The latter, which stands up there with Summer Hymns' ""New Underdressment"" as one of the most brilliant psych-rock songs of the year, weaves several loosely connected segments together into a disjointed, yet brilliantly self-referential epic. Most important of all, perhaps, is the quality of songwriting demonstrated throughout-- as out there as the construction of the songs may be, the essential elements of melody, chord structure, rhythm, and instrumentation never suffer. The rest of It Was Hot is similarly awesome, culminating with the ominous swell of guitar and keyboards that closes the record. It's a perfectly fitting ending to a brilliant album-- dynamic and complex, yet fragile and strangely beautiful. The album is a shining example of the fact that the best rock songs are those that don't go out of their way to be rock songs.","Rock musicians have always drawn inspiration from fairly eclectic sources.

Selmasongs,Björk,by: Ryan Schreiber,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Founder</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a2c413d197565213893f/1:1/w_160/8db9e0de.gif,2000-08-31 05:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/729-selmasongs/,Elektra,"With each album since the beginning of her solo career, Björk has shattered expectations. On 1993's Debut, she got off the Sugarcubes, trading spazzy, upbeat pop and the embarrassing hollered catchphrases of Einar Orn Benediktsson for a slightly more laidback songwriting approach. On 1995's Post, she soldered previously unimaginable electronic sounds to massive orchestras, creating an album of intense emotion and wild diversity. Then, only two years later, she proved capable of manipulating cutting-edge electronics with an almost prodigious ease on Homogenic, her darkest and most cohesive album to date. Given Björk's past reputation for burning pop rulebooks, Selmasongs should expand on her disregard for traditional song structures, and challenge listeners with inventive sounds and unconventional uses of new technology. It doesn't. In fact, Selmasongs breaks no new ground whatsoever for the Icelandic composer, instead dwelling in more comfortable regions already mapped by Homogenic. The album begins promisingly with the beautifully arranged instrumental, ""Overture."" Muted horns echo distantly and gradually swell into a brief, subdued triumph. Tympani pounds beneath the gigantic sound, seemingly announcing the arrival of Arthur Clarke's 2001 monolith. But what comes next is far from evolution. ""Cvalda"" opens with roughly a minute of busy industrial machinery, which gives way to rhythmic tapping and Björk's overzealous refrain, ""Clatter, crash, clack!/ Racket, bang, thump!/ Rattle, clang, crack, thud, whack, bam!"" ""It's music,"" she whispers. ""Now dance!"" As the tapping morphs into a generic hip-hop beat, vibes cascade eerily over Björk's trademark crooned vocals. Sadly, the melody is lifeless and predictable, and song's chorus, bad enough the first time around, is beaten into oblivion. ""I've Seen It All,"" a duet between Björk and Thom Yorke, diverts attention from the incessant clattering, crashing and clacking of ""Cvalda"" with utter malaise. But the song's very premise is a cliché, expressing such overwrought sentiments as, ""I've seen a man killed by his best friend/ And lives that were over before they were spent."" The paired vocalists also seem an odd match here; when Björk's soaring, intense delivery meets Yorke's general disinterest, the chemistry is far from convincing. Fortunately, Selmasongs' closer saves the record at the last minute with what is easily one of Björk's best works thus far. ""New World"" opens with a muted pulse, and slowly resurrects the melody and horns of the sublime ""Overture."" As the song builds, the beat floats to the surface until it becomes practically crystalline. Björk croons, ""I'm softly walking on air/ Halfway to heaven from here/ Sunlight unfolds in my hair."" Strings scream while the horns climax to a victorious crescendo. Then, without warning, the drums theatrically give out and the song calms to a satiated hum. So, the record definitely has its great moments. The problem is, there are only two of them. Yes, the arrangements are absolutely stunning; yes, the production is truly incredible. But ultimately, it's the songs that matter, and these ones, for the most part, fail to live up to Björk's past offerings. I'm willing to give her the benefit of the doubt on this one, though, and here's why: Selmasongs is a soundtrack to Lars von Trier's Dancer in the Dark, a film in which Björk, as you undoubtedly already know, makes her acting debut. Artists are notorious for tossing off uninspired fluff when Hollywood calls. (Reference Billy Corgan's work on Stigmata or Mel Gibson's Ransom, or John McEntire's score for Reach the Rock.) Also, the album is actually a collaborative effort, rather than a lone Björk project. Only one of its seven songs is credited as having been written solely by Björk; the rest were co-written by Sjón and Lars von Trier, with occasional assistance from LFO's Mark Bell. Bell also co-produced Selmasongs with Björk, with the exception of ""Overture"" and ""New World,"" the record's two finest moments. Stack all this on top of the fact that the lyrics and music were all created specifically to fit the style and substance of the film, and it suddenly doesn't seem all that bad. Björk's official follow-up to Homogenic, Domestika, is due out next year. And of course, it could go either way. If Selmasongs is the side project it appears to be, we can still expect great things in 2001. After all, the capabilities of computer software grow more astounding each day, and Björk has remained on the crest of that wave. But I'm not going to stand here and try to predict the future. All I know is, Selmasongs is a decent album, but pretty average compared to Björk's other stuff. And right now, that's what matters.","With each album since the beginning of her solo career, Bj\xF6rk has shattered\n\ expectations. On 1993's Debut ...

Suitcase: Failed Experiments and Trashed Aircraft,Guided by Voices,by: Matt LeMay,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bfbeea9e61561daa7aed/1:1/w_160/e8274678.gif,2000-08-31 05:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3590-suitcase-failed-experiments-and-trashed-aircraft/,Rockathon,"When I reviewed Guided by Voices' Hold on Hope EP several months ago, I came down pretty damned hard on it. What I didn't let on in that review was the fact that I, like so many of those who later wrote me to tell me that I ""fucking suck,"" experienced an extended tenure as a GBV fanatic. For years, I spent a good chunk of my spare cash on the band's releases, swallowing up pretty much everything from their early LPs to Mag Earwhig! And then things started to fall apart. Kid Marine was the first undeniable sign that all was not well in Dayton, Ohio. For perhaps the first time ever, Pollard struggled to find a catchy melody, instead tossing off an entire full-length of uninspired basement jams. Still, I eagerly anticipated Do the Collapse. Unlike many, I was intrigued by the concept of a fully produced Guided by Voices album. Unfortunately, the record was not a fully produced Guided by Voices album-- it wasn't a Guided by Voices album at all. I dare anybody to disagree that a glossy studio album with songs like ""Motor Away"", ""Gold Star for Robot Boy"", and ""Smothered in Hugs"" wouldn't go down in the rock annals as timeless. The arena rock hooks in those tracks would have lent themselves perfectly to clean, reverb-drenched studio treatment. But instead of upping the ante and rocking out, Do the Collapse wound up limp, closer in nature to a collection of 80s monster ballads than any of their preceding efforts. Perhaps sensing the relative level of disappointment attached to the new material, Bob Pollard has now released Suitcase, a multi-decade-spanning collection of 100 alternate versions, album outtakes, and other unreleased material. Though the majority of the songs in this four-disc box set have never seen formal release, many of them will be familiar to fanatics. An alternate version of the excellent ""Ha Ha Man"" appeared on Tonics and Twisted Chasers, a fanclub-only release from a few years back. ""James Riot"" has been a staple of the band's live shows for years that has cemented itself as a fan favorite and a song title for all true obsessives to blurt out during shows. The alternate version of ""Buzzards and Dreadful Crows"", as well as an alternate take of ""Damn Good Mr. Jam"", both appeared as brief soundbytes on Propeller's ""Back to Saturn X Radio Report"". And much of the material on Suitcase is the stuff of GBV legends, including a track taken from the famed Power of Suck concept LP, originally to be recorded with Kim Deal and Jim Greer. The material on Suitcase ranges from ""Little Jimmy the Giant"", a 1974 Pollard solo track, to early-90s Pollard/Sprout collaborations such as ""Mr. Japan"", to 1998's ""Shrine to the Dynamic Years (Athens Time Change Riot)"", which features current Guided by Voices guitarist Doug Gillard and ex-Breeders drummer Jim MacPherson. But despite the vast amount of time covered, every track on Suitcase is decidedly a Bob Pollard song. With titles like ""Invest in British Steel"" and ""My Feet's Trustworthy Existence"", Pollard's trademark oddball lyrics are in prime form here. And amazingly, so is his songwriting. Suitcase is crammed with classic Pollard moments-- those unique occasions where poorly recorded, sloppily delivered songs somehow become transcendent pop genius. It's moments like this that have made Pollard the veritable indie rock icon he is today, and the severe lack of moments like this that have plagued his recent work. Yet, despite the generally excellent quality of the songs here, there are, of course, a few outstanding flaws that prevent it from achieving the same level of excellence the Bee Thousand era managed. For starters, the insert included is shamelessly self-indulgent, tossing in press quotes that basically amount to ""Bob Pollard is fucking awesome."" Odds are, if you're willing to drop $60 on four discs' worth of outtakes, you already think Pollard is a pretty nifty guy. But perhaps the greatest problem with Suitcase is simply its size. At 100 songs, it's practically impossible to digest in one sitting. Of course, the box set isn't designed to function as a singular album. Rather, it's a treasure trove for GBV completists who won't mind scouring hundreds of minutes of boombox recordings for diamonds in the rough. Listening to Suitcase reminds me why I became obsessed with Guided by Voices in the first place-- Pollard's immense talent as a songwriter simply could not be denied. There's something inherently bittersweet about this massive compilation, in the sense that even the worst of its 100 tracks sound better than, say, ""Zoo Pie"", ""In Stitches"", or ""Dragons Awake"". Of course, I still hold on hope that Pollard will one day regain his title as king of the pop song. Until then, at least we can take comfort in the fact that he probably has enough decent material floating around his basement to keep us satisfied for years to come.","When I reviewed Guided by Voices' Hold on Hope EP several months ago, I came down pretty damned hard on ...

The Gap,Joan of Arc,by: Brent DiCrescenzo,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ba09c0084474cd0c274e/1:1/w_160/e1d09f22.gif,2000-08-31 05:00:00,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4270-the-gap/,Jade Tree,"Occasionally, copywriters paint themselves into corners. Years ago, some Michigan salaryman decided Kellogg's Wheats were just too large to handle for an accelerating American culture. Born soon were the Mini-Wheats, painted in glucose shellac for a still further accelerating American culture. As time passed, the old culture-accelerating pedal was kept firmly to the floor, and before long, Americans demanded a cereal that could at least fit on a spoon or be poured directly into a mouth held agape. Kelloggs' marketing department already had their Mini-Wheats; where could they go from there? Consulting the office Thesaurus, Kellogg's thinktankers fiddled with Bantam Wheats, Lilliputian Wheats, Teeny Wheats, and Microscopic Wheats. Caffeine-burned and frustrated, they finally realized they'd exasperated their Wheats scale decades earlier. The marketers threw in the towel and went with ""Spoonsize."" Lesson learned: consider the future before throwing adjectives at a product. If only I'd taken more Marketing classes or gotten past page four of Tony the Tiger Was Hunted and Killed for the Medicinal Purposes of His Ground Penis: The Downfall and Mis-Marketing of Kellogg's Cereal in Late 20th Century Asian Markets, I might have learned from this modern fable in regards to my continual critical relation to Joan of Arc. Live in Chicago, 1999, the predecessor to The Gap, struck me as ""horrible,"" ""abysmal,"" and perhaps, ""the worst record I've ever heard."" How could I fail to consider another album?! Yet, Tim Kinsella and Joan of Arc are back with the minimal, random The Gap. Live in Chicago, 1999 was certainly ""abysmal,"" but that word implies a ""bottomless,"" ""fathomless,"" or ""infinite"" depth of horrible. How can one proceed further than the infinite? But let's skip all this classification and reification of ""horrible"" and cut to the chase: Joan of Arc make unlistenable faux-art records. Tim Kinsella has embraced ProTools editing and David Grubbs in a similar technology/hero fetish as Harmony Korine with his digital camcorder and Dogme 95 directors. Both jet-haired, unwashed-looking pretenders name-drop John Cassavetes and Assata Shakur-- Kinsella in the title to The Gap's brief drone instrumental, ""John Cassavetes, Assata Shakur, and Guy Debord Walk into a Bar...""; Korine in his tossed-off, cut-and-paste ""novel,"" A Crackup at the Race Riots-- while wrapping their hollow ideas in whatever formless movement currently licks the lobes of the Village Voice. Lightweight absurdity runs throughout their work with intended irony, but true humanity is never injected to raise the work even a half-notch above pure absurdity. Thus, song titles like ""(You) [I] Can Not See (You) [Me] as (I) [You] Can"", despite whatever in-jokes or winking, merely frustrate. ""Another Brick at the Gap (Part 2)"" (there's no part one) and ""United Colors of the Gap"" similarly hint at satire, but offer quiet wank. The silhouettes against white that comprise the record's packaging fittingly sum up its empty ingredients. There are two discernable songs on The Gap-- the first and the last-- which are interchangeable. Gentle, haphazard acoustic and/or clean electric guitar pickings trickle over rodent percussion. With the aid of computer editing, the music's spinal matter is spread even thinner. Consider it the first Free Emo record. ""Freemo,"" if you will. The scatterbrain blips and digital hum follow no pattern which would imply a floating, associative stream-of-consciousness concept. But the music is being associated to nothing other than overused post-rock/emo clichés, and is arguably unconscious to begin with. ""(You) [I] Can Not See (You) [Me] as (I) [You] Can"" abruptly cuts into awkward silence throughout. The sound of sneakers in a dryer rumbles underneath. Welcome to the future! Of music! Somewhere in the middle of the utterly indistinguishable tracks 3 to 7, a lifelike police siren rises. Perhaps Tim Kinsella realizes his crime, but it's neither amusing or interesting. Jeremy Boyle, playing the ""Computer,"" erodes each track into near nothingness, which is frankly a step up from the previous record. Kinsella's lyrics remain refreshingly absent for the most part. Joan of Arc comprise a tiny, relatively new niche in underground music. A so-called ""art band"" on a disrespected, bleached, college-boy pop label that impresses few Wire subscribers, the Arc will never shake their whiny emo roots. Nor do they deserve to. Kinsella might remain the token ""difficult"" artist in the indie pop collection of University students, but Joan of Arc are as Chicago, low-class, unknown, and unappetizing as Green River cola. The Gap will be their Spoonsize Horrible album.","Occasionally, copywriters paint themselves into corners. Years ago, some Michigan\n\ salaryman decided Kellogg's Wheats were just too large ...

House of Binary,The Wisdom of Harry,by: Paul Cooper,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929aa5dea9e61561daa5bab/1:1/w_160/4b37aca5.gif,2000-08-29 06:01:40,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8719-house-of-binary/,MatadorMatador,"Thanks to the ""Survivor"" reality show, surviving no longer means to continue living. ""Survivor"" has come to mean vanquishing all opposition and standing tall, but entirely alone, on a pile of dirty cash. By this revised definition, Pete Astor, frontman of the Wisdom of Harry, is not a survivor; he is a subsisting hanger-on. Astor cannot be judged in such starkly totalitarian terms. As a member of the Loft, he created a band that permanently teetered on the edge of utter collapse. A song like ""Up the Hill Backwards"" belongs in the permanent collection of precipitous art. Like the Fire Engines' Davey Henderson, Astor's work has a subdued surrealism to it, and as such, is so destined for esotericism. The Weather Prophets, Astor's next band, achieved little but acclaim before two band members went off to join country-rock chancers the Rockingbirds. So will the Wisdom of Harry commercially succeed where Astor's other acts have sunk? Initial signs are hardly hopeful. The fact that the band's early material (compiled later as The Stars of Super 8), was issued by labels tinier than TV dinners and garnered virtually no support isn't exactly encouraging. But to those attuned to quirky soundscaping and compelling verbal juxtapositions, House of Binary-- the Wisdom of Harry's second album-- is a lo-fi mansion of Newport opulence. Throughout House of Binary, Astor's long-recognized appreciation for Lou Reed's lyrics and garage-band musical forthrightness is blended with an appreciation of the Rephlex roster. Two tracks immediately arrest you with their skewed pop confection-- the very Beta Band and exceedingly compilable ""Coney Island of Your Mind,"" and the sickly scheming psychedelia of ""Caesar Boots."" That these two tracks are sequenced back-to-back, and so early in the album, confirms Astor's confidence in his talents. ""March of the Otaku"" follows them, and bountifully exhibits Astor's supremacy of keyboards and twisted ambionics. As slow and low as the track is, you'd never want to hear it on a chill out compilation-- the Dead Can Dance choir and fairground organ melodies exhume too many repressed memories of childsnatchers, spiked cotton candy, and ""Tales from the Crypt""-induced nightmares. ""Quite an achievement, Mr. Astor,"" the critic mumbles, as his mom coaxes him out from behind two lacrosse sticks, a pile of dirty Converses, and the broken power supply of an Atari 7200, abandoned to the relentless entropy of his bedroom closet. As if to redeem himself for the previous terror, ""Theme from Eggboy"" channels the mojos of Lee ""Scratch"" Perry, Augustus Pablo, Robert Johnson, and the Boards of Canada, and is just overwhelming in its beguiling voodoo pull. Astor gets confessional during the ambient torch song, ""Boxed"": ""Looks like I'm boxed again/ But it's okay,"" sounds less like an assessment of a poorly parked vehicle than it does Astor's resignation to being sparsely acclaimed, pigeon-holed, and woefully unrecompensed for his gift for writing genuinely sympathetic songs. During the deep, rolling glamour of ""Disco C,"" Astor lets us in on a hush-hush secret-- the Bates' Motel has been throwing Summer of '88 house parties! The lonely, mama-lovin' Norman shows himself to be quite a connoisseur of bass-heavy garage classics like Don Carlos' ""Alone,"" Kym Mazelle's moody ""Useless,"" and Jamie Principal's ""Baby Wants to Ride."" With such a snappy hook, marketing execs surely can't withhold publicity funds by confusing House of Binary with another Rusted Root release, can they? It's not within my power to send House of Binary up to the cash-raking heights of Destiny's Child's own definition of ""Survivor""-- and I get the sense that Astor wouldn't want that, anyway. I can only recommend that we, as listeners, make the effort to send it up there. Whatever the accountants' bottom line will finally show, Astor's concerns, surreally masked or not, are far loftier than the banal accruing of disposable funds. Towards the close of the album, Astor states, ""I'm going to make my life right/ Going to write to everyone/ Tell them what I've done/ Gonna make my life right/ Gonna stand on a high building/ Gonna scream against the sky/ Gonna beg for forgiveness/ Try to make it all right."" Hey, Pete, no need for apology, mate. We know what you've done: you've done just fine.","Thanks to the ""Survivor"" reality show, surviving no longer means to continue living.

As a member of 808 State, he masterminded the first credible British responses to the techno being imported from Detroit. Newbuild, 808 State's debut, created the kind of catch-up energy that few albums have ever generated. I would even argue that it's dance music's Nevermind: it defined a whole new musical landscape and depicted, in huge sweeps, an entirely fresh mode of expression. The Roland 808, the TB303, and the other rudimentary machines and devices used to create Newbuild have all become fetish items of late, and were it not for Simpson's departure, 808 State would have become the pioneering electronic act without equal. But he did leave, and has done pretty well for himself since. He wrote the warehouse anthem ""Voodoo Ray"" before realizing that the voodoo within the tune was blighting him. He turned his attention away from thrashing Derrick May at his own game and took to the polyrhythmic expanses of jungle. Released on his own Juicebox label, 28 Gun Bad Boy and Black Science Technology prove that when focused, Simpson is capable of disciplined soulful electronic masterworks. Essence, however, showcases his distracted, settle-for-almost-anyone self-- the one that gets record companies interested and involved. The last time he let a company control him, they refused to release the album (High Life Low Profile, nixed by Sony). Before that, the company had messed around with Automannik and left a meager husk of a reportedly vee vee special record. Studio !K7 release Essence probably with a heap of reverence in their hearts, and that's why they can't tell him that Lady Miss Kier doesn't belong on a cigar-lounge trip-hop album that criminally disguises its avant-jungle artistry. They apparently also can't bring themselves to tell Simpson that Essence actually deserves rejection. Geffen once sued Neil Young for producing un-Neil Young albums. And while I appreciate that artists must have the freedom in which to break down boundaries and public perceptions, I do feel that record companies should tell revered and honored artists when they're producing sub-standard stuff. And infuriatingly sub-standard Essence is. The dead giveaway is the opener, ""The Universe,"" an awkwardly delivered spoken word piece about the universe within our bodies and the spirituality that we house in the micro-universes of our atomic make-up. This undisciplined, unsubstantiated new age clap-trap would be far more at home in the coffeehouses of UC Berkeley than they are on Essence. ""Could You Understand"" strives for the emotional power of ""Finley's Rainbow,"" Black Science Technology's crucial reworking of Finley Quaye's version of Bob Marley's ""Sun is Shining,"" which also borrows from Jacob Miller's multiply versioned ""Baby, I Love You So."" Lamb's Louise Rhodes, potentially the most compatible collaborator, gives a sterling performance of the psychobabble ""Humanity,"" which is as galling a session of fatuous ego-stroking self-actualization as anyone might hear outside of an anger-management seminar conducted by a lapsed and self-loathing cleric. Sad to relate, there are plenty more lyrics gleaned from Borders' Self-Improvement Section. On ""Universal Spirit,"" Wendy Page trills, ""Universal spirit elevates your soul/ When your heart perceives it/ Love is in control/ Dive into the ocean/ Energize your love."" At least when former Deee-Liter Lady Miss Kier steps up to the mic, she's downright strange: ""Something's really happening/ Smoking sassafras/ Grass is on her arse/ Wearing out her slippers."" No one can withhold the Adam Ant Award for Utter Whibble from Lady Miss Kier for such baffling cobblers! Throughout Essence, Simpson valiantly attempts to compensate for his vocalists' inadequacies. The music he sets their Aquarius-Age warblings to is invariably some of the most sincere and artful that a drum-n-bass producer has ever committed to hard disk. Even the Bukem-ish ""First Breath"" remains unimpeachable due to the accurate and faultless position of each beat and sub-bass boom. ""Humanity,"" lyrics aside, initially shuffles in a samba before Simpson's heavily echoed toms prepare us for the subtle rush of his processed breakbeats. ""Final Call"" revisits rave's undeniable glories-- from the Cabaret Voltaire basslines to the Pet Shop Boys orchestral stabs, and the jack track hand claps and rimshots. The track is unashamedly nostalgic, but since Simpson pretty much invented the style, it'd be churlish to reprimand him for it. If ""Fever or a Flame"" were versioned (sans Wendy Page), it would doubtless reside in junglist DJs boxes for months; cleansed of insipid vocals, the track would be an unstoppable peaktime roller. What makes Essence such a gadfly is that, had Mono or Hooverphonic released it, I'd have been thrilled that they'd escaped from the Serge Gainsbourg-sampling, goatee-stroking gulag they wandered into quite voluntarily. But as Black Science Technology unquestionably proved, a Guy Called Gerald is matchless in his ability to create faultless techno soul. Essence mocks its creator's reputation. I can hear elements of an outstanding, possibly even genre-opening album amongst the jumble of guest vocals and conventional verse/chorus/verse structures. It's as though Simpson needs more than to create another soulful masterpiece of machine music; he needs the fleeting pleasure of being a one-hit wonder. If Simpson is mad keen on collaborating, why not hook up with Me'Shell NdegéOcello, an artist who would be equally soulful and more than capable of understanding and complimenting his exemplary machine-soul aesthetic. Until then, we must either use a mental filter to erase the inanities, or return Black Science Technology to the disc tray and wait for another five years to pass before Simpson releases another comeback.","No one could seriously deny Gerald Simpson's contribution to electronic music.\n\ As a member of 808 State, he ...

EP+2,Mogwai,by: Nick Mirov,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c37f69fc7814a47cd668/1:1/w_160/83fc0d31.gif,2000-08-23 06:01:40,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5368-ep2/,Matador,"The most brilliant band in the world, or the greatest rock 'n' roll swindle? Mogwai is one of those rare bands that elicits opinions as bipolar as the music it creates, be it either Islamic-fundamentalist-style fanatical devotion, nonplussed perplexity (often to the point of outright hostility), or both. The true Mogwai listening experience is a fragile, tempermental thing; listen to an album of theirs in the wrong setting and it comes off as pretentious, repetitive, and banal. But under the right circumstances, it can wield a power as strong and inexplicable as gravity, holding one completely in epiphanic thrall. I've had plenty of both kinds of experiences with Mogwai and I'm still no closer to really understanding how they do what they do. On paper, their formula seems moronically simple: agonizingly slow, quiet, repetitive instrumental figures slowly building layer upon layer of tension until either the song snaps, overflowing with monstrous cascades of alien noise... or it doesn't. Perhaps this more-than-occasional lack of release is what turned people off to Come On Die Young, an album whose tension building over the course of its entire length proved too frustrating, even for hardcore fans. So this (sort of eponymous) six-song EP immediately succeeds where Die Young fails: it's not as long, so it's a bit easier to get a handle on, and it contains both the really quiet parts and the really loud parts. Somewhat less superficially, it also happens to contain some of Mogwai's finest work to date, as the band continues to refine and innovate from within the narrow confines of their formula. ""Stanley Kubrick"" is, for lack of a better word, excellent. A willowy organ drone hovers gently yet ominously, while what sounds like a human voice slowed down to quarter-speed snakes between the sustained bass and guitar notes. Perfectly arranged, the song simmers enticingly but never boils over; like the best Mogwai songs, it seems almost inconceivable that it could have been created by mere mortals. The next few tracks return the proceedings to earth with more conventional instrumentation: ""Christmas Song"" is a pretty piano-and-strings piece that bears some resemblance to the *Twin Peaks theme in places, and ""Burn Girl Prom Queen"" drifts along for eight minutes on the strength of a melancholy horn section. * The noisy climaxes kick back in on ""Rage: Man"" and ""Small Children In The Background,"" but here they don't overwhelm and mangle the main melodies of the songs. It could be that the band has learned to write themes that can withstand pummeling, tsunami-sized guitar distortion, or that they've learned how to use white noise as an instrument unto itself, or perhaps a little of both. But the bottom line remains the same: Mogwai is getting better. Much, much better. But how can it be that Mogwai is improving even when their songs continue to sound the same? What can they possibly do with soft/loud instrumental music that hasn't been done a hundred thousand times before? I honestly don't know. I'd like to see them release an album consisting of a single hour-long track. Or perhaps a symphony, complete with movements. It may sound ambitious and bombastic, but Mogwai's mission has always been to imbue guitar rock with the kind of emotional landscape previously reserved for classical music. The fact that they've succeeded maybe 25% percent of the time so far is reason enough to call them, as Stephen Malkmus has, the best band of the 21st century.","The most brilliant band in the world, or the greatest rock 'n' roll swindle?

A-Sides: 1988-1999,Buffalo Tom,by: Sam Eccleston,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a3e9c0084474cd0c0397/1:1/w_160/2dcd8e45.jpg,2000-08-22 05:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1011-a-sides-1988-1999/,BeggarsBeggars,"Screw this Malkmus hoo-ha: Buffalo Tom are rock's greatest slackers. Where the leading lights of the indie rock nation have to affect an air of triumphant boredom so they can conceal their true colors as solo-ridden guitar-god aspirants Buffalo Tom: 1) named themselves after their drummer and Neil Young's first band because it'd have been too much trouble to come up with anything really new; 2) played assorted variations on the strummy post-pop that filled collegiate airwaves throughout the 1980s because innovation is overrated; and 3) wrote sharply observed conversational lyrics because it was too hard to be obscure. Score one for the losers. The band's albums, of course, were spotty affairs at best-- noise-tune gems riddled with poorly thought-out throwaways. But when distilled to their ""hits,"" they're actually revealed to be a mighty, mighty singles band. A-Sides arranges the songs by tone rather than chronology, and not surprisingly, ends up as their greatest album. Singer, guitarist and principle songwriter Bill Janovitz isn't abashed about his influences on these tracks. In the liner notes, he cops to the Stones' ballads, Dinosaur, Hüsker Dü and... Aerosmith. From the classic rock side, the band learned how to demonstrate soul and use an acoustic guitar, while picking up the concept of gain-to-11 distortion from their more contemporary ascendants. The best songs on A-Sides play that tension perfectly. ""I'm Allowed"" builds from bluesy, haunted verses into ragged-throated blare. Despite the liner notes' anxiety about the song, Buffalo Tom's early epic ""Larry"" masses countryish strumming and punkish fury. And even a baldly imitative sketch like ""Birdbrain"" works, thanks to its wealth of powerful hooks. Unlike their better-respected peers and descendents, the band was unafraid of the obvious guilty pleasure, instead exploiting their innate melodic smarts and direct approach to bring it all home. The most pleasant surprise here is the consistency. Where watching the slow, sorry flameout of Dinosaur or Hüsker's too-quick self-destruct was saddening and obvious, a late-date Buffalo Tom single like ""Summer"" rings with just as much sincerity and care as the tentative classic ""Taillights Fade."" Because the band, completely unconcerned about coolness or timeliness or complexity, is willing to give up the goods over and over again, the Tom-ist agenda remains as fresh today as it was ten years ago.",,7.9,
Beat,Chris Knox,by: Michael Sandlin,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bbe2abf31b7dc7155bc0/1:1/w_160/5ee56e33.gif,2000-08-22 05:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4501-beat/,Thirsty EarThirsty Ear,"You may remember Chris Knox from his old band, the Tall Dwarfs, as they were spawned from the same New Zealand indie label, Flying Nun, as the Verlaines, the Chills, and the Clean. If you're unfamiliar with these bands, call up Steve Malkmus, Lou Barlow, Ira Kaplan and countless others who've learned plenty from Knox and his Flying Nun mates. Along with other hugely influential but semi-obscure lo-fi innovators such as Young Marble Giants, Knox has done more with merely a voice, synthesizer, simple guitar, and drum machines than most could do with an orchestra. Knox, however, is no longer notorious for onstage self-laceration (he used to carve himself up with whatever jagged objects happened to be lying around); at 47, he rarely puts himself under the knife anymore. These days, Knox often tours in support of the bands he and the Tall Dwarfs helped to inspire, like Yo La Tengo, for instance. In concert, he dresses like your average beach bum. He wears that executive secretary/Madonna-esque headgear with the portable microphone. This way he can float freely, sometimes crooning dementedly to individual audience members. Knox will even persuade fans to come up and play his simple songs while he dashes off for a quick piss. These healthy bits of forced egalitarianism make the Chris Knox live experience a shared one, whether you like it or not. And that's a good thing. Iggy would be proud. Upon hearing Knox's latest, Beat, it seems he's still most happy when exploring the shadowy nooks and crannies of the human psyche. Knox revels in the dark psychological spaces that most songwriters, even those considered ""confessional,"" conveniently avoid. But there's an element of humor underpinning all this too, sick as it may sometimes be. As expected, the music itself is just about as minimal as straight tonal composition will allow. Knox uses his limited technical abilities to great advantage, banging out a few chords on the electric piano or guitar. The beat is usually supplied by a drum machine, or sometimes nothing at all. Knox loves getting across simple pop melodies, too, which serve as a great foil for his pessimistic lyrics. Occasionally, he'll interject some stabbing fuzz guitar into the mix, or hang a nice, thick feedback curtain over a verse or two. What more do you really need? The subject matter Knox tackles is, on the surface, what you might expect of a mad genius pushing 50: twisted love songs, ruminations on aging, human nature, mortality. Sometimes the lyrics conform to the overall minimalist ethic, as Knox may simply repeat a couple of lines, as on ""It's Love."" (""I need you/ I need you every single day."") Often, though, he juxtaposes the complex, extended lyric with conventional pop changes, like on ""What Do We Do with Love,"" a cute little song about the myriad ways people exploit and abuse this strange and often dangerous phenomenon known as ""love."" ""Everyone's Cool"" examines the human animal's self-deluding assumption that we're all so damn special and unique. Knox suggests that we're basically all just a slightly different version of the same self-obsessed, egotistical, over-emotional wanker. But the most affecting song has to be ""Becoming Something Other,"" about a man coming to terms with his father being a wheelchair-bound vegetable: the old man is paralyzed, unable to speak coherently, and trying to express to his son that he's dying. Knox spares none of the ugly details of this encounter, and it's damn disturbing to say the least. There's nothing more than an eerie keyboard drone in the background, and the chords shift in achingly slow increments-- aptly representative of the father's slow but steady mental and physical deterioration. As you can see, Knox can be just as cynical, bitchy and depressing as he is charming. But, hey, that's why we love him. So don't count on Knox becoming the new guest host on Live with Regis anytime soon. Free of the debilitating, art-killing curse of mainstream success, Knox proves he's still a vital voice reverberating from rock's fertile underground-- much like he was twenty years ago. What's next? Hard to say. Maybe someday he'll learn to play an instrument. But let's hope not.","You may remember Chris Knox from his old band, the Tall Dwarfs, as they were spawned from the same New ...

Contemporary Movement,Duster,by: Mark Richardson,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ba405e6ef95969322b5e/1:1/w_160/96e734ed.gif,2000-08-22 05:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2493-contemporary-movement/,UpUp,"There's something oddly comforting about the fact that Carl Sagan was a stoner. When young and in the throes of psychedelic experience, the mind automatically focuses on the heavens, wondering if it is really possible that, like, dude, check it: what if there's a whole universe like the one out there inside of a single blackhead? Sagan had this same experience at some point and ran with it; next thing you know, he's loading albums onto the Voyager probes for distant civilizations to rock to. (Fact: the Voyager probes, which will continue to move in a line away from Earth for the next 40,000 years, were outfitted with gold-plated turntables and records cut with sounds from Earth. Among the sounds are Chuck Berry's ""Maybelene"" and a greeting from Jimmy Carter. Sagan selected the tunes, making him by far the most out-there DJ of the pre-remix era.) Whatever powered Sagan's imagination, it should serve as inspiration for us all. Like the Voyager probes, San Jose's Duster has been known to travel the spaceways. It's unclear if the root of it all lies in astronomy or neurology, and maybe it was just the song titles (""Moon Age,"" ""Constellations,"" ""Docking the Pod"") or the Cold War-era reverb on the guitars, but Duster's first album evoked a slow, drifting journey through the void-- one to be taken in either a space capsule or a plush four-poster canopy bed. Contemporary Movement is something a little bit different. While the band sees this as the album where they shed some excess guitar layering, move the vocals up in the mix, and focus on the songs, the sound here isn't all that different. True, there's nothing here nearly as abstract as the buzzing drone construction that was Stratosphere's title track, but Duster still has a way with the slow tempo and the beautifully distorted guitar noise. And from the first washed-out strum on ""Operations,"" it's clearly Duster all the way. No, the major change on this album is in bringing the thematic focus back to earth, over the mountains, through the city, and into the bedroom. Continuing a trend they began on their 1975 EP, Duster show some vulnerability and refuse to mask feelings in cosmic metaphor. For contrast, Duster's first 7"" single, Transmission/Flux, featured a sad, dreamy song that repeated the refrain ""all my friends are cosmonauts""; Contemporary Movement has a song that says, ""Goddamn, I wish I was a little bit smarter"" (on ""Contemporary Breakups""). In the titles and lyrics, these are intimate songs about real emotion. What carries these fragile (and easily mocked) sentiments across is the absolutely fucking gorgeous guitar music they're riding on. Ewing Parton and Canaan Amber (Duster's co-leaders) are wonderful musicians, though I doubt they could play with any real speed or dexterity, even if they wanted to. Their skill lies in finding the perfect guitar to go with just the right amp, so that the sound coming out of the speaker bears all the prickly warmth of your favorite wool sweater-- a tone so detailed you want to rub it between your fingers. Parton and Amber can only sing three notes between them (and sometimes they miss one), so the melodies here have to be simple. This apparent limitation gives the melancholy tunes on Contemporary Movement a haiku-like clarity, and leaves plenty of gaps for the lovely chords to seep through. Aware of delicate humanity with their eyes trained on the stars, Duster has done Carl proud.","There's something oddly comforting about the fact that Carl Sagan was a stoner.

Disappeared,Spring Heel Jack,by: Paul Cooper,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a52613d1975652138e9f/1:1/w_160/af0836b3.gif,2000-08-22 05:00:01,Jazz,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7439-disappeared/,Thirsty Ear,"Spring Heel Jack's seventh album, Disappeared, is an undeniable testament to John Coxon and Ashley Wells' considerable talent and originality. Drum-n-bass acts can rarely boast even seven 12"" releases before they fall foul of their own copycat inadequacies or jump onto the Mixmag-sanctioned style of the month. Spring Heel Jack care not that the Manumission mongoloids won't dance a day-glo strut to their cerebral works, nor that the Hoxon Square Mafia have a whole new set of sneaker aesthetics by which to judge nu-jazz crews. It's Coxon and Wales' self-assurance that has seen them through being just another dub-cavernous junglist act picked up by a major label, to being dropped by that major, to signing to an indie that welcomes their abstract proclivities and relishes their installation-enabled audio. Unlike the Oddities album, Disappeared stays pretty much clear of Simfonias for Four Turntables and A Concrete Block or clanging homages to La Monte Young. The only starling avant-gardisms come in the form of guest bass clarinetist (and hugely gifted Devonian) John Surman. For the two takes of the title track, Surman adjusts his instrument from the autumnal gold-drenched tones he showcases on his Coruscating release, to the percussive, embryonic capsules of distortion. It's quite an effect and it sounds like Coxon and Wales are unsure what to make of Surman's contribution. So, they cop out and plant Surman's seeds in a heavy ambient soil, hoping something will germinate. It's a shame because rather than wowing The Wire collective, the duo could have directed the avant-garde to a fresh, untilled tundra of possibilities. But, hey. I should have the luxury to complain when so many drum-n-bass acts fail to reach beyond the mediocre. Spring Heel Jack have rarely relied on the well-worn breaks so brainlessly incorporated by many others. For instance, the battery that powers ""Rachel Point"" sounds like the Latin massive that propelled the Pet Shop Boys' ""Se a La Vida;"" the bass that grainily slides through ""Mit Wut"" seems to have slipped out from one of those hydroponic sessions Adrian Sherwood arranged for Primal Scream a few vanished years ago. Coxon and Wales even find time to have some light fun with big beat on ""Trouble and Luck"" before returning to dub for a clicks n' cuts rinse out Cole Porterishly titled ""To Die a Little."" Released almost exactly five months after their previous proper album, Treader, how has the band developed? Not all that much. But then again, Spring Heel Jack have never been bombastic and headline-grabbing. Some expected this album to be an abandonment of junglism for the splenetic classicisms and noisebursts that blunderbussed through Treader. But if anything, Disappeared reestablishes Spring Heel Jack as drum-n-bass experts, gifted at layered percussion, and erudite at unsettling listeners with an uneasy ambience. Over the years, they've let go of the laboratorial digitizing of the sounds around us for richer, more organic statements. They have not imagined the Earth populated by cyborgs or composed soundtracks for straight-to-video Matrix rip-offs. And even if Spring Heel Jack may have their records played during donor-evenings at the Tate Modern, at least they don't think they live there.","Spring Heel Jack's seventh album, Disappeared, is an undeniable testament to John Coxon and Ashley Wells' considerable talent and ...

Some past secret, perversion, like, or dislike that has been kept hidden, for fear of embarrassment and public stoning. But listening to the Starlight Mints, I feel I must now make my horrible, horrible secret known to the world: I hate mint. This may come as a shock to those of you chewing violently upon your 18th stick of Wrigley's Spearmint today. But those that have taken mint for granted have no idea how difficult it is to go through life barely being able to stand the stuff. Until a few months ago, I was still using Sesame Street toothpaste. And don't even get me started on candy. Finally, though, I've found a mint I can tolerate. A firm, robust mint that's remarkably palatable, if, at times, a bit too saccharine. The Dream That Stuff Was Made Of is a short, well-sequenced offering of punchy orchestral pop. And orchestral pop can be risky business, which is why ""string section"" is a favorite rock and roll punchline. But when The Dream That Stuff Was Made Of is at its best, it manages to reap all the benefits of the genre-- a full, expansive sound, and layers of contrasting melodic lines-- while avoiding the self-indulgence that so often foils their orch-pop contemporaries. ""Submarine #3"" kicks off the record with a small quartet accentuated by an intensifying drum beat, summoning the spirit of Bacharach past. But aside from some distorted falsetto vocals that might be better suited for fellow Oklahoma natives the Flaming Lips, there isn't much to discuss. Frontman Allan Vest possesses a down-to-earth voice that seems perfectly suited to this kind of music: relatively expressive, and always on key. ""The Bandit"" is a similarly structured song, relying upon big, open major chords and string accents to create a thoroughly charming pop sound. But the not-so-amusingly titled third track, ""Sir Prize,"" breaks away from this formula slightly, by implementing fractured song structure and quirky slide guitar riffs. This element of quirk also makes its presence known on stronger tracks like the suspiciously Flaming Lips-esque ""Valerie Flames,"" as well as chewed-up bubblegum numbers like the aptly titled ""Sugar Blaster."" As a whole, The Dream That Stuff Was Made Of sounds great-- Enon and System of a Down producer Dave Sardy gives it a studio punch that may pale in comparison to the work of Dave Fridmann, but is nonetheless impressive. So, yeah, I'll happily listen to the Starlight Mints every once in a while, even if they haven't reached the point where I feel comfortable brushing with them.","I've always liked to believe that everyone lives with at least one secret shame.

15 Big Ones/Love You,The Beach Boys,by: D. Erik Kempke,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a23713d19756521387fe/1:1/w_160/d1f3f86f.jpg,2000-08-15 05:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11669-15-big-oneslove-you/,Capitol,"Every Beach Boys album made in the 1970s was a comeback attempt. In the face of dwindling commercial returns, the group struggled earnestly in the first part of the decade to define itself outside the shadow of Brian Wilson. These attempts were abandoned after the success of 1974's greatest hits collection, Endless Summer, which established the group as the world's most successful oldies act. 1976 found the group attempting to maintain its revived fortunes in the recording studio as well as on the concert stage. While many of the other recent Beach Boys ""twofer"" releases contained music of similar tenor and approach, these two albums, issued during the most conflicted time period in the band's history, are immediately striking in their dissimilarity. For these albums, one of the most crass marketing ploys in a group history dominated by crass marketing ploys was devised: the return of full control of the group to once-great bandleader Brian. Unfortunately, Wilson had spent most of the '70s descending into an abyss of paranoia, addiction, and obesity. He hadn't been in charge of a Beach Boys session since 1966, and that the group sought in 1976 to restore Wilson to the control that they had fought to wrest from him 10 years earlier is painfully ironic. Given Brian Wilson's fragile state, it's difficult to understand what the group expected to achieve through this arrangement. The result of these sessions, 1976's 15 Big Ones, is a wreck of an album. The production is muddy and confused, the material largely comprised of uninspired covers and outtakes from earlier albums. ""Susie Cincinatti"" was a 1970 b-side. The group's covers of standards like ""Chapel of Love"" and ""In the Still of the Night"" are notable only for the morbid fascination they hold (the vocals on the former are truly cringe-inducing). Brian's once-sweet falsetto is reduced to a hoarse crackle; as a result, Mike Love's painful nasal whine is the dominant voice on the record. Only a few cuts stand out from the mess. Of the originals, ""Had to Phone Ya"" and ""Back Home""-- both of which are based on songs first written in the early 1960s-- are the best. Only those cuts, along with a truly inspired version of the Righteous Brothers' Spector-produced classic ""Just Once in My Life"" (actually benefiting from Wilson's raw vocals) save the album from being completely unlistenable. Strangely, 15 Big Ones was a huge hit upon its initial release, but to say that it hasn't stood the test of time is an understatement. After the tour for that record, Brian Wilson planned a solo release, but the group quickly latched onto the project in an attempt to maintain their momentum. The product, The Beach Boys Love You, is totally Brian's, and is the last album produced under the group's name to be written and produced solely by him. It's nothing if not idiosyncratic, and sounds like literally no other Beach Boys album from any period. The record is dominated by Wilson's newfound infatuation with the Moog synthesizer, and his hoarse but heartfelt vocals. There are a couple throwaways-- the early '70s outtake ""Good Time,"" and the inscrutable Roger McGuinn co-write ""Ding Dang""-- but for the most part, Brian's songwriting and arranging talents are intact and in full force. The format of the album recalls Wilson's first truly memorable LP, The Beach Boys Today, by placing uptempo, upbeat numbers on Side One, and a suite of slower, romantic songs on Side Two. The lyrics here tend toward the childlike (""If Mars had life on it/ I might find my wife on it"") to the simply bizarre (""Johnny Carson's a real live wire""). It's the ballads in the album's second half that elevate it to the level of a great Beach Boys album. ""The Night Was So Young,"" with its beautiful harmonies, sounds like it could have been a Pet Sounds outtake, were it not for the bleating synths. ""Let's Put Our Hearts Together"" features a duet with Wilson's then-wife, Marilyn Rovell. This is Wilson's most personal set of songs, and he weaves a shimmering web of sound on them, his vocals as strong as they ever were. The Beach Boys Love You stands in sharp contrast to the albums that preceded and followed it, because it was a product of genuine inspiration on Brian Wilson's part, with little outside interference. Soon after its release, both Brian and the Beach Boys resumed their separate downward trajectories: the group into mediocrity, disco mixes, and obscurity, and Brian back into addiction and mental instability. That Brian Wilson has, in recent years, reclaimed some small measure of his sanity and now performs regularly, presiding over his rich legacy, can be considered a small miracle. Still, one can't help but regret that he has never again created music as original and individualistic as presented on this release in the ensuing years. It's a credit to the Beach Boys that for one brief, final moment, they allowed Brian Wilson the freedom to create the music he wanted, and the resulting album is, like its creator, frazzled, delicate, and beautiful in its sentiment.","

In Case You Didn't Feel Like Plugging In,The Posies,by: Al Shipley,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a0fcc0084474cd0bfce3/1:1/w_160/77bd554b.gif,2000-08-15 05:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6425-in-case-you-didnt-feel-like-plugging-in/,CasaCasa,"With the ""Unplugged"" fad long since faded and studio craft becoming increasingly valued by artists on either end of the scale of sophistication-- from hitmakers to sound scientists-- the acoustic guitar hasn't been given a lot of love lately. It's still a ubiquitous object in society and a universally embraced songwriting tool, but the fact is, it just doesn't make as many appearances on stage or screen as it used to. For all their tendencies toward traditional songcraft, the Posies have been unexpected odd men out of the last crazy decade. Rubbing elbows with R.E.M. and Big Star has helped them earn a modest share of commercial success and cult worship, but the reception the music world has offered them has been stingily disproportionate to the amount of talent and effort they've put forth. So it's fitting that the Posies' latest incarnation is purely acoustic, a leap that few contemporary acts would dare to take. After all, who wants to give up all those cool distortion pedals and samplers? In Case You Didn't Feel Like Plugging In is the latest in a surprisingly prolific posthumous re-examination of a band that hasn't written many new songs since 1994, and supposedly broke up in 1998. And since a lot of their recent releases have been somewhat redundant and inessential-- like the recent best-of collection and the overwhelmingly comprehensive four-disc box set due out soon-- it just might be the best among the glut. Here, founding singer/guitarists Ken Stringfellow and Jon Auer get down to business with the aid of a loving local audience. In Case serves as a fine counterpart to the Posies' other live release, last year's electric Alive Before the Iceberg. It also makes for an unavoidable comparison between the two sides of the Posies. On Alive, they were still cranking the amps and attempting to reconcile the chasm between their power-pop roots and their Pacific Northwest rawk breeding. And, as proven by that documented moment, they fared pretty well, belting out admirable harmonies while amply fulfilling the distortion quota. But here, the songs are stripped bare and performed as they were written. Appropriately enough, the strongest performances come with songs culled from 1989's Failure, the initially self-released debut album the duo recorded before growing into a full-on rock combo. When they flub the lyrics on ""I May Hate You Sometimes,"" the old school fans show off a memory of the Posies' repertoire superior to even that of the band with an impromptu sing-along. Later, more aggressive material-- like ""Please Return It"" and an ineffectively slowed ""Grant Hart""-- is presented less flatteringly without the benefit of a chugging rhythm section to propel it. The record's song selection might not warrant as much criticism if the performance hadn't been mercilessly pared down to a mere 10 songs. Considering that the shows in support of In Case have easily pulled past the two-hour mark, covering nearly every song from the the Posies' sizable catalog of songs, the stingy treatment is plain inexcusable. With no need for throaty delivery over raging amps, Auer and Stringfellow's voices sound more crystalline and perfectly matched than ever. Instead of just singing the same lyrics simultaneously and just hoping they come together, the two compliment each other with every melodic twist. The a cappella intro to ""Suddenly Mary"" transcends the polish of its studio counterpart by proving that, yes, they can really do that in person. The magic of any great pop song is that it presents a series of pressure points, stringing together fleeting moments of ecstasy to resemble a narrative or train of thought. A catchy chorus or a clever lyric isn't as important as allowing all the ideas to shake hands and work together. The Posies' true skill is a consistent ability to do just that and sustain it for the entirety of each song, with those pressure points serving as the structure's foundation. One of the prime examples of this comes with the minor hit, ""Solar Sister."" As I listen to the song's stunning solo as performed here, I detect a voice in the background screaming ""Yes! Yes! Yes!"" as Auer pulls the song off the ground and sends it into the stratosphere with gorgeously ascending triplets. But for the first time, it's an audience member-- another person screaming in absolute elation-- and not just a happy little voice in my head. Oh, good. So, it's not just me.","With the ""Unplugged"" fad long since faded and studio craft becoming increasingly valued by artists on either end of the ...

Teenage Dream EP,IQU,by: Mark Richardson,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c19dc0084474cd0c3382/1:1/w_160/12b4f21c.gif,2000-08-15 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4047-teenage-dream-ep/,KK,"Praise is due to IQU leader K.O. for his unique vision in assembling a sample-based, beat-driven band with a highly entertaining live show. But if things don't work out for IQU in the long run, he has no one but himself to blame. Despite early promise, IQU has stumbled badly in establishing any kind of momentum, a trend that continues with this, their second consecutive ho-hum EP stuffed with remixes. Last year's Girls on Dates EP was a noble experiment, attempting to weld the surreal spoken word performance of Miranda July with IQU's rhythmic backdrops. But it was also a failed one that got boring after a few listens. And this new effort is only slightly more successful. Here, IQU have taken a single new song, the admittedly great ""Teenage Dream,"" and offered it up to a half-dozen remixers, most of whom couldn't muster the energy to re-think the original track. Some of the mixes are decent, but most are average, at best. As this release comes more than two years after IQU's last full-length, it seems like nothing so much as annoying filler. But we still get IQU's ""Teenage Dream,"" which sums up everything that makes the band interesting in a single seven-minute track. Starting with a 4/4 bass thump that's more techno than anything they've released in the past, the song folds in standup bass and primitive, electro-style synth lines. But the kicker comes when IQU transforms a sample of a Japanese children's choir singing what sounds like a traditional folk song into a brilliant vocal hook, and then drives home this inspired pop moment with forceful power chords. It's a fantastic track, and one can only hope that their next full-length contains other cuts of similar caliber. But then come the six remixes. Stuart David of Looper is certainly a kindred spirit, so his take is interesting, though ultimately too similar in tone and execution to the original. Fat Cat recording artist Lexaunculpt hands in a very abstract, Autchre-style mix-- complete with harsh laptop tones-- that feels too heavy-handed, despite its skillful programming. Seattle's Team 714 streamlines the beat and adds some Middle Eastern accordion drones. DJ Tomas piles on the percussion and mixes it with some groovy piano to his radically reworked ""Dub ID"" mix. The laidback, spacy cut by Take One & Red Clay is straight-outta-Ninja Tune hip-hop. And finally, Concentrick (the electronic handle for Fucking Champs guitarist Tim Green) offers perhaps the most interesting interpretation-- a dark, claustrophobic piece that employs the sampled voices of the original for ghostly contrast. Teenage Dream also contains two versions of ""Can't You Even Remember That"" from IQU's first album. One is a head-nodding downtempo take by K.O., the other a more abstract and chilling interpretation by Sonic Boom. That's one (great) new track and eight (okay) remixes for those keeping score at home, which makes this one a bit hard to recommend.","Praise is due to IQU leader K.O. for his unique vision in assembling a sample-based, beat-driven band with a ...

1. Mansun releasing a pop/R&B; album Okay, so maybe not. But it's certainly up there with Bachmed on my list. After all, Mansun went from brooding glam-ish guitar rock on their 1997 debut, Attack of the Grey Lantern, to all-out prog song structures and abstrusities on the astonishing follow-up, Six. They haven't exactly been pointing the way to Little Kix. This isn't a 180. This isn't even a 90. This is almost shifting onto another plane of music. But that's not to say the shift is dramatic enough for comparisons to become meaningless. The band has expressed a taste for the Bee Gees, ABBA, and mid-'80s Prince, and this record is probably the result of such affinities. All the same, not much of Little Kix could be classified as filler, even if two tracks-- ""Fool"" and ""Goodbye""-- exhibit a slight dip in quality from the surrounding material. The band seems to be painting with muted colors, though, especially in contrast to the manic off-kilterness of Six. Perhaps this has something to do with the seeming disinterest of the band members backing frontman Paul Draper. Little Kix could, at times, be mistaken for a Draper solo album for all the effort the other guys appear to be investing. Guitarist Dominic Chad contributes some nice lead touches occasionally, but bassist Stove King and drummer Andie Rathbone seem content with just laying down a nice pocket. The album's largest detractor lies with its lyrics. The complete lack of irony prevents it from reaching its potential as a genuinely satisfying production. Sure, honesty and directness are nice and all, but with no bite, lines like, ""We are the boys, think about nothing and/ We are the boys, boys have got feelings, too,"" fall flatter than the late Bill Hicks at this year's Republican National Convention. Everything is so amazingly darling and clichéd. Even the chorus of ""Soundtrack 4 2 Lovers,"" a fine ballad by any measure, could've been culled from the new age compilation, Pure Moods. If you're a real wonk for deep, original sentiments, Little Kix will probably wear like steel underwear. But as a collection of love-themed songs, the record has a lot to offer for listening in the car, boudoir, or singing in the shower.","Top Ten Things I Thought I'd Never See:

"De Mel, De Melão EP",Portastatic,by: Brent DiCrescenzo,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a0f5b1335d7bf1698137/1:1/w_160/c9acc050.gif,2000-08-11 06:01:40,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6418-de-mel-de-melao-ep/,MergeMerge,"Bless globalization. On Portastatic's delicious new EP, Superchunk's Mac McCaughan takes cues from Brazil's tropicalia new wave of the late '60s, who at the time were taking cues from the acid and pop movements of America and England. And now, thirty years later, college kids can interpret the lyrics with help of online translation engines as they sit in an Internet café munching on cashew satay sticks. Portastatic's homage to the fuzzed-out Brazilian pop of the peace era borrows heavily from the trippy sounds of Os Mutantes in particular. McCaughan flecks Gilberto Gil's ""Lamento Sertanejo"" with scratchy guitar leads mimicking the Mutantes' ""A Minha Menina,"" originally a Jorge Ben number. It's this mix of tribute and bastardization that gives the genre playful flavor and soul, and McCaughan sounds well studied and infatuated. Caetano Veloso's ""Baby,"" another song covered by the Mutantes on their debut, simply stands as one of the greatest songs ever by one of the greatest songwriters ever. Impossible to ruin, ""Baby"" even receives one of its greatest versions here. Plunking double bass bops the tune along. Soft, cherubic keyboard subtly melt over the chorus. Slow trombone and wah-juiced guitar inflect a dreamy, gooey mood. It's reassuring to know that the modest lyrics of ""Baby, baby, I love you"" still sound so knee-weakening. ""I Fell in Love One Day,"" an English tune from Mutante Arnaldo Baptista's 1982 solo album, extends the boat-on-a-river hallucinogenic motif. A creepy speed-altered, double-tracked vocal lurks beneath the surface as lethargic static- and reverb-laden snares splash along. On another Caetano Veloso cover, ""Não Identificado,"" Mac leaves the tale of admirer and wishes to professes his unrequited love for flying saucers, and in ""Anticomputador,"" odes in the native Portugese, as with the majority of the EP. Joyce's ""Clareana"" closes the too-short foray in Bahian romance with programmed samba rhythms and more horn. Mac's trademark boyish soprano grants these tunes an ideal naivety and androgynous passion. Certainly some of the native shuffle and boogie is missing, as to be expected from a Chapel Hill fellow, but De Mel, De Melão remains a freshing and successful love-affair with some of the greatest music of the 20th Century. Time will tell if this will rub off on Superchunk.","Bless globalization. On Portastatic's delicious new EP, Superchunk's Mac McCaughan takes cues\n\ from Brazil's tropicalia new ...

1000 Hurts,Shellac,by: Matt LeMay,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a3ca5e6ef95969320702/1:1/w_160/c29a1e76.gif,2000-08-08 05:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7107-1000-hurts/,Touch and Go,"A few days ago, a friend of mine asked what the difference between a film producer and a music producer is. After thinking it over for a few seconds, I responded, ""Film producers are rich and provide financial backing. Music producers are geeks and provide knob twiddling."" Granted, my response doesn't quite capture the complex roles of either film producer or music producer. Shit, I could be completely wrong, for all I know. But it sounded good at the time. Perhaps my image of a typical music producer/engineer has been tainted by Steve Albini. Due in no small part to his reputation, as well as the interviews I've read, I've always pictured him sitting behind a recording console, muttering obscenities to himself, encouraging bands to their faces and dissing them behind their backs. ""Great take, Gavin. I can tell this record is going to be huge. You're a fucking genius."" That night: ""Can you believe I'm recording an album by fucking Bush? These guys are fucking idiots. They don't know the first thing about recording an album. They probably think a compressor is something you put your garbage in!"" Albini's career as a musician hasn't done anything to discourage his image as a total dick. With Big Black and the oh-so-classy Rapeman, he recorded songs about pedophilia, self- immolation, and alcoholism. Albini has always played the sarcastic fuck on his records, his abrasive guitar and unpolished vocals egging on the listener. But 1000 Hurts confirms what previous Albini records have only hinted at. Behind the cynical, hypocritical façade is a pissed off geek. And with this record, Albini has finally given his inner Elvis Costello a voice. For starters, the album's title is a geeky in-joke. 1000 Hurts = 1000 hertz, or 1 kilohertz. The album's inner sleeve is printed to look like an oscilloscope. Its opening track, ""Prayer to God,"" begins with a deep voice running through the technical specifications of the album's recording. And then the rocking begins. Steve Albini's guitar blasts pure distorted treble as he pleads, ""To the one true God above/ Here is my prayer... / There are two people here/ And I want you to kill them."" As fellow producer Bob Weston on bass and Todd Trainer on drums bust the track open, Albini delves into the specifics of his request for the death of his ex. ""Her, she can go quietly/ By disease or a blow/ To the base of her neck."" Her new beau is not spared: ""Him, just fucking kill him/ I don't care if it hurts/ Yes I do/ I want it to."" What Albini's voice and lyrics convey here is a combination of anguish, self-importance, and helplessness. He's not going to kill his ex-girlfriend and her new flame; he asks God to do his dirty work for him. By the end of the track, ""Fucking kill him"" has become a mantra. Weston and Trainer pound their instruments like doped-up gorillas. The intensity makes ""primal"" sound like something British people drink with breakfast. The rest of 1000 Hurts shows Shellac in prime form. Since the release of Terraforms, they seem to have realized that 12-minute rock songs don't rock. This record's longest track, ""Mama Gina,"" clocks in at an appropriate 5:44, long enough to fully flesh out the song, but not so long that the groove gets tired. The only major objection here comes with the uninteresting, pretentious, but mercifully short ""New Number Order."" At 1:40, the track could easily have been left out. But as harsh and abrasive as it sounds, 1000 Hurts is an undeniably strong release. This album rocks hard, despite the fact that the man behind it is a squishy A/V club member with a bad attitude. So it seems that Albini's success as a producer hasn't greatly improved his personal life. Luckily, the same can't be said for his records.","A few days ago, a friend of mine asked what the difference between a film producer\n\ and a music ...

Jupiter,Cave In,by: Ryan Kearney,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a55e13d1975652138f2f/1:1/w_160/b33ab924.gif,2000-08-08 05:00:02,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1362-jupiter/,Hydra Head,"In a weekend fraught with poor decisions, this was by far the worst: I agreed to meet up with a few alumni friends at the college we graduated from last year. We ended up sitting around in once-familiar (now unfamiliar) campus houses, without even a buzz to speak of. While in one of these houses, I actually resorted to watching TV. VH1 was offering their, ahem, definitive list of the 100 Greatest Bands of Hard Rock, complete with James Hetfield and Henry Rollins, among others, waxing critical about the historical significance of second-rate tripe like Alice in Chains and Stone Temple Pilots. While I was nicely surprised by some inclusions-- Fugazi (#95), the Pixies (#81), Hüsker Dü (#68), and Jane's Addiction (#35), for instance-- I was mostly appalled. Like I didn't see it coming. First, there was the problem of order. Mötley Crüe are #29, while the Rolling Stones were covered only briefly at #67. Good one! There was also a noticeable lack of coherent determining criteria. Judging by their list, I'd guess the editors at VH1 consider the Red Hot Chili Peppers (#30) and Foo Fighters (#72) ""hard rock,"" but not David Bowie. There were, of course, countless other omissions, particularly in the area of punk. New York Dolls, the Stooges, and the Sex Pistols appear at numbers 60, 27 and 12, respectively. But Wire, Gang of Four, and Television-- all left out. And left out in favor whom? I've already mentioned four poor choices, and there are plenty more. Korn (#53), anyone? Looking down the list, it becomes apparent that VH1 really means ""heavy metal"" when it says ""hard rock"": Iron Maiden (#24), Pantera (#45), the Scorpions (#46), Slayer (#50), Megadeth (#69), Ratt (#79)-- and that's just a few. But people, please. Do I really need to continue after Ratt? Okay, one more: Quiet Riot (#100). The way some critics have drooled over Cave In's second true full-length, Jupiter, you'd think the band would be destined to make this list when VH1 revises it in 2010. Some company this Boston four-piece would have. But, in all seriousness, they'd fit right in-- from their music all the way down to their pomposity: visiting their website, you'll be met by a Shockwave Flash intro that reads, ""The future of music is on Jupiter. Perception will be altered. Preconceptions will be shattered. Jupiter has landed."" I believe Damon Albarn said it all with his timeless phrase, ""Woo-hoo."" I wish I could tell you what the site says after that, but it's so graphics-heavy that it ground my computer to a halt. Now replace ""site"" with ""album,"" and ""my computer"" with ""my brain"": this is how I responded to Jupiter. The album might betray fans of Cave In's earlier albums, 1999's Beyond Hypothermia (a collection of various sessions) and Until Your Heart Stops. Their metal roots are still apparent, but their new sound will, uh, shatter preconceptions. Their last release, the Creative Eclipses EP, hinted at this development, but only now have Cave In fully suffused their music with heavy prog and space-rock flourishes. Admittedly, the opening title track isn't much of a departure. ""Jupiter"" rips open with some standard chunky riffs while frontman Steve Brodsky gives it his trademark high-school talent show best with lines like, ""The metronome is wrong again/ My heart has surely gone and skipped a beat."" Only with the vocal mirroring of a Middle Eastern-style guitar lick does it become apparent that things are different this time around. The next track, ""In the Stream of Commerce,"" straddles the line. The chorus remains derivative hard rock, stuffed with present-day Weilandisms, but the verse offers lofty, reverberated guitar stylings and even a hackneyed falsetto. We all know who also sounds like this, so I'm not going to say the R-word. (Rush; #28) Jupiter moves further away from its metal leanings as it progresses. The seven-minute ""Big Riff"" contains just that, along with some guttural, ""I'm going to eat your children"" vocals, but, as suggested by its length, there's plenty of heads-down string-picking. During these moments, Cave In resemble a directionless version of Hum. Meanwhile, ""Innuendo and Out the Other"" is like a long, drawn out version of ""Black Hole Sun"" with no chorus; the nine-minute ""Requiem"" is more self-indulgent, um, post-metal-- only longer; ""Decay of the Delay"" is an angular, if overly consistent instrumental. And the closer, ""New Moon,"" moves from an acoustic opening to a raucous, metal climax. Which, as you know, has never been done before. If you still have a soft spot for heavy metal, but can't bring yourself to dig up those old Def Leppard (#31) records, Jupiter's just what you've been searching for. It's metal without the guilt; in other words, it's arty metal-- which is why some critics have embraced it (this, by the way, is also why Queens of the Stone Age have received so much undeserved press). But Jupiter actually makes me yearn for those old Leppard records, if only to hear the real thing.","In a weekend fraught with poor decisions, this was by far the worst: I agreed\n\ to meet up with ...

Singles and Beyond,Various Artists,by: Matt LeMay,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b9c55e6ef95969322a43/1:1/w_160/82ff3cc7.gif,2000-08-08 05:00:01,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5981-singles-and-beyond/,Emperor NortonKindercore,"I've always been suspicious of Elephant 6 musicians. First of all, they call themselves part of a ""collective."" When I think of a ""collective,"" my geeky mind immediately turns to the Borg. And while, as far as I know, the Elephant 6'ers aren't planning any kind of sinister interplanetary takeover, the comparison is quite appropriate. Elephant 6 artists, especially the Olivia Tremor Control, have managed to assimilate the better aspects of several genres-- from '60s pop and rock to electronica and R&B--; into an easy-to-stomach pop-tinted form. Still, ""collective"" may not be quite the right word. It's just too technical and non- descript. I looked it up, and Merriam-Webster defines a collective as ""a cooperative unit or organization."" Big deal. A bunch of my friends and I could sell lemonade on the street corner and call ourselves ""The Citrus 3 Collective."" That's no fun. No, the Elephant 6 Collective should be called ""The Cult of the Six Elephants."" That's right, cult. So what makes the Elephant 6 collective a cult? Mystery and intrigue. Almost every aspect of the Elephant 6 is a mystery wrapped in an enigma wrapped in a jewel case. Neutral Milk Hotel frontman Jeff Magnum has now supposedly joined the circus. A band called Frosted Ambassador, which I understand to be Olivia Tremor Control drummer Eric Harris' band, released an album which was supposedly discovered in a potter's shoebox. (Yeah, I know!) But as for the Olivia Tremor Control themselves, they've been relatively free of scandal. Frontmen Will Cullen Hart and Bill Doss have never shrouded themselves in any kind of mystery. Until now. For months now, rumors of an Olivia Tremor Control breakup have spread like wildfire. The band has stopped touring, Bill Doss is now working on his Sunshine Fix Project, and Elephant 6 message boards are buzzing with ""direct from the band"" breakup statements. And as if all this weren't a compelling enough argument that Olivia is about to bite the dust, the band has now presented their fans with Singles and Beyond-- a compilation of hard-to-find EPs, singles, and compilation appearances-- to remind us just how much Will and Bill will be missed. For relatively new Olivia-obsessives, Singles and Beyond is great. Highly sought-after early EPs such as The Giant Day, and the band's first release, California Demise, which dates back to when Jeff Magnum was still a member of the OTC, are compiled onto a single $12 CD. Also included are countless singles and compilation appearances, many of which have been all but unavailable until now. ""Love Athena"" and ""Today I Lost a Tooth,"" both from the California Demise EP, kick off Singles and Beyond with some of the best pop tunes ever written by the Olivias. Fuzzy guitars play indelible hooks while Hart and Doss sing abstract lyrics in heavenly harmonies. California Demise proves to be a record in the same vein as the group's first full-length, Dusk at Cubist Castle-- excellent lo-fi pop songs with a few well-placed bits of electronics and found noise. Additional highlights come with ""Beneath the Climb,"" from a long out-of-print Cassiel Records compilation, and ""I'm Not Feeling Human,"" from the Giant Day EP. Unfortunately, the odds-and-sods nature of Singles and Beyond prevents it from packing the same punch as the band's two full-length albums, Dusk at Cubist Castle and Black Foliage. Both of those records, particularly Black Foliage, were well-hinged epics, centering on indecipherable though clearly present themes. With each track, these records drew you in with a perfectly balanced blend of pop melodies and noisy arrangements. Adding to the overwhelming depth was the multi-faceted collage nature of the recordings. Bizarre sounds were referenced multiple times throughout the records, making familiar friends of these decidedly alien noises. Now, for the first time on an Olivia Tremor Control album, we're presented with a collection of songs instead of a full album, and the result is suitably less compelling. While Singles and Beyond may just be a collection of songs, it is nonetheless a collection of Olivia Tremor Control songs, and a must-have for any fan. For the first time in ages, fans can command a relatively complete collection of the band's singles and EPs without taking out a second mortgage. As for me, I'm stashing away the $12 I was planning to spend on the Giant Day EP in the desperate hope that someday soon there will be a brand spankin' new Olivia Tremor Control record for me to purchase. Unfortunately, my psychic inclination senses that this may be the band's final release.","I've always been suspicious of Elephant 6 musicians.

Here, leader David Pavkovic's ""securely tethered beast"" is Yoko Noge, whose Japanese avant-nightclub rants render Variant's opener, ""Absolutism 2,"" a tribal-- some might say ""pachydermal""-- throwback to art-rock's pre-history. ""Vacation"" again features Yoko, this time woolier still as the nonsense-spewing, blue velvet-sporting chanteuse fom a bar scene I'm relieved David Lynch had the good sense not to film. Pavkovic's drums stop and start jazzily enough in the dark heart of this number and his Oval-esque keys trickle along congruently. But when Yoko lumbers into Pavkovic's pauses, the experimentalist tone is punctured in ways all too familiar to those of us who never preferred John Lennon's ""better half."" ""Although the instruments often grew restless during rehearsals, the twelve musicians, comprising four tusk-tappers, four stomach-thumpers and four tail-twangers, became highly proficient at playing them."" Hmm... a fantastical modern mammoth orchestra. Toe (formerly Toe 2000-- modern!) comprises an ensemble just about as esoteric as Macauley envisions, but much less interesting to listen to. Pavkovic and Noge are joined by Tortoise phenom and consistently listenable Jeff Parker on guitar. His loose and understated phrasework opens ""Absolutism 1,"" but is brutally stampeded by Yoko Noge's unaccompanied intrusion just after the four-minute mark. The ubiquitous Doug McCombs contributes in your basic ""guy from Tortoise"" mode, his talents lost to over-sampling on ""Vacation,"" and later, to Yoko's mewling. And how sure were you that Tim Kinsella had already wasted enough of your time? Variant also manages to squeeze in his vocal panhandling. His pitiable melodrama masquerades as art on no fewer than three of these tracks, most notably ""Totalism."" A barely audible Kinsella whispers exactly the type of drivel I never want to hear again, timing his utterances to fill the sections of drum-machined lounge dirge not made hideous by Noge's croaking inane howling: ""You will perform a manuever/ To satisfy your reintroduction."" If I'm not trying very hard to translate exactly what Tim and Yoko are singing about, it's because, given the context, I couldn't give a shit less. ""The popularity of massed mammoth music reached its peak with the creation of the Mammoth Tabernacle Choir."" Right now, you're annoyed by my reliance on this gimmick to underscore the pointlessness of Toe's Variant. I'm guessing that's because you haven't actually heard Toe's Variant. Its vague and thinly composed drums-and-synth architecture sways in the wind of Noge's breathy pretensions, and topples due to its essential songlessness. Of ten tracks, only ""New"" commands any attention, a tinkled piano melody dusted over undulating bass and drums. The track recalls Sam Prekop's solo work, but is hardly on par with it. The same way David Macauley's idiotic, mastodon-concerned sidebars pointlessly interrupt an otherwise informative children's book, Toe (and Yoko Noge's avant-garbage, in particular) contributes nothing to the cause it aligns itself with. Like a joke you have to explain, Variant is very little effort, effortlessly wasted.","""While I do not profess to understand the 'modern' music, I have long been involved in the development of the ...

The abundance of musical proficiency, coupled with the lack of accessibility, tends to leave the listener saying: ""This sounds like shit! Is it shit, or am I too stupid to understand it? Is my whole life just a lie?!"" Enter Bablicon, Neutral Milk Hotel drummer Jeremy Barnes and his somewhat- demented posse, to prove to the world that bizarre, psychedelic jazz can still be offbeat, accessible, and more fun than an orchestra hit. Within the first moments of In a Different City, it becomes clear that Bablicon's music will be all but impossible to lump into any particular genre. Soprano sax spits pure treble, thumping rock bass rumbles like the San Andreas Fault, and Jeremy Barnes' manic barrage of drummery beats you into rhythmic submission. The elements combine to create a sound both artful and agreeable. Whether grooving on an ever-repeating bassline (""Francis Locrius"") or going off on an improvisational tangent (""The Green Line""), Bablicon toss almost Koufaxian curveballs, throwing the unexpected your way at the last second. Even with all the stylish improvisation, unconventional sounds, and throbbing bass guitar, the single most riveting aspect of Bablicon's sound remains Barnes' drumming. Barnes doesn't play the drums-- he assaults them. I saw Bablicon play live a few months ago, and at regular intervals, Barnes stood up, walked around to the back of his kit, and pummeled the shit straight out of it. By the end of the band's 45-minute improv jam, a pool of Barnes' sweat had accumulated in his snare, splashing up in his face with every beat. But despite their wealth of musical expertise, Bablicon never succumbs to pretentiousness. From the communal yelps and hollers of ""At the Birthday Party"" to what sounds like a distorted theremin on ""Rhinoceros,"" these guys never take themselves too seriously. The result is some of the most fun, generally wacky music that could ever be labeled ""experimental."" To the world, Bablicon will likely remain just one of a seemingly infinite number of Neutral Milk Hotel side projects, despite In a Different City's complete dissemblance to Jeff Magnum's nightmarish opuses. Instead, imagine a 15-foot tall yeti, with 18 drumstick-brandishing arms, a soprano sax in its mouth, and huge feet crushing every pretentious jazz musician in its path...","Nothing induces self-doubt quite like jazzy, experimental music.

"Spirit They're Gone, Spirit They've Vanished",Animal Collective,by: Brent S. Sirota,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a7355e6ef95969320f0c/1:1/w_160/c0705a22.gif,2000-08-01 06:00:01,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7940-spirit-theyre-gone-spirit-theyve-vanished/,Animal,"Anyone ever stumble across Struwwelpeter, the 19th century German children's book by Heinrich Hoffmann? Mark Twain himself translated it to English, although I doubt it made it to the bedside of too many American kids. This illustrated book is comprised of short lyrics describing the horrific things that happen to naughty children: Cruel Frederick is attacked by his own maltreated dog; Pauline plays with matches and burns to death while her cats watch; Conrad the thumbsucker winds up with his thumbs cut off by the red-legged scissor-man. I don't need to go on. There's something so downright un-American about the whole grisly affair, something alien about the gleeful proximity of children to violence and mutilation. Fortunately, I was a college German student when I encountered Struwwelpeter, and it freaked me out even then. Yet Spirit They're Gone, Spirit They've Vanished, the incredible but bizarre release by Avey Tare and Panda Bear brings the fates of those luckless kraut kinder back to mind. The marriage of psychedelia and fairy-tale imagery goes back at least to ""Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds""; Pink Floyd's Piper at the Gates of Dawn, the Dead's Aoxomoxoa: the first flowering of psychedelia was joyously regressive, celebrating juvenilia as the antidote to modern rationality. Yet what was indelibly excised was menace-- what the gnomes and newspaper taxis conceal. Remember the boat ride through the tunnel in the movie Charlie and the Chocolate Factory? In the middle of this sucrose wonderland, there's something fucking awful. Don't choke on the references. Forget them. Avey Tare and Panda Bear's Spirit They're Gone, Spirit They've Vanished is a masterful piece of electro-acoustic fairy-tale music; yet its squealing electronics, and vitrified rhythms suggest something darker. Like a Snickers bar with a razorblade in it. Spirit They're Gone is Avey Tare's album; he sings, and plays guitars, pianos, and electronics. Panda Bear, meanwhile, mans the crumpled percussion. The album opens with the high-frequency squall and delicate vocals of ""Spirit They've Vanished,"" offering little clue about future directions. However, the second track, ""April and the Phantom"" is crystallizing: expert acoustic guitars, fierce drumming and Daltrey-esque screams resemble the Who resurrected as the seventh member of the Elephant 6. Tinkling toy pianos, organs and exclamations of digital noise round out the track, while Tare perilously insists, ""She ran out of nature,"" again and again. The wistful ""Penny Dreadfuls"" lays simple piano over needled electronics reminiscent of Pita or Christian Fennesz in a kind of lysergic dirge on the end of childhood. ""Chocolate Girl"" is dubbed-out calliope music, swirling and swirling: a strange meditation seemingly on sexual awakening, awkward but erotic in the midst of an enchanted forest of an album. The interstellar Nintendo drone of ""Everyone Whistling"" is irresistible space-pop, backed by some incredibly nimble jazz drumming. The twelve-minute ""Alvin Row"" is an epic closer, emerging from free-noise clatter, insect electronics and demented piano into sunny Beatlesque psych-pop. ""Can you hear me, troubadour?"" Tare asks before the eruption of furious ivories. Schlock horror organs abound and the cymbals crash like storms. The album collapses into the crackly sample of a child (Alfalfa from the Little Rascals?) saying, ""My singing voice is gone... My singing voice is gone... My singing voice is gone..."" Spirit They're Gone, Spirit They've Vanished is not only outstanding, but one of the most original sounding albums out there. This record, as I've said, marries the pleasant and the violent and is not for timid ears: the sparkling pop never strays far from the lacerating noise. The lyrics are largely indecipherable but occasional gems and wonderful turns of phrase emerge from the bright din. Two mysterious fellow travelers (one-half of the four-man Animal collective) seem to have stumbled upon each other and created something truly beautiful. The only question is: which one of them is the walrus?",,8.9,
Faith and Courage,Sinéad O'Connor,by: Kristin Sage Rockermann,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b9a1eb335119a49ec81d/1:1/w_160/176c7430.gif,2000-07-31 05:00:08,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5944-faith-and-courage/,Atlantic,"I'm going to leave the Tibet situation in the capable hands of Perry Farrell and a couple of Beastie Boys, and dedicate this record review to those in Uzbekistan practicing the teachings of Sun Myung Moon. Yes, these 843 words mark my commitment to the Unification Church's struggle for Religious Freedom in the former Soviet Territories. Excuse my ridiculous gesture; it was inspired by the liner notes of Sinéad O'Connor's Faith and Courage, which state: ""Glory be to the Father and to the Son and to the Holy Spirit as it was in the Beginning. Is now and ever shall be. World without end. Jah! Rastafari! Read I! This record is dedicated to all Rastafari people..."" From Michael Stipe's sporting of a different politically correct t-shirt each time he took the stage to accept another award for ""Losing My Religion"", to Sting watering the rainforest with song, pop icons who self-righteously espouse over-simplified global politics bug me. I wasn't sure who ""the real enemy"" was-- and I don't know if Sinéad did, either-- when she thrilled the MTV newsdesk by tearing up a photograph of Pope John Paul II and shouting ""Fight the real enemy!"" after her a capella performance of ""War"" on an October, 1992 episode of Saturday Night Live. But a decade later, the Roman-Catholic-lesbian-priestess seems as confused as ever. While Faith and Courage is not as obviously embarrassing as Perry Farrell muttering, ""Like, torture is, like, crazy, man! Like, mothers are being, like, tortured!"" over the airwaves of the K-Rock-sponsored ""Radio Free Tibet"" broadcast, the album does begin with the line, ""I have a universe inside me,"" ends with, ""Christ have mercy,"" and somewhere in the middle, proclaims, ""I feel real cool and I feel real good/ Got my hair shaved off and black thigh boots.../ And I feel real hot when my makeup's nice."" Many adolescents go through mixed-up times, but most have the sense not to let Wyclef Jean remix their accounts of first love into a four-minute bowl of mush called ""Dancing Lessons"". And sure, many teens fight the power of standard English by using replacements like ""U"" for ""you,"" but they most likely didn't get the idea after cashing in on a Prince song. Most teens smash old hard-drives and burn their diaries in modesty and 20/20 hindsight; this diary is sold for $15 a pop to budding Earthmothers who quietly lurk in American suburbs, not quite fulfilled by Sarah McLachlan's last effort, but not quite ready for Juvenile. And Sinéad O'Connor is 33. The music is completely unremarkable, so let's discuss the lyrics. The opening track, ""The Healing Room"", is the lyrical witness to a spectacular biological feat: ""I have a healing room inside me/ The loving healers there, they feed me."" I remember when I first heard Whitney Houston sing about having the ""greatest love of all"" inside of her, thinking it sounded like a tumor. But that was the 80s-- it's a new millennium now, and Sinéad, in an attempt to be part of the solution, is womb to an entire hospital. The second song is titled ""No Man's Woman"". It's not like anyone thought she was a ""man's woman"" before. This song is similar to fellow countrywoman Paula Cole's work, only without the hilarious horsey antics, ""Yippy-eye, Yippy-yo!"" Those could have added a lot. ""Daddy I'm Fine"" is based on the premise that ""fine"" equals wanting to ""stand up tall with my boobs upright,"" while delivering a yearning whine that unconvincingly tries to be Neil Young, in a rhythm unfortunately similar to R.E.M.'s ""It's the End of the World as We Know It."" ""The Lamb's Book of Life"" states: ""If we listen to the Rasta man/ He can show us how it can be done."" Yes, Sinéad really says ""listen to the Rasta man."" Meanwhile, ""Emma's Song"" serves as the ultimate new-age cliché, involving goddesses, lovemaking, birthgiving, apologizing, Brian Eno's piano and production work, and more mentions of the healing room. Faith and Courage closes with the traditional ""Kyrie Eleison"", albeit ""radicalized"" with layers of rap and spoken word by Ghetto Priest, Junior Delgado, and Bonjo I. The music which accompanies it is Sinéad's standard fare of 80s torch balladry updated with some canned slow-jam beats courtesy of R&B; producer Kevin ""She'kspere"" Briggs (of Destiny's Child fame), and feathery symphonies of ""ooh-ahh's"" courtesy of market pressure and Lilith Fair influences. The cover art features pastels, contemplation, a trinity of little fires, and a glowing portrait of Sinéad. Remember how the aliens in the movie Cocoon glowed before they peeled off their skin at that geriatric bath house? That was cool. Sinéad's glow here warns of an inevitable Brian Dennehy-esque skin-peeling, and when it happens, she'll be putting her hand on the pulse of the Rasta man and transferring her life to him in a golden neon glow. All this faith, and courage for you, Rastafari people.","I'm going to leave the Tibet situation in the capable hands of Perry Farrell\n\ and a couple of ...

Har Mar Superstar,Har Mar Superstar,by: Meg Zamula,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c05813d197565213ba27/1:1/w_160/9558fc93.gif,2000-07-31 05:00:07,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3737-har-mar-superstar/,Kill Rock Stars,"Humor in music is kind of equivalent to breast size in choosing a girlfriend. It can be enticing, particularly when your judgment is impaired, but it's not enough to base a long-term relationship on. Sean Tillmann (aka Har Mar Superstar) can normally be found releasing cynically emotive music as Sean Na Na. Here, he adopts another silly alias (supposedly belonging to his younger brother, ""Harold Martin"") in order to release an album of R&B; songs with titles like, ""Girl, You're Stupid"". Har Mar comes off as the unholy offspring of New Edition's Ricky Bell, one of the less attractive members of 98 Degrees, and MC Paul Barman. Amazingly, it's not as unpalatable as it sounds. There's certainly plenty to poke fun at the ""urban"" genre, although the number of practitioners doing an adequate job of inadvertent self-parody makes this album somewhat gratuitous. One of the great overlooked R&B; twelve-inches of the past couple of years, TQ's ""Fuck Your Sister"", comes to mind. Its smooth love-jam stylings seemed innocuous enough until the chorus, when it became clear that TQ was actually soliciting his girlfriend to hook him up with her sister. Funnier still was the fact that the record included an instrumental version of the song. With competition like that out there, Har Mar is a bold project for Tillmann to undertake. The first track, ""Baby, Do You Like My Clothes?"" is an uncanny emulation of Color Me Badd, only in this case the sexing-up is on hold until baby improves her dated wardrobe. ""Hypercolor tells me where my baby is hot,"" Har Mar croons, ""'cause I can see her sweatpants getting dark in the crotch."" ""I Admit"" updates Berlin's late-80s hit ""Take My Breath Away"" with even cheesier keyboards and confessional boy/girl vocals, in which Har Mar and cohort Mandar come clean about brake-tampering and secret vasectomies. ""Brand New Day"" is Har Mar at his poppiest, an enjoyable concoction of xylophone, wacky samples, and plenty of Minnesota references. Despite the assistance of a number of collaborators-- most notably The Busy Signals, whose danceable beats serve as a foundation for Har Mar to rhyme over-- this album comes off fun but insubstantial. It's fundamentally a novelty record. In other words, you may want to take Har Mar Superstar home for a night or two, but there's not much chance you're going to be playing him for your parents a few months from now.","Humor in music is kind of equivalent to breast size in choosing a girlfriend.

In Name and Blood,Murder City Devils,by: Michael Sandlin,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c41313d197565213be8e/1:1/w_160/a172d5df.gif,2000-07-31 05:00:06,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5509-in-name-and-blood/,Sub Pop,"Question: where, exactly, does the Murder City moniker come from? Correct me if I'm wrong, but to my knowledge, there hasn't been a violent outbreak in Seattle since that overzealous Granola-muncher threw a brick through a Starbucks Coffee window in 1997. And why am I asking you? Like you know, or give a shit. Well. The Murder City Devils are a gore-obsessed group of aspiring homicidal maniacs-turned-Computer-Age-sensitive hard-rockers-- not to mention the official spokespunks of the American Nightmare. They're also an image-conscious band of splatterpunk method actors hammering out riff-heavy generic punk-metal designed with the intent to inflict serious bodily harm. 'Course, if these songs caused even slight allergic reactions in lab mice, the world might be better off. Instead, the Devils force you to reconsider the worth of forgotten early 90s grungepuppies like Helmet and Alice in Chains. True, though, these phony prophets of urban apocalypse and doom do have their cute side. So, with that said, we'll proceed with a thorough autopsy of the bloodied, mangled stiff of the album that is In Name and Blood. Singer Spencer Moody fuses the angry growls of Billy Idol, James Hetfield, Layne Staley, and the Cult's Ian Astbury into a single vocal amalgam that defies all logical possibilities of style appropriation and synthesis. The songs-- none of which are especially distinct-- all sport the same arrangements, chord progressions, and static tempos bumped along by clumsy drumkit-bashing. And, in a miraculous feat of economy, the Murder City Devils manage to squeeze out twelve 'different' songs from the same song. Even more amazing is how two guitar dudes riffing on the same heavy-duty power chords manage to sound like only one guitar dude riffing on heavy-duty power chords. What are the songs about? Just what you'd expect: kindergartners overdosing on refined sugar, a baseball player's suicide by baseball bat, beheaded babies, fatal paper cuts, amateur sheep-shearing contests, and unwanted puppies being doused with gasoline and set ablaze. They document the Devil's handiwork on Earth during the last 2000 years: all the carnage, famine, war, bestiality, and abject human suffering you can possibly imagine. That would be great wouldn't it? Sorry, kids. The lyrics are as harmless as a disgruntled school cafeteria lady wielding a gravy ladle. Just check out the gut-tearing sentiments of ""Lemuria Rising"": ""I wish you could have been a fly on the wall/ When I was twelve years old/ I would slit my wrists if it weren't for rock n' roll,"" roars Moody. For further enjoyment, here are some more memorable Moody word-power moments: ""She was the prettiest girl in an ugly town""; ""Every time I put my oars in your water/ I do it for the sailors""; ""You built a ship/ Put it in a bottle/ Then we watched it roll away."" Uh, like, when do all the bloody entrails and gouged eyeballs come into play, guys? I was shocked to learn that ""Somebody Else's Baby"" is not about a prison inmate whose wife just had another man's baby (see Merle Haggard). In reality, it's just another innocuous song about some dork getting dumped. As compensation, though, there's more mention of The Dark One on this record than in all of Ozzy Osbourne and Robert Johnson's output combined. And that's a lot of Dark One. These poor doomed souls simply get bogged down in too much muddy sludge-rock-- not to be confused, of course, with that elusive phenomenon known as punk rock. Hence, In Name and Blood whips little-to-no ass. In fact, most of these songs don't rock much harder than ""Rebel Yell,"" and many even seem to pay homage to it. Leslie Hardy's spooky Farfisa-toned organ does give the songs a certain camp-sinister ""Munsters""-theme quality, I suppose. But the only time the Devils live up to their namesake and commit actual murder is with their irony-laced disemboweling of Neil Diamond's ""I'll Come Running."" The nugget goes to show that the band actually does have a sense of humor, and a damned clever one, at that. It's a totally fresh concept: crappy neo-metal band does awful cover of unlistenable easy listening song. Hilarious! Get in line behind Screeching Weasel, boys. Conceptually, I'd say the Murder City Devils are pretty memorable. But the music? Well, I just finished listening to In Name and Blood about 10 minutes ago, and I've already forgotten what it sounds like. And that's pretty sad considering that I haven't even finished this review yet.","Question: where, exactly, does the Murder City moniker come from? Correct me if I'm wrong, but to my knowledge ...

No Style EP,King Biscuit Time,by: Ryan Schreiber,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Founder</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bba2eb335119a49ecaaa/1:1/w_160/4d01a91e.gif,2000-07-31 05:00:05,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4437-no-style-ep/,Astralwerks,"The Beta Band's Steve Mason is responsible for some of the most stunningly creative psychedelic music to come along in the last ten years, and with his full-time band in their prime, Mason seems brimming over with new ideas. The Beta Band are, thus far, best known for their 1999 compilation album, The Three EPs. Its borderline-folk melodies, inventive sampled and live percussion, acoustic guitar strumming, and bizarre special effects provided an airy, spacious foundation for Mason's warm, lazy vocals and infectious hooks. Detractors insist The Three EPs falls apart around the halfway mark, when the seven-minute jam ""The House Song"" and the colossal fifteen-minute montage ""Monolith"" materialize. But these songs, while far from being the band's most accessible pieces, exemplify the group's love for collage and their quest to map the unexplored regions of popular music. And if these songs initially seem overwhelming, the entirety of the album's third EP, Los Amigos del Beta Bandidos, offers the record's finest example of the band's capabilities to fuse unique technological experimentalism with rootsy, sing-along choruses. The band's self-titled, full-length debut came later in 1999, and while somewhat spottier than The Three EPs, it contains the band's greatest accomplishments. It's worth slogging through the sampled body-noise and unfocused dance beat of ""Dance O'er the Border"" and the overlong, if joyous, chant of ""Number 15"" to reach such apexes of musical innovation as the dark, reflective psychedelia of ""The Hard One"", and the blissful, ingenious beauty of ""The Cow's Wrong"", both impossibly beautiful works. But before all this, there was King Biscuit Time, frontman Steve Mason's less evolved, but equally sophisticated, solo project. In 1998, the group's own label, Regal, released Mason's first four-track EP, King Biscuit Time Sings Nelly Foggit's Blues in ""Me and the Pharoahs"". Now, after languishing in obscurity, Nelly Foggit's Blues has been reissued in America as the second half of the new King Biscuit Time EP, No Style. Nelly Foggit's Blues opens on what initially seems like a startlingly dated note, with a spastic jungle beat and quaking bursts of bass. But within seconds, Mason's distinct, casual baritone floats to the surface, soaked in boundless reverb and drug-haze. In under three minutes, he delivers a rapid sung/spoken novel with the ease and fluidity of the Dismemberment Plan's Travis Morrison. The track is balanced with muddy, nebular production. The sparse ""Little White"", which consists of a simple keyboard part and layered vocals, spotlights the detached emotion in Mason's lyrics that is often buried under piles of exploding effects. His indifference in the delivery of lines like, ""I'd love to love you/ But I'll never know you,"" is the secret ingredient that makes them so affecting. Nelly Foggit's Blues closes with ""Eye o' the Dug"", an early prototype of the Beta Band approach to creating music. Mason recorded four separate, sped-up vocal parts that harmonize and play off one another as if they're all different people practicing a song they're still learning the lyrics to. Of course, two years have passed since Nelly Foggit's Blues was released, and the intensive studio experience Mason gained while recording the massive Beta Band catalog is immediately identifiable. No Style is a decidedly less-Beta affair than Nelly Foggit's Blues-- it showcases Mason's knack for incorporating incomparable melodies into ethereal and surreal drugscapes, and for blending organic and treated sounds into a seemingly innate marriage of technology and nature. No Style's leadoff, ""I Walk the Earth"", is an upbeat excursion through labyrinthine dance rhythms and understated, multi-layered vocal parts that builds over six minutes into a highly melodic orgy of keyboard flourishes and attenuated chimes. The record's instrumental track, ""Untitled"", is far more focused than Nelly Foggit's Blues' meandering ""Niggling Discrepancy""-- it extracts a crystalline melody from warm, electronic pings more closely associated with \xB5-Ziq and early Squarepusher. ""I Love You"", on the other hand, takes all. The best of these eight songs, it features Mason professing his devotion over cascading xylophones, gently picked guitar, and hallucinogenic acoustics. Still, these EPs are less for the casual listener than they are for the die-hard. Though they feature a great deal of top-shelf material, the two Beta Band full-lengths attempt similar heroics to more successful effect. Of course, if you've already immersed yourself in The Three EPs and The Beta Band and hunger for more, there could be few better ways to spend $10.","The Beta Band's Steve Mason is responsible for some of the most stunningly creative psychedelic\n\ music to come ...

The band has the Drag City stamp of hipster approval, yet they get to make strutting, ballsy guitar rock that channels British Invasion blues, Nuggets-era garage, and mid-70s Aerosmith, all the while pretending that punk never happened. How did Royal Trux get so lucky, to have their ""Brown Sugar"" riff and play it, too? Maybe it's because some still look at what they do as some kind of ""commentary"" on tired rock conventions, so they slip under the post-modern radar. If earlier, more difficult Royal Trux albums drew from non-mainstream skronk traditions, the albums they've made since leaving Virgin and returning to Drag City have been taking dramatic strides toward Freedom Rock territory. Pound for Pound, their second full-length in less than a year, continues this trend. Oddly, it's both Royal Trux's most consistent record in some time and their least interesting. This means that while they avoid godawful eight-minute jams like ""Blue is the Frequency"" (from last year's Veterans of Disorder) that always seemed tacked on to court the Wire Magazine set, they also fail to produce any breakout, ass-blowing songs like ""I'm Ready"" or ""Yo Se!"". Instead, we get a capable, uninspired homage at FM rock history. And it is homage, never theft. The circular chord progression, Latin-tinged bass and goofy conga fills of ""Small Thief"" bear striking similarities to Santana's ""Black Magic Woman"", true, but Neil Hagerty and Jennifer Herrema put their own unmistakable spin on the formula and make it their own. Same goes for the long, spacy ""Deep Country Sorcerer"", which borrows bits of its melody from ""House of the Rising Sun"". But these so-so tunes aren't going to be popping up on anyone's mix tapes in three or four years, so all we're left with is a handful of memorable riffs: ""Platinum Tips"" has one almost Page-ian in its epic reach, but it lacks the round bottom of the master's finest. ""Sunshine and Grease"" spotlights chords that almost make you forget the banal lyrics. (Almost.) And ""Dr. Gone"" closes the album with a restatement of thesis, as the Trux drop a two-minute drum solo into the middle of a song the Carter-era J Geils Band would have been proud to call its own.

Spawned from the depths of Baltimore, Oxes capture the toughness of a city that isn't cosmopolitan or flashy, and has an overwhelming distrust of anything pretentious. The rock is raw-- ain't no two ways about it. Combining the more Storm and Stress side of Don Caballero's polyrhythmic finger-tapping, the balls-out roar of Big'N, and U.S. Maple's affinity for acoustic space and deconstructed riffs, Oxes have invented their own unique style of in-your-face rock. And I mean literally in your face-- they play wireless. Oxes make music that defies their being pigeonholed into existing genres, and by doing so, they defy the physical laws of punk rock. You won't find them hugging their amplifiers. In fact, you probably won't even find them in the same room with their amplifiers. The guitars rock with all the sharpness of Shellac, but these guys can do it while stepping outside for a little fresh air, or while pounding a few back at the bar. Wires are just another way for The Man to keep them down, and Oxes ain't havin' none of it. If this EP were comprised solely of Oxes material, it would have been a pretty flawless release. From the pulsing, siren-like screeching of the guitars on ""And Giraffe: Natural Enemies"" through the highly amusing, self-referential metaconversation on ""China, China, China"" (which features discussion about ""vintage"" candy bars, layered atop an ambient soundscape of feedback and noise), these Charm City ruffians have coughed up the most thoroughly enjoyable rock of recent memory. But mama said you should always share, and thus Oxes' three songs are countered by three from Chicago's now-defunct Big'N. Even though Big'N could throw down like a bloodier-throated Shellac, their songs just sound a bit dull in comparison with those of Oxes. Not bad by any means, but the teacher has once again been overshadowed by the student. If anything, these two bands complement each other brilliantly as an example of where this variety of raw rock has been, and where it's headed. ","Oxes. Oxes?

Strayed EP,Smog,by: Matt LeMay,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a47b9d034d5c69bf309d/1:1/w_160/c24f7aaf.gif,2000-07-31 05:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7279-strayed-ep/,Drag City,"Those of you living in New York City are probably all too familiar with the Cow Parade, the insipid cavalcade of decorative fiberglass bovines that now decorates the streets of the city. Much has been said degrading these motionless beasts, but in all honesty, I rather like the cows. Sure, they're ugly. Sure, the majority of them amount simply to cow-related corporate plugs. Shit, I can even get over the fact that the entire Cow Parade concept was snatched from Chicago, who originally stole it from Stockholm. But I like the cows because they make tourists look stupid. Of course, I'm looking at this from the point of view of a stuck-up native New Yorker. Yes, I realize that people who don't live here want to enjoy all that the city has to offer. But when it's Monday morning and I'm on my way to work, few things are more irritating than some asshole from Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan in an I Love New York t-shirt stopping directly in front of me and pointing in amazement at some completely uninteresting structure as if to say, ""Look! A moderately tall building! I've never seen one of those before! I must stand here directly in the middle of the street, taking many, many pictures!"" But though tourists look foolish having their pictures taken in front of even legitimate New York landmarks, nothing is less dignified than having your picture taken in front of a painted fiberglass cow. Just as fiberglass cows make tourists look stupid, ""Cow"", the 30-minute long b-side to Smog's Strayed single makes Drag City Records look stupid. When you started reading this, you probably thought we were stupid for running a review of a single from a record that we already covered several months ago. And believe me, I damn near passed up Strayed when I saw it for sale at my local indie record store. But upon examination of the disc, I was quite surprised to find-- denoted in small print on the back of the jewel case-- that the sought-after instrumental tape, ""Cow"", originally self-released in 1989, was featured as an extended b-side. So why didn't Drag City just issue ""Cow"", an eight-track instrumental noise epic, separately from Strayed? Who knows? Maybe after selling so many copies of Neil Hamburger's Left for Dead in Malaysia, they needed to stop making money for a while for tax purposes. Unfortunate business decisions aside, ""Cow"" is a thoroughly interesting listen. It can best be described as a guitar-centered romp through atonal improvisation. Sound textures range from brain-melting, low-frequency feedback to trashy plucked guitar strings. Over the course of its 30 minutes, ""Cow"" finds Bill Callahan extracting nearly every sound possible from his guitar. And while other sounds, such as sparse percussion, are occasionally added to the mix, ""Cow"" remains an entirely organic-sounding piece, unadulterated by cheesy synthesized instrumentation. For such a generally low-key recording, there's an inherent enthusiasm present here-- when Bill Callahan milks a great riff or feedback blast from his guitar, he exploits it for all its worth, applying slight variations in tone, texture, and timing, but maintaining the sound's general framework. I find it kind of amazing that ""Cow"" was released back in 1989. Two years before Spiderland, Bill Callahan was hinting at the complex guitar textures and drones that would become such an integral part of the post-rock scene. The touches of avant-garde experimentalism found on Smog's recent LPs have often been attributed to producers Jim O'Rourke and John McEntire. ""Cow"" makes it clear that Callahan himself is capable of piling on the experimentalism without the aid of a producer.","Those of you living in New York City are probably all too familiar with the Cow Parade, the insipid cavalcade ...

To try to quell my obsession, I've done everything from pasting pictures of Hitchcock's head onto Bowie's body, to hacking into hotel computers to make their reservations coincide. My plan almost worked, too, as Bowie did make obvious advances towards Hitchcock. Unfortunately, Hitchcock replied with a firm ""sod off"". Maybe it was the bum eye. Luckily, this infatuation of mine has finally come to a halt. It's a good thing, too; my next plot involved somehow irradiating the two pop legends, which might have proven harmful to both of them (and probably myself). Instead, I've settled for Destroyer, who have finally proven what months of madcap antics only suggested: a Bowie-Hitchcock hybrid would kick ass. Of course, this particular hybrid isn't perfect. At his best, frontman Daniel Bejar sounds like Robyn Hitchcock singing David Bowie songs with Guided by Voices lyrics. At his worst... well, at his worst he sounds exactly the same, only worse. (How's that for critical insight?) The portions of Thief that prominently feature Bejar's talents as a vocalist and songwriter never fail to please, but when his bandmates step into the spotlight, it's the listener that gets burned. Thief opens with the very Hitchcock-esque ""Destroyer's the Temple"", a track which has already reached cult hit status on college radio stations across the country. Over plucked nylon guitar and rumbling bass, Bejar yelps lines like, ""Though the solitudes have won, I cannot begin to crave you/ Please spring us, Madeline, from the rusty jails of lust we live in."" What's he talking about? I don't care. He sounds like Robyn Hitchcock's demented Canadian half-brother, and that's pretty damn cool. But just when you think you've got Destroyer pegged as a Soft Boys cover band, strands of Bowie DNA begin to pop up in Bejar's genome. ""Canadian Lover/Falcon's Escape"" is a perfect example of Bejar's formula, going from a laidback Hitchcock acoustic number to an (early) Bowie sonic barrage, with added bits of harpsichord and heavily altered guitar sounds. Yes, the first five songs on Thief rock. Unfortunately, the sixth, ""Every Christmas"", shatters any shot the album had at being all-around excellent, and from that point on, the record is a mixed bag. High points like ""In Dreams"" mesh with wanky instrumental filler like ""I.H.O.J."" and ""M.E.R.C.I."" It's hard to believe that someone capable of cranking out an excellent pop tune like ""The Way of Perpetual Roads"" cannot realize that these songs sound like shit. My advice to Bejar: keep the band. Just don't let them out of their cages.","If you're anything like me, you've probably stayed up late many a night wondering what the bastard offspring ...

Transcendental Blues,Steve Earle,by: Ryan Kearney,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bbdaeb335119a49ecb27/1:1/w_160/0e34df84.gif,2000-07-31 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2645-transcendental-blues/,ArtemisE-Squared,"I could begin this review by invoking one or two of the more renowned transcendentalists of the 19th century. You know how it would it go: ""In Walden, his masterpiece of transcendent ideology, Henry David Thoreau wrote, 'I went to the woods because I wished--"" I don't even need to finish the sentence, do I? Quoting from Ralph Waldo Emerson's Nature might be more tactful, but barely. His lecture, The Transcendentalist, is a more obvious, if less-cited source, but the quotes are all too vague. Invoking these writers would be too easy, too obvious, and certainly too academic, not to mention slightly inaccurate: ""Transcendentalism"" was a spiritual movement; Steve Earle simply has ""transcendental blues,"" which is quite different. Therefore, I'm not going to start my review in such a way. Now, I could pull out Webster and define ""transcendental"" for you, but that wouldn't suffice because the definition, by its very nature, precludes a definitive definition. Earle, likewise, struggles with the idea of transcendence in his liner notes. He humorously contests one definition-- ""the act of going through something""-- by writing, ""Ouch. I see plate glass windows and divorces."" Finally, he arrives at the conclusion that ""transcendence is about being still enough long enough to know when it's time to move on."" But I don't want to start with liner notes, either. So maybe I should tell a personal story of dubious relevance, as is my wont. There's the time I awoke at midnight at 11,000 feet on Mt Rainier. The full, blue moon ignited the top layer of the endless cloud a few hundred feet below us-- a sight I've never seen outside of an airplane. Or maybe I could tell the story about when I hallucinated atop a cemetery hill. I walked in a tight circle for almost an hour because, as I explained later, ""I needed to reassure myself of my physical presence in the world."" But that's my literary crutch, so I musn't indulge. Which leaves me with a final instance of transcendence: the album itself. The title track opens the record with a harmonium that's quickly interrupted by-- yes-- a bleep. But after some soft thumping reminiscent of Yo La Tengo's latest, the song progresses into the exemplary roots-rock that one expects from Earle, replete with lines like, ""Happy ever after 'til the day you die/ Careful what you ask for, you don't know 'til you try."" Maybe because he doesn't want to surprise the listener, Earle waits a bit before displaying his expanded sound. The next two tracks continue in a similar roots-rock vein, although each is decidedly unique. Then, in a single stroke of apparent ease, Earle delivers ""I Can Wait,"" a dead-on excursion into the reflective, laid-back country groove the Jayhawks have made a career of. Earle finally breaks out with the Cash-ian ballad ""The Boy Who Never Cried."" As Earle's unaccompanied voice establishes the story of the boy, a harmonium again rises up, soon joined by a unobtrusive 12-string. But as the song builds, Earle slowly infuses it with perfectly placed, emotive orchestral hooks. Then, all is stripped down as he delivers the clincher in a strained, Dylan-esque fashion: the boy lived alone until death, at which point, ""He shed a single tear for a boy who never cried."" After a couple of Irish jigs (of sorts), the pace slows down again for ""Lonelier Than This,"" which, in its subtle power, is on par with early Springsteen. Likewise for ""Halo 'Round the Moon,"" a song that checks in after a few more top-shelf roots-rockers. ""Until the Day I Die"" is another valiant attempt at creating a bluegrass classic worthy of Mr. Monroe (one of Earle's professed goals). After ""All of My Life,"" an invigorating italicized rock song, the album is rounded out by ""Over Yonder (Jonathan's Song),"" a plaintive, mandola-sprinkled epitaph of sorts with a fitting, regretful conclusion: ""Shinin' down on all of them that hate me/ I hope goin' brings 'em peace."" Earle's music doesn't simply mirror the transcendence of its creator; it lends transcendence to the listener as well, as all excellent music will. But what truly makes this one of Earle's best records is that he refuses to be pulled down by musical decisions. It's as if he never faced a problem of whether or not to add this or that instrument, or to veer off in this or that direction. He simply had the idea and went with it. This is one manifestation of transcendent thought: there's no such thing as indecision because an idea necessarily ignites action.","I could begin this review by invoking one or two of the more renowned transcendentalists of the 19th century.

The Orange Tapered Moon,Bablicon,by: Mark Richardson,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a1e49d034d5c69bf2a75/1:1/w_160/207e938c.gif,2000-07-27 06:01:40,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/508-the-orange-tapered-moon/,MisraMisra,"Though they have loose ties to the Elephant 6 scene (drummer and leader Jeremy Barnes is a member of Neutral Milk Hotel), nobody's going to compare Bablicon to the Olivia Tremor Control or the Apples in Stereo. They're primarily an instrumental outfit that thrives on energetic improvisation, so more apt '60s comparisons would be Frank Zappa or Captain Beefheart's Magic Band. Even the Beefheart resemblance, which evokes an image of wide-ranging experimentation, is probably too limiting as Bablicon dabble in thoroughly modern ambient music and noise textures as well, working their way through a huge library of musical toys with both joy and skill. This kid-in-a-candy-store approach to raw sound is a huge part of this record's appeal, as the obvious pleasure Bablicon derive from making music together carries over to the listener. But if enjoying this record is easy enough, describing it is a bit tough. The elements that the trio deploys in the studio are many-- bass, piano, drums, xylophone, organ, electronics, saxophones, melodica, and surprisingly, no guitars-- and they use them all in unconventional ways. Drums sound beaten with hammers, piano strings are plucked by hand, keyboards are run through distortion pedals, and the arrangements are all screwy. The amazing thing, though, is that while this sounds like a formula for chaotic noise, it actually coalesces into highly listenable music with catchy melodies, deep, jazzy drumming and wide dynamics. ""Anne on an Infibulus"" is a good example of the band's range. It begins with a random mish-mash of sound, then steers subtly toward a three-note bass pattern that propels the song into driving trance rock territory. Finally, it fades into some kind of dreamy thumb piano coda. ""An Orange Moon"" swings almost as hard, working through squelching electronics over a fuzzy bass riff and forceful drumming, arriving at a dark, brooding organ pattern vaguely reminiscent of Booker T. and the MGs. Variety is the order of the day throughout The Orange Tapered Moon, from the Carl Stalling horn figures of ""210(2)"" to the gorgeous prepared piano on ""The Well Tempered Alligator."" And, like true showmen, the band saves the best for last. The latter half of ""An Orange Pumpkin Glowing Music Ensemble,"" the album closer, is a glorious saxophone symphony that gazes skyward like spiritual free-jazz icon Albert Ayler. It's a moving finish to an excellent record.","Though they have loose ties to the Elephant 6 scene (drummer and leader Jeremy Barnes is a member of Neutral ...

4 Ton Mantis EP,Amon Tobin,by: Matt LeMay,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a7c9b1335d7bf1699114/1:1/w_160/c1d3166b.gif,2000-07-25 05:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8087-4-ton-mantis-ep/,Ninja TuneNinja Tune,"I was a bit wary of approaching Amon Tobin's new 4 Ton Mantis EP. I was under the impression that when a label releases an ""EP"" consisting of a single, a remix of that single, a few remixes of another track on an already-released full-length, and one unreleased single, the purpose is simply to hype the given single and give club DJs some more danceable variations on tracks they've already been spinning. But Amon Tobin is a special case. In many ways, his music could be characterized as a remix of music in general, taking what he considers to be the most interesting elements of everything ranging from cheeseball spaghetti western soundtracks to blistering funk, and combining them to create something uniquely his own. Such is the case with the best remixes-- artists work with original music they didn't create to leave their own indelible mark on it. Roots Manuva's remix of ""Saboteur"" is a prime example of the remix as an artform. By weakening the rhythmic skeleton that held up the track in Tobin's original mix and adding a vocal track, Manuva has turned ""Saboteur"" into a song that, while completely different, is true to the original in spirit. UK DJ Bonobo's remix of ""4 Ton Mantis"" is equally compelling. Like Manuva, Bonobo has reworked the track from the rhythm up, shifting accents and re-shaping the song's percussive elements into a familiar yet decidedly original soundscape. The fact that these remixes work so well is testament to the amazing density of Tobin's music-- there are enough sonic nooks and crannies in his tracks that multiple DJs can remix them and come up with completely original results. Not to be shown up, Amon himself contributes one track to this EP, the excellent ""Yards."" ""Yards"" is classic Tobin-- hyperactive, rhythmically complex, and funky as all hell. I find it deliciously ironic that Tobin has recently become the poster boy for intelligent dance music. Tracks like ""Yards"" make it abundantly clear that no intelligent human being would ever attempt to dance to this type of music, at the risk of winding up with a severe case of whiplash. So perhaps I misjudged this type of remix EP. Sure, like anything, the remix can be a tool of evil. But when left to an experienced professional, a remix can provide a fresh take on already-fresh material, and it just doesn't get much better than that.","I was a bit wary of approaching Amon Tobin's new 4 Ton Mantis EP.

The second stupidest preachment in popular culture: ""Punk lives."" John Samson is a couple records deep into his career as strongest of the Weakerthans, a band who are punk politically, but emphatically pop aesthetically. Regardless, the ""punk: dead or alive?"" quandary will likely dog him forever. Samson played bass in Propagandhi who were either lame-o peace-punk latecomers or brilliant protest rock of the first order, depending on your position along several endlessly complicated cultural and personal axes. If you're inclined to call ""Nailing Descartes to the Wall/(Liquid) Meat is Still Murder"" a great idea for a song title, you probably love the Props, but it's just as likely you prefer to get your politics explained and/or affirmed by people other than rock bands, in which case Propaghandi may well have grated on your nerves. In either case, Propaghandi may have answered the ""alive or dead"" question, but it's impossible to say uniformly which answer they indicated. Samson, who writes, sings and plays a host of instruments in the Weakerthans, seems to have shed most of his previous band's preachy trappings, as well as their punky ones. Cynical wags might like to call the Weakerthans emo, since Left and Leaving is ass-deep in ballads about ""the outstanding bills of my heart."" But, despite a critic's deepest categorical longings, the tag doesn't exactly fit. Where emo emphasizes baroque song structures and wall-of-sound dynamics, Samson and company produce what often sounds like de-fanged pop-punk. All midtempo rhythms and three-note hooks, Left and Leaving is unwilling to give up the mohawked ghost. Emoizers like to talk a lot of game about elevating or artifying punk rock, but the Weakerthans are more preoccupied with using the form's greatest strengths. Even the weirdest stuff here speaks with gut-level urgency. Though the band's work so far does bespeak boredom with punk's formal constraints, the Weakerthans don't experiment for the sake of experimentation alone, which is both their saving grace and greatest flaw. Thankfully, none of the arrangements on the album seem motivated by the need to prove that Samson is a savvy, sophisticated guy after all (even on the one that starts out kinda sounding like Cat Power), but that contentedness with middling ambition can make the record sort of a trudge to sit through. Without ideas oozing from every pore, Left and Leaving remains a well-executed, acceptably anthemic rock record with its share of hooks and pleasantries. And unless a listener is positively convinced they don't have enough of those, it's not quite worth endless spinning. Left and Leaving isn't a new world to visit and explore; it's a postcard from a friend on vacation. Which is why it might be worth it to put the question to Samson and his distinguished panel whether punk survives into the present day. The Weakerthans seem to imply it's somewhere in between. Punk remains a frustratingly limited genre, but from its calcifying rules and orders, people are crafting oddball pleasures like this one. Whether punk is dead, alive and well, or not yet born doesn't really matter here. You can take your pick. Just throw it a wake, a birthday party or a baby shower. And whatever you do, sing along.","The stupidest preachment in popular culture: ""Punk is dead.""

The man accentuated his cheesy influences-- Barry White, Prince, lounge pop-- with in-your-face concoctions of spliced foreign film and blaxploitation soundtracks. And he topped it all off by looking like Beck's emaciated Polish cousin and riding a white stallion to gigs. What's more, Tenor had buckets of credibility from electronic mainstay Warp Records and was poised to bring his vision to the masses with a Matador distribution deal. Last year's Organism was pretty good. This year's Out of Nowhere relatively sucks. Where, one might ask, did it all go wrong? It may have something to do with the fact that Tenor tucked away his sampling equipment for this one, opting instead to command a 55-piece orchestra (as the promotional packaging so proudly boasts) to realize his lofty pseudo-soundtrack ambitions. Where's the blatant intergalactic funk? You'd think he'd stick to what he's good at, but whatever. Let's judge his wares. The title track slides along quietly, almost trying not to draw attention to itself; it's ambient for the most part. The 55-piece orchestra only occasionally rears its ugly head to blare a few powerful notes, overwhelming the slight choral backing that appeared to help the track on its way. It becomes ominous by the end, but not to momentous effect. The skittering tabla rhythm and sitar swing of ""Hypnotic Drugstore"" follows, and is the first occurrence of a pronounced Bollywood influence. It's got groove potential, but Tenor's sorry vocal-- never his secret weapon-- pulls the rug from under its shoddy feet. Piano tinkles herald the humdrum white-soul ambience of ""Paint the Stars,"" less a showcase of Jimi's compositional assets than of his orgasmic vocal pretensions. An understated sax track later, we come to the first bonafide highlight of this ""ambitious"" and ""cinematic"" work, ""Blood on Borscht."" While Tenor is no John Barry or Ennio Morricone, this track does provide Out of Nowhere with its one suitably insistent, memorably cinematic theme, apparently for a film that could have used a lot more blood-spilling. As an added bonus, it exploits the latent potential of the 55-piece orchestra moreso than any of the previous tracks. ""Backbone of Night"" relapses into Bollywood atmospherics, heightened by some late orchestral flourishes upon which Tenor lays a heavily treated but perfunctory vocal. ""Spell"" finally cuts the crap and delivers the funking ass-swing. The most welcome and catchy vocal on the album, Tenor coos, ""And I knew you'd be my baby/ When I saw the mole on your thigh,"" over a velvet party track. There may be a string section lingering somewhere in the background, but the song is the solid product of some elastic bass, a tight hip-swinging backbeat, and a disco chorus. Damn fine. One of the final lyrical salvos on Out of Nowhere is ""Bear with me, baby/ I'll keep it together."" I only wish that were true. Having braced myself for some shocking sci-fi porno-funk-- or, at the very least, some deft Shaft-esque usage of the mammoth 55-piece orchestra-- I was ultimately greeted with the most boring, least outrageous album Jimi Tenor has produced. A bewildering, unconvincing piece of work, it's hard to determine exactly what the point of this record is. Put simply, a personality like Jimi Tenor has no right to be this unremarkable.","Jimi Tenor was the first and last hope for offensively distasteful electronic music.

For whatever reason, these records tint every thought with their own unique spirit. I was born and raised in New York City. I've never been farther south than D.C. But when Voice Brother and Sister plays, I think back to days I spent as a child of seven years, sitting in a rocking chair on the back porch of my grandma's house in Georgia, spitting watermelon seeds through the gap between my two front teeth. Up until now, the majority of Athens, Georgia musicians have been about as far removed from true ""southern music"" as a Canadian hip-hop DJ. On Voice Brother and Sister, though, Summer Hymns fuse the dense pop stylings of fellow Athens musicians the Olivia Tremor Control with a distinctly southern, banjo-tinged flavor. The result is one of the most accessible albums to come out of the Athens psychedelic scene in a long time. Voice Brother and Sister opens with a very Olivia Tremor Control-inspired 48 seconds of impenetrable sound collage. Thankfully, those few seconds quickly give way to a series of spectacular country-tinged psychedelic rock tracks. Summer Hymns' music is characterized by plucky banjo motifs, layered instrumental textures, dramatic dynamics changes, furious percussion, and singer Zachary Gresham singing schoolyard melodies in his laid-back, vaporous tone. But what really sets the band apart is their meticulous attention to detail. As carefully arranged as these songs are, Voice Brother and Sister never feels cold or calculated. On tracks like ""Mr. Brewer (Crackle, Crackle),"" and ""Stick Your Tail in the Wind,"" gentle banjos, guitars, and xylophones join together in a hazy backyard jam session. You can almost see the fog coming out of your speakers. The album's highlight comes with ""New Underdressment."" The song opens with a simple guitar part and vocal melody before bluegrass violins and additional vocal tracks slowly penetrate the mix. The number of individual melodies buried just beneath the song's surface is astounding. A lesser band could have picked apart each beautifully dense track on the album into about 20 generic psych-pop tunes. But Summer Hymns made a conscious decision not to release a album until they felt that each song lived up to its full potential, and Voice Brother and Sister is that much better for it.","Once in a great while, an album actually transforms memories.

Until Tim Harrington's essence can be distilled into convenient CD form, the intensity of the Les Savy Fav live performance can be revealed only to those who actually get a chance to see it with their own eyes. On Rome (Written Upside Down), it appears that the band themselves have finally reached this conclusion as well, and the result is without a doubt their most compelling and engaging record yet. Rome marks Les Savy Fav's first release since the departure of guitarist Gibb Slife. As a result, the majority of the EP is much tighter than any of the group's previous outings. But while the absence of a second rhythm guitar does occasionally thin out their sound, impeccably placed synthesizers and overdubbed vocals fill in the gaps, resulting in a double-barreled assault of concentrated, fiery energy that Les Savy Fav were never able to achieve with their previous two-guitar lineup. ""I.C. Timer"" kicks off the EP with multi-tracked vocals, broken rhythms, and synthetic bleeps. As Tim Harrington sings, ""God bless the cyborgs at your door.../ It feels like it's been here se-se-seventy times before,"" he opts not to attempt a Daltrey-esque stutter, instead applying a digital skip effect. While the band's previous records have featured some electronic manipulation on a much smaller scale, this unpredictable break in the band's natural flow comes as a very welcome surprise. Rome also marks the first time Les Savy Fav have managed to pull off some genuinely moving-- as opposed to merely ass-moving-- moments. The lack of a second guitarist has driven Tim Harrington's vocals even farther up in the mix, and his singing here is more versatile than it's ever been. On ""Asleepers Union,"" Harrington delivers the line, ""It broke the backs of the trees in the forest/ It brought the rats to their knees in the city,"" with a masterfully executed whimper, and every minor imperfection in his voice contributes to a remarkably warm, organic delivery. ""In These Woods"" and ""Hide Me from Next February"" are classic Les Savy Fav, complete with fractured beats, driving basslines, and fragmented guitar parts. The record's title track and closer combines rigid, distorted drumming and controlled feedback, and ends the disc at new, previously unreachable heights with jagged riffs and a blissful cymbal crash. Rome (Written Upside Down) presents this Providence, Rhode Island four-piece with a beautiful future-- one in which their records present an experience which, though an alternate dimension away from their live shows, is every bit as fascinating.

Sunflower/Surf's Up,The Beach Boys,by: Hefner Macauley,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a0bc5e6ef9596932000b/1:1/w_160/471591cc.gif,2000-07-18 05:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11665-sunflowersurfs-up/,CapitolCapitol,"Let's do this. It's the summertime, and we're coming off of a decade-long re-evaluation of the Beach Boys' legacy. It just doesn't stop. If you thought it began and ended with Pet Sounds, keep thinking, buddy. The long out-of-print Beach Boys albums of the '70s have finally been salvaged and remastered by Capitol from the dregs of the Reprise/Brother catalog. Without question, the resurrection of the Beach Boys in a vibrant critical and commercial capacity was a significant retrospective development of music in the '90s. Pet Sounds becomes, now that we think about it, arguably the greatest pop production ever; a box set commemorating the album and the group's legacy are released and uniformly lauded; pop groups everywhere shamelessly draw inspiration from the acid-tinged barbershop quartet arrangements; a handicapped Brian Wilson even manages to release something of a comeback. With this extensive overhaul, it's right to expect some chafe only zealots with fat wallets could feel compelled to purchase. But such is not the case with this particular release, which pairs up the two first and best artifacts of the slow, golden sunset of the Beach Boys' decline. Sunflower marked a fresh start for the band as they left Capitol and established their own label with Reprise, eager to capitalize on the arrangement and recapture an audience that had deserted them. Perhaps the strongest album they released post-Pet Sounds, the group dynamic (no longer as Brian Wilson-focused) reinvigorated the production and songwriting remarkably. The thematic and lyrical content is suitably eccentric and cheesy at times, but that element is as much a part of the work of the Beach Boys as musical innovation. Dennis Wilson demonstrates impressive songwriting range from rockers ""Slip On Through"" and ""It's About Time"" to beaut-ballad ""Forever"" and the oddity ""Got to Know the Woman,"" where his lasciviousness gets a bit unruly. Brian Wilson hadn't become completely marginalized at this point, however. He still makes most of the songwriting contributions here, standouts of which are the proto-shoegazer ""All I Wanna Do,"" the driving ""This Whole World,"" and ""Add Some Music to Your Day,"" which manages to sound nothing like Fugazi but whose sentiment is the most punk-rock the group recorded. But despite Sunflower's merits and critical acclaim, it was not a financial success, which didn't bode well as the inauguration of the Beach Boys' brand new era. Some say out of strife and tension comes the best music, and while this doesn't apply to the band's follow-up, Surf's Up, at least it can be said that they got one last good record in there before they really started sucking. Surf's Up's cover art says all that needs to be said about the mood: painted in mournful blues and greens, a Don Quixote-like figure slouches heavily on an emaciated horse. Underscoring the irony of the title, Endless Summer this is not. The most interesting moments of musical texture are provided by an occasional use of synthesizers. Content-wise, the album ostensibly addresses pressing environmental, social and health concerns, but songs like ""Don't Go Near the Water"" and ""Lookin' at Tomorrow (A Welfare Song)"" are as much a reflection upon the group's fortunes as they are upon the world's. Most touching about the album is Brian Wilson's suite-like three-song contribution as the album's closing, clearly influenced by Paul McCartney's suite on Abbey Road. By now truly marginalized, the first two tracks document his resignation to fall away. ""A Day in the Life of a Tree"" opens with the lines, ""Feel the wind burn through my skin/ The pain, the air is killing me,"" and on the organ driven ""Til I Die,"" he laments being ""a cork on the ocean/ Floating over the raging sea."" The magnificent title cut closes the album, a track salvaged from the legendary aborted Smile sessions. ""Surf's Up"" was intended as the ""A Day in the Life"" of the classic album that wasn't, and here it shines through in all its glory, from Van Dyke Parks' skewed lyricism to the celestial ""child is father to the man"" coda. It's likely to be the best reissued track you hear all year.","

Weekends of Sound,764-HERO,by: Ryan Kearney,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a3ab5e6ef959693206c7/1:1/w_160/caf03c9b.gif,2000-07-18 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7079-weekends-of-sound/,UpUp,"Almost exactly six years ago, during my first trip to the Pacific Northwest, I found myself sitting with a few friends at a wooden picnic table somewhere in Washington. It was Saturday, but kids weren't playing on the nearby field, and no adults strolled by. The uniform gray concrete at our feet was a mirror to the sky. We were damp and heavy, buoys suspended in the thick cold fog. I picked at the peeling green paint on the sodden table; thick splinters of wood came up instead. I'd never been in that town before, but it seemed eerily familiar. ""What's this place called again?"" I asked. A friend replied, ""Aberdeen."" Where had I heard that? The table slowly deteriorated before me. I'd created a miniature canyon in its surface before realizing I was in Kurt Cobain's hometown. So this is why he killed himself... After grunge hit the mainstream, there was so much discussion of the Pacific Northwest's supposed depression-inducing effects on local music that the area's gloomy conditions became synonymous with the music scene. But when a bunch of bands with similar sounds all come from a particular area, I don't buy that it has anything to do with the temperature and humidity. Sure, the more recent bands to emerge from the region (Built to Spill, Elliott Smith, Modest Mouse, Death Cab for Cutie, etc.) share some similarities with the climate, but had I never heard of, say, Quasi, and someone played them for me, asking where I thought they hailed from, I wouldn't have known. And if I had, it'd have been based on a resemblance to other artists from the area, not the 7-day forecast. But ah! An exception. 764-HERO is the perfect soundtrack for their homeland. Maybe the band knew this when they formed, and named themselves after the Washington state hotline to report carpool lane violators to firmly establish their geographic origins. But they were different back in those days-- just a two-piece with drums, a guitar and vocals on their 1996 debut, Salt Sinks and Sugar Floats. In 1998, they picked up Red Stars Theory bassist James Bertram and joined Built to Spill producer Phil Ek in the studio to record the more varied, but occasionally aimless, Get Here and Stay. Now, on their third full-length, Weekends of Sound, the band showcases their strengths and improves upon their weaknesses, making it their most accomplished work to date. Vocalist/guitarist John Atkins still sings as if fatigued by emotion, and the band's sound isn't remarkably different, but various touches make them sound richer than ever. The crisp production also remains, thus proving to those still unsure that Phil Ek is one of indie rock's best. On ""Out like a Light,"" Atkins is backed during the chorus by Bertram's cascading vocals, making the lines, ""It's your turn to listen/ Yeah, you will,"" sound not just casually antagonistic, but cathartic, too. Atkins' distant howl on ""Leslie"" and the accompanying soft, reverberating guitar strums raise the song from a potentially forgettable lull to an otherworldly drift. 764-HERO's critics often label them as a moodier, lazier Built to Spill, and that seemed somewhat accurate on Get Here and Stay. But on Weekends of Sound, the band aspires to new heights, best illustrated by their nine-minute epic, ""Left Hanging."" The track begins with quiet chimes and casual note picking, and slowly builds until a rising guitar takes over for a chorus that makes room for both poppy handclaps and Atkins' distorted larynx-thrashing. Even Atkins' often maudlin lyrics have been refined. ""Summer takes your hand/ 'This part's scary,'"" he sings sarcastically on the title track. He retains the sincere lyrics that endeared him to many fans, but he no longer sounds helpless or despondent, as exemplified by the song's next lyric: ""We're so tired of weekends of sound/ And you will sit down, shut up and keep it honest."" And for those who crave it, a couple of songs here-- ""You Were the Long Way Home"" and ""Something Else""-- are standard, sentimental 764-HERO, with Atkins singing on the latter, ""October came too soon/ And I'm left wondering why."" That the band has improved, and that they still fit their home climate, is apparent from the very first track, ""Terrified of Flight."" The song opens with a drumbeat that pistons back and forth, a high hat like rushing water, and a submerged, beguiling bassline. ""Night keeps going/ We keep standing still,"" sings John Atkins in tonal alignment with his guitar. Soon thereafter, he narrates, ""Minutes later, we don't hear a sound.../ We don't notice all the passing time/ We were in the sight/ Terrified of flight."" This music is Washington as dark sets in: the fog dampening all sound, and melancholia seeping into our every pore.","Almost exactly six years ago, during my first trip to the Pacific Northwest, I found myself sitting with a few ...

Mass Suicide Occult Figurines,John Vanderslice,by: Nick Mirov,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a914c0084474cd0c0f82/1:1/w_160/ded21711.gif,2000-07-11 05:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8401-mass-suicide-occult-figurines/,Barsuk,"""Everybody's got screwed up stories/ Everybody's got gruesome details,"" sings John Vanderslice. ""But you'll never get mine/ It's not that bad/ It could never justify my life."" Having followed Vanderslice's musical activities for the past few years, I've learned a couple of things about him-- not the least of which is that you should take anything he says with a grain of salt, as his penchant for Negativland-style media pranks all but equals his zeal for exceptionally well-crafted pop songs. As frontman for the underrated and largely unknown (outside of the San Francisco area, at least) MK Ultra, he's pulled fast ones on the local news outlets such as claiming that the band's 1996 release Original Motion Picture Soundtrack was actually meant to be a soundtrack to a never- released independent film, or that he once bought a 16-track recorder directly from Brian Wilson. And for Mass Suicide Occult Figurines, Vanderslice's first release since MK Ultra's demise in mid-1999, he manufactured a pretty little hoax about being sued by Microsoft for copyright infringement stemming from the song ""Bill Gates Must Die."" So why do I find the above lyrics so oddly intriguing? At first glance, it appears as if Vanderslice is taunting us playfully, self-deprecatingly; he won't tell us who he really is because his personal life isn't all that interesting anyway. This initially makes sense, since this is a guy who's written songs about bombing the post office, joining the Red Cross, reminiscing about life during wartime, and stalking the president, among other things. It seems relatively clear that it's not really John himself talking here. But if he was inventing characters and stories in all those instances, how do we know he's not doing that here as well? Could this apparently straightforward, honest declaration be just another invention? Or have I simply spent way too much time listening to Mass Suicide Occult Figurines and am reading too much into it? Obviously, the answer is yes, but my point is this: Vanderslice is not only developing into a brilliant pop-song craftsman, but he's an adept storyteller as well, blurring the boundaries between truth and fiction so thoroughly that, in the end, the difference doesn't even matter. After all, a good song is still a good song, whether or not it actually tells a true story. A background check on Mass Suicide Occult Figurines shows the album to be a patched-together affair, incorporating songs culled from the final days of MK Ultra and Vanderslice's solo studio work. And while it's pretty clear which songs fall into which category-- the MK Ultra songs sound more like a live band, and the solo stuff is more lush, a bit moodier, and more intricately arranged-- the track ordering is such that the different songs work to complement each other nicely, resulting in a surprisingly well-paced, varied-sounding (yet still cohesive) album. There's no overarching theme to Mass Suicide Occult Figurines as there has been on past MK Ultra releases, but it does contain some of Vanderslice's finest work to date. ""Confusion Boats"" smoothly switches gears between ominous murkiness and a gently swaying verse melody; ""Josie Anderson"" is a swell-and- recede ballad-about-a-girl with a curious naval-warfare motif (""You are steamboat hips/ Gunpowder lips/ Blue bonfires on the shore""). For some, the fabulously titled ""Bill Gates Must Die"" would be the centerpiece of this album, but I cast my vote for ""Speed Lab"" as one of the finest pop songs of the year; it's certainly the catchiest song ever written about illegal drug manufacturing. The terse, jagged riffing is enough to cement it into your brain for weeks, but Vanderslice outdoes himself with the lyrics, spinning an evocative tale of Denis Johnson-style California noir in less than 150 words. While the snarling guitars of ""Bill Gates"" musical equally those of ""Speed Lab,"" the lyrics seem vague where those of ""Speed Lab"" are sharply imagined; allusions to paranoia about Internet security loopholes and federal eavesdropping don't quite coalesce into the damning, righteous indictment of Microsoft that the title would suggest. For this particular computer geek, it's a bit of a letdown. Clocking in at under 35 minutes (and that includes five minutes of not-unwelcome filler), Mass Suicide Occult Figurines is maddeningly short, but it's also in no danger of wearing out its welcome. It's just long enough to not feel lightweight, and short enough to leave you craving more as the ""Slow Nerve Action""-esque ""Foothills of my Mind"" dissolves into an extended coda of processed orchestral swells. And with this album being the first Vanderslice-penned record to receive decent national distribution and promotion, he could be well on his way to becoming the Next Big Indie Thing.","""Everybody's got screwed up stories/ Everybody's got gruesome details,"" sings John Vanderslice.

Will You Find Me,Ida,by: Matt LeMay,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c1a2abf31b7dc7156662/1:1/w_160/926c57c1.gif,2000-07-11 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4051-will-you-find-me/,Tiger StyleTiger Style,"50% of the songs on Ida's new record contain the words ""sleep,"" ""bed,"" ""weariness,"" ""night,"" ""slow,"" ""crawl,"" or ""late."" 35% of the songs on the record contain the word ""love."" So, if you're expecting Will You Find Me to be a collection of tired love songs, you're correct on many levels. Not only does the record act as a powerful sedative, it also stands as a perfect example of how conscious attempts to construct a specific type of album can suffocate a band. Ida try to be pretty like the Dwarves try to be badass, replacing power chords and the word ""fuck"" with male-female harmonies and lyrics about butterflies. ""Down on Your Back,"" one of the Will You Find Me's many appropriately titled songs, is a perfect thesis statement for Ida's bland audio tranquilizer. High-pitched female and falsetto male vocals sing over delicately plucked guitars as if to clarify that the music is, in fact, very, very pretty. But even those delicate harmonies can't save a lyric like ""all your secrets collide"" from its Bonnie Tyler overtones. Ida is a model case for style over substance. Throughout this record, their goal is solely to be pretty. They attempt to achieve this through singing in major 3rds, 4ths, and 5ths, a techinique which could have had decent results if they'd varied their chord progressions. This gets especially tiring during a 6+ minute-long epic like ""Maybelle,"" when the overwhelming prettiness fades into a completely innocuous, unaffecting backdrop. The majority of Will You Find Me does nothing to break this mold. A slow-to-mid tempo is maintained for the album's entire hour-long duration, with flourishes of guitar, piano, and occasional keyboards piping up once in a while. Sadly, these temporary brushes with interest are minuscule, and fail to rouse the listener from their comatose slumber. At times, the album does grab your attention, but never for the right reasons. The album's indisputable low point comes with ""Past the Past,"" a song whose title could have been penned by the Promise Ring or Bright Eyes. It's an appropriate comparison, too, as the track suffers from sometimes-singer Daniel Littleton's excessively emotional vocals. I use the term ""emotional"" loosely, though. Will You Find Me could have been a record brimming with genuine emotion-- an album made by four people truly interested in getting their feelings down on tape. But I'm inherently suspicious of a record which tries so hard to be this sensitive. From the soft-focus pictures of shy-looking band members on the cover art, to songs with titles like ""Don't Be Sad,"" Ida never miss an opportunity to remind you that they are, as All Music Guide puts it, ""the best band in the country at writing those pretty songs that make you want to get cozy with your sweetie."" To make matters worse, occasionally passionate lyrics are met with the same bland musical treatment as those that actually fit Ida's sonic Demerol. ""We were like kids with a shotgun/ Blowing up words till there were none,"" is given the same musical treatment as, ""I could watch you sleep for hours/ Without noticing that it's getting really late."" But despite the fact that the band seems to have set out to create a mature, affecting record this time around, the painfully self-aware nature of their endeavor has rendered any stirring impact the album might have harbored dead on arrival.","50% of the songs on Ida's new record contain the words ""sleep,"" ""bed,"" ""weariness,"" ""night,"" ""slow,"" ""crawl,"" or ""late ...

Trainer,Plaid,by: Paul Cooper,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a0995e6ef9596931ffbc/1:1/w_160/366c60ad.jpg,2000-07-10 06:01:40,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6331-trainer/,Warp,"Since its inception, UK techno has been determined to out-Detroit Detroit. From the implant fantasies of B12's Electro-soma and Insync vs. Mysteron's Android Architect, to the cyber sheen of Justice's jungle (always more Detroit than Denmark Hill), British techno exponents, when not attempting to surpass the original sound, have always been conscious to pay homage to it. This is ironic, since the Motor City founders of the genre were actualizing their respect not only for Kraftwerk, but also for Sheffield-based industrial/synth-pop acts such as the Human League, Heaven 17, and the colossal Cabaret Voltaire. The two members of Plaid, Ed Handley and Andy Turner, rode in on Warp's groundbreaking Artificial Intelligence compilation as members of Black Dog Productions. Many of the acts compiled on sampler have gone on to achieve greatness (Autechre's demo song was on the disc, as was-- in various disguises-- material by Richard D. James, Richie Hawtin, and the Orb). It's true that Black Dog Productions haven't survived to the present day, but this demise was not due to unoriginality or record company mergers: the third member of Black Dog, Ken Downie, pushed his obscure hip-hop/techno fusion too vigorously for Handley and Turner's tastes, and the personality clash caused Ed and Andy to break away and record on their own. However, the duo didn't totally discard b-boy-isms and throw-down attitude in their matchless version of techno. Trainer is a two-disc archive of Plaid's deft manipulations of the techno blueprint, beginning with the Second Summer of Love (1989) and ending with the solidification of the IDM sound in 1995. Whether released under their Plaid, Balil, Atypic, or Turic monikers, let there be no doubt, Handley and Turner's achievements during these years are, to this day, astonishing. In fact, their albums subsequent to this period (1997's Not for Threes and 1999's Rest Proof Clockwork) sound slack by comparison. The immediate benefit of Trainer is that it contains the long lost Mbuki Mvuki album. Originally released in 1991, the record's seven tracks broadly sketch the Plaid sound-- ambitronically modified, near-Latin rhythms are tightly locked by rock-steady hip-hop nous and a visionary Third Wave attitude. On that vida tecnologica vibe, ""Scoobs in Colombia"" wiggles its linen-panted Fania All-Star arse with such giddy joy that it stomps upon the po'-faced, furrowed-brow stereotype that's restricted so many techno artists' social lives. ""Bouncing Checks"" revels in a beatbox meltdown and a synth string stampede. Each maddeningly unquantized element totters on the brink of collapsing into a synthetic stammer. 1989's ""Uneasy Listening"" is pre-Chemical Brothers big-beat redrawn for a less flatulent, more cultivated audience. 1991's ""Chirpy"" is an edgy first draft for what would eventually become trip-hop. The classically Detroit ""Prig"" follows, juxtaposing Eno-esque ambient washes with piercing industrial stabs. You can imagine Derrick May grinding his teeth in annoyance at just how perfectly the two contrasting elements are blended. And just to confound Dr Alex Paterson, ""Eshish"" out-Orbs the Orb during its blissful, floating, far-too-brief four-minute run. Trainer's second disc covers tracks recorded between 1992 and 1995, and one can clearly perceive the influence of electro and, significantly, jungle. Some chroniclers of techno have traced jungle's genesis to the Mbuki Mvuki album. And while I can't endorse that notion entirely, it's not without some appeal. Still, fanciful genealogical excursions take us away from the confident poise and-- I have to say it-- perfection of Plaid's work during these years. As one skims Trainer's tracklist, two things are missing. One is a minor omission-- namely ""Parasight,"" recorded for a Balil EP on Rising High Records, which remains one of the most emotional and compelling voyages of the Roland TB-303 to this day. But the other absence is far more significant: nowhere will you read the word ""remix."" The tracks here need no adjusting; they're as complete as one can imagine they could ever be. Whether recording as Plaid or as Balil, Atypic or Turic, Handley and Turner effortlessly welded the unpredictable to the accustomed. As the bathetically titled Trainer bountifully demonstrates, Handley and Turner never succumbed to the pull of their influences throughout this rich period. And in so doing, they became one of the most influential bands of their genre.","Since its inception, UK techno has been determined to out-Detroit Detroit.

El Baile Aleman,Señor Coconut Y Su Conjunto,by: Mark Richardson,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a3a4ea9e61561daa4d1c/1:1/w_160/35f03be9.gif,2000-07-04 05:00:01,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7070-el-baile-aleman/,Emperor NortonEmperor Norton,"The first thing I thought of when I heard this album of Latin-style Kraftwerk covers was the forgotten novelty band Dread Zeppelin. Fronted by the profoundly obese Tortelvis, Dread Zeppelin had all the moronic college kids laughing along to their reggaeized Zeppelin-meets-Elvis shtick way back in 1990. (I can't front: I was one of them.) The formula for both Señor Coconut and Dread Zeppelin is simple: just take an overexposed batch of songs and graft them onto an exotic and seemingly incompatible genre. Instant novelty item. And like the Fart-in-a-Can, the ""Damn Pigeons"" fake shit-encrusted baseball hat, and Grandma's First Dildo, this sort of Emperor Norton kitsch would, if there were any justice, be sold at Spencer Gifts. It's utterly disposable trash without a shred of artistic merit, an album that winks cheekily while nudging ribs, dying to impress with its cleverness. For me to encourage the purchase of El Baile Aleman when there's so much great music that will never be heard is downright irresponsible. A crime, even. But that's exactly what I'm going to do. Because, goddammit, this album is entertaining. Señor Coconut is actually German electronic music prankster Uwe Schmidt, better known as Atom Heart. Schmidt is reportedly hiding from the fascist German music underground in sunny South America (Santiago, Chile to be exact), much as his fellow countryman Adolph Eichmann once hid from the Nuremberg prosecutors. While taking in the local culture, Schmidt was struck with a vision: why not take the songs of Florian Schneider and Ralf Hütter and jazz them up to sound like they were performed by Ricky Ricardo's orchestra? It's not hard to come up with some arguments against the idea, but fortunately, Schmidt made some good decisions along the way. The first was choosing to pay homage to Kraftwerk. Their pioneering use of synthesizers, and their role in helping to define machine music is undebatable-- they were great songwriters who created some fantastically catchy melodies. And their stated affection for the Beach Boys really shows when you strip songs like ""Autobahn"" and ""The Robots"" from their vocoder'd voicings; hearing these songs on El Baile Aleman as sung by Argenis Brito and Jorge Gonzalez reveals just how strong the kraft of the music really was. Even without the cheese. Schmidt's second masterstroke was in selecting the record's instrumentation. The bulk of the musical background is clattering, danceable Latin percussion, a production decision that translates the original synthesizer arrangements perfectly. The instrumental melodies are primarily handled by vibraphone, and the sound is fleshed out with cowbells, fish, bongos, congas, and the occasional horn or accordion accent. It's a tasty rhythmic stew that plays up the groove and keeps the party moving, a must for any novelty record. Then there's the fine song selection. Schmidt wisely favors the bigger hits with the most distinctive melodies: ""Showroom Dummies,"" ""Trans-Europe Express,"" ""Neon Lights,"" and ""Tour de France"" are all highlights. The puzzling exclusion of ""The Model"" is a bit of a bummer, partly because it's so catchy and would fit in well, but mostly because it would have been the fifth version of the song I own (in addition to Kraftwerk's original, there's the punishing take by Big Black, one by oddball Resident Snakefinger, and a gorgeous chamber translation by the Balanescu Quartet). But still, despite the absence of ""The Model"" and the base nature of this project, I have to doff my sombrero to Señor Coconut for creating such a fun little diversion: Felicitaciones, Señor Coconut, para un trabajo hecho bien.","The first thing I thought of when I heard this album of Latin-style Kraftwerk\n\ covers was the forgotten novelty ...

Beat first released a limited- edition run of this album, shortly before the UK release of Elephant Shoe in 1999. Back in the day, this record would have cost $25. I suppose the powers-that-be decided the quality of this document was valuable enough to be released stateside for a cheaper price. A wise decision, given the momentum lost in the year it took for Elephant Shoe to hit American shores. Perhaps best known for Aidan Moffat's gloomy, debauched tales of booze and bad sex, the real meat-and-potatoes of Arab Strap has always been the tension between his spoken/sung narratives and Malcolm Middleton's intricate musical backdrop. For all the attention lavished upon Moffat's references to cocks and cunts, some have maintained that any of the band's albums could also serve as an instrumental work in the spirit of most Scottish post-rock. This 1998 set, recorded in its entirety with minimal interaction with the audience, melds the finer points of their best work into a potent display. Things kick off quietly enough with a chiming rendition of ""My Favourite Muse,"" but by ""New Birds,"" the strength of this release is evident: the rhythm section asserts itself more boldly than on any of the band's studio efforts, and Middleton's weaving guitar rocks harder and more skillfully than ever before. Every time he hits the distortion pedal, the speakers become enveloped in a dense instrumental swell-- you wouldn't expect the group's loud/soft dynamics to sound this organically vital live. What's more, the instrumental virtues that shine in this live setting serve to heighten the dramatic tone of the vocal. Aidan Moffat doesn't content himself with simply rehashing his by now well rehearsed confessionals without spirit-- on the contrary, an added gloss of pathos accentuates the performance. With virtually no onstage dialogue to dilute the atmosphere, an extra note of loss and emptiness resounds at each song's end, Moffat's accent-drenched brooding demanding sympathy. Standouts here include the Adele Bethel's guest vocals on ""Afterwards"" and worthy b-side, ""Toy Fights,"" and a blood-curdling rendition of ""Girls of Summer"" that manages to inject a dance rhythm into its rollicking finale. Arab Strap's output is impressive enough, but this succinct live recording stands as their most direct and effective release to date.","Given the hit-and-miss ratio of their gigs, the world hadn't exactly been\n\ clamoring for a live Arab Strap ...

Ok Go have been masterfully collecting hype by plastering their flashy posters on Exito! newspaper dispensers and opening for every single band in Chicago over the last year, including Don Caballero, The Promise Ring, Elliott Smith, and OMD. (Yes, Orchestral Maneuvers in the Dark.) It's actually been fascinating to watch their inevitable rise. Local press now invariably strokes the band's egos; in a city still sadly yearning for their next ""Pumpkins,"" these guys seem to have become the prime candidates. Image counts, kids, and a flashy www.okgo.net website with press photos was born even before these guys had-- oh, right!-- a record. But now that their meticulous, year-long recording sessions can finally be heard, however briefly, the band can get on with gathering devoted fans and lukewarm reviews. This sub-10-minute EP was crafted in five studios, including the spiffy workplaces of Dave Trumfio, Steve Albini, and Butch Vig. (At this point, it should be noted that Ok Go have trust funds.) And despite minor songwriting triumphs, it can be difficult to wrap your head around the fact that five studios, two producers, and five assistants worked to create a Weezer knock-off called ""Bye Bye Baby"". On stage, Ok Go play the shiniest gear, filtered through electronics and a laptop. The silicon sound offers pinches-- tiny pinches-- of Brainiac moments, most notably on their tune, ""This Is Not the Sound of a Train"". Sadly, that's not included here. Instead, we get the lithe acoustic throwaway ""It's Tough to Have a Crush When the Boy Doesn't Feel the Same Way You Do"". Jeremy Jacobsen of Five Style and The Lonesome Organist, and The Coctails' Mark Greenberg supply some nifty vaudevillian twinkling underneath, but it fails to detract from the fact that everything the song has to offer is handed over in the title alone. Quick, guess the chorus! Reading the sleeve can be just as melodic, and at least saves you from the line, ""Who ever knew such hullabaloo?"" ""We Dug a Hole"" opens with ""Strawberry Fields"" organ and hides pleasant choruses. However, the verses serve up layers of ""loops"" and ""rapping"" that could only make Amy Heckerling wet, and their anal studio attention dominates every guitar chug and vocal harmony. Of course, considering the competition, Ok Go have a brilliant future. Even this beats the living lisp out of The Promise Ring. (Oddly, Jade Tree turned Ok Go down-- this could have been their retirement fund.) Still, the band fully embraces the cheddar pleasures of major label pop, and for every crispy curveball thrown, there's a lyric like, ""C-C-C-Cinnamon lips and candy kisses on my tongue."" And if these sound like bitter, grizzled complaints, it's only because I'm trying to brace you for the moment they ditch self-released CDs and come to your town with Fruit-by-the-Foot's Generation Flav'R Fest.","Reverse the pronunciation guide for ""INXS.""

Installation Sonore,Rinocerose,by: Matt LeMay,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a27bc0084474cd0c005a/1:1/w_160/b31767b3.gif,2000-06-30 05:00:08,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6791-installation-sonore/,V2,"Once upon a time, in the magical kingdom of music, there lived two young friends, Guitar and Synthesizer. Guitar and Synthesizer loved to play together. They went to the park, ate ice cream, and made lots of music together. They were the best of friends. But as they got older, Guitar and Synthesizer began to drift apart. Synthesizer had stopped playing with Guitar, and began hanging out with a lot of Germans in black turtlenecks, going to art galleries and upscale dance clubs. Guitar fell in with a seedier crowd, and though he did his best to maintain the friendship, Synthesizer wanted little to do with Guitar's wicked ways. Guitar was sad. While Synthesizer was hanging out with a bunch of cool, avant-garde Europeans, Guitar wasn't getting nearly the acclaim he felt he deserved. Pretentious music critics were declaring Guitar's music ""dead,"" no matter how hard he tried. But one day, Guitar got an idea. He would get two of his indie rocking friends, Jean Phillippe Freu and Patrice Carrie, to beat Synthesizer at his own game-- they would make house music using only the sounds of Guitar! At first, Jean Phillippe, Patrice, and Guitar had a lot of fun with their musical experiment. But as they continued working, they realized that something was wrong. By its very definition, house music cannot be made with only Guitar's sounds. Guitar knew what he had to do. He called his old friend Synthesizer, and convinced him and his friend, Johnny Palumbo, to help him and his friends with their house music. At last, Guitar and Synthesizer had found a project they could work on together. But before long, tensions between Guitar and Synthesizer began to surface. Synthesizer became resentful of the repetitive, sonically uninteresting parts Guitar was playing. Synthesizer would burst in on Guitar while he was recording and yell, ""I could do that!"" Guitar was mad at Synthesizer, as well. Guitar, used to working with real drummers, was angry at Synthesizer for spitting out trite drum machine beats. Synthesizer responded by telling Guitar he was just a gimmick, designed to lure unsuspecting hipper-than-thou indie kids into buying a mediocre house record. Guitar, Synthesizer, and their three French friends finished their record, and titled it Installation Sonore, French for ""gimmicky shit."" But things were never the same between them. Synthesizer moved to Germany and was kidnapped by an avant-garde artist, who poured sulfuric acid and pig shit on him, turning him into a ""sculpture."" Guitar moved to New York City's East Village, hit the bottle pretty hard, and whored himself to pay for his heroin addiction. He's since recovered, and is taking it one day at a time... As for Phillippe, Patrice, and Johnny, they continued to make ""conceptual"" house music under their << RixF4çérôse >> moniker. Installation Sonore found an adoring audience among insecure music fans who assumed that any band with that many accents in their name must be brilliant. They're currently planning another record of house music made entirely with baroque instruments.","Once upon a time, in the magical kingdom of music, there lived two young friends,\n\ Guitar and Synthesizer.

"...Is Dead, Long Live...",Camper Van Beethoven,by: Zach Hooker,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a4f613d1975652138e31/1:1/w_160/95e54e08.gif,2000-06-30 05:00:07,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1264-is-dead-long-live/,Pitch-a-Tent,"David Lowery has always been his own worst enemy. He's built a career on making people guess whether or not he's joking, and even his most vocal supporters hold differing opinions on the subject from song to song. For twenty years and at least three bands, the man has been playing the Shell Game with his tongue and cheeks, like this: David Lowery: ""Now, thadies and jdendlemen, waj clodely and keep your eye on da thung, but ruhmember, da thung is fadser dan de eye! Now, thadies and jdendlemen, where joo you thuppothe the dung is now?"" Listening Public: ""It's right there, David, in your left cheek."" David Lowery: ""Ah! Wrong! It is, in fact, on the bookcase to your left, hidden behind that dusty bottle of Unicum, the national liqueur of Hungary!"" Listening Public: ""Sure, David. Sure."" Camper Van Beethoven-- criminally underrated during their existence and disingenuously lauded after having disbanded-- just couldn't shake the perception that they were somehow a novelty act, because nobody was able to determine when they were actually being serious. So Lowery went and formed Cracker, a band that can't shake the perception that they're really Blues Traveler, because now nobody can tell when they're not being serious. David Lowery is the David Eggers of rock-- critics and listeners generally admit there's something to his work but keep their distance nonetheless, afraid of being lured into some mean-spirited trick. That whole noncommittal thing was Lowery's long before anybody else tried it, though, and to many of us, it's clear that his past is peppered with heartbreaking works of staggering... well, something. Now, more than ten years after Camper Van Beethoven's demise, Lowery and cohorts Victor Krummenacher and Jonathan Segel have decided to release, through Lowery's own Pitch-a-Tent Records, an album of outtakes, live performances, demos and rarities. Sounds like a bad idea to you? It probably was. But some of us really miss Camper Van Beethoven. And to those of us who've found ourselves, despite our best efforts, thinking that maybe Cracker's chicken-fried shtick has passed over the better bits of Camper's sensibility, it's a bad idea whose time has come. Somehow, the boys make it sound alright. Camper Van Beethoven Is Dead, Long Live Camper Van Beethoven is shrouded in the usual Camperian mystery. The idea, evidently, was to release an album of ""leftovers"" that didn't sound like one. To this end, the various live bits, partially completed songs and demos have been cut-and-pasted together, smeared with an obfuscating layer of samples and sound effects, and had their origins generally obliterated. The whole thing bleeds together, with unfamiliar bits starting out blurry, coming into focus, and then resolving into more familiar melodies before suddenly disappearing. It's an interesting approach, and it helps smooth over the cracks in what is, by its very nature, some uneven material. None of this stuff is revelatory, of course, but a lot of it's better than it really has any right to be. The live material includes an excellent cover of Zappa's ""Who are the Brain Police?""-- which sounds more like it's being performed by the Soft Boys than by these guys-- and ""S.P. 37957"", a medley which exemplifies the sort of Camper Van strangeness that so bewildered people in the 80s: the track careers wildly from an original Eastern European-tinged instrumental to a spot-on recreation of Zeppelin's ""Dazed and Confused"". Other highlights are the possibly partly maybe new ""Klondike"", which features a sample of the violin melody from Camper's own ""The Fool"" and an orchestral version of what is, quite simply, one of the finest songs ever put to record, ""All Her Favorite Fruit"" from 1989's Key Lime Pie. Sure, this is pretty much a cult-fodder release, and it's naturally much thinner than the band's proper albums-- especially their last two. Still, it hangs together remarkably well. The album's real value, of course, is that it hints that Lowery, Krummenacher and Segel are still in touch with their snotty, inscrutable weird sides-- and with each other's snotty, inscrutable weird sides, too. And in that there is hope for the future.","David Lowery has always been his own worst enemy. He's built a career on making people guess whether or ...

"Mermaid Avenue, Vol. II",Billy BraggWilco,by: Ryan Kearney,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a375c0084474cd0c0294/1:1/w_160/e882d2b6.gif,2000-06-30 05:00:06,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/902-mermaid-avenue-vol-ii/,Elektra,"Everybody stand up. Come on, all of you. Don't worry, I'm not going to make you hold your hat to your heart and sing our national anthem. You're standing-- okay, probably not-- to salute an American folk hero: Woody Guthrie. Indisputably one of our best singer/songwriters ever, Guthrie was the voice for those who didn't have one: the abandoned poor and the hard-working middle class, the despondent and the dreamers. In fact, Woody Guthrie is so historically important that the Smithsonian currently has an exhibit about him, named after his most famous song, the anti-""God Bless America"" number, ""This Land Is Your Land"". But as the existence of such an exhibit would suggest, Guthrie is a cultural icon only to older generations or the well-informed. The exhibit's video presentation shows how desperately the curators are trying to expose a new generation to his work. The video opens with Billy Bragg praising Guthrie as a ""lyrical poet"" who brought a personal edge to his socio-political songs. Then comes Billy Bragg & Wilco's version of ""California Stars"", culled from the first Mermaid Avenue album. Throughout the video, we also hear from Bono, Ani DiFranco, Corey Harris, Bob Dylan, and The Bruce (as in Springsteen). Of the twelve songs on the video soundtrack, only four are actually performed by Guthrie, including a repeat of ""This Land Is Your Land"". This attempt to contemporize Woody Guthrie began in the spring of 1995 when his daughter, Nora, approached British singer/songwriter Billy Bragg with over 2,000 sets of lyrics her father never put to music before dying of Huntington's Disease in 1967. She asked Bragg, a politically charged musician himself, if he would like to choose a handful of songs and put them to music. Naturally, Bragg accepted the honor, asking Wilco's Jeff Tweedy to collaborate with him (Tweedy's background in the alt-folk/country/rock group Uncle Tupelo made him a perfect candidate). The result was 1998's rightfully critically acclaimed Mermaid Avenue, named after Guthrie's street on Coney Island. Between the two of them, Billy Bragg and Wilco had twelve songs left over from the Mermaid Avenue sessions. So now, in 2000, they've decided to issue a second volume, only three songs of which were recorded since the original sessions. Perhaps this explains why the sound isn't much different this time around, and why the songs aren't on par with the previous album. Volume II is like an unnecessary b-sides compilation, and for the most part, there's a reason why these songs didn't make the cut the first time around. Since Guthrie's lyrics are just as exceptional on this album, ranging from the romantic to the playful to the political, one must look solely at the music for comparison. Unfortunately, nothing on this album is as beautiful as ""California Stars"", as saddening as ""At My Window Sad and Lonely"", or as touching as ""Another Man's Done Gone."" In some cases, the songs on Volume II are the embarrassing cousins of songs from the first album. As an album opener, ""Airline to Heaven"" gets the foot stomping just as well as ""Walt Whitman's Niece"", but you can't sing along to it. And in the battle of songs about cultural icons, the plodding ""Joe DiMaggio Done It Again"" makes ""Ingrid Bergman"" seem much more pleasant than it really is. What's more, the weak moments here are even less passable than they were on volume one. Nonetheless, the album does have its high points. Driven by an unvaried, chantey organ straight off Dylan's Time Out of Mind, ""Hot Rod Hotel"" is a haunting auto-biographical song about Guthrie's dreary jobs as a youth. On ""My Flying Saucer"" and ""Secret of the Sea"", Bragg and Wilco use lofty, wandering guitar notes to capture the fantasy in Guthrie's lyrics. On ""All You Fascists"", Bragg is accompanied by a driving guitar and raucous harmonica. When he belts out, ""I'm gonna tell all you fascists you may be surprised/ The people in this world are getting organized/ You're bound to lose,"" he does so with an intensity that befits the lyrics. And on the final track, ""Someday Some Morning Sometime"", Tweedy's vocals are perfectly paced with Guthrie's lyricism. If it weren't for the first album, I might really enjoy Volume II, but as it is, I'm corrupted by the greater artistic success of its predecessor.","Everybody stand up. Come on, all of you. Don't worry, I'm not going to make you hold your ...

Seconds Before the Accident,Archers of Loaf,by: Pete Nicholson,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a0f5c0084474cd0bfccc/1:1/w_160/c3f094e1.gif,2000-06-30 05:00:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/278-seconds-before-the-accident/,Alias,"I can recall only one concert that ever converted an entire roomful of disbelievers to indie missionaries. It was 1996, in a small Australian town. Roughly 100 Slayer and Metallica fans had gathered, mostly against their will, to see the Archers of Loaf. The longhairs initially responded to the set with deformed sneers and abuse, yet the gig ended amidst tears of revelation and recognition. Such was the power of the Loaf. That year, the Archers released Vitus Tinnitus, an EP that adequately captured the coarse might of their live shows. Their recorded output had always threatened to bring them wider exposure, but after the release of their fourth LP, White Trash Heroes, lead guitarist Eric Johnson departed, and by the start of the new millennium, the Archers had disbanded, leaving only Eric Bachmann's Crooked Fingers to carry on the legacy. Seconds Before the Accident records one of the Archers' final shows in their hometown of Chapel Hill, North Carolina, and the vocal crowd reflects the affection with which their fans regarded them. The liner notes explain that the songs were chosen ""based on listenability,"" and indeed, the tracks function to highlight the brighter points of the band's career. ""Dead Red Eyes"" opens the record, setting Eric Bachmann's dry, melodic vocal line over sedated keyboards and a punchy, distorted bass. The track segues nicely into Vee Vee's ""Fabricoh"", one of the band's many signature skewed, dirty rock songs. The pop classic ""Web in Front"" is followed by Bachmann's heartfelt warning to his crowd: ""If I have an aneurysm tonight, it's out of gratitude."" ""Fashion Bleeds"" showcases the confident interplay between Bachmann's driving rhythm and Johnson's unique atonal lead. Their energetic, distorted drone is focused throughout by Bachmann's intelligent if somewhat angry lyrical reaction to consumer society. His drawl on Icky Mettle's ""You and Me"" is welcomed by a cacophony of drunken voices shouting along with the first verse. At the close of the set, Bachmann returns to the stage unaccompanied to bid farewell with the beautiful piano ballad, ""Chumming the Oceans"". Even through the sterile bits of digital technology, there's an undeniable sense of sadness emanating from the crowd as one of the great Chapel Hill bands of the 90s departs for possibly the last time. The collection of moments that comprise Seconds Before the Accident, and the live spectacle itself, will elicit the same reaction from anyone familiar with the Archers' eight-year commitment to incredible rock music. Perhaps the roughness of the live sound would rule this album out as a proper introduction to the band's work-- especially with their monumental 1993 debut, Icky Mettle, filling that niche appropriately. But to fans, this will prove a fitting swansong, and excellent documentation for an experience lost to another time.","I can recall only one concert that ever converted an entire roomful of disbelievers to indie missionaries.

Separation Anxieties,12 Rods,by: Matt LeMay,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a83dc0084474cd0c0daa/1:1/w_160/70ad2d4e.gif,2000-06-30 05:00:04,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8201-separation-anxieties/,V2,"It's a rare occurrence indeed that listening to a record actually causes me physical pain. I'm capable of putting on a stoic smile when confronted with friends' Dave Matthews records. Korn and Limp Bizkit can induce a twinge, nothing more. But listening to 12 Rods' newest release makes me hurt. Bad. Separation Anxieties is the ear infection that antibiotics can't cure fast enough. It's the headache that half a bottle of aspirin just won't alleviate. It's the splinter you can't pull out of your foot without the assistance of heavy-gauge needles or sufficiently pointy tweezers. This record is acid reflux, gastroenteritis, and dysentery all rolled into one. But the stomach-turning pain this record causes me doesn't stem from any particularly grating noise or gut-wrenchingly awful sonic mishap to be found on the record. Rather, it comes from the knowledge that a band I once considered to be one of the absolute greatest bands in modern music could produce a record that sounds so bad. What's even more perplexing is that the same band could call such an obviously terrible-sounding record ""the record we wanted to make and that sounds like us."" 12 Rods' 1998 debut LP, Split Personalities, rocked ass from here to Bangladesh by showcasing a band in peak form. With Ryan Olcott's robotic whine, Christopher McGuire's maniacally inventive drumming, and Olcott brother Ev's keyboard talents and studio noodling, this band had finally figured out how to translate its unique elements into a well-oiled machine. The record sounded nothing short of perfect. Every chord, every melody, every synthetic bleep, every pathetically self-deprecating word Olcott spat out-- it all fit together so perfectly. 12 Rods were a band who not only played great songs, but knew how to listen to their own sound and refine it to the point of absolute perfection. Which is all why this record comes as such a shock. Separation Anxieties' opening track, ""Kaboom"", begins with a stupid, but not overly offensive barrage of gratuitously poppy guitars, drums, and synth bursts. But any hopes for a salvageable song are instantly shattered when the sound dies down and Ryan Olcott shouts ""Sex!/ It's a regular practice,"" just in time for a hokey and completely displaced power-chord progression that simply sounds wrong. This is followed by ""What Has Happened"", which may very well be the album's worst. Over yet another generic power-chord progression, Olcott whines: ""My ex thinks she's so tough/ She flicks her cigarettes before she puffs/ I think she's a man when she wears Adidas/ She lost her libido then dumped me for a punk/ Who's in a band, sounds like Korn/ But pretentiously aggressive/ Not too impressive."" Yow. As the song segues into the marginally less offensive chorus of ""What has happened?/ What has happened to the one that I love,"" the listener's sentiment mirrors Olcott's verbatim. After only the second song, almost all hope is lost, replaced only by a sickening sense of disappointment and bewilderment. Perhaps the most frustrating aspect of Separation Anxieties is the fact that every time it seems like the guys might stumble upon a patch of decency, it all goes awry. ""Astrogimp"" is musically incredible, but the worst lyrics you may ever be exposed to taint the song's relative virtue (the title is all the proof you need). Two less offensive tracks, ""I Think I'm Flying"" and ""Your Secret's Safe With Me"", are followed by the album's single most intolerable moment, the distressingly horrid jack-in-the-box and quivering falsetto introduction to ""Marionette"", a song with a chorus consisting of yet another overused, run-of-the-mill chord progression-- and what the fuck are these lyrics?! Augh!!!! Since I bought Separation Anxieties over a week ago, I've been attempting to convince myself that the alarming decline in quality from the last record is not the fault of 12 Rods themselves-- or rather Ev and Ryan, the only two remaining members of the ""new"" incarnation of 12 Rods. It's easy to blame producer Todd Rundgren, whose production work with Hall & Oates is eclipsed only by his vocal arrangements for Celine Dion. Certainly, the man had his day in 1987 with XTC's Skylarking, but his insipid overproduction on this album is far more typical of his recent efforts. Another easy way out is to blame the record company. Some of the material on Gay? and Split Personalities had been around for a while-0 maybe V2 forced the band into releasing a record full of material the band wasn't comfortable with. They did title the last song on their own record ""Glad That It's Over""... But no matter whose fault it is, nothing changes that Separation Anxieties is a huge letdown-- especially considering the fact that I've patiently waited for its release for the better part of a year. I marked its release date on my calendar. I bought it the day it came out. I was expecting an album in the spirit of Gay? and Split Personalities-- a record that would instantly cement a place among my favorites. Obviously, it didn't happen like that. It saddens me that this record barely warrants a 2.0. Nothing would have made me happier than to issue my first rating above a 9.5 to one of my absolute favorite bands. But on the plus side, I can now throw Separation Anxieties on the fire and spend the next couple of months convincing myself that it was all a bad dream, and that 12 Rods are still one of the greatest bands in the world.","It's a rare occurrence indeed that listening to a record actually causes me physical pain.

The Powerpuff Girls: Heroes & Villains,Various Artists,by: Ryan Schreiber,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Founder</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a7cdea9e61561daa5687/1:1/w_160/d455c0cd.gif,2000-06-30 05:00:03,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1964-the-powerpuff-girls-heroes-villains/,Rhino,"The album cover says, ""Music inspired by The Powerpuff Girls."" This is a lie. The Powerpuff Girls inspire 30 minutes of glued-to-the-set, TV-watching action for nine-year-olds. Nothing more. Why do marketing execs stretch truths like this? My personal favorite example of this kind of blatant dishonesty came with Atlantic Records' release of Music from and Inspired by Jesus. Jesus, if you'll recall, served as last year's annual biblical mini-series extravaganza. The music on the soundtrack was not ""from"" Jesus, himself, as the title implied, but rather, from LeAnn Rimes and DC Talk. How disappointed Jesus' fans must have been when they discovered he didn't perform his legendary vaudevillian opus, ""Just a Closer Walk with Me."" The packaging of Heroes and Villains contains a similar mistruth: these songs were not inspired by The Powerpuff Girls; they were commissioned by the Cartoon Network. I find it difficult to believe that Frank Black and Cornelius were viewing, say, the ""Monkey See, Doggie Do"" episode of this lovable children's show, and became so moved by the eloquent metaphors and primary colors that they simply could not resist the urge to write. That said, this companion piece to the animated series is highly indie-friendly, as series creator Craig McCracken is obviously a counter-culture pop fan. The title, Heroes and Villains, was inspired by The Beach Boys hit of the same name. The record also features songs by The Apples in Stereo, Shonen Knife, Cornelius, Olivia Tremor Control's Bill Doss (performing here under the guise of The Bill Doss), and appropriately, Kindercore recording artists Dressy Bessy. The disc opens with ""The Powerpuff Girls (Main Theme)"" (just in case you absolutely had to have it on CD), before launching into Devo's hyperactive ""Go Monkey Go"", written in honor of the simian Mojo Jojo, the Powerpuffs' central nemesis. It makes sense that Devo would appear on this album, as frontman Mark Mothersbaugh has been penning cartoon music for Rugrats and other series since the mid-1990s. Of course, Devo are laughably past their prime, and this track is just another nail in the coffin. Yes, it's time to disband. Again. Frank Black's ""Pray for the Girls"" marks his first track featuring actual production and overdubbing since 1995's The Cult of Ray. It also heralds the addition of Eric Drew Feldman-- producer of Black's self-titled solo debut and Teenager of the Year-- to his backing band's line-up. By far the greatest song on Heroes and Villains, ""Pray for the Girls"" perhaps offers a glimpse into Black's next album. The song is insidiously catchy, and gives these characters his trademark lyrical treatment with lines like, ""Downtown to have a talk with the mayor/ He told my masters, uh-oh, can't you see/ What we have here is a prophecy/ Cross your fingers, people, say a prayer/ I'm not a religious dog but I say that/ Better pray for the girls/ Ain't no other hope in this whole world."" If Black can toss off a song this great about a topic as restrictive as Blossom, Buttercup and Bubbles, his next album has the potential to parallel some of his early solo work. The Apples in Stereo offer ""Signal in the Sky (Let's Go)"", a track that's not nearly as awful as some of their recent work. However, cringe-worthy lyrics abound, especially during the chorus when Robert Schneider sings, ""A signal in the sky-oh/ That's when you know you have to fly-oh."" But let's be honest-- this soundtrack is targeted more at kids than teenagers and adults. Little kids aren't gonna give a shit about the lyrics. Plus, they'll eat up the song's simple melody. You know what the Shonen Knife song sounds like. We'll skip that one. As for The Bill Doss... sorry, Bill. You have to practice pitch before you start singing on your own records. It's not endearing. Even infants will be sent running in terror from this one, as Doss howls tunelessly over warbled piano and a drum machine beat sporting all the creativity of a metronome. Also, the kids will disagree with the lyric, ""Mojo Jojo's making evil plans.../ He'll only win in the end/ When he can begin to be friends."" Bill, watch an episode of this show before you write a song about it. Mojo Jojo never wins, for any reason, and the Powerpuff Girls would never befriend him because he's evil. Like Kindercore! Bis close out the record with ""The Powerpuff Girls (End Theme)"". Now, I hate Bis as much as the next cynic, but I have to give them this one. I mean, sure, it doesn't take a lot of talent to write a catchy song-- The Promise Ring have proven this time and again. In fact, ""catchy"" often has a repellent effect. But for some reason, I kind of enjoy Bis' super-charged cartoon anthem. It's one of the better TV theme songs going right now. I also kind of enjoy the theme to Diff'rent Strokes and the one from The Jeffersons, but I wouldn't listen to them in my car. The same holds true for Bis, of course, but as far as theme songs go, this one's up there with WKRP in Cincinnati. Now, I'm not going to encourage you to buy this album, especially not for your own personal use. It's the Powerpuff Girls! Did you honestly need my input on this? However, it is a lot better than I suspected it might be. I will say that if you have children in elementary school, they'll love it. But since parents account for a very small percentage of the Pitchfork readership, I can really only recommend this to die-hard Frank Black worshipers and you creepy Kindercore fanatics out there.","The album cover says, ""Music inspired by The Powerpuff Girls.""

Not because it teaches children state capitals or multiplication tables, but because of the one truly invaluable piece of information you can attain from it: life is unfair. Adults can be completely indifferent or downright evil. Your worth as a human being can be judged entirely on spelling bees and long division, and your intelligence can be your own worst enemy. Sure, one of the tenets of education is the encouragement of natural intelligence. But being pegged a ""brain"" can be devastating, and not just because of the impact it has on your social life. No, when you're a ""brain"", a certain level of work is expected of you. God help you if your first written assignment in third grade sounds like a college dissertation-- everything you ever write after that will be held to ridiculously high standards. While you're getting scorned for an A-, the kid who sits in the back of class and flings boogers at the wall gets a pat on the back and a candy bar for a C+. Had The Spectrum Between been released by anybody other than David Grubbs, it would garner instant critical acclaim for its impeccable songwriting and instant accessibility. The artist would be declared the new John Denver, and whimsical yuppies around the world would instantly make it a best-selling record. But this is David Grubbs. This is the man responsible for Gastr del Sol and 1998's brilliant The Thicket. As much as any other musician to come along in the past ten or so years, Grubbs has pioneered new ground for pop music by combining inventive instrumentation and dynamics with cryptic, staggeringly intelligent lyrics and always-impeccable songwriting. With The Spectrum Between, Grubbs breaks away from any kind of avant-garde aesthetic, leaving him with his voice, his acoustic guitar, and 36 minutes' worth of delightful pop songs. And while the record is thoroughly enjoyable, one can't help but feel that Grubbs is capable of something more. Even if a bit flimsy in comparison to other Grubbs releases, The Spectrum Between provides us with a liberal dose of amazing moments. ""Gloriette"", the record's undeniable standout, begins innocently enough, with Grubbs strumming his acoustic guitar and singing a pretty vocal melody at a relaxed pace. About halfway through the song, John McEntire contributes his patented inventive drumming, increasing the song's tempo two-fold and completely shifting its groove. McEntire's welcome entrance is followed by a brief, squealing saxophone solo from Swedish reed player Mats Gustafsson and some additional guitar meandering courtesy of jazz guitarist Noël Akchoté. Somehow, all these distinct elements combine to create a blissful and compelling song. ""Whirlweek"" and ""Show Me Who to Love"" follow a similar formula to a lesser extent, due mainly to McEntire's percussion. The rest of The Spectrum Between consists largely of mellow acoustic numbers such as ""Seagull and Eagull"" and ""A Shiver in the Timber"", and experimental, drone-laden instrumentals like ""Stanwell Perpetual"" and ""Preface"". The acoustic tracks never fail to please, with Grubbs' expressive guitar work and occasionally John Denver-esque vocals always remaining agreeable. And the more streamlined nature of these songs make them instantly enjoyable. The two instrumentals are quite good as well, but seem extraneous and displaced in comparison to the rest of the record. It's hard to find any outstanding flaws in The Spectrum Between. It's a lovely record, and perhaps the first David Grubbs album that your parents will like as much as you do-- maybe more. Still, rather than forging a new future for pop music, the record's roots are firmly planted in the past, relying on more traditional arrangements and verse/chorus/verse structures. Thus, this thoroughly enjoyable piece of work receives a 7.9, with a heartfelt ""I know you can do better"" attached.","I've always been a firm believer in the value of early education.

Your Favorite Music,Clem Snide,by: Michael Sandlin,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a5f19d034d5c69bf3401/1:1/w_160/8bc9806c.gif,2000-06-30 05:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1498-your-favorite-music/,Sire,"True, Clem Snide's music shares similar funhouse-mirrored folk/bizarro-country concepts with the likes of veterans Lambchop and Palace. Unlike the great Lambchop, however, Clem Snide's contribution to the Snore-core movement features little but silly, oblique wordplay with music as mere afterthought: lethargic bass lines, barely-strummed C, G and F chords, maybe some morbid violin accompaniment. In the end, you're left with a boring, vague abstraction of country music. I'm not saying these guys have to necessarily choose between complete sincerity and over-the-top Ray Stevens parody. But can't we be entertained without forcing ourselves to accept these overbearing attempts at being ""different?"" Yesiree, NYC's Clem Snide seems targeted for Next Different Thing greatness. They've also been ludicrously compared to both Hank Williams and Jonathan Richman. Your Favorite Music has even been likened to the Velvet Underground's eponymous 1969 album. Insane! And sorry, but dopey, meandering songs like ""The Dairy Queen,"" featuring mundane slices of small-town teen life, can't even compare to the best of Don Williams, much less the worst of Hank. As for the Richman comparisons? Listen to Jonathan Goes Country, then see if you can keep a straight face while discussing Clem Snide's inherent genius. It seems Clem Snide have squeezed themselves into the perfect hip micro-genre. Uh, let's say... lo-fi post-irony country vaudeville. Much like the empty conceptualist/visual ironist Damien Hirst, the band thrives simply on their acquired Next Different Thing status. The lead singer even has a ""different"" name: Eef. And enduring his grating faux-country nasal drone, coupled with the band's constant struggle to merely change chords, is like being subjected to the never-ending slow drip of a leaky faucet. Lyrics like ""Tonight we're gonna party like its 1989,"" and ""How's that Deep Purple record I hummed in your ear/ Like a fight song whispered through a pillow,"" beg for laugh tracks. Worse yet, Eef sings all this nonsense with utmost deadpan detachment and exaggerated apathy; which, in the indie community, is often confused with charm. Funny thing about Eef, though: he's misanthropic and cynical as hell, albeit in his own insidiously subtle, ""aw, shucks"" sort of way. Take the sarcastic ""African Friend,"" for instance. The singer intimates that his girlfriend is insecure with her pigmentally-challenged self. She becomes interested in a more ""exotic"" person of color. Be yourself, says the threatened boyfriend, and come back to the sensitive everyday white dude: ""Come lay on the couch with me/ We don't have to work on our tans."" I ask you, America, is this funny? ""I Love the Unknown"" pokes fun at a drifter type whose excuse for eluding responsibility and relationships is found in the song's title. The title track is, for lack of a more obnoxious critical categorization, repetitive irony-drenched neo-folk trip-hop. Here, Eef, ever the elitist gonzo philosopher, derides a female whose tenuous hold on individuality is wrapped up in listening to sad, obscure music: ""Your favorite music/ Well, it just makes you sad/ But you like it/ 'Cause you feel special that way.../ I can't teach you to learn to love yourself."" Ahh. The lyrics, at best, seem coughed up in a random stream-of-semi-consciousness: ""roads paved with liver and onions""; ""your heart's a muscle, that's all""; ""jumping jacks could ease your mind""; ""you smell like bread""; ""cutting my teeth on her shoulders."" And once you've made it as far as their seemingly faithful cover of Richie Valens' ""Donna,"" the album's relentless tongue-in-cheekiness has warped your judgment: should I be enjoying this as a serious cover? And if I like it, will I be secretly mocked by the band? Your Favorite Music is nothing more than a bad joke; one your favorite neighborhood hipsters pretend to get, for fear of being ostracized by whatever indie-centric social milieu their lives depend on. If you're an outcast like me, you don't mind admitting these songs aren't even as childishly amusing as your roommate's new architecturally-unsound haircut. You really wonder, then, how a band this dreadful can be deemed to possess such genius, and gain such a following. Then again, consider how we ended up with Jim ""Ernest"" Varney as our president. The Age of Idiocy is upon us, folks. We've got 'ol figurehead Dubya, his band of faux-Christian lunatics, and pseudo-musicians like Clem Snide all on the same path to world domination, fooling the easily-duped masses every step of the way.

You Think It's Like This But Really It's Like This,Mirah,by: Meg Zamula,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c55aeb335119a49ed9b5/1:1/w_160/a8f241ad.jpg,2000-06-30 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5327-you-think-its-like-this-but-really-its-like-this/,K,"Not that I can't speak for myself, but I've been troubled by the recent dearth of intelligent female voices in indie music. I'm too smart for Lilith, too boy crazy for Mr. Lady bands, and too sane and reality-based for Cat Power or Mary Timony. So, where's a girl to turn in her more contemplative moments? Lately, a good option has been K Records, which has brought us Marine Research/Heavenly's Amelia Fletcher, Rose Melberg and Jen Sbragia of the Softies, and now Mirah. Although this album marks Mirah's full-length debut, it's already evident that she's an accomplished songwriter with a distinctive lyrical bent. At times, Mirah has a Liz Phair-esque libidinous bluntness, but she lacks Phair's cynicism. Instead, Mirah maintains a charming naivete which perfectly compliments her girlish voice. These elements may seem contradictory, but as the album title suggests, there's more to Mirah than it may first appear. Her juxtaposition of these two qualities allows her to deliver lines like, ""If we sleep together will you be my friend forever?"" with poignant sincerity. The opening track, ""Million Miles,"" an account of small town life with acoustic accompaniment, might lead listeners to expect the rest of You Think It's like This but It's Really like This to be of a similar minimal, folky nature. But again, we've been misled. ""Of Pressure,"" one of the album's highlights, begins with a simple drum machine beat and gradually layers on organ, handclaps, tambourine, fuzzed-out guitar, real drums, and additional vocal tracks as Mirah asks, ""Is this a release or/ A build up of pressure?"" The clever production answers the question. The rest of the record similarly rewards careful listening, whether based around heavily reverbed guitar and murmured backing vocals like ""La Familia"" or the delicate violin arrangements of ""Archipelago."" Whereas most female singer/songwriters leave me either ambivalent or vaguely embarrassed, Mirah has crafted an album that thankfully lacks standard Sarah McLachlan hippie antics. She transcends the ""female artist"" ghetto without being afraid to write about boys-- a rare accomplishment, indeed. I never suspected Calvin Johnson would be ever a pivotal force in women's music, but his signings prove me wrong.","Not that I can't speak for myself, but I've been troubled by the recent dearth of intelligent female ...

The album, his solo debut, featured an impressive number of MCs from the thriving San Francisco hip-hop scene. One of its first tracks, ""Styles Crew Flows Beats,"" features the Lootpack crew. The group passes the mic dexterously, each doing his part to heighten the flava until the groove suddenly shifts and an eerily high- pitched voice strolls into the proceedings. Quasimoto, he calls himself, and the remainder of the track is little over a minute of the finest underground hip-hop on record. He seems hyperactive and ready to burst, yet his rhymes are laid-back and his tone remains almost resolutely monotone with limited inflections. Let it be known, then, that Quasimoto is no mere mortal. He is the brainchild/ alter ego of Lootpack member and producer Madlib, a sped-up manipulation of his own twisted rhymes. But injecting a little self-reflexive post-modernism into music never hurt anybody. Just ask David Bowie what it can do for a career. Instead of recording a proper solo album for Peanut Butter Wolf's Stones Throw imprint, Madlib decided to give his other persona top billing, and he pulls it off to a degree. His production generally mixes sparse loops of spoken samples with obscure funk and R&B; overtones, grounded by tight, snappy beats. ""Return of the Loop Digga"" is an engagingly funny paean to his mad production skills. Here, Madlib steps up to document his rise from stealing records from his auntie to laying down tracks for his man Quas. The 'Moto, for his part, starts strong as the ""bad character"" of the project: \x93I smoke a nigga with a brick/ Talking out of place/ Like I was sniffing paint/ Laced/ Lining up outta space."" Damn! The delivery of lines like ""dropping shit like some horses/ Irritate your mindstate/ Have you split like divorces/ Of course this is the new breed/ Fuckin' up the mainstream"" are pure gold, but by the middle of the album, it becomes clear that Madlib decided to cheat his alter-ego out of ontological priority rather than simply let him be. As the man behind the boards and the squeaky little man up front, Madlib accords himself too many shout-outs, too many poorly disguised pats on the back, and makes too many appearances as himself for a character album. And while by no means fatal, this is the primary fault of the project. The Unseen is an above-average contribution to the resurgence of the old- school aesthetic, but it could have been better. The record is littered with great moments-- such as the sci-fi manifesto of ""Astro Black"" and the moving musical backing of ""Come on Feet""-- that make me hope this isn't the last we'll hear from Quasimoto. But for Quasimoto to convince, Madlib has to chill. Let him record his own album.","A few years ago, estimable hip-hop producer Peanut Butter Wolf did his part in \n\ heralding the new breed of ...

Pole v. Four Tet EP,Pole v. Four Tet,by: Mark Richardson,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a0c39d034d5c69bf27c8/1:1/w_160/3d420e29.gif,2000-06-26 06:01:40,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6369-pole-v-four-tet-ep/,LeafLeaf,"The concept for this brief EP is simple: Stefan Betke (Pole) and Kieran Hebden (Four Tet) each created an original track, and then each remixed the other's work. I was half-ignorant when I put this one on the turntable, since I still hadn't heard a Four Tet full-length. I had, however, heard some of Hebden's remixology. His outstanding reworking of Aphex Twin material is probably the only track off the mediocre Warp 10+3: Remixes compilation I still listen to. And since I'm already a fan of Pole's post-iron-curtain dub, getting these two together sounded intriguing. First, the originals. Pole's ""Heim"" is a solid, undulating cracklefest that's not too far from the material off 3-- it actually would have been among that record's better tracks. It veers more toward faint melody and steady bass groove, and away from abstract ambience relative to his first full-length. ""Heim"" is not going to win Pole any new converts-- it's hard to imagine what he might do that would at this point. But if you have his kind of itch, it scratches nicely. Four Tet's ""Cload"" is a fast, upbeat track with a bit of rock and some dub-style production. The drums are typically precise, with the overall energy of the piece compensating for its lack of melodic development. The EP's standout, by far, is Four Tet's remix of Pole's ""Heim."" Whatever elements remain of the original are slight; some vinyl crackle, maybe. (It could just be my copy.) But the beauty comes in the added material: Four Tet adds a crisp, penetrating beat to anchor the track, and working against the confines of this ridged pulse is a sampled piano passage consisting of impressionistic piano flourishes. In any other context, the piano might come off melodramatic, at best. But after the tension builds in this Old World v. New World battle, loops twisting and expanding, the piano finally emerges alone for a sad, delicate, and truly affecting coda. The record closes with Pole's brief remix of ""Cload,"" adhering fairly closely to his formula, but maintaining interest through the subtle weaving of the source material. This short one-off EP may not be easy to track down, but with three solid tracks and one really great one, it's got my recommendation.","The concept for this brief EP is simple: Stefan Betke (Pole) and Kieran Hebden (Four Tet) each created an original ...

Sound of Water,Saint Etienne,by: Zach Hooker,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a33813d1975652138a3f/1:1/w_160/692dfbba.gif,2000-06-22 06:01:40,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6970-sound-of-water/,Sub Pop,"When last we heard from Saint Etienne, on last year's near-miss Places to Visit EP, they were doing their best Oedipa Maas impersonation. There they were, locked in some motel room with Jim O'Rourke, likely wrapped in untold layers of protective clothing, and engaged in elaborate tricks to avoid actually giving anything up. That release, while occasionally enjoyable, was hobbled by its unwillingness to make good on any of its promises. Thankfully, Sound of Water manages to pull off exactly what Places to Visit hinted at. The album follows the EP's trajectory by marrying Saint Etienne's signature pop smoothness with a slightly more avant-garde spirit. But where its predecessor was thin, rough and square Sound of Water is entirely the opposite. It's a fully realized implementation of Places to Visit's frustrating, if enticing, unfinished experiment. Don't go getting crazy ideas in your head, though. We're talking about Saint Etienne here, not Nurse with Wound. There are no 15-minute stretches of eldritch rattling noises here. When I say ""avant-garde spirit,"" what I really mean is ""glossy avant-garde sheen."" This isn't to say that their version of experimentalism is false, hollow or cautious, but they're not going to forget what they're all about. Which, as we all know, is style. The end result is an album filled with great pop songs that have been augmented with some fairly non-standard beeps, clunks and whirs. The album is cohesive enough to allow that conceit, and none of those non-standard noises sound forced or tacked on. The songs flow effortlessly along, and even the instrumental tracks are fully developed-- none suffer from the half-finished feel that made Places to Visit so dissatisfying. Much of the credit for this can probably be attributed to the band's collaborators To Rococo Rot and Sean O'Hagan who provide squirm-style effects and string arrangements, respectively. The record's standout moments come with the borderline balladry of ""Sycamore,"" with its naturalistic acoustic guitar and backwards cymbals, the especially beepy-clunky-whirry (but still hooky) ""Don't Back Down,"" and the nine-minute opus ""How We Used to Live."" Beyond that, the record is generally enjoyable, if still somewhat similar to previous efforts. As with past Saint Etienne albums, Sound of Water is ear-candy all the way through. Still, they've managed to add a layer of subtlety and novelty beneath the glossiness-- or at least they've managed to coat their stylish exterior with a couple extra-thick layers of varnish. Either way, the result is the same as always: a pretty tasty album, even if its shelf-life may not eternal.","When last we heard from Saint Etienne, on last year's near-miss Places to Visit EP, they were doing their ...

I've learnt so much (and bought so little!) from its glossy, stark pages. For instance, when I'm next in Stockholm (no doubt checking out a Svek Records showcase), I'll be able to converse in faltering Ikean Swedish. I'll be able to discuss how much joy I get from my five-inch tall Snorra Kanin (or ""plush bunny,"" in our vernacular). But I'll never learn the correct equivalent of ""lovingly crafted,"" ""expertly finished,"" or ""lifetime guarantee."" This upsets me because I would love to describe Richard Davies' raw, predictably over-achieving new album in the resilient language of home decorating. But though Barbarians arrives in flat packaging, no assembly is required. Davies and his band have abandoned the polished production of 1998's Telegraph in favor of a live-sounding, plug-and-play ambience. Here, Davies provides critics with yet more reasons to throw laurels his way, and still further incentive for the public to ignore his obvious talents. Like the Loud Family's Scott Miller, Davies makes songwriting seem a complete doddle. Whereas less talented songwriters might crowd a song with clunky lyrics and noodly melodic digressions, Barbarians showcases Davies' effortless ability to extract straightforward hooks from guitar strings, with no extraneous nonsense to get in the way. Despite the fact that Barbarians never provides an ear-melting classic like Telegraph's ""Canteen,"" I'm more than satisfied bugging out to the dominating echo that becomes a melody during the flawless ""Palo Alto,"" or the twanged and cracked arpeggios of the album's opener, ""Coldest Day."" ""The Kiss Off"" exhibits paisley influences with a bassline that recalls the Incredible String Band's lysergic hey-nonney-no. And who could not be impressed with ""May,"" a song so striking it could have been part of Tim Buckley's Dream Letter set? When I saw Davies perform in a tiny D.C. club, he filled the room with his panache. He didn't need to fall back on studio trickery. Up on the slightly raised stage, he flaunted his gift and his unmistakable love of music. Barbarians is a wake-up call to all those who labor in studios for a unique, fuzzing guitar sound. If your songwriting goes to eleven like Richard Davies' does, you just need to be heard, and certainly do not deserve to be left on the prefabricated chip-board of under-appreciation.","Of the many catalogs that clog my mailbox, my favorite by far is the quarterly Ikea tome.

The cover of Pole's first release was solid blue, the second was bright red, and this one is all yellow. From the outside, this is all that differentiates the three CDs, and many might say that there's even less difference in the music. These people have a point about the sameness; hell, even Betke would admit that Pole has a pretty narrowly defined sonic trademark. He makes vaguely rhythmic, dub-wise music constructed in part using the crackles from a defective pole filter, a device used when mastering vinyl LPs. Static pops, electrical buzzes, surface noise-- these are a few of Betke's favorite things. And what most people consider the annoying by-products of a retro music storage fixation, Betke considers instruments. CD 3 is a good news/bad news kind of record. The good news is, if you've been unsure about Pole, understandably reluctant to spend your money on quiet, crackly ambient music, your prudence has been rewarded. This is definitely Pole's best record, and it's by far the most ""pop"" (as opposed to just ""click-and-pop"") of the three. The familiar scrapes, snaps and hisses have been relegated to the background here, as opposed to being the focus of CD 1, and the accessibility factor has definitely been upped. The first five tracks in particular should appeal to any open- minded fan of dub, as Betke meets the rockers uptown with deep, melodic bass, reverberating keyboard refrains, and loads of spacy atmosphere. ""Überfahrt"" (alright, quiet down-- it means something entirely different in German) is particularly hypnotic, as every melodic and percussive phrase slides lazily in and out of the mix, echoing back from whence it came. And if you get high enough, you could probably actually dance to ""Rondell Zwei,"" a tune that marches steadily forward on the strength of a downright catchy, substratic bassline. Somewhere, King Tubby is smiling. The bad news is that if you already own a Pole record or two, it's tough to recommend buying another-- they're just too similar. CD 3 completes my Pole collection (except for those rare 12-inches), so I now own three albums of his minimalist, fractured techno records. Frankly, it's making me feel like an asshole. So, do I sell the first two and just hold on to CD 3? Probably.

Cursive's Domestica,Cursive,by: Taylor M.

His voice doesn't gracefully arc up to touch glorious high notes or frolic easily through melodic fields; it's grating, laborious, and a bit slurred. But a more earnest, volatile, emotionally charged voice cannot be found. The utter sincerity behind that which he writes, the perfect inflection and expression from the far-from-perfect vocal chords, the brains evident behind the guitar brawn: these things are what make Kasher's voice sound gorgeous. I've come to the conclusion that the worst thing about Cursive's new record is that it's actually called Cursive's Domestica, which is painfully reminiscent of the maligned Mad Season by Matchbox Twenty. Excepting this small item, Cursive's Domestica is the bands most mature, cohesive work to date. The announcement of a new Cursive album should have come as quite a shock to the band's fans in light of the litany of reports detailing their breakup. If this were so, then the brilliant Storms of Early Summer: Semantics of Song would have been Cursive's A Series of Sneaks: a dazzling, albeit tragically ignored swan song. Instead, scarcely a year and a half later, we have Cursive's Domestica, an album which continues the profound dialogue left off at the close of The Storms of Early Summer, but steers the band in an entirely new direction: concept album territory. No, don't hit the Back button! Cursive actually pull it off in style, faithfully cataloging their interpretation of the politics of love and the unraveling of a relationship. Kasher, recent divorcee, claims that Domestica is not at all autobiographical. It's times like this that I wish that I knew how to scoff at something in multiple languages. Let's examine the evidence at our disposal: the album sleeve is brimming with pictures of a couple engaging in the throes of domestic life, each one depicting the woman conducting herself with complete sincerity as the male gazes despondently into the distance. The lyrics are fiery and bitter, or utterly jaded, making a mockery of the words we say and the lies we fabricate in relationships; things that one must experience firsthand in order to write about them so accurately. Let's never speak of this non-autobiographical tomfoolery again. The Cursive sound has evolved alongside the sentiments of its frontman. Cursive have retained their razor edge, creating pulsing, rapidly evolving guitar-based music, yet they're now fueled and guided by the meaning behind the music. The cohesion of lyrics to musical intensity and songwriting is at its peak on Cursive's Domestica, as the expressiveness of the music is as volatile as any relationship, swooping down from furious to somber in a fraction of a second. The addition of new guitarist Ted Stevens has changed the candor of the rhythm section, making it more dissonant and varied in its attack. Crunching guitars and throbbing bass dominate the record, arranged shrewdly beneath Kasher's anguished screams and urgent whispers. Cursive's Domestica is certainly one of the finest hard indie rock releases of the year thus far and has established an impressive staying capacity in my CD rotation. Kasher's intelligent, thought-provoking lyrics resonate perfectly inside the head of anyone who's ever seen love go sour. ""The Martyr"" is a standout anthem to those jilted with the finer sex and their perceived emotional volatility, with the ingenious refrain: ""Sweet baby don't cry/ Your tears are only alibis."" Songs like ""A Red So Deep"" rock hard while keeping emotions firmly attached to sleeve, asking bitterly, ""Are you satisfied tonight?"" At only nine tracks, Cursive's Domestica suffers from brevity, but not much more. If you're happily linked with a member of the opposite sex, stay away from this record. Otherwise, the world needs Cursive.","Cursive's Tim Kasher has what is perhaps the worst great voice in indie rock. His voice doesn't gracefully ...

Groove OST,Various Artists,by: Al Shipley,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6e39d034d5c69bf365a/1:1/w_160/94e96377.gif,2000-06-20 05:00:03,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7864-groove-ost/,KineticKinetic,"Funny, I'm not at a rave, and I'm certainly not on e, yet I'm grinding my teeth. Maybe it's the music. Sony Pictures' attempt to cash in on the burgeoning rave culture with the plotless feature, Groove, succeeds, in a way. The film's soundtrack sits nicely alongside the other dozens of ""continuous mix"" compilations that see release every year. Of course, this probably says more about electronic music that it does about Sony's shot at street cred. The film's music supervisor, DJ Wish FM, assembled each of the album's 14 tracks into a seamless mix. This proves to be no large feat, as the entire first half of the disc shares almost the exact same BPM. And truthfully, for the record's entire first half, it would take a watchful eye on the disc player display to determine where one track ends and the next begins. Sure, some slight variations appear, but none are substantial enough to stir interest, and the others are too predictable to be subtle. Every five or six minutes, a new bassline, synth sweep, or percussion flourish arises, with little consideration to composition or cohesion. Yes, it's dance music. Fortunately, the second half the album is a little more interesting. Orbital drops an ethereal female vocal over ""Halcyon + On + On"" to better effect than the over-the-top vamping of the album's earlier vocal samples. Big-beat mainstay Bedrock's ""Heaven Scent"" is poised as the high point of the film and the big single off the soundtrack, but it stands out from the other tracks less than it brings the homogenous elements to pounding new heights with a splashy synth melody and monolithic bass pumping. The track also paves the way for Groove's true standout. As ""Heaven Scent"" segues into Hybrid's ""Beach Coma,"" the beat dissolves almost entirely, replaced by a fizzing ambience of jazz sax and distant hi-hat sizzle. Slowly, the tension rebuilds into a straightforward house beat flanked by whirring basslines and minimalist piano flourishes. The album ends on another high note with Scott Hardkiss' mix of Alter)Ring's ""Infinitely Gentle Blows."" Sweeping in with oddly manipulated vocal textures, the track sports a crisp beat whose bass boom actually makes room for a tight snare on the upbeat. As with the Hybrid track, ""Infinitely Gentle Blows"" really shines when the beat drops out and leaves the textures sputtering into each other, one gorgeous layer on top of the other in a dizzying free fall. Like any mix worth its salt, Groove has enough exceptional moments to occasionally overcome the underwhelming sameness, but is ultimately much more suited to the dancefloor than the home stereo.","Funny, I'm not at a rave, and I'm certainly not on e, yet I'm grinding my teeth ...

Home is Where You Hang Yourself,Her Space Holiday,by: Kristin Sage Rockermann,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c0b2eb335119a49ed42f/1:1/w_160/5e847d7e.gif,2000-06-20 05:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3824-home-is-where-you-hang-yourself/,Tiger StyleTiger Style,"PSAs on TV tell kids ""don't smoke"" and ""just say no to drugs."" Similarly, record reviews point out that ""Le Tigre is smokin'"" and ""just say no to the Explosion."" In the late '80s Sting and Kristy McNichols kept America's USA Network-watching youth off crack with one hand while saving the whales with the other. Today, Pitchfork keeps hard-earned pocket change from being dropped on mediocre recordings with one hand. I'm not at liberty to say what is done with the other. Both PSAs and record reviews are philosophically grounded in the G.I. Joe school of ""knowing is half the battle."" Just as Partnership for a Drug-Free America's Politburo once sat around a board table and nodded knowingly when their marketing consultant baited, ""Hey, who here has ever fried an egg? Every one of you? Exactly!,"" the Pitchfork Politburo has suggested I review Her Space Holiday's Home is Where You Hang Yourself by relating the album to an experience to which our readers can relate. THIS IS A DEAD-END TEMP JOB. I know my weaknesses and can admit that the Alanis Morissette Lyric Generator can describe the dead-end temp job experience with more eloquence than I can. It seemed appropriate in content as well as in form as the site is a quintessential ""temp-toy."" I feel miserable
Paper clips tear at my foundations
I feel miserable
Free candies rot the flesh from my bones
I feel miserable
Time cards are doing their best to impale my soul
I want to die Is it because I'm a temp slave that I feel this way?
With the blue rays of misery pounding on my brain?
Or am I lost in a tale of Edgar Allan Poe, adrift far from home
I don't think so, I don't think so. THIS IS A DEAD-END TEMP JOB ON HER SPACE HOLIDAY. I feel nice
The office now has those plastic-coated paper clips
I don't feel them or the guitars
Floating among tracks of drum machine sequences
Synth organ drones and soft electronic accents
Reminiscent of flying saucers and fake wind
This candy is in the Space Holiday office is sweet
But as long as I don't listen too long
It's not quite sugary enough to rot my teeth I feel nice, I feel fuzzy, I feel dreamy
Of course, none of this Zoloft-rock has any shot at impaling my soul
I feel nice, I feel nothing, I float away
Is it because of Her Space Holiday that I feel this way? \t\t\t I check out the disc I just popped into the CD-ROM in my cubicle's computer. It's the first half of a 2xCD called Home is Where You Hang Yourself. The second song, ""Snakecharmer,"" begins. Her Space Holiday's audio-Prozac begins to melt the abject flatness of a corporate law office into a slow, dreamy space-rock haze. Things seem different. I take a look around the place. I vaguely remembered photographs of the corporation's partners framed and mounted on the reception area wall. In their place now were photographs of Bedhead, Codeine, and Low. I heard one of the secretaries whispering that they kept a photo of Yo La Tengo in the desk to look at now and then, but didn't display it in the reception area as the photo was too dirty and ""loud,"" even as it had softened with age and sunlight. The receptionist had a soft, airy voice with a dragging but measured tempo that made his words blend into meaningless syllables. The clock's ticking became a lethargic percussive track, hypnotizing with its smooth regularity. In the conference room, they flatly discussed passion while swilling balanced tracks of layered narcotics. This album's lyrics are mostly about the fragile optimism that is produced when love interacts with things like suicidal tendencies and anorexia, but the production, songwriting, and emotionlessly dreamy tone are all pill-pushing slow-core opiate clichés. THIS IS A DEAD-END TEMP JOB ON HER SPACE HOLIDAY'S REMIX DISC. This is the law office's space-themed holiday party. Her Space Holiday's Marc Bianchi sent invitations to Aspera Ad Astra, Bright Eyes, and Duster. He sent two invitations to himself. This party is over-produced, fancy and boring, but it's faster and more awake. There are trays of dehydrated space food hors d'oeuvres which the host serves to the guests with preprogrammed rhythms. Rather than slipping into detached daydreams, you are awake and aware of your surroundings. In fact, you're having small-talk with Bright Eyes! Just say no!

Mwng,Super Furry Animals,by: Matt LeMay,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a21ec0084474cd0bff8a/1:1/w_160/dfbf8c09.gif,2000-06-20 05:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7601-mwng/,Flydaddy,"For a territory only slightly larger than New Jersey, Wales has done pretty well for itself. Besides having its own language, flag, and cultural heritage, Wales has given the world Tom Jones, Richard Burton, and the world's longest-named train station, Llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwyll-llantisiliogogogoch. Damn! For a place with so much to its name, Wales' music has gone relatively unnoticed, until recently. As bands like the Manic Street Preachers and Super Furry Animals gain in popularity, the new ""Cool Cymru"" is drawing worldwide attention. Apparently, record executives scouting in the UK now spend as much time searching for new talent in Wales as they do in the rest of Great Britain. Super Furry Animals hold a special place among the new wave of hip Welsh bands. Whereas bands like Gorky's Zygotic Mynci and Catatonia might as well be English, Super Furry Animals have always shown an affinity to their native language, demonstrated by the occasional lapse into the Celtic tongue on past albums. Mwng (pronounced ""moong"") is the result of two weeks, £6000, and a bunch of Welsh-language songs Super Furry singer Gruff Rhys has been writing since the band's conception in 1995. The result is a charming batch of stripped-down rock songs that isn't as fully realized or inventive as last year's Guerrilla, but still makes a damned enjoyable listen. Mwng's opening track, ""Drygioni,"" may very well be its weakest moment. On Guerrilla, Super Furry Animals milked seamless pop songs to their full potential with ingenious electronic arrangements-- ""Drygioni"" feels almost forced. But the album quickly redeems itself with ""Ymaelodi \xC2'R Ymylon,"" a charming pop ditty complete with acoustic and electric guitars and overdubbed vocal harmonies. It's a summery pop song with all the trimmings, but it lacks the optimistic energy that made Guerrilla's poppier tunes so great. Mwng's high point, though, comes with ""Ysbeidiau Heulog,"" a decidedly retro number that combines the swingin' sounds of the '60s with some high-tech vocal effects. It's easy to see why ""Ysbeidiau Heulog"" was chosen as the first single from an album that's already reached #11 on the UK charts. The North American edition of Mwng comes with a bonus CD (called Mwng Bach), which consists of six tracks that are, strangely, every bit as good as the bulk of Mwng, if not better. Why the band didn't replace weaker tracks like ""Drygioni"" with obviously stronger outtakes such as ""Sali Mali,"" we'll never know. As far as I'm concerned, Mwng isn't Super Furry Animals' true follow-up to Guerrilla. The fact that these songs have been around for so long, and the fact that the band didn't put too much time or money into the record, suggests that Mwng might be better regarded as a prequel to the band's other three records, like Chuck Norris in ""Missing in Action II: The Beginning."" Mwng's relative strength as a record demonstrates Rhys' talent as a songwriter, but also demonstrates how much Cian Ciarân's electronic wizardry enhanced the band's other records. The lack of time and energy put into Mwng seem to have detracted from the fleshing-out of the album's better tunes, surely making it somewhat more difficult to create the kind of all-out pop masterpieces found on Guerrilla. Of course, Super Furry Animals have proven their talents beyond the shadow of doubt-- Mwng couples cultural pride with unforgettable melodies in a way few bands have ever attempted. That the band is capable of cramming a songs with names like ""Pan Ddaw'r Wawr"" and ""(Nid) Hon Yw'r Gan Sy'n Mynd i Achub yr Iaith"" in your head is commendable, if not downright astounding. But, as they say in the old country, ""Heb ddyfalbara athrylith ydy a 'n amhlantadwy gorweddfa:"" Talent without perseverance is a barren bed.","For a territory only slightly larger than New Jersey, Wales has done pretty well for itself.\n\ Besides having its ...

The After Birth,Caustic Resin,by: Zach Hooker,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a55b5e6ef95969320aae/1:1/w_160/dce438aa.gif,2000-06-20 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1359-the-after-birth/,AliasAlias,"Some things are unfairly dependent on the vagaries of mood as informed by time and place. It's not Caustic Resin's fault that I do not happen now to be sitting in a hazy, beer-soaked college dorm room circa 1992-- they have no control over that-- but, frankly, that is the climate in which The After Birth would flourish. My present moment-- being spent in a quiet room in an unassuming, Scandanavian-dominated suburb of Seattle, circa 2000-- is rocky, fallow ground where The After Birth can find no purchase. The air is clear, there is no wet towel stuffed into the crack under the door, and the only thing in the immediate vicinity which even remotely resembles a bong is an Ikea table lamp. The past has been left far, far behind. Not that this album is clichéd or simple. And it's not that it's textbook grunge or only suited to stoned, post-cafeteria get-togethers. It's just that the time's not quite right for The After Birth. The zeitgeist has modulated just a little-- just enough to make the album seem a bit off. The Screaming Trees posters have been taken down and we've all started preferring to sit in chairs rather than on the floor. We've begun to take the importance of housekeeping and punctuality seriously. It's not that we've grown up... well, maybe it is that we've grown up. This album could have received pretty heavy rotation had it crossed time and space and found itself in Farrand Hall in 1992. The opening Live Rust-ish instrumental would have gotten people nodding their heads and saying, ""Yeah."" The rest of the album would keep them interested in a friendly but slightly impersonal way: maybe inspiring comments like, ""Hey, skip ahead to number seven!"" or ""I like it when the guitar does that jenka-jenka-jenk thing there."" But when it's over, nothing much remains of The After Birth, other than a feeling of uncertain nostalgia. It's like fondly remembering a night on which you're positive you had a great time, but can't at all remember what happened. The album's sound is just as blurry: is it Wayne Coyne fronting a Grateful Dead cover band, or is it Jerry Garcia and Crazy Horse? Does anybody know what this song is about? Or even what it's called? Where did all the Captain Morgan's go? Who wants a pizza? But again, it's not Caustic Resin's fault. They just wrote some rock songs, went into the studio and played their instruments as well as they could, and offered the results in good faith. I honestly hope there are some guys out there somewhere with a hackysack, no shirts, and the need for some tune-age who could give this album the warm welcome it seeks.","Some things are unfairly dependent on the vagaries of mood as informed\n\ by time and place.

Merriment,Vic ChesnuttMr. & Mrs. Keneipp,by: John Dark,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a5a25e6ef95969320b55/1:1/w_160/13f2e701.gif,2000-06-19 05:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1428-merriment/,Backburner,"Some artists are wedded to their geography. It would be unimaginable for Sonic Youth to hail from Tulsa, and impossible for Oasis to reside in Bakersfield. Even schlock like Marilyn Manson makes sense in the context of originating from the moral void that is Miami. Athens, Georgia has been Chesnutt's creative crucible for the past dozen years, and it makes a lot of sense. His lyrics reflect his environment-- one that's equal parts small-town charm and southern-weird. The album Merriment is a collaboration in the Mermaid Avenue sense. Chesnutt was happily bamboozled into singing and scribing words to the already-extant music composed by Backburner Records honchos Kelly and Nikki Keneipp. One suspects from the aural evidence that the work was done with Chesnutt in mind all along, and was handed to him to put his indelible and hand-carved stamp on it. With a modicum effort, you can hear hints of Lennon, Chilton, Richman, Black and even fellow Athenian Stipe in the lines and chord progressions. But Merriment is more an example of archetypal songwriting than it is derivative. The arrangements are streamlined and efficient, relying on linear piano and acoustic guitar integers to serve as the dais upon which Chesnutt showcases his gifts. And as always, whether on concept albums like The Salesmen and Bernadette or in the honesty of his earlier work, Chesnutt's warped wordcraft and hound-dog yodel take center stage. The title track sets the tone at the start of the album. A treatise to slapstick, ""Merriment"" carries itself with nobility, a majesty flaunting an ambition to be Vaudeville's national anthem. The song declares in closing: ""Bless the idiot/ That makes us split a gut/ Roses for the butt of all our merriment."" Throughout the disc, the music itself doesn't vary enough from its median to distract. Rather, it serves as a consistent segue mechanism, linking the miniature narratives together. Other songs, such as ""Fissle,"" wax bizarre: ""Carbon ends up caramelized/ In the perforated sky/ Fissle, every one."" And ""Smell the mighty monkey/ Trainer is a junkie/ And the tightrope walker/ Has one foot in the grave"" in ""Mighty Monkey"" are the first brushstrokes of a portrait of a degenerate carnival. You must realize by now that you've been tricked by Vic Chesnutt, the Br'er Rabbit of folk music. He doesn't write songs, he writes short stories. In Merriment, ghostly, dream-like images flit across your brain like fingers across pages, orchestrated by Chesnutt's frail voice and sinister lyricism. Chesnutt doesn't write songs, he directs and stars in film shorts: brief vignettes of wintry, slow-motion nativities radiating holiness and tableau dioramas of circus train wrecks. Vic doesn't write songs, he paints crude, unnerving folk art-- scenes like the album cover in which a smirking misshapen man with a bandaged head stands in the middle of a dirt country lane holding 11 roses and a homemade sign.",,8.0,
Music for a Stranger World EP,Bis,by: Rich Juzwiak,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a2bfb1335d7bf1698574/1:1/w_160/2e4ded6b.gif,2000-06-19 05:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/724-music-for-a-stranger-world-ep/,Lookout!Lookout!,"Fuck ""The Powerpuff Girls."" It's not bad enough that the crime-fighting trio's huge, jaundiced eyes haunt me as they stare from the backpacks, t-shirts, and Burger King watches of little girls all over the city; the merchandising tour de force-cum-television show also concludes with a Bis song. This means millions of homes are being invaded daily by the most aggressively obnoxious Scottish band in contemporary music. That's absolutely reprehensible. Furthermore, fuck the powers that be at ""The Powerpuff Girls"" for giving Bis the opportunity to record the song in the first place. Early releases like Bis Vs. the D.I.Y. Corps and This Is Teen-C Power should have been sonic suicide notes. Bis were a fad that never quite caught on; instead of fifteen minutes, they had three-- when they appeared on ""Top of the Pops."" Maybe the band's imminent demise was wishful thinking on my part, but the fact that the Cartoon Network adopted Bis as their very own Alan Thicke has postponed any break-up proceedings. On this outing, Bis continue the retarded new wave retreads prominent on 1999's Social Dancing. The first 45 seconds of the album's opener, ""Dead Wrestlers,"" combines electro-pop with a thick disco bassline a la New Order. When ragged guitars join in during the chorus, the song disintegrates into something even Republica would have disowned. The arena-sized ""Are You Ready?"" is half-speed two-step, with beats only fit for handspringing and tumbling. The song could very well give 2 Unlimited staples like ""Twilight Zone"" and ""Get Ready for This"" a run for their money at cheerleading competitions. The 80's revivalism is only made worse by the perpetually grating Manda Rin on vocals. Rin sings with the finesse of a kindergarten brat with her hands stuck in her ears and her tongue lapsing out of her mouth. She's particularly repugnant when tossing off Skid Row-style introspection, like on ""Are You Ready?"": ""My heart beats fast as I try to forget/ What's hiding in my head/ Will it ever change, or will it end?/ Some days I can't pretend."" Sci-Fi Steven shares vocal duties, and, while technically a better singer, he sounds uncannily like Human League's Philip Oakey. Still, a slightly better voice will improve lyrical mediocrity. On ""How Can We Be Strange?"" he pleads, ""I'm not a fascist/ Just wish that folk wouldn't be so passive/ Toward the freak in the subconscious/ It's in us all so don't be cautious."" The song's social commentary about people being too ""normal"" could have been ripped from the sewn pages of a high school freshman's marble notebook. It's endemic of the band's globe-sized respective shoulder chips that make Bis more ridiculous. As they have been for over a half a decade, Bis continue to rage against a machine that doesn't care, and one that won't be won over by their rampant childishness. Their music is kitsch gone wrong, and the fact that they're sometimes aware of their cornball tendencies doesn't redeem the piss-poor material. Even if they were to mature lyrically, the fashionable new wave novelty on Music for a Stranger World suggests that Bis are, and always will be, tyke-minded copycats.","Fuck ""The Powerpuff Girls.""

Tired Snow EP,Beans,by: Craig Griffith,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a23c13d197565213880e/1:1/w_160/727a05ae.gif,2000-06-16 06:01:40,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/601-tired-snow-ep/,Zum,"These days, it seems like people are afraid of using technique to their advantage, fearing the ridicule of being considered insufferable musical wankers. This comes into focus with a band like Beans. Stylistically, their music lies closer to modal minimalism than post-rock, but both styles are notably present. Beans are definitely trying to create a feeling of wistful memory-- perhaps the afternoon someone died or the last time you they saw their former lovers. But ultimately, they fail to affect in the way they intend. Controlled dissonance abounds on the ethereal ""Miko,"" yet nothing more than softly strummed guitar, atmospheric piano, and bass enters the mix. And the title track, rather than the startling display of originality it longs to be, is essentially early Tortoise boiled down to its most essential ingredients, sans vibes and sound layering. I mean, I understand that everything's supposed to sound like it's falling apart in ""All-Encompassing Dust,"" but glaring musical mistakes distract me from falling apart with it. Another strike against them: their music is loose and seemingly unpracticed. They're clearly not purposely playing discordant notes and fumbling their equipment to create an ambience of depression or personal deconstruction; they just attempt music that goes beyond their technical abilities. Tired Snow's sparse production doesn't help matters. In fact, it's counteractive-- it puts the instrumentation directly under the lens of judgment, making the band seem like ants running from the burning spot. But the potential of these compositions saves Tired Snow from its undeniable amateurism. With a bit more rehearsal and more active production, Beans could display more ingenuity than incompetence, and create some genuinely powerful music. They're on the right track when they take measures to assure they don't overextend themselves-- ""Dark Cave at Creek"" tells a simple love story with a brief but beautiful poignancy-- but they could stand to do it more often. For instance, ""Alpaca Llama"" is a 16-minute performance piece recorded live with no overdubs (as indicated by the spoken intro and muddled crowd noise). On this track, the ambition is definitely present but never sees fulfillment. And by placing it at the end of a 38 minute-long EP, the band leaves the listener with an unpleasant feeling of anticlimax and drowsy disinterest. Time could change this band for the better. All it would take is some restraint and gained technical proficiency, things that tend to come more naturally as bands progress. In the meantime, there are thousands of more satisfying records to spend money on.","These days, it seems like people are afraid of using technique to their advantage, fearing the ridicule of being considered ...

As the title makes abundantly clear, Postcards and Audio Letters is a collection of found recordings of conversations, salvaged from cassettes found at thrift stores and garage sales. Yes, it says ""Damien Jurado"" on the disc's spine, but he's credited only with ""tape salvation and editing""; he doesn't sing or play on the album. In fact, there's no music on it at all. Instead, he's compiled 60 straight minutes of people talking. To Jurado's credit, he has selected and arranged the recordings such that a vague theme of love and relationships immediately arises. There's Robert and Angel, the regretful ex-lovers living in different countries; the bickering grandparents rambling on about what they did for Christmas; the lovestruck Dawn and Phil and their mushy answering machine messages; and Jim and Sharon, a divorced couple arguing over the welfare of their child. Sound like an interesting concept? Perhaps. Maybe the mere presence of Jurado, who's released two excellent albums of Nick Drake-like acoustic folk melancholy, is enough to keep your interest piqued. But would you really want to pay $10 or more for this? Think about it for a second: Postcards and Audio Letters is the type of peripheral art project that Jurado could just as easily have posted on his website in MP3 or even low-res RealAudio. With the Internet around, there's simply no reason (aside from the obvious financial one) to sell a disc of this material. It's not like the sound quality needs to be crystal clear, and besides, you aren't likely to listen to it more than twice, anyway. I'm not comfortable making any judgments of the artistic merits of Postcards and Audio Letters; as far as I can tell, Jurado succeeded at what he set out to do with it. But in the end, all we're really doing is listening to other people's answering machine messages. Voyeurism is only worthwhile when the people you're eavesdropping on are saying something interesting. Yes, Damien, it is indeed real life, but there's a reason ""Big Brother"" sucks.","Despite all the warning signs flung at me, I still feel cheated, somehow.

Rock 'N' Roll Singer,Mark Kozelek,by: Ryan Schreiber,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Founder</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bbfaea9e61561daa7376/1:1/w_160/b58e5d4f.gif,2000-06-13 05:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4524-rock-n-roll-singer/,BadmanBadman,"Poor old Mark Kozelek. The frontman for the in-limbo Red House Painters has been down on his luck seemingly since the beginning of time. Since his band's 1992 debut, Down Colorful Hill, his desperate longing for childhood has plagued his music like an eternal therapy session. After all these years, you'd think he'd be resigned to aging. Yet, here he is again, mournful and bitter as the day you first heard him. After the Red House Painters garnered a substantial cult following on London's influential 4AD imprint in the '90s, Kozelek left their roster over creative differences with label head Ivo Watts-Russell-- Ivo wanted to edit the 13-minute long guitar jams of 1996's Songs for a Blue Guitar to a more reasonable length, but this suggestion was vetoed. Instead, the Red House Painters took the pleasing, if occasionally plodding, record to filmmaker John Hughes' Island-funded Supreme Recordings label where Kozelek was given full creative reign over his music. After a major industry buyout, though, Supreme Recordings got the ax and has since been in a futile and apathetic search for funding. In the meantime, the Red House Painters' Old Ramon, which was recorded for the label in 1998, remains unreleased due to contractual obligations. However, Kozelek has apparently been given the right to release material through the Badman Recording Company under his own name. Rock 'N' Roll Singer is his solo debut, and his first release in four years. Rock 'N' Roll Singer is an acoustic album featuring three new Kozelek originals, three AC/DC covers, and a John Denver cover. Already, this doesn't look promising. Red House Painters albums are, for the most part, equally affecting, but the guys haven't ever been much for variation. Their saving grace has usually been the nicely arranged instrumentation and production. But you can't just do a whole album of melancholy acoustic ballads-- the majority of which you didn't even write-- and expect critical acclaim. While Kozelek does have a knack for turning literally anything into an authentic Red House Painters ballad, he's long since done it to death. We've already heard his lush, ethereal version of Kiss' ""Shock Me""; do we really need his predictably similar take on Bon Scott? Yes, it's stunning how much emotion he can pack into AC/DC's brainless '70s arena rock staples, but why three times? Kozelek's originals here are affecting as usual. His sensitive, downtrodden lyrics are again just a bit overwrought, but the simplicity of his delivery is still far more convincing than Jeremy Enigk's on Sunny Day Real Estate's The Rising Tide. Yet, sadly, aside from the wistful lead-off track, ""Find Me, Ruben Olivares,"" the melodies on Rock 'N' Roll Singer are far from captivating, and when your interest drifts from the lyrics, these tracks hold your attention like watching the effects of photosynthesis in real time. Rock 'N' Roll Singer is pleasant enough to listen to, but its tossed-off nature is transparent. Kozelek sounds like he wants to go to sleep. And it's a bad sign when you can barely stay awake for your own record's 28 minute duration. At this point, he needs an unlikely burst of creativity to propel him past what he's been stuck doing for 10 straight years if he wants people to keep buying his records.","Poor old Mark Kozelek.

Writers wearing button-down shirts with the sleeves rolled up don't hustle around a maze of cubicles while Ryan chews out rookies in his office. We have converted no lofts into spacious playpens loaded with iMacs and Nerf hoops. No interns yet. (Unless Ryan's holding back on me.) Mostly we sit around discussing music. And this isn't even done in the photogenic setting of a stoop or a coffeeshop. We talk about music constantly on the Internet, which, admittedly, is geeky.

Layers upon layers of treated and raw sounds blend into a thick headtrip. Piano, cello, sleighbells, keyboards, chimes, and more can be excavated from the mix. Singing guitarist Isaac Brock constantly obsesses over the afterlife, and with Deck's help he's found it, far out in space and inside his clouded, scattered brain. ""3rd Planet"" opens the record innocently enough. Isaac plucks a lovely fluttering acoustic bed before he admits, ""Everything that keeps us together is falling apart,"" tersely summing the human condition and the theme of the record in ten seconds. Suddenly, echoing, truck-sized drums stomp over the ebow-dripping chorus as Brock repeatedly pronounces under a sheet of reverb, ""The universe is shaped exactly like the Earth/ If you go straight long enough you'll end up where you were."" Those failing to find the brilliance inherent in Modest Mouse at this point, please check in your Xanax at the window and an agent will escort you to the Target music department. By the time track two, ""Gravity Rides Everything,"" begins with backwards drums, strums, and plucks, it's quite evident Mouse Mouse have traveled well beyond their past. The song's percussion relies on jacked drumstick claps and electro-bongos as no less than five guitar tracks float on aching melodies. Deck's hands keep the affair shimmering and clear, in what will undoubtedly vault him into the echelon of Fridmanns and Godriches. Laser guitar lines and Brock's wrath blare over violins and undulating bass on the massive ""Dark Center of the Universe."" Structurally, it's still classic Modest Mouse up to this point, excepting the volume of warped effects. ""Perfect Disguise"" quietly kicks off the otherworldly passage of Moon. A chorus sighs ""Broke my back"" over delicate pickings, sleepy kickdrums, accentuating banjo, and oddball guitar pings. Looping tones usher a nasty bassline and disco rhythms as ""Tiny Cities Made of Ashes"" ceremoniously kicks listener ass. Sinister vocal doubletracking bursts into crackled shouting. Those familiar with Modest Mouse's live show will instantly recognize this as a trademark moment for Brock screaming into his guitar pickups. This heavy march, driven by Jeremiah Green's hissing breaks, sounds wholly unique and creepy. ""A Different City"" sits like the obvious single. Flanged riffs pump Pixies-ish glee in Modest Mouse's tightest punch to date. After this brief foray into crunching pop, ""The Cold Part"" stretches out to infinity. Chiming guitar, strings, over-dubbed echoes, deteriorating machines, and thumping drums fill a dark, beautiful void as a ghostly Brock laments, ""So long to this cold, cold part of the world."" Any of Brock's prose is instantly quotable. ""Alone Down There"" announces, ""Hello, how do you do?/ My name is you,"" uncomfortably close to the inner ear. As the song crescendos with building, buzzing guitar, Modest Mouse distills Built to Spill's essence in two minutes. ""I don't want to you to be alone down there,"" Brock pleads. Angelic harmonies grant him his wish. The epic ""The Stars are Projectors"" furthers the future of rock in grand gestures. Shifting between acoustic interludes and searing guitar over pounding drums, lyrics postulate the Descartian notion that our world is merely an elaborate dreamscape. Pretty sharp for Northwestern punks. The pace soon accelerates as the song swirls into a sonic twister. Through studio trickery, warbling drums sound as if winds howl outside, prying the roof from above to snatch you into a maw of shrill violins and sheer feedback. A stripped death ballad peppered with accordion provides perfect comedown on ""Wild Packs of Family Dogs."" Thus begins the third movement of the record. ""Paper Thin Walls"" pops along in blue-collar fashion on cowbells and and woodblocks like fIREHOSE, while still injecting the haunted flourishes of the album. If Nirvana played folk with Massive Attack it might end up a bit like ""I Came as a Rat."" Standard power chords melt into astral tape manipulation. The calm, beautiful respite before the closing snarl comes in ""Lives."" ""It's hard to remember you live before you die,"" Brock sings over weeping strings. ""My hell comes from inside,"" he reminds. Back comes the resigned aggression. ""Life Like Weeds"" jangles and bows with still more poignancy. Most grand, expansive, experimental albums of this sort are expected to end with a quiet snuff. Modest Mouse explode into the noisiest, fastest piece to close the record. ""What People are Made Of"" cuts abruptly on fuzzed bass, clashing cymbals, and attacking guitars-- an ideal ending for a record centered on death and the inability to understand. So I've just taken you through the entire album. As a fan, I know this sort detail is expected of hallmark albums. In anticipation of the next masterpiece, we all soak up as much info as we can get. Getting geeked up is part of the drama. For the first time, Modest Mouse craft an album, not a collection of songs. That they manage to go beyond any other rock band out there is staggering. The sequencing weaves a dramatic ebb and flow of emotion. Every song is packed with fantastic sounds that reach out for space and salvation. The band is now precise and broad. Eric Judy's fluid bass quietly escorts the ear subconsciously through the appropriate moods. Green's drumming is playful and inventive. There is no way Modest Mouse will ever pull this off live. The space, equipment, and personnel needed seems limitless. Yet this scale rockets the album instantly into Vahalla. An intoxicating mix of uncertainty and confidence, The Moon & Antarctica constructs hallow approximations of heaven, hell, and deep space-- most of which exist vividly in Isaac Brock's questioning mind. OK Computer must be mentioned, for Modest Mouse just got invited to the same club. They can chat existentially in the sauna. But unlike's Radiohead's unease at technology and quickening society, Modest Mouse grapple with the general conjectures of humankind. The title aptly entails the whole of the album. Sometimes the most spooky, alien places are not too far off. Similarly, our immediate surroundings and internal environment feel even more otherworldly. Modest Mouse seek salvation in God, death, and relationships. Fortunately, the rest of us can sometimes find it in records.","It's not very exciting behind the scenes at Pitchfork.

Elephant Shoe,Arab Strap,by: Paul Cooper,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a0f013d19756521384f4/1:1/w_160/e3356657.gif,2000-06-06 05:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/274-elephant-shoe/,Jetset,"From the minds that mildly distressed their primary school teaching with a summer break report entitled Skag, Smokes, Buckfast, and Me comes more mumbling, more tossed off instrumentals, and still more stories of fumbled gropings. In other words, Scotland's most beautiful losers return to drive us stumbling for our Valiums and for soothing draughts of liquid Paxil. Despite licensing their debut single, ""The First Big Weekend of the Summer,"" for use in a Guinness ad, Aidan Moffat and Malcolm Middleton are still pissed at life, love, and the faint glimmer of happiness. Moffat is still warning us against cheating girlfriends and the paranoias they cultivate. But the fact that solace is never found at the bottom of a pint glass doesn't deter him from questing for that miraculous alchemy. Arab Strap's music is still fractured, Smog-like, and woefully beautiful. The group's pitted, narky ambience fuses Irvine Welsh with Brian Eno's Another Green World-- Elephant Shoe is ambient for the Tamazipan massive. Deep farping organs ground ""Direction of a Strong Man"" as Arab Strap's fine sense of pop rears itself majestically out of the morose morass. ""One Four Seven One"" deals with the gnawing suspicions that sneaky lovers engender. They make us dial those four numbers in the British equivalent of *69. The song's itchy, scratchy trip-hop beats exacerbate Moffat's barely concealed anger. It's a telling understatement when he utters, ""I can't take this lightly; you said I'm in a huff."" But the spindly, gangly guitar lines guide him though to his final disgust. Updating Jacques Brel's ""Ne Me Quitte Pas,"" Arab Strap offer ""Pajamas."" Except that Moffat doesn't offer a night unlike any other night we've experienced if we stay. He mumbles, ""Shouldn't we be naked/ Especially tonight/ Instead of being fat/ Instead of being tight?/ If you go/ Go for good/ Don't fuckin' joke!"" Moffat suggests that his companion shouldn't wear pajamas ""in this heat,"" and grumbles about ""the pissed up kids in the street."" A far cry from Brel's Elysian Promises! Can we condone lyrics like, ""We meet old friends at funerals/ And pretend that we've missed them""? Can we recommend a band that consistently releases albums ringing with loathing and destitute of any joy? Would we be complicit in a reader's dive into the same deep quagmire where Moffat and Middleton have developed gills? Well, we should at least express a note of caution. Arab Strap's depression is as addictive as their expression of it is alluring. Elephant Shoe isn't shocking, outrageous, or source material for a ""Jerry Springer"" special. It has none of the alkie humor of their debut; it's even more cynical than Philophobia. It's the starkly pedestrian, accurate portrayal of many impoverished, dependent lives. Elephant Shoe is a beautiful public service announcement, a plea for more than politicians' platitudes and token welfare assistance. The strap is strong now, but one day it will snap.","From the minds that mildly distressed their primary school teaching with a summer break report entitled Skag, Smokes, Buckfast, and ...

Melody of Certain Damaged Lemons,Blonde Redhead,by: Hefner Macauley,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a30dea9e61561daa4bc2/1:1/w_160/da34f646.gif,2000-06-06 05:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/804-melody-of-certain-damaged-lemons/,Touch and Go,"It would be easy to dismiss most of Blonde Redhead's output as a triumph of style over substance. Purveyors of all things avant-garde and chic in the NYC indie underground, the group's hipness quotient is horribly precious. Comprised of Japanese vocalist/guitarist Kazu Makino and Italian twins Amedeo (vocals/guitar) and Simone Pace (drums), Blonde Redhead's self-consciously arty clang has made me wish I was a hip ""no-wave"" New Yorker rather than an mere enthusiast of this band's works. Blonde Redhead's biggest detractors focus on the group's uncanny resemblance to Sonic Youth. But while Melody of Certain Damaged Lemons won't exactly silence such suggestions, it does seem to move conscientiously away from the influences that have marred the group's previous work. The title itself makes plain Blonde Redhead's musical M.O.: they've tempered their indulgences somewhat, and begun focusing on integrating hooks and feeling into their cavalcade of ringing guitars and propulsive percussion. It doesn't quite qualify as a pop album, but it definitely serves as their warmest and most accessible record yet. Perhaps the presence of Fugazi guitarist Guy Picciotto behind the boards has had something to do with this progression. This album is as much an advancement over Blonde Redhead's similarly Picciotto-produced 1998 LP, In an Expression of the Inexpressible, as Expression was over 1997's Fake Can Be Just as Good. Songs like ""Melody of Certain Three"" maintain the band's archetype while strengthening their grasp of dynamics-- Simone still pounds the drums in a murderous rage, but also leaves room here for some welcome tempo change. More surprising is ""Loved Despite of Great Faults,"" certainly the closest the group has come to writing a full-fledged love song. Amedeo's accented delivery of lines like, ""You will move with me/ We will stay still/ And words will move around us,"" connect moreso than Kazu's typically orgasmic vocalizations. Kazu is thankfully more restrained here without reducing her vocal contributions, the finest of which is ""This is Not."" Easily one of the most puzzling tracks the group has recorded, ""This is Not"" brings to mind what an unlikely collaboration between Blonde Redhead and the Magnetic Fields might sound like. While not necessarily distinguishing themselves immeasurably from setting and influence, Blonde Redhead have begun to produce music that evades such nets. The potential evidenced on Melody easily outdoes the band's previous outings and hints at a full flowering of their work in the near future. After all this time, the band are progressively figuring it out. So, rather than musing ponderously on life in the elegantly wasted East Coast Babylon, I can finally appreciate what it is Blonde Redhead are doing and expect them to continue doing better.","It would be easy to dismiss most of Blonde Redhead's output as a triumph of style over substance.

The Sophtware Slump,Grandaddy,by: Ryan Schreiber,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Founder</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bf8aeb335119a49ed232/1:1/w_160/874f270f.jpg,2000-06-06 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3545-the-sophtware-slump/,V2Will,"Yesterday, information came to me. It arrived in the form of a sentence, spoken by one of the esteemed Pitchfork writers. It told of big-time music critics calling Grandaddy's The Sophtware Slump ""album of the year."" Now, pardon me if I sound disturbed, but it's fucking March. Consider all the great bands with albums in the 2000 pipeline: Radiohead, The Wrens, Björk, The Beta Band-- do we really want to limit ourselves to Grandaddy this early on? Atmospheric pop has dominated Critics' Lists for too long. How long ago did Mercury Rev issue Deserter's Songs? Is this all we can aspire to in the future? Where's the goddamn rock these days? Isn't anyone interested in volume? While no one may ever step up to answer these questions, one thing is for certain-- time is running out for this genre, and I have a feeling it's not exactly going to age like wine. However, even at this late hour, The Sophtware Slump manages to sound reasonably fresh, yields its share of unshakable melodies, and excels in production. This is quite possibly the last great entry in the atmospheric pop canon. The lyrical content of The Sophtware Slump focuses largely on failed industrial machinery-- crashed airplanes, malfunctioning androids, and abandoned appliances-- returning to the earth, or just lying around broken. Undeniably, this is that blasted Radiohead influence rearing its twitchy eye. Yeah, since OK Computer, everyone wants to be them. Really, you can't blame people for attempting their own variations on the theme. OK Computer is, after all, one of the greatest albums our generation has experienced in its time. But bands need to realize that they're not Radiohead, and that no one ever made it into the history books by trying to do what another group had already done better. The Radiohead influence seems obvious here, coming from a band whose last album, the 1996 (pre-OK Computer) debut Under the Western Freeway, was comprised of light-hearted, Weezer-inspired sing-alongs. But surprisingly, Grandaddy inject the album with an air-tight cohesiveness, and enough of their own personality, emotion and creativity to warrant looking past the fact that someone's already succeeded in recording the ultimate anti-technology album. But Grandaddy do manage to stir up raw emotion and genuine sincerity over songs that are far hookier and more immediately accessible than Radiohead's. The album's anthemic opener, ""He's Simple, He's Dumb, He's the Pilot"" gives a glimpse into the album's multi-layered, airy, Godrich-esque production techniques, as well as its general disheartened feel and epic tendencies (the track runs almost nine minutes long). For the most part, the album's songs are solid to the point that they'd have the potential of becoming indie rock classics if frontman Jason Lytle wasn't content to beat you over the head with them. Out of the gate, these melodies are all enjoyable to an almost surreal degree. And most of them remain that way. The problem arises when Lytle plays the same bars repeatedly without relying on choruses or bridges (as in the almost torturous third track, ""Jed the Humanoid""). A few of these tracks also drag on just a little too long. There are few upbeat tracks on the album, and most of them come toward the beginning. After the heavy-hearted weight of ""He's the Pilot,"" the bouncy ""Hewlett's Daughter"" serves as a nice breather. ""The Crystal Lake"" stands as one of the album's highlights with its driving chorus and preprogrammed Cars-inspired keyboard scale. ""Chartsengrafs"" follows close behind, fueled by buzzing guitars and drawn-out harmonies. And finally, we come to the radio-ready ""Broken Household Appliance National Forest,"" a track about ""air conditioners in the woods."" But that's where the happiness ends. The rest of the album wallows in a depression so deep, it'd make your grandparents stock up on canned foods and dress in rags. The Radiohead influence really becomes apparent on the last four tracks. ""Jed's Other Poem (Beautiful Ground)"" resurrects a verse of ""Jed the Humanoid,"" sung a cappella, before launching into a sparkling, glossy epic and finally settling into the menacing ""Knievel Interlude (The Perils of Keeping It Real)."" ""Miner at the Dial-A-View"" kicks in after two minutes, encapsulating the entire album with longing, regretful lyrics (""I dream at night/ Of going home someday/ Somewhere, so far away""), distant melodic beeping, and a female voice giving instructions on the proper usage of the ""dial-a-view."" The Sophtware Slump comes to a close with ""So You'll Aim Toward the Sky,"" a spacious five-minute epic that opens with discordant guitar lines over subtle technology-related sound effects. The song repeats four lines over dramatic strings, chimes in the vein of ""No Surprises,"" and Jason Lytle's best Thom Yorke impression. And surprisingly, it's more effective and believable than derived and cloying. When the songs winds down, you're left with a feeling of genuine impact. Now, I'm not saying The Sophtware Slump even comes close to touching OK Computer, though I can see what about it might drive someone to call it ""album of the year"" this early on. But we have nine months to go! If we'd said Built to Spill's Keep It like a Secret was the album of the year in January, 1999, we wouldn't have been taking the Flaming Lips' The Soft Bulletin and the Dismemberment Plan's Emergency & I into account. So, watch yourself now, 'cause it looks like there's gonna be some pretty crazy hype surrounding The Sophtware Slump this year. And yes, the record is good, but as music fans, we have a duty to expect more from bands than recreations of albums past. We need innovators, not imitators, goddamnit! Think of the children!","Yesterday, information came to me. It arrived in the form of a sentence, spoken\n\ by one of the esteemed ...

The Last Match,The Aislers Set,by: Meg Zamula,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a030b1335d7bf1697f79/1:1/w_160/36954971.gif,2000-06-02 06:01:40,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/85-the-last-match/,Slumberland,"It's my second week writing for Pitchfork, and already I've been tempted by corruption. No, record companies aren't throwing cash, drugs and boy-toys at me in exchange for favorable reviews. It's something far more seductive: laziness. The Aislers Set's latest album, The Last Match, comes with not one, but three Pitchfork-ready review paragraphs printed on the back cover. Each is ostensibly about the band, although none of them actually describe its music. The first goes the pretentious route, referencing 17th century painters and European travel, the second is a sentimental description of ""late night obsessive scrawls and early morning echoes of kisses curling around the dawn,"" and the last is a self-consciously literary account of minutiae like ""a crushed soda can is beneath my foot, it's rusted red a dried wound on the frosted grey."" It would be only too easy to repeat one of these verbatim, and pretend to be more arty, wussy, or boring than I actually am. Unfortunately, I'd be forced to imply that The Last Match is arty, wussy or boring, and none of those things happen to be true. Amy Linton's songs are certainly well-crafted, but they aren't so abstract that allusions to other art forms are necessary to describe them. Musical reference points include '60s icons like Phil Spector, who originated the Set's girl-groupy multi-tracked harmonies, or a more proficient take on the fuzzed-out shambly pop of mid-to-late '80s groups like the Black Tambourine that the Aislers Set so clearly inspired. The three songs written by Wyatt Cusack, also a member of the more rocking Trackstar, are the most twee of the bunch, particularly since Cusack's fey vocals bear an uncannily resemblance to those of Belle and Sebastian's Stuart Murdoch. Linton, on the other hand, knows how to rock, as she proved in her mid-'90s group, Henry's Dress, which fused shoegazer shimmer with mod-rock. She's since forsaken the My Bloody Valentine influence, but The Last Match still packs a mod punch, particularly on ""The Way to Market Station"" and ""Been Hiding."" The Aislers Set don't slack on keeping things interesting, either. Their arrangements feature liberal doses of organ, hand claps, and occasional brass flourishes. Linton's lyrics capture the highs and lows of being a musically literate urbanite, throwing out lines like, ""I could be your sudden let's go out/ Could be your favorite bar in town,"" and a desperate plea to the frontman of British cult legends the Television Personalities, ""Please help me, Dan Treacy."" Normally, I'm not one to resist assistance, even of the unsolicited variety. For the Aislers Set, however, I feel compelled to put forth the effort myself.","It's my second week writing for Pitchfork, and already I've been tempted by corruption. No, record companies aren ...

Shalabi Effect,Shalabi Effect,by: Mark Richardson,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a3b6b1335d7bf16987b0/1:1/w_160/b311a8b1.gif,2000-06-01 05:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7090-shalabi-effect/,Alien8Alien8,"Just after Godspeed You Black Emperor! licensed f#a#oo to Kranky, the word was that their next release would be a split-CD with a band called the Shalabi Effect, to be titled Aural Florida. The split record never came to be, and Godspeed eventually released last year's Slow Riot for New Zero Kanada EP before settling down to work on the highly anticipated Lift Your Skinny Fists like Antennas to Heaven. As for the Shalabi Effect, it seems that when they were recording, they couldn't find the tape deck's ""stop"" button, and wound up amassing much more than a half album's worth of material. Enough material, in fact, to completely pack this two-disc album. Bold for a debut, no? The fact that Godspeed You Black Emperor's forthcoming opus also comes on two pieces of aluminum doesn't say much for the Canadians' sense of restraint. Have we learned nothing from the saga of Smashing Pumpkins? Fortunately, despite similar pretensions, this ain't no MACHINA/The Machines of God. In fact, this isn't even remotely close to being rock music, which helps a lot. The idea of extending subtle, meditative, drifting soundscapes into minutes in the triple-digits is somehow more forgivable. While this band does share a certain stylistic similarity with Godspeed (stuff like extended pieces, varied instrumentation, and Hebrew lettering on the album cover), the Shalabi Effect generally don't provide the pop payoff of Godspeed when their orchestral tension reaches a grand, thundering release. Instead, this music is more about the process than the resolution. Let's try to break this monster down into its component parts. The most immediately noticeable thing about this music is the strong Mid-Eastern feel. Part of it is the wide use of tablas and various hand drums on many of the tracks (there is no standard drum kit), and part of it stems from song structures and scales that seem duly influenced by the Indian concept of the raga. By combining hand drums with plucked guitars and banjos that repeat the same patterns with minor variations (some of these phrases consist of only a single note), a hypnotic, trance-like effect is created. The number of stringed instruments employed here is astounding. ""Mending Holes in a Wooden Heart"" even recruits Godspeed violinist Sophie Trudeau to create one of the album's best tracks, an evocative blend of ringing electric guitar, tablas, banjos playing Middle Eastern scales, and screechy violin that owes a lot to 20th century classical music. And on the next track, ""Aural Florida (Approach),"" we're offered nine minutes of twisted, mind-blowing guitar feedback, carved out of the silence by leader Sam Shalabi with the precision of an ice sculptor. The second disc offers even more variety. ""Mokoondi"" combines several flavors of hand percussion with a hypnotic guitar melody lighting up the Arabian Night. ""Amber Pets"" culls its ambient mood from slow, dreamy guitars processed to the hilt. ""Boardwalk of Apollo Beach"" is the most tech-heavy piece, jettisoning the drums and acoustic guitars in favor of rumbling, eerie electronics. ""Apparitions"" uses electric guitar drones in the manner of late-period Spacemen 3, with wavering chords and drifting delays. ""On the Bowery"" is the only track with vocals (sung by Strawberry's Deidre Smith), and it is outstanding: ancient Persian trip-hop played on period instruments that builds in intensity like the closing montage of Apocalypse Now. For consumers, this is what it comes down to: if you're into the drone and you're into space, and you don't need melodies, chords, or the other trappings of pop music, you're going to like the Shalabi Effect. If the idea of an acoustic guitar playing the same two-note pattern for five or six minutes while subtly modulating synths swirl around is about as appealing as listening to a car alarm, it's not for you. You have been warned.","Just after Godspeed You Black Emperor! licensed f#a#oo to Kranky, the word was that their next release would ...

The Soccergirl EP,Kid606,by: Paul Cooper,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bb83c0084474cd0c2892/1:1/w_160/69332404.gif,2000-06-01 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4407-the-soccergirl-ep/,CarparkCarpark,"Who'd have thought a cute soccer mum could melt Kid606's heart? Before he was smitten by her playful passing and spot kicks, Kid606 was the ear-shredding vandal of IDM. Not only did N.W.A. get a beating from our Kid on his reworking of ""Straight Outta Compton,"" and Public Enemy on ""It'll Take Millions in Plastic Surgery to Make Me Black,"" but also far softer targets, as on ""Luke Vibert Can Kiss My Indiepunk Whiteboy Ass."" On his own label, Tigerbeat6, 606 offered up tracks to like-minded hooligans and released We are All Winners, an ironic title unless you consider ""winning"" to be when all participants leave the session in tatters and with hearing impediments. The tranquility of The Soccergirl EP is as shocking as any of Kid606's brutal gabber. Over seven tracks, he reaches back to the early days of ambient and retextures it with his signature shards of white noise (albeit at a greatly diminished intensity). And in the process, he proves just how much of a big- hearted softie he really is. After the gliding Tonefloat drones of ""Start,"" Kid606 describes a ""Defective Boy"" in very David Kristian terms. Though a kick drum lurks deep within the foggy mix, it's the insistent burbles that propel the track. By the midway point, a tiny percussion set vainly strives to fill out the high end. Kid606 treats the forlorn ""If My Heart Ever Ran Away"" with similar poetic care. The referencing here is less to early Kraftwerk, and more towards any number of Pete Namlook collaborations. A sequencer line dominates and answers the ""if"" clause of the title with, ""Then life would be repetitive, echo-y, and indistinguishable."" But listen closely as 606 tweaks the surrounding sounds just enough to hint that he's lying through his teeth. Playing such tricks is a gamble, of course, but as this track clarifies, he's more than capable of pulling it off. From toying with Namlook, he takes on Tangerine Dream (their wasted Street Hawk years rather than the high magick of Zeit) during ""Thank You for Being My Angel,"" but I sense some insincerity in his gratitude. Though the track is louder and fuller than the preceding one, it lacks any elegiac nuance. It's bold, brash, and conveys very little-- a perfect show-off! The Soccergirl concludes as it began: serenely. ""Over"" hints at Oval's wounded disc schtick as Kid606 props up these delicate sounds with even softer layers. And just as we've become adjusted to this Kid's dreamy, gentle side, the disc ends. In retrospect, the strategy enacted here was pretty obvious. 606's previous material had so brutalized us that to go any further would be to flog a dying horse. Employing restraint and tranquility, Kid606 has startled us once again. Goal!","Who'd have thought a cute soccer mum could melt Kid606's heart? Before he was smitten by her playful ...

Ecstasy,Lou Reed,by: Kristin Sage Rockermann,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a241ea9e61561daa49c3/1:1/w_160/c893bad0.gif,2000-05-31 05:00:09,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6735-ecstasy/,Reprise,"Indulge in some stereotypes with me. We have Colombian coffee, Cuban cigars, Japanese lanterns, Canadian geese, Russian roulette, Greek gods, Portuguese sweet bread, Spanish fly, the Brazilian bikini wax, and Danish danish... es. Copenhagen's master bakers quietly but diligently ship confections bearing their country's namesake to coffee shops and bakeries around the world every morning-- but don't let their modesty fool you. Two of Denmark's larger exports are costume Viking hats and those dirty pens that reveal naked ladies when you turn them upside down. I was in Copenhagen for eight hours once, and as far as I could tell, the Danes ride free city bikes and drink beer in street cafes all day. The six-year old girls all looked punk rock. Grueling winters of short days and long nights drive teens into their basements where they consume vodka and listen to death metal and industrial music. Sure, that happens in New Jersey, too, but Lou Reed's Ecstasy hasn't cracked the Top 20 there. It has in Denmark. Amazon customers who bought Ecstasy also purchased recent releases by aging rock legends including Patti Smith's Gung Ho, Neil Young's Silver and Gold, and Marianne Faithfull's Vagabond Ways. I'm assuming that this demographic rocked out to Lou's earlier work only to find their shoulders ""car dancing"" to the irritating swagger of horns in Huey Lewis & The News' ""It's Hip to be Square"" several years later. This progression adequately prepared them for Ecstasy's careful studio mix of familiar-sounding riff-based rock songs and brass explosions. But before you can say ""adult contemporary,"" Reed sings, ""Not if I wrap myself in nylon/ A piece of duct tape down my back,"" pairing his casual and cool vocal execution with lyrics concerning the paranoia and masochism which can lurk in a passionate marriage. While Ecstasy is essentially a concept album about the fantasies and realities of love and family, it includes as much sex, drugs, and rock n' roll culture as any of Reed's earlier work. Sadly, the stubborn confidence of his once naïve voice has now disappeared. But at this stage in the game, no one's doubting that Reed has paid his dues on the wildside, allowing him to devote more explicit attention to the themes of helplessness and vulnerability his songs have always touched on. If some of the poetry is lost in this translation across decades, it's still a richly textured document that adds a few pages to the biography of a rock legend. As a huge Velvet Underground fan and a slow learner, I've maintained an unhealthy curiosity in Reed's recent output, and Ecstasy is certainly an easier listen than any material Reed wrote in 90s, let alone Moe Tucker's Dogs Under Stress or John Cale's Walking on Locusts. But of course, the disc is bogged down by endlessly mundane material. I remember the first time I heard ""The Black Angel's Death Song"". The recording might have been 15 years old, but I'd never experienced anything like the demonic seesaws of its electric viola feedback. Cale's screeching bow broke the veneer of disinterest in Reed's cadenced and schizophrenic lyrical poetry. The old VU classic still hasn't lost its odd thrill, but employing it as a comparison to Ecstasy's ""Like a Possum"", a similar attempt to pair a long poem with off-kilter sound collage, pushes ""the possum"" into the category of ""the unbearable."" However, you don't need any sort of attachment to ""The Black Angel's Death Song"" to find its bloated, extended relative unbearable. ""Like a Possum"" begins: ""Good morning, it's Possum Day/ Feel like a possum in every way/ Like a possum/ Possum whiskers, possum face/ Like a Possum."" The song continues through more than a quarter-hour's worth of tragico-absurdist lyrics that Lou speak-sings over a sloppy pastiche of slightly dissonant electric guitar and slow washes of fuzz bass, until it somehow makes its way to, ""Shooting and coming 'til it hurts/ O, holy morning/ Calm as an angel."" Equally cringe-inducing is the rockin' ""Future Farmers of America""-- an overwritten piece of commentary on race relations that sounds like Reed's best approximation of a young Jon Cougar. If Marianne Faithfull's latest brings her Vagabond Ways to an adult-contemporary audience, Reed takes his old vagabond ways and places them into that audience's living rooms to mingle with the lingering fantasies that might be interfering with their troubled marriages. His limited vocal range, which has always straddled the line between singing and speaking, maintains its uncanny ability to compel you to listen to his stories. It's just that those stories now belong to a 58-year old. This might explain the cover photo, which doubles as a shot of a man in ""ecstasy"" and a Bayer ad. Lou's eyes are closed, his lips are parted, and his head is thrown back while a red laser darts through his neck. I can't imagine what's going on here. Regardless, the Danes are still listening, and for a few more rotations, so am I.","Indulge in some stereotypes with me.

Essex Green EP,The Essex Green,by: Matt LeMay,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bca8eb335119a49eccef/1:1/w_160/7a0e580d.gif,2000-05-31 05:00:08,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2836-essex-green-ep/,ParasolElephant Six,"There's a wind that blows as winter drifts into spring that makes everything beautiful. I'd almost forgotten that it existed until this morning when I opened my window, and in rushed the subtle smell of early spring. As the sweetened wind permeated my room, everything around me seemed to get brighter, as if infused by some euphoric energy. And just when I thought that things couldn't get any more blissful, the harmonious sounds of The Essex Green's new EP first entered by head, each melody dancing around on my brain like an elated sprite. The opening track, ""Fabulous Day"", begins with a beautifully understated acoustic guitar and flute motif. As mild vocals and subtle percussive elements enter the mix, the tune begins to take the form of a gorgeous, fully realized pop song with a diverse but pleasing chord progression. ""Chester"" showcases singer/guitarist Sasha Bell's clear, almost child-like vocals, set against the backdrop of an ever-mutating but always riveting melodic structure. The song ends with a stark, beautiful keyboard part, replaying the original melodic theme. The final track, and one of the EP's standouts, ""Bald"", opens with an underwater congregation of backwards guitar, acoustic guitar, and wah'd-out electric guitar before warping into a Zombies-like groove, chock-full of shrieking organs. Suddenly, the rhythm slows to double-time, and the song shifts into blissful chorus. Then, seamlessly, the song shifts back to its original theme, and back into the chorus, before exploding into a divine sea of Hammond organ, drums, feedback, and reverb-laden acoustic guitar. The music on this self-titled EP is deceptively simple. But while it'd be easy to write The Essex Green off as just another purveyor of 60s pop, the band packs so many beautiful melodies into each track, and complements those melodies with such impeccably chosen instrumentation, that to dismiss this band simply for sounding somewhat like other excellent bands from days of yore would be a damn shame-- especially considering that The Essex Green don't limit themselves to sounds used by 60s groups. True, this record isn't groundbreaking, but it does what it's supposed to do with grace and originality. And months from now, when falls comes along, I'll be happy to have it with me as a reminder that spring will return again.","There's a wind that blows as winter drifts into spring that makes everything beautiful.

The scene was originally adapted from a Pitchfork review by Nick Mirov. INT. CHAMPIONSHIP VINYL ROB What's playing? DICK It's the new Belle & Sebastian. You like it? ROB I don't know. Yeah, I guess. DICK Yeah. [pause] But it's really not as good as their older stuff. I mean, there are some good songs on here, I guess, but they're not as good as anything from If You're Feeling Sinister, or even The Boy with the Arab Strap. It's weird, because the songs definitely sound better, but the album is still kind of disappointing. ROB [half paying attention] Hmm. DICK But, then, you know how when you really like a band, the first album you've heard by them usually stands out as the best? I mean, after that first great album you hear, bands pretty rarely measure up to your expectations again. ROB Yeah, that seems to happen a lot. DICK So, maybe this is really a decent album that I just don't like because my expectations are too skewed. But it certainly isn't the best thing Belle & Sebastian have ever done. Maybe half the album is good, but given these guys' track record, half a good album doesn't cut it. ROB What's the problem with it? DICK Well, Belle & Sebastian used to be just Stuart Murdoch's songs, but on Arab Strap, the other members started contributing songs, too. That's not so much the problem, though, because Isobel Campbell's two tracks here are really good. It's Stevie Jackson and Stuart David's songs that get on my nerves. ""Beyond the Sunrise"" is so pallid and lugubrious it's silly, and ""The Wrong Girl"" seems too insipidly poppy. ROB (sarcastically) A Belle & Sebastian song that's too poppy? DICK Hey, Stuart Murdoch's best songs have always been breezy, but they're usually given heft by dry wit and eccentric detail. On this album, his better songs are the sadder, more serious ones-- ""I Fought in a War"" and ""The Chalet Lines."" His lighter, more pop-driven songs come off more like parodies of Belle & Sebastian songs, or, at best, outtakes from past albums. ""The Model"" and ""Women's Realm"" sound like he's trying too hard, cramming in as much lyrical and musical detail as he can. All that decoration just crushes the song, which, you know, wasn't that great in the first place. ROB So, you don't like the record, then. DICK No, no, it's okay. But like I said, it's disappointing. I think in the long run, I'll listen to Sinister and even Arab Strap more than this one. BARRY enters the store. BARRY Holy shit! What the fuck is that? ROB It's the tape we've been listening to. And enjoying. BARRY Well, that's unfortunate because it sucks ass. BARRY ejects the tape from the stereo and tosses it over his shoulder towards DICK.

From The Vapor of Gasoline,Mercury Program,by: Taylor M.

Am I the only one out there getting worn out by the inundation of post-rock and avant-garde instrumental music which has recently struck us? Granted, it usually seems rather creative at first, but how many times can one really listen to the same unusual riff before the wave of aural numbness crashes down? Modal scales are certainly interesting enough in moderation, but only a few bands can successfully integrate them into every song without the listener wondering, ""Didn't I hear this same theme in songs three and seven already?"" As the indie world waits patiently for the reemergence of revered groups like Tortoise and June of 44, only the most courageous, avid fans of the genre dare to enter the fray of dangerously mediocre post-rock that sounds so bizarre that it often passes for genius. The most recent heirs to the vacant post-rock throne are the Mercury Program, a four-piece ubiquitously championed by critics and misanthropic webloggers alike. Many have attributed a prodigious talent to these four musicians that may not be undeserved, but is definitely premature. From the Vapor of Gasoline is a fine record, full of atmospheric tones and unique songwriting, but it's not the post-rock opus that so many have dubbed it. Of course, this is never the fault of the Mercury Program, but instead the record labels that incessantly proclaim that each release is ""surely a classic"" or ""certainly their best effort to date by far."" Though probably not a classic, From the Vapor of Gasoline is a solid sophomore release which carves its own niche in the venerable post-rock canon. This record is home to an interesting blend of noise, twisting, flowing guitar figures with ephemeral vibraphone sounds, backed by the pervasive, polyrhythmic tapping of snare and crash cymbals. Tracks like ""Reinventing a Challenge for Machines"" and ""Highways Like Veins"" feature a cutting breed of puncturing guitar which serves as the Mercury Program's signature sound. As my dad remarked earlier, ""This stuff will knock you out."" He was referring not to the sonic might of the tracks, but to the fact that the somber moodiness and repetitive quality of many of the songs puts one to sleep quickly if one is not careful. Following in the footsteps of many of their musical progenitors, the Mercury Program's original sound tends to be a bit too readily apparent and redundant in each song, with the feel of each track more or less exactly the same. From the Vapor of Gasoline lacks the musical versatility and variety of a truly consummate record, as the same combinations of instruments, identically calibrated, surfaces throughout. Like any forward-thinking post-rock outfit, the Mercury Program sprinkle frugal amounts of vocals on choice tracks, such as the effervescent ""The Sea is in Here"" and the shadowy ""Leaving Capitol City for Good,"" but this is not sufficient to drive the Mercury Program over the city limits from Pretty-Goodville into Smack-You-Around-Like-A-Naughty-Schoolboytown. From the Vapor of Gasoline showcases a band with much potential in the form of a record that's good for what it is, but not groundbreaking.","Okay, let's all be honest here.

Horse and Elephant Eatery (No Elephants Allowed): The Singles and Songles Collection,Of Montreal,by: Matt LeMay,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b9a65e6ef959693229f3/1:1/w_160/c0a2d72f.gif,2000-05-31 05:00:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5950-horse-and-elephant-eatery-no-elephants-allowed-the-singles-and-songles-collection/,Bar/None,"Somewhere deep in the heart of Athens, Georgia, there lies a 10-acre cornfield. Five feet from its northwest corner stands a single willow tree. One hazy Sunday afternoon, I set about reclining under this tree, when all of a sudden I heard a great rumbling. The earth beneath me began to crumble, and before I could move it bottomed out and I found myself plunging toward the bowels of the earth. Descending towards what I was sure would be my demise, I blacked out. I awoke in a brightly lit environment, surrounded on three sides by endless white space. Directly in front of me stood a gargantuan green metal gate, reflecting the mysterious light so intensely that I could barely look at it. ""My God!"" I said to myself. ""I'm... dead!"" ""Not so!"" I spun around to see where the mysterious voice had come from, and found myself face-to-face with six large elephants. To my amazement, the largest began to speak: ""Greetings, visitor. We are the six keepers of the Elephant 6 Kingdom. I am Fluffy, the elephant of precious cute."" ""I am Pinky, elephant of psychedelia."" ""I am Zanzithoph, elephant of bizarre and archaic instruments."" ""I am Fatty, elephant of dense, layered production."" ""I am Friendly, elephant of perpetually rotating band members."" ""I am Ringo, elephant of Beatle worship. And you have arrived just in time for the party."" Before I had an opportunity to interrogate the elephants, I was whisked through the green gates into a vast open field. The elephants led me to a massive circus tent that lay in the middle of the field. ""We cannot go beyond this point,"" spoke Pinky. ""We wish you the best of luck."" And with that, the six immense pachyderms dissolved into a sweet-smelling mist. ""Hello? Hello?"" No response, except the echo of my own voice through the distant hills. Timidly, I peeled back the curtain leading to the giant big top. The incoming flood of shapes and colors almost knocked me on my back. Inside, various creatures, all dressed in tie-dyed business suits were mingling, drinking bright green ambrosia from silver goblets. But before I could fully take in my surroundings, the ringmaster approached me. ""Welcome,"" he said. ""We've been expecting you. My name is Robert Schneider."" ""How did I get here?"" ""You got here through the door."" ""Yes, yes, but how did I get here?"" ""Ah, but the question is not how you got here. The question is, how did you get there?"" I looked around and, to my astonishment, I found myself standing on the opposite end of the circus at the base of a giant stage. Robert was nowhere to be found. A voice came from behind me: ""No time to dawdle! The band is about to play!"" ""Robert! What?! What band?"" ""Shhhh!"" I turned around to find that the stage, which only moments ago had been empty, was completely set up. Three skinny gents in silver t-shirts were standing onstage, guitars in hand, grinning at me. ""My name is Kevin Barnes,"" said a man with a guitar, ""and this is my band, Of Montreal. We are going to play some songles for you."" ""Songles?!"" The band started their set. From the moment they began playing, I could tell I was going to dig it. Of Montreal had all the tenets of a great Elephant 6 band-- the catchy melodies, the whimsical lyrics, the marching-band-on-acid aesthetic, it was all there in full form. I turned to Robert, who stood next to me, eating porridge out of a tremendous pink flower. ""Bob, these guys sound great! Let me guess... you're their producer?"" A pearl-shaped tear welled in Robert's eye. He replied, ""Alas, no!"" ""But Bob! They sound so..."" ""So Beatles? Yes, I know! Listen to 'Scenes from My Funeral!' Tell me that guitar part isn't taken straight out of 'Getting Better!'"" ""Well, they definitely sound like they like the Beatles, but I wouldn't quite compare..."" ""Oh, they do. They really like the Beatles."" ""I love how dense and layered the sound is-- the sound is just huge! It reminds me of..."" ""The Beatles?!"" ""Uh... Hey, what's he doing now?"" ""Oh... you see, Kevin likes to tell stories. This song is called 'Ira's Brief Life as a Spider'. It's about a spider who gets bitten by a snake hiding in a lake in a crater on his own tongue."" ""What in the fuck?! This is starting to freak me out. I love this music, but the lyrics are starting to get on my nerves a little."" ""Granted, the lyrics are a bit twee. But the music is so good! Kevin can write a good melody so effortlessly and arrange it impeccably."" ""Wait a second. Is this a Kinks song?"" ""Yes! 'World Keeps Going Round'."" ""Good tune. But couldn't Kevin have done a bit more with the arrangement? Wouldn't it have been that much better if he'd given Ray Davies a complete psychedelic makeover?"" ""Perhaps. Hold on, they're finishing the set!"" And as the last few notes rung out from Kevin Barnes' guitar, the array of strange creatures that, along with me, had made up the audience, returned to their underground dwellings. This left only Robert and I. ""Say, Bob, that was a really fantastic show! I'm going to pick up one of their records as soon as I get back. Wait a second... get back?! How am I supposed to get out of here?!"" ""Do not fear. One sip of this drink will return you to the place that you call home."" I grasped the silver-lined goblet from Robert's hand and took a quick sip of the iridescent liquid contained within. The second the drink touched my lips, I found myself standing back underneath the willow tree. The Elephant 6 Kingdom seemed nothing but a distant memory. Shaken, I gathered my bearings and started to head home. ""Boy,"" I said to myself, ""that was one hell of a trip. Kind of like..."" A familiar voice echoed in the distance: ""Magical Mystery Tour?""","Somewhere deep in the heart of Athens, Georgia, there lies a 10-acre cornfield. Five feet from its northwest corner stands ...

Myriad,Gregg Bendian's Interzone,by: Mark Richardson,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a26dea9e61561daa4a46/1:1/w_160/2213fc51.gif,2000-05-31 05:00:04,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/648-myriad/,Atavistic,"Sometimes, a very specific component of music triggers a subjective reaction that prohibits full enjoyment, whatever the merits of the whole. The kind of thing I'm talking about here is where one says of a band, ""I'd like them fine if I could just stand the guy's voice."" Many have no problem with this hypothetical voice-- some may even like it-- but for you, the voice provokes a visceral reaction that can only be overcome with great effort, if at all. Such is the case with my reaction to Gregg Bendian's Interzone, but this being instrumental music, it's not the voice I can't stand; it's the jazz fusion guitar. The guitar in question belongs to Nels Cline. Now, don't get me wrong. I can separate my gut reaction from my critical faculties enough to tell you that Nels Cline is a fine guitar player, picking his way up and down these complex scales with copious technique and sufficient melodic innovation-- he's easily holding his own with the best of yesteryear's fusion axe-men, the John McLaughlins and Pat Methenys of the world. But I can't hear the jazz tradition in Cline's guitar improvisations; all I can hear is a noodly sound that rubs me the wrong way, like bad Frank Zappa or the Grateful Dead's ""Space"". Fusion guitar solos just don't do it for me. So, Cline's guitar work aside, how is the rest of Gregg Bendian's Interzone? Quite good, actually. This is noir-ish jazz led by Bendian's clarion work on the vibraphone and glockenspiel, and backed by the energetic, driving rhythm section of bassist Steuart Liebig and drummer Alex Cline. Some comparisons could be made to John Zorn's more accessible work, like Spillane, and anyone who can imagine a rocked-up version of the Modern Jazz Quartet can picture what Myriad sounds like. ""Intrepid"" is the highlight here, with Bendian's melodic riffs being pushed into all the right places by Cline and Liebig. The appropriately titled ""Drive"" is similar-- it experiments even further with stop/start tempo shifts and punctuated vibe riffs. Less interesting are the drawn out, moody drone pieces like ""Diaspora"" and ""Sanctuary"" (a John McLaughlin composition) where the intros can last up to two minutes before the tempos shift at all. Still, on balance, this is tasteful, accomplished vibe-driven music that should appeal to fans of the Chicago instrumental scene willing to take the full jazz plunge. But don't say I didn't warn you about the guitar. ","Sometimes, a very specific component of music triggers a subjective reaction that prohibits full enjoyment, whatever the merits of the ...

Quality Control,Jurassic 5,by: Ryan Schreiber,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Founder</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c1c2c0084474cd0c33b7/1:1/w_160/94892900.gif,2000-05-31 05:00:03,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4330-quality-control/,Interscope,"""Hi, I'm Sean Lennon and you're listening to Jurassic 5."" This is not the kind of endorsement that instills high hopes in listeners. Yet, there he is, offering his phoned-in cameo seconds before a song called ""Great Expectations"" kicks in. Fortunately, the announcement comes after the Jurassic 5 have set themselves apart from the ranks of standard-issue underground hip-hop collectives and stagnating turntablists. Besides, later on, Sherman Hemsley from ""The Jeffersons"" makes an appearance, effectively neutralizing the Ono-ization. What sets the Jurassic 5 apart from the dead sea of generic hip-hop crews is their sheer charisma. These days, rappers either take their shit far too seriously to interest anyone outside their immediate clique or are too preoccupied with the innate shock value of slagging gays and killing wives. But these guys revert to a simpler time through the resurrection of styles first implemented by the Treacherous Three and Cold Crush Brothers. So, no, they're not doing something completely new, but at least it's a change from the pompous preachery of backpackers like Common, and the hokey forgettability of recent Automator joints. Quality Control serves as a somewhat lackluster follow-up to J5's self-titled 1999 EP, though it's got more than its fair share of top-shelf tracks. Turntable masters Cut Chemist and DJ Nu-Mark piece together generally innovative samples that keep the music moving, and occasionally even surprising, which is saying a lot considering the increasingly limited possibilities of hip-hop soundbytes. ""Doo Wop"" (not to be confused with the similarly titled Lauryn Hill song) is slick and fast-paced with an irresistible sing-along chorus and spliced-in barbershop quartets. ""L.A.U.S.D"" sports a J5 mission statement of sorts (""We are no superstars/ Who wanna be large and forget who we are/ Don't judge us by bank accounts or big cars/ No matter how bright we shine we're far from being stars"") over flourishes of Hammond organ. But the album's standout comes with ""Jurass Finish First"" which bounces along on a simple but strangely compelling two-chord piano riff and a massive, crystal-clear drum track. Now, I realize that hip-hop's primarily a singles-based genre, and that even a lot of the classic records have got their share of filler, but for my money, three out of fifteen's not cutting it. After countless, seemingly interchangeable tracks, this record could have benefited from its namesake-- or more preferably, a couple of other worthwhile moments. Cuts like the forgettable basketball anthem, ""The Game"", ""Contact"", and naturally, that goddamned intro, would have been better left in the vault or on the b-side of an upcoming single. But all told, it could be a lot worse. They could have had Sean Lennon freestyling over samples off Yoko's Starpeace. Let's not think about it.","""Hi, I'm Sean Lennon and you're listening to Jurassic 5."" This is not the kind of endorsement that ...

Svefn-G-Englar EP,Sigur Rós,by: Ryan Kearney,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a3f59d034d5c69bf2f53/1:1/w_160/276d0e7e.gif,2000-05-31 05:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7147-svefn-g-englar-ep/,SmekkleysaSmekkleysa,"I don't envy Boston's meteorologists. Not only do they cover most of New England, but they're facing a climate that's notoriously unpredictable and severe, running the gamut from incapacitating heat to marrow-freezing cold, from nor'easters to hurricanes. Under a hovering deadline, they must assess their data using experience, education, and intuition, and then reach a conclusion. And all for what? So that their audience is-- as one media catchphrase goes-- ""in the know?"" Hmm... these responsibilities sound strikingly familiar. After all, music critics also throw their opinions out to the world and pray that history doesn't ruin their credibility. Recently, drastic weather patterns headed for the northeast U.S. had meteorologists hailing the ""storm of the half-century."" As the predictions became increasingly dramatic, so too did the public's panic. By the time the storm was supposed to hit, everyone was too busy closing schools and buying emergency supplies to notice that nothing had happened yet. And when the storm finally arrived, it wasn't even the storm of the decade. Sure, it dumped an inordinate amount of snow. But, in my town alone, the 'perfect storm' of 1991 sucked a house out to sea, sent forty-foot walls of seawater into the air, and threw boulders the size of Geo Metros onto the causeway. And that was supposed to be a routine storm. But that's just the way it is with storms. And rock bands. Some hit without warning, like Nirvana, and others are boosted as much by prehype as by the music itself-- like Reykjavik, Iceland's Sigur Rós. Since reading our own Brent DiCrescenzo's review of \xC1gætis Byrjun-- in which he called them ""the first vital band of the 21st Century""-- you've probably seen the hype swell, like a beached whale in summer, from indie publications all the way to Spin's Top 20 of 2000. Not that I think the hype is unwarranted: I was among all but two Pitchfork critics to have \xC1gætis Byrjun in my Top 20. While history has yet to fully validate DiCrescenzo et. al., the Svefn-G-Englar EP-- originally released in 1999, but just reissued by the UK indie Fat Cat-- is additional proof of Sigur Rós' immense talent. The disc's first two songs also appear on \xC1gætis Byrjun: with its rumbling skies, wailing sirens, and a distant toll, the nine-minute title track builds like a scene out of The Odyssey, then clears in a flash. A calming organ sets the foundation for an onslaught of searing guitar notes and Jon Thor Birgisson's alien vocals-- a Joycean concoction of Icelandic and the band's fabricated patois 'Hopelandish.' Aside from the awesome descent at the three-minute mark, the song's movements are subtle; one must patiently wade through them to feel the swirl of conflicting emotion. ""Viðrar Vel Til Loftárása"" is a decidedly different piece, opening with a plaintive piano and romantic swells of strings. While not carrying as much emotional depth, this song is decidedly more uplifting-- even teetering, at times, on the level of a dramatic Hollywood film score. But just before reaching maudlin proportions, it either pulls back, turns to orchestral chaos, or is torn open by a guitar wielded like a power saw. The two tracks that comprise the second half of the EP were recorded live at the Icelandic Opera House in 1999. ""N\xFDja lagið"", a previously unreleased number, opens at a turtle's pace with casual kickdrums, a snare, light strumming, and a feedback-laden guitar. When Birgisson's demanding voice enters, it doesn't sound nearly as feminine or foreign: he actually sounds like a male, and one feels as though, with enough concentration, the lyrics are almost decipherable. While the inhuman nature of Birgisson's wails is one of Sigur Rós' most compelling and unique traits, these more hominine vocals work well here, particularly during the descending moments when Sigur Rós are at their darkest and most poignant. ""Syndir Guðs"", an alternate version of a cut from 1997's Von, is equally slow, but more melancholy than funereal. The trademark guitar streaks are held to a minimum (except at the end) and the rest of the instruments are unobtrusive for the song's entirety. This places the emphasis fully on Birgisson's voice, which vaults into the stratosphere like Neil Young and Elizabeth Fraser performing a duet on helium. For those who don't own any Sigur Rós material, this EP is a good introduction to the band. Those of you who already own \xC1gætis Byrjun are understandably concerned about the 1:1 ratio of songs you have and have not heard. But the two live tracks make this disc worthwhile for at least the addicted fan, of which there are more every day. So is Sigur Rós ""the first vital band of the 21st Century?"" I'm not venturing a guess. But they are, without a doubt, a vital band. There's no risk on my part in saying that.","I don't envy Boston's meteorologists.

The Discovery of a World Inside the Moone,The Apples in Stereo,by: Mark Richardson,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a0dfc0084474cd0bfc99/1:1/w_160/ecdeb303.gif,2000-05-31 05:00:01,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/256-the-discovery-of-a-world-inside-the-moone/,spinART,"Did you ever wonder how the whole nostalgia thing played out 30 years ago? Which bands in the late 60s were like, ""Fuck this acid rock shit, the 50s had the best music!"" There was Sha Na Na, I guess. Were they a real band? I know they played Woodstock, somewhere between The Who and the 'Dead with their slicked-back hair, sunglasses, and that guy Bowser flexing his muscles and sneering. For Sha Na Na, good music stopped being made when Elvis went to the Army and Jerry Lee married an eighth-grader. They weren't having none of that late-60s mess. And now, as the 20th century fades into the distance, more than a few bands feel the same disdain for the 90s. The best example in indie circles are inarguably the bands that make up the Elephant 6 collective, a paisley constellation that seems to orbit around Robert Schneider and his Apples in Stereo. To take these groups seriously, we have to ask: is it possible that the best rock music of all time was made in the 60s? Beatles, Beach Boys, Kinks, Who, Stones, Zombies, Turtles... an impressive list, considering they all hit the charts within a four-year period. But the best? Well... Of the aforementioned 60s bands, the Beach Boys are the one that comes up most when people talk about the Apples in Stereo. This stems from the fact that, like the Beach Boys, the Apples display little Black American influence in their music. The Beatles, after all, knew their way around blues changes, and their knowledge of artists on the Chess label went deeper than Chuck Berry. The Beach Boys, on the other hand, copped Berry's licks without every wondering where they came from. And Robert Schneider's gaze gets a little blurry somewhere right around Carl Wilson. If The Discovery of a World Inside the Moone fails to find the Apples branching into James Brown territory, it's still the band's most diverse outing, and debatably their finest. Wisely jettisoning the noodly experiments that made Her Wallpaper Reverie seem much longer than it actually was, the Apples turn their focus squarely back on the catchy song, with a more pronounced feel for instrumental variety. ""Go"" kicks off with rollicking horns and corny background vocals that give the flavor of a lost Mutantes song. ""The Rainbow"" is far too sunny and upbeat for all die-hard power-pop fans, but there's no denying the strength of the tune. ""Stream Running Over"" is the best track here and, for my money, the most irresistible thing the band has done, with a simple and profound melody drawn from the finest pop archetypes. There's a slight dip in quality on the rest of the record, but it still ranks as smart, workmanlike pop for those who like their pop music poppier than necessary. ""20 Cases Suggestive of..."" is fuzzy, 80s-style pop/punk, with pregnant drummer Hilarie Sidney offering her Go-Go's-inspired vocals. ""The Bird That You Can't See"" finds the band struggling to get on the good foot, as it alternates between funk and rock beats, but in the end, the awkwardness makes it a charmer. And ""Allright/Not Quite"" changes the pitch up with some screaming from Schneider on some of the verses, a technique he should attempt more often. Most of the ballads are pretty ineffective, though-- they're just a little too slapped-together to sound sincere. But the folky, acoustic ""The Afternoon"" ends the record on a pleasingly wistful note. Yes, we've heard it all before, but it's still pretty good for what it is.","Did you ever wonder how the whole nostalgia thing played out 30 years ago? Which bands in the late 60s ...

The Rising Tide,Sunny Day Real Estate,by: Brent DiCrescenzo,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a5ba9d034d5c69bf3372/1:1/w_160/85785741.gif,2000-05-31 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7583-the-rising-tide/,Time Bomb,"Are you ready to admit the Peter Gabriel factor? Or, even more frightening, the Yes and Rush factor? Not only does The Rising Tide dip its toes into sucking whirlpools of late 70s arena prog, but it stands as one of those albums that forces listeners to ponder the inevitable third act of even their most fond bands, wherein Our Hero finds his fate in a bloody climax of vocal effects, drums solos, eco-conscience, last-flash valiance, and fatal flubs. And while this specific Hamlet hasn't yet expired from the poison tip, his muse Ophelia is long gone, and the audience knows all about the venomed chalice. So what course brought Sunny Day Real Estate to this misfortune? The largest finger-pointing targets are producer Lou Giordano and the paring of the band into a trio. Giordano, most widely known for his work with Live, dunks Sunny Day in a vat of liquid and covers them in chrome. The reflective surface serves only to magnify and spotlight the occasional songwriting errors. On past efforts, frontman Jeremy Enigk's passionate bleating benefited from indecipherability. The mystic and emotional force stemmed from his foreign throat. With greater control and pronunciation, Enigk now recalls a piping Jon Anderson-- specifically ""We Have Heaven"" from Fragile. Giordano floats crystalline vocal layers above a flat silver landscape of swooning, fervent arena rock. With this highlighted clarity, Enigk can derail a track with one jutting word. On ""Rain Song"" (there's that pesky, generic, Rainforest Café-brand environmentalism), Enigk drops his voice to repeat, ""And it's candy,"" which isn't completely terrible until juxtaposed to the surrounding, fluttering castrato sighs. The real rub is how Enigk enunciates the bulging word like ""khaan-DEE."" It sticks out like a bellybutton on a supermodel. Similarly, ""Snibe"" becomes the fist-pumping ""Mah-KET-place!"" and ""Gov-UN-ment!"" song (aka ""that vocoder song"") and ""Television"" is remembered at best as the ""Tell-eh-vhiz-sheun-eoooo-ooo-yeoooo-ooooo-uooo"" song (aka ""that digital didgeridoo song""), if at all. To further frustrate, Giordano laminates the uncountable layers of strings, pianos, plucked acoustics, and synths with tacky corn syrup. The obvious signifiers scream, ""Hey! Lookee! I'm pretty!"" as much as do slow-motion, auburn lighting and slow dissolves in a John Woo film. Occasionally, the drama and props pay off. ""The Ocean"" slowly drops rippling pearls into molten quartz with sweeping effect. It's the loveliest the band have ever sounded. The closing title track shimmers like vintage Cure sloshing around inside a glass goblet. And Sunny Day must have been lucky band #1,000,000 to name a song ""One"", as it tugs, dances, and punches with seductive pomp. Otherwise, The Rising Tide sits awash in new age imagery-- the ocean, rain, angels, the ocean again. How It Feels to Be Something On mesmerized intimacy, introspection, and Eastern textures. Here, that's all been discarded for Big Themes and Big Guitars-- alright for a Saturn drive through suburbia, but not the silk blanket you want to snuggle under. After their temporary break-up, Sunny Day Real Estate regrouped with fresh spirit. The resulting album sounded like a band rediscovering itself over a batch of superb Enigk solo tracks. Yet Enigk has gone from exhaling, ""If I break down all that I am,"" to preaching: ""Snibe is a monster. He is willing to hurt others to retire rich and ugly. He kills the innocent to protect his control. Snibe is the greed of money and power. Snibe is in all of us."" Somebody's been subscribing to The Nation. The best justification for the extended metaphor of ""television"" as ""women"" is, ""She's in my head/ Like television,"" and, ""She's cool and she's free/ Like television."" Well, at least she's not cable, then. The songwriting here feels wrung from ""jams"". Splashes and driving rhythms replace intricacy and mood. Drummer William Goldsmith devotes the album to his hi-hat. ""Pish pish pish pish pish,"" go the little cymbals, as our British readers giggle. As Enigk wobbles his fingers over newly acquired bass strings and belts lines like, ""Disappear into the sun!"", it's hard to avoid Rush comparisons. The power-trio-with-socially-conscious-singer/bassist equation also recalls The Police. But time transplants Mercury Rising-era Sting into Zenyatta Mondatta. Meanwhile, ""Faces in Disguise"" mimics the soft, slow ooze of Peter Gabriel's rainstick ballads. So, essentially, this is the pop record 70s prog bands would make in the 80s-- Big Generator and Power Windows for a new generation. Aside from two major blunders, nothing is overtly offensive, but simply lachrymose and lactose. Sunny Day habitat needs candlelight and rugs, not spotlight riggings and Astroturf. Is this a certain progression for rock bands of this ilk? Chalk some of the scars up to Enigk's vocals being thrown into focus. But what makes maturing singers spit political slogans and earth-friendly spiritualism? Cash and hi-hats are easy culprits. For the benefit of audiences, songwriters in emotional bands are best left in states of emotional turmoil. Sadly, Enigk seems to be pretty comfortable with himself. That's no fun.","Are you ready to admit the Peter Gabriel factor? Or, even more frightening, the Yes and Rush\n\ factor? Not ...

Fevers and Mirrors,Bright Eyes,by: Taylor M. Clark,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a39eea9e61561daa4d09/1:1/w_160/13938636.jpg,2000-05-30 06:01:40,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/941-fevers-and-mirrors/,Saddle Creek,"Scarcely free of his teenage years, Bright Eyes' Conor Oberst has attempted to create a mature, cohesive concept album of sorts. He has shot for the moon, but skids to a halt on the ground, hindered by young wings. Granted, I'm 20. He's 20. Far be it from me to criticize the efforts of those my age based solely on our greenness, but as my grandmother would say, Oberst's eyes are a lot bigger than his stomach. Fevers and Mirrors is home to the sophomoric musical meanderings of a young songwriter who seems to take himself far too seriously. This doesn't mean that the music is that bad, only that it's marred by its own overzealous nature. Quite the contrary, there are a few gems hidden in the niches of this album. ""The Calendar Hung Itself..."" is an intense piece which grinds along to an addictive Latin guitar strumming pattern. On ""Haligh, Haligh, A Lie, Haligh,"" Oberst makes an old chord progression seem new with a strong acoustic hook and nicely executed instrumentation from a vibraphone and slide guitar. However, the album as a whole fails in several departments. What in particular are these fatal flaws that plague Bright Eyes? Let's begin with Oberst's voice. Initially, he seems wracked with intense emotion. But listen closer. His voice has one setting: unsteady quaver. He sounds hypothermic. Nowhere is this more apparent than on ""When the Curious Girl Realizes She is Under Glass,"" where the effect is so extreme that it becomes absolutely ridiculous, not to mention unnerving. So much of what passes for emotional and intellectual depth on this album is blatantly contrived nonsense. This would never have been so terribly obvious had he not placed a gut-wrenchingly ludicrous staged radio interview with himself at the end of ""An Attempt to Tip the Scales."" I simply cannot stress enough what a maddeningly self-indulgent mass of pseudo-depth this section of the album falls into. In this sickening chunk of narcissism, Oberst makes a laughable attempt to prove to his listeners that he is of a penetratingly deep intelligence by spouting strings of stale aphorisms that pass for rich understanding amongst those reluctant to have original thought. Not only this, but the mock interviewer actually interrupts Oberst to tell him how brilliant the album is. On the actual record he says this. I hate to sound haughty, but I have honestly never witnessed such tasteless, ostentatious self-promotion on an album by anyone. It must be heard to be believed. On a strictly musical level, Bright Eyes has his definitive moments but struggles with originality for the majority of the record. ""Something Vague"" showcases one of the most abused chord progressions in existence with little variation on what's already been done. ""The Movement of a Hand"" sounds suspiciously like an Eels song. And in a sign of lackluster songwriting, far too many of the songs on Fevers and Mirrors fall victim to the predictability problem of vocals following the bassline at all times. ""A Scale, A Mirror, and Those Indifferent Clocks,"" ""Arienette,"" and ""The Center of the World"" are all paradigm cases of this trait despite being pleasant enough songs. In most places, Fevers and Mirrors makes for an interesting listen considering its flaws. The instrumentation is diverse and tastefully orchestrated by the large cast, and it's clear that a great deal of thought and talent has been contributed to its making. Unfortunately, the album is also contrived and makes too blatant an effort to convince the listener of Oberst's tragic wisdom. It's a record that can be enjoyable in select places and definitely shows signs of potential, yet falls victim to mediocrity when held against the work of truly developed musicians. Oberst is in the early stages of developing a talent that will likely take some years to fully mature. When it does, I look forward eagerly to the result. For the time being, he's a far cry from excellent.","Scarcely free of his teenage years, Bright Eyes' Conor Oberst has attempted to create a mature, cohesive concept album of ...

...And the Coat and Hat,Wolfie,by: Brent DiCrescenzo,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929aa6dc0084474cd0c11c4/1:1/w_160/2c6751a4.gif,2000-05-25 06:01:40,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8734-and-the-coat-and-hat/,KindercoreKindercore,"Has it been a year already? The young ones sure do grow up fast these days. Just last spring I helped a band grow from toddlerhood to adolescence. To put it mildly, Where's Wolfie, Wolfie's sophomore LP, didn't really satisfy me. Yet, those who heard their debut couldn't really call it a ""slump."" Naturally, Mike Downey (as in ""softener"") e-mailed me voicing his objections. See, he plays guitar/bass and sings in Wolfie. Turns out he disagreed with my opinion! Mike went on to make other brilliant observations like, ""All music is good,"" ""If you don't like an album, don't review it,"" and ""I'm not a music critic, nor will I ever be, since it's the most pretentious profession."" Just above rockstar, then? Then a strange thing happened. Wolfie realized I was right! On their website, and now in the press kit for their new EP, Wolfie and the Coat and Hat, the band proclaims, ""We made an album that none of us were happy with from day one of its release."" Funny, Mike really seemed to be behind it at the time. ""We had made an album none of us could listen to,"" Wolfie confess. Certainly speaks a lot for the fans they sold it to. My primary criticism with Where's Wolfie laid in the heavy reliance on three chords, moog stabs and ""la-la-las."" Soon afterward, Wolfie coincidentally ""realized we could do better than a few power chords, a cheesy synth keyboard, and some 'la la las.'\x94 Well then, the big question is: can they? The answer: a resounding ""Eh..."" (4.9). ""They Call Me Leaves"" opens the EP with fuzzed-out bass that dominates the mix. Amanda, Joe and Mike pass off harmonies like relay batons. The song skips along with urgency, barely allowing enough time for synchronized fist-pumping, rushing over hilly choruses before splashing down with a-- gasp-- Big Rock Solo into a dainty acoustic coda. The song sticks agreeably like chocolate ticks. Still, shouldn't bands set the high jump bar a little higher than the Rentals' Seven More Minutes? The big light bulb that appeared over Wolfie's collective head flickered Morse code inspiration to the awed rockers. It thus spoke in glows (being collegiate Mathletes, Wolfie easily comprehend Morse code): ""Wolfie, put two little songs together to make one bigger song and this will be complex songwriting."" Thus, by the second track, ""It's Hard Luck Being Me,"" tempered chugging breaks into a perky four-note blues progression. (Please keep in mind that this is a guitar classification and not any indication of real ""blues."") ""The All Good People\x94 similarly shifts gears midway. Far from being prog, this short attention span style at least keeps listeners on their toes. Unfortunately, it also gets in the way of any real songwriting development. Still, this is pop at its gummiest. One shouldn't expect the craft of Canada's Greatest, Leonard Cohen. So, yes, some progressions are made from the last album. Guitars punch more than scratch (and tickle). Harmonies assist choruses instead of randomly ba-ba-ing for ba-ba-ing's sake. But Wolfie and the Coat and Hat takes baby steps for a band that disowned their last album. Grindcore or kraut-rock would be a real conversion. Perhaps I didn't make myself clear enough last time. Not only is there more to pop than three chords, moog stabs and ""la-la-las,"" but additionally, there's more to pop than thin organ ooze, a few open chords, and some ""Ahh-ah-ah-aaaa-ahs"" and/or ""Whoo-oo-ooos."" Okay, sometimes there's not, but that sometimes was back in 1962. Lyrically, Wolfie could use another Morse code-speaking giant light bulb. But until one comes along, let me make some final recommendations. I just want to help. I know you're listening. 1)\tLet Amanda sing more. Or at least have Joe and Mike see someone about that sinus problem. Claritin, perhaps? 2)\tThe instruments seem punched into a computer. Depth and warmth should slake the production. The translucent organ wavers like a whistle. Picture pipe organs bursting from church balconies. Open rooms and multiple tracks exist to be filled. Don't worry about replicating this live. Build, build, build. Tone, tone, tone. 3)\tStop singing about birds and flowers and trees and leaves and groves and hats and coats and... Love,

Last Century Modern,Towa Tei,by: Rich Juzwiak,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a74a9d034d5c69bf3761/1:1/w_160/af06c221.gif,2000-05-23 05:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7959-last-century-modern/,ElektraElektra,"I enjoy few moments in life as much as the second I bite into a not-yet-disintegrated Blow-Pop. Impatient as I am, I feel that sucking the lollipop down to its bubblegum center takes far too long. Besides, the hard candy coating intermingling with the super-slippery gum is a taste sensation unlike any other. If any album captures such an experience, it's undoubtedly Towa Tei's third release, Last Century Modern. With its ultra-sweet pop sensibilities, it's not too far from bubblegum, yet there are plenty crunchy electronics to chew on. While it may not be Towa Tei's most cohesive solo album, it's by far his most consistent. It's easy to compare the Japanese ex-Deee-Lite DJ's work to Pizzicato Five; both create accessible music that values electronic-based high kitsch above all else. However, when their respective new releases are held up to each other, Last Century Modern emerges with a sophistication Pizzicato Five have only achieved through their fashion sense. Though the record gets off to a rocky start (the waltzing, accordion-based title track), the album slickly takes off and rarely loses momentum. ""A Ring"" is a loungy romp that recalls Dimitri from Paris at his very best; both ""Angel"" and ""Butterfly"" find Tei spinning tongue-in-cheek breakbeats around more lounge fare and Ayumi Tanabe's luscious vocals; and though the instrumental ""Stretch Building Bamboo"" comes off a bit too obtuse and clunky, Tei more than makes up for it with the production on his remake of the Tom Browne funk classic, ""Funkin' for Jamaica."" Tei deftly incorporates a bassline infinitely thicker and juicier than the original. And though Wizdom Life's sloppy, brainless ""rhymes"" threaten to take the song down with them, the seamless chorus harmonies from Les Nubians keep the song afloat. As great as Tei's stuff is, the real highlight of the record comes with Mighty Bop's remix of ""Let Me Know."" Whereas the original, which appears earlier in the album, is sluggish and skittery, Mighty Bop's reworking pumps the song up to a bossanova-flavored, mid-tempo dancefloor ballad. The addition of Brazilian guitar, along with more oohs and aahs, help the song achieve greatness. This track is the reason disco balls slow down, shining blue lights on the newly lovestruck. The vocals on ""Know"" are handled by fellow Japanese popster Chara, who sounds about four years old. Her overblown cuteness is the only potential low point of the album, seeming calculated to drive the Murder City Devils t-shirt-wearing cynics crazy. I, however, find the sugariness ultimately satisfying and will continue to listen to Last Century Modern until all of my teeth rot out of my head. I hope it's not for a while.","I enjoy few moments in life as much as the second I bite into a not-yet-disintegrated Blow-Pop. Impatient as I ...

Surrendered,David S.

David Fricke's lengthy, idealistic prose that accompanies this album pokes through to my sentimental side just enough to make me want to really embrace Surrendered. The vaguely professed goal to make so-called ""free"" jazz that can pull listeners in on its own merits with no inherent pretension or difficult complexity to intellectualize is enough to make quite a few music lovers feel downright romantic. And what better place than here? The David S. Ware Quartet is a supergroup of the form, and has the chops to back the clout. Matthew Shipp and William Parker are respected bandleaders in their own right and would nary see fit to upstage Ware on his own turf. Guillermo E. Brown's cymbal- heavy atmospherics may not size up to his predecessor Susie Ibarra's work on previous Ware Quartet outings, but is capable enough to keep things moving. But in the end, it's the lineup of the Quartet that accounts for its flaws. Ware himself plays so sporadically here that Shipp has no choice but to pick up the slack and virtually hold each song down. Brown is of little help with his busy flourishes and cymbal rolls, often seemingly unaware that any rhythm needs keeping. And Parker's subsonic bass reaches new lows of complete inaudibility, preventing him from effectively making up for the lack of a solid rhythm section. ""Peace Celestial"" begins with a grandiose overture-type opening, and maintains its dull air even when the piece hits its climax. Ware and Shipp plug away at the same simple melody for so long that the subtleties of their improvisation are sunken into a long snore. The short, casual rendition of Charles Lloyd's ""Sweet Georgia Bright"" that follows is a welcome respite from the overblown introduction. But then, frustratingly, ""Theme of Ages"" returns the listener to another long haul of flailing around the same six notes for seven minutes. Toward the record's end, Shipp bangs on some low keys for a brief moment of interest, but it's a case of too little too late. Fittingly, Surrendered's title track is the most effective of the original compositions here. It follows the same ponderous formula as the others, but is incrementally more dynamic, with Parker actually rising up to be heard for a fleeting end passage. Surrendered ends with a 16-minute rendition of Beaver Harris' ""African Drums."" Once again, Shipp's piano is the only constant, with Ware and Brown stretching into as many variations as possible, and Parker barely a presence. But they keep it up long enough that Shipp actually gets a solo, and a rather good one, at that. Eventually, all but the drums drop out, leaving Brown to unravel an interesting but barely comprehensible solo. Fortunately, this clears the air for the tune to build back up with Parker, Shipp and Ware coming in individually and re-introducing the theme, and riding it out to a satisfactory finish. It's good that names like these are indulging in such efforts to forward jazz. But upon further inspection, one is left with the impatient desire for these guys to get down to business and quit theorizing.","There's little more confounding than an album that doesn't even live up to its liner notes.

Wasp Star: Apple Venus Vol. 2,XTC,by: Zach Hooker,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929aad4c0084474cd0c1275/1:1/w_160/097f9a57.gif,2000-05-23 05:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8830-wasp-star-apple-venus-vol-2/,TVT,"A certain age-old question has once again raised its nappy-ass head, troubling the small segment of society that spends way too many hours writing about pop music. The question: what makes one person love a song that another person hates? How can my co-workers prefer Lit to Mingus? Is there an actual reason, defensible on a theoretical level, for how I can love Shudder to Think and hate Queen? The idea of certain music having ""meaning"" has been put forth as an explanation, and likely, this is the explanation to which most of us gravitate. We generally prefer the idea of personal significance to the concept of a continuum scale of consensual meaning. But the discussion of meaning in pop music is probably best tabled, and quick. The question, ""What does this song mean to me?"" is a semiotician's nightmare (or freaky sex dream-- what's the difference?), and few rock critics are up to that particular ontological and epistemological tangle. Certainly, I'm not. Forty years after a couple of French eggheads administered a fairly sound lashing to the idea that language is capable of any real attempt at communication, we're probably better off not suggesting that the Magnetic Fields are better than N'Sync based on some tenuous idea of signification. Frankly, it's practically an unanswerable question. The sooner we abandon our personal quests to convince so-and-so that, say, Fleetwood Mac sucks, the better. Still, for what it's worth, I'm attracted to a linguistic approach. I like the idea that language acts on the brain and imposes an order on the actual physical organ. I like the idea that a sentence, or a guitar solo, is constructed based on certain neurological realities. I like the idea of my brain having a ""taste center"" in addition to a ""language center"" and a ""motor center."" Because with that formulation, the issue of self-worth immediately drops out and I get to stop feeling shitty for liking music that others hate. Which brings me, in a way, to Wasp Star. This album went straight to my taste center, inhibiting serotonin reuptake and giving me a sense of pleasure and well-being. Moreover, it got me thinking about pop music and the brains that both make it and consume it. Andy Partridge has got some brain. Whatever deep structure informs his pop syntax, the songs that result have just gotten better over time-- and there are a grip of good songs on Wasp Star. The lead-off, ""Playground,"" is a fantastic pop song whose introductory riff recalls the opening of The Black Sea's ""Respectable Street."" Over crisp guitars and big drums, Partridge relates his recent money and romantic troubles to schoolyard drama. ""Playground,"" ""We're All Light,"" ""I'm the Man Who Murdered Love,"" and ""My Brown Guitar"" are all offspring of the sound XTC honed to a monomolecular edge during the '80s-- great hooks, full sound, baroque production values. On the merit of those four songs alone, Wasp Star lives up to its potential as an electrified companion to last year's Apple Venus. Partridge's peculiar lyrical sensibility is in full force here as well. Sometimes syrupy, often even willfully ditzy, but never hackneyed, Wasp Star's lyrics closely recall Oranges and Lemons in their playfulness and sheer word-per-song density. Even Partridge's occasional patches of bitterness come off as exultant due to their shiny pop settings. The single exception comes with ""Wounded Horse,"" as straight-up a twelve bar blues number as XTC are capable of producing. Colin Moulding's three songs are a bit more subdued and folksy, and perhaps more suited to Apple Venus's sensibility, but they hold up well to the guitar- oriented nature of this album. What XTC are never really given enough credit for is Partridge's guitarwork. He's an endlessly inventive guitarist, whether backing a verse with bursts of bizarre, inverted chords or playing an all-out jazz-inflected solo. In fact, his strange phrasing and over-the-bar articulation is what got me thinking about linguistics in the first place. Something in his brain makes his guitar sound a certain way, and something in my brain makes that way sound pretty damn good. It's true that Wasp Star is less thematically linked than Apple Venus, and some have criticized this seeming lack of cohesiveness. But honestly, ""cohesive"" is a word that crops up in too many record reviews, and if Wasp Star has less of it than other late XTC albums, it doesn't detract from the quality of the album. It's a great bunch of songs, and it solidifies the notion that XTC are back from the wilderness and ready to rock the show. My brain is glad for it.","A certain age-old question has once again raised its nappy-ass head, troubling the small segment of society that spends way ...

When I'd come across a reference to the band, they'd generally be described as some retro new wave thing. Then I'd notice later that they were on Mego, a label known for releasing the most abstract and challenging laptop music going, and that they had some kind of political/theoretical underpinnings. ""I must have that new wave angle wrong,"" I thought to myself. ""They must be some kind of ambient terrorist provocateurs like Ultra Red or Terre Thaemlitz."" But I heard correctly. Chicks on Speed are obsessed with the sounds of the 80's, they do have a political agenda, and they are on Mego. They're three women from Munich (one of whom is American) and Chicks on Speed is merely the latest in a long line of art projects. This work seeks to challenge some assumptions about women or music or women in music. Or something like that. I honestly didn't spend a lot of time trying to decipher the political slant. It's feminist in some way-- I gathered that much-- but the point of view is not terribly clear. Fortunately, it doesn't matter much when it comes to getting down to digging these tunes, a nice mix of recontextualized covers and originals. ""Glamour Girl,"" a fantastically groovy house number inspired in some respect by C+C Music Factory, seems to be making some sort of comment about the empty gestures involved with a woman getting dolled up for a night on the town. ""She's a glamour girl, she stands so still/ Wears a feather bra, her hair is so high/ It starts to sway when she brushes her teeth/ Five times a day."" Since when is good oral hygiene supposed to be a statement about power relationships? The glamour girl may need a haircut, but she'll likely have the last laugh and the toothiest smile. Sitting here in my filthy undershirt with a head full of cavities, it's hard to empathize. So you'll forgive me if I fail to judge this album on its political merits. I'm just so much more interested in how the sparse electro machinations on this version of Normal's ""Warm Leatherette"" feel wired into my spine, forcing me to sway uncontrollably whenever the song plays. It's like the aural equivalent of a portrait of Gary Numan laser-carved out of a sheet of tin. The Megoisms bubble up to the surface on the Chicks' cover of the B-52's ""Give Me Back My Man."" The vocals are heavily processed and treated like another rhythmic component, and the lockstep beat snatches the Neu! pulse back from the new wavers and reclaims it for Deutschland once and for all. Also impressive on the DSP front is ""Little Star,"" which features a slowly building morass of digital noise that finally grows into a bittersweet pop tune as the spoken vocals morph into melody. Perhaps the most interesting track here is the last, a cover of Cracker's ""Euro Trash Girl."" It's striking partly because it comes from three women who could easily have been the objects of David Lowery's affection, but the music is what makes it. Brilliantly, they strip the song down to repetitious, minimal techno, and sound positively bored speaking the vocals. Maybe for their next record, they'll do some incisive gender commentary with a glitch version of ""Mr. Wrong.""

Wishville,Catherine Wheel,by: Beatty & Garrett,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a5509d034d5c69bf3296/1:1/w_160/6bf6c661.gif,2000-05-23 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1348-wishville/,ColumbiaColumbia,"R.I.P. Here lies Catherine Wheel, an exceptional band for nearly 10 years, owner of several masterful albums, ranging from the propulsive shoegazing of Ferment and Chrome to the psychedelic brit-rock of Adam and Eve. The band managed not only to adapt their sound as popular tastes changed, but performed the even rarer feat of leaving an indelible mark on each style as they went. With each subsequent album, Catherine Wheel expanded their sonic palate and grew more willing to experiment with their signature sound. (Even if the cost of that increased musical experimentation meant lyrical regression.) When word came that Catherine Wheel was releasing their fifth proper LP, Wishville, we figured it'd be a slam dunk. After all, this was a band that had survived the inevitable shoegazer backlash by reinventing themselves as a powerhouse neo-grunge outfit. Perhaps more to their credit, they made the transition so credible and seamless that it seemed downright preposterous to suggest that they had ever been anything else. Given that audacious transformation, there remained little doubt in our minds that Catherine Wheel could emerge from a label change and a split with their longtime bassist unscathed. We were grievously mistaken. The record's opening track, which rather fittingly also serves as the lead single, captures all of the album's flaws in its four interminable minutes. ""Sparks are Gonna Fly"" relies on one monotonous riff repeated ad nauseam for the duration of the song. No amount of layering or studio wizardry can hide how paper-thin the song is. The same basic problem plagues all of these nine songs: the production and layering effects are used in an attempt to mask the shortcomings rather than to enhance the melodies. Many of the additional instruments thrown into the mix feel forced, whether it's the harmonica on ""Ballad of a Running Man"" or the violin on ""Gasoline."" This is in sharp contrast to the function of the extra instruments on Adam and Eve, which seemed both effortless and integral to the overall song structures. If anything positive can be said about the band at this stage, it's that they haven't rested on their laurels. Catherine Wheel have indeed morphed their sound once again. Yet unlike their previous efforts, the new sound sees them pushing into some pretty unsavory territory. ""What We Want to Believe In"" sounds like, as its title suggests, the work of a drunken Christian rock band (if one actually existed). Even more embarrassing is ""Mad Dog,"" a song that wouldn't sound out of place on a compilation of Collective Soul b-sides. But even when Catherine Wheel manage to stumble into a mildly engaging melody, they successfully sully any possible pleasure with laughable couplets like: ""Fuel of fathers' sweat/ Sweet like baby's breath,"" or, ""Strong like Superman/ Stinking up the streets I am."" Other inadvertently hilarious lyrics come at the start of ""Idle Life,"" where Rob Dickinson comatosely mutters, ""Give me soap to shave around/ With my guts exposed and slippy,"" without the aid of any instrumentation. Yeah, trust us, it sounds even worse than it reads. In case some of you haven't quite gotten the message, or it hasn't been made perfectly clear yet: this album is absolutely terrible, a total abomination. It's a loss in every sense of the word. Ah, well, guys, it's been a great run of it. Most bands never make it to nine years, let alone enjoy a consistently superb output. But now, in the interest of good taste, it's time to pack it in and call it quits. Services will be held at daybreak.","R.I.P.

"Essential Selection, Vol. 1",Fatboy Slim,by: James P. Wisdom,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd6113d197565213b51d/1:1/w_160/51b2d94c.gif,2000-05-16 05:00:05,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3009-essential-selection-vol-1/,AstralwerksFFRRLondon,"Once upon a time in a lonely forest, there was a little boy looking for his grandmother's house party. He was a special little boy, for he was known far and wide as being the boy with the beats. He spun wax at Grandmother's first four house parties, and all the other boys, girls and woodland creatures had sucked their pacifiers and bounced around, so he became known as Little Boy Beat. On this particular day, Little Boy Beat had to get to Grandmother's House Party 5 because he was the live attraction, and he'd heard that Grandmother was sick. So, with a basket of vinyl under his arm, he went into the dark and lonely woods. Just then, a wolf-- neither fat nor slim, and known among those parts as being a bit of a badass-- happened along: ""Where are you going, Little Boy Beat?"" he asked. ""I am going to Grandmother's House Party, Mr. Wolf,"" answered the little boy. ""Where does she live?"" asked the Wolf. ""Oh, at the third cottage past yonder mill. Grandmother is very ill, so I am taking her these sweet beats which my producer has made for her."" ""If she is so ill, I will go and see her too,"" said the Wolf. ""I will go this way, and you go through the woods, and we will see who gets there first."" So saying, he shambled off, and ran all the way to the cottage. Tap, tap-- he knocked at the cottage door. ""Who is there?"" asked Grandmother, who, by all accounts, was once called Pete Tong. ""It is I,"" answered the Wolf in a soft voice, ""Little Boy Beat! I have brought you nice, fresh cakes and butter."" ""Pull the bobbin and the latch will lift up,"" called out Grandmother. The Wolf pulled the bobbin, lifted the latch, and entered the cottage. Then, he ate up poor Grandmother, put on her nightgown, and pulled her nightcap right over his ugly wolfhead, and crashed on the couch. ""The old bitch was a bit tough,"" he mumbled to himself, ""but the little boy will be a delicate morsel."" Meanwhile, Little Boy Beat lingered on in the woods. It was so bright there; the birds sang merrily in the trees, and the brook chattered as it ran down to help the mill do its work. Everything was full of life. He chased the dainty butterflies, and then gathered a posy for Grandmother who could not get out and see the Spring flowers grow. At last, tired with his play, he set off to reach Grandmother's house party. He knocked at the door, and the Wolf, softening his voice, called out: ""Pull the bobbin, and the latch will go up."" Little Boy Beat opened the door and walked in. ""Put the basket on the table, and come into bed with me,"" said the Wolf, ""for I feel cold."" Little Boy Beat thought that his grandmother's voice was very hoarse, but then he remembered that this might be on account of her cold. Being an obedient boy, he got into bed, but when he saw the hairy arms, he began to grow frightened. ""What long arms you have, Grandmother!"" ""The better to hug you with, my dear."" Then he saw the long ears sticking up out of the nightcap. ""What great ears you have, Grandmother!"" ""The better to hear you with, my dear."" ""What great teeth you have, Grandmother!"" ""The better to eat you with, my dear!"" shouted the Wolf. With one bound, he sprang out of bed, and would have gobbled Little Boy Beat right up had the boy been a second slower. Little Boy Beat whipped out his wax, leaped behind the tables, and shouted, ""I am Paul Oakenfold the Mighty! Ye shall obey me!"" Then he laid down some smooth trance grooves, mixing like a king and making the little piggies in the backyard pen roll in the mud with delight. The Wolf was stunned, but hungry, so he lunged at the other tables-- the ones with the giant stacks of speakers. His tongue flapped out of his mouth and his eyes rolled lasciviously as he slapped some old faves on the deck and started spinning. It was battle. He drooled: ""Fatboy Slim is fuckin' in heaven!"" And they went at it. It lasted for what seemed like hours, but in actuality only lasted 154 minutes. By the end, all the children and woodland creatures had come to watch the battle. The Wolf started with a subtlety that no one expected, but soon he was driving Little Boy Beat into submission with heavy, hard house sounds that bore his personal mark. The raccoon kept a list as the Wolf brought it from all sides-- new, old, stuff you've heard in various conflagrations, all warped into an intoxicating, mesmerizing beat factory. Racoon was shouting now: ""Major Force! Art of Noise! Chemical Brothers! Underworld! Armand Van Helden!"" The list went on, but was drown out by the encompassing peace that swallowed the Wolf's groove: Little Boy Beat's decks were, as the field mouse said, ""en fuego."" Little Boy Beat, for such a small boy, had the wisdom of years in front of house parties. He let his roots be the yin to the Wolf's yang. Where the Wolf bound the listener into dancing submission with cascading beats, Little Boy Beat went old-school cerebral on his ass. Shimmering, space-age synth loops came and went in gentle succession, sometimes matched with delicate melodies, sometimes framing dense beats. The Raccoon came running soon enough, a little out of breath when he gasped: ""Luzon! The Unknown! Brainchild! Jan Johnston! Solar Stone!"" And we marvelled at the breadth of Little Boy Beat's selection which mirrored-- yet was completely different from-- the Wolf's. When it was all over, someone realized that Grandmother wasn't dead at all, but chewing frantically on several pieces of Trident in the corner. Little Boy Beat had gained a new respect for the harnessed aggression of the Wolf, and the Wolf was no longer hungry, for little boy's beats had fed him. They gave each other a wet kiss with plenty of tongue and danced into the sunset. We all thought it was over until we saw that the DAT recorders for each had been recording the whole thing, separately! The weasel, who was very good with such things, made compact discs for everyone so they could listen to the legendary duel. Everyone agreed that both performances were exceptional, but no one could agree on whose was better. The Wolf was an illustration of trance-beat hypnosis in its smoothest guise, but Little Boy Beat had crafted an incredible testament to skills, experience, sharp ear, and synthesis. The debate raged on for many years, and no agreement was ever reached, but everyone that witnessed the Great Battle that day was glad to have been a part of it. And to this day, people walking through the forest can be seen wagging their hips to the reverb of that wondrous event.

Split EP,LilysAspera Ad Astra,by: Nick Mirov,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a1d613d1975652138711/1:1/w_160/c02bb2a4.gif,2000-05-16 05:00:04,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4796-split-ep/,Tiger StyleTiger Style,"It's all too easy for me to be horribly biased towards this record. See, I love the Lilys like I love warm summer days, butter pecan ice cream, and birthday blowjobs. For me, they can do no wrong. If Kurt Heasley and whoever's backing his ass up these days came over to my house and recorded the sound of them beating me to a pulp, I'd still buy it. Hell, everyone would buy it because nothing says ""entertainment"" like hearing me scream, ""Have I mentioned how much I love Eccsame the Photon Band? Oh god, no! Not the pliers! nnnnnggggeeeEYEEEYYYAGGGHH! [sound of shattering cartilage] But enough about my sadomasochistic fantasies. What we have here is a sampler of sorts, thrown together mostly to get the new Tiger Style label off to a running start: four previously unreleased Lilys tracks left over from the Eccsame sessions, four new songs from psychedelians Aspera Ad Astra, and some bizarrely ugly cover art depicting apes wrestling with giant earthworms. (Don't ask, I don't get it either.) Now, only hardcore Lilys fans could possibly get excited over a handful of seven-year-old demos, and sure, these four songs aren't anything special compared to their more polished work. The dreamlike, acid-drenched pulse of ""Elsa"" and ""Hymn"" merely recall better tracks from Eccsame, and the crunchy pop stomp of ""Coby"" is the missing link between the hazy garage-gazer of In the Presence of Nothing and the thick, vibrant power-pop of A Brief History of Amazing Letdowns. But those unfamiliar with the Lilys will at least get a pretty good idea of the band's pre-1995 vibe, before they transformed from shoegazery indie-poppers into British Invasion doppelgangers. Aspera Ad Astra's half of the disc is fairly decent, but naturally a bit of a letdown after the Lilys have worked their magic. The heavily sedated, Spiritualized-like shimmer of their full- length debut, Peace, is distilled into smaller psych-pop nuggets here, which is kind of disappointing; ""Good Beat Down"" and ""Tin Pan Miracles"" sport melodies so twee and precious you'd think Drew Mills' whiny quaver was coming from a jolly yet neurotic dwarf. Only when the big globs of effects-laden distortion come raining down are the songs salvaged, as on ""Feed the Fantasy."" And even then, Aspera Ad Astra's sing-songiness is a bit much to handle. In culinary terms, this album is like only getting to smell a glass of wine, and then chugging a glass of maple syrup. Mmm... Maple syrup.","It's all too easy for me to be horribly biased towards this record. See, I love the Lilys like ...

I am fine. My name is Billy. I am 8 and 5/8 years old (9 in 137 days). I like soccer and playing with my rocketships. Do you like pizza? I think pizza is the best food in the whole world, especially with lots of cheese. One time, my big sister Beth ate way too much pizza and she threw up right in front of a guy she had a crush on. She was so embarrassed that all she could do for a whole week was sit in her room and listen to Alanis Morrisette on repeat, saying, ""Isn't it ironic? Don't'cha think?"" She's a major dork and has cooties. I am writing because I think my brother Kevin is obsessed with you. My parents are really worried. Before Supermodified came out, he had this countdown calendar up in his room between a giant poster of the cover of Bricolage and a framed picture of you looking off in the distance. Every day, he would sit in his room and stare at that calendar and rip off a number exactly at midnight. I think it's creepy. He says you are ""the manifold deity of digital polyrhythms, descended upon this wretched corporeal shell of a world to illuminate the path to enlightenment through sonic perfection."" He's really smart because he goes to college. Nobody understands what he's saying. Who do you think would win in a fight between a Velociraptor and Spider Man? I think Spider Man would, because he would use his spider sense to avoid danger, then wrap it up in super powerful webs. I think Spider Man is the coolest ever. One day, my brother Kevin got into a bad fight with his friend Eric. They both wear big pants and like those glow sticks that you use on Halloween and stuff. Anyway, Eric and Kevin were going to get into Eric's car and Eric wanted to listen to Roni Size. Kevin wanted to listen to your second album, Permutation. They got really mad at each other. Finally, Eric told Kevin, ""Dude, Amon Tobin is too weird and esoteric. At least Roni Size won the Mercury Prize. That must mean he's better."" Kevin sprang at him really fast and started to claw at his face, screaming words like ""cretin"" and ""imbecile."" This other time, my sister asked him why he didn't listen to more mainstream electronic stuff like Fatboy Slim and Moby, because they were so much cooler. I've never seen him so angry. He went off for like half an hour. He had just gotten Supermodified, so this is what he told her: ""You poor plebeian, devouring mainstream culture like so many Chalupas and Doritos. If you would simply pause for a mere second and lend an ear to the remarkably intricate and razor sharp compositions offered on Supermodified, you would become revolted at only the thought of such derivative drivel. Amon Tobin creates aural treasures each time he touches studio equipment. He breathes vitality into a stagnant genre with each drum hit. He rejuvenates the pallid genre of electronica every time he permits the world to glance through the twisted digital window of his music. Take the opening track, 'Get Your Snack On.' In even the inaugural morsel of the album, Tobin breaks new ground for funk-infused rhythms. It is easily the most addictive song he's recorded to date, replete with thumping bass line and ludicrous drum breaks. Then we have 'Saboteur,' a subtle epic that hovers on the edge of genius, yet is able to shatter walls in its sheer restraint from exploding into rhythmic madness. 'Deo' again presents an intellectual Amon Tobin who allows his tracks to evolve, weaving a elaborate oriental rug of organic tones and beats. I am literally contorted with giddiness when hearing certain sections of Supermodified."" She tried to walk out of the room, but he chased her around the house with a boombox that was playing ""Four Ton Mantis"" until my sister threatened to tell his girlfriend that he once said that ""Believe"" by Cher was ""sort of interesting."" I sometimes get funny feelings when I listen to your music. On your other two records, it was different because I kind of felt alienated from the music. It was so weird and random and intense at times. Now, the music sort of draws me in and I can't stop listening. Kevin says it's because this disc is much more ""accessible than anything he's done before, yet it surpasses them insofar has he has shown the beginnings of a total sonic mastery of each subtle aspect of a work."" Everything just fits together so well, like Lego blocks making a castle. It used to be that the beats would be really scary because they didn't quite fit the background music, but now everything is just so proper and seems in its place. Please help me, Mr. Tobin. I don't want to grow up to be obsessed with you like Kevin. I want to be able to leave the house sometimes when I grow up. I want to be a fireman! But I just can't stop listening now. Be kind, Mr. Tobin, I'm only 8 and 3/4 years old!","Dear Amon,

The First of the Microbe Hunters,Stereolab,by: Brent DiCrescenzo,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a562c0084474cd0c06e2/1:1/w_160/8a1ab1d4.gif,2000-05-16 05:00:02,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7496-the-first-of-the-microbe-hunters/,Elektra,"The haste in the release of this ""mini-LP,"" as the band calls it, means one of two things. Either The First of the Microbe Hunters is an apologetic missive for the career nadir of Cobra and Phases Group Plays Voltage in the Milky Night or the fatal Jenga pull on Stereolab's credibility after ceaseless releases. Fortunately for ""the Groop"" and the world, the former is the case. More than anything, this release documents the crippling production of Jim O'Rourke. It's refreshing to hear Stereolab escape the productive thumb of Chicago's dry art figures. Seemingly, O'Rourke and John McEntire would have Stereolab wallow in a bog of sterile cocktail wank-like rotting cranberries. McEntire's lone studio contribution on Microbe Hunters, ""I Feel the Air (of Another Planet),"" grates and retreads past offenses-- ""ba"" is repeated ad nausea over frigid blips and echoing, muted piano. I think I remember them saying ""ba"" once before. Elsewhere, Stereolab engage in the funkiest, heaviest music of their career. While monotony still remains a passion, subtle psychedelic flourishes and thick percussion pumps add much needed verve. The wonderfully titled ""Outer Bongolia"" remembers that jazz also existed in the '70s, when artists like Herbie Hancock, Mongo Santamaria, and Les McCann rocked nasty. ""Intervals"" picks along on a quiet acoustic while a gooey electric is strums with LSD tabs. Soon the song shifts into an analog forest of chirping keyboards and snapping drums. Thankfully, songs shift and return. ""Retrograde Mirror Form"" similarly passes through three phases of organ-punched grooves. When monotony is called for, such as on ""Barock-Plastik,"" phat, ass-moving bass keeps the vital juices flowing. Don't write off Stereolab just yet. Possible, intriguing new directions are hinted at on Microbe Hunters. ""Nomus Et Phusis"" bounces on jungle timpani, sounding so refreshingly non-caucasian. Forget their past trails-- Microbe Hunters drifts away from the droning pop of their recent releases. In the context of electronic music and dance, Stereolab actually sound groundbreaking again. Of course, we still beg for any sort of lyrical development; and the strength of this release is obviously its sitcom-length brevity. The best Stereolab albums have always been their EPs. Still, the cover isn't brown and orange, and Microbe Hunters comes closest to capturing the live Stereolab experience. Stereolab need to record in Brazil or the Ivory Coast and stay away from Chicago. And unlike last time, that isn't a plea for them to leave me alone.","The haste in the release of this ""mini-LP,"" as the band calls it, means one of two things.\n\ Either ...

The New Song and Dance,Radio 4,by: Nick Mirov,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a1e3c0084474cd0bff05/1:1/w_160/98354ab2.gif,2000-05-16 05:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6649-the-new-song-and-dance/,Gern Blandsten,"At home, they're tourists: Radio 4 hail from New York but pledge allegiance to late-'70s British punk and post-punk, so much so that you half-expect bassist/singer Anthony Roman to break into a refrain of ""This is Radio 4 on pirate satellite"" at some point during The New Song and Dance. Tommy Williams' guitarwork splits the difference neatly between the clanging, reverb-heavy sound of the Clash, and the fractured, Tourette's-like outbursts of Gang of Four. One could even assume, without too much of a stretch, that they named themselves after the BBC radio station. But what to make of the album's title? Is it mere clumsy irony, or an upfront admission to the fact that everything old eventually becomes new again in today's recycle-happy culture? Perhaps it's both, but in the end, The New Song and Dance is mostly old and more of the same. Not to say that being heavily influenced by first-wave British post-punk is a bad thing-- indeed, the world would be arguably a much better place if more bands took their cues from the likes of Wire and the Fall-- but, as with any influences, bands either need to transcend them and establish a sound of their own, or be so damned catchy that it's easy to ignore the fact that they're ripping off some other band wholesale (hi, Elastica). Radio 4 bring only improved production techniques to their stuck-in-the-past formula; while all their songs dutifully hover between 2\xBD to 3\xBD minutes in length, their hooks are built for even shorter attention spans, repeating themselves just a little too often to not feel like they're being hammered into your skull with a big cartoon-like mallet. They become the type of things that you find yourself humming along to even as you're thinking, ""That's kind of annoying."" Eventually, the neverending parade of short, sharp riffs can become the aural equivalent of Chinese water torture. One gets the feeling that Radio 4 are a solid live band-- the kind that can incite a crowd into getting down in that embarrassing white-people-shuffle, Courtney-Cox-in-the-""Dancing in the Dark""-video sort of way. On record, though, Roman's and Williams' constant scratchy-throatted yelling seems strained, and the band's energy comes off a bit too pushy.

Working Undercover for the Man EP,They Might Be Giants,by: Spencer Owen,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a76913d19756521393ed/1:1/w_160/1d0627be.gif,2000-05-16 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7992-working-undercover-for-the-man-ep/,eMusiceMusic,"Right now, John Flansburgh and John Linnell are at their most prolific in years. They're recording incidental and theme music for hit TV shows like ""Malcolm in the Middle"" and ""The Daily Show."" Their current single is the extended theme song from the former, titled ""Boss of Me."" They have two full-length albums in the works. They're once again running their Dial-a-Song service from their answering machine at home (718-387-6962, still ""free when you call from work""). And they're setting up a service with EMusic in which, for a monthly fee, John Q. Tmbgfan gets all sorts of Internet music exclusives. But the kids, they want a new They Might Be Giants CD. Sure, the duo released a full-length in '99, but only on MP3! ""Enough with the MP3s,"" fans shout. They can't afford those newfangled portable MP3 players. They want to listen to their precious geek-rock anywhere they please. And so, the cries rung out in the ears of the two Johns, and they found a solution. Flansburgh and Linnell went into the studio for a week, and another week later, they had their new hard product: the Working Undercover for the Man EP. It's still on EMusic, and still released through MP3 distribution; however, the first few thousand customers also receive a copy on CD, artwork and all. A bit gimmicky, and quite frankly, cheap. But hey, it's effective, I guess. It's pretty obvious that Working Undercover for the Man was completed in a brief window of time. In fact, it almost feels like a nod to the old days, in which their songs were so perfectly concise that they could fit 20 on a 45-minute record while maintaining cohesion. There's even a drum-machine-and-synth track. But the sad fact is, they moved on long ago. Their last two full-lengths were recorded with a live group, and this EP is not exception: an array of Dans (think they did that on purpose?) handle second guitar, bass and drums. It's not truly a bad thing, since the Dans are talented, tight and versatile musicians. But many fans still long for the mid-'80s, when They Might Be Giants were backed only by pre-programmed MIDI instrumentation. Linnell's material seems substantially more fleshed out than Flansburgh's on this effort. We begin with ""Rest Awhile,"" a quick, Linnell-penned-and-sung power-pop tune with mellotron-ish keyboards and bouncy guitar providing the perfect ironic uptempo beat to Linnell's traditionally morbid lyrics. It's followed by a new version of the Dial-a-Song staple and title track, featuring a horn section, drum machine and synth, and a sing-songy chorus to accompany Flansburgh's wry tale of a government agent posing as a rock star. The lyrics are amusing, but the melody is generally forgettable, especially after following such an excellent lead-off rocker. ""I Am a Human Head"" serves as the record's longest track, a true epic at just under 3 minutes. It's easily the highlight of the EP, pairing the classic Linnell flair for melody with the band's nonsensical career-long fascination with the cranium. ""Empty Bottle Collector"" is, on the other hand, utterly disposable; culled from the ""Malcolm"" incidental music files, it's basically an improvisation on muted trumpet over a jazzy beat and some acoustic bass. Finally, ""On the Drag"" spotlights Flansburgh's love for hyper new-wave punk-pop, and features one of the most scorching keyboard solos since... um... something by Boston. Admittedly, it does seem a bit derivative, but it still manages to pull off a little of its own charm. They Might Be Giants would like you to think that Working Undercover for the Man doesn't really end there. Okay, sure. There are a few ""bonus tracks"" thrown in for bargain hunters. You get: three 15-second jingles promoting their online Radio TMBG service, and a throwaway heavy metal take on an otherwise benign cut off their forthcoming children's album. But the fact is, these tracks contribute to the filler and make the EP seem like more of an afterthought. Therefore, since this EP is incredibly short, I will use the fail-safe, Pitchfork-approved method of rating each track individually, and totaling the average (as originally implemented by Matt LeMay in his review of Console's Rocket in the Pocket): Rest Awhile: 8.0 Working Undercover for the Man: 6.5 I Am a Human Head: 8.6 Empty Bottle Collector: 4.3 On the Drag: 7.2 Radio TMBG jingles: 3.0 Robot Parade (Adult Version): 5.5 Hence, a 6.1. Seems appropriate. Working Undercover for the Man certainly has its moments, but in the end, it's just not meaty enough to pass as ""necessary."" I mean, it's only 15 minutes long, for Christ's sake. Advice: hurry up on those full-lengths, guys. It's been five years. Honestly.","Right now, John Flansburgh and John Linnell are at their most prolific in years.

For the first time in so long, music both challenging and infinitely pleasing has poured in from all angles-- music that either creates genres within genres, or totally redefines the familiar ones. And then there's music like Mojave 3's Excuses for Travelers, which not only accepts genre stereotypes, but somehow seems to define the stereotype better than the stereotype itself. If I were to tell you that Excuses for Travelers is a folk-country record, my job would be pretty much done. Every song on the record contains some combination of strummed acoustic guitar, slide guitar, Hammond organ, harmonica, soporific vocal melodies and harmonies, and lyrics about love and/or pick-up trucks. Mojave 3 frontman Neil Halstead does his best to sound ""folky""-- he now ranks up there with Tom Petty on the list of people who make me want to go back in time and strangle Bob Dylan. Sure, we'd lose one of the great musicians of the 20th century, but think of all the shitty imitators we wouldn't have to deal with. And let's not even discuss the whole Jakob thing. To even call Halstead a Dylan imitator, though, would be giving him more credit than he deserves. Whereas Dylan went through a period where his voice was whiny, nasal, and occasionally downright annoying, Halstead's vocals are just boring. Of course, that's the least of his concerns. Whereas Dylan truly broke new ground for rock lyricism, Halstead delivers lines like ""I love the sun/ And the highlights in your hair/ They turn me on"" with all the eroticism of a eunuch at the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show. Indeed, one of Excuses for Travelers' greatest weaknesses is that the album is too uniformly boring to be affecting in the least. Only two or three minutes into the record, you've already stopped giving a shit about what Halstead is saying. The words all seem to blur together into a beige-colored blob of monotony. By the middle of the album, odds are you're either reaching for caffeine pills to stay awake, or digging for another record to listen to. It must be stated, of course, that there are people who will find this album incredibly appealing. If you've ever taken an acoustic guitar to a deserted beach and sang Woody Guthrie songs at the ocean, you may be one of them. If you've ever told anyone to ""mellow out, man,"" you may be one of them. And if you think Jeff Tweedy is a ""serious badass,"" you're definitely one of them. To summarize: Excuses for Travelers is boring. It's about as dynamic and enthusiastic as an afternoon nap and half as refreshing. The guys and gals in Mojave 3 have made exactly zero attempts to take their sound further than 1998's fairly excellent Out of Tune, and as a result, there's little reason for this record to enter your collection. So I guess we have to face the facts: no matter how much rock music has evolved over the past 35 years or so, boring is still boring.","Call me a heartless bastard, but I'm finding that I just don't have time for records like this ...

The Virgin Suicides,Various Artists,by: Mark Richardson,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a07e9d034d5c69bf2725/1:1/w_160/be10da90.jpg,2000-05-12 06:00:00,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7885-the-virgin-suicides/,Emperor Norton,"Movie music is huge when a small indie film can inspire two separate discs of soundtrack music. Air did the score; now comes the Music from the Motion Picture, a somewhat dicier proposition. This soundtrack seeks to replicate the feel of mainstream mid-'70s radio, and to that end, it's a wild success. I was there and this is what it sounded like-- from the banal pop of 10cc to the raw (okay, medium-rare) power of Heart to the epic romanticism of Styx. Forget disco, CBGB's, punk, and new wave. That stuff didn't play in Peoria until much later. For a real taste of what a suburban kid playing ""Space Invaders"" was likely to hear pumping over the arcade sound system, this collection is the real thing. The problem is, no one ever said mainstream '70s radio was particularly good. It was like the mainstream radio of any other time, with a few true innovators, a glut of imitators, and a handful of the truly awful. All are represented here in their proper proportions. The innovators are pretty much limited to Al Green (who contributes the quintessential ""How Can You Mend a Broken Heart"") and Todd Rundgren (whose ""Hello It's Me"" and ""A Dream Goes on Forever"" influenced sophisticated pop revivalists like the Aluminum Group and the High Llamas). The imitators, naturally, are more numerous. For faux-Zep riffery, few could touch Heart, and they contribute two of their best anthems: ""Magic Man"" (heard frequently in 1978 in my hometown of East Lansing, Michigan, in tribute to local hero Earvin ""Magic"" Johnson) and ""Crazy on You."" Sloan's ""Everything You've Done Wrong"" is, of course, from the '90s, but it fits in just fine here, sounding like a bouncy slice of pre-disco Bee Gees, and Air's two tracks (""Ce Matin La,"" off Moon Safari, and a remix of ""Playground Love,"" from The Virgin Suicides score) also sport convincing period camouflage. After that, it gets a bit worse. The Hollies are way past their '60s peak on ""The Air That I Breathe,"" a corny ballad I always thought was by Air Supply, probably because it had ""air"" in its title. Similarly puny and insipid is 10cc's ""I'm Not in Love,"" guaranteed to induce headaches in anyone born before 1970. Gilbert O'Sullivan's ""Alone Again"" is an undistinguished McCartney rip-off, and things really bottom out on the album closer, ""Come Sail Away"" by Styx. It's all coming back to me now: except for disco, which only came at the end, '70s radio sucked. No wonder those virgins committed suicide.","Movie music is huge when a small indie film can inspire two separate discs of soundtrack music. Air did the ...

Tides,Arovane,by: Paul Cooper,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a1085e6ef959693200cd/1:1/w_160/9733cf24.gif,2000-05-11 06:01:40,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/296-tides/,City Centre Offices,"The homeless lady who sits outside the yuppie coffee bar on the corner of my street assures passers-by that the end is coming. I think she's desperate to convey her message. Though the United States is saber-rattling with the People's Republic of China, it seems that everyone has overcome their millennial tension, and the eve of destruction has turned to a morning of devil-may-care optimism. Collectively, we're overjoyed that, without much effort or awareness, we kicked the Beast's ass. The Beast, as prophesied by some locust-muncher out in the Negev Desert thousands of years ago, was supposed to arrive last year and annihilate us before being mightily smote by our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. I missed this. Living as I do in America's capital, the seat of iniquity and corruption, I should have had ring-side seats to the most righteous beatdown of all time. I even missed witnessing the Rapture, the faithful's assumption to the right hand of God that was suppose to occur just before Satan's saurian shredded all of creation. The homeless lady implores those who walk by to believe. ""You've not gotten away with your godless existence,"" she seems to be saying, as she sits surrounded by two shopping carts and two decades' worth of daily newspapers. She never gets ranty or violent, and by and large, is on the presentable side of destitution. This way, one doesn't feel sullied when approaching her personal space to drop a dollar into her plastic cup. She always tells you you're blessed by Our Redeemer and wishes you a beautiful day. Nonetheless, she tirelessly reminds everyone that the end is coming. She's right, of course. At some future point, by virtue of the inescapable effects of entropy, the universe will collapse in on itself and unimaginable havoc will ensue. But that's about a trillion years into the future, so I'm not going to let that distant apocalypse disturb me too much. However, the homeless lady's admonitions do remind me that, though I won't likely be around to fall victim to the utter destruction of time and space-- the reducing of everything to an infinitely small and massive energy blip-- some things around me now are evanescent, transitory, limited. These evanescent, transitory, limited things are the stuff of poetry. They're the familiar beauty of Dante's Beatrice, the redeeming orchestral tuttis in the third movement of Saint-Saens' Organ Symphony, the consummate swish of Ted Nugent's cat tail. To this incomplete list, we must now add several moments from Arovane's Tides. After his Pole-ish remix of Various Artists' ""No. 8"" and his Autechre-indebted debut, Atol Scrap, I was ready for Uwe Zahn (aka Arovane) to express himself rather than pay homage to his IDM heroes. And instead of drawing inspiration from the insides of his iMac or the boom-bip sounds of yesterday's tomorrow, Zahn dug the sea. Yup, a trip to the French coast fired Zahn up to combine ambient undulations of a vaguely Vini Reilly guitar with ebbing and flowing beats. After the harpsichordian trills of ""Theme,"" the title track focuses on the subject of Zahn's meticulous study. And study he has. These brief tracks need no remixing or extending for club action; they're far from being the background to bong hits. Their encapsulation of the hypnotic motion of water and the uniqueness of each wave marks Arovane out as unquestionably in the same small class of self-assured and talented musicians as Boards of Canada and Jake Mandell. ""Tomorrow Morning"" is a windchime melody surrounded by cicada strings and the almost imperceptible hum of moth wings. It gives way to the Bill Frisell-like impressionist guitar lines of ""Seaside."" ""The Storm"" begins as another harpsichord etude before torrential rain pours down in the form of pounding-as-John Bonham beats. Zahn returns to tranquility with ""Deauville,"" enhanced by oddly graceful squarks of seagulls gliding overhead. Zahn has resisted the temptation to describe in glitch minimalism the hydrodymanics of solar and lunar influences on our oceans. And surprisingly, Tides is not an amateur attempt at eco-journalism (Zahn's seashore isn't littered with garbage and melanoma-hungry humans)-- it's an artist's impression of an earthly paradise. The prominence Zahn gives to the harpsichord through this album exemplifies the deliberate, contemplative unrealism he wishes to communicate; he's taking a sound commonly associated with Baroque parlors and betwixt-minuet trysts, and attempting to reprogram our associations. And while I can't say that I've been wholly won over by this aspect of Tides, I have been-- and continue to be-- astounded by the rare reflective grace of the music. So let the end come. Satan's stormtrooper will destroy me, never less than charmed by the ceaseless undulation of Tides. I can conceive of far worse ways to go.","The homeless lady who sits outside the yuppie coffee bar on the corner of my street assures passers-by that the ...

100 Broken Windows,Idlewild,by: Beatty & Garrett,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c1adeb335119a49ed5da/1:1/w_160/da7157be.gif,2000-05-09 05:00:09,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4063-100-broken-windows/,FoodFood,"You know Jake. Every high school class had at least one, usually several. He was the kid who was always on time to class, always got straight A's, read Shakespeare for fun, and calculated the gravitational fields of black holes in his spare time. But no one really picked on him because he pretty much kept to himself. Occasionally, people snickered when he had to give a presentation in front of the class, donning his trademark oversized glasses and skintight polo shirt. But, for the most part, Jake was harmless, a bother to no one, just an amusing nerd at best. Then one day during senior spring, our mild-mannered Jake does something completely incomprehensible. He strolls into the lunchroom wearing a pair of Tevas, his backpack, and nothing else. We all knew Jake was a little weird, but up until now he'd just been a loner kind of weird. Anyway, he walks over to the sandwich cart, as if everything is perfectly normal. What is he doing? Is he really waiting in line for a sandwich with his member dangling in front of the deli meats? He sits down at a table alone with his sandwich in hand and begins eating. Perfectly normal, save for his bare ass on the wooden seat. Finally, the Dean of Students comes over and has a little conference with Jake and promptly escorts him from the dining hall. Jake gets put on probation for the remainder of the year but graduates along with everyone else, and even gets a few math awards to boot. But, to this day, no one knows why he did it. Was it for pure shock value? Was he living out a personal porn-star fantasy? Some things are better left alone. Listening to Idlewild's sophomore effort, 100 Broken Windows, for the first time is the shocking musical equivalent of watching Jake saunter into the lunchroom on that fateful afternoon. Like Jake's naked form in the context of a large dining area, the sound on this record came as a completely unexpected surprise. (Okay, a surprise minus the queasiness.) When we bought the album, we figured we had a sure-fire predictable band on our hands-- same faded cover art, same agitated song titles. But then, just when we were ready to give up on them, we pressed the play button and bang! Jake walks into the dining hall buck-naked. No more screeching. No more punk-guitar chaos. No more uncomfortable strain. The chord progressions are crisp and the hooks immediate. An added bonus, Roddy Woomble, the lead singer with a name so weird you had to remember it, sounds so much like the once-young and energetic Michael Stipe that we're sure a lawsuit has already been filed. In fact, we're going to go out on a limb here and say that this is the great album R.E.M. could have made after Green (if they hadn't veered off into ""Shiny Happy People"") with specks of Superchunk. But we only gave this album an 8.3, so there must be something wrong with it. And indeed there is. After about a dozen or so listens, one thing becomes fairly apparent: these songs have a tendency to blend together. But, hey, that's the same criticism that's been leveled at Superchunk for years now and it hasn't hurt them any. Nor should it. Like that renowned Carolina-grown indie band, Idlewild thrives within the three-to-four minute song structures. Simply put, they know to convert a searing hook into a rocking, accessible song. And if the result of this talent is that the song structures are fairly uniform, they still come out winners. The band's newfound maturity goes beyond the songwriting, though. Even the lyrics belie Idlewild's youthful exuberance. Favoring a more oblique lyrical approach this time out, Woomble is able to tap a much broader emotional palate. Where Hope is Important collapsed under the weight of its own self-importance and heavy-handedness, 100 Broken Windows succeeds with subtlety. We're not sure what he means when Woomble says, ""It's a better way to feel/ Don't be real, be post-modern"" on ""These Wooden Ideas,"" but regardless of its intent, when he utters the lines, they're strangely affecting. Part of the difference certainly lies in his soothing, empathic delivery, but the strength and genuineness of the words themselves can't be overlooked, either. So, assuming you enjoy quality punky power-pop, here's the plan: 1. (Optional) Wait for 100 Broken Windows to be imported. You can skip directly to Step 3 if you have no intention of doing so.
2. Roll over or have yourself turned over periodically to prevent bedsores.
3. Get off your ass.
4. Put your pants on.
5. Get in the car, or catch the bus, and go to the fucking Virgin Megastore. You don't have a Virgin Megastore? Get on the Internet. Don't have the Internet? Then how are you reading this?
6. Go to the Rock section. Flip past Hurricane #1. If you get to Iron Maiden, you went too far. Go back.
7. Grab 100 Broken Windows.
8. Paying is optional, although recommended for legal reasons.

"Animals, Suns and Atoms",Tarwater,by: Paul Cooper,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a73fea9e61561daa553f/1:1/w_160/111ac80c.gif,2000-05-09 05:00:08,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7949-animals-suns-and-atoms/,MuteMute,"Squirm (aka German electronica) is back, and while still not primed for attack, it's now capable of delivering a crucial payload. Arch-squirmers Tarwater-- an offshoot of the squirmily palindromic To Rococo Rot-- have finally raised the bar. Before Animals, Suns and Atoms, I judged squirm by the Notwist's crunchy outsider-electro LP, Shrink. Released on Stereolab's Duophonic label, Shrink elevated squirm from two-minute patch-corded interludes to album-length approximations of the unrealized soundclash between Can's Schloss Nörvenich acid excursions and our post-drum-n-bass ProTools culture. Frontman Ronald Lippok lazily states the facts and repercussions of insect disappearance as percussive blips and Farfisa-generated choir cloak his reminiscences, while encouraging us to ""Come on down/ Break it up."" With one foot firmly placed in the same puddle of pop irresistibility as Britney Spears' Swedish producer, and the other in that grand Kraut-rock tradition, this track, ""All the Ants Have Left Paris,"" sounds like the perfect combination of high-falutin' avant-garde expression and low-brow pop thrills. At least, until the following track, ""Noon,"" lollops in and fulfills our dreams of Kate Bush taking a shot at the genre with warm pianos and swaggering percussion clicks. As Lippok mutters, ""Abuse committed by criminals itself commits a crime,"" a female accomplice harmonizes in a Zanax fog. Underneath, a student learns to play the sitar until a ""European Son""-like attack of the John Cales overcomes his reverence for the instrument, and he throttles it. Of course, Tarwater, like the camera-wielding kid next door in ""American Beauty,"" are fascinated by this strangulation and give it prominence. ""The Trees"" is a far less energetic track than ""Ants,"" but Lippok nonetheless snaps at his Dada chorus (""Don't ever antagonize the home""). His strangely unnerving vocals are propelled by a nagging cello and percussive mouth harp as he reveals, ""I like to yell when it's snowing."" I'm sure his neighbors appreciate that. But the band saves their oddest and most surreptitious moments for last. On ""Seven Ways to Fake a Perfect Skin,"" Tarwater act out their fantasies of becoming one of Brian Eno's oblique strategies (or, at the very least, an out-take off Here Come the Warm Jets). Giddy analog synth loops and plucked harpsichord haunt the background. But Tarwater's frivolity is offset by Lippok's sinister whibble and fake London accent. On Animals, Suns and Atoms, Tarwater have finally realized that though analog mood sauce can be spread over phat hip-hop beats, it doesn't mean it necessarily should be. After all, they have to do better than the Notwist's ""Day 7"" and ""Chemicals"" at some point. Those two superb Notwist tracks defined the direction in which squirm should be headed. I want to hear outsider vocals accompanied by skewed, electronic cracks, blips, and a hearty gutbucket of hip-hop funk. I'm thrilled that Lippok and Jestram have picked up on the Notwist tactic. Tarwater have easily equaled Shrink in terms of effectiveness and creativity. They've captured the funk of Ege Bam Yasi-era Can, run it through with a provocative dub disquiet, and ended up with an album that marks new heights in electronic music. Here is an album I'll return to frequently. It's your squirm now!","Squirm (aka German electronica) is back, and while still not primed for attack, it's now capable\n\ of delivering ...

Hot Rail,Calexico,by: Chip Chanko,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a4d3b1335d7bf1698a61/1:1/w_160/7e89abba.gif,2000-05-09 05:00:07,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1229-hot-rail/,Touch and Go,"A year ago, a friend said that maybe I should go out with Calexico since I had liked Friends of Dean Martinez's Shadow of Your Smile stage so much. Lately, Friends of Dean Martinez had become distant and contemplative... she hadn't been her upbeat self. I was getting tired of having to listen to her somber dronings (especially having known her before she ""changed""). So my friend sent Calexico over. Boy, was she ugly! Look at that cover! But on my friend's recommendation, I decided to give it a go. We went out for coffee. The conversation was good. She had a southwestern accent and a beautiful voice. I gradually found myself enthralled by the music that came out of her mouth. It was fun. Surprisingly, I seemed to be attracted to Calexico based purely on her personality! While it hurt my eyes to look at her, I found that if I closed them and listened I was in love! It all seemed like some sort of fable where true love overcame all boundaries-- except that every time I opened my eyes I was repulsed by her ugliness! After our coffee, I didn't call her again. I felt kind of bad... but things had gotten busy at work and I eventually forgot about her. Time passed. In a time of desperation I tried to rekindle the old feelings for Friends of Dean Martinez and our Shadow of Your Smile days together, but it was no good. The more I remembered our past the more I couldn't take her now. And that Calexico. Calexico! I suddenly pined for her! What could have happened to change Friends of Dean Martinez so much? Maybe it was because she stopped hanging out with Joey Burns and John Convertino. They were around all the time back when I first knew her. Then, suddenly, they stopped hanging around and spent most of their time with Calexico! Friends of Dean Martinez was pretty... but I needed to have those good feelings we had shared in the past again. What ever had happened to Calexico? No sooner did I just say that than she bumped into me on the sidewalk. Man, she was still so ugly! But the sound of her saying my name brought me memories of a desert I'd never visited and cool nights over warm sand. This time I listened intently. She sounded better than ever. She talked much more now than in the past. She seemed upbeat! I clung to every word and story-- from the traditional border instrumental balladry of ""El Picador"" and ""Tres Avisos"" to the syncopated waltz ""Sonic Wind"" which swept me off my feet from verse to chorus. She was not as swept up in the lounge or experimental ambient scenes as Friends of Dean Martinez had ever been. Every interlude came with a purpose. She punctuated her speech with pauses (all necessary) of both slight reflection and deliberate energy. In the end, Calexico ended up moving to Oregon. Perhaps this was for the best. We stay in touch, calling one or the other every week or so. I still love to hear her voice... her mellow gracefulness. Once in a while, she even pulls out the pedal steel for me like she had with ""Service and Repair."" Sometimes when I can't fall asleep, her face pops into my mind and I wonder what really matters in love. Can one love blindly? Are looks that important? Can a beautiful soul transform a grotesque face simply by association? Then I take a leak and call Calexico on the phone, happy in the knowledge that I can listen to her without ever having to see her ugly mug again.","A year ago, a friend said that maybe I should go out with Calexico since I had liked Friends of ...

Mystery White Boy,Jeff Buckley,by: Al Shipley,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a3d45e6ef9596932071c/1:1/w_160/c5689f1d.gif,2000-05-09 05:00:06,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/992-mystery-white-boy/,Columbia,"At this point, a live album seems like a perfunctory addition to the Official Posthumous Legacy package, right between the unfinished album of demos and the inevitable b-sides compilation. But it's also something of a necessity for Jeff Buckley, who did a fairly exhaustive amount of touring in support of his one modestly successful record. When Columbia signed him, before booking weeks' worth of studio time or letting him put together a backing band, the first thing they did was issue the Live at Sin-E EP as a showcase of his raw talents. Like any live performance, Mystery White Boy exemplifies both the weaknesses and strengths of Buckley and his band. His voice is, naturally, the greatest asset to the package, but in concert, he was more prone to spiraling off into indulgent falsettos, and often struggled to match the band's intensity. Elegantly dynamic songs like the opener, ""Dream Brother,"" and ""Mojo Pin"" are given a slightly rougher touch for added climax. Sadly, the latter fails to improve on the fragile perfection of its studio counterpart, with otherwise immaculate drummer Matt Johnson rushing through the frantic triplets of the crescendo. ""Grace"" and ""Last Goodbye,"" on the other hand, are honored with impassioned, but far from unique, renditions that do them reasonable justice. On ""Last Goodbye,"" Buckley runs through his only hit with luxurious slide guitar that puts more emphasis on the soaring string arrangements. Elsewhere, variation proves fatal for ""Eternal Life,"" whose temporarily intriguing death metal version fails to enhance the already cringe-worthy bridge lyric. Several previously unreleased Buckley compositions are presented here, if purely to make the compilation more salable. These tracks often come off as a bit ragged and underwritten alongside the complex material of Grace. ""I Woke Up in a Strange Place"" is hard rocker that whimpers off, as if there was a killer ending planned that never got written. But ""What Will You Say"" succeeds by its simplicity with one of the most affecting melodies of Buckley's brief career. Jeff Buckley's always had a fluid repertoire of covers in addition to his respectable originals, and that's represented perhaps too well on Mystery White Boy. The last 20 minutes of the record are dedicated solely to covers. The off-the-cuff Gershwin classic, ""The Man That Got Away,"" is as enjoyable as anything else here, but certainly didn't need to put in an appearance. The majestic ""Kanga Roo"" is well worth the 10 minutes it requires to rise into a fury, and Buckley gets extra points for taking on a Big Star song other than ""Thirteen,"" for once. Appropriately enough, the set ends with Buckley's definitive reading of Leonard Cohen's ""Hallelujah,"" here labeled a medley for the impromptu inclusion of a few lines from Smiths' ""I Know It's Over."" Such collections are never complete without one glaring omission. In the case of Mystery White Boy, it's the surprising absence of ""Lover, You Should Have Come Over."" Both the penultimate Buckley ballad and a surefire litmus test for any potential fan, ""Lover"" begs a powerfully passionate performance, and finds it only in the disc's counterpart home video, Live in Chicago. This seems especially odd and undeserved given that several of the songs from Grace included here have already appeared in live form on previous singles and EPs. But flaws are to be expected of live albums, even when severe missteps are overlooked in editing and remastering. And despite a selection that leaves something to be desired, Mystery White Boy is a vital document of not only the late Buckley's talent, but of the chemistry and generosity he shared with his bandmates.","At this point, a live album seems like a perfunctory addition to the Official Posthumous Legacy package, right between the ...

Nipples,The Peter Brötzmann Sextet / Quartet,by: Zach Hooker,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a3b8b1335d7bf16987b6/1:1/w_160/84babdf7.gif,2000-05-09 05:00:05,Jazz,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/965-nipples/,AtavisticAtavistic,"Look, I know it's nothing to you, but I'm depressed. I'm depressed about music. Tito Puente died and left us alone with Marc Anthony. Fox recently called Britney Spears ""the voice of a generation."" Sting just won't go away. It's depressing. And what's even more depressing is reading about music: everyone's a critic, and every critic's a polemic. Weblogs trade barbs and apologies, and at some point the music itself is sloughed off, discursified, made circumstantial. Death of the author, death of the lead guitarist, whatever. It's depressing. So, in an atmosphere like this it comes as a pleasant surprise when your editor tries to kill you. Seriously. I spent the first four minutes of this disc muttering, ""What the hell is going on here? What is happening here?"" but by the six minute mark, I had changed my tune. ""Christ, Ryan's trying to kill me. I don't know why he sent me this thing, this creature, but it's going to kill me. He sent this thing to me in the mail. It's a letter-bomb-- it's a letter-thing, it's a letter-creature-- and it's, oh my god, what is that noise?"" Nipples is a 1969 recording, freshly re-released by Atavistic, of a famous session featuring some of the biggest names in European free jazz. The creature I thought was going to take my life, the title track, is nearly 20 minutes of amorphous noise recorded by a sextet consisting of piano, double-bass, drums, guitar and two saxes. The second track is slightly shorter and slimmed down: fifteen minutes of sax, piano, double-bass and drums. The entire album clocks in at just over 33 minutes, but they're some of the most frenetic and alien minutes you may ever live through. Initially, Nipples seems like the work of a sextet of toddlers who have been unleashed in a room full of musical instruments. It's grating and frustrating, and seems to exhibit a lack of structure surprising even for free jazz. After the third or fourth time through, though, a logic begins to present itself. Blocks of instruments drop in and out to highlight the tensions between the various sounds with a bowed double-bass and sax often serving as a foundation for the movements of other instruments. These six people listen to each other, coordinating their movements over a framework that remains invisible throughout. Stereo effects are used to enforce a sort of organization, marking out the individual territories of the various instruments. The first of the two tracks is the most rewarding, and achieves an almost mesmeric effect that the second track never gets close to. The presence of two saxes contributes quite a bit to this: they carry on a conversation of sorts that makes the 20 minutes of noise slide by quicker than seems possible. At points, it becomes difficult to believe that this music was recorded live in the studio-- these people make noises with their instruments and construct a layered sound that eludes most players with walls of effects at their disposal. There's a point about two-thirds of the way through Nipples where all the instruments-- with the exception of Peter Brotzmann's tenor sax-- stop playing. For about one minute, the sax emits long, almost toneless keenings. The sound just doesn't make sense. Then, you realize that Peter Brotzman has stopped playing his saxophone, and Papa Legba has taken over instead. Papa Legba is riding this man's sax-- a human being could not possibly be responsible for a noise like this. Today's musical landscape is marred by the footprints of lightweights and the layabouts who write about them. Emo-rockers who record albums while cramming for the SATs? So-called Latin superstars who have to see a tutor before recording a song in Spanish? Überhip geeks who spend less time and energy on their music than on installing home theaters in the mansions of famous murder victims? Forget it. Nipples may be by turns aggravating, inscrutable, cacophonous and soulless, but sitting next to today's crop on the New Release rack of your local Sam Goody, it seems the work of giants. Crazy, strung-out, Teutonic giants, but giants nonetheless.","Look, I know it's nothing to you, but I'm depressed. I'm depressed about music. Tito Puente\n ...

Coming to the stairs, I could hear Oddities chirping in a way all its own. As I ascended the staircase toward Spring Heel Jack, the songs of the Northern Bluebirds began to merge, melding in a most intriguing way. With each step, the joyous birdsong became softer and the primal electronica of Oddities grew more dominant, finally grinding the birds to silence at the top of the steps. In the kitchen making dinner, chopping avocado and scallion, I heard the phone ring. It was my friend, the opera singer. He began to tell me about his programs, his singing, and his women. His voice, trained to be powerful, began to linger with Oddities, which was playing in a boombox a few feet away. Opera voice and sharp electronic tones did battle between the sides of my brain. His voice, powerful and molasses-smooth, demanded attention with a velvet handgrip, but Oddities bludgeoned me with mechanical attacks in forward and reverse-- stretched and crushed beats and synth blasts. I shut off the player, sat down, and talked to my opera-singing buddy. The stereo's got a disc changer that'll play forever. You can fill it with music and just let it play. The other night, after the first disc of Yesyears played out, Oddities began. The Hippie and I were eating animal crackers and talking about the zucchini plants. She was topless, I was aroused. ""Root"" began to build, massaging my member with beats that were building... building... toward a climax. The zucchini hasn't been doing as well as it should. We discussed what could be done to save them as ""Root"" fell apart in tumbling pile of mislaid beats. I felt the blood rushing back to my head. I sat up here on the third floor, two fans running, writing this review. The speakers were blasting Oddities. I was smiling because somehow, Oddities has crept in. A long time ago, I wrote a disparaging review of Spring Heel Jack's 68 Million Shades and there was still a residue of that sentiment when Oddities came in the mail, but it has far surpassed my expectations. Made up of music from the private collection of John Coxon and Ashley Wales, Oddities**density of all the tracks is impressive. While not a terribly listenable album, the tracks that have beats are excellent and the ones that don't keep you guessing. The six-table ""BBC Radio 3"" gets tedious but it's courteously nestled at the end of the album, where only the truly strong dare tread. Don't bother if you're looking for drum-n-bass, though. Oddities is often beatless and would be more of a frustration than pleasure. Primal and strange, but so perfectly so, Oddities is for those seeking to mix abstraction with birdcalls.","Walking up the steps after a cigarette, thinking about an intimate evening with the Hippie, I heard the birds.

Survival Sickness,The (International) Noise Conspiracy,by: Adam Ohler,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b97413d197565213ae66/1:1/w_160/2343807f.gif,2000-05-09 05:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4109-survival-sickness/,EpitaphBurning HeartEpitaphBurning Heart,"The following is an excerpt from the advice column of Mr. Dennis Lyxzen, singer of The (International) Noise Conspiracy, translated from Swedish: Dear Mr. Lyxzen,
I have bad corns on my feet. I have tried all the recommended creams, medicines, and even acupuncture. These corns scare my children and keep up my wife at night. If they don't get better, she is going to leave me. How do I get rid of them? Help. Axel, Axvall Dear Axel,
These ""corns"" on your feet serve as a microcosm of the tools the ruling elite use to destroy the potential of the proletariat artist. They are a testament to the fact that the ordinary worker suffers at the hands of the elite's brutish corporations. Stop sustaining the system! Liberate yourself from societal boundaries and you shall truly be free. Solidarity. Dennis Dear Mr. Lyxzen,
Your singing for the Refused was rad. My friends and me thought all that political talk was so neat. I even went to the mall to buy an anarchy patch. It was expensive, but so worth it! Anyway, is your new band as cool as the Refused? I hope so because you rule! Erik, Saltsjo-Boo Dear Erik,
Music is nothing but an abstraction of an old and dull idea of bourgeois self-realization, the self-made success of the creative artist, thus leaving the rest to choke in the dust, settled to consume ""creativity"" in a boring package. Dennis Whoa! Did I just see what I think I saw? The last response you read was not a pathetic attempt by the author to belittle the (International) Noise Conspiracy and their politics; rather, it actually appears verbatim in the liner notes of Survival Sickness. The irony is, this album all but defines the ""boring package"" the Conspiracy is so adamant in destroying. Musically, the Noise Conspiracy seems content to rehash the mod sound into the same predictable ruts and and chord progressions honed by countless others. ""The Reproduction of Death"" and ""Smash It Up"" plead to be anything by the Make-Up. How revolutionary is a band that constantly retreats into standard verse/chorus routine? Oh, wait, I must be wrong since ""the lyrics all have to fit into the limits of the song, thus making them objects to issues like rhythm, rhyme and length, making the words one-dimensional and hallow of sorts."" This kind of excuse is a thumb-in-the-eye of all musical innovation. Just because these guys haven't created their own unique sound doesn't mean they should downplay the accomplishments of others. Have they heard the latest from Modest Mouse? Does the name Radiohead ring a bell? If you enjoy the pedantic babbling of some pseudo-intellectual anarchist know-it-alls, consider this album your new bible. The rest of us will wait for something better.","The following is an excerpt from the advice column of Mr. Dennis Lyxzen, singer of The (International) Noise Conspiracy, translated ...

The Geometrid,Looper,by: Meg Zamula,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd52ea9e61561daa76a6/1:1/w_160/197db699.gif,2000-05-09 05:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4852-the-geometrid/,Sub Pop,"The songwriting talent spectrum for members (and former members) of Belle and Sebastian is clearly defined. At one end, there's Stevie Jackson and Isobel Campbell, whose contributions to Fold Your Hands Child, You Walk Like a Peasant make for intermittently painful listening. At the other end is Stuart Murdoch, whose empathic accounts of young outsiders have captured the hearts and imaginations of the wussier subjects of the disenfranchised youth market. In between is ex-Belle and Sebastian bassist Stuart David, who has left the band to devote himself fully to Looper, a project based around keyboards and samplers. Looper has more in common with twee-tronic acts like Kitty Craft and the Busy Signals than his former band, a disparity that has grown remarkably more noticeable since Looper's first full-length, Up a Tree. Here, the addition of two bandmates and David's increased focus on the project has allowed for greater complexity than ever before. Sure, Up a Tree had its pleasures, but they were simple ones-- the gentle balladry of ""Quiet and Small,"" and David's account of the postal romance he shared with wife Karn were indisputably charming, but far from innovative. Although Stuart David is a novelist as well as a musician, the lyrics on The Geometrid sometimes tend towards the banal. This is probably linked to the phasing out of the sing/speak technique he employed on past efforts. However, repeated choruses of ""Hey, Uncle Ray/ Hee-eeey, Uncle Ray"" and ""Cut your money hair"" leave me nostalgic for the innocuous story- telling David of Up a Tree and The Boy with the Arab Strap's ""A Spaceboy Dream."" ""These Things,"" which pairs drum machine beats and assorted beeps with a ""wee"" guitar melody (as the liner notes put it), is one of the album's standout moments. David lists the things that bring him closer to happiness, including ""Seinfeld,"" IQU and New York. The pairing of technology and simplicity works best here, and on ""Tomorrow's World,"" on which Karn harmonizes in a pretty but unpolished manner, with her husband adding a very human vulnerability to the all-electronic arrangement. When David sings, ""I'm a precious little boy,"" he nails it on the head. Although it's unlikely that Stuart David will ever become as gifted a songwriter as Stuart Murdoch, he's crafted a distinctive sound with this band. The Geometrid serves as a charming, if slight, pleasure, but with more time to devote to the project, Looper may yet create a more substantial sound.","The songwriting talent spectrum for members (and former members) of Belle and Sebastian is clearly defined.

The Great Eastern,The Delgados,by: Paul Cooper,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b956eb335119a49ec74e/1:1/w_160/9a87505f.gif,2000-05-09 05:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2267-the-great-eastern/,Beggars Banquet,"Sometimes I think I'm really missing things. It's not that I'm unobservant or a fuckwit or anything. But sometimes events pass me by as I'm gazing, no doubt, at something far less exciting. For instance, I found out the best place to score drugs in my neighborhood isn't the street corner (as HBO would have you believe) but rather the upscale hair salon. Yes, hidden behind the Paul Mitchell hair care products, there are baggies galore of all your pharmaceutical faves. When I was growing up, the barber (my town enforced a strict ""no hair stylist"" policy) might mutter as he was buzz-cutting the little annoying hairs on your neck, ""Anything for the weekend, sir?"" By this, he did not mean a few twists of whizz or a coupla tabs. Nope, he meant rubbers. In fact, his crazy prophylactics were displayed on a cardboard dispenser. The dispenser had wee hooks on it which held aloft the johnnies. Printed on the cards were a really fast car and some woman in a bikini (0 to last base in 9 seconds or less-- not the image of the unselfish lover that might have been portrayed). You could gauge whether my town's male population was getting horny by how much of the image had been revealed since you last sat in the barber's chair. No one missed a thing back then. But somehow I missed the Delgados' transition from record label-owning stars-in-their-own-right to record label-owning prog-rock wannabes. The Delgados, as well as providing shelter for the immensely boozed-up talents of Arab Strap, Suckle and Mogwai with their aptly-titled Chemikal Underground Records, released a delicate wisp of Scottish indie-pop entitled Peloton. That album nearly gave itself a double hernia with all the imaginative songs and production sleights it gamely bore. Now the band follows up the greatest Scottish record since the Nectarine No. 9's A Sea with Three Stars with the ponderously self-conscious, woefully proggy The Great Eastern. Remember how disappointed you were when Belle and Sebastian followed up If You're Feeling Sinister with The Boy with the Arab Strap? Well, here's the reprise. In flagrant disobedience to the teachings contained in The Urban Buddhist's Handbook, I do not seek out disappointment. It's quite happy seeking me out, truth be told. The Great Eastern is the teeth-gnashing, lip-biting sound of a talented band reveling in studio time and awkward time signature changes. At this point, I'd like to let it be known that I've never divined the so-called appeal of Steely Dan. The Delgados probably love the quirky jazz changes that Fagan and Becker whack off in. Me, if it's got guitars in it, it'd better be in the style of either Iggy & the Stooges' Raw Power or Love's Forever Changes. To be fair, The Great Eastern doesn't show off in 15/8 compound time, though there are enough jarring transitions from 4/4 to waltzing \xBE. But one has to wonder why the band felt compelled to create some highly-wrought art when the simple directness of Peloton endeared itself limpit-like to my heart. Did the band members marry each other and turn their thoughts to creating immortal representations of their late thirty-something selves? Did they think they could out-wank Sonic Youth? Could be. Or maybe they bought hook-line-and-sinker the critics' fawning adoration and decided to give back real music with real musical significance. Sadly, this entails empty, platitudinous support of innovations such as speed garage and techstep drum-n-bass. For crying out loud, people, that's the only reason the Pastels exist-- so that NME and Magnet can drone on that real musicians remain unrecognized and tirelessly bemoan that the public adores stringy ginger-bearded geekatrons with PowerBooks running FuckmeElectro Version 7.46. Which is pretty much the reason why The Great Eastern doesn't execute well. It works too damn hard. The most seductive indie pop fluffers have been the Smiths' The Queen is Dead, Belle and Sebastian's Tigermilk, and the Stone Roses' self-titled album. James, Inspiral Carpets, and the Manic Street Preachers have fallen by the wayside, and with good reason. Unhinged from the huge Abacab-era Phil Collins drum sound, The Great Eastern's opening track, ""The Past That Suits You Best,"" would sound as pretty as a Spring rainfall on a Scottish glen. The band overburdens the simple beauty of ""Accused of Stealing"" with jarring time changes. On ""American Trilogy,"" however, the band captures the right blend of gently strummed guitars and overblown symphonic strings with tubular bells. The middle section even hints at the fey end of grunge, which is echoed in the line, ""No one can depress me more than I can."" ""Reasons for Silence (Ed's Song)"" showcases Emma Pollock's dreamy, pastoral vocals in a song that Nick Drake might have recognized from his Bryter Layter album. Pollack duets with Alun Woodward on ""Thirteen Gliding Principles"" as they trade half lines (""Lock the door/ Wash the floors/ Shine the shine"") until Metallica-esque heavy riffing and orchestral accompaniment barge their way into the domestic arrangements. Fortunately, that track is followed by the subdued piano figures and mournful cello of ""No Danger."" Woodward lullabies, ""Now I've got to choose/ Who from you is gonna lose and who is going through."" The responsibility weighs on him: ""We don't know we're strong enough and now we're singing out of tune."" After a brief reprise of the opening tranquillity, the band's rock tendencies steam in to rip up the peace. Pity. I understand that the band didn't want to release Peloton II. Nonetheless, it sounds like the Delgados threw their charming, sweetly laughing baby out with the bathwater and replaced it with all manner of musical flummery. Absurdly, they've gilded (or steel-girdered) a fragile lily. I hope I don't allow any stripped-down version to pass me by.","Sometimes I think I'm really missing things.

Volume One,Echoboy,by: Paul Cooper,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a154ea9e61561daa478e/1:1/w_160/63157957.jpg,2000-05-09 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2678-volume-one/,MuteMute,"Echoboy Richard Warren almost ended up in Oasis. He could have been strumming the chords to ""Wonderwall"" or close harmonizing with the monobrow Gallagher brothers. He declined their Neanderthal entreaties and cast aside the chance to contribute to the greatest rock and roll swindle since Guru Josh was denied his hard-earned place in Sheffield's Rock and Roll Museum. As you read this, Warren may be in a parallel universe blundering through the guitar tabs for ""Glass Onion"" or commenting on Liam's lyrical innovations (""I am a polyurethane parsnip/ I wander where my fancy takes me/ Then again I sometimes stay home with the wife/ And play whist""). He may be as ""mad for it"" as his fellow dribbling band mates. He may already have been ""outrageously"" arrested for possession of two grams of recreational PCP. We don't know. Not even Bill Nye knows. Luckily for us, we don't inhabit that universe. And I think Warren is happy about that good fortune, too. Because if we were spinning around in that nastiverse, Warren wouldn't be free to express his deliciously skewed notions of ""pop."" Pop, as it's presently packaged, is the polar opposite of rage rock. Pop is therefore either the sly jailbait purr of Britney Spears or the NAMBLA-approved falsetto of N'Sync. Echoboy wants Volume One to appeal to those confused about where to align ourselves. Do I devolve several steps down my phylum and invest in the Sony compilation Music for Date Rape? Or do I sport Abercrombie threads and risk being considered effete at best, a right twat at worst? It's not Mother Nature that forces us to make such delineated decisions; it's your evilly pimpalicious stepfather, Capitalism, and his malevolent MC, Creation of Demand. Not only does Echoboy want to offer an alternative to the above dilemma, he also wants to garner some of the applause reserved for experimental artists, too. Rather than being an art-house poseur like labelmates Appliance, Warren's strategy is to touchingly reference his skinny installation-whore buddies and sprinkle pop dust atop and throughout their click-cut-and-drone confections. For example, ""Kit and Holly"" comes on like Spaceman 3 on nitrous oxide. Boppy drones and contently eerie synth strings accompany a giddy Warren vocalizing his joys. And though I can detect traces of Playing with Fire throughout the track, I concentrate on Warren's unfettered, bewildering delight. Kit and Holly must be beautiful people and even better as a pair. You can't honestly say that about many of our species. Initially ""Model 352"" recalls the amphetamine electro of Suicide's ""Cheree,"" but Warren soon bores of the sulfate NYC 1970s and decamps to the claustrophobic sounds of Neu!'s Cologne. Rather than wanting to hurl himself from the 750-year-old cathedral spire of Cologne's main tourist attraction (medieval places of worship can sure be used as agents of Demand, says your evil stepdaddy!), Warren finds majesty and glamour amid the smog-incrusted stones. ""Model 352"" begins to ascend in a glorious revelation of unforeseen verticality. And dollars to donuts, I bet not even Mandy Moore can even bring your town perv to such ecstatic heights. From there, Warren flies us to ""Constantinople."" Amid the chirps of carapaced nocturnal beasties, Warren yanks the oriental melodica from the cold lips of deceased dub legend Augustus Pablo and riffs away until a barrage of white noise beats crush that ancient city into the malaria mud of the Bosphoros. But the melody seeps out of the ooze and proudly reprises itself once, before evaporating into whiffs of Turkish delight. Whether Warren wanted to scoop the world's zoologists or not, his ""Crocodile Milk"" introduces a hitherto unaware world to the sound of reptilian lactation. And what a disorienting sound it is! Bowed guitars thrim and scourge! Cologne Cathedral's organ plangently tones! The whole of Spiritualized's Royal Albert Hall rushes at me in fewer than six minutes! My heart beats thunderously! Now you understand why he would decline the Gallaghers' hairy-palmed offer. Echoboy slakes our thirst for accessible but quirky pop. He's not bursting to sound like a Tortoise side project like Kieren Hebden's Fridge outfit. He doesn't cling to retro-futurisms like Appliance and Trans Am, nor does he gild the lily like squirmtronicians such as Schneider TM and To Rococo Rot. And unlike Sean O'Hagan's High Llamas, who thrive on turning pop into dusty museum exhibits, Volume One succeeds by courting lip-gloss dalliances with the avant-garde, while showing off a coquettish midriff. It's a far more alluring sight than the Gallaghers' hirsute jowls, I assure you.","Echoboy Richard Warren almost ended up in Oasis.

Black Market Music,Placebo,by: Paul Cooper,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a0969d034d5c69bf275d/1:1/w_160/d2f2b89f.gif,2000-05-08 06:01:40,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6327-black-market-music/,Virgin,"While I've intentionally discounted acts as focus-grouped and market-tested as Britney and Mandy from my considerations, the UK trio Placebo have always struck me as the most calculating of bands. Black Market Music, the third installment of Placebo's rolling plan, only strengthens my convictions. The title alone justifies my concerns. Not only does it cause us to think that the music is illicit and illegal, it also overtly references one of London's hippest record shops, Black Market Records. (25 D'Arblay Street, close to Oxford Circus, backpacking vinyl fiends!) Placebo's eyeliner-and-lipgloss power-pop will never compare favorably with the masters of the trio, the Minutemen, Hüsker Dü, the Jam, and the Jimi Hendrix Experience. And frankly, that's not the band's aim. Their aim, apparent from their first days on the scene as London Suede emulators, is to sell consistently androgynous product to teenagers titillated by the screaming parade of someone else's bisexuality. Frontman Brian Molko is as convincing in this rub-me-the-right-way-and-I'll-make-out-with-you way as Brian Warner is at ducking pantomime Alice Cooper comparisons, and the closest he gets to the Ziggy Stardust he longs to be is wearing an Aladdin Sane Halloween costume. We're never led to believe that Molko has sex with men-- in fact, he's obviously about as bisexual as Tennessee Ernie Ford. Sometimes you just have to allow a guy his own fictions. As I suspected, Placebo retread the catchier moments from 1998's Without You I'm Nothing on Black Market Music, and roughen them up just enough to ensure top billing on commercial alternative playlists. Opening with ""Taste in Men,"" Placebo lazily reprise the Roland 303 industrial funk of ""Pure Morning."" Molko begs us to change our taste in men while he simpers and kills ""time on Valentine's/ Waiting for the day to end."" Molko also reveals, intentionally or otherwise, that ""it's been this way since Christmas time."" From this disclosure, we assume that a relationship that stretches from late December to the middle of February is a long one for him. The song also features a white-noise screech that's remarkably similar to the one that begins Depeche Mode's ""I Feel You."" ""Days Before You Came,"" no doubt, revels in the ""come"" double-entendre, as well as the flagrantly phallic imagery of ""a horn of plenty."" The song, a sad retread of ""You Don't Care About Us,"" proves that solipsism and self-plagiarism are now the band's most exercised skills. Placebo get that much meaner for ""Special K""-- probably not a paean to Kellogg's weight-watching breakfast cereal. Though lyrics like, ""Coming up beyond belief/ On this coronary thief/ More than just a leitmotif,"" and, ""Can this saviour be real/ Or are you just my seventh seal,"" are undeniably clumsy, Molko one-ups even these lines by referencing a series of trip-hop compilations in the couplet, ""You come on just like special k/ Now you're back with dope demand."" Brian Molko's hooker fantasies are paraded in the card-game-as-metaphor, ""Spite and Malice,"" which also attempts to resurrect the career of LSD rapper Justin Warfield. ""Aces take your time/ Queens are left for dead/ Jacks can stand in line/ And touch themselves instead."" It's later revealed that, in this squalling streetwalker symphony, the queens are also ""soft and wet"" as Molko prophesizes that ""everything will blow tonight/ Either friend or foe tonight."" After the product-of-a-broken-home bluster of ""Black-Eyed"" (how about this for masturbatory: ""I was never loyal/ Except to my pleasure zone?""), Molko and his merry men tell us about a novel they've written, which they've dedicated to mom. Of course, Molko can't resist rhyming ""mom"" with ""Uncle Tom,"" and spends the second half of ""Blue American"" questioning race relations: ""I read a book about Uncle Tom/ Where a whitey bastard made a bomb/ But now ebonics rule our song/ Those motherfuckers got it wrong."" ""Slave to the Wage"" marks out the next target of Molko's teenage sloganeering, incorporating a clanking allusion to Bob Dylan's ""Maggie's Farm"" (""Sick and tired of Maggie's Farm/ She's a bitch with broken arms""). But it's the opening lines of ""Commercial for Levi"" that really showcase Molko's laughable lyrical talent: ""You're the one who's always choking Trojan/ You're the one who's always bruised and broken!"" And how we stagger at the irony of the song's title. Later, on ""Haemoglobin,"" Molko gets to meet Jesus as he portrays himself as strange fruit, hanging from a tree. This self-obsession makes the Aquarian, Gaia-feminist male lyrics of James' Tim Booth seem like Cole Porter by comparison. And it's not as though Molko's voice distinguishes him when he delivers such cant; his whiny bluster has all the subtlety and attention to performance of a B-29 Superfortress. Bassist Stefan Olsdal and drummer Robert Schultzberg occasionally break from the lite-industrial rock that matches Molko's technique blunder-for-blunder. Their most effective, lighter-waving moment comes with the duet version of ""Without You I'm Nothing,"" which is apparently performed with David Bowie. Of course, Bowie's so far off-mike that his ""presence"" just seems like a marketing teaser. I'm sure, though, that it does Molko's immense ego a cosmos of good to upstage the original apostate androgyne, and the choice of this song for their duet proves that, had Bowie not paraded his kabuki man-woman on stage 30 years ago, Molko would probably be a bag-boy at Sainsbury's. The Depeche Mode squall cut-and-pasted into ""Taste in Men"" is reprised for Placebo's cover of ""I Feel You."" While their version contributes nothing but more growling guitars to the song, I'm astounded at the restraint and grace that Martin Gore imbued his lyrics with in comparison to the shameless juvenilia that Molko screeches. I suppose that the backstreet Black Market Music will endear itself to gender-exploring teenagers who find the girl-on-girl action in Buffy the Vampire Slayer ""fucking awesome."" Placebo seem to be tweaking their release schedule so that every couple of years-- as a new crop of bi-curious seventh-graders begin to ""experiment""-- they can ensure a fresh soundtrack to young boys' fashionably bi-polar circle-jerking. And best of all, it'll be available at every mall in America! How black market! But how long can Placebo and Molko continue reprising the same themes, the same vacant power-pop bravado? I predict Molko will most likely persist in his adolescent outsider fantasies until he's 57, whereupon Placebo will disband and he'll out himself as a card-carrying Tory and rail against gays, dole-scroungers, and the demise of the British Empire. Molko has already caused me to give praise the penitential, filthy-sacred lyrics of Martin Gore; now I'm forced to appreciate Steven Tyler, who, damnit, at least had the courage of his teenage lesbian nympho convictions when he cast his daughter in the ""Crazy"" video. The one sustainable quality that the songs Black Market Music possess is their resistance to parody. However hard I tried, Molko's lyrics outdid me in glammy doggerel. My best attempt is as follows: ""Libertine swigs Listerine
Ephedrine makes bad dreams
But I'm the reigning queen
Strawberries and cream taste supreme
But tulips on my organ make me scream
Oh the pain, oh the pleasure
It's my thrill, measure for measure
Pay the bill and wipe up later."" Though my Yankovician mockery flirts with internal rhymes and gauche, hints at hardcore substance abuse, and feigns predilection for low-rent trade, Molko will always outclass me. To him be the glory!","While I've intentionally discounted acts as focus-grouped and market-tested\n\ as Britney and Mandy from my considerations, the UK ...

Smile,The Jayhawks,by: Ryan Kearney,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a1bec0084474cd0bfea5/1:1/w_160/d75c540e.jpg,2000-05-04 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4221-smile/,ColumbiaColumbia,"There are some bands I just can't listen to on Sundays. Sonic Youth, Archers of Loaf, Brainiac, Girls Against Boys, and Neil Young (electric) are a few that come to mind. Then there are the artists I'm ten times more likely to play on Sunday than on any other day, like Brian Eno, Duke Ellington, Otis Redding, Yo La Tengo and Neil Young (acoustic). Great artists, of course, are great seven days a week (or, in the Beatles' case, eight days a week). And furthermore, in the right circumstances, I'll play these artists on any day of the week. Although perhaps not as exceptional as any of those mentioned above, the Jayhawks have always been my quintessential Sunday band-- their music always sounds particularly poignant or affecting on the Day of Rest. And this album, Smile, starts off like it could be their most Sunday album to date. It opens with an acoustic strum, a decremental piano bar, another acoustic strum, and again, a decremental piano, this time mimicked by an electric guitar in the background. ""Wake up/ Put your shoes on,"" sings frontman Gary Louris. ""Take a breath of the northern air/ And rub those eyes."" Louris' voice is so inviting that I oblige: I'm up, out of bed, shoes on. Now what? Well, I still need to find an apartment and a part-time job in the self- proclaimed greatest city on earth. No more than two weeks have passed and I'm already beaten down, dejected, and suffering from metropolitan loneliness and isolation, Charles Baudelaire-style. ""Chin up, chin up,"" chime Louris and Karen Grotberg. ""You don't really have a problem."" And goddamn, they're right. These rock stars-- they're so smart. So why the hideous distorted guitar jabs and unnecessary orchestration in the middle of the opening title track? It's the hand of grandiose producer Bob Ezrin-- the man behind the boards of Pink Floyd's The Wall, Kiss' Destroyer, and, of course, Kiss' Music from ""The Elder""-- whose flourishes spoil many of this record's perfectly fine moments. For instance, during the following track, ""I'm Gonna Make You Love Me,"" the Jayhawks are indulging in their trademark style of ruralternative when (presumably) Ezrin douses Louris' voice in reverb during the bridge. In doing so, he pulls the music out of the barroom and artificially implants it into a bad sci-fi novel. But the first true experimentation comes on the third track, ""What Led Me to This Town."" It begins with isolated acoustic chords and Louris' gentle tenor. But it's suddenly interrupted by mechanized drumbeats, accompanied by subtle, but very noticeable, Pole-like static blips. If hardcore Mark Olson-era Jayhawks' fans felt betrayed by the dark pop of 1997's Sound of Lies, they'll be downright vigilant after hearing Smile. A handful of other songs rely on looped beats that are, in some cases, sped up to the point where they approach hip-hop (""Somewhere in Ohio"") or even drum- n-bass (""(In My) Wildest Drums""). There are also moments of arena rock, and even arena-rock balladry, like the frighteningly Journey-esque ""Pretty Thing,"" on which Marc Perlman takes mic for a humble Jeff Tweedy impersonation. But Smile contains its share of front-porch songs, featuring the backing vocals of Grotberg. And even when showcasing greater musical ambition, their sound somehow remains essentially the same as it was three years ago. The biggest change, however, is that Smile is the thematic antithesis of Sound of Lies. Whereas the latter focused on the pain of broken relationships, this album is a much happier affair. And if there's one thing you can't fault the Louris-era Jayhawks for, it's aptly titling their albums. That's why Smile is more of a, say, Saturday afternoon album. I want my Sunday albums consistent, predictable, and preferably gloomy, reflective or sedate. I don't want Louris telling me to smile; I want him singing, ""My whole life has gone haywire,"" as he did on Sound of Lies. But I can't fault Louris for being happy or traveling new musical territory. Although not nearly the Smile Brian Wilson once created while slowly snapping, nor even as artistically successful as Wilco's genre break-out Summer Teeth, this is one of the finer, genuinely happy albums of the year.

Internal Wrangler,Clinic,by: Matt LeMay,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6009d034d5c69bf3422/1:1/w_160/4b077411.jpg,2000-05-02 05:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1513-internal-wrangler/,Domino,"A few years ago, I made the fatal mistake of trying to introduce my grandparents to the joys of rock. I figured, you know, they're pretty hip for old people-- they usually win at bridge, and they drive at night. Perhaps it'd be easier for me to relate to them if we had at least some sense of musical common ground. So, my grandfather entered into a pact with me: he would listen to a Beatles record if I would sit through the classic 1942 James Cagney Musical, Yankee Doodle Dandy. It seemed like a glimmer of hope, but it wasn't meant to be. The agreement quickly dissipated and my grandfather returned to blasting the ""noise"" that I listen to. ""It all sounds the same anyhow,"" he said. Immediately, I was on the defensive. I was prepared to rip my poor, defenseless grandpa to bits with my biting wit and immense store of rock knowledge. But instead, I found myself stumbling for something to say that could explain the differences between rock bands to an 80 year-old man who still considers Lawrence Welk ""cutting-edge."" Of course rock bands sound different! I mean, to say that the Beach Boys and AC/DC are virtually identical just seems off the mark. But for the most part, rock is defined by the presence of a few distinct elements-- mainly, the guitar/bass/drums setup. Plus, rock music hasn't traditionally broken out of fairly standard tonalities-- the majority of rock music, especially popular rock music, has always centered around a pretty limited number of chords and scales. And yet, out of these elements have come not only such a wide range of sounds, but a startlingly wide range of quality. Some bands have attained this by honing in on particular aspects of the rock sound-- one could very easily say something to the effect of, ""I like band a because of their x."" (Example: ""I like Don Caballero for their drummer,"" or, ""I like Britney Spears for her full, heaving melodies."") But the best rock music has very little to do with having one standout element. Not to slip into gestalt or anything, but the best rock truly is that which manages to be infinitely greater than the sum of its parts. It's an inexplicable quality, really, but the most important in rock. It's what sets apart the true playas from the sucka MCs. And Clinic has it in truckloads. There's nothing particularly ""experimental"" or ground-breaking about Internal Wrangler. Guitar, bass, and drums are the predominant instruments, with flourishes of organ and tinny drum samples thrown in. There are no microtonal guitar solos or squelching analog synthtones. The true beauty of Clinic is that they have, using a relatively standard rock vocabulary, constructed a truly distinctive, energetic, and magnetically appealing sound. ""Voodoo Wop"" opens Internal Wrangler with layers of drums, including bongos, which build upon a slinky bassline and snippets of ambient noise. Coupled with budget reverb that lends a garage-rock aesthetic, the track creates a wall of tension and uneasiness. But it isn't until the record's second track, ""Return of Evil Bill,"" that Clinic unleashes their secret weapon: lead singer Ade Blackburn. Blackburn's delivery melds the drony expression of Lou Reed with the fragility of Sigur Rós frontman Jón Thór Birgisson and the instability of Thom Yorke; he employs his voice not merely as a vehicle for lyrical expression, but as an entirely separate melodic and percussive element. One of the album's many peaks comes with Blackburn's incoherent ramblings on ""The Second Line."" As opposed to the ""yeah yeah yeah's"" that have become such a trite aspect of rock music, the mess of vowels and consonants that Blackburn spits out during the course of the song serve as a visceral outlet for his amazingly expressive voice. Clinic aren't interested in studio sheen and perfected instrumentation, which is exactly what makes them innovative. In a world of anally retentive college boys who spend hours at the mixing board to assure that every note is flawlessly delivered, in key, and not a 16th of a second off beat, Clinic's degree of spontaneity lends them an air of complete originality. To them, it's not about the production qualities, the change-up, or the nit-picking. It's not about anything other than playing the music itself. And more than anything else, that's what comes through on Internal Wrangler. Their delivery captures a mind-blowing live performance, despite its studio origins. It's tough to pick a single best moment from the record. Initially, I was drawn to the ""Heroin"" and ""Motion Picture Soundtrack"" hybrid, ""Distortions."" Over a nicely sequenced drum machine beat and hollow organ, Blackburn cries through a straitjacket of vacuum-sealed production, ""I want to know my body/ I want this out, not in me,"" as a lone trumpet releases a shrill yelp in the distance. As the song progresses, the lyrics become more cryptic and moving, culminating with indelible lines like, ""You cannot know how often/ I've pictured you in coffins/ My baby in a coffin."" As the lyrics grow bleaker, the song takes off, its rhythm increasing slightly as the trumpet returns with unfocused blasts. The closing ballad, ""Goodnight Georgie,"" is the most sparse track on Internal Wrangler, and one of the best. Relying almost exclusively on a gently strummed guitar, Blackburn's deeply affecting vocals, and occasional flourishes of trumpet, piano, and tambourine, the song brings into focus the band's astounding melodic sense, showcasing one of the most perfectly constructed vocal melodies to grace a record in years. But the brilliance of Clinic is not relegated to quasi-ballads like ""Goodnight Georgie."" Sloppy garage punk tracks like ""C.Q."" and ""Hippy Death Suite"" crank out raw, clanging noise, utilizing the same elements as their slower, more consonant counterparts, never sacrificing their seemingly inherent sense of dense rhythm and soaring melody. Many bands spend their entire careers trying to find a signature sound and perfect it. Clinic, on the other hand, have accomplished this feat with their debut full-length. Passionate, visceral, and immensely moving, Internal Wrangler is a landmark achievement not only for Clinic, but for all of rock music. It's the perfect testament to why rock will never die-- there will always be groups like Clinic who cannibalize their influences, pick out the tastiest bits, and reconstruct them into something that is not only completely their own, but embodies all the primal appeal of rock and roll. Internal Wrangler is that kind of album-- so engaging and well-executed, I can't imagine how anyone could not love it. Except, maybe, my grandpa.","A few years ago, I made the fatal mistake of trying to introduce my\n\ grandparents to the joys of ...

Synesthesia,Chicago Underground Duo,by: Matt LeMay,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a5afea9e61561daa51c7/1:1/w_160/1e6a348e.gif,2000-05-02 05:00:01,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1437-synesthesia/,Thrill JockeyThrill Jockey,"Remember Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon? It was all the rage a few years ago. It gave film nerds the chance to impress the hell out of friends and colleagues by putting their inane, useless knowledge of trivia to use. But why should movie fanatics have all the fun? We indie rock losers are just as knowledgeable-- why should we not sink to these same levels of inanity? Especially when we can challenge each other with Six Degrees of J. Robbins or, better yet, Jim O'Rourke. Granted, neither have the same ring to them as Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon, or the untouchable comedic value introduced by the mention of such a dendrite of '80s pop culture. But hey, it gives us indie fans a reason to know our shit (other than that it comes in handy when in the market for new albums). Here, I'll try a few: GUIDED BY VOICES played on the Lounge Ax Defense and Relocation compilation with TORTOISE, whose song ""Reference Resistance Gate"" was remixed by JIM O'ROURKE. NEUTRAL MILK HOTEL is on Merge Records, a label started by SUPERCHUNK, whose album Come Pick Me Up was produced by JIM O'ROURKE. Of course, I used two more difficult examples. If I'd started with anything out of Chicago, it would've taken two steps at most for me to find a connection with Jim. That's because the Chicago post-rock scene has played itself out in a seemingly endless series of permutations, resulting in a vast number of collaborative efforts. For the most part, these collaborations have been thoroughly enjoyable. Synesthesia, a collaboration between Isotope 217 cornetist Rob Mazurek and noted Chicago jazz drummer Chad Taylor, doesn't deviate from this trend-- it's a thoroughly enjoyable record, at times reaching even beyond that. Unfortunately, Mazurek's electronic wizardry doesn't always couple well with Taylor's more traditional free jazz stylings. Whereas other Chicago collaborations have been virtually seamless, Synesthesia can, for the most part, be broken down according to the influences of its two creators. The more adventurous passages obviously spring from the able mind of Mazurek, whereas Taylor's portion consists of extended forays into free jazz, complete with wanky drum solos. Synesthesia's opening track, ""Blue Sparks from Her and the Scent of Lightning,"" stands out as simply one of the most remarkable pieces of music I've heard in a long time. Clocking in at well over 11 minutes, ""Blue Sparks"" manages to pull off what very little music from any genre can, subtly foreshadowing what's coming next. The first four or so minutes hint at an oncoming storm with ominously building layers of atonal synthesizers paired with intermittent blasts from Mazurek's horn. As these layers of cacophonous melody are stripped down to a single repeating vibraphone melody, a squelching synthesized bassline comes in, just in time for the track to explode into an orgy of Latin-tinged percussion and screeching coronet. This eruption of sound gives way to almost absolute silence, broken only by a whispering synthesizer. Unfortunately, the exotic noises and immense sonic variety of ""Blue Sparks"" are not to be seen again until much later in the record. Synesthesia's midsection suffers from a severe lack of innovation. Tracks like ""Bellatron"" are straight up free-jazz tunes which would be fine on a record of straight-up free-jazz tunes, but sound uninspired when compared to the sheer originality of some of Synesthesia's other tracks. It isn't until the fifth track, ""Fluxus,"" which features fellow Chicagoan Sam Prekop on Moog, that Synesthesia once again begins to pick up steam. Here, Mazurek and Taylor shift seamlessly and effortlessly between the chaotic and the melodic, displaying serious talent that could only be the result of years of practice. For a record with such startling and emphatic dynamics changes, the better portions of Synesthesia are remarkably smooth. Before there was the Chicago Underground Duo, there was the Chicago Underground Trio. Before that, there was the Chicago Underground Orchestra. Mazurek seems to be chipping away at band members and, in doing so, bringing his own unique brand of genre-twisting, rock-influenced electronic jazz into focus. With Synesthesia, Mazurek proves once and for all that he's more than just an ace horn player.","Remember Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon? It was all the rage a few years ago. It gave film nerds\n ...

You Can Always Get What You Want,Trans Am,by: Ryan Schreiber,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Founder</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a7f7ea9e61561daa56ea/1:1/w_160/dbca1cc4.gif,2000-05-02 05:00:00,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8133-you-can-always-get-what-you-want/,Thrill Jockey,"Once I had a keyboard. A little Casio keyboard. It had cheap plastic drum pads and goofy preprogrammed ""computer"" sounds. Unfortunately, I had to give it back to the kid I borrowed it from, but while the fun lasted, I got a huge kick out of its 100-instrument tone-bank. And from the sound of it, Trans Am did, too. Their new Japanese b-sides collection, You Can Always Get What You Want, employs that same preprogrammed Casio ""computer"" patch as the primary structure for the opening track, ""American Kooter."" Essentially, the track, which originally appeared in nine-minute studio form on their excellent self-titled 1995 debut, is a demo of all the cool sounds that very Casio can generate. The buzzing ""airplane"" sound, the emergency faux-""ambulance"" siren, the ""piano""-- it's all here in tinny, distorted glory, backed by a thunderous drum section and confused bass line. And though the track's low-fidelity epileptic funk is powerful enough to move crowds of uptight, arty Chicago scenesters, ""American Kooter"" remains both one of the band's least inspired songs to date. You Can Always Get What You Want assembles 65 minutes of Trans Am's massive catalog of import-only and previously unreleased tracks, and opens and closes with live performances. The first three songs, ""American Kooter,"" ""Simulacrum"" and ""Man-Machine,"" are culled from a 1993 EP on UK-based SKAM records, and were recorded live at the Cave in Chapel Hill, North Carolina during that summer. But regardless of the fact that these are some of the band's earliest recordings, they're performed with an intensity that the band has rarely been able to achieve on subsequent studio albums-- guitars pick on frayed nerve-endings, hi-hats click with robotic precision, and crowd cheers reverberate in drunken frenzies. Strangely, the album's final tracks-- live versions of four songs from 1996's Surrender to the Night, recorded that fall at Washington, D.C.'s Black Cat-- are much closer to their studio counterparts and considerably less engaging. The majority of this record is composed of lost studio cuts yanked from the several hard-to-find releases of Trans Am lore-- a 1995 Strength Magazine split 7"", Tuba Frenzy #3, the rare Australian comp In Flux Us-- alongside stray vault tracks like the beautifully haywire ""Nazi/Hippie Empire,"" a chopped-up ""Party Mix"" of Futureworld's ""Am Rhein,"" and the ambient, kraut-inflected ""Monica's Story."" It's during these tracks that Trans Am provide fans with their most promising music to date, and hopefully, foreshadow future albums. Despite this compilation's general lack of cohesiveness and its seemingly aimless live closers, You Can Always Get What You Want hits more than it misses. And in the end, it fulfills its purpose to save fans hundreds of dollars on overseas postage and import mark-ups. No longer will Trans Am junkies tirelessly search eBay in hopes of encountering a $30 copy of the band's Illegal Ass 12"" or scrounge through racks of disorganized 7""s in New York record stores. If you're looking for a place to start with these guys, though, go for their 1995 debut or 1998's The Surveillance.","Once I had a keyboard. A little Casio keyboard.

The Facts of Life,Black Box Recorder,by: Rich Juzwiak,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a2d09d034d5c69bf2cb2/1:1/w_160/b3dadbf3.gif,2000-05-01 06:01:40,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/742-the-facts-of-life/,Jetset,"While not quite notorious, Black Box Recorder earned at least a tad of infamy when a song of theirs was banned from UK radio in 1998. Their first single, ""Child Psychology,"" cooed wisdom in its chorus: ""Life is unfair; kill yourself or get over it."" Sure, they were just being wry and British, but it didn't matter to the powers-that-be; apparently, kidding or not, telling people to commit suicide was far too scandalous. It's important to note that our own MTV Yank also refused to air the video until the line was edited. And so it was. The video was aired, like, once on ""120 Minutes"" (naturally), and Black Box Recorder slipped into the typical obscurity British bands can come to expect in America. It didn't really matter though, because their debut, England Made Me, was an unremarkable bit of pretentious moroseness that pleased itself more than it could possibly please most listeners. The Facts of Life isn't necessarily a conscious move to keep censors and listeners happy, but it's bound to do both much more successfully than its predecessor. With this record, the Black Box Recorder crew-- John Moore, ex-Auteur Luke Haines, and vocalist Sarah Nixey-- trade straight-faced, desert-arid humor for genuine grins. Musically, the album is more finely crafted than England Made Me, even if it follows the same minimalist, laconic approach to pop music. But this time out, the bare-bones approach is more lush and rich, paradoxically proving that ""minimal"" does not necessarily have to mean ""sparse."" The album's opener, ""The Art of Driving,"" is a majestic, sweeping number that uses an echo-laden beat, sodden bass, and lightly strummed guitar to create a pillow of sound. The chorus of ""French Rock 'N' Roll"" is graced with a searing guitar hook that intensifies the canned drums and xylophone twinkling. ""Straight Life"" is as subdued as the rest of the record, though buried is a perfect midtempo, subdued electro beat. It's all extremely pretty, and without seeming completely manipulative or cloying. Black Box Recorder, however, are still a bit dopey when it comes to lyrics. True, they're no longer fretting over the end of the world and all things maudlin. Instead, they exhibit a preoccupation with transit, on tunes like the aforementioned ""The Art of Driving"" and ""The English Motorway System."" Vocalist Sarah Nixey still sounds faulty in her cleverness and smugness. The male-female spoken banter on ""The Art of Driving"" plays like a British answer to Mad magazine's ""Snappy Answers to Stupid Questions"" as Nixey is asked ""Do you believe in love at first sight?/ Do you believe in fate?"" Her terribly silly answer is: ""I believe that good things only come to those who wait."" The lyrics fare no better when the subject turns to sex, as it often does. The title track sports a lite reggae beat and melody that sounds all too similar to Dido's ""Thank You."" We find Nixey staccato, nearly rapping during the verses when she takes the role of a fifth grade health teacher: ""When boys are just 11/ They begin to grow in height/ At a faster rate than they have done before/ They develop curiosity/ And start to fantasize/ About the things they've never thought of doing before."" Similarly ""naughty"" (or at least, they seem to think so) is ""Sex Life,"" which tries its hand at being provocative with lines like ""Girl on girl/ In your dreams/ Girl's on top/ In between/ Girls together/ Girls alone/ In your dreams/ In your dreams."" She goes on to substitute girl with ""boy,"" which is obviously not enough to make the lyrics any less laughable. Plus, Blur beat them to the punch with ""Girls and Boys."" But Nixey isn't utterly at fault since she's merely a mouthpiece. She doesn't write any of the lyrics (or music, for that matter) that she sings, which may account for her sleepy delivery. When she's not merely speaking and opens her pipes to really sing, she proves herself a righteous puppet. Her delicate, melismatic approach is often gorgeous and perfectly suited by the music the boys lay under her. Her voice is uncannily similar to Olivia Newton-John's and what's even scarier is that it works. The Facts of Life, contrived bawdiness and all, probably won't cause the stir of ""controversy"" that the first record did, and Black Box Recorder sound all the better for it. Still, there's no telling what the UK or our great nation may deem inappropriate; even Newton-John's ""Physical"" was banned from a few radio stations in Utah. Apparently, some Mormons even frown on euphemism. No matter, because the question here isn't so much, ""Have you never been mellow?"" as it is, ""When have you not been mellow?"" For Black Box Recorder, it's been a long time. Let's hope they find themselves even more chill when it comes time to write lyrics for the next album.","While not quite notorious, Black Box Recorder earned at least a tad of infamy when a song of theirs was ...

All Hands on the Bad One,Sleater-Kinney,by: Brent DiCrescenzo,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a454b1335d7bf169891f/1:1/w_160/8fc1fa09.jpg,2000-04-30 05:00:13,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7239-all-hands-on-the-bad-one/,Kill Rock Stars,"I've been waiting anxiously in the foothills for Corin Tucker's voice to come down off the mountain. At night the villagers used to hear her baying at the moon. Alas, the impassioned Sleater-Kinney frontwoman has left her banshee goat of a wail up to pasture on the craggy cliffs. All Hands on the Bad One finds the Northwest power-trio at their most melodic, playful, sarcastic, and punchy. Occasionally the spirit of the goat god still springs from Tucker's belly, but these screams follow baiting pop harmonies. Besides, when Rolling Stone uses the words ""brilliant"" and ""fury"" in the latest glowing Britney Spears review, Corin's outbursts feel positively baptismal. Sleater-Kinney and Fugazi reside alone in the top echelon of American punk rock. They make darling twins. Both bands continue to grow in talent, despite the jaded whines of old schoolers. Both feature dueling guitars that bobble complex, inventive lines like ping-pong paddles. (And Sleater-Kinney don't even need a bassist to lock the groove.) Both can raise the hair on the back of your neck, the ass out your seat, and the volume on your stereo. Most importantly, both hold a mirror up to the face of themselves, their scene, and society in general. You better believe that ""And for all the ladies out there I wish/ We could write more than the next/ Marketing bid/ Culture is what we make it/ Now is the time to invent!"" is the ""We owe you nothing/ You have no control!"" of 2000. Now that the smoke has blown away after the media exploitation of the riot grrl scene, the true believers remain behind-- not working PR for emo bands. But preaching has its limits. After all, a band can't write a song called ""You're No Rock n' Roll Fun,"" and load it with lyrics such as, ""Like a piece of art/ That no one can touch/ Your head is always up/ In the clouds/ Writing your songs/ Won't you ever come down,"" without actually having some fun. The album opens with the proposition of ""Eye cream and thigh cream/ How 'bout a get-high cream"" before shouting ""but I gotta rock!"" and bursting into oo-waah's and handclaps. ""Milkshake n' Honey"" spits wit at expatriates in Paris as Corin rolls her eyes at the type of denizens in The Sun Also Rises. Acting the roll of the insolent daughter, Tucker exclaims, ""Daddy says I got my mama's mouth/ I'm all about a forked tongue and a dirty house."" But this isn't poetry! More than ever, S-K put four to the floor and hammer away on infectious riffs. A brash return to vigor after the mellower The Hot Rock, All Hands will win over new ears who previously found the sound too sky high, loose, and angular. Like a David Mamet character rewrite over a Joel Schumacher script, Corin reveals greater character depth than ever before. All Hands on the Bad One finds Sleater-Kinney at their most fist-pumping (on the title track), lovely (""Leave You Behind""), longing (""The Swimmer""), and bratty (""The Professional""). Janet Weiss hammers harder, Carrie Brownstein smothers with perfect harmonies while digging deeper on the E string, and Corin grabs your aorta and strokes. When Sleater-Kinney, the band with the busiest guitar lines and boldest voice, turn in their best effort yet, it demands your attention.","I've been waiting anxiously in the foothills for Corin Tucker's voice to come down off the mountain.

Automatic Midnight,Hot Snakes,by: Judson Picco,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c1245e6ef9596932366f/1:1/w_160/42ada377.gif,2000-04-30 05:00:12,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3931-automatic-midnight/,Swami,"Ain't nothing wrong with a little predictability every now and again. Let's face it: when you pick up a record by a band with cover art like this, and a name like Hot Snakes, you have a pretty good idea what you're getting yourself into. Automatic Midnight is no feast for the eyes. And judging by those first couple of sentences, this review's nothing special, either. To do justice to Hot Snakes, though, it's got to do its job predictably-- and do it predictably well. This particular breed of Hot Snake could hardly come from a better line of descent. John Reis and Rick Fork (aka Speedo and Eric Froeberg, respectively) are the boys that brought you Rocket from the Crypt and Drive Like Jehu, and drummer Jason Kourkounis of The Delta 72 adds a percussive x-factor to the proceedings. These three mesh like well-worn gears, dousing the machines of their history with fresh oil. Hot Snakes commit a revival, and one not too conceptually distant from the Credence Clearwater camp. These guys refuse to be anything but what they are. The opener, ""If Credit's What Matters I'll Take Credit"", betrays a bit of Fork's Fogarty leanings. Where Reis once tied his CCR to vintage-sounding roots-rock perfection and took all the blame and fame, Hot Snakes confidently delve deep into the proven past of Rocket from the Crypt and Drive Like Jehu, certain they'll turn up gold. ""I'll Take Credit"" showcases Fork's signature falsetto bawl; his unintelligible exhortations achieve meaning through sheer ferocity. The drums may ache more than Fork's throat at the end of this one. ""No Hands"" crunchingly juxtaposes Jehu-styled guitar arithmetic with Kourkounis' metronomic devastation; his simple power derives from the Russell Simins school of might over matter. By this point in the record, it's clear that the mathy time-keeping of Drive's Mark Trombino have succumbed to a less kind, less gentle momentum. Kourkounis manages to come off more rock, more real, and somehow more America. ""Salton City"" speaks of Fork's ""civic duty"" and that he's ""read up on Bergen/ Belsen,"" just before a distant female yells, ""Give us a kiss,"" a call echoed in some vague '60s bubblegum pop classic. Cleverly buried Americanisms litter Automatic Midnight throughout. ""Apartment 0,"" heavy on toms, less so on direction, wants badly to recall instrumental surf-punk. Instead, it lurks the San Diego shore in shark-like search of a fallen surfer. A similar pound on ""Our Work Fills the Pews"" introduces a lyric/retort sermon, preaching the kind of swagger that's kept Royal Trux's collection plate full for so long. In the end, Automatic Midnight makes you want to drive a littler faster down a potholed road, turn the stereo up a notch higher than usual, and nod minutely at anyone annoyed by your raucous passing. The smashing of the millennial barrier hasn't broken anything in Reis and Fork's model for San Diegan dominance. And what ain't broke, Hot Snakes ain't fixin' here.","Ain't nothing wrong with a little predictability every now and again. Let's face it: when you pick up ...

Electric Pink EP,The Promise Ring,by: Brent DiCrescenzo,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a146b1335d7bf16981fa/1:1/w_160/3a40d4a3.gif,2000-04-30 05:00:11,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6495-electric-pink-ep/,Jade Tree,"The Spinal Tap-ian response to this unnecessary EP would simply be ""electric stink."" Alas, I must now waste time and brain coming up with approximately 600 words justifying the sub-1.0 rating above. Certainly this is more time than the Promise Ring spent writing these four songs. And this is not speculation. It takes approximately 0.7 seconds to conceptualize these songs, because they've already been written 0.7 x 10^7 times-- this year. On the opening title track, Davey von Bohlen hisses and spits up, ""I live on a small street/ With very small shoes/ But in a big house/ With a big wardrobe,"" over a bassline lifted from the Pixies' ""Where Is My Mind?"" Then-- get this-- a slow C-G power riff comes in! For those unfamiliar with chords, this basic fifth is essentially the progression of just about 78% of all pop songs ever written. This continual dumbing down of rock music must stop. It's insulting that the Promise Ring would even try to pass this off as original songwriting. Right now, 13 year-olds in basements are figuring out the very same song on their own with clumsy pubescent fingers, thanks to some downloaded Blink 182 tabs. ""Strictly Television,"" the second track, bops along on little more than a C chord. Squirt some absurd poetry on top through the lispy lips of a white guy who couldn't carry a tune in a wheelbarrow and, yay, it's the Promise Ring! Yay! Mike Patton recently released a CD by the Kids of Widney High on his Ipecac label. This shameless album showcases the songwriting of 'special' kids from Widney High. Frighteningly, these children with Down's Syndrome craft better pop than the Promise Ring. In fact, the parallels are remarkable. If I asked you which of the two groups wrote the songs ""Pretty Girls,"" ""Doctor Doctor,"" and ""Every Girl's My Girlfriend,"" which would you say? If you guessed the Promise Ring for any of those, the joke's on TPR. Even with the crushing guilt of cruel exploitation hovering over my head, I'd listen to the Widney kids before the Promise Ring. I enjoy the better singing. ""American Girl"" (see?!) drops back into predicable acoustic balladry as Davey rattles, ""American girl/ Queen radio/ Plays hours low/ Fills the spaces we know/ And time is tight/ But not tonight."" Why does a band that blatantly yearns for the mainstream with below-basic structures and simple rhyme schemes try to alienate with slop lyrics and wounded pig vocals? Is this their tether to the 'underground?' Oh I see, it's art because it's unlistenable. But I don't think doctors on ""ER"" will be singing this to cancer patients in upcoming episodes. As much as they want to hit rock radio and the soundtracks to Joshua Jackson flicks, the Promise Ring will simply never get past the excruciating vocals. For further spoil, the Pringle boys will not get to savor intended irony as their new song ""Make Me a Mix Tape"" will not actually show up on anyone's mix tape. Ah, who am I kidding? Some kid with Hobbit hair is dubbing it right now for a girl in Delia's garments. This same fellow will soon take a break from analog romance to scribe some hatemail to me. I have prepared a generic response in anticipation. You may save yourself the effort and paste the following into an e-mail to yourself: ""Anything, anything, is more important than this record. This vitriol and venom comes from severe disappointment, not bitterness. Is this the best independent music has to offer? If indie rock has come to slowed-down, pillowfight pop-punk, punch me out. Attached you will find a list of 457 bands I recommend over this release.

"Folk Songs for Trains, Trees and Honey",Savath y Savalas,by: Brent S. Sirota,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a35e9d034d5c69bf2de4/1:1/w_160/fa7d5e6e.gif,2000-04-30 05:00:10,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7007-folk-songs-for-trains-trees-and-honey/,Hefty,"Tortoise's Millions Now Living Will Never Die was so troublingly serene in execution that I was undone the first time I heard it. The music on that disc seemed to alternate capriciously between the sound of conspiracy and the sound of accident. In certain moments, Millions Now Living actually sounded millions of years in the making: the layers had happened upon each other in an accidental intimacy in the manner of continents. So when Tortoise's TNT failed to produce this uncanny preordained sense of absolute rightness, people turned on it somewhat, overlooking its facile loveliness. Savath & Savalas' hokey-titled Folk Songs for Trains, Trees and Honey is electronic Chicago post-rock in the vein of TNT. It's easy ambient, not quite as terrestrially expansive as, say, Global Communications' 76:14 or astronomically warped as The Orb's Adventures Beyond the Ultraworld. The music is truly beautiful, the groove is faithful and the effects enchant without alienating. The whole project has a massage-chair energy, purring constantly under the backside of the mind. What you get with the vibrating massage chair is consistency; what you sacrifice is the awkward and often vague sexuality of a human massage. There's no jeopardy in Folk Songs: you don't risk losing your mind, but you don't chance falling in love. Socrates points it out in Plato's Symposium: Love is temporal. What we love passionately today we love all the more passionately because there's always the possibility that the object of our affections will not be there tomorrow. But the pleasant grooving sway of Folk Songs for Trains, Trees and Honey will always be there, right where you left it when your mind and ears wandered off. This is not to disparage the subtlety of Savath & Savalas' craft, because the pleasantry is textured and self-effacing by design. But it fails to terrify. You never get the sense that you must listen to a particular moment because the entire record exists on the verge of being undone. Just the opposite, actually-- this is ambient true to Brian Eno's intentions: sonic wallpaper, perfected in disappearance. Like a stick of incense, Savath & Savalas' music will continue to perfume the environment long after you have ceased to pay attention to the source. Unfortunately, Folk Songs for Trains, Trees and Honey just barely breaks the 30-minute mark. Great ambient needs time to erase itself, to nuzzle itself in the quiet of an ordinary room, unobtrusive as passing traffic and street-level exchanges, or footfall overhead. But the album is nevertheless a fine if somewhat innocuous debut, and it'll sketch and slip about the sonic periphery with almost feline equipoise. No more bad dreams. It's easy like Sunday morning.","Tortoise's Millions Now Living Will Never Die was so troublingly serene in execution that I was undone the first ...

In Session,Dinosaur Jr.,by: Chip Chanko,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b9915e6ef959693229be/1:1/w_160/cee14c54.gif,2000-04-30 05:00:09,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2323-in-session/,Fuel 2000,"I sold all of my Dinosaur Jr records at an indie rock flea market years ago. Actually, I sold all but two. It took me three days to decide whether or not to go through with it. The final compromise was that I would keep You're Living All Over Me and Where You Been and dump the rest. I listened to each of the discs one last time before packing them up along with my Some Velvet Sidewalk records and that two-disc Chairman of the Board Sinatra tribute album Grass Records put out forever ago. I don't know why I held onto these two albums specifically. Yeah, they were my favorites of the bunch, but in the end, it wasn't enough. My kind heart and high school memories gave way to an empty wallet, and I eventually even sold those to a used CD store. I was Dinosaur Jr-less for four years until now. My hopes sprang when I saw I was being handed this new BBC collection to review. After so long without the simple comforts of J Mascis and friends, I was pretty eager to hear them again. Maybe I'd changed in all those years. I hadn't. Or at least, distance hadn't made the heart grow fonder. Dinosaur Jr live sounds pretty much the same as their old albums, and that sound is pretty much the same, even after our period apart. Of course, all but two of these tracks were recorded in 1988-89 (dating up to Bug) so they should sound like the first few albums. But while these recordings catch the band in both their seminal line-ups, with Lou Barlow on bass, and at the peak of their early years, the actual performances hardly stand apart from their studio counterparts. If anything, it's easier to tell what's going on in the songs more without the super lo-fi, in-the-red, shrill feedback production to get in the way. But is that a good thing? I miss the fuzz. The two standout moments come with the leadoff track, ""In a Jar"", and ""Raisans"", both culled from You're Living All Over Me. In these rare instances, the band really puts on a tight performance, with Mascis' guitar wailing masterfully, Barlow's creative basslines and Murph's insidious drumming proving the band's technique had advanced substantially over two years. But sadly, nothing else jumps out, because ultimately, it's all much more interesting on the original albums. If you still have those old records, just play them instead of going out of your way for this one. And if that doesn't satisfy you, I still have that two-disc Sinatra tribute.","I sold all of my Dinosaur Jr records at an indie rock flea market years ago. Actually, I sold all ...

We are floating in dreams-- dreams woven of sustained overtones, duration and pitch playing tricks on our ears and distorting our sense of time and place. It began with this, funny enough. Lou Reed's infamous Metal Machine Music; Jim O'Rourke's unlikely entrance in the pantheon of indie rock; all those SYR EPs and Sonic Youth's rectum-suffocated worship of the avant-garde; these instances and countless others were all born from the same seed: the legend of the Theatre of Eternal Music, La Monte Young's Dream Syndicate. One of the most significant and controversial releases of 1965, Inside the Dream Syndicate offers a glimpse behind the mysterious curtain. It's what you might have heard had you been fortunate and bold enough to sit in on one of the Dream Syndicate's legendary '60s performances. Mind-numbing waves of amplified strings, slowly bowed to maintain overlapping drones the likes of which you never thought you'd ever want to listen to-- alienating, enveloping sound, seemingly devoid of notation and sense. ""Outrageous!"" was the cry when Lou Reed unleashed Metal Machine Music. ""You should have heard the Dream Syndicate,"" was Reed's response. But don't let the band's name fool you: they're not to be confused with the Paisley Underground psych-pop band that adopted the moniker as a high-brow homage in the early '80s. This is the high-throttle point when 20th Century Classical almost became rock 'n' roll. This is the Big Bang of Minimalism. And just look at the star power: a pre-Velvets John Cale on viola; venerable avant-garde composer and filmmaker Tony Conrad on violin (he was Mercury Rev's mentor at SUNY Buffalo, don'tcha know); poet and percussionist Angus MacLise on tabla; and one of the weirdest, most visionary of artistic marriages in John Cage protégé La Monte Young and visual artist Marian Zazeela, who provide vocal drones and conceptual direction to the project. La Monte Young owns the original performance and rehearsal recordings of the Dream Syndicate and refuses their release, much to the frustration of Cale and Conrad. He insists that he should be credited to the sole ""composer"" of the music-- himself. Cale and Conrad have always maintained otherwise, that it was a collaborative effort in performance and improvisation, and that they shall never cede complete authorial credit to Young alone. This dispute, along with Young's intractable perfectionism, has prevented the world for the past 35 years from hearing just what those five headcases were up to. However, some high-quality bootlegs (""an additional cache of tapes,"" it's said) have surfaced, so here we have it: a healthy dose of controversy and confusion, and the first semi-legit release of Dream Music ever, credited to all five. La Monte Young is pissed, noting imperfections in the mix, length, etc. But any way you cut it, avant-garde indie Table of the Elements has balls, and this release is ideal. This music is not meant to be listened to on headphones. It is difficult, should fill space, bounce off walls, clear rooms, and mess with your head. Appropriate volume levels do not exist for what is on this disc. Originally, Dream Syndicate performances were debauched night-long endurance tests, presaging the vibrant rave scene that would follow. Goodbye 20th Century? I think not. The past always comes back to haunt you.","Ladies and gentlemen, forget about floating in space. We are floating in\n\ dreams-- dreams woven of sustained overtones, duration ...

It's Very Stimulating EP,MC Paul Barman,by: Ryan Kearney,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a21b13d19756521387b9/1:1/w_160/1168f0e6.gif,2000-04-30 05:00:07,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/566-its-very-stimulating-ep/,Wordsound,"How could I know then that this would be my most distinct memory of being a young boy in Ridgewood, New Jersey? After all, we were too young to think of memory. Or even of respecting the dead, for that matter. The older kid-- who we deemed ""cool"" solely because he was older-- came up with the idea. He'd even tied the rope around the neck of the bird, which lay slumped in the wet leaves by the roadside. But he couldn't commit the final act, leaving it instead for someone younger and more impressionable. Someone who wanted to be seen as cool by the older kid. Someone who wasn't me. My best friend and next-door neighbor stepped up, grabbed the string, whirled the bird. I believe he yelled, ""Lasso!"" just as the body separated from the head and flew aloft in an NFL Films-style slow-motion arc. With onlookers mouths' agape, it descended through the sunroof a yellow Le Car that had come to a stop at the nearby intersection. The denouement wasn't enough to instill laughter, fear, the flight response, or anything else related to emotional shock or physical paralysis. The car door flung open, as car doors have a tendency to do in such moments, and a tall, hysterical, mini-skirted woman flung herself from the small cab. Her long brown hair danced in the wind, and her white blouse rippled like the main sheet of a jibing sailboat. But that tight skirt kept her legs from pumping hard enough, so that despite our delayed reaction, escaping was relatively easy. Once safe, the other emotions kicked in. We laughed in disbelief, then felt fear that she recognized one of us, and finally ""broke up,"" fleeing to our respective homes to avoid capture and reduce suspicion, as all smart suburban guerrillas will do. I bet Paul Barman had an experience like this. Not exactly, but something like it. Everyone who grew up in Ridgewood had at least one. But then again, like most aspiring rappers these days, Paul left Ridgewood to attend Brown University. So maybe he was always smart enough to avoid such inhuman behavior as ours. But Prince Paul must have heard something he liked because he decided to produce this EP. Thus, the opening track, ""Joy of Your World,"" begins with a stuttered beat that rises in volume before breaking into a steady, unchallenging groove, accompanied by a leisurely clarinet and harp swipes. A lounge piano is haphazardly beaten during Barman's rhymes, but-- in typical Prince Paul fashion-- that's all you get. You shouldn't, wouldn't and don't buy this album for fresh, inventive beats. The first six lines are a perfect representation of the ""not so enigmatic as the press seems to think"" MC Paul Barman (see the right column for a quick breakdown): What saves Paul Barman is that his lyrics, while sometimes offputting, are often very funny. ""Joy of Your World,"" for instance, is a slight parody of Lauryn Hill's ""To Zion."" During the chorus, he sings, ""Now the joy/ Of your world/ Is Paul Barman,"" immediately followed by a high pitched ""beautiful, beautiful Barman."" He's funniest, however, when rapping about sex-- ""I'll still be rhymin' when I'm in your hymen.../ I'm a hunter-gatherer, a cunter-latherer""-- or lack thereof-- ""Those ancient Hamptonites/ They're always like, 'I can't tonight.'"" Reading those first two lines, you might be slightly disturbed. But given his obvious lack of seriousness, as well as the frequency with which he criticizes his sexual inadequacies, Barman won't have you crying, ""Misogyny!"" as Eminem would. Rather, it's just the subconscious musings of an Ivy League rapper whose distorted-speed flow sounds like a warped cassette in a broken tape deck. Like wrapping a string around a dead bird, spinning it through the air, and seeing its body fly into the sunroof of a Le Car, MC Paul Barman is odd, funny, and mostly harmless. The main difference is that, in a few months, he won't be decapitated-bird funny. He'll just be ha-ha funny.","How could I know then that this would be my most distinct memory of being a young boy in Ridgewood ...

NYC Ghosts & Flowers,Sonic Youth,by: Brent DiCrescenzo,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a4bc13d1975652138d9a/1:1/w_160/63c49fbc.gif,2000-04-30 05:00:06,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7342-nyc-ghosts-flowers/,Geffen,"No, I have not forgotten to put the numbers into the rating spaces above. In over two years of writing for Pitchfork, I've waited for the one album that would warrant a 0.0-- perhaps even covet the lesser o.o. In my five years of reading Pitchfork, I can only remember a couple of 0.0s, likely spouting from the scalding keyboard of Jason Josephes. Now, finally, my generation has its Metal Machine Music-- an unfathomable album which will be heard in the squash courts and open mic nights of deepest hell. At least Lou Reed had the good grace to keep his mouth shut on his grinding hallmark of pretentious ejaculation. We Chicagoans are stubbornly proud. We shout insults to New York with mouths full of all-beef hot dogs and Old Style beer. This general resentment mostly stems from being dubbed ""The Second City."" However, landmarks like NYC Ghosts & Flowers refocus our dislike with greater alacrity. Sonic Youth's umpteenth album wads everything we hate about New York into one convenient tissue. The only thing missing is the Mets. Sonic Youth remind us that white New Yorkers still grow soul-patches and goatees, wear berets and Rastafarian caps, dine on grilled tofu in an emulsification of goat butter and kumquat, and watch Dutch documentaries about fisting, thinking it's original, intellectual, or influential. These 40+ year olds continue to operate under the perception that they matter. However, one of the prerequisites for being ""experimental"" or ""underground"" is that, down the road, somebody has to be influenced by the work and appropriate elements into the common collective. The minimal noodling on NYC Ghosts & Flowers merely retreads the rancid corpses of beat poetry and avant-garde noise. In a way, Sonic Youth's offenses are no different than, say, the Bloodhound Gang's. Where the Bloodhound Gang push recycled Beastie Boys and ""South Park"" jokes on will-less consumers, Sonic Youth scrap together Yoko Ono, Glenn Branca, and Allen Ginsberg into major label product. But just like living in the Big Apple, you're merely paying more for it. These are not new ideas. These are ideas that were arrogant and unlistenable upon birth 30 years ago. Sonic Youth are even old enough to know that! Thurston Moore stuck the sleeves of John Cage albums into his spokes and Kim Gordon played house with her Kathy Acker action figures. Shockingly, aside from some distorted crescendos on ""Renegade Princess"" and ""Nevermind,"" the volume here is kept at a muted minimum. Flashing and bleating overrules chords. Now neither word in the name ""Sonic Youth"" is apt. A ""song"" might be merely thwacking a bass repeatedly (""side2side"") or rubbing callused fingers over gainless guitar strings (mostly everything else). The horror-score chiming of ""Free City Rhymes"" comes closest to older Sonic Youth-- or at least the worst moments from A Thousand Leaves-- and features the album's only qualified 'singing.' Elsewhere, it's straight spoken word (or in Gordon's case, grunted), the quality of which brings to mind freshman poetry classes where that one Doors worshiper recites beat prose to the general embarrassment of the entire class. Each line is a prime example, but some demand extra warning. For example, Kim Gordon moans (in lowercase): ""boys go to jupiter to get more stupider/ girls go to mars, become rock stars,"" before daring God with the closing, ""strike me down/ strike me down/ with lightning."" Her underwear fascination continues on ""side2side"" with sighs of ""bra"" and ""special/ underwear."" Producer Jim O'Rourke keeps the guitars thin and the electronic bleeps ready in a Hefty sack while Thurston drops his voice into comedic Norse mumbling on ""streamXsonic subway."" In a rushed cadence, he spits cyberpunk mumbo-jumbo like, ""clipped on my streetmatick clogs/ pushed thru the hyped-out fervent fogs/ found my way with sensoid jogs/ new radio structure."" Picture this barked over what sounds like a riding mower running over a line of Tonka trucks. Whoever stole Sonic Youth's equipment, please give it back. Or, perhaps you didn't steal enough. And this being democratic badness, Lee Ranaldo speaks hilarious William S. Burroughs impersonations on the title track. ""Hey did any of you freaks here ever remember Lenny,"" he asks as if wearing a trenchcoat in a opium den. As Chip Chanko pointed out:
Sonic Youth = communism
Daydream Nation = Russian Revolution
Experimental Jet Set = Hunt for Red October So, essentially: an idea that seemed right on paper and in initial, riotous action, but one that has since corroded into a hollow sham. Plus, one could only wish Sonic Youth even approached the sound of Daydream Nation here. Instead, we're left with structures based on toggling the pickup selector on a Fender. The last two lackluster albums at least left beautiful epics like ""Diamond Sea"" and ""Hits of Sunshine,"" but this record merely squirts out electro-duck quacks over nothingness on the opening to ""Lightnin'."" Everything down to the grammar and paintings inside is lamentable. Peppering speech with 'fuck' and typing ""that's whatchoo got crawling in yr panic net"" fails to qualify as inventive or hip these days. Melody and harmony have been banned in Sonic Youth's camp. Merit badges are now awarded for bleeding squeaks from amps and rhyming 'punk' with 'slunk.' A 0.0 is monumental. I have to keep questioning this decision, but the evidence is there. It takes a giant to fall and make this big of a splash. Home movies may be sloppy, but titanic disasters like Hudson Hawk and Bonfire of the Vanities go down in history when even the dam of skill, better judgment, and experience fails to stymie the flood of bile. Sonic Youth seem intent on staying in New York, and Ghosts & Flowers sounds like a conceptual dedication to their home. New York, their mother, should even feel ashamed. Chicago sleeps soundly knowing we didn't produce such an album... doh! Jim O'Rourke! Just move, already!","No, I have not forgotten to put the numbers into the rating spaces above.

Stray Blues: A Collection of B-Sides,Beck,by: Kristin Sage Rockermann,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a24cc0084474cd0bffec/1:1/w_160/447c8426.gif,2000-04-30 05:00:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/616-stray-blues-a-collection-of-b-sides/,DGC,"I hadn't heard that Beck was releasing an eight-song EP of b-sides when I saw Stray Blues in the record store. I was so distracted by the unexpected record and its bad cover art-- a found portrait doctored with psychedelic fluorescent pastels-- that I didn't even notice it was marked $27.50. At first glance, the sketch looks like the work of a bad artist on a bad acid trip. But look more closely... the man represented has a third eye! This is borderline absurd, but Beck takes it to the next level by allowing the third eye to sprout a thought balloon announcing, ""A Collection of B-Sides."" This is funny, right? Kind of, but not funny enough to redeem its hideousness. Don't let new-age chalks of fuchsia irony fool you, this album is expensive. The $30 price tag for eight b-sides of import singles averages out to just under $4 per song. When I paid for it, I asked the cashier if she knew if DGC had plans to reissue it in a package that was less Japanese and less thirty dollars. She didn't know. In my copious research I didn't come across any mention of a domestic release in the near future. So for the time being, the question remains-- are these songs worth $4 each? Let's test out their exchange value together. Come on, when are you really going to wear that mascara, anyway? By the time you get around to using it, it'll be all clumpy. In comparison to annoying gobs of black paint covering your eyelashes, Beck covers Alexander Lee Spence's ""Halo of Gold"" quite smoothly. I haven't heard the original, so I can't comment on Beck's version comparatively, but he's certainly soaked the song in his own style (of that moment)-- the production and overall sound of this 1998 recording is distinctly marked as Mutations-era Beck, complete with sitar, harpsichord-like synths and drug-induced washes of sound under strong choruses. The song works as a lofty platform from which Beck can show off his proclivity for genre-bending pastiche by dropping accents of thin, twangy guitar over dense fuzz-bass. Beck beats Lash-o-lishous. I'll admit that citing this level of specificity in baked-goods could only arise from a considerable passion for fancy olives stuck in bread, but this only serves as an example of the potential satisfaction that can be bought for $4. The stakes are high for these songs! While the bread was baked fresh today, ""Burro"" has been sitting around since 1997. Here, Beck offers his best attempt at lounge-singer vocals (in Spanish) backed by a real Mariachi band. ""Burro"" serves as a Mariachi tribute to Beck's ability to take on musical styles and genres like fellow chameleons Ween, Blur, and Neil Young. It's a reptilian tribute to his postmodern game of dress-up, but it's also a vaguely entertaining throwaway track. If one of your friends performed something like this at a Karaoke bar, you might pay $4 to have a video of your friend hamming it up Mariachi style. You'd probably watch it for a laugh once every five years or so. But Beck isn't my friend, and I don't have a video of this performance. I mean, if a song is going to cost $4, I better want to listen to it more than twice a decade. The kalamata olive loaf wins over ""Burro"". You knew it would. I know what you're thinking: Blockbuster has a two-for-one weekday special, so you'll probably get more than just Dazed and Confused for the price of this track. To level the playing field, I'm going to throw in track five, ""Lemonade"", as part of the deal. These songs were recorded in 1993 and 1994, respectively, and it's clear why they didn't make it onto Mellow Gold. They're pleasant enough listens, but they don't hold their own like ""Soul Suckin Jerk"" or ""Nitemare Hippy Girl"". ""Totally Confused"" lays Beck's raw, slacker-like ruminations atop a melodic, rolling chorus. But ""Lemonade"" trades off contrasting sounds rather than layering them. A primitive pot-clanking rhythm and incoherent percussive vocals give way to shimmery, overproduced pop arrangements. These hard shifts between contrasting styles could be jarring or annoying. Instead, the thumping racket brings out the driving beat under the soft stuff, and the prissy pop confections work to highlight the more melodic elements in the lo-fi noise. Similarly, Dazed and Confused documents style and mood while seeming more like a series of outtakes than a finished artifact. Maybe you want to experience both, but not on a regular basis. It's a draw. Also included are ""Clock"", a track with a distinctly 80s sound that was produced by the Dust Brothers, and a rock ballad called ""Brother"". Beck's guitar work and vocal performance on ""Brother"" recalls White Lion or maybe Poison's softer side, until you listen more carefully to the lyrics which are strangely smart: ""Brother, are you really here/ The package I received is gone/ Are you a phantom detective/ Can you read my soul backwards?/ I would glide with you/ If you are a backwards ghost/ I will hire you."" Stray Blues is a diverse compilation. You could take that as a complement to Beck's stylistic range or as a euphemism for this record's lack of cohesion or theme. But it doesn't try to avoid the word ""compilation""-- it's upfront about the fact that it's a collection of songs and not an album. And the songs are good! However, none of them made it onto Beck's full-length albums for one reason: those records are a lot more than good, and we know Beck can do better than Stray Blues.","I hadn't heard that Beck was releasing an eight-song EP of b-sides when I saw Stray Blues in the ...

Summer Winners/Summer Losers,Bikeride,by: Camilo Arturo Leslie,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a29e5e6ef9596932045f/1:1/w_160/347829a3.gif,2000-04-30 05:00:04,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/692-summer-winnerssummer-losers/,Hidden Agenda,"Pop music is just... great. I mean, think how impoverished our lives would be without buoyant, catchy-as-all-fuck melodies and treacly chord progressions to snap the brow-beating monotony of ""serious,"" ""intelligent"" or (self-)""important"" music. Pop seems to be at its best when it's straightforward, without pretense, gimmicks or aspirations to be something more. And when it works right, song-lovers converge on it like kids on piñata innards. That said, not all pop music is created equal. Oftentimes, it doesn't work at all, and the very fact that it wants to win us over, but can't, is enough to invite our most bitter scorn and derision-- the sort of contempt usually directed at bad pick-up lines, insincere flattery, and clumsy liars. Then there's the so-so stuff. Fountain Valley, California's Bikeride lives right on the periphery of so-so, just across the tracks from ""really good."" Tony Carbone, the principal songwriting force of the group, draws thirstily from the well of 60s pop innovators like Brian Wilson, Burt Bacharach, The Beatles, et al. But who hasn't? There are two perils inherent in this strategy: Pulling 60s tricks in 2001 isn't interesting anymore, it's just retro. And second, the old guys did it best. So, toeing the nostalgic line, as Bikeride do, is always an iffy, hit-or-miss stunt; either you do the tradition proud or you bellyflop. Summer Winners/Summer Losers, true to its title, has a lot of both. As well it should, I guess, considering that it's not a regular LP, but a compilation of several old EP tracks, previous unreleased songs, and LP bonus tracks heretofore only available on Japanese releases. Perhaps terms like ""cohesiveness"" and ""flow"" have little or no place in the discussion of compilations, but borrowing as it does from many of their previous releases, Summer Winners/Summer Losers is a convenient place from which to judge Bikeride's work as whole. Bikeride completists (all four of you) are going to buy this no matter what. For the rest of us, a little history is in order: Carbone and friends started the group at Loyola Marymount University. They've since released two full-lengths (1997's Here Comes the Summer and 1999's Thirty-Seven Secrets I Only Told America), as well as the Dogs EP, the America's Favorite Omelettes EP, and the Raspet EP. This record's opener, ""Here Comes Summer"", is its only previously unreleased song, and an odd choice for a lead-off; of all Summer Winner's 19 tracks, it's the least representative of their work. Fuzzy, delayed guitar chords and a driving beat lay the foundation for a chorus of harmonizing voices singing about, um, the coming of summer. The song boasts some gorgeous chord changes during the bridge, but the overall feel is spoiled by the unnecessary addition of a violin playing a Middle-Eastern scale over the otherwise standard pop progression. Before long, we're introduced to ""Meghan"" and ""Leah & Nikki"", both mid-tempo, California-style pop songs with flute melodies, tambourine, harmonica, and lyrics about-- you got it-- summer. ""New Year's Girl"", originally from the Raspet EP, brings a welcome shift. If The Cars had been a 60s band with Moog synths, they might have sounded like this. (Sorry, Ric.) Which brings us to ""Carl Wilson Suite"", which simply switches between torpid, strummy verses and garish choruses that sound kind of like old Neil Diamond. ""You Stepped on My Guitar"" is a less-than-half-baked idea that should never have seen plastic. Illustrating how fish-out-of-water these guys sound attempting to ""rock out,"" the song features annoyingly twee lyrics (""you hurt my baby [guitar]""). ""Shawna"", meanwhile, puts lyrics to a Casio keyboard demo song: In a word, awful. ""Continental Divide"" sounds brilliant in comparison. At the risk of wearing out my bad musical hybrid license, imagine old Billy Joel covered by David Bowie trying to sound reggae-ish. Odd, but curiously enough, not all that bad. It's not until the tenth track, however, that we get an actual good song. ""Fine and Dandy"" is less than two minutes in length, but is among the best Summer Winners has to offer. Folky guitar, pitter-patter drums, and Carbone utilizing Dylan-esque vocal techniques make for a successful and rare moment of peace and quiet in a compilation littered with frenetically ""cute"" odes to voices and styles long dead. ""A Summer Song"", the first of two covers, reprises the early 60s bubblegum classic, and peddling quickly behind is ""Handlebars"", the easy pick for the album's best track. Here, the songwriting is strikingly similar to that of Blanket's Chad Crouch, with sparse, delicate chords, and even toy piano toward the end. And yet another surprise comes with the sing-songy ""Country Driving"", which boasts great harmonies and bluegrass licks on clean-toned Fender guitars. ""The Four of Us in June"" is the saddest, prettiest cut, but only lasts a little over a minute. Nice use of church bells, though. ""Endless PCH"", meanwhile, serves only to reaffirm Bikeride's so-so tendencies.

The Proximity Effect,Nada Surf,by: Ryan Kearney,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c38aea9e61561daa7f49/1:1/w_160/9e37591b.gif,2000-04-30 05:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5692-the-proximity-effect/,ElektraElektra,"Just as virtually every review of Beck's Odelay began by mentioning ""Loser"", so, too, must this review address Nada Surf's MTV hit, ""Popular"", from their 1996 debut, High/Low. Of course, Beck's Mellow Gold was a much more promising debut, and he's since recorded five mostly outstanding records that have more than disproved the one-hit wonder status initially bestowed upon him. Nada Surf, on the other hand, have only made The Proximity Effect since their first record. Needless to say, their fate is still up in the air. I remember the cheerleaders in the ""Popular"" video, but to be honest, I don't remember the song very well. I think the verses were talky, and then there was that catchy, ironic chorus. I don't remember the rest of it. So, even as far as hits by sweater-wearers go, it wasn't nearly as memorable as ""Loser"". Nada Surf actually completed The Proximity Effect in 1998, whereupon it was released in Europe, supposedly ""selling briskly and garnering critical acclaim"" (this according to the press release; I guess I'll take their word for it). But after it tanked in the U.S., Elektra wasted no time dropping them. Nada Surf eventually regained the rights and have now released it on Mardev, their new self-run label. The Proximity Effect opens interestingly enough, with a guitar somehow manipulated to resemble bagpipes and quick drums like a skipped heartbeat. But ""Hyperspace"" quickly delves into uninspired driving pop-rock à la the Foo Fighters. Aside from the notes in his higher register, which sound like Brian Wilson on speed (rather than on, say, anti-depressants), singer/guitarist Matthew Caws' voice is pretty unexceptional. Think Weezer's Rivers Cuomo, but with limited inflection and without defining characteristics-- a particularly apt comparison, given that most of Nada Surf's music recalls Weezer's early work. The following number, ""Amateur"", is one such song that makes it impossible to ignore the Weezer influence. With decent hooks and spontaneous drums, Nada Surf seals the comparison with self-doubting lyrics that scream, ""Hey, look at me-- I'm ironic and messed up!"" Delivering his lines in a cavalier, ""Buddy Holly"" sort of way, Caws sings, ""You said I should get professional help/ It always makes me cry/ I know I'm just an amateur/ But I've gotta try."" ""80 Windows"" shows some potential, though. Relying on a slower, more reflective mood, the song glides along like a pick-up on a country road. It's pleasant enough until Caws delivers the central lines, ""The moon is closer to the sun than I am to anyone."" When I first heard it, I wasn't sure whether to laugh or cry. In a bad way. The same problems plague the rest of the album. ""Bacardi"" is another decent, introspective number, but it's about someone getting drunk on Bacardi and watching The Late Show. Employing handclaps to encourage the listener, ""Bad Best Friend"" would have a certain sing-along quality if... well, just look at the title, for Christ's sake! And snatching its opening riff from Nirvana's ""Stay Away"", ""Dispossession"" features addictive, manipulated background vocals that give the song an interstellar, searing quality. But without being clever or intentionally funny, Caws talks (not sings: remember ""Popular""?) about leaving behind his coat and belt and not wanting them back. Weezer are a prime example of how maudlin and ironic pop music can move a music snob to dance and mope without guilt. And while not as sharp, curvy, or ensnaring as Weezer's, Nada Surf's hooks would suffice if not for unavoidably sub-par lyrics. They wear their hearts on their sleeves while also addressing the banality of human emotions and actions, but do so without the inventiveness to ensure that the songs will bounce around my head a week from now.","Just as virtually every review of Beck's Odelay began by mentioning\n\ ""Loser"", so, too, must this review address ...

Paul D. Miller (aka DJ Spooky) investigates how it is that anyone can understand anyone else, how language works and how we frame our world; Robin Rimbaud (aka Scanner) eavesdrops on cellphone communications and reconfigures the recorded conversations into art installations. So you'd expect a collaboration between these two receivers to be lengthy, abstract, and probably academic to some degree. Luckily, you'd be wrong. This soundclash isn't featherweight, either; both parties have reined in their tendencies to enter into discourse and predication, and instead concentrated on substantial illbient grooves. Of course, Spooky can't resist dropping in a few ounces of meta-hip-hop and Scanner lets us sneak a listen to someone's lurid phonecall, but by and large, The Quick and the Dead is a chat between old friends rather than a rambling sermon. Beginning with low-end frequencies and the gurgling sounds of a industrial-sized bong (""Journey""), the pair invite Freight Elevator Quartet cellist Rachael Finn to play on ""Guanxi"", framing her pizzicato snaps in a very Durrutti Column setting. ""Ngugi"" rattles and shakes on strange percussion and sirocco breezes, before a Thomas Köner-like ground wobbles and distorts the foundations. ""Synchronism 2"" recalls early Wordsound releases like Dubadelic's Bass Invaders with its dub-cavern bass and crumpled, collapsed keyboard stabs. Here, it's hard to tell who's influencing who-- unlike some collaborations, The Quick and the Dead is a true fusing of talents as opposed to a convenient marketing ploy (selling two artists on the same disc to sell twice as many copies) or a call-and-response routine (like Scanner's collaboration with Signs ov Chaos). The Quick and the Dead is the first in Sulfur's Meld series and, if the consistency and relevance of this debut are maintained, this series should be as vital as Fatcat's Split 1-8 series. Miller and Rimbaud have kept to-the-point and chosen not to waste words. So following their shining example, I won't either: Purchase with confidence.","DJ Spooky and Scanner are both gabber about communication. Paul D. Miller (aka DJ Spooky)\n\ investigates how it is ...

White Pepper,Ween,by: Matt LeMay,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a9e7c0084474cd0c10eb/1:1/w_160/258d296a.gif,2000-04-30 05:00:01,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8604-white-pepper/,Elektra,"White Pepper. It took me a while to get it. It wasn't until I opened up Ween's latest album and saw the insert, with one side whitewashed and the other covered in multicolored peppers, that I began to dissect the album's name, and eventually came upon my epiphany. ""White Pepper. White. Pepper. White Album! Sgt. Pepper! White Pepper! Shit!"" Either I'm reading way too much into this album's title, or Gene and Dean have spliced together the names of two of the greatest albums ever into a spicy, yet seemingly benign title. Right now, you are either seething with rage or chortling with glee. It all depends on whether or not you've actually heard this record. If you haven't heard the record, you probably fall into the former category. ""What's that!"" you say, ""how dare a band compare itself to the greatest single rock and roll band ever! Gene and Dean are blasphemers! Death to them! Death I say!"" Well, settle down. That was my initial reaction, too. But as I listened to the record more and more, I began to see just how clever this album's title is. For the record, this album does not sound like the Beatles, with the exception of maybe a few tracks. White Pepper's similarity to the Beatles lies not in its sound, but rather in its execution. White Pepper bears a much stronger resemblance to the first half of its moniker than to the second. The White Album covered all points on the stylistic map. Play it through once, and you can find the origins of almost every major modern musical style in at least one track; even with all the stylistic curveballs, though, it still sounded like a Beatles record. White Pepper continues Ween's quest to prove that they can cover just about any style of music with impeccable wit and accuracy. Like the White Album, White Pepper lacks the cohesiveness of earlier works, but it also demonstrates how a band can undergo some serious genre-bending, while still retaining a sound that is uniquely theirs. The first thing you'll probably notice about White Pepper is that, for the first time ever, Ween sounds like an entire band. While The Mollusk merely hinted at a bigger, fuller sound, White Pepper serves as the Do the Collapse to The Mollusk's Mag Earwhig!. Except good. But despite the new hi-fi sound, which is due in no small part to the presence of Gene's and Dean's touring band on the album, White Pepper is unquestionably Ween. Gene's unmistakable voice and impeccable sense of melody come off sounding even better than they did back in the days of 4-track recording. And Dean's guitar work is at its most versatile and enjoyable, ranging from jazz licks on ""Pandy Fackler,"" a song about a retarded girl who ""sucks dick under the promenade,"" to flamenco guitar on ""Bananas and Blow."" White Pepper kicks off with ""Exactly Where I'm At,"" a rocking, if overly repetitive song featuring some classic psychedelic Dean Ween soloing. ""Exactly Where I'm At"" is rivaled in its arena-rocking status only by ""Back to Basom,"" a thoroughly fucked-up power ballad about smiling waste, and dancers with lost legs. Or at least I think that's what it's about. ""Even if you Don't,"" one of the two tracks on White Pepper that sound remotely like the Beatles, is a charming McCartney-esque piano-driven tune. But Ween finds itself at its most Beatlesque on ""Ice Castles,"" a wobbly Strawberry Fields-ish instrumental that was originally titled simply ""Baroque Jam."" Unfortunately, White Pepper is a bit of a disappointment as compared to The Mollusk. First of all, a few tracks, like the hard rocking ""Stroker Ace,"" just don't hold up with the rest of the album. And while many of the tracks are quite excellent, none of them approach the sheer brilliance of songs like ""The Mollusk"" or ""Buckingham Green."" Its lack of thematic consistency renders White Pepper incapable of making any vast statement such as The Mollusk did. And, let's face it, the lack of profanity, including the complete absence of the word ""fuck,"" renders it incapable of being as funny as early Ween faves like ""She Fucks Me,"" and the ever-popular ""LMLYP."" Still, White Pepper is hardly a step back for Gene and Dean. More like a lateral. Ween has taken on 70's prog, Prince, country, and now arena rock. And they've managed to do all of it well. So what does the future hold for Ween? Who knows. Maybe they'll take on techno. When ""Everything is Beyond the Ultraworld"" comes out, I'll buy it.","White Pepper. It took me a while to get it.

XTRMNTR,Primal Scream,by: Brent DiCrescenzo,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a12fc0084474cd0bfd53/1:1/w_160/15377e58.jpg,2000-04-30 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6474-xtrmntr/,Astralwerks,"The instruments of war have always been percussion. I'm not referring to tanks, battlerams and firearms, but musical instruments. Granted, the incessant thunder and crack of explosives is percussive, albeit erratic. The quick history lesson on the Bicentennial quarter reminds us that suckers with snares kept the beat of destruction. Tolkien's trolls thumped skin timpanis. Genghis had gongs. War has rhythm. I was reminded of this at the two most exhilarating concerts I've seen. Last weekend, a pogo bacchanal erupted in a cramped club. Clothes were shed and azzes were backed up on an altar with a $6 cover. Six months ago, a crowd stomped dust and flicked cigarette ash off the floor of Chicago's Metro as three drummers locked into a primal groove. Revolution starts with a dance that the stuttering chugs of guitar can't provide. Funk, not volume, pulls people to the streets. Primal Scream have always understood the power of a groove and a lyrical grenade. Their entire career reaches a melting point on the raw, caustic XTRMNTR. With this album, Primal Scream point their finger at multinationals and conservatives, and forewarn the fate of Pentheus. XTRMNTR's sound lies somewhere between the kraut-loving Chemical Brothers and latter-era Fugazi. Recent recruits Mani from the Stone Roses and Kevin Shields of My Bloody Valentine up the ante. Mani's gritty, nasty basslines form the coral of Primal Scream's gunmetal grey and apocalyptic orange reef. The title track bounces guitar freakout sparks across congealed grease of bass. ""Swastika Eyes"" races on high-velocity loops like the soundtrack to a behemoth final boss in a spaceshooter video game. Primal frontman Bobby Gillespie seems to see himself as the little ""Gradius"" ship facing the myriad-howitzer monster of the WTO, NATO, and whatever other ""The Man"" organization you can name. XTRMNTR's lyrics are sparse and terse, but Gillespie spits bullets like, ""You've got the money, I've got the soul,"" and, ""Tell you the truth/ The truth about you/ The truth about you?/ You've been true."" Even when his delivery is awkward (i.e. like an aging white Brit trying to flow, as in the former examples), it's barked as if sincerity has locked his jaw like rabies. It's hard to disagree with sentiments like ""Kill All Hippies."" Even the music mirrors the anti-superfluidity, anti-nostalgic, anti-bucolicness, anti-bathos lyrics. The vehicle is stripped and the skeleton spiked. Like the vowel-less title on the cover, XTRMNTR is all corners and crunch. Typically, electronic-rock fusion falls flat for smelling too much like silicon and solder. XTRMNTR defies such classification thanks to the brilliance of Kevin Shields. This is the man who crafted one of the most sonically incredible records of all time, and his work here proves his skills have not diminished. ""MBV Arkestra"" drifts in hypnotic rhythms. Shields mixes countless tracks of accelerated drums into a thick snakecharm. Layer upon layer of sandstorm guitars and horns sweep over the shifting dunes of beats. The song feels like a drugged-up rush through a packed Punjabi streetmarket. People, it's My Bloody Valentine! On ""Accelerator"" Shields pushes the volume to an exploding point like gravity pulling an MC5 song back into the atmosphere. White flames flare off charred drums as strings turn to magma. Elsewhere, his influence is felt, like on the wargame instrumentals of ""Blood Money"" and ""Shoot Speed/Kill Light"". The album has its shortcomings. ""Keep Your Faith"" and ""Insect Royalty"" dip a bit too much into the more sentimental song-based style of the last record, Vanishing Point, and ""Swastika Eyes"" needs no reprise. But the fighting spirit keeps Primal Scream ahead of the pack. Gillespie now sports post-lice hair and mysterious face scratches. He's a battered veteran who's making up for some horrible moments in the past. Rest assured, Rod Stewart will not be able to cover anything from XTRMNTR. Some still sadly associate Primal Scream with their baggy rock days. Yet few other bands evolve this deep into their career, let alone care. At some point in the mid-90s, Primal Scream woke up and realized they'd made a mistake. Their new political agenda digests much easier than bands like Rage Against the Machine who market their entire career off such stances. In the end, Primal Scream understood that under all of the rants there has to lie a steady throb of rump-shaking war.","The instruments of war have always been percussion.

Professor: The basic crutch of the critic is simple comparison. It is uninspired, yet inevitable. The easiest way to describe band B [The Professor scribbles ""B"" on an overhead projector] is to compare Z to bands X and Y [""Y"" and ""X"" are similarly scrawled]. Now, the juxtaposition of X and Y are an immediate indication to the quality of band B. Now, let's assume the difference between bands X and Y-- whether it be through genre or quality or time or geography-- is D. Graphing /D/ with the X axis being D and the Y axis being the resulting rating, or opinion, of the critic, what you have is a typical parabola. [The Professor scribbles crossing perpendicular lines with a giant ""U"" passing through the axis.] As D, the difference between X and Y, increases, so, too, does the critic's love or hate of the record increase... Boy: So, wait, Professor... Professor: Yes? Boy: So, like, the bands X and Y, are they like the x and y axis of the graph? Professor: No, I just coincidentally happened to name the variable bands ""X"" and ""Y."" Boy: Oh, so it's the 20th century punk band from California, X, and the '40s one-hit wonder, Y, who had that big song, like, ""Y U B Treatin' Me B. A. D.?"" You're comparing those two bands? Professor: No, it's not that either. They're just variables. But it could, conceivably be those bands. Now, please, if I may continue I can clear this up. For example, let's say you're reviewing the new record by the Wickets. Now if you write that the Wickets sound like a cross between Sepultura and Joan Armatrading, the reader infers that album is either very good or very bad. Other examples would be, say, a cross between Kanda Bongo Man and Uriah Heep. This is how you express a band's originality through juxtaposition. Conversely, saying band B sounds like a cross between NOFX and Blink 182 isn't an endorsement. Even when press kits say ""sounds like a cross between the Beach Boys and Beatles,"" it's typically a dead ringer for some rancid indie pop. Now... Girl: Professor Wisdom? What happens if two bands actually do come together to form a new band? Professor: Hmm, an interesting hypothesis, but of little concern. Such things do not happen. Girl: Actually, Professor, I was digging through the archive in the library and I found a review by DiCrescenzo... Class: ... [A reverent moment of silence.] Girl: ...dating from 2000. It's an album by Macha and Bedhead. A collaboration. Professor: Interesting. What did he have to say? Girl: He said it sounded ""like a cross between Macha and Bedhead."" Professor: Hmm. A rather unmotivated moment in his career. Girl: Quite. It's not even ironic. Anyway, he says tracks two and three-- ""Never Underdose"" and ""You and New Plastic""-- sound more like Bedhead where as tracks 1 and 4-- ""Hey Goodbye"" and ""Only the Bodies Survive""-- the album's best, borrow more from Macha's work. The last track is a Cher cover. ""'Hey Goodbye' sounds like a cross between Radiohead and Indonesian shoegazer,"" an obvious positive remark according to your system. Indonesian shoegazer doesn't even exist. And the obligatory Radiohead reference, although overused, makes sense. ""Floods of zither and dulcimer rush up in the choruses,"" he continues. ""Yet the exotic instruments are used more as enriching texture. On Macha's solo releases, the Indonesian din wafts third world ambiance as if guitar necks, dulcimer hammer, and drumsticks were slowly burning incense sticks. Yet, mulched upon Bedhead's sandman strumming, the effect is more ambiguously alien-- disconnected from images of eight-armed gods, woven rugs, and brass merchants. 'Sesame Street' writers and puppets weep as co-operation peaks in efficiency. Bedhead's beauty breathes more bizarrely, while Macha's fog slows to intoxicating speeds. Both groups operate in the ethereal realm, and as music approaches its gaseous state, bonding becomes accelerated."" Professor: That presents a completely different scenario. I was assuming this on a solid state. Ah, yes, but how different were Macha and Bedhead? How big is D? Little insight can be spilled on our dilemma without knowing this difference. Boy: I believe it was 24 decibels. Professor: A-ha. Therefore, we'll plug that into our equation, and we get... 7.9.

There's the first song that grabs your attention and seizes the imagination, the first album that demonstrates such overall strength and originality that it becomes something more for most listeners, just as there is the first kiss that awakens the soul and forever changes the vision. I admit without qualm that it began for me with Animals. My brother was in college, and one day I went through his records and listened to the ones with the coolest covers. Animals fascinated me then as it still fascinates me today. It is the acute anthropomorphic fantasy, possessing a timeless quality that has thrust it into the category of ""classic,"" though it may remain forever in the shadow of its more commercially successful older brother, Dark Side Of The Moon. Consisting of three tracks each longer than ten minutes and two tracks under two minutes, Animals is not for the attention- span- deficient. However, within this impenetrable fortress of radio- unfriendly tracks, we hear Dave Gilmour's guitars at their absolute best, get a full-on dose of Roger Waters' powerful lyrical imagery, and are presented with the worst elements of our own humanity- packaged in the skins of ""Sheep,"" ""Dogs"" and ""Pigs (Three Different Ones)"". For those weaned on The Wall and Dark Side, you'll find Animals to be a whole new bag of feed. Where Floyd's two most recognizable albums made their mark with operatic aggression and fear, Animals deals in dirt- under- the- fingernails reality, the common smallness that simultaneously binds and repels us all.

You'll get the chance to put the knife in.

If a band merely fills the studio molds with too-perfect clarity, fans want for the lack of stage improv. If the band jams on the closing riff for six minutes, the fans yawn. So what's the perfect balance of fiddling and play-by-numbers? If you've ever exclaimed, ""Man, the guitarist adds a little vibrato to the one note in the hook! And the riff has this little extra stutter,"" ask yourself why this really matters. Do five subtle changes really warrant praise? And if it's freeform re-interpretation you want, go like Phish."" The above sentiments appeared verbatim in Brent DiCrescenzo's review of Built to Spill's Live. They also appeared in his review of Sunny Day Real Estate's Live. Now I'm using them for my own purposes because this Posies album is also live and he used it twice so it must mean something. This record's not called Live, though. I bet you gathered that from the information up there at the top. Did you? If you did, then you also saw that it says stuff about icebergs and being alive. Yeah, this is a postmortem release capturing the Posies at what they consider to be their greatest moment before sinking (and resurfacing in places like Big Star, Sunny Day Real Estate and Fountains of Wayne). Alive Before the Iceberg was recorded in Barcelona on a July night in 1998. Judging from guitarist Ken Stringfellow's liner notes, the Posies seemed to, uh, like playing in Spain. From what I gather (actually, he spells it out in lurid detail) they drank a lot, passed out a lot, woke up not knowing where they were a lot, and Fucking Rocked a lot. The Posies did this? But they do such nice harmonies! My mom likes them! (She doesn't really, but I bet she would). They fucking rocked?! They did. And maybe that's their point with this release: ""Listen up people, we fucking rocked! It's all right there. Listen you assholes!"" Jon Auer and Ken Stringfellow's harmonies are belted out like they're playing Giants' Stadium without mics as they try to stay in tune and presumably, stay standing. The guitar is all over the place while keeping to the confines of each song. There's no unnecessary soloing on the tracks, which combine songs from the band's last three albums and a gut-punching cover of Cheap Trick's ""Surrender."" Recorded before the release of Success, it ""premiers"" songs from that album; the perfect opener (here and on Success), ""Somehow Everything,"" the cyclic guitar triplets of ""Start a Life,"" and the mesmerizing grandfather clock harmonies on ""You're the Beautiful One"" are captured in a previously undocumented state. Iceberg pulls mostly from the Posies' 1996 album, Amazing Disgrace, with a light-speed rendition of ""Grant Hart"" splitting the set in two and leading straight into an equally energized ""Flavour of the Month."" Iceberg's track listing largely serves as a selection of some of the band's better lesser-known songs (despite the inclusion of their restrained hit ""Dream all Day"") and as a sign of the Posies' impending destruction. Before the chain-gang staccato guitars of ""Broken Record,"" Auer announces, ""Maybe you can get off the damn dance floor for this one."" I can just picture a crowd in front of the stage taking that as an invitation to pound a giant crater into the floor. I think that's what he pictured, too. The band knew exactly what they were doing, even then. They knew they were close to the end and that's what they captured here. Alive Before the Iceberg is the Posies summing up their career up with 12 songs played half-drunk in front of a crowd of Spaniards who probably didn't know that a posie is a bunch of flowers. It didn't matter. What mattered to them was the moment-- the energy of a band wound so tight they would explode later that year. They didn't care about freeform re-interpretation here, and I didn't either.

Good Looking Blues,Laika,by: Zach Hooker,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc77eb335119a49ecc8d/1:1/w_160/513614fc.gif,2000-04-18 05:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4641-good-looking-blues/,Beggars BanquetToo PureBeggars BanquetToo Pure,"To some-- the hip, the jaded-- Laika's third release is likely to seem a bit of a disappointment. And in a way, I guess it is: after the sonic barrage of their first album, its two successors may seem a bit dry. In fact, by some standards, Laika have gone downhill not just since their first album, but since the first 20 seconds of their first album, which were arguably 20 of the most exciting seconds electronic music produced in the 1990s. Consider, for example, the generally shoddy treatment Stereolab has recieved from hipsters regarding their post-Emperor Tomato Ketchup LPs. The thing of it is, see, that the phenomenon known as electronic music-- half music and three halves public relations-- has always set itself up as The Future. The Future, of course, is always one step ahead, and this has led to the development of a freakishly malproportioned set of criteria by which electronic music is to be judged: one which values innovation above all other things. Constantly striving to push the envelope (in order to push the product, naturally), electronic music plunges blindly ahead into what so many fawning reviews refer to as ""uncharted territory."" This is all fine and good, except for one thing: left behind in the neverending move forward lie vast expanses of half, sorta and barely charted territory. Few blues singers are criticized for lack of innovation-- they're instead evaluated on their musicianship, songwriting and knowledge of their craft. Meanwhile, electronic music's mainstream has been largely unable to value itself as a tradition to the extent that artists are allowed to explore the nooks and crannies of their own genre. When an album like Good Looking Blues is released-- one that moves towards accessibility-- the general reaction tends towards dismissals of the ""I've heard this before"" or ""Nothing new here"" variety. Admittedly, Good Looking Blues doesn't seem like much at first-- pretty run-of-the-mill trip-hoppy shit: some loops here, some scratching there, a dash of hip-hop for flavor, shrinkwrap it and call it a day. Certainly, it's nothing like the grinding and irresistible Silver Apples of the Moon. But as bands like Stereolab have proven, a sheen of accessibility can conceal a wealth of texture, and Good Looking Blues more than makes up for its lack of originality with plenty of detail and craft. While generally more song-oriented than previous outings, Good Looking Blues is built on a foundation of acid-jazzy, polyrythmic beats-- the kind that just seem to shuffle along until you pay attention to them, at which point they prove to be more layered than Barthes' S/Z. Organic texture is provided throughout by such unhip instruments as the bass clarinet, the trumpet and the flute. Margaret Fiedler's vocals are much further up in the mix than on past releases. This is a welcome thing for the most part, though at points you may wish you could gloss over the lyrics: the opening ""Black Cat Bone"" in particular, whose stilted rap is basically Blondie's ""Rapture"" updated for the new millenium. Still, Good Looking Blues shows a Laika that has learned from its past mistakes-- they don't get lost in their own loops like they used to-- and willing to stretch out and explore their surroundings. I'd gladly see electronic music lose its innovation if it meant more music like this album's creepily sublime title track or the quiet Reichian beauty of ""A Single Word."" Of course, the hipsters would never stand for it.","To some-- the hip, the jaded-- Laika's third release is likely to seem a bit of a disappointment. And ...

Live,Built to Spill,by: Brent DiCrescenzo,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a29c5e6ef9596932045a/1:1/w_160/41b7dd62.gif,2000-04-18 05:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1013-live/,,"Live albums always offer a precarious task for musicians. If a band merely fills the studio molds with too-perfect clarity, fans want for the lack of stage improv. If the band jams on the closing riff for six minutes, the fans yawn. So what's the perfect balance of fiddling and play-by-numbers? If you've ever exclaimed, ""Man, the guitarist adds a little vibrato to the one note in the hook! And the riff has this little extra stutter,"" ask yourself why this really matters. Do five subtle changes really warrant praise? And if it's freeform re-interpretation you want, go like Phish. The above sentiments appeared verbatim in my review of Sunny Day Real Estate's Live. You can argue that I'm lazy, or that I'm filling a contractual obligation to the Editor, or that I'm pleasing more of my diehard fans by re-offering some classic prose riffs. The truth is, that's how I view live albums. Well, actually, I'd like to improv on that paragraph a bit. You can't spell ""improve"" without ""improv."" Oh dear, that was unfunny, unnecessary banter. But I'm dictating this review live. Built to Spill's live album, aside from its uninspired title, restores purpose and value in the format. Primarily because Built to Spill restore purpose and invention to the guitar. On their 1997 album, Perfect from Now On, Built to Spill's slave fingers stacked slabs of reverb and bricks of glitter-dipped notes into a Record of Babel under the whipping brilliance of Doug Martsch's mind. Keep It Like a Secret chopped up the anthemic architecture into more livable suburban models. While other bands like Radiohead and Sunny Day Real Estate carved majestic epics, nobody else truly used the sheer volume and sparkling colors of jacked amps. Built to Spill weld Television-esque interplay to the head-melting swirl of Spiritualized or Spacemen 3. That Martsch can turn such fireworks into acute hooks is genius. Live smartly pulls primarily from the two recent LPs. The universally held favorite, ""Car,"" makes a welcome appearance-- the first live recording of the band's best song with their best line-up. Caustic Resin's Brett Nelson sprays vapor trails over half of the album, upping the fist-pumping factor to three behemoth guitars. These nine songs provide an idol for guitar fans who sicken at the sound of dancing solos. This is slow motion synchronized gymnastics, not a tap recital. Doug Martsch worships the guitar. He was born to play 19 minute scorches. There's Nothing Wrong with Love seems plainly cute in hindsight. Other Northwest bands scratch the itch for high-pitched pop nuggets-- Quasi and Elliott Smith will serve you. Built to Spill, and especially their live album, are for people who want to air windmill, air-strum, air-riff, air-solo, and air-drum without the guilt of actually listening to classic rock.","Live albums always offer a precarious task for musicians.

Pastoral Composure,Matthew Shipp,by: Matt LeMay,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a3d39d034d5c69bf2efe/1:1/w_160/b2c0af61.gif,2000-04-18 05:00:01,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7115-pastoral-composure/,Thirsty Ear,"Every time I receive a shipment of CDs from Pitchfork International Headquarters, I make a point of separating the discs into two piles: one marked ""sooner"" and the other marked ""later."" The more straightforward rock discs usually get marked ""sooner."" And in general, the first impressions of these albums don't lie-- after about 4-6 listens, I've pretty much made up my mind. Jazzy, electronic, and ambient discs often get marked ""later"" because they're generally more difficult to evaluate. It can sometimes take a few good weeks of listening to distill all the musical complexities into a two-digit rating. Jazz pianist Matthew Shipp's latest, Pastoral Composure, easily secured itself a place in the ""later"" pile. I was expecting the album to be typical of today's avant-jazz scene: rewarding, yet difficult to decipher. But as Shipp, horn player Roy Campbell, bassist William Parker, and drummer Gerald Cleaver made their way through seven of Shipp's originals and two covers, my excitement grew. This, folks, is everything a jazz record should be. It's remarkably complex and musically proficient, yet instantly accessible, and a keeper in every respect. Pastoral Composure seamlessly blurs the line between traditional and avant-jazz. On his cover of ""Prelude to a Kiss,"" Shipp alternates between a smooth rendition of the Ellington classic and violent, claustrophobic bursts of atonal piano. In doing so, Shipp manages to combine the expressiveness of avant-jazz's hyper-emotional blasts with the melodic sense of classic jazz. The benefits of this fusion come through equally clearly in the quartet's schizophrenic take on ""Frère Jaques,"" which frequently breaks down into blasts of orgasmic horns, plunking bass, and thumping piano. Undoubtedly, all four members of this quartet are amazingly proficient players. But even when a song collapses into a more improvisational bit, there's always just enough structure to hold the piece together. Thirsty Ear released Pastoral Composure as part of their ""Blue Series,"" a procession of recordings designed to ""[Marry] jazz's many languages... in a way that will hopefully challenge, probe, excite, and perhaps even anger listeners."" While this is perhaps an overly bombastic statement, Shipp has, remarkably, come awfully close to pulling it off. That Shipp manages to walk the line between intensity and dissonance without sacrificing the accessibility of the music is an even greater achievement. Pastoral Composure plays out like a well-written history of jazz. Traces of everything from Duke Ellington to Miles Davis to more recent jazz innovators like Peter Brotzmann and Evan Parker echo throughout. And the fact that the album will only cost you a measly $11.19-- a good $38.81 less than The New Grove History of Jazz-- is an added bonus.","Every time I receive a shipment of CDs from Pitchfork International Headquarters, I make a point of separating\n\ the ...

Rock Star God,Makers,by: Al Shipley,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c37b13d197565213bd3c/1:1/w_160/21291839.gif,2000-04-18 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5056-rock-star-god/,Sub PopSub Pop,"Setting: Backstage of a small rock venue somewhere in the northwest United States. The clock approaches midnight as the players prepare for the concert. The curtain rises; a roaring noise is heard from the stage. Suddenly, the noise stops, as the club fills with smoke. A crowd of well-dressed men and women have gathered for the ceremony. The singer screams out to the audience and the band begins to play. If you can get past this ridiculous monologue which opens the Makers' Rock Star God without cringing or laughing, then good for you-- you're ready to rock. Sadly, the band isn't. The track that immediately follows ""Intro (Ladies and Gentlemen)"" is not the blistering anthem that the introduction longs to prime the listener for. ""Star Power"" opens with undistorted guitar, cello, and-- of all things-- piano. For a brief moment, it appears promising, an unexpected moment that actually sounds pretty good. But soon, the song devolves into limp Rocky Horror Picture Show revivalism. This doesn't look promising. What's in a name? Well, when it comes to stage names, a large degree of significance can be imbued to a moniker. When the Makers started out, the members took Maker as their respective surnames, a la the Ramones (or, more recently, the Donnas). And it made sense, playing simplistic garage rock, clad in black leather and sunglasses. Then, on 1998's Psychopathia Sexualis, the Makers adopted goofy names like Michael Machine and Jay Amerika to fit their new glam image. But the rebirth of glam had come and gone with the art-house disaster Velvet Goldmine. And that these guys were merely no-name indie rockers attempting arena antics instantly rendered their gimmick ridiculous. Now, with Rock Star God, the Makers take an overt stab at authenticity by-- for the first time in their history-- embracing their real names. Clocking in at nearly an hour with 16 tracks, Rock Star God simply begs to be described as ""epic,"" but comes nowhere near such a venerating adjective. It's one of those albums with liner notes boasting all kinds of auxiliary instruments; clarinet, marimba, timpani, harmonica. Yet, when you actually listen to the record, these additional textures scarcely show themselves. The bulk of the tracks feature straightforward acoustic guitars and plinking piano, and everything else gets buried in the mix (although ""I'm a Concrete Wall"" does sport some nice junkyard percussion sounds). The problem with a band like the Makers is that they think that variety and versatility come from aping several different bands instead of just one. Their opening chords make each influence instantly recognizable: plenty of T. Rex and Stones, plus the occasional touch of the Who and Big Star, just as plainly and unimaginatively as the press material dictates. The thing is, it's still evident that the Makers have talent and prowess on their side, and possibly even some untouched creativity. Someday, they may abondon their clichés, backup singers, sunglasses, and pouty poses, and manage to make something moderately compelling and original. But I wouldn't count on it.","Setting: Backstage of a small rock venue somewhere in the northwest United States.\n\ The clock approaches midnight as the ...

The Embassy Tapes,Nation of Ulysses,by: Camilo Arturo Leslie,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c3a713d197565213bd9c/1:1/w_160/3caf32c0.gif,2000-04-15 06:01:40,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5716-the-embassy-tapes/,DischordDischord,"During and after the Seattle WTO riots, you may have noticed the sinister dearth of coverage the main media outlets allotted to the events. If you paid attention to the little that was aired, or if you sought the news out elsewhere, you would have also noticed that just about everybody-- from indifferent Joe Blow on the street, to the international business titans in attendance, as well the ever-present morass of punditry-- everybody was able to arrive at a happy accord on one point. Namely, that the amorphous thing vaguely referred to as ""the radical left"" is too directionless, clamorous, adolescent, and by implication, idealistic to ever succeed in communicating a unified agenda. The same basic critique is consistently lobbed at the academic radical left, for more or less the same reason: it isn't possible to reconcile and combine so many different voices of dissent into one philosophically tenable stance. You could make a strong case, if you were a heartless and cynical bastard, that the Nation of Ulysses is founded on that very argument, and that their entire body of work is a merciless satire on those million voices of dissent. It wouldn't be a difficult stretch. A tour of the inserts from their first two full length albums, Plays Pretty for Baby and 13-Point Program to Destroy America, is a dizzying, and often hysterically funny tour through a semiotic cyclone of influences and signs that are only loosely bound by the theme of resistance. First, the eye candy. The Nation of Ulysses' beautifully designed graphics pay direct homage to the poster design and photomontage of Stalin-commissioned artist Alexander Rodchenko and his wife Stepanovna. The design and iconography of '50s/'60s America also figure heavily, with pictures of post-War appliances and the mail-order back section of a Boys' Life magazine. But as sharply executed as the visuals are, it's in the accompanying texts that the group's performance really shines, and the Nation takes shape. References to worldwide anti-imperialist, anti-colonialist, and anti-capitalist resistances are everywhere-- among the groups the band alludes and claims brotherhood to are the Maoist Shining Path from Peru, the New People's Army of the Philippines, Islamic Jihad, and Lebanon's Hezbollah. What would a righteous revolution be without a divine mandate? Don't worry, there's plenty of religion here, too, from the man who would go on to gospel yeah-yeah. To complement the schizoid-preacher's delivery of frontman Ian Svenonius (who adopts El Gato as his saucy nom de guerre), the CD librettos invoke the idea of religious ecstasy through privation, urging Nationals to stave off sleep by whatever means. Never ones to eschew paradox, though, they turn right around and proclaim their vampirism. The general tableau here is, of course, a depiction of destruction as a means to creation and reinvention. In one of the band's funnier moments, they shower praise on Menudo for its built-in mechanism of eternal youth, and in an extravagant gesture of self-preservation, declare their own ages fixed at a perpetual 18. Mining the schematics of German expressionism, the tanned, acne-free skin and robust health of the masses are frowned upon as symptoms of moral decay and stupidity. And so, to ensure healthy moral rectitude, a cosa nostra-style code of conduct is strictly enforced (""A kid who tells on another kid's a dead kid""). Because the individual is posited as a capitalist metaphor, the Nation of Ulysses requires that everyone be Nationalized, wear dapper Fashionista uniforms, and undergo a procedure for fingerprint effacement. Holding the destruction of everything corrupt as their end goal, even the Norse Armageddon myth of Ragnarok is used as a way to prefigure the final showdown between the Nation (""of Ulysses must prevail!"") and the consumerist bloat of our sleepwalking philistine Society. For added effect, this entire mess is heavily soaked with the language of espionage, subterfuge, sabotage, paranoia, and overthrow. But is this a satire on the Left? Hilariously cruel as that would be, I prefer to think that, at least in the spirit of the venture, that's not the case. Judging from Svenonius' work in the Make-Up, and his writings outside of his music, their body of work seems relatively irony-free. And no, I would not like to buy a bridge from you, thanks. So now you know why they ruled, and we can get on to why this one doesn't. The Embassy Tapes, as implied by its name, is a collection of four-track tape recordings captured during practices and performances at the rehearsal space lovingly referred to by the Nation of Ulysses as ""The Embassy."" Recorded in September of 1992, it finds the group at the end of its rope, mere weeks before dissolving. It's unfortunate that this will be seen as the coda to the Nation's short but bright-burning career. The truth is, this record just doesn't stand up to the rest of their work. As always, the packaging and text are wonderful, but the music offers little to enjoy, aside from a couple of old favorites (alternate versions of ""Shakedown"" and ""P-Power,"" and ""Last Train to Cool""). From the most instantly quotable D.C. band ever (""Membership: as few as five, possibly hundreds""), and from the voice that performed one of the swiftest, most blasphemous, and brutal acts of musical patricide ever (""I'm not talking about a Beatles song, written a hundred years before I was born""), I would have hoped for something more from their last chapter. More violence, maybe. Nevertheless, The Embassy Tapes is interesting in that it hints at what would have been had the Nation of Ulysses continued. ""Hex-Proof"" indicates the group may have veered off in a more controlled direction, losing the saxophone and reining in the guitar noise a little. Even flashes of rockabilly appear on tracks like ""R.O.T.T.E.N,"" ""Outline for Hangout,"" and ""Gimme Disaster."" So, for the expatriate, this disc will no doubt be mandatory. Those who missed the last train to cool back in the day are strongly advised to purchase the first two albums before taking this one on.","During and after the Seattle WTO riots, you may have noticed the sinister dearth of coverage the main media outlets ...

Come to Where I'm From,Joseph Arthur,by: Spencer Owen,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a10f13d1975652138533/1:1/w_160/e0471ebf.gif,2000-04-11 05:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/302-come-to-where-im-from/,RealworldRealworld,"Joseph Arthur wants to be an enigma. I mean, really badly. He wants to be your unique, personal, do-it-yourself, enigmatic folk/pop singer/songwriter, and he'll do whatever it takes to get there. He'll cover his album art with weird, tribal drawings he made himself. He'll play more than just guitar if you want, sometimes even harmonica. He'll even experiment with different genres on a couple songs. In his liner notes, Arthur cryptically refers to himself as ""benzo,"" and gives his supporting musicians equally puzzling aliases like ""darkstar"" and ""lovehammer."" He packs his lyrics with surrealist imagery that could pertain to traditional love or loss, but what he really wants is for you to ask: ""Is that actually what he means? Could it be deeper than this?"" Yet, as the album's final seconds tick to a close, the real question at hand ends up being: ""Does it matter?"" And the answer? Well, no. But you knew I was going to say that. On his second full-length, Come to Where I'm From, Arthur's self-imposed pseudo-enigma status is more easily discarded than decoded. There are enough solid songwriting chops behind the facade to sustain him, and there's just as much-- if not more-- to be said for the production. T-Bone Burnett, Rick Will, and Arthur himself each take co-producer titles, and what results is a raw, endearing sound that blends each instrument perfectly while remaining crisp as a bell. It's some of the best production and mixing this side of Tchad Blake, who also happens to mix two of these songs, probably not all that coincidentally. As already established, Joseph Arthur's at his strongest when his ambiguously mystical lyrics don't get in the way, and most of the time, they don't. In ""Invisible Hands,"" the line ""There are things we cannot know/ Invisible hands who guide the show/ From up above"" doesn't hold significance as a spiritual revelation, but rather, simply as a way to meld his vocals with the subdued and effective melody. The track's rhythmic base pulses as Arthur moans and hums through the track's five minutes while guitars, harmonicas, and subtle buzzes of feedback float in and out. It's this eerie tone, and not the prose contained within, that provides him with the mysterious atmosphere he's tried so desperately to achieve. And then there are those times when the embittered victim in Arthur spills haphazardly onto his lyric sheet. On ""Creation or a Stain,"" Come to Where I'm From's most painful moment, he sort of, well, tries to rap about it. Actually, it isn't a rap as much as a failed Patti Smith impression. But whatever it is, Arthur manages an off-the-scale reading on the Rock Bottom lyricist detector: ""I'm a walking crucifixion/ I'm a fucked-up memory."" Over the course of its trying four-minute length, the track condemns all corruption, and laments the beggars and starving people of the world. And all this over the same two chords! Better for Arthur to stick to what he knows best. His most substantial material doesn't go for the throat, the heart, or even the intellect, but the ears. ""Cockroach,"" one of Where I'm From's standouts, is built solely on ambient street sounds, a folksy acoustic guitar progression, and a drumkit that sounds like it's made of rocks. It seems to recall memories-- possibly even actual memories-- of bygone days busking on urban street corners. The song is enhanced by the occasional delayed fuzz lead, supportive female backing vocals, and the subtle, haunting echo of Arthur's voice as he sings his heart out with every line. So I suppose it's safe to let Joe into your home. He's pleasant enough, and moderately talented. Plus, he's got quite a few nice tunes in his repertoire. But lay down some house rules first: make sure he sticks to his more musical material, don't ask him where he gets his lyrics, and never let him make you call him ""benzo."" It's not very becoming of him.","Joseph Arthur wants to be an enigma. I mean, really badly. He wants to be your unique, personal, do-it-yourself, enigmatic ...

Vagabond Ways,Marianne Faithfull,by: Kristin Sage Rockermann,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd2aeb335119a49ece05/1:1/w_160/8b5071bd.gif,2000-04-11 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2959-vagabond-ways/,InstinctInstinct,"Tonight's Headlines: Sampras Rewrites Tennis History; Cardinals Cool Off Giants; CBS News and VH1 Singing Same Tune Under Viacom; Pope Denounces Gay Pride Parade; Gates and Drug Companies to Help Poor; Professors and Student in Thesis Clash; ""Brother"" Gears Up for Long Summer, and Marianne Faithfull Has Not Lost Her Vagabond Ways. Well, obviously. You don't star in films with sparse dialogue, such as Jack Cardiff's 1968 faux-porn disaster, Girl on a Motorcycle, and just up and lose your vagabond ways. Nor do you console yourself by purchasing lots of satin Anello & David shoes when the Sussex Police find you wrapped in nothing but a fur rug at Keith Richard's acid party-- only to lose your vagabond ways thirty years later. But you might reestablish yourself as a mainstream singer/songwriter by recording an adult-contemporary album on which you sound like an aging drag queen. But what an aging drag queen! Faithfull's signature nicotine-scorched vocal chords can brand even the most banal lyrics with edgy texture and emotional impact. Faithfull is in total control as her husky throat empties out delicately at the end of each phrase, producing a quality that sounds like a little girl's voice put through the most extreme weathering imaginable. Imagine Cyndi Lauper's thin, angular vocals in ""Time after Time"" after several decades of smoking two packs of Lucky Strikes a day. Now wash it down with a Kurt Weill fascination and ample scotch: ""Then you say, go slow/ I fall behind/ The second hand unwinds..."" But stop weeping-- Faithfull didn't record a version of ""Time after Time"" on Vagabond Ways. Instead, she's resorted to attacking Leonard Cohen's ""Tower of Song"" and Roger Waters' previously unreleased ""Incarceration of a Flower Child."" Faithfull's at her current best on self-penned numbers like the catchy title track, but sadly, the quality of her writing misses the knowing tenor of her voice on ""Wilder Shores of Love"" and ""Marathon Kiss."" The instrumental arrangements here are weak throughout, too, tossing in clunky string sections and dated keyboards. The underwater synth-gun effect-- a sound that seems, miraculously, from both the '70s and the future-- is showcased in the Roger Waters number. And not surprisingly, ""For Wanting You"" (which Elton John wrote specifically for Faithfull) and the spoken-word extravaganza, ""After the Ceasefire,"" are both unbearable. I'm guessing you'd have better judgment than to spend your money on Vagabond Ways without me having to tell you not to. But the album is darker and grittier than most major-label adult-contemporary albums, so it might interest your parents-- if only to make them feel young and pure in comparison to Faithfull's thousand years. At this point in her career, Faithfull's been down the road and back again, but she hasn't run out of things to say. She's even developed a striking vehicle though which to say them, as her raspy voice seems to speak of the human experience with each syllable. You hardly notice the lyrics, and forgive her merely passable songwriting. Faithfull, whose look at the times has resembled Meryl Streep, David Bowie, Jane Fonda, and Markie Post, now looks more like a mummified Courtney Love, and her songs certainly suggest she's ""lived through this.""","Tonight's Headlines: Sampras Rewrites Tennis History; Cardinals Cool Off Giants; CBS News and VH1 Singing Same Tune Under Viacom ...

Wedding Gates' lachrymose pop musings to Plouf's propulsive percussion, the band's most notable aspect was their ability to deliver a full-bodied sound with a limited palette of materials. This six-song assemblage of early recordings for Imp Records compiles the group's first couple of singles and hard-to-find tracks. Truly, a release for only the most loyal of Spinanes fans. The songs on this disc are presumably rare, but virtually indistinguishable in execution from the rest of the Spinanes' body of work, with the exception, perhaps, of Arches and Aisles, the album Gates recorded with friends after Plouf left to become Built to Spill's permanent drummer. The first two Spinanes albums, though, are better documents of what they had to offer. The shambling singles tracks bear the blueprint of Gates' familiar vocal habits and failed-relationship wordplay. It's telling that the most affecting song on The Imp Years comes with a cover-- ""Handful of Hearts"" manages to render the break-up of the duo somewhat touching. The moment is fleeting, but it leads to ruminations on the death of ""indie"" as a self-sustaining, legitimizing force of amateurism and obscurity in music. The listener is left with the sagging realization that the Spinanes came and went, and that neither their presence nor absence amounts to very much in the long run. This realization, of course, necessitates qualification by the fans, those who at one point or another took a strong liking to the Spinanes and for whom this will doubtless be a significant release. The fact should be made plain that retrospective releases for defunct indie bands such as this are hapless attempts at bringing together loose threads for threadbare audiences paralyzed by the notion that the time and energy invested in appreciating these bands have met with diminishing returns. The ability of this release to spark interest in the Spinanes is undercut by the stylistic redundancy of their accomplished but ultimately standard take on the whole indie rock shtick. Their catalog is a dead horse best left unbeaten.","Originally comprised of singer/songwriter Rebecca Gates and drummer Scott Plouf, the Spinanes were a likable rock duo that invigorated ...

He's always been an ugly man. We were just more willing to tolerate it when he fronted a band as ferociously talented as the Stone Roses. These days, as a ""solo act,"" the Monkey Man's total lack of presentability has never been more readily apparent and, strangely enough, embraced by the man himself. His ugliness, in an abstract and simplified form, is on full display on the cover of Golden Greats in an array of cheery pastels. His mutt-fugly mug also adorns the inside cover in full photographic glory, in case you required a more sobering confirmation of his hideousness. And if that isn't enough, the CD is enhanced with a clip of the video for ""Love like a Fountain"" and a photo gallery for your viewing pleasure. The video features a chess piece, a shoe, a pailful of painfully obvious Christian imagery, and a treasure trove of homely. After his incoherent February 1998 debut, Unfinished Monkey Business, Ian Brown became renowned for alleged gay-bashing, slugging a flight attendant, and a subsequent two-month stint in the slammer. His career adopted a slight, Weilandish hue. According to his biography, this unfortunate string of events-- in addition to his complete lack of musical talent-- made him consider becoming a landscape gardener. He didn't. (We suspect it might have had something to do with an inability to hide a lack of talent as a landscape gardener by surrounding yourself with other, more talented landscape gardeners.) Of course, it only makes sense that this poor bastard would finally squeeze out a relatively engaging album. After all, you can't be this dumb and ugly and have bad luck on top of it. For the most part, Brown has left the instrumentation on Golden Greats to hired hands, leaving behind the elementary school proficiency that marred his first solo effort. He's also opted to mask his bong-cured vocals in an assload of distortion, which lends a pleasing nondescript accent to most of the tracks, and helps wash down some of his unforgivably asinine lyrics. The album runs the gamut stylistically, from the Zeppelin-esque riffs of ""Gettin' High"" to the laid-back bass line of ""Neptune."" But the music is by no means organic-- Brown melds that reliable old genre, drum-n-bass, with his rock sensibility. ""Free My Way"" rides a skittering beat, but somehow manages the rock with blazing guitarwork and bass-drenched cello. Of course, Golden Greats seems to owe its eclectic sound more to its host of capable engineers and session musicians than to any talent or inventiveness on Ian Brown's part. But that's beside the point. If nothing else, Brown at least lends some charisma and name recognition to the album, which earmarks it for attention. If you can get past the misguided cover art and multimedia, Golden Greats proves a worthy listen. But we in the States might want to wait for its slated mid-April release before rushing out to purchase the $30 UK import. It's not that fucking good.","Ian Brown is an ugly man.

He would have you know that he gave that gritty style an elegance, a grace, an acceptable glamour. His Logical Progression DJ sets and the labels associated with his Good Looking Records organization all promoted what he and his acolytes termed ""intelligent drum-n-bass."" Herein lies the problem. Bukem is a snob. The internal logic of the term ""intelligent drum-n-bass"" requires that we must think of everyone else's as moronic, noisy, and unkempt. Bukem's style, so the logic runs, is progressive, pioneering, and ground-breaking, yet when you listen to the many Good Looking compilations, they recall Roger Dean's Hypgnosis artwork and the preposterousness of 1970s progressive rock. Why would anyone use the term ""progressive?"" How many melodramatic trance tunes have beset us under the nauseating guise of ""progressive house?"" Progressive is code for ""a load of wank."" So it's ironic then that Bukem has abandoned his so-called progressive sound to produce Journey Inwards, a record that invites comparison to 4 Hero's Two Pages. Bukem is no longer interested in stunning us with his liquid ambiance. Instead, he's joined other junglist deserters in their common and quite pointless quest for a lost sequel to Herbie Hancock's Sextant. Mix it Bukem's delusional Rick Wakeman keyboard theatrics and Ian Anderson flute malarkey, and you've nailed this double album. Yep. Two-discs. This extended set only gives further evidence of Bukem's Yes tendencies. The session musicians he's hired are solid enough, though. (They are session musicians, after all). They proficiently flesh out Bukem's undernourished ideas. But there's a passion lacking from the proceedings. Each of these 14 tracks are laid down to satisfy the requirements of your local hip martini and sushi bar. This album's mellow Rhodes piano and ride cymbal flourishes will complement your local's frosted windows and utterly sophisticated white walls. Nonetheless, Journey Inwards outs Bukem as the conservative I'd always suspected him to be. His junglist work eschewed the grit and psychosis of the original hardcore breakbeat cadre to return to a dreamy, unspoiled, unreal place in space. Unlike genuine offworld pioneers like Sun Ra and Derrick May, Bukem's journeys into the universe weren't exactly in search of a harmonious world, free of Earth's manifest bigotries. I suspect him of more middle class aspirations. Hopefully, he'll find his own happiness on Journey Inwards, because this isn't the species of joy I'm comfortable being surrounded by.","LTJ Bukem would have you believe that he took drum-n-bass to a new level.

La Sirena de Pecera,Old Time Relijun,by: Michael Sandlin,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b9bbeb335119a49ec85b/1:1/w_160/b995301d.gif,2000-04-04 05:00:03,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5971-la-sirena-de-pecera/,K,"You could say that wildly eccentric (read: mentally fucked) Old Time Relijun frontman Aarington Dionyso is a little Black Francis, a little Darby Crash, some Birthday Party-era Nick Cave and part talentless Agent Orange-addled Vietnam vet derelict shoveled off the street and thrown, mid-acid flashback, into a recording studio. Like Francis on the Pixies' Surfer Rosa, Dionyso also enjoys shrieking in both Spanish and English, except that Francis' freakouts admittedly seem pretty tame and sane in comparison. And Dionyso, well, he screams unintelligible gibberish in Italian, too. Pretty gooda, eh? Amazing, though, I can actually tolerate this new EP for awhile, unlike that crass pile of digitized monkey shit-- and of course, critical favorite-- Uterus and Fire. I can only guess that the band's only true appeal is the Old Time Relijun live experience in which a crowd of normal, problem-free college kids get off on seeing some poor brain-drained mental case suffer nervous breakdowns on stage, as he rants about certain locations of doors, buying cola in a casino, and that weird electrical smell in the house. Truthfully, though, hypocrite that I am, if Old Time Relijun came to my city, I can't say I wouldn't be right there among all the other wide-eyed entertainment-starved voyeurs and cheap thrill-seekers watching Dionyso go apeshit. But then again, Old Time Relijun isn't much more than your average old-timey carnival freak show. In fact, I'm suddenly reminded of the great fartist ""Le Petomaine"" whose musical flatulence entertained Parisian high society back in the early 20th century. He was the toast of the town and a big draw, too. It's astounding, I know, but that froggie gentleman's anus had a keener sense of melody than anyone in this sorry band. Maybe it's time to try blowin' a little ass on CD, fellas? Well, gee, maybe I'm being a little harsh. On a positive note, where did Dionyso's cute little guitar riffs suddenly come from? He must've sampled his K Records mentor Calvin Johnson's old band Beat Happening. A few of the guitar parts have, in fact, advanced from Uterus and Fire's untuned sonic slop to almost-catchy two- and three-note demento spy-theme hooks. Like on ""Adaga,"" he'll take some old B-52's guitar line and truncate it to a few shaky notes, making for, at least, a halfway-listenable experience. And, I guess all the suit-and-tied mohawks at Punk Planet will be crying ""sellout"" on the almost downright poppy ""Circuit Breaker."" I found my head bobbing to the child-like guitar figure, threatened, of course, by some mean-sounding vacuum-cleaner drone in the background. And the ""composition"" they named after a line from Walt Whitman, is a Benny- Goodman- meets- Ornette- Coleman free-form clarinet squawk-fest. Ah, no jazzo frio! Por favor! Let's face it, it's cynical as hell to release and/or condone a proud- to- be- crappy band like this. They're praised to the heavens by the same attention-starved geeks who champion the annoying Shaggs and Half Japanese's Destroy All Monsters, and believe that all worthwhile music has to be totally incompetent, mindless, and secretly suffered through. I can appreciate that to an extent, but, come on, who really listens to this garbage more than once? You can bet Old Time Relijun hate their own music for leisure listening they'd probably opt for something even more sick and twisted, like Bjorn Again or Hanson. I mean, there'll always be the militant post-structuralist cashiers at the local indie record store-- y'know, guys who read Lee Ranaldo's poetry chapbooks and play stuff like Old Time Relijun to impress/annoy their snippy Foucault-misinterpreting colleagues. Anyway, I'd venture to say that La Sirena De Pecera could be an actual ""improvement"" upon Uterus and Fire. Dionyso's maniacal shrieks are louder here, providing a greater distraction from his band of circus chimps responsible for the banana-brained bass lines and obnoxious drum solos pointlessly clattering away. And no matter how ""cool"" and ""punk rock"" it is to pretend to love this stuff, Old Time Relijun's brand of white noise is usually just rickety, rhythmically retarded, and pretty damn boring, if ye ask me. To be fair, though, Dionyso may be a no-talent wreck of a half-man half-beast, but he does prove that genuinely depraved dudes can be really amusing sometimes. I'll admit, this guy makes Jon Spencer look like the staid, Ivy-educated, son of a famous psychologist he really is. I mean Spencer these days, is, at best, a skinny Elvis impersonator riding a prolonged sugar rush. Dionyso is a rabid, frothing, genuine hombre de loco in comparison. Still, does that mean La Sirena De Pecera will be a mainstay in my sellout non-punk 5-disc cd changer? Will I send the freak five bucks for a book of third grade drawings he's peddling on the inside cover? You figure it out. Meanwhile, if you like a little creativity and talent to go along with your maniac lead singers, go out and buy a Roky Erickson and the Aliens album.","You could say that wildly eccentric (read: mentally fucked) Old Time Relijun frontman Aarington Dionyso is a little Black Francis ...

Pop,GAS,by: Mark Richardson,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bef4ea9e61561daa79a5/1:1/w_160/a62886f0.jpg,2000-04-04 05:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3402-pop/,Mille Plateaux,"When German techno artist Wolfgang Voight makes music for the dance floor, he usually goes by Mike Ink, Love, Inc, or M:I:5. Indie rock label whores may remember Voight as one half of Burger/Ink, whose hypnotic Las Vegas was Matador's inaugural electronic release. The ambient side of Voight's personality is revealed by his work as Gas. Voight suppresses the playful streak he exhibits as Mike Ink when he sits down to make Gas music. Previous releases like Zauberberg and Köenigsforst adhered to a strict formula of sampled symphonic passages (sometimes described as Wagnerian, though they could be from anywhere) swirling atop an incessant 50Hz bass thump. This steady 70-80 bpm bass pulse is the Gas trademark. Though it seems a bit comical at first (and definitely would have turned me off a few years ago), the bass anchor becomes mesmerizing over the course of an album, lending the intricate string patterns needed thrust and clarity. On Pop, Voight switches things up. Gone are the gloomy samples, and the signature bass heartbeat appears on but two of these seven long tracks. Instead of containing linear motion, Pop is an exercise in sonic texture. UK music scribe Simon Reynolds pointed out that electronic music labeled ""IDM"" frequently has a marked fascination with timbre. Much of Pop takes this idea to its logical extreme, backgrounding things like melody and rhythm in favor of pure sound. I read an essay about Erik Satie's Trois Gymnopédies that compared the famous piano pieces, all very similar in melody and structure, to viewing a sculpture from different angles. Just as a few steps to the left gives insight into a visual work, identical musical elements can be shuffled slightly to provide a deeper look. I'm reminded of this analogy when I hear the first three tracks on Pop (no titles, natch). Each of these contains a warm synthesizer drone that wobbles gently between two pitches and several layers of fuzzy electronic distortion that trigger images of wind and trickling water, but slight tweaks in the arrangement of each track casts light on the construction of individual sounds. Together, these carefully placed packets of noise blend into an immersing, downright amniotic environment, especially at sufficient volume. The delicate synthesized drones will veer too close to new age music for some, but fans of Eno's dreamiest ambient work and Aphex Twin's Selected Ambient Works II will find Pop easy to curl up in. The fourth track finally brings the familiar bass drum, paired with a loop of a gorgeous ringing sound that could be a sampled electric guitar (similar in tone to passages of Burger/Ink's Las Vegas). The fifth cut is pure sonic velvet, the layered drone radiating a palpable warmth. I wouldn't have complained if this track had been stretched to the length of a CD; sadly, it lasts a mere eleven minutes. But while it begins cozy, uneasiness begins to creep into Pop just after the halfway point. By the sixth track, the mood becomes downright eerie. Though many of the textures from the first three tracks are present, the mix feels all wrong, with the synth punched up to ominous levels, and the temperature seems to plummet. Here, the cover art of Pop seems to come into play. The photographs in the liner notes consist of extreme close-ups of tree branches. At this vantage point, the twigs take on another quality, and we get a small glimpse of the worlds that exists between knots on a twig. This change in perspective reminds me of the opening montage in David Lynch's Blue Velvet, where the camera moves from the placid long shots of Lumberton to the guy having a heart attack while watering his lawn down to the horror happening at the microscopic level of the soil. Greater detail makes the world increasing unpleasant. Similarly, as you move deeper inside the world of Pop, it changes. The closer adds a marshal kick drum (this time complete with hissing high hat) to the previous track's drones, finally fleshing out the threatening scene. It's an unsettling end to a fascinating sound ride, and when it fades out, you'll enjoy the silence with sharpened ears.","When German techno artist Wolfgang Voight makes music for the dance floor, he\n\ usually goes by Mike Ink, Love ...

The For Carnation,The For Carnation,by: Nick Mirov,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bdf8abf31b7dc715607e/1:1/w_160/fba5bffd.gif,2000-04-04 05:00:01,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3151-the-for-carnation/,Touch and Go,"At the rate Brian McMahan is going, we can expect him to release an album of complete silence somewhere around 2007. You can trace his progression down the decibel scale from the angry punk scruff of Squirrel Bait through the gothic angst of Slint to the sublime but uneven work of the For Carnation. Fight Songs and Marshmallows trod too close to conventional post-rock territory to make much of an impression, but this eponymous album, while not the aesthetic breakthrough Spiderland was, is miles beyond anything McMahan has done before. It may, in fact, be the album he'd always meant to make. The primary mood of this record is one of calm and creeping dread-- impressionistic yet confidently rigid strokes of percussion and bass, sinister noises perched on the edge of your auditory range, and whispery vocals so close you can almost feel the air that carries the sound. It could easily be called trip-hop if that didn't sound like an insult, as the For Carnation have immersed themselves nostril-deep in the same atmosphere of suffocating, syrup- thick menace as the likes of Tricky and Massive Attack. This album is the sonic equivalent of standing on a deserted dock at midnight and watching fog roll towards you with a nagging feeling in your gut that some evil presence is near. ""Emp. Man's Blues"" and ""Moonbeams"" ooze so slowly from the speakers that even the reverb sounds mired in sludge. The paranoia becomes more palpable on the more, um, ""energetic"" tracks such as ""A Tribute To"" and ""Tales (Live from the Crypt),"" but the For Carnation retains control of its sound, sublimely heightening or lessening tension with expert placement of each noise. Spooky serpentine synths emerge from the ether to snap at your nose, only to dissolve away just as quickly; distorted static bubbles up like the screeches of distant vampire bats. But ""Being Held"" is the undeniable apotheosis of the album; it consists of little more than an insistent bell-like drone, subsonic bass feedback, and a neck-snapping drum solo. That's all the For Carnation needs to keep you in white- knuckled suspense for 5\xBD minutes. Sure, there's still a touch of post-rock to the album, especially on the woozy jazz shuffle of ""Snoother,"" but that's to be expected with John McEntire contributing. And it's never as obvious as on previous For Carnation albums, where the distinct influences of fellow Tortoise alumni Doug McCombs and John Herndon seemed to dilute McMahan's vision. Compared with past efforts, this record is the first to truly deserve its title: it's as close to the For Carnation as the band has come so far. How much lower can Brian McMahan go? Time will tell.","At the rate Brian McMahan is going, we can expect him to release an album of complete silence\n\ somewhere ...

The Man Who,Travis,by: Brent DiCrescenzo,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a800ea9e61561daa5700/1:1/w_160/918c5379.gif,2000-04-04 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8143-the-man-who/,Independiente,"""Every day I wake up and it's Sunday,"" Fran Healy exhales to begin The Man Who. This lazy day mood stretches throughout Travis' sophomore release. The tunes stay in their sweats and don't get around to showering until 5:45pm-- fifteen minutes before the pizza arrives. The tunes flip through football and golf. Healy sounds like he's spilling his soul to an empty cabin after 13 hours of sleep. Check out a daily planner, though-- Sunday has the least amount of space. This is the least productive day, yet most anticipated. Travis fulfills the musical equivalent of this basic human need for the occasionally mundane. While by no means groundbreaking, The Man Who massages with sincerity and crisp precision. The production is cool and spacious thanks to Nigel Godrich (of OK Computer fame), and his breath can be seen slowly puffing throughout. Icicle pickings chime over jangling acoustic ballads. Elegent and deceptively simple, like unfinished furniture, the ten songs never rise to a scream, yet the trembling ambience is nonetheless smothering. Your ears will shift focus through translucent layers of sound. Godrich truly is blessed. Fran Healy sounds remarkably like a stable Thom Yorke, and songs like ""The Fear"" point directly to this influence, but with a more folky, tender approach. Some of his notes will make your cheeks tingle. And eminating from his lungs, the repetition of ""Turn"" brings goosebumps. Travis' debut shamelessly prayed to power rock like a British Weezer, and there are still echos of that boyish glee here. Along with Weezer, Travis keep the flame of the righteous guitar solo lit while uninspired, obvious guitarists continue the Tom Pettification of this lost art and continue to piss on it. The ability to imbue solos with any sort of soul and intensity should be cherished. On The Man Who, power comes from restraint and space. There are enough subtle flourishes buried beneath the pillowy snow to reward repeated listens-- the chimes and ominous keyboard under ""As You Are,"" the wind in ""Slide Show,"" and the sitar strums on the dramatic chorus to ""The Last Laugh of the Laughter."" The hidden track even rewards those who need to rock with bellowing choruses, gong guitars, and unnerving cymbal ticks. British bands tend to leave a bad aftertaste with American audiences with their cognizant conceit. If anything, the raw humility of Travis is refreshing.

Distorted Ghost EP,Sparklehorse,by: Ryan Kearney,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a4ff5e6ef959693209ce/1:1/w_160/26fe7985.gif,2000-03-31 06:00:14,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7400-distorted-ghost-ep/,Odeon,"Sick of reviewers telling you things you don't want to know? Don't you just want them to get to the point? Well, now it's your turn to ask those direct, to-the-point questions you wish we'd ask ourselves before we go off about some trip we took to the Northwest or our adventures in college. Why did you buy Sparklehorse's Distorted Ghost EP? I'd already stopped at two record stores, where I'd purchased a combined total of nine CDs. That I bought this EP anyway-- when I saw it at yet another record store-- is a testament to my hopes for the future of Sparklehorse. But there was point in 1996 when it seemed Sparklehorse frontman Mark Linkous had no future. While on tour in England to support his debut album, Vivadixiesubmarinetransmissionplot, he overdosed on a mixture of valium and antidepressants that left him legally braindead for three minutes. As his legs were pinned underneath him while he lay unconscious for 14 hours, he was also nearly crippled by the incident. Three years later and fully recovered, he released his second full-length, Good Morning Spider, one of the darkest lo-fi records of last year. Equal parts rage and submission, the album was a disturbing reflection of Linkous' post-overdose mentality, but concerned critics urged him to improve the production for his next album. So, in short, I was hoping this EP might indicate what direction Sparklehorse is headed in. Did it? No. It's all old stuff. Then why did Sparklehorse release it? I don't know. The only discernable difference between this EP's ""Memphis Version"" of ""Happy Man"" and the LP version on Good Morning Spider is that it reduces the opening trebled, radio static from 2\xBD minutes to under one minute. The next two numbers, ""Waiting for Nothing"" and ""Happy Place,"" contain the simplistic, mechanized drumbeats and fragile vocals that characterize the Sparklehorse sound, but offer little innovation on the formula. We also get another cover of a Daniel Johnston song (""My Yoke Is Heavy"") to supplement the one Linkous recorded for Good Morning Spider (""Hey, Joe""). This cover is the EP's high point, if only because curt power chords are dispersed throughout the song with Linkous holding fast to the reins, never letting it become the loud mess it wants to be. This is classic auditory blueballs. As for the final two live tracks, all I can say about them is that they're truly unexceptional. That sounds just like a promo Capitol Records sent out after Good Morning Spider was released. That's basically what this is. They just decided to sell it to unwitting fans. Like you. Yes. Okay. Well, how does Sparklehorse's future look? It could still be alright. Apparently, Dave Fridmann is producing the next album, and he might be just what Sparklehorse needs to make a brilliant record. Dave who? Oh, he's the producer for Mercury Rev and the Flaming Lips, right? I'm sick of hearing about him. I'm not.","Sick of reviewers telling you things you don't want to know?

Dongs of Sevotion,Smog,by: Matt LeMay,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a481b1335d7bf169899e/1:1/w_160/6a470b7f.gif,2000-03-31 06:00:13,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7284-dongs-of-sevotion/,Drag City,"Recently, my mind has been occupied with the knowledge that death is not only inevitable, but can occur at any time. I could get hit by a car while crossing a street tomorrow. I could choke on my daily scuz-deli chicken cutlet sandwich. More likely still, I could get e-coli from my daily scuz-deli chicken cutlet sandwich. The bottom line is, we're all treading on thin ice. I'm going to die, you're going to die, and there's absolutely nothing we can do about it. Enter Bill Callahan's latest Smog opus, Dongs of Sevotion, to make me even more insecure about my mortality. See, thoughts of death can linger, but they can also be displaced. A song, on the other hand, can remain lodged in one's brain like a hairball in a sink drain. And Dongs of Sevotion is just brimming with the kind of unsettling tunes that remain skull-trapped for days on end, like dreams in the back of your mind. Over the past few weeks, I've found myself returning to Dongs of Sevotion just to stop myself from replaying it internally. The chanting cheerleaders on ""Bloodflow"", the impeccably placed piano riff on ""Easily Led""-- these are the kind of things that see repeat play deep in the recesses of your mind, reminding you of your imminent demise whether you like it or not. Dongs of Sevotion's opening track, ""Justice Aversion"", sounds like it could have been lifted directly off last year's brilliant Knock Knock. But, whereas Knock Knock saw Bill Callahan slipping in and out of the personas of prison security guards and teenage spaceships, Dongs takes a less schizophrenic approach to the inner workings of this guy's mind. Instead, the album tills the always-fertile topics of sex and death, coupling them with hypnotic six-minute dirges of sparse piano, guitar, and percussion. Every note and every word here has its purpose. I could fill a whole review with choice quotes from this album. In ""Nineteen,"" Callahan mutters: ""Without her clothes she looked like a leper in the snow/ I left her in the snow/ Without her clothes."" On ""Cold Discovery"", he mumbles: ""I can hold a woman/ Down on a hardwood floor/ And her teeth can gnash right through me/ Looking for a soft place."" I could keep going; every track on Dongs of Sevotion is chock-full of some of the most poignant, disconcerting lyrics you should ever have to hear. And Callahan's voice makes it all the more disquieting. It's as if the guy's dishing out his brains, thought by shameful thought, and feeding it to you with a baby spoon. It's also worth noting that Dongs of Sevotion has one of the single greatest closers I've ever heard. The final track, ""Permanent Smile"", couples an ethereal, ever-repeating piano theme with a few absolutely huge-sounding percussive hits. This, while Callahan croons: ""Seven waves of insects make families in my skin/ It's just like animals at play/ And the flesh rotted off my skull/ And then I will have earned my permanent smile/ Oh, God, I never, never ask why."" And just as you find yourself lulled into a trance by the boundless ocean of sound, everything stops suddenly. The reassuring piano melody that has played uninterrupted since the track's opening comes to an unexpected halt, its final note echoing through your cranium like some cerebral church bell. And trust me, it's an awfully scary moment. All the thoughts, fears, and worries that have surfaced in you over the record's duration come to an overwhelming climax. I don't know what sudden death is like, but I would imagine it's quite akin to the final seconds of this album. Over the course of his prolific career, Bill Callahan has wrapped himself in an almost Hamlet-like enigma. Is he really a tortured soul, destined to be plagued by violent memories, fear of death, and an overly potent imagination? Or is he just a master of disguise, a man with such a proficiency in the language of human emotion that he can draw hopes, dreams, fears, and defeats from the well of human experience, and seamlessly weave them together into a work all his own? I don't know. But I do know that Callahan has cemented his place among America's finest dongwriters.","Recently, my mind has been occupied with the knowledge that death is not only inevitable, but can occur at any ...

Figure 8,Elliott Smith,by: Ryan Schreiber,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Founder</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a46f13d1975652138ceb/1:1/w_160/81a8de9a.jpg,2000-03-31 06:00:12,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7267-figure-8/,Dreamworks,"Oh, Elliott. Are things really that bad? We've been listening to this grizzled old bastard's miseries since his self-titled, indier-than-Mary Lou Lord 1995 debut on Kill Rock Stars. And what has it gotten us? Well, those of us addicted to Smith's plug-and-play hooks got it in the ass-- we've invested well over $50 on his entire catalog. Ah, but it's a value, I guess. After all, it's a pretty rare event when we find someone this effortlessly capable of crafting whole albums of instantly accessible pop. When we last left Elliott Smith, his Dreamworks debut, XO, was being called the best album of 1998 by all your dad's periodicals. His songwriting had clearly advanced since the release of his heralded indie classic, Either/Or, and songs like ""Bottle Up and Explode"", ""Tomorrow Tomorrow"", and ""Pitseleh"" featured far more intelligent lyrics and melodies than the songs off its predecessor. But Smith's long-time followers-- Olympia indie punks and emo kids-- saw a problem. XO's multi-layered vocal harmonies, syrup-drenched string sections, polished effects and warm atmospheres detracted from the intimacy of his semi-confessional earlier work. It also didn't help that, from out of nowhere, he was nominated for a very un-punk Academy Award for his song ""Miss Misery"", which was featured prominently in the also very un-punk Good Will Hunting. A minor indie backlash ensued shortly after the record's release, but the songs spoke for themselves, and despite the record's overwhelming studio sheen, XO still holds up today as a damn fine record. The new album, of course, will be a major determining factor in the course of his career. It could break new ground in the genre, taking a hammer to conventional pop rules and re-writing music history (don't count on it), or it could establish him as the new king of adult contemporary radio, virtually erasing his name from punk's history books. Of course, it comes out somewhere between the two. Figure 8, ultimately, isn't as good a record as XO or Either/Or, though the man's not out of the picture yet. Punk fans will be pleased to know that Figure 8 is a bit more raw than XO, though the same production team-- Tom Rothrock and Rob Schnapf-- was called in again. The album accomplishes more with less saccharine perfection. But sadly, Smith still goes a little overboard here and there. The throwaway toy-piano honky tonk of ""In the Lost and Found (Honky Bach)"" is a giant, airy studio disaster complete with high-treble piano, a rambling, go-nowhere melody, and a glistening chamber hall effect that sounds like someone dropped a reverb bomb by the mic. ""Wouldn't Mama Be Proud"" is a grasp for the VH-1 ring that puts Reef to shame. And the first single, ""Son of Sam"", hasn't got a damn thing on ""Sweet Adeline"" or ""Speed Trials"", Smith's previous album openers-- it's one of the least infectious songs this guy's written since Roman Candle. But while Elliott Smith includes some of his least inspired music of all time on Figure 8, he also surprisingly pulls out some of his best to date. The simple, jerky, acoustic melodrama of ""Somebody That I Used to Know"" proves that Smith can sing in other tones than his standard shy whisper. ""Everything Means Nothing to Me"" harbors an unpredictable, evolving, vaguely psychedelic tune, and uses the album's massive major label budget to its advantage by incorporating creative, unique ideas and not overdoing it with the Neil Diamond Orchestra. ""I Better Be Quiet Now"" serves as the most affecting ballad here with its acoustic intimacy, gentle guitar strum, and Smith's lyrical honesty: ""If I didn't know the difference/ Living alone would probably be okay/ It wouldn't be lonely/ I got a long way to go/ I'm getting further away."" But ""Pretty Mary K"" sums up Figure 8 most ably. It carries the burden of that ""wall of Schnapf"" reverb overdrive, and is a shining example of Smith's sometimes lumbering songwriting which, in its attempts to remain original, can become unbearably random-sounding-- a problem that plagues this record from start to finish. Yet, it also pulls some of the album's most impressive twists, and most clearly recalls the Beatles of any of these songs. 16 Elliott Smith songs is a lot to plow through, though-- even 16 of his greatest tracks would be a task. The question here is: is it worth wading through the filler to get to the good stuff? In some cases, as with ""Color Bars"" and ""Everything Reminds Me of Her"", it can be. But how much ""Honky Bach"" can one person stand? Figure 8 is, without a doubt, another step down from XO in terms of songwriting, even if its production has taken a step in the right direction (that is, away from Michael Penn's house). In the grand scheme of things, however, you only need to hear so much Elliott Smith before you get the point.","Oh, Elliott. Are things really that bad?

Blame it on too much Godspeed You Black Emperor. When I started listening to the band last year, I became unhealthily fascinated with the idea of Armageddon. f#a#oo and Slow Riot for New Zero Kanada played out like monolithic reminders of the temporary nature of our civilization-- two separate scenarios for the imminent demise of western culture.

Zion, a Godspeed side project featuring guitarist Efrim Menuck, bassist Thierry Amar, and violinist Sophie Trudeau, forgoes the thick, orchestral sounds of the Montréal nine-piece, opting instead for a more subtly orchestrated three-to-five-piece arrangement. The result is a sound that, while every bit as powerful as that of Godspeed, is in many ways more affecting. Whereas Godspeed present a sometimes overwhelming wall of sound, A Silver Mt. Zion have turned that intimidating sonic behemoth into a sparse, penetrating beast tearing limb from limb. Musically, He Has Left Us Alone but Shafts of Light Sometimes Grace the Corners of Our Rooms lives up to its name; silence is prevalent throughout the record. Painting analogies are natural when discussing this kind of music-- the musical elements are arranged in strokes of color on a white canvas. But an abstract art analogy is even more appropriate, as He Has Left Us Alone is almost completely devoid of percussion, allowing the album to achieve a more sweeping dynamic. Adding to the profoundly personal nature of the record is the relative lack of tape- recorded wackos ranting about the end of the world. There's some highly jumbled speech about Jesus on the opening track, ""Broken Chords Can Sing a Little,"" but aside from that, Efrim Menuck himself has taken on the majority of the record's vocal duties. Initially, it's quite clear why this is the first time you've heard Menuck sing-- his voice sounds like a more nasal (yes, that's right-- more nasal) Wayne Coyne. But on further listen, the inherent nervous and unrefined nature of Menuck's voice becomes remarkably affecting. He Has Left Us Alone is a work in two movements, ""Lonely as the Sound of Lying on the Ground of an Airplane Going Down,"" and ""The World is SickSICK; (So Kiss Me Quick)."" While the former does feature occasional lapses into very Godspeed-esque taped vocals and reverb-drenched drumming, the latter marks the most beautiful music Efrim Menuck has ever committed to tape. Angelic violin and plucked cello floats over sparse organ chords, with indistinguishable noises playing through the background. Of course, He Has Left Us Alone will not rub everyone the right way. Godspeed, if not the most pretentious band ever, is certainly the most pretentious band ever to come out of Canada. And in case you haven't figured it out from the album and movement titles, this record carries all the same elements of pretentiousness as Godspeed, including the long album title and cryptic cover art. But rather than using pretension as an excuse for a shitty record, A Silver Mt. Zion utilize the universally binding emotional effects that this particular brand of ""pretentious"" music can have on listeners. For the most part, He Has Left Us Alone breaks little ground in how it conveys emotion, employing descending chromaticism coupled with occasional major thirds to evoke a perpetual sadness, broken by occasional glimmers of happiness. What makes the album such an accomplishment is the fact that these standards have been implemented with passion, skill, and above all, an almost supernatural talent. He Has Left Us Alone serves as the perfect companion to f#a#oo and Slow Riot for New Zero Kanada. Those records are haunting reminders that the world must eventually come to an end; this album is a reminder that when the world ends, you end, too.","Is it me, or was Y2K a total bust?

Hold on Hope EP,Guided by Voices,by: Matt LeMay,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bfc3abf31b7dc7156364/1:1/w_160/efa7788e.gif,2000-03-31 06:00:10,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3594-hold-on-hope-ep/,TVT,"We all know the legend: before Bob Pollard became a full-time musician, he was a fourth grade English teacher. In fact, he once had his students color in the cover art for Guided by Voices' Propeller album. So, in keeping with the tradition of Pollard educating the youth in the ways of rock, Pitchfork proudly presents: The Bob Pollard Guide to Writing and Performing Music: There's no such thing as a throwaway
People love records. The more records you put out, the more people will like you. Naturally, this means writing as many songs as you can. I recommend setting up a tape recorder, taking in a 12-pack of Michelob, noodling around on your guitar, and then waking up a few days later and listening to what you did. This invariably produces good songs. Never use the same band twice
This is a big one. Bands are like beers. Once you've been through one, you want another. And another. And you can't drink Bud all the time. Sometimes you have to switch it up. Go with a Guinness or a Harp. Maybe a Rolling Rock once in a while. Remember Zima? I liked a Zima now and again, but I have to say, a nice, warm Sam Adams tops 'em all. Oh, and never use bands from outside of your own state. Words are alright, and more importantly, necessary
I never thought there were enough words in rock music. I recommend picking at least two unrelated words and stringing them together. Then write a song about it. Some possibilities: ""telephone hazings"", ""Everest imaging"", ""fraternal nightingale..."" It's a pretty simple process. Hey, if you get really good at it, you can even try alliterating a bit: like ""robotic reasons"" or ""the fantastic frying football fillet."" This is a basic trick that'll have you writing and performing music of some kind in no time. Re-use songs
This is cool. Sometimes a song is so good, you can't release it just once. Also, sometimes you might be too drunk to remember which songs you've already released. Like this one time when I was recording this song with Doug Easley or someone, and we were just knocking 'em back. Anyway, it was like three in the morning, and the well ran dry. All we needed was just maybe another half a beer between us and this song would turn out awesome. So we dug around in my fridge and we found this old, stale open can of Pabst from probably like six months earlier. And I just figured the alcohol had evaporated, but Doug found it had kind of fermented into this really potent, sickeningly sweet, weird beer. Anyway, we finished it off, and it was sick as hell, but we definitely thought it was stronger than Everclear. We were just on the floor, trying to finish this song. Anyway, shit happened and we got the song done, and we realized after we put it out that it was just ""Kicker of Elves"" played faster. Sound British
Another biggie. People love British people. Friends, I'm gonna level with you: there was a time when Pollard could pull songs out of his ass that most songwriters would spend their lives trying to compose. But, as Do the Collapse demonstrated, those days appear over. The band's new nine-song EP, Hold on Hope, which consists mostly of outtakes from Do the Collapse, is more of the same over-produced junk Pollard just can't stop himself from releasing these days. ""A Crick Uphill"" is a feeble attempt at alt-country-- the kind of boring, weak shit one would expect to find on Kid Marine. ""Idiot Princess""-- aka ""Snuff Movie (She's Gone)"", aka ""Reptilian Beauty Secrets""-- which was released on the fanclub-only album Tonics and Twisted Chasers, is a mediocre blast of unfocused fuzz. ""Underground Initiations"", ""Interest Positions"", ""Avalanche Aminos"", and ""Do the Collapse"" all sound like what they are: leftovers from Do the Collapse. And while Ric Ocasek's production is, in Pollard's words, ""slick as snails,"" the glossy coating can't hide the fact that Pollard's on the verge of losing his muse. The only really worthwhile track on this EP is ""Tropical Robots"", a 40-second acoustic ballad that harkens back to the good old days of GBV when UFOs were hardcore, demons were real, and blimps went 90. Funny thing is, all of these outtakes are better than the actual album cut, the sugary-sweet ""Hold on Hope"". Note to Bob: we all liked it better when your lyrics were whimsical and absurd instead of trite and infuriatingly dull. ""Everybody's got to hold on hope/ It's the last thing that's holding me."" If Pollard's recent output is any indication, he'd better hold on hope that the elementary school he used to work at will take him back.","We all know the legend: before Bob Pollard became a full-time musician, he was a fourth grade English teacher.

Living in the Flood,Horace Andy,by: Dan Gardopee,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a098ea9e61561daa45d5/1:1/w_160/8077977f.gif,2000-03-31 06:00:09,Global,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/185-living-in-the-flood/,Melankolic,"Alright, no fooling around. Anyone whose primary references to the word ""skank"" have something to do with really trashy girls from back in school, put your hand up. Okay, get out of here, the lot of you! This record ain't for you pansies! This is the real ""ragga-ragga"" deal, and if you disagree, Horace will have you know that it's been tested and approved by a panel of ""hardcore, ragga-ragga, ghetto people."" No, I'm not joking. Neophytes and other stragglers still reading this should be given the quick, obligatory rundown: no, Massive Attack did not discover Horace Andy busking outside a cafe a la Damo Suzuki and Can. He's a living legend with an impressive discography now spanning three decades and an instantly recognizable voice. He was picked up from relative obscurity for Massive Attack's seminal Blue Lines album in 1990. Suddenly, Andy's passionate, soaring, wide-vibrato voice was blaring from every hipster's stereo system in the UK. And with the hype machine building everywhere else, his contributions to 1994's Protection were even more prevalent. That said, the quick-to-judge might shoot an eyebrow up at this brand new set: all Horace, appearing on Massive Attack's Melankolic label. Is this his sell-out album? Certainly not. For the most part. Make no mistake. This is no reggae-pop album. This isn't Sting slumming it with Shabba Ranks. It's pure, unadulterated ""ragga ragga,"" as stated above. Refraining from whoring himself out to an undoubtedly rabid niche of British electro-wanks and ending up with a post-modern mess of an album, Horace Andy goes back to the studio the best way he knows how: back in Jamaica, with crack session musicians hand-picked from the island gathered at Tuff Gong Studios in Kingston. Listening to this album, you may wonder about his decision. There is, after all, something to be said for classicism, not to mention class, and both are in abundance here. The passion, though, is ironically often plundered from these tracks thanks to the upfront, dry, and crystal-clear sound-- a common sonic quality of what is rightfully called ""contemporary reggae."" Here's a hint: there's a reason you probably can't name too many contemporary reggae artists, even if you can name quite a few old-timers. Well, it's true. The old guys did it better. Fans of the echo-chamber pilfered in more recent years by Mad Professor and his ilk will find little to get lost in here. Living in the Flood is unfortunately rather by-the-numbers as a whole, though some concessions are made. Some of the tracks are difficult to distinguish from each other-- always a problem for the non-fanatics trying to make their way through an entire reggae album. Multiple listens, however, provide more insight into these occasionally beautiful songs. The opener, ""After All,"" is a tightly-woven groover to which the listener might contemplate his imminent suicide as he's ""looking for a soft place to fall."" Andy's voice perfectly complements the haunting mood. ""Don't Blame the Children"" shakes up the rhythmic formula a bit, providing a more uptempo and funky backdrop that gives his voice a bit of a different angle than the traditional slow-burning stompers. Here, he handles it with sublime grace and tenderness, invoking memories of childhood in Kingston watching ""John Wayne and James Bond"" and being moved to possess guns, and drink alcohol ""to be cool."" Sure, there's nothing fancy about Andy's lyrics here, but when the issues are so real and the sentiments so personal, why dress it up in opaque wordplay? This is Horace, not Roland Orzabal. Elsewhere, charged Rastafari cries (""My Lord,"" ""Seven Seals"") and another socially conscious message track (""Johnny Too Bad"") bring out the best in Horace and his backing band. Yet, despite his passionate voice, he falters on the album's three obvious love songs (""True Love,"" ""Right Time,"" ""Girl of My Dreams""). ""Right Time"" in particular is schmaltzy, not a bit touching (even viewed in a naïve light), and downright silly. While not obvious failures, the Joe Strummer-penned title track and ""Doldrums,"" written up for Horace as a bit of a thank you by Massive Attack's 3D Del Naja, are comparatively yawn-worthy and perhaps among the most musically staid, given the collaborators involved. As any seasoned listener knows, there's nothing more irritating than an uneven album from a great artist. The best moments reflect their lofty talent and echo the prime work of their career. The worst moments challenge the notion that their artistry is still relevant and worth your attention. Here, as is typical, the low points seem to come from unnecessary collaboration and inappropriate production. Andy's voice needs to sparkle, yes, but not everything else does. Allowing some rough edges to survive post-production might've helped add some grit to these heartfelt and generally poignant songs. As it is, you're left with a contemporary reggae album sporting several instant classics, some real crap, and in the middle of it all, a singular talent trying desperately to be heard. Here's hoping that next time around, there's nobody rolling any boulders in his way.","Alright, no fooling around.

MACHINA II/The Friends and Enemies of Modern Music,The Smashing Pumpkins,by: D. Erik Kempke,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a469ea9e61561daa4ed5/1:1/w_160/8e46a425.gif,2000-03-31 06:00:08,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11828-machina-iithe-friends-and-enemies-of-modern-music/,Constantinople,"I'd pretty much written the Smashing Pumpkins off after their severely disappointing fifth (and assumed to be final) album, MACHINA/The Machines of God. The laughable attempt at storyline, the terrible songs, and the ungodly production flourishes glued the final sequin on Billy Corgan's velvet-lined coffin. Though I'd been a fan for many years, even through 1998's unfairly maligned Adore, I didn't bat an eye when Corgan announced the band's imminent breakup. Then comes this new, hastily issued ""final album."" Rejected by their label, the band printed 25 copies (consisting of three ten-inch EPs and a 2xLP set) on their own imprint, gave them to 25 people, and instructed those people to distribute it digitally. This was their best option to get the material out, since Virgin would have blocked any attempt to release it on another label. It would be extremely easy to dismiss this album as Billy simply taking out the accumulated garbage of the past couple years. It would be easy, that is, if it didn't almost redeem the Pumpkins. You certainly can't accuse them of trying to make a buck, as they've probably lost at least a couple hundred printing up the source copies of this Internet-distributed release. And it's all the more frustrating that this album features an abundance of tracks that throw the deficiencies of their previous record into even sharper relief. Within the first three songs, I'm immediately reminded of everything I ever loved about the Smashing Pumpkins: perfect examples of the dream-pop/arena-rock hybrid they forged back in 1993. The performances are, for the most part, raw and mostly live sounding, with some tracks actually recalling the glory days they spent in Butch Vig's basement. Basically, you get the one thing missing on MACHINA I: the sound of a band playing. But there's plenty of filler in this set, too, and it's not really sequenced to be played as a continuous album. Several songs are unnecessarily repeated. And did we really need a ""demo"" version of the still-awful ""Heavy Metal Machine""? Probably not. But all these faults aside, within this collection resides an album that would have been infinitely superior to The Machines of God. The high points are high enough to erase any bad taste left by that album. Songs like ""Dross"" and ""Glass' Theme"" could have provided the ""return to rock"" that MACHINA I failed to deliver. The long-standing live favorite ""Let Me Give the World to You"" could have been the hit single the group never managed to score. ""Here's to the Atom Bomb"" sounds like an answer to ""1979"". ""Vanity"" and ""Home"" are simply gorgeous, songs only the old Pumpkins could have made. There isn't really any new ground broken here, but the band revisits nearly every style they've adopted over the years. Throughout, they sound energized and at a creative peak. Jimmy Chamberlin's muscular, fluid drumming provides the backbeat missing from the Pumpkins' music for the last couple years. James Iha has developed from a merely competent rhythm guitarist into a creative lead player, providing a spacy ambience to Corgan's power-riffing. And as easy as it's been to dismiss Corgan as a fame-hungry self-aggrandizing egomaniac over the years, this set proves that he's also a songwriter of considerable talent. So take this as a proper farewell to the Smashing Pumpkins-- it's a nice album to remember them by. Believe me, it's the last album I expected to enjoy this year. And the icing: it's free.","I'd pretty much written the Smashing Pumpkins off after their severely disappointing fifth (and assumed to be final) album ...

Making Paper,Richard Youngs,by: Sam Eccleston,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929aadc5e6ef95969321667/1:1/w_160/63b36a24.gif,2000-03-31 06:00:07,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8840-making-paper/,Jagjaguwar,"Either you're one of those people who puzzles over connect-the-dots drawings for hours without making sense of the thing, or you see it instantly. Likewise, when Britain-born Richard Youngs kicks into one of his half-hour length, piano-and-vocal ballads, it's either wonderful or excruciating, depending on whether you're willing to commit enough time to put it together. Usually, if a song is 22 minutes long, it's because it's so overstuffed with changes, tempo shifts, and experimental passages that it can't possibly fit into the 3:40 format accorded the average pop song. Youngs, on the other hand, doesn't stretch a track like ""Warriors"" to a positively epic length by cramming it with prog-rock theatrics and guitar solos; he does it by slooowwwwwing thhhhe thiiiiiiing dowwwwwwwn. Come to think of it, ""epic"" isn't the word for ""Warriors"" at all-- that would imply elaborateness, or at least a wide scope. This track's just a pair of piano chords repeated at a glacial pace and Young's wan, frail voice. You heard right. One song. For 22 minutes. I am not making this up. It sounds like Young recorded a spritely little number and had a field day with the variable-speed fader. Each chord echoes and reverberates before the next one begins. Youngs' voice quavers over single syllables for deciminutes at a time. Surprisingly, this isn't nearly as excruciating as it sounds. For utterly intangible reasons, Youngs' formula is surprisingly effective. Having previously released a similarly paced suite of acoustic guitar numbers about his recently passed dog, he seems to know what he's doing. And despite its repetitive qualities, the unresolved nature of ""Warriors"" manages to come off surprisingly evocatively. Each chord hangs in the air for a minute, and the lyrics-- standard fantasy-rock fare about ancient battlefields or something-- unfold their narrative slowly and assuredly, allowing the track to firmly hold attention for most of its duration. All this said, Making Paper relies entirely on the listener's frame of mind. For one listen, the record induces a trance-like state full of contemplation; on the second or third helping, it seems like the worst mistake ever. With so little going on, it's necessary for the person on the other end of the speakers to connect the conceptual dots. If you're up for it, give it a try.","Either you're one of those people who puzzles over connect-the-dots drawings for hours without making sense of the thing ...

One More Reason to Forget,Low,by: Pete Nicholson,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd83ea9e61561daa7707/1:1/w_160/cd4e9418.gif,2000-03-31 06:00:06,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4896-one-more-reason-to-forget/,BlueSanct,"I received One More Reason to Forget from my undernourished record store at about the same time a dress rehearsal for the apocalypse was taking place in front of the city's casino. It was a time of civil disobedience-- the windy and confused sequel to the Seattle riots. Returning home, there was a vague feeling amongst the populace that the end was nigh. Reclining at a safe distance from the city, I played Low's new live EP, One More Reason to Forget, greatly anticipating that it would provide the soundtrack to society's long-awaited end. The first scene was set by the aching, organ-drenched melody of Songs for a Dead Pilot's ""Be There."" As an ambulance flies past in outer Louisville, Alan Sparhawk gently sings, ""You can't sleep backwards/ You can't save the animals."" Instantly, the collision of dogma and batons outside begins to lose its edge. As the album forges its somber path, Sparhawk and Mimi Parker's melded vocals plowing the tall grass ahead, I lose hope in sedated bliss. These tracks were recorded to DAT at Louisville, Kentucky's Church of St. Phillip Neri on November 6th, 1997. The acoustics make for a spare ambience, most notably on the brooding ""Landlord."" Punctuated by the occasional snare and Zak Sally's quaking bass, Sparhawk cries out with deep conviction rarely seen in this age of musical self-reflection. Contributing violinist Ida Pearle expertly drives the classical melody of ""Condescend,"" shadowed by the soft vocals of percussionist Parker. And when the band's stunning rendition of The Curtain Hits the Cast's 17-minute, reverb-soaked noise epic, ""Do You Know Tow to Waltz,"" the escalating violence outside quickly disappears behind my newfound warm myopia. There seems to be no weak track on this release; the songs appear carefully chosen to create a dense, but hopeful, atmosphere. One More Reason to Forget, capturing a stellar performance predating the existence of Secret Name, is as heartbreaking as it is soporific, leading me to believe that their strong Mormon religious convictions are partially responsible for the consistent quality of the material. This band has but one goal: to achieve an unsettling calm through highly melodic, droning vocals, minimalist percussion, and tense acoustics. Indeed, Low require no apocalypse to soundtrack; they create one.","I received One More Reason to Forget from my undernourished record store at about the same time a dress rehearsal ...

Permutation,Bill Laswell,by: Brent S. Sirota,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a1d2ea9e61561daa48bd/1:1/w_160/a239f356.gif,2000-03-31 06:00:05,Global,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4698-permutation/,Ion,"If there's one thing Bill Laswell knows, it's depth. Whereas much contemporary electronic music prefers to skitter spastically on the surfaces in high frequencies, Laswell's recent electronic projects are all anchored by an unassailable bottom. The sound has back. What else could we expect from a bassist who cut his teeth in late 70s head-funk outfits like Material and Massacre? As aggressively diverse as Laswell's influences must be, the dominant mode in his last five years of musical output has unquestionably been dub. A soiled dub-- aeons from the Home Town Hi-Fi sound system that Osbourne Ruddock hotwired to become King Tubby-- but dub all the same, marked by the same deep beat, spacy echoing and vertigo reverb. This year's harrowing Invisible Design was something of a departure from the space-junk dub Laswell's been overseeing for most of the decade. The ""head's up"" to Amon Tobin's lawyers aside, Laswell's Permutation returns him to the company of his old cronies: Nicky Skopelitis (aka Ekstasis), Hassan ibn Ali, and Dark Matter. The results aren't difficult to predict: expertly played, dub-based world music, heavy on the reverb and cut with some solid drum-n-bass underneath. Ideal as a soundtrack for sludgy narcotized sex and all the requisite mind games that precede it. Permutation has a great deal more gravity than the graceful but somewhat undernourished Ekstasis album, Wake Up and Dream, which is something of a predecessor. Skopelitis' warm and cautious guitar work is suspended over the abysmal depths of Laswell's bass and overall production technique, precarious as a rope footbridge. Sitar, tabla, wind instruments from every continent all add local color but the Laswell/Skopelitis interchange remains the heart of the album. The album takes some chances here and there, notably ""Iron Black"", a fuzzy, riff-powered space-rock tune which divides its time between Chemical Brothers-style big beat and the lysergic jams of Funkadelic. But for the most part, this record doesn't cohere thematically; rather, it sounds like an afternoon workout of five gifted musicians jamming with the tapes left rolling. There's nothing urgent about Permutation, nothing necessary. You'll enjoy it, but you probably wouldn't pause it to take a piss. This is the problem with so much of Laswell's recent output: its appeal is undeniable, its throb is unavoidable, but it demands very little. It has the quality of studio sessions, rather than a singular artistic statement. And this may come down to a question of policy. Laswell seems to value multiple solid releases annually over the possibility of a single great release every two years or so-- one that could conceivably be culled and constructed from the many great moments that wind up scattered throughout each year's reliable but rarely revolutionary handful. Perhaps this is why Laswell's Invisible Design was so striking: its confessional candor, compositional rigor and disavowal of masks made it such a radical offering. None of Laswell's other works had anticipated his performance on that piece; by contrast, Permutation immediately takes its place among the glut of reliable world-dub samplers that Laswell has constructed over the last decade. Permutation still works wonders for that hazy funk-love that makes the world go round, but the clarion of Invisible Design continues to ring like Doomsday.","If there's one thing Bill Laswell knows, it's depth.

In addition to releasing an EP, they've done remix and production work for fellow travelers like Takako Minekawa and Fantastic Plastic Machine. From the company they keep, you'd guess that DJ Me DJ You's music is supposed to be clever, light, fun, and funky. You'd be about half right. This album begins with DJ music's most overworked device: a sample from a test record. Hearing yet another straight-laced voice from the early 60s telling us how to position the speakers of our hi-fi doesn't bode well for an original listening experience. We brace ourselves for a dull tour of some Salvation Army beathead's obvious record collection, and we expect the worst sort of cut-and-paste clichés. But the problem with this album doesn't stem from a lack of originality or the fact that fragmented, kitschy collages are passé. A quick listen reveals that Rainbows and Robots is loaded with bizarre aural scraps of the most obscure order, and the limitless possibilities of sample-driven music suggest that another few dozen great albums are waiting to be born. But rather than make one, these guys pile the oddball soundbytes to the moon without acknowledging the essential rule of pop composition: Give 'em something to grab on to. Successful pop music needs at least one of following components: A beat, a riff or a melody. And despite their skill with offbeat sounds, DJ Me DJ You is stingy with all three. The drums throughout Rainbows and Robots are mixed way back, distancing the music from its hip-hop origins. Fragments of guitars, sci-fi movie quotes, ethnic voices, video games and sound effects records pan back and forth without any repeating hooks to tug you into the sonic maelstrom. And of the many cheesy Moog lines coursing through these tracks, few will have you humming. There are a couple of exceptions. ""Video City Boy"", which combines what I believe are Galaxian samples with a tasty disco string riff, would sound great on any stereo if the volume was high enough. The title track parlays a killer electric piano line straight out of a 70s sitcom and aged drum programming into genuine pop magic. Unfortunately, these are exceptions on what is ultimately a pretty mediocre record.","DJ Me DJ You is Ross Harris and Craig Borrell, two guys best known as the production arm of\n ...

The Covers Record,Cat Power,by: Kristin Sage Rockermann,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a54cb1335d7bf1698b79/1:1/w_160/385a9697.gif,2000-03-31 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1344-the-covers-record/,Matador,"Listening to Cat Power's The Covers Record is distracting me from the task at hand. I'm writing, but I'm typing slowly under the album's spell. I'm also asking myself, ""Isn't a 7.6 a bit high for a covers album?"" Chan Marshall didn't write these songs-- I heard she didn't even practice them. She likely spent less than an afternoon in the studio. Sure, it's an endearing concept, but 7.6 for a ""it's just me and my guitar and the fakebook from my brother's closet"" kind of affair? Come on, Rockermann; let's be reasonable here. This, of course, is not about reason, it's about a strange force called Cat Power. Cat Power tempts you to forgive the inconsistencies in her albums. And inexplicably, you won't feel like asking for your money back when Marshall fails to make it through 12 minutes of her $12 show. This bizarre Cat Power also charms an audience into responding ""a little higher"" when she nonchalantly asks if anyone in the room ""knows a B."" Cat Power has inspired tautological delusions in more than one skinny boy: ""I understand her/ She is misunderstood by everyone/ Like me/ Thus, I understand her."" To demonstrate this phenomenon, Matador has taken 12 songs and exposed them to Cat Power. The data was then collected on The Covers Record. Let's check out some of the results. Chan sings: ""When I'm drivin' in my car/ And that man comes on the radio/ And he's tellin' me more and more,"" but there's no trace of Mick-- or of the renowned chorus-- in this version of ""(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction."" Marshall has put a blue cover over a red song, and it's one of the album's stronger tracks. The other standouts come when Chan doses sparse numbers heavily in Cat Power and makes them her own. Imagine Chan Marshall sending herself, John Malkovich-style, through her own portal, and you have Marshall's cover of the Cat Power original, ""In This Hole"". The slow sadness of this version has its appeal, but it might have been more effective if the piano arpeggios were less prominent in the mix. It would shift the focus off the amateurish simplicity of the song and onto Marshall's vocals which seem fragile not because they're slight, but because her lyrics sound like they could snap under their own weight. That's what you paid the $12 for. In the past, I've been wary of Velvets covers. This might be the product of a recurring nightmare about a Velvet Underground tribute album which includes Jewel performing ""Afterhours"", Belle & Sebastian doing ""Sunday Morning"", and Wolfie's take on ""Black Angel's Death Song"". So I was naturally hesitant when I noticed that Marshall covers ""I Found a Reason"" here. I mention this not to self-indulgently map out what is sacred to me, but to point out that Marshall traipses around on just about everybody's hallowed ground here and pulls it off masterfully. Cat Power's cover of ""I Found a Reason"" might actually make you weep until Marshall comes back around to lick your wounds, all in under two minutes. You can call me a wuss or say it's because I'm a girl-- keep in mind that I didn't shed a tear at Saving Private Ryan, which some critic apparently called ""wound-porn""-- but Cat Power's The Covers Record is the real deal, the embodiment of wound-porn. Buy it now; hide it under your mattress.","Listening to Cat Power's The Covers Record is distracting me from the task at hand. I'm writing, but ...

The Noise Made by People,Broadcast,by: Dan Gardopee,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a3a413d1975652138b1c/1:1/w_160/3d1c4f84.jpg,2000-03-31 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/946-the-noise-made-by-people/,Warp,"A look at the music history book tells us a lot of things. One of these is that nearly everything from the past eventually comes back, and with a vengeance. While this undeniable truth is responsible for a lot of distinctly horrible things (house that relies on disco samples), it also contributes to some of the most mind-boggling, and often enlightening, stylistic combinations. The UK sextet Broadcast are not the first to marry electronic music's underlying futuristic bend with elements of film noir and classic torch song writing. One can't help but make the Portishead comparisons, what with the icy detached cool of vocalist Trish Keenan and the unhurried, slightly blunted beats. But where Portishead's prevailing mood contained a sense of doom and that of staring across a chasm toward some unattainable happiness, Broadcast are much less about burying their music in your psyche and more about beaming it at you from somewhere in outer space. There's also a lot more layers to get lost in here, whereas the Portisfolks made you concentrate on the meaning of every well-placed speck of sound in the stark spaces they created. While the soft-focus, hazy atmosphere is the result of modern technology in the studio, the music isn't content to fall back on it. In fact, the band roster would even like every doubter to realize that they're indeed a band and not just a talented bunch of egghead producers. Yes, there's a bassist, there's a guitarist, and there's even a real drummer. While the deadly precision of the samples-and-sequences method of making music has its merits, the approach could not achieve the chilling organic qualities that Broadcast exudes. There's a prevailing sense of definite vision, but not one of the product being excessively labored over. Sure, there's craft at work here, but whereas most albums recorded over long periods of time sound weary and defeated in the final analysis, The Noise Made by People is positively vibrant and alive. Though it's slightly disconcerting to hear sounds like this without being floored by a sense of daring and originality, it's a testament to the explosion of genre-bending music that was the underground's biggest artistic accomplishment in the 1990's. Broadcast one-ups the avant leanings of most of these juxtaposition-experimenting acts by making these advances work in the context of memorable pop songs. Sure, there are precious few limbs-aloft choruses here, but I challenge even the most pop-hating avant-o-phile to not warble along with Keenan through the lovely melodic hooks of ""Come On Let's Go"" and ""Look Outside."" Special praise must be given to the band for the sonic imprint here. Drums are cyclonic washes of lovely pattering and lovelier noise. Guitars chunk away purposefully as often as they slide on single note lines through the background ether. Strings and keyboards evoke sublime visions of soundtracks to old films as well as those yet to be realized. But for all the sound and song, Broadcast's vision seems relatively narrow, and several ideas are spread a bit too thinly across the album's length. The band obviously have the talent and the means. Now perhaps, with the doubters silenced and the integrity assured by this release, they can explore some other avenues on future releases.","A look at the music history book tells us a lot of things.

We Have the Facts and We're Voting Yes,Death Cab for Cutie,by: Brent DiCrescenzo,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a8d89d034d5c69bf3b3e/1:1/w_160/9835d541.jpg,2000-03-31 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2227-we-have-the-facts-and-were-voting-yes/,Barsuk,"There's something about the Pacific Northwest. Perhaps it's being overshadowed by towering evergreens that instills a modest reverence for beauty. Perhaps it's the evergreens remaining ever green under the gusts of snow which keeps hope alive. Perhaps it's the cradling of cold coast and the Rocky wall. Whatever the causes, the Pacific Northwest has played womb to some of the most skyward, heart-wrenching, and gentle pop music of recent history. The trademarks of the Northwest sound continue to be cherubic eunuchs on vocals, crisp production, slow rollercoaster melodies, and tales of crushes and the crushed. Built to Spill, Elliott Smith, Quasi, Sunny Day Real Estate, and even Modest Mouse and Caustic Resin, to some extent, all revolve around this central axis of Northwestern pop. In two short albums, Death Cab for Cutie have firmly established a stylistic nexus from which all of these bands spoke. Like history in reverse, We Have the Facts and We're Voting Yes documents the proto-Northwest sound as a footnote to a decade of tranquilizing rock. Death Cab for Cutie effortlessly weep gems like a band stuck deep in a comfortable career. Subcutaneous organ and glockenspiel infuse warm, rich tones which bruise slowly between skeletal percussion and waxy guitar pickings. Sometimes the band patiently fills wooden cathedrals with echoes of reverberating slowcore, like on ""No Joy in Mudville"" and ""The Employment Pages"". The latter builds to an e-bow climax that weakens like a welcome influenza. ""For What Reason"", ""Lowell, MA"", and ""Company Calls"" click along at quick clips, yet maintain the shroud of delicate beauty thanks to Ben Gibbard's lachrymose wails. From a distance, the group appears manilla. But even top secret documents come stuffed in manilla. Subtle technological flourishes glimmer under the organic pulp like microchips in lumberjacking valleys. If fault can be found, it's Death Cab for Cutie's continual quest to shine a diamond from petrified wood and dark coal instead of letting some of the rough, raw rock pass through. But then again, that's why the Northwest gave us Modest Mouse and Built to Spill. Guitar heroics can be found elsewhere. Death Cab for Cutie have a killer name and lugubrious elixir. The hooks are barbless and coated in Novocaine. They pull through your skin and leave obscure scars. But in today's rock climate, this sort of gentle niche makes for a relaxing vacation with some good prospects of getting laid.","There's something about the Pacific Northwest.

"Whatever You Love, You Are",Dirty Three,by: Mark Richardson,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b999eb335119a49ec807/1:1/w_160/62f382d5.gif,2000-03-31 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2329-whatever-you-love-you-are/,Touch and Go,"Every kid periodically finds himself enrolled in something called ""Arts and Crafts,"" where he learns to express himself with Popsicle sticks. Say you feel some existential angst over the unpredictability of the expanding universe; you might dump a handful of popsicle sticks and a glob of glue into a bucket, shake randomly, and let the sticks fall where they may. Because I spent many years in summer camp enrolled in these kinds of classes, I never learned to differentiate the art from the craft. It's all the same to me. I buy a table because I need a place to set my highball glass, and I buy an album because I need help feeling something. Plumber, writer, boat detailer, cellist-- they're all the same thing. The one you choose just depends on what you're looking for. Dirty Three have a special place in many an indie rock fan's heart because they have a strong sense of craftsmanship. They call themselves the Dirty Three because they're not afraid to roll up their sleeves and get to work; if a little excess muck gets flung about when they're in the midst of construction, well, that's just part of the job. These guys are working stiffs. I mean, who wouldn't want to suck down a few jumbo cans of Foster's with Warren Ellis, Mick Turner and Jim White? No one wouldn't, that's who. I may have used a double negative at the end of that last paragraph, but I am doubly positive that if you dig the Dirty Three in any way you will absolutely love Whatever You Love, You Are. It's their best album yet, beating the holy crap out of already great albums like Horse Stories and Ocean Songs. For the first time, Dirty Three delve heavily into orchestration, adding layers to Ellis' violin, making him sound like a quartet all by himself. And the instrumental melodies are, simply, among the most beautiful you'll hear this year. ""Some Summers They Drop Like Flies"" is a swooning bolero that patiently works through slight variations in melody. ""I Really Should've Gone Out Last Night"" layers Ellis' picked fiddle over White and Turner's lurching, off-the-beat rhythm, until Ellis emerges with an emotional bowed passage. ""I Offered It Up to the Stars and the Night Sky"" starts with a canon-like figure comprised of at least four tracks of Ellis' violin repeating variations on the same refrain, and eventually finds its way to one of the trio's patented epiphanies, aching with drama and transcendence. ""Some Things I Just Don't Want to Know"" is the most cinematic track, conjuring images of big sky and drunken peasants dressed in rags. And the gorgeous ""Lullabye for Christie"" makes me wish, for the first time I can recall, that my name was Christie. Get this: I am this album.","Every kid periodically finds himself enrolled in something called ""Arts and Crafts,"" where he learns to express himself with Popsicle ...

Goodbye Enemy Airship the Landlord is Dead,Do Make Say Think,by: S.

Godspeed labelmates Do Make Say Think further the velvet Canuck revolution with their own brand of maddeningly affecting slow burn compositions, but they mine common ground to very different effect. Do Make Say Think's extended developments of melodic themes are driven principally by guitar, but soon explode into grand crescendos that run the gamut from free jazz (""When Day Chokes the Night"") to pensive lock-grooves (""Minmin""). Their work is definitely a certain kind of ""post-rock,"" but thankfully, they steer clear of generic Tortoisisms. Two drummers duel subliminally for the rhythmic steering wheel while warm keyboards and effects do their part in articulating the distinctive texture. However, it's the sound of the guitar that lends this album its cohesive sound. The six strings creep around corners with repeated melodic refrains, a rough sound played with a delicacy that belies the stamping of the distortion pedal that will strike as surely as the apocalypse. Each song has its particular crest, and while Do Make Say Think follow the formula religiously, the tension they build with each release cancels any lethargy. Fittingly, the final track, ""Goodbye Enemy Airship,"" erupts as if the previous tracks were mere tremors. It's this band's ""Mogwai Fear Satan,"" an effects-laden cloud enveloping a determined bass pulse. The six-strong line-up recorded this album in a barn, and a moving sense of dramatic isolation is felt as the song-cycle of Goodbye Enemy Airship the Landlord is Dead unfolds. It's like walking down a beaten country road littered with inclines and declines at night and not daring to deviate from the path or look back. Each chord is a step forward, each outburst a cathartic cry to the domineering starry sky. Do Make Say Think have imbued their second album with such a strong sense of purpose and an indefatigable belief in their characteristic sound that comparisons become largely irrelevant. That they succeed so well on their own terms without weighing their music down with tired post-rock clichés makes their work that much more compelling.","I always appreciated the pedigree of Canadian music, but was never able to\n\ convince myself that the country was ...

High Fidelity OST,Various Artists,by: Michael Sandlin,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6e4ea9e61561daa547f/1:1/w_160/91f4afa2.gif,2000-03-28 06:00:05,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7865-high-fidelity-ost/,HollywoodHollywood,"John Cusack, drawing on all his previous experience playing comical losers who somehow end up scoring with hot chicks, is a co-producer of the High Fidelity soundtrack. In this case, ""producer"" simply means, ""Guy who forks over big bucks and chooses what songs are used on the soundtrack,"" rather than twiddling knobs on a soundboard and getting stoned on hashish. Cusack and his co-producers take care to choose music that very specifically fits the themes, characters, and situations of the film. It's an ideal collection of songs for all us semi-geeky, under-sexed fellows who idolize Cusack, and sublimate untapped sexual energy in the form of esoteric rock lists, bitchy reviews, obscure album collections, and late-night rock-related trivial pursuits (such as: ""Hey, man, did you know that Mike Nesmith's mom invented Liquid Paper?"") I was pleased to find that ""You're Gonna Miss Me,"" the 13th Floor Elevators' 1966 semi-hit, was served as the leadoff cut on the soundtrack. The damn song still sounds as advanced as ever. No one's been able to come up with a better psychedelic gadget than that bubbly electric jug sound of theirs; its strange sonic emanations percolate up through the drip-drip-drip of the reverb guitar. And LSD-crazed Roky Erickson had a fire in his belly, set by some evil female arsonist. His voice is demonic, like a male Janis Joplin. He emits primal rock 'n' roll shrieks unequaled by few men or beasts, other than maybe John Lennon on that hellfire Plastic Ono Band album. Arthur Lee's Love provides a potent combination of Motown soul and intelligent pure pop on ""Always See Your Face."" Lee's lyrics here make a straightforward and direct plea for help in a world that done him wrong. He forgoes the usual psychedelic imagery to assure an estranged lover that she'll never be able to forget his ugly mug. Bob Dylan's last studio album, Time Out of Mind, was one of the best lovesick breakup albums he's ever released. Here, he continues in that same psychologically-shattered vein with ""Most of the Time,"" a song about convincing yourself that the harpy you were just jilted by never actually existed. And let's not forget those two Lou-less Velvets tunes. Get a load of the pathetic creatures that inhabit ""Oh! Sweet Nothin'""-- the poor sods that keep getting dumped out into the street, and who ""ain't got nothin' at all."" And ""Who Loves the Sun"" is another lovably sappy sad-sack lament from the Velvet Underground's Loaded period, with Doug Yule doing his effete Lou Reed impersonations. Laetitia Sadier's sexy French vocals are enticing as ever on ""Lo Boob Oscillator,"" an extraordinary early Stereolab composition centered around a simple E-A change. The six minute- long track stretches itself out over six minutes, gradually evolving into an amazingly compelling rhythmic continuum-- possibly the musical equivalent to the kind of incredible sex the characters of High Fidelity can only dream about. The Beta Band, a group I'm convinced is actually Gilbert O' Sullivan on Quaaludes fronting the remnants of the Stone Roses, articulate the soporific side effects of contemporary sexual frustration on ""Dry the Rain."" Laced with a little trip-hop and mesmerizing dobro slide guitar, the song begins at a trickling pace, then slowly and almost subliminally surges and builds in tiny increments, finally settling into the kind of pulsing repetition that turns you into a drooling, sexless vegetable. And of course, there are a few songs here that simply should've been scrapped. The annoying Jewel-wannabe warbling of Sheila Nichols on ""Fallen for You"" belongs alongside the hellish croaking of Aimee Mann. Elvis Costello turns in one of his worst tracks, revealing the soft- hearted simp side of himself as he plods his way through the tuneless Bacharach-influenced ""Shipbuilding."" And Smog, current standard-bearer of indie rock impotence, yawns through some lugubrious funeral music on ""Cold Blooded Old Times."" John Wesley Harding turns in a typical sorry-for-himself performance, in a song that sounds like every other one of his generic folky exercises in over-sensitive white-guy blandness. On ""I'm Wrong about Everything,"" he capitulates to his ball-breaking mate. Someone must've advised him that his music would be more readily accepted by the kids if he learned and applied this all important commercial equation: bad folk-pop + repetitive neo-trip-hop beats = frighteningly sudden commercial acceptance. Oh, and hey, let's not forget the ""soul"" portion of the soundtrack. ""Let's Get It On,"" covered here by High Fidelity character Jack Black, is a male fantasy irrelevant to the sexual mores of today-- it's a too-direct plea for sexual satisfaction that hasn't worked on any woman since the sexually-liberated '70s. This naïve song overlooks the deception, manipulation and mind games required to get laid consistently in the contemporary High Fidelity society. Overall, there's not that much to complain about on this one, though I'm sure there are a million other songs that would've been right for this soundtrack. Where's Iggy's ""Your Pretty Face is Going to Hell""? The Standells' ""Why Pick On Me""? The Rolling Stones' ""Bitch""? Oh well, no matter. Wisecracking, obsessive music nerds with women troubles, this is undoubtedly the soundtrack for you. Wait for the movie to come out on video, though, so you don't have to sit in a movie theater next to 20 or 30 other self-conscious, lonely chumps with problematic body odor.","John Cusack, drawing on all his previous experience playing comical losers who somehow end up\n\ scoring with hot chicks ...

Don't worry-- Like Someone In Love may be shorter than a sitcom, but there aren't any commercial breaks and 10 songs means 10 songs-- brevity is irrelevant. Core members Timothy Bracy and Peter Hoffman are a songwriting duo in the tradition of John Lennon and Paul McCartney, Bob Mould and Grant Hart, Rufus and Chaka Khan-- you get the picture. The differences between the two are audible-- Bracy is the down- homebody, Hoffman likes his guitars shaken, not stirred-- but neither is willing to sing above a dusty whisper. And in case any number of Replacements/ Uncle Tupelo (they're not as different as you think) disciples haven't proven that country is just fine with fuzzy guitars, Like Someone In Love will testify. Don't mistake this for a punk- rock hoedown though; the Mendoza Line is a strictly low- key affair. ""Wiretapping"" keeps a two- step beat going as melancholy seeps into the cryptic vocals. Before you know it, the two- step's done and the fuzz-fi peach ""I Know I Will Not Find The Words"" looks at like- minded lyrics through a pure pop lens. Bracy and Hoffman grew up in the Washington, D.C. area and the influence of such brainy popsters as Unrest and Velocity Girl is obvious and welcome. But there's no need to pigeonhole. Pop is just one element of many crammed onto this disc. The Mendoza Line seem to relish the thought that what they're doing is mostly mediocre. The name itself is the term used to describe when a baseball player falls below .200 (for those not familiar with baseball terminology, .200 really sucks). By doing so, they're guaranteeing themselves musical happiness, because while none of these 10 at-bats goes long enough to be a home run, there isn't a strikeout among them.","Though it appears that somebody made an error and that this EP is actually a 10- track long- player, the ...

Like Water for Chocolate,Common,by: Taylor M.

Not that my skin color actually deepened at some point in time, but I had a serious soul deficit. I thought Bach's ""Tocatta and Fugue"" had a thick bass line going on. Growing up in Oregon, not quite an ethnic mecca, my knowledge base of black culture was derived from reruns of Fat Albert (""You mean black people don't always say 'hey hey hey?'""). I couldn't have found my groove thing if you'd given me a map. One day, Richie from ""Happy Days"" walked up to me and said ""Damn!"" In short, if I'd been any whiter, I would have been clear. And then I discovered Aphex Twin. Alright, that was later. What I did find was my father's record collection. I found Miles. I found Thelonius. I found Jimi. I found the Godfather of Soul himself. Changes commenced immediately. Suddenly, I knew what the scenario was. Stakes was high. I was rhymin' wit' Biz. I found myself asking, ""What is this shaking phenomenon that is happening with my booty? I must say, this is almost as pleasurable as reading Dante!"" Of course, right around this point, it all went to hell in the rap world. Organics in hip-hop were replaced with electronic skitter and weak rhymes. Heart and soul were supplanted by speed freaks like Bone Thugs N' Harmony. Machismo and money superseded authenticity and love for music. ""Entrepreneurs"" like Master P began serving records like hamburgers, inundating the industry with clone rappers whose most impressive attributes were their ice and gold teeth. The outlook was bleak. Common's Like Water for Chocolate occupies a pivotal position in the current Black Renaissance that has emerged to rescue hip-hop music from decaying into a soulless nightmare. On the heels of seminal releases from the Roots and Mos Def, Like Water for Chocolate engenders an ongoing sense of hope in those who pine for a new school of black intellectuals, making heads bop in the process. Common pays apt tribute to the forefathers of black music throughout his opus, infusing tracks with an invigorating hybrid of cool jazz, bebop, funk, and hip-hop. Like Water for Chocolate is a musical gift from a man who clearly paid attention in ""How to Rock Rhymes 101,"" bringing a guest list that would make any MC drool. The entire album is produced by the talented ?uestlove of the Roots, who verifies that he has more than enough musical acumen to go around. Fellow Roots Black Thought and Rahzel provide raw backing vocals on ""Cold Blooded,"" a relentless rhythmic cacophony in which deep horns and concussive funk guitar rattle the brain harder than a Mack truck. ""Heat"" brings the spirit of battle raps back to the forefront, floating above an off-kilter drum loop by ?uestlove. On ""The 6th Sense,"" Common gets iller than Syphilis over an addictive track supplied by Gang Starr's DJ Premier. Cee-Lo's awe-inspiring vocal arrangements on ""A Song for Assata"" make it the most beautiful hip-hop piece by a rapper to appear in years. The list is seemingly unending, also featuring D'Angelo, Mos Def, MC Lyte and the Ummah production crew. Like the Roots' Things Fall Apart and Mos Def's Black on Both Sides, this record is certainly the product of much thought and work, but it's a labor of love. Right before our eyes, rappers like Common are laying the foundations for a closely-knit family of hip-hop zealots who eat, sleep and breathe positive, intelligent hip-hop-- a network of men and women who share a mutual respect and can address serious societal issues that plague us all (and wreck MCs) without coming off as pedantic or absurd. In 2000, this is just about as good as hip-hop gets.","Man, about five years ago I was so damn white. Not that my skin color actually deepened at some point ...

Keep your brain on Earth, and that worm will slowly imbibe, satiated. But launch your self-opinion into space, perhaps to some desert planet, and that worm will tear shit up like in ""Dune."" Ego can make a band say such things as, ""This one is a true marvel,"" or ""I don't feel awkward in saying that we never recorded a song that we didn't think was good,"" or ""Even the mistakes sound good,"" or ""It warms me every time I listen."" Ego can make a small band from Champaign-- a band that made only one good album-- say these things in the liner notes of their posthumous 2xCD retrospective. Consider for a minute that, not counting their forthcoming live video, Braid have released as much posthumous material as the Pixies. The Pixies! Keep in mind that Braid broke up seven months ago. This self-appointed importance clouds whatever actual musical merit Braid might've squeezed out over their nearly 100 career songs. Their relative unimportance shines when they set forth to cover actual landmark bands on the second volume of Movie Music. The rhythm section struggles to keep up with the Pixies' ""Trompe Le Monde"" as the guitarists trace the original in shaky, soulless lines. Braid's music never sounded effortless. And despite whatever theories William Gaddis may spout, knock-offs are never as good as the real thing. So here we're given 36 songs of pretentious hardcore-- which is a bit like making a punch tickle-- and circuitous songwriting dumped on top of overwrought drumming. It wasn't a working day for Braid unless they pounded out a three-minute burner with four time changes, eight drum fills, and lyrics chockablock with puns and maladroit wordplay. ""Club starlight where your eyes round brown and shine/ Darted out for the dimes in world record time,"" serves as example enough. Frontman Bob Nanna always seemed to favor searching for the Holy Grail of Homonym over striking a real emotional chord. And this was supposedly the archetypical ""emo"" band! Even Shaquille O'Neal and the guy from ""The Real World"" can figure out the poetic riddle of substituting ""reign"" for ""rain."" So excuse me if I find it difficult to file ""the current erode it/ I rode it"" and ""I'm an immobile mobile"" under brilliance. Volume One packs an EP's worth of killer songs. ""I'm Afraid of Everything,"" ""Forever Got Shorter,"" ""(Strawberry Ann) Switzerland,"" and ""Please Drive Faster"" swerve through enough unexpected hooks to warrant their collection. Yet, the last three songs Braid recorded portray a band stuck in a comfortable pop rut. Their tarots show that little would have come from another full-length album. ""You're Lucky to Be Alive"" might as well be the coda to ""Please Drive Faster."" Top it all off with Bob Nanna's horribly strained vocals and Chris Broach's Sen Dog-like screamed reiterations, and the water ceases boiling the dry ice, and the fake mystical fog passes. We're left with a mediocre hardcore pop band. The inexcusable slaughtering of two Smiths classics suitably ruins Volume Two. For good measure though, the songs are buried under sloppy early work and an even worse Billy Joel cover. There is absolutely no reason for a band to compile this sort of half-assed material. The mistakes don't sound good. Braid will always be a legend in the house show circuit, but the studio is another matter. A handful of great songs out of almost 100 begins to look a bit like a monkey-and-typewriter scenerio when it's all laid out in front of you. Braid would like to convince you they're the Jawbox of the late 90's, a mantle already taken by Burning Airlines. But as much as Bob Nanna tried to be J. Robbins, he will simply be remembered as a smudged carbon copy that fell behind the desk.","Ego is a giant, man-eating worm. Keep your brain on Earth, and that worm will slowly imbibe, satiated.

What do we know about Fatboy Slim? He's fat, he's a little boy, and he's slim. That's not much to go on, I know, but we'll have to work with it. One day, this slim boy of fat went to Claire's Boutique. There, he bought dangly, plastic earrings in the shape of glittery orange stars. He also bought three bottles of Hard as Nails brand nail-polish and a blue and white plaid scrunchie. Then he flew to England where he would spend the next few years. While hiking through an English forest in the early 90's, he lost one of his glittery plastic earrings. He feared it would never be seen again, and locked himself in his room for a week to mourn. In 1996, he was visited by a tall stranger dressed in black robes. The stranger said, ""I have spent many long years and traveled many long miles to seek you out, Mr. Fat. Long ago, I discovered an object of yours in the woods of Birmingshire."" The strange man extended his hand and revealed the plastic earring. ""I have come to return it to you, provided you do me one favor."" Well, Fatboy Slim wanted this earring very badly-- having been given to him by a clerk at Claire's Boutique, it held great sentimental value. ""I will do anything, anything at all,"" replied Fatboy Slim in earnest. ""You must become internationally recognized as the leader of a new movement of a style of music I have created, and you must give it a name."" Fatboy thought very hard about this for a moment. Then, he exclaimed: ""I will do it!"" The stranger went to his car, retrieving an 808, and returned to Fatboy Slim's doorstep. He pressed a button on the machine, and loud dance music began to pump forth. The room was soon filled with this music-- it combined the repetition of house music with loud beats sampled from old hip-hop tracks and rock music. Fatboy Slim loved what he heard and named the genre immediately. ""The beat is so big!"" And so, the beat is so big music-- or ""big beat,"" as it came to be called-- spread through England like wildfire. After the release of his first album, Better Living Through Chemistry, rumors circulated among the press that Fatboy Slim was actually a man named Norman Cook, who used to be in a band called the Housemartins. Fatboy Slim was unable to confirm or deny this rumor due to a serious concussion that left him an amnesiac. And so, it was taken as truth. Better Living Through Chemistry was picked up by Astralwerks in the U.S. and, riding on the success of the American electronica craze, the album became an instant hit. Shortly thereafter, Fatboy released his sophomore effort, You've Come a Long Way, Baby-- an inside reference to the stranger who had traveled so far to return the treasured earring-- which sold many thousands of copies. Fatboy was now recognized as an international superstar, and his hit songs, ""The Rockefeller Skank"" and ""Praise You,"" were played daily on MTV. But the mainstream electronica craze proved to be somewhat short-lived when the masses of teenagers turned their attention to KoRn and polished boy bands. At the turn of the new millennium, in March of the year 2000, Fatboy had not yet completed another album, but knew he had to release something, and fast! Who knew how much longer public interest might hold out? So, he decided to release a compilation of tracks in a DJ mix called On the Floor at the Boutique-- he felt that he could not name the album Claire's Boutique, because he might run into legal problems with the Beastie Boys-- and it was indeed an interesting moment in Fatboy Slim history. On the Floor at the Boutique compiled 19 songs, released together in a non-stop continuous mix. The record opened with a telling sample of one of the Jungle Brothers saying, ""I never worked a day in my life. I just laid back and let the big beat lead me,"" before kicking into the lead-off track. ""Apache"" by Michael Viner's Incredible Bongo Band, served as a great starter track-- it was an excellent, obscure 1968 number featuring lively horns and out-of-control psychedelic organ. Highlights from the album included the Spanish horn-tinged 1988 rap cut ""Because I Got It Like That"" by the Jungle Brothers, the 1991 straight house number ""Can You Feel It"" by CLS, the insane late-60s organ spaz-out/go-go funk hybrid of Psychedeliasmith's ""Give Me My Auger Back,"" and of course, the Fatboy Slim classic ""Michael Jackson."" In all, On the Floor at the Boutique proved itself a truly exceptional mix of obscure big beat tracks, and certainly, a ""block rockin'"" party album. Unfortunately, it came out about one year too late-- after big beat had enjoyed its moment in the sun and retired to Jacksonville, Florida. Ultimately, Boutique did serve as a worthy document of the entire big beat genre, and fans of the style found great pleasure in Fatboy's choice of tracks and ""mad mixing skillz."" In Pitchfork, the record drew comparisons to earlier big beat mixes, especially Bentley Rhythm Ace's superior two-disc installment of the UK-only FSUK compilation series. It was eventually decided that the album would be enjoyed most thoroughly by Fatboy Slim's die-hard fanbase and folks that wanted to own a small library of great big beat tracks, and that everyone else should pretty much ignore the thing. And that's precisely what happened!","Let's see. What do we know about Fatboy Slim? He's fat, he's a little boy, and he ...

We're All in This Alone,The Mendoza Line,by: Nick Mirov,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c42b13d197565213bec5/1:1/w_160/87ffb6a3.gif,2000-03-28 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5223-were-all-in-this-alone/,BarNoneMisraBarNoneMisra,"While lacing cheery melodies with poisonous lyrics has long been a successful pop music formula, it takes a particular breed of musician to elevate the juxtaposition to an art form all its own. Elvis Costello and the Smiths would probably be the best-known practitioners of this craft-- I'd even go as far as to establish a new microgenre of pessimistic pop. The likes of Quasi, Elliott Smith, and Magnetic Fields would easily make the list. Of course, given such lofty company, you couldn't expect the Mendoza Line to stand out in the crowd, but as also-rans go, you could do much, much worse; over the course of two full-lengths and two EPs, they've proven themselves as a band beholden of an uncanny songwriting intelligence, impressive lyrical aptitude, and the most defeatist attitude since Archers of Loaf imploded. On We're All in This Alone, the Mendoza Line makes a tremendous effort to implode as well. With its sloppy production, half-finished packaging, and comically hyperliterate liner notes detailing the band's many (fictionalized, or at least hyperbolized) interpersonal conflicts, the album reeks of studied underachievement. The sneering woman on the cover-- looking bored, drunk or both-- is the perfect visual analog to the album. The songs are still textbook Mendoza Line-- a mixture of buzzy indie-pop and slow-paced, country-tinged ballads-- but they sound as if the band banged them all out in half an afternoon, as if they couldn't wait to get back to moping around the around the house and bickering passive-aggressively with each other. But while the band attempts to come off as characters in a Neil LaBute play, they end up hitting closer to the High Fidelity mark; at heart, they're just overeducated music geeks most comfortable with expressing themselves through their songs. However hard they try to intentionally annoy-- be it with the 20-second digital hiccup that kicks off We're All in This Alone, their collective trademark style of penning astoundingly bitter lyrics like, ""Strategizing over lunch, the worst starfucker in the bunch/ Your eye for talent never yielded much/ Hey, it pains me watching you compete/ At the slut fair down on Barber Street/ But if you feel it makes your life complete, good luck""-- there's a tenderness and a pathos at the core of the band that elicits empathy. ""Idiot Heart"" is a prime example: starting off as Neutral Milk Hotel- esque fuzz-bash-pop with Margaret Maurice's detuned, bored vocals detailing a ""daily production of idiot hearts,"" the song splits itself in half by the end, exposing its saddened, empty insides as Maurice slowly croons, ""I am lost and the only way to find my way is to lose my way."" As the album progresses, the annoyance factor subsides considerably, and the production even improves a bit. Or maybe the songs just mold themselves better to the production. ""A Bigger City"" oozes midnight melancholy with a lone acoustic guitar and reverbed wistfulness; ""Yoko's in the Band"" is a pretty solid Yo La Tengo imitation with its joyous, roaring distortion and deadpan singing; and ""Where You'll Land"" ends the album with a heartbreaking swoon (""It's a lonely road that you're choosing to go/ And though it's exciting you'll always end up alone"") that morphs into a battery of mournful piano and horns, and then dissolves into the feedback ether. Begging to be loved, daring to be hated, We're All in This Alone succeeds despite itself, thanks to its clever lines and sticky melodies. Since Pavement packed it in, smug, self-absorbed slacker snobs everywhere have been without a band to call their own; to my fellow brothers and sisters, I say, look no farther than the Mendoza Line.","While lacing cheery melodies with poisonous lyrics has long been a successful pop music formula, it takes a particular breed ...

Beachwood Sparks,Beachwood Sparks,by: Judson Picco,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a23cb1335d7bf1698448/1:1/w_160/28a9188e.gif,2000-03-21 06:00:06,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/600-beachwood-sparks/,Sub Pop,"The bouncy bass and twanged-out country slide of ""Desert Skies,"" the Beachwood Sparks' gleeful opener, sent one key question coursing through my headphones and into my mind: ""Why isn't Robert Schneider's name all over this record?"" Amazing though it may be, the answer is simple: he's not involved. Turning the collage-ridden artwork over in my hands, I see no ""Robert"" or ""Schneider"" listed in the credits. I see butterflies, but no elephants. And the only ""6"" I can find is in Sub Pop's P.O. Box number. Even as I write this, I question my own literacy and sanity. ""Desert Skies"" sounds too shamelessly wrangled from Elephant 6's ""too country-ish"" outtake pile for it to not be related. I'm actually surprised the album isn't credited to a band called the Apples in Rodeo. Maybe it's the pastoral and escapist lyrics that caulk the deal most solidly: ""Desert skies kept me dry from the city rain/ The stars poked holes in the sky."" I mean, was I or was I not ragging on Great Lakes for similar lyrics about three months ago? But derivative and ultra-twee as this song may be, I just can't bring myself to dislike it. Like ""Seems So"" did for the Apples' Tone Soul Evolution way back in '97, ""Desert Skies"" hooks you solidly into the Sparks' comfortably non-insurgent and spaghetti-free western atmosphere. In typical fashion for this pedigree of pop music, the Beachwood Sparks lean inexplicably hard on some of psychedelia's uglier crutches. Both ""Ballad of Never Rider"" and ""Singing Butterfly"" plug songwriting gaps early on in the record, and each spends about two minutes on half an idea. In attempts at texture or creativity, the band employs backwards loops and gurgling synths on these tracks. But these sounds only serve to place the Beachwood Sparks on some far-westward leg of another band's mysterious and magical tour. And fear not; the ""ba-ba-ba"" quotient is filled handily on ""This is What It Feels Like,"" a Beach Boys throwaway that the Wilsons would have been wise enough to actually throw away. ""Sister Rose,"" however, finds the Sparks getting back to the business they're best at. Its Hammond organ and simple, punchy guitar combines with a lonesome, travel-weary lyric. Tasteful slide guitars even fuse Sloan with Marty Robbins for a manic pop moment or two. Later, the album slows to a mosey through ""New County,"" a tired, hopeful ballad that might have seduced us through the middle of Beck's Mutations (an artist they've fittingly opened for). It's just that pace that protects the Beachwood Sparks' credibility. Whereas E6-ers have notoriously flogged the cheap irony of embedding downtrodden lyricism into upbeat pop tunes, these guys get down more emotionally than musically, and manage to mean it. Lines like, ""Deep down inside, I thought I'd find/ Something more than the same canyon ride,"" strike chords of withering honesty when a patient tempo allows that twang of high-E to burrow into this bleached skull of a song. Sub Pop and the media alike have admitted to the derivative nature of the Beachwood Sparks' output without shame; comparisons as far-flung and high-falutin' as Gram Parsons and Buffalo Springfield do hold water. Nicer, though, is the fact that if current pop music is a race through a desert, the Beachwood Sparks are beating a certain collective of elephants to the shimmery oasis ahead.","The bouncy bass and twanged-out country slide of ""Desert Skies,"" the Beachwood Sparks' gleeful opener, sent one key question coursing ...

Dream All Day: The Best of...,The Posies,by: Al Shipley,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a0fdb1335d7bf169814e/1:1/w_160/af9b2307.gif,2000-03-21 06:00:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6426-dream-all-day-the-best-of/,DGCDGC,"""Best of"" collections are always awkward affairs for fans, who are naturally never quite satisfied with the song selection. The situation is intensified for bands of only modest mainstream success, whose completist fans will likely comprise 90% of the album sales for such a compilation. In the Posies' case, the label that underpromoted their albums and eventually dropped them is almost certainly using this release as one last excuse to screw the band over, distilling their major label output to one album so they can later delete the band's three proper titles from the catalog with little fanfare. That said, the Posies managed to take full advantage of one more opportunity to look back on the 10 years they gave to their label before they ran out of steam. Dream All Day is packed to nearly the maximum running time, offering a few songs from each of the band's DGC albums, and completely overlooking the indie- issued career bookends, Failure and Success. The record also contains several non-album tracks, along with some previously unreleased and otherwise hard- to-find material. The liner notes are lovingly detailed, complete with a chronology of the band's history and a ranting essay about how the Posies really ""mean it,"" whatever that's worth. Of course, such backpatting is to be expected of a band that announced their breakup, then recorded one last album, did a few final tours, and released a live album. Maybe they have a bet running with Braid as to who can turn out the most posthumous material. (We're still waiting on that Never Has Come for Us: Best of Braid 1993-1999 three-disc anthology, guys.) The collection kicks off, as did 1990's Dear 23, with ""My Big Mouth,"" a snappy, smartass tune that comes and goes long enough to trap its hook in your head without coming close to wearing out its welcome. But while that album seems to be the preference of most critics and fans, its other tracks simply don't live up to the insistence and quick payoff of the opening track. Recorded by legendary British hitmaker John Leckie, Dear 23 sported that confused, muddled sound that permeated most early '90s rock before grunge hit big and gave producers an easy sound to latch onto. The hooks were there, but the acoustic-and-electric guitar strumming and glossy harmonies make it relatively toothless compared to the Posies later work. If only Leckie could have done for the Posies' second album what he did for Radiohead's. By the time 1993's Frosting on the Beater came around, the aforementioned grunge thing, compounded with their vicinity to Seattle, had become an unavoidable direction. But instead of tossing out their pop smarts for more attitude, they settled for writing better songs and letting Gumball's Don Fleming add the necessary heaviness to the production. The result was a modest hit in this collection's title track, ""Dream All Day."" On ""Solar Sister,"" Jon Auer unleashes one of the most jawdropping guitar solos of the period, perfectly locking in with the dynamic drums and bringing the song's already catchy melody to unexpected heights. After a detour into ""Going, Going, Gone,"" a fine contribution to the otherwise mediocre Reality Bites soundtrack, the compilation proceeds to short change the album that got the Posies dropped from DGC, 1996's Amazing Disgrace. The press for the record stubbornly insisted that it was the loud, raw work of a band fresh off their tour bus. The meager selections here follow suit, offering the crunching but still hummable singles ""Please Return It"" and ""Ontario,"" as well as the band's absolute low- point, the wanton angst of ""Everybody is a Fucking Liar."" Meanwhile, the whole of Amazing Disgrace is by far the most varied and interesting Posies album. The fanboy in me weeps for the grand ""Song #1,"" the supremely rocking ""Grant Hart,"" and the small, eloquent ""The Certainty."" At least Dream All Day does include ""Throwaway,"" one of the strongest tunes in the Posies catalog, despite the song's uncharacteristically tuneless introductory guitar solo. Also salvaged is the outtake ""Sad to be Aware,"" which sounds way too good to have been left off Disgrace in favor of filler like ""Broken Record."" If Dream All Day indicates anything, it's that the Posies probably deserve a little better than the footnote status they've been granted in retrospect of their 10 years as an entity. While the elements that comprised their sound were not so unique in and of themselves, it's hard to think of many other bands of the past decade who combined smart, subtle lyrics with traditional pop/rock dynamics and pitch-perfect male harmonies. That's gotta count for something, eh?","""Best of"" collections are always awkward affairs for fans, who are naturally never quite satisfied with the song selection. The ...

Expensive Shit/He Miss Road,Fela Kuti,by: Paul Cooper,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc0fc0084474cd0c29dc/1:1/w_160/76113133.gif,2000-03-21 06:00:04,Global,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11769-expensive-shithe-miss-road/,MCA,"Afro-beat pioneer Fela Kuti was never more pissed off at his homeland's military government than in 1974. In that year, the Nigerian police persistently raided his compound, the Kalkuta Republic, as a result of Kuti's growing public opposition to the ruling junta. Having beaten a narcotics charge, the Lagos police swarmed Kuti's home in an attempt to plant a big fat joint on the premises and arrest him for possession. Quick in thought as well as funk, Fela swallowed the joint. The on-looking officers promptly pushed him into the back of their wagon. Their immaculate plan was to wait for Kuti to dump his morning load for proof. They would then test the turd for THC and, according to the cunning plan, throw Kuti in the choky for a very long time, effectively ridding the Nigerian police of their number one gadfly. Though raised in what might be termed a middle-class environment, Fela Kuti was very much a people's champion, and his famous testing of authority was what saved him in the end-- he was able to exchange his stool for a less-enhanced specimen. Fela Kuti had been an attentive apprentice when he jammed with some of James Brown's band members in a Los Angeles recording studio in 1969. But sadly, Kuti failed to secure the proper work Visas, and after four days, the Immigration and Nationalization Service threw him out of the country. Of course, Kuti had already gotten what he needed-- James Brown's funk and some Black Panther literature. He would turn his old band into a JB's-style groove machine, re-name it the Africa 70, and bring it on to the worms in power. 1975's Expensive Shit is paired on this new MCA reissue with He Miss Road, another Kuti release from that same year. The album's centerpiece, lead-off and title track was undoubtedly one of the most influential tracks to the Afro-beat movement, and to artists like the Talking Heads, who experimented with similar tribal rhythms on Fear of Music and their landmark album, 1980's Remain in Light. Its complex, bongo- centric percussion is tempered with funk guitar, discordant piano, and brass eruptions. And when, six minutes into the semi-improvisational, instrumental jam, Kuti awakens with a yowl and begins his political rant, he changes music forever. ""Water No Get Enemy,"" Expensive Shit's second track, is more philosophical than political, postulating the motion of water as a metaphor for human interaction and the rhythms of society. The music is lighter-- almost poetic-- but no less moving. After these two extended, 10+-minute affairs come three more, in the form of Kuti's follow-up album, He Miss Road. The title track here is a less strident affair than either of the cuts off Expensive Shit. Lyrically, Kuti comments on people's stupidity; he mocks an incompetent lawyer for handing over his brief to the prosecution, and tells of a band that turns up at a colony for the blind and the deaf. After a squall of noise, a summery, psychedelic groove settles the mood until finally giving way to an ambient organ. Fela's tenor saxophonist, Igo Chico, surpasses all his other performances on this disc during ""Monday Morning in Lagos,"" which is up there with the Kinks' ""Waterloo Sunset"" for magical evocations of cities. Chico's glimmering lines perfectly represent the rays of the rising sun while Kuti's Yoruban vocals add the necessary otherworldliness to the track. The disc closes as it begins-- with bombs. On ""It's No Possible,"" drummer Tony Allen imposes a polyrhythmic torrent that locks in the rest of the Africa 70. They have no choice but to grab hold of the music and further jazz it up. Fela's lyrics denouncing those who break promises effectively counterpoint Africa 70's joyous riot of uplifting funk. But then, that was Fela. Always contradictory-- a champion of women's rights who kept a harem of dozens of girls (pictured on the front cover of Expensive Shit). But there's no denying the guy's blatant courage in the eye of government, or the legacy of his musical vision. With DJs steadily picking up on Francois Kervorkian's championing of Fela Kuti's work, it's all too easy to get caught up in Kuti's discography. Start with Expensive Shit and don't miss the road onward.",,8.5,
Gung Ho,Patti Smith,by: Michael Sandlin,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a4775e6ef9596932089f/1:1/w_160/dc434749.gif,2000-03-21 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7275-gung-ho/,AristaArista,"Ever since witchy punk diva Patti Smith came out of retirement in 1988, her music has been mired in a serious creative stasis. True, she's endured some personal tragedies along the way-- namely, the untimely death of both her husband and brother. But the real tragedy, I'd say, is her growing inability to write a decent song. Hobnobbing with hip celebs at trendy Manhattan bistros may indeed be a hard-won privilege she deserves. But regular indulgence in the archetypal fruits of success also brings to mind an age-old Faustian trade-off: she'll be financially stable, globally worshipped, and able to enjoy all the perks acclaimed rock legends are showered with, but she'll never again be visited by the same demons responsible for inspiring her best work. By best work, I mean, of course, 1975's Horses, and songs like ""Pissing in the River,"" from Radio Ethiopia, and ""Rock n' Roll Nigger,"" off 1978's brilliant Easter. This exemplary stuff was obviously fueled by true starving-artist anger, and borne out of a life ""outside of society,"" as she once sang about. Yep, she regressed from being the 20th Century female answer to Baudelaire to a pretentious, incoherent Ginsbergian babbler. Instead of lines like, ""Jesus died for somebody's sins but not mine,"" and ""Baby was a black sheep/ Baby was a whore,"" we're now offered such lackluster toss-offs as, ""In the garden of consciousness/ In fertile mind there lies the dormant seed."" Call this a sign of ""maturity,"" if you must, but once most singer/songwriters begin regarding themselves as serious ""poets,"" their work slips into a steady decline. On Gung Ho-- much like 1996's Gone Again and 1999's Peace and Noise-- Patti and the band aren't exactly bad, but they hardly rock like they did back in '77. And, honestly, has anyone understood a word Patti's written since 1979? In recent years, she's not only taken to schoolmarmish Catholic moralizing, but she also tends to write more songs overloaded with vague moon-child spiritualism and ridiculously ornate neo-Biblical language. And as Patti's ideas dwindle, her faithful band follows suit with typically bland, unchallenging classic rock gestures. Sure, Lenny Kaye is still capable of penning a clever riff here and there, but mostly, he just follows the notes and pockets his paycheck. Guitarist Oliver Ray, Smith's sometime/former love interest, half-handles some of the songwriting chores, but is absolutely inconsequential as a backing instrumentalist. As expected, there's very little stylistic variation in these new songs-- two middle-of-the-road guitars, a competent bass, and lethargic drums interact with predictable results. At least (as with any Patti Smith album) we're offered the requisite Tom Verlaine guitar solo. The enigmatic former Television axeman never fails to satisfy during the brief space he's allotted. And of course, Smith loves to be taken seriously as a poet, so I'll pretend to be Harold Bloom and deal with her so-called poetry as if I were analyzing the great works of the Western Canon. On ""Grateful,"" I stopped paying attention as soon as she employed that hackneyed ""ship in a bottle"" metaphor: ""Like a ship in a bottle/ Held up to the sun/ Sails ain't going nowhere."" Uh, is that anything like time in a bottle? A message in a bottle, maybe? ""Upright Come"" is a condescending Jim Morrison-esque sermon to the lumpen rabble. See, Patti ""Moses"" Smith looks down upon you and I as entranced, mystified mortals desperately in need of her spiritual guidance counseling: ""Awake, people, arise!/ Fortune is falling like tears from the skies/ Open your eyes!"" Ah, blow me, Patti! How's that for a Harold Bloom impression? ""Glitter in Their Eyes"" is Smith's bitter rant against the rampant materialism of twenty-something dot-commers: ""Children, children everywhere/ Selling souls for souvenirs.../ Our sacred stage has been disgraced/ They'll trade you up/ Trade you down/ Your body's a commodity."" Accusing the young 'uns of selling out too easily to the Man, eh? I can't say I disagree with her, but let's face it-- you don't hear Patti mentioning piggy capitalist exploiters like her longtime corporate sugar daddy, Clive Davis. ""New Party"" is another weak, one-woman attempt at sparking a worldwide uprising: ""We got to get off our ass or get burned/ The world's troubles are a global concern."" So, what're we supposed to do, fly to Kosovo and hand out band-aids? But no, ol' Peacenik Patti explains that, in the end, all you really need is ""Love, brother."" Shit, somebody call Michael Jackson and Bob Geldof-- Patti wants to change the world with love! Sorely missing that long-extinguished flame of youth, the more she tries to seem anti-establishment, the more she sounds like a boring, bitchy old folkie. True, Smith can still be a great live performer. Unfortunately, though, she's begun to lose relevance as an original counter-cultural voice in the vanguard of American rock. I mean, there's a reason audience members scream out requests for ""Piss Factory"" instead of hollering, ""Just play something from Gung Ho!"" Creatively, Smith's not doing much more than keeping up appearances and proving she still has a pulse. Yes, she has yet to become a blatant nostalgia act like the Who or the Sex Pistols. But still, when you listen to Gung Ho and forget about myth, legacy, mystique and all that crap, you have to wonder-- does Patti Smith really matter anymore?","Ever since witchy punk diva Patti Smith came out of retirement in 1988, her music has been mired in a ...

Generally speaking, the boredom factor increases proportionately as a song lengthens. There are some notable exceptions to this rule, but it's only the truly gifted band that can pull off an epic without sounding presumptuous or sedated. As Six by Seven proved on their last outing, the somnolent The Things We Make, they're definitely not one of those bands. Wisely, on The Closer You Get, Six by Seven shun any epic aspirations, opting instead to streamline their sound. Gone are the interminable, lazy guitar noodling of ""European Me."" Petals are pressed to the floor. Guitars mimic helicopters. Drums resemble a bumpy subway ride. And frontman Chris Olley sounds positively rabid beneath the raging volume. No longer finding solace in drawn-out detachment, Six by Seven are now focused and agitated. The results are immediate, and, at the very least, demand to be heard. From the explosive opening monolith, ""Eat Junk Become Junk,"" Six by Seven bristle with an intensity that would have been unthinkable on their previous LP. ""Sawn Off Metallica T-shirt"" mines a cutthroat fearlessness, the chainsaw guitars and thumping bassline threatening to erupt at any moment. Even when the lyrics disappear altogether or become indecipherable under the layers of noise, as on ""Another Love Song,"" the band exudes an unmistakable menace. This newfound attitude doesn't always serve them well, though. The melodic aspirations of ""Don't Wanna Stop"" and ""Slab Square"" are swept away in a tuneless, guitar maelstrom-- surprising when considering they're two of only four tracks on The Closer We Get produced by the untouchable John Leckie. Strangely, other tracks simply fail to reach their potential for lack of production. Relying on light guitar plucking and a touch of feedback, ""England and a Broken Radio"" is so slight it leaves you wishing Six by Seven had parked their social commentary at the door. All told, The Closer You Get, winds up with more bluster than substance. These guys have the roar, now they just need to temper the assault and give the melodies some breathing room. Too often they allow the noise to compensate for underdeveloped material. However, given their rapid progress and attitude change, this misstep is both understandable and forgivable. For the time being, their remarkable stylistic transition is enough for us to keep listening.","There's a thin line between riveting and boring.

The Death of Quickspace,Quickspace,by: Ryan Schreiber,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Founder</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a1b89d034d5c69bf2a11/1:1/w_160/090e31f5.gif,2000-03-21 06:00:01,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6603-the-death-of-quickspace/,MatadorMatador,"Quickspace have never been known for their instant accessibity or technical instrumental prowess. Their 1997 self-titled debut presented an incredibly sloppy band whose sometimes epic songs carried enough personality and originality to transcend their inability to hold music together. The drums were offbeat, the guitars were out of tune, and vocalists Tom Cullinan and Nina Pascale weren't going to win any awards for pitch. Precious Falling showed a much more proficient Quickspace willing to add more layers to their generally simple song structures. Sadly, the album was padded with a bunch of bizarre, experimental filler which failed to interest anyone. On their third album, the band fronted by Th' Faith Healers' Tom Cullinan are in full form. The Death of Quickspace offers a new batch of nine of the band's trademark subtlety and inexplicably seductive melodies. Not that you'd know it from the way the record opens. ""The Lobbalong Song"" fades in quickly, fades out, then fades back in with uncertainty. This weirdness is followed by an unexpected jolt from Nina Pascale's heavily-distorted Cockney banshee wail. She shrieks with an intense conviction-- whatever she's yelling about, she means it. ""The Lobbalong Song"" is by far the record's most abrasive moment, but by sequencing it as the opening cut, Quickspace are laying exactly who they are on the table. Initially, Pascale's aggravated cry grates, but midway through the track, the melody becomes strangely irresistable. Then, suddenly, the gentle picking of electric guitar strings introduces the album's dark highlight, ""They Shoot Horse Don't They,"" over a naive pop drumbeat. Over seven minutes, the song works up to a frenzied climax, piling on layers of distorted guitar-pounding and howling keyboard effects. Quickspace are out on tour right now with Yo La Tengo, and it's not hard to see why. In many respects, Quickspace are a more rhythmically-oriented Yo La Tengo. The band's melodies are always passionate and engaging, but surprisingly simple. Whether cranking out a three-and-a-half chord, angular sans-vocal screamer like ""Munchers No Munchers,"" or the psychedelic electric slide guitar ballad ""The Rose,"" their songs are inescapably catchy without resorting on cloying twee pop tendencies, conventional pop song structures, or even hooks at all. Yes, this is pop music, but not at all in a traditional sense. It should be amazing that Quickspace can stretch these raw, basic songs out to over five (and sometimes ten) minutes without becoming boring, but it's not-- that's largely due to the amount of variation their songs contain. On the winding, 10+ minute ""Climbing a Hill,"" the lyrics-- divided into two seperate vocal parts-- bounce over minor-key resignation. A few minutes later, we're thrust head-first into an elaborate and expertly delivered four-minute guitar part that switches from delicate picking and sliding to Kaplan-esque steel-scraping buzz. The album ends somewhat strangely, with the violin-laced instrumental ""Lob It"" and the 30-second-long punk riff, ""4."" I can't say I'd have gone out like that, but then again, I'm not a talented five-piece with a history of great albums behind me. Still, a track like the standout pop ballad, ""Gloriana,"" with its beautifully produced, thick, multi-tracked vocal harmonies, and exploding, mangled guitar would serve as the ultimate closer to any album. But the end songs, weird as they may be, are still great for what they try to accomplish, and when the disc stops spinning after its 45-minute duration, we're left with an album that finally realizes the potential that has always surrounded this band's records. I think it's only gonna get better from here.","Quickspace have never been known for their instant accessibity or technical instrumental prowess.

Treader,Spring Heel Jack,by: Taylor M. Clark,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a523c0084474cd0c065f/1:1/w_160/3a47ea28.gif,2000-03-21 06:00:00,Jazz,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7436-treader/,Thirsty Ear,"Isn't it kind of alarming that the once cutting edge electronic subgenre of drum-n-bass has now nearly completely resigned its role in the musical world to fodder for car commercials? It's getting to the point that the only notion that traditional drum-n-bass inspires in me is the sudden urge to rush out and take a Pontiac for a test drive. Lamentably, Spring Heel Jack were one of the few reputable drum-n-bass acts to allow the man to devour their soul by signing to Island back in the mid 90's and utilizing the big corporate dollar by releasing two strikingly mediocre albums, 68 Million Shades and Busy, Curious, Thirsty. Both of these can now be discovered in dollar bins throughout this great land of ours. ""Taylor,"" you may ask. ""Is there any one aspect of drum-n-bass which has brought about its impending demise?"" Why, yes. I'm glad you asked. The answer is that stupid two-step beat which is the foundation of your archetypal drum-n-bass track. Regardless of how much bleeping and rapid-fire drum machine skitter is layered over this rhythm, it all still sounds fundamentally the same after a certain point. Incidentally, that point was late 1998. To its credit, Treader kicks off with ""Is,"" a nice serving of sample-funk which slices up intriguing beats and serves them with an electric garnish in the temperament of a good Clifford Gilberto or Coldcut track. Unfortunately, ""Is"" is a lonely, deserted island amidst a vast 73 minute ocean of prototypical drum-n-bass, inundated with two-step. Even tracks like ""Toledo"" and ""Winter"" which start out promisingly enough eventually sink under the weight of the ubiquitous two-step. As the genre goes, Treader exemplifies skilled production and attention to detail, but falters in the innovation department. The digital creations concocted by Spring Heel Jack are nicely textured and evolve naturally to a degree, but never manage to escape repetitiveness. Merely altering the drum sounds used to make the same beat from song to song doesn't qualify as sufficient modification of the genre. Also grazed by Treader is avant-garde symphonic electronica which fails to spark much interest, as it's comprised simply of linked chords which seem totally incongruous. ""More Stuff No One Saw"" and ""Climb Ev'ry Mountain"" could have been stellar with a finer touch of rhythmic variety, yet ultimately end up repetitive. In all, the typical drum-n-bass explored on Treader becomes rather inane somewhere around the seventh minute of each song. Those who'd harbored a fondness for drum-n-bass back in the day are hereby duly notified that the genre has not expired, but mutated. The future of electronica is being realized by those like Amon Tobin and the kind people at Ninja Tune, whose blood is infused with the irrepressible seeds of innovation.","Isn't it kind of alarming that the once cutting edge electronic subgenre of drum-n-bass has now nearly completely resigned ...

Community Music,Asian Dub Foundation,by: Nick Mirov,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a1215e6ef95969320103/1:1/w_160/22c73eed.gif,2000-03-20 06:01:40,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/321-community-music/,LondonLondon,"To quote Emma Goldman, ""If I can't dance, I don't want your revolution."" The old anarchist revolutionary was actually taking a stand against behavioral fascism, but modern pop music has misinterpreted her in the best possible way. These days, the smart sonic insurgents employ the old bait-and-switch on their audiences, kicking out a booming beat to capture ears and rears alike before dropping the science on them. But this is hardly necessary when the message is melded with the music as eloquently and seamlessly as Asian Dub Foundation does it; in their collective hands, the protest song is not only alive and well, but thriving and evolving. As much musically innovative as they are politically active, Asian Dub Foundation's sound is a melting pot of jungly breakbeats, dub and dancehall flavors, and snaky guitar lines that morph from rock riffs into Indian sitars and back again, every element of which manages to stand out in the mix as often as it complements the others. Rafi's Revenge, the only other album of theirs readily available in the U.S., may have featured slightly better songwriting, but its thin, sterile drum-n-bass-style production detracted from its impact. In contrast, Community Music fills the empty spaces with exotic atmospherics that tickle the ear while the thicker, beefed-up production firmly plants a boot in it. I remember reading a review of Primal Scream's Exterminator that praised the band's newfound political anger and snarkily nicknamed the album ""The Battle of London."" This is complete and utter bullshit. Compared to Community Music, Exterminator is a slick, empty style exercise, reducing powerful rhetoric to incoherent sound bytes that mostly serve as accouterments to Kevin Shields' fancy-schmancy noisemaking. The real British analog to Rage Against the Machine is undeniably Asian Dub Foundation, but that's still being unfair to both groups. Rage's blustery, in-your-face punk anger is uniquely American-- as much a hindrance as an asset; Asian Dub Foundation's sublimation of their discontent beneath their interest in getting people moving on the dance floor is, well... pretty British. Where Zack de la Rocha hisses and screams, Deedar sports a mush-mouthed dancehall phrasing that sounds at once laid-back and urgent; Chandrasonic is as adept a guitar technician as Tom Morello, deploying riffs that sear and snake or disappearing into clouds of delay noise. And instead of bleak teeth-gnashing and finger-pointing at The Man, Asian Dub Foundation sport a particularly positivist, unity-building vibe that in the hands of lesser artists would become peace-and-love sappiness or multicultural-studies didacticism, but the band makes sure to keep the edges rough while still making protest seem like celebration. If Community Music is flawed in any way, it's that at 70+ minutes, it can be an exhausting listen. Asian Dub Foundation jump out of the gate with a furious triple dis of Cool Britannia nostalgia (""Real Great Britain""), historical revisionism (""Memory War""), and police corruption (""Officer XX"") before settling down into more uplifting grooves, praising their immigrant ancestors on ""New Way New Life"" and urging listeners to get into the ""Collective Mode."" Unfortunately, the energy level begins to sag just as your pulse rate rises; ""Crash"" and ""The Judgement"" lean a bit too heavily on mellow reggae styles, and Deedar cedes vocal duties to spoken-word samples and other singers with varying success. While A. Sivanandan's speechifying on ""The Colour Line"" gets a bit heavy-handed, ""Taa Deem"" succeeds brilliantly on the strength of the sampled vocals of the late Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan meshing with fierce, metallic guitar distortion and impossibly booming percussion. ""Truth Hides"" slinks along for a while on the strength of squeaky alien ambience and an enchantingly dark chorus, but it can't quite justify its eight-minute length. For all its rough spots, though, Asian Dub Foundation maintains the delicate balance between raising consciousness and shaking booty; the message never gets preachy, and the music can certainly stand well on its own, as it does on the instrumental coda ""Scaling New Heights."" Community Music is incredibly ambitious, and amazingly, it delivers everything it promises and then some. It's a revolution, and you can dance to it.","To quote Emma Goldman, ""If I can't dance, I don't want your revolution."" The old anarchist revolutionary was ...

Califone EP,Califone,by: Mark Richardson,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a4df9d034d5c69bf3181/1:1/w_160/a061ca6c.gif,2000-03-14 06:01:40,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1241-califone-ep-1999/,Road Cone,"Califone's first self-titled EP bore the scars of Red Red Meat's previous album; like the Meat's There's a Star Above the Manger Tonight, Califone's first EP surrounded the actual songs with walls of sharp, rusty percussion and blasts of unadulterated noise. The sonic hybrid on both records made for an engaging listen, focusing attention on the chunks of melody that staggered from the wreckage. While I found both albums stunning in their execution, rock fans turned off by more abrasive music were left scratching their heads and plugging their ears. Admirers of more traditional structures will be glad to know that the second Califone EP finds the focus returning to Tim Rutili's powerful songwriting, a move that's also certain to please admirers of the band. Remnants of the older records' exotic production remain on this brief five-song record. The opening ""Electric Fence"" features booming, heavily manipulated drums in addition to a bagful of indiscernible sound fragments bouncing dub-style off the studio walls. But these flourishes are backgrounded often enough to reveal what is arguably the most beautiful song Rutili has written. The song's wistfully sad melody, tragic, descending piano line and impressionistic word fragments (""lit a blue tip match off the white of your eye"") turn profound when considered as a whole. The next three songs feature more subdued studio work. ""St. Martha Let It Fold"" has an eerie melody that draws heavily from rural depression-era music. ""Beneath the Yachtsman"" starts with clattering Meat-style beats before morphing into a nugget of exhausted soul music, complete with quivering gospel piano. And the guitar-and-voice-only ""Don't Let Me Die Nervous"" is a song halfway between Appalachian folk and Bob Dylan's ""It's Alright Ma, I'm Only Bleeding,"" with an intensity to match. The closer, ""Dock Boggs,"" is named after an artist featured prominently on the Anthology of American Folk Music box set, and it serves as a kind of restatement of thesis. Combining a melody adapted from one of Boggs' songs with rattling percussion and buzzing electronics, ""Boggs"" again captures that out-of-time feel where studio technology smashes up against classic American songwriting. Califone have a knack for artfully blending these disparate worlds.",,8.3,
My Solo Project,Mates of State,by: Spencer Owen,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c3d913d197565213be0f/1:1/w_160/0f24339c.gif,2000-03-13 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5147-my-solo-project/,Omnibus,"So, I was talking to the indie rock fanatics at school recently about good live shows, and I namedropped a few that I knew they'd recognize to bring them into my world of general agreement. Then, to finally win them over, I said, ""I've heard that the Mates of State are great live."" Bam! I'd dropped a big one on them: an obscure, somewhat local band they'd never heard of, that they were sure to love, and that they would be able to thank me for after hearing them. Smooth move. ""Really? Do they play around here? What are they like?"" The obligatory follow-up questions. My response: ""Well, they're a two-person line-up... organ and drums, a girl and a boy..."" And just as quickly as I'd won them over, they turned against me. ""That sounds like Quasi. Quasi rip-offs!"" I pleaded with them to hear my side: ""No, not at all, really! They're nothing like each other!"" But to no avail. They walked away laughing, leaving the phrase, ""They can't be as good as Quasi!"" echoing repeatedly in my ears. I was hurt. Permanently scarred. Traumatized. So I'd like to think of this as my therapy review. Sure, the Mates of State have a similar line-up to Quasi. And yeah, they make irresistible pop music, too. But that's it! The similarities end there! So now that you've read this far, why not continue, even if it's only out of pity? The healing can now begin. Mates of State are a pop duo based in San Francisco. They are half-male and half-female. Their halves are named Kori Gardner and Jason Hammel. And as luck would have it, they are, shall we say, romantically entangled. Gardner rhapsodizes vocally (as well as through her Yamaha organ) while Hammel simultaneously shares vocal duties and masterfully handles the many tempo changes on his drumsticks. Meanwhile, the mood of the record, whether it be bittersweet or rapturous, is solely melodically based, with carefree and nonsensical lyrics accompanying. The Mates of State's debut album, My Solo Project, has two key elements. The first is the gleeful, sincere enthusiasm. There's more of it here, in true and genuine form, than could be located on any co-ed high school cheerleading squad. The duo's vocals explode harmonizing into the air, and though these two aren't the best singers in the world, they want to sing and they're gonna sing, damnit! The most sincere moment here comes with ""Everyone Needs an Editor,"" when they each trade off singing the lines, ""I color the sky with you/ I let you choose the blue."" You can hear their eyes meet in a gaze of gory love. At times, Gardner and Hammel almost seem like they're trying to surpass each other and miss the note, and these moments stand out-- a few even border on cringe-worthy. But when the awkwardness passes, we forgive the smitten couple anyway because they're so damn cute. The second key element is the song structure. Each song has multiple parts, and they're each virtually always in a different key, with a different hook, in a different tempo. These hooks could easily have stood on their own, but that didn't satisfy these Mates. Instead, they chose to pack each song with the punch of two or three, playing with your expectations. On ""What I Could Stand For,"" they sing the lovely refrain of ""And I won't pass you by"" the traditional four times, until the music comes to a dead halt and briefly pauses before they reiterate for emphasis and move on to the third part of the song. This 12-track album basically only has 10 songs. The first and last are total throwaways. Thankfully, they're at the beginning and end, and don't disturb the flow. But it makes one wonder why they're included. The first track is a 50 second cover of... the ""Cheers"" theme song, sung by a relative of Gardner's on a boombox when she was in her early teens. Badly, I might add. It's the same basic deal with the closer; trust me, you don't need to hear about it. But aside from these easily avoided blunders, My Solo Project manages to remain consistently high in quality within its tight 34-minute length. It's unique, fun, and worth your time. And it certainly sounds nothing like Qu--","So, I was talking to the indie rock fanatics at school recently about good live shows, and I namedropped a ...

The jewel case's back insert depicts a small girl standing alone on a beach, surrounded only by sand, sky, and water. They're fitting images for the record-- One on One is an album of alienation, desolation, emptiness, and uneasiness. Listening to One on One is like standing alone on an ever-mutating alien landscape. Indecipherable noises echo in the distance, subtlety modulating and shifting into other sounds. These hardly noticeable changes, which permeate every track, create a nauseating undertone, making the record a truly unsettling listen. It's heightened by the fact that many of the One on One's sounds don't seem ""right."" The dense rhythm on ""Sparrow"" never fully settles into a steady beat. The melody on ""Schmyk"" begins as a simple, minimalistic tune in a minor key. Then another melody, slightly out of tune with the original, enters the mix, establishing its own complimenting tune. But before the track gets stagnant, the second melody frantically shifts its tonal center, leading to some of the most fucked up harmonies this side of a bear quartet. These unexpected changes leave the listener lost. But never bored. Another contributing factor to the album's otherworldly tone is Passamonte's extra-terrestrial vocals. On ""Ms. Meteo,"" Passamonte sounds like Patti Smith filtered through a vocoder. She sprinkles barely coherent whispers throughout One on One, most of which wind up buried at the very back of the mix. But the farther Passamonte's voice drifts into the background, the more intently you find yourself listening, trying to decipher her cryptic murmurs. One on One has led me to two conclusions: 1) Chantal Passamonte is fucked up. 2) Music can be nauseating in a good way. And while the album may be a bit abrasive at times, it's abundantly clear that Passamonte intended it to be that way-- it's not pretty, and that's what makes it good.","The insert for One on One, the new offering from Mira Calix (aka female DJ Chantal Passamonte), depicts a silver-eyed ...

Broken by Whispers,Trembling Blue Stars,by: S.

He does hold a venerable position in the pantheon of twee-pop, having fronted the Field Mice, the late-'80s missing link between the Smiths and Belle & Sebastian. But as always seems the case with these sensitive fey-pop types, Wratten's never quite gotten over the girl, and his music remains as resolutely precious now as ever. This is both good and bad news. For devotees to the softly sung, broken heart aesthetic, Wratten's mournful nuggets from the old- school of twee are just what the doctor ordered. For those whom the twee phase has come and gone, Wratten's pleasant work merely betrays a stylistic cul-de-sac. In either case, Wratten's mastery of the form and elder statesman status merit acknowledgment. The man can write a catchy tune, and what's more, his work with the Trembling Blue Stars evinces a greater appreciation and grasp of texture. Working closely with producer Ian Catt, noteworthy for his work with St. Etienne, Broken by Whispers shimmers and glitters, alternating from hushed ambience to ringing guitar and synth interplay. Opening with lingering bird chirps and a softly picked acoustic guitar, ""Ripples"" soon erupts into emotively detached guitar pop reminiscent of '80s balladeering. Wratten intones: ""I want to write songs about/ Two strangers starting out."" Things get pastoral on ""She Just Couldn't Stay,"" with soft percussive effects and strings accompanying a smart melody and a chorus that laments, ""The person you were/ I know you're not her."" Curses upon the cruel woman that broke Wratten's sensitive soul, for confining his wretched lyrical muse. ""Sometimes I Still Feel the Bruise"" is a touching slice of new wave synth-pop, and on ""To Leave It Now,"" Wratten enlists a French chanteuse to realize his passive mixture of melancholy and melody. The songs on Broken by Whispers are resolutely catchy, simply bogged down by tried-and-true heart-on-the-sleeve sentiment. It's too late in the game to entertain the notion that Wratten might venture off his beaten path. But for folks smitten with heartbreak, it's just as well.","He may tremble and be perpetually blue, but Robert Wratten is certainly no star. He does hold a venerable position ...

Airbrushings of buxom valkyries heaving halberds take up no space at MOMA. ""Beastmaster"" failed to garner Mark Singer a single Oscar nod. Wilt Chamberlain's tomahawk dunks come to most people's mind before his role as Bombata in ""Conan the Destroyer."" A simple method for avoiding small talk with the businessman squeezed into the seat next to you on flights is to hunch over a 900-page fantasy epic. Answer his inquisitions with, ""Excuse me, but I'm reading 'Path of Daggers,' the eighth volume of Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time series."" It works like garlic breath. While we may occasionally enjoy an escape into Arrakis or Ringworld, they're hardly worlds worth living in. The Renaissance Faire is only open one week a year for a reason. Likewise, listening to Mary Timony's twelve-sided die and aromatic candle companion piece, Mountains, is like eating every meal at Medieval Times. Timony weaves a sparse tapestry of piano, chiming electric guitar, bells, and gong-like percussion into castle-pop as two-dimensional as a Holy Roman triptych. Imagine a Gaul Liz Phair strumming in the 14th Century, exiled in ye olde Village of Guy. Musically, Mountains is an often dreamy departure. Timony's work with Polvo frontman Ash Bowie in Helium has evidently rubbed off. With the magical wand of whammy attached to her guitar, she bends clean chords into melting diffractions, sounding much like Polvo's Eastern-influenced discursions from Exploded Drawing and Shapes on tasty songs like ""The Bell,"" ""Painted Horses,"" and ""Valley of One Thousand Perfumes."" It's a sound that's been missed since Polvo's demise. ""Poison Moon"" and ""The Golden Fruit"" pulse with tinny knocks of an echoing drum machine. It throbs with an anxiety-building pace, as if to say, ""Blue Wizard, your lifeforce is running out!"" Vibraphone and gooey analog organs drip from snapping drums and repetitious guitar plucking on the two-minute instrumental, ""An-deluzion."" Those're your highlights. When Timony attempts ""period"" sounds with maudlin violin, chimes, lute, harpsichord, or whatever modern equivalent, the album falls into what I like to call the ""laughable parts."" The delicate pipes of pan make their inevitable appearance on ""Tiger Rising."" Timony never once looks up from her fantasy epic, constantly dancing around her maypole with ribbons of black and olive. Yet it's the lyrics and vocal delivery that go down like 700-year-old salted ham. ""Will you dance with me?/ The kind of dance in the iron shoes/ Into the dungeon,"" she begs on ""Dungeon Dance."" Sorry, I've... uh... got some... uh... jousting to do. The songwriting veres dangerously close to the intro Spinal Tap's ""Stonehenge."" ""I walk through an everlasting pit/ By the mountain of fire and the fountain of spit,"" is better growled over some good old Norwegian death metal. Over plonking piano and handclaps, it just tickles. The lazy, forced vocals waver in similar fashion to those church hymns where it's evident they focused on writing the praising the Lord parts before the melody. Hearing a roomful of tongues trip over ""give us our tresspasses"" is enough to keep one home on Sunday. (Please excuse my narrow-minded allusions to Christian doctrine. Judeocentric readers should picture a temple full of weekend believers bellowing ""Baruch atah Adonai."") Still, if audacity counts, there's a strange allure to Mountains. It's certainly not the same tribute John Denver gave. Music should offer escapism in some form. But travelling to Timony's world is not a real trip. The voyage is more akin to a zoo. We watch for a few passing moments in our rush to the reptile house. We point and mock as our feelings shift from awe to pity to blithe. There, beyond the retaining cement moat, Mary sits strumming at the harp in velvet robes amongst gnarled trees filled with ravens. Mary, come back!

Well, the reason that hasn't happened is that the ""new"" world would rather throw out the ""old"" unless they're too poor not to use it. Really the only old shit you see around now is preserved up all untouchable, museum-style. Practical application of existing structures just isn't viable in this modern urban landscape of ours. Look at the cover of Mike Ladd's Welcome to the Afterfuture. It's an awful electrical mess, superimposed onto old building walls. Ladd's music reflects the artwork with chunky, pharmaceutical beats that sneak past dim strings. It's nasty New Orleans bounce with lyrics about listening to bootlegs of the Fall. And even though it looks kinda like a Marlboro ad, it's still a dope cover. The record starts with ""5000 Miles West of the Future,"" violently switching up from an analog keyboard assault to a sweeping ambient flow and back again, all while jazzy horn progressions seep through the background and make like Sun Ra handwriting. Ladd's rhymes on Afterfuture are at their most conversational, especially in breaks where he casually explains, ""I'm gonna steal from the foreign merchant.../ For the cinnamon peeler's wife.../ Like I was bedding down with Isis."" As the buzzing keyboard stabs fade out, ""Airwave Hysteria"" begins, and the rest is swapped for rising strings and faux-Hindu chants, drifting yet again into some funky, bugged-out Casio shit over which Ladd first hits his lyrical stride, MCing with self-assured flow and coming with dense rhyme content to match (""Breakbeats from Thailand down over by the Ku Klux Klan chapter in Croatia/ We've come a long way from migrating crustaceans/ Generations of relations, history of violence/ I talked along in Babylon, next time I'll try silence""). Unlike many poet-turned-MCs, Ladd manages to go off like a motherfucker, and it all ends with a classic scratch breakdown, cut open with more of those damned trilling strings of his. ""Planet 10"" breaks from these jams to bust on the simple beauty of a simple song, an intricate nautilus of synth tones and deep-space vocals stretching over junkyard ambience to some kind of nappy-haired slow-grind trajectory. Fuck neo-soul, this is post-soul, only somehow better than something called that should ever be. Nothing else here really touches these first three tracks, but the rest comes close-- the lilting rush of the mostly instrumental ""Takes More than 41,"" and the slow-to-start ""To the Moon's Contractor,"" a song more summery than its interstellar title might lead you to believe. ""I Feel Like $100"" sounds like Warp Records unfavorites Red Snapper with actual forward drive and rhythmic interest, even with its dodgy ""Strawberry Fields"" reference. Amazingly, Ladd goes for delf on every cut except the Company Flow-assisted ""Bladeruners,"" a violent fucking storm of next-level racial and sexual articulation, wide string samples criss-crossing like frozen rivers, and a plodding organic bassline. It's perhaps the closest to rap traditionalism the album ever flirts with-- something for BET to sneak in on that lazy Thursday afternoon to give you a Videodrome-style brain tumor. ""It's all confused and beautiful"" are the lines Ladd chooses to open ""Feb. 4 '99 (For All Those Killed by Cops),"" and it's exactly that. Besides Ladd's waxen imagery of childhood memories, the lyrics are mostly befuddling and his delivery is unconvincingly wide-eyed enough to fuel a thousand Björk videos. I know good and well that Ladd's trying to make this closing track a ""Strange Fruit"" for a future of money, women and computers, and I'll be damned if he doesn't actually come shockingly close. It's a stunning end to the album. For all the obvious influences (""Starship Nigga"" is pretty much just Björk's ""Pluto"" instilled with spaced-out black rage), the album still manages to sound pleasantly new, taking all the bits from the past that demand to be resurrected, and recontextualizing them into Ladd's own brainspace. Of course, this sort of thing has been done before, but I can't think of anything that's ever sounded as genuinely beautiful at the same time. It's all the wires from the liner notes covering children while they spread Christ-like onto antique brownstones. It's the genius of Ezra Pound and Greg Nice over tinny, rolling drums, and the awkwardness of my first paragraph over beautiful dimethicone symphonies. It's Mike Ladd assembling his personal afterfuture over the ramshackle remains of a distant past.

The collection of singles includes live and recorded work garnered from b-sides and compilation tracks, as well as unreleased material. In other words, this is not Oldham's Sgt. Pepper. In fact, it's more akin to ""The Collected Letters of Emily Dickinson;"" fragments, which are valuable primarily in their relation to other work. Together, these pieces grant a bit more access into the open wound of Oldham's dark but sober poetic vision. Lost Blues 2 recalls Roland Barthes' account of sorting through piles of family photographs in his seminal text, ""Camera Lucida."" His search for a photograph that marked the essence of photography became conflated with a search for his dead mother, as he discovered ""that rather terrible thing which is there in every photograph: the return of the dead."" Barthes did find the photograph that invoked both his dead mother's presence and the defining essence of photography. He refers to this image as ""the wintergarden photograph."" The remnants of Lost Blues to sort through are diverse in quality and style as they span the course of seven years. ""The Risen Lord,"" a D.H. Lawrence poem sung over a weak drum machine beat and synthy organs doesn't produce the creepy tension you'd expect Oldham to pull off in such an unlikely juxtaposition. Live recordings of ""For the Mekons et al,"" and ""Stable Will"" are uneven recordings, but show off some of Oldham's least restrained singing. ""Gesundheit"" starts off relaying, ""I dreamed I saw Phil Ochs last night/ Alive as you or me,"" before heading into a tape collage that ranges between a religious children's tape and a soundscape reminiscent of Angelo Badalamenti's ""Twin Peaks"" soundtrack. Lost Blues 2 isn't greater than the sum of its parts. It inspired thoughts of Emily Dickinson and French photographic wounds-- how rock is that? Those uninitiated into the Oldham/ Palace canon would be better off picking up a copy of the Palace Brothers' Viva Last Blues or Bonnie ""Prince"" Billy's I See a Darkness. If you get dragged in deeper, spend your money on Joya, Oldham's high-strung and sublime ode to terror. But for others of you-- and you know who you are-- Lost Blues 2 is an irresistible bundle of odd and ends which has the potential to contain that note or phrase which unsettles. Or rather, it's just another record in which you might find your wintergarden photograph.","

Come Clean,Dwarves,by: Matt LeMay,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a125ea9e61561daa4717/1:1/w_160/a3fceaea.jpg,2000-03-07 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2496-come-clean/,EpitaphEpitaph,"Here at Pitchfork, we do our best to take an unbiased approach to music criticism. But, like it or not, there are a few things that will never, ever receive over an 8.5, barring an act of government or God. These include, but are not limited to: 1. Promise Ring side projects
2. Nazi electronica
3. ""Comeback"" albums by washed-up '70s rockers
4. New Elephant 6 groups dedicated to the sounds of dying rodents
5. Disco revivalism
6. Overproduced three-or-four-chord punk records If you so much as snickered at #6, you can probably imagine what Come Clean sounds like: trite, overused guitar progressions, incompetent pentatonic solos, and seriously fucked-up lyrics. Over the course of Come Clean's 21 minutes, you'll hear tales of 14-year-olds who complain about not getting fucked properly, rape, and-- everyone's favorite-- tits! Maybe when the Dwarves started out in the mid-'80s, this was unique and shocking. But at this point, it really doesn't have all that much impact. It's all been said before. Shit, the Dwarves themselves have been saying it for over 10 years, and even they've said it better. If you strip away all the gimmick from the Dwarves, you're pretty much left with an average punk/pop band. Come Clean uses the same old chord progressions you've heard on every other punk/pop album. Come to think of it, the Dwarves' subject matter might be the one thing that's been keeping them from having any kind of mainstream success. If they were singing about being 20 instead of fucking 14-year-olds, they could hit it big! Then again, they probably haven't been 20 for at least 60 years. But thrashy, poppy tunes like ""How It's Done"" and ""Better be Women"" sound like they could have been written by Rancid, or another of today's generic Clash-worshipping punk-pop bands. While this stuff is immensely unoriginal, it somehow rarely reaches the point at which it becomes painful to listen to. When it does, of course, it ain't pretty. Take ""Deadly Eye,"" an insufferable, Kid Rock-ish Dwarves theme song, or ""Act Like You Know,"" a disjointed blast of fuzz that will leave you craving the kind-hearted fun of ""I Want You to Die."" So right now you're probably wondering, ""If it's so bad, why give it a 6.0?"" Well, there are two reasons for that. First of all, interesting sounds do occasionally pop up amidst the otherwise trite instrumentation. A lot of the tracks on Come Clean contain a few welcome seconds of synthesizer noises, and ""Way Out"" features a pretty cool vocoder introduction. (Hey, I didn't say it was original.) But these are just minor details. When taken on the merits of its music alone, Come Clean barely warrants a 4. The one thing that really pulls the album out from the depths of complete mediocrity is the fact that, unlike a lot of today's more popular acts, the Dwarves fully embrace the role of fucked-up punk rockers. Whereas watered-down punk/pop groups like Blink 182 appear ""nude"" on MTV with their genitals conveniently blurred, the Dwarves have no reservations about whipping out their dicks. Every aspect of Come Clean seems designed for the sole purpose of pissing off your parents. And in the end, isn't that what punk rock is all about?","Here at Pitchfork, we do our best to take an unbiased approach to music criticism. But, like it\n\ or ...

And Then Nothing Turned Itself Inside-Out,Yo La Tengo,by: Ryan Schreiber,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Founder</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5ad110526930e90a24ed25e2/1:1/w_160/Yo%20La%20Tengo-%20And%20Then%20Nothing%20Turned%20Itself%20Inside%20Out%20(2000).jpg,2000-02-29 06:00:07,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8870-and-then-nothing-turned-itself-inside-out/,Matador,"Yo La Tengo have finally reached the upper echelon of society: yuppies! Amidst our flaring economy, the cash-obsessed, egocentric 'elite' have more cash to blow than ever before, and you know what that means: they're hip! Especially in major American cities, these wealthy professionals are flocking to upscale outlets such as Borders, Barnes & Noble and other places with lots of fancy faux-oak shelving to purchase their copies of And Then Nothing Turned Itself Inside-Out. But if there's anything we've learned about these socially, culturally, economically, and apparently now, musically conscious individuals is that they'll only flock to something for one of three reasons: 1) the hype is overwhelming; 2) it's the biggest, most expensive, highest-quality item of its kind; 3) Eric, the office trendsetter, recommended it. My question is, where does Yo La Tengo fit into this picture? A conspiracy theorist might conclude that some high-ranking Matador executive slipped a few copies of Inside-Out into the offices of large mortgage companies, advertising firms, and stockbrokers. Sadly, it's probably much simpler than that. For years, Yo La Tengo have cranked out incredibly diverse albums with songs ranging from gentle western twang, to noise-fueled indie anthems, to lengthy, distortion-soaked instrumental epics. But here, Yo La Tengo have eliminated the noise they built their name on. 'Upbeat' is no longer an accurate descriptor for the trio's music. Rather, this is an album filled with songs in the vein of I Can Hear the Heart's ""Shadows"", Electr-O-Pura's ""The Hour Grows Late"", and the droning seven-minute version of ""Big Day Coming"" off Painful. And nothing else. So it makes sense when you consider the music-buying trends of the upper class. In the early 90s, they were all over Enigma, the Eagles, Billy Joel and Steely Dan. While bland VH-1 genericism still rules over the majority of rich, white folks, they have been catching on of late-- The Flaming Lips' The Soft Bulletin, Beck's Mutations, and Mercury Rev's Deserter's Songs have all become big sellers in their demographic. Of course, this doesn't mean the underground can't enjoy it, too. Oh, sure, we're used to a slightly different Yo La Tengo-- one that once burned through rockers like ""From a Motel 6,"" ""False Alarm,"" and ""Sugarcube,"" and kept it loud even during the quiet tracks. Among Inside-Out's sea of gentle lullabies, it's easy to long for the stunning diversity this band is known for. However, it's clear they were shooting for something different this time around. The album's cover depicts quiet dusk in a common outer suburb. Electrical wires stretch over a standard one-story home. The backyard is crowded with pine trees. To the far right, a man stands at the end of the driveway, a spot of light beaming down around him from the darkening sky above. It's a traditional image of alien abduction that encapsulates the peaceful ringing of the record's gently picked electric guitars and serene vocals. The cover speaks to the band's intentions behind the music: a dreamlike state, lulling, serene, tranquil. Despite Inside-Out's tendency to fade to background music during the first couple of listens, the album features few songs in need of omission. Only the album's later material seems less inspired. ""Madeline,"" at times, recalls the melody of the album's only driving, uptempo rock track, ""Cherry Chapstick."" The rhythmic instrumental ""Tired Hippo,"" while an excellent fit on this record, could have been better served as a b-side. And of course, everyone's biggest gripe, the 17 minute-long closing track, ""Night Falls on Hoboken,"" is pretty lacking when compared with their past epics. Regardless, the first three-quarters of Inside-Out contains some of Yo La Tengo's best work to date. As a whole, however, it may be one of their less ear-catching records. If recorded by an aspiring young band, Inside-Out would be deemed the next big thing by all music press. However, people are used to Ira Kaplan's masterful electric assaults and the broad range of sounds that generally appear in spades on Yo La Tengo's LPs. Still, this record is among the best I've heard so far this year, and will likely remain that way.","Yo La Tengo have finally reached the upper echelon of society: yuppies!

Believo!,Enon,by: Brent DiCrescenzo,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a15a13d19756521385eb/1:1/w_160/c227346f.gif,2000-02-29 06:00:06,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2816-believo/,SeeThru Broadcasting,"'They' say you can't judge a book by its cover. You know who 'They' are: book critics. Are you really going to listen to those bastards? They're just in the business for the press junkets and free bookmarks shaped like giant squid, gavels, abducted babies, and other subjects of current bestsellers. But you can judge a book by its cover! A man with a beard swings from a helicopter shooting medieval knights: probably not a good book. 'By Harmony Korine': probably not a good book. Likewise, you can judge an album by its cover. Legendary rock critics Lester Bangs and Richard Meltzer admit to reviewing albums without a single listen. We at Pitchfork afford albums the luxury of being listened to, naturally. But still, after all this listening, as we sit before our keypads, we notice that, in most cases, all the clues to the album's quality had laid hidden in the packaging. With training, a critic can excavate a review by merely brushing the dust from the milky shards of information that poke through the soil of artwork and liner notes. Enon's Believo! serves as an adequate example. Perusing the band's 'thank you' list is convincing enough to warrant immediate purchase of this sparkly pop gem. ""Enon would like to thank: Les Savy Fav..."" Right off the bat, Enon thanks their closest musical brethren. Both Les Savy Fav and Enon hammer intelligent art-pop that juices familiar nuggets into fresh shakes. Les Savy Fav bark awkward/winning slogans over zealous future-punk. ""...Jenny Steube..."" In Danish, ""steube"" means ""very similar, yet opposite in one way,"" and ""jenny steube"" translates as ""vice versa."" Thus, by thanking Jenny Steube, coincidentally named after this Danish phrase, Enon specify their relation to Les Savy Fav. Les Savy Fav rule in the live environment, but their albums have yet to capture the dazzle that nearly frightens audience members, in that fun rollercoaster frightening way. Enon, on the other hand, have mastered the studio. ""...Robin Taylor..."" Robin shares a surname with tragically departed Brainiac singer Timmy. Enon mastermind John Schmersal played guitar for the greatly missed Brainiac, and his presence generated the obvious creative leap from the Pixies-ish Smack Bunny Baby to the facemelt of Bonsai Superstar. Believo! is an obvious sonic continuation from Brainiac's final release, the Electro Shock for President EP. The electronics-drenched, subdued pop of ""Flash Ram"" echoes in the whistle-along ""Get the Letter Out"" and the organ-driven ""Come Into."" Enon are also less afraid than Brainiac of venturing into simple pleasure and sheep's-clothing accessibility. Yet digital funk like ""Biofeedback"" carries the baton from Brainiac's latefound obsession with guitarless rock, like on Electro-Shock's ""The Turnover."" If anything, Enon are dipped deeper in silicon chips and flossed-out with discovered sounds. ""...Mendelsohn Electronics..."" Ah, yes. That would explain it. ""...GvsB..."" Girls Against Boys' Eli Janney connected the wires from Brainiac's brain to the studio. Enon's bass-heavy opening track, ""Rubber Car,"" takes GvsB's abstract sex-rock to new depths. The double bass noir of ""Cruel"" one-ups New Wet Kojak in the rain-slicked, red-lit cocktail lounge soundtrack department. The crackling in its background could be tube television static or fat taxi tires splashing through puddles. ""...Rick Rubin..."" This hints at the fist-pumping rock factor. As Rick Rubin had his hand in lots of hip-hop, so too does the title track pop along on wild junkyard funk. ""Conjugate the Verbs"" breaks into blissful riffs after a lovely interludes. ""Rubber Car"" thrusts robotic hips like Beck choreographing blacksmiths in an Audi plant. For Believo! brushes new textures against your ears. The production sounds of an ambiguous fidelity. Although lo-fi techniques and tools are utilized, they're piled in wanton abundance. In concert, Enon play from beaten antique suitcases crammed with jury-rigged appliances such as samplers, battery powered turntables, and chintzy Casios. ""...Drummer's World..."" Much of this invention comes from the manic mind of Rick Lee, former percussionist for Skeleton Key and Butter 08, a man who builds kits from wagons and hubcaps. His garbage-drumming is heard throughout Believo!. ""For the Sum of It"" tumbles along cartoon jungle jazz breaks. The result of these three wonderfully demented minds blossoms into surreal structures. Although the molds are familiar, the filling certainly isn't. Much like a brick house made of ham. A house made of ham bricks. (""...Debbie Hambrick..."") ""...D8N OH10..."" Who would have thought this little city off I-75 could play to womb to such essential pop? For an much as Enon obviously owes to Brainiac, there is equally as much Breeders powerglee and Guided by Voices two-minute hook factory. What's exciting is not so much the overwhelming success of this debut, but the notion that Enon still squiggle in their larval state. Anxiously await the moth.","'They' say you can't judge a book by its cover. You know who 'They' are: book critics. Are you ...

NakedSelf,The The,by: Dan Gardopee,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a75c13d19756521393cc/1:1/w_160/b235a7a0.gif,2000-02-29 06:00:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7980-nakedself/,InterscopeInterscope,"If Roxy Music's Bryan Ferry was the quintessential soulful white-boy crooner of sleek pop, Matt Johnson is a sort of flipside: the quintessential purveyor of bleak, gritty, introspective emotion. Johnson's diverse arrangements and intimate songwriting set him apart from a host of other contemporaries who don't have the confidence to pull off direct statements about the heavier issues-- religion, the meaning of life, unrequited love, all-pervading lust, suicidal destruction. It's these deep spiritual, carnal, and moralistic pools that The The most often dive headlong into. You'd have to pick the back catalogue pretty thin to find an example of Johnson grasping at straws. Profound, then, is a good word to describe his consistently haunting songs, which, even at their most detached, resonate somehow deep in their core. It's as if the distilled essence of each and every one is never hidden by the production, no matter how detailed. Eight years on from their classic, Dusk, and five more since their competent, if unnecessary Hank Williams cover album, Hanky Panky, NakedSelf once again finds Matt Johnson in his element, tackling issues of alienation, global corruption, and urban squalor and decay with potent, more succinct lyrics and some of his most affecting melodies in ages. Johnson has always been the driving force behind The The, but he's managed to surrounded himself with tasteful, restrained, and prodigiously talented sidemen throughout the years. The band's alumni-- like Johnny Marr and D.C. Collard (whose keyboard work on Dusk was particularly essential to its success)-- have always made sure that The The albums were indeed a band effort. NakedSelf finds Johnson with a whole new group of collaborators, all of whom ably acquit themselves. Earl Harvin's hard-rocking, spare yet varied approach to drumming provides a muscular backdrop for Johnson's powerful vocals and the pervading atmosphere of a city's dingy shadows and less-travelled side streets. It's sort of a cliché to talk about an artist's ""maturation,"" especially one the occurs 20 years into their career, but the direct nature of many of the songs on NakedSelf make it hard to ignore. ""My life is halfway through/ And I still haven't done/ What I'm here to do,"" Johnson powerfully emotes on ""Soul Catcher,"" one of the album's immediate highlights. The suspicious INXS- via- Dylan cue-card introduction on ""Global Eyes"" (""Hypnotize/ Homogenize/ Shut your eyes/ Don't criticize"") is a bit worrisome, but fortunately that's where the similarities end. Johnson consistently marries thoughtful, vaguely apocalyptic lyrics to strong and dusty guitar figures, all skewered with the sharp aim of a perfectionist craftsman, and stamped with his unmistakable creative seal. That said, NakedSelf is far from easy listening-- not even for the seasoned fan. It's by far the dirtiest, darkest album Matt Johnson has released to date, lacking the rather 80's sheen of Infected and Mind Bomb, the ambiguous production of his 4AD debut and follow-ups, and the slight indulgences and retreats of Dusk. The rhythm section chugs and clangs along loosely and purposefully, and all manner of both deliberately strummed and on- the- verge- of- imploding guitar lines fill any sonic space not already occupied by Johnson's vocals. This isn't an album likely to evoke memories of summer passions. Menacing lyrics like, ""The train rises up out of the dark/ Above the boarded up boulevards/ And burnt out cars,"" probably won't become sing-song choruses for drunken college parties. And certainly, these songs aren't as immediately accessible as recent hook-driven efforts by Grandaddy or the Magnetic Fields. But these aren't Matt Johnson's intentions. Nakedself requires your interest-- you have to be willing to sit down and actively listen to Johnson unravel a few yarns out of his deeply troubled psyche. Background music, this isn't.","If Roxy Music's Bryan Ferry was the quintessential soulful white-boy crooner\n\ of sleek pop, Matt Johnson is a ...

Niun Niggung,Mouse on Mars,by: Mark Richardson,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c3ddea9e61561daa8006/1:1/w_160/6a8f1de7.gif,2000-02-29 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5459-niun-niggung/,Thrill JockeySonig,"Only a band as creative as Mouse on Mars can release a disappointing album that's still very nearly great. Compared to the innumerable rows of drivel that constitute the ""electronica"" section of your neighborhood Sam Goody, Niun Niggung is a sharp realization of Kraftwerk's emotional man/machine promise. But when judged against the Mouse on Mars's finest work, namely the vinyl-only LPs Instrumentals and Glam, this is merely an entertaining and technically accomplished diversion. Though they're capable of transcendent beauty, these Germans just want to have fun for the time being. Six full-length albums into their career, the Deutschland Duo of Jan St Werner and Andi Toma exhibit two distinct musical personalities: there's the abstract, glitch-wielding ambient side displayed on Instrumentals and St Werner's solo work as Lithops, and there's the humorous, off-kilter take on electronic pop as heard on Autoditacker and Niun Niggung. If anything, this new album takes the pop direction even further, harnessing the group's trademark electromagnetic flatulence, amplifying it, and shaping it into a strangely melodic but bizarre collage of fragmented sounds. Nowhere is this more evident than on the second track, ""Yippie"", which twists sampled horns and heavily processed analog synths into a frantic cyborg polka. Roll out the 55-gallon barrel of WD-40-- we'll have a barrel of fun. And it is fun, too, but it's just not as affecting as ""Download Sofist"", the leadoff track that also happens to be Niun Niggung's only real slice of Mouse on Mars's ""serious"" side. With its striking arrangement of classical guitar, treated electronics and French horns, the too-brief ""Download Sofist"" soundly beats Stereolab at their own game. As great as the song is, it also points out that the album as a whole could use more of this kind of risk-taking. Mouse on Mars have now completely mastered the transatlantic bump of ""Pinwheel Herman"", but they've yet to hit the wall on their more experimental side. After all, the slower and more drawn-out Mouse on Mars's tunes are, the more time you have to absorb all the astonishing sonic minutiae. For example, I first heard a handful of these songs on the Distroia EP in the Spring of '99. I was particularly taken with the a track called ""Super Sonig Fadeout""; it had the sensuous feel of something off Prince's Sign O' the Times, yet the texture was completely robotic. When I finally heard Niun Niggung, I discovered that the song was actually punchy and fast, and that I was playing my Distroia 12"" at the incorrect speed of 33 1/3 rpm. This embarrassing mistake (which I never discovered during six months of solid listening) gave me a chance to discover what I love most about Mouse on Mars: the gooey, dense details.","Only a band as creative as Mouse on Mars can release a disappointing album that's still very nearly great ...

Get someone to take you to Coconuts and ask the cashier about Non. In sign language, if necessary. Review for people who can and have been able to hear: We live in a city. A big city. Not an especially nice part of a big city. For us, muggings, police sirens, and the stench of raw sewage is part of the scenery. As we walk to and from class, the homeless accost us, cars run stop signs and narrowly avoid taking us out, and students with bullhorns complain about the administration. To put it mildly, we're bombarded with the bustling noise and activity of a city on a daily basis (the emphasis being on ""noise""). It's never really quiet here. But we've grown accustomed to it and it's not much of an issue. But we understand that not everyone has the privilege of living in such a cacophonous environment. Fortunately, Non (aka Boyd Rice) had these people in mind when he recorded Receive the Flame. For those of you from the dust bowl states who feel that you've been missing out on an entire world of noise, this album puts you right in the thick of it. We can imagine how much someone-- say Marlee Matlin-- would enjoy Non, if her hearing was to be miraculously restored by faith-healers or voodoo shamans. If you lived in a world of deafening silence, 35 minutes of random screeching, helicopter sounds, and the rare suppressed organ or violin would be a welcome change. Not so for the rest of us. And even if you did like it, that's no reason to buy Receive the Flame. You could get a more-than-decent facsimile of the Non experience by sitting on a airport runway with a boombox blaring classical music with the bass turned off. Receive the Flame is experimental music, and any music fan can appreciate the spirit in which it was created. But, hey, guess what? The experiment failed! It might have seemed like a good idea to create an unnecessarily dense collage of sound, but we can't imagine the end result spending much time in anyone's stereo. There have been many others before Boyd Rice who've made incoherent noise with much more inventiveness and pizzazz, and surely many more will follow. But in the unlikely event that we ever do get the yen for Non again, we'll just put a Dictaphone cassette of whale songs inside a refrigerator and pack our ears with cigarette butts.","Review for people who were born deaf and recently gained the ability to hear (by recently, we mean within the ...

Even back then, this was by no means an original concept. Hundreds of bands-- Stereolab, Dimitri from Paris, Komeda, etc.-- preceded Air with Bacharachian melodies and Moog hisses scattered throughout their albums like trademark logos. But while their predecessors carried themselves on kitsch value and band-of-the-moment media praise, Air seemed somehow more serious about their music. Is the world really interested in another Air release, though? Premiers Symptomes and Moon Safari, while intriguing albums for their genre, were somewhat similar in mood and direction. Both showed a band whose intent was to create instrumental French space-pop, and not much else. And with the ""French space-pop revolution"" pretty much over and done with, what could a new Air record possibly offer that the duo hasn't already accomplished? Well, from the sound of The Virgin Suicides, the score to Sofia Coppola's directorial debut, Nicolas Godin and Jean-Beno\xEEt Dunckel have a bit more to achieve before their 15 seconds tick to a close. Though the record does aim for the same kind of prog-rock atmospherics as their earlier releases, Air have managed to alter their sound this time out, drawing from a wider array of rock influences, instead of limiting their scope to Perrey and Kingsley. Godin and Dunckel have a larger arsenal of instruments here. The bulk of the equipment implemented still seems to be a diverse assortment of analog keyboards, but Air also incorporate those dependable traditional rock instruments, guitar and bass. It's a marked improvement from the synth surplus of their previous material. The band also seems more influenced by the melodic psychedelic rock of the late 60's and early 70's than before. There are distinct nods to Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon and especially the Beatles' Abbey Road. The Beatles' influence is most notable on ""Bathroom Girl,"" ""Cemetary Party,"" and ""Highschool Lover (Theme from 'The Virgin Suicides'),"" during which several of the drum fills and guitar squalls sound almost directly snatched from Abbey Road. Of course, The Virgin Suicides has its dry moments, but surprisingly, they're few and far between. For the most part, the album showcases Godin and Dunckel's dramatically improved songwriting skills. The majority of these 13 tracks actually feature a true rarity for rock music these days-- unpredictable chord progressions. And the album undeniably serves its purpose: it's a film score. The fact that it holds your attention, despite being created solely as incidental music, says something about the guys playing it. Whether we want to admit it or not, Air are pretty good at what they do. Still, the backlash is well underway at this point, and it seems doubtful they'll hold up quite as well by the time their ""official"" follow-up to Moon Safari sees release later this year.","Since their humble beginnings on Premiers Symptomes, their 1997 debut\n\ EP, Air haven't striven for much more than ...

The computer commercials promise plug-in-and-surf, but there's always a glitch. At work you're too embarrassed to ask the young tech guys how the ""web"" works. They'd snicker before cranking The Fragile back up and turning back to their monitors. Never show inferiority to subordinates. So, you pony-tailed Jeep-drivers and terrier-walkers, I'm crawling inside your minds like ""Reeling in the Years"" did so many decades ago. I know you've held silly suspicions, if just for a moment, that your ponytail was perhaps pulling back your hairline. I know that this review might hurt your feelings. Here, play with this shiny silver Nokia while I chat with somebody else. If you're a regular Pitchfork reader... why are you even curious about Steely Dan in 2000?! Only their 20 year absence gives them any press or assumed credibility. Unlike Chicago, Rush, or Cheap Trick they did not slip down a steep staircase of increasingly prosaic Prozac records. Steely Dan dodged the 80's and they didn't make a Woke Up with the Monster. One can imagine the hype Rush would receive in 2000 if they'd jumped 20 years from 1981's Moving Pictures straight to Test for Echo. This would not make Test for Echo a desirable album. For those worth risking it, extended absence makes for great publicity. Some of the smoothest objects know to humankind include the buttock of a baby, the belly of an otter, Downy-laden terrycloth, Palmolive, and rose petals. Add to that list Two Against Nature. The lengthy, indistinguishable tracks could pass for a Daniel Lanois-produced collaboration between the Dave Matthews Band and Kenny G. This putrid bait lures both the smooth jazz aficionados and the hackysackers. ""Fusion"" is too caustic a verb, better suited for nuclear physics and Don Caballero. ""Making pudding"" better describes this genre blending. ""Jamming"" sax solos glide over neutered, bassless funk. Glass guitar and percussion clink along steadily like a chorus of jangling Tag Heuers, automatic Lexus locks, popping Le Croix cans, clicking laptop covers, crystal Cristal toasts, and smacking Hollywood cheek-kisses. The same slow-bop pace is rigorously maintained. Vocals exhale so innocuously you have to hold a mirror up under the speaker to make sure it's alive. The credits list 13 producers (!) who tackle tasks such as ""editing,"" ""horn arranger,"" ""consultant,"" ""project manager,"" and-- most tellingly-- ""copyist."" This is less music than ""production."" 23 musicians took part in this album's design, four of which simply played ""snare."" At least at the end of ""Wild Wild West"" Will Smith destroys the giant, evil machine. Music is more than craft and technique. Steely Dan's seams are hidden, the instruments are digitally lacquered, and the edges are buffed. 20 years have passed since Gaucho and Steely Dan seem content to completely ignore them. Amazingly, Steely Dan's name has been popping up as a hip musical crush. Remember, this glossy bop-pop was the indifferent aristocracy to punk rock's stone-throwing in the late 70's. People fought and died so our generation could listen to something better. Okay, so they died of overdoses and car crashes. They still had soul. Keep up the good fight. Put down this sports-utility vehicle of a record.

Vision Creation Newsun,Boredoms,by: Mark Richardson,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a34b13d1975652138a68/1:1/w_160/22c4eace.jpg,2000-02-29 06:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/863-vision-creation-newsun/,Warner Bros.,"One way to look at the Boredoms is as the Andy Kaufman of rock. Through meticulous study, they have completely mastered the architecture of the transcendent rock jam. But instead of celebrating their achievements, they choose to undercut their monuments to riffology in service of the first commandment of Dadaism: Thou Shalt Fuck With People's Heads. Just as Kaufman's killer Elvis impression turned his hapless, unfunny ""foreign man"" character into a surreal comic enterprise, so does the Boredoms' overreaching rock power achieve extra poignancy through their unwillingness to leave well enough alone. The classic Boredoms song inches us ever closer to the brink of orgiastic musical communion, until Yamatsuka Eye and Co. derail the groove train at the last minute, sending us spinning off into a ditch in a messy tangle of open reel tape. We are frustrated, but as Frank Sinatra once said, ""That's life."" The best example of this sort of monkeywrenching on Vision Creation Newsun (the follow-up to 1998's Super Are, which is currently only available as a pricy Japanese import) comes with the second track. The song (there are no titles here, only unpronounceable symbols) begins in a swell of chiming guitars and shimmering percussion, opening slowly like a lotus flower, and eventually takes root as a driving, circular psychedelic guitar workout reminiscent of Spacemen 3's ""Suicide."" As the band moves through variation after variation on the simple theme and the track gains in volume and power, Eye suddenly seizes the tape machine and begins cutting the song to ribbons, splicing in air raid sirens, EQing, and phasing like a tone-deaf janitor trapped in the Radio One control booth. In this instant, Eye makes an unholy pile of shit from a perfect specimen of guitar rock ecstasy. How could he do such a thing when we were feeling so good? But then, just as we're about to hit the Stop button in disgust, he gets the song back on the rails and shoves it forward with even more thrust. And as we appreciate the authority of the song that much more, we thank him for the moment of discord. No music writer can resist the occasional ""x meets y"" sort of comparison, and the one that describes latter-day Boredoms is too unusual to pass up: The Ramones meets the Grateful Dead. Strange as it may sound, it could be the only way to describe a band that once cut a 34-minute cover of a single Mekons riff-- it appeared on Super Roots 7, a tremendous achievement that remains the band's trance rock pinnacle. But if anything, this odd amalgamation only points out what's so great about Japan: musicians there don't waste time trying to figure out why the Sex Pistols are cooler than King Crimson, they merely combine the best elements of both. Vision Creation Newsun takes the Boredoms even further into neo-hippie psychedelic territory, though a few songs (like the aforementioned Track Two) rock more thoroughly and convincingly than any pre-punk band apart from the Stooges. Though there are a handful of lengthy, evolving crunchers, the majority of the album consists of exercises in atmosphere. This largely instrumental LP leans mostly on plucked guitars, gurgling synths, and tribal drumming, sometimes reminiscent of folky psyche travelers Ghost. It's a beautiful sound-- one that gains in complexity with repeated listens-- but it never quite reaches the heights of Super Are. I guess you have to take what you can get with the Boredoms.","One way to look at the Boredoms is as the Andy Kaufman of rock. Through meticulous study, they have completely ...

DDD,Poster Children,by: Michael Sandlin,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a10813d1975652138523/1:1/w_160/7122b117.gif,2000-02-22 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6436-ddd/,spinART,"Shame on my unobservant ass. I've been subconsciously neglecting the Poster Children's latest, DDD, since I received it from Pitchfork Central. For months now, this album's been inexplicably buried beneath a stack of sadly forgettable CDs-- bands that will almost instantly be flushed from my memory after I melt down their worthless plastic to make homemade explosives. But my mysterious subconscious reluctance to review DDD is all too appropriate if you consider that, throughout most of their productive 13-year career, the Poster Children's achievements have been mysteriously obscured by many flavors-of-the-month and flashes-in-the-pan. Yes, the Poster Children have always been underrated and overlooked for no good reason, if you ask me. True, they've resigned themselves to residing in their native Champaign, Illinois, dodging the limelight. They've endured the major label swine, and apparently, learned a thing or two from the experience: the band now records in their own studio for the New York-based indie, SpinART. On DDD, they sound like a band with nothing to lose, and under no obligation to please some fat-assed, cigar-chomping record exec looking for the next Oasis. Guitarists Rick and Jim Valentin expertly intertwine their respective parts, referencing '60s psychedelia, punk, and the more obvious hook-driven pop that Doug Martsch's Built to Spill has executed since their 1993 debut. And it's probably a good thing critics don't often wax hyperbolic over the Valentin brothers. Who knows? Rick and Jim might lose their heads and release a live album containing a 20-minute version of ""Cortez the Killer"" or something unthinkable like that. Now, it's true that, on DDD, the Poster Children uncharacteristically force some funky elements into their usual guitar/bass/drums barrage, as on ""The Old School and the New,"" which is a kind of self-conscious attempt to put the Poster Child past forever behind them and look to the future. ""The past is not the place to die,"" they insist. But don't let the word ""funk"" throw you-- we're talking maybe some sped-up, warped Railroad Jerk blues here, not some cut-out bin G. Love/R. Kelly hybrid. Actually, on ""Daisy Changed,"" the Poster Children integrate some early '80s neo-funk Moog junk with commendable skill. The song appears to be a clever allegorical commentary on assholes like me who never listened to Boston's advice on ""Don't Look Back."" The Poster Children's feelings on this track are pretty clear to me, and I'll take my lumps: ""Daisy changed/ She's not the same girl/ You knew back in school/ She's all grown up/ How 'bout you?"" Valentin and crew always pick great lead-off tracks, setting just the right tone for the rest of the album. Listen to the simple air-tight structure of ""This Town Needs a Fire"" and its rocket-blast tempos, punchy rhythm guitar, and volatile, exploding chorus. Meanwhile, ""Strange Attraction"" gives a slight nod to early '90s navel-gazing-- delayed guitars soar off into space, flutes coo, feedback fuzz-blankets unfold all around-- yet the band kicks it up a notch, driving it into a blazing rock anthem. And check the biting stab they take at their own semi-obscure underground status on ""Zero Stars:"" ""We're not on the TV/ We're not on the charts/ We don't know our places/ And we don't know who we are."" DDD is much more sonically ambitious and melodically inventive than 1999's New World Record, or 1997's RTFM, and quite possibly their second-best album ever. Yes, I'll have to admit, DDD isn't their greatest work. Inarguably, that award goes to their thrilling post-punk guitar blow-out, 1990's Daisychain Reaction, a glorious artifact the band will probably never improve upon. But given the other highly-touted 2000 releases I've suffered through this year, DDD may as well be the White Album of our generation.","Shame on my unobservant ass.

The Big Dig,Billy Mahonie,by: Mark Richardson,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a2a15e6ef95969320466/1:1/w_160/9ac529ca.gif,2000-02-22 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/696-the-big-dig/,Beggars BanquetToo PureBeggars BanquetToo Pure,"I recently had a conversation with a friend in which we talked about new media and broadband entertainment. I felt that that whatever happens when the Web and TV merge for good, it won't make anybody happier. I said that my present Internet experience gives me what I need-- even over a 56k modem I can read news, check out music, and so on-- and I don't feel like I'm wanting. And my friend said that you never know what you need until somebody gives it to you. Something similar seems to have happened with instrumental rock. Ten years ago, there was very little of the stuff around, and nobody seemed the worse for it. There was fusion, sure, but the only fusion people would admit to liking back then had much more to do with jazz and funk-- stuff like Miles Davis and Herbie Hancock. True rock instrumentals were limited to surf bands, and the occasional side-long prog opus. The prospect of instrumental rock music back then actually seemed pretty damned boring. Then Slint came along and changed things, and Tortoise finished what they started. These days, most indie rock children need some instrumental music in their collections, even though they'd never have considered it in 1990. This brings us to Billy Mahonie, an instrumental rock band from the UK. One thing I've learned from listening to bands like Mogwai (whom Billy Mahonie have been compared to) is that you need to hear some records a half-dozen times or more before they mean anything. Mogwai's last full-length, in fact, is still keeping me at arm's length, even after having owned it for nearly a year. Similarly, the first few passes through Billy Mahonie's The Big Dig reminded me of chugging a glass of warm water when you're not even thirsty. But the more I listened to it, the more often interesting subtleties kept popping up. Billy Mahonie don't bring anything new to the table, and The Big Dig certainly isn't going to change anybody's life, but this is definitely a solid album. These guys can all play (guitar, two basses, drums) and they have a knack for solid riffs and catchy guitar leads. But since they don't rock very hard and aren't into studio manipulation (my favorite part of the Mogwai experience), the prettiest tracks on The Big Dig are the best. Of these, ""Drago"" is the most immediately engaging, with a wandering, wistful melody that begs for soft, pleasing visuals. ""William Derbyshire"" has a gently uplifting chord progression that glows extra bright with ringing acoustic guitar accents. More uptempo but equally as effective is ""Watching People Speaking When You Can't Hear What They're Saying,"" which layers slide guitar right out of U2's ""Bullet the Blue Sky"" over a frenzied, propulsive rhythm before breaking down into a slow, airy section with a lovely guitar melody. And so it seems that while I may not have needed another instrumental rock record in my collection, I wound up enjoying The Big Dig.","I recently had a conversation with a friend in which we talked about new media and broadband entertainment.

Tragic Epilogue,Anti-Pop Consortium,by: James P.

After having in rotation about 20 discs of varying genres for about two months, I reach the final offering: Tragic Epilogue. When writing reviews, you soon see that the best discs and worst discs make themselves evident early on, begging immediate attention. It's the unspectacular discs that linger. Thus, we come to Anti Pop Consortium. Perhaps I'm spoiled. Tragic Epilogue will surely remind you of Kool Keith's cock-rocking rhymes ensconced in twisted samples and off-kilter beats, but without many of the things that make his style so effective. Where Keith's rhymes veer from the preposterous to the ridiculous and back again, Anti-Pop Consortium rhymesters Priest, Beans and M. Sayyid wallow in enervating obscurity that, while sometimes fresh and dead-on, is too often flat and unworthy of interest. Where Keith's verbose wordplay winks sarcastically, Anti-Pop is disappointingly earnest, as if by taking themselves seriously, we will, too. No. Generally minimal, preferring repeating loops over cut-n-splice, much of Tragic Epilogue is occupied by one rapper rhyming over a loop that cycles repeatedly, giving many tracks an unpleasant endless feel. This sense transfers to the album as a whole with few sonic mileposts to signify what track-- or even what half of the album-- you're hearing. Most of the juiciest soundbytes are laid down at track openings, only to vanish and not be revisited. Yet, Tragic Epilogue is clearly fresh by overall rap standards. There are few rappers around these days that could even compare to Kool Keith, and that's to Anti-Pop's credit. The track transitions and a few of the beats are interesting, pulling together a combination of clichéd 4/4 rap beats and edgy Autechre-inspired electronic mutations. It's a hopeful combination, but my sense is that Anti-Pop Consortium is clinging to the tired rap paradigm of rhyme and simple beat. They take small risks that beg bigger ones, and finally disappoint when the goods aren't delivered. Tragic Epilogue is riddled with a feeling of unrealized potential that doesn't quite go the distance. It's an auspicious debut, but one that's more likely to draw your attention to the band's future than to send you scattering for spare change to pick it up.","And so I come to the bottom of the pile.

It's a simple black- and-white photo, featuring a dark-haired girl facing away from the camera, staring out onto an endless black-and-white beach. It's somber and cosmic, conjuring images of those freaky 1920's German expressionist silent films. It's subdued, restrained and, in a weird, bleak way, kind of beautiful. Given all of this album's subliminal, smooth cover-art warm-up, it's a damn shame that Vue's music couldn't sound a little more like a silent film. However, after building up listeners' hopes for a cool, artsy album with their cool, artsy cover, Vue instead turn around and piss in everyone's eye by dishing out 11 tracks of smarmy, glitzy, flash-and-trash rock music. Sounding like a strange blend of soulless southern rock, lazy college rock and bad, bad late 70's glam-rock, Vue's music blends everything that is already wrong about rock music with their own even worse Euro-trash tendencies. This album gives rock music such a bad name that it makes me wonder if these silly fuckers might not be the indie rock Antichrists, sent here to destroy good rock music for us all. After listening to the first few songs of the album, I little voice in my head started saying, ""You've heard all of this before."" ""But,"" I replied to the voice, ""if I had ever heard music this bad before in my life, I'm sure I would have remembered it."" The voice spoke back, saying, ""Ah, listen more closely, grasshopper."" That's when it hit me. I had heard music this awful before, but I'd never heard so much awful stuff squeezed into such a tiny space-- so much concentrated shit making such a shamelessly terrible final product. Mixing the irritating pretension of a Sonic Youth spoken word track with a grungier Mott the Hoople, Vue is so cluttered with nonsense that listening to it is an exercise in patience. The five-member band produces an amazingly empty and joyless sound. There's no fun or electricity whatsoever. The songs have all the thematic range of a 2 Live Crew album (sex, boys, weird chicks, boys and sex) and all the lyrical ingenuity of a Bon Jovi b-side. With this delicate mixture of musical crap and verbal crap firmly set, Vue manage to set new a standard for complete and utter sonic retardation. The result is music that's about as subtle as a flying mallet and half as much fun to listen to. Taken separately, the pieces of this music suck just as much as the whole. Frontman Rex Shelverton, isn't so much singing as he is painfully over-emoting unconvincingly. Using irritating repetition and endless vocal effects to try and disguise his toneless whine, Rex screeches his way emotionlessly through the album's 41 long, long minutes. The most profound line Shelverton manages on the entire record is, ""Try, try, try, try"" from ""We Were Here."" Though, the three separate songs in which a chorus builds around slight variations of the line, ""I want to see you undress,"" are nice, too. Apparently, Rex didn't think anyone would pay much attention to his lyrics, either. Every track on Vue sounds identical to the last. Its opening track, ""White Traffic,"" blows the band's wad early in the game, running through Vue's very small bag of tricks within the first 20 seconds of the record. So the rest of the album, on top of being lame, isn't even surprisingly lame-- it's just lame. You could listen to this unmanageable pile of crap backwards and it would make as much sense as if you played it straight through. I firmly believe that there should be some sort of legal penalty for making an album this bad. We could say that it's slanderous against all rock music, then we could start dishing out some much-deserved ass-kicking. Maybe Sub Pop should have to pay us all punitive damages and Vue should be forced to be pick up trash along the highway. This just goes to prove my theory that if new bands were forced to take some sort of written test before we let them in the studio-- possible an essay exam-- we'd never have to worry about Cro-Magnons like this making an album this worthless again.","The cover of Vue's self-titled debut full-length looks pretty damned nice.

Villiger,DAT Politics,by: S.

The fact that pop and rock are principally derived from the organic unity of several instruments combining to create a singular sound is rendered moot by the reality that electronic music begins with organic unity as an immediate instance of synchronicity. So one could posit the viewpoint that the attempt to create organic unity in electronic music is pointless. Of course, electronic music has caused something of a viral infection in pop music. Whereas before it was content to keep pace with digital media and exercise developmental innovation in the processing of sound, the genre has now begun to appropriate the intent of pop. The role of guitar as an organic cog-in-the-wheel has died, and pop music has since begun to resemble a cyborg. DAT Politics is a laptop quartet from Lille, France. An offshoot of the much whispered about French post-rock group Tone Rec (of which three of these four guys are members), Villiger is their second album of sharp, densely arranged electronic product. It's an amazing picture of where electronica and pop music meet, a jaw-droppingly consistent instance of glitchy electronics and massively processed tones wedded to a more traditional musical heritage. The band applies a more populist approach to the groundbreaking static orchestrations exemplified by Mego artists like Fennesz and Pita without diluting the sonic edge of the work. The four members interact and bounce ideas off one another relentlessly, using shards of overheated electronics to sculpt a profoundly melodic musical interplay. The tracks range from miniature exercises in digital sound processing to full-blown beat-driven electro-pop songs, each track blazing its own stylistic trail as it develops. On one track, they manage to evoke a horn section tripping over a distinct melodic theme. The song's subsequent breakdown even seems to approximate something like what George Martin might produce if locked up in the BBC Radiophonic Workshop. Villiger is the heavy-handedness of experimental music skillfully tempered by a refreshingly engaging approach. DAT Politics provide a vibrant fusion of electronic music with a pop sensibility without sacrificing the edge of its musical process. That their work is the product of an organic group dynamic lends this album its immediacy and verve. Two members of Tone Rec have recently abandoned guitar and bass for notebook computers. As it should be.","Organicity in popular music has been greatly complicated by the advent of electronica. The fact that pop and rock are ...

Although not as cool to look at and play with as 7"", you usually get a couple more songs, and generally at a similar price. They're even more fun when you're dealing with a band like Superchunk, whose recorded output is pretty consistently enjoyable-- you're pretty much guaranteed a couple of pleasant tracks. On 1000 Pounds, we get the album version of the title track, a great studio outtake (""White Noise""), a David Bowie cover (""Scary Monsters""), and a lovely acoustic reworking of ""1000 Pounds,"" wherein Mac McCaughan's outrageously catchy lead guitar is replaced by... a xylophone! It comes across as bunch of friends sitting on a porch in the summertime, knocking out a tune for the sake of knocking out a tune. The laid-back feel of this track is totally infectious-- there's even a banjo plucking along good-naturedly in the background for good measure. As for the other two non-album cuts, well, ""White Noise"" is a cool song. Sure, it's not quite up to the standards of most of Come Pick Me Up's material. Hey, maybe that's why it's a b-side. The Bowie cover is a bit stranger. ""Scary Monsters (and Super Creeps)"" is culled from Bowie's 1980 album of the same name, which is generally considered his last hurrah before the downhill slope of Let's Dance and everything else that followed. Here, Superchunk make the song their own-- if you hadn't heard the original, you'd suspect nothing. It makes for a few truly endearing minutes, and fits in alongside the rest of the EP's songs nicely. Certainly, the single is a must for Superchunk fans. I mean, it's Superchunk! Of course the fans are going to buy it. And of course, if you've never heard Superchunk and you've only got $5 to spend, 1000 Pounds will make as good an introduction to their music as any of their other EPs.

Clicks and Cuts,Various Artists,by: Matt LeMay,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a7b29d034d5c69bf3873/1:1/w_160/0fa61a3e.gif,2000-02-08 06:00:02,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1935-clicks-and-cuts/,Mille Plateaux,"Contrary to popular belief, there's a difference between minimalism and laziness. Sure, minimalist pioneers like Steve Reich and Philip Glass used simple patterns and constant repetition, but every subtle change in the music was carefully thought out. Each theme was left unchanged long enough to create an enthralling rhythm, and rarely hung around long enough to become stagnant. Each tiny shift in the music seemed greatly magnified, and took on huge significance. I'm a big fan of early minimalist works, most notably Steve Reich's 1970-71 masterwork, Drumming. Over the course of its 55 minutes, Drumming takes a simple rhythmic figure, and expands upon and mutates it. On Clicks and Cuts, each track averages about four minutes-- hardly enough time for the type of development that makes minimalism interesting. And while the variety of artists mixes up the sound, the real beauty of minimalist music, the subtle shifts and transitions, is almost completely lost. Of course, this album is not without its interesting moments. Ester Brinkmann's ""Maschine"" could have been a fascinating piece, with its rhythmically complex static patterns and distant synthesizer noises. About halfway through the track, though, an intolerably simple drum machine beat instantly robs the piece of its intricacy, and some guy who sounds like Doctor Strangelove enters the mix with an annoying refrain in that passionate, romantic language of love, German. Interesting though they may be, these pieces are hard to take. Rhythmically manipulated analog noise can be interesting, but it rarely makes for a truly compelling listen.

Lipslide,Sarah Cracknell,by: Dan Gardopee,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a694ea9e61561daa53d2/1:1/w_160/d800a28f.gif,2000-02-08 06:00:01,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1652-lipslide/,GutInstinct,"Cotton candy textures. Lollipop melodies. A wafer thin voice. We're talking about Britney Spears' Oops!... I Did It Again, right? Nay, it's that British bombshell chanteuse, Sarah Cracknell, getting her solo rocks off in gloriously cheddary fashion. Forgive me if the above sounded like a nasty jab, because it was a jab given with the lightest of touches and a twinkle in the eye. Like many others who've swayed, smarmed and wrapped presents to Saint Etienne over the past nine-odd years, I, too, have been infatuated with the shining beauty that fronts that enigmatic pop band. I've never doubted the shallow appeal of Cracknell's wispy voice and complete lack of personality on record. To me and those of my flock, she represented an attainable goal; some sort of perfect indie mannequin you could project your fantasies onto. Perhaps we thought of her a la Prefab Sprout's ""The Ice Maiden""-- the high-class, hyper-stylish beauty that was manipulative and cold, yet irresistible. But unlike Paddy, we had no illusions that we could singe her pretty blond lashes. We also had no illusions about whether or not she was what made Saint Etienne work-- she obviously wasn't. ""She could be replaced with one more from the assembly line!"" we quipped. So, what would it take to get us to change our minds? A new, similar frontwoman stepping into her shoes after a split over ""creative differences?"" How about a Sarah Cracknell solo album? Initially, this seemed like some sort of sick joke. And damn her if she didn't confound us all by releasing an album on which neither Etienne bandmates Bob Stanley and Pete Wiggs were anywhere to be found. On top of that, she co-wrote every track. And on top of that, most of the songs were good. So, there we were back in 1997 with a really nice Cracknell album, left to wonder what Saint Etienne sound like without her. This re-release gives us another chance to evaluate the whole situation. Fortunately (or unfortunately for you what-if'ers out there), Cracknell has continued to front the rather prolific Etienne bunch, without releasing any new solo material. Lipslide makes it abundantly clear that Ian Catt, co-writer of a few tracks on the record, is a damn fine arranger. Techno-pop refuses to die as long as every single blasted one of us has that musical sweet tooth for precision cheese. Finally, we come to realize that her lack of a distinctive, forceful voice actually doesn't matter one damn bit. Let's get real, naysayers. Can you imagine Sleater-Kinney belting out ""Coastal Town?"" How about Cat Power doing ""Fifth Floor?"" No? What about Whitney Houston belting about a sensitive English lad on ""Ready or Not?"" Hopefully, this is getting through to you. The bottom line is that Cracknell's voice suits these songs. Despite the fact that she doesn't have many tricks in her vocal bag, her keen sense of pitch makes those upper-register harmonies a real treat. Unfortunately for those who loved her ultra-soprano wind-chime vocal lines on early Etienne records, she stays in a relatively middling range for the better part of this record. Blond dance-pop diva. Six or seven people working on the record. It sounds like a page out of a Madonna biography. But if we can grudgingly admit that Madonna pulled it off, surely we can give as much credit to Cracknell and her co-writers, right? Sure, we can! This is dance-pop fluff of the highest order. Anyone who wants to challenge me on that can go to hell with headphones glued to their ears, a discman with batteries that never die, and Mandy Moore's So Real on shuffle-repeat. Then you will know true pain. The tracks on Lipslide are accomplished synth-pop productions with relatively fluid writing, appropriately simplistic lyrical content, and almost disgustingly memorable melodies. Things get shaken up a little bit here and there-- Ian Catt's Spectorian sheen on ""Can't Stop Now"" turns Cracknell into a whitebread Ronette (I'm going with Ronnie, actually) faster than you can get up the energy to groan. ""Oh Boy, the Feeling When You Held My Hand"" is a drumless, acoustic guitar-driven Latin number which draws a simple poignancy from its pared down arrangement. For a twelve-track album, there's remarkably little throwaway filler, although it's highly likely that certain unnamed individuals in certain unnamed publications may consider the entire thing filler. However, select tracks fall short of the mark due to generic, by-the-motions writing (""Desert Baby"") and, disturbingly, sounding a whole lot like Berlin (""4 Months, 2 Weeks""). So, let us sit back and once again reflect on Cracknell's minor triumph over the daunting obstacles we all placed before her. We treated her like a poodle. ""Jump through hoops,"" we said. ""We dare you."" She did us one better by throwing the hoop up in the air, setting it on fire, jumping through it, and giving us one of those lovely fingers-- probably the middle one. We surrender, Sarah. How about a kiss?","Cotton candy textures. Lollipop melodies. A wafer thin voice. We're talking about Britney Spears' Oops!... I Did It Again ...

Little Lost Soul,Third Eye Foundation,by: Kristin Sage Rockermann,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a77dea9e61561daa55d0/1:1/w_160/59522f48.gif,2000-02-08 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8010-little-lost-soul/,MergeMerge,"Last night, I dreamt that my roommate and I bought too much swordfish to cook for dinner. Except it was one of those nights when what we referred to as ""swordfish"" took the form of a giant slab of ground beef. The bloody hunk of meat covered three square feet of counter space and towered six inches thick, and after preparing a small portion, we were left at a loss as to what to do with the unruly leftovers. Since it's unsanitary to keep so much raw meat in the fridge, we were faced with only two options: we could either cook the rest of it and pack up the tamed result in Tupperware, or better yet, we could look into returning the unused portion to the supermarket. Naturally, I felt extremely uncomfortable with the idea of returning the meat. We'd already handled it and eaten part of it. It was left at room temperature for 20 minutes! If the Stop & Shop took it back and sold it to another customer, what would that say about where the meat had already been when we purchased it? I woke up in a cold sweat with clenched teeth and my nails driven into my palms. As a long time vegetarian who recently began experimenting with fish, the excess of bloody carnage I referred to as swordfish seemed somewhat creepy, as it hinted that, in my waking hours, I might naively be consuming a ""gateway meat."" Yes, I'm concerned that eating swordfish will lead first to ""harder meats,"" and eventually to heroin addiction. Third Eye Foundation's Little Lost Soul is a soundtrack for such nightmares. Just kidding! Like fellow Bristol natives Portishead, the Third Eye Foundation (otherwise known as TEF, 3EF, or Matt Elliot) is endlessly compared to soundtracks of nightmares, creepy sleepless nights, and haunting films that haven't been made. Entertainment Weekly called Third Eye Foundation's music ""like a soundtrack to some great lost surrealist film."" Flagpole writes that Elliot, who collaborated with Flying Saucer Attack in their earlier days, comes up with ""some most disturbing dream soundtracks."" Wasn't this cliché beaten into submission like three years ago? Third Eye Foundation's third full-length on Merge can be aptly described with the vocabulary of nightmares. That is, the album's mood could be described as ""haunted,"" ""lonely,"" ""lingering urban darkness,"" ""chilling ambient constructions of uncertain sonic terrain,"" ""layers of bleak drones that crumble under breakbeats and digital bleeps,"" ""spooky pastiche,"" ""eerie,"" and ""otherworldly."" But any respectable nightmare isn't comprised of haunted-house synths and spooky loops of minor-key drones. Truly disturbing dreams are made of uncomfortable pacing, plodding anticipation, and disarming juxtapositions. And that's what's missing from Little Lost Soul. A lack of reference to relevant cultural narratives is what separates Little Lost Soul's innocuously pleasant spook-out from albums like Endtroducing that manipulate you into sonic spaces in which you might feel hesitant to step forward before finding yourself pushed. DJ Shadow's uncomfortably alluring concoction of cultural references and urban found-sound tag-teamed familiar beats with cinematic pacing. Clearly, it has a far greater chance of approximating the world of dreams than bent drones and choirgirl vocals run through reverb pedals. When Matt Elliot rid himself of the rougher textures and harder jungle beats of his 1997 LP, Ghost, some of Third Eye Foundation's nervous energy was traded in for a sound palate that shared more than just a few tricks with the more goth end of the new age spectrum. On Little Lost Soul, Elliot has pointlessly sugared the pill with smoother production, and as a result, the album lacks the power of the dreamworlds its eerie textures allude to. Personally, I'd rather swallow the less refined Ghost. If we're going to sugar the pill, it better not be a placebo.","Last night, I dreamt that my roommate and I bought too much swordfish to cook for\n\ dinner. Except it ...

It's an institution. Unfortunately for Turing Machine, it's an institution that's already been founded and largely drained of its grant money. Countless bands have approached its information desk, filled out their forms, collected their funding, recorded timeless albums, and faded back into obscurity. Sure, the genre spawned its share of legends, but these days, it takes more than just repeating unusual melodic and rhythmic patterns to warrant peoples' interest. That said, the main problem Turing Machine faces is that they aren't fronted by a lyricist. The music is fine on its own, recalling bands like Unwound, Shellac, and these guys' former full-time outfit, Pitchblende. But without a vocal melody to hold things together, this is just another faceless indie band rehashing what Trans Am and Don Caballero have already accomplished. Still, the New York-based trio have made the most of their craft and their execution is almost flawless. These seven tracks are no less listenable than anything issued by Turing Machine's predecessors. Distorted guitars ring through A New Machine for Living like windchimes in a tropical hurricane, the drumset is mercilessly punished for refusing to follow orders, and time signatures go through more changes than David Bowie's sexual preference in a London nightclub. Other things Turing Machine have going for them are their tightness, their raw vigor, and their technical prowess. If nothing else, this album is a great example of what can be achieved on a technical level when a band truly puts their heart into the music. The best part is, this band is rumored to be as proficient live as they are on record, if not more so. Sadly, that doesn't make their album any more interesting. (Though, I probably will check them out when they come through town.) It's not as much the kind of music these guys play as when they're playing it. In the critical indie rock climate of 2000, this style of music has not only been done before, its time has also practically passed. The 1990s saw plenty of this type of stuff going on, specifically from labels like Touch and Go and Thrill Jockey, but if people wanted to hear the same type of thing done over and over again, they would have cloned Menudo years ago. We're in a new decade now, and just as disco withered at the end of the 70s, the time has come to lay pretentious instrumental indie rock to rest. Nope, it didn't take long to mine and hollow this limited genre. Any original sound that could be drawn out of guitars, bass and drums has long since been extracted. Yeah, there are probably a few things that haven't been tried out yet, but I can't think of what they might be. And apparently, neither could Turing Machine, a band whose ferocious sound will either mark the last time anyone attempted this kind of aggressive background music, or be forgotten among stacks and stacks of similarly artsy noise-rock LPs. It's conceivable that Turing Machine could offer an infinitely more creative follow-up sometime next year. After all, this is only their debut album. But if A New Machine for Living is any indicator of things to come, this band's tragic downfall will have been that they simply didn't introduce enough of their own vision into the mix to make their music relevant.","Angular instrumental indie rock.

That's what I say. These unfortunate souls-- and I think we all know a handful-- will never quite grasp what it is that makes the rest of us so enamored of the work of Pan American's Mark Nelson, and other cinematic ambient artists. Patience is a virtue. The Best Things Come to Those Who Wait. Ah, which cliché shall I evoke next? Tempting as it may be for Mr. Casual Listener, as mentioned above, to dismiss music that takes its time to get going, he does it a great disservice by actually doing so. Nelson revels in the small details-- the subtle shifts in texture and sound. When recording with his creepy Virginian avant-o-mates in Labradford, Nelson concentrates on instrumental interplay in pieces that are simultaneously soothingly static and unsettling. But when left to his solo devices, we find Pan American notching out the more dub-influenced groove sensibilities that lingered in some of Labradford's work. It's been said that Lab-mate Carter Brown's more typical muso approach to composition tempers Nelson's electronics- descended leanings. That argument is given credence here on this second-- and quite remarkable-- album under Nelson's Pan American moniker. All manner of vaguely eerie atmospheres abound on this record, yet for all the surface iciness, there's a beckoning textural warmth that keeps it from sounding distant. With headphones, the craft of the sonics is more readily absorbed-- at wimpy low levels, this stuff would probably be about as interesting as listening to distant street traffic. But, as anyone who's truly had their ass kicked by great music knows, volume gets results. Quickly. Turn this shit up if it isn't rocking your boat, in other words. Only then will the lovely clanging and dubby bass of ""Double Rail"" nail all the right places in your little black heart. At low levels, guest vocalists Low and backing music on ""Code"" could be mistaken for some crazy religious radio station with some worrisome repeated chanting. Up goes the listening level, and you're being grooved along thusly by the pounding kicks, ringing dub-rhythmic chords and echoed hats and cymbals, while the rather lovely minor-key chant drills itself into your brain. Nelson's work here is not too derivative in itself, but traces of artists like Pole, Global Communication, and the Basic Channel/Chain Reaction stable are in attendance. Here and there, Nelson goes on auto-pilot for a little too long: ""Coastal"" seems a bit too content to ride a vaguely lovely but ultimately too-featureless pattern to its inevitable end several minutes later. Bits of ""K. Luminate"" meander, which is understandable over the course of a nine or ten minute track. The addition of Chicago Underground Duo cornetist Rob Mazurek would seem to be a nice avant touch to the otherwise electronic tracks, but it works better on paper than on the record. His playing, while a warm complement at times, usually sticks out like a sore thumb. It seems particularly forced into unlikely spots on the closer, ""Both Ends Fixed,"" a track which otherwise follows another savory recipe of deep bass, echoing percussion, and laidback chordal repetition. All in all, chalk up another worthy and fascinating chapter to Kranky's already formidable post-rock/experimental catalogue. Come, Mr. Casual Listener, pray with me and my congregation at the Sonic Altar in the Church of Studio Wizardry, won't you? We're a fine bunch, once you get to know us.",,7.8,
Audiot EP,AM/FM,by: Brent DiCrescenzo,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a06e13d19756521383a2/1:1/w_160/4618d04c.gif,2000-01-31 06:00:07,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/146-audiot-ep/,Skylab Operations,"So, David Crosby is the father of Melissa Etheridge's baby. Millions of Americans stopped eating lunch when that news hit. After all, Crosby isn't exactly the ideal sperm donor. He's bald, a reformed coke/heroin addict, overweight, friends with Graham Nash and Neil Young, not pretty, and really old. The guy is as pure as Bayonne. (Personally, I'd have gone with Pete Sampras or Paul McCartney.) This child will live its life under the constant observation of secondary media. And odds are, the kid will eventually end up in music (give it 15 years or so). Now, there's a pretty good chance, based on his genealogy, that Junior's rock will sound like AM/FM. Okay, yeah, so that's in no way a great endorsement for this album, but hear me out. After Junior goes through that inevitable punk phase-- which will result from the emotional turmoil of growing up as celebrity offspring, making headlines as an ""Access Hollywood"" lens target, and teenagers' innate reflexes to rebel against their parents-- he'll settle down and realize that his dad had it going on in the 1960s. All of these accumulated influences and tastes might meringue up into the frothy multi-track folk of Audiot. There's a Byrdsian, tambourine-slapping sincerity throughout this record. Brian Sokel, the brain of AM/FM, normally punches timecards as the guitarist for dub-punk Clash revivalists Franklin. Traces of Franklin's relaxed, spread guitar effects trickle into AM/FM, like the scribbling palm-muted guitar and above-the-fret plucking under the acoustics in ""The Death They Claim."" Sokel's attention to detail buries subtle perks throughout the EP. Organs, lap steel, backwards effects, treated vocals, tin whistle, and layers of guitars blend together into a nice, if not somewhat irresolute, foam. But AM/FM's quest for the ""nice"" leaves them short of pertinence. Advice: highlight those backward swirls, let the guitar solos rip forth from obnoxious red levels, let the guitars hide under the organ (not vice versa), and raise your voice above a sighing croon. Of course, these are typical shortcomings on a solo debut, and thankfully, Sokel shows enough audiophilic retentiveness to promise greater things. At EP length, Audiot makes a welcome skip through suburban fields. Even the design is fresh and shows some effort outside of an Adobe program. Yet oddly, every photograph is taken with high overhead light, turning Sokel's eyes into gaping black sockets. Throughout the liner notes, not a single eye can be seen. This small shortcoming reflects the songwriting. Brian, let us look into your eyes!","So, David Crosby is the father of Melissa Etheridge's baby.

Crooked Fingers,Crooked Fingers,by: Nick Mirov,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6a85e6ef95969320dbe/1:1/w_160/16434df6.gif,2000-01-31 06:00:06,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1671-crooked-fingers/,Warm,"""Dig yourself into a deeper hole/ Deeper than the deepest hole you know,"" sings Eric Bachmann on his eponymous Crooked Fingers album. It's a line that seems less suited for his latest project than a perfect summation of his former band, onetime indie-rock heroes Archers of Loaf. Throughout their bruised and battered lifespan, it seemed as if the Archers were intent on digging their own grave, eschewing the heady guitar squall of Icky Mettle for increasingly darker tales of despair and collapse. On their final album, White Trash Heroes, they managed to achieve the kind of self-negating, black-hole sonics that few bands besides Nirvana or Radiohead have ever reached (or tried to reach). Where before the Archers' guitars would ramble and bump into each other with clumsy abandon, on White Trash Heroes they were strung with razor wire, wrapping lacerating riffs around Bachmann's ruined throat, and hurling the songs headlong into the void. You can almost hear the band itself blinking out of existence as the searing tones of the last track are cut short in mid-flight. Crooked Fingers is the sound of Bachmann finally reaching the bottom of the bottomless pit and finding that it isn't such a bad place after all. Despite his recurring lyrical themes of drinking, darkness, decay, being broken, being set on fire, creeping evil, and more drinking, the music possesses a sort of dignified grace, illuminating crumbling and bombed-out neighborhoods with a few sepia-toned rays of light. Gone are the Archers' distortion pedals and conventional guitar-rock context. They're replaced by countryish fingerpicking, chiming arpeggios, and warm, sweeping strings. It's easily the most thoughtful, cohesive work Bachmann has ever recorded. Archers albums were inventive yet haphazard affairs, with one or two tracks that felt out of place or were just plain bad; Crooked Fingers is the product of a more focused artistic vision, and thus has a welcome consistency of tone and quality. Of course, one man's consistency is another man's ""repetitive and boring."" And yes, Bachmann does tend to repeat himself lyrically, but at least he's rediscovered the time-honored pop-music tradition of juxtaposing his depressing lyrics with pretty melodies (a trait noticeably lacking from later Archers material-- at least the pretty melodies part). The believability factor of Crooked Fingers might also be an issue for some; while we hear Tom Waits' weathered croak of a voice and can imagine that he's lived through the songs he's written, the same voice and songs coming from an indie rocker like Bachmann are slightly less convincing. Regardless, his singing has clearly improved over the years and complements the newfound Mercury Rev-like lushness of the music well-- be it his trademark growl on rousing beer-hall singalongs like ""New Drink for the Old Drunk"" or a wistful falsetto on shimmery ballads such as ""Crowned in Chrome"" and ""Broken Man."" So go ahead, have another drink or three. Stay up all night wallowing in self-pity and disgust. Crooked Fingers understands; Eric Bachmann will be right beside you, waiting to greet the crack of dawn with bleary eyes and a mixture of disappointment and relief that the rest of the world hasn't yet been destroyed.","""Dig yourself into a deeper hole/ Deeper than the deepest hole you know,"" sings Eric Bachmann on his eponymous Crooked ...

Goodbye 20th Century,Sonic Youth,by: Brent S.

Failing this vast millenarianism, we might at least expect a new Daydream Nation to capture the fin de siecle as that earlier album had lent words and noise to the wane of the Reagan years. Goodbye 20th Century, the fourth release in the ""SYR Musical Perspectives"" series, is no such thing. In fact, rather than apocalyptic, the somber dissonance on Goodbye waxes somewhat elegiac. The album offers very little by way of grand proclamations; Goodbye 20th Century is very much about listening: listening to the composers, listening to the past, listening to one another. Although much more turbulent than the distant electric storms of the series' last release, the ethereal Invito al Cielo, Goodbye 20th Century conjures similar alchemies of cacophony and serenity. But the new album has less to do with free improv extensions of SYR3. Rather, we hear the band (boasting an impressive roster of guests) interpreting the work of past masters. Along with more renowned modern composers like John Cage, Steve Reich and Pauline Oliveros, Sonic Youth & Co. play pieces by Stockhausen protégé Cornelius Cardrew, experimental violinist Takehisha Kosugi (who performs on the album), and atonal-chromaticist James Tenney. Sonic Youth is joined again by Jim O'Rourke, along with New York downtown turntablist Christian Marclay, composer Christian Wolff (who also contributes a piece), percussionist William Winant, and longtime Sonic Youth producer Wharton Tiers. Goodbye 20th Century-- over a hundred minutes in length-- rewards the patient, and will confound those fans still holding out for another EVOL. But those who criticize the late-90s Sonic Youth for straying far from its art-punk, no-wave roots would level criticism at the band for trying to pull off another edgy, noisy Sister in the 18th year of their career. To their credit, Sonic Youth has not made any last ditch attempt to conform to any estimations of what they should be doing. Goodbye 20th Century is not a renunciation of their post-punk roots, but rather a tribute to those more difficult influences that have always been present in their music-- aside from the chosen compositions, one could make out the presence of Coltrane, Cecil Taylor and Glenn Branca as well as Varese. Nor could one accuse Sonic Youth of parading this wide array of distinguished composers and players in front of the listener only to position themselves as masters and inheritors of the 20th century new classical tradition. If anything, Goodbye 20th Century is an album of humility, displaying devotion and awe on the part of the musicians for the sheer possibility coded into the compositions. The half-hour-long interpretation of John Cage's 1992 composition ""Four6"" stands at the heart of the two-disc set, and best exemplifies the work's aesthetic of entwined beauty and monstrosity. Other highlights include ""Six for a New Time,"" a piece that Pauline Oliveros composed specifically for the occasion, and James Tenney's ""Having Never Written a Note for Percussion,"" an uprising of droning guitar under the direction of Jim O'Rourke. But let's not kid ourselves. Goodbye 20th Century is difficult music: music that is not supposed to be enjoyed so much as to be endured. To purchase this album is to purchase over an hour-and-a-half of some of the most abrasive noise imaginable outside of an industrial factory setting. And you must find what's beautiful. This is perhaps why I have found the SYR series so engaging-- because the experience of listening to these releases amounts to a considerable amount of introspection: you must rethink your categories every minute, you must continuously reassess the boundaries of music and noise, structure and disorder. But if all you hear is dissonance and feedback and Kim Gordon's hot, ghostly musings, you're not listening.","Based on the players, the title, and the time of its release, one might\n\ expect Sonic Youth's Goodbye ...

On the back, it says ""Manda White House"" in penciled cursive. A Spanish style, two stories, vines growing across the railing of the balcony. It looks like California. I didn't find this in a scrapbook, an old photo album, or a newspaper clipping. This photograph was Elmer-glued to the front cover of the new record from the Jim Yoshii Pile-Up. Not printed on, not drawn on, but glued by hand. For some of you, this may be all you need-- a record so lo-fi, so DIY, and so indie that the band sat up all night in their garage gluing old Kodaks to the cover of their record. But I'm not writing to you-- I'm writing to people like me who are sick of lo-fi, a sound whose aesthetics take more studio time to perfect than if a band just sat down and produced the damn album. People have used cushioned toilet seats as bass drums. Nice gimmick, but how does it sound? The Jim Yoshii Pile-Up would never pull that stunt. If lo-fi is banging on toilet seats then this album is a velvet-topped throne. It's soft and gorgeous-- as opposed to tape hiss and drenched reverb, these guys pull out clean guitars, restrained beats, rolling bass, and whispering vocals-- and it could be the soundtrack for the most relaxing bath you've even taken. Trust me. Put away the candles and whale sounds. But the Jim Yoshii Pile-Up isn't all candlelit baths (or as I call them, Friday nights without a date). The guys crank it up a notch on songs like ""Harmless Hobby or Bicycle Crash"", a song with the best build since Slint's ""Washer"". It opens with the low rumble of a fiery bass and a fierce staccato guitar line. Three minutes in, the dissonance arrives. Clashing riffs culminate into an overwhelming crescendo before Yoshii's voice re-enters the mix, calming the struggle. Looking at the cover photograph, it somehow makes sense. The same way that ""Everybody's Talkin'"" worked so well in Midnight Cowboy. A slow pan from one window to the next, peering in the shutters for the forbidden sight of a naked girl as echoing Gibsons climax. The rhythm matches the slow turn to the photographer, lovelorn and looking for a way in. As he makes up his mind, resolutely walking to the front door, the camera clicks, the record ends, and the uncertainty begins.",,8.0,

Nearly every review I've read proclaims the new record to be ""a return to form"" or ""a return to their hard rocking days"" or ""the true follow-up to Siamese Dream."" Obviously, they're trying to distance MACHINA from Adore, the least successful Pumpkins record to date. The whole thing stinks of PR. MACHINA just sounds like a continuation of Adore. It's the infinite sadness to Adore's Mellon Collie. In fact, Adore showcased greater variation, better production, and about as much ""rocking."" Writers keep focusing on Jimmy Chamberlin's return, but the venerable Joey Waronker, who played all over Adore, was similarly talented. Besides, Chamberlin's overproduced, steady clicking on MACHINA sounds exactly like-- and might as well be-- a drum machine. Every track on MACHINA sits in a heavy syrup of synthesizer. Flood deep-fries the sound in golden calf fat. Guitars hiss like hig pressure hoses. Gelatinous bass issues from the crust like pus. The psoriatic sound comes off like infected yellow scabs growing on fragile frosted glass. If this is a ""return to form,"" Billy Corgan has thrown his baby-head out with the bathwater. Siamese Dream never utilized computer and keyboard crutches to such a degree. Every generation of kids in black needs a goth martyr, and Billy vies for their troubled hearts throughout MACHINA. Plodding numbers like ""The Crying Tree of Mercury"" and ""Blue Skies Bring Tears"" steal liberally from the cemetary-obsessed Cure songs that never seem to make it to singles compilations. Even the albums strongest tracks-- ""Wound"", ""Raindrops + Sunshowers"", and the ironically titled ""Try, Try, Try""-- lugubriously cruise along like New Order in a crystal convertible flossed out with chrome. Sadly, an ego scud has detonated on Corgan's muse, distributing the gore between the territories of 4AD, Windham Hill, Cleopatra, and Elementree. The result is songs like ""Heavy Metal Machine"", a static-drenched dinosaur that slowly shits Soundgarden's ""Rusty Cage"", and the hysterical ""Glass and the Ghost Children"", in which Chamberlin pulls his best Neil Peart imitation while Corgan and Iha spittle fuzz like Orgy covering Cream's Disraeli Gears. Midway through the ten-minute bulk of ""Ghost Children"", a lone piano interludes while tapes of Corgan confessionals crackle on top: ""I always assume that the voice I hear is the voice of God,"" he proclaims. ""So I'm operating on the premise that I hear the voice of God."" Atheists rejoice. Then, four more minutes of underwater gongs and seagull guitars bring you back down from the laughter. And just to put the official seal on The World's Most Pretentious Stadium Rock Song Ever certificate, Corgan finishes with the refrain: ""As she counted the spiders/ As they crawled up inside her."" The Pumpkins' fascination with sepia tones, parchment, and God kills whatever joy might otherwise be gleaned from their fifth LP. Filling the entire capacity of a compact disc, MACHINA simply blabbers on far too long. Even grating tracks like ""The Everlasting Gaze"" become appreciated for the fact that they at least grate. The problems with Billy Corgan are conveniently packaged in the track ""I of the Mourning"" (note the fucking ""u""). Over reheated new wave pop and fluff-metal that sparks under microwaves, Corgan whines through his wax-paper septum, ""Radio/ Play my favourite song/ Radio/ Radio/ Radio/ I'm alone/ Pick up where my thoughts left off."" Radio is a commercial-bloated joke. When's the last time, Pitchfork reader, you heard your favorite song on the radio? Who even listens to the radio? Who finds solace in FM? I mean, shit, what do they even play these days? Oh. The Smashing Pumpkins.","Billy Corgan needs someone on his shoulder to whisper ""no."" The angel has apparently taken a break for now, but ...

Oddballs,Frank Black,by: Ryan Kearney,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a2f39d034d5c69bf2cf2/1:1/w_160/90ae3949.gif,2000-01-31 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/779-oddballs/,eMusic,"I've been keeping a secret, but since I've only written two reviews for Pitchfork, I figure no damage has been done yet. To avoid a potentially disastrous situation in the future-- which would inevitably involve accusations of fraudulence-- I'll fess up now: I didn't grow up on indie rock. I know everyone has had their embarrassing early years, but I didn't get into indie rock until the Pixies' Bossanova. After that discovery, I backtracked to Fugazi, Big Black and other revelatory bands. But before I knew it, Nirvana's Nevermind had arrived and I was off to boarding school. Nirvana, of course, was the beginning and the end, all at once. College confined me within ivied brick walls that refused entrance to any music that didn't ""jam."" The Internet did not exist then. I was isolated and force-fed Phish and the Grateful Dead, among others. As no one shared my interests, these bands soon fought The Pixies and Fugazi for space in my CD player. Then, after graduating, I entered a university with a burgeoning indie scene. Sadly, I was four years behind. I slaved to catch up. Luckily, I haven't forgotten my roots. The Pixies still sound as fresh as they did back in 1990, and my loyalties remain true. Which is why I followed Pixies frontman Black Francis' transformation into Frank Black. His self-titled debut and Teenager of the Year are inarguably brilliant pop records, doused with Black's trademark weirdness and originality. 1996's The Cult of Ray, on the other hand, was a heinous letdown, and Frank knew he had to change direction. He did. His next two albums, Frank Black and the Catholics and Pistolero, were strong, straightforward rock 'n' roll records recorded live to two-track. Now, don't take that the wrong way-- I said they were strong, not incredible; one wouldn't necessarily want to hear the songs that were left off. Oddballs, though, is a collection of such leftovers-- you know, b-sides and outtakes-- that were recorded between 1994 and 1997. These were his less innovative years, so it's no surprise that this record is about as dispensable as the plot of Gladiator. The opening track, ""Pray a Little Faster"", is the encapsulation of Frank Black at his weakest, replete with basic chord variations and an unexceptional solo. ""Village of the Sun"" (circa The Cult of Ray) is yet another song that opens with hushed vocals over buried keyboards. And the punk opening of ""At the End of the World"" is reminiscent of Teenager of the Year's ""Bad, Wicked World"", yet the song slows for the chorus, apparently so that Black can showcase his vocals at their most Dicky Barrett. His lyrics don't help matters, either. Where Black once effortlessly spewed line after line of unquestionable genius, he now resorts to lines like, ""Well, I've been hanging downside-up."" Not quite as eloquently stated as, say, ""We go to sleep/ As breathing flows, my mind secedes."" On ""Hate Me"", he must be joking when he screams, guttural as ever, ""Hate me/ My jacket's not right.../ Hate me/ My shirt is shitty."" At least, I hope he is. And if you thought ""I Don't Want to Hurt You (Every Single Time)"" was his corniest song ever, meet its contender, ""Can I Get a Witness"", which features the spectacular awakening, ""Maybe you've got faith in where this is going/ Maybe I'll pull up the stakes, and I'll be letting go."" As one would expect from a legend, though, there are some redeeming moments. ""Just a Little"" is a catchy, Western guitar-tinged cover of the folk-rock band The Beau Brummels' 1965 track. The tempo of ""Jumpin' Beans"" cleverly befits its title, and its simple poetic phrasing ranks it alongside Frank's best solo work. And the title track is another rare gem; ""Odd-balls,"" he chimes during the simple, yet affecting chorus, ""Well, everybody's different."" And even if the music here still isn't up to par with his Pixies days, at least it includes lines like, ""Mathematics moves at such a crawl/ And gravity is a-mighty strong."" Oddballs also ends fittingly. The last two minutes of the closer, ""Man of Steel"", a track culled from the X-Files soundtrack, Songs in the Key of X, is utterly repetitive, forcing one to forget the album's high points. As far as producing raucous music, our subject is a man of steel, but even the real Man of Steel is now para... well, I'm not gonna say it.","I've been keeping a secret, but since I've only written two reviews for Pitchfork, I figure no damage ...

The Roots Come Alive,The Roots,by: Taylor M. Clark,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a2a9ea9e61561daa4ad0/1:1/w_160/2504f3aa.gif,2000-01-31 06:00:01,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6833-the-roots-come-alive/,MCA,"On a stormy eve in recent history, the legendary Roots crew deigned to pay a visit to the illustrious educational institution that I attend, which happens to be overwhelmingly white. The Roots, if you didn't know, are overwhelmingly black, which made for quite an interesting evening. 'Fork editor Ryan had sent me The Roots Come Alive for review, so I felt it my duty as a critic to pay far too much cash in order to bear witness to this live music phenomenon. And what a spectacle it was. As the seething throng of white bodies lurched quasi-rhythmically to the abundance of soul presented on stage, I began to wonder if The Roots really felt compelled to try very hard to impress the crowd. I would imagine that this is something of a burning question for The Roots, who play a massive 250 shows each year. They could be doing crossword puzzles up there while halfheartedly rapping, and the vast majority of the crowd would still be jumping around madly. This particular crowd was so thoroughly unfunky that when Black Thought thrust the mic toward the crowd for an exhaustively planned and explained ""rock, rock on"" for the tenth time, the crowd still seemed genuinely surprised and temporarily stunned. So something just seems fundamentally askew when, for example, Black Thought busts out with a ""y'all wit' me, Switzerland?"" after an ill groove on The Roots Come Alive. Grandmaster Flash would roll over in his grave, and he's not even dead yet. Regardless, The Roots' devastatingly funky show is represented pretty accurately on The Roots Come Alive. The problem with this record is that the group is fairly rugged and raw, replete with their live instrumentation, on their proper LPs. Thus, a live album by The Roots adds very little beyond crowd noise and many extra ""y'know what I'm sayin'""s. The songs are more or less faithfully recreated, with highlights being the creative beatboxing and vocal scratching that are absent from the originals. Black Thought continues to be one of the most intelligent and skilled MCs in the business, but this is no more apparent here than on their prior works. For the amount of talent ?uestlove has, the beats he throws down are too often trite, with a hard snare hit inevitably falling on counts two and four. He does break it down for the people on ""You Got Me"", just as he does on the Things Fall Apart version, but such moments are too few and far between. The primary appeal of The Roots Come Alive for fanatics is the inclusion of two new studio recordings on the disc, the weaker of which also appears on the soundtrack to The Best Man. (You're about as likely to remember this Taye Diggs classic as you are to recall The Wood.) On ""The Lesson-- Part III"", however, The Roots are in top form, offering a promising vision of continued mastery on forthcoming records. Overall, though, a live album should be awfully exceptional in execution or reinvention to garner a high rating, regardless of the quality of the original tracks. As fresh as The Roots can be onstage, this performance resembles the majority of other live records on the shelves today-- it's merely average when held against the studio material.","On a stormy eve in recent history, the legendary Roots crew deigned to pay a visit to the illustrious educational ...

To You Alone EP,The Beta Band,by: Brent DiCrescenzo,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a2845e6ef95969320426/1:1/w_160/d189fe66.gif,2000-01-31 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/667-to-you-alone-ep/,Regal,"In the Beta Band's hotel room a collage sat unfinished on the faux-wood table. The piece depicted Europe with substituted country names and surreal clippings. Scandinavia was dubbed ""Cock & Balls""; Switzerland was noted only for their chocolate. Humorous cut-and-paste crafts aren't typical rock 'n' roll hotel room behavior. Yet after hearing the Beta Band, little else is expected. It's reassuring to step behind the curtain and realize the giant talking head of the wizard is actually a giant talking wizard's head. The Beta Band really do live in their pastiche pastures and carry Dada handbags. Their new stand-alone single proves they're still burning fuel past escape velocity-- they effortlessly surpass their peers with two seemingly simple songs. ""To You Alone"" opens with a bellowing bass pulse and tantric humming before stuttering into epileptic beats and a plaintive keyboard melody. The song punches a hole through the back of TLC's ""No Scrubs"", rips out the spine, and reconstructs an interstellar psychedelic booty call. Further blurring the line between dance, jazz, rock, and folk, ""To You Alone"" manages to make an 808 blurt out hair-raising space-pop. A crescendo of drums pile up during the chorus. Steve Mason weaves a unique take on unrequited love with his longing lyrics. ""You do not realize the line that runs from me across the universe to you alone,"" he sadly observes. The impending doom of the one-way relationship is wonderfully wrapped in the metaphor: ""A black box inside my mind recalls the time we spend together."" Finally, he proclaims in a mix of pride and resignation, ""I'm gonna sing it like a fool/ I've been singing like a fool."" The Beta Band's ability to touch on such emotions while simultaneously expanding pop music's vocabulary justifies every ounce of hype surrounding them. ""Sequinsizer"" provides more of an instrumental funk. The nocturnal urban pulse blends Aphex Twin's ""Windowlicker"" and Primal Scream's ""Swastika Eyes"". A clarinet drifts over basslines that rocket like metro lines. Fat keyboards make the groove positively nasty. With a single track, the Beta Band offhandedly outdate everything Underworld pumped out in the last couple years. If Miles Davis worked with Warp Records, this might be the result. On this single, the Beta Band recontextualize hip-hop and city rhythms into their sylvan fantasy planet. You can take Mos Def, your so-called hip-hop savior, and shove him up your Monch-- you can find him ""keeping it real"" on the new Scritti Politti record. When it comes to futuristic hip-hop-- and rock for that matter-- I'd rather place my bets on these four scruffy Scots.","In the Beta Band's hotel room a collage sat unfinished on the faux-wood table.

Mirror,Flying Saucer Attack,by: Ryan Schreiber,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Founder</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bdde13d197565213b638/1:1/w_160/6db4cb96.gif,2000-01-26 06:01:40,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3124-mirror/,Drag City,"For many long years, the name Flying Saucer Attack has been synonymous with ringing distortion, interstellar radio transmissions and bursts of sonic noise like crashing tides. Usually, a delicately-plucked acoustic can be distinguished underneath the dense layers of static. Around 1996, Rachel Brook departed, leaving only Dave Pearce to continue the Flying Saucer Attack legacy. Soon after, Pearce released New Lands, an album similar to its predecessors, but with no real sign of drive or inspiration. Surprisingly, just when it looked as though Flying Saucer Attack had done all they were capable of, the long-awaited Mirror is finally issued, restoring fans' faith in Dave Pearce's ability to record original music. From straight out of left field, Flying Saucer Attack present their best album since 1995's Further. Sonically, it's Pearce's most accessible and melodic record to date, due largely to the fact that the levels seem to be switched-- on most previous outings, atmospheric feedback and buzzing dominated the mix while Dave Pearce sang quietly in the background; on Mirror, it's quite the opposite. Here, the songs are the main focus (as they should be), and the effects are pushed just below the surface. Songwise, though, Pearce is still riding the same wave. His somber acoustic folk still recalls the gentle melancholy of Nick Drake, but for the first time, the melodies and lyrics can actually be clearly deciphered. Of course, the entire album isn't composed of simple folky musings-- that'd be boring! Pearce keeps it varied this time around, implementing actual percussion on a few of the numbers, and being generally inventive. Even when songs run past the eight minute mark, like the beautiful ""Islands,"" they morph through distinct and attention-grabbing phases, beginning sparsely and building into spiraling crescendos of drug-addled bliss. And speaking of drugs, how about that packaging?! Flying Saucer Attack albums have always been easily characterized by their vast stretches of flatland and other places uninhabited by humans. When I first saw the cover of Mirror, I honestly thought I was looking at a Grateful Dead reissue. And in place of liner notes is a blatantly hallucinogenic image of a psychedelic rainbow over a body of water, with creepy mutations of animals splashing about, and warped, gloopy flying saucers zooming past pink clouds. In a time when drugs are so revered by the hipster elite, it's good to see somebody living it up a little. But the cover art isn't all that's changed for Flying Saucer Attack. On Mirror Pearce experiments with new sounds and genres. In between his standard spacy acoustic numbers, he also jumps on the electronic bandwagon (albeit a little late), fusing beats copped from drum-n-bass and hip-hop into the latter sections of the album. Interestingly, the track that benefits most noticeably from the newly-incorporated drum tracks is ""River,"" which employs a basic rock beat that fuels a rare ethereal, distortion-soaked pop song. If you're new to Flying Saucer Attack and are looking for a good introduction to their twisted world of mind-bending space-psych, Mirror is probably the place to start. As I said, it's easily the most accessible of the bunch. Of course, Further is still a more cohesive, better- orchestrated effort. You make the call. I'm just happy the guy's still creative.","For many long years, the name Flying Saucer Attack has been synonymous with ringing distortion, interstellar radio transmissions and bursts ...

Designing a Nervous Breakdown,The Anniversary,by: Taylor M.

I highly recommend this activity. For the most part, the Pop Tart is quite a delicious toaster pastry, replete with tasty frosting and sticky filling. But sadly, the Pop Tart is not without its ailments. The first of these is the Crust Problem-- for every delectable, filling-enhanced bite, one must also endure an equal number of bites sullied by what is mostly flavorless crust. The discerning Pop Tart enthusiast will go to such lengths as to actually eliminate all crust-only zones before attempting the more flavorful middle area. This is something of a pain. The second problem is the Unnecessary Multiplicity Problem, which is that Pop Tarts are packaged in groups of two. In order to maximize freshness, one must eat both at once or risk a stale Pop Tart. Except in rare occasions, the marginal utility of the second Pop Tart is greatly diminished to the point of seeming bland, as its consumption is a totally identical experience to the previous Pop Tart. The Anniversary's Designing a Nervous Breakdown is quite like a package of 10 Pop Tarts; it flourishes and fails in the same capacities. Upon listening to the first track, one is immediately struck by its sugary sweet goodness. Still, the listener finds himself mentally trimming away some of the blander passages in order to more greatly enjoy the really good parts, in a fashion similar to the Crust Problem. The Unnecessary Multiplicity Problem also crops up, as every one of the 10 songs is nearly indistinguishable from the last. Same guitar distortion. Same harmonies. Same emo lyrics. Same moog. Sure, the first song is delicious, but after eating virtually the same Pop Tart a few times, they will invariably irritate your stomach, no matter how palatable they initially seem. Sonically, the Anniversary is an interesting amalgam of pop styles. Do you remember ""Friends of P"" by the Rentals? Yes, the one with the ultra-catchy moog riff in the chorus that was impossible to banish from your head, as much as it embarrassed you to be humming oscillating octaves. Don't make degrading jokes about that riff around the Anniversary-- they won't laugh. The Anniversary really enjoyed that song. At least enough to include the exact same kind of moog riff in literally every song on Designing a Nervous Breakdown. Add equal parts 80's New Wave and slightly derivative punk-ish chord progressions reminiscent of the best moments of early Blink 182 (which are not many) and you have the foundation for virtually any Anniversary song. The opening guitar parts for both ""All Things Ordinary"" and ""The D in Detroit"" are almost absolutely identical, down to the same chords. And the two are only one song apart. They could have at least changed key! But despite the obnoxiously prominent similarities between each song on Designing a Nervous Breakdown, the format from which they mold the songs is still rather tasty. Much like a savory Pop Tart, I plan to consume the Anniversary again in the future, just not in vast quantities at one time. What a shame that Designing a Nervous Breakdown isn't also an excellent source of 7 vitamins and minerals, as its edible colleague is. Perhaps it would enhance the appeal of future Anniversary discs if they offered a variety pack, hopefully including a ""S'mores"" flavor. Just an idea.","Right now, I'm eating a Pop Tart.

Ode Music EP,Will Oldham,by: Taylor M.

He was probably most concerned with fulfilling the New Year's Resolution he seems to have made way back in 1993. You know the one I'm talking about. That year, Will Oldham began competing with such corporate giants as the ""Book of the Month Club"" and the ""Fruit of the Month Club"" by unofficially creating the ""Will Oldham Release of the Month Club."" Since then, Oldham has recorded music under more monikers than most bands have songs: Palace (Brothers/Music/Songs), Bonnie ""Prince"" Billy, the Sundowners, Will Oldham and Friends, to name just a few. He's been true to his convictions thus far, sometimes sacrificing quality for quantity, but churning out records at a frantic pace nonetheless. The Ode Music EP is a particularly confounding case to examine. On one hand, you can't fault him too much, because he never intended for the album to stand alone-- it was composed as an instrumental soundtrack to the Kelly Reichardt film of the same name. In that regard, it succeeds admirably. I imagine that this music would be quite a pleasant addition to any movie with ""Ode"" in the title. On the other hand, I have to be somewhat upset with Oldham. Somehow, he's managed to get his hands on the first five songs I ever wrote for guitar back in High School. Frankly, I'm a bit embarrassed. To make matters worse, I'm not mentioned anywhere in the liner notes. The five unique songs on Ode Music are so incredibly simple, you may even be inclined to believe me upon actually hearing the album. Allow me to list the chords Oldham demonstrates a thorough mastery of on ""Ode #1,"" for example: C#. Impressive. And it's probably just a C with a capo on the first fret, anyway. What's more, he doesn't stop demonstrating this proficiency for almost eight minutes. And that's not even mentioning the two negligibly different reprises of the song which also appear on the EP. Ode Music is like Will Oldham's acoustic guitar version of house music: each composition is comprised of one basic short riff in either one or two chords, repeated into infinity with almost no variation. After a minute or so, you tend to forget that you're even listening to music at all. Regardless of the music's redundancy, though, it's still quite beautiful in its simplicity. Ode Music utilizes not only guitar, but also sparse piano and synthesizer. After all, the primary goal of the record was to create a soothing atmosphere, and you'll never be caught off guard while listening to this EP. Once you've heard the first 15 seconds of each song, you've basically heard the entire thing. Despite the sheer volume of material he's issued in recent years, Oldham has managed to create a few stunning albums. I See a Darkness, recorded as Bonnie ""Prince"" Billy, is such an extraordinary piece of work that I was initially tempted to conveniently forget to say much about Ode Music in this review and simply praise Darkness instead. After all, there's not much substance behind Ode Music to examine; it's just a whole lot of quantity. But don't despair-- there are still about 50 better Oldham releases out there worth scooping up.","Obviously, Will Oldham wasn't thinking of the music criticism world when he decided to release the Ode Music EP ...

Stop the Panic,Luke Vibert,by: Paul Cooper,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a950c0084474cd0c0ff6/1:1/w_160/71999427.gif,2000-01-25 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8460-stop-the-panic/,AstralwerksAstralwerks,"Some things you have to be in the mood for. Personally, I am never in the mood for egg salad. Occasionally, I am in the mood for Stockhausen's Helicopter Quartet (the one where each member of a string quartet is aloft in a helicopter and skronking out bizarre musique concrete accompanied by the drone and swoop of rotorblades!). I am rarely in the mood for exotica. And Stop the Panic, sadly, is an exotica album. Ugh! The project all started when electro-acoustic egghead David Toop and veteran pedal steel guitarist BJ Cole were yakking on about Les Baxter, Yma Sumac and the other luminaries of that 50's bachelor pad sound. Toop had just published his book on the subject and was filled with the promise that what Stereolab, Plone, and Broadcast had been achieving with their fusion of exotica and Krautrock could also be accomplished in the electronic avant-garde. Toop played Cole some Plug discs and Cole decided that Wagon Christ himself, Luke Vibert, was just the beatnik he wished to get all gaudy and South Sea Islander with. Ugh! Stop the Panic, luckily enough, is not geared for a Tiki Hut experience. I'd feared that Vibert would churn out 13 versions of that wretched ""Lovely"" track that so marred his Tally Ho! record. Though Cole runs through the primer on the Hawaiian glide and the Nashville glissando, Vibert's straight-ahead beats cut the cheese to a tolerable minimum. As Cole blithely swoops and curls his pedal steel line on ""Dischordzilla,"" Vibert slams down rhythmic slabs like he's trying to crush his collaborator. ""Cheng Phooey"" begins life as a low-rumbling 303 line before releasing a venomous burst Polynesian acid. Cole's reaction-- to use his pedal steel as a machine of avant tonal color, as if wishing to wash away the spikes of the bassline. All of this recalls Cole's work with Billie Ray Martin (""4 Ambient Tales"") and starkly demonstrates that the pedal steel associations with beach huts and Nashville can be rent asunder. The duo pay another quick visit to the Land of Shriekin' N' Hollerin' on ""Watery Glass Planet (Part 3)"" and, as with ""Cheng Phooey,"" the pair manage to heighten the gracious beauty of the pedal steel guitar by placing it in an atypical setting. There's a palpable watery glassiness to Cole's solos and Vibert deftly sets Cole's shimmering lines in just the right subtly spacy frame. It's clear that Vibert and Cole haven't jumped on this project as an opportunity to wank around. These talented musicians have considered the profound complexities (and negotiated the fault lines) inherent in exotica. So the big pay off of Stop the Panic is that Cole and Vibert manage to subvert the genre without shoving its most gangrenous aspects in our faces. It was no accident that during the culturally repressed and globally paranoid 1950's, the American market became susceptible to sanitized, surreal images of the peoples who lived in steamy, aboriginal or Communist climes. Exotica was the pop culture banalization of the First World condescension of Joseph ""The Impenetrable"" Conrad. It was such a weird time-- I mean, at what other point in history would a new design of bathing suit was named in honor of a Pacific atoll that had just been cored by the test of a U.S. A-bomb? Yes, the bikini is a memento of First World entitlement. Wear yours with pride! David Toop understands all the cultural resonances within the exotica genre, and Cole and Vibert have listened well to his sherpa-like guidance. Stop the Panic-- I hope-- will be the last word on this fusion of the avant-garde and the lei. However, a sinking feeling nags at me, and reminds me that the Stormtroopers of Marketing will surely seize this album and demand a truckload of tiki-ready platters from far less conscientious musicians. In fact, I'd start panicking now, if I were you-- but that's just the mood I'm in.","Some things you have to be in the mood for. Personally, I am never in the mood for egg salad ...

Their formula isn't difficult to figure out-- herculean, face-punching bass, meatgrinding guitars, lumber-and-cement drums, and a reckless, penis-exposing singer who gargles the microphone. (Though, some Jersey kids in Rye Coalition have almost cracked the code.) The absense of cacophonous, piss-drinking, steel-chewing rock sums up the current climate. Young musicians seem hesitant to frighten and discomfort. The grail of indie rock these days is an erasable hook, odd time signatures, and/or trembling beauty. The Jesus Lizard wanted to chisel bone and blister tissue. Even in Chicago, the birthplace of this rusty genre, the sound seems to have died out with Lustre King. Yet loud, obnoxious music rules the charts these days. The Jesus Lizard never slapped their bass. They never wore warm-ups. There was no DJ. David Yow never rapped. The guys were certainly loud and obnoxious, practically threatening, but there was a visceral charge in listening to their titanic pulse-- their sheer volume majestic. Nestled between the Fall's growling stomp and Shellac's akimbo attack, the Jesus Lizard earned the reputation of ""the best live band."" This was due mostly to belligerence and precision. Mac McNeilly summoned John Bonham, treating each drum like the DEA treats a crackhouse door. David Wm. Sims needed one E-string and a pick to put tremble in your duodonem. Duane Denison cauterized the damage with guitar. Their simplicity allowed room for attitude. Bang, a loose-ends collection of 7""s and compilation tracks, contains several live tracks. While not as imposing as their previous live album, Show, they nonetheless only hint at the power. There's little difference between live and studio versions, as Steve Albini essentially perfectly put the sweat and gristle to analog tape. Lizard classics like ""Gladiator,"" ""Killer McHann,"" and ""Seasick"" sear in these live versions. Rare treats such as the two Trio covers demonstrate the band's sense of humor and pop/new-wave affections. Fortunately, neither of these songs are ""Da Da Da."" For those unfamiliar with the band's body of work, Bang offers their best songs from the pre-Capitol days with a mix of live and studio versions. It's essentially like Show packaged with a greatest hits. Which makes it pretty inessential for pre-ordained fans. But something tells me the 2000 release of Bang serves only to remind and recruit in the new decade. No arguments here. The Jesus Lizard were one of the loudest, tightest, toughest rock bands ever. They were the Stooges of the 90's. And we don't have to worry about David Yow making solo albums like Avenue B.","It's pretty weird that there are no bands like the Jesus Lizard around anymore.

Building Nothing Out of Something,Modest Mouse,by: Brent DiCrescenzo,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c3785e6ef9596932383b/1:1/w_160/a76df59b.gif,2000-01-18 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5361-building-nothing-out-of-something/,Up,"It's just a matter of time until a West Coast punk band with the name of ""The ______s"" releases an album called For Nick Cater. It's just a matter of time until an indie rock collective devoted to resurrecting the sound of Led Zeppelin arises in Olympia, Athens or D.C. It's just a matter of time before Superchunk releases an album with ""keyboards and loops and stuff."" It's only a matter of time before Dan Fogelberg is somehow dubbed a misunderstood genius in Chicago's avant-pop circles. Rock music has sunk to some pretty low levels recently. But lately, I've experienced a little metanoia; the thin jaded layers that built up in 1999 have flaked away. Chalk those layers up to loitering in the grime of mid-20's doldrums. I'm just in love with music. This is why I eat hotdogs and oatmeal and type until 4:00am instead of cutting up cadavers at Emory. And what sort of angel-driven crane has pulled me up from the quagmires, you ask? A handful of bands. One of which, of course, is Modest Mouse. I've listened to Modest Mouse grow progressively better and more profound since their 1996 debut, This is a Long Drive for Someone with Nothing to Think About. I read Pitchfork's official ""weirdest interview ever"" with Modest Mouse before I was even on the staff. I've witnessed Isaac Brock scream into his guitar pickups inside a packed bar in Atlanta while my then-girlfriend got sick and fainted. But it wasn't until Building Nothing Out of Something slipped into my possession that I became convinced that Modest Mouse, strangely, might be saviors. Not that The Lonesome Crowded West wasn't amazing. It was just a tad overlong, and the climate has worsened in those couple of short years since. Here's a band for us to wave at the UK and sneer, ""Haha, you don't have this!"" For Modest Mouse are inherently and inseparably American. Isaac Brock's brain is fed through the umbilical of strip malls, religion, blues, prairies, automobiles, and dysfunction. The trio is bare, raw, howling, and beautiful. There's always been a visceral thrill in rock's revolutionaries that comes from a twinge of danger. In Modest Mouse, this danger stems from a sense of rural dementia-- the sort of fear Flannery O'Connor and James Dickey would love to mill. The roar of punk splashes against the melancholy of roots music. There are trailers in Modest Mouse's past, and likely their future. Though Building Nothing Out of Something merely compiles old singles and rarities, it might be the best Modest Mouse release for newcomers' initiation, as well as instant gratification for long time fans. This batch of songs is easily their most varied. ""Never Ending Math Equation"" tick-tocks to a screeching turntable crescendo. ""Medication"" floats a slow, crystalline guitar line over muted field recordings of traffic, foghorns, and railroad bells before trotting into an acoustic coda with blithe organs. The most beautiful near-seven minutes of Modest Mouse's career rumbles throughout ""Workin' on Leavin' the Livin'""-- a psychedelic testimonial to the afterlife. ""Sleepwalkin'"" mines the 1950s ballad of the same name, but sets the affair in an underwater chamber of whale-call guitars and aching melodies. And a suitable meltdown climaxes in the closer, ""Other People's Lives,"" when Brock treats his guitar like solder. Yet what truly bowls me over is the savant-like lucidity in Brock's pinpoint prose. Most people in their young 20s can't nail the malaise, prayers, frustrations, and joys of life. The record opens with the brilliant lines, ""I'm the same/ As I was when I was six years old/ And oh my god I feel so damn old/ But do I really feel anything?"" Brock may look like a gas station employee but he rambles off quips like, ""The universe works on a math equation that never really ever even ever is in it and/ Infinity spirals out creation."" One doesn't normally expect metaphysics from a lumberjack rock band. And this line comes from the same song. Everything is delivered with utmost sincerity, is perfectly phrased, and drips with emotion. As Ryan observed, ""Anyone else would put those lyrics on top of mopey minor chords."" Anyone else would simply fail if they tried this. Terse, original observations are delivered throughout. ""Workin' on Leavin' the Livin'"" refrains the lament: ""In heaven everything is fine/ In heaven everything's alright."" This only works for the fact that Brock sounds ready to die over guitars that cry and shimmer. An undercurrent of honesty, and the juxtapositions and surprises are what make Modest Mouse. Forget the fact they have the name of a 1970s Oxford prog band. This band, one of the few truly original voices in modern rock music, grants me visions of a near-future where their major label debut strikes that new, long-awaited revolution. And in 2001, I want to hear people asking, ""Who's going to be the next Modest Mouse?""","It's just a matter of time until a West Coast punk band with the name of ""The ______s"" releases ...

Chappaquiddick Skyline,Chappaquiddick Skyline,by: Jeremy Schneyer,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a585ea9e61561daa5169/1:1/w_160/b65a2bdb.gif,2000-01-18 06:00:03,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1399-chappaquiddick-skyline/,Sub PopSub Pop,"There are a few things you should know about this disc right off the bat: 1. The only color represented on either the cover art or the CD itself is a particularly melancholy shade of blue. The disc itself has no writing or identifying marks on it at all, save for its blueness. 2. The seventh song on Chappaquiddick Skyline is entitled ""Theme to an Endless Bummer."" This could just as well have been the album title. 3. The first words out of Joe Pernice's mouth on the opening track, ""Everyone Else is Evolving"" are: ""I hate my life."" Yes, this is the latest installment of Joe Pernice's terminally-depressed orchestral pop musings, and as if you haven't already gathered, this album is a downer. Someone needs to give this guy a hug before he jumps off a building. You might have thought that the Pernice Brothers' Overcome by Happiness was in need of a good dose of Prozac, but that disc is positively sunny in disposition compared to this latest effort. And the fact is, Pernice definitely knows what he's doing-- these songs'll tug at your heartstrings as impatiently as any sad song ever penned. However, some problems arise here. Pernice's past efforts-- whether with the Pernice Brothers (the lineup of which is virtually the same as Chappaquiddick Skyline, minus Joe's brother Bob), or his first group, the underrated Scud Mountain Boys-- have always included at least a few up-tempo tracks to alleviate the gloom. Not so here. And it wouldn't even be so bad, except that the album is also sadly lacking in Pernice's beautiful ethereal vocal melodies, which graced Overwhelmed by Happiness so plentifully. With the exception of the cover of New Order's ""Leave Me Alone,"" every song on Chappaquiddick Skyline drags its feet. Too many of these songs float by on nothing more than a breathy Pernice vocal and a chiming guitar progression. This lends the album a breezy, nonchalant air, but it also leaves the listener precious little to sink teeth into. Tracks like ""The Two of You Sleep"" and ""Knights of the Night Volume 1"" sound like half-baked demos. It doesn't help that Pernice's vocal style is so deliberate that you can practically see him enunciating each word. Sadness and pain resonate in his voice, but it's almost as if that he's so bummed that he feels like he can't afford to let a little personality show through. On a more positive note, there are a few songs here that replicate the standard Pernice formula with quite a bit of success. ""Courage Up"" and ""Hundred Dollar Pocket"" are both examples of Pernice at his best-- lilting melodies, beautiful arrangements and thoughtful (if still pretty depressing) lyrics. However, that the most successful track here is a cover of a New Order song doesn't lend much to Joe's credibility. It's unclear whether Pernice has shelved the Pernice Brothers moniker in favor of Chappaquiddick Skyline, or if this is just a side project that utilizes many of the same players he usually works with. If the side project scenario is accurate, he can certainly be forgiven this slight misstep. After all, if this disc had been recorded by a no-name with no previous recordings to judge by, I would probably be much more forgiving in my judgment. However, on this release, Pernice doesn't quite live up to his legacy, and what I and many others know he's eminently capable of. Here's hoping he's feeling a touch more motivated next time around.","There are a few things you should know about this disc right off the bat:

Kingsbury Manx,Kingsbury Manx,by: Taylor M. Clark,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bbb0ea9e61561daa72cc/1:1/w_160/3cd36419.gif,2000-01-18 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4452-kingsbury-manx/,OvercoatOvercoat,"On the eve of a recent cross-country flight that I was not particularly looking forward to taking, I became suddenly convinced that my airplane luck had finally run out. Over the past 20 years, I've enjoyed what I view as an unprecedented streak of not dying brutally in a cataclysmic fireball sent at high rates of speed from the ominous skies above. Nor has my entire body been sucked through a little airplane window and dropped headfirst onto jagged rocks from a height of 35,000 feet. Hell, I haven't even been violently flung against the ceiling by abrupt turbulence. It's been all too easy for me in terms of airplane travel. So, as my girlfriend drove me to the airport, completely unaware of my impending demise, I decided to soothe my jangled nerves by putting on the Kingsbury Manx's eponymous debut. Amazingly, it helped. Sweeping folk tones mediated the struggle between my overactive brain and taxed nervous system. Serene vocals calmed, saying: ""Taylor, once you set foot on a plane, your actual chances of death are around 1 in 7 million. Relax. You are 4 times more likely to be killed by lightning than in a plane accident. Let us ease your preposterously troubled mind."" Of course, they were actually saying something much more artful and appropriate than that, but the overall effect was roughly the same. The Kingsbury Manx do not craft songs that will stun you with their ingenuity and proficiency. Rather, the album recalls a tranquil mountain lake scene: they're peaceful and beautiful, sometimes even unique, but they so resemble other similar scenes that they seem a bit common. Songs like ""Pageant Square"" and ""Piss Diary"" offer a pronounced soft folk vibe that is both gorgeous and soothing in its simplicity. Steadily-picked guitars and light drums comprise the delicate setting in which ethereal vocals blossom slowly. Occasional strings and ambient synthesized sounds pepper many of the tracks, lending the music an almost New Age feel. This isn't meant in the pejorative John Teshian sense, but instead in the sense that the Kingsbury Manx capture the broad, gentle tones inherent to that much maligned genre and meld them with mild folk instrumentation and mentality. The effect of this hybrid isn't quite stunning, but makes for a peaceful listen that's active and engaging enough to hold attention. The band also sporadically produces a track like ""Cross Your Eyes"" that inspires a bit of bodily movement, but The Kingsbury Manx is mostly comprised of placid gems like ""How Cruel"" that meander into the sunset at a leisurely pace. It's a record that doesn't set out to dizzy listeners with a focused sonic punch, but rather comforts and tranquilizes them with calm, golden tones. In this manner, the Kingsbury Manx have succeeded at creating a very nice, listenable record that won't bowl you over with glee but could entrench itself in your playlist over time. So, I credit the Kingsbury Manx with preventing harm to myself to the degree that they eased me into a state where I wouldn't try to claw my way out of the plane (or airborne death trap as I was calling it) in mid-flight. Unfortunately, the Kingsbury Manx couldn't hinder Northwest Airlines from sending my bags to Detroit and finally getting them to me at 5:00am the next morning, but I'm hoping that sort of thing will be covered on their next record.","On the eve of a recent cross-country flight that I was not particularly looking forward to taking, I became suddenly ...

March to Fuzz,Mudhoney,by: Ryan Schreiber,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Founder</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c404c0084474cd0c35d3/1:1/w_160/27714dd7.gif,2000-01-18 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5494-march-to-fuzz/,Sub Pop,"Compilations are becoming more and more fashionable in the indie rock world these days. Every label that's been in existence for more than three years seems to have issued at least one. There are hundreds of variations on the theme-- it can be composed of any or all of the following: 7""s, rarities, b-sides, greatest hits, live tracks, on-air performances, remixes, demos, covers, and even other compilation appearances (including soundtracks). For the most part, these tend to be relatively throw-away jumbles of odds-and-ends, and a strictly for-the-fan experience. A quick glance at the track listing here proves it's no different for Mudhoney's March to Fuzz, a two-disc compilation of greatest hits and rarities. It's no surprise that a package like this is seeing release through Sub Pop. They have to remind people of a time long ago when credibility ran rampant through their offices. Plus, what better way to make a crisp dollar than issuing ""the best"" songs of a band's career? After all, it's Sub Pop's early days that made them the official label of grunge music and, to this day, one of the wealthiest independents on record. After the extremely timely passing of grunge, Sub Pop managed to sustain their fanbase by releasing critically-acclaimed records by Five Style, Sebadoh, the Spinanes, Sunny Day Real Estate, and more debatably, Damien Jurado, Looper, and Eric Matthews. But now, as the label's second wave of esteemed bands die off, Sub Pop has to attempt self-resurrection a third time. It's easy to see how a reissue of Mudhoney's best songs correlates with the type of stuff Sub Pop is releasing these days. Some of their newest signings-- bands like Nebula, the Go, Gluecifer, and the Hellacopters-- are more similar to grunge than 90% of the Seattle label's recent output. If Sub Pop is trying to make a return to their roots, why not celebrate their existence with new comps of their baddest-ass bad-ass bands? We've already received the best-of treatment from both the Reverend Horton Heat and the Supersuckers. Mudhoney weren't drastically different from their contemporaries, and perhaps for this reason, these guys are the defining sound of grunge (next to Nirvana, of course). They could sound like Soundgarden, Nirvana, Mother Love Bone, Hole, Alice in Chains, Pearl Jam, Green River, Screaming Trees, and-- sorry, guys-- Temple of the Dog. With their several good records (Superfuzz Bigmuff, Mudhoney, Every Good Boy Deserves Fudge, and Piece of Cake) and more recent mediocre-to-bad ones (Five Dollar Bob's Mock Cooter Stew, My Brother the Cow, and 1998's Tomorrow Hit Today), Mudhoney were responsible for much of the way grunge sounded. They had an album out on Sub Pop even before Nirvana. Like most bands of their ilk, these guys drew their sound most directly from the Stooges and Black Sabbath. They've got Mark Arm's growling, snotty, angstful vocals, the aggressive drum fills at the end of every measure, the heavily distorted Hendrix-inspired roar of guitars, and the omnipresent thick, muddy bass. But they'll probably always be best known for their anthems, ""Touch Me I'm Sick"" and ""Suck You Dry"" more than they will for any of their complete albums. Naturally, the anthems are included on March to Fuzz, as are a staggering 50 other songs. Yep, this disc has it all-- a few cuts from their prime, and more embarrassing stuff off their later records. In short, you get Mudhoney's best moments with a bunch of filler. And that's just the first disc! The second features practically every song the band never released on their albums, and for the most part, it's pretty evident why. There's virtually nothing of worth on the second disc unless you're diehard Mudhoney completist, in which case you've probably already got this stuff. Of course, it's impossible to overlook the fact that March to Fuzz stumbles into the same pitfall that so many previous ""best of"" packages before it have been laid to rest in: if you want an introduction to an album-oriented band like Mudhoney, you're probably going to be better off listening to... one of their albums! Even with Sub Pop's added ""bonus disc"" incentive, March to Fuzz isn't a spectacular deal compared to the equally-priced Mudhoney classic Every Good Boy Deserves Fudge.","Compilations are becoming more and more fashionable in the indie rock world these days.

Peregrine,Tara Jane O’Neil,by: Yancey Strickler,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a099b1335d7bf1698064/1:1/w_160/4e8528a5.jpg,2000-01-18 06:00:00,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6003-peregrine/,QuarterstickQuarterstick,"It snowed here in Williamsburg, Virginia for the first time in years today. Flurries were the forecast, but they soon turned to showers, covering the brick walkways that pass between the 17th century buildings. On this first day of snow-- the first true day of Winter in this section of the Atlantic coast in ages-- I sit with the thermostat cranked 85 degrees high, listening to the new album from Tara Jane O'Neil. I'm sure some of you recognize this name, and even more recognize such band names as Rodan, Retsin, and the Sonora Pine, bands O'Neil has worked with in the past. With flakes easing past my window, I feel an affinity for O'Neil and her first true solo album, Peregrine. But not for reasons you may think. According to the liner notes, this entire album-- instrumentation and songwriting-- was recorded by Tara in her New York City apartment. A brief outline of the many tools she uses includes piano, balla laika, banjo, and thumb piano. This complex arrangement should be an immediate red alert to the ambitiousness of the album. While the songs are restrained to the point of being timid, a close listen to the album's empty space shows just how aggressive and engaging her songwriting can be. O'Neil's voice is strong, propelling lyrics about butterflies, the moon, and childbirth over the reverb and ring of electric and acoustic guitars. Sparingly used double-tracked vocals help emphasize themes of lost hope and despair. I realize this may sound obnoxious to some, but after two or three listens I began to look forward to lines that made me cringe the first time through. Although the volume of the album remains constant, O'Neil moves in many different directions stylistically. ""A City in the North"" is reminiscent of the Cowboy Junkies' Trinity Sessions, a relaxed piece of melancholy lament. Its companion piece, ""A City in the South,"" however, has the tone of a Carter Family waltz on a hungover Sunday morning. ""Asters"" alternates between the manic train rhythms of Captain Beefheart and a cowgirl ballad cooed around a campfire. But considering the circumstances around the album, the range of styles feels out of place. The problem is not the monstrous sonic differences between Rodan and O'Neil's post-Rodan work. That's an issue that most fans of the early 90's Midwest sound have had to deal with (think of King Kong or the For Carnation). The problems with Peregrine are the contradictions it creates based upon the arrangements that O'Neil chooses. First off, let's talk about the rural tone of an album recorded New York City. This music is for summer nights on the back porch shucking corn somewhere in the Midwest, not while begging for change in front of a ghetto McDonald's. Another strange aspect of Peregrine is how aggressive the lyrics are in their claustrophobic and intimate content. The subject matter of O'Neil's lyrics doesn't usually match the way she sings them, which makes her seem less connected, and occasionally, less interested. On the surface, Peregrine is a beautiful album. ""Sunday Song"" is an absolutely gorgeous cut whose acoustic guitars chime under a chorus in which O'Neil's voice is particularly strong. On the other hand, there's an adherence to standards of sorts. Whether it's country rock or the post-rock wanking of ""Flash Thumb Blues,"" the music serves to keep the meaning on a very basic level. The disorientation I felt seeing snow here in eastern Virginia is the same sensation I've had trying to examine this album. The conventions that I would expect from Tara Jane O'Neil have been pushed to the margins in favor of extreme simplicity. She's describing gritty, graveled, yellow snow, but covers it with a lily white blanket. And while the surface still looks beautiful, the elements underneath prove too cluttered to make a snow angel.","It snowed here in Williamsburg, Virginia for the first time in years today.

The Lioness,Songs: Ohia,by: Meg Zamula,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a4b45e6ef95969320923/1:1/w_160/8ae41946.gif,2000-01-17 06:01:40,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7334-the-lioness/,Secretly Canadian,"Until last year, it never occurred to me to name an annual top make-out song. Whether this was due to a lack of appropriate music or a lack of appropriate kissers in my life I don't care to speculate, the point being that in 1999 things finally came together for me. The song was Songs: Ohia's ""Captain Badass,"" and despite its decidedly unromantic title, the pairing of Jason Molina's solemn vocals with guest Edith Frost's sultry ones was strangely affecting. Molina managed the challenging task of penning heartfelt, desperation-tinged lyrics with a dignity rarely witnessed in modern indie rock. Now, don't get me wrong. I'm not an emo fan, and Songs: Ohia are not an emo band. Jason Molina may be more sincere than most, but he's more a musical peer of Will Oldham and Manishevitz than the Gloria Record. Songs: Ohia records are composed of melancholy acoustic ballads fusing folk and country, and while Molina doesn't shy away from writing about love, his aren't songs that could be subtitled, ""How I Felt When the Second Girlfriend in a Row Left Me for a Member of Hot Water Music."" Aided this time around by members of Arab Strap and Appendix Out, Molina has crafted a more subtle and consistent record. ""Tigress,"" ""Coxcomb Red"" and the album's title track each come close to achieving the status I've granted to ""Captain Badass."" And it may be that the only thing preventing me from fully embracing these songs is the stereotype of the predatory woman that runs theme-like throughout them. At any rate, Molina's songwriting here is much stronger than on last year's Axxess and Ace, but he's abandoned some of the guests who helped make the album so affecting when he opted to record in Scotland, rather than the U.S. Edith Frost's absence is felt most notably, since her vocals added a compelling counterpoint to Molina's somber delivery. Appendix Out are, on the whole, probably better suited to the Songs: Ohia style, but some of the freshness and novelty of the live Axxess sessions, recorded with collaborators Michael Krassner and David Pavkovic of Boxhead Ensemble are lost, making The Lioness a decidedly more resigned and less passionate affair. So despite hot lyrics like, ""And I wanted that heat so bad/ I could taste the fire on your breath,"" Songs: Ohia will not claim the dubious honor of my make-out artist of the year twice in a row. It's nothing personal; 2000 just hasn't found me requiring that tinge of desperation.","Until last year, it never occurred to me to name an annual top make-out song. Whether this was due to ...

It was the first time I'd ever seen such niceties. I remember that the 8-track deck came with a tape bearing the elegant title Oldsmobile, which compiled songs that were popular on AM radio at the time. There was ""The Theme from 'MAS*H,'"" a Gordon Lightfoot tune, B.J. Thomas' rendition of ""Raindrops Keep Falling on My Head,"" something by Earth, Wind and Fire, and, I believe, a track by Dionne Warwick. My memories of styling in that gas-guzzling Cutlass, listening to that Oldsmobile comp, are some of my earliest and best. I'd kill for a copy of that 8-track now, just to hear those tunes laid out in order. Of course, it'd be impossible to track down something so obscure. But now, thanks to Arling and Cameron, I don't have to. This is that Oldsmobile tape, remade by a couple of Dutch clowns in their own image. It veers from late 60's cabaret to disco to easy listening to lounge-- a retro blend which admittedly is not very original at this stage in the game. But through a combination of Arling and Cameron's sharp studio skills, their sure feel for genre, and most importantly, an unfailing sense of humor, these two manage, somehow, to make the zillionth such retro LP sound fun and cool. Though Arling and Cameron are a duo, they bring an army of collaborators into the studio, from crack session musicians to singers of every stylistic and linguistic stripe. ""Le Flit Et La Fillie"" opens the album with a Continental go-go theme, ""W.E.E.K.E.N.D."" is a hilarious (and impressively accurate) homage to easy listening, with a man and a woman harmonizing on the virtues of each day of the week (and spelling out the chorus in a goofy Dutch accent). ""Hashi"" is a spy theme tribute to a drug-sniffing canine, another witty cut that includes echoing dog barks in a parody of dub style. ""Let's Get Together"" is a spot-on blend of house and disco that could've been recorded in 1980 if the engineers of yesteryear had a studio setup this sophisticated. And so it goes for the 14 remarkably consistent but, naturally, far from groundbreaking songs on this strong collection; Music for Imaginary Films is retro music with tasteful modern flourishes and a good sense of fun.

Three Cherries,Sin Ropas,by: Mark Richardson,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a416c0084474cd0c0406/1:1/w_160/c5a87e87.gif,2000-01-11 06:00:00,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7177-three-cherries/,PerishablePerishable,"There's a long history of record labels being identified with a certain sound. In jazz, Blue Note was known for the funky hard-bop of Art Blakey and Horace Silver, while Impulse! cultivated a roster of avant-garde explorers like John and Alice Coltrane and Archie Shepp. In the indie rock universe, those who buy something on K or Kill Rock Stars can usually depend on hearing some amateurish post-punk, while Kranky remains the home of ambient dreamers. But Perishable, the label begun initially to release Red Red Meat's debut album, is developing two identities: a clearing house for the rhythm experiments of the Chicago instrumental scene (Him, Drumhead, Out in Worship) and the keepers of the pawnshop folk-blues flame, as previously burned by oRSo, Loftus, and now Sin Ropas. That Sin Ropas sounds like a Red Red Meat side project-- complete with outdated drone machines, banjos, acoustic guitars and abrasive percussion-- is no surprise: it's essentially the work of RRM's Tim Hurley. Hurley has always been the second songwriter in Red Red Meat. He contributed ""Airstream Driver"" to There's a Star Above the Manger Tonight, and sang a couple of songs on the Loftus record. And he's always been more about mood than melody. Indeed, while few of these compositions would hold up well if separated from the complicated production that characterizes the work of this collective, they still hit with all the impact of a shovel to the face, due to a Hurley's talent for instrumental nuance and shading. Hurley's grizzled voice (which bears a passing resemblance to an exhausted Neil Young) lacks depth of expression, but holds a certain downcast sincerity that suits these songs well. And in the end, this album seems to be about the finished recording, anyway-- you won't be humming the tune to ""Snakes in Shoes,"" but you'll remember the bouncy slap of the snare drum. A few of these tracks are instrumental, including the almost Calexico-like ""I Found Your Teeth."" It combines wonderfully controlled guitar feedback, melodica and upright bass to conjure a vivid scene of some booze-ravaged hero prowling the warehouses down by the wharf, in search of a beautiful woman best forgotten.

Disc One was nu-skool, fresh hits and Disc Two brought back some fat-ass gems from the vault, again proving that old techno isn't necessarily bad techno. INCredible Sound of Drum-n-Bass works on a similar premise-- Spectrum (Disc One), splits drum-n-bass into a wide range of colors ranging on the new side, most tracks coming from '97 to '99. Goldie's Metalheadz label is represented heavily-- tracks by Alex Reece, Doc Scott and Codename John give way to acid-jazzy compositions like Digital's ""Space Funk."" It's comprised of tight, well-chosen tracks that stretch boundaries instead of pants. INCredible's second disc, Retro, recalls the Disc Two of UB2. It's largely composed of older tracks that sound, frankly, like a walk down memory lane. I remember back in the day when ""Terminator"" was on all the floors. Used to be, you could got a pill for just $10 bucks back then, but half'd kill ya. In any case, even if you haven't necessarily heard all of these tracks in this mutation, you've likely heard pieces of them sampled on other songs. Goldie contributes not only 1993's ""Terminator"" but 1994's ""Manslaughter."" He also brings Neil Trix, Optical, J Majik, Source Direct and Matrix, mixing house-fun sensibility with live drum-n-bass intensity to pleasing effect. But as with UB2, the older sounds almost surpass the newer material-- the hindsight of a couple of years provide clarity for Goldie's vision. In short, INCredible Sound of Drum-n-Bass is for the following people: Old people trying to fit into their baggy pants Pacifier-suckers whose teeth have fallen out Youngsters that are curious about ""the old days"" but want a disc of new stuff, too The bi-curious: those willing to try drum-n-bass, but frightened of the ""harsh stuff"" Worshipers of the Metalheadz crew, Goldie, and the jungle/techstep way It is not for the following people: Your mom The lady downstairs whose breath stinks of cigarettes and coffee People in search of relaxation Swing dancers Baba booey That's it. Move along. Nothing to see here.","Something was stirring the cobwebs in my brain, that's for sure. The Hippie thought I'd strained something, but ...

Airline People EP,For Stars,by: Ryan Kearney,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bdf9ea9e61561daa780d/1:1/w_160/c0889680.gif,2000-01-01 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3152-airline-people-ep/,AcuarelaAcuarela,"There are only two kinds of music fans: those who focus on lyrics, and those who focus on sound. The former are willing to accept sub-par instrumentation for the sake of strong lyricism, while the latter are willing to ignore poor lyrics, so long as they're accompanied by strong instrumentation. From The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan to Kid A, this has been a major source of division in the music world. This, of course, is one of music criticism's worst myths, perpetuated no doubt by fans of Maya Angelou. But let's pretend, for the sake of this review, that the myth is true. Then For Stars are for all you ""sound"" people. During the opener, ""At the End of the World,"" you'll notice an innocent acoustic guitar, tentative percussion that includes a maraca, and a subtle glockenspiel. It's all very nice-- too consciously nice, in fact. But then frontman Carlos Forster and a set of more feminine pipes join together for the opening lines: ""At the end of the world/ I am yours, you are mine/ When the walls come caving in/ I am yours, you are mine."" ""Lyrics"" people worldwide are using Dylan for cotton balls, while ""sound"" people are rocking back and forth in feigned ignorance. The rest of this five-song EP-- a collection of outtakes from the band's first two U.S. albums-- is more of the same: a quaint indie-folk band stuck in Frisco circa Scott McKenzie's suggestion to hippie pilgrims that they ""be sure to wear some flowers in [their] hair."" If I were a ""sound"" person, I'd invoke rainy days or summer's twilight. I might even use words like ""bittersweet"" and ""heartfelt."" But I must be a ""lyrics"" person, because I can't help but point out the revelatory chorus of the next track, ""Brown Skin Saint"": ""We have dreams, they make us laugh/ We have guns, they make us cry/ We have cars, we'll get there fast/ We have airplanes, for the sky."" And sung in a whiny falsetto, even! The one true bright spot on Airline People is ""The Racecar Driving Scene,"" where the Belle and Sebastian influence is, as opposed to the other tracks, more palpable in the lyrics than the music. ""I got involved with the racecar driving scene/ We'd act like heroes, and smell like gasoline,"" sings Forster, the more subdued vocal route serving him well. Over the course of 4\xBD minutes, the song builds into a crescendo of distorted guitars and roused drums that signals an awakening-- literally-- of band and listener alike. But even this song raises the question: why does it takes five guys to make music this sparse and simple? No one may ever know why, but here's a question you should be able to answer: are you a ""lyrics"" person or a ""sound"" person? Don't know? Here's how you can tell: if you've found the horrible pun in their name, then you're the former; if you haven't, then maybe For Stars are four you.","There are only two kinds of music fans: those who focus on lyrics, and those\n\ who focus on sound ...

Rather questionable marketing decisions lurk behind that. Should we slip 'n' slide or witness a desperate DePaul drama grad carry the zero? ""The Homework Show"" is like showing Die Hard 2 on a flight to Dulles. It's like a rib joint in the West Bank. It's like Arab on Radar in your ears. While they've successfully nudged the guitar a few steps closer to dentistry tools, Arab on Radar pound on the same bathroom-stall joke for 19 minutes on Soak the Saddle. The opening track chugs away like a Brainiac knock-off in a combine, only it's recorded with microphones made of a tin cans and yarn. The result is neither menacing or powerful. Crusty drums jackhammer. Guitars whistle like tea is ready. It's shrill and calculated. Though it may be considered punk in some circles to aggravate the listener, it's pretty unpunk to charge people money for it. This relentless grind and screech could suffice as passable garage scrape-core if coupled with an intelligent, provoking singer. Sadly, the enigmatic Arab on Radar seemingly employs a congested Jon Lovitz reading the men's room graffiti in Bard's student union. ""Nice girls don't soak the saddle/ Judy Garland doesn't use tampons,"" the knob whines. ""Hard-ons for home runs/ Hard-ons are unamerican."" Each slogan is spat with such uninspired contempt that the tone is difficult to discern. Is ""the quality of bedwetting is conflict"" humor? Is ""his nuts inflate like a blowfish"" a mockery of modern Maxim masculinity? Probably not when backed with a line like, ""Have you ever seen a teenager with a package quite like that?"" Potty humor it is, then. Let's not discuss the homosexual shower rape song. To make it ""art,"" Arab on Radar title their songs ""1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9."" And in further attempts to be difficult, the tracks are sequenced in a different order! Brilliant! Bands like the Jesus Lizard and U.S. Maple have already done this with sincerity. Orifice obsession and trashy noise may get you big in Rhode Island, but those unrelated to the band will be unimpressed at best. Perhaps parents can get their tots in front of the set for ""The Homework Show"" by threatening them with Soak the Saddle on repeat.","Chicago Public Television runs a children's program on Summer afternoons called ""The Homework Show.""

Since I Left You,The Avalanches,by: Matt LeMay,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a15d9d034d5c69bf2944/1:1/w_160/cfca747e.jpg,1999-12-31 06:01:40,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/385-since-i-left-you/,SireModular,"Contrary to the beliefs of many middle-American supermarket-goers, not all samples are free. Just ask Vanilla Ice. When he ""sampled"" the bassline from Queen and David Bowie's ""Under Pressure,"" he was faced with a multi-million dollar lawsuit, rather than a complementary napkin and toothpick. Sure, nobody bats an eye when copyright law takes some money out of the shiny, rhinestone-encrusted pockets of Rob Van Winkle or Puff Daddy, but as soon as lawsuits trip up avant-hoodlums like John Oswald of Plunderphonics fame, the concept of thievery-as-art becomes a hot topic, and the line between sampling and stealing becomes fiercely contended. Given the fact that Since I Left You, the debut album from Aussie party animals the Avalanches, contains over 900 individual samples, it's pretty incredible that this thing got released in the first place. The fact that they sample everything from long-forgotten R&B; records to golf instructionals to Madonna's ""Holiday"" makes it even more impressive. But what really makes this album brilliant is not as much the volume or quality of the samples used as the way that they're employed. The Avalanches have managed to build a totally unique context for all these sounds, while still allowing each to retain its own distinct flavor. As a result, Since I Left You sounds like nothing else. Much of the beauty of the opening title song and its accompanying track, ""Stay Another Season,"" lies in the way that the Avalanches turn obvious sonic mismatches into something all their own. It's not too common that you'll hear a sample of a horse, a rastafarian singer, and an invitation to a Club Med disco all in the same song, but somehow it makes perfect sense under the masterful direction of the Avalanches. Indeed, many of the most interesting moments on Since I Left You come with these mismatches. ""A Different Feeling"" sets horn blasts from 1974 against video game sounds from 1988-- the kind of bizarre pairing of classic soul with futuristic sounds that constitutes a substantial part of Avalanches magic. ""Radio,"" which is slated for release as the band's next Australian single, centers around a mantra-like vocal sample, a thick disco bassline, and bits and pieces of filtered guitars and synthesizers. Throughout Since I Left You, sampled vocals are used almost like percussion. But rather than utilizing the frenetic, intricate rhythms seen in most contemporary rap, the Avalanches repeat small vocal samples over and over again, melding them into their rump-rocking grooves. And while many of these songs rely heavily on the repetition of beats and samples, no single part of the record is allowed to stagnate. Something is always being mixed up-- a sample transposed up or down a few steps, a beat chopped up into little pieces and seamlessly restructured, an unexpected vocal sample popping up out of nowhere before being swallowed up by the massive sound the Avalanches have concocted. Another key element of Since I Left You is the keen sense of humor the Avalanches display throughout. And ""Frontier Psychiatrist,"" one of two singles already released from the album, is simply one of the funniest songs I've heard in ages. Relying on a heavy, Ninja Tune-style beat for backing, ""Frontier Psychiatrist"" busts out samples from 37 spoken word recordings, resulting in an oddball, hilarious pastiche of phrases like, ""You're a nut! You're crazy in the coconut!"" And some brilliant scratching on a sample of a parrot. Though it contains many distinct songs and moods, Since I Left You is a remarkably coherent record on all fronts. Aside from the fact that the Avalanches achieve a certain uniform ""sound"" on this album, subtler elements come into play as well. Songs blend seamlessly into one another. Samples reappear from song to song. And the album's final cut, ""Extra Kings,"" with its breezy flute and psychedelic swells of sound, puts a brilliant twist on the album's title track, fading out with that same chipmunky voice lamenting, ""I've tried but I just can't get you/ Ever since the day I left you."" In releasing Since I Left You, the Avalanches have essentially brought hundreds of slabs of inanimate vinyl to life. Though it was no doubt meticulously constructed, this is an album brimming with spontaneity, joy, sadness, humor, reflection, and general human-ness. With its high fun factor and subtle traces of deeper emotion, Since I Left You is the perfect record for the party, and for the period of regret and recovery after the party.","

The Cat and the Cobra,Les Savy Fav,by: Brent DiCrescenzo,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bce6ea9e61561daa75b4/1:1/w_160/c53823a7.gif,1999-12-14 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4749-the-cat-and-the-cobra/,Frenchkiss,"At some point in 1998 I was standing alone in a triangular bar watching Les Savy Fav pound away. Their show was unannounced. I luckily stumbled across the club's listing that morning at work in ""Creative Loafing."" I'd been yearning to witness Les Savy Fav's live show, which had been garnering disciples along the upper industrial coast. And there I was, alone. Les Savy Fav were essentially playing just for me. Typically this scenario would be embarrassing-- a band outnumbering the crowd-- but Les Savy Fav rocked like I was Budokon. Tim Harrington stepped off the stage to sing in my face. His eyes bulged with fervent adrenaline in a near thyroid- deficient manner. One guitarist stepped off the stage and flanked me. This band, with the audacity and zeal to rock an audience of one (not including the bar staff who were wiping up in back), instantly won my heart. They worked up a sweat for me. They stormed the vault in my brain where I keep my favorite bands, awoke some slumbering old-timers with slaps, and kicked some undeserving squatters out the ear. Most reviews of Les Savy Fav inevitably mention the band's live show. On one hand, it demonstrates the band's stage dominance, but it also points to the fact that their two LPs to date have been unable to capture that intensity. This is not to say the albums haven't been vital slabs of modern American punk. More so it reveals the effects of the modern digital age on the underground. Pro-Tools and CDs have spoiled the rural and suburban audience. Production quality has grown crisp, polished and cheap. Kids can hear more music, faster. Distribution with the internet and the matured market puts CDs in Wyoming and Andorra. Les Savy Fav's approach rouses the early days of punk-- the late 70's and 80's. Fans still claim the Clash couldn't make a great record, which seems preposterous these days. But those fans saw the Clash live. Certainly Minor Threat's live shows punched the gut harder than their 7""s. Seeing a band live was essential. Back then, attendance and word of mouth mattered more. Don't take this as a discount of the modern scene. What I'm trying to get at is that Les Savy Fav make great records, which are not necessarily meant to out-do their live show, but to document and supplement the band's physical presence instead. So just listen. The Cat and the Cobra progresses further than Les Savy Fav's debut, 3/5, with a richer mix, added instrumental elements, and a slightly more confrontational sound. The once- subtle Brainiac elements have blossomed into obvious touchstones. The Frankenstein bass and sparking guitar of ""We've Got Boxes"" brings to mind Hissing Prigs in Static Couture. Warbling vocal effects and unnatural bass undulations under ""Wake Up!"" also recall Dayton's late innovators. ""The Orchard"" opens with resigned, sighing vocals and chiming melodic picks that eventually add hammers and dynamite to Smart Went Crazy's style of art-pop. Elsewhere, the attitude and duel guitar punji stabs continue the spirit of the Pixies. But clearly the focus of Les Savy Fav is the brilliantly demented Tim Harrington. He spits the most contrived sentiments with such conviction that it immediately becomes new gospel. On ""Who Rocks the Party,"" cries of ""Who rocks the party like we rock the body body!"" lead into declarations of, ""They can let loose the dogs on us/ Because the dogs like us more than the dogs like them!"" It may read stupid, but how often have you shouted ""I am un chein andolusian!"" along with Black Francis on ""Debaser?"" Meanwhile, drums throb underneath. No fills. No high hats. Guitars screech. It's primal and reviving. Let's face it, there aren't many bands keeping punk fresh. This is about a mission. This isn't about songs or being catchy. But somehow it is. Les Savy Fav belong on Dischord at the turn of the last decade, but fate and luck gave them to us now, when music most needs them.","At some point in 1998 I was standing alone in a triangular bar watching Les Savy Fav pound away.

The Past Was Faster,Kelley Stoltz,by: Matt LeMay,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a57b9d034d5c69bf32e3/1:1/w_160/b2cbdaaa.gif,1999-12-14 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7521-the-past-was-faster/,Telegraph Company,"There's an upside and a downside to the perpetual cheapening of recording equipment. The upside: musicians can begin producing music as soon as they've gathered together a few hundred bucks, and release that music without financial backing from a record company. Thus, musicians are free to pursue whatever musical inclinations they wish, no matter how freaky and/or experimental. The downside: Kelley Stoltz. The Past Was Faster is a collection of mediocre, generally bad lo-fi, about as refined and likeable as a syphilitic chancre. From the first fuzzy seconds of The Past Was Faster, you can pretty much expect what's to follow: unmelodious, uninteresting four-track music. Kelley Stoltz wants to be Bob Pollard so bad, you can just picture him standing in front of a mirror, swinging a microphone over his head, pursing his lips, and singing ""My Valuable Hunting Knife."" What Stoltz lacks is the ability to infuse a few chords with the kind of energetic delivery and strong vocal melodies that have made Pollard the veritable indie rock god he's become. While most of The Past Was Faster is merely lackluster, some of it is absolutely awful. After listening to the faux-country disaster, ""The Fog Has Lifted,"" I'd have to say that Stoltz could be the worst Tom Waits impersonator of all time. Seriously-- rev up a vacuum cleaner for a while, and run an old rag through it, and you get a better Waits impression than Stoltz can pull off. Perhaps the most depressing aspect of the album is that every time Stoltz stumbles upon a halfway decent riff, he spends at least three minutes repeating it ad nauseam. After about two minutes of nondescript blandness on ""Permafrost,"" the song breaks into a perfectly serviceable, pretty acoustic guitar riff. But the riff long outstays its welcome-- those same three or four notes repeat over and over again, as if Stoltz is saying to us, ""Listen! I finally figured out how to write a song!"" To make matters worse, The Past Was Faster's relative best track, a mellow number reminiscent of (but not nearly as good as) new Yo La Tengo, is actually a hidden track, buried deep into the album's last song, ""Lonely Star State."" And while the track is pretty decent, it certainly isn't worth the effort required to find it. Yes, this album is not without its pleasant moments. But even when it's pleasant, it's still immensely derivative-- and not nearly as good as the material it rips off. The Past Was Faster plays like one man's botched attempt to try his hand at being a ""musician."" And when all is said and done, the record is to be taken for exactly what it is-- Kelley Stoltz playing with himself. We can only hope, for his sake, that he's better at that than he is at songwriting.","There's an upside and a downside to the perpetual cheapening of recording equipment.

You know, the one that goes on and on about how impotence is symbolic of the last ""fuck you"" left in rock n' roll (the final frontier being ""I'm gay"")? Well, in case you didn't get around to hearing this guy's debut, the utterly manic Rise Up, this is how you know Bobby Conn: a man with a lovingly warped obsession with himself and his limp, shriveled place in it. Conn is less a musician than the leader of an elaborate musical sideshow. He gets outrageously talented members of the brain rock set (Jim O'Rourke, Julie Pomerleau) to partake in his frantic funk orchestra. He screams and whines and moans across the studio, sometimes spewing about revolution, sometimes moaning about wanting to see everyone's choda. Some see divinity in this amalgamation of toasted insanity with three kinds of melted cheese. Others listen to this balladry mixed with 70's jazz- fusion workouts and tsk like their slutty stepmothers. But having received two Bobby Conn records from the Pitchfork Ass Separator Dispersion Service, I must confess that I've had enough. Llovessonngs is a four- song EP which continues in the anything- goes vein of his last record. But whereas Rise Up was saved by some sort of coherent vision (if you can call fin- de- siecle hormonal nihilism a vision), Llovessonngs is too brief to make the impression it wants. Ranging from ""Hair"" outtakes like the Bobby Conn original ""Free Love"" to the whiny, orchestral death balladry of ""Without You"" (a cover), Conn is simply too sweaty to sleep beside. The last track ""Maria B"" is a standout, however, propelled by a pulsating percussion break and Conn's silky falsetto. Regardless of this opinion, one is forced to consider Bobby Conn on one's own. Conn's crap is urgent and odd enough to at least demand your attention, if not your adoration. For us, Llovessonngs only had the former.","Did anyone catch Bobby Conn's article in Vice Magazine about how he represents the last frontier of rock star ...

Homespun,XTC,by: Mark Richardson,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929aad5ea9e61561daa5c55/1:1/w_160/27764a56.gif,1999-12-07 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8832-homespun/,TVT,"This is a recording of great songs and it deserves a good rating, but the concept of Homespun is a strange one. These are the demos of the entire Apple Venus Vol. 1 record, sequenced in the same order. This means that those who buy this record after knowing and loving Apple Venus will have to sit through essentially the same album again, while those who don't own Apple Venus would probably be better off with the real deal. So what's the thinking here, exactly? I can see the Beatles releasing those Anthology tapes after all those years, given their status, but why would XTC follow up a record with another record containing demos of the same tunes? The decision to release these tapes seems even stranger when you consider that most of these demos don't differ much from their studio-recorded counterparts. When you hear the word ""demo"" associated with Homespun, don't go in expecting it to sound like it was recorded in Robert Pollard's garage or anything. Frontman Andy Partridge and cohort Colin Moulding have what sound like extremely sophisticated setups in their home studios, and the fidelity on this record would put many professional recordings to shame. And they don't sound like they were shotgunning Budweisers between takes, either. So, the differences are in the details, as on the orchestral backing of tunes like ""River of Orchids"" and ""Easter Theater,"" where Partridge triggers the string parts (with identical arrangements to the final versions) with a sampler. It's a convincing replication of a chamber orchestra, especially for demo purposes, but it obviously doesn't sound as rich and full as the final Apple Venus take. More valuable are the skeletal versions of songs like ""I'd Like That"" and ""Harvest Festival"" (both of which contain a brief selection from an earlier, rougher, dirtier take) that sound almost like proper demos. These particular tracks chip away at the glossy veneer of the final album recordings, revealing a melodic sense solid to the core. For XTC fanatics, who this collection is surely geared toward, Homespun comes with detailed liner notes that give an entertaining overview of the genesis of every piece. But mostly, this record stands as a further testament to a great songwriter. Partridge has spoken in interviews of hoping to achieve the melodic prowess of heroes like Burt Bacharach and Brian Wilson. Judging from his life's work, I'd say he's made it.","This is a recording of great songs and it deserves a good rating, but the concept of Homespun is a ...

Barbara the musician turns out some smart coffeehouse pop albums like Lately I Keep Scissors and, with her erstwhile backing band the San Francisco Seals, Truth Walks in Sleepy Shadows. Barbara the music fan goes off to record with her idols, such as with Stuart Moxham on Barbara Manning Sings with the Original Artists, but to call it a ""Barbara Manning solo album"" is a bit misleading. The latter is mostly Barbara singing Young Marble Giants songs, so anyone expecting a songwriting collaboration between Manning and Moxham would inevitably be disappointed. Her voice is pretty enough, but her personality tended to get lost in the mix. In New Zealand is another such ""solo album,"" albeit more of a collaborative effort, and a slightly more successful one at that. When Manning toured New Zealand in 1997 with Texas noir- rockers Calexico as her backing band, she took the opportunity to lay down tracks with some of her favorite local musicians. The resulting seven tracks comprise a pleasant trifle of an album that merely hints at the potential of a collaboration between Manning, Calexico, and folks like the Clean's David Kilgour, the Bats' Robert Scott, and the Verlaines' Graeme Downes. The wistful, airy ""Everything Happens By Itself"" is the best example of a group songwriting effort, while ""Lover's Leap,"" a gently spooky tune written by Calexico's Joey Burns, offers hope for a future Manning album should she and Calexico continue to record together. On the downside, though, Chris Knox's particular brand of creepy weirdness on ""Your Pies"" disturbs the otherwise mellow vibe of the rest of the album, and the closing track ""Aramoana"" is a crystalline Seam- like instrumental which would be great if it didn't drag on for so long. In New Zealand ends up being a nice keepsake for fans of Manning and/or New Zealand pop, but it's not really a must- buy.","There's Barbara Manning the musician, and then there's Barbara Manning the music fan.

Amplified,Q-Tip,by: Taylor M. Clark,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a1caea9e61561daa48ab/1:1/w_160/035d8847.jpg,1999-11-30 06:00:02,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6622-amplified/,Arista,"Professor, what's another word for pirate treasure? Well, Q-Tip thinks it's booty. Booty? Booty. That's what it is. In fact, booty is just about all Q-Tip seems to think about these days. On his first effort since the separation of A Tribe Called Quest, Q-Tip makes the transition from the familiar pensive Abstract Poet, prominent like Shakespeare, to a different breed of MC who seems interested only in ruminations of the booty-esque. For purposes of simplification, we may postulate his Three Commandments of Booty, if you will: Any booty located in or near a venue at which a Q-Tip joint is being broadcast shalt not refrain from both shaking in a frenzied manner and being scantily clad. Any jeep-like motorized conveyance belonging to or operated by Q-Tip shalt not be lacking a satisfactory supply of booty, which may be employed in an erotic capacity. Any personage whose lyrical flow is pertaining to booty and its ilk shalt not attempt to handle a microphone, nor shall said individual be let near such a device. Unfortunately, the above sums up the content of Amplified's lyrics almost entirely. Gone from the wax is Abstract the storyteller and social critic. He's been replaced by a scarcely recognizable, sex-obsessed MC who declares: ""While we're in the heat of the moment, fuck morality."" This is a disconcerting metamorphosis, indeed. For years, Q-Tip was the paragon of taste, intellect, and awareness in hip-hop, dropping true wisdom through incredibly clever verse. But instead of maturing with age, Q-Tip has regressed substantially. His lyrics now float awkwardly between sexual fascination and indictment of ""weakling rappers,"" and often in the same track. Of course, Q-Tip's delivery is still smooth like caramel, but his rhymes are markedly less crafty and more repetitive than any of his past works. Of course, this is all relative. Even Q-Tip's not-so-relevant work on Amplified confirms his place in the highest echelon of lyricists-- despite the nature of his rhymes, his timing is unequaled. Amplified exhibits new methods of delivery for Abstract which demonstrate just how diverse his styles can be. Musically, most of Amplified sounds absolutely nothing like Tribe's material, but on tracks like ""Let's Ride"" and ""Things You Do,"" a palpable Quest vibe emerges. The Ummah production crew lays down tracks which are less melodic and organic than typical Tribe fare, but are rhythmically frantic and induce abundant head nodding. It's a whole new realm for Q-Tip, replete with peculiar synthesized noises and rapidly administered samples, which he adapts to with such expertise that one can nearly forget the track featuring a guest appearance by Korn. Yes, I said Korn. I'd like to shake hands with the genius who thought to couple Q-Tip with the water faucet drip of talent that is Korn. I mean, it's not like he spotted Korn puffing L's in kilts on the Ave in Queens and the notion just knocked him to the ground with its brilliance. Did he ask Richard Simmons for music advice? Could he be related to the mastermind behind such feats of intellect as Crystal Pepsi and ""The Magic Johnson Show?"" At any rate, it goes without saying that he's not exactly hitting them out of the park. Let us examine a brief encapsulation of Jonathan Davis' lyrical wizardry from ""End of Time,"" a track on which Tip appears for probably 45 seconds: ""It's kind of scary, you see/ How fucked up things can be/ Each time you take a breath/ Hell, it could be your last."" Wow. If you need to stop reading for a minute in order to ponder this goldmine of metaphysical significance, please do so. Fortunately, this is followed by the excellent ""Do It, See It, Be It,"" the only truly introspective track Amplified has to show for itself. Ultimately, when faced with an artist who has produced such an extraordinary body of work within the context of a whole group, we can't pretend that his solo work should stand somehow beyond comparison with that of the group. Tribe had a positive group mentality that manifested itself through the message behind the music, and this element is painfully absent in Amplified. Without a crew whose virtues he may also extol, Q-Tip's self-praise comes off as exceedingly arrogant. And while the music is fresh and Tip's new look is slick, we know that Abstract has much more to bring to the table lyrically. Or does he? It seems that most people reach a certain age and, without warning, shed their talent. Only Q-Tip's next solo effort can be the true indicator of whether or not he's lost it.","Professor, what's another word for pirate treasure?

Good News for Modern Man,Grant Hart,by: D. Erik Kempke,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c065c0084474cd0c31a6/1:1/w_160/1445aa0f.gif,1999-11-30 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3749-good-news-for-modern-man/,PachydermPachyderm,"Grant Hart claims he left Hüsker Dü because no one took him seriously as a singer/songwriter, and that guitarist Bob Mould was typically seen as the creative center of the band. That's unfair, of course, since Hart was responsible for close to half of their oeuvre. But it's equally unfair that, in the 13 years since the Hüskers split, Mould's solo career has overshadowed Hart's, both in prolificacy and measure of success. Good News for Modern Man is Hart's first solo release since 1990's Intolerance, and more than six years have passed since the last release by his ill-fated Nova Mob project. It's a shame, really, because this album proves he's equally capable of delivering the goods as his former bandmate, even if it takes him longer to do it. Even at their most hardcore, Hüsker Dü were pop lovers at heart. Hart indulges that tendency here and makes literally no concession to his punk roots-- a good thing, since he possesses a fantastic knowledge of the form and turns out a terrifically diverse set of songs. While he's at it, Hart takes it upon himself to play all the instruments, too, and displays a facility for tight, inventive, multi-layered arrangements. The huge guitar chords of ""Think It Over Now"" ride equally huge Spector-sized drums, while ""Nobody Rides for Free"" recalls Bob Dylan's character-sketching heyday. The awkwardly titled ""Run Run Run to the Centre Pompidou"" combines Dick Dale-styled guitar work with Brian Wilson vocal harmonies without a trace of retro-kitsch. ""You Don't Have to Tell Me Now"" is one of the most gorgeous songs Hart has ever written, closely resembling his ex-band's quieter moments. And sudden left turns, like the cheesy keyboard and ominous layers of reverb that crop up in ""Teeny's Hair"" only serve to prove Grant's mastery of his craft. Good News' five songs are all so well crafted, in fact, it's surprising when the album starts to wear thin around the halfway point. ""A Letter From Anne Marie"" begins pleasingly enough, with some effective (if synthesized) horn and string arrangements. But all too soon, it becomes insufferably repetitive, as the title refrain is repeated endlessly over the same four chords. Eventually, Hart's warbly falsetto begins to grate, and the song completely fails to justify its six-minute length. The following track, ""In a Cold House,"" despite its tasty baritone guitar riff, quickly stumbles into the same pitfalls. Yet even in these weaker moments, the production and arrangements remain top notch. The album doesn't stay down for long, luckily, though the proceeding tracks can't quite erase the effects of that brief loss of momentum. ""Seka Knows"" trots along in \xBE time, pleasantly reminiscent of New Day Rising's ""She Floated Away."" The fragment ""Let Rosemary Rock Him, Laura-Louise,"" though grippingly titled, hardly seems a necessary inclusion, but it precedes one of the album's best tracks, the closer, ""Little Nemo."" ""Nemo"" builds from cut-up piano parts and subtle guitar and percussion into a steady rocker before disintegrating a la ""A Day in the Life,"" only to slowly coalesce again around cascading piano and brisk guitar chords masked by waves of distortion. The attention to craft and detail is what carries the final product, and it's no wonder it took Grant three years to record it on his own. Good News for Modern Man sounds remarkably fresh for guy who's released so little over the past decade. For now, I'm just glad he's still making records, and hoping this isn't his last.","Grant Hart claims he left H\xFCsker D\xFC because no one took him seriously as a\n\ singer/songwriter ...

The Iron Apple EP,Ui,by: Brent S.

When so many bands tack on throwaway lines, inside jokes, the label's pick for the first single, or random acquisitions that require extended narratives that tax even Serena Altschul's near-beatific tolerance for rock and roll bullshit, one simply has to give credit when someone does it right. Naming an instrumental album with artistic conviction requires no small degree of insight and introspection; an artist must stand far enough from the work to see it clearly. Ui's The Iron Apple EP simply could not stand under any other banner. The Iron Apple, like Burgess' ""A Clockwork Orange"" and Burroughs' ""The Soft Machine,"" struggles with lines between organic and inhuman. This is Ui at their most experimental and tweaked. Ui's 1995 debut, Sidelong, used the irresistible force of twin Fender Bass guitars to twine grooves around a solid, if mildly uninteresting, skein of funk drumming. Last year's Lifelike went farther into New York post-rock, where the bands' natural funky leanings served as the thinnest of lifelines while the music itself rocketed start- and- stop into the oddest time signatures and bizarre sonic hybrids. The album was weird, but surgically so-- all of its exhilarating strangeness smacked of calculation-- which alienated many and enthralled others. I sincerely hope that The Iron Apple EP is stalking out the future trajectories of Ui's strange wanderings. The five-track EP progresses from the very Lifelike-sounding opening track, ""Mrs. Lady Lady"" into cooler and cooler dimensions of abstraction. The title tracks is the sound of music being pumped full of strange inert gasses: one notices the signature grooves fail to synch up, and the spaces between instruments and notes becomes unbridgeable. The tendency is always from groove to mechanism, from the camaraderie of a trio of humans jamming with fluidity to musical miscommunication and alienation-- which is not to suggest musical ineptitude but rather an ear for sounds in insolation. The third track, ""Ms. Lady,"" is undergirded by squawks of fuzz noise as the guitars proceed tenuously into the disorder and attempt to construct precarious grooves which never seem to hold together. Something else always emerges. ""Golden Pietro"" makes nods to the style of futurism explored by Trans Am on Futureworld with sparse drum machines and looming synths. A Fender jazz bass plucks desperately at odd intervals; frightening whines of buzzsaw sounds starting cutting up the background. The buzzsaws become talk box guitar for the last few seconds of the track. The effect is unnerving. ""Run Pietro"" is the least coherent track on the disc and somehow the best and most emblematic. The noisy analog effects are held in perfect sway with limpid acoustic guitar lines. That Ui groove is there but you have to stand far back to see it, to hear it unfolding over a greater sense of time. In some sense, they've lost the ass-swaggering bass guitar love that made Sidelong such a great album to party to, but The Iron Apple puts Ui's closet funk algebraics to such impressive use. This is why the title of the disc struck me as so telling: there still resides a deep, soft sensuality in Ui's music, but the fruit is armored now and the apple has sharp corners.","Sometimes an artist just nails an album title; this accomplishment cannot be underrated.

Thinking of You,Bogdan Raczynski,by: Mark Richardson,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a1725e6ef959693201ad/1:1/w_160/4fd1eed8.gif,1999-11-23 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6638-thinking-of-you/,RephlexRephlex,"Polish drill-n-bass tradesman Bogdan Raczynski needs a good PR man. A good PR man would tell Raczynski that press releases are meant to introduce journalists to the artists and provide some background information that could be used in a review. Raczynski writes his own press releases, and he sees them as a forum to tell me (the reviewer) what a worthless, lazy, unoriginal parasitic worm I am. I quote: ""Let's be honest... you just write shit-ass reviews and interviews to further your own career."" Fair enough. But I refuse to be dragged down into the mud with Raczynski, and rather than panning his album in retribution, I'm giving it a fair listen. So it kind of sucks that Raczynski has actually gone and made a good (if a bit odd) record. The 11-track Thinking of You is a concept album of sorts, supposedly about the pain of unrequited love. And judging from the harshness of these digital textures, there's much pain in Raczynski's life. But there's beauty, too, and he knows how to shuffle and mingle the two in a compelling way. Witness the opening track, ""All I Want is to Be by Your Side But You Don't Care."" It begins with a choppy, hip-hop-inspired drum break that wouldn't sound out of place on a DJ Shadow record. Then, it folds in spoken words (I believe, Raczynski's native Polish), building tension slowly until releasing into a synthesized music box melody combined with some distorted, horribly out of key-- but strangely affecting-- singing. This swirling of the pretty and the ugly in a whirlpool of erratic beats and cheap, customized synths will undoubtedly remind many of the work of Raczynski's label boss, Aphex Twin. And indeed, much of Thinking of You compares to Aphex's work circa Come to Daddy. There are fewer moments of transcendent beauty here-- the lovely, minute-long ""Thinking of You Thinking of Me"" is the only beatless ambient track-- than on an Aphex Twin record, but Raczynkski exhibits the same skill for constructing beats and twisting sounds into something alien and new. The interplanetary ""Unsatisfied Consumer"" sounds like the work of a programmed Groovebox accidentally plugged into a 220-volt socket, with hectic, splattered beats and impossibly high vocal samples. More menacing still is ""You As an Out-of-Control Extension of Me,"" which features a drawn-out, orchestral string sample beneath a bed of booming drums and a throbbing, ominous bassline. Raczynski may not be the most ingratiating Polish expatriate, but he knows how to work his laptop.","Polish drill-n-bass tradesman Bogdan Raczynski needs a good PR man.

1975 EP,Duster,by: Mark Richardson,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ba41eb335119a49ec9a2/1:1/w_160/5459f5fd.gif,1999-11-22 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2494-1975-ep/,UpUp,"Some bands... you want them to change. Though you may have loved their initial sound, it gets tired after a few records and you find yourself hoping they'll try something new to stave off your boredom. Other bands-- bands like Duster... you like what they have going and hope they stay the course. Duster's slow, noisy and frayed sonic sludge is a thing o' beauty for those willing to look closely enough, and while their 1975 EP shows not a whit of growth from their two previous 7"" or their 1998 debut, Stratosphere, it still delivers the sad space rock goods in fine form. The only minor adjustment on 1975 is a slight- but- noticeable shift to a more song- oriented, and less sonic- dependent environment. On tracks like ""Memphis Sophisticate"" and ""And Things (Are Mostly Ghosts),"" the lyrics are clear and easy to discern, a rarity for a band this in love with distortion and cheap recording methods. Both these tracks jettison the layered guitars and meandering organ for a more stripped down approach, and while this uncluttered backing highlights what turns out to be pretty fair songwriting chops, something of Duster's singular identity is lost in the process. Yeah, these are good songs, but they sound like they could have been recorded by any number of other ""slow"" bands. Ultimately, Duster make their name as a band that focuses on the blurry edges around the picture and leaves the deeper meaning to the imagination. ""The Motion Picture,"" with drums that crawl by like a wounded sloth and an indiscernible vocal track that cuts in and out in double time, is closer to the Duster I've grown to love. Same goes for ""August Relatively,"" which uses the timeworn technique of backward drums to lend an otherworldly feel to the skeletal melody. But ""Want No Light to Shine,"" the EP's closer, is by far the highlight: with a gentle organ filling the spaces left by a nervous, trembling guitar, it seems so fragile it could disappear at any moment. And then it does, into a lovely coda played on an upright piano, a heartbreaking ending to another fine example of the Duster sound.","Some bands... you want them to change.

A Virus with Shoes EP,Two Lone Swordsmen,by: Dan Gardopee,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a8529d034d5c69bf39fc/1:1/w_160/c6350f9c.gif,1999-11-22 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8222-a-virus-with-shoes-ep/,Warp,"It's difficult being a member of the Warp camp, I'd imagine. Music press the world over would have you automatically pegged as ""intelligent dance music."" You can almost imagine the collective cartoon bubbles appearing above music journalists' heads when Warp is mentioned: musical alchemists, pretentious arseholes, self-consciously strange lads, bedroom boffins, chin-strokers par excellence. It's almost as if nothing you could release as a Warp artist could ever be considered poor. Just ""experimental."" Nor could it be considered particularly groundbreaking, because, well... whatever you do is expected to induce a lot of head-scratching and very little bum-waving. A quick listen to a handful of Two Lone Swordsmen releases might have the neophyte writing them off as ""self-consciously strange lads"" were it not for the men involved. Yeah, guys, Andrew Weatherall and Keith Tenniswood's names cast long, if spotty, shadows on modern music. Some would say their credentials make anything they're involved with worth listening to. I wouldn't go that far, but it's true that a lot of what they've put out would have received a muted response (if any) were it not attached to their moniker and the famed electronic label they record for. Two Lone Swordsmen have a lot of character, though. Their sound has a playful, in-jokey sort of levity that has also characterized fellow madcap ambient-electronic auteurs the Orb (whom Weatherall has often remixed and worked with). You almost get the idea that their obscure song titles (""Brother Foster Through the Phones,"" ""Cloned Christ on a Hover Donkey [Be Thankful]"") are not random at all, but in fact tied to some shared joke between which is no doubt utterly hilarious ""if you were there."" It's just one of the elements that make up a project which, for the most part, consists of two guys making music for themselves and having a good time with it. Some would say good music is always made with an audience in mind, lest it be impersonal and without significant weight. However, music made with an audience in mind also has the conspicuous additional baggage of being aimed at a demographic; albums may be cut down or edited in keeping with possible audience reaction, at the expense of the artist's vision. Weatherall and Tenniswood don't seem to give a good goddamn about demographics or audience perception, and it's unsure as to whether even the most devoted Richard D. James-obsessed Warpite would find much to latch on to, here. The songs don't differ too much from each other, although if pressed, I'd probably say that the subtly menacing ""Our Kid's Berwick"" would be the best of the bunch. There's a sort of cohesiveness to the whole affair that's a breath of fresh air compared to older releases by these fellows, just as last year's lovely Stay Down full-length seemed tied to some manner of ""underwater"" concept. It almost gives you the impression the bastards really know what they're doing now. If these two had a formula (and this is stretching it), it would be this: first, ready an arsenal of wobbly sounds, all set to cause various degrees of uneasiness in the listener. Drop some deceptively simple slow beats into the mix of wobbly sounds, which are now shooting about in some sort of warped, angular, methodical groove. Sprinkle odd washes of background ambiance and spoken word bits in there. Occasionally power this concoction with a rubbery woofer-pummeling bassline. This probably sounds interesting to many of you, and by and large, it is. However, one gets the feeling that an ""EP"" like this (it's album length, for sure) could be churned out once a week without much sweat. These guys are in control of their gear, and their sounds, but perhaps not their collective noggins. A little quality control could go a long way to cleaning up their releases, and though the anything-goes aesthetic is endearing at times, there are definitely times when you wish you didn't feel like skipping to the next track so damned often. In a time with so many balls-and-all electronic albums which, some claim, have something for everyone, this is an album which has a whole lot of something for a particularly odd sort of person. I guess that person could be described as ""a Two Lone Swordsmen fan."" Maybe they're aiming at a demographic after all.","It's difficult being a member of the Warp camp, I'd imagine.

Cowboy Sally's Twilight Laments for Lost Buckaroos,Sally Timms,by: Michael Sandlin,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a7b29d034d5c69bf3871/1:1/w_160/8a71e613.gif,1999-11-16 06:01:40,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8063-cowboy-sallys-twilight-laments-for-lost-buckaroos/,BloodshotBloodshot,"If genuine country music can be likened to a shot of Jack Daniels with a Jim Beam chaser, then Sally Timms' collection of country-tinged tunes might be like sipping a cup of Earl Grey tea. And I guess by ""genuine"" country I mean the bastard shit-kickin' Johnny Paycheck and Merle Haggard kinda country. Timms' take on the genre isn't exactly strong, intoxicating medicine for your troubles, but it might do just fine on a lonely winter's eve. I'll carry the beverage motif no farther, and just say that Sally Timms is by no means a great traditional country singer or songwriter. Truthfully, though, her voice never sounded better. It's dreamy, angelic, and totally guileless, not artificially countrified. But then again, she sang with those country-lovin' Brits, the Mekons-- a band that blended punk and rootsy Americana influences with British Isles folk. They never intended to be musical purists in the least. And here, Timms is paying her own distinct tribute to the music she loves. It's all elegantly rendered in her laid-back, monochromatic vocal style. There's no hipster irony, no feigned country accents, and no obnoxious posing here. I recently read a review in which Timms' latest album is denounced as a sham of sorts-- the treatment of these songs was evidently too un-country to register with this particular expert on the aesthetics of Hick. I mean, is it so inconceivable that the Beatles' versions of Buck Owens' ""Act Naturally"" or Carl Perkins' ""Matchbox"" could rival the originals? Here, Sally's just doing a little pretending, too. Nothing to get uptight about. Hell, for years now the Brits have been obsessed with the American West-- the frontier myths, cowboy culture, and especially the music associated with the region. Timms is simply living out her fantasy of being a barefoot, backwoods hillbilly songstress; she's sitting by the campfire, strumming her acoustic guitar, singing to the tumbleweeds and coyotes. Sure, there's nothing brilliant or ground-breaking about it, but no harm done on the ears, neither. And no, the production isn't the earthiest in the world, but the arrangements are simple and tight: it's mostly pedal steel guitar, fiddle, and occasional banjo-picking over delicate acoustic strumming. And it's damn hard to argue with the material Timms chooses to cover, namely Johnny Cash's brutal caveat to a lover gone astray, ""Cry Cry Cry."" Other highlights include a Timms original-- the Tex-Mex spice of ""Canciones Para Mi Padre""-- and even a little contemporary alt-country in the form of Jeff Tweedy's ""When the Roses Bloom Again"" and Jill Sobule's ""Rock Me to Sleep."" The title is appropriate, too, since the album really is catered to the buckaroo that's simply ""lost."" However, if you're a lost, lonely, jilted, drunk, unemployed, emasculated, near-suicidal buckaroo, maybe you should try some early Tammy Wynette, or a Merle Haggard Christmas album. Then you'll be shocked into existential contentment by what real country-fried pain and heartbreak is like. But if you're not quite ready to wallow in the ""authentic"" country music pigpen of abject sadness and depression, maybe try Cowboy Sally's Twilight Laments for Lost Buckaroos.","If genuine country music can be likened to a shot of Jack Daniels with a Jim Beam chaser, then Sally ...

Everybody Makes Mistakes,Starflyer 59,by: Beatty & Garrett,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a2165e6ef9596932032f/1:1/w_160/7a93eed1.jpg,1999-11-16 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7461-everybody-makes-mistakes/,Tooth and NailTooth and Nail,"We suspected Jason Martin, the craftsman behind Starflyer 59, had something up his sleeve last year when his Fell in Love at 22 EP saw him taking an abrupt stylistic left turn. It was nothing short of a total revision of the band's sound. The guitars blanketed instead of fuzzed. Hushed pianos and hypnotic keyboard effects gave his songs a newfound sophistication. And his voice, previously coated by layers of syrupy distortion, was not only audible, but genuinely agile. For those who heard it, the EP came as a surprise. Martin had scrapped the ""American My Bloody Valentine"" label and crafted songs that by turns caressed and entranced, and proved he was not only better than an above-average imitator but actually an original artist. While his new effort, Everybody Makes Mistakes, doesn't exactly pick up where that EP left off, it does preserve the same whimsical sense of experimentation. This time out, Martin has opted to scale back some of the loftier ambitions of the EP in favor of simpler song structures. And though the results might not be drop-your-jaw astounding, it's a beguilingly pleasant listen. The fuzzy guitars have returned, but the songs are no longer permitted to fray at the edges or drift off into a sludgy sonic netherworld. The chord changes are discernable; the melody is the focus. While they don't deviate too far from the non-stick surface of the Starflyer Pop Frying Pan, the melodies of Everybody Makes Mistakes wind their way down a more countrified route at times, and even occasionally find their way to the land of New Wave. The opening track, ""Play the C Chord,"" demonstrates the power of Starflyer's lethal catchiness, invading the brain without the benefit of a distinct chorus. The New Wave surfaces on the second track, ""No New Kinda Story,"" which flashes a ticklish, shimmering guitar hook before spinning into something downright sinister midway through. Another highlight comes with the morose ""A Dethroned King,"" a track that pummels with angst. If one criticism can be leveled at Jason Martin, it's that he sounds at times-- particularly on ""No More Shows"" and the aforementioned ""A Dethroned King""-- like he's reaching for that elusive Radiohead sound. To his credit, though, he never attempts to scale the signature vocal and musical peaks that would be required, contenting himself instead to take a more even path through the sonic foothills. Everybody Makes Mistakes clocks in at a misleading 40 minutes, which includes 8 minutes of silence and a woefully out-of-place Kenny G bootleg following the final track. But what it lacks in length, it compensates for in girth. This is chubby pop, dense and rewarding. One night of this album feels like a week-- a sleepless week. Martin artfully churns out well- crafted pop without ever sinking into a quagmire of repetition. It's not anything that hasn't been done before, of course, but it is damn good music.","We suspected Jason Martin, the craftsman behind Starflyer 59, had something up his sleeve last year when his Fell in ...

When the Pawn...,Fiona Apple,by: Chip Chanko,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a0d513d19756521384b3/1:1/w_160/f51b7331.gif,1999-11-09 06:01:40,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/247-when-the-pawn/,Sony,"Fiona Apple started writing in order to more effectively argue with her parents. As a kid who’d been identified as troubled and sent to therapy, she struggled to make authority figures see her side of conflicts. “So I’d go back into my room and I would write a letter and an hour later, I’d come out and read it—‘This is how I feel’—and I’d go back into my room,” Apple recalled in a 1999 Washington Post interview. “I would love the way that it felt to have your side of an argument right here in front of you. If I wrote a letter, I didn’t even need to win an argument.” In this, as in so much else, she was precocious. Great art has been motivated by that same impulse to correct the record—to impress a divergent worldview on those who’d prefer to ignore it, whether that audience numbers two or, in the case of Apple’s first album, 1996’s Tidal, three million. That remarkable debut contained rejoinders to a fickle lover, a rapist, and anyone foolish enough to write off Apple because she happened to be young or small or female. As a hip-hop fan, Apple understood the power of a boast. In its bluntness, Tidal also functioned as a preemptive act of self-defense from a person already accustomed to being misunderstood. A legion of new fans, many of them girls younger than Apple (who was 18 at the time of the album’s release), understood her messages of individualism and resilience instinctually. But her candor didn’t exactly prevent the press or the public from judging her harshly; though her notorious “this world is bullshit” speech at the 1997 VMAs constituted a cannier analysis of celebrity culture than most people in the entertainment industry wanted to admit, its messiness suggested that she was still a more eloquent writer than speaker. By the time she started composing her second album, Apple had a reputation—as a bitch, a brat, a heroin-chic waif and possible anorexic, a performer who, according to The New York Times, “plays a Lolita-ish suburban party girl” on TV but comes on more like a “shrinking violet” in concert. It was hers to shake off, or at least to reshape on her own terms. Although When The Pawn is, on its surface, a suite of 10 songs that dissect embattled loves and unhealthy desires, demonstrating the impossibility of maintaining romantic relationships when you’re always at war with yourself, the “you” to whom Apple addresses so many of her lyrics isn’t necessarily singular. Female singer-songwriters are generally presumed to be memoirists, but Apple has always maintained that the songs on this record were composed without any specific, personal incidents in mind. Often, she could just as plausibly be speaking to a derisive, judgmental public. The first clue that she was looking outward as well as inward is in the 90-word poem she chose as the album’s title: When the Pawn Hits the Conflicts He Thinks Like a King What He Knows Throws the Blows When He Goes to the Fight and He’ll Win the Whole Thing ’Fore He Enters the Ring There’s No Body to Batter When Your Mind Is Your Might So When You Go Solo, You Hold Your Own Hand and Remember That Depth Is the Greatest of Heights and If You Know Where You Stand Then You Know Where to Land and If You Fall It Won’t Matter Cuz You’ll Know That You’re Right Dismissed at the time as a meaningless ploy for attention, the poem is in fact pretty legible (despite the mixed sports metaphors) as a pep talk to a vulnerable person who’s gearing up to defend their unpopular truth in public—and, inevitably, get pilloried for it. Apple composed it on tour, after paging through reader responses to a 1997 Spin cover story, with photos by Terry Richardson and slobbery physical descriptions to match, that had painted her as a pretentious, melodramatic pill. “I had just sat on the bus and there’s Spin with Bjork on the cover and I picked it up and there were all these terrible letters in reaction to my story—‘She’s the most annoying thing in the world, etc,’” she recounted in the Post profile. “And I got so upset, I was crying, and I didn’t know how to make myself go on, make myself feel like it was all going to be OK.” But she did go on, by pushing back against her public image with blunt self-analysis. Released on November 9, 1999, When the Pawn isn’t a carefully constructed self-portrait so much as an aura-photo that captured a snarled psyche untangling itself with a fine-tooth comb. The narrator’s mistrust of happiness threatens an all-consuming romance in opener “On the Bound.” On “A Mistake,” over cymbals and synthetic boops that suggest an emergency without resorting to siren samples, Apple’s voice builds urgency as she confesses, “I’ve acquired quite a taste/For a well-made mistake/I wanna make a mistake/Why can’t I make a mistake?” Yet what begins as self-destructive rock cliché transforms into a lament about the not-exactly-punk qualities of conscientiousness and perfectionism: “I’m always doing what I think I should/Almost always doing everybody good/Why?” In place of the bravado of Tidal’s “Sleep to Dream” and “Never Is a Promise,” there is Apple’s keen understanding of the effects her intensity can have on others. And it doesn’t seem like a fluke that this theme is most pronounced on the singles. A jittery, syncopated sprint that plays up the nimbleness of her smoky alto, “Fast as You Can” famously taunts, “You think you know how crazy/How crazy I am.” It doubles as both a warning to a lover and a reclamation of a slur that had followed Apple throughout the publicity cycle surrounding her debut—one that has been used to dismiss willful female artists since the beginning of time. Years before pop culture got serious about authentically depicting mental illness, the song likens her inner struggles to sharing a body with a beast that could never be defeated or appeased, characterizing that fight as a process of “blooming within.” (In 2012, Apple began speaking publicly about her experiences with OCD.) “I went crazy again today,” she sings in “Paper Bag,” the Grammy-nominated single that may be the most fondly remembered track on When the Pawn. It’s Broadway meets the Beatles in its triumphal horn blasts, but as the melody grows ever bouncier, the words increasingly counter that levity with disappointment. The lyric starts out all stars and daydreams and doves of hope, before dispelling those pop song illusions to reveal the grim reality that the man Apple desires sees her as “a mess he don’t wanna clean up.” She’s never had trouble laughing at herself, and “Paper Bag” hinges on a sly reference to her own solipsism—“He said ‘It’s all in your head’/And I said ‘So’s everything’/But he didn’t get it”—that drags the singer and an uncomprehending public at once. The song is emblematic of an album that broadened Apple’s fragile, mercurial image not just with self-awareness, but also by expanding her sound beyond the jazzy, beat-backed piano ballads of Tidal. When the Pawn’s producer Jon Brion (whose baroque arrangements had recently created context for the dateless, scene-less voices of Rufus Wainwright and Aimee Mann) intuited that her style was distinctive enough to absorb other elements without losing cohesion. Still, even in his own estimation, he tends to get an outsized share of the credit for the record’s innovations. In a conversation with Performing Songwriter, Brion clarified that its unusual rhythms—namely, the time-signature shifts in “Fast as You Can”—originated with Apple’s songwriting. “In terms of the color changes, I am coordinating all of those,” he said. “But the rhythms are absolutely Fiona’s.” It was, in fact, Apple who dictated that division of labor. Brion recalled her beginning their collaboration by playing an almost fully realized When the Pawn on the piano, then telling him plainly: “I write pretty well, I’m a good singer, and I can play my songs well enough on piano. You’re good at everything else. So I think that’s how we should proceed, and if we are ever off-base, I’ll let you know."" With that in mind, he recorded her vocals and piano first, sometimes simultaneously, then added other instruments with help from a deep, impressive roster of professional session musicians. Despite mixing diverse sounds and styles, Brion’s arrangements cohered, giving the album a darkly romantic texture that overrode the clichés of any one genre. The results could have overwhelmed Apple’s songs, like collages pasted over pencil sketches, but Brion favored fine detail work over heavy-handed flourishes. The big kiss-off, “Get Gone,” pivots between enervated verses where sparse piano meets a brushed snare and defiant choruses that intensify Apple’s barroom keys with Douglas Sirk strings punctuating each acerbic vocal line with a bell. A groaning electric piano in the outro of “To Your Love” cuts through the prettiness of the song’s rhyming couplets, injecting some emotional complexity. Sandwiched between two of the album’s most daring tracks, “Paper Bag” and the delirium of “Limp,” is “Love Ridden,” a tender track in the Tidal mold where Brion’s string section merely shades in some negative space around Apple’s voice and piano. When the Pawn was, if anything, more frank in its descriptions of physical intimacy than Tidal had been. Yet the later album avoided exploiting Apple’s sex appeal in quite the same mode as that first album’s witty and widely misunderstood song “Criminal,” whose seductive slink and infamous video nonetheless resembled innuendo-laden ’90s teen pop more than anything she’s put out since. Apple’s new approach to sexuality was aggressive to the point of being fearsome. “I’m not turned on/So put away that meat you’re selling,” she growled in “Get Gone.” The frenzied chorus of “Limp” evoked gaslighting, sexual assault, and the public’s predatory voyeurism at once: “Call me crazy, hold me down/Make me cry; get off now, baby/It won’t be long till you’ll be lying limp in your own hands.” With the leverage of an artist whose first album had gone triple platinum—and a brilliant collaborator in her boyfriend at the time, filmmaker Paul Thomas Anderson—Apple also exerted control over the way she presented herself in music videos. A production number that had her dancing with besuited boys in a goofy reverie, Anderson’s clip for “Paper Bag” struck a blow against her morose reputation. In “Fast as You Can,” she wipes a foggy window until the camera can see her clearly. Most striking, “Limp” situated her in a home as dark as the one in “Criminal”; she puts together a self-portrait puzzle but fails to locate the piece that would complete a word scrawled on it: “angry.” In the final seconds, she stares down the camera as she spits out, “I never did anything to you, man/But no matter what I try, you’ll beat me with your bitter lies.” Every video in this series challenged the way viewers thought of Apple; “Limp” went farthest, implicating everyone outside the frame who would attack a well-intentioned stranger for sport. Some of these sadists were critics, of course. And they didn’t all see that Apple deserved to be excluded from this baby-vamp-slash-harpy narrative they’d invented for her. Even positive appraisals of When the Pawn (which predominated) made sure to get in a few shots. “Apple’s public persona has done her more damage than any mean-spirited journalist could ever hope to inflict,” wrote Joshua Klein in the A.V. Club. “At 22, she’s already more insufferable than Courtney Love, a fact that often threatens to overshadow her compelling music.” Jokes about the title were all but required in these pieces. Eric Weisbard at Spin may have hit on what was behind the negs from other male critics who knew the record was good when he noted, “The album, and I say this with appreciation, is a real ball-breaker.” If it didn’t quite boost Apple’s image among listeners who weren’t already fans, at least When the Pawn emerged at a time when her music could speak for itself. Tidal had appeared in a year when Alanis Morissette’s Jagged Little Pill spent 10 weeks at No. 1, despite having been released in June of 1995. With No Doubt, Tracy Chapman, Sheryl Crow, Natalie Merchant, Sophie B. Hawkins, Melissa Etheridge, Merril Bainbridge and Joan Osborne all on the Hot 100, it was Women in Rock season. The cover story that hurt Apple so much appeared in Spin’s November 1997 “Girl Issue,” not long after she toured with the inaugural Lilith Fair. The “angry woman” trend that had enabled her stardom meant constant comparisons to Alanis (another pissed-off young woman) and Tori Amos (another female pianist with a song about her rape). By 1999—a year dominated by rap-rock, teen pop, Smash Mouth, and Santana’s Supernatural—her singularity was apparent. (So devoid of Apple analogs was the pop landscape at the time that author and Rolling Stone critic Rob Sheffield allowed himself a rare overreach: “In a way, Apple’s music is a spiritual sister to the angst-ridden rap-metal of Korn and Limp Bizkit.”) In retrospect, her real peers were artists like Erykah Badu, the Magnetic Fields, Lauryn Hill, and Cornershop, unclassifiable songwriters who blended old and new styles into something timeless. As Entertainment Weekly framed it in their When The Pawn review, “the seemingly nonstop blur of young acts swamping the charts and MTV’s ‘Total Request Live’ does make one occasionally yearn for performers with—how to put it delicately?—longevity and substance.” It would take two more stunning sui generis albums (2005’s Extraordinary Machine and 2012’s The Idler Wheel…) to usher in the rise of pop feminism, and a more open, informed public conversation about mental health to convince the wider world of what sad teen girls had known since 1996: that Fiona Apple is far from crazy. But When The Pawn was so good it forced her detractors to take her seriously anyway, earning their grudging acclaim and launching the opening salvo in a fight she’d ultimately win. “What I need is a good defense,” Apple had pleaded on “Criminal.” Three years later, she’d become her own best advocate.","Each Sunday, Pitchfork takes an in-depth look at a significant album from the past, and any record not in our archives is eligible.

Box Music (Live 1971-1977),Can,by: Brent S. Sirota,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a4fdc0084474cd0c05fc/1:1/w_160/270667f1.gif,1999-11-02 06:00:06,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1271-box-music-live-1971-1977/,Mute,"Im Anfang war die Tät. In the beginning was the deed. This is the first line of Goethe's Faust and arguably the most famous words in the German language. The opening lines of the Gospel of John, ""In the beginning was the Word"" are inverted in a penstroke. The whole Christian tradition is turned on its head. We do not originate in the benediction of an incarnated word, but in the hazard of an unmediated act. That single line contains an entire manifesto of work, the rough beauty of human effort and human suffering. Can anything be quite as Protestant, quite as German as that? If ever there was a band to whom the Protestant work ethic could be applied, it is undoubtedly Can. If there was music that discarded the timelessness of pop for the earthbound temporality of experimentation, it is Can music. The sound of Can is the sound of labor, of unbelievable human exertion. Other collective improvisers like the Mahavishnu Orchestra approach the idiom of the mystical, while Can seems geared for construction. They had mastered a true industrial sound before that term was squandered on the sound of sparse rhythm and dreary, martial noise under Genesis P. Orange screaming: ""Discipline!"" ad nauseam. Can is itself an industry. Indeed, an industrial revolution. Their product strains description. The double disc Box Music (1971-1977) also eludes language. If architecture is frozen music, then Can is liquid architecture. These five men build earthworks so impossibly elaborate that it cannot even survive the process of its own construction: when the workmen have disappeared, so has the building. Box Music outstrips the tight tapeloop experimentalism of classics like Tago Mago and Future Days precisely because it is so heavy, so material: Jaki Leibezeit's jackhammer drums, the pig-iron slabs of Holger Czukay's bass, Irmin Schmidt's bright sheet metal keyboards, and the relentless industrial drill of Michael Karoli's guitars. The cumulative effect would be machine-like if the collective sound were not so violent and haphazard. The music remains organic because it sweats and suffers; you can hear fatigue and elation, strategy and struggle. Silence is weakness. Box Music culls non-professional recordings-- mostly cassette-- from the group's most experimental years, the years when Japanese street poet Damo Suzuki handled the vocals, following the departure of their original lead singer, the African-American Malcolm Mooney (who actually appears on a track from 1975). Suzuki's role on Box Music is somewhat limited, but then again, Can's music was never driven by vocals. The sound is too intensely collective to allow space for a single voice, almost tribal. The title of their earliest recordings captures it: Future Primitive. One can never tell whether it's the music of civilization coming or going. It is always devouring itself. The 14-minute ""Voo Doo Right"" from a 1975 show, is tribal savagery at its zenith, spiraling guitar and keyboards into a huge bonfire, burning over wartime drums. The audience applauding cannot even disrupt the listener; the whole affair approaches religion. The pyre skitters out into tight, phase-shifted funk as Schmidt's keyboards surface. Karoli's guitar is lyrical and lysergic, looping the upper air in serpentine passes before devolving into mechanized crunch. There is a momentary interlude of jagged no wave exchange of sloppy strums and broken drums, coalescing into a graceful bluesy reunion. The jazz-fusion of ""Fizz"" and the calypso-classical of ""Cascade Waltz"" reveal a sense of humor that would be unthinkable in the fractured noise of the 37-seven minute ""Colchester Finale"" from 1972. ""Colchester"" completely dominates the second disc of the collection, chugging sloppily along like the Velvet Underground's locomotive signature ""Sister Ray"" in space. Suzuki's beat whispering is unnerving, rinsing in and out with the lightning cymbals, occasionally lashing out as sadistic howls. The recording on ""Colchester"" is wretched, but the low fidelity effect is perfect. Flying Saucer Attack might have been born out of this matrimony of lockstep synchronicity and dead, white interference. Eventually, the reviewer must concede that Box Music is simply a critical black hole, swallowing every turn-of-phrase lightlessly; it will evade all my descriptions, comparisons and evaluations. Nobody's thoughts can keep up with this music. It was born of deed, not of word; it is from a time before or after language. Box Music is perfect work, pure expenditure. Like a fire, it takes everything into itself, into its own all-consuming energy. All these words we can toss on the fire, because you and I, we can't even come close.","Im Anfang war die T\xE4t.

I Want You to Live 100 Years,Warn Defever,by: Zach Hooker,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a8f99d034d5c69bf3b90/1:1/w_160/e95e8807.gif,1999-11-02 06:00:05,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2259-i-want-you-to-live-100-years/,LoLo,"Today, while driving, I listened to I Want You to Live 100 Years and Mos Def's Black on Both Sides back to back. The result: I spent the entire afternoon chanting the mantra, ""Warn Defever ain't got no soul/ Warn Defever isn't rock and roll..."" And, frankly he doesn't and he isn't, at least not this time out. For 100 Years, His Name is Alive's chief executive oddball assembled 11 faux-folk originals and a Willie Nelson cover, gave his various ethereal female vocalists the day off, put aside his normal bag of production tricks and just recorded himself playing the guitar and actually singing for a change. The result, not surprisingly, is one strange little album. The songs are interspersed with excerpts from a bizarre record featuring a man (coincidentally named Warren) capable of producing uncanny imitations of saws, trains, chickens, and fire dogs. These interludes add a sort of texture to the experience of the album, turning it into an impossible found document, perhaps discovered among the contents of a recently uncorked time capsule. The songs themselves aren't far off from imitations of popular music from an alternate past. Good, old fashioned hearth-side singalongs, Depression-era blues and imaginary Baptist hymns are mixed with bizarre lyrical turns (""The food I like is natural food, wooden fork and wooden spoon"") to reconstruct a musical tradition that never exactly existed to begin with. The effect is heightened by low fidelity recording techniques and the fact that Defever, in his characteristic duplicity, has shrouded the album in the sonic equivalent of a layer of dust, water stains and scratches. Underneath the crud are some excellent songs. Defever's songwriting is at the heart of His Name is Alive, and this setting creates a fascinating picture of what a HNIA album might be like in its nascency. It's easy to imagine any of these songs suddenly transformed by Defever's hand into a dub anthem or a tape-spliced surf-rock freakout; that he resists those temptations proves surprisingly gratifying. Cynics will say that Defever really shouldn't be singing-- hey, they've said the same thing about Mos Def-- and it's true that this album sheds some light on his decision to remain silent through most of His Name is Alive's material. Somehow, though, his quavering voice is oddly endearing on 100 Years, and the album's 31-minute running time gives the songs room to breathe without grating. Though it's most likely to appeal to rabid His Name is Alive fans and elderly Mormons nostalgic for their pioneering days, I Want You to Live 100 Years is a fascinating album and well worth looking into.","Today, while driving, I listened to I Want You to Live 100 Years and Mos Def's Black on Both ...

Kustom Karnal Blackxploitation,Unrest,by: Nick Mirov,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a8ebb1335d7bf16993c7/1:1/w_160/f037e5d0.gif,1999-11-02 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8361-kustom-karnal-blackxploitation/,TeenbeatNo. 6,"In this world there exist precious few bands, past or present, that are as fearlessly experimental as Unrest-- and even fewer who would dare issue so many experiments on one album. Can you imagine if Jim O'Rourke released a record that contained his early tape-manipulation work, avant-garde guitar strangling, minimalist orchestral pieces, and a few songs from his current Bacharach-worship period? It'd be pretty fucked up, and maybe even mind-blowing, but definitely not very listenable. Which sums up Kustom Karnal Blackxploitation excellently. Really now, how are we supposed to feel about an album with a title like that? And what are we supposed to think of song titles like ""Black Power Dynamo"" and ""Kill Whitey""? How about a 10+ minute-long spoken-word piece about Sammy Davis, Jr.'s car accident? Tuneless grunge-metal scowling like on ""Invoking the Godhead"" and ""Click Click""? A jokey wah-funk song called ""The Foxey Playground"" where every time Mark Robinson sneers ""She's Foxey!"" it recalls the Beastie Boys' ""She's Crafty""? All on the same album?! Overall, the best thing about Kustom Karnal Blackxploitation is that Unrest had sharpened their focus a bit since their previous album, the seven-layer-dip Malcolm X Park (both of which, incidentally, were first released by Caroline in 1988 and 1990 and are now being reissued through No. 6 and Teenbeat). More so than Malcolm X Park, Kustom Karnal reads like a catalog of Mark Robinson's various obsessions, from Kenneth Anger to blaxploitation films to Butch Willis, a little-known Beefheartian drug casualty that haunted the D.C. music scene in the mid-to-late 80's. While such name-checking and full-throttle irony was acceptable-- even cool-- back when this album first came out, these days it's a little bit harder to handle. If nothing else, Unrest earned its rightful place in the indie rock canon by being smart enough to take the five-second snippet of the song ""Teenage Suicide"" from the movie ""Heathers"" and complete it, turning it into a spot-on expression of confused adolescent melodrama. And then there's ""Chick Chelsea Delux"" and ""She Makes Me Shake Like a Soul Machine,"" two soft, pretty songs which point in the direction Unrest would take their next album, Imperial f.f.r.r.. But these three tracks aren't quite enough to recommend Kustom Karnal, since the quality of the other songs depends entirely on your willingness to forgive Unrest their stylistic excesses.","In this world there exist precious few bands, past or present, that are as fearlessly experimental as Unrest-- and even ...

Live 4/30/96,Jawbreaker,by: Brent DiCrescenzo,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b9d05e6ef95969322a54/1:1/w_160/36c3b3a0.gif,1999-11-02 06:00:03,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4212-live-43096/,BlackballBlackball,"It's an interesting study in voice to compare Jets to Brazil to Jawbreaker; the throaty Blake Schwarzenbach fronts both groups. Backed by the taut, hyperkinetic rhythm section of Chris Bauermeister and Adam Pfaler in Jawbreaker, Blake's vocals seemed to sneer and spit in frustration. But in Jets to Brazil, backed by That Guy From That Band That Had That Guy From Quicksand and That Guy That Drummed In That Emo Band Named After That Misfits Songs, Blake's voice comes across as a forced Oxford affectation-- a bad Richard Butler impersonation. The difference is a testiment to the power of punk rock, and more importantly Chris and Adam. Let's be honest-- the world needs a Jawbreaker song (perhaps even the Queensrychian ""Jet Black"") over any Jets to Brazil keyboard ballad. The continued trend of making live albums exclusively from one late- career performance has given the world some impotent live records. This basic bootlegging seems rather effortless. For Jawbreaker fans, it means sitting through the slower, over- thought material from Dear You instead of ""Want,"" ""Chesterfield King,"" or ""Incomplete."" ""Save Your Generation"" and ""Accident Prone"" are not bad songs-- and hearing them here is more economically beneficial than dropping $30 for a copy of the out- of- print Dear You on eBay-- but they're not exactly representative of Jawbreaker's greatest moments. It also baffles that a band would release live material recorded so close to their break-up. This period of a band's career has never been the most fruitful for ""classic live performances""-- especially when the show is a shortened set from a Rock for Choice benefit with the Foo Fighters. This being said, Live 4/30/96 merits purchase for three unreleased songs. ""Gemini"" shows that the band was leaning more towards the sound of 24 Hour Revenge Therapy's thick punk after the mildly disappointing Dear You, and ""Shirt"" similarly smokes with bratty energy. Thankfully, these songs' velocity never afford Blake his heavy- handed lyrical tendencies. The line, ""You're not punk and I'm telling everyone/ Save your breath I never was one"" from ""Boxcar"" punches harder than ""I have a present: It is the present/ You have to learn to find it within you."" Blake's attempt at stage banter is pretty unintentionally amusing, too. ""It's a thrill for us to play here... and have it be... fun,"" he mumbles between songs, stumbling through the worst segue of all time: ""Because we live here and it can be scary sometimes... this is about a scary time we had last year."" His stage presence is comparable to a shy ninth- grader's advanced- placement science project presentation or a disorganized DJ on low bandwidth college radio. The stammering nearly discredits his songwriting. Fortunately, the bubbly, larynx- booting rhythm section kicks in. The representation of 24 Hour Revenge Therapy-- namely ""Jinx Removing,"" ""Ashtray Monument,"" and ""Boxcar""-- still sharpen the point on Jawbreaker's flagpole claiming the land of Greatest Punk Band of the '90s. Then again, you can get those songs on the classic 24 Hour Revenge Therapy. And so we come again to the tired Live Album dismissal: for fans only.","It's an interesting study in voice to compare Jets to Brazil to Jawbreaker; the throaty Blake Schwarzenbach fronts both ...

Malcolm X Park,Unrest,by: Nick Mirov,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a8e95e6ef959693212f6/1:1/w_160/99b9af7f.gif,1999-11-02 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8360-malcolm-x-park/,TeenbeatNo. 6,"At one point in recent history, they were the archetypal indie rock band. Toeing the line between sloppy noise screes and sincere pop beauty, they peppered their songs with cryptic subculture references and served them up with huge ironic smirks. Sound familiar? Nope, I'm not talking about Pavement; before Slanted and Enchanted was even a gleam in Steve Malkmus' flinty eye, there was Unrest and their veritable cavalcade of self-released cassettes and 7""s that reeked of proto-slacker chic, punkish energy and collector geek enthusiasm. Malcolm X Park is their second proper full-length, originally released on Caroline in 1988 and now seeing re-release through No. 6/Teenbeat. It's a far cry from the classic Unrest of 1992's Imperial f.f.r.r. and 1993's Perfect Teeth, but if you squint just right, their metamorphosis from jokey garage band to love-pop crooners makes intuitive sense. By today's rather conservative musical standards, Malcolm X Park is way too amateurish and scattershot to be taken seriously, but it possesses a certain endearing anything-goes vibe that causes it to grow on you in ways that would make fungi jealous. More importantly, Unrest can actually pull off the dozen or so costume changes they make during Malcolm X Park's 17-track marathon, never allowing you to forget that behind all the noise, they're still just skinny white kids from the D.C. suburbs. Unrest run themselves ragged through punk-flavored riffs, screams and snarls on the title track and ""Castro 59;"" they goof relentlessly on old-time rock 'n' roll on ""Ben's Chili Bowl"" and ""Stranger in My Own Hometown;"" they make it clear they dig Kiss the most direct way they know how-- by covering ""Strutter"" and quoting ""I Wanna Rock and Roll All Night"" at the end of ""Disko Magic."" After all this, they still have time to toss off pretty pop songs like ""Can't Sit Still"" and ""Christina,"" as well as delicate instrumentals like ""Dalmations"" and the album's closer, ""The Hill."" Unrest's greatest and most frustrating asset is their lyrical obscurity; they drop enough hints throughout their music that you get the feeling they must be referring to something specific, but it's impossible to figure it out for sure unless you're seriously in the know. I got the Kenneth Anger reference in ""Lucifer Rising,"" but still have no clue as to what the fuck Mark Robinson is talking about during ""Castro 59"" or ""Dago Red."" But this band's motives have always been somewhat unclear; the most sensible explanation is that they simply wanted to catalog their own personal obsessions without explicit explanation. Listening to Malcolm X Park now, a staggering 12 years after its original release, the mystery has diminished a bit. In the end, Malcolm X Park has its advantages and disadvantages; not being in on the joke won't necessarily detract from the enjoyment of hearing a young, inspired Mark Robinson at his strangest.","At one point in recent history, they were the archetypal indie rock band.

It's the one with the kid midget and the witch. The witch brought a giant doll to life, you see, who is played by this kid midget with rosey dots on his cheeks and white gloves awkwardly slipped over his tiny hands. Naturally, most of the show is family drama posed by the gorgeous, but it's worth sitting through the arguments and kisses to get to the kid midget. Last week, a girl threw the midget behind a couch, where his archnemisis, the cat, tore him apart. This in daytime! It's David Lynch meets ""Sunset Beach!"" And after a while, those plastic characters and mangled monologues intrigue even more than the ""kidget."" Similarly, Gorky's Zygotic Mynci operates on this fascinating dementia versus dogmatic principle. Spanish Dance Troupe bursts occasionally with pixelated pop. ""Poodle Rocking"" and the title track gleefully purge with Welsh harmonies and halucinations-- like a hybrid of the Super Furry Animals and Belle and Sebastian, who are both blessedly demented in their separate ways. These moments spring from a field of moss- covered acoustic Saxon- ballads. Gossamer guitar and weeping fiddle drift through oddly affecting Renaissance fare. ""Freckles"" and ""The Humming Song"" pluck like a druid Elliot Smith. Simon and Garfunkel are occasionally invoked in songs as gentle and refreshing as tissues and ponds. A fog of harmonies hangs over duvet- covered horns and sighing pianos. Gorky's can commendably serve country and folk flavors to doggedly indie- rock palates. No matter how seemingly innocuous the tunes can seem, they'll subtly float you like chunks of dry ice on hard wood and leave beads of dew under your shoes. Treeless hills and Tolkein spill from their lips.

Nightlife,Pet Shop Boys,by: Paul Cooper,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a200ea9e61561daa4925/1:1/w_160/de7eb09d.gif,1999-11-02 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6247-nightlife/,SireSire,"My career counselor once advised me to seek disappointment. No doubt Mr. Thirp thought he was imparting in that vaguely oriental, gnomic nugget some great wisdom that would see me through my turbulent adolescence and ready me for the tangles and thickets of adulthood. Well, I have found disappointment, and I'm ready to testify that I was not prepared. Now I'm ready to confess that I'm not the most dyed- in- the- wool Pet Shop Boys fan, but I do appreciate urbanity, wry wit, sly verbal parries and a fine, stompin' four- to- the- floor amyl groove. But I'm so upset, it's the utmost I can do to stifle my tears, lest I short out my laptop. Nightlife, the follow-up to the Boys'sizzling fusion of Latin rhythms, deep house and jaded insouciance, Bilingual, is a mush of half- arsed trance, lyrics worthy of a late- middle- aged romance authoress and misguided R&B.; But it's Neil Tennant's wanton disregard for his own talents that's the real shame here. Now, I believed Tennant wholeheartedly when he sang ""Do I Have To?"" and ""I Would Normally Do This Kind of Thing."" I swooned when he crooned the chestnutty ""Always On My Mind."" He were almost the Noel Coward of dance pop-- the Cole Porter of Mies van der Rohe- furnished house! But now he tries us with clunky would- be aphorisms and bon mots. Did he think we wouldn't gag on lines like, ""Hear a song/ That's the bomb!/ If you don't get that mix/ It's gone '86!"" and ""When loneliness induces fear/ Like waves against a ramshackle pier""? Nightlife opens with the Rollo- produced and consequently extremely radio- friendly, ""For Your Own Good,"" a cautionary tale about the dangers of paying for sex when Neil Tennant is waiting to give you a cuddle and sympathy for free. Of course, one shouldn't expect a Pet Shop Boys album to open like a Jansky Noise/ VVM soundclash, but the rococo blandness of ""For Your Own Good,"" which relies heavily on samples from Rollo's Faithless project, sets one up for the mightiest disappointment since the lonesome evening you discovered that you couldn't perform auto- fellatio. Much in the same, erm... vein does Tennant work out his theological conundrums and his highest falsetto on ""Closer to Heaven."" The song isn't the rapturous disco paean to the profound beauty of the Trinity as one might have believed, though. Rather, Tennant dwells on the fact that whomever he's smitten with is-- gasp!-- both an angel and a devil. Yeah, only in a dance track could one hope to astound a captive audience with such insight. I just hope those shimmying to this effort are astoundingly bolloxed on a nine inch line of Special K snorted off some rank club urinal. Matters marginally improve with ""I Don't Know What You Want But I Can't Give It Anymore."" Here, Tennant develops and extemporizes on the theme of material gain and its inability to satisfy the desires which prowl our base natures. Or else he reckoned that being Everything But the Girl for a day would be beezer fun. But unlike ETBG's Tracey Thorn, Tennant doesn't have the dramatic vocal skill to make this song anything more than first- single- off- the- album radio fodder. Yeah, Nightlife has tracks that you could play on the radio, and then there are those that should be played only to those willing to be subjected to the utmost degradation and dehumanization. How else are we supposed to describe the computer- as- metaphor conceit of ""Happiness is an Option"" (as though emotions were selected in the preferences dialog box of the human mind) or the undying irritation induced by ""Vampires."" It doesn't pain me in the slightest not to delve into the swill that marks out the collaboration with Kylie Minogue (""In Denial"")-- suffice to say it's an ever- so- dramatic dialog between a daughter and her gay dad. But the rank slurry that is ""New York City Boy"" demands my attention (and your avoidance). Superficially, the track is a sort of coming home song and a reply to the Boys' version of the Village People's ""Go West."" But, taking a second to examine ""New York City Boy"" (for that's all you'll need), you'll soon realize that it's actually just a blatant rip off of that song. The track boasts a chantably identical chorus in addition to the same massed choir belting out the song in the worst Andrew Lloyd Webber fashion. Tennant barely makes an appearance; I hope that his decision to cop out of vocal duties was prompted by his shame and putting his band's name to such goop. One moral I've drawn from this wretched record: don't have high expectations of pop stars. Despite their protestations, they'll never fail to let you down. Despite myself, I'll seek solace in my beloved Gay Dad album.","My career counselor once advised me to seek disappointment. No doubt Mr. Thirp thought he was imparting in that vaguely oriental, gnomic nugget some great wisdom that would see me through my turbulent adolescence and ready me for the tangles and thickets of adulthood.

Every Day and Every Night EP,Bright Eyes,by: Zach Hooker,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a39fea9e61561daa4d0e/1:1/w_160/fd34525c.gif,1999-11-01 06:01:40,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/942-every-day-and-every-night-ep/,Saddle Creek,"When Pitchfork last saw Connor Oberst, he was wailing through Letting Off the Happiness, an album that asked a lot of questions and never answered any of them. For example, our neighbors are still wondering what that bizarre, strangled moan was. And the Violent Femmes' Gordon Gano is still wondering who made off with his vocal chords. I, of course, am wondering how anybody could possibly have so much to worry about at the age of 19. Actually, now that I think of it, Bill Gates was 19 when he made his first million (probably). And in that respect, you could say Oberst is the Bill Gates of mid-western adolescent rage-- he's got way more than any of us will ever need. Now, somebody once said that money can buy a certain amount of happiness, but after that, all it can get is more money. Ditto to Midwestern adolescent rage, if you substitute ""punk rock"" for happiness. There exists a threshold for yelling and screaming about how much stuff sucks, and crossing that threshold cam only make your music suck, too. Thankfully, Bright Eyes doesn't cross that line. Oh, but he's toeing it! Those of us who don't spend our days sitting in our bedrooms counting spiders may find the occasional lyric here cringe-inducing. But for the most part, Bright Eyes writes songs that are unlike most other peoples' songs. Despite the aforementioned similarity to early Violent Femmes, and the annoying fact that this EP's best song (""A Perfect Sonnet"") pretty much mimics Soul Asylum's ""Runaway Train,"" the five tracks here are pretty unique. Oberst's death-obsessed lyrics may be tough to swallow now and then, but when they hit their mark, they're undeniable. The instrumentation on Every Day, Every Night is varied and accomplished, and flaunts the same raw production values that made Elliott Smith's Either/Or sound both graceful and believable. It also doesn't hurt that Oberst's voice is left a little lower in the mix. To supplement the acoustic guitar, Bright Eyes draws sounds from an array of sources, from backwards drums to Chinese language tapes. And somehow, the various bits never seem gratuitous or disingenuous. What seems most important about these songs, though, is that they never really become self-indulgent. As more and more schmoes out there scrape up a couple of bucks to buy guitars and four-tracks, it's becoming increasingly important to set some standards. (Hey, no one wants to wade through EPs from every third person in America.) The ongoing democratization of music could be either a miracle or a disaster. It's just good to know that there are people like Connor Oberst out there raising the bar.","When Pitchfork last saw Connor Oberst, he was wailing through Letting Off the Happiness, an album that asked a lot ...

Walk the streets on a Sunday night-- it's completely empty. Even the residents seem resigned to the city's shortcoming. Walking back from the waterfront at dark, I encountered no one. The subway (which had a lengthy French acronym that slips my mind) was deserted. My stop was Olympic Park, a ghost colony of decaying sports facilities and lawns on the west outskirts. The entire complex was abandoned in the 70's. The domed stadium juts from the grass like an Atlantaen ship poured of molten bone. The giant vertebrae-shaped structure seems slick, but closer inspection reveals fissures and chips. In fact, the removable roof never works. Limp cables keep the dome closed eternally. Rumor has it that a baseball team still occasionally plays there. Understandably, this is the home of Fly Pan Am. Their very name suggests rusted nostalgia, cosmopolitanism, and sleek hipness. Unfortunately, Pan Am hasn't flown in quite some time. The few memories we have now are of blue stewardesses, hijacks, and disaster. This spectre haunts the self-titled LP from these instrumental Canadians The music is Pluto stark; it cushions like stucco. Guitars clink like windchimes over subtly rumbling bass. Cold samples hover above the skeleton. When a female chorus suddenly appears deep in the album, it feels like a sprout in ice. Wires turn to wings. If Mogwai weren't concerned with film directors and pop stars, they might make such bold statements. Yet, arctic urban ambiance clouds the middle bulk of this album, turning the record into an unwanted lecture on art. It could either be the sound of someone starting a tractor across a frozen field or a low-volume cricket. When the band settles into pulsating ghost-rock, the sly bass and humming guitars can rise a spectre from the corpse. Otherwise, it's much like Montreal at night-- isolated, foggy, and filled with structures and shadows borrowed from better places and times.

I Like You When You're Not Around,The Mendoza Line,by: Jeremy Schneyer,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c430eb335119a49ed8b7/1:1/w_160/97429b16.gif,1999-10-26 05:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5227-i-like-you-when-youre-not-around/,KindercoreKindercore,"The Mendoza Line have been creating utterly lovable back porch- style indie rock for a few years, and now have two sublime albums and a lengthy EP, all on Kindercore Records, to their credit. Their latest effort, I Like You When You're Not Around, is chock- full of the homey melodies, shuffling beats, wry lyrical twists, and guitars that range from sweetly- plucked to fully fuzzed- out that made their first two records so appealing. Co-singer/ guitarists Peter Hoffman and Timothy Bracy both sing as if they're half- asleep with a mouthful of mashed potatoes (which is a shame when they're singing lines as great as ""Three A.M./ You're crawling 'neath the bar stools/ Tying together some poor fucker's shoes/ Whispering the Catholic girl's blues/ In coffee shops and neon bars/ All the places we played cards/ We are not welcome anymore"" on ""You Twitch When You Dream""). Many of the songs on When You're Not Around have a small town feel to them-- most of them are about nothing more profound than hanging out with friends, getting drunk, and complaining about crappy relationships. The songs themselves range from quiet, navel- gazing contemplative numbers (""Social Thursday,"" ""The Kissing Rocks"") to relentless rockers (""Pushing Buttons,"" ""An Enterprising Molecule"") with pretty much everything you can think of thrown in between, from slightly psychedelic instrumentals to brilliant power-pop. There's even a self- proclaimed ""new wave"" tune (""We'll Never Make the Final Reel""). But for all its musical variation, pretty much all of the songs on the record carry the same bleary- eyed, back- porch kinda vibe that lends the album, depending on your point of view, either a numbing, pharmaceutical sameness, or a sleepy, comfortable ambience akin to your favorite flannel shirt. I guess my main complaint with When You're Not Around is that, for some odd reason, they only included lyrics to about half the songs. This means that, aside from the few catchphrases that manage to break through the hung- over mumble of the Mendoza Line's vocalists, many of the subtle nuances of the songs are lost because, without a lyric sheet, Bracy and Hoffman's utterances are pretty unintelligible. Let me put it this way: if you like the new Pavement record but just wish that Steve Malkmus would quit enunciating his words so clearly (or if you're just down with that aforementioned utterly lovable back porch- style indie rock), you should be handing your $12 over to these guys.","The Mendoza Line have been creating utterly lovable back porch- style indie \n\ rock for a few years, and now ...

When Bikini Kill formed in the late '80s, their mix of catchy punk tunes and hard-hitting politics were a timely wake-up call to the male-dominated alternative rock scene in the Pacific Northwest, positioning the band as icons and role models to girls across the country. But cultural climates change quickly and alarms are intended to wake people up, not to go off all day. Once the shock of the new of the riot-grrl movement wore thin, few were listening short of riot-grrls themselves. Rather than continuing to preach to the choir, Hanna has called off mass in favor of a dance party. As Le Tigre, she teams up with fanzine producer Johanna Fateman and independent video and filmmaker Sadie Benning. Let's compare Le Tigre's self-titled debut to the most famous use of music for political ends ever. CASE STUDY #1: THE USES AND ABUSES OF FLEETWOOD MAC IN THE POLITICAL SPHERE
Hypothetical excerpt from a transcript of a Clinton campaign strategizing sessions: Bill Clinton: I think people are saying we will stop. What's up with that? George Stephanopolous: Bill, don't stop! Bill Clinton: Stop what? Hey, I saw that fine program, ""Behind the Music: The Stevie Nicks Story"" for the 10th time on VH1 again this afternoon. Do you think either of you boys could arrange for Stevie to drop by the White House tomorrow evening? James Carville: Look, Bill. As your advisor I have to tell you, I don't think getting any further ""behind her music"" will help your presidential campaign. George Stephanopolous: Actually, James, you are totally wrong. It's perfect! [singing:] Don't/ Stop/ Thinking about tomorrow/ Don't/ Stop/ It'll soon be here... Bill Clinton: I won't stop thinking! James, did you find Stevie's number? I could be her Silver Spring! I know I could do it! Do you think she's available tomorrow? The rest is history. Fleetwood Mac's ""Don't Stop"" was programmed to play on repeat at the Democratic National Convention, culminating in an unforgettable saxophone rendition of the classic by Clinton's recovering brother, ""Roj,"" and the song became inextricably tied to Clinton's campaign. ""Don't Stop"" was then put in higher rotation by so-called-leftist media outlets such as Easy Listening KISS 105.1FM to bolster the Democrats in the Presidential race. Yet, there was no obligation to report the airplay as campaign spending. Meanwhile, the target demographic car-danced to the album in their yuppie-mobiles all the way to the voting booth. Money spent on broadcasting ""Don't Stop"" across America was softer than wet camel food (an anagram for Fleetwood Mac). Outcome: a Landslide! ""Don't Stop"" was played at the inaugural gala. CASE STUDY #2: THE POTENTIAL OF LE TIGRE IN THE CULTURAL AND POLITICAL SPHERES
Hypothetical excerpt from a transcript a Le Tigre campaign strategizing sessions: Kathleen Hanna: I think people are saying we will stop. What's up with that? Johanna Fateman: Kathleen, don't stop! Kathleen Hanna: People are saying that ""girl-rock"" is either angry and aggressive replays of riot-grrl cliché's or over-produced bubblegum schlock. Johanna Fateman: Well, sure, there's a lot of crap out there. But there's also a lot of stuff out there that doesn't fit into either of those categories. I mean, Kathleen, you're like the riot poster-grrl, and even if your last project as Julie Ruin wasn't incredibly successful, it certainly wasn't riot-grrl cliché. Kathleen Hanna: Do you think we could make a record that more girls and boys listen to without abandoning the politics that inspire our music? The music could then inspire the girls' and boys' politics! Johanna Fateman: We could sugar the pill! Coat our politics in pop that's a little bit easier to swallow. Sadie Benning: Sugar the Pill?! Why not go all the way and lace our feminist lyrics with pop-crack?! Even the boys will like our pop-crack! RECIPE FOR LE TIGRE POP-CRACK: 1. Take basic garage rock song structures that make you want to sing along and update them with some pop, punk, and surf-guitar. Think Slits, Raincoats, and later Bikini Kill in a blender. 2. Layer the songs with lots of samples to create atmospheres that will inevitably be described as ""cinematic."" 3. Frost the songs with hip-hop-infused drum machines, old-school electronics and new wave keyboards. These songs are addictive. They will be the soundtrack to kitchen dance parties in every house this album enters. Le Tigre brought their multimedia dance party to Providence, Rhode Island a few weeks ago and I went to buy the album a few days later. I needed the crack, and I wasn't alone. Right now, Le Tigre is the Amazon.com's #2 best-selling album to University Students in Rhode Island! The lyrics are less didactic than Bikini Kill's and are geared for the repeated listens these well-crafted pop songs beg for. The catchy ""Hot Topic"" includes a list of musicians, writers and activists whose work deals with ""hot topics."" The chorus repeats: ""Hot topic is the way that we rhyme."" Hanna sings, ""You're getting old/ That's what they say/ But don't give a damn/ I'm listening anyway."" Remember how people raced to figure out who all those names were in Billy Joel's ""We Didn't Start the Fire"" and Madonna's ""Vogue?"" ""Hot Topic"" will work the same way. Most listeners will already recognize names like Joan Jett and Sleater-Kinney, but what about Billy Tipton and Vaginal Cream Davis? Le Tigre leads off with ""Deceptacon,"" a hook-driven number that satiates your desire for no-strings-attached entertainment with lyrics such as, ""Wanna disco?/ Wanna see me disco?/ Let me hear you depoliticize my rhyme,"" and then moves into a lament on the lack of meaningful lyrics in popular rock. The band also takes a shot at experimentalism with ""Slideshow at a Free University"" and ""Dude Yr So Crazy,"" which pairs a collage of descriptive phrases with a sound-loop that humorlessly conjures stalkers and psychopaths from classic American films. Radical feminist and anarchist Emma Goldman once said, ""I don't want to be part of your revolution if I can't dance."" Like Fleetwood Mac before them (but with more politically relevant lyrics than, ""All I want is to see you smile/ If it takes just a little while""), Le Tigre's debut will provide anthems for their target demographic. Fleetwood Mac reached out to hippies and people who liked to look at Mick Fleetwood's faux-testicles. Le Tigre aims for anyone interested in an addictive pastiche that could ultimately lead to metaphorical ""voting-booths"" for the cultural and political issues they're singing about.","Kathleen Hanna is best known as the former leader of Bikini Kill, the band that defined the\n\ early '90s ...

The crowd was a tan sea of fraternity types who likely showed up because Sonic Youth is, like, really loud. When Ian Svenonius grabbed the mic (and his crotch) and began yelping like Prince was bursting through his chest, the fraternity types looked at each other silently and decided in a wave of raised eyebrows that this singer was a ""pussy."" The heckling soon followed. Even before a mob of extracurricular athletes Ian Svenonius continued to scream bloody soul. If anything, the man had frightening conviction. These were the ""formative years"" of the Make-Up. Now what are those fraternity types up to? Most likely they're consultants of some sort who drive Altimas. They probably spent $85 to see Bruce Springsteen at the Target Center. Yet, somehow, strangely, those guys might dig the new Make-Up record. ...Well, okay, it's more likely they'll dig the new Tonic album, but I can dream of a rock renaissance. Save Yourself smells like the '60s. It smells like leather Chevy seats soaked with ass sweat. It smells like incense and pepper. It smells like stems and seeds on a cardboard record sleeve. This greasy, haunted spectre of a record bears disturbed spirits of bands long dead, like the Doors, the Rolling Stones, and Prince. The band brilliantly and concisely sums their image with the song title ""White Belt."" In the mouth of Beck, this might come across as a retro songwriting prop. Yet the Make-Up spit ""White Belt"" like activists, and that track spanks ridiculously funky keys like the soundtrack to a Black Panther being chased in his Nova. Save Yourself stubbornly eats from the salad days of rock and roll, specifically the late '60s, as contemporary music continues to spin toward sardonic Pro-Tools pastiches. The album can proudly stand next to the Rolling Stones' Between the Buttons in even the baldest, pony- tailedest guitar shop employee's collection. Raw and clean with a touch of psychedelica, Save Yourself punches the perfect buttons with devilish effeciency. These obviously analog, airy recording techiniques in an era of digital gloss feel like a juicy peach after a diet of Mesquite Fritos. Somehow, even a Jimi Hendrix cover manages to sound tougher and more vital 30 years after the original. It's amazing that most of the Make-Up's post- Nation of Ulysses fanbase has dropped off as the band has steadily grown into America's rock and roll saviors. The Make-Up approach the history of rock and soul like a lover, like a scientist, and like a preacher. This record can make even the most jaded Punk Planet columnist proud to be an American. The British had their day in the '60s-- now they'll have to settle for the Manic Street Preachers.","The Make-Up opened for Sonic Youth on a soccer field at the University of Georgia.

The hyperdimensional elves are here with me again, but they appear to be on a coffee break this time. Usually when I visit, they're hard at work weaving the fabric of the universe from superstrings; now, though, they're dancing amongst these wispy clouds that seem to have music emanating from them. It sounds like... well, like the kind of music that hyperdimensional elves would dance to. The clouds bounce around in a sort of Brownian motion as the elves dance, but when I try to reach out to touch one, it evaporates in a chilly mist. I try to ask one of the elves what the music is, but my mouth is made of foam, and the word bubbles float away without popping. Then I wake up and go to this party. It's one of those faux- classy casual- formal affairs that I feel compelled to attend because I'm supposedly an ""adult"" now. Anyway, the party's dull and I barely know anyone. At least the bar is fully stocked. As I mix myself my fourth Sidecar, I begin hearing it again... the music. I experience a brief moment of inward panic: am I having some sort of drug flashback? I follow the music to the huge speakers in the corner of the living room, but with each step I take towards the stereo, the music grows quieter. When I stand directly in front of the speakers, I hear nothing except the low- level chatter of the party. I feel the presence of a person next to me. ""You like?"" A woman's voice says. I pause. No one has spoken a single word to me since I arrived. Am I being hit on? Am I obviously so drunk as to be an easy target for some freakish desperate person? I don't turn to face her, but instead attempt to exude an exterior of detached cool. ""What is it?"" I ask offhandedly. ""Guess,"" she says. ""Hmm..."" I hum. ""I can't tell..."" ""You can't hear it because you're listening to it,"" she says. ""You must learn not to listen to it in order to listen to it."" My bluff was called. ""Uh... how?"" I ask. I feel someone take my hand. ""Dance with me,"" she says. We dance. She holds me so closely that I still can't see her face. Her hair smells faintly of cookies. She whispers into my ear, ""Now do you hear?"" ""I do,"" I say. It's some sort of retro- futuristic easy- listening lounge music, except it's very... strange. Chirpy, yet laid- back. ""That singer sounds like Laetitia Sadier from Stereolab."" ""It is,"" she says. ""But it's not Stereolab, because there's a guy singing too,"" I say. ""No, it isn't Stereolab,"" she says. ""Well, it's definitely not Combustible Edison,"" I say. We continue to dance, not listening to the music. ""Why can't I hear the music when I try to listen to it?"" I ask. She says, ""Because it ceases to exist when you do. It's only meant to provide atmosphere, not to act as the center of attention. Is that not the nature of all music?"" I am taken aback. ""No, it isn't,"" I blurt out. ""Music shouldn't exist as mere sonic punctuation unworthy of closer inspection."" I feel her tense up slightly. ""What are you saying?"" she asks. ""Are you saying you don't like this music?"" I know I have offended her somehow, but keep talking nonetheless. ""Well, what good is music if you can't listen to it? What good is it if you can only perceive it peripherally, but never directly?"" ""It's just fine the way it is,"" she says, a trace of anger in her voice. ""No, no, it's not,"" I say. I don't know why I persist-- maybe I'm more drunk than I thought.

The Days of Our Nights,Luna,by: Neil Lieberman,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd9a13d197565213b595/1:1/w_160/79941bde.gif,1999-10-26 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4917-the-days-of-our-nights/,Jericho,"Catching Luna live this past Saturday night at the gilded basketball gym that is San Francisco's Fillmore Auditorium, I found myself contemplating the band's meandering history and its latest release, The Days of Our Nights. In the context of Beulah's inspired opening set, Luna's Dean Wareham is easily pegged as a progenitor of '90s indie rock. His seminal band Galaxie 500 set the table in the late '80s, updating the Velvet Underground's rhythm guitar- based rock and serving as a reference point for the explosion of indie bands that would crowd the coming decade. Just as it's hard to imagine Galaxie 500 or Luna without the Velvets, imagining Beulah without Wareham's work is equally as difficult. Upon first hearing the news that Wareham had left Galaxie 500 to team with the Feelies' drummer, Stanley Demenski, I remember thinking it was a good idea. And largely, it's been one. With Luna, Wareham has produced a consistent if not earth- shattering catalog in the '90s, never quite matching the surreal jamming and energetic brilliance of their first effort, 1992's Lunapark, but never quite embarrassing himself, either. Somewhere between 1995's Penthouse and 1997's Pup Tent (which also marked Demenski's departure) the band shifted to a warmer, more sultry sound-- a trend not entirely abandoned on The Days of Our Nights, and most evident on the album's opener, ""Dear Diary."" Heard amidst favorites from throughout the band's career (unlike many long- lived recording artists, Wareham seems neither in denial nor ashamed of his past), the songs off the new album blend nicely. ""Superfreaky Memories"" is this album's ""Bobby Peru,"" an instant pop gem, while ""Four Thousand Days"" and ""Seven Steps to Satan"" both mark a return to the band's more instrumental, Velvets roots. That the album so effectively captures the band's sound is to its detriment, though, as the songs lack some innovation and surprise. Where Pup Tent seemed a step up for the band, Days is another Penthouse- ish respite. ""The Slow Song"" is another creepy foreign language affair, while their cover of Guns N' Roses' ""Sweet Child o' Mine,"" comes off disappointingly similar to what one imagines it to be. There's a story to this album, too-- one that will likely taint most consideration of it. Dropped by Elektra just before the album's scheduled release earlier this year, the band and album sat in limbo through the summer and early fall until Luna hooked up with Jericho Records. Thus, The Days of Our Nights carries with it the added weight of anticipation and the aura of transition sparked by a label change. Considered correctly, however, outside this context (after all, the change was not made on an artistic basis), the album is the estimable follow- up to Pup Tent, and neither ground- breaking or transitional. Yep, it's a Luna album, alright. But as we've come to expect, it isn't half bad at all.","Catching Luna live this past Saturday night at the gilded basketball gym that is San Francisco's Fillmore Auditorium, I ...

Always eager to survey the opinions of my peers, I quietly cheated while observing their reaction to the music. Hippie chick was characteristically silent, not reacting positively nor negatively. She smirked, threw cards, and smirked some more. Penetrating Gaze Man was not so reserved. He fixed his gaze-- which is indeed penetrating-- upon mine and said, ""This is pure eurotrash, man."" When you put a penetrating gaze and a deep comment like that together, y'know whatcher got? A review, my friend, a review. Despite my initial delight at the first couple of tracks, which could be likened to Blue Lines- era Massive Attack, I could feel only horror when I realized that his penetrating gaze concealed an stoic musical erudition not often seen. I perked my ear up, and indeed, we were listening to exceptionally vapid eurotrash. My friend turned to the speaker and mocked, ""This is the time on sprockets when we dance,"" his hands gaily twitching from under his armpits, his cheeks sucked in, his gaze, as always, penetrating. I laughed, cheated some more, and reflected on my disappointment with the record. The rain hissed outside and hippie chick smiled at me. Penetrating Gaze Man was right.

Apparently, Idlewild were out back taking a piss when the last copy was sold. Idlewild is a band that's been unfairly tagged ""punk-revivalists."" But while there are a handful of straight-ahead punk songs on Hope is Important, the band's punk attitude and throttle fuses with a more palatable rock modus operandi on the record's brightest moments. What truly sets Idlewild apart from the unwashed masses of wannabe punk bands that follow the yellow prick road paved by the Sex Pistols and the Exploited, though, are the distinct traces of indie rock influences-- from Husker Du to Superchunk-- that percolate up through their punkish rush. The group, comprised of vocalist Roddy Woomble, guitarist Rod Jones, bassist Bob Fairfoull, and drummer Colin Newton, has existed since 1995. But Hope, their U.S. debut, shows a band as inexperienced at record-making as a group of teenage punks just signed to Flipside Records after their first gig at Coney Island High. As the liner notes indicate, the album was recorded in a total of 29 days, spread over the course of six months. In this regard, they remain true to the punk paradigm-- the album sounds immediate and desperate. You can practically hear them being dragged out of the studio as their lease runs out. Thus, many of the weak songs that might have otherwise been tossed (read: those that rely too heavily on punked-up guitar noise and strained vocals to disguise flimsy hooks), are deposited onto the album as filler. The other major blemish to the album, unfortunately, is the frontman. If your only role in the band is to provide the vocals and get a rise out the crowd, you better be damn good at it. I mean, you don't have to be Liam Gallagher-- or even Chris Robinson, for that matter-- but you do have to be engaging, and able to flow with the music. Roddy Woomble (that's got to be his real name, doesn't it?) has his moments, sure enough. His vocals have a lip-curling appeal to them, at times. And he shines on the album's single, ""When I Argue I See Shapes,"" sounding eerily like Blink 182's Tom Delonge channeling Michael Stipe. Except Scottish. And with a brain. But even in his best hour, Woomble still can't keep time with a kindergarten 4/4 beat. Maybe he should learn to play the recorder, or perhaps, pick up a copy of Hooked on Tempo (now available at your neighborhood Pamida store). Essentially, Hope is Important is an album of singles. Only ""When I Argue I See Shapes,"" ""Paint Nothing,"" and ""I'm a Message"" manage to break free of the punk chains with commendable results. As a punk band, Idlewild is nothing special: they've got no political agenda, they're not ugly enough to use their social frustrations as fodder for songs, and they don't piss off government officials. But as a punk-tinged rock outfit, they have some cache. If they can keep the punk in the back of their heads and off their guitar strings, maybe they'll get some more studio time. And, hopefully, we'll get an album showcasing the songwriting talents that are merely hinted at here.","There are three things that are absolutely unforgivable in the Punk Handbook: hooks, tunefulness, and any demonstration of musical talent ...

Jesus Life for Children Under 12 Inches,Kid Loco,by: Paul Cooper,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bb8dc0084474cd0c28aa/1:1/w_160/c6e61dbc.gif,1999-10-19 05:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4417-jesus-life-for-children-under-12-inches/,AtlanticYellowAtlanticYellow,"If you're founding a new nation, e pluribus unum (""out of many, one"") is a noble and winning principle. From many disparate cultures, you will forge a single unified populace. Your nation will be founded on the basic common needs of humanity: the need for shelter, food, water, love, and Cajun-spiced curly fries. Your people will not see difference, they will see homogeneity. They will be of a loving, peaceful nature, because they will have chosen to transcend their idiosyncratic backgrounds and belong to a greater whole. However noble e pluribus unum may be in nation-building, though, it's a lousy principle when it comes to music, as Jesus Life for Children Under Twelve Inches amply demonstrates. This disc is a collection of remixes by French easy-listener and trip-hopper, Kid Loco (aka ex-punk Jean-Yves Prieur), and it showcases Loco's ability to miss the point of remixing. Remixing, if it has a purpose beyond shameless marketing, is meant to make the source material more interesting to a different sector of the music-buying public. It's a cross-over tactic that only works if the remixer makes the source music more appealing. And throughout the duration of this record, I found myself more interested in the originals than Loco's boo-di-bip lounge-hop versions. The dancing-Shiva Bollywood strings of Talvin Singh's ""Traveller"" are Loco-ized in an identical manner to the poverty shuffle of Scottish indie stars, the Pastels. Loco's dissection of Mogwai's ""Tracy"" is blunted and made ready for polyester easy-listening dolts everywhere. From Pulp's dole-queue masterpiece, This is Hardcore Kid Loco swipes ""A Little Soul,"" mislaying the grit and anguish of Jarvis Cocker's performance. You can't help but notice that the cover of Jesus Life for Children Under Twelve Inches is a sweet trolley of luscious naked women, the likes of which haven't been seen since Hendrix's Electric Ladyland. I'd guess that this cover is the only thing that will catch anyone's attention. E pluribus unum-- out of many sources comes one homogenous blandness. Let's wish Loco better luck founding a nation.","If you're founding a new nation, e pluribus unum (""out of many, one"") is a noble and winning principle ...

Straight Lines,Ken Vandermark's Joe Harriott Project,by: Brent S. Sirota,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a90fc0084474cd0c0f79/1:1/w_160/74c00080.gif,1999-10-19 05:00:01,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8395-straight-lines/,Atavistic,"When it comes to poetic justice, Ryan Schreiber is second only to God. Ever wonder why it takes him so long to get our discs to us to review? Because he's portioning out holy recompense for each of our virtues and each of our transgressions. Every time he sends out that big list of review discs to the Pitchfork writers he seems to say, just like God: ""I have set life and death before you this day. Choose life."" I have actually caught him on occasion wearing an oversized white t-shirt with CHOOSE LIFE written in big letters, to reinforce his message. I asked if he had any fingerless fluorescent gloves to go along with it and he punched me in the stomach. I asked him to ""help me up before you go-go"" and he kicked me in the back. I swear if it weren't for all the money and the floozies, I'd have a good mind to quit this job. Ah, poetic justice! Not the casual ass-whooping-- those are just par for the course. Rather the irrevocable fact that I am inevitably compensated for my pretensions with every piece of avant-jazz, experimental noise or Kranky-style cerebral post-rock that traffics through the front offices at One Pitchfork Way. Every shipment of discs I get seem to scream: deconstruct this, you prick! And so, I find myself on the business end of an OED and a dog-eared copy of Adorno, trying to come up with two dozen different ways of saying the word ""groove"" without being implicated in a bourgeois aesthetic ideology. Goddamnit, how many discs can I describe as ""Kafkaesque"" without eventually losing every last shred of credibility? I don't even know what rock music sounds like anymore. What's in the mail today? A McArthur fellow fronting reinterpretations of the free jazz work of an obscure Jamaican alto player. See what I mean? The contributions of Joe Harriott (1928-1973) to the free-improv movement have largely gone unnoticed. Branded a follower of the celebrated free jazz pioneer, Ornette Coleman, Harriott didn't live long enough-- nor famously enough-- to have the world take pause at his radical innovations in modal jazz. Students now suggest that the London-based Harriott and the American Ornette developed their compositional and improvisational technique in near-total isolation from one another, advocating a strong review of Harriott's ideas in light of his removal from the American free jazz scene of the 1960's. Like John Zorn's hyperkinetic 1989 Spy vs. Spy, a furious reinterpretation of Ornette Coleman's work as composer, Ken Vandermark's Joe Harriott Project isn't offering a tribute, but a retelling. Harriott's arrangements are transformed into Vandermark's spacious and disconnected lines. The signature piano of Harriott's work is absent, and the alto is augmented by clarinet and trombone duels intertwined in the rhythm. The album exudes a beatnik vibe of radical ease. Vandermark's staccato sax lines suggest a Joe Harriott refracted through the work of another short-lived horn player, the immortal Eric Dolphy. The sparse angular attack is always executed with meticulous control, free from any trace of the excess or self-indulgence that seems to mar other contemporary exercises in collective improvisation. Even the fragmented ""Shadows"" remains intensely lyrical, while the defiantly looping ""Straight Lines"" is reminiscent of the near-perfect Oliver Nelson album, The Blues and the Abstract Truth, in muted uprising and subdued discord. Jeb Bishop's quiet trombone solo on the title track is one of the album's simple highlights. The entirety of Straight Lines revels in the glory of revision: the giddy thrill of hearing for the first time what the world was formerly deaf to. As for me, I can't complain. I thrive on precisely this kind of music, this marriage of melody and resistance. Sure, it sounds like a boulder slipping down from the top of a great hill in hell, but for a sound this strong, I'm willing to go back down to the bottom again.",,8.2,
The Lousy Dance,Simon Joyner,by: Steven Byrd,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ba2fea9e61561daa717f/1:1/w_160/be66bd1b.gif,1999-10-19 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4305-the-lousy-dance/,AtavisticTruckstopAtavisticTruckstop,"Simon Joyner is that rarest of things in the world of modern popular music. He's a singer, songwriter, poet and artist. Oh, and he's also a damned fine Leonard Cohen impersonator. Okay, that last part's not true, and it's probably a bit unfair, too-- Simon Joyner is no one's clone. (I just wanted to get my crass, hackneyed comparisons out of the way as early as possible before I started in with my crass, hackneyed flattery.) However, if Joyner is not Leonard Cohen's clone, he's at least Cohen's musical descendant. Joyner carries high the torch that songwriters such as Cohen, Nick Drake and all the other pasty- faced, sad little boys have lit with their own moody, gothic songwriting. And, if what I've heard on Joyner's latest release, the subtle, stylish ode to depression known as The Lousy Dance, holds out for another album or two, Joyner may have some heat of his own to add to that sad, slow- flickering flame. When taken from beginning to end, The Lousy Dance comes across more like a novel, an opera or some other grand- scale piece of art than just another pop record. Pulling in an orchestra of instruments-- everything from the electric guitar to the trombone to the steel guitar to the flugelhorn (which, up until this album, I never really thought existed... it's always been the Bigfoot of musical instruments for me)-- the very musical scope of the album is grand. As we pass through these eight lengthy tracks, Joyner crafts story after story that carries the listener through bad relationships, sad lives, lonely lovers and dark, rainy street corners. With lyrics that could hold their own against some great musical poets, Joyner picks apart his subjects with a verbal cleverness and eye for detail that has been lacking in recent generations of music. In his lines, he captures emotions like other people catch butterflies. Then, he spreads their wings, looks at their colors to determine what species they are, and lets them go. Laying a solid yet emotionally- charged soundtrack to these stories, Joyner's music stays consistent in both sound and quality from track to track. It's a country- tingled, bluesy groove that's too slow to be rock and too complex to be country or blues. Mix that with orchestral flourishes, the occasional squeal of a horn section, a lick from an acoustic guitar, and that tried- and- true sad song instrument, the piano, and you get the idea. Luckily, Joyner's skilled enough with arrangements to blend all these sounds together seamlessly, creating one immaculately produced, immaculately beautiful album. Granted, this is a much more personal and soulful sound than is probably fashionable right now. But The Lousy Dance is a perfect example of an album that was written for the songwriter than for the faceless, anonymous listening public. However, the merit of this introspective and lonesome album is that Joyner is able to express his fears and heartaches so eloquently that the personal becomes the public. His issues start to matter, as they reflect our own issues, with the music and lyrics morphing into some strange universal language that we can all understand. In your best friend, this level of melodrama would be irritating as hell, but on an album as masterful as The Lousy Dance, this tension is brilliant, seducing the listener, playing up to their sympathies and fears, and dragging them into the dark, cold lives of these songs. In a nutshell, Simon Joyner is a true man of talent who has managed to make an album that feels genuinely haunted. But, shameless praise aside, if you're a technical perfectionist, there are a few instances on The Lousy Dance-- not many, but a few-- that will have you driving pencils into your ears as Joyner's voice warbles like a see-saw. Joyner's voice tends to crack and fail, forever on the edge of breaking, with the heavy suffering and sweeping emotion of the recently dumped. On any album full of ballads, it's hard to make any one track stand out above the other. The songs will usually bleed together in a fragrant, violet- colored ocean that's more likely to put you to sleep than grab your attention. But here, once again, Joyner proves his talent by avoiding even this, the most heinous, ball- smashing, cliched trap a sad album can stumble into. Although it seems at first that the soft melodies and lightly sung vocals of The Lousy Dance would be great for lulling even the fussiest of babies to Sleepy-Land, Joyner's creative songwriting and vivid lyrics keep your mind buzzing. It's that level of intelligence and creativity that keeps this record from being just another sappy album. It's also Joyner's raw charisma, combined with his talent and the naked, unarmored emotion of his songs that will hopefully snag him the critical and economic success he clearly deserves. And maybe that'll cheer him up, but for the listener's sake, let's hope not.","Simon Joyner is that rarest of things in the world of modern popular music. He's a singer, songwriter, poet ...

BBC Sessions,Cocteau Twins,by: Kristin Sage Rockermann,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a117b1335d7bf1698187/1:1/w_160/263e8f79.jpg,1999-10-12 05:00:06,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1523-bbc-sessions/,RykoRyko,"Main entry: twomb

4. a house, chamber, or vault that is intended for the dead but is instead filled with moody synths Twombs got me through college. As the hours before essay deadlines slipped away, things would become more clear. You can call it an epiphany or you can call it a gimmick, but Edgar Allan Poe's ""Fall of the House of Usher"" is like a tomb. It is also like a womb. You could write it as ""(t/w)omb"" and be beaten until you bleed all over your properly marked edition of ""Derrida's of Grammatology."" Or you could call it a twomb. As in, ""that's pretty twomby."" Here's an example of the word ""twomby"" in a sentence: This week's ""very special episode"" of ""Dawson's Creek"" was twomby as all hell. The Cocteau Twins? Dark, damp waves of warm nostalgia wash over cushions of gently layered synthesizers. It's familiar somehow, but over-produced into something usually described as otherworldly or ethereal. The Cocteau Twins are the perfect example of twomb-rock. Twins are together in the womb. And the Cocteau Twins were also womb to the development of a new generation of independent rock, including groups such as Dead Can Dance and Pale Saints. The two-disc compilation of live BBC Sessions recorded between 1982-1996? You got it-- buried alive! Trapped and kicking to get out, in a twomb with a drum machine! Let's go through the contents of this twomb. There are 30 versions of 28 songs spanning two discs. Yes! There are two versions of ""Hitherto"" and ""Musette and Drums."" The record is largely devoted to Garlands-era early work and to BBC recordings of songs from their mediocre 1996 release, Milk and Kisses, with a few songs from Treasure and Head Over Heels sprinkled about. This leaves a significant portion of their 15 year career unrepresented-- specifically, material from Blue Bell Knoll and Heaven or Las Vegas. This conspicuous absence prevents the album from serving as a retrospective or greatest hits compilation. Instead, it can be categorized as either an inadequate introduction to the band, or as one more morsel for completists. From the FAQ in the ""Cocteau Twins Café:"" Q: Why such an odd track listing for the BBC Sessions Double CD? A: The selections for this double album may seem a bit sporadic, there is a big chunk of their musical career missing for one good reasox8A.it's just BBC Sessions!"" From the FAQ in the ""Pitchfork Café:"" Q: Why would anyone decide to release ""just the BBC Sessions,"" which leave out the stronger period of Cocteau Twins' work? A: They're milking it! As Neil Diamond once told us, ""Money walks, but it don't sing and dance and it don't talk."" That's BBC Sessions' bottom line-- it's one more release issued by the floundering U.S. label Rykodisc (and Simon Raymonde's own Bella Union imprint in the U.K.) that will be sold and bought and maybe sold again. Although these BBC Sessions hold a certain amount of economic potential, this compilation is not only too long for such a quirky track listing, but the Cocteaus' strength is not their live performance. Fussy production provides the suspension of disbelief that entering the Cocteaus' twomb properly deserves. In a live setting, their studio aesthetic of densely-layered shimmering dissolves and sugar-coated textured noise becomes washed out sentiment lacking in urgency. Although BBC Sessions contains a few inspired performances such as the 1983 version of ""Hitherto,"" and an unusual if slightly grating cover of Billie Holiday's ""Strange Fruit,"" for the most part, it isn't. This compilation may just be a ploy to fund a private school education for the daughter of Liz Fraser and Spiritualized's Damon Reece, but that doesn't mean certain fans won't find pleasure in these slightly more course versions of classic Cocteau Twins tracks. For the uninitiated or casual Cocteau fan, though, Heaven or Las Vegas, Treasure, and Blue Bell Knoll are twombs that should certainly be explored first.","Main entry: twomb

Black on Both Sides,Mos Def,by: Andrew Goldman,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c3c913d197565213bde9/1:1/w_160/1640c900.gif,1999-10-12 05:00:05,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5440-black-on-both-sides/,Rawkus,"Any record being released with a moderate amount of hype will almost invariably owe its success to one of three things: 1. Recklessly irresponsible critics whose ideas of ""good"" and ""bad"" have been irreparably damaged by years of exposure to loads and loads of shitty music. 2. Slimy publicist types that aren't afraid to trade a little fellatio for a winning review. 3. The protecting hand of Yahweh. This goes a long way toward explaining the large majority of popular culture. But every once in a while, an album will make its way through reviewer after reviewer, deservedly earning absurdly high marks with nary a scratch. Such is the story with hip-hop's messiah of '99, Mos Def, and his solo debut, Black on Both Sides. But, in a sea of lousy, burnt-out critics, why should you believe me? For starters, nobody serviced me to write this. Not since the emergence of A Tribe Called Quest and Q-Tip (who makes a brief guest appearance here on Mr. Nigga"") has hip-hop seen an MC as intelligent, as lyrically proficient, and as baby-butt smooth as Mos Def. If you heard Def's previous outings with Black Star, you probably saw this coming. If you didn't, it's clearly time to put Ol' Dirty on that shelf reserved for insane, materialist misogynists, and repent. With artists like this finally getting the respect they deserve, we could be entering a new era of hip-hop. Think about it. When was the last time you heard an MC drop a line like, ""Mind over matter and soul before flesh""? When was the last time you heard somebody rap about the global economic and environmental consequences of first-world corporate waste and subsequent aquatic pollution? When was the last time you heard a hip-hopper sing competently over a phat-ass beat about the white appropriation of black art forms? Or end a song appropriately with a Bad Brains-influenced rockout, where both the drums and bass are played by the same guy? Mos Def. The man does it all-- addressing serious socio-political issues while remaining positive and affirmative from start to finish. Inspiring, no? The current state of punk and independent rock could stand to learn a thing or two from this man. True, Black on Both Sides isn't flawless. If you don't like Tribe-style laidback beats, you may have a more difficult time getting into this. Mos Def's singing on tracks like ""Climb"" and ""Umi Says"" is a bit hard to stomach, too. And then there's the matter of his sporadic introductory speeches, which occasionally sound like the pseudo-prophetic ramblings of a guy who might benefit from one less hit from the bong. But this, honestly, is nit-picking. Because when the beat drops and Def starts spitting his meticulously- crafted lyrics, you realize it's entirely possible that he truly is prophetic-- that he was meant to be kicking the rhymes, and that we were meant to listen.","Any record being released with a moderate amount of hype will almost invariably owe its success to one of three ...

While other tracks on Beaucoup Fish are scared to really come out and be loud and proud for fear of becoming a ""Born Slippy"" rallying call, ""King of Snake"" certainly draws from that former greatness. Underworld have force-fed the bass loop from Donna Summer's ""I Feel Love"" beaucoup angel dust, and let the frenzied beast loose in a room of shrieking ghouls, led by Karl Hyde who whips them up into further delirium by shouting ""Game boy!"" and ""Tom and Jerry!"" at them. So, it sounds daft in print-- wait until you hear Rick Smith's remix versions! On each of these singles, Smith adds his own takes. He keeps each mix short (under four minutes) and rather than just a quick edit of the album version, he's inserted voices even stranger than the wise old crone offering advise about how dangerous snake fighting can get. So, you get some plummy English lord (imagine that John Lydon had attended Eton and dropped a love dove-- that's the voice) exhorting all and sundry with, ""Hey, fellow dancer, soul fellow, one time, one time, explode mystic dove! Start feeling."" Smith periodically stops the track, creating a sort of auditory strobe effect. This effect gives his mixes even more unsettling appeal. Ashley Beedle's take on ""Save Our Discos"" sticks closer to the original and, as you would expect from a member of the Ballistic Brothers and the X-Press 2 project, he's bigged up the piano vamps and made the track that much more housey. Fatboy Slim really surprised me with his mix. Far from being some pop-dance cack, he's really thought about the song's structure and then gone ahead anyway, so shredding the bassline that it's barely recognizable. Fats has selected the Dionysiac delirium drum pattern from his library of percussion before grabbing his Roland 303 and setting it to acid burn the crowd as they're hectored by the distorted specter of Karl Hyde chanting the familiar slogans. This is the mix you're going to hear in the clubs, and you'll be taken away in an ambulance afterwards, too. Top night out, then! On a different tip, but just as crucial, is Dave Clarke's technotic, filtermatic remix. Clarke's revered for his techno purity and hard bop- modelled drum programming. And all his trademarks are here, as he sweeps the track with his EQ filter to regulate the peaks and valleys and, cunningly, your synaptic responses, too. Also from the techno camp comes Slam (who are vastly underheard-- check out their kickass Headstates album and Dark Forces EP with the fine Claude Young remixes), who wrestle ""King of Snake"" to the floor and beat the royal crap out of his reptilian self. King gets right back up, dazed and hypnotic, drifting as though on the verge of unconsciousness, his eyes luridly spinning, and with a baby-munchingly evil grin on his face. You will genuflect before him. Now! As all these mixes are equally superb, I have to wonder if ""King of Snake"" is such a smoking choon that nobody-- not even that geezer from Adamski-- could screw it up. At the moment, unfortunately, these are important singles and consequently about nine dollars apiece. But I assure you, while you might find pretenders to the throne, there is only the one King of Snake.","It's their own fault, but Underworld's third album, Beaucoup Fish,\n\ was never going to possess the bodyshock ...

"Live at the Great American Music Hall, San Francisco",The Bevis Frond,by: Matt LeMay,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a2959d034d5c69bf2c29/1:1/w_160/e40c454d.gif,1999-10-12 05:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/684-live-at-the-great-american-music-hall-san-francisco/,FlydaddyFlydaddy,"The Backstreet Boys.

In such a time of need, who will free us from this prison we have created? Ugly British people. And, if the Bevis Frond's latest offering, Live at the Great American Music Hall, is any indication, judgment day is close at hand. Nick Saloman (aka the Bevis Frond), whose other credits include founder of Woronzow Records and the Ptolemaic Terrascope zine, is about as close to indie heaven as you can get-- one-man lo-fi pop music made by an actual Englishman. (Bob Pollard can try all he wants to nail that fake-ass British accent, but at the end of the day he's still a drunken hick). Flydaddy Records' website claims that Nick Saloman has been called ""the finest electric guitarist working anywhere right now."" And while that statement is of the same typically overblown nature of most bands' press releases, I'd probably have to agree with that. While Lenny Kravitz wastes his precious career spewing riffs straight out of ""Pentatonic Scales for Chronic Masturbators,"" Saloman constructs flowing, melodic guitar solos that rival those of Guided by Voices/ Gem/ Cobra Verde guitarist Doug Gillard. Whereas the Frond's two most recent LPs, Vavona Burr and North Circular, have showcased Saloman's ability to write brilliant hook-driven pop songs, Live at the Great American Music Hall showcases the band's bluesier side. Sure, the material on this album lacks the catchiness of other Frond recordings, but Saloman's immensely talented touring band creates an energy and immediacy that is virtually nonexistent on studio outings. See, Saloman is perfectly competent as a bassist and drummer, but the rhythm section on Live-- consisting of Andy Ward on drums and Adrian Shaw on bass-- gives this record a more cohesive sound than any of the Bevis Frond's other albums. Which brings us back to our original topic: ugly British people. We live in a world where Britney Spears' left tit gets more publicity than every deserving indie act combined. We are living in a world where LFO can sell millions of copies of an album that rhymes ""Hornets"" with ""Sonnets."" Our country is a fucking joke.

Back in the Early Hi-Ball Years of 1992, he was merely the frontman for the esteemed Coctails. And while making a handful of revered albums with that band, he also did time fronting the Sea and Cake, turning out three more excellent albums, albeit in a decidedly more ""post-rock"" vein. He also helped turn Sam Prekop's excellent self- titled debut into a better piece of music, adding his nimble- fingered guitar work to Prekop's subtle magic. Next thing you know, the guy's on his second solo album, headed down a path of continued greatness and recording some of the most impressive orchestral pop this side of awesome. Admittedly, after hearing Prewitt's first solo record, 1997's In the Sun, I was expecting something along the same lines. And I got it. But where In the Sun occasionally tossed up some poppier, more rhythm- based stuff (the catchy- assed hook of ""Good Man,"" the post-funk of ""Rush Hour,"" and the head- bobbing ""Work""), White Sky is a bit more mellow and autumnal. Even though the record starts with the joyous ""Raise On High,"" it stands as White Sky's most upbeat track. White Sky may be the most meloncholy and beautifully orchestrated album of Prewitt's career so far. The string section's powerful presence is one of the album's greatest assets, but more stunning is the way these pieces fit together, giving the life of stereo surround to compositions that draw inspiration from 1970s AM radio. And Prewitt must be pretty good behind the board, too, because his production work on White Sky ranks up there with Chicago's elite, Jim O'Rourke and John McEntire. In the Sun was packed with great melodies, but Prewitt was clearly less experienced at adding depth. White Sky finds Prewitt more than capable of incorporating open space and perfecting arrangements. But, as with any great album, it's the songs that make White Sky truly compelling. ""Shake"" encapsulates the unwelcome handshake of the late Autumn flu; the eight- minute ""Walking On the Farm"" begins with a sparse bassline and minimal drumbeat with occasional, brief flourishes of harmonica and electric piano before blossoming into a majestic, full- blown sadness; the gentle, hummable pop of ""Final Season"" will stick in your head like eyes; and the record's closer, ""I'll Be Waiting,"" highlights Prewitt's inescapable pop perfection with understated acoustic guitar and the sweet backing vocals of Edith Frost. Simply put, Archer Prewitt is like Nick Drake with a backbone. And if his music is praised by the future Michael Stipes of this world, he can plan on becoming the next super- cool indie rock folk hero 20 years down the line. In the meantime, he's one of Chicago's finest pop stars, and thankfully, incredibly prolific.","Archer Prewitt's years of Chicago indie rock experience have treated him well.

French Kicks EP,French Kicks,by: Andrew Goldman,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929be25eb335119a49ecffd/1:1/w_160/9b9cd5a8.gif,1999-10-05 05:00:06,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3193-french-kicks-ep/,My Pal God,"Truth be told, the 1960's were a good time for many reasons: the kids rebelled politically, the kids rebelled socially; they fought and they fucked. But somehow the social aspect took over the political, and forward motion decayed into a meaningless display of hedonism. From there, all it took was one decade of Reagan and Bush to set us right back where we started: divided, oppressed, depressed, and repressed. And it's precisely these developments that allow the urgent sexual energy of the French Kicks to come through so clearly and so necessarily right now. The French Kicks owe their sound to the Rolling Stones and to Jonathan Fire*Eater. They'll likely admit to that, and there's nothing to be ashamed of, because they sound as raw and as filled with primal desire as either of their influences. Appropriately, drummer Nick Stumpf comes from the caveman school of drumming-- he plays simple beats, and pummels the shit out of his kit. Feeling the call of the wild, Jamie Krents throws down the slow and low bass groove (and it is a groove). The duo forms the foundation on which Josh Wise and Matthew Stinchcomb whip out their raunchy-ass guitars, dueling like incensed rivals. Perhaps most importantly, the French Kicks guys are one of the few existing bands who can say that they have not one, not two, but three vocalists, often all harmonizing at the same time. The band comes across as one enamored of the spirit of punk rock, but that finds a similar infatuation with the presence of pop's best showmen. Sure, these guys are a throwback. They certainly aren't groundbreaking. But their love for the rebellion that was once inherent in rock music comes through loud and clear. The long-absent bite has been reinserted into the music, and that's worth a lot in my book.","Truth be told, the 1960's were a good time for many reasons: the kids rebelled politically, the kids rebelled ...

I'm calling it ""mellowcore."" How totally oxymoronic is that? Still, Tram isn't quite slow enough to be slowcore, and it isn't sad enough to be sadcore; it exists in that category of incredibly sincere yet slightly spaced-out bands like the Red House Painters and Damon and Naomi. Maybe it should be called ""sincerecore."" In any case, Tram is quite mellow, and very sincere. Which makes it such good make-out music for indie kids. You laugh, but I'm serious. Heavy Black Frame is the sensitive indie boy's version of Sarah McLachlan's Fumbling Towards Ecstasy. You want to show a girl how sensitive you are while still trying desperately to get in her pants? Put this on, and poof! Pants problem solved. Tram's music is soft and pretty, and has just the right amount of quavering, English-accented melancholy without getting too wretchedly depressing. Granted, it's nothing so bag-of-hammers obvious as ""And I will be the one/ To hold you down/ Kiss you so hard/ I'll take your breath away,"" but it'll do the trick. Heavy Black Frame also works well for those nights when you're drinking alone because the girl whose pants you were trying to get into won't return your calls. Sober, you might realize that Tram's songwriting is a bit slight; Heavy Black Frame begins with the exceptionally gorgeous ""Nothing Left to Say"" and proceeds down a gentle incline for the rest of the album. Every now and then, an instrumental flourish will remind you briefly of some other band-- the Mazzy Star-ish slide guitar on ""Too Scared to Sleep,"" or the oboe on ""I've Been Here Once Before"" that recalls a very, very sleepy Tortoise. When it ends, you'll feel refreshed, but you won't remember much about the album. And if you're drunk like I am, you won't give two shits either way; you'll be too busy feeling sorry for yourself and moping along to ""Reason Why."" So, what have we learned today? Here's the Cliffs Notes recap: Tram equals sincere, mellow sonic wallpaper, you're not going to get any, and I want to pork Sarah McLachlan.

Yep, they remember him for what he's contributed to society in their lifetimes-- Tin Machine, Black Tie, White Noise, the ""Cool World"" soundtrack, Outside, Earthling, and now Hours. Who'd guess that a discography that unlistenable would belong to the richest man in rock music? At this point, David Bowie has done more harm than good to his fans' cochleas. His last few albums have failed in almost every aspect, but not for a lack of trying. Outside, his 1995 ""comeback,"" was a concept album about a futuristic murder case that featured an endless stream of clichés and banal S&M; imagery in lieu of lyrics. His 1997 follow-up, Earthling, attempted mock drum-n-bass, some shoddy reggae- tinged numbers, and a universally- panned tour with Trent Reznor. Hours, of course, completes Bowie's late 90's trilogy in his usual fashion-- he's altered his sound to fit his perception of current musical trends. And as always, he's closer to getting it right than you might expect, but still way off the mark. Here, Bowie seems content to cut his losses with today's youth and reach for the older set. Hours opts for a spacy, but nonetheless adult- contemporary sound that comes across with all the vitality and energy of a rotting log. For the better part of an hour, Bowie drifts through some the most sterile and unimaginative songs since Sting released Mercury Falling. On ""Thursday's Child,"" Bowie acknowledges his issues with growing old, and possibly, his dwindling fanbase. ""Throw me tomorrow,"" he sings. ""Not that I've really got a chance."" At least he can admit it. But just six songs later, Bowie regresses into ""The Pretty Things are Going to Hell,"" an homage to his classic 1971 song ""Oh! You Pretty Things"" and Iggy and the Stooges' ""Hard to Beat (Your Pretty Face is Going to Hell)"" off Raw Power. As expected, it's not something you wanna find yourself listening to. No, it's not a new low, but that doesn't mean it's not embarrassing. David Bowie is my dad's age, whether he likes it or not, and he needs to exercise some self-restraint-- you know, like taking a deep breath when he gets the urge to pen a sequel to one of his old hits. Or counting to ten when he feels the need to put a flanger effect on the guitar track.

And if their recent self-titled album is any indication, Pinback may be ready to join the ranks of emotionally confused super-songwriters alongside Modest Mouse, Sunny Day Real Estate, and the Sea and Cake. I know what you're thinking. You're thinking, ""Great. Just what we need. Another Sunny Day rip-off."" Well, if Pinback sounded anything like any of the aforementioned bands as a whole, I would have to agree. Instead, they've snagged the better aspects of the three and mixed 'em around enough to cook up something mighty good. Any self-respecting cook knows you can't make an omelet out of a turd. Likewise, there ain't nothing wrong with picking good musical ingredients, just so long as you don't add too much of this or that. ""Tripoli,"" Pinback's opening track, starts with the kind of drum massacre you'd expect from Modest Mouse. Then the voices enter-- two of them, to be precise. Two superb, soft, vibrato-less voices, free of Isaac Brock's snarl or Jeremy Enigk's affected accent. Voices singing about death and pushing babies down spiral stairs, conveying a gut-wrenching loneliness. Voices that make this album from beautiful start to beautiful finish. Hey, they're compelling voices. In fact, they're so compelling that it becomes easy to ignore the sweet humming of minimal keyboard lines, and guitar playing that occasionally drops hints of Enigk and Prewitt. Less flatteringly, though, all the attention to the vocals may obscure the fact that the bass tone sounds about as interesting as an instructional cassette relaying Gateway motherboard jumper settings. And the guitar melodies are, in most cases, inexcusably damaged by the flat recording quality. But perhaps worst of all, these accomplished musicians (who sing, scratch, play guitar, bass, keyboards, timpani, and cello) rely on the simulated snares of a drum machine for the majority of the album. There's a sour taste in my mouth, and I think I know how it got there. Still, this album is warmly cool. It's the kind of record that radiates a sense of security while tying your shoelaces together.

The Enchirito, for those of you who only eat people food, is Taco Bell's newest snackvertising venture: it's an enchilida, basically, but Taco Bell-style. It's filled with delicious prison grade ""beef,"" covered with the edible polymer these people call ""cheese,"" and comes smothered with a kind of red chili which appears to just be mild Taco Bell sauce with some chili powder mixed in. In short, it's the best thing to enter my life in the last year, and I've been eating them by the burro-load. Now, I have some friends who become upset at the mention of the Enchirito. Here's why: the Enchirito is not actually new. It's old. It was removed from T-Bell's menu a couple years back, and some people never really recovered from the loss. When its return was announced recently, these friends of mine were pretty excited. Gleeful, really. Until they ate one. Then the griping started: ""This is not an Enchirito. I remember Enchiritos, and this is not one. I'm not sure what it is, but I'm sure it's not an Enchirito. And I'm sure I don't like it."" I haven't been able to identify with any confidence the difference between the Enchirito of Yore and the new, revised Enchirito. See, I never ate the Old Enchirito. I've only ever had a New Enchirito. But as far as I can tell, the main difference is the new version's lack of a decorative olive placed on top. Anyway, my friends think I'm crazy for loving the New Enchirito. Maybe I just love it because I don't know what I'm missing, but I love it all the same. Here's what I'm getting at: until last week, I'd never really heard the Wedding Present. My introduction to them came in the form of this singles collection which skips the first 10 years of their existence. It contains one mini-album in its entirety, and the rest of the disc is comprised exclusively of non-album tracks: stand-alone singles, b-sides, live material and compilation stuff. This disc is the New Enchirito, and I love it. For most bands-- even good bands-- a collection like this is a recipe for disaster. A band's collected odds and ends are usually uneven at best, and it seems that later work is almost always dismissed, even by (or especially by) a band's most ardent fans. This collection, on the other hand, is impressively cohesive and consistently excellent. The former is likely due to the simple fact that David Gedge doesn't mess with his formula too much: most of these songs are pretty straightforward mid-tempo rockers with the standard mix of distortion, hookiness and Gedge's distinctive vocals. The remarkable thing is that this formula is so consistently successful. ""Jet Girl"" and ""Sports Car"" serve as the record's standouts and are both prime examples of Gedge's lyrical sensibility: maudlin but barbed. There are acoustic and electric versions of both songs; each electric version is irresistible, and the acoustic versions do exactly what they should-- strip the songs down without sounding tossed off. The remaining 18 tracks are almost as great as these, and that vast expanse of music is, incredibly, devoid of any stinkers at all. Even the cover of the ""Cheers"" theme song is great. If this is a singles collection, I can't wait to see what an actual album sounds like. Old school Wedding Present fans may yell that this is not an Enchirito. I mean, what do I know? I kinda hope that's true, actually, because it'll just mean that the earlier stuff is that much better. Until I lay hands on it, though, I will continue to enjoy the New Enchirito. Mmmm, gooey.","Let's take a second to talk about the Enchirito. The Enchirito, for those of you who only eat people ...

Who amongst the sane cannot want to erase all vestige of Styx's Kilroy Was Here or fail to succumb to multiple thromboses when Genesis' Selling England by the Pound threatens to make its dismal reappearance on audiophile 24k gold CDs? If we learn anything from this closing millennium, it should be that 99.9% of all musicians should refrain from grandiose schemes of undiluted preposterousness and keep banging out three- minute garage band classics à la the Make Up. Implicit in the percentage I've given above is a recognition that 0.1% of musicians should have the freedom to push artistic forms through concepts. And techno head, Stewart Walker, is amongst that number. For in Stabiles he has constructed a high art album of sparse yet funky beats and subdued ambiance that should secure maximum rotation in Manhattan art dealers' galleries for many months. Until someone like Norman Cook rips the idea off and banalizes it. Thankfully, Walker's concept for Stabiles is simple. There's no son et lumière extravaganza depicting a world governed by malfunctioning robots, or a wry scenario about a LSD- soaked brass band led by a retired army type named after a common table condiment. No, he wished to ""write sound compositions which would be a stationary focus in the home listening environment."" And to this end, he turned to American sculptor Alexander Calder for inspiration. Calder is praised for his often immense metal sculptures that, though huge and metallic, have branches and arms that spin and weave within each other when the wind blows. In short, Calder sculpted paradoxical mobiles-- objects that look as though they weigh tons, but when a slight breeze blows, the mass evaporates and the sculpture becomes weightless, airy, hypnotic, and free. It's not a bad model for a techno artist to employ, given that the genre excels in the harsh and heavy. If you're at all familiar with the releases from Berlin's Chain Reaction label, imagine those distinctive rhythms without the softened white noise and hiss that sometimes detract from the accessibility and the elegance of the imprint. For Stabiles, Stewart Walker set up discreet loops of rhythm and let them spin on top and through each other. Occasionally, as on ""Distortion Men,"" he'll add a tiny cricket- like sound to throw the beat out of whack. At the conclusion of ""Missing Winter,"" Walker drops in an ambient section that would not be out of place on one of those majestic tape- loop collaborations between Robert Fripp and Brian Eno. Walker occasionally even hints at a melody and lures us in even further. ""Sunclipse,"" fittingly the album's closing track, combines all these tricks and is as graceful as it is avant garde. It's pretty astoundingly given the strict parameters Walker gave himself, and considering the length of the disc (just two seconds shy of an hour), that Stabiles never gets repetitive. There's always a new combination of loops to follow their meandering. If you've never seen a Calder sculpture, take it from me-- Walker's more than met his goal; he's risen to the challenge with precision, subtlety, and care. Okay, so you can't dance to it. On the other hand, Stabiles is an album every bit as beautiful as Calder's works and it costs a whole lot less to own. Now, aren't you tickled that Deep Purple didn't get there first?","If there's anything more terrifying in pop culture than the supergroup, it surely must be the\n\ concept album ...

I was separate from my fellows not because of some heinous act of villainy or a disturbed love of bus tickets. Nope, I was shunned because Nature decided to play the cruelest trick on this developing youth. Nature instructed my pituitary gland to make my nasal cartilage grow at a hyper-accelerated rate. My conk was totally out of proportion with the rest of my soon-to-be gangly self. I would never score. I sought solace in music. Like the other hormonal freaks I knew, I chose the Jesus and Mary Chain/ Joy Division axis to ally myself with. Though I must confess to splitting over to the Smiths enclave more than a few times. The brothers Reid and Ian Curtis offered me a place where I wouldn't be derided for my waywardness. The music existed because of waywardness. If Nature was cruel to me, music could, in part, alleviate the punishment. So it wasn't long before I wanted a pair of winkle-pickers instead of the sturdy Hush Puppies my parents bought for me. I wanted to wear shades like the Velvet Underground. Music took over my life. I identified. My big-eared brother did the same, a few years later-- he chose to dress like the blokes in the Fields of the Nephilim. Luke Slater would like us to believe he's been there too. Did he have a lazy eye, or a speech impediment? Maybe I'll get to ask him one day. But the music on Wireless yells out, ""I am an outsider, just like you! Wanna get skulled with me?"" And skulled you will be, having listened to Slater's dirty neuro-funk. Where his previous record, Freek Funk was comprised of shimmering tech-disco, Wireless is a dingy street corner electro session.

Fatboy Slim's hallmark breaks get a drubbing during ""Hard Knock Rock;"" and ""All Exhale"" is relentless in its pursuit of your unflinching attention. I have no doubt that each track is professionally spliced together, but Slater is excelling in styles that others have already pioneered. Slater will never be up there with Andy Weatherall, Richard D. James, Richie Hawtin, or Wolfgang Voigt while he gets by like this. Of course, maybe that's not his plan. Perhaps he's just more comfortable being an insider.","During my adolescence, I was an outsider. I was separate from my fellows not because of some heinous act of ...

Immediately we opened the book in an attempt to discern which band the author, Graeme Base, had in mind while writing the picture book. Toto and Gomez came to mind. Yet upon finishing the first page, I muttered, ""Man, this book is about The Dismemberment Plan."" As Pitchfork readers know, I like to come up with wild and crazy scenarios for record reviews. The songs from the Plan's latest record, Emergency & I, had been making love to my brain for over a year, and I wanted my review to perfectly capture my faith and prophecy for the album. Ironically, ""the worst band in the universe"" captured my sentiments perfectly. The book begins: On Planett Blipp, beyond the stars, beyond the sun and moon,
The world was ruled by music-- but tradition called the tune.
The Ancient Songs of ages past were all that could be heard,
And no one was allowed to change a single note or word. To write a new tune was heresy, to play it even worse,
And anyone who improvised was scowled upon and cursed.
For years untold the temple walls had rung to songs of yore--
Until the day a brave young groob named Sprocc rewrote the score. He took his trusty Spligtwanger, and though he knew 'twas wrong,
He cranked the volume up to ten and played a Brand New Song. The elders banish Sprocc from his planet, leaving him to wander the galaxy with his ragtag band. They stumble upon a contest for ""the worst band in the universe,"" and naturally win. As it's a children's book, Sprocc and his jamming outfit return home and establish a new order of song. Lessons are learned. Hands are held. Cue sunset, go to sleep, little babies. The Dismemberment Plan spit in the face of modern music. Perhaps their coup is more analogous to an unexpected sloppy french kiss, in terms of saliva imagery. But Emergency & I heralds a new era in rock and roll. Nothing else you own sounds like this record, yet everything you own echoes throughout. The Dismemberment Plan's chromosomes carry the superior DNA of rock's genealogy through a natural sexual affair with music, not the cold process of cloning. The perfect nucleotides of the Pixies, Talking Heads, Fugazi, and Prince spindle in beautiful double-helixes throughout these 12 tracks. Specific moments recall Gang of Four (""8\xBD Minutes"") or Radiohead (""The Jitters""), but this melange is wholly unique-- boiled down for synapse-popping flavor. Certainly some will scratch their heads, but innovation is never unanimously understood. Keyboards are enjoying a recent renaissance in rock. I believe even Snapcase tour with a Korg. But while pop groups are content to sprinkle Moog hooks or create false string sections with their Yamahas, The Dismemberment Plan squeeze alien funk and digital soul from their ebony and ivory. Deep, gurgling squirts carry ""A Life of Possibilities"" in place of bass. Mainframe bleeps add android soul to ""Memory Machine"". An overly synthesized score shifts behind ""Spider in the Snow"", mocking pop's traditional signifier for ""delicate"", yet inevitably sounding even more sincere. But the beautiful, yearning hum that hangs over ""The City"" like purple-orange sky pollution emotes more than a bruised diva-- it simultaneously aches and uplifts. The tumbling drums pleasantly propel like public transit. Frustrated guitars chime like flashes of streetlights in passing puddles. The alienation and excitement, the desolate and the bustling-- the title simply envelopes the themes. By the time Travis Morrison begins crying, ""All... I... ever... say... now... is... good... bye,"" angels are spooning out your stomach with ladles and visions of your distant past are punching you in the face. The closing track, ""Back and Forth"", grooves into brilliance. Bringing to mind Talking Heads' Remain in Light, the layers lock in bliss. Funky drums, ticking guitar, synthetic slides, and joyous keyboard hooks circle tightly like bareback thoroughbreds in Siena's Palio. This track, along with the explosive ""I Love a Magician"" and ""Girl O'Clock"", hint at new futures. Hometown fans have staged elaborate costumed breakdancing during Dismemberment Plan sets, and these songs are the hormonal fuel. The Plan rule during schizophrenic dance-punk explosions, somehow finding middle ground between Brainiac and Prince. As a testament to the Plan's power, these songs have turned D.C.'s traditionally head-bobbing concert crowds into cathartic bacchanals. Can I get an ""Amen?"" Around the time Kurt Cobain muttered ""I think I'm dumb,"" lyricists gave up. Syncopated poetry, retro theft, and extended metaphor have ruled rock lyrics since. Perhaps more importantly than their music, the Plan offer a return to intelligent, ripe, narrative songwriting. An air of despair hangs over the album, spiked with humor and passion. A definite debt is owned to hip-hop and soul, but don't think that Morrison simply barks a sequence of rhyming phrases. He ponderously spits on ""Back and Forth"": ""And faces slide by in glowing shadows like snowbound ghosts that go up and down in epileptic shivers and negative radioactive shivers in a landscape of endless dull glitter and a taste in my mouth so sweet, yet so bitter-- and we exhaust ourselves trying to get there."" Philosophy is backed up with primitive yelps like, ""Put your hands in the air,"" and the always popular ""yeah!"" Sex, death and humdrum lives are examined with alacrity. I guarantee you that if you're a twentysomething, post-collegiate human, ""Spider in the Snow"" and ""Gyroscope"" will knock you back into a couch and force a slight ""fuck"" from between your lips. At the very least, you'll hum along for the rest of your 20s. I could spend pages examining this record. Everything down to the art is stunningly unique and perfectly appropriate. Even standard guitar pop numbers like ""What Do You Want Me to Say"" hit like a high-strung Weezer. A full range of emotions-- orgasm, loss, confusion, uncertainty, resignation, rage-- ooze from The Dismemberment Plan. Paradox is woven throughout-- the alien and the nostalgic, the nascent and the classic. It's unfortunate that the term ""new wave"" is still linked to the early 80s. Bands like Jets to Brazil are unimaginatively trying to revive that new wave sound. But The Dismemberment Plan is truly, unequivocally, the new new wave. Emergency & I, fittingly, was delayed until the close of the century. (Hey, Interscope, does ""Boston Red Sox"" ring any bells?) Let's get this era over with. Please form a line behind the fellows in the sweaty button-down shirts.",,9.6,
I See a Darkness,Bonnie “Prince” Billy,by: Samir Khan,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a2a5ea9e61561daa4ac3/1:1/w_160/02fdc5e1.jpg,1999-09-30 05:00:00,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/699-i-see-a-darkness/,Palace,"Music is a wounded, corrupted, vile, halfbreed mutt that begs for attention as it scratches at your door. You let it in and give in a warm place to reside. It licks its paws and whimpers for store-bought snacks. You tolerate the fact that it shits all over your lovely Persian rugs because it seems so cute and vulnerable. It becomes your center for a while. Time passes, and it learns no new tricks. You begin to grow apart. It shuffles about in the background while you microwave your popcorn, and while you're vaguely aware of it, it seems less important to you. I'm firmly convinced that Bonnie ""Prince"" Billy's new record, I See a Darkness is not music. It doesn't register in the familiar ways of a pop record (although conceptually speaking, it is one). You can't dance to it, and... it makes you feel small. A friend of mine said this: ""I was listening to it the other day and someone called. I had to turn my stereo off. I couldn't just have it on in the background. It felt wrong."" Bonnie ""Prince"" Billy is the current moniker of Will Oldham, also known as Will Oldham. Throughout his musical life, Oldham has been churning out dark, literary dirges with help from a veritable who's-who of Important Rock and Rollers (members of Slint, the High Llamas, and Gastr del Sol). If, previous to I See a Darkness, Oldham had simply quit, he would have carved out his share of the American Gothic with his tales of death, religious reckoning, incest, and wayward horses in the cold stone of history. Even his substandard records have always had their glory moments. But here he is again, with a new name, and his consummate offering. The familiar touches are all here-- dense, ominous words and subtle flourishes of guitar, drums, bass, organs, and piano. And best of all, Oldham is perhaps the greatest of human singers, in that he sounds like a real person. There's no studio gimmickry to hide the quiver in his mostly bang-on tone. I See a Darkness is warmer than the title would have you think, and darker than the warmth of the stellar musical backdrop-- the songs feel both familiar and eerily strange. Virtually every note feels like a universe. It's the type of record that demands solitary reverence. No, this isn't music. It can't be. It's something else.","Music is a wounded, corrupted, vile, halfbreed mutt that begs for attention as it scratches at your door. You let ...

By the time 1993 came around, the scene seemed to be barely kept alive by a few gasping breaths from local artists like Willie Wisely, Polara, the Hang-Ups, Rex Daisy, Dylan Hicks, Bean Girl, Cows, and Walt Mink. And near the top of the list of hometown greats stood Arcwelder. The first record I heard by the band was 1993's classic Pull, their sophomore release, and their best record to date. Arcwelder's blend of solo Bob Mould accessibility and post-punk influences crafted unusual melodies and rhythms from some of the most memorable distortion- fueled pop riffs ever. But the follow- up to Pull didn't fare well. Xerxes was a largely hit- or- miss effort with only one or two standout tracks. And even though 1996's Entropy showed the band largely back on track-- especially on songs like ""Free Me"" and ""Snake Oil""-- they refused to broaden their horizons and failed to cover any new terrain. Everest, Arcwelder's first album in three years, is... well, another Arcwelder album. It makes sense-- these guys are getting older and probably just make albums and tour in their free time. They're probably also somewhat irritated that they're not generally embraced by younger Touch and Go fans-- that they're considered hangers- on from the Jesus Lizard, Flour, and Rifle Sport era. But it's not that Everest is a bad record at all. In fact, after a few listens, it's apparent that the songwriting is the best its been since Pull. For the most part, the snappy, Husker-ish melodies are still strong. It's the playing and the vocals that are uninspired and predictable. Realistically, Arcwelder will probably never make a record as filled with vigor and bile as Pull again. That album's a classic example of a young band's naivety working in their favor-- they were just kids; they weren't jaded yet. But even as far back as their hard- to- find debut, Jacket Made in Canada, Arcwelder's LPs have sounded very similar to this. It's your typical Morphine syndrome: recording the same album over and over again does not grant you a place in the indie rock hall of fame.","After Husker Du and the Replacements split up, Minneapolis didn't have much of a music scene to brag about ...

After their first single was released, they finally started to go out and buy equipment. Take a guess as to what kind of gear they bought-- that's right! ""Old drum machines, analogue keyboards and effects."" So far, these guys sound pretty inspired. Plone's goal, apparently, is to create instrumental electronic pop music. Hence, their concept: ""timeless electronic melodies."" They really are timeless, too, if you take that to mean you'll spend little or no time listening to them. I guess For Beginner Piano sounds nice enough, though. You've got your lilting, somber retro-future music (""Summer Plays Out""), your haunted forest music (""Press a Key""), and the incidental music for a lost level from ""Sonic the Hedgehog 2"" (""Marbles""). Sadly, Boards of Canada already beat Plone at their own game with the release of 1998's Music Has the Right to Children. On For Beginner Piano, the Plone guys just barely step over that line from being serious electronic experimentalists like the majority of their labelmates, to writing nicely-executed but predictable Sega Genesis music. No, it's not so bad if you can stay awake, but it's terribly bland. In fact, it's the new elevator music. Just wait and see if by 2010 doctor's offices aren't comforting their unhealthy visitors by playing this kind of low-volume ambient pop music over the lobby P.A. And if nothing else, I can at least guarantee one of these tracks will show up in a luxury car ad before the year's out. Like so many songs being sold to hip marketing campaigns these days, you can listen to any of For Beginner Piano's ten tracks for hours without ever noticing they're there. (I had headphones on, too.) If these guys could just pick up the pace for a moment, or put some neat effect in there, or even just change the bpms-- anything to keep me interested-- this would be a whole different record.

This would explain the glittering rayon shirts, the frosted tips lacquered with Dep, and the I- stuck- my- chin- in- a- bowl- of- graphite- powder goatees. At least Muse also know they want to be Radiohead, which would explain the enlisting of producer John Leckie from The Bends and Matthew Bellamy's falsetto- laden yelps, which sound so much like Thom Yorke they could pass as Andy Yorke. It was inevitable after OK Computer that legions of teens would attempt to emulate the irascible, uncomfortably serene, and canonized landmark. This isn't such a terrible ripple. Certainly copying genius is commendable compared to copying Urban Dance Squad. Showbiz displays all the trademark ""promising first album"" pleasures and flaws. On one hand, you get the less jaded zeal and direct songwriting. On the other hand, you get the predictable one- word titles, lack of emotional depth, and A&R; fingerprints. 50% of Radiohead consists of adult resignation and deep emotional scarring that a 19- year- old in a shiny blouse just isn't going to have experienced. After all, Muse expertly boil down Radiohead into punkish radio nuggets. Of course, that's the sentence the label will pull from this review. Terse guitar bursts, twinkling keyboard scales, and awkward bass color by numbers. But then again, despite this promise, where can they go from here? Anyone remember Geneva? Muse has to wait and see where Radiohead goes before they can follow the footsteps. Unfortunately for Muse, Radiohead have been sluggishly crapping dozens of versions of new songs in frustration for months while they try to ""approach it like Miles Davis."" Perhaps Radiohead can start charitable donations of scrapped songs to creatively- starved bands like Muse. It's both regrettable and ideal that Showbiz comes in such banal baggage. Muse humorously continues Britain's fascination with the monosyllabic monikers and logos. The overly Photoshopped (and terrible) artwork leaves a cold gloss. These flags will ward off stridently ""indie"" audiences from what is a pretty punchy, tight record. Coupled with Travis, Muse can satiate the rabid Radiohead junkie until LP #4. Yet once that record takes flight, all the Muses of the world will become studio musicians and schoolteachers. This is the circle of life. But does this matter for the music? Yes.

Grandaddy have become darlings of the British press, that cruel lover. We must love them more. Grandaddy could easily drum up stateside affection with their new EP, Signal to Snow Ratio. A brief burst of infectious ideas, while sometimes specious, the EP packs as many subtle effects and pleasurable references that seem possible before bursting the po-mo bubble in its 13 minutes. Maybe it's just the beards, but Grandaddy insouciantly pull off this lo-fi pastiche material with apparent reverence and minimal irony. Beards strangely instill a sense of sincerity in artists. Would Doug Martsch get away with his muppety voice if he looked like... say, Jon Spencer? Similarly, the Beta Band carry an air of sylvan devotion thanks to unchecked face follicles. Even hardcore bands have picked up on this simple formula: beards = intense cred. Bonus points for neck beards. Well, Grandaddy have the hooks to back up the beards. ""Hand Crank Transmitter"" rambles along like a folky Flaming Lips, complete with psychedelic speed- strum solos and twinkling keys. Robotic vocoder voices lazily mumble over hissing cymbal samples and synthetic strings in ""Jeddy 3's Poem."" The upbeat, fuzz- bass driven ""MGM Grand"" bounces along with cheesy Styx sounds over Pavement riffs. ""Protected from the Rain"" opens like a homemade Who rock opera before melting into a tender piano ballad. Yet it's impossible to disassociate Grandaddy from their mentors-- Built To Spill, the Flaming Lips, and Pavement. Is there an echo in Pitchfork's cavernous archive of indie pop? I've gotten Carpal Tunnel just from typing ""Built to Spill"" so damn many times. Even worse, it's impossible to get past the name Grandaddy! Come on, Grandaddy?!

When the song became a monsterous club hit, it almost seemed as if the folk duo saw dollar signs. Suddenly, we were hit with Walking Wounded, the first Everything But the Girl full- length to be comprised entirely of smooth, soulful electronic music. Sadly, their formula didn't work on a grand scale basis. It's not that it was a bad concept-- actually, it could have worked out quite nicely. The problem is, the jungle- style percussion is rarely varied, and when you've been hearing the same speedy breakbeat four times a measure for upwards of five minutes, it comes out sounding stilted, uninspired and sterile. Despite extreme advances in the sound of electronic music in the three years since Walking Wounded was released, Temperamental sticks with the same sound Everything But the Girl offered up in 1996. The stuff probably still works as well as Walking Wounded on the dance floor at the local sportsbar, but for casual listening, it's incapable of holding interest. The thing about this band is that they're not a bad band-- they work fine as an updated version of Sade. Their problem is, they're just so average. I mean, songs like ""Hatfield 1980,"" ""Downhill Racer,"" the album's standout, ""Lullaby of Clubland,"" and the closing track, ""The Future of the Future (Stay Gold),"" a collaboration with EBTG- contemporaries Deep Dish, could work as singles.

I'm going to sell everything I own, save for a stereo and a copy of the Radar Bros.' eponymous album, and buy a tiny uninhabited island in the South Pacific. And I'm going to go there and lie naked on the beach and listen to the album on infinite repeat as I slowly disintegrate into a pile of sunburned ash. Then again, it's kind of difficult to be bored and jaded when you're dead. And as the Radar Bros. have probably realized by now, the edge of the abyss can sometimes afford a breathtaking view, but the balancing act can get a little wearying. That's why it's a bit of a relief that The Singing Hatchet takes a step or two back from that edge; its comfortable numbness is no longer as melodramatic as wistfully sighed lines like ""silver letter opener / in the shower / with the scrubber,"" but it still plays like a soundtrack to a tranquilizer overdose. The Radar Bros. play the type of slowcore that's the diurnal opposite of Low-- while the latter is best listened to at night, the former is best listened to during the day. Instead of gothic, reverb-drenched murkiness, we get crisp, unadorned guitars strumming slowly alongside low-level keyboard hums and frontman Jim Putnam's fragile, exhausted vocals. The band has stuck pretty closely to this formula throughout its existence, producing music of remarkably consistent quality, although not a whole lot of melodic variety. The songs on The Singing Hatchet, like the Bros.' past releases, blur into each other until the whole thing feels like one long, slow ache without much change in tempo or tone. But every now and then, a little production flourish emerges from the haze of the album to perfectly capture the Radar Bros.' languorous vision, like the fluttering sample on ""To Be Free Again,"" the slide-guitar coda of ""Find The Hour,"" or the gently crackling static in the background of ""Tar The Roofs."" And there are at least two songs, ""Shifty Lies"" and ""Shoveling Sons,"" which are pure bliss from start to end; to hear them one more time might just be reason enough to stay alive a little while longer.

The press release opens with a claim that should not be made about anyone who is not Radiohead: ""Snow Patrol are the most exciting guitar band in the U.K."" When I hear that Thom Yorke blew his nose recently, it sends bolts of electricity down my spine. This is true of a great many people. Snow Patrol's PR should know this. My personal favorite error in this press kit is in reference to new Snow Patrol recruit Tom Simpson, who spins and plays keyboards at their live shows. It speaks of the ""recent edition of Tom"" rather than the recent addition of Tom. To be fair, maybe they did upgrade from Tom 3.1 to Tom 2000 recently. But probably not. Thankfully, the prodigious musical ability of these three Irishmen propels them past the inauspicious first impression given by their press kit. Songs for Polarbears is an impressive piece of work, made doubly so when it's considered that this is only a debut. This fact is easily forgotten while wandering through the sheer breadth of mature songwriting featured on this album, to the tune of 19 full-length songs. Snow Patrol craft very British, very smooth, very coherent guitar-based music which runs the gamut from slow, serene melodies to token sentimental ballads to ""please, kind sir, don't give me a wedgie"" driving rock. No song has been as overtly British as the ironically titled ""NYC"" in some time. The track comes complete with the quasi-nonsensical repeated chorus lyric, ""I am so too,"" which follows its quasi-agitating repeated verse lyric, ""Is this on?"" But it all works, somehow. Snow Patrol seem to have an early death grip on many of the finer musical elements which seem to completely elude many other groups: the subtle, floating chorus in ""The Last Shot Ringing in My Ears;"" the witty, yet not juvenile song title in ""Get Balsamic Vinegar... Quick You Fool;"" the sing-along chorus that compliments a fast car and a sunny day perfectly in ""Downhill from Here;"" the brawl-inducing ""Holy Cow;"" even the hummed chorus in ""Velocity Girl."" The only miss on the album is ""Absolute Gravity,"" with its incongruous turntable action, provided by none other than the recent edition of Tom. So do we blame Snow Patrol for not being Radiohead? Of course not. Instead, we revel in the multifarious distorted guitar splendor offered on Songs for Polarbears and chide naughty record companies who let Ted from the mail room proofread their press kits. Snow Patrol are an exciting band who could deliver a magnum opus in the not-so-distant future at their current rate of improvement. Speaking of which, one more tip for the press kit makers: never again refer to the expansion of your band's fanbase as ""Viral growth."" You won't be likely to win many new converts.","If a band's press kit were any indicator of merit, Snow Patrol would be one of the lamest bands ...

The first pool of artists, either newcomers rewarded for the ingenuity inherent in merely possessing a new voice on the scene-- or elders of whom we've learned to expect little more-- tend to be judged on the merits of their output's strongest songs alone. A newcomer finding success under the lower tier, one who establishes the kind of expectations that ride the back of credibility, may find him or herself flung into the second pool, where output is judged solely on its worst moments. Simply put, reviewers, and fans in general, apply the bias of our expectations on artists. Is this fair? Perhaps not, but considering the artist is asking us to buy a second, third, or twelfth album, I suppose we deserve a good old- fashioned reason why. Ben Harper once resided among the neophytes of the first pool. An eclectic writer and musician, Harper was blessed with many crowns upon the release of his debut, the dour Welcome to the Cruel World. On the album's best tracks, he seemed rock's social conscience and the heir apparent to the fusion of soul, funk and rock championed by the likes of Jimi Hendrix and Bob Marley. We easily ignored the album's less successful moments, and rightfully so. Fight for Your Mind followed and found Harper expanding his already substantial range (the album's two best songs, ""Ground On Down"" and ""Burn One Down"" are among the best funk and reggae this decade has produced) and building on the foundation of his first release. However, the album retained some of the first's miscues, in particular, the slow- plodding ballads that seem to be a motif for the young Californian. Will to Live was, in some respects, a relief, and in others, more troublesome. Harper seemed to hone his vision, and in doing so mitigated some of the previous albums' lows. He turned towards a more straight- forward rock sound, mirroring Lenny Kravitz's shift towards center after Let Love Rule. While this transformation helped Harper produce perhaps his most consistent work to date, it also rendered the album a bit bland. Harper's eclectic vision had all but disappeared, and the album enjoyed few great revelations. That the album disappointed was perhaps the first sign that Harper had graduated into the second tier of artists-- the ones who carry our expectations as their burden. If so, then Burn to Shine may be an equally telling sign that he's not quite ready. Harper continues the trends formed on Will to Live, moving further toward simple classic rock songs and away from the hints of emotional complexity that brought him his best achievements. Though the ragtime jaunt ""Suzie Blue"" is a feign (and an unwelcome one at that), Harper plays a plainer hand here. The album's first three tracks are exasperatingly mediocre by his standards, and although his Robert Plant imitation on ""The Woman in You"" saves the song, the repetition of its chorus ad nauseam begins a trend that often isn't graced with similar rescue throughout the remainder of the album. ""Less,"" on the other hand, is a stab at heavy metal, which is all the further I choose to comment on it. But once again, Ben Harper manages to string together moments of brilliance. The trio formed by the warm- hearted raga ""Steal My Kisses,"" the rockin' title cut, and the soulful ""Show Me a Little Shame,"" are the strength of the album, and more or less carry the listener through its less- than- spectacular remainder. For better or worse, these finer moments set a higher standard for Harper. And this being the guy's fourth album, we really need more than a few great songs to make it worth the cash. Harper is an electric performer and his risky but blistering live cover of Hendrix's ""Voodoo Chile"" hints at his rightful place among today's rock musicians. Unfortunately, Burn to Shine fails to put him there.",,6.0,

Subject: Re: milli and vanilli group plays ""voltron"" in the creamy thighs thanks for dying for our sins and all. I really appreciate it. Hey, no problem. my senior year, when your statue fell off the pedestal and did a faceplant in the soft mud of perfect landscaping? How embarrasing! that new stereolab album yet? No, I haven't heard it. I never got the promo. I can't get anything from Elektra since I dissed that Flipmode Squad CD. Sorry, I'm just not feelin' Rah Digga. Anyway, I don't think I need to hear the new Stereolab. I'm pretty sure I can guess how it sounds. Granted, I am somewhat omnipotent, but I don't even need that sense to tell me the new stereolab is loaded with gurgling farfisa, monotonous xylophone loops, chiming guitar stabs, ba ba ba duh ba ba, ba duh duh ba ba, ba ba ba duh ba ba, ba duh duh ba be...

""It's not that big of an honor."" ""She hung up."" ""So how are you going to work her into the review?"" ""Well, she's be the most impatient person I know when it comes to entertainment. If she doesn't like something, she makes it known right off. She would check her watch about twenty times during a movie with dramatic sighs. She would hate the new Stereolab. I'd set the line at about 24.5 watch checks. The funny thing is, when she would check her watch during movies, I would start to feel self- conscious and embarrassed for the movie. In a way, I pity Stereolab. They seem unsure of what to do next. When you have writer's block and a fanbase, you just gotta crank, crank, crank."" [insert real review here] ""Blue Milk,"" the stultifying fourteen- minute drone which slowly spins in the middle of Cobra and Phases Group Plays Voltage in the Milky Night like a interest- sucking blackhole, brings to mind Michael Snow's 1967 ""short"" film ""Wavelength,"" in that it soars to new levels of vexation and artistic solipsism. Actually, Stereolab might take this as a compliment, since they named the first track on Dots and Loops after avant- garde filmmaker Stan Brakhage, and they evidently lounge around in plastic furniture wearing thick turtlenecks, smoking long- stemmed pipes, and debating the subtle differences between Josef Alberts' blue and yellow paintings. A slow zoom across a minimally- decorated city loft comprises the entire 45 minutes of ""Wavelength."" Set to the sound of a constant tone, which gradually increases in pitch, the zoom closes on a framed photograph of ocean waves. This is such a cheeky joke for a supposedly groundbreaking art film. The director drags the viewers through grating boredom to deliver a pun which is obvious from the first frame. Like most avant- garde art, it might have a valid statement, but it's not a process an audience needs to or wants to go through. A brief verbal description would suffice. On Voltage, their eighth LP, Stereolab sink so deep into their socialist cocktail jazz schtick that they typify this flaw. Frigid noodling, insipid harmonies, and unmemorable repetition lazily waft from yawning French- poseurs. Fractions of this soulless wankery might stimulate the academic, but when the album clocks in at nearly twice the length of ""Wavelength,"" it becomes a Herculean test of human attention. Dear Diary, Is this ever going to end? My lord. The album keeps changing styles, but it all sounds exactly the same. There's only so much twinkling vibraphone I can take. Stereolab are beyond hope. They spent more time coming up with the overwrought album title than their ""lyrics."" The saddest part is that they claim the title is called that strictly because of its length-- they needed it to run that long to ""fit into the album design."" Um... the album cover is orange atari text on brown. What a fitting analogy for everything that is wrong with Stereolab these days. The liner notes are illegible and gaudy. When a band makes a point of extensively discussing their cover art (which ends up looking last- minute and tacky, regardless) over writing quality songs, you know they've completely lost touch. Even in music, Marxism doesn't work. Yours,

Louie Anderson is Jim O'Rourke in a lighthearted cyber- tragedy. Jim travels to Japan in 2010 to visit the frozen head of Burt Bacharach. The head is kept in a museum by the docks. When Jim arrives, he finds the museum in disrepair. Burt Bacharach's head watches television from inside a jar. Jim tries lift the spirit of Burt with tales of his work. Jim loves to emulate Burt Bacharach, under the veil of structureless noise. Jim plays Burt a tape he recorded with a band called Stereolab. There are string flourishes and sweeping horns mixed to a dull matte. Burt says, ""That's great, baby, but where are the songs?"" Jim tells Burt those are the songs. Burt tells Jim that songs need a story, not beatnik freeform. Jim says that he thought Burt was a beatnik. Burt laughs. Burt tells Jim that his having lived in the sixties does not make him a beatnik. Jim cries. Burt tells Jim that he wrote songs for the radio, to make money, and doesn't quite understand art. Aliens invade Japan and Jim is forced to eat the head of Burt Bacharach. Roll credits over blooper reel.","""Okay, Brent, this is getting really old.""

Destination 2000,Love as Laughter,by: Nick Mirov,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd72c0084474cd0c2cda/1:1/w_160/18ce610c.gif,1999-09-21 05:00:06,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4880-destination-2000/,Sub PopSub Pop,"It's all too easy to disparage the ironic retro tackiness of the title and album art-- me, I can't help thinking of all the millennium marketing schemes I encountered during the last months of 1999: t-shirts and mugs emblazoned with ""01-01-00,"" ""millennium clocks"" counting down the time to the new year, etc. Did anyone actually buy any of that crap? And for those who did, what did they do with it after January 1? I envision all these t-shirts and mugs and clocks (now impotently blinking ""00:00:00"" for the remaining duration of their battery life) now taking up metric tons of landfill space. Thankfully, Destination 2000 has a slightly longer shelf life and doesn't deserve to be buried alongside the aforementioned merchandising disasters. As the title sort of implies, it's less a vision of the future as it is a document of the path Love as Laughter took to get there. With Destination 2000, Sam Jayne completes his transmogrification from scruffy indie rocker (as part of Lync) to eccentric bedroom-ridden lo-fi noisemaker (Love as Laughter's first album, The Greks Bring Gifts) to full-time rock 'n' roller. With a newly beefed-up lineup backing him, Jayne has refined the heavily classic rock-influenced sound of the band's last album, #1 USA, sharpening the songwriting considerably and the production just a little. Oh, I'm sorry, did the words ""classic rock"" scare you away? Fear not, 'cause Love as Laughter gets their raw blues-based riffs the way Hendrix and the Stones originally envisioned it. Just slather on a few layers of MC5-style garage-rock distortion and let Jayne's analog- reverbed wail blow the whole sound up to stadium size, and you've got the slack boogie of ""On the Run."" Elsewhere on the album, the band mixes their rock riffage in with some new-wave accouterments; ""Stakes Avenue"" features stiff, chunky rhythms and vocoder effects that burst into sweeping big-rock choruses. Love as Laughter also try on a few other genres, with varying results; ""Stay Out of Jail"" pushes grunge-punk adrenaline through crummy, overdriven amps borrowed from Mudhoney and Nirvana, and ""Margaritas"" is a welcome return to their shambling pop roots. But there's also the obligatory sloppy country hoedown (""Statuette"") and the obligatory stark acoustic track (""Demon Contacts""), both of which seem out of place on Destination 2000. Surprisingly, though, Love as Laughter fits right in with the rash of rawk-band signings over at Sub Pop (the Hellacopters, Zen Guerrilla, Murder City Devils, Gluecifer, Nebula, etc.), but Destination 2000 is more than just a series of three-chord head-bashers; it's a vibrant re-creation of lo-fi rock 'n' roll that feels genuine, unforced, and thankfully free of nostalgic excesses and pouty posing. Sometimes, it's necessary to take a backwards glance at the past to get a feel for the future.","It's all too easy to disparage the ironic retro tackiness of the title and album art-- me, I can ...

I'll Take Care of You,Mark Lanegan,by: Neil Lieberman,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc9b13d197565213b375/1:1/w_160/cef7875b.gif,1999-09-21 05:00:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4676-ill-take-care-of-you/,Sub PopSub Pop,"For his cover of Eddie Floyd's 1969 single ""Consider Me,"" former Screaming Trees frontman Mark Lanegan eschews the original song's doo-wop background singers and muffles the plush horn section that bears its Stax/Volt pedigree. He leans his gravelly groan on the chorus' lead in (""You're gonna need a man/ A man who'll understand""), lending urgency and a smoky mystery to this otherwise fairly pedestrian refrain. Why does the woman in this song need so much understanding? Why is her need so dire? What has she done to cause the abandonment of her friends? There's a creeping darkness in Lanegan's voice here-- something not apparent in the jumpy R&B; of the original. It's the realization of a transgression unimaginable at the time of the track's original release. By the time Lanegan gets around to crooning the song's plaintive chorus, we're left wondering if his ostracized subject really has any choice but to accept his offer. By slightly tweaking its connotation, Lanegan transports the song into a context of his own making. It's this context, carried across the 11 covers on I'll Take Care of You, that allows the album's unique success. Compared to standard cover songs, where there's almost always an obvious disconnect between the song and the band, Lanegan makes these songs his own. See, this is a collection of songs that are of the same origin and landscape as Lanegan's previous works-- a landscape recognizable as the stark, tortured midnight soul of his previous three solo affairs. And while molding classics-- like O.V. Wright's gospel testimony ""On Jesus' Program"" or the traditional ""Little Sadie""-- into this landscape may not seem like a stretch, placing them seamlessly alongside the Gun Club's ""Carry Home"" and the Leaving Trains' ""Creeping Coastline of Lights"" definitely is. Superficially, I'll Take Care of You isn't much of an achievement for Lanegan. After all, he didn't write any of these songs, and he doesn't explore much new sonic territory. It's the type of album artists generally release to fulfill a contract or take a breather. But examined closely, it's much more than that. Because in this collection, Lanegan's managed to tug on the timeless threads that hold the patchwork of American music together. And that's certainly something to consider.","For his cover of Eddie Floyd's 1969 single ""Consider Me,"" former Screaming Trees frontman Mark Lanegan eschews the original ...

Something to Write Home About,The Get Up Kids,by: Brent DiCrescenzo,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bf10eb335119a49ed173/1:1/w_160/a4d0bf36.gif,1999-09-21 05:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3430-something-to-write-home-about/,Vagrant,"The cover depicts slumberous robots snuggling on a sofa, presumably watching banal television. Perhaps they're sluggishly digesting a Biggie Meal in a fast- food booth. A mechanized cupid hovers over their shoulders. Hues of gray and pastel depict the scene with high school strokes. It's fitting, since the music contained within merely cranks the greaseless gears of insipid, mind- numbingly uninspired, adolescent pop, bringing humanity a few inches closer to self- wrought destruction through resignation. When did pop become the Attention Deficit Disorder of rock music? These days, parents and teachers quickly diagnose students with A.D.D., when 90% of the time they're simply lazy, drug- hazed, or stupid. It's an insult to the children who truly suffer from A.D.D. Similarly, being ""pop"" has granted bands the luxury of not trying. And society merely throws record deals and Ritalin at the problem. Really, what qualifies as pop? Anything. If something is released to the general public and is theoretically consumable, it's pop. No longer will the excuse, ""Oh, but it's just pop,"" be accepted. Erase that hate-mail. Hamburger Helper is pop. My sneaker from Target is pop. A Sprite jingle is pop. A coin- dispensed rubber glow- in- the- dark bouncing ball shaped like an alien head is pop. Naturally, I can't justly criticize anyone for indulging in pop without being hypocritical. But look around-- we're suspended in a homogenous gel of pop. Pop is free. You don't need to spend $12.99 on an R.D.A. of pop. Turn on the radio. Tune to any station marketed towards white people between the ages of 12 and 27. You're going to hear a song that can easily be substituted for any track off Something to Write Home About. Is it so much to ask for a shred of originality in music? A frustrated ""Wrragh!"" from the singer, or an unexpected car alarm would at least trigger a central nervous system response in the listener. The Get Up Kids write from assumption, not passion. Each song is about missing, wanting, or needing a girl who is typically ""a world away."" I'd like to get into the impossibilities and improbabilities of two people actually being ""a world away,"" but I'll let the obviously empty cliché fight for itself. I'd rather focus on meaningless lyrics masquerading as poetic insight, such as ""I smuggle myself into new nationalities."" One can not smuggle oneself, excepting by stowing away in an antique schooner-- and those don't exist anymore. Further, a ""nationality,"" which is an adjective or notion of self set by political boundaries, is not a physical object which can accept smuggled cargo. These flaws would be easier to swallow if delivered with soul or conviction. Instead we're left with the nasal whining of another pompadoured youth who recently received his degree from the Bratty School of Caucasian Nostril Singing, along with his classmates, the Guy from Lit, the Guy from Smash Mouth, the Guy from Blink 182, and the Guy from Showoff. The implementation of keyboards and acoustic guitars is predictable and unimpressive. Tinkling keys behind styrofoam riffs attempt to ""mature"" the sound. Instead, the clinical production scrubs the rock down to a smooth grain of clear sand which wedges unreachable into the crotch. Only after a repetitive process that borders on ""brainwashing"" can the melodies even began to tunnel into your brain like a chigger. The Get Up Kids quickly point to the large record deals they turned down to ""stay independent."" Most labels urged the band to re-record ""Don't Hate Me"" from the band's debut. So the Kids ""kept it real"" and recorded an entire album of songs which follow the same formula, yet never reach the quasi- memorable qualities of a radio hit. Yet, a merchandise catalog falls out of Something to Write Home About upon opening. The band's decision to not sign with a major just makes them seem financially inept in addition to their musical shortcoming. You guys, just sell out! Independent music does not need you. Pick out those leather pants and jump into the mill.","The cover depicts slumberous robots snuggling on a sofa, presumably watching banal television.\n\ Perhaps they're sluggishly digesting a ...

Song,Lullaby for the Working Class,by: Neil Lieberman,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd93ea9e61561daa7728/1:1/w_160/083a2b19.gif,1999-09-21 05:00:03,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4910-song/,Bar/NoneBar/None,"Suppose I started writing about a turtle crossing a hot, desert highway. Suppose I wrote in great and excruciating detail of the turtle's slow journey, describing each deliberate motion in real time as you read on in search of my thoughts on Lullaby for the Working Class' third album, Song. Maybe I'd slow continue on about the turtle's journey across the highway-- about how cars of varying makes and models (which I also would describe to you, along with the conditions of their paint jobs and their drivers) zoomed past it, you would eventually grow bored and tired, clicking over to the Pitchfork news page to find out once and for all whether or not Pavement actually broke up. Now imagine sitting next to me on the bus. I'm telling you a story about my fourth birthday. A half an hour has passed and you've already learned of the grand party thrown for me by my parents. You've learned of the clown that scared children as clowns inevitably do, and of the large cake upon which ""Happy Birthday, Neil"" was written in icing. Now, if you're of right mind, you're shooting out the door at the next stop, or perhaps even jumping out the window as the bus slows for a turn. In either of the above cases, you might notice the care with which I tell my story, recognizing certain beautiful episodes. You'd notice the sensitivity with which I wrote of the truck driver who swerves to hit the turtle, or the sublime beauty of a drunken clown's gift to a boy on the anniversary of the kid's birth. But in the end, you'd be bored. Neither of these tales are particularly compelling in and of themselves, and told slowly in terrible detail, they only become bogged in their own pointlessness. Lullaby for the Working Class' Song is the sound of that bogging. About a year ago, I wrote on this website of Chris Whitley's guitar stylings, noting his incredible ability to elicit more sound out of a single guitar than many full bands can coax from their instruments. That statement holds true when talking about Lullaby. Eleven people play on the album's first track, ""Expand, Contract,"" and after untold listening, all eleven fail to even dent my consciousness. Sure, the band's nearly symphonic arrangements are pretty, but here they function only to their own ineffective end. Without individually compelling songs to add support, the arrangements are details without a storyline. Unfortunately, a reverse paradigm operates throughout the album. The songs seem to serve merely as skeletons for the band's arrangements, creating the ultimate irony of the album's title. A secondary irony exists in the album's structure, which both begins and ends with long droning buzzes that serve as the album's only attention- grabbing moments. But guys, why limit yourself to just the working class? The rich could sleep to this just as well.","Suppose I started writing about a turtle crossing a hot, desert highway.

The Fragile,Nine Inch Nails,by: Brent DiCrescenzo,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c3feeb335119a49ed84a/1:1/w_160/3c93e23f.gif,1999-09-21 05:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5799-the-fragile/,InterscopeNothing,"1:00am: I've gathered my supplies and I'm going to sit this one straight through. Trent's going to keep me up for at least another two hours with his latest bloated indulgence, The Fragile. So I've got a pot of coffee. It's black. Pitch black. As black as your fucking soul! And I'm typing on this machine. This machine is grinding me down. I feel like a fucking machine! Grrrarrrgh! 9:00pm: My first experience with The Fragile, as is the case with most new CDs, comes in my Honda. I'm sitting at a red light on Webster and Damen, waiting for a left turn. Trent Reznor is screaming, ""Tear a hole exquisite red/ Fuck the rest and stab it dead"" over a troop of industrial guitars and digital whining. I yawn with such stretching intensity that I miss my turn light. The entire situation strikes me as particularly humorous. Here I am-- a 24- year- old white guy with floppy bangs, wearing a tie, driving a Honda-- and all the bile Trent Reznor can must muster up from his supposedly scorched soul makes me yawn. Sometime over the last decade, music that is intrinsically meant to be menacing (i.e. Nine Inch Nails) has become a banal syndicated- action hour soundtrack. It's easy to imagine the overproduced grind of ""The Wretched"" blaring through a TV screen as Nightman kicks a henchman off a roof. This stuff could be the score to ""The Crow 4: In Space."" And this time around, Trent has unanimously failed to shock anyone above the age of 15 and under the age of 54. I mean, have you listened to old Judas Priest lately? Now, this is not to say music must be confrontational, although the best of it typically is. However, in a pop society that has become numb to industrial sounds through ESPN2 and Surge commercials, it's no longer interesting or tolerable to base one's entire output on volume and amplified cliches. And so ""Somewhat Damaged"" continues to pound out its same four notes. Systematically, layers of crust, fuzz, dirt, and whatever else Reznor can scrape off the walls in his studio are piled on top, pounding out the same four- note scale. 1-2-3-4. 1-2-3-4. 1-2-3-4. Ooh, wow, did he just say ""fuck?"" Trent, Holden Caulfield rubbed that out 50 years ago. 8:00pm: ""Hello?"" asks Ryan. ""Okay, I'm going to read you something,"" I say. ""Oh, hey dude. Um, sure."" ""'She shines/ In a world full of ugliness/ She matters/ When everything is meaningless.'"" ""Oh, man."" ""'Sometimes I have everything/ Yet I wish I felt something.'"" ""Are these lyrics?"" ""'Underneath it all/ We feel so small/ The Heavens fall / But still we crawl.'"" ""Haha. What is this?"" ""Pleading and/ Needing and/ Bleeding and/ Breeding and/ Feeding/ Exceeding."" ""Rhyme-y."" ""Now everything is clear/ I can erase the fear/ I can disapper."" ""Man, what is this. Is this some emo album?"" ""I am every fucking thing and just a little more/ And when I suck you off not a drop will go to waste/ It's really not so bad, you know, once you get past the taste, yeah/ Starfuckers."" ""No. Oh, no. No. It's Nine Inch Nails!"" 1:49am: ""Even Deeper,"" a track mixed by Dr. Dre, spits aluminum riffs into my headphones. The entire concept of pairing of Dr. Dre and Nine Inch Nails, a match maid in Kornboy heaven (or most likely the Interscope commissary) is laughable. Shuffling beats squirt under ""Blade Runner"" booms and fathoms of string samples. The end product sounds entirely similar to the rest of this 104- minute albatross. The token celebrity stroking of this studio marriage is fittingly overwrought, unnecessary and done with questionable intent. From the sound of it, Trent cares little to broaden his palate from this rap/ rock union. Without the liner notes, one would never pick this song as ""the Dr. Dre track."" Ironically, a man hailed by his legion of testoster- drones as ""genius"" often leans heavily on the work of other, better sound wizards. Adrian Belew, Steve Albini, and Alan Moulder conspicuously leave their fingerprints all over The Fragile. In other words, whenever something sounds cool, it's most likely coming from one of these other men, who have worked on such mind- blowing classics like Talking Heads' Remain in Light, Slint's Spiderland, and My Bloody Valentine's Loveless, respectively. The constipated drone of ""The Day the World Went Away"" unabashedly attempts to mimic My Bloody Valentine's sculpted cacophony. Unfortunately, from the hands of an unsubtle goth, the result is strained fuzz. 2:00am: Trent Reznor is the worst, most predictable, most uninspired lyricist working today. The freshman gloom spouted throughout The Fragile are only making it easier for the Goth Lyric Generators on the web. Copy the word decay from this sentence. Paste it into a Word document. Highlight it. Press Shift-F7. Every synonym that appears on your thesaurus screen pops up in Trent Renzor's pitiful poetry. Coming from the mouth of a steadily plumping, thirtysomething recluse (who, incidentally, is bearing striking resemblance to Phil Hartman's SNL Frankenstein character these days), it's just sad. Does he collect candelabras and ""Spawn"" comics? I guarantee it. In the five years it's taken to complete The Fragile, Trent seemingly watched Dark City at least 40 times. It's insulting to hear Trent and his PR firm talk up the ""radical departure"" and pop flourishes on this record because the record sounds 100% similar to Broken and The Downward Spiral. Or more accurately, it's like combining Broken and The Downward Spiral. Clever. 2:45am: The gentle piano plunking of ""La Mer"" lulls me to sleep momentarily on its second time around. It's not the gentle ambience of it, though, since this loud sludge could knock out a speed addict. The Fragile is the most taxing record I've ever had to work through in my five years of reviewing CDs. I mean, even the Beatles failed to make a double album without throwing in some filler. Why does Trent Reznor thinking he can succeed? I'm actually glad Billy Corgan used up The Infinite Sadness. Reznor would jump all over a title like that. It's difficult to decide where to even begin trimming The Fragile. It's so stunningly monotonous. Any bit of it could be lost without notice. I mean, when the instrumental interludes carry an album, it's a blaring neon sign flashing ""stay away!"" I pity the kids of the style- over- substance generation-- and yes, it will only be kids-- who enjoy this album. Kids, high school isn't as bad as it seems. You'll grow out of this phase. Save yourself, or your parents, the 25 bucks. The Fragile's length begins to make sense in this context. 104 minutes is the perfect duration for those post- dinner, pre- ""X-Files"" periods of ""nobody understands me"" bedroom isolation sit-ins. 3:00am: Before getting back into The Fragile, I peruse the liner notes and artwork. David Carson of ""Raygun"" fame laid out the artwork for The Fragile. And what a fitting look! Carson, whose design work broke new ground for typography, lost touch years ago. The originator of the 1990s' trademark ""crusty look"" is analogous to the fat- bottomed disco fonts of the '70s or the thin sans- serif of deco. But guess what? It's almost 2000 and the world needs a new look and a new sound. Carson and Reznor will forever be remembered as 1990s pop figures that helped create an identifiable logo for the decade, and little else. Trent, you are Flock of Seagulls. The Fragile embodies everything wrong with this decade-- hype, letdown, technological fetishism, empty rage, financial bloat, bombast, self- loathing, and indifference to anything truly important and interesting flowing underneath the surface. Trent Reznor is Chris Gaines. 3:20am: ""Starfuckers, Inc."" That's pretty much all I have to say in criticism of this album. That sums it right up. Do you or don't you want to own an album with a song called ""Starfuckers, Inc?"" Besides the snickering potty- mouthed title, it's one of the most blatantly hypocritical attacks ever put to tape. It's a widely- publicized attack on Marilyn Manson. There are several lyrical references to the gangly idiot such as ""I'm one of the beautiful ones"" and ""My god pouts on the cover of a magazine."" And how are these jabs delivered? Why, in a song which sounds exactly like Marilyn Manson (and also borrows from Carly Simon), by a man who pouts on the cover of Rolling Stone, Alternative Press, Spin, etc. In essence, Reznor is Marilyn Manson without the makeup (which is a bit like Kiss without the makeup). The Fragile is simply Music for 'The Elder for the digital age. I take comfort knowing that the passing of another decade will make this record seem as amusingly insincere as 10CC. And at this point, I'm angry, hungry, and frustrated. In fact, I feel like kinda like Trent Reznor. Is this the grand design? After over two hours of listening to his incessant whining and grating, I've become the very model of his audience.","1:00am: I've gathered my supplies and I'm going to sit this one straight through.

Trick Question,Caustic Resin,by: Steven Byrd,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a559b1335d7bf1698b98/1:1/w_160/50b2a157.gif,1999-09-21 05:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1357-trick-question/,AliasAlias,"For the entirety of their career, the boys in Caustic Resin have been second class citizens of the indie rock nation. Despite having played on some of Built to Spill's classic LPs, releasing four albums, and crafting some pretty damn good songs, Caustic Resin will forever remain ""the second best band in Boise"" to all but a handful of rabid Resin fans. Well, if any album were set to shake up these guys' image, it'd be their latest release, Trick Question. Sadly, though, changing your image is not necessarily the same as improving it. This time around, Caustic Resin take some serious risks by purposefully downplaying most of the elements that tie them back to their contemporary rock brethren. On Trick Question, the band has picked out a set of rules to play by with all the interest and anticipation of a person picking out their clothes for the day. Unfortunately, the musical outlines they choose to follow are the ones for psychedelic stadium rock and early heavy metal-- styles best left to the 1970's. Although you have to admire the girth of this trio's balls, the end product is blatantly forced and painfully uninspired. Throughout this album, Caustic Resin come off like a Pink Floyd cover band with Tony Iommi on guitars and The Pepsi Girl working the vocals. Heavy, leaden, cliched guitar parts are the focal point f each track, but the band's flashy licks and drawn- out solos more closely resemble the wailing of the damned than Metallica's Master of Puppets. Yet, true to the spilt nature of this album, Caustic Resin has discovered a way to take the manliest of all music instruments-- the electric guitar-- and rip out all of its muscle. In the meantime, the drumming is simply present, while the band's poor attempts as creativity-- the peppering of pianos, turntables and found sound-- are mediocre at best and laughable at worst. To add to the fun, frontman Brett Nelson's lyrics seem to have been copied straight out of a 9th grader's poetry- infected notebooks. Topping off this triple layer shitcake are Nelson's vocals. On each of the songs, no matter the tempo, tone, or subject matter, Brett finds new and inventive ways to make his voice as grating as chewing a mouthful of tin foil. I don't know what the guy was thinking when he chose to be a professional singer, but it sure as hell wasn't, ""You know, I can really sing."" Despite decent tracks like ""Nice Wings You've Got There"" and ""Road Block,"" Nelson's warble, drenched tactlessly in delay and reverb, destroys any conceivable enjoyment that would have otherwise been extractable. And songs that were bad to begin with-- like ""Slide,"" a six minute, thirty- nine second- long Soundgarden-esque dirge, become un-fucking-bearable. Trick Question just doesn't fit together, I tell ya. Not in any way, at any time. The polarized nature of the music is interesting (particularly how each song can be as dark and messy as a lump of coal, yet still manage to float lightly around the listener), but it's also stale and uninteresting. If it's meant to be a rock record, it comes off way too hazy to cut the mustard. If it's meant to be a psychedelic record, it's too dumb and heavy- handed for its own good. If it's supposed to sound like this, I don't know what to tell you.","For the entirety of their career, the boys in Caustic Resin have been second class citizens of the indie rock ...

WXBD EP,Buffalo Daughter,by: Mark Richardson,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a3e213d1975652138bb0/1:1/w_160/f9788121.gif,1999-09-21 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1004-wxbd-ep/,Grand RoyalGrand Royal,"There's so much great music coming out of Japan these days, but let's face it: Buffalo Daughter are pretty average. Though their albums sound nice and pleasingly eclectic, there's very little about them that can be described as memorable. I've listened to New Rock dozens of times and I can't name a single song aside from the infectious ""Great Five Lakes."" I'd sell it, but the swollen ranks of my local record store's Buffalo Daughter used CD rack tells me that a lot of people agree with me. There are two versions of ""Great Five Lakes"" on the new Buffalo Daughter remix EP, WXBD, and both fall far short of the insanely catchy original. Kut Masta Kurt's take does little but unwisely clip the ringing two- chord acoustic riff that makes the song so great. (You know, Kurt's beat- making skills just don't make the grade, and I have to wonder, once again, how his name seems pops up everywhere; see also Kool Keith's solo joints.) And Cornelius has a rare dull track wherein he tosses in a played- out Yes sample and calls it a day. So you wonder how, when my favorite song gets deconstructed and ruined twice, does this album still garner a 5.2? Surprisingly, there's some nice atmosphere going on elsewhere. Someone named Jopolo turns ""Sky High"" into a bubbly, underwater drone- fest, and Nardone's mix of ""Socks Drugs and Rock 'N' Roll"" strips it down into brooding downtempo. I also dig Elite Force's very technoized ""R&B; (Rhythm and Basement)"" with its churning 303 pattern, on- the- beat turntable scratching and positively booty- shaking breakdowns. And the trance- inducing vocal loop on ""Jellyfish Blues"" (remixed by Scratch Pet Land) lies atop a nice bed of digital cuddliness. Come to think of it, my favorite tunes here are the ones that feature less Buffalo Daughter and more remixer. But given the initial ingredients, I guess that makes sense.","There's so much great music coming out of Japan these days, but let's face it: Buffalo Daughter are ...

A Single History 1991-1997,Unwound,by: Camilo Arturo Leslie,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a8eeb1335d7bf16993d1/1:1/w_160/28a5df07.gif,1999-09-14 05:00:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8364-a-single-history-1991-1997/,Kill Rock Stars,"I took this long and fairly zany trip last year. Wow, good guess! It was my post-college ""oh fuck, what now"" trip. During the course of travel, my itinerary morphed into something that bore absolutely no resemblance to The Plan; I wound up spending most of my time in the Middle East, OD'ing on hummus and crapping gravy. For one senseless reason or another, I refused to rid myself of the ludicrously heavy Europe On a Shoestring book I'd so thoughtfully packed-- a book I felt like such a joke for owning when I became aware that every directionless twenty-something traveler was scripting their grand adventures by the same corny tome. Regardless, I kept it. A few weeks after coming home to Florida, I was leafing through it, reading up on countries I didn't and never intend to visit, when I came to the chapter on Iceland. I skimmed until I got to the part about what passes for Icelandic cuisine. It turns out it's a hardcore delicacy over there to eat shark meat that's been buried in gravel and left to putrefy for a few months. No joke. (Hey, champ, it's okay if you wanna rethink that Björk make-out fantasy). In a roundabout way, this brings me to Unwound's A Single History 1991-1997. But first, allow me to let you in on a little Pitchfork secret: we like to keep things fresh around here, just for you. We've noticed that releases older than a few months tend to go stale, or sprout furry and noxious fungi, or start to smell aggressively rank. Like shark carrion. Naturally, it was with trepidation that I put A Single History in the CD player with intent to review it. See, I bought this album a full year ago; as in 1999; as in before both ""Y2K bug"" and that swell Prince song fell into sad, dusty obsolescence. Before this week, I'd listened to this disc a grand total of one time the whole way through. In 1999. I must not have been particularly impressed with that first listen, seeing as how I let it sit there until, basically, today. And I really, really love Unwound. Like ""please call me if you need an organ transplant"" love. The fact their last full-length came out in early '98 causes me actual grief. But after a whole year's time, much as I dig the band, I can't say my take on this disc has changed at all. It has neither aged well a la Icelandic fish rot, nor has it really dropped in my esteem. Nope. This one's got shelf life. That isn't a compliment. The tracks on A Single History were all previously released as singles or on compilations, and the general guideline applies: if you're fiendishly into Unwound, you'll want this sort of thing in your collection. But to the unfamiliar, I say steer clear. These songs span Unwound's career, from 1991 to 1997. The earlier stuff that pre-dates Sara Lund's induction to the band is, with the exception of ""Caterpillar"" and ""Stumbling Block,"" belligerent, angst-ridden, and instantly forgettable. Pin that on original skins-man Brandt Sandeno, an energetic but mind-numbingly uninteresting drummer. The later material is a frustratingly mixed bag. First, the bright side. The lead-off track, ""Mile Me Deaf,"" was recorded around the time of Repetition, and is one more example of what makes this band incredible; it managing to balance being painfully jagged yet dancy and sing-songy at the same time. Other standout tracks include ""Mkultra,"" (New Plastic Ideas-era), ""Seen Not Heard"" (circa Fake Train), and ""Census,"" which features the same musical base later utilized on Repetition's ""Sensible."" Only here, with the addition of Dustin the Roadie's trombone, it comes off like Dixieland music from hell and/or space. The award for Best Title, Most Interesting, but also Most Irritating goes to the second-to-last track, ""The Light at the End of the Tunnel is a Train."" This is a sadistically long, super-atmospheric, effected-out, medley kind of song that aims high but never quite gets the shot off. After an endless expanse of jungle drums, things quiet down for a bit until the addition of looped samples from Repetition's ""No tech"" and New Plastic Ideas' ""All Souls Day."" Over all this, the jokesters play an answering machine message of a hippie-sounding guy rambling on about a music/mediation retreat in this horrible pseudo-ethnomusicology kind of way. You know. Just, for like, kicks. It reads funnier than it actually is, believe me. I can't say I'd rather eat decomposed fish than listen to this, but neither could I much recommend it. If you pray at the pew of Unwound and can't wait the five months until their next release, go for it. For my part, I think I might just stash this one away and check in again a year from now. Maybe it'll have gained some flavor.","I took this long and fairly zany trip last year. Wow, good guess! It was\n\ my post-college ""oh fuck ...

Merge, Warp and Matador all have spankin' new compilations to prove their roster as the most influential, the most widely respected or the most diverse around. There's no doubt that Matador has been very good to us over the years, bringing up some of the most legendary indie rock bands of the decade-- Yo La Tengo, Pavement, Guided by Voices, Chavez and Pizzicato Five. But let's not forget all the bad times we shared. Who wants to own records by bands like the Shams, Bassholes, the Toiling Midgets, or the Demolition Doll Rods? The New York label's new 10 Year anniversary package, Everything is Nice, makes for a pretty bizarre sampling. In a lot of ways, it seems like a random selection of songs that draw mostly from Matador's last five years. But perhaps there's a reason for that. What's Up Matador, a similar compilation released back in 1997, crammed 24 of the imprint's greatest moments of all time, along with 20 additional slices of rare songs onto two discs and sold it for $9.99. All the good stuff was represented. But they can't very well release the same compilation two years later. Like What's Up Matador, Everything is Nice is specially- priced-- you can usually find it for under $12. The big question is: ""Are we getting our money's worth?"" Simply put, no. Instead of getting a ton of great songs, you get a few bad songs, a few mediocre songs, and a (very) few great songs you likely already own. This is not wall- to- wall brilliance. People that should be represented here-- Liz Phair, Superchunk, Unsane, Bettie Serveert, Silkworm, Spoon, the Fall, Railroad Jerk, the Frogs, and SF Seals-- get the shaft. Instead, we're presented either with tracks from less- inspiring new signings like Non Phixion, the Wisdom of Harry, Arab Strap, and Pole, or songs off the Warp roster (for which Matador handles stateside distribution). Dude, if I want Warp stuff, why wouldn't I pick up their 10 Year Anniversary compilation? Sure, there are a couple of decent tracks mixed in just to keep you interested-- Pavement's ""Stereo,"" Yo La Tengo's ""Sugarcube,"" Unwound's ""No Tech,"" Guided by Voices' ""Official Ironman Rally Song,"" and Cornelius' ""Count Five or Six."" But, for your $12, you mainly get what amounts to two promo label samplers, and a new disc of tossed- off b-sides and live tracks. (Honestly! If, after all the extraneous Blues Explosion comps on Matador and K, there remains a Jon Spencer track that hasn't been released yet, it must be absolutely horrific.) Why drop your cash on such a sub-standard marketing ploy when you could buy Slanted and Enchanted for less?","Indie labels sure are milkin' this 10 Year Anniversary thing.

So what if the Messiah didn't turn up on the Eve of the New Millennium? What do we need some sandled beardy-weirdy for, anyway? Less than two full months into 2000, we got Primal Scream's Molotov incendiary device, Exterminator, which resurrected the emaciated, once-revolutionary specters of the Stooges and the MC5, and stomped dusted-up beats all over them. Brill! The rollover of the century also saw avant-jazz taking on electronica and offering us the hope that smooth jazz wasn't the end of the road for that great tradition. Compare Autechre's LP5 with Elliot Sharpe's Errata and you'll be gobsmacked by the similarities and the friendly rivalries. Shit, what if Jelly Roll Morton and King Oliver had had PowerBooks and CuBase rather than rusty trombones and bordello pianos? What freaky shit we'd be listening to now! What if John Coltrane...? Or Ornette Coleman...? The Cinematic Orchestra (aka J. Swinscoe) is coming from the other angle. He's a veteran electronica producer taking on jazz. And unlike Sharp's ripping up of conventions, Swinscoe's hung up on admiration. Motion is nothing less than a beat-driven tribute to Miles Davis' collaborations with third stream arranger/composer Gil Evans. Those 50's records (Sketches of Spain, Quiet Nights, Miles Ahead, for example) threw away the hard-bop rulebook and attempted to find a third path between the irreverence of jazz and the academics of the classical tradition. Davis had already expressed that interest when his nonet recorded The Birth of the Cool, but the idea was fully realized on his recordings with Gil Evans. Swinscoe obviously adores the glowing discords and the curious harmonies of ""Saeta"" (from Sketches of Spain) and he's built Motion around them. Rather than using a sampler to do all the work, he's pulled together a small band and let his drum machine contribute the beats. The opening track, ""Durian,"" incorporates a sample of Nina Simone's heart-wrenching rendition of ""Strange Fruit"" and builds the close brass harmonies to a forceful climax. ""Diabolus"" takes a different approach to the same end and closes with an almost ambient coda. However, Motion is ironically rigid. The hip-hop beats aren't sufficient to overcome Swinscoe's reverence for the tradition he cops from. Too often the flow is ponderous and self-conscious. If Swinscoe had allowed his musicians the freedom of a true blowin' session, Motion could have been a signal moment in the much-needed dialog between the electronic and jazz avant-gardes. Instead, the album simply restates the obvious, however beautifully. The revolution will not be held in a trendy coffee bar and Jesus won't return until he's sure that there's some kick-ass music down here to soundtrack his second coming and the destruction of all those whining bastards who've been bothering his poor, defenseless father for centuries.","Exciting times, these!

Pick Up,Solex,by: S.

But what about all the used discs that you know in the bottom of your heart will never be sold? The bottomless $1.99 bins would surely be an intimidating reminder of cash spent lost to pimply-faced adolescents peddling Phatfunk discs. What to do with these materially valueless artifacts? If you're Amsterdam record shop owner Elizabeth Esselink, you go through the racks, sample the best bits, and wage war with the Hitmeister. As Solex, Esselink assembles junk-pop symphonies from unwanted discs and lays distinctive Casio lines and sultry stream-of-consciousness storylines on top. But this is no dead-end process, as one might expect-- Pick Up is the second long-player of Esselink's distinctively bouncy, nonsensical songwriting, and takes several steps forward from her intriguing debut, Solex vs. the Hitmeister. Esselink's accomplished sampler orchestrations are more self-assured this time around. The title track opens with a muted trumpet and a rapidly accelerating beat before blossoming into a sing-songy assemblage of portentous horn punctuations and guitar strummage. She displays a chaotic command of rhythm in propelling her pieces forward-- every musical snatch follows its own platonic beat but somehow results in an illogically swinging lilt. By the end of ""Randy Costanza,"" for example, Esselink has managed to cram two repeating string motifs alongside a two-looped guitar chord structure, and throw a polyrhythmic shuffle in for good measure. The intrinsic tempos of each vie against the rest for cadenced domination, but the result is harmonious flow. It shouldn't work, but it does. Esselink's vocals lend cohesion to the songs, and her lyrics give you something else to wrap your head around when following the musical free-association becomes too much. With song titles like ""That's What You Get with People like That on Cruises like These..."", ""Another Tune Like 'Not Fade Away',"" and ""That'll Be $22.95,"" rest assured that her lyrical muse is as eccentric and far-reaching as her musical one. Pick Up is hearty pop fun for the detritus age. Esselink's productions are so characteristic, however, that it's difficult not to feel bogged down by the musical cut-and-paste formulae. And though she enlisted some friends to flesh out assorted tracks with original instrumental contributions, one could hardly tell. Nevertheless, Pick Up is a strong developmental achievement in the right direction for Solex, and should stand as inspiration for used record store owners the world over.","The neighborhood record store offers a necessary crutch-- a place to run with terminally unlistenable discs\n\ which one can ...

Requiem for an Almost Lady,Lee Hazlewood,by: Mark Richardson,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c08cea9e61561daa7c35/1:1/w_160/c79d8ca8.gif,1999-09-14 05:00:01,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3785-requiem-for-an-almost-lady/,Smells LikeSmells Like,"I recently packed all my shit into a rental car and moved from San Francisco to Greensboro, North Carolina. My best memory from the trip was driving between Memphis and Nashville, listening to WSM, the home of the Grand Old Opry. There's something about the production in country music from the early '50s to the early '70s. In those days, the only way to get records to sound good coming out of crappy AM radios was to thicken the reverb to the saturation point. This meant that Patsy Cline and Kitty Wells sounded like they were singing about broken hearts from the belly of a hollowed- out submarine. And that, my friends, is a lonesome sound. Lee Hazlewood, who cut his musical teeth during this time, understands this lonesome sound. Best known as the writer of Nancy Sinatra's hit ""These Boots are Made for Walkin',"" Hazlewood was an enigmatic contemporary of Phil Spector whose gift for melody and arrangement graced many a hit single in the '60s. On his own records, Hazlewood can be seen as a kind of urban cowboy- meets- Leonard Cohen figure whose thick baritone is consistently in tune and affecting. After moving to Sweden in the early 1970s, Hazlewood's records fell out of print and became much sought after by fanatical (and rich) collectors. Hearing the freshly reissued Requiem for an Almost Lady, one can see what the fuss is all about. Originally released in 1971, Requiem has a concept-- one you can probably guess from the title. To give you an idea where Hazlewood is coming from, on the liner notes he writes ""In retrospect... these songs were not written about or for one lady or two or even three... they are a composite of all my memories of ladies, since I became aware of memories and ladies..."" Cheesy? God, yes. And the between- song spoken interludes, laced with similar platitudes about life, love and loss, can be a little hard to endure initally. Still, taken as a whole, with Hazlewood's stellar production and subtle, understated arrangements (mostly just bass and guitar), the album becomes something greater. An artifact, sure-- sadly, they don't record voices like this any more, all rich and full of romantic atmosphere. But there's something else at work, a simplicity that yields a kind of grandeur. The melodies (particularly on such weepers as ""If It's Monday Morning"" and ""I'll Live Yesterdays"") show that Hazlewood fully understood the power of the 1-5 change. The words are simple storytelling in the country- folk vein-- engaging stories laced with humor and keen observation. And the chamber- tonk production adds a showman's sheen to these roadhouse blues. Dylan was plowing these same fields in the early '70s on New Morning and Nashville Skyline, but he was too confused at that point do it with Hazlewood's panache. Memories and ladies, ah yes... Lee got it right.","I recently packed all my shit into a rental car and moved from San Francisco to Greensboro, North Carolina. My ...

Spice Girls. Dang. The last hip thing we covered was Nirvana. What was cool in the '90s?"" And then the Village Voice would say, ""Well, for a while there we liked the Jon Spencer Blues Explosion, but they didn't turn out to be gay enough for our tastes."" ""Then it's settled, we'll put another PJ Harvey album on the list, and finish 'er off with Basement Jaxx."" Of course, Jon Spencer's done plenty that none of us should be proud of. Fortunately, this release of b-sides and remixes that accompany 1998's Acme is not one of those things. There are a few laugh- out- loud bits of musical comedy, like Spencer leering, ""Baby, have you ever had a hot dog?"" or listing his favorite condiments on the remix of ""Magical Colors."" Or the ""Soul Trance"" skit where the Blues Explosion headlines at a club that was supposed to feature Bel Biv Devoe. Not to mention a bit of Redd Fox- inspired smut on ""Lap Dance."" Xtra Acme USA's finest moments, though, are the brand spankin' new ones. ""Wait a Minute"" kicks the album off with Spencer coming as close to his dream of being the Rolling Stones as he's ever been. He conducts the hits like James Brown on ""Get Down Lover"" and reaffirms his rockabilly/ punk roots on ""Electricity"" and ""Hell."" Admittedly, this record's a little heavy on the filler, but there are moments here that leave the original Acme in the dust. Why didn't some of these songs make the cut? Instead of releasing two pretty good records, he could have made one great one.

With a few exceptions, their entire career has been based on taking the music of their heroes, boiling it down in a tasty pop stew, and calling it their own. Witness 1997's One Chord to Another-- the album was filled to the brim with Beatles songs written not by Lennon/ McCartney, but by Murphy/ Pentland/ Ferguson/ Scott. Sure, these songs might sound like a lot of shit you've heard before but as you listen, Sloan's affectations and flourishes materialize and you hear the band for what they really are-- not a cloying, uninspired rip-off, but an intellegent band with a sense of humor and a great ear for pop hooks. Whether it's in the Fab Four disguise of One Chord, the British shoegazer aping of their DGC debut, Smeared, or seen through the swaggering filter of their recent obsession with the '70s, these songs eventually reveal themselves as the distinct product of Sloan regardless of what disguise thay might take. It's hasn't really been that long since their last record, 1998's Navy Blues. The record took One Chord's Beatles obsession, added a few shots of Cheap Trick and a pinch of the Raspberries, and came out with one of their most affecting concoctions to date. So it only makes sense that I would be somewhat wary of Between the Bridges. The first time through, it almost seemed like they'd taken a turn down Disappointment Lane. See, instead of raiding 1970s freedom rock for ideas, Sloan seem to have grabbed a fistful of Fleetwood Mac, Todd Rundgren and, of course, the Who. The funny thing is, that despite all odds, this ends up working just as well. Now, I'm no fan of cheesy '70s pop, but when Sloan updates the sound, something clicks. My theory: at the core, the members of Sloan are Grade A songwriters. Despite the semi- ridiculous exterior, there's virtually no fluff on this album. The lyrics are (relatively) intelligent, and the songs are put together immaculately. After years of acceptance in their Canadian homeplace, Sloan are finally starting to get a good reputation in the United States among indie rock fans. But they've still got a long way to go-- at a recent Seattle appearance, the publicity for the show was so non-existent that no one heard about it until the day before it happened, causing infinite sadness among at least two Seattlites who didn't find out about it until too late (chiefly myself and my roommate). So wake up, you guys!

"Rarities, B-Sides and Slow, Sad Waltzes",Cowboy Junkies,by: Mark Richardson,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a68813d19756521391e0/1:1/w_160/16c8a9c8.gif,1999-09-12 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1639-rarities-b-sides-and-slow-sad-waltzes/,LatentLatent,"Ah, yes, I remember the release of Cowboy Junkies' breakthrough, The Trinity Sessions, well. It was the fall of my second year in college, and something about the sound of the album stuck with me. It was digitally recorded, I read later, with one microphone, in some church in Toronto. The gentle, reverberating sound of Margo Timmins' voice, and the way she purred those country tunes and that VU cover, soothed me on many a lonely, drunken night. The following year, I started reaching for Galaxie 500's On Fire for those nocturnal journeys into oblivion, but I'd still put on The Trinity Sessions now and again to marvel at the record's pervasive and utterly convincing mood-- that relentlessly lonesome sound that bridged 50's Grand Ole Opry with Lou Reed's New York. It was, we see now, an inspired record, and the way it fused genres was actually somewhat ahead of its time. I lost track of Cowboy Junkies after that. I'd hear a song of theirs occasionally, but none of them captured the atmosphere of that first record. In a few cases, as on the outstanding ""If You Were the Woman and I Was the Man,"" it seemed possible that the songwriting had improved while I was away. The odds-and-ends collection Rarities, B-Sides and Slow, Sad Waltzes confirms it: though this record contains the usual assortment of covers (it's a Cowboy Junkies trademark, and they know how to make them their own), it's Michael Timmins' originals that stand out. Margo's bro is a first-rate songwriter with an impressive mastery of traditional North American forms and a gift for melody. Though they've diversified over the years, slower songs are still what this band does best. The upbeat, almost-Stonesy ""I Saw Your Shoes"" isn't terrible, but Margo Timmins just doesn't have the vocal power to put rockers across. Fortunately, these attempts at shedding the ""wimp band"" tag are few, and we get plenty of opportunities to wallow in beautiful, spacious ballads like ""Five Room Love Story"" and ""Love's Still There"" (which, true to the album's title, is a waltz.) Of the covers, it's the unlisted, a capella version of Bruce Springsteen's ""My Father's House"" (another one from Springsteen's Nebraska) that takes the prize. Margo Timmins' voice has always sounded great unaccompanied, but here we get to hear her goofing with the band during the recording process. This is odd coming from the Cowboy Junkies, a band always perceived as humorless, but Rarities, B-Sides and Slow, Sad Waltzes shows that they may have a few surprises left.","Ah, yes, I remember the release of Cowboy Junkies' breakthrough, The Trinity Sessions, well.

69 Love Songs,The Magnetic Fields,by: Nick Mirov,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c36bea9e61561daa7ef4/1:1/w_160/a2ede6ae.jpeg,1999-09-07 05:00:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5041-69-love-songs/,Merge,"There's only one question that really needs to be asked of 69 Love Songs: is it a brilliant masterpiece or merely very, very good? The title alone is enough to send music geeks the world over into a foamy-mouthed, epileptic frenzy. 69 songs equals 3 CDs equals nearly three solid hours of new Magnetic Fields material-- think of it! That's more than some notable bands released in their entire existence. Add that to the fact that the Magnetic Fields actually followed through with their concept without turning it into the indie-pop equivalent of Lou Reed's Metal Machine Music. You see, I have this theory that music critics are suckers for novelty, and there isn't much in this world that's more novel than 69 Love Songs. It borders on being a prop in a Mark Leyner story-- it's hyperreal and excessive, yet perfectly plausible when you consider how weird reality is. Because of this, the album never feels like a ponderous, pretentious artistic statement (unlike most multi-CD releases). Stephin Merritt and company sound like they approached this ridiculously ambitious project with the most casual of airs, idly plucking melody after divine melody out of the air like low-hanging fruit from a tree. It's how pop music should sound, really: so natural and feather-light that you never notice the amount of effort that went into it. Therein lies the paradox of 69 Love Songs-- it's such a basic style of music that it's easy to dismiss it as ""just pop music."" Of course, that's what it is, so should it really deserve such high praise? Should it rank among the best albums of the 1990s? Or is it too bizarre to be considered culturally important? I mean, Abbey Road is a pretty weird album, too. Then again, Abbey Road isn't three hours long. Regardless, Stephin Merritt has proven himself as an exceptional songwriter, making quantum leaps in quality as well as quantity on 69 Love Songs. This incarnation of the band doesn't feature much of the densely layered, burbling electro-pop that they're best known for; in its stead are sparser, more acoustic songs that sound as if they're being played on actual instruments by a group of actual musicians (as opposed to Merritt himself playing mad scientist with effects racks and overdubs). It may initially seem like this stylistic decision came due to budget restrictions-- if you're recording that many songs, you can't blow too much money on any one track. But it's probably more likely that Merritt finally realized the limits of tinny synths and drum machines. On the Fields' previous outing, Get Lost, you can hear Merritt beginning to lean toward simpler, more elegant arrangements; 69 Love Songs could easily be seen as a continuation of that trend. Merritt also ensures that the listener will never get bored with any one sound, trading off vocal duties with four other singers and deploying a mind-boggling array of instruments: ukulele, banjo, accordion, cello, mandolin, piano, flute, guitars of all shapes and sizes, a dumpster full of percussion toys, and the usual setup of synths and effects. Among other things. And the songs themselves? Well, I could write a thesis dissecting each and every song on this album, but that would take months. As a prism refracts light into a spectrum of colors, 69 Love Songs not only refracts love into a spectrum of emotions, but also refracts the love song itself into a spectrum of musical forms. There's a duet between a dysfunctional Sonny and Cher (""Yeah! Oh Yeah!""), a country-gospel tune confusing religious and secular love (""Kiss Me Like You Mean It""), and an amusingly light-hearted tale of a soldier's drunken tryst (""The Night You Can't Remember""). There's giddy lust (""Let's Pretend We're Bunny Rabbits""), romantic longing (""Come Back from San Francisco""), sleazy leering (""Underwear""), and resignation and despair (""No One Will Ever Love You""). There are genre exercises such as faux-beatnik jazz (""Love is Like Jazz""), Paul Simon-ish world music (""World Love""), Gilbert and Sullivan-style mincing harpsichord (""For We are the King of the Boudoir""), Merritt's cartoony, day-glo interpretation of punk rock (""Punk Love""), Scottish folk (""Wi' Nae Wee Bairn Ye'll Me Beget""), and a brief Philip Glass tribute (""Experimental Music Love""). There are also plenty of archetypal Magnetic Fields songs, with those trademark deadpan drama-queen vocals, casually depressive lyrics, and clever rhymes. But Merritt also shows he can pen some surprisingly sincere, moving ballads (""Busby Berkeley Dreams,"" ""The Book of Love""), too. So, back to the original debate. You know that old saying about the whole being more than the sum of its parts? The sum of the parts of 69 Love Songs adds up exactly to its whole. No more, no less. Each song contains its own small epiphany, but they never quite add up to the one big sweeping epiphany that you'd hope for. That's because it's impossible to reconcile the concept of 69 Love Songs with its execution; it's simply too big. That might sound like a cop-out, but this is truly an album you can get lost in. The individual songs will inevitably distract you from a big-picture interpretation of the album. Of course, the Magnetic Fields don't concern themselves with such matters; they promised us 69 love songs, and that's what they delivered. That it's actually worth the exorbitant $35 price tag is a bonus.","There's only one question that really needs to be asked of 69 Love Songs: is it a brilliant masterpiece ...

End Time,Freakwater,by: Neil Lieberman,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929be1bc0084474cd0c2e23/1:1/w_160/c611de43.gif,1999-09-07 05:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3183-end-time/,Thrill JockeyThrill Jockey,"By all rights, when a critical assessment of this musical decade is made, the influence of country on its more popular cousin, rock, will have to be reckoned with. Sure, country- rock rambled about long before the '90s first messed its pants, and certainly the Eagles enjoyed more fame and amassed a greater fortune than any of their '90s counterparts. However, the vigor and sincerity with which this decade's cowpoke rockers mined rock's agrarian roots have paved a larger and more permanent inroad on our cultural landscape than any of country rock's forebears managed. But while innovators like Uncle Tupelo and the Jayhawks left their mark, the small movement they spawned would always remain a half length from monumental greatness, hamstrung by its incessant and narrow gaze toward the past. These days, there are still plenty of alt-country albums at your local record store, but the great ones are few and far between. Most content themselves with a comfortable pleasantness, for reasons presented as if for study on Freakwater's latest release, End Time. Before Bob Dylan hit the scene in the early '60s, authenticity mattered little to popular music and its consumers. It wasn't because music fans were satisfied by counterfeits, but rather because, amongst a dense forest of three- minute songs about drag racing, it was of little consequence whether a singer actually felt what they sang. Keepin' it real, despite it's location centered in the heart of the country movement, is still a relative newcomer to the music world. To both its credit and its detriment, the alt-country genre finds value in retaining the intangible ""feeling"" of the tradition it so zealously pursues. Here, Freakwater is a perfect example. Nearly flawlessly capturing both the sound and mood of traditional folk country, with its usually pessimistic characters, dobros and mandolins, the band successfully brings to life a collection of songs on End Time that could just as easily have been written two or three decades ago. And though Freakwater chooses a higher ground than country's usual trailer park cliché, and aspires musically to a tradition higher than the consistent drivel turned out in Nashville, the music here is country in the raw, Appalachian sense. While the band often finds success on this extremely listenable album (the opening track ""Good for Nothing"" is the shiniest gem of the bunch), Freakwater, in tune with the alt-country masses, offers nothing new here. In perfecting the authenticity of the album, they've succeeded in taking the music backward, but have failed to move it forward. The future may find Freakwater in more applicable form, but on End Time, they have little more to offer than a pleasant ride through America's backwoods.","By all rights, when a critical assessment of this musical decade is made,\n\ the influence of country on its ...

Field Studies,Quasi,by: Jeremy Schneyer,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a1c5c0084474cd0bfeb4/1:1/w_160/07a8d167.gif,1999-09-07 05:00:03,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6617-field-studies/,Up,"The thing about making a record that everybody loves is that your next album, however stylistically different or experimental, will inevitably be compared to it. So, let's just get this out of the way: Quasi's latest, Field Studies, is not as good as last year's critics' darling, Featuring ""Birds."" That album clothed frontman Sam Coomes' utterly bleak worldview in bouncy, cheery pop that made the poison go down effortlessly. And while Field Studies certainly boasts its share of infectious pop tunes, the tempos are slower, the songs are longer, and one's patience with Coomes' cynicism gradually grows thin over the course of the album. While most of the songs on Featuring ""Birds"" hesitated to venture past the three-minute mark (which was good), there are several on Field Studies that approach or cross the five-minute mark (which is bad, for them), including the album's centerpiece, ""A Fable with No Moral,"" which is over seven minutes long! Did these songs need to be this lengthy? Would their edge have been dulled if the excess chaff was trimmed off? Of course not! ""Fable"" is by far the worst offender of all the songs here-- not only is it overly long, but its execution is extremely heavy-handed and overly obvious. The track kicks off with the line, ""I went and sold my soul so I could pay my rent."" Coomes then goes on to detail his various attempts to sell his soul. If the song had been presented in a less clumsy manner, it's might come across as clever and possibly charming. But that's not the way it worked out. There are, however, plenty of songs here that live up to Coomes' and co-conspirator (read: ex-wife) Janet Weiss' previous benchmarks: ""Under a Cloud,"" ""Skeleton,"" ""Smile,"" and the opener, ""All the Same,"" ring with patented fuzzed-out Roxichord drones, and boast melodies and clever couplets that have the potential to get stuck in the ol' noggin for weeks. Also worth a mention is Weiss' sole contribution to the proceedings, ""Two by Two,"" a beautifully chilling anti-love song. This is one of those tracks that initially sounds all wrong, but soon ingratiates the listener to its peculiar charms. These songs are all definitely the equal of the best songs on Featuring ""Birds"", even if they fail to bring anything new to the table. Field Studies sees Coomes trying to develop his pop sensibility, but if you ask me, he's headed in the wrong direction. Instead of focusing on his songwriting skills and keeping the musical accompaniment stripped down, he seems to be trying to add bizarre quirks to cover up the fact that he only knows how to write one type of song. There are probably ten times more bells and whistles on Field Studies than on any previous Quasi release. Now, that's not to say that it's overproduced-- it's all tastefully done, and the sound quality is actually really nice. But this seems to have been accomplished at the expense of the integrity of the songs. I wouldn't necessarily classify Field Studies as a failed experiment because it's really too good of a record for that. But I would say that next time around, it wouldn't hurt Coomes to keep his tendencies towards bombast in check.","The thing about making a record that everybody loves is that your next album, however stylistically different or experimental, will ...

Life in a Bubble Can Be Beautiful,Red Stars Theory,by: Steven Byrd,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a2379d034d5c69bf2b49/1:1/w_160/06c311b1.gif,1999-09-07 05:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6725-life-in-a-bubble-can-be-beautiful/,Touch and GoTouch and Go,"Red Stars Theory is not a rock band, not as we feeble-minded human beings understand the term. The four lads that make up the band's core (which includes-- but is not limited to-- frontman James Bertram of 764-HERO, and Modest Mouse drummer Jeremiah Green) are more of an impersonal, all powerful force of nature than just another band. They're a nasty gang of James Bond- style evil geniuses that make their hideout in Washington (the state) and happen to spend their days making music instead of trying to take over the world. Together they could break into Fort Knox, assassinate the world leader of their choice, and generally bathe the world in the blood of their enemies. But that's not really their thing. Instead, they prefer to sit around, dress badly, forget to wash their hair and make brilliant music when they get the time. Be warned though, you're still not safe from their destructive madness. They may not be firing guided nuclear missiles at earthquake- happy fault lines or dumping anthrax into the city reservoir, but their albums will destroy you just as quickly. You see, these are not easy, passable, pleasant ditties designed to be passed off to the slackjawed masses. The smooth criminals of Red Stars Theory are artists making beautiful, insidious, moody music that kicks you in the nuts while kissing you full on the lips. At one moment, their songs are as fierce and as sharp as a dropkick to the throat; the next minute they can whisper and float as subtly as cyanide being poured into your Starbucks coffee cup-- music so good it's dangerous. Life in a Bubble Can Be Beautiful is the second full- length album from these guys, and despite having to live in the shadow of its older brother, 1997's But Sleep Came Slowly, it does not disappoint. From Sleep to Bubble, the Red Stars have managed to do something that is all but impossible in today's music scene: they've grown. In two short years, they've realized how to take a good thing and make it great. Packed with soft vocals, heavy drums, cellos, violins and fuzzy electric guitars, Bubble showcases some of the most mature and interesting songwriting modern indie rock may have to offer. In recording this album, Red Stars Theory have taken their singular form of intelligent emo-core to a whole new level. By playing up to their strengths-- namely the raw, emotionally naked power of their music and the endless sonic possibilities presented by their idiosyncratic instrumentation-- they've managed to pen eight of the best songs of their career (so far). The opening track, ""How Did This Room Get So White,"" is an atmospheric musical marathon, an instrumental clocking in somewhere around seven minutes. Don't be scared, though. I know that when an album opens with an instrumental, especially one this long, it's usually pretty bad news. These albums mostly end up being talent-free jack-off sessions created by horribly pretentious musicians. This time, of course, nothing could be further from the truth. While this particular song may count as a shameless musical jack-off session, it's packed with talent, and doesn't come off as aimless noodling. This track goes a long way towards laying the foundation for the rest of the album, both stylistically and on a more subliminal, ethereal level. ""How Did This Room Get So White"" leads into seven more epics that, despite being longer than most books I've read, are completely mesmerizing, emotional but never sappy, and intelligent but never cold. The songs that feature lyrics, like ""Combinations and Complications"" or ""An Alarm Goes Off,"" are all the more captivating, as the soft, library- whisper vocals and clever lyrics throw another level of sonic love into the mix. To make a sweet thing even sweeter, the Red Stars have also managed to overcome the one major problem that plagued their previous album-- it suffered from a staggering lack of musical variety that kept it from reaching true classic album status. Through song after song, the boys made great music, but they never strayed far from one sound. On Bubble, though, the gloves are off. Here, the band seems comfortable with taking some risks and channeling more influences and styles into their songs. The result is a fuller, richer album. Blues chords, strings solos, studio- crafted sound effects and beats that border on jungle music are all brought in to broaden the musical spectrum without diluting any of its power.","Red Stars Theory is not a rock band, not as we feeble-minded human beings understand the term.

My best friend turned thirty this week, so I helped him organize a little get- together in a vacant warehouse, which we appropriated for the evening through one of his buddies. We rented some killer audio gear: two turntables, an 850 watt- per- channel amp, and a pair of speakers the size of Midwestern suburban refrigerators. My friend brought the keg and the lawn chairs and I brought my mixer and some records. Another friend showed some stop- motion super 8 films that he'd been working on. I played the cream of my beat- oriented crop and, I have to say, I've never heard music sound so good. And then, in the wee hours, when almost everyone had gone home, we pulled out the noise music and unleashed the most wicked and intense sonic assault I've ever had the pleasure of being scared shitless by. As the terrified pigeons that called the warehouse home whirled in the rafters above, the last of us were quaking in horror at the insanely confrontational sounds. It was heaven. So that was Friday. Saturday, I had to get on with my Pitchfork review duties so I sat at home and spun Dressy Bessy's new album Pink Hearts, Yellow Moons. Not surprisingly, it's been pretty hard to get into. This cutsie indie pop, with its girl- group style vocals, sing- songy melodies, jangly guitars and sunny outlook just seems so... I don't know... inconsequential. At least the melodies are good, which is always the litmus test for indie pop, even if some of them are clearly derivative (especially ""Lookaround,"" which is so similar to ""Father and Son"" that Cat Stevens, er... I mean Yusef Islam... should certainly get a songwriting credit.) There's plenty here as far as spunky energy (like the catchy, Go-Go's- style ""Extra- Ordinary"") but there's not a hell of a lot going on in terms of inspiration. And so I spent most of my evaluation time thinking about the next album I was going to listen to. I can safely attribute indifference here to one part bad timing (it's not really right, trying to dissect cuddly Kindercore pop when I want something that screams at my soul) and one part plain old mediocrity.","Let me tell you about my weekend.

His songs are like every nice pop song you've ever heard-- memorable, nice to listen to, and, invariably, about love. His sound, on the other hand, is totally unique. The unrestrained use of cheap drum machines and old Yamaha keyboards and sequencers is stunning. So is the fact that his songs lack any organic instrumentation-- there's not a single stringed instrument to be found on his records. The House of Tomorrow is a five- track EP released back in 1992 that's just been picked up and reissued by Superchunk's glorious Merge Records out of North Carolina. Thanks to their scooping up this EP, along with the Magnetic Fields' classic Holiday, Merge now owns the band's entire catalog. So be it, then. If I had my pick of labels to own my entire back catalog, Merge would be near the top of the list. The House of Tomorrow is standard fare from Merritt; five songs, countless keyboards, a touch of reverb, and tracks as outstanding as the ones on Layne Staley's arms. The problem with Merritt's work, though, is that there's a pretty substantial amount of sameness to it. What I mean is, if you listen to a lot of Magnetic Fields records, pretty soon they all start to sound alike. Of course, it's always a pleasing listen. After all, who could get sick of love songs?","Since 1989, the Magnetic Fields' Stephin Merritt has been blending the electronic pop of Gary Numan with the lo-tech layered ...

Your Albert Camus Decapitation Day ball was a definite must-do, a glad- I've- done- it sort of affair. Beautiful, splendid time, you know.

I can't help but think that the music helped set the tone. You have absolutely fabulous taste in dignified party music. I had asked you what it was and you said it was something called ""The Wisdom of Harry"" (with a devilish smirk on your face-- shame, shame!). It was perfect-- it receded into the background, but had enough of an effect to bring on some fabulous poses. Where do you get such strange music, Miles? You know me, I am an old queen who sticks to his disco records... but I do like this new trip-hop stuff. Although this band was a bit lower rent than that big-budget stuff you used to try to push on me. Subtle, clever beats, imminently tasteful snippets of organs, neato little sound loops, touches of vinyl static... very minimal, but oddly decadent, my dear. All very understated and proper. Never so obtrusive as to offend the sultry hordes... unlike that Tori Amos thing you used to play for us. I didn't like it when there was singing, though. Sounded a bit too pimply for me, if you know what I mean. All monotones and drabness and mlah, mlah, mlah for me. A bit like those Pet Shop Boys without the range, you know... You are laughing at me now, Miles, I can tell! What an old bugger he is, he laughs... You must give me credit for caring. You don't see many men as handsome as me (or as old!) who dare to inquire about what the kiddies are listening to these days. I'm sure I'm the only one at the party who noticed... Am I right!

Paul Daley and Neil Barnes aren't the sort of losers who hang out in church halls waiting for the other members of their self-esteem classmates to arrive. Leftfield don't sup on weak tea and self-pity. Just because they don't sport bifocals patched together with duct tape, it doesn't mean we can't point our fingers at them and mutter, ""You could have been the best we ever thought there could be."" See, under a more favorable constellation, Leftfield would illuminated the firmament. For a pair who knocked around with A Man Called Adam and the Brand New Heavies, they showed initiative. They turned their backs on their mediocre beginnings, established their own Hard Hands label, and released underground dub house disco tunes (""Release the Pressure"" and ""Open Up"") that still cause floors to burn. That John Lydon ""graced"" Leftfield's incendiary ""Open Up"" with his sneering, snarling pitbull lines is proof of how important Barnes and Daley were perceived to be. When Leftfield's debut album, Leftism, finally dropped, few could honestly say it was worth the wait. After dubbing David Bowie worthy of consideration (they remixed Bowie's ""Jump They Say"") and having given William Orbit's Guerilla Records a perennial bomb with their Dubfield mix of React 2 Rhythm's ""Intoxication,"" Leftism seemed scrawny in comparison. Had ""Open Up"" and ""Release the Pressure"" not been included in its track listing, it seems unlikely that anyone would be talking about Leftfield nowadays. However, fate (or at least Sony's marketing department) had implemented a long-term strategy to establish Leftfield as the faces of techno. Barnes and Daley would be the Lennon and McCartney of the new rock and roll. But the plan failed for two reasons: (1) Underworld, and; (2) Barnes and Daley didn't pull out an album every year. It took them four years to follow up on their debut, and in that time, Underworld and others had run off with all the major prizes. Rhythm and Stealth is the quintessential ""difficult sophomore"" album. Leftfield definitely want us to recall Leftism, but they also point a defining finger into the future. Unfortunately for them (and us), artists such as Arovane, Freeform, Richard Harvey, Richie Hawtin, and Boards of Canada, to prattle off just a few, have eclipsed the duo. But the Leftfield moniker still has some currency and draw; Afrika Bambaataa gets grizzly on the electro-bass of ""Afrika Shox"" (used, predictably, in a UK television ad); Roots Manuva, the man who will save British rap, rasps and rhymes deadly on ""Dusted."" But these two memorable tracks are weighed down by ambient drool like ""El Cid"" and the watery gruel Leftfield ladle out under the title of ""Chant of a Poor Man."" And why bother with the spitball album version of ""Phat Planet"" when you can have the armor-piercing remix by Dave Clarke? Rhythm and Stealth is a case of too little too late. We're clamoring for an album that these guys can't deliver. In our overblown hopes for the salvation of rock, we chose the wrong candidates to deliver the debauchery, the rioting, and the risk that made listening to rock radio such a dirty illicit thrill. The starkly saddening thought is that there may not be anyone out there capable of making us wet ourselves with excitement.

Blush,Bows,by: Ryan Schreiber,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Founder</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a36bea9e61561daa4c8c/1:1/w_160/eab9779c.gif,1999-08-24 05:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/891-blush/,Beggars BanquetToo PureBeggars BanquetToo Pure,"At the risk of sounding like a third- rate amateur comic, I ask you: what's the deal with trip-hop? It seemed to disappear for a while after Portishead's last release. I thought it was long gone. I really did. Then Siouxie Sioux made a very mild, unwelcome and largely unnoticed comeback with the Creatures release Anima Animus. And I think Pitchfork has covered more awful trip-hop since then than we have in our entire three and a half years online. So, it's nice to finally hear a record in the genre that's actually worth listening to. Blush, the American debut from the English outfit Bows, is an incredibly orchestral affair, focused on laying down inventive, mellow beats, lush, orchestral atmospherics and gorgeous vocals. As with all good trip-hop, Bows' sound is unusally warm, utilizing rich, organic production techniques, bass- heavy kickdrums, melodic, ambient drones, and dense, full string sections. A chap by the name of Luke Sutherland is the summoner of the Bows beast. On Blush, he handles the majority of madness-- guitars (the few you hear), violins, the occasional saxophone, and lead vocals on a couple of tracks-- but also enlists a few friends to contribute their pieces. Sutherland's most frequent collaborator, angelic vocalist Ruth Emond, makes three appearances on lead vocals, and three others on background vocals. And though she's not officially a part of the group, she's one reason this record succeeds on so many levels. Emond's soft, Laetitia Sadier-ish soprano complements the wall of beauty backing her up so perfectly that it's almost surreal. On ""King Deluxe,"" she croons, ""Don't believe the hype/ That you're everything I hoped for,"" over one of the most spacious orchestras this side of Bjork's ""Isobel."" Her appearance on ""Speed Marina,"" which employs a simple harp sample that provides a mundane, vaguely Eastern mysticism, is chillingly intimate. The track, which alternates between a sparse, moody calmness and a chopped up and slowed down hip-hop drum loop, is a dark breakup song with succinct but effective lyrics. Sutherland's vocals, on the other hand, are slightly more hit- or- miss. On the album's title track, an otherwise melodic and ambient masterpiece, Sutherland's lyrics are simply too damn cheesy to enjoy. But on the almost 8- minute- long ""Girls Lips Glitter,"" his British- accented whisper is a perfect match for Emond's ghostly background harmonies. (It should also be noted that ""Girls Lips Glitter"" is the first successful fusion of ambient trip-hop and full-on drum-n-bass in history.) The only problem with Blush is that, if you've just got it on as background music, it can be a bit dull. That's largely because its mood rarely changes-- it's better suited for hot summer nights spent without electricity in Chicago (something everyone in the city should be used to at this point-- those filthy Com Ed bastards!) or on a late night car trip through midwestern forests. In short, Blush combines the trip-hop elements of Portishead's Dummy, the dream- like ambience of Brian Eno's Music for Films, and the giant tsunami of sound produced by My Bloody Valentine's Kevin Shields on their 1990 classic, Loveless. If that's not an avid endorsement, I don't know what is.","At the risk of sounding like a third- rate amateur comic, I ask you: what's the deal with trip-hop ...

Night on the Sun EP,Modest Mouse,by: D. Erik Kempke,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c37269fc7814a47cd651/1:1/w_160/4c9de829.gif,1999-08-24 05:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5357-night-on-the-sun-ep/,Up,"It seems every decade or so since the Velvet Underground, a band comes along that at once has one foot firmly rooted in tradition, and simultaneously quietly pushes ""guitar-based"" rock a little further into the future. I'm thinking of bands like Television and Pavement, though there are obviously thousands of bands one could make a case for. The thing they have in common is that they're workhorses. Their innovation comes not so much through recognized and accepted artistic statements, but through sheer effort, purpose, and determination. It's the kind of brilliance that shines through in dirty, sweaty gigs half-filled with people who don't give a shit. Modest Mouse have entered this lineage. Originally issued as an obscure Japanese EP, Up Records released this 12"" featuring outtakes from the Moon and Antarctica sessions a few months back. There are four tracks here, three of which are previously unreleased. The Moon's ""I Came as a Rat"" (curiously subtitled ""Long Walk Off a Short Dock"") appears in the same form which graces the album. Still a great song, but let's concentrate on the new stuff. ""Willful Suspension of Disbelief"" opens Side One, a product of the Mouses' newfound dreamy side. It would be rash to compare Isaac Brock to My Bloody Valentine's Kevin Shields, but there's a similar aesthetic at work in the way the layers of guitars come together. Massed vocals sigh, ""Everywhere everywhere everywhere,"" over Brock's stunningly effective poetry: ""You could keep diggin' down and down/ A thousand graves down without turnin' around without finding hell/ You find you're digging up again."" The song segues smoothly into the title track, which encapsulates the thrust of Modest Mouse's new work. They share the ability with the Velvet Underground to captivate with just two chords for 7+ minutes, as Isaac Brock's precisely delayed guitarwork bring to mind both Lou Reed and Tom Verlaine. His style has little to do with technical chops, though; the appeal rests on his ability to effortlessly probe and search around the skeletal melody. Filler as it is, ""I Came as a Rat"" seems a rather needless inclusion. However, it fits in well with the final track, ""You're the Good Things,"" a song which initially recalls ""old"" Modest Mouse, with dry production and a sing-songy melody. Yet, the track takes so many twists and turns before its conclusion that it leaves no doubt that there's no looking back for this band. The three years between The Lonesome Crowded West and The Moon and Antarctica obviously gave Modest Mouse an opportunity to prepare their ultimate statement of purpose. They've already produced an album that will serve as a line of demarcation between ""before"" and ""after"" for everything they do. One hopes that this EP will mark a return to the prolificacy of their first couple years; the only thing that could stop them now is a break from recording.","It seems every decade or so since the Velvet Underground, a band comes along that at once has one foot ...

And to make things worse, she squanders her talents by writing in Parade Magazine. (Look for her supreme intellect tucked behind the ""Howard Huge"" cartoons.) Obviously, intellect has little correlation to relevance. Which is why Momus, despite all his intents and concepts, just isn't very listenable. As an artist and satirist, Momus constantly drifts through phases, masks, and costumes. But as a musician, his music remains mired in the realm of Casio-composed chintz pop. The story behind Stars Forever is that Momus found himself in a costly legal situation thanks to a song off his last record. Said song retold the tale of transsexual synth-composer Wendy (formerly Walter) Carlos. Momus found himself in a small financial hole. Light bulbs went off above his eyepatch-wearing head: if you had about $1000 sitting around, Momus would pen a witty ditty just for you, your company, or your hipster collective. It sounds like a great idea. Unfortunately, it doesn't sound like a great album. A cloud of irrelevance and judicial waste hovers over the entire two-disc project-- two quirky pop artists bickering on the fringe of cultural significance. After all, isn't it a bit sad that a perverted keyboard bard who writes toe-tappers about ""cumming in a girl's mouth"" is being sued by a trans-gendered, avant-new-age synthesizer freak who sauces vocoded bits like ""We are in hell"" over Moog belches? God bless America/ Britain/ Japan. Another unfortunate element in the entire affair is just who shoveled up the paper to have their story in song. Some hipper- than- thou (and apparently, more- able- to- waste- a- grand- than- thou) indie rock figures have chipped in for skeptical reasons. Girlie Action, the New York public relations firm that hypes Momus' albums (among others), makes for perfect Momus fodder on their name alone. But they're a P.R. company! What do you think their motive is? Likewise, Chicago's Reckless Records represents. Reckless, a store where you likely can't find this record due to their disorganization, disregard to customer service, and general disinterest, tries to glaze up their indie cred with a song on an art-pop record. Really, how interesting will a song about a record store actually be? Other cult figures, such as Cornelius and cartoonist Jeff Koons pop up, too. But their stories just aren't as interesting as the fictional characters Momus has conjured in the past. Plus, just the general air of ""underground artist"" back-patting feels distancing. The problem here is that Momus is too rarely willing to turn on his contributors and take his typical satirical bite. Instead we get fluffy odes. Momus' greatest flaw, though, will continue to be his disrespect for pop music. His bare, robotic compositions offer few musical treats. Which is, apparantly, his point. But Momus mocks the very vehicle used to deliver his message. Thus, Momus is like the obese, filthy, sick doctor; the car mechanic in the run-down AMC Rambler; Frank Gehry with Lincoln Logs; or the sculptor with Play-Doh. Oh, and it's 39 songs of this.","Marilyn Vos Savant may have the highest recorded I.Q. in the world, but she's probably terrible in the ...

Intendo,Bis,by: Zach Hammerman,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a2c05e6ef959693204b6/1:1/w_160/4818d91d.gif,1999-08-11 06:01:40,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/725-intendo/,Grand RoyalGrand Royal,"If Manda Rin, Sci-fi Steven and John Disco (aka Bis) opened a candy shop, they'd probably stock it exclusively with bright colored, high- energy sugar goods. We're talking Nerds, Skittles, Pixy Stix, Chewy Sweetarts, and the like. Only minors would be allowed into the shop; college kids would have to be accompanied by their baby brothers and sisters. In fact, a trip to the Bis sweets shop wouldn't be much different than listening to one of their albums: an exuberant, childish, stomach ache of a sugar high-- but in a good way. This Scottish trio burst onto the American scene in 1997 with the infectious This Is Teen-C Power EP, six songs of disco- inflected, punky pop proclaiming the advent of the Teen-C Revolution. The sing- along choruses (""Kill your boyfriend/ Yeah yeah yeah!""), killer riffs and back- to- elementary school bounce gave the band instant street cred. And signing with the Beastie Boys on their coveted Grand Royal label didn't hurt, either. Unfortunately, most cool cats in the U.S. had moved on to the more ""mature"" post-rock scene by the time Bis released The New Transistor Heroes, a high- fructose long- player that showed the band spreading out in new directions with varying degrees of success. Intendo collects nine tracks of demos, b-sides and rarities recorded over the last two years, sandwiched between two cracks at the intro/ outro ""Grand Royal With Cheese."" The first proper track, ""Statement of Intent,"" makes it known that Bis aren't about to settle for Tootsie Rolls; the song is as immediate and melodic as Bis' music has ever been, but not quite as fun to sing along to as their previous call- and- response anthems. ""Clockwork Punk"" rectifies this with an addictive chorus: To all the people in the east, Clockwork Punk!!!
To all the people in the north, Clockwork Punk!!!
To all the people in the west, Clockwork Punk!!!
And all the people in the south, Clockwork Punk!!! Think Kraftwerk covering R.E.M.'s ""Stand"" and you'll have the idea. Elsewhere on the sampler you'll find Bis trying out new musical terrain. ""Famous"" and ""Automatic Freestyle"" border on ska, while ""Kid Cut"" recalls Blur at their ""Chinese Bombs"" punkiest (or for you Japanophiles, Melt Banana). The only track that falls flat is ""Cookie Cutter Kid,"" which outlasts its stay, clocking in at a whopping four minutes. In the end, sheer musical and songwriting competence sets Bis apart from other progenitors of the Teen-C Revolution such as their American counterpart, the Donnas. If you only pick up Thrill Jockey releases, this probably isn't for you. (Why are you reading this?) But for all you kiddies with sweet tooths out there, don't hesitate to snatch this up.

Come Pick Me Up,Superchunk,by: Ryan Schreiber,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Founder</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a5d65e6ef95969320bcb/1:1/w_160/e4136913.gif,1999-08-10 05:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7618-come-pick-me-up/,Merge,"There are some albums that you just can't wait for. And you wait, and you wait, and you wait... and suddenly, it's in your hands. And you think, ""Shit! Come Pick Me Up is just about to be released? It's already the end of July?!"" This depresses me. From this day forth, I vow to no longer anticipate the future and appreciate the present. I mean, it seems only yesterday I'd just gone to my first ID show (adshamedly, I admit-- the Apples in Stereo), and I'm already 23. I shouldn't get started talking about what a long, pointless road it is to the grave, and how, regardless of what questions we have about the future, the only certain thing is that all signs point to death. Yeah, I won't get started on that. After all, it's Friday! Since Monday, you've impatiently waited for today, and now it's finally here! (That's one week of your life you'll never get back.) So now that you've wasted the week lying in wait, savor the day. You haven't got much time left. Ah, mortality. Remember when you first heard Superchunk? Years ago, wasn't it? Yeah, you were just a naive little punk back in those days. For some of us it was longer ago than others. Personally, my first experience with the band was Here's Where the Strings Come In. You've probably been listening to 'em since 1990, ya indie rocker. You were into them before it was cool, man! Just a little high schooler at the time, or maybe even a junior high school if you were super-hip. Brag all you want, but where in the fuck did that time go? You're old! And if you think you feel bad, imagine being in Superchunk. I mean, it's not that seem old now-- they don't, really. But I'd venture a guess that they've passed the 30 mark. And for all their years of indie rock experience, Superchunk haven't changed their sound much since the first record. Their publishing company is called ""All the Songs Sound the Same,"" for god's sake! It's a statement that's partially true. The songs do, upon your first listen to any of their albums, sound the same. You've gotta do a little mining to uncover Mac McCaughan's crispy pop hooks. Once you spin the record a couple of times, though, the music stands out-- subtly catchy, traditional but inventive, unforgettable. Come Pick Me Up rubs off a little easier than 1997's Indoor Living-- a terrific pop record, but by no means the band's finest hour. They're playing it slightly lower key this time around, abandoning some of the full-on rock stuff for hummable laidback pop. Songs like the opening cut, ""So Convinced,"" the stunning ""Hello Hawk"" (one of Come Pick Me Up's finest), and the sublime ""Tiny Bombs"" are Superchunk at their mellowy mellowest. In fact, except for the occasional instance of severe rock thunderstorms that pop up sporadically, it's a pretty gentle affair. Sporting lovely organic production by way of Mr. Touchy (you might know him as Chicago post-rock producer Jim O'Rourke), the album contains some unexpected orchestral flourishes and rowdy mixing board-enhanced percussion. However, I'd expected more input from the sensitive little guy. I mean, for a Jim O'Rourke-produced joint, it sounds remarkably similar to the production work of past Superchunk albums. This softer, cushiony Superchunk does make a damn fine record, though. The music is decidedly more advanced and complex than in the early days, but still retains the youthful light-heartedness that makes these guys so irresistible. And McCaughan's lovable boyish falsetto may momentarily conjure memories of your young teenage days, takin' it easy at mom and dad's, wastin' time in your bedroom, drivin' around with your newly obtained license, and listening to Foolish with not a care in the world. But don't let it get you down or anything. After all, it's Friday!","There are some albums that you just can't wait for. And you wait, and you wait, and you wait ...

Girls on Dates EP,IQU,by: Mark Richardson,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c19fabf31b7dc715665c/1:1/w_160/7528072e.gif,1999-08-10 05:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4048-girls-on-dates-ep/,KK,"After a solid 7-inch, a decent full- length and now this mediocre EP, Olympia's IQU (formerly icu) are still struggling to realize their vast potential. They come closest with their live show, where magnetic frontman K.O. lays down the beats on turntables with a guitar around his neck, headphones on his head, and a lengthy cigarette dangling from his lower lip. To see him working the theramin with the neck of his guitar as he stands between a fashion- conscious girl on Moog and a spastic punk on standup bass is to see one possible permutation of the rockband of the future. But as fun as they are to dance to, IQU's compositional skills are underdeveloped, and their records inspire only passing interest. And then there's filmmaker and performance artist Miranda July. On Girls on Dates, July adds a surreal spoken word narrative to IQU's backing tracks. That's right, I said ""spoken word."" You thought it went out in the early '90s? No such luck. And while the music on Girls on Dates is rather dull, July's vocals render the tunes virtually unlistenable. Think about it: how often do you reach for those Bongwater LPs? For Chrissake, people, records should be enjoyed repeatedly, and no one wants to hear these goofy stories more than once. July's contributions are a shame, because ""Kida Co-Coma""-- a song on which IQU comes up with a cool metallic hip-hop beat and runs it through a ridiculously overstated flanger-- definitely hints at something interesting. With that groove and a gentle synthesizer line, ""Kida Co-Coma"" is somewhat reminiscent of Boards of Canada's warm electronic universe. Sadly, Miranda's lame storytelling kills it dead. The rest of the EP, consisting of three different mixes of the title track, has less good music for July to ruin. The lilting, forgettable original seems like mere ambience for July's rant, and the two stripped- down remixes (one by K.O. and one by DJ Swiggs) thankfully reduce the words to a few looped phrases. So, be sure and catch IQU when they come to town, but don't bother picking up this record.","After a solid 7-inch, a decent full- length and now this mediocre EP, Olympia's IQU (formerly icu) are still ...

I called up the CDC and they had no idea what I was talking about. True, I've only found one case of this disease, but the evidence is bold and shocking. (And don't worry-- it's not airborne.) I think it might be transmitted through a shoe boutique in Brooklyn. I think I'm going to either call the it ""Brent's Disease"" (since I discovered it, obviously) or ""Deee-Litification Disease."" Slowly, but surely, the ailment mutates its carriers into Deee-Lite. Scary, ain't it? Right now we should be quarantining the Scotch trio Bis and making sure this hideous affliction never crosses the Atlantic. (There is fear, however, that Luscious Jackson may also be infected, though it's too soon to say for sure.) The most obvious symptom is the physical metamorphosis into Deee-Lite. John Disco, the taller, lankier one, has grown his sideburns into shaggy Eastern beasts, and has taken to wearing knit ski-caps and tacky button- down shirts. Tragically, he's becoming Super DJ Dimitry. As the condition progresses, increasingly ridiculous hair growth patterns are appearing on his face. Poor Sci-Fi Steven (if that is his real name) wears his jet hair in the distinctive bowl of DJ Towa Tei. And Manda Rin, unfortunately, is experiencing the most devastating cell degeneration-- she's slowly melting into the skin- tight Lady Miss Kier-- all breasts and eyeballs, her anime head luring in boys like a sexy hydrocephalic pokemon. Next up: rainbow clothing. Yet, Deee-Litification Disease does not only manifest visibly. The symptoms can also be heard sonically, as evident on Bis' second proper LP, Social Dancing. Please submit the track ""Eurodisco"" as tissue sample A. First of all, it's called ""Eurodisco,"" sounding House-ish and/or latter- era U2-ish, neither of which is anywhere near ""good."" The song thumps along like a part- time Pet Shop Boys as echoing vocals bounce off mirrored studio walls. The melody mimics Kim Wilde's '80s hit ""You Keep Me Hanging On--"" every sound seems crafted by lasers, the run- of- the- mill ""ump-tiss"" beat rolling drearily along on cruise control. This ""groove"" flows right into ""Action and Drama,"" where Rin exclaims, ""Give me Bananarama!"" (Actually, I think they're available. It shouldn't be too difficult to arrange.) ""I'm a Slut"" and ""Shopaholic"" are the deep, introspective numbers on Social Dancing. They take obvious stances towards femininity and sexual politics, much like Deee-Lite, in a ""Is my dress too short? Deal with it!"" manner. ""Shopaholic"" laundry- lists products that Bis enjoys purchasing with captivating detai... er, no. It doesn't help that Manda Rin's voice sounds as sultry and welcome as an alarm clock at 6:48 AM. Brief respite from the screeching comes with the guest appearance of northwestern indie rock icon and Amazon.com writer Lois Maffeo-- it manages to make a K Records stalwart sound like the damn Sneaker Pimps. More evidence of the disease lies with the fact that Bis are in the midst of their ""mature"" era, much like Deee-Lite's 1994 release Dewdrops in the Garden. When Bis tries to claim punk cred on ""It's All New"" with their rallying ""glamour won't hide the truth,"" you just feel like calling them up and reminding them that they posed for New York's official teenage skater coke- head fashion catalog, Alloy. Listening to Social Dancing is remarkably similar to watching anime porn-- you have to be either somewhat disturbed or Japanese to enjoy it. Even though Bis are slowly, sadly deteriorating into Deee-Lite, they still never manage to ""spill chills on your back, with satisfaction.""

Luther was sitting in the back seat, pulling a pair of pantyhose over his head. We were idling in the parking lot of the Grub 'n' Stuff convenience store outside of Fairplay. I'm not sure why we let the car run; we were nearly out of gas. It was Luther's idea, I guess. Most stuff was. ""That's okay, dipshit,"" Luther said. ""This isn't a bank."" He had me on that one. It'd never occured to me that the science of Grub 'n' Stuff robbing might be a little less complicated than that of bank robbing. It was a marginally comforting thought. Relieved, I leaned over to turn the stereo up a bit, just as Luther threw my package of hose to the front. A corner of the cardboard envelope caught me on the temple and took a divet of skin out. Blood began oozing immediately. I yelped. ""Man, stop the horsiness and put on your mask. We don't have time for your horsing, horse."" Luther had a real way with words. As he talked, the hose stretched over his open mouth, its surface rippling with his lips. It looked like two people wrestling in a pup tent. I fumbled with the package of pantyhose, singing along under my breath as I did so. My new favorite album was playing-- The Gasoline Age by East River Pipe-- and this was my new favorite song: ""Down 42nd Street to the Light."" We got to my new favorite part of the song and I sang a little louder: ""La la la- la- la- la la la, yi yi yi- li- ya- la yi- ya."" The second time through, I nearly choked on the hose as it came down over my mouth. I could feel the blood soaking through at my temple. It was gonna hurt to take this thing off. ""What the horsey are we listening to, dipshit?"" ""It's East River Pipe. Be quiet or I'll miss my favorite part."" ""The East River Pipe, huh? What kind of music is this anyway, space- country?"" ""Luth, why do you always put 'the' in front of every damn thing? The Target, the McDonald's, the Blink 182, the Beethoven. It's, whaddyacallit..."" ""Superfluous?"" ""No. Dumb. It sounds dumb. God. Yeah, I guess it is space- country, in a way. It's bleak, but sentimental and hopeful. F.M. Cornog's voice is warm and emotive, but also a bit detatched. He used to be a homeless guy. Slept in a New Jersey train station. That's the life."" I rewound the tape to the beginning, my trembling finger skittering off the button. As the keyboard washes and gentle strumming of ""Shiny Shiny Pimpmobile"" filled the car, I tried to regulate my breathing and relax a bit. It worked a little. We were in the middle of nowhere, which I liked. It was pretty-- went with the music. Spacious. ""Luth, why don't we just fill the tank and take off? People out here keep shotguns under their counters."" ""There's just one old lady in there, dipshit, and she's asleep on her feet. Plus she's got a lazy eye-- even if she had a gun she couldn't aim it. Wouldn't hit the long side of a horsey, horse."" ""How do you know she's got a lazy eye?"" ""Cuz I saw it when I went in to buy the pantyhose. Jeez-hus, what are you so worried about?"" I thought about that for a second, holding the steering wheel and whistling along with the music. It seemed to me that the point of a road trip was to drive around listening to tapes and looking at stuff, not robbing convenience stores. Luther seemed to be missing something. ""Hey Luth, I got an idea. How 'bout you go in and take care of things? You're the expert here, right? And I'll wait out here. The getaway car, like. You say there's just one old lady there. You don't need me."" ""Y'know, diphorse, you might be onto something there. As they say. Maybe I will do that, keep your horsiness from horsing things up, that's for sure. You just wait here, like you said. I'll be right back."" Luther got out of the car, realigned his hose, and strutted towards the Grub 'n' Stuff. As soon as he disappeared into the door, I gunned it and fishtailed onto the highway. I could hear the bells tied to the Grub 'n' Stuff's door clanging behind me as I took off. ""Cybercar"" was playing, and I sang along with the coda: ""...go, go, go, go..."" Through the hose it ended up sounding like, ""Ghugh, ghugh, ghugh,"" but who gave a shit? A mile later I pulled the mask off, ripping away my fresh scab, and tossed it out the window. A mile down the road, I ran out of gas. It was good while it lasted, I guess. I opened the door and swung my legs out, planting my feet on the shoulder, and sat there for a minute bobbing my head to the slow-mo, road- rapture melancholy of ""Party Drive."" As soon as the song ended, I popped out the tape and stuck my thumb in the air.","""Luth, I don't know anything about bank robbing.""

Here's the exception, though: whereas someone like Sam Prekop might use shimmering and chiming guitars mixing Bacharach chords with shuffling jazz rhythms throughout an album, each Isotope 217 song is completely unpredictable. Totally. I mean, alright-- I know going into it that it's gonna be, at the very least, vaguely jazz- related. But that's it. It's a great thing. So, here-- let me spoil the record for you by detailing my personal take on each of the songs. Whaddaya say, eh? This'll be fun. 1. ""LUH"" (9:41) Bah-da-da! Damn, that organ's definitely doing its own thing. Well, wait... that bass is kind of doing its own thing, too. Hey, listen-- that guitar almost doesn't even hear the other instruments. Those drums sound like they're trying to soundtrack Keith Moon's death. Very early '70s Miles Davis. Sounds like the same approach as Dark Magus or Live/Evil-- spontaneous, cacophonous, and held together like two shaky hands in a nervous man's prayer. ...And then, a low rumble and an occasional random sequence of notes from a horn. Then the rumble fades, and the song rebuilds, ending itself like a remix of its first two minutes. 2. ""Audio Champion"" (3:56) Awww yeah, dude. I love this song. I said once that people will sample old Squarepusher records for rap albums in 2015, but I almost think stuff like this will be more popular. This is the most bizarre catchy melody in history. I've never heard anything so like jazz, and yet so like pop, and yet so like laidback rap... Oh. I'm afraid I've said too much. Or too little. What is this, Rocket Fuel?! 3. ""New Beyond"" (6:14) A muted... tuba of some kind? This song sounds pretty ominous. Subtle, menacing crescendos, ""You Belong to the City""- style production on the drums, a very dirty bass sound, various keyboard tones buried in the mix... It sounds like final dungeon music in an avant-garde Playstation game. Hey, what the fuck do I know? I don't exactly qualify for the MacArthur Fellowship Award. 4. ""Rest for the Wicked"" (2:15) Now, if you're like me, you want so badly for this song to be related in some way to Judas Priest. Not that I'm terribly interested in Rob Mazurek's interpretation of Hell Bent for Leather (though I wouldn't mind hearing his take on ""Turbo Lover""), but hey, it's Judas Priest. Anyway, this song is short. It kind of blends right in with the next song. A nice listen, though, even it if does stand as the only truly forgettable track on the record. I like the fade-out at the end. 5. ""Looking After Life on Mars"" (8:04) If you've been waiting to hear Isotope 217 break into a cross between Miles Davis' Sorcerer and the Heroic Doses' debut, here are eight minutes of it! This is actually one of the great tracks on Utonian Automatic. It starts out completely structured and out- of- control upbeat. The horns are all over the place, blaring out one of those trademark Isotope backwards- sounding melodies, and the guitar riff, while as basic as an Apple IIc text adventure, is so effectively penetrating that I feel like I'm watching scrambled porn. (Um...) Underneath this chunky groove lies some of the most complex percussion this side of Amon Tobin's ""Piranha Breaks."" The drumming is, simply put, live drum-n-bass. That guy's amazing. This track, in particular, makes me think of Coke. And not just because I'm trying to kick the habit-- I'm not. I mean... I don't. Which is not to say... but I mean... 6. ""Solaris"" (6:11) When I'm back in my old 'hood (Hopkins, Minnesota), cruisin' down Main Street in my convertible Geo Metro, rollin' up to the Burger King drive-thru, yo, check it out, it's real. 'Cause, bitch, I'm a playa-- big balla. Actually, I'm just some white guy who thinks I'm a big balla. In a spaghetti western. This is my soundtrack. 7. ""Real MC's"" (7:18) Definitely the album's highlight. Why they put it at the end, I'll never know. Actually, I think I do know. This song is the dream you forgot you had, that sweet slumber during sickness, floating in a suburban backyard pool on a late August afternoon, or the last breath of your life. It's the encapsulation of peace. It's so raw, I just have to cry. It's like onions, only I'd like it on a burger. A perfect track to bring the album to a close-- it's like falling onto your bed after a 12-hour marathon. And I'm not talking about ""The Real World,"" fool. Alright, maybe you have an idea of what this album can do for you. If you liked Isotope's last record, The Unstable Molecule, I might just suffice to say that this one's better.","Isotope 217 probably don't want to be lumped in with the revered Chicago post-rock scene.

Kid Marine,Robert Pollard,by: Ryan Schreiber,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Founder</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a0cc5e6ef95969320032/1:1/w_160/aa00bcd2.gif,1999-08-08 05:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6379-kid-marine/,RockathonRockathon,"So, the big news these days is that Guided By Voices have left Matador Records. Apparently, their glossy new Ric Ocasek- produced album went way over budget, and Matador wasn't too thrilled about footing the bill. The album is presently being shopped, and one of the labels they're considering is... TVT! TVT? What's up with that? TVT's home to freaky industrial artists, early Nine Inch Nails and Dee Snider's Strangeland. Please tell me where Guided By Voices fit in there. Eh, regardless, I can't wait for the finished product. In the meantime, Bob Pollard's just issued Kid Marine, his third solo outing, on the micro- indie Rockathon Records. As we all know, it doesn't take much effort to write a Robert Pollard song. In fact, I'll show you just how easy it is right this second, if you'll be my humble assistant and throw on an obscure Edgar Winter song in the background. Okay, now sing these lyrics over them: ""Wacked revolution is mexican burnout/ Margarine selection will haunt you/ Mirrored globes in shivering quasars get thrilling/ The horror is electrical establishment/ Grapple in the stronghold/ The current undermines the weak/ Daring prosecution orders twelve more to the bar/ Grainmills crumble when you sing stormy madness."" Now, repeat that, and then fade the song out. Congratulations! We've just sold a million records. Ah, but there's more to it than that and we both know it. Pollard's somehow achieved the dream of every songwriter-- to churn out countless terrific melodies day in and day out, and to be recognized by the legions of indie rock fans as a legend in his own time. (And all this with just a beat- up four- track and a six pack.) The only explanation possible would be that old Bob's got talent-- unmistakable, exciting, raw talent. But on Kid Marine, some of his trademark magic seems to be fading. It's possible he hasn't got much time left in the spotlight. Kid Marine's a Robert Pollard solo album, so it's a little more experimental (read: tossed off) than a formal Guided By Voices record. But as far as the established pattern of Pollard's records goes, it's the same as the others: there are a bunch of great songs alongside a bunch of duds. Some of the great songs on Kid Marine are the rock ballad ""The Big Make-Over,"" the reverb- drenched ""Living Upside Down,"" a nice, slow number called ""Enjoy Jerusalem,"" and the closing epic (at least, epic for a Robert Pollard song) ""Island Crimes."" Sadly, the duds on Kid Marine are, for the first time in Pollard's career, utterly abyssmal. ""Submarine Teams"" wouldn't be so bad if it didn't feature such a mind- numbingly awful vocal sample repeated to infinity, ""Men Who Create Fright"" is a throwaway experimentation with too many effects pedals, ""Television Prison"" is more torturous than almost any torture you can imagine, and ""Powerblessing"" sounds like it was recorded straight to walkman in a high school gymnasium. So, fellow Pollard fans, my advice is to use your judgement on this one. It might be in your best interest to hold off until the next Guided By Voices disc comes out. Hopefully, that one'll be better.","So, the big news these days is that Guided By Voices have left Matador Records. Apparently, their glossy new Ric ...

Speak Kindly of Your Volunteer Fire Department,Robert Pollard and Doug Gillard,by: Nick Mirov,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a0cac0084474cd0bfc60/1:1/w_160/6384c82a.gif,1999-08-08 05:00:00,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6377-speak-kindly-of-your-volunteer-fire-department/,RockathonRockathon,"Say what you want about their recorded output of late, but Guided by Voices is still a great live band. The vital essence of one of these guys' shows is its alcoholic synchronicity: the band is drunk, the audience is drunk, the soundman is drunk, and the guy who sells the t-shirts is drunk. It's easy to be awed by all that beery, convivial rock-n-roll magic. And if you're one of the hundreds of fans in the grip of a Guinness-induced haze, you might even be tempted to pick up one of Robert Pollard's solo albums from the merch table. The next day, after sobering up a bit, you put the disc in to try to recapture the magic you felt the night before. Of course, it doesn't really work, because now you're sober. Pollard's not though-- he's drunk and throwing up all over your carpet. Somehow, it seems less fun. (I don't mean to imply that Pollard is drunk all the time, just that every time I see him, he's drunk.) It's easy to see why I feel a bit conflicted toward Pollard these days-- he's consistently shown a complete lack of understanding as to what draws people to his music. On one hand, that's refreshing because he shouldn't be pandering to the indie cabal. On the other, it's annoying because I'm part of that cabal, damnit. First, he jumps ship from Matador to fuckin' TVT; then he releases Do the Collapse, an album with nearly none of the qualities that made Guided by Voices good; and on top of that, he keeps issuing mediocre solo albums every other month. The wiser among us already know to steer clear of Pollard's solo albums, since the filler ratio on regulation GBV albums is high enough as it is. So why am I recommending Speak Kindly of Your Volunteer Fire Department against conventional wisdom? Two words: Doug Gillard. The ex-Cobra Verde guitarist had already earned my respect for penning Mag Earwhig's standout track, ""I Am a Tree."" Here, he proves himself as the Keith Richards that Pollard's Mick Jagger has been looking for all along: a solid musician, a nimble guitarist, and a grounding force to balance out Pollard's more self-indulgent urges. And while Gillard co-wrote only four of these songs, his influence can be felt throughout the whole album. He takes Pollard's diamond-in-the-rough talent and polishes it just enough to let it shine, while retaining its lo-fi vibe. You can pretty much skip the first two tracks and head straight to ""Pop Zeus,"" on which Gillard's chirpy riff rides an irresistible wave of driving rock. Starting there, Pollard and Gillard reel off a series of tunes that are as good or better than anything off Do the Collapse: the downbeat power-balladry of ""Slick as Snails"" (which is miles better than the syrupy ""Hold On Hope""); the stark, watery sadness of ""Port Authority;"" the picture-perfect pop of ""And I Don't (So Now I Do)""; and the comic-book fantasia ""Tight Globes,"" which beats ""Teenage FBI"" at its own game. So at least the music side of things is taken care of. But the lyrics? Ah... the lyrics. Well, Pollard occasionally turns ugly phrases like, ""Pagan shutters described at shrine/ Dark stems large elephantine,"" or ""Iceberg heads and alien flavors/ This being a giftshop."" But there are also quite a few glimmers of meaningfulness on Speak Kindly-- maybe more than on any other Pollard solo effort, which makes it exponentially better than the others. Pollard can be subtly chilling (""The sight of you/ Is building up a war inside of me/ You're my kind of woman/ I get rid of you"") or full of oddly touching hopefulness (""Knock down all the houses/ Pull up all the trees/ Make a wish/ Life is beautiful"") when he tries to be. Yeah, I know that saying that Speak Kindly of Your Volunteer Fire Department is Pollard's best solo album isn't saying a whole lot. Even saying that it's more satisfying than Do the Collapse isn't saying much more. But when you look at it another way-- that this is the best Pollard's done since Mag Earwhig-- isn't it enough? If nothing else, it'll tide you over until Guided by Voices get smart and release a double live album while someone's still interested.","Say what you want about their recorded output of late, but Guided by Voices is still a great live band ...

I moved the fridge forward and gave one quick sweep. Instantly, a whirlwind of amorphous guitars shot by my right ear. I turned quickly... the sound grew. Soon it filled the apartment-- a spacious, ethereal crescendo... blaring louder and louder. Sound reverberated off the hardwood floors and high ceilings, shattering windows and glass. The thundering bass shook the building's foundation, and with each explosive drumbeat and crashing cymbal, the roof lifted and fell. 90-mph streamline winds ripped through the window, pushing me against the wall and crushing me under the weight of the refrigerator. And finally, at the music's climax, the entire block crumbled. I awoke, reincarnated as a tadpole in a stream. Then I cycled through 1,200 more lives until I became human again. When I was finally reborn, it was the year 20076. It is now the year 20099. Today, I visited the local read/write store and stumbled onto a reissue of the Timeout Drawer's Record of Small Histories. It originally saw release on a small Old Chicago label called Some Odd Pilot some 18,000 years ago. Intrigued, I bought it. The sound is authentic, alright, but in many ways, it sounds as if it could be released today. The echoing guitar lines and shimmering production sound influenced by the old Kure dizks from the 20080s, particularly the space-psychy Pornography and Disintegration. This is mixed with a very spacious ambient presence recalling modern-day superstars Wendy and Carlisle, Milk and Saucer Attack, and even ambient founder Sprou Eno. There are also some vaguely ""past-rock"" flourishes that sound remarkably like newer Zjicago artists Tortix, Gastr del Soup, and the Brie and Steak. Record of Small Histories is comprised of seven mostly instrumental tracks lasting just over 50 minutes. The songs are somewhat formulaic-- they all being quietly with a fade-in or a quiet drone, layering more instruments and building complex walls of sound. But this isn't your standard space-psych trio-- instead of noodling their way to some improvisational higher consciousness, the Timeout Drawer's songs feature actual pre-written melodies which lend some much needed direction and structure to the genre. Unfortunately, it's still a bit gloomy for my tastes, though tracks like ""Lull,"" ""1000 Reels,"" and ""Tourist"" make it worth the Eeyore-ish mood it puts me in. For having been recorded using primitive digital technology, and archaic instruments like electrical analog keyboards, drums (!), guitars and something called a ""synth,"" this record sounds pretty nice. It would be interesting to see what people thought of it 20,000 years from now.","So I was sweeping the kitchen floor this afternoon and decided that I would finally get back behind the fridge ...

I've been fighting with the devil over on the left for about five years now, and I've finally broken free of his sinister grasp. Over these past five years, I've been tied fast-- with forces I cannot begin to describe to your mortal reckoning-- to the inner anvil bone of your ear. One of the devil's minions, a wench spindled of slick sinew, patrolled my imprisonment from a perch on the pestle. As we speak, the devil and his henchmen are on vacation in Brent DiCrescenzo's nether regions. I know not when they might return, so my time is precious. ""First, let me apologize about the hair. I'd have argued for something short-- close to the ears. Oh, and blast that devil for messing with your last Macha review! His barbed whispers obviously hit cochlea harder than Macha's wonderful thunder. When I heard the devil tell you to write that Macha's first record was composed of loops and samples, I nearly summoned the strength to shatter my bonds. I heard and felt the hypnotic, manmade sounds of guitar, bass, vibraphone, keys, and pumping drums trembling my bony prison. It was sweet reprieve from my sentence. ""But now I've been given the opportunity to right such devilish acts, for Macha have released another mystical record, just as I have won escape. Others of my shoulder- angel brethren have heard See It Another Way, and I've heard nothing but praise from them. Admittedly, they're a bit overly positive and kiss-ass, being shoulder- angels and all, but this music really is what we shoulder- angels want to hear. ""Trickling water, muffled laughter, dancing dulcimer, and a humming organ (the band's legendary ""fun machine"") quickly kidnap your soul on the opening track, ""Riding the Rails,"" and flee to Macha's world of exotic foliage and dimly- lit basements. ""Salty"" then commences to pummel your gray matter into ambrosia under the wooden shoe- stomps of Balinese gods. Deep, fuzzy bass and thundering drums keep mortals in check with wrath, as layers of organ, dulcimer, vibraphone, and other gamalan goodies effervesce from the impact. Joshua McKay's breathy vocals puff sweet tension in the bellows. ""The Nipplegong"" pulses similarly with street- market intimacy. The hyper- chiming dulcimer and steel drum sting like a thousand bees until your skin is blissfully numb. ""Macha's vapors are captured tightly in Mischo McKay's thick, steady drums. They pound with incessant, skeletal strength. And just to show that they're not content to wander the Indonesian archipelago, collecting tools, Macha explore other international textures. ""Between Stranded Sonars"" drones with Celtic clangs, crying fiddle, and sultry slide guitar, single- handedly destroying Mogwai at their own game. Macha's crisp cacophony brings to mind My Bloody Valentine, if My Bloody Valentine were Louisville indie- rockers stranded in a South Pacific jungle after a spectacular plane crash. James, I'm telling you, the cover art alone is worth the price. And here's a little secret-- the kanji on the bottom of the cover translates to ""ramen."" Who would think that ramen packaging could be so beautiful? But then, finding divinity in the commonplace is Macha's unique skill. ""With that, James, I must flee.

His trademark skittering beats, packed to the bone with archaic video game sound effects and melodies that were as memorable as they were inventive were an inspiration not only to millions of aspiring DJs and producers, but to writers like myself. Paradinas proved that not everything had been done, and that, when peppered with genius, drum-n-bass could tackle any other style of electronica and knock it to the floor with one perfectly programmed punch. What a shame, then, that on The Fear, the EP that previews his latest long player, Royal Astronomy, he would practically abandon his acclaimed drill-n-bass sound and opt for digitized string sections and a lifeless female vocalist. On the EP's opening and title cut, we're presented with a repeating (and not all that stimulating) chord structure that is neither as catchy or clever as the stunning stuff off 1997's classic Lunatic Harness and its subsequent singles. Just then, vocalist Kazumi makes her overwhelmingly casual appearance (she offers no emotion whatsoever, as though she's just there to get paid), singing unintellegible lyrics over beats that seem like effortless emulations of the drum tracks from ""Brace Yourself"" and ""Hasty Boom Alert."" ""Houzz 8"" is, as proclaimed by its abstract title, house music. Forgive me if I sound a little irritated, but this guy is capable of bigger and better things. The stale bass-kick, hi-hat and handclaps do nothing for the overly complex and dischordant keyboard freakout. ""Morning Frolic"" is The Fear's standout track, with its dark, layered orchestration and computerized soprano. Unfortunately, the percussion goes absent on this number, and it's sorely missed. The end result is a stripped-down, skeletal track that could just as easily have been penned by any one of today's generic Hollywood filmscore producers. The Fear ends with a trip-hop take on the album's title cut, another genre Paradinas could stand to stay away from, if only because he brings nothing new to the table. What's more, the track is horribly distorted-- a trait which might have been more welcome had it not sounded so incredibly accidental. So, I don't know what to say, really. Perhaps Paradinas was feeling experimental and wanted to take it out on an EP rather than cram the stuff on to the full-length. Or maybe he's searching for a new sound. Hopefully, this is the case. I'd hate to see all that talent wasted.","Mike Paradinas (aka \xB5-Ziq) has, over the years, established\n\ himself as one of the leading playaz in the electronic ...

An 8"" green monochrome monitor displayed a flat, straight line that would hop to life, mapping a thousand soundwaves, as soon as Mike Paradinas desired it. A moment of calm silence ensued, and then, with the tap of a single button, the LEDs switched from red to green. Here was the finished project. The stacatto filled Mike Paradinas' studio. Labeled instrument Xyb044 took a leading part on viola. Bells chimed over the strings as the lights flashed in rhythm. ""Scaling."" Paradinas mouthed the word, titling the piece that had cost him all of Monday, a day which might otherwise have been spent eating unsalted rice cakes and enjoying the warm comforts of ""Interior Motives"" on HGTV. It was to be the opening track in his final opus, Royal Astronomy, and it sounded great with those out- of- control skittering, jazz breaks. ""My work will transcend the greatest composers known to man,"" Paradinas schemed. That's when the fuse blew. ""Fuck!"" Mike raced to the laundry room, flipped the switch marked ""Studio1,"" and shot back upstairs to see what damage the outage had caused. The room was silent, aside from the sound of the mainframe's rebooting hard disk. The equipment had been reset and now sat eagerly awaiting Paradinas' next command. Mike checked the programming. All the music was there... but where were the underlying subtleties, the neat effects, and most importantly, where was the rhythm?! Poor Mike hadn't saved his progress. In the days that followed, Paradinas plunged into the depths of his deepest depression since ""Alf"" was removed from NBC's Monday night lineup. He spent weeks in denial, teary and uninspired, until it hit him: he could get by pitching the largely percussionless album as a new direction for his work. Elaborate electronic chamber music! This would certainly be the next big thing. Of course, some songs did seem to miss his trademark drill-n-bass beats. For these select few tracks, he would program some standard beat filler just to spice things up. And by the end of the day-- bang!-- Royal Astronomy. Alright, that's probably not what really happened. But listening to this record in contrast to the sensory overload of 1997's Lunatic Harness, and even his earlier work on albums like Bluff Limbo and In Pine Effect, it's clear that something snapped in the ambition department of Paradinas' neural net. Here, we're presented with 14 tracks of mostly lush orchestration and very little beat. Now, I don't know about you, but if I want to hear a symphonic masterpiece, I'm probably not gonna go digging through the record store's ""club"" section to locate it. And, to put it as gently as possible, Paradinas is no Ravel. I've been listening to this record for months, trying to locate its place in modern electronic music, and it just doesn't fit anywhere-- not because it's so vastly different from what's being done out there these days, but because it's so tossed- off. It's sad to see an artist as obviously talented as Paradinas release an album that sounds like it took a weekend to record. Royal Astronomy offers very little for fans of Paradinas' work, and next to nothing for the electronic music fan-- it's \xB5-Ziq without the \xB5-Z. It's hard to say at this point whether \xB5-Ziq has lost his edge. I mean, it's conceivable that this record is just a transistion to something completely new and different.

Into the Pink,Verbena,by: Neil Lieberman,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a943c0084474cd0c0fe0/1:1/w_160/9d1b4d82.gif,1999-07-27 06:01:40,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8447-into-the-pink/,CapitolCapitol,"Surprisingly, given our cool, unaffected demeanor, we music fans are almost abusive list-makers. Best of the year, best of the decade, best shows we've seen, best bootleg we own, ten albums we'd take to the wondrous desert island-- we set in order the apparent chaos of our musical consumption with almost Germanic precision. Even more surprising than our secret obsession is its source, which I've concluded, after being bombarded by ""Best of the 90's"" lists from mags, rags, e-zines and friends, is harmless sentimentality. In reality, our annual exercise is not necessarily pursued out of a need to make sense of musical output, but more accurately, by a need to recapture, and perhaps even share, that fleeting first moment of love with an album. Thus, in the glut of lists that the end of a decade brings, I've been arduously reveling in the past, remembering the musical climes of the times with friends and colleagues as I develop one of my own. Inevitably, the lists, top-heavy with early '90s releases, draw an ironic conclusion for rock fans. The decade that began heralded by such a beautiful din will apparently end in a whimper. Largely unable to cash the blank check written by the Pixies and later Nirvana, late 90's rockers sit at the head of a lost estate, viewing Ricky Martin videos like a broken promise. Of course, we rock fans are a bipolar bunch. For every time we've erroneously mourned rock's untimely demise, we also too promiscuously hopped into bed with its false saviors. The latest in the strange lineage of these bedfellows is Verbena, an edgy trio whose Southern fried debut, Souls for Sale, caught the ears of more than a few desperate rock critics, along with head Foo Fighter Dave Grohl who produced the band's new major label debut, Into the Pink. Alluding to a pedigree that makes rock critics drool, the outfit kicks off Pink with a Big Star-esque lullaby before settling into a more trampled path. The remainder of effort finds the band heading northwest from its southern rock debut to Grohl's vision of post-grunge, which sounds a heck of a lot like a second-rate Nirvana album. The album's title track is like Cobain warmed over, just as ""Baby Got Shot"" is even a smaller shadow of his former self than even Frank Black now casts. It's true that Verbena are able to semi-favorably execute these pale imitations is an accomplishment in itself these days and might even signal a small ray of hope should the band decide to stake its own path in the decade that lies ahead. Until then, Verbena deserves no more credit for reviving rock than Kurt Cobain's shotgun should garner for killing it.","Surprisingly, given our cool, unaffected demeanor, we music fans are\n\ almost abusive list-makers.

Yay. After trying to meld their trademark lethargic lysergic pop with elements of trip-hop-- a notion which looked great on paper but resulted in 1997's bizarrely abysmal Tragic Magic-- Madder Rose return to form with Hello June Fool. The album's not quite on par with 1994's Panic On, but it's a hopeful sign that the band's getting back on track. For those of you just joining us, Panic On was one of a few great albums stuck in the mid-'90s post- alternative major- label netherworld: too slick and straightforward for the indie/ college crowd, and yet too edgy for the label push it into the mainstream consciousness. It's a shame, too, because Panic On had a real chance to break into the adult- alternative side of radio and still retain a reasonable amount of credibility-- credibility which was more or less destroyed anyway once Tragic Magic, with its ponderously generic beats and lack of songwriting focus, came out. But that was then, and this is now. And Hello June Fool sounds as if Madder Rose has realized their mistakes and retreated to more familiar territory, both musically and geographically (the Thirsty Ear labe is, like the band, based out of New York). On tracks like ""Feels Like Summer,"" ""Talking to Myself,"" and the album's title track, it's like the last five years never happened; the warm narcotic haze of the guitars envelops you like an old blanket, but Mary Lorson's vocals, still cold as ice- nine, keep you from passing out completely. The keyboards and sampled beats of Tragic Magic linger, but they're more judiciously deployed. ""Something"" rips off the groove from the Stone Roses' ""Fool's Gold,"" but makes up for it with its killer chorus; ""Train"" welds bluesy riff fragments onto a dubby rhythm, and lets Lorson's double- tracked vocals slither all over everything. It's good to see that Madder Rose's sultry sonic soma is still available without a prescription; better still that they've taken a slightly more conservative approach to expanding their sound. Maybe on their next album they'll be able to make the trip-hop thing work.","Madder Rose are back. Yay.

Jewels for Sophia,Robyn Hitchcock,by: Zach Hooker,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c0f65e6ef9596932362d/1:1/w_160/b6fac23a.gif,1999-07-20 05:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3888-jewels-for-sophia/,Warner Bros.Warner Bros.,"Sometime last Saturday afternoon while listening to Robyn Hitchcock's latest album, I felt a nearly overwhelming urge to lie down on my back in the middle of my dad's van and never get up. I would have too, if I hadn't been driving on the highway at the moment. The song that made me feel that way was ""I Feel Beautiful""; the circumstances involved too sordid and ridiculous to go into here. But feel that way I did, and it cemented my feelings of love for Jewels for Sophia. You think that's ass backward, I know, but my fascination for Robyn Hitchcock is based on this urge. Ever since I first found my thirteen- year- old self lying in the middle of my living room floor listening to I Often Dream of Trains, I've based my ratings of various Hitchcock albums on how debilitating their melancholy is for me. It's like this: Element of Light makes me want to lie down on the floor during some of the songs and sit up during others; it's a really good Hitchcock album. Respect makes me want to lie down for one or two songs and spend the other songs doing household chores; it's an okay Hitchcock album. Groovy Decoy makes me want to run around the park; it sucks. And Jewels for Sophia made me want to abandon the helm of a large and fast- moving vehicle and lie in the back, heedless of the twisted guardrails and smoke, and dirty looks from other motorists. That's good Hitchcock. ""Mexican God"" boots the record off with the satisfying click of a classic- Robyn- Hitchcock- song- shaped peg being snapped into a classic- Robyn- Hitchcock- song- shaped hole: acoustic strumming, jaunty drums, bloodthirsty deities-- three great tastes that taste great together. ""The Cheese Alarm"" is a fantastic example of what I call the ""Hitchcock Switcheroo"": a song that starts out sounding silly and winds up telling you more than you wanted to know about yourself. ""NASA Clapping"" reunites Robyn with fellow former Soft Boy Kimberly Rew with surprisingly good results. ""Antwoman"" finds its satisfying quirkiness not in its lyrics but in its background ""sighing machine"" and ""antvoices"" (the latter provided by Grant Lee Phillips). The two standout tracks, though, are a fleshed- out version of ""No, I Don't Remeber Guildford"" (originally released on last year's Storefront Hitchcock) and ""I Feel Beautiful""-- both of which find Hitchcock doing what he does most rarely and most brilliantly: using his strangeness not as an end, but as a means to convey an emotional state. Most importantly, Jewels for Sophia seems to find Robyn Hitchcock once again relaxing into the idea that, for better or for worse, he tends to write Robyn Hitchcock songs-- an idea he seems to have been resisting on the past few albums. I'm glad for it, personally, even though it nearly killed me.","Sometime last Saturday afternoon while listening to Robyn Hitchcock's latest album, I felt a nearly overwhelming urge to lie ...

Public Castration is a Good Idea,Swans,by: Nick Mirov,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a5ecb1335d7bf1698cf4/1:1/w_160/d4a1d1fa.gif,1999-07-20 05:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7641-public-castration-is-a-good-idea/,Thirsty EarThirsty Ear,"Oh, great. I review one album for Pitchfork and suddenly I'm the resident expert on all things Swans. I don't dislike them, mind you, but it's not like they're my favoritest band in the world. It wouldn't be so bad if Michael Gira wasn't so damned prolific; we're going on two years since Swans actually broke up and they're still releasing albums-- no new material, mind you, just live recordings and re-releases of old albums. Public Castration is a Good Idea falls under both categories: a live album from 1986, being re-released on Thirsty Ear. Four- and- a- half minutes of slow, relentless bashing opens Public Castration, which is a good way to prepare you for what lies ahead: sparse, gothic instrumentation, blunt- trauma percussion, and Gira's tortured moans. It's terribly bleak and repetitive, and easy to dismiss if you're not in the right mood. On the other hand, if you are in the right mood-- which would be utter disgust with yourself and everyone else in the world-- then lines like, ""I'm your stupid child/ I'm your stupid helpless child/ I'm your stupid naked child,"" become viciously effective. Lord knows what the Columbine killers would have done if they had listened to Swans. (Mmm... probably the same thing, come to think of it.) Public Castration is a Good Idea shows Swans in their most basic form, before Gira began tinkering and expanding their sound in the ensuing years. I personally prefer their early- to- mid '90s work, as this feels a bit too skeletal, but that's just me. Besides, there's no denying the intrinsic entertainment value of having a copy of Public Castration is a Good Idea around the house. The title alone is enough to freak out your parents and roommates; imagine what'll happen if you actually play it for them.","Oh, great.

Red Letter Day EP,The Get Up Kids,by: Brent DiCrescenzo,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bf115e6ef9596932334e/1:1/w_160/816f2f52.gif,1999-07-20 05:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3431-red-letter-day-ep/,Doghouse,"I wasn't going to use the term ""emo."" It is, after all, one of the most played out catchphrases of the decade. But check out these Get Up Kids lyrics! I have no choice! They plug a vocabulary of pathetic loneliness into a Mad Libs of humdrum love songs. ""How do I find her/ Bearing my heart in hand?"" ""Last night on the Mass Pike/ I thought I was losing you/ Last night, I fell in love with you."" ""I think I've waited long enough/ I need you here."" ""Does anyone remember when/ Around the world and back again/ Was a dream not quite so clear?"" ""Sooner or later more/ These words to paper pour."" All your favorite emo cliches are here! The geographical names (""Mass Pike"")! The play on words with geographical names and girls names (""Anne Arbour"")! Giddy nostalgia! Giddy geography! Writing references! Seasons! Missing kissing! It's ironic that so- called ""emo"" lyrics have become utterly devoid of any emotion due to incessant repetition. The music monotonously circles above in a similar holding pattern. ""One Year Later"" and ""Red Letter Day"" mix the juvenile snotrocket punk of Blink 182 with the Midwestern Camero anthems of John Cougar. But really, it just sounds like the Promise Ring with nasally vocals, country production, and gratuitous pick- scrapes. As far as the band's sound, well... the Connells come to mind, and the Get Up Kids should be punished for that synaptic response alone. ""Forgive and Forget"" comes frighteningly close to those Goo Goo Dolls songs that the Ricky Lake- lookin' bass player writes and sings. In fact, a latent ""about to become the Goo Goo Dolls"" feel runs throughout the entire EP. I mean, at least their debut featured the sonic boom of Bob Weston's production. Red Letter Day, on the other hand, should be pointed in the direction of music advisors planning Drew Barrymore soundtracks at Hollywood Records. The closing two songs, ""Anne Arbour"" and ""Mass Pike,"" chime along in mid- tempo delicacy like Jimmy Eat World's lily- white doily rock. The Get Up Kids make the predictable acquisition of piano, drum loops, and keyboards, too. Yet, none of it is done with any conviction and the frills just twinkle beneath layers of flat guitar and harmonizing yearning. But maybe the Get Up Kids know this. The ""thrilling"" packaging, with its taupe, burnt taupe, and mocha taupe color scheme, depicts a large husk of wheat, which pretty much sums it up-- delicately swaying weeds from the Midwest that are used as the most basic and bland sustenance. You know, like Wonder Bread.","I wasn't going to use the term ""emo."" It is, after all, one of the most played out catchphrases ...

Sky Motel,Kristin Hersh,by: Paul Cooper,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c0c5abf31b7dc71564f9/1:1/w_160/1a25f80b.gif,1999-07-20 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3841-sky-motel/,RykoRyko,"Former Throwing Muses frontwoman and Appalachian lullaby- singing mom is back with her third solo album. But just because she's calmer now than she was during her days with Throwing Muses, don't assume Sky Motel is a washed- out affair. Hersh's demons may have been vanquished, but her lyrical acuity can still pierce and unsettle. Nowadays, it's just not so strident. Hersh revisits Throwing Muses territory by putting together a band for Sky Motel. And while I shamefully pine for her to pull off another stunning Real Ramona, I really have nothing to complain about here. Hersh sounds comfortable and relaxed, and the music reflects her even keel. Producer Trina Shoemaker has kept the music subdued and given space for Hersh's lyrics to spread out their beguiling wings. The songs have a bizarre glamour to them. Hersh beckons us into her seemingly placid world, only to whisper sweetly in our ears that all is not well here. But it's too difficult to heed a warning whispered so dearly. Thus ""White Trash Moon"" warns us not to stare at the neighbor's hair or at their underwear; the freaks live next door to Hersh these days, rather than within her. During ""A Cleaner Light,"" Hersh again warns us to ""keep away from the freaks on the fringe/ They only talk to you because you give them a good excuse to cry."" These songs not only advise us, but they also remind Hersh not to let go of the handrail. On Sky Motel's standout track, ""Caffeine,"" Hersh responds to the barking of her black dog of manic depression. She sings, ""The best of us puking/ The rest of us not doing so well."" She wishes that ""we were lonely/ We were boring."" These are her bipolar voices siren- calling again. Hersh resists by not acting upon their persuasions; she acknowledges they'll always be a part of her, and in a line of truly moving pathos, she sums up her situation: ""You're driving and I'm your backseat shadow."" However, the record's single, ""Echo,"" affirms her strength, (albeit in typically oxymoronic Hersh style). Amid Brazilia- styled lounge rhythms, Hersh proclaims that she craves ""the very loudest sound/ I'm chasing everybody/ I'm shaking everybody down/I'm loving everybody."" This exhilaration is matched on ""Costa Rica"" when she coos, ""I caught us kissing on a plane in California/ It wasn't tame, but just the same/ I would love a better drug/ You lucky jerk."" It's as though she used to see stability as a hallucinogen, but now, she's become resilient to the phantasmagoria of reality and aspires to try for the high that the non- manic world seeks. Sky Motel is a powerful, graceful album of quiet victory, then. Hersh no longer considers herself aberrant. This newly- harnessed stability doesn't mean that Hersh doesn't perceive the weirdos and the crazies; it means that now she can start to comment on other people's wayward behavior rather than making uncontrolled autobiographies of her own manias.","Former Throwing Muses frontwoman and Appalachian lullaby- singing mom is back with her third solo album.

Long Tall Weekend,They Might Be Giants,by: Ryan Schreiber,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Founder</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a76f13d19756521393fa/1:1/w_160/50cb436b.gif,1999-07-19 06:01:40,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7997-long-tall-weekend/,eMusiceMusic,"I was in the ninth grade when I first discovered They Might Be Giants' Apollo 18. In retrospect, it wasn't their most shining moment, but at the time, it was the perfect blend of dark satire and catchy, quirky pop. Ah, there's that word. ""Quirky."" Diehard fans of this New Jersey/ New York-based duo complain that there's not a review of a They Might Be Giants album in existence without mention of the term. But y'know what? They're quirky. Sorry. I went into this one braced for horror. I mean, over the course of this decade, the band has become progressively less listenable, especially since abandoning their MIDI sequencers and keyboards for a live band setup. But even at this very moment, I sit listening, stunned. While these guys never let their irresistible pop hooks leave their sides (even on their last studio album, 1997's Factory Showroom, songs like ""Till My Head Falls Off"" and ""How Can I Sing Like a Girl"" got in your head and stuck like flypaper), the songs have lost some of the charm in favor of the attempted comeback single. The band's energy level seemed to be steadily dissipating. They quit experimenting with genres, and worse, their mix of morbid lyrics with head-bobbing pop melodies were nowhere in sight. Long Tall Weekend is set to be released strictly via MP3 by EMusic.com on July 19. It seems likely that these guys felt they could goof around a bit more because, hypothetically, no one would be listening. (This, by the way, is completely not the case. Just as Tori Amos and Morrissey still have massive rabid fanbases, They Might Be Giants fans will do anything they can to dig up unreleased tracks, be it in MP3 format or otherwise.) But whereas this might make for an unfocused and careless record for other bands, They Might Be Giants are actually at their best when they're not really trying. As it turns out, Long Tall Weekend is still not a stellar release, but is easily their best since Apollo 18. It compiles a few songs that originally debuted on their Dial-A-Song line, along with studio versions of songs they've been performing in concert for years. The album kicks off with the somewhat mediocre leadoff instrumental ""Drinkin',"" and is followed up the very average-- and depending on your mood, possibly annoying-- ""(She Thinks She's) Edith Head."" But these two numbers have nothing on ""Maybe I Know,"" an incredibly poignant ballad whose helpless, succinct lyrics (""Maybe I know that she's been cheating/ Maybe I know that she's been untrue/ But what can I do"") are strikingly effective. The brief ""Token Back to Brooklyn"" appears to be heavily influenced by Chicago post-rock auteurs Tortoise and the Sea and Cake with its artsy, vaguely electronic-sounding drum track. ""Older"" is, contrary to possible belief, not a medley of the songs from George Michael's last album, but a classic They Might Be Giants clever (but depressing) ""mortality awareness"" songs. The lyrics say it all: ""You're older than you've ever been/ And now you're even older/ And now you're even older/ And now you're even older."" Add in the memorable cartoony melody, written to emphasize every passing second, and bam!-- you've got a track that belongs on their self-titled debut or Lincoln. ""Reprehensible"" could only be described as ""casual vaudeville."" Were it not for the seriously wack lyrics, it'd fit nicely into an old Fred Astaire film. ""They Got Lost"" has been a live staple for what seems like forever. The standard live version appeared on last year's compilation album, Severe Tire Damage. This first-ever studio recording of the song is far more subdued than its rocking live counterpart, but the melody is so infectious, it could practically be a polka (an actual possibility with these two on the case) and it'd still be a prime cut. ""Nina"" is entirely a capella and sung backwards for that whole ""Arm from 'Twin Peaks'"" feel. And ""Edison Museum"" closes out the album, continuing their fascination with the famous institution, with accordions and harpsichords plinking the song's spooky tune. Long Tall Weekend has a few less- than- grand numbers, of course. The aforementioned ""(She Thinks She's) Edith Head,"" the dorky wordplay of ""Operators are Standing By,"" and the banjo-infested ""Counterfeit Faker"" are accidents gone awry. (You heard me.) I guess that's the benefit of only purchasing certain songs. But if you don't purchase them, does it mean they're not part of whole vision? Indeed not, guys. Call me an ass, but these tracks were recorded as part of the Long Tall Weekend album, and they detract from the overall quality. That said, Flansburgh and Linnell, in a rare moment of glory, have returned to their roots to create their first truly enjoyable album of the decade. But don't count on this excellence to continue. Like I said before, they're at their best when they're not trying.","I was in the ninth grade when I first discovered They Might Be Giants' Apollo 18. In retrospect, it wasn ...

Breakfast with Girls,Self,by: Nick Mirov,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a3a29d034d5c69bf2e87/1:1/w_160/2dd591dd.gif,1999-07-13 05:00:06,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7068-breakfast-with-girls/,DreamworksDreamworks,"Ever wondered what it might have sounded like had the New Kids on the Block recorded an album with They Might Be Giants? No? That's probably a good thing, because then I'd really have to wonder about you. Not like this description of Self is all that accurate, but just listen to ""Meg Ryan"" off Breakfast with Girls and tell me if it doesn't make at least a whit of sense. Within the context of the whacked- out samples flowing through the song, those Hangin' Tough beats and half- R&B-; smoove/ half- whiteboy- whine vocals actually sound compelling, if still a bit cheesy. Even if you didn't know that Self is the product of a singular genius by the name of Matt Mahaffey, you'd still swear it was almost... Beck-like. But since the position of ""the American Beck"" has already been filled by, well... Beck, I guess Self will have to settle for being known as ""the American Momus."" The persona Mahaffey has constructed for himself is that of an old- school, Serge Gainsbourg- style pop star: cocky, witty, occasionally vulgar, and endlessly charming. Breakfast with Girls strikes an almost scientific balance between starry- eyed innocence and jaded decadence; Mahaffey may not be the coolest kid in school, but he still dreams of a life of jet- setting, celebrity- schmoozing leisure far away from his Tennessee digs. While that's all well and good, the actual music on Breakfast with Girls is a slightly different matter. Self's songwriting philosophy mirrors his penchant for goofy studio noisemaking; his off- kilter chord progressions are often more interesting than enjoyable, and his compositions are crammed to capacity with ideas that sometimes don't work so well with each other. Of course, some parts of the album do work really well: ""It All Comes Out in the Wash"" has a dumb, stomping guitar riff with a sneaky little hip-hop bounce to it that makes you want to bang your head and throw your set in the air at the same time; ""Breakfast with the Girls"" is a woozy trip-hop shuffle with a cheeky R&B-; vocal breakdown; ""Sucker"" sounds like Soul Coughing remixing intermission music (decide for yourself whether that's a good or bad thing). Breakfast with Girls walks a very fine line with its intentionally cheesy production; when it doesn't quite work, like on the harpsichord- heavy ""Uno Song,"" the results can be pretty cringe- inducing. Mahaffey has a tendency to cram too many ideas into songs that don't work so well together, turning songs like ""What Are You Thinking?"" into an exercise in channel- surfing. Bottom line? Self has some good songwriting chops, but they have yet to catch up with his artistic vision and studio skills.","Ever wondered what it might have sounded like had the New Kids on the Block recorded an album with They ...

His major accomplishment has been making music that is at once faithfully traditional and cutting edge. Similarly, Appendix Out's folk, often no more than lead vocalist Ali Roberts' fragile vocals over a gently picked acoustic, remains true to its source while turning over enough fences to keep things interesting, though it seems to favor Nick Drake to Oldham's Neil Young. Roberts' vocals provide the ingenuity here, wavering wraithlike over the off- kilter procession, barely failing to cloak the inherent charms of the songs. This is an intensely quiet album. Tracks move in and out of consciousness, sometimes content as background, and at others, seizing attention at will. Songs like ""Tangled Hair"" and ""Merchant City"" follow such patterns, while ""Foundling"" and ""Little Owl"" take a more direct route to one's mind. Drawing from sources as distant as Belle and Sebastian, Oldham, Young and even the likes of Jerry Garcia, Appendix Out deliver subtle and plaintive beauty consistently throughout the album. Flutes and Kate Wright's ephemeral backing vocals provide the necessary flourishes to a simple yet brilliant work. In the five- disc changer that sits in my apartment, Daylight Saving is followed by Dylan and the Band's Basement Tapes. And as I finish off the former's review, the latter's first notes play appropriately. Will Oldham has made a career of preserving the folk underworld championed by Dylan and Robbie Robertson, but Appendix Out attests to its universality.","Will Oldham, keeper of an eerie, whispering back- country strain of folk, has managed to blaze trails backwards for most ...

Where the band's debut alternated actual melodies with meandering bits of downtown-style guitar noise, everything on here could easily be classified as a ""song."" While this isn't a bad thing in itself, this stab at tunefulness is ultimately too straight an approach for a band this weird, and it doesn't quite seem to fit into Deerhoof's larger scheme. Musically, the Deerhoof of Holdypaws sounds very much like a less-refined Blonde Redhead. This development represents a steady progression toward relative normality from Deerhoof's debut, a double 7"" on Menlo Park that contained no singing at all. Come to think of it, that early single barely had any bass or drums on it either; as I recall, it consisted of a few sporadic blasts of guitar distortion in between vinyl pops and crackles. (Needless to say, I don't pull that single out very often.) But back to Holdypaws-- one reason this album doesn't work as well for me is that I'm beginning to see lead- screecher Satomi's limitations as a vocalist. Hearing her high-pitched, artless wailing every second or third song on the last album seemed about perfect; here it pops up on every track. So, while this song-oriented approach will initiate the timid into Deerhoof's strange world, I'm less inclined to stick around for the entire ride. A word or two about that strange world, by the way. Deerhoof's songs universally portray a surreal, nightmarish place seen through the eyes of a child, as if Glenn Branca composed a soundtrack to ""Where the Wild Things Are."" Songs like ""Queen of the Lake,"" ""The Moose's Daughter"" and ""Crow"" describe an interior landscape populated by shadowy, half-beast mutants, which are all given voice by Satomi. There are no songs about ""relationships"" or anything else vaguely connected to the sane world's agreement about what constitutes reality; this is the stuff of dreams, and as such, they are effectively creepy and strange. But music with subject matter this abstract cries out for instrumental interludes and textures, brief soundtracks to help transport us from place to place. Holdypaws only provides us with some decent tunes.","Though I'm a bigger fan of Deerhoof's first album, The Man, the King and the Girl, Holdypaws is ...

No, this is not a cover of John Lennon's 1971 (Johnson & Johnson lotion ad) classic. And it's a good thing, because while Frost would do an excellent cover of that Plastic Ono Band gem, her song is much more refreshing. Last year's Telescopic only further proved Frost as one of the greatest female songwriters of the decade. Songs like the album's intense opener, ""Walk On the Fire,"" the beautiful ""Tender Kiss"" and the haunting ""You Belong to No One"" displayed her talent for writing stunningly succinct lyrics and undeniable musical prowess. Frost also has a knack for enlisting the help of Chicago's musical elite for her records. Her full- length debut, Calling Over Time, featured the talents of Gastr Del Sol's Jim O'Rourke and David Grubbs, and Sean O'Hagan of Stereolab and the High Llamas. Telescopic boasted production by Royal Trux's Neil Haggerty and Jennifer Herrema (mysteriously credited as ""Adam and Eve""). Now, on Love is Real, her three- song snack between albums, she's brought along the Sea and Cake's Archer Prewitt, Eleventh Dream Day's Rick Rizzo, and Sam Prekop on cover art. (Let's talk for a second about Prekop's art, by the way. The guy's fuckin' awesome. 'Nuff said.) The title cut off the new EP is Edith Frost at her finest. Her straight- forward and earnest lyrics have only improved since Calling Over Time. She now throws out stunningly succinct lines like ""Wonder what you're doing now/ Listen for your telephone call/ Nothing to talk about/ Make up any reason to stall"" so casually that it seems like her second nature. Frost's vocals have also become increasingly controlled-- she's become capable of delivering lines like ""Is there anything at all to talk about/ My love is real,"" implying incredible yearning while retaining her dignity. Perhaps the most impressive gift Frost has to offer is that she's able to say so much with so few words. ""Between Us"" is a sparse love song about drinking with a fellow musician that serves as a fine example of Frost being melancholy sans- cheese. ""The Last One"" is an unexpected slice of traditional country from Frost who rarely strays far from her folk-pop roots. Accompanied solely by an acoustic guitar, she executes like it's the only genre she's ever known. Musically, the track is on par with more upbeat Gillian Welch numbers, but doesn't seem to connect lyrically. Love is Real should tide us over until her forthcoming album is released, if only because the title track is one of Edith Frost's best works to date. And judging from the sound of this EP, it just gets better from here. The next album's her Plastic Ono Band.","""Love is real/ Real is love/ Love is asking/ To be loved.""

The flashing lights, the scent of sweat and marijuana, the pounding, pounding music, the endless dancing and sniffing of Vicks Inhalers. Weekends with my old rave buddy Steaky were both incredible and punishing, often beginning Thursday night and ending Sunday morning, fueled by drugs and an endless stream of parties. It was both fun and lonely, Steaky looking into the distance as she ruminated endlessly in a coke or crystal- driven rant on the various DJs she'd seen or heard, her eyes flickering back and forth like candles in a light breeze. One such DJ that she would speak about all too often was Josh Wink. I think Josh held a special power for Steaky. First of all, it was obvious she was wet for him. Whenever she'd start talking about him, she'd talk about his dreads, and how she'd seen him at Evolution, but that he DJ'd there on Wednesdays and she couldn't make the drive from Steaky Central to Philadelphia in mid- week. Steaky had a highbrow corporate job that she was desperate to hold down in the four- day spells between drug binges. It made her sad that she was kept from Josh by something as trivial as a job with a corporate giant, and I could see the idealism and materialism doing battle in her eyes when she spoke of it. She wanted Josh, and, with him would come the redemption of her plastic raver soul. It never came, and Steaky disappeared from my life, leaving me to wonder about her again. Then, just as I prepared to delete her forever from the memory banks, Wink's Profound Sounds Vol. 1 falls into my lap. Ostensibly the first in what is sure to be lauded as the ""last word"" in techno series', Josh proves to us that even if Herehear sucked, he can still spin with the best of 'em. I can feel Steaky's panties moistening right now... out there... somewhere. As you may recall, MTV's first Amp compilation from 1997 included Wink's almost- mainstream breakout ""Are You There."" After its success, many Philadelphians were asking, ""May I have cheez whiz on that delicious Philly cheesesteak?"" and ""Could our beloved DJ Josh Wink have a shot at breaking out, making it to Chemical Brothers and Prodigy status?"" Well, the short answer was no. Herehear fell flat, surely prompting a sigh of relief from Steaky, knowing that her star-cross'd lover may still be within her reach. So, now we have Profound Sounds, Vol. 1. A continuous remix from start to finish (as all good discs are), Profound Sounds displays a Josh that is both patient and clever on the production board. Running well over an hour, the record spans acid house, dub- techno and hard house, the mix becoming gradually harder and more intense the longer it plays on. Josh teases, he plays, he gently flitters our ariolas with the tongue of his turntables, starting the mix with some moderately hard tracks like labelmates Sylk 130's ""When the Funk Hits the Fan"" and Care Company's ""Vol. 1"". But the real meat on Profound Sounds is to be found from tracks 6 through 14, when Josh takes us on a hard- house journey that, well... is even moistening my panties a bit. Call me old-skool, call me Shirley, or all me Al, but this is good stuff that swallows your brain up with rhythms falling over one another in a cascade appropriate for both booty shakin' and abstract chillin'. My conclusion: Josh has proven himself a top- notch DJ, but like fellow DJs Kruder and Dorfmeister, his own songs leave something to be desired. Of course, that's okay-- Profound Sounds makes the cut and keeps me squiggly... oh so squiggly.","Oh, the flashbacks are coming again.

The Tennessee Fire,My Morning Jacket,by: Zach Hooker,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c427ea9e61561daa80ab/1:1/w_160/2bbbf8a9.gif,1999-07-13 05:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5529-the-tennessee-fire/,Darla,"Little Darla is making a big deal about My Morning Jacket. Their spiel is this: My Morning Jacket is not just another ironic, derivative alt-country band. ""There ain't nothin' trendy about 'em,"" Darla proclaims. ""They're the real deal."" This is followed by some gibberish about how you'll think you're listening to some lost George Jones or Johnny Cash album, and some further hooey about how My Morning Jacket don't know anything about the ""indie"" scene, and don't care for what they do know. Bullocks. The truth of the matter is that you're not going to be hearing any of this stuff on your local Country and Western station. If you hear it on the radio at all, it's gonna be on some little college station. Y'know why? 'Cause it owes a lot more to that indie scene than Darla lets on. Yeah, the country force is strong with these guys. Sure, their country sound is not typical alt-posturing. And it's true that there's no irony in sight. But listening to The Tennessee Fire, you'll never be convinced that you're hearing anything other than what it is: country- influenced indie rock by four kids from Kentucky. There. Nothing to be ashamed of. Here's something that might tip you off to the fact that this is not classic country: big, loud, echoing drums, song titles like ""Evelyn is Not Real"" and ""I Will Be There When You Die,"" twelve feet of reverb on every last sound, and singer Jim James' vocal stylings, which often sound remarkably like another southern indie-rocker-- the Flaming Lips' Wayne Coyne. If you spring for a vinyl copy of the album (and you should), you'll be treated to an extra 7"" worth of mournful, simply- strummed songs laid over what sounds like some early Meat Beat Manifesto drum programming. It's good stuff, but of course, it's hardly George Jones. Still, the country vibe is undeniable. This may be the most lonesome record I've heard this year, with the aforementioned reverb making it sound like it was recorded in the dead of night at the back of a concrete drainage culvert, kudzu growing on the amps, major sevenths littering the ground like cigarette butts. These kids can harmonize, too, a talent that most alt-country bands are sadly lacking-- the album's highlight, the ghostly ""They Ran,"" features some background ooh's and ahh's that'll make you think your hi-fi's haunted-- not by Hank Williams Sr., but by the memory of some foggy morning outside of Nashville, driving home to Colorado from Atlanta, broke and nearly out of gas, when you realized something had changed irrevocably and for the worse. Not bad for a song that's ostensibly about somebody stealing the singer's lighter. Ultimately, the sooner you let go of Darla's press kit mumbo- jumbo, the sooner you can relax and enjoy an excellent album. Because, as with any other worthwhile band, country or otherwise, what makes The Tennessee Fire so great is not My Morning Jacket's ""sound,"" but their songs.","Little Darla is making a big deal about My Morning Jacket.

Zero Population Growth EP: Bliss Out v.15,Lilys,by: Chip Chanko,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd1313d197565213b470/1:1/w_160/7e3736dd.gif,1999-07-13 05:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4794-zero-population-growth-ep-bliss-out-v15/,Darla,"I was able to play this album only once before it disappeared. ...Well, it didn't really disappear. I lent it to a girl at work. I thought she'd like it. That's really what started the whole thing. She held on to it for a few days. I dropped by from time to time, managing to sneak in a track here or there. (""Boy! That 'You Win' track sure is great! And 'The Escape"" is great, too!"") This eventually ended when I plunked myself down in her room, ready for more Lilys, and was rudely awakened by a bit of the Beatles' White Album (which I didn't really mind... but where was my CD??) She said that the graphics department took it. Hmm... The graphics department was on the fourth track when I reached them. They had the best set of speakers in the office, so I decided that perhaps this was as good a place as any to leave the album for the time being. I grabbed a V8 from the fridge and tilted back in a chair facing away from the sound. Sun from the window warmed the side of my face. For the next fifteen minutes I felt as if my brain was made of helium. Then I went back to work in my office. Meanwhile, the album continued to make its way around work. Marketing seemed to like ""Back Again."" The Co-Presidents enjoyed ""The Law."" As soon as anyone would hear ten seconds of the album, they'd immediately ask who it was and if they could borrow it. I finally had to steal it from the receptionist's desk while she was on her lunch break. By this time, the jewel case was cracked and the booklet was missing. I quickly went home to listen without any interruptions. If you're not a fan of the Lilys, the Kinks or My Bloody Valentine, realize that this is nothing like that stuff. It's a total departure from what Kurt Heasley has been doing of late (unless he's been doing this at home without us knowing, along with some macrame). Archie Moore (from Velocity Girl in the past and the Heartworms in the present) joins Heasley on this EP along with Trevor Kampman, known in pop circles merely as Holland. Supposedly, this is what Kraftwerk and other Kraut-rock bands sounded like. I personally have never thought of them as being this lush and gurgling. Zero Population Growth is like syrup being poured from one of those fish- shaped pitchers. It's like diving into a swimming pool filled with new crispy M&M;'s. So trust me-- you'll like it. It's one of those records that will stand out in your collection. One of those records that when you have to hear it, you have to hear it. Just don't let anyone in your office borrow it.","I was able to play this album only once before it disappeared. ...Well, it didn't really disappear. I lent ...

1st Imaginary Symphony for Nomad,The Music Tapes,by: Brent DiCrescenzo,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c422eb335119a49ed898/1:1/w_160/ba63f50d.gif,1999-07-06 05:00:05,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5524-1st-imaginary-symphony-for-nomad/,MergeMerge,"Can any record with baby noises really ever be any good? Okay, how about a record with baby noises, car honks, steamship blurts, banjo plucking, tape hiss, a heartbeat, crackling ocean waves, a Muppet- voiced guy whispering into a four track, and a man declaring ""Beware the Ocean of Faces!"" Okay, how about all of those elements in one song? I'm here to proclaim, ""No."" Up to this point, indie rock had never seen its ""Intolerance,"" ""Heaven's Gate,"" or ""Cutthroat Island""-- massive economic and artistic failures. But the Music Tapes' 1st Imaginary Symphony for Nomad is that overwrought beast nobody has been waiting for. Recorded over the course of four years, and taken over the Atlantic to Abbey Road for mixing, the Music Tapes' debut full length is a document in uncontrolled '60s pop fetishism. Think about this: My Bloody Valentine's Loveless took less than three years to craft. Airfare could have been spared, because this sounds like it was recorded inside the utility closet of Abbey Road... with tools from inside the utility closet at Abbey Road. But perhaps this album will be the sledgehammer blow to the back of the heads of Elephant 6 junkies and musicians, where upon they'll sit back, peel off their boob- sized headphones, look in the mirror, and realize, ""Jesus, I think this has gone far enough."" There's a disturbed obsessive nature in someone who would fly to another continent just so they could mix on the ""original EMI desk and limmiter"" that the Beatles and George Martin used. The Elephant 6's worship of the Beach Boys and, primarily, the Beatles has clouded their vision to such a point that they've forgotten what those deified bands were really about-- writing amazing songs. Sure, there was a backwards guitar solo on ""I'm Only Sleeping"" and backwards handclaps on ""It's All Too Much,"" but they only served to give weird experimental qualities to already great music. 1st Symphony is a fitting album to close out this selfish decade, or rather, to put the final nail in its coffin. For here we have the zenith of artistic onanism and sonic wankery. This record weaves such a dense web of inside jokes, uncontrolled indulgences, and obtuse statements that it can only be frustrating, annoying, and disturbing for any listener who wasn't involved in its creation. Even the packaging comes in an admittedly creative, yet befuddling and fragile mess of pop-ups and comics. 1st Symphony can be a fascinating listen, but not for any musical reasons. When looked at as not an ""album,"" but as an audible comic strip or sonic collage, the Music Tapes becomes somewhat more tolerable. Yet it's never rewarding or comprehensible. One can't help but question the sanity and motives of the juvenile idiot savant behind the cacophony, Neutral Milk Hotel's Julian Koster. The analog junk throughout echoes the dawn of recording with wax-paper pops, fuzzing speakers, and sepia tones. Imagine if Thomas Edison had made an album's worth of the Olivia Tremor Control's most unbearable noodlings. Surely, Koster is fascinated with the recording process and the history of pop. But unfortunately, the hodge- podge result of his obsession doesn't inspire any sympathy in the listener.","Can any record with baby noises really ever be any good?

England Made Me,Black Box Recorder,by: Michael Sandlin,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a2d1c0084474cd0c011f/1:1/w_160/eb1a37fb.jpg,1999-07-06 05:00:04,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/743-england-made-me/,Chrysalis,"England's Black Box Recorder is what My Bloody Valentine might sound like without all the tape loops, ear- splitting amplification, and confounding network of effects gadgets. On second thought, maybe that's a stupid comparison. The photograph on the cover of England Made Me-- the young girl, sitting up in bed under the covers, looking bored and morbidly introspective-- tells you most everything you need to know about this unhappy English pop band fronted by the Auteurs' Luke Haines. And, of course, there's the obvious tragic connotations of the moniker Black Box Recorder. The band is named, as I'm sure you're all well aware, after a recording device that captures the final moments of an ill- fated airplane and its crew. We eventually learn, that to the societal malcontents in Black Box Recorder, life is basically an airplane spinning out of control, spiraling toward the ground, and meeting its end in flaming catastrophe. And England Made Me is their own personal black box recording, in a sense. I mean, what else can they do but record the last desperate cries of their tormented lives before they, too, in the Year 2000, crash and burn out like everyone and everything else. But while they're still stuck here in this meaningless void known as modern life, I guess the band figured, ""Aw, what the heck. We may as well sign with a hip label and make an album that examines the ontological riddles which complicated our respective childhoods and rendered our subsequent adult lives deeply confusing and unsatisfying."" England Made Me is also an anti- tribute to the shame, horror and general degradation that must naturally come with being born and raised in post- Restoration England. But is this album good, you ask? Well, it isn't bad. In fact, it starts out with the immaculate ""Girl Singing in the Wreckage,"" on which vocalist Sarah Nixey sweetly croons, ""My 18th birthday I'll die of boredom/ My private world is smashed wide open."" Then we have the undeniably pristine, haunting melodies of the excellent title track. ""It's Only the End of the World"" epitomizes the twenty- something detachment and their going- through- the- motions view of life at century's end. The apocalypse is nigh they say, but who really cares? The spontaneous combustion of the Universe could only be an improvement, so sayeth Black Box Recorder. About midway through the album, though, the song cycle lapses into barely- tolerable redundancy. The album really loses the casual, deliberate momentum it'd been building upon. The sheer simplicity of their approach to songwriting begins backfiring to some degree. ""Life is unfair/ Kill yourself/ Or get over it,"" goes the chorus to ""Child Psychology."" Honestly, ""Child Psychology"" is the most ridiculous, sorry- for- itself disaster of an indie rock song I've heard in a long while. It's a spoken first- person narrative concerning the stunted intellectual and social development of a particular little shit, and the irreparable damage done by misguided and misinformed parenting. ""I stopped talking when I was six years old/ I didn't want anything more to do with the outside world,"" Nixey deadpans. And so it goes that these lament- loving Brits just keep churning out more quaint songs about resigned depression. Sample the cynical detachment on ""Wonderful Life,"" and get a load of the mournful ""Hated Sunday:"" ""Close the window/ Draw the blinds/ I can't stand it if the sun shines on Sunday."" Okay, enough is enough with the hollow malaise and paltry middle- class problems already! Try more coffee, guys-- shock treatment, St. John's Wort, Babar bedtime stories, anything. Yep, after a time, you're just left with empty sorrow and overly reflective gobbledygook over rhythmically- static, lightly- strummed reverb- treated guitar. The same pouty, subdued vocals continually ooze from Nixey's lips. In fact, Black Box Recorder finally carry the fashionable woe- is- me depression thing way over the edge, and chalk up major demerits for covering Jacques Brel's loathsome pro- suicide sing- along, ""Seasons in the Sun."" Black Box Recorder convey a kind of mildly morose but slightly tongue- in- cheek Sylvia Plath- meets- Paul McCartney pop sensibility, with a fairly evident Portishead affectation thrown into the mix. Singer Sarah Nixey has the type of one- dimensional soft whisper that's certainly pleasant enough to draw you into her world without hope. But soon, you just feel yourself aching for her to begin screaming her dainty lungs out, just to shake up the melancholic monotony a bit. The childish existential suffering is a just bit more than this reviewer can stomach.","England's Black Box Recorder is what My Bloody Valentine might sound like without all the tape loops, ear- splitting ...

EP7,Autechre,by: Ryan Schreiber,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Founder</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a14bea9e61561daa4778/1:1/w_160/6ec138b5.gif,1999-07-06 05:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/363-ep7/,InterscopeWarpNothing,"Warp Records is one of those labels that releases so much stuff that it's kinda hard to keep up with 'em. They don't have U.S. offices, as far as I know, so their stuff is released over here primarily by indie labels. Matador's pushing the majority of Warp releases-- they've got Red Snapper, Two Lone Swordsmen, Boards of Canada and a bunch of others; Trent Reznor's Nothing imprint issues the better known stuff like Squarepusher, Plaid, and these guys, Autechre. Autechre have, over the past few years, become one of the best- loved acts on the Warp roster, and with good reason. Their sound is distinctly their own-- they generate the weirdest noises they can extract from their various pieces of analog and digital equipment, and turn it into a mindfuck of skittering madness. Last year's full- length, LP5, was one of their most diverse and innovative works to date. The majority of its tracks seemed to start with minimalist percussion, and gradually build on the rhythm by dropping in more noises until the songs became complex works of sonic terrorism. But we're not so lucky this time around. EP7's tracks start out complex and kind of meander for a few minutes before blending seamlessly into the next number. (It should also be noted that while I believe the band classifies EP7 as an EP release, it is, in actuality, another full- length album. Here, we're presented with 11 new songs and over 60 minutes of new music.) The problem with EP7 lies with its lack of diversity. These songs all sound reasonably similar, offering very little in the way of originality. It's hard to differentiate between the tracks, and after 20 minutes, it even begins to grate. On LP5, the songs were their own distinct entities, with each cut bringing something new to the table. EP7 just seems to wander around aimlessly, alternating between prime Autechre cuts and uninspired filler. ""Ccec"" adds a layer of chopped up, unintellegable rap lyrics to their usual mix; ""Liccflii"" presents a barage of speedy, cut-up beats and an array of musical plings and plangs; ""Maphive 6.1"" is an eight minute long epic, and perhaps one of EP7's most compelling cuts, offering what sounds like an Aphex'd timpani and toy piano; and ""Pir,"" the album's closing track, brings us a gorgeous ambient melody over-- you guessed it-- standard fucked-up Autechre percussion. Sadly, the guys seem uninterested for much of the rest of the record. Perhaps they realize they've become one of Warp's most revered assets and can therefore spend most of their studio time slacking while still receiving tons of critical acclaim and watching their album sales skyrocket. Whatever the case, EP7 isn't their most shining hour. If you want the good stuff, reach for their earlier work.","Warp Records is one of those labels that releases so much stuff that it's kinda hard to keep up ...

Seeing how I was under a tight deadline at the time, this comparison adequately conveyed to the Pitchfork audience that Minekawa was all about classic pop, and that she had the multi- instrumental and arrangement chops to realize her syrupy- sweet musical dreams. Imagine my surprise when I read in Giant Robot that Minekawa is not only going steady with Cornelius, but that she would be writing and recording with him for her next record. Man, I love being right, especially when I don't have to work hard to do it. And so it seems, with her new beau at her side, the already talented Minekawa can't be stopped. This record easily surpasses everything else she's done, with newfound production sophistication and better songs to boot. Gone are those grating moments of excessive twee; instead, our ears are treated to extended passages of warm musical bliss, where modern technology is gracefully deployed in the service of the pop song. See, this is where Minekawa and her Japanese ilk have a real leg up on the American indie pop crowd: Elephant 6'ers know a thing or two about melody, but their deep block on all post- Kraftwerk musical developments continues to disappoint. Those neo- hippies can be as narrow- minded as your average beer- swilling mullethead: ""Where are the fucking guitars?"" is always the dismal refrain. Artists like Minekawa and Cornelius realize that a drum machine, when used correctly, has more soul than Ringo Starr and Charlie Watts combined. It's the ideas that matter, not the alleged ""purity"" of the delivery. And Takako Minekawa has musical ideas to burn. The fuel on Fun9 (pronounced ""funk,"" mysteriously) is provided by a breadth of influences that somehow blend into a singular sound. The opener, ""Gently Waves,"" showcases Minekawa's dreamy voice, multi- tracked into a five- part Wilsonian symphony. ""Plash"" (one of the four Cornelius collaborations) effectively combines a Brazilian acoustic guitar shuffle with choppy beats. And ""Fantastic Voyage"" is one of three tracks featuring the sampling artistry of DJ Me DJ You, featuring a great vocal riff shamelessly lifted from Lou Reed's ""Walk on the Wild Side."" Though all the melodies on Fun9 are strong, a few songs prominently feature a more complex electronic ambiance. ""Flash"" (also featuring contributions from Cornelius) shows that Minekawa listened carefully to Oval's deconstruction of ""International Velvet"" on her remix album: the distorted, distant sound of her vocal transmission undercuts the loping Hawaiian feel of the background music to sublime effect. And ""Fancy Work Funk"" features a trance- inducing Moog pattern that would do the German electronic crowd proud. With or without her main squeeze, Minekawa has got vision.","When I reviewed Takako Minekawa's last full- length Cloudy Cloud Calculator, I lazily referred to her ""female Cornelius."" Seeing ...

Think about it. Both eventually lead to mile- long lines for toilet paper that's rougher than cheap beef jerky, both result in state- owned methods of mass production, and both can cause children to roam shoeless through empty, dismal streets in search of a dirty shirt to eat. Still, communism and compilation albums aren't all fun and sun. They both have a serious downside, namely that they're both good ideas that get completely fucked up when attempted in real life. In theory, what could be better than a rockin' compilation album? I mean, you've got 15 or 20 bands, all on one record, coming together in the common cause of making dope- ass music. You get all new music, unreleased songs from bands you dig and bands that are just like the bands you dig. This should be an easy one, right? These are the albums you should steal if you can't buy 'em, right? Uh... that's what you think until you actually lay down $20 for Bootyshakers '99: Da Gold Card Playas Edition and realize what a fucking crock these albums are. Instead of working in universal unity like the musical lovefests they're all hyped to be, the albums actually become the dumping grounds for every half- assed track and retarded b-side a band has laying around the studio. Really- no band wants to be associated with them. They just go into a rented studio, sing their song with the enthusiasm of a lazy hooker, eat from the catering wagon, collect their checks, and go home. In the meantime, the fat, greasy men at the record company use the profits from the album to push another boy band along the path to pre-pubescent glory and massive drug addiction. In a sentence: compilation albums are the work of the devil. Then along comes a new compilation album, sauntering out of the west like a mysterious stranger bearing no name-- a compilation album that helps a brother to keep faith in the record biz. Oh, Merge is an example of what a compilation album would be a perfect world: 19 straight- from- the- gut songs made by some of the best bands under Mac McCaughan's wiry wing. Featuring such underground music machines as Superchunk, Rocket From the Crypt, Neutral Milk Hotel, and the Magnetic Fields (as well as lesser known bands like Guv'ner, the RockATeens and Lambchop), Oh, Merge offers its eager listener the whole rainbow of the current underground scene, from fast neo-punk to soft soundscape fuzziness. Yet, with all this to love, the record also has its down sides. Merge does little to stray from the unwritten comp album rule that the comp can't be packed wall- to- wall with stellar material. Nope, Oh, Merge is quite varied in terms of quality. With 19 bands touching on around 30 genres, not everything is going to be brilliant. However, the album's highlights are some of the best tracks in recent rock. Of course, the bad tracks suck pretty hard, and listening to them is about as pleasant as shoving a cold soupspoon up your ass-- luckily such tracks are few and far between. Even with all the killer music, the best thing that can be said about this album is that the people on this record actually give a shit about what they're doing, which is pretty uncommon in a world where Wolfie actually has a fanbase. It would be almost heartwarming if I didn't know that Bootyshakers 2000 is less than a month away. But hell, if the boys and girls (read: adults) at Merge did this well with a compilation album, maybe we should have them give that whole communism thing a shot as well. With a bunch of talented, slacker indie kids in charge of the Marxist party, I'm sure we could have food riots started in no time.","On the fourth day of my most recent peyote blackout, I started thinking, ""You know, compilation records are a lot ...

Spectrum,Quannum,by: Mark Richardson,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a1c1b1335d7bf1698330/1:1/w_160/4bd930b1.jpg,1999-07-06 05:00:00,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6621-spectrum/,QuannumQuannum,"Rap music is in a serious transitional period. The strides made in instrumental hip-hop over the past few years have far outstripped the gains created by the MCs, the most famous of which are coasting easily on well- established clichés. To paraphrase Ralph Waldo Emerson (forgive the pretension, and also my theft of this analogy from my good friend Samir), ""You can't have great rappers without great audiences."" As long as the nation continues to line the pockets of those pontificating from one side of the ""playa"" debate, we can expect the lyrical assault to remain forever mediocre. Maybe we've come to expect too much-- after all, nobody requires rock lyricists to continually evolve. But rap comes from the hip-hop cultural tradition, where you either innovate or die, and few of the microphone styles circulating today deserve to survive natural selection. Attempting to change that is the Quannum crew, a collective of Bay Area hip-hop heads who met and began collaborating in the '80s in and around the campus of UC Davis. DJ Shadow is the band's key to success, and also the only straight producer of the bunch-- the rest are comprised primarily of the MCs from Latyrx and Blackalicious, in addition to vocalist Joya Velarde. The Jurassic 5, though from Los Angeles, have a close relationship to this crew, forged with a shared aesthetic and high- minded ideals about the next phase in hip-hop music. Quannum's Spectrum functions as a sort of introduction to the collective-- a label sampler of sorts for their new Quannum imprint. As Shadow's already well established outside of the group, his contributions here are understated. He created the music for four of the tracks, but as anyone who has heard the Latyrx album can attest, Shadow likes to keep his backing tracks simple, tight, unobtrusive and easy to rap over. He reins in the high- drama and sampler virtuosity of his solo work, but the tunes are uniformly funky and serviceable. Those familiar with the Jurassic 5's quickly acknowledged classic EP will love the first tune here, a freewheeling jam with Jurassic and all the Quannum MCs based on the children's song ""Concentration."" Despite production by Lyrics Born of Latyrx, it maintains that trademark Jurrasic 5 schoolyard spirit. But if ""Concentration"" is the best song here, it's by no means the only great one. The rest of Spectrum's tracks intertwine sampled '80s R&B; riffs (Verlarde's ""People Like Me""), updated old- skool lyrical trade- offs (""The Extravaganza"" with the Quannum MCs and Souls of Mischief), and deep semantic intelligence. A true all- star game of West Coast underground hip-hop, Spectrum is supremely satisfying when you think about where rap is at the moment, and only disappoints when you think about where it could be.","Rap music is in a serious transitional period.

Meanwhile, their best instrumental effort is ""The Sunshine Underground,"" an eight- and- a- half minute ride through chiming tones, wafting flute- like sounds, and sputtering and gurgling synths that intertwine with the briefest of dreamy vocals. Actually, it wouldn't have been out of place on the last Orbital album. Surrender will receive a ton of hype based on its superstar guest appearances, and none more historically relevant than ""Out of Control"" with New Order's Bernard Sumner on vocals. Being electronic dance music freaks from Manchester, New Order is like the holy grail to the Chemical Brothers and it's easy to see why. The Chemicals share with their Manchester predecessors an obsession with hypnotic, melodic, dance beats. ""Out of Control"" works so well it could be a lost track from Low Life. After his turn on ""Setting Son"" with the Chemicals in 1996, Oasis' terminally out- of- style Noel Gallagher returns for another psychedelic, Beatles-esque anthem on ""Let Forever Be,"" again snagging the rhythm track from ""Tomorrow Never Knows"" off Revolver. Surrender is both the Chemical Brothers most immediately satisfying work and, perhaps not coincidentally, the most like a rock album of their career. Unlike a fair share of techno, these songs feel like ""songs,"" not a collection of clever samples and a race to the fastest BPM on the planet. Yeah, you can go out and buy your jungle, your trance, your trip-hop and your ambient, but why would you when you'd be sacrificing the greatest gift of all: Surrender's love and understanding.","The poster boys of big beat, that hip amalgam of electronica and rock that has dug its way into the ...

Of course, this is exactly the quality that makes most of it all but unlistenable 15 years later. So many of those bands were just so fucking serious about what they were doing, about their music and themselves. They didn't let up for a second. They just pouted away on 12"" sleeves, t-shirts and huge concert video displays, evidently secure in the knowledge that their featherweight finger- and- thumb keyboard melodies were the nodal point around which the future evolution of the human species rotated. With all that's happened since, though, even the most die-hard Depeche Mode fans must wince when confronted with the bleeping of Speak and Spell or the lyrics to, say, ""People are People."" Go ahead and try it: identify the most hardcore Mode fan you know, call 'em up, and read them those lyrics. Their first reaction will probably be nervous laughter, which will slowly trail off, and by the first time through the chorus you should be able to hear-- even over the phone-- their butt squirming in their chair. ""Who is this?"" they'll ask. ""Why are you doing this to me?"" Of course, there were bands that avoided the self- important New Wave posturing (though, not many). Erasure at least has camp value. The Pet Shop Boys seemed down- to- earth enough. New Order is almost unassailable, probably due to the fact that Bernard Sumner waited until the records were almost released before he tossed off their lyrics. It's the absence of this grandiosity that makes a lot of today's new New Wave bands-- like Orange Cake Mix, Godzuki, and Barcelona-- so good. Simply put, their lyrics aren't embarrassing. Okay, they're silly, sure-- maybe even tongue- in- cheek at times. But they're not Camouflage. Barcelona, in particular, takes fairly faithfully rendered synth- pop and adds lyrics about such things as IRC, computer camp, and Commodore 64's-- it's nerd-pop in the nicest possible way. It's fluffy, yeah, but it's consistently endearing. And the music, while never exactly innovative, managed to provide some enjoyment. The guitar is more prominent here than it usually is on new wave records, and the songs don't lean too heavily on their electronic bases. Some, like ""Sunshine Delay"" and the excellent ""The Downside of Computer Camp,"" are downright rockin'. But Simon Basic's highlight lies in ""I Know What You Think of Me,"" a track that sounds so much like Brotherhood- era New Order that it may as well be a cover. (To Barcelona's credit, the song skirts plagiarism and lands squarely in homage territory.) Simon Basic isn't gonna rock any boats. It's harmless. Moreover, the band's lyrics probably won't be appreciated outside of a certain demographic that consists primarily of those who are in college now (or recently graduated), have owned Ataris or Commodore-64s, or have ever donned a fake stick-on bindi. But this album has at least a few sunny afternoons with friends in it. If you have any friends.","Part of what made new wave so appealing-- at least, to those of us who were middle schoolers at the ...

Stay Down,Two Lone Swordsmen,by: Paul Cooper,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a854ea9e61561daa57c9/1:1/w_160/ada5d687.jpg,1999-06-22 05:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8224-stay-down/,MatadorWarp,"In the 1990s, one producer excelled all others in seizing upon a spanking brand new sound concept that many others have since tried tirelessly to emulate. His name is not Sean Combs, ""Mutt"" Lange, John McEntire, Steve Albini, or even the RZA. You could argue that the honor of defining a decade should go to Prince Paul, but that skit thing just pisses me off now. Sure, it worked on Three Feet High and Rising but give it a rest, people! My huge shout of hearty praise for shaping the musical landscape of this decade goes to Andrew Weatherall. It was Weatherall's remix of the lame, floppy-fringed Primal Scream dirge ""I'm Losing More Than I've Ever Had"" that broke dance culture out from the warehouses and into the great wide cultural open. Weatherall's remix of that track was so radically different from the source material that the band retitled the track ""Loaded"" and the indie-led dance boom burst forth on a generation raised on Sherbet Dib-Dabs, a clipped ear for being insolent, and the highest quality tabs of ecstasy. In the fallout from ""Loaded,"" record labels signed up any DJ for mixing duties who knew one fader from another. Some have fallen by the wayside-- who here remembers Dean Thatcher?-- others went onto other forms of greatness. But the fusion of indie rock and dance has never waned. The Manic Street Preachers still cadge mixes from the Chemical Brothers, as do the Charlatans UK. And the recent success of Super Furry Animals is directly attributable to Weatherall's pioneering. Don't think that Weatherall got the remixing gig by accident. He'd been assiduously garnering a following for his DJ sets at the seminal London Balearic and acid house club Shoom where he'd enthrall clubbers (luv'd up on pure MDMA) with his mix of DJ Pierre and the Clash. So after Bobby Gillespie and his troop discovered that this alchemist could rip up their sub-Byrdsian jangle into an anthem for the ecstasy generation, Weatherall didn't have to worry about when the next pay check was coming in. Every record company wanted to cop a feel of the man's greatness. Weatherall conjured up classic after classic, such as his mix of the Grid's ""Floatation,"" which remains one of the most sublime of Balearic 12""s, and his dusted-up take on ""Abandon"" by This Petrol Emotion. His re-casing of James made that sad Mancunian band a vital listen and his spin on Bjork's ""One Day"" remains a highlight of her career. Weatherall became a major player in the Boys Own production camp and fanzine and went onto produce Primal Scream's mind-blowingly graceful Screamadelica album and its cheaper date sister, One Dove's Morning White Dove. The latter could have surpassed Screamadelica in beauty had London Records not interfered and brought in pop-dance shite-hawker Stephen ""I Ruined New Order"" Hague to provide the beancounters with radio-friendly pop singles. Realizing he was becoming an overexposed remixer du jour, Weatherall went underground. Would that Junior Vasquez and Peter Rauhoffer had similar integrity! Weatherall founded the Sabres of Paradise label and studio project and sought to mesh his predilection for urban fear with skunk-fuelled hip-hop and dub. Sabresonic can boast one of the finest remixes of all time-- David Holmes' acidic percussion workout of ""Smokebelch"" more than rebuffs any criticism that remixing is just a waste of time and marketing budget (which in many cases it is). Holmes became a part of the Sabres system and his breath- taking debut album This Film's Crap, Let's Slash the Seats teams him up with Jagz Kooner and Gary Burns of the Sabres of Paradise. Weatherall wittily located his Sabresonic club in a disused railway arch under London Bridge station, the area best known as the former prowling ground of Jack the Ripper. Weatherall would DJ his dubby hip-hop before guest DJs like Dr. Alex Paterson would knock clubbers out of their stoned groove with cyborg blasts such as Abfahrt's ""Come Into My Life"" (imagine the Band as a German hard techno act-- I gasp every time I hear this tune). Sabresonic (the album) was followed by Haunted Dancehall on which Weatherall pushed into prominence his love of Jamaican musical styles (reference ""Wilmot"" and ""Theme"" if you think I'm crazy). He layed down the blueprint for big beat (""Tow Truck"") in addition to producing skeletal techno similar to the ossified forms that Plastikman was putting out at the same time. Before long, Weatherall killed of the Sabres of Paradise, the Sabresonic club, and established the short-lived Emissions labels. But more lastingly, he teamed up with former Emissions engineer Keith Tenniswood; the phoenix rose majestic once again as Two Lone Swordsman. The duo's debut album, The Fifth Mission: Return to the Flightpath Estate, is a slo-mo groove terrorist, ninja-trained to sneak up on the listener and stick in the blade. The fact that the Two Lone Swordsmen sustain our interest over a double CD is surely a testament to Weatherall's complete mastery of atmosphere, self-control, and above all, narrative. The Two Lone Swordsmen project works as (caution: overused critic's standby phrase approaching) a soundtrack to an unfilmed movie. The Fifth Mission is an existentially paranoid south London yakuza flick. Weatherall and Tenniswood released two album-length EPs in the aftershock of The Fifth Mission (Swimming Not Skimming and Stockwell Steppas) but both were limited releases and became woefully unavailable when the Emissions labels folded. Two Lone Swordsmen finally signed to Warp in the UK, where the duo sit at the head table with Aphex Twin, Squarepusher, Plaid, and the Boards of Canada. In the US, Matador picked them up, and over here the Two Lone Swordsmen find themselves sharing a hugely diverse trough with the likes of Yo La Tengo, Jon Spencer Blues Explosion, and Cat Power. But Stay Down should be more than sufficient to deter you from buying a Guitar Wolf b-sides compilation, or it may just get you out of that bearably ceaseless Belle and Sebastian slump. It's less skunky than its predecessors and more of an electroid groove. And if that's not enough to sell you, Matador's also tacked on an additional five tracks from the Warp-issued A Bag of Blue Sparks EP. These five tracks proudly showcase Weatherall's knack for distilling truly funky elements with an avantish twist. So ""Sticky"" and ""Gay Spunk"" could easily satisfy a Fatboy-wearied house party crowd while techno trainspotters can do backflips at having obtained the original version of ""Black Commandments"" (remixed by Jega as ""Unity Gain"" on his Spectrum LP). If Stay Down isn't the next big leap in the rolling evolution of techno, it's at least a consolidation of Weatherall's long-lauded and thoroughly well-deserved position as visionary producer and audio alchemist. And if he's staying down now, he'll be up for air soon. I'm holding my breath on this one.",,9.3,
What are You Going to Do with Your Life,Echo and the Bunnymen,by: Mark Richardson,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bbf2abf31b7dc7155bea/1:1/w_160/3307db7e.gif,1999-06-22 05:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2667-what-are-you-going-to-do-with-your-life/,Mercury,"We're all so much older now and everything has changed. For example, I voted for Reagan in a mock school election in 1980-- the same year Echo and the Bunnymen released their debut album, Crocodiles. As it turned out, I wasn't listening to Echo back then; my first exposure came via the beautiful single ""Bring on the Dancing Horses,"" a song that played during a key moment in the John Hughes film ""Pretty in Pink."" I finally figured out that the reason John Hughes' shit hit so close to home is that I was the exact age of the main characters in just about every one of his 80's movies. I was just about to turn 16 when ""Sixteen Candles"" went to theaters, and by the time ""The Breakfast Club"" hit the big screen I already had three miserable years of high school under my belt. So rather than being the time of my childhood, the 80's were when I became a man. Legally, anyway. In any case, it wasn't until I entered adulthood and cast my first real, non-mock vote in a presidential election (Dukakis and Bensten in '88!) that I became intimately familiar with an Echo and the Bunnymen album. My roommate Eric, who covered our dorm room with Bauhaus and Depeche Mode posters to balance out my Pink Floyd laziness, had purchased their self-titled record. It came to be their last true album before they broke up. It had a big college radio hit called ""Lips Like Sugar"" that Eric liked to put on when we had parties. The sound of it still makes me feel drunk and awkward. Of course, that album couldn't compare to their ""greatest hits"" compilation, Songs to Learn and Sing, which is still all the Echo anyone really needs, and which also happens to be the first vinyl record I bought after getting a turntable again in 1996 (the year I voted for Ralph Nader). Now, in 2000, I'm almost certainly not going to vote at all, but I am going to spend some time listening to the new Echo and the Bunnymen album. I never would have guessed it, but it's actually pretty decent. Fittingly, Ian McCulloch and friends have mellowed considerably on What are You Going to Do with Your Life? The over-the-top, bass-driven rockers of yore have been replaced with an album of introspective, acoustic songs appropriate for these aging geezers. The title track nicely illustrates this stripped-down approach, with gentle guitar strums and some light brushwork on the drums providing the only backing for McCulloch's rich, resonant voice. He sounds more like Bono here than I remember, but the quality of his singing is perfect-- a weary voice transmitting from some abandoned studio of yesteryear. The strings on tunes like ""Rust"" and ""Fools Like Us"" remind us that Echo were always one of the more classic rock-oriented of the new wave bands, and there's something vaguely comforting and cute about their overzealous reach. More startling are the scattered horn accents, like the stately trumpet that gives ""When It Blows Over"" and ""Get in the Car"" their charms; these songs sound like the AM radio-aping Jim O'Rourke's been into lately. (Strange, yes, but it works well in this context.) And when McCulloch brings it all back home with the melancholy piano tune, ""History Chimes,"" we realize why we liked Echo in the first place: they wrote, and continue to write, good songs. These old guys get my vote for most surprising comeback of 1999.","We're all so much older now and everything has changed. For example, I voted for Reagan in a mock ...

Ximer EP,Takako Minekawa,by: Mark Richardson,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c53b5e6ef95969323a82/1:1/w_160/b505265a.gif,1999-06-22 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5298-ximer-ep/,Emperor NortonEmperor Norton,"This is that rare beast-- the remix EP that's better than the original. Takako Minekawa's Cloudy Cloud Calculator was a solid record, but Minekawa's gooey pop instincts occasionally rendered the tunes a little too cute for their own good. After listening to Ximer, we realize that some of the problem must have been in the beat. In fact, almost without exception, the rhythmic edge lent by most of the remixers here adds the finishing touch to Minekawa's well- crafted sound, ultimately boosting the songs a notch. The best of example of this is Cornelius' picture- perfect reworking of ""Milk Rock."" Da Man from Japan takes a decent song and drapes it in a fluffy blanket of Casio jungle breakbeats, keeping the innocence and sweetness of the original intact while adding a sublime and poppy acoustic guitar to map out the changes. The final outcome is a fine, fine track that would fit nicely on one of Darla's ""Drum-n-Bliss"" compilations. Next up is ""Telstar,"" which gets the dramatic string treatment from Mark Borthwick and Trevor Holland, followed Kid Loco's spicing up of ""Black Forest,"" with its killer guitar pattern lifted, Indiana Jones- style, from the '70s funk Temple of Boom. Loco combines the wide- eyed melody with a gritty groove perfect for windows- down rolling through the night streets of Tokyo. Make sure to take out the Lincoln Town Car. On the more experimental tip is the obligatory Oval track, a radical rethinking of ""International Velvet."" As usual, Oval treats the source track like any another sound file-- something to be fed into the computer and twisted. Markus Popp's Macintosh shapes the song to sound like something from Oval's Dok, sparing only the faintest echo of Minekawa's voice. When her petite pipes break through, it sounds as though she's crying out from the depths of the ""Tron"" motherboard-- you want to jump in and help, but then you remember what happened to that kid in the computer. (Actually, you don't remember that very well, because you only saw the movie once and it was a long, long time ago, but you want to jump in and help, anyway.) Popp throws in a lulling little CD skip to give the track some rhythm, not to mention his trademark 15khz sine wave to give the hairs in your ear canal a workout. In three words: it is beautiful. Also of note are Nobukazu Takemura's electronic bossa nova rendition of ""Phonoballoon Song"" which utilizes some nice Steve Reich-ish percussion, and Sweet Trip's techno- soaked spin on ""Cat House"" which closes the EP on an up note. Ultimately, Ximer isn't going to change the world, but it gives a good name to the tiresome notion of the remix record.","This is that rare beast-- the remix EP that's better than the original.

To: Tony Blair [henchman12@lucifer.co.uk]
Subject: X-Plaid922-1; Request for Government Assistance Dear Mr. Blair: My position is as an undercover agent in London's secret police mafia. I have been hired to investigate allegations that two former members of Black Dog Productions, Ed Handley and Andy Turner, have illegally obtained official documents pertaining to the creation of a highly addictive, mind- altering chemical agent (referred to in goverment documents as X-Plaid922-1) which affects its victims via audio transmissions rather than means of physical intake. I am concerned that Handley and Turner may have, under the alias of Plaid, not only unlocked previously unrealized secrets about the production of this chemical agent, but also discovered a way to digitally reproduce it onto compact discs, cassettes, and even vinyl records. As you know, it is the reproduction of the X-Plaid agent to compact disc that is of the utmost concern. In this technologically- advanced society, nearly every home has a compact disc unit. Handley and Turner must be stopped before every person on this Earth becomes an X-Plaid junkie. The first piece of evidence I have obtained is their 1998 release Not for Threes. The music on this record is so painfully wonderful that even I, Snake ""Nerves of Steel"" Snakeman, was almost drawn into its tangled web of madness. The album is an excellent indication that Handley and Turner are not working alone. Not for Threes features guest appearances by a number of female vocalists, among them Talkin' Loud Records diva Nicolette and even Icelandic sensation Bjork. When tested for levels of the addictive X-Plaid agent, Not for Threes registered a 7.5 out of 10 on Pitchfork- funded equipment. Luckily, the album did not gain widespread mainstream acceptance, though the minds of a number of club- hopping e-consuming electronic music fans were utterly destroyed. The greatest shock to me is how an album containing the X-Plaid agent, let alone such excessive amounts, was able to garner enough of a following for the band to appear on our own BBC- operated John Peel show! Thankfully, Plaid had apparently not yet perfected their aural narcotic, as Pitchfork equipment registered X-Plaid levels for the band's subsequent Peel Session EP at a slightly less potent 6.8. Plaid's latest album, Rest Proof Clockwork, is another story entirely. Here, they seem to have enhanced and mutated the X-Plaid agent dramatically through more varied instrumentation and exploration of what is commonly referred to as melodic ""ambient"" music. This allows the listener to lose themselves completely in a world of X-Plaid- induced bliss, whether they're paying attention to the music or not. A key demonstration of this is the album's closing track, ""Air Locked."" The music begins with a series of percussive shuffles and squeaks before beautiful, highly melodic chimes and digital effects enter the mix. The sound is almost spiritual, invoking cinematic rainforest imagery. The X-Plaid agent is planted throughout this entire record, making it difficult or impossible to resist addiction. For instance, the orchestral ""Dead Sea"" is an irresistable symphony of pure evil, recalling Jerry Goldsmith's timeless score to ""Poltergeist."" ""Little People"" is a blend of \xB5-Ziq's spacy melodic attack, and pummelling, cut-up hip-hop grooves. ""Pino Pomo"" combines backwards effects with the feel of a futuristic spaghetti western. Even the absurdly titled ""New Bass Hippo"" pulls through, incorporating shuffling percussion and a Stereolab- influenced piano line. With every passing second I work on this case, I find myself becoming more and more attached to the sound of the music, but I must venture on... to justice. I will require government assistance-- backup, arms, further documentation from the X-Plaid922-1 file, and a free lunch at the Denny's in Golden Valley, Minnesota, USA-- in apprehending these two zany, madcap individuals. Please respond ASAP. ----

Field Recordings from the Cook County Water Table,Brokeback,by: Chip Chanko,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a3ab13d1975652138b2f/1:1/w_160/f574d865.gif,1999-06-20 06:01:40,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/951-field-recordings-from-the-cook-county-water-table/,Thrill JockeyThrill Jockey,"I was riding the Chicago L at 6:30 in the morning on a Sunday. The weather was cool with no rain or humidity. A friend-- we'll call him ""Joe""-- had pointed me in the right direction, so I was now on the Blue Line ""to Forest Park"" at Damen. I was headed to the loop so I could switch over to the Orange Line for Midway. The sun was up, but was hidden behind the long row of buildings that stood there as if they were just people made of buildings. There were three other passengers in the car, each probably writing his or her own record review. Mine was to be about the first solo recording by Eleventh Dream Day/ Tortoise/ For Carnation guy Doug McCombs. My first concern was whether to call it a solo project or new band. Was it really a solo effort? He had quite a few people playing with him. But he wrote all the songs... I finally ended up deciding on ""solo effort,"" at about the same time that I arrived at the Monroe stop and exited the train. At this point, I needed to make my way through the city for a few blocks. I remembeOrange back to the first time I heard Tortoise. I bought their first album in the summer of 1994, along with Girls Against Boys' Cruise Yourself, Ida's Tales of Brave Ida, and Liz Phair's Whip Smart. I didn't really get a chance to listen to the records until I was on an airplane headed towards Ireland, where I would spend the next year. Tortoise ended up making its way to my discman one night while I was busy trying to keep warm using three blankets and a hot water bottle (the Irish didn't really believe in insulating their buildings). The music filled the darkness of my room but, at the same time, left me with a feeling of moroseness and wonder. What struck me most was the bass-- it didn't play rhythms. It spoke. It walked around the room, leaned against the door, then danced to the window. It was Doug McCombs. Well, okay, it was also Bundy K. Brown, but for review purposes, we'll stick to McCombs. With Brokeback, McCombs is free to let his bass walk us through his version of the Chicago post-rock music scene. Releasing this album automatically relegated all his previous bands to side- project status. It gave us a blueprint mapping essentially what Doug ""Puffy"" McCombs brings to these other bands: the empty ambiance filled by plucked strings; the simple driving melodies that wander from your speakers without settling anywhere in particular. Hunger and my bag were weighing heavily as I climbed the stairway to the Jackson stop on the Orange Line. I pulled out a bag of peanuts that I'd stashed during my flight in to Chicago. Perfect. Eggs would have been better, but hey, protein is protein. I got out my discman as the Midway train approached, putting the Brokeback disc in for my trip down the line. I fell in and out of sleep with the music on my headset as the train made its trip to Midway. Here was the same sense of space that defined the first Tortoise album. The sounds were sparse and ethereal-- distant, yet close. Most of the tracks on Field Recordings are comprised of simple six- string bass and brushed drum accompaniment due to McCombs' minimalist approach to arranging. On ""A Blueprint,"" the drums are even forgone by John McEntire for a simple triangle. Mary Hanson of Stereolab makes a guest appearance on ""The Great Banks,"" a tune that answers (and is basically the same melody as) ""Along the Banks of Rivers,"" the last track off Tortoise's Millions Now Living Will Never Die. While the Tortoise version is the slowest and most drifting track on that album, the McCombs version is lighter still-- music from a spaghetti western using whistling and la-la-ing to carry the main melody as the track slowly works through its five minutes. McCombs also uses sound effects to give the album a sense of place. I woke up during ""The Wilson Ave. Bridge at the Chicago River, 1953"" thinking that I was sitting on a garbage barge on Long Island Sound as seagull and tern chirps surrounded me. (Although, I guess I was probably supposed to be somewhere near the Wilson Avenue Bridge. Oops.) Putting the song in a setting like this lifts the bass- driven instrumental into the atmosphere, placing its sound outside the studio and in the air as if it were a soundtrack to your existence. And at this time, it had indeed become the soundtrack to my ride in the third car of a Orange Line train heading towards Midway Airport on the South Side of Chicago.","I was riding the Chicago L at 6:30 in the morning on a Sunday.

Jean-Yves Prieur, aka Kid Loco, has been putting in his time as a remixer, especially over the past year. He's shown up with excellent re- arrangements of songs by the High Llamas, the Pastels, Cornelius, Mogwai, and Takako Minekawa. Naturally, his stateside debut, the specially- priced Prelude to a Grand Love Story EP, sparks a bit of curiosity. The shitty thing is, only two of the nine tracks on the EP appear in their original incarnations. The opening track, ""She's My Lover,"" blends the new age-ish vibe of a sitar-less Talvin Singh with the spaced- out psychedelics DJ Shadow dished up on UNKLE's Psyence Fiction. Later, there's ""Sister Curare,"" whose starry atmosphere, skull- rattling beats, and jazzy piano'll get you reminiscing about the darker Ninja Tune stuff from '95-'97. Also included is the ""Original Radio Edit"" of ""Love Me Sweet,"" a typically folky but endearing French ballad featuring the girlish, whispery vocals of Katrina Mitchell. The rest of the disc is comprised of various remixes of these and other Kid Loco tracks. Saint Etienne's version of ""Love Me Sweet"" is a slightly extended take on Loco's radio edit, but it's stripped down and minimal instead of orchestrated and airy. Jim O'Rourke's spin on the song incorporates discordant electronic noodling before pulling the timeless ""fakeout"" ending. The track then veers off in an entirely different direction as O'Rourke adds a mid-song ambient noise collage and a highly melodic mix of looped acoustic guitars. Tommy Hools' remix of ""Love Me Sweet,"" however, is completely half-assed, bordering on rude. Hools keeps the original song structure intact, but sucks all the creativity out, throwing in a sludgy hip-hop rhythm track and a boring, repetitive piano line. Bang Bang recreate ""She's My Lover,"" mixing in an obvious sitar, removing the song's vocal track, upping the reverb and adding their own sound effects-- in the end, it sounds like a slightly altered version of the original that is, if anything, more organic than Loco's creation. This leaves us with two mixes of ""Relaxin' with Cherry,"" a song I've never heard in its standard form. Let me suffice to say that the Gak Sato Pre-Echo Mix beats the crap out of the Dimitri from Paris and Bibi remix. As the title suggests, this record's a prelude to A Grand Love Story, Kid Loco's Atlantic Records full- length debut. It's just too bad we don't get to hear more of his work on this EP. But despite its general hit- and- miss tendencies, Loco's untouched pieces, along with the Gak Sato mix of ""Relaxin' with Cherry"" and the O'Rourke mix of ""Love Me Sweet"" make Prelude worth the special price.","A hole in the wall opened up and Kid Loco came tumbling out.

Run Lola Run,Soundtrack,by: Sarah Zupko,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6edc0084474cd0c0a9f/1:1/w_160/d43f89b2.gif,1999-06-15 05:00:00,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7873-run-lola-run/,TVTTVT,"You can hardly turn around this summer without being bowled over by the Run Lola Run hype machine. It's touted as the savior of European cinema, and the film that may finally put the German film industry on the pop culture map of the post-millennium era. Rumor has it, the filmmaker already has a Hollywood deal in the works. (A word of advice: don't do it!) Like the true postmodern filmmaker he is, Tom Tykwer doesn't believe in divisions between artistic mediums, hence the centrality of the techno score in the film. The music quite literally moves the film along, and may also bust open the market for German electronica in this country. We may even have a true Renaissance man from the old school in our midst-- Tykwer not only directed the film, but wrote the screenplay and composed the lion's share of the intense, high-energy music that drives the film. Thing is, this music won't likely persuade you to throw out your Rastermusic/ Noton or K7 Records. The frenetic mood is pretty constant-- a highly essential feature, I admit, for a film entitled Run Lola Run-- but a few changes of mood might encourage me to spin this one more often. The stuff on this record could be accurately summed up as ""a poor man's Underworld,"" especially with all the monotone vocals and pulsing beats that so clearly ape Born Slippy. Still, if you're one of the many getting hooked on this film, and you need a better soundtrack for your hours spent in front of the Playstation, this could hit the spot.

Anahata,June of 44,by: Brent DiCrescenzo,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ba3913d197565213b026/1:1/w_160/69a9cb59.gif,1999-06-08 05:00:09,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4315-anahata/,Touch and GoTouch and Go,"Throw out whatever preconceived notion of June of 44 you've been carrying around. This is a completely different beast. Over their first couple of albums, June of 44 switch- hit between riff- heavy rock majesty and intricate, heart- melting melodicism. Last year's Four Great Points brought a little more to the table with dub and skewed, gut- punching punk sprinkled amongst the standard fare. But on their fourth long- player, June of 44 turns the spotlight on the all- star rhythm section of Fred Erskine and Doug Sharin, who appear in too many other bands for me to even begin to count. This is their album, as they introduce such foreign elements as piano loops, wah- wah bass, keyboards, vibraphones, and trumpet to the mix. Erskine even grabs the mic to the album's detriment; his voice borders on the screamy and shaky unlike the delicate whisper- harmonies of Sean Meadows and Jeff Mueller. Guitars have been relegated to more of an accessory role-- snaking feedback, quiet jangles, and punctuating bursts-- whose function only blossoms on subsequent listens. The true star of Anahata is clearly Doug Sharin. Someone get this guy a Drummy Award. His complex lines can layer a one- hand roll, hissing cymbol splashes, a deep groove, and calculated bursts with ease. His electronica- mimicing beats gives Anahata a more groove- and- repitition vibe than other June of 44 records. Some moments on ""Equators to Bi-Polar,"" ""Peel Away Velleity,"" and ""Five Bucks in My Pocket"" are downright funky. The mature, groove- oriented progression follows a similar path of recent Fugazi records, although June of 44 go with a decidedly mellower, moody approach. Anahata brings an entirely unique sound to that beaten Chicago indie scene, a feat which alone merits heavy accolade. Disparate elements from jazz, funk, and world music are incorporated seamlessly into the dogmatic two- guitar, bass, and drum attack. It's a little more difficult of a listen, especially with the disappointing less- melodic vocals (Erskine needs to pass the mic back to the pros), but more rewarding in the long run. By far, this is the most uniform and coherent record June of 44 has crafted. Only veteran indie stalwarts can pull this off, as they're less concerned with haircuts and coffee shops than experimenting with rock. Whether this is a ""new direction"" or one- album experiment remains to be seen. Yet, the fact that they can continually keep us on our toes deserves applaud.","Throw out whatever preconceived notion of June of 44 you've been carrying around.

Bloomed,Richard Buckner,by: Jeremy Schneyer,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a3dd5e6ef9596932072e/1:1/w_160/05279ae2.gif,1999-06-08 05:00:08,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/999-bloomed/,RykoRyko,"One of the finest albums to be released last year in any genre, on any label, was Richard Buckner's Since. A few critics drooled on themselves and some heady words of praise were penned, but apart from that, life went on as usual. The album had that rare quality that's so uncommon in music of any kind-- it was ephemeral, yet firmly rooted in many traditions. You could see the points where he started from and see the finished product, but not necessarily trace the paths used to get there. Unfortunately, this masterpiece was released on a relatively unsympathetic major label which gave Buckner very little support in terms of promoting the record. Basically, they let it die. At his recent performance at Seattle's Bumbershoot music festival (which was more like a giant rant against the music industry interspersed with some songs here and there), Buckner introduced a new song with the words, ""This is a new song... and it might turn up on a record someday if I ever run across an honest person in the music industry, which should be in about 55 years."" Man! However dubious the future of Buckner's recording career may be, he's seen fit to allow Rykodisc to reissue his excellent first album, Bloomed, with a few extra tracks to sweeten the deal (as if it really needed sweetening). The songs here are more traditional, and more traditionally folk- oriented than much of his later work. The instrumentation is limited to Buckner's raggedly beautiful voice, his surprisingly elegant guitar work and flourishes of pedal steel, fiddle, accordion and the like. Buckner's poeticism is already in full form here-- check the first lines of ""Rainsquall:"" ""As the rain breaks through the branches/ Along southbound forty-two/ The green I grew left us/ Wet-eyed red and bluebird blue."" Throughout the album, Buckner invests these modern folk songs with such personal fire that some of the songs read almost like diary entries and love letters written by some brilliant, half- crazed author. Buckner has the rare ability to pile metaphor on top of metaphor and make it all somehow work out. Take ""Gauzy Dress in the Sun,"" for example, on which he croons, ""A gauzy dress in the sun/ And a blue moon bloomed... I thought of you, a lake I drink/ And I turned lazy, hot and meek/ But the well went deeper, dear/ When you brought your water here."" Heady stuff, to be sure, but Buckner's gritty, gravely voice keeps these tracks rock- solid and earthbound, where they might otherwise threaten to float off into the ether. When Buckner veers closer to traditional folk, he invests his songs with an almost apocalyptic urgency. ""22,"" a chilling ballad which details the undoing of a spurned young lover, creeps up to death's door and has the temerity to peek around the corner and report back; ""Emma"" could have just as easily been written in 1894 as 1994, with its harrowing detail of a young woman who ""looks like the good lord has given [her] up."" It's the personal nature of Buckner's songs that elevates him far above most other contemporary folk artists, and it's the timelessness of the bulk of his songs that elevates him above almost all rock songwriters. Like Richard Thompson, Buckner is an intelligent, literate wordsmith and a borderline brilliant musician, with a voice so full of expression and grit that pretty much anything he has to say comes out sounding right. And, of course, this was only the beginning. If you dig Bloomed, do not neglect to find his last two albums, Devotion and Doubt and Since.","One of the finest albums to be released last year in any genre, on any label, was Richard Buckner's ...

Californication,Red Hot Chili Peppers,by: Brent DiCrescenzo,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a2269d034d5c69bf2b20/1:1/w_160/9b8b0313.gif,1999-06-08 05:00:07,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6709-californication/,Warner Bros.,"I actually frightened friends of mine when I declared that I was looking forward to the new Red Hot Chili Peppers record. Dan simply replied sardonically, ""Dooooode."" BloodSugarSexMagik was the first CD I ever purchased. Listening to a CD on headphones after a decade of cassettes was revelatory. Faint, echoing harmonies, popping bass, and crisp, finger- lickin' guitar swirled in my ears. (In retrospect, I guess technology had a lot to do with my infatuation with the album.) Now, Californication sees the same players (John Frusciante and Rick Rubin included) from the that album return. As expected, it's considerably better than the bone- stupid One Hot Minute, but not quite as funky- assed as their acclaimed 1991 effort. But wait. Before we go any further, let's talk about Dave Navarro. Dave Navarro was a horrible fit for the Red Hot Chili Peppers. Thankfully, he's off in some private velvet- paneled studio pouring hot wax on his nipples and applying mascara. Look up ""wannabe rockstar"" in the dictionary and you'll find a picture of Dave Navarro's pierced nipples and school- of- Depeche Mode black nail polish. So, weighing in at a stunning 85 pounds, the band's former guitarist John Frusciante and his quavering, pasty, skeletal body rejoined for the Californication sessions. In his off time from the Chili Peppers, John Frusciante recorded a couple of drug- induced solo mishaps and had a best- selling Italian novel named after him. The man brings a rucksack of real emotions with his guitar. I'll also wager my credibility that he's the best big- time American rock guitarist going right now. His fingers can effortlessly switch from the pickin' funk of ""I Like Dirt"" to the sculpted feedback of ""Emit Remmus"" to the tender, lovely (yes, really, a tender, lovely Chili Peppers track) ""Porcelain"" to the clever, stadium- sized solos throughout. But best of all, he makes you forget about that crazy monkey on bass. Eh, but let's face it, the biggest obstacle in your enjoyment of a Red Hot Chili Peppers album is horny crooner, Anthony Kiedis. If you can stomach lines like ""Go-rilla cunt-illa/ Sammy D and Salmonella,"" ""Up to my ass in alligators/ Let's get it on with the alligator haters,"" and ""To fingerpaint is not a sin/ I put my middle finger in,"" you're good to go. If those lines make you wince like Pitchfork Editor Ryan Schreiber, keep in mind that I pulled those from only two of fifteen songs. In a way, you have to be familiar with California to appreciate Kiedis' lyrics. I mean, Los Angeles is shallow, sunny, fun, and tragic. So, in this age of unfathomably horrible choruses like, ""I did it all for the nookie/ The nookie/ So you can take your cookie...,"" ""Because you did my homies,"" and ""Bawitdaba"" (a five- spot to anyone who can explain that one), we can cut the Chili Peppers some slack. Plus, the sincere, hook- laden, mellow jams of ""Scar Tissue,"" ""Otherside,"" and ""Road Trippin'"" more than make up for whatever knuckle- dragging Kiedis executes. That the Chili Peppers even gave us a single you can actually tolerate on the radio should be heralded. Longevity in rock music is about as rare as hip-hop spellcheckers these days. The idea of albums has given way to the force- feeding of singles. Teens reposter their walls with the face- of- the- moment more frequently than undercover advertisers placard boarded- up fences and buildings in New York. Basicially, the Chili Peppers are the closest thing we have to a Led Zepplin today. If you want quality, commercial, Jeep- stereo, headphone, stadium- filling, champion Rock that you can get behind, where else are you going to turn? Not to Eminem, you ain't.","I actually frightened friends of mine when I declared that I was looking forward to the new Red Hot Chili ...

Grande Rock,Hellacopters,by: Steven Byrd,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c0a413d197565213ba8f/1:1/w_160/a86c24d6.gif,1999-06-08 05:00:06,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3809-grande-rock/,Sub PopSub Pop,"There's a school of psychological thought that says that the reason the electric guitar is so popular is because it's the great American phallic symbol-- a substitute love-pump that overpaid rock stars can stroke onstage without going to jail. These clammy-palmed bookworms say the source of the music world's fascination with guitar rock is that we, in some roundabout way, get a deep voyeuristic charge out of watching Keith Richards and company ""handle their business."" I don't buy it all, but as sick as it sounds, that's the thought that kept knocking around my brain-pan as I listened to the Hellacopters' guitar-fueled Grande Rock. And trust me, when an album forces you to contemplate the dark, cold notion of a member of the Rolling Stones yankin' the chain, something is terribly, terribly wrong. Sporting a sound that's one part Yardbirds, one part Allman Brothers, and a tiny, tiny part Clash, the Hellacopters create music that would sound at home on a late night TV ""Freedom Rock"" compilation. As such, Grande Rock is one long, Cro-Magnonly stupid guitar solo. As ridiculously crude and full of chest-beating bravado as its name implies, Grande Rock is guitar rock at its most brash, cocky and ballsy. Sadly, though, all of the ass-backward qualities that killed guitar rock show up here, too, as track after mediocre track becomes more of a single long, amazing bland piece of music than an actual collection of songs. The tracks themselves offer the kind of moronic predictability I'd hoped indie rock had left far behind. Stylistically, these guys are in the black, as most of these kinds of bands are. Rock-solid guitar work backed up by nimble keyboard playing, powerful drum work and banshee-like vocals are what save this album from being just another of Sub Pop's roster of forgettable ""big rock"" bands. See, the Hellacopters are decent enough for what they are-- there's no frontin' that these guys are technically accomplished musicians. This type of instrumental mastery-- not just over the guitars mind you, but over the entire band setup-- is something these guys should be proud of. Actual musical talent is sadly lacking in most of today's lazy-ass indie rock scene, but the Hellacopters play the real deal. Unfortunately, hot licks do not a good album make. Even if you can get past the nonexistent lyrics, the repetitive song structures and the general lack of creativity, there's a staggering lack of depth to Grande Rock that no power chord can cover up. Listening to this album for anything other than the guilty pleasure of listening to a man tear up his guitar string by string is like watching porno films to score acting tips.","There's a school of psychological thought that says that the reason the electric guitar is so popular is because ...

Interstellar Space Revisited: The Music of John Coltrane,Gregg BendianNels Cline,by: Brent S. Sirota,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a5fcb1335d7bf1698d19/1:1/w_160/87fc9824.gif,1999-06-08 05:00:05,Jazz,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1509-interstellar-space-revisited-the-music-of-john-coltrane/,Atavistic,"A friend of mine once remarked about the later music of John Coltrane and Miles Davis that the two musicians departed from the jazz tradition through completely opposite exits. Miles (for the moment we'll forget his unrelentingly mediocre '80s output) tended toward submergence of his voice. His '70s albums-- from the fiercely swaggering Jack Johnson to the seismic twin live sets recorded just prior to his six year hiatus, Agharta and Pangea-- were mired in electronic noise and chugging rhythm. He put a wah- wah on his trumpet and claimed that he wanted the instruments to be indistinguishable from one another. The move was toward collectivity in sound, an idea Miles associated with African music (certainly refracted through the lens of Hendrix's guitar). Coltrane, canonized as a saint by at least one church I know of in San Francisco, moved in the absolute opposite direction: toward singularity-- the transcendence of his own searching voice above all else. Even the symbology with which the two musicians presented their music moved in opposite directions. Davis presented himself in a kind of a primeval paganism, as the Dark Magus-- the Sorcerer-- and cloaked his songs in a tellurian rhetoric: earth and evil. Coltrane, however, adopted an almost Christian lexicon after the psalmic perfection of A Love Supreme; he fancied his archangelic music a kind of personal liturgy. And after a restless life of continuous ascension, Coltrane's final album reached the cosmic heights of Interstellar Space. Now, we can debate volumes on the merits and flaws of Interstellar Space, an album stripped of the legendary quartet, featuring only Coltrane and Rasheed Ali on drums. We can suffice to say that it was 'Trane's nod to the music of the spheres, and that it is accordingly difficult and complex. The idea of covering this album, also suffice to say, is lunacy. However, free- jazz drummer Gregg Bendian of Interzone and guitarist Nels Cline have attemptd to do just that. Now, I'm ever wary of the phrase ""plays the music of,"" and it can be excused when we're talking about Gershwin or Bacharach, but the idea of someone else playing John Coltrane's music is basically paradox. Surprisingly enough, Cline and Bendian make the right decisions: they play in the spirit of John Coltrane: ascendant, noisy, searching and free. Cline's guitar- playing offers such non- stop feedback- soaked freakout that it almost approaches the sound of a continuously connecting modem. Bendian's drumming is similarly abstract but manages to always sound like creative, ballsy rock drumming rather than the nimble coloring of Ali. In reality, this album owes more to John McLaughlin's Mahavishnu Orchestra and the great '70s fusion that Miles himself inspired than any sound John Coltrane ever produced. (I can't help but think of the guitar/ drum duo of John McLaughlin & Billy Cobham rather than 'Trane and Ali.) But there is no doubt that the album is inspired or, at least, possessed. Interstellar Space Revisited is a forward- thinking, millennial interpretation of Coltrane's later music. But the frontiers of jazz were so wildly transgressed a mere five years after Coltrane's death, and the album seems to constantly reference that first flowering of electrified jazz that occurred under the shadow of Miles rather than Coltrane. Nevertheless, the album is angularly beautiful in its own right and, for all the noise and tweaks, there is indeed a sense of humility in the playing. After all, how can you ape the spiritual questing of another? At best, you can ascend to modest heights and then humbly thank St. John Coltrane for achieving those grand astronomical reaches for the rest of us. And Cline and Bendian have achieved this, noisily, but with grace.",,7.9,

The symptoms have been reduced to a full-body sweat, a feverish chill, a swirling nausea, lack of appetite and the occasional dry-heave vomit session. This afternoon, as I lay on the couch watching a hypnotising episode of ""Judge Mills Lane"" (the one where the rich lady's dog, Buttercup, was mauled to death by this guy's Rottweilers), I thought, ""What better way to cure my pain than by listening to the latest Thrill Jockey release? Ah, there it is!"" My discman and headphones were being eaten by my fabulous $30 couch, and were stuffed under my pillow. Lying in the vicinity, Nobukazu Takemura's Scope. I remember a few of Takemura's remixes-- most notably, his remix of Roni Size's ""Brown Paper Bag."" They're usually crazed experimentations that leave behind only a fragment of the original song. I can't wait to see what happens when Takemura's given free reign to record whatever he wants. Drifting in and out of peaceful but fevered sleep, I listened with great ease to the five lengthy tracks. For the first half hour of Scope, I was lulled into an electric dreamland with bizarre mid-'80s special effects. But somewhere, I've heard this stuff before... the 22-minute opener, ""On a Balloon,"" sounds, well, exactly like a track off Oval's Dok. Exactly. And following, the 13-minute-long ""Kepler"" sounded remarkably like Tortoise's ""Ten Day Interval"" or Ghost's ""Daggma."" Suddenly, at ""Taw,"" Scope's third track, I shot up, stunned. Was this communication between primitive R2D2-type androids? Either that or some wanky moog experiment. After nine minutes of seemingly random robot noise, I find myself fast asleep once again. ""Icefall"" again cops Oval's trademark skipping CD noise, but uses it to a create a different effect-- this time, the skipping noise is a beautiful ambient coldness and is organized rhythmically. So, like Oval, but with sort of a Windy and Carl feel. Scope closes with the strangely medievil sounds of ""Tiddler,"" the album's shortest track. In as few words as possible: ending music for an old Nintendo game. It seems like Takemura's primary talent is building upon what's already been created by other artists. His concepts are taken directly from other artists, but what he creates with his concepts is pure talent. Except on ""Taw,"" which is jarring and unwelcome in this record's otherwise harmonious soundscape. Well, I gotta go take some Advil Cold & Sinus.

They're part of one of the more interesting band complexes around these days-- one which includes June of '44, the Sonora Pine and the now- defunct Rodan-- and both the core of this band and its many satellite members have proven themselves as excellent players and songwriters. Even so, Rachel's recordings have managed to disappoint and frustrate as often as they've managed to please. Their debut, Handwriting, was a solid record, pretty throughout and very often surprising; it's best moment, the 14+ minute- long ""Full on Night,"" is possibly the most satisfying fusion of strings, jazz guitar and found sound ever to grace my earholes. Their sophomore record, Music for Egon Shiele, stuck to a pretty straight- forward chamber music format and is in equal parts sublime and interminable. And then there was 1996's The Sea and the Bells, a double LP featuring a full orchestra of both traditional and bizarre instruments that should have been epic and expansive, and ended up being a little obnoxious. (Truth be told, I've never made it through to the album's last quarter.) Still, there are very few other bands doing what these guys are doing-- that being modern chamber music with an indie rock sensibility. For this reason, I continue to look forward hopefully to each new release. And with Selenography, Rachel's finally lives up to the promise suggested by Handwriting. Superficial details first: Selenography is a really great word, isn't it? The study of the physical features of the moon, the idea of selenography connotes a sort of Victorian hybrid of science and mysticism that perfectly fits the album's sound. The chamber music feel is still prevalent this time out; Christian Frederickson's violin continues to occupy the foreground, but the bottom end has filled in a bit, more tracks were recorded with a drum kit, and there's freer use of samples and other goodies. Tracks range from the vibraphone- and bleep- filled ambience of ""Artemisia"" to the more simple and lush piano/ strings/ trumpet combo of ""Cuts the Metal Cold"" to ""Honeysuckle Suite,"" which despite being a solo harsichord piece amazingly manages to avoid sounding like Mannheim Steamroller. Selenography, while covering a pretty wide range of instrumental textures, presents a more cohesive vision than anything Rachel's have offered so far. They've tightened their focus this time around and the payoff is substantial. If you're expecting something as highly experimental as The Sea and the Bells, Selenography will probably be kind of a letdown. But if you appreciated the austerity of Handwriting and have been searching for more, your hunt is over.","Rachel's is a band with an impressive pedigree and a spotty discography.

Talker,U.S. Maple,by: Nick Mirov,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a8f69d034d5c69bf3b85/1:1/w_160/ab571157.gif,1999-06-08 05:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8372-talker/,Drag CityDrag City,"And then there are those bands which make no sense at all, and in doing so build their own definition of ""making sense."" U.S. Maple willfully, stubbornly makes no sense-- but not in the cleverly obscurist way Pavement makes no sense, and not in the yammering, screeching, pummeling way the Boredoms make no sense. Talker, you see, goes to great lengths to sabotage language, both musical and verbal, and finds novel ways of failing to get its point across. Musically, U.S. Maple are the hapless losers in a three-legged race, with each trying to build momentum by pushing their instruments in different directions at different times. Guitarists Mark Shippy and Todd Rittmann play like they're getting their fingers caught in the strings; drummer Pat Samson plays like his kit keeps falling apart. Verbally, vocalist Al Johnson bypasses his voice box completely, his lungs and throat emitting an inscrutable wheeze. Even when you resort to scanning the lyric sheet, lyrics like, ""Your face is a country to camp/ So save your neck for tiger,"" are no more illuminating. And yet the culmination of all these no-sense-making factors results in an oddly visceral listening experience. Several images come to mind upon hearing U.S. Maple's fractured, gremlin-like sound. A final performance at the Rest Home for First-Generation Rock Stars (a 90-year-old Bob Dylan with throat cancer, Keith Richards trying to control his shaking, palsied hands long enough to muster a guitar riff, and Ringo Starr with Alzheimer's, repeatedly forgetting where the beat goes); Igor and the Hunchback of Notre Dame forming a band with the Elephant Man; the blues being raped by New York no wave and giving birth to the Shaggs; the sound of music imploding, turning itself inside out, being dipped in liquid nitrogen and dropped out of a five-story window.... Okay, so U.S. Maple is not as revolutionary as that last remark made it sound, but I seriously doubt you've heard anything like it before. Former Swans frontman Michael Gira produced Talker with a more restrained, skeletal feel than previous U.S. Maple albums, which makes it even sound even weirder. Before, the squelchy chaos would be piled on with lunatic glee; here, it's measured out in languorous doses, the empty spaces seeming to signify some sort of sonic decay eating away at the music. It may first sound like total trash, but the mere fact that it hangs together at all-- and the occasional moments where suddenly all the instruments are playing together in something resembling a melody-- hints at a deeper intelligence at work. Not too deep, but, y'know, deep enough.","And then there are those bands which make no sense at all, and in doing so build their own definition ...

The Amateur View,To Rococo Rot,by: Ryan Schreiber,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Founder</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a7c313d19756521394c5/1:1/w_160/812c00b5.gif,1999-06-08 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8080-the-amateur-view/,MuteCity SlangMuteCity Slang,"Well, there was a record-breaking heat wave across the nation on this final Fourth of July weekend of the millennium. Or so they kept telling me on CNN Headline News all day today. Yeah, I was feelin' it. Here in the heart of Chicago, we felt temperatures in the high 90's as gallons of sweat gushed from our pores in a futile attempt to cool our golden-plump, freshly roasted bodies. My living room, a sauna. In heat like this, there's only one thing you can do: aim a fan at yourself, take a cool bath, and listen to good music. Today, as I found my way into the cold bathtub water (is this creating a nice visual?), To Rococo Rot was there for me. The Amateur View is all part of a new German subgenre of ambient electronica called ""squirm."" The artists blend analog effects with warm, electronic drones and mechanic percussion for a sound that's unmistakably digital, yet 100% human. The Amateur View definitely finds itself on the more mellow end of the genre's mellow- to- spastic spectrum. Bands like Schneider TM and Slick Sixty possess a slightly more erratic and unpredictable sound than To Rococo Rot tend to display, but The Amateur View outdoes either of those bands' albums in sheer listening pleasure. The Amateur View seems to draw largely from Brian Eno's early ambient experiments, Ninja Tune-style electronic jazz and minimalist percussion-based outfits like Pan Sonic. This combination of influences is, in its own Pokemon-like way, deadly. Over the course of 11 tracks, you'll be led through another green world and into a sea of such remarkable tranquility, you'd think you were on a moonbase. The music's underwater, oceanic attributes are perfect for a day in the tub, lounging in your temperature-controlled environment, dreaming of a swim in a rural Minnesotan lake.

Agaetis Byrjun,Sigur Rós,by: Brent DiCrescenzo,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributing Editor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a3f9ea9e61561daa4dca/1:1/w_160/e17d9e74.jpeg,1999-06-01 05:00:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7151-agaetis-byrjun/,Krunk,"With their second album, Ágætis byrjun, Sigur Rós knew only that they wanted to make things bigger. Their first record, 1997’s Von, was dark and, by the standards of what they became famous for, positively screechy: Back then, they were inspired by the hurtling propulsion of Smashing Pumpkins and My Bloody Valentine, bands that generated soothing textures from cacophony. Von sold 300 copies in Iceland. But the dismal showing left no seeming dent on young Jónsi Birgisson’s confidence. The singer posted a salvo on the band’s website prior to Agaetis’ release: “We are simply gonna change music forever, and the way people think about music.” It’s alarming to consider, from the vantage of 2019, the degree to which he seems to have accomplished his mission. If we now live in a world of small, soft drones, a pruned garden of “Lush Lofi” and “Ambient Chill” and “Ethereal Vibes” Spotify playlists, we can blame this condition, at least in part, on the impact of Ágætis byrjun. It is an album that has terraformed our landscape—so much of our lives now sounds like it, from Nissan commercials to “Planet Earth” documentaries to the long trail of ads that could not procure Sigur Rós’ approval and went about constructing benign replicas of Sigur Rós songs instead. Before Ágætis, post-rock was a niche concern, a tiny sub-sub-genre centered around a dozen or so bands in England and North America—Stereolab, Bark Psychosis and a few others in London; Tortoise and Gastr del Sol in Chicago; Godspeed You! Black Emperor in Montreal. After Ágætis, the sound—massive, surging, triumphal; melancholic and soothing and mostly major-key; wreathed in strings and horns and ripe with melodrama and headlocking you into transcendence—is a global phenomenon. They opened for Radiohead; they turned down a slot on “Letterman” because the host wouldn’t give them enough time. They even appeared on “The Simpsons.” Twenty years into their career, they tour arenas and command a massive following. They are a cultural institution. It’s hard to know if Ágætis byrjun catalyzed the massive shifts that unfolded in its wake, or if those shifts were already brewing, in search of a seaworthy vessel to carry us wherever it was going. Today, Sigur Rós’ career seems like a natural and desirable trajectory: Get your music into the ears of some important people (in Sigur Rós’ case, it was celebrities like Brad Pitt and Gwyneth Paltrow); from there, your music might shoot outward into some large-scale and modestly experimental commercial film (Tom Cruise and Cameron Crowe’s Vanilla Sky); and then it can rain down into dozens and dozens of television shows via the diligent work of music supervisors. But when it all happened to Sigur Rós, it was all pretty new, and it was all happening to the music industry at the same time. To make the album itself, they recruited a keyboardist named Kjartan Sveinsson, who knew a lot more than they did about the things they were interested in—arrangements, composition, songs that sounded like cavernous day spas. They enlisted producer Ken Thomas, who started out as an assistant working on Queen albums before moving on to early industrial acts like Throbbing Gristle and Einstürzende Neubauten. He also mixed the first record by Björk’s early band the Sugarcubes, which is what led him to Sigur Rós. With Thomas, they built a record that felt like being stuck inside a church bell. Their enormous sound came not from size, but from scale. The distance between the quietest noises—the little cymbals ticking the eight notes on “Svefn-g-englar,” Birgisson’s falsetto—and the loudest ones—say, the drums and organ that land like Thor’s hammer about six minutes into the same track—feels measurable only in miles. It is a long, liquid sound, devoid of sharp points: Even the most massive dynamic shifts happen with rounded edges. The drums are nested inside so much reverb that you can nearly hear the air gathering around the snare head before impact. Birgisson played his electric guitar with a cello bow, which offered the sonorous tones of feedback without the disturbance of picks. It is thunderous and dreamy, soothing and stirring—a big, frosted wedding cake of mallet percussion and pianos and strings and piping, cooing vocals. It is a sound designed to overwhelm, and it does, which is probably how British critics ended up gasping that the music was “like God weeping tears of gold in heaven.” Music of this scale is never kind on the higher faculties. The album is a triumph, above all, of arrangement and engineering. When the piano kicks in on “Starálfur” (the same one that accompanies the discovery of the mythical jaguar shark in The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou), I still have to suppress a delighted giggle of wonder. It’s like watching an invasion of CGI superheroes, or (I imagine) revving a high-performance car and watching the speedometer float. It isn’t so much a sound as a special effect, and it communicates with your brain solely in dopamine floods. If you are inclined to sniff suspiciously around grandiose music, examining it for kitsch, you probably reeled away staggering from Sigur Rós, who proudly stink of it. This was another part of their appeal and their strength: The music is texturally complex, for sure, but the emotional framework is deliberately simple and clear. They are gloriously unafraid of blast-off. The piping melody that ends “Olsen Olsen,” doubled up with horns and a choir, is straight out of a Mannheim Steamroller Christmas album. Live, they maintained this communal feeling without sacrificing clarity. You can hear this in the live recording included in a generous and fulsome new 20th-anniversary reissue. The gig was June 12, 1999 at Reykjavík’s Íslenska Óperan—an album-release celebration. They were brand new to this material, but somehow they sounded as commanding then as they do now. The box set also includes reams of demos and half-finished versions of Ágætis byrjun—they provide a nice glimpse into the band’s working method, which was open-ended and involved multiple versions of the same song, some with or without vocals or at different speeds. Spending time with all of these raw tracks is a bit like opening up a “version history” in Google Docs—you learn a little bit about how the final product came to be, but it only serves to heighten your appreciation that you were spared the editing process. Parsing the re-release, I was drawn back to the album itself again. It doesn’t really require elaboration, or added context. It’s entire appeal lay in the sense that it dropped, immaculate and mysterious, from the sky. Unless you were Icelandic, you didn’t know what they were saying—and often not even then. On Ágætis, Birgisson famously dabbled in an invented language called Hopelandic—some on “Olsen Olsen,” and some lightly sprinkled throughout. This might have spurred some listeners on to discover “what he was saying,” but for most of us, he was saying whatever we heard. His words were not messages, they were bird calls. The single most indelible word Birgisson has ever sung—“tju”—is a gibberish syllable, a refrain from “Svefn-g-nglar” that sounded then and will always sound just like “It’s you.” There were no other meanings within to parse or contemplate—just a pretty sound. We heard ourselves in it.","Each Sunday, Pitchfork takes an in-depth look at a significant album from the past, and any record not in our archives is eligible.

"Hey Boy, Hey Girl EP",The Chemical Brothers,by: Zach Hooker,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a5955e6ef95969320b31/1:1/w_160/ad9f3527.gif,1999-06-01 05:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1415-hey-boy-hey-girl-ep/,Astralwerks,"Dear Professor Pitchfork, I'm sorry I missed class today, but I was passing a kidney stone and then my dog was sick, too. Here's my five paragraph essay assignment. I know we were supposed to write about a book that we really like, but I couldn't think of one so I wrote about my favorite CD. I hope that's OK. Thanks,
Toby Why I Like the Chemical Brothers
by Toby H. One CD that I really like a lot is by the Chemical Brothers. The name of the CD is called Hey Boy Hey Girl and it is really only a single from their most latest album. The reasons that it is such a good CD are that it has a lot of phat beats and sweet noises, but it also has a lot of symbolism. There are three songs on the CD. The first song is called ""Hey Boy Hey Girl"" which is also the name of the CD. This song starts out kind of plain, with just a guy talking over some sorta siren-y noises. The guy says ""Hey boy, hey girl... something something... DJs, here we go!"" He says that over and over, like about more than 10 times, and you'd think that you would get tired of it but you don't, because it sounds so cool. Then after he says ""Here we go!"" the last time, that's when the beat kicks in. I think that's really deep, because he says ""Here we go!"" and then the song starts to go. But my favorite part of the song is when in the middle, the beat kinda goes away and there's a soft part of the song. During that part there's just the high music parts and it sounds like it's getting farther away and then getting close again. I think the symbolism of the song is that boys and girls seem like they're different but then maybe they're not as different as you thought. The second song is called ""Flashback."" This song sounds different from the first song, because the first song is a party jam type song. ""Flashback"" is a fast song too, like a party song, but it's more serious. It's a little bit scary sounding, and it's about how drugs can make things scary, I think. The only words are of a chick who's saying ""flashback"" over and over, just like in the name of the song. Only she's kind of whispering it so it sounds creepy. The music is really weird and trippy sounding and there is symbolism of somebody who is having a flashback from drugs. The third and last song is my favorite song on the CD. It is called ""Scale."" There are no words in the song, but it is cool because the music is of somebody playing a scale, which is what the title means. This song does not have the same kinds of big beats that the other two songs have, but it has lots of different parts. It sounds like there are two or three different scales that get played. All of the scales go up and not down, which I think means something. This song is really experimental, and it reminds me of my other favorite band, the Alan Parsons Project. In conclusion, Hey Boy Hey Girl is a good CD because it is good to dance to, or just to hang out to while drinking some brews with my house brothers, or even to study to, but it is mostly good because of its many meanings and symbolism.","*Dear Professor Pitchfork,

Livro,Caetano Veloso,by: Brent DiCrescenzo,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a92fc0084474cd0c0fb9/1:1/w_160/c72ed2dd.gif,1999-06-01 05:00:03,Global,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8428-livro/,AtlanticNonesuch,"I heard somewhere that a person's tastes change every seven years. This would explain the sudden appeal of mushrooms, baseball, coffee, and Brit-pop a few years ago. And I believe it was in a Cellular Biology class where I learned that every seven years the molecules that constitute your body are completely renewed. That's pretty cool. Not one single atom that made up ""you"" in 1982 was there in 1989. This could explain the lifespan of widespread clothing fads, such as grunge, baggy pants, bellbottoms, and hippy scraps. Think about it: the Beatles lasted... oh, around seven years. These two scientific theories must correlate. I have my own theory that involves a little more ontological thought. Trapped into each atom in your body, floating in that vast subatomic void between shooting-star electrons and deeply peaceful neutrons, is a little piece of your soul. As new atoms spin and crash into your mass, knocking off and replacing older chunks, you pick up tiny fractions of other souls. In seven years' time, enough broccoli-loving souls may have plummeted into your originally- broccoli- hating system of souls to make you a broccoli freak. The question is raised of why these new souls don't completely make a new ""you."" Why wouldn't the millions of soul-nuggets you pick up knock your original being into others, the air, space, etc? Well, they do. Old pieces of you are now a nebula or German or plantain. But these new soul pieces are greatly outnumbered by your original soul, and they taught how to be ""you"" while still keeping elements of their old entity. Now, you may be wondering where this idea is heading in relation to a Caetano Veloso review. Seven years ago, I was listening to Helmet, Fugazi, Firehose, and punk rock in high school. If you had told me that in 1999, I would be falling in love with a Brazilian album, I would have put a steel-toe in your glutes.* But here I am, telling you that if you buy any international album this year, or buy any album this week for that matter, make it Caetano Veloso. I would expect two questions to be raised by the reader at this point: first, ""Where did you pick up atoms of Brazilian souls?""; second, ""Why don't more peoples' tastes drastically change? For example, Brent, a suburban white girl who liked New Kids on the Block in her youth has subsequently gone through stages of Billy Joel, Sponge, Hootie, Live, Barenaked Ladies, and Dave Matthews Band fascinations-- she's not exactly jumping off the mainstream radio ship."" I can answer those questions with one answer: I've traveled quite a bit in my time. I've entered nine foreign countries and have been in a good number of international airports. My hometown of Atlanta also hosted the 1996 Summer Games, where countless Brazilian and other South American peoples popped up to root for their long-distance runners and ""futbol"" players. A kid from Ecuador roomed across from me in college. I got my international soul molecules in those instances, where as that Hootie-rock girl has most likely never left the safe confines of Wisconsin malls and sorority houses. She's just getting soul molecules much like her own. Of course, there's another explanation. Perhaps on each copy of Livro dwell sunny, tropical molecules from Caetano himself. The soul of a musician with such happy passion can generate enough escape velocity energy to send his soul satellites and probes rocketing from pore and mouth. They are kept safe in the disc until you crack it open and release these Caetano soul astronauts through headphones, shooting them down your cochlea, surrendering to them your brain and feelings. I'm trying to imagine Ryan Pitchfork's reaction when he reads that I gave a Brazilian disc a 9.0. Ryan once told me that he hates World Beat. Ryan, baby, this isn't World Beat! This isn't some bongos n' acoustic jam off a Starbucks ""Music From the Countries We Exploit for Beans"" sampler. Caetano Veloso's style has been tagged ""Afro-Brazilian"" by genre freaks such as the All-Music Guide. That is to say that African rhythms fuse with sorrowful, minor-key Portugese fado and traditional, breezy Brazilian Bossa Nova. Don't worry, though, there are several reference points for indie-rock Americans. An air of Burt Bacharach wafts throughout songs like ""Livros"" and the opening track, ""Os Passistas."" Effortless strings and arrangements sweep over popping percussion. You can even hear the rhythms of Tricky or Bjork in ""Livros,"" with its happily loose loops and rolling snares. The vibraphone, xylophone, and slow- plucked zither on ""Um Tom"" would fit perfectly on a Tortoise album. But unlike Tortoise, Veloso injects his delicate jam with soul, warmth, and his cottony, cherubic voice. After being bogged down with piles of stale rock at our Pitchfork apartment, these wonderfully alien rhythms and graceful guitar pluckings are a savior. I have to admit that I've been in a bit of a funk recently. Hospital bills, car thefts, accumulating rent, credit card debt, lame job, no girlfriend-- it's been adding up. But for the one hour I sipped on Caetano Veloso's aural absinthe through my headphones, I had a beaming smile and all was forgotten as I listened to the swirling layers of handclaps, drums, guitar, strings, and Brazilian tongues. And honestly, ever since then I've been a happy chap. (That's so sappy. I hope I made some of you wince.) This disc will also do it for audio freaks out there into complex compositions, detailed production, and original chord phrasings. The guy fills the ""brilliant"" cliché. But this album is just so happy. Of course, for all I know, he's singing about dead wives. Somehow, I doubt it. [ Actually, this is an exaggeration of how tough Brent really was in high school. In this situation, Brent would have most likely mumbled ""Nuh-Uh"" and run down the hall, flailing his forearms like a sissy. He also never wore black boots, but beaten-up Airwalks. -Ed.]*","I heard somewhere that a person's tastes change every seven years. This would explain the sudden appeal of mushrooms ...

Play,Moby,by: Brent DiCrescenzo,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c363eb335119a49ed6ce/1:1/w_160/16c570ba.jpg,1999-06-01 05:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5344-play/,V2,"For those Connecticut hardcore kids (of what I like to call the ""Hartcord"" scene) who don't know, the drummer from the Pork Guys moonlights as a techno superstar! Believe it or not, but when he's not playing New England basements, Moby entertains thousands of dopamine- intake- inhibited kids. Although his musical output has been varied in sound, it's been predictable in emotion and execution. One can always count on an album full of filler, a few buried dance gems, over- thought moods, some preaching, and banal new- age tendencies. It's commendable of Moby to make each album a unified experiment, but imagine how great an LP of his career's best bits would be. Instead we're consistently left with ""the ambient stuff,"" ""the house stuff,"" ""the punk stuff,"" and now ""the blues stuff."" Play opens with the butt- shuffling ""Honey."" A stuttering bass line and thudding piano shouts out ""nas-tee!"" (It also mummbles, ""Fatboy Slim does this sort of thing better."") Picture products spinning over a stark, white background. The next few tracks keep up a sweaty, soulful pace. ""Porcelain"" tenderly glides down throats like lithium. ""South Side"" is the closest Moby has come to writing a radio- friendly pop song. ""Why Does My Heart Feel So Bad"" asks just that in an ad nauseum sample loop over some hip-hop beats, syrupy synthesizer, and blues guitar. Okay, so what we have so far are the makings of a great EP. But from here on out, the album deliquesces into a warm puddle of generic ambient, techno, and trip-hop (mostly ambient). The throbbing ""Machete"" rips off Underworld as much as legally possible. The somber ""7"" offers only brief respite from higher dbs and bpms. Moby's flaw is that he comes across as too genuine-- too wholesome. Play tries to juggle an academic love of music history, a primal desire to groove, a uniform movement towards the ""peaceful"" and ""beautiful,"" vegan manifestos, and studio wizardry. Thus, we are left with the aural equivalent of a ""For Better or For Worse"" cartoon or a romantic comedy. If only Moby would tip the scale in any one direction. The sampling and processing of passionate folk and blues roots music drains whatever emotional ballast kept the music so spiritually afloat; although, this is more of the fault of innate digital recording techniques than Moby's talent. A performance loses raw magnetism after being chopped up in ProTools, cut from its atmosphere, cleaned, and gutted from its accompanying guitar. After this process, the blues on Play become nothing more than a quirky sample. The fact that he added gobs of synthesized mayonnaise doesn't help, either. Ultimately, Play's best moments are 100% Moby. Y'see, Moby has talent. What he needs is an editor and some of that good ol' fashioned Pork Guys punk energy. Without those essential ingredients, Play offers only one intriguing listen. In short, it's fun and functional, yet disposable: Play is the condom of rock.","For those Connecticut hardcore kids (of what I like to call the ""Hartcord"" scene) who don't know, the drummer ...

In between scratching her ankles and shooing away mosquitos, Vicki stared at the Fourth of July night sky, waiting for the local fireworks to begin. The fireworks hadn't been that good the past few years. At least, not as good as she'd remembered them growing up back in Milwaukee. The fireworks there had been perfect. This was either due to Milwaukee's inherent perfectness or the fact that they were the only other fireworks Vicki had to use as a reference in musings on fireworks. And compared to the Milwaukee tufts of red, green, blue, and white, San Mateo's M-80s couldn't hold a roman candle to them. It was a quiet night. Pretty quiet. Hmm... no. It wasn't that quiet. That guy next door was making some kind of racket. Vicki sat up and looked to the fence. He was moving around in his backyard setting up equipment and stuff. What was he doing? Vicki noticed some pole sticking up in the corner of his yard. There was one in the other corner, too. Were they lightning rods? Vicki got up and walked to the fence, expecting her neighbor to have a mad scientist table in the middle of his yard with some half-cat, half-dog creature on it waiting to be re-animated. ""What are you doing?"" ""I'm gonna record the fireworks!"" ""Ohhh, so those are microphones?"" Vicki understood now, kind of. ""Yeah."" ""Where's the camera?"" ""Oh, no camera. I'm recording the sound to put on my next album."" ""Album? You're a musician?"" Vicki jumped over the fence into his yard. ""Careful, there. Yeah, I am. I want to use the sounds of the fireworks as background noise in a song. I'll probably make it a long last song to close the album."" ""What's your name?"" ""Marc."" ""I'm Vicki. What kind of band are you in?"" ""Well, it's just me. I record stuff in layers."" ""Doesn't sound like much of a band. Let me hear some."" ""Hold on."" Vicki looked around the back yard. A guitar sat in a chair as if it was waiting for something to happen. The fireworks, maybe? ""Here you go."" Marc handed her a discman and some headhphones. ""These are the first seven tracks for my new album. I burned them this morning. After tonight I think I'll be ready to finish it."" Vicki put the headphones on and lay in the grass to look up at the sky again while Marc went back to setting up. The first track began-- sounds of ocean waves and seagulls took her back to one summer sitting just above the waterline on a rocky beach in Maine. Two notes from a keyboard piano drifted through her head like the sound of a channel marker buoy. This was followed by sustained organ chords and a soft, strummy guitar. She closed her eyes and it was night on that beach in Maine. She was looking for Haley's comet with her dad. ""What do you think?"" Vicki turned to look at her dad. Oh. It was her neighbor. ""Uh, it sounds cool. Really spacy. It kind of reminds me of this band my friend Paul always plays. I can't remember what they're called. Some Spanish word or something like that."" ""Uh, Yo La Tengo?"" ""Yeah. That's it. I think I like your stuff more, though. It seems to go places faster. Or at least have an idea of where it's going. I always thought that Yo Tango band was kind of boring. But then, I never listened to it under a night sky in my neighbor's backyard. When do you think those fireworks will start?"" ""Any minute, I hope."" He went back to his microphone setup while Vicki lay back down with the headphones. The tempo of the second song matched the first. As did the third and fourth. Eight measure phrases wound around and around her head like the ""Dr. Who"" theme did when she was twelve, bringing back memories of nightmares that show brought her every time she watched it. POOOOSSSSSSSSSSHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!! The first firework went off. Marc ran inside to start his equipment. Vicki watched the light fade from the puff of light in the sky. The music had her in a dream. It seemed to fill her surroundings without shutting them out, filling all the empty night spaces. She didn't notice the rest of the firework display banging above her. She didn't notice other people now coming into the backyard.

The Only Reason I Feel Secure EP,Pedro the Lion,by: Zach Hooker,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a1feea9e61561daa4920/1:1/w_160/c179526d.jpg,1999-06-01 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6213-the-only-reason-i-feel-secure-ep/,Made in MexicoMade in Mexico,"I was going through the magazine rack at local place recently and I came across one of those sound-byte- type quotes from David Bowie where he basically said, on the subject of art, that you either like a piece or you don't. He's right, y'know. You can sit around for days on end in some basement apartment smoking opium and launching half- baked theories about Russian rockets all jerry- rigged and desperate for funding, but in the end, it comes down to ""I like this"" or ""I don't like this."" It's usually hopeless to try to convince somebody otherwise when they've decided to say ""I like this"" when they should be saying, ""I don't like this."" And vice as they say, versa. What do you stand to gain from succeeding in that argument, anyway? Unless you're selling mortgages or something. Music's the same way. I mean, you either like Fleetwood Mac, or you don't like Fleetwood Mac. Nobody wants to hear why-- it doesn't matter why. ""Why"" only matters to the people who are selling music-- it's crucial demographic info for those people. Personally, over my many years of music fandom, I've developed a similar binary system for evaluating bands. Rather than being coded in terms of ""like"" and ""don't like,"" my system is coded in terms of a certain elusive state I've taken to calling ""That Feel."" I'm not positive what That Feel is, but I know beyond a shadow of a doubt, and usually instantly, whether or not a band gives me That Feel. And it's not a scale, y'know? A band can't fall somewhere along the That Feel/ No That Feel continuum. It's all or nothing, baby. Sink or swim. That Feel or No That Feel. But what, Mr. Spooky, has this got to do with you? Very little, I suppose. Except this, specifically: Pedro the Lion gives me That Feel. Alright, that's not much to go on. Maybe it would help to say that That Feel is vaguely melancholy, with no small amount of nostalgia, and a deeply buried and even more deeply inarticulate core of faith in something better. Maybe it would even help to talk about the band's sparse, sweet, melodic guitars, the wide- open spaces between their snare and their high-hat, their unassuming but solid bass, and David Bazan's quietly caustic lyrics. I could even spend some time drawing obvious parallels between Pedro the Lion, Red House Painters, and American Music Club. I could comment that this EP's last track is the first time in a long time that I haven't found myself turned off by overt religion in music. I could praise the editorial spirit, so lacking in pop music, that allows this little 20- minute- long gem to remain consistently and uniformly compelling. Et cetera, et cetera. It's all true, of course. I just think it misses the heart of the matter. Which, of course, is That Feel. I like Pedro the Lion. Pedro the Lion gives me That Feel. That Feel is the only important thing. Don't you want That Feel? Feel That Feel! Feel it!

Performance and Cocktails,Stereophonics,by: Brent DiCrescenzo,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a56d13d1975652138f57/1:1/w_160/bced8d28.gif,1999-05-25 06:01:40,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7507-performance-and-cocktails/,V2,"Sometimes brown things can be quite good. I'm writing this review on a bellyful of Cocoa Pebbles and its accompanying cocoa- stained milk. The Cleveland Browns used to be pretty good. I had a St. Louis Browns fitted ballcap back in high school because my grandfather told me that they once put in a midget batter. But when it comes to music, brown-- or any of its shades (khaki, tan, taupe, burnt sienna, etc.)-- is the last color I want to hear. The Stereophonics just sound very brown, and in the worst way. As Shakespeare's Benedick proclaims in ""Much Ado About Nothing,"" ""Why, I'faith, methinks [Performance and Cocktails is] too low for a high praise, too brown for a fair praise, and too little for a great praise."" Exactly! Shakespeare knew what I was talking about. Listening to Performance and Cocktails is similar to sucking on a folded up pair of Gap Khakis. The title alone suggests that the band might be in the business for the riders alone. That said, there are two types of rock bands that come from Wales. The first and more exciting faction is the goofy psychedelic pop front with the Super Furry Animals and Gorki's Zygotik Mynci. Those bands slip into their native tongue occasionally, weaving a slight mystical, elven vibe. Pompous stadium rock bands constitute the second bunch of Welsh rock groups. The Manic Street Preachers lead this pack, with the Stereophonics trailing some millions of records behind in sales figures. But at least the Manics manage to infuse feelings of ennui and burnt- out intellectualism into their arena rock, which perhaps comes from the fact that one of the band's founding members used to carve stuff into his arms with razors before disappearing into the Himalayas a few years ago. The Stereophonics manage to infuse, well, lots of brown and tan into their music. Listening to Performance and Cocktails makes you raise a pint in the air, throw an arm around a mate, wear a soccer flag as a cape, and remin... um, nah. It makes you nod your head and remark, ""Yep, this is rock music."" Strangely, these guys sound both extremely British and extremely American. Kelley Jones' gusting sneer mixes the whiny drawls of British chart- toppers with the over- the- top alterna- crooning of American wannabe- chart- toppers. Fittingly, his lyrics straddle that Atlantic line between England's vapid ""everybody feel good"" rock poetry and the insipid storytelling of Yankee FM radio. In the opening track, Jones belts out, ""Roll up and sheeee-ine."" ""Shine"" is the official meaningless, overused word in Britrock. Of course, it could be worse-- he could rhyme it with ""mind,"" (the second most meaningless and overused word in Britrock) like so many Noel Gallagher tracks. The song ends up sounding frighteningly like a trans- oceanic hybrid of Oasis and the Verve Pipe, and nothing good can come from that congress. What two bands does ""The Bartender and the Thief"" bring to mind, you ask? Simply enough, Our Lady Peace and Supergrass. The album continues with an overwhelming assault of whines and chords that neither stick nor particularly rock. The production tastes like Guinness (which, okay, is Irish)-- roasted, bitter, and heavy. They also stick with the Britrock standards on the guitar tracks, which invariably sound like distorted lead or acoustic tin. Again, Benedick said it best: ""Is it not strange that sheep's gut should hale souls out of men's bodies?"" I mean, maybe at some point, aggressive strumming and its resulting volume corresponded to emotional outpouring, but let's face it: we've heard this stuff a hundred times before. Basically, what Performance and Cocktails boils down to is loud music engineered and crafted for Britain's summer festival circuit that practically guarantees a perennially muddy experience. Picture it: as the Stereophonics chug soupy chords from the main stage, skinny drunk kids line up for the Portaloos, caked in brown. There you have it.","Sometimes brown things can be quite good.

In the Fishtank,The ExTortoise,by: Mark Richardson,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a7e69d034d5c69bf38f0/1:1/w_160/f678efd5.gif,1999-05-18 05:00:02,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8116-in-the-fishtank/,Touch and GoKonkurrent,"This collaboration was written and recorded in a 48-hour period in 1998 as part of Dutch label Konkurrent's In the Fishtank series. I'm not too familiar with the Ex, but I understand them to be hyper-political band from Holland of, I believe, either anarchist or Marxist orientation. Oh, and they rock. This alone makes the pairing with Tortoise-- who seem to be getting colder, slicker and quieter with each album-- a little odd. But the alliance, though strange and probably pointless in the long run, does make for a relatively intriguing listen. ""The Lawn of the Limp,"" an abrasive instrumental in which we get to hear the members of Tortoise rocking out with something approaching balls, opens the record. Here, as on the bulk of the EP, it seems as though the Ex side of the equation presides. Ditto for ""Pooh Song,"" a screaming rant with some real bite that's impossible to imagine on a Tortoise album. And the truly bizarre ""Central Heating"" has what sounds like a muted Miles Davis solo being annihilated by brutally heavy guitars. This spread is crunchy, not smooth. ""Pleasure As Usual,"" on the other hand, is more in the traditional Windy City vein, with a throbbing bass and plenty of space; in fact, it bears a strong resemblance those early Tortoise 7""s that had vocals and sounded like Slint. Likewise, ""Huge Hidden Spaces"" begins with some DJ-ish tape manipulation, and generally meanders in a more pleasing ambient vein. Overall, this is something I imagine Ex fans will dig a little more heavily; but truthfully, I doubt even they won't be throwing it on five years from now. Well, what did you expect from two days of fucking around in the studio?","

Or it could have been the cheese curds. Or possibly, it was the kif... but at some point in the two years since I wrote the Pitchfork review of Banco De Gaia's Big Men Cry, Toby Marks went from soundtracking my walk through Wal-Mart, to orchestrating my synapses. (If you're not following this, it's only 'cause you haven't read the aforementioned review, which can be found, as always, in the Pitchfork review archive.) I had this velvet poster and a blacklight, and I touched it, and it was like... wow, man! The sounds of Banco De Gaia emanated from the speakers, dragging my brain around by its stem and slapping it into the corners of the room with layer upon heavy layer of percussion, chanting, lilting melodies. Everything was syncopating into weird textures like a fine Sumatran dish, the seasonings plugging me deeply into its... oneness. And it didn't stop-- no, it didn't stop. Not today, not now or ever. Whenever I heard it, it plugged me back in and the sound overcame me. I guess some would lump The Magical Sounds of Banco De Gaia in with ""techno."" Penetr8ing Gaze Man would surely call it techn-o. But it's so organic, so natural and flowing. But it doesn't qualify as ambient, either. It's not just a flow of mysterious frightening notes meant to be a backdrop to daily life. I mean, it's like that, but not really. Better, really. Really better. [Lay off the crack pipe, James! -Ed.] And sometimes it makes me laugh, I hear the frogs singing and the evangelists shouting for their souls and the rainforest birds calling... and I don't know what it means that Banco is plugged into my personal rhythm... I just don't know, but it can't be bad. It's eclectic and dense, filled with bits I'll wouldn't understand, things I couldn't understand, things I shouldn't understand. Like the soft grey thing that rides around in my skull and comprises most of what I believe to be my personality. No, it can't be bad. Toby Marks is just tuned in, operating at precisely the right bandwidth. No, not bandwidth-- he's in geosynchronious orbit. Yeah, two spheres circling one another, grokking off their magnetism, acting and reacting, the rhythms, the chants, they fill my mind... so much confusion... so much harmony... I remember that Big Men Cry review I wrote and the letters people sent. They said they liked it for the most part, and that was nice, but maybe I missed the mark. Maybe Toby was creating something deeper than I even knew. But the letters made me very happy and if you wrote one, thank you now, thank you then, and thank you forever, good people. I speak to you now: know that The Magical Sounds has a little more juice to it. Know that it's a little heavier in the beats. But also know that I miss Dick Parry's sax. I'm tuned in-- don't get me wrong-- but the sax on Big Men Cry is what turned it into something truly special. Yeah, this is another great Banco album, and it has reached me as few electro albums can.

Places to Visit EP,Saint Etienne,by: Zach Hooker,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a339ea9e61561daa4c20/1:1/w_160/25c07720.gif,1999-05-14 06:01:40,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6971-places-to-visit-ep/,Sub Pop,"Frankly, I had just about forgotten Saint Etienne. It wasn't their fault, really, it was mine. 1992's excellent Foxbase Alpha kept me interested for a while back in the day, but right about the time of its release, I got distracted (along with the rest of the country) by the apparent triumph of that newfangled alter-native music. Saint Etienne's dancy interpretation of 60's pop was then silently buried under a mudslide of rawk, and I mostly tracked with the masses as they followed Kurdt to an early grave. Obviously, the kids of Saint Etienne completely failed to notice my absence. They kept plugging away without me, honing their house- inflected Bacharachalia to a keen edge. Their recent signing to Sub Pop brought them back to my attention, though, and I backtracked from last year's Good Humor to find a couple of pretty solid albums. Sure, their albums are largely style- over- substance affairs, but they're exactly what a musical sweet tooth might want to hear. Unfortunately, this Places to Visit EP doesn't quite measure up to its predecessors. Here's the problem: it's hard to establish a solid stylish victory with a running time of 21 minutes. Sure, it's only an EP, but these six songs just flit by, several of them ending right about the same time they really start to work. And of the six tracks, only three are proper songs-- the balance are basically transitional instrumentals. At least two of the ""proper songs""-- namely ""52 Pilot"" and ""Sadie's Anniversary""-- are really excellent: the former is a marimba- filled mid-tempo jam, and the latter a full-on torch song with big, juicy bass and an excellent chorus. The third, ""We're in the City,"" is just a pretty standard Saint Etienne neo-disco number (read: it's good but not particularly memorable). The other three tracks-- the instrumental ones-- are really what brings the EP down. Why? Well, because they're so good. That's right, you heard me. They're great songs, adding an experimental flourish to the sound with supplemental studio trickiness. They're just not developed enough-- they're too short, and the goodness ends up more a tease than a truly satisfying listen. If we're lucky, Places to Visit represents the direction Saint Etienne is headed with their next album. Until then, this sampling will likely just leave its listeners frustrated. Those who hear it and find themselves wanting more should do themselves a favor and check out Combustible Edison's The Impossible World, an album which attempts some similar experiments and also manages to sustain them over the course of an album.","Frankly, I had just about forgotten Saint Etienne.

Will You Still Love Me EP,Julie Doiron,by: Zach Hooker,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b9e75e6ef95969322a8f/1:1/w_160/7fdec595.gif,1999-05-11 06:01:40,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2403-will-you-still-love-me-ep/,TreeTree,"So I guess it's Autumn at this point. Gone are the carefree days of summer with their summeriness-- pick-up volleyball games and sunburns and screaming kids and stinging insects and whatnot. Days are getting shorter, college kids are honing their testbook theft schemes, and miller moths are beginning to invade. All around the world, squirrels and chipmunks are frittering away the last autumn ever, gathering nuts and nesting material to sustain them past New Millennium's Eve and through the Eternal Winter which will soon descend upon us all. If you're anything like me, Autumn is the time when your will to rock begins to ebb, just a little bit. It's a time to wax all introspective and shit-- to watch some leaves falling and to think about your own mortality. The weeds grow in your bay laurel's pot, the world refuses to behave in the clean and orderly fashion described by mathematics, and the universe's possibly inevitable heat- death descend upon us. Autumn is the sad, slowish song that makes all the punks quit moshing for a second and lean against each other, panting and sweaty and just a little bit wistful. It's a good time for Julie Doiron's latest EP. I mean, if it were still summer and somebody put on Will You Still Love Me?, well, that would pretty much be the end of the barbecue, wouldn't it? You'd grab your beer and your corn- on- the- cob and wander off down the block, looking for some more rockin' company. But now there's a chill in the air, and we're sitting out on the front stoop, and we're willing to tolerate-- hell, even welcome-- a little bit of sparse acoustic songstress action while we polish off the keg in relative silence and watch the grill smoke itself out. So. Will You Still Love Me? is five songs, mostly guitar with some scattered vibes and bass. Julie Doiron sings the songs, and her voice is pretty even if you have to strain to catch what she's saying. I caught enough to be sure that the lyrics weren't nearly as self- indulgent as I'd been afraid they would be. The songs are short, and if you're not paying attention you might not be able to tell when one stops and the next starts, but they're very pretty. Of course, some albums really do have limited utility. This one's great for a night in with the cat (or the dog or the hermit crabs or whatever). But eventually your Autumnal mood will fade, your will to rock will return, and you may not come back to Julie Doiron until next year. If there is a next year.","So I guess it's Autumn at this point.

A couple of Bud Lights, something to read, and a stack of drone music records and I'm fine. But while I'm down with the ambient shit, I've finally admitted to myself that I'm not down with Labradford. Plenty of people-- good people-- drool over what these guys have going on. They speak of the subtle beauty of the recordings, the majestic instrumentation, and the beautiful structure of the songs. But the bulk of their output to this point has bored me, and I'm sorry to report that E Luxo So is no different. In theory, E Luxo So sounds like an interesting exercise in musical restraint. As a whole, it's even more subdued than its far- from- manic predecessors. There's no shift in dynamic range on the record, and there's never either an abundance or lack of ""space."" Vocals, which have always been spare, have been jettisoned altogether. Subtlety is not only the name of the game on E Luxo So, it's the name of the planet the game is played on. But while there's certainly something to be said for quiet restraint, it can't be defended when the music becomes boring, and that's what happens here. It's interesting-- Labradford's music is often described as ""cinematic,"" and I think that's true if you define ""cinematic"" as ""music best appreciated with images."" I can see the songs on E Luxo So playing behind some indie film set in the desert outside Tucson, AZ. It would set a certain dry mood for the spare drama. But when I think of cinematic music, I think of DJ Shadow, Godspeed You Black Emperor!, and a host of others whose music is rich and complex enough to conjure images, and not just make you wish for them. The majority of E Luxo So's songs consist of variations on western- sounding guitar, spare piano, strings, and the occasional treated electronic flourish, but it just doesn't add up to much. It soothes but never challenges. It's subtly complex but ultimately not rewarding. That said, the beautiful gospel- tinged ""Dulcimers Played by Peter Neff, Strings Played"" certainly adds up to something, and the treated distortion added to ""By Chris Johnston, Craig Markva, Jamie Evans"" (the song- title- as- album- credits gimmick is a little painful, of course) sounds interesting surrounded by more conventional instrumentation. But all told, there are other people making music in this vein, and doing a better job of it.","I like to consider myself a connoisseur of the chill- out experience.

Laser shows, friends-- that's what textural sounds without voices were made for. Too much of the music made by the post- rock heavies seems like a mere academic exercise; rare equations mapped out on paper but never allowed to drift wild in the true vacuum of space. And then there's Cul De Sac. When I listen to Crashes to Light, Minutes to Its Fall I can see the projected stars and hear a booming narrator's voice directing me to the Andromoda galaxy; I can taste the dry- cap belches and catch the glowing exit signs moving in circles, leaving crimson trails behind. It's a wonderful thing to find a band like Cul De Sac, who see music as a journey or, if you like, as a trip. One to sign up for. So, what's there secret? What makes Crashes stand out among the boring noodlers that have sprung from the indie rock woodwork? It's the fact that the sounds they make conjure such clear pictures-- the sound of the cinema. The contemporary reference points are easy (Tortoise, Labradford, etc.) but Cul De Sac manage to give nearly every piece a special little twist. ""Etaion Shrdlu"" begins with a very Eastern, sitar- like guitar sound that builds into a rumbling steamroller of a groove, ""K"" twirls hypnotic and beautiful guitar lines around each other like a psychedelic pottery wheel, and ""Hagstrom"" packs the rhythmic punch of early '70s Can. These songs average in the eight- minute range, and it's time well spent. Of course, it wouldn't be an instrumental rock album without a couple of flat- out snoozers, and the record has exactly two-- not exactly a bad ratio in this genre. The songs incorporate guitar, bass, drums, synthesizers, autoharps, samplers, U.S. Navy practice bombs, human ribs... the list goes on, and damn if you can't hear every last detail.

Not in that they're beast- like-- they don't bear any of the scary child- molester vibe of a Mick Jagger or Steven Tyler. They don't seem to be foul mannered, and as far as I know, they don't drool. ""What is this?"" you say, in a thick Hungarian accent. ""Why you say beess, when you say they are no beess- like?"" For those looking for clues as to what I mean, I suggest you check out any recording with either of these two jazz giant's names attached to them. Feeling lazy? Check out the cover. Look at Shipp, face contorted in ""I am rocking out"" bliss, arms all tense and agile. Parker's photo on the back is, admittedly not as shit hot. But that's no matter. When I say these men are beasts, I pay them the highest compliment. These are two men whose prodigal talent is so monstrous, it's oughta be put in a ""Scary Stories"" book between ""The Girl Who Died of Terror When Her Friends Stabbed Her Skirt into the Ground With a Knife in the Graveyard"" and ""The Golden Arm."" Whereas Mr. Wynton Marsalis proceeds to turn jazz into static classical music with his note- for- note renditions of Coltrane's early standards, guys like Shipp and Parker embody the adventurous spirit that made jazz's greats so unique in their time. Both were involved (along with this amazing female drummer whose name escapes me right now) in the last staggering Matthew Shipp Trio record which artfully melded ambitious melodic phrasing and dissonant improvisation with remarkable ease. This is not the type of stuff that you hear in your bougie coffee house. And good luck trying to fuck to it-- you'll be floored in blissful Hungarian impotence. This time, they've ditched the drums, with the aim of exploring their improvisational technique. Given that there's only piano and bass, you might be wondering how interesting this would be. And admittedly, it's not for everybody. Everybody sucks, anyway. But what you get is a solid collection of wonderful sonic experiments which explore both the limits and the possibilities of their construction. Bookended by two skewed takes on traditional songs (""When Johnny Comes Marching Home"" and ""Amazing Grace""), DNA is sometimes hauntingly beautiful, other times disturbing, but consistently challenging and interesting. ""Cell Sequence"" is a subdued piece guided by Shipp's meandering, fluid lines and Parker's punctuated bass riffs. ""Orbit"" is the closest the avant- garde will ever get to funk-- a seemingly dischordant melody guided by Shipp's stabbing piano rhythms. ""Mr. Chromosome"" shows Shipp at his most playful, using his piano to make the kind of random, bleeping that you'd find in a documentary about cell division. About halfway through, you begin to realize that Shipp must have really fast, smart hands. And then he catches a melody, Parker kicks in with a deft plunk on the ol' upright, and just when you're getting into it, there's a ferocious mashing of the keys. In an age when improvisation is synonymous with either out- and- out wankery or the talent displayed by the guy on ""Sesame Street"" who bangs his head on the piano, DNA captures two beasts who understand how to make a glorious, smart and beautiful record. We're pleasantly scared.","Pianist Matthew Shipp and bassist William Parker are truly beasts. Not in that they're beast- like-- they don't ...

Raised in a sea of Neil Young's rumbling rockers and rustic ballads, country rock seems like the natural state of music to me, with other genres and subgenres bastardizing its bedrock and branching out into the expanse. As flawed as I have to admit that feeling is, I have no control over myself. I'm a sucker for the harmonica. Play me a mandolin and I'm as pliable and receptive as a divorcee in the back seat of her stockbroker's BMW. (My friends tell me it's quite a sight.) So, I should love the latest Old 97's release, Fight Songs. The band's named after a train, for Christ's sake, and after their clever and tuneful Too Far to Care, I waited with baited breath for its follow up. And waited. And waited. Finally-- and mysteriously covered in Bolivian stamps-- the package from Pitchfork arrived. Tossing the remainder of the package's contents somewhere I hope to locate again soon, I grabbed Fight Songs and shoved it in the stereo. Now, when the latest breed of country rockers sprung out of who- knows- where in the late '80s, the critics occasionally called it ""insurgent country,"" other times ""alt-country,"" and, on rare occasions, even ""country punk."" But what emanated from my speakers that fateful night was neither insurgent nor alt, and it was most certainly a far cry from punk. But enough of what Fight Songs isn't. What Fight Songs amounts to is a collection of insipidly pleasant, well- executed pop songs of some distant relation to country and, as such, a harrowing disappointment. Gone is Rhett Miller's quirky wordplay-- it's replaced with platitudes aplenty. Miller's vocals, a welcome respite over the edgier tunes gracing Too Far to Care, abets the band's pop intentions, only exacerbating matters. The album's opener, ""Jagged,"" kicks off with a craggy Crazy Horse- lite riff before dissolving into a toothless wonder, setting the table for what follows. It's not so much that the songs fail as a result of their pure pop sweetness, but rather they miss their marks in their size. These are very small pop songs. A great majority of the album (""Oppenheimer"" and ""Nineteen"" are prime examples here) is almost unbearably earnest. Late last year, I fiddled as Rome burned. While other music writers decried the industry mergers and feared that the rosters that would inevitably be cut as a result, I naively assumed that the indie labels would pick up anything of worth. Now, irony of ironies, I sit here with this shoddy Old 97's disc-- diligently packaged and delivered by Elektra Records-- while the latest Luna release sits in import limbo. Well, at least the three bucks I get for trading this sucker in will help defray that import sticker price...",,4.0,
Instrument Soundtrack,Fugazi,by: Brent DiCrescenzo,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929be57abf31b7dc715612c/1:1/w_160/8afba3af.gif,1999-04-27 05:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3240-instrument-soundtrack/,Dischord,"Long the lodestar of credibility in punk, Fugazi has steadily chiseled a dogma and oeuvre over the last 12 years that arguably makes them the most important band of the '90s. But what they really want the public to know more than anything is that they have a sense of humor. In their massive documentary, Instrument, Fugazi shows up on an eighth- grade video- project talk show wearing leather jackets and knit caps, answering the questions of a thoroughly nervous teen with notecards and a suburban church dress. Later, drummer Brendan Canty shares with his bandmates how his sister's boyfriend believes the urban legand of Fugazi living in a house without heat and subsisting on a steady diet of nothing but rice. They all have a chuckle. It's understandable how this folklore has been spread, since Fugazi's records and performances are caustic, stern, and cathartic. Yet Instrument Soundtrack, chock- a- block with demos and studio outtakes, sounds remarkably playful. Heavily instrumental, Instrument Soundtrack draws from the Red Medicine and End Hits sessions, their most eclectic and emotionally complex records. These versions decellerate. A haunted studio echo is infused throughout. For a hissing trip into dub, a watery reverb is thrown over the drumtrack from ""Arpeggiator."" The skeletal Fugazi relies mainly on groovy rhythm from Joe Lally and Brendan Canty. Their masterful intercourse is the backbone of Fugazi. At moments, the songs de-evolve into rumbling live drum-n-bass tracks. Call it analogica. On second thought, don't. A wonderfully surprising moment of the soundtrack is Ian McKaye's piano pop ditty, ""I'm So Tired."" Heart- breakingly beautiful (yes, beautiful), it shows that Fugazi have more talent than their genre can tolerate. Hopefully, the band will turn punk on punk itself and record more sweet pop songs. Like the Washington Monument that graces the cover of In On the Kill Taker, Fugazi's music towers, massive and elegant, over all of their peers. And just as the Washington Monument currently stands in repair, covered in scaffolding and tarps while still maintaining impressive form and artistic statement, so too does Fugazi's music continue to inspire awe in its constructive state. For all those who worry that the Fugazi story may be coming to an end, both ""Instrument"" and its soundtrack show a band still growing and, in some ways, just getting started.","Long the lodestar of credibility in punk, Fugazi has steadily chiseled a dogma and oeuvre over the last 12 years ...

Mule Variations,Tom Waits,by: Zach Hooker,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a9bc5e6ef9596932147b/1:1/w_160/dea573eb.jpg,1999-04-27 05:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8562-mule-variations/,Epitaph,"I once took a poetry workshop taught by a guy called Ed Dorn. You may have heard of Ed Dorn. He's a fairly famous guy, as poets go, and he's written his fair share of well- known poems. The first day of Dorn's poetry workshop consisted of him delivering a sometimes scathing and mostly nonsensical monologue that veered from Roman aqueducts to the Russian poet Akhmatova to indigenous North African peoples. The main thrust was one simple point: nobody has written a truly great poem over the course of the last fifty years, and if anyone is going to write the one great poem of the last quarter of the twentieth century, it was not going to be one of us sophomore- year poetry scrubs. Sorry, it just wasn't. I'd like to take this opportunity to extend Ed Dorn's admonition to the bulk of Pitchfork's readership, and to amend it thusly: neither will any of you write a song as good as Tom Waits' very worst song. Sorry, you just won't. And to reach the levels of one of his very best songs, you'd have to spend the next twenty years training with ninjas in a high mountain monastery, travel from there to Haiti to have bizarre Voudun rites performed over your writing hand, and then sell your soul to Satan for good measure. Better get started. So far, reviews of Mule Variations have been mixed, ranging from shameless hero worship (yeah, yeah, like this one), to jaded critics claiming that Waits hit his songwriting peak with 1985's Rain Dogs. Some guy recently told a friend of mine that he didn't like Mule Variations because ""I saw Waits play in San Francisco in the late '80s, and I just wasn't that into it, cuz I liked Waits better when he was a ballad singer."" What does that mean? I have one theory about those dissing Mule Variations: they know in their hearts what Ed Dorn and I have just told you, and crying out ""He's slipping!"" is a backhanded way of claiming equality with one of the world's greatest living performers. Don't listen to the bastards and their sour grapes. Mule Variations is a great album, and that's all there is to it. Sonically, it picks up where Bone Machine left off , but drops some of that album's artifice: the clattering, trebly out- back- of- the- shed sound is still here and the inexplicable presence of Primus persists, but many of these songs find Waits relaxing his krazy karnival barker persona. The songs most people are keying on-- ""Big in Japan,"" ""Filipino Box Spring Hog"" and ""Eyeball Kid"" have been getting a lot of airtime lately on my local college station-- are standard later- era Waits jams, complete with weird rattling percussion and menacing images of hellhounds and mutant children. But the really good stuff here, as with any Tom Waits record, is the slower stuff. ""Hold On"" has a classic ""Jersey Girl"" vibe, and while there may be a little lyrical cheez involved, it's exciting to hear a return to that sound. ""Pony,"" ""House Where Nobody Lives"" and ""Picture In a Frame"" are ballads that can stand with Waits' best, from earlier tunes like ""Burma Shave"" or ""Martha"" straight through to ""A Little Rain."" The album- closing bittersweet mid- tempo rocker tradition has never seen a better entry than ""Come On Up to the House,"" and the strange, out- of- phase falsetto backing vocals on ""Black Market Baby"" are alone worth the price of admission. It's true that this is not Rain Dogs, Swordfishtrombones or even Frank's Wild Years. But is it Tom Waits' fault that people are so hung up on those particular albums? Look, you've got two options here: you can continue to bolster your own nonexistent street cred by dissing new Tom Waits in favor of old Tom Waits, or you can give it up, admit that it's all great and increase your own personal enjoyment. The choice seems like a no- brainer to me.","I once took a poetry workshop taught by a guy called Ed Dorn. You may have heard of Ed Dorn ...

Sometimes, blinded by the bad cocaine and lulled by the soft caresses of the young playthings record companies keep on sending over, we tend to judge music by its first listen and not by its potential staying power. The sad sack of shit reviewer who had the opportunity to review the last Euphone record, the Breaking Parole EP suffered from that same moldy dick- cheese way of thinking. He enthusiastically praised the band for its brand of ultra- grooved out instrumental noodling without thinking too hard about how permanent his fondness would be. He liked the tricky drumming, the modular bleeping, the smooth, buttery basslines, and thought that would always be the case. Having heard all of Euphone's recorded output, I can see where he was coming from. It's all very accomplished, somewhat soulful stuff, and the band's latest work, The Calendar of Unlucky Days fits in with the previous work. Throughout its career, the band has always been one of the better sub- Tortoise acts, aided by a certain panache for its playing. The newest offering sees it taking a more subdued, studio- centric approach, using tape loops and treated drums to accent the carefully thought- out melodies. In other words, fans of old Euphone will like this. Myself, I'm not thrilled about all this. This is not to say that The Calendar of Unlucky Days, or indeed any of Euphone's other product is bad. I might put this on at one of my slinky booty parties and be lauded for my choice in background music. Songs like the Stereolab- ish ""Wickedness"" and the down- tempo funk ditty ""Needle and Crate"" are catchy indeed, but not terribly memorable. At worst, Euphone takes a slight bassline and plays all the piss ou of it, as with the record's closer, ""Playboy."" One can only do so many organ solos or fancy drum breaks over a melody that seems to go nowhere. Six months later, do you care? I don't.","Here at Pitchfork, we occasionally like to give some of our records the chance to age a bit before offering ...

The Unauthorized Biography of Reinhold Messner,Ben Folds Five,by: Brent DiCrescenzo,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a26ac0084474cd0c0037/1:1/w_160/32be0cdb.gif,1999-04-27 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/645-the-unauthorized-biography-of-reinhold-messner/,Sony 550 Music,"Ever since I moved to Chicago I've been running into famous people. John Cusack and Catherine Zeta- Jones are filming a movie right down my street. I placed a web of red lasers up and down Damen at knee's height hoping to see Zeta- Jones' athletically- wrapped booty sliding under them. Unfortunately, I've mostly bumped into indie- rock ""icons."" Like last Wednesday when I went to go see ""The Phantom Menace. Uberproducer Steve Albini (who you won't know as the producer of Tar, but more likely as the producer of Nirvana and Page & Plant) and his legion of jumpsuited studio drones sat next to me. As we waited anxiously for the 20th Centuty Fox drumroll we were subjected to the piped MovieTunez that theatres P.A. into unwilling, captive ears. I listened to Albini's comments hoping to find a soundbyte to quote for a review. I wondered what a notoriously anti- major label wiseguy (who apparently does not carry his elitist attitude over into other media areas, as he was in line on Day One for ""Star Wars"") would have to say about the likes of the Dixie Chicks, Train, and Britney Spears. At some point, Ben Folds Five's lastest radio single drifted out. Immediately, Albini groaned and chimed in with his faux- Folds falsetto ""I am laaame!"" Ho ho! I didn't need Albini's reassurance to sway me into assailing Ben Folds latest offering, but it was nice to know that someone else was on my side. You can figure out what every note on this album will sound like faster than you can spit out the forgettable, awkward title. The Unauthorized Biography of Reinhold Messner sounds like a droll A&E; special. Fittingly, Ben Folds now markets his buttery pop towards that same A&E; demographic of old white people and lazy college kids who believe they're getting art. The song that Albini sang along to (which was called ""Army,"" not ""I am Lame,"" as previously suspected) sounded like a cross between bad Billy Joel and Vaudeville. Let me repeat that... Billy Joel. Vaudeville. This doesn't even come close to touch ""good,"" friends. Some attempt to throw credibility at Ben Folds simply because he's-- gasp-- playing a piano. Ben Folds still sprinkles his lyrics three albums into his career with a ""redneck"" here, a ""mullet"" there, and a ""fuck"" every now and then and thinks he's a) funny, and b) edgy. The score is 0-2. The album opens up on a promising note with the over- the- top, Queen-ish ""Narcolepsy."" Big dumb strings, thundering drums, and operatic choruses usher in a new direction for Ben Folds. Quickly Folds retreats to the sad, safe sounds of ""Brick"" for the rest of the album, save for a somewhat funky ""Your Redneck Past"" (He he! There's that word again! He's a reg-u-lar Jeff Foxworthy!) and some answering machine message instrumental (those are always keepers). Quite simply, the fart- fuzz bass and twinkling piano formula doesn't lend itself to musical ingenuity and variety-- this trio has run out of ideas. Sure, Ben Folds once penned some delicious pop songs. Too bad they were all on the first album. But let's face it-- tongue- in- cheek artists have such a short shelflife. Amd at least the Dead Milkmen never had their music played in elevators and over slides of ""Try a large, delicious Popcorn.""","Ever since I moved to Chicago I've been running into famous people.

Startled awake in the wee hours by the otherworldly sounds, I'd grabbed the nearest vaguely weaponlike object (a french press from the kitchen counter), steeled myself for a confrontation, and started downstairs. My knuckles whitened around the handle of the french press and my breath caught in my chest. It sounded like several hundred Speak- and- Spells were going haywire down there-- bleeps and whines giving way occasionally to jumbled and unintelligible words. Crouching, I reached the bottom of the stairs. The Speak- and- Spell noises careened past me like bats erupting from a cave at dusk. I paused to gather my strength and stepped into the main room. As I rounded the corner, I was met with a sight that struck me dumb and loosed the useless french press from my slackened fingers. The source of the eldritch sounds was not Speak- and- Spells at all-- it was Speak- and- Maths, and more of them than I'd ever seen before. They covered the long wall of the room in an even grid, butted up next to each other like tiles, and fastened together with duct tape and pipe cleaners. There they all were-- the ghostly gurgles and beeps that had interrupted my sleep as they gonged wrong answers and trumpeted correct ones, running on some obscure program set in motion by an unseen hand. The room was filled with the calm and oceanic blue-green glow from their LED readouts. A gentle cough broke my reverie, and I looked to my left to see a man leaning nonchalantly against the opposite wall. He wore a white lab coat and safety goggles, and held a clipboard in one hand and a Manhattan in the other. I recognized him immediately as Pitchfork guru Brent DiCrescenzo. ""Brent, what the hell is this thing in my basement?"" ""Don't worry, I'll explain. But first, dig my lab coat."" He held out an arm, and I noticed that his lab coat was satin. I felt it. It was extremely soft and comfy. Glancing down, I noticed he wore huge fluffy slippers. He went on. ""I've noticed you've been a little down on reviews lately. You seemed downright bitter about having to write that Floraline review. I don't blame you; it's difficult work, this reviewing. That's why I've invented this device you see before you now: the Review-O-Tron 3000. Watch-- here, hand me that Theivery Corporation disc."" I did as I was told. Brent inserted the disc into a modified Speak- and- Math, set his clipboard on the TV, and flopped onto the futon. Soon, the random bleeps coalesced into a rhythmic pulsing, and the Speak- and- Maths began to speak in monotone unison. ""Abductions and Reconstructions, the quasi follow-up to the Thievery Corporation's Sounds From the Thievery Hi-Fi, is a collection of remixes of songs from a surprisingly varied cross section of bands, including Baaba Maal, Black Uhuru, and Gus Gus."" Brent nodded. ""Not bad, eh?"" ""No, Brent, not bad at all. But that's all factual-- any All-Music Guide schmuck could tell you that stuff. What about specific tracks? What about the David Byrne song, for instance?"" He rose and pressed some buttons. The electronic voices returned: ""Garza and Hilton possess the uncommon knack of knowing when to leave a song alone. Their remix of David Byrne's 'Dance On Vaseline' finds the vocal track almost untouched, dipped in a little extra reverb, and layered over a bed of only- slightly- tweaked bass and drums. It's a satisfying remix that retains the strength of the original tune but recasts it in a subtle and surprising way."" ""No shit!"" I exclaimed. ""What about the Stereolab tune? Can it give me a gripe about the album as a whole?"" Another series of buttons was pressed, and again the voices spoke: ""'Tickertape of the Unconscious,' a song that would seem to resist the remix treatment, is turned into a slowly revolving groove. The background vocal is distilled and brought to the forefront, and the welcome addition of some weird, microtonal bass sequencing is a nice touch. As a whole, the album suffers only from a bit of monotony, with the songs all hovering around the same BPM and utilizing the same basic approach to percussion. Ultimately, Abductions and Reconstructions is less than the sun of its many excellent parts, though it's nice to hear Garza and Hilton backing off from the forced-sounding dubbiness of their debut."" I was stupefied. My years of sweaty toil at the keyboard had just come to an end. At a loss, I looked back and forth from my computer to the Review-O-Tron 3000. Brent smiled with satisfaction. He picked up his clipboard, scrawled a couple notes, and sipped his Manhattan. ""There, your Sunday review is done. Now, go get a cocktail and that Vic Chesnutt disc and let's get to work!""","Bizarre humming and clicking noises enveloped me as I descended the stairs into my basement workshop.

Though I may toil ceaselessly to eloquently present an album's strengths or weaknesses in support of my opinion, it remains just that. Not even a truckload of obscure album name- dropping can carve opinion into fact, and individual readers and listeners are bound to glean from the piece a perspective at least slightly different from mine. Take Alejandro Escovedo's latest release, Bourbonitis Blues. A collection of spare ballads and country- tinged rockers from the estimable Texan songwriter, Blues has been garnering high praise from those who know for a couple of months now. ""A splendid release acquitting Escovedo's growing reputation,"" they write. ""His cover of 'Pale Blue Eyes' is a bold and unmitigated success,"" I read. But what I hear is a little bit different. The album lacks the focus of Escovedo's previous work, primarily due to a sprinkling of poorly chosen covers. ""Irene Wilde"" is interesting, but ""California Blues"" needs some oxygen. Escovedo plays Russian roulette with the aforementioned ""Pale Blue Eyes"" and, unfortunately, catches the bullet R.E.M. fortuitously avoided in the '80s. (Lesson here for the kiddies: despite their appearance, Lou Reed songs are not toys and must be handled with extreme care.) These covers idle at the expense of a handful of hard- charging originals. Escovedo exercises his potential and the album finds its success with shimmering smokers like ""Guilty"" and ""Everybody Loves Me,"" while the earnest confession, ""I Was Drunk,"" showcases his quiet side. Unfortunately, the songs aren't strong enough to bear their heavy burden and what we're left with is a pleasant album that doesn't reach quite high enough to pass the benchmark already set by Escovedo's previous work. Of course, you might feel differently. But, that's the game, brotha.","Writing album reviews is, at its core, a futile pastime, for music is a most relative of subjects. Though I ...

EEVIAC,Man or Astro-Man?,by: Michael Sandlin,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c383ea9e61561daa7f35/1:1/w_160/873d3887.gif,1999-04-20 05:00:09,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5064-eeviac/,Touch and GoTouch and Go,"Good evening, earthlings. The dreaded Planet Sandlin here again. You may be interested to know that Man or Astroman and I have something in common. You see, I, too, am from outer space. In fact, as you'll learn from my revealing Pitchfork bio, I'm the result of my own Big Bang theory-- or in my case, the controversial Barely- Audible Poof theory. I'm my own planet, kids. Cool. Unfortunately, my dense atmosphere naturally yields noxious, gassy one- sided opinions and petty prejudices. My world is without gravity, fraught with weightless ideas floating freely around themselves-- never achieving a coherent, utilitarian message. A thick force field surrounds my outer crust, thus impairing my ability to absorb the simple absolute truths much of our universe staunchly abides by. Thus, I'm unable to nourish my dry, cracked mindscape. In short, Planet Sandlin is a horrendous blight in a galaxy otherwise filled with bright stars and shining celestial bodies. But I'll be silent now and forever, in order to eternally contemplate my intrinsic ugliness. Booming God- Like Voice- Over: While Planet Sandlin skulks around his pitiful axis, we luckily have his only earthly friend, renowned author Stephen Hawking's butler, to type a few hundred words about Man or Astroman. Mr. Butler, please proceed. Planet Sandlin? What an arsehole! I don't even know him that well. I signed my boss's book for 'im once, I think. Nevertheless, I'd just like to say that, along with Gary Numan and Peter Schilling, Man or Astroman have been one of my guilty musical pleasures for quite a long while. And let me just tell you, it's really tough to take the piss out of a band I've enjoyed for so long. I mean, these poor Astro- chaps are from prime alien abduction country, Alabama. Shouldn't they be allowed to have their fun? Oh, alright. They're not from Alabama, they're from space. Indeed, these humanoids from beyond initially landed on our fair planet years ago, sometime in the early '90s. Soon, they abducted the styles and sounds of Dick Dale, the Ventures, and Les Baxter, just to name a few. The recordings of these uncharacteristically innovative musical humans were the subjects of intense study and observation. The Man or Astroman stage act quickly became a complex aliens- posing- as- humans- posing- as- aliens vaudeville schtick borrowed heavily from other over- caffinated physics- club outcasts- posing- as- droids like Devo. Our otherworldly heroes set out to prove, as guitar prophet Joe Satriani so astutely speculated years before, that aliens really do have a deep affinity for surfing and the galvanizing music inspired by that particular recreational sport. It's one of the mysteries of the universe, much like the Black Hole. Why do aliens enjoy surf music so much? In fact, it's the subject of my latest book, ""Stephen Hawking's Butler's Guide to the Universe."" But enough about that. Man or Astroman show that aliens can be very musical, playful, and even have a sense of humor. They've successfully debunked the myth about aliens that Hollywood movies help to perpetuate: that space creatures can only be cruel abductors or hostile acid- spitting enormities. The Man or Astroman sense of humor borrows many camp, lowbrow ideas from American cable TV. In the case of Man or Astroman's latest effort, EEVIAC (subtitled Operational Index and Reference Guide, Including Other Non- Computational Devices), its failing isn't exactly akin to a botched chemistry experiment blowing up in one's face. Actually, the failing here resides in the band's inability to consistently conduct potentially- dangerous experiments with their music; or re- program themselves in any significant, visionary sense. Their driving percussive attack is still present, and rivals that of another futuristic favorite band of mine, Trans Am. And of course, the simple pleasures of frenetic wipeout surf guitar are always extant to some degree, and to say the least, impeccably executed. Contrary to the hi-tech blueprints gracing the album's sleeve, there is little innovative studio quackery to be found on EEVIAC. In fact, the album is much more humanized than most of the pre- programmed floppy disk claptrap that passes for music in today's society-- much of it sounding like it was conceived on some small child's Commodore 64, and then marketed by major labels as ""advanced"" or ""futuristic"" music. EEVIAC's packaging suggests an advanced technological angle that's just not really there. With ""Interstellar Hardrive,"" EEVIAC begins predictably enough, with those familiar tsunami waves of reverb- doused surf guitar. Occasionally, our favorite martians underpin the songs with Moog burps, or maybe preface a song with sampled voice- overs that always have something appropriately scientific or nerdy to say. The album does get a tad brittle and industrial with ""D:Contamination,"" which could pass for a legitimate fusion of trip-hop and surf. I'm also quite overwhelmed by those overbearing William Shatner- esque titles like ""Within the Mainframe, Impaired Vision From Inoperable Cataracts Can Become a New Impending Nepotism,"" especially since the title just happens to be more interesting than the cacophonous space- junk characterizing the song itself. On ""Fractionized Reception of a Scrambled Transmission,"" our extra- terrestrial friends show us they've finally happened upon the much- in- demand vocoder device (much like every other forward-thinking band in the solar system). As the great vocoder avatars Styx would say, I want to thank you, Mr. Roboto, thank you. Sometimes, though, on many a Man or Astroman album, our heroes just seem to put themselves on auto- pilot and coast along on a single wavelength-- mechanically churning out one similar- sounding surf instrumental after the other. And EEVIAC is no exception. On the closing track, ""Myopia,"" they actually do attempt to deviate from familiar ground. And they do so with a mistake that could be heard as ungainly Mercury Rev referencing, or possibly, a plodding Galaxie 500- influenced instrumental that's about ten minutes too long. A monotonous, unmoving, unlistenable space jam, it rightly is, kids. The standout tracks here are the mercifully short ""U-235/ PU-239,"" and ""As Estrlelas Agora Elas Estao Mortas."" The latter cut proves that, not only are these spacemen multi- lingual, but they can also successfully transcend the narrow sonic trappings of the conventional surf instrumental when they actually try. Sure, Man or Astroman's music still has its undeniable appeal. But would respectable paranormal beings allow themselves to continue on a redundant and obvious path? Will their fate be marked by nothing more than common, earthly mediocrity? Can they reinvent themselves without sacrificing the adrenaline rush of great surf guitar instrumentals? For the answer to these and other universal questions, we can only look to the future.","Good evening, earthlings. The dreaded Planet Sandlin here again.

But, hey, let's not dwell on my clammy palms and sick- smelling body-- rather, let's approach another album and embrace it in spite of my extreme fatigue. Y'know, kitsch is so lovable when it's done well. It really is. See, for years, we've been subjected to the nauseating cuteness of Shonen Knife, the terribly unsubtle Pizzicato Five, adorable little Cornelius, the ethnic absurdities of Cornershop and the grrl power of Cibo Matto. At the height of their popularities, these bands could out-kitsch the best of 'em, and a few of the bands even recorded great albums. But, as an esteemed colleague of mine recently observed, ""The shit's got a short shelflife."" Fantastic Plastic Machine's Tomoyuki Tanaka capitalises on everything Cornelius achieved on his 1998 American debut Fantasma, but relies on human elements as much as electronic ones. Where Fantasma was unmistakably wacky and occasionally annoying, Luxury is subtle-- always focused more on the music than the humor. Tanaka writes great music, blending modern sound and technology with classic string arrangements and top- notch production. ""Honolulu, Calcutta"" is one of Luxury's brightest examples of this-- its sound is distinctly 1960s space-noir, with a laidback hip-hop beat that transforms it into a catchy and beautiful combination of the sounds of two eras. The song that's got everyone's attention is the band's nice arrangement of the Eurythmics' ""There Must Be an Angel (Playing With My Heart),"" but it's hardly the album's highlight. The High Llamas- ish ""Bossa for Jackie,"" a dedication to the late Mrs. Kennedy, is a tropical breeze of melody (with a fresh, pine-sol smell); ""You Must Learn All Night Long"" is simply outta control with its speedfreak drum frenzy, its horn breakdown and vocoder effects; the dancy ""Lotto"" sounds like a head- on collision between the Pet Shop Boys and Stereolab; ""MPF (Mezzo Pianoforte)"" is piano- based pop, complete with samples of retro 1950s R&B; quartets singing ""Oh yeah"" and a crazy- assed breakdown; and Luxury's closer, the undeniably Tomita- influenced ""Mr. Fantasy's Love"" is an analog symphony with aged Moog effects and a singing computer. Emperor Norton Records is quickly becoming known for its roster of kitsch artists, among them Arling and Cameron, the Zoobombs, and Takako Minekawa (who you may recognize as the girl who says ""Play-sta-tion!"" at the end of most Playstation game ads). Now, with the addition of Fantastic Plastic Machine to their roster, they've pretty much got a monopoly on weird. Whoo!","Well, it's been 15 minutes since I wrote my last review, and I'm still sick.

Organism,Jimi Tenor,by: Ryan Schreiber,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Founder</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a756ea9e61561daa5570/1:1/w_160/9950585e.jpeg,1999-04-20 05:00:07,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7973-organism/,WarpSireWarpSire,"There's something really strange about Jimi Tenor that it's hard to put a finger on. He performs his songs completely straight-faced, like he's as serious about his work as Sting is about saving whales. But the songs, while always intriguing and listenable, are just too damned weird for there not to be some tongue- in- cheek value intended. Organism was released earlier this year on the revered electronic label Warp Records, home to such forward-thinking auteurs as Squarepusher, Aphex Twin, Autechre, Boards of Canada, and Two Lone Swordsmen. And as different as this album is from the rest of Warp's roster, it somehow belongs-- like Neil Hamburger on Drag City, Guided By Voices on TVT, or gospel diva Thornetta Davis on Sub Pop. Tenor's bizarre blend of earnest, Barry White-style '70s soul, Prince funk circa Dirty Mind, ultramodern electronic flourishes, and geeky, Jarvis Cocker delivery is truly disturbing. Is he serious or just bein' goofy? It's impossible to know. But when the skinny, thick- rimmed- glasses- wearin' Warhol lookalike lustfully whispers ""I wanna be the taxi driver who takes you home tonight/ I wanna be every customer in the diner where you work,"" before belting out ""'Cause I wanna work to make you love me,"" his computer nerd image comes off as simultaneously sexy and Triple X sleazy. Tenor is at his most charming on Organism's slinky soul tracks, especially ""Love and Work"" and ""Sleep"" which both draw heavily from modern ghetto R&B; beats and jazz flute solos from late '60s Quincy Jones records. But Tenor's act is far from gimmicky. The leadoff track, ""Total Devestation"" and ""Year of Apocalypse"" are thunderous, bass-heavy house anthems, while ""Xinotepe Heat"" sounds like a cross between Alice Coltrane's Journey in Satchidananda, Jan Hammer's ""Theme from 'Miami Vice'"" and the soundtrack to the second level of ""Sonic the Hedgehog 2."" The album's two low points come with the grading ""Muchmo,"" a song that features a sterile, programmed electronic beat and a vocoder-enhanced voice-- presumably Tenor's-- endlessly repeating the words ""Much more psychedelic/ Than any of the drugs,"" and ""Serious Love,"" whose mind- numbing repetition of the phrase ""Give me something good that'll feed my soul/ 'Cause you need some serious love to stay happy"" is a little irritating. Luckily, these songs are spaced far enough apart on the disc that they don't really interfere much with the overall quality of the record. Besides, the brilliant ""My Mind,"" with its sultry sax solo and Talking Heads-influenced background chorus, and the dark futurism of the album's closing number, ""City Sleeps,"" are perhaps some of the most innovative and original in the entire Warp catalog. Organism would be an awesome listen on a rainy Spring night in Tokyo or while cruising Main Street in downtown Anoka, Minnesota on any given August night in 1983. Whatever the case, its magic cannot be truly appreciated while the sun's up. Reserve for New Year's Eve Party, 2000.",,8.6,
Peel Session EP,Plaid,by: Ryan Schreiber,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Founder</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a09c13d197565213841a/1:1/w_160/74886fe9.gif,1999-04-20 05:00:06,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6333-peel-session-ep/,InterscopeWarpNothing,"I am the hottest I have ever been. Not to bitch about it or anything. Actually, I think I am gonna bitch about it. In Chicago today, it was a murderous 98 degrees (heat index at 112), which I'm sure is nothing compared to... say... some African regions. However, as I type this, I have two large fans pointed directly at my luscious, naked body, and sweat is still-- quite literally-- dripping off my shapely 5'9"" frame. Or perhaps it's the fact that I can't stop dancing to Plaid's surprisingly funky Peel Session EP. Plaid released a terrific album on Warp (distributed by Trent Reznor's Nothing/Interscope label in the U.S.) last year entitled Not for Threes. I grooved on that album's ambient electronic mayhem and speedy, atmospheric drum-n-bass-- its sound was almost orchestral, bringing to mind visions of wide, open spaces and uncharted northern regions. This time around, Plaid go haywire. The record opens with the dancy, piano- based ""Scoobs,"" a track that should have even the clumsiest clubhopper bumpin' an' glidin' with the best of 'em. The melody, a fine blend of modern disco, jungle breakz and slippery keyboard tones, reminds me of my days spent strung out on E and tabs of acid in Ibiza. ...Okay, so I've never even been out of the country. But I can pretend. After all, when you're confined to these barrio streets for lack of any expendable cash, a dream is your best pal. ""Eph"" is a bit more moody, laying a tinny, reverberatin' harpsichord line over a dark and haunting ""Risky Business""- era Tangerine Dream- style throwdown. ""Bo Bootch"" gives us a rugged, slo- motion hip-hop beat and some sexy, organic organ riffs. And the closer, the simply titled ""Cold,"" offers up a steamy dish of pure Autechre- influenced rhythm. It's hard to know where Plaid's excursions will take them next, so I can't say yet whether this is a decent introduction to the band's sound. Not for Threes, as I previously stated, is an entirely different affair, so we can only wait and see what the future brings. In the meantime, you Plaid fans should grab hold of this disc just to see what craziness they've worked out.","I am the hottest I have ever been. Not to bitch about it or anything.

Six,Mansun,by: Brent DiCrescenzo,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c39e13d197565213bd8d/1:1/w_160/ef8e2309.jpg,1999-04-20 05:00:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5090-six/,Parlophone,"The sheer audacity of Mansun's sophomore album, Six, demands respect and ridicule. After the surprising success of their first record, Attack of the Grey Lantern, Mansun have practically abandoned all the key ingredients to that record's accolades. Songwriter Paul Draper dumped the satirical characters and simple guitar pop, which was a brave move, if not a stupid one. Instead, Six invents the haphazard genre of glam- prog- space- bubblegum- rock in which rock stars in glitter and leather pants play nine- minute bezerk jams. Surprisingly, this album has yet to see release in the States-- the songs change pace so frequently and randomly that they'd be perfect for our short- attention spans. It's perfect! I mean, if you don't like a song, you just have to wait about 30 seconds for it to completely change. Seemingly influenced by comic books and hallucinogens, Six skitters from chugging power- chords, to intricate hooks, to Pink Floyd wandering, to Tchaikovsky samples, to lip- licking swagger. At times they can come off like a frightening cross between the Pixies, T Rex, and Yes. If you give Mansun the benefit of the doubt, and assume they're not being completly serious, Six entertains immensely, chock-a-block with every element of modern rock. The fusion sounds so weird and seizure- inducing that it sucks you into its pretentious, mascara'd maw. It helps that the four lads rock with remarkable skill. It's hard to imagine any other band pulling off this mammoth epic. (Well, perhaps Radiohead on a heavy dose of prozac and a Cadbury chocolate rush.) Paul Draper's emotional, spotlight- sucking delivery sparkles over Dominic Chad's inventive solos and melodies, as the drummer and bassist simply try to keep up. When making a concept album, a band walks the razor- sharp line between Kiss' (Music From) The Elder and Radiohead's OK Computer. With a truckload of chutzpah, Mansun walks this tightrope for over an hour, teetering to either side, constantly looking to fall off. From moment to moment they can be ridiculous or beautiful, artistic or fluff. The chills and thrills of hearing them perform such a stunt is worth hunting down an import.","The sheer audacity of Mansun's sophomore album, Six, demands respect and ridicule.

The 3-Way,Lilys,by: Michael Sandlin,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd14c0084474cd0c2c11/1:1/w_160/aee4b463.gif,1999-04-20 05:00:04,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4795-the-3-way/,Sire,"You might say Lilys frontman Kurt Heasley is a world- class thief, and possibly a limey wannabe. It's no secret he's probably worn out many a copy of the Kinks' Village Green Preservation Society. But the guy's also as sophisticated a pop writer as we've got. And he's responsible for some of the stealthiest ripoff artistry since Steve Wynn and the Dream Syndicate so cleverly robbed the Velvet Underground's crypt for all it was worth on 1982's classic Days of Wine and Roses. Heasley's ransacking encompasses almost the entire stylistic sprawl of the '60s on the groove- a- minute shindig that is The 3-Way. Although some critics accuse him of stealing Ray Davies' identity outright, Heasley has forged his own multifaceted re-tailoring of '60s mod- rock. And sure, Davies' influence looms large over songs like the harpsichord- laced ""And One (on One)"" and ""The Spirits Merchant."" And on ""The Generator,"" there's some nice piano work worthy of Charlie Brown's ivory- tickling pal Schroeder, and some cheeky ""Oye Como Va,"" guitar quotes. To round things out, there's a nod to Mitch Ryder's revved- up Motor City car- rock on ""Dimes Make Dollars,"" and the bubbly Lawrence Welk jazz of ""Solar is Here."" Oh, and you can shake your ass to some of this stuff, too: in fact, ""Leo Ryan (Our Pharoah's Slave)"" is the funky intersection in which James Brown's ""Cold Sweat"" might cross paths with the Beatles' ""The Word."" Believe me, if you can sit still to this song, your backside's probably made of the same lead- like compound as Pam Anderson's former breasts. ""Socs Hip"" may, at first, cause your hips to twist and grind. Then you'll get a chance to put your ballroom dance lessons into practice. The song suddenly shifts to the rattling castanets and smooth rhythmic glide of a Spanish tango. Then, just as quickly, it regroups and recasts itself as pure Standells pop. All throughout The 3-Way, there's a host of suprising tempo shifts, rhythm variations, time signature quirks, odd chord changes-- none of which seems to really inhibit the innate simplicity or forward motion of any particular song. What's wholly original here, though, is the way Heasley arranges and incorporates all his filched musical bric a brac: banjo, toy piano, loopy Hammond organ, free jazz, harpsichord and cheeseball pastiches of European and South American musical styles are all harmoniously grafted onto bare- bones garage- rock. And all those big fuzz- guitar hooks are a real gas-- some at least as immense as the main riff to Count Five's ""Psychotic Reaction."" As we've seen, the Greg Dulli's and Brian Jonestown Massacres of the world celebrate the '60s resurgence by throwing gaudy hipster costume parties, and buying shitloads of expensive Vox equipment. And, as an afterthought, the guys record hilariously bad albums that suck hard no matter what decade they're supposed to represent. For the Lilys, '60s references are modeled like so much trendy clothing... which, of course, makes for plenty of cut- rate resale material when the fancy inevitably passes. And if the Lily's seem too prim and precious, well, I guess there's always the option of buying into all the half- assed greaser rock available out there. Or you could force yourself to love the increasingly popular cliques of critically- acclaimed avant- noisemakers: you know, those overly- serious Lower East Side- dwelling savants who give themselves stomach cancer attempting to transform one note drones and pick scratchings into something symphonic. Meanwhile, right under our collective noses, Kurt Heasley and the Lilys are making off with all the great hooks and still having all the damn fun.","You might say Lilys frontman Kurt Heasley is a world- class thief, and possibly a limey wannabe.

The Cars: Deluxe Edition,The Cars,by: Ryan Schreiber,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Founder</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a5335e6ef95969320a4e/1:1/w_160/5590dedf.gif,1999-04-20 05:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1319-the-cars-deluxe-edition/,RhinoRhino,"The year was 1978, and shaggy- haired geeks reigned supreme in three catagories: Advanced Dungeons and Dragons mastery, reciting the entirety of ""Star Wars"" from memory, and listening to new wave music. And listened they did-- bands like the Talking Heads, Blondie and Devo started springing up out of the woodwork and the losers ate it up like Toffee bars. Now, maybe they weren't exactly new wave, but the Cars fit the new wave stereotype close enough, and the geeks enjoyed the simple but catchy pop arrangements, the spastic moog effects, and the head- bobbing fun of the band's music. As we all know, the world's population of geeks had their two hours of glory last night when theaters everywhere opened their doors at midnight, letting millions of rabid fans in for the first full showings of ""Star Wars, Episode One: The Phantom Menace."" But clearly, all the hype of the new ""Star Wars"" film eclipsed the release of Rhino's The Cars: Deluxe Edition. Were it 1978, those kids'd be all over this shit. Eh, it's just as well. See, the Cars were great in their time. The scene needed them. They bridged the gap between the Ramones and Elvis Costello. They were important. But these days, they're remembered more as predecessors to Weezer's brand of pop music. And listening to The Cars: Deluxe Edition, you can see why interest feigned. The Cars is nice enough to listen to-- you can get into the harmonies and sweet, adorable songs, but it seems a bit thin in retrospect. Songs like ""I'm in Touch With Your World"" and ""Don't Cha Stop"" are, to the say the least, not some of the best songs rock music has produced. Other tracks show the band getting overly playful-- when the drumbeat changes toward the end of the classic single ""Just What I Needed,"" it throws the song off course and steals some of the glory from its anthemic feel. And ""Good Times Roll,"" while an undeniably great song, occasionally experiences side effects like sloppiness and general amateurish- ness. The other problem I've got with this record is that it's a two disc set. Why? Disc one is the original album (all 35 minutes of it), Rhinophonically remastered. Disc two hangs around like an unwanted afterthought-- it's all the original demo versions of all the songs that made it onto The Cars (except for ""Good Times Roll,"" which is a live recording, since they couldn't find a demo version), along with five previously unreleased songs from the same period, also in their demo formats. Now, as much as I hate to break it to you, I feel you should probably know the truth: these five tracks are just plain bad. Talk about ""should have been left in the vaults!"" These were the songs that didn't get released because the label was afraid they might drive the kids to suicide. Okay, they aren't that bad, but trust me-- you don't wanna hear 'em. (But ""Hotel Queenie"" is especially notable for its sheer badness.) Let's face it-- the Cars had their moment in the sun. Sure, there a couple of die- hard fans still roaming the planet, making their own rock music and camping out for movie tickets, but it's a rare person that's willing to drop a Jefferson on a nicely remastered, beautifully repackaged, two- disc reissue of The Cars.","The year was 1978, and shaggy- haired geeks reigned supreme in three catagories: Advanced Dungeons and Dragons mastery, reciting the ...

The Sound of Music: An Unfinished Symphony in Twelve Parts,Jad Fair,by: Mark Richardson,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd26eb335119a49ecdfc/1:1/w_160/67199cce.gif,1999-04-20 05:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2954-the-sound-of-music-an-unfinished-symphony-in-twelve-parts/,Shimmy DiscShimmy Disc,"Many years ago, I picked up Bongwater's Double Bummer. I knew Kramer from his spacious production on the Galaxie 500 records and wanted to hear more of that weeded- out substrata beauty. What I got instead was limp classic rock covers (Gary Glitter's ""Rock And Roll Part 2,"" and Zeppelin's ""Dazed and Confused"") and histrionic spoken word nonsense in the Maggie Estep vein. To say I'd experienced a double bummer was to fall about ten bummers shy. I can safely say that I'd rather drink bongwater than listen to that depressing album again. Even so, I can still dig what Kramer has done since those days in a producer's capacity, particularly his work with Low. And it's his master's touch behind the boards that almost redeems his second collaboration with Jad Fair, The Sound of Music (An Unfinished Symphony in Twelve Parts). Almost. The liner notes to The Sound of Music tell us that ""Kramer wrote, performed and recorded the music in three days."" I imagine we're supposed to be impressed with this act of carelessness, and we even might be if the record didn't sport its tossed- off origins so clearly. The Casio drum machine that backs most of the songs is much less charming than it is annoying, and in more than just a few spots, Kramer's guitar work is reminiscent of a jaded session hack from Orlando. But then there's the gorgeous music that backs ""Zorro's Black Whip"" (with a strikingly G5-ish backward guitar bit) and the Fat Albert- meets- Gary Glitter junkyard glam of ""Elenor"" to remind us what we loved about the K man in the first place. It borders on the tolerable. Unfortunately, even these tunes have the vocal stylings of Jad Fair mixed way out front, and that's a difficult handicap for any piece of music to overcome. I'll admit that portions of Fair's oeuvre have their charms-- particularly the more chaotic early stuff-- but what strikes me most about his recent work is just how unpleasant it is to listen to more than once. These sing- songy vocal stories might raise on eyebrow or elicit a chuckle on first pass, but there is no depth to warrant further attention. And the songs quickly become boring. Very boring. The liner notes also tell us that ""Jad Fair listened to the music once, then wrote the lyrics while listening a second time, and sang them all in a single day."" No shit.","Many years ago, I picked up Bongwater's Double Bummer. I knew Kramer from his spacious production on the Galaxie ...

I think it's the first time anyone's ever recorded an ensemble of diarrhea- afflicted Down's Syndrome chimpanzees taking a collective dump in someone's garage. They somehow managed to mic each of the chimp's asses, slip 'em each a strong laxative with a banana lunch, and then, kerblaam! Lucky for you, dear consumer, these tree- swingers squeeze out just enough smelly goods to make for an entire album of pure unadulterated shit. To continue the excrement theme, you could say that Old Time Relijun aspire to be the musical equivalent of those downtown NYC artistes that crap on a canvas, and sell their feces to pretentious art collectors for a pretty penny. Although, really, I'm the last one who'll condemn a band just because they can't ""play"" in a traditional technical sense. In fact, on a daily basis I enjoy all sorts of inherently filthy semi- musical crap: Pussy Galore and Jon Spencer, Jandek, the Fugs, the Stooges, the Sex Pistols, and so on. On a technical level, though, Uterus and Fire makes an album like the Jon Spencer Blues Explosion's exceptionally trashy 1992 debut sound like Zeppelin II. I mean, what sort of tragically hip jerk- off would allow these inept fucks to make a CD? This audacious little twerp should be shackled to his stereo system, have headphones duct- taped to his cranium, and forced to listen to his brilliant discovery on repeat for a few days. When you get right down to it, these poor bastards don't even try. They aren't funny enough to be a joke band. They aren't offensive. Just unbelievably boring. The drummer bashes the toms like he's a seven- year- old doing a bad imitation of a handicapped John Bonham. The guitar limps along on a few repeating out- of- tune notes. The diverse lead singer gets into some ridiculous Yoko Ono vocal performance-- that's when he's not doing the muffled Jon Spencer- wannabe mouth- over- the- microphone screaming. And I guess they couldn't find a shitty enough bass player, because it sounds like there isn't any bass whatsoever. Damn that's bold, baby. Oh, and there's lots of clueless free jazz sax- blowing, too-- and, boy, it's not annoying or anything, trust me. Oh, and hey, I'm glad they didn't forget to mention my favorite part of the female anatomy in the album title. That's so cool! Ha, they said ""uterus,"" man. Cool.

The Brussels bureaucrats have regulated the curvature of bananas, the length of a cucumber, the smelliness of Gorgonzola. With such things standardized, life in the European Union is supposed to be tranquil. Each European, whether born in Dijon or Dåahus, wakes up singing Beethoven's ""Ode to Joy"" and contributes all his or her being to the greater good of the European homeland. No wonder those guys need the United Nations (read: the U.S. armed forces) to keep them from nuking each other. Funkstörung is a collaborative project funded in part by the European Ministry of Yoof Culture. I mean, if youthful Europeans are gonna go out clubbing and get ripped to the tits on euphorics and stimulants, they'd better do so to EU-regulated beats, right? So, in a 1992 committee meeting, the German cultural attaché and her Italian counterpart tabled the Funkstörung proposal. From an applicant pool of several hundred European leftfield DJs and producers, two were chosen. German Michael Fakesch and Italian Chris De Luca met each other not in a government office, but in a techno club. The government officials deemed that their getting- to- know- you process would move more swiftly away from the institutional building where their musical collaboration had been bullet- pointed, agenda'd, misfiled in triplicate, and finally, ministerially approved. Though Fakesch and De Luca have produced a small series of 12- inchers for the Music aus Strom label, their main contribution to the cultural life of the joyous European Union has been their remixes. Additional Productions collects them in one handy 5"" disc. Sticking to their parliamentary mandate, they've employed all the EU- approved avant-ish clicks, pops, scratches, crunches, cracks, snaps, and whirs. So whether they're remixing Bjork's ""All is Full of Love,"" the Wu-Tang Clan's ""Reunited,"" East Flatbush Project's ""Tried by Twelve"" or Finitribe's ""Mind My Make Up,"" you're assured of getting the elegant, but identical, quality product. As uncollected singles, these tracks would stand out from the usual remix toss (y'know, the ubiquitous ""Club 69"" mix, or Junior Vasquez churning out yet another product from his infamous Sound Factory). But though the source material may vary, the- one- style- fits- all Funkstörung process gives this album a high- quality blandness. And does it really matter that Funkstörung sound like Autechre lite? Well, sort of, yes. The thrill of listening to Autechre is that sometimes their industrial tendencies get the better of them and their humanity gets consumed by their algorithmically- driven machines. At other times, Autechre take the same clangs and crunches far away into serendipitous beauty. But with Funkstörung, you always know exactly what you're getting. What a boon in these days of such bewildering consumer choices!

But after listening to the over- anticipated third album from Underworld, I want to hunt down the mysterious Venician riff-raff author of this scribble (I picture him in a beret, scarf, and JNCO pants) and kiss him.

As far back as 1997, the hyperactive music press had been awaiting Underworld's followup to the brilliant Second Toughest in the Infants, or more specifically the Trainspotting epic, ""Born Slippy,"" released like a boogie board on the crest of the electronica wave. Finally, after settling on the ridiculous title Beaucoup Fish, Underworld have finally answered. And it shouldn't surprise anyone in today's age of shattered expectations that Beaucoup Fish is not as great as we'd hoped. But, of course, what we had hoped for was the OK Computer of electronic music. Lofty. The final product lies more like The Bends of house music. My legs and ass must admit that Underworld that can make me dance. Anyone who knows me, realizes the grand scale of this accomplishment. I have the rhythm of a poodle on his hind legs, begging for a milkbone. Jungle junkies looking for seizure beats and caffeinated tempos look elsewhere. Go pick up some Autechre or Squarepusher. Beaucoup Fish's thump comes direct and in repetition, a 50/50 mix of ambient synthphonies and thudding digital funk with a splash of rock and roll. Actually, Beaucoup Fish succeeds most when miming rock. ""Push Upstairs,"" built on a pounding piano loop, could be a Girls Against Boys number, if GVSB completely got rid of stringed instruments. A pal o' mine complains that ""Bruce Lee"" sounds like the opening to a Thriller-era Michael Jackson tune. Well, yeah. That's why it's cool. Unlike other techno groups, Underworld relies heavily on vocals. And a vocoder effect. Lots of vocoder effect. Although, the vocoder might just be covering up some downright silly lyrics. Underworld loves to chant a pastiche of commercial slogans, colors, consumer vocabulary, and whatever words they just think sound cool. Sometimes this works. And when it doesn't, you're stuck with lines like ""King of snake/ King of snake/ King of snake/ King of snake."" I'm not positive, but the lyrics for ""Bruce Lee"" might be built on the repetition of ""Life is/ Juice from a box/ Bruce Lee."" Underworld, being artists and designers, might try to label this ""a postmodern commentary on the accursed share of capitalist dogma."" Don't believe the hype. Beaucoup Fish has no meaning in daylight and sobriety. Underworld have crafted a deeply agoraphobic record that demands the ambience of neon-lit city streets, the backseat of a boxy Japanese import, or the flesh-pressed dancefloor of a clubs with names like Fuse, Fix, Flux, Fax and Flick. Beaucoup Fish is a record for quantum body activity-- either let your body completely relax or completely move. As shallow as it sounds, Underworld are just sound cool and sexy. They're as inexplicably addictive as fashion, and just as inexplicably disposable. But isn't that what makes us like them?","Last month I visited Venice.

Carboot Soul,Nightmares on Wax,by: Ryan Schreiber,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Founder</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c3f9ea9e61561daa8044/1:1/w_160/d96308d4.gif,1999-04-12 06:01:40,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5794-carboot-soul/,MatadorWarpMatadorWarp,"It's the first part of 1995. Portishead have just blown the doors of the trip-hop phenomenon wide open with their debut. Tricky's ridin' on the genre's crest with his critically- acclaimed debut, Maxinquaye, as are Massive Attack with their sophomore effort, Protection. Next thing you know, trip-hop's on the stereo at every party and on the lips of every artsy hipster. Finally, knock- off bands like Hooverphonic and Morcheeba start making it big and interest in trip-hop wanes faster than you can say ""Everything But The Girl."" Fast- forward to the middle of 1999. Trip-hop's dead and buried, with jungle and drum-n-bass hot on its tail. The sounds of so many credible electronic labels-- Ninja Tune, Looking Good, Astralwerks-- have started to sound less than refreshing. We look to England's Warp Records for a sign that electronic music isn't dead. We receive Nightmares on Wax's Carboot Soul. Is all hope lost? Sure, Warp's got all the great artists these days-- Squarepusher, Aphex Twin, Jimi Tenor, Autechre, Plaid, Boards of Canada... but exactly where does Nightmares on Wax fit in? Let me explain: Carboot Soul sounds like instrumental trip-hop with a side of soul and a dab of cartoony. Nightmares' main man, George Evelyn, claims to have been raised on soul music. Supposedly, he's more influenced by Stevie Wonder and Marvin Gaye than by Giorgio Moroder and Ryuichi Sakamoto. But I'm gonna pull a Judge Judy and say, ""You know what? I don't think so. Mr. Evelyn, do you think I was born yesterday? Shh! Shh! Shoosh! You were raised on the Carpenters and Abba just like everybody else. Don't try to come off with some ultra- hip sheen like from day one, you were just all that when it came to music. I know. I'm not stupid, George. I find for the plaintiff."" The truth is, while Carboot Soul is indeed a soulful record, it's too often completely derisive of everything that's already been done in electronic and hip-hop music. Yeah, it makes a great soundtrack for a low- ridin' cruise around the city in your convertible 1969 Galaxie 500, but y'know, not many people have convertible retromobiles. And of the ones that do, very few of them actually ever take it for a low- ridin' cruise around the city. And of those people, most will take something a little more original along for the ride than Carboot Soul. I hope.","It's the first part of 1995.

Peloton,The Delgados,by: Sarah Zupko,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a9009d034d5c69bf3ba0/1:1/w_160/8618af1a.gif,1999-04-06 05:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2265-peloton/,Beggars Banquet,"If you're wondering where the next hot music scene might turn up, you could be looking at Scotland. No, really. Lately, the flood of truly great music has been pouring out of England's northern cousin like some kind of burst dam. Now, hold it right there: you need to just drop your preconceived notions. It's not like all they've got is the precious twee- pop of Belle and Sebastian and Adventures In Stereo, and the power pop of Teenage Fanclub and BMX Bandits, y'know. Owing as much a debt to the Pixies, Sonic Youth, and '70s rock as to Britpop, bands like Yatsura, the Beta Band, and Bis have sent a 100,000 watt jolt of electricity through the heart of a music scene left rather barren since the bottom fell out on the Edwyn Collins market. Glasgow's Delgados, despite their having been around for a few years, firmly fit in with this new camp and, along with the Beta Band, are among rock's more promising acts. Alright, I have to admit it: the Delgados' pristine pop does owe something to the sound of bands like Belle and Sebastian. But by adding a healthy dose of attitude, distortion (check out ""Repeat Failure""), unpredictable dynamics, strong beats, and more varied instrumentation, they've created more engaging and interesting work than their Scottish colleagues. The alternating boy/ girl vocals are a nice touch as well, but... is it just me, or does Emma Pollock sound a bit like Isabel Monteiro from Drugstore? As with the heralded Manic Street Preachers, you have to give this band big ups for their ingenious use of orchestral instruments-- it always pays off, adding gorgeous layers to already near- perfect songs. All this adds up to a great record, which could easily end up on many ""Best of '99"" lists. I know it's going on mine.","If you're wondering where the next hot music scene might turn up, you could be looking at Scotland. No ...

Four lucky listeners had a shot at winning a Saturn Sedan. The pony- tailed DJs parked the four- door by the escalator rotunda in the newest mall in the suburban area, and all four slap- happy listeners had to live in the car, in the mall, for as long as possible. The contest cops allowed the listeners out from the boxy domestic once a day for an hour so they could wipe off with hot towels, defecate, and buy Cinnabons. Whichever listener could endure the lumbar pains the longest and outlast the others in this bucket- seat endurance would win the ride. The lure of the ten- grand, plastic, door- stop- shaped automobile drove these four people to live in the Saturn for nearly the length of a WNBA season. After listening to Fountain of Wayne's mall- walking soundtrack, Utopia Parkway, I kept thinking back to those four contestants with comma- shaped spines trapped in the Saturn, where they usually set up Santa's Village. This entire album sounds like it was recorded by four white guys in a Saturn parked by the foodcourt. Nothing here exists outside of the world of sprinklers, sprinkles, and sport quenchers. This album is suburbia perfectly captured by four suburbanites with suburban sounds-- neon, sod, and concrete pressed into DAT plastic. Perhaps their accomplishment is to be commended, but then again... it's suburbia, and how banal is that? I'm scratching my head trying to come up with new ways of saying ""sugary sweet."" There's been a glut of pure guitar pop recently, and not even my thesaurus can help. It seems like every young kid with a Fender has been buying a Beatles franchise recently, and shoveling out crisp Rubber Soul rip-offs. But out of the current batch of vended pop that's sitting on my review pile, this record's gum stuck least in my memory hairs. To make sure the album ages badly, Fountains of Wayne throw in silly pop culture references such as ""the guy from Korn"" and Pink Floyd laser- shows, which wouldn't be so bad if it was done with any sense of lyrical ingenuity. I mean, I'll take Pavement's ""What about the voice of Geddy Lee..."" over ""the guy from Korn"" any day. One of Utopia Parkway's highlights is a well- acted ballad about Senior Prom that would break Seth Green's heart. It's a nice song and all, but I can't help hearing it playing over the slow- dance scene in ""She's All That 2: A Bag of Chips."" If an album could ever be accused of being too nice, this would be it. Nothing offends. No sound feels out of place. No vocal is out of harmony. And you know what? It's boring.

Being of the optimist persuasion, I argued the benefits of looking forward, not letting the past ruin the future, and motorized sex toys. She, a mildly embittered and cynical gal, seemed determined to cling to her failures and drive hope out of her perspective. Heartbreaking, especially since my dream is to hold her in my arms for a long, soulful kiss... ...And into my hands falls Beulah. It was on my kitchen counter, quietly begging my attention away from her. I put it into the player, upstairs on a purple Sunday, my thoughts still running circles around her orbit. Imagine my wry amusement to stumble upon this acrylic gem of poppiness-- shiny, clean and vulnerable, not unlike the lust that has evolved into something better in the past months. Kicked back and chillin', I let Beulah wash into my brain and it was nice. It turned out to be far more advanced than its predecessor. Beulah's 1997 release, Handsome Western States was a better- than- average pop record, seemingly recorded at home on a relatively low budget. But this new record... what was different about it? The liner notes supported what I heard: a whole mess of horns and strings, integrated into the tightly played, laid-back melodies that made Handsome Western States so awesome. Tremendously clean production further enhances this album, which leaves me wanting more after its painfully brief 34:00 running time. Standouts include ""Emma Blowgun's Last Stand,"" which has an extended intro that would be at home on a Tortoise album, breaks into a compellingly catchy melody built around a brass fanfare. Most tracks employ several levels of sound, giving what could have easily been merely ""another indie pop record"" astonishing depth and texture. The tone could best be called ""tempered bouncy,"" never getting to an annoying level of repetition or predictability, but also nearly impossible to drive out of one's head after several listens. Oh, another good one just kicked in; ""Ballad of the Lonely Argonaut,"" it's taking me on a trip into sleepiness... ...And in the dream Beulah is soundtracking the awkward moment of the hug gone to kiss, her small hands on my back, her hair falling upon her jacket, and the smell of sandalwood. The sky is amber, the Beulah boys are wrapping their tapestry of hopeful sound around us and, looking into her eyes, our lips touch...","Maybe it was the bitter cold, maybe it was the fleeting odor of burning wood or the miles of forest ...

Dead Bees on a Cake,David Sylvian,by: Michael Sandlin,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a61eea9e61561daa52cc/1:1/w_160/12ca8907.gif,1999-03-30 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7682-dead-bees-on-a-cake/,Virgin,"""Headphones on. The mind- altering fungi has turned your brain cells to glowing embers. You lie on your back, looking past a gathering of treetops in the bamboo forest. But the trees aren't really trees; they're actually large wind instruments growing out of the ground. Mother Nature controls the valves and blows a light, steady stream of air up from the earth's core, and through a copse of tree- woodwinds. Now there's a huge multi- layered drone backing up the high notes of harmonizing hummingbirds, while wood- nymphs whistle along. Wolves give digeridoo howls. Woodpeckers tap out their staccato percussion, a chorus of crickets chirp their accompaniment, and a rhythmically- inclined panda bear pounds on hollow tree stumps in the distance. All the sounds are in perfect unison like some vast aboriginal orchestra. But this is no ordinary trip, you're experiencing David Sylvian's organically- grown multiform sound- universe."" --Excerpt from my upcoming novel, ""Mushroom Clouds in My Mind, Man"" Alright, nevermind the Kerouac-ian bullshit. But you get the idea. I mean, Dead Bees on a Cake isn't exactly akin to the incidental soundtrack music of some boring nature film made by Gorp- chomping hippie conservationists. There's a certain rare meld of both primal and postmodern compositional sense being applied here. Sylvian blends his different ethnic influences seamlessly, in a manner that shames the trendy world- beat affectations making appearances on so many British and American songwriters' albums. And sure, sometimes Sylvian's only a pan flute coo or zither- pluck away from officially crossing into Windham Hill territory, and joining the lifetime opening- for- Kitaro circuit. But hey. Having been a member of synth- rock pioneers Japan, I guess it seems only natural that Sylvian would eventually record with someone authentically Japanese. Good thing he decided to work with arranging/ composing genius Ryuichi Sakamoto, and not, say, Yoko Ono or nasty ol' Yamatsuka Eye. Dead Bees on a Cake is nothing less than a continuation of Sylvian's eclectic series of genre- hopping solo albums-- the best of which is probably his first major collaborative effort with Sakamoto, 1984's Brilliant Trees. When you're like Sylvian-- able to attract the likes of Robert Fripp (who plays on 1993's God's Monkey), Bill Frisell, and Talvin Singh and have them function as your sidemen-- you know you've finally become that semi- obscure but critically- acclaimed rock enigma you've always dreamed of becoming, right? Even Marc Ribot decides to contribute some inimitable guitar work on this latest album, miraculously tearing himself away from his busy schedule playing with every single musician in New York City. Dead Bees leads off with the spare, soul- drenched ""I Surrender,"" and gives some foreshadowing of what's to come. Ribot's traditional jazz octave- playing shares space with abbreviated flugelhorn parts, flute, and tape- looped guitar ornamentation (the funk- inflected churn of ""God Man"" suggests Mitchell Froom could have had his busy paws on the mixing board at some point, although there's no documented proof). But in many cases, just a guitar and vocals are apparently enough to satisfy Sylvian. For instance, on ""Dobro #1,"" Bill Frisell handles the dobro duties while Sylvian simply sings. Or you may get an arrangement like the one on ""Pollen Path,"" consisting of slide guitar, samples, drums, and Sakamoto on ""insects."" Each track comes together in the sense that no one instrument or effect is ever really featured over another-- and that includes Sylvian's low, breathy vocals. His vocal cadences fit snugly around whatever instrumentation happens to be floating about. The songs also benefit from Sakamoto's arranging expertise, in that he seems to know exactly where and when to add the odd orchestral quirk, appropriate sound snippets, or coordinate a string or brass arrangement. Sylvian's intrepid, near- subliminal use of samples proves to be an approach far beyond the grasp of most shameless sample- happy ""progressive"" groups. He extracts bits and pieces from the Mahavishnu Orchestra, John Cage, John Lee Hooker and Charles Brown's 1946 Cash Box award- winning single ""Driftin' Blues,"" slowly and subtly interspersing the sampled contents into a song's framework. ""Driftin' Blues"" and samples of Hooker's ""I'm Wanderin'"" serve as the ostensible basis for Sylvian's unorthodox interpretation of simple blues on ""Midnight Sun."" Pretty heady stuff it is, especially compared to the output of millions of musically- illiterate con-men who steal huge chunks of old Motown hits or spy- movie themes and add a trip-hop beat, just before insisting that the result be hailed as serious work of art. Talvin Singh makes an indispensable contribution, conjuring up some spicy raga rhythms on ""Krishna Blue"" and ""All My Mother's Names."" The latter transports you to an ambient never- neverland where Singh's Zen- like tabla beats become one with the throbbing of your eardrums and Ribot's guitar becomes the stuff of personification, as it unleashes primal screams and experiences fits of electronic epilepsy. Other extra- terrestrial sound samples fade in and out, and before long, you find yourself spinning out of control in something resembling the opening credits of ""The Twilight Zone."" (Wave to the giant E=MC2 figure as it floats by! There it goes!) Sadly, Dead Bees on a Cake will most likely be received like every other David Sylvian solo project-- that is, with uniform indifference in America and a maybe few eyebrow raisings in Europe. True, for die- hard Japan fans expecting another Gentlemen Take Polaroids, or Adolescent Sex, this may at first sound to you like stuff you'd only listen to during an Oriental massage or a Calgon bath. But don't be fooled. Sylvian's lyrics are poetic and rarely dull, and the album's unmistakably advanced musical vision makes it pretty tough to dismiss as mere new age pap.","""Headphones on.

It was back in '96 with the release of their album Lama Rabi Rabi. At the time, I'd just moved to scenic Albertville, Minnesota, a small, isolated hick town about 40 miles north of Minneapolis and 40 miles south of St. Cloud. I'd relocated to Albertville to operate a telemarketing room in St. Cloud-- the company had offered me crazy money and, being a naive young lad, I felt that it was the logical next step in achieving a lifetime of working my ass off for the man. Those six months were easily the most depressing of my entire life-- the money I'd been promised never came through, I couldn't even almost afford my rent (at the end of my lease, I owed well over $2,000 to my good friend Donna over at Blue Star Properties), and before I knew it, I was broke and in the kind of debt that would give most grown men nightmares. In my time of need, I found peace with Ghost's Lama Rabi Rabi, which had just been released at the time. I'd drive the 40 miles to St. Cloud daily, leaving the apartment promptly at 8:00 a.m. Ghost would follow me there, comforting me, pulling the tears from my eyes. Alright, it wasn't that bad. But regardless, there was Ghost, their blend of folky psychedelia and ethereal production leading me to a hell I knew I could not escape. But times have changed. After three long years in the telemarketing biz, I finally got out. I'm now happily self- employed, living in the world's greatest city, Chicago, and engaged to be married in October. So it seems ironic that, at probably the best point of my life, just as I received my state and federal tax returns, Ghost would again return to my mailbox, greeting me with an album that is the exact aural equivalent of pure beauty. For the last three days, I've been walking around Chicago, getting various things done and listening to Snuffbox Immanence on the handy ol' Discman. And y'know, as good as Lama Rabi Rabi was, the new disc is worlds better. As with their last record, it's surprisingly diverse. Sure, the primary focus is still psychedelic ""chamber- folk"" (as a sticker on the jewel case proudly proclaims), but you also get pop songs structured around traditional Japanese melodies (""Obiit 1961""), instrumental harp- style magic (""Tempera Tune""), and of all things, a Rolling Stones cover (""Live With Me""). Snuffbox Immanence is the first of two simultaneously released new Ghost records. The other, Tune In, Turn On, Free Tibet, admittedly sports an embarrasingly bad title. It's also supposedly filled to the brim with anit- Chinese propaganda, but I haven't listened to it yet. I've been far to preoccupied with this disc. But for all my raving, I'm finding it beyond my capabilities to fully explain how tremendously nice to listen to this album is. Oh, so nice. Again, I say-- nice! Eh, to hell with it.

Go ahead. Look down. What do you see? Yep. Stars. Disorienting? Juno just managed to boost your sorry ass to space. There's something so picayune about one- guitar bands. And sure, two guitars is nice, but flaccid. They can play off each other, dance, jab, parry, rock in unison, etc. But is it really enough? Now, three guitars-- that's where it's at. While all those other meager two- guitar bands plink away in garages, Juno adds that wonderful extra digit, the third guitar-- the opposable thumb of rock and roll. Now all the other bands can do is watch from the ground and be eaten by lions while Juno swings and climbs through the branches, making fists, building tools to evolve, and occasionally throwing feces at all those who oppose them. With three guitars Juno has volume, and I don't mean in the decibel sense. Although just to rub it in, they have that, too. Let's see what other bands have three guitars these days, shall we? Radiohead. They're doing pretty well for themselves. Critics love to erroneously throw around the shallow moniker of ""the American Radiohead""-- a title that holds less water than a Saharan Bedouin's bladder on a steady diet of potato chips. But with all sincerity, I'm here to tell you that Juno are the Radiohead of punk rock. This is the Way It Goes and Goes and Goes opens with a somnambulist's tired mumble over flumes of swirling guitar and typewriter percussion that brings to mind Rodan slo-mo crashing into My Bloody Valentine in bubbling, soft explosions. Things excellerate quickly on ""Rodeo Programmers,"" a searing rocker that stabs hot guitars at your chest as Arlie Carstens sneers great lines like, ""I've got a time- bomb lost inside my chest"" as if he has two little Bob Moulds shoved up his nostrils. ""Leave A Clean Camp and a Dead Fire"" begins in a crescendoing Cure-ish swell before blowing the dam open. Similarly, ""January Arms"" floats on chiming, cherubic melodies before a jagged riff brings in the Saturn 5- sized rock. Dangerous and beautiful like Liz Hurley sitting on an A-Bomb during a La Jolla sunset, Juno swoop down on angel's wings before ripping them off and hurling them at your throat. As you can tell by the number of times I've used the words ""guitar"" in this review, this album will take off a layer of skin before caressing you in lotion.

Bet'cha didn't know that. Now you do. According to the All Music Guide, the guys in the band are rumored to lead sort of nomadic existences, ""drifting from ruins of ancient temples to disused subway stations around Tokyo."" While that sounds glamorous and all, I'm not sure it's really the case. See, Ghost are relatively prolific. They usually unleash albums on us unsuspecting North American citizens in groups. Their American debut, the beautiful Lama Rabi Rabi, was released in the Spring of 1996. Ghost returned to the scene in 1997 with three albums: a decent self- titled record, Second Time Around (which is supposedly one of their best-- I still have to make it to the record store for that one), and a live album called Temple Stone. (Not to mention Ghost frontman Masaki Batoh's two solo albums.) Yeah, those were all released in 1997. Now, for those of you lacking calendars, it's 1999, and Ghost are back with two new records: the incredible Snuffbox Immanence and Tune In, Turn On, Free Tibet. For the record, Snuffbox Immanence is the better of these two releases. (I reviewed it a couple of months ago-- check the archive for the low- down.) Tune In, Turn On, Free Tibet appears to be a more casual affair. This time around, the band seems less interested in arrangements and songwriting structure, and more into freeform psychedelia. Free Tibet is, as could be suspected, more of that good ol' fashioned anti- Chinese propaganda that's so in style right now. The disc's liner notes even feature a lengthy statement regarding the current situation in Tibet written by the Dalai Lama's liaison officer (who, apparently, doesn't have a name). It talks about the usual stuff: oppression, ethnic minorities, severe deforestation, etc. But it's what's on the record that counts, isn't it? Okay, I'm getting to that. The eight songs that comprise Free Tibet blend together in such a way that the album comes off more like one piece with eight movements. Sure, it wouldn't have hurt if they'd tossed a little more diversity in with these tracks, but what they've got serves its purpose well enough. The purpose, of course, was to record beautiful protest songs, a concept that's rarely been executed in indie rock. And they succeeded. These songs are beautiful and they do make valid points. The problem is, they just don't go anywhere. Despite my endless infatuation with Snuffbox Immanence, Free Tibet seems more like an afterthought than a follow-up. There's a lot of sameness to these tracks, with the exception of the record's sparkling gem, ""Way to Shelkar."" The album's closer and title track is one of the best examples of this: it's a 34- minute- long ambient jam with little variation to keep the listener interested. Where's the inspiration, man? Where's the love, brotha? I wanna feel the love! I wanna hear the anger! Give us some emotion! These guys are capable of recording fantastic drug music-- they are, without a doubt, masters of modern psychedelia. But if there's one thing the world doesn't need, it's another product with the words ""Free Tibet"" in its title. Instead, go grab yourself a copy of Snuffbox Immanence and find out why Ghost are being called ""the new donkey sex.""",,5.7,
Come On Die Young,Mogwai,by: Brent DiCrescenzo,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c380ea9e61561daa7f2a/1:1/w_160/8f0c8096.gif,1999-03-29 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5369-come-on-die-young/,Matador,"In the Pitchfork tradition of groundbreaking review styles, I present you with the Always- Right Critomatic album review. Simply scroll to the review you want to read-- the opinion that you, the infallible reader, wants to hear-- and proceed. We here in the Pitchfork labs are always striving towards innovations for the future. Pro-Mogwai: You slip on your headphones... Guitar chords twist down from lavender skies in slithering fibers and attach to your goose- bumped skin. With each upward strum from the plaintive second album from Mogwai, these delicate cables tug you heavenward-- they're soft tugs, paced and patient. As you ascend further into the clouds you can make out the ground below you. The Scottish Highlands, God's golf course, bubbles in pillowy hills. Green grass hills filled with warm fat, feathers, and the carefully dug tunnels of fairies and elves roll to the sea, where they suddenly drop off in marble cliffs, wet from the spray of slapping waves. A storm is brewing in the distance. Thunder rumbles. Mogwai's music is weather. Its landscape, stunning in its simplicity and reduncancy. Come On Die Young develops in one long movement, a sparse symphony of indie. You can follow its pattern like a weatherman charts flows from high pressure to low pressure. Unlike Mogwai's last album, which constantly shifted from loud loud to quiet quiet, Come On Die Young builds tension over eight and a half songs before erupting in the white noise of ""Ex-Cowboy,"" ""Chocky"" and ""Christmas Steps,"" the latter being the only respite from restraint for the riffheads. But it's the album's title track, carrying the record's only vocal, sung in soft sighs, that pulls apart your heart like string cheese, muscle fiber by muscle fiber. Like a bottle of fine wine, Mogwai is not intended to be ingested on every humdrum day you live. It's not to be played as you drive to the Target to pick up some plastic adhesive hooks. Keep Come On Die Young on a cedar rack in a damp basement. Reserve it for thunderstorms and candlelight. Its open spaces and moments of silence are meant to be filled with raindrops and whispers of awe. Con-Mogwai: Fo'ckin bollocks! Where's the rock? Listening to Mogwai's Come On Die Young excites as much as toasting white bread with a magnifying glass in the sun on a partially- cloudy day. Here's the thing, if Mogwai weren't from the UK, no one would give a rat's arse about them. I call this phenomenon the ""3 Colours Red Effect,"" which states that any British band that plays a style of music that is completely overdone in America, but not particularly in the UK, they will achieve success in their native land. Would 3 Colours Red's brand of polished grunge sell any more than a new Gruntruck or Paw record? Call up Sony and find out. Likewise, would Mogwai's brand of third generation post- Slint instrumentals raise anyone's attention outside of those few Chicago college kids who still listen to Spiderland religiously? In the UK, Mogwai open for the Manic Street Preachers (who are amazingly big in the UK) and headline festivals. If they were from Urbana, Illinois they'd be on Quarterstick Records at best, opening for June of 44 at the Blind Pig. Come On Die Young's most exciting track, ""Christmas Steps,"" sounds like an unfinished Sweep the Leg Johnny song (i.e., minus the vocals, sax, more complex tempo changes, etc.), which, while pretty decent, is not enough to get you a spot opening for Everclear in the States. This is not to say that fame is an essential element to good music. I'm just pointing out that Mogwai could perhaps be the most over- hyped indie rock band in the world. There are much better bands doing the same thing from the back of vans across the US. Young Team, Mogwai's last record, painted in bolder strokes. Feedback and riffs burst unexpectedly from beautiful melodies. I found myself hunching over the boombox waiting for Come On Die Young to develop. Then my back got sore. For an instrumental album, the playing is not mathy or complex enough to evoke interest. I mean, have you ever been to Scotland? It's constantly cloudy. Decaying industrial towns pop up in rusty clusters over barren hills. The locals drink to make their livers pop. It's not surprising Mogwai comes from this environment of incessant gloom and fog, where there's not much to do but fondly recall history and sulk. Poorly Written, Ambiguous Indie Zine Review: Mogwai are an instrumental band from Glasgow, Scotland. They play quiet indie rock. If you like Slint and its spin- offs, check them out.","In the Pitchfork tradition of groundbreaking review styles, I present you with the Always- Right Critomatic album review. Simply scroll ...

FM (Fantasma reMixes),Cornelius,by: Ryan Schreiber,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Founder</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a665b1335d7bf1698e08/1:1/w_160/171d635b.gif,1999-03-09 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1608-fm-fantasma-remixes/,Matador,"Last year, Japanese crazy artist Cornelius' American debut, Fantasma, found itself at or near the top of hundreds of critics' lists. How did this happen? Simple: people like the silly. Of course, Cornelius has more going for him than just the silly. First off, he's a pretty awesome producer-- Fantasma was clear evidence of the fact that he's got skillz in the studio. Secondly, he's an even bigger star in Japan than he is in America (there, he moved half a million copies of Fantasma, and sold out his own multimedia concert event at the Budokan with tickets going for a mere $50 a piece). Third, he's got connections. Connections? You read right, sweetheart. Dig some of the names remixing his work on FM: Money Mark, the High Llamas, Buffalo Daughter, the Pastels, Blur's Damon Albarn, UNKLE, Coldcut... the list goes on. And, honestly, it's a pretty decent remix record. (With names like that, how could it not be? Honestly!) Naturally, some of these mixes stand out more than others. Damon Albarn's remix of ""Star Fruits Surf Rider,"" despite its serious conceptual theft of the talking Macintosh voice from Radiohead's ""Fitter, Happier,"" is pretty cool-- you'll dig the added vocals and the spacy, moog- laden groove. As could be expected, the High Llamas' take on ""The Micro Disneycal World Tour"" is, not surprisingly, Llama-ized-- it actually sounds more like a Cornelius remix of a High Llamas song instead of the other way around. Pizzicato Five mastermind Konishi Yasuharu's tops ""Count 5, 6, 7, 8"" with an ass- crazy pre- programmed piano part that gives new meaning to the term ""really, really fast."" Coldcut also make a nice comeback from their mediocre remix of Steve Reich's ""Music for 18 Musicians"" from the Reich Remixed compilation-- they get down with their bad selves on ""Typewrite Lesson,"" adding elements of drum-n-bass, instructional records, laughter, documentaries, turntablism, and lots of typewriters. On the other hand, UNKLE's mix of ""Free Fall,"" while boasting DJ Shadow's trademark nasty rhythmic assaults, shows our man Josh Davis slipping further out of his shadow of talent and into a bottomless pit of self- indulgence and wankery. Buffalo Daughter somehow manage to make ""New Music Machine"" sound like an awful PJ Harvey cover, and Money Mark's version of ""Mic Check"" is, to put it nicely, dreadfully boring. I wonder if its companion disc, CM, is any better... I guess we'll find out later.","Last year, Japanese crazy artist Cornelius' American debut, Fantasma, found itself at or near the top of hundreds of critics ...

Singles 1989-1991,The Wedding Present,by: Jason Josephes,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a9e19d034d5c69bf3d28/1:1/w_160/9f744ee8.gif,1999-03-09 06:00:01,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8598-singles-1989-1991/,Manifesto,"Less really is more. Take the Wedding Present, for example. Here's a collection of singles that spans two entire CDs, if only because disc two is padded with a bunch of previously unreleased live cuts. That's two whole CDs of nothing but the Wedding Present, a band known for playing loud and wiry songs at the speed of light while lead singer David Gedge makes like he's trying to punch out the brown. It's not bad, but two CDs? It gets old. Not fast, but old none the less. If you're a fan, you've already got the original singles, but you may want the live tracks. Okay. That's my whole review. While I have you here, though, I'd like to get on the ol' soapbox about one of my big musical peeves: the cover. I love a good cover song, the key word here being ""good."" There are several covers on this Wedding Present compilation and none of them are good except for Pavement's ""Box Elder."" The rest can be summed up quality-wise just by mentioning what they are. Tom Jones' ""It's Not Unusual,"" for instance, shouldn't be covered, just like any other Tom Jones song. Nothing against Tom-- Mr. Jones and me go back to the early days of the Counting Crows, for Christ's sake-- but the moment a bunch of scrappy and decidedly unsexy kids take on the human pelvis' material, they've lost all credibility. ""But don't you see? It was done for a laugh."" Even worse. I'm not laughing. I also didn't laugh during the obligatiory Lou Reed cover. At this point in musical history, it doesn't even matter which Lou Reed song is covered. Bands like Lou Reed covers because they don't have to work too hard to get it right. Hey, can I get you boys some pillows in case you want to have a bit of a lie down? And the less said about the cover of ""Cumberland Gap,"" the less time I spend on the topic of bad covers. If you're in an up- and- coming band, please do us all a favor and stay away from the works of the following artists: The Beatles, because you're probably never leaving the basement, and I'm talking to you, Absolute Zero of Kirkland, WA. The Bee Gees, because you're not that clever. Prince, because the audience will never be that drunk. Peter Gabriel, because life isn't an Emma Bull book. R.E.M., because at this late in the game, it's like asking your dad if you can borrow one of his ties. Jimi Hendrix, because you're not the Beatles.","Less really is more.

He's a Looper,
She's a Looper,
We're a Looper,
Wouldn't you like to be a Looper, too? Stuart David of Belle and Sebastian has handed a DIY book on home sampling out to any and all kids with a Casio keyboard and a tape recorder. He wants them to turn everyday life into a story set to music. And to quote something I read somewhere more than twice, ""lovely music it is."" David makes me happy because he writes happy songs. Hmm... I guess I should have more to say on the subject. Well, let's put it like this: David notices things and takes pleasure in them. He's someone who could sit on the front porch with a ray of sunlight touching his toes and realize that it was good. The songs on Up a Tree don't wander far from the backyard. Actually, three of them don't even leave the treehouse. There's one that tells the story of him and his wife Karn (who performs the visual half of Looper... adding slides and movies to their shows) and the letter- writing that led to their here and now. None of these are actually the best songs ever written, but they're fun. And the honesty with which David presents his stories along with the stripped down and earnest 'electronica' backing them is far fresher than pretty much anything you can hear on the radio today. I'd like to go to a club (I guess that means I have to go to a club) and shake my all to any of them, but I'd rather just sit in the grass and listen. ""The Ballad of Ray Suzuki"" professes David' belief that we all can be Loopers. Most people probably won't follow his lead, although I could envision some sort of folk-hop movement starting up on the college campuses. Drum machine, anyone? Care for a tape loop, madame? Sample yourself. Sample your friends. Just don't sample the Police or Led Zeppelin and perform rap Karaoke over them. No one would ever buy that.","I'm a Looper,

Rehearsals for Departure,Damien Jurado,by: Ryan Schreiber,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Founder</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ba43eb335119a49ec9aa/1:1/w_160/9de0f54b.gif,1999-03-04 06:01:40,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4324-rehearsals-for-departure/,Sub PopSub Pop,"Last time we caught up with Damien Jurado, he was cracking that wicked whip they call the pop song. On his 1997 Sub Pop debut, Waters Ave. S., Jurado wrote melodies that resonated with joy and sorrow while keeping things generally upbeat and excessively catchy. But there was one thing keeping the man down: he couldn't sing a lick. His cracking, warbling, off-key tenor was so painfully prevalent that it made the songs a bit difficult to listen to. A serious shame, too, 'cause in every other respect, Waters Ave. S.-- to quote that old legend of insanity, Wesley Willis-- whooped on a llama's ass. Two years have passed since that pretty excellent offering, and Jurado returns with Rehearsals for Departure, an album that improves on its predecessor in every department. The guy's vocals are the most immediately noticable difference-- he's still no Tony Bennett, but he's sounding great these days. On top of that, he's doing a brand new dance in the songwriting aisle. Jurado's new songs seem far more inspired by the introspective stylings of Springsteen or Neil Young than smiley pop stars. But Jurado hasn't abandoned the pop song. Tracks like ""Honey Baby"" and ""Letters and Drawings"" show he's got a knack for penning unforgettable, upbeat love tunes. But Rehearsals for Departure is, all told, a more personal record, complete with tales of longing and regret. ""Ohio"" is an elaborate and painfully sad tale of a girl deciding to return home years after being kidnapped by her father. ""Curbside"" is a surprisingly convincing post- breakup number that recalls those glorious first days of love. And ""Love the Same"" might be the loneliest number that he'll ever do. Of course, the thing that makes these tracks truly outstanding are Jurado's romantic and poetic lyrics-- the way he can make the most simple action sound so dramatic. On ""Ohio,"" he sings, ""She stands on the sidewalk/ Just waving at taxis/ Like horses and parades in passing."" In that line, he recalls the simplicity of childhood while tackling the frustrations of adulthood without even trying. It's lyrics like these, along with the occasional simple flourishes (like female background vocals, maracas, orchestration and simple harmonies) that really make Rehearsals for Departure a really great record.","Last time we caught up with Damien Jurado, he was cracking that wicked whip they call the pop song.

Though audiences were used to the skittering, rapid- fire electronic beats, video game sound effects and tinny keyboards of his prior releases, and despite his prior release, an EP he called Big Loada, garnering him the most critical acclaim of his entire career, the Squarepusher swapped genres. He released Music is Rotted One Note, a strictly jazz affair with no sequencers or breakbeats to be found, a total shock to fans and critics alike. Tom Jenkinson's gone in a similar direction on his new seven- track EP, Budakhan Mindphone. It's slightly less jazzy than Rotted One Note-- almost a combination of Squarepusher's two sounds. The opening track, ""Iambic 5 Poetry,"" is a late-nite '70s gangsta shuffle, boasting warm, orchestra- emulating keyboards, gentle feedback and a glockenspiel. It perfectly encapsulates the feel of a lonely and humid summer night. This is the shit that's gonna get sampled by rap groups in 2015. Meanwhile, tracks like the ambient ""The Tide,"" the swaggering, dischordant tones and tunnel reverb of ""Splask"" and the junk rhythm fest of ""Gong Acid"" show Jenkinson's horizons are ever- expanding. Budakhan Mindphone proves that Squarepusher clearly intends to keep on keepin' on, making new noise the likes of which the world may otherwise never have heard.","Last year, Squarepusher broke out of the drill-n-bass scene with a brand new record that offered a totally different sound ...

The execution is primitive, but its intent is logical. The music is elemental, having evolved from the ancestral types that serve as influences to their rough methodology. But a balanced rationale clearly governs Clinic's menacing aural approach. The song title ""I.P.C. Subeditors Dictate Our Youth"" signifies a blatant call to action against the modern-day bureaucratic mind-control that pervades youth markets both above and below ground. It indicates a deviant sense of purpose that more scrupulous medical practitioners lack. The surgeon's table has seen the inhumanly savage cut-and-paste of White Light/White Heat-era Velvet Underground with the rhythmic assault of Hal Blaine under Phil Spector's direction. The screams are Spector's own-- the sonic equivalent of studied horror from witnessing organs being spilled upon the sterile tile floor. The technique is concerned with brutal distortions of aesthetics. ""Porno"" aches and moans orgasmically to a warbled throbbing of keyboard and guitar. It's topped with indecipherable vocal incantations meant to terrorize those that have trouble grasping the deconstruction of rhythm within the context of terrible sex. An insidious affinity for indirect discourse is discernible in the otherwise unintelligible vocal approach. ""D.P."" and ""D.T."" are violent odes to sonic aggression, exemplified by the less sophisticated punk rockers of the '60s and '70s. ""Punk,"" having become a loaded political term, is applied here in the same way an anesthetic is administered for inducing numbness in wounded patients. The knives-out approach of these medical knaves belies the sadistic glee with which they patch their subjects together. The gruesome freshness of their product indicates a fruitful decomposition of influences from within-- the appropriation of life-blood from yesterday's walking dead imbues their macabre creations with mortal verisimilitude and stylistic panache. Shrouded in a skeletal grasp of melody, the most shocking prospect is the widespread acceptance of their unsound practices, and the slow unfolding of their message through the easily misconstrued language of rhythm and dissonance. Subversion has never sounded so palpably suicidal.","If you've never pondered the source of the rat-at-tat-tat boom-boom ascending from darkened alleyways, know that these sounds emanate ...

Summerteeth,Wilco,by: Neil Lieberman,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929aa329d034d5c69bf3dcd/1:1/w_160/02628a73.jpeg,1999-02-28 06:01:40,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8677-summer-teeth/,Reprise,"After parting ways with Uncle Tupelo partner Jay Farrar, Jeff Tweedy's first step was an unsteady one-- Wilco's A.M., like a nervous houseguest fidgeting to get comfortable on the couch, never found its vibe. Farrar, on the other hand, with Son Volt, confidently assumed his position as Americana's standard bearer. Things soon changed, however, as 1996's sprawling and ambitious Being There saw Wilco reimagining themselves as rock'n'roll revivalists with a drunken swagger, and winning the hearts of Uncle Tupelo fans and critics the world over-- Son Volt, meanwhile, stagnated on 1997's Straightaways, which, while not a bad record by any stretch, failed to innovate quite like Wilco had. The tide had turned, and Wilco found themselves unexpectedly on top. In 1998, Wilco teamed with British folkie Billy Bragg for Mermaid Avenue, a collection of Woody Guthrie lyrics paired with original music by the collaborating artists. Wilco lent a suitable Midwestern sensibility to the project, but with Guthrie putting the words in his mouth, Tweedy had yet to beat the biggest knock against him. By now, it was obvious that he had a knack for crafting instantly memorable melodies; the question was: what did he have to say? Just as the Velvets' swan song, Loaded, was packed with hit songs for critics who claimed Lou Reed was incapable of writing them, so too is Summerteeth Jeff Tweedy's statement of purpose. The album, a loose song cycle considering the intermingling of perception, communication, and reality, and its affect on our relationships, witnesses the band dismissing its country-rock sound for a studio sheen that would make Brian Wilson proud. Drawing on the pop music of their late-60s and early-70s youths, the band members have crafted a collection of immediately infectious and consistently stunning melodies with complex, layered arrangements. With the band having jettisoned Max Johnston and his dobro, fiddle, and mandolin, Summerteeth's songs are driven not by rustic guitar licks, but rather by Jay Bennett's grand organ fills and ever-present harmonies, which paint the album in Technicolor. Undermining this sticky-sweet pop party in a delicious irony, and ultimately supplying Summerteeth with its depth and success, is Tweedy's dark contemplation. The intrigue begins quickly on the album's opener, ""Can't Stand It"", which finds our narrator lamenting the end of a relationship over a pop-soul ditty punctuated by bells. As the source of the narrator's frustration crystallizes on his own fickle emotions, Tweedy plants the seeds of mistrust, warning of ""speakers speaking in code."" As the album racks up false realizations, startling confessions, and outright lies, listeners find themselves exchanging suspicious glances with their guides. Where ""Pieholden Suite"" dupes a sleeping lover, the frail ""We're Just Friends"" finds Tweedy lying only to himself. Similarly, the singer's resolve on the jubilant would-be self-help anthem ""Nothing'severgonnastandinmyway(again)"" is plastered like a forced smile, and cracks like, ""I'm a bomb, regardless,"" scar the façade. In fact, during the album's first half, only the overtly sarcastic ""How to Fight Loneliness"" is what it seems. The album's confusion climaxes during its keystone, the majestic ""Via Chicago"", and its counterpart ""ELT"". On the former, a scorned lover stews, ""I dreamed about killing you again last night/ And it felt alright with me."" Then, a couplet of unsettling stream-of-consciousness lyrics give way to Tweedy as he tears into a disturbingly deliberate, off-key guitar riff that might very well be the musical moment of 1999. Interestingly, the celebratory ""ELT"" finds our sad psychopath repented and healed: ""Oh, what have I been missing/ Wishing, wishing that you were dead."" Taken on its merits, the song is almost unimaginatively sincere, but in context, it becomes enigmatic. As the narrator shuffles his story for our approval, which spin are we to believe? Brilliantly, the album leaves such questions unanswered. As Tweedy removes his trickster mask for ""My Darling"", a spare lullaby to his young son, the mood of the album emerges, but Summerteeth's transformation is most apparent in its two recitals of ""A Shot in the Arm"". Amidst the incertitude of the album's twilight opening, its chorus, ""Maybe all I need is a shot in the arm/ Something in my veins/ Bloodier than blood,"" seems a ghoulish reference to drug addiction. However, its reprise, on the heels of the Elvis Costello-by-way-of-Phil Spector romp, ""Candyfloss"", seems to call on an inner strength and the fortitude for self-improvement. From its opener, in which ""our prayers will never be answered again,"" to ""In a Future Age"", where Tweedy challenges us to ""turn our prayers to outrageous dares,"" Summerteeth drags us through our interpersonal garbage, only to politely ask us to pick up after ourselves. Once drawn in by the album's addictive pop hooks, the band ensnares us with clever ironies and rich musical treatments that never let go. As the album admits its intricacies, it's clear that the band is growing exponentially. Having confidently abandoned their alt-country ghosts, Wilco has become a band from which we can expect everything and nothing at all. With Summerteeth, they've delivered on both counts, crafting an album as wonderfully ambiguous and beautifully uncertain as life itself.",,9.4,

Now, with groups like Pan Sonic, this old joke has a digital analog. This kind of post- post- post modern sound- shaping can seemingly be enjoyed by only the most open minded (or deluded) of consumers. I think Pan Sonic must have been what Mark Leyner was talking about when he wrote of ""the electronic music they use to drive fleas and cockroaches crazy."" Quickly, now, Pan Sonic used to be called Panasonic (they got in obvious copyright trouble) and they're two Finnish gents with a penchant for minimal, ambient electronica based on pure sine waves, static, and the tones of discarded machinery. Example: that sound your portable CD player makes when it spins a disc, that might take the place of the drums. That hum you get when you fire up your turntable and the grounding wire is not properly connected, that could be the bass. And the whir of your computer fan could be lead guitar. In short, think of them as Oval with a sense of rhythm; rather then entering the algorithms and letting the apparatus do the rest, they sculpt a variety of digital noises into something distantly related to standard musical order. The result is as ice cold as you would expect from sounds this divorced from the human hand. And to me, therein lies the interest. Much electronic music uses the heartbeat dance rhythm as a way to humanize, to take the sounds from the realm of physics into that which can be understood by the body. But when this connection is discarded, things can get interesting. You're forced to pay attention to details that would normally cause to you check the warranty on your equipment. It can be disorienting, nauseating even. You may feel funny. You may even feel like an idiot. But you will not say, ""I've heard this before.""","The old joke with Steve Reich's music was that if the record started skipping you could never be sure ...

"Apple Venus, Volume One",XTC,by: Zach Hooker,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929aad913d1975652139ae9/1:1/w_160/9367c107.gif,1999-02-23 06:00:06,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8835-apple-venus-volume-one/,TVTTVT,"The concept of late work isn't invoked in too many record reviews, no doubt owing to the fact that most bands don't live to see their third birthdays. There are very few popular musicians out there who produce for a sustained period of time, or whose output has the breadth or depth to warrant considering it as a body of work-- and when such an artist comes along, they're rewarded with a greatest hits collection, not a catalogue raisson. Anyway, people don't think of pop stars as artists-- for good reason really, even if those of us who listen to and write about popular music would prefer to think otherwise-- and ideas common to other forms of criticism very rarely find their way into rock reviews. Which is as it should be. Still, the idea of late work is arguably applicable to just about any pursuit which spans a couple decades, from sculpture to plumbing. And XTC has certainly been around long enough to qualify. See, here's the thing: people always diss late work. It doesn't matter if you're talking about Bob Mould or Bob Rauschenberg, there's always someone there to say, ""I just liked him better when..."" Sure, the people talking about Rauschenberg are probably going to use bigger words, but all they're saying is, ""I was hip to this guy when we were both young and nobody had ever heard of him and that makes me cooler than you."" Then again, some artists really do fall off as they age. Not only do they become less relevant and more irritating, but in many cases, they're actually laughable: Salvadore Dali and Fishbone spring to mind. Which is why Apple Venus is such a relief. XTC has made a bunch of records, several of which are great records, and then they didn't make a record for a long time-- like since the Bush administration-- and there a was a pretty good chance that this record was not going to be good. It was feared the album would show a band out of touch, past their prime and rusty. As it turns out, though, these guys were putting away a little nestegg of excellent songs during their strike, and Apple Venus finds them picking up pretty much where they left off. Or maybe even a little bit before they left off: this record bridges the gap between the ambitiously poppy Oranges and Lemons and the pastoral Skylarking. Lyrically, Apple Venus' main preoccupation is paganism. ""River of Orchids"" starts things off with a vision of the world reclaimed by nature; its overgrown highways and fossilized cars are like a less clever but more convincing version of the Talking Heads' ""Nothing but Flowers."" ""Easter Theater,"" ""Harvest Festival"" and ""Greenman"" take their turns with simlilar pagan issues. Even the album's packaging sports a little occultism, proclaiming ""Do what thou will but harm none""-- which some reviewers have taken as a polite note, but which is actually a more responsible version of Aleister Crowley's famous thelemic motto. What's remarkable about this album is the way it reveals itself. The first listen may slide by, the second and third will reveal a little more of interest, but by the fifth time through, Apple Venus is a vast landscape with lots of little places to dig and explore. The music is built on simple phrases, but the relationships between those phrases becomes tremendously complex. The lyrics invite repitition and close scrutiny, and prove there's a great deal beneath the suface. The art historian Erwin Panofsky said that a great late style married ""intense emotion and outward stillness."" Of course, he was writing about Titian, not pop music.","The concept of late work isn't invoked in too many record reviews, no doubt owing to the fact that ...

Burning Blue Soul,The The,by: Michael Sandlin,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a75d13d19756521393cf/1:1/w_160/3da6ff6a.gif,1999-02-23 06:00:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7981-burning-blue-soul/,4AD4AD,"Y'know, if only the Trenchcoat Mafia could've discovered The The instead of Marilyn Manson. When I was attending high school in the '80s, all us lonely, depressed potential sociopaths took solace in bands like The The, the Cure and Joy Division. If we merely killed ourselves, well, hey, it was enough. But good old fashioned self-immolation has become outmoded. Nowadays, you've gotta take a few dozen strangers down with you to really get off. And as usual, I attribute all the youth violence in society today not to the proliferation and accessibility of guns, but on the paucity of credible rock stars. Maybe I'm joking, maybe I'm not. But where the hell did all the Joe Strummers go? Now, I was raised in bible-belt Texas, so rest assured there was no shortage of firearms in our house. But luckily, instead of toting guns, the lost boys and girls of my generation either flocked to bad metal, or video games like ""Galaga."" Still others, out of desperation for something more substantial, went out and stumbled upon landmark albums like The The's official debut album, 1981's Burning Blue Soul. As stifling as things could get in Baptist country, The The lead vocalist Matt Johnson seemed to understand our isolation, and was explicit in his indictment of our parents' sham Christian mores. He made it okay to revel in our non-believing misfit gloom. His aetheistic gallows humor and cutting social commentary was delivered with a bracing defiance. His songwriting didn't induce the kind of feeble hopelessness that would normally lead a bored, confused suburban kid to lose it completely. Inhabiting a shadowy interzone between goth, new wave, and punk, Burning Blue Soul manages to plumb depths that Robert Smith and Peter Murphy could only lightly touch upon. Johnson delivers his kernels of realist wisdom in a flat Gregorian monotone: ""100,000 people were burned/ I felt a pang of concern/ What are we waitin' for/ A message of hope/ From the Pope/ I think he got shot as well."" And what over-ponderous mope-rocker can't relate to observations like this: ""When you hide in your bed/ And look in your head/ You find you've gone deeper than you should/ It could be your shallowness is your strength."" In a sense, the ghostly production values on Burning Blue Soul sound like fairly upstanding (and typical) 4AD fare: the isolated vocals, the guitars wet with reverb, the basslines slithering eerily along the nether regions of a song. Thick guitar hailstorms come and go. Textures vacillate from vaulted cathedrals of sound to barely discernible structures. ""The River Flows East in Spring"" is built around little more than a deformed keyboard hook and offbeat handclaps. There are no beginnings, middles or ends. Johnson completely shuns verse- chorus- verse predictability, and doesn't even find much need to tie down his songs with conventional drumming or consistent backbeats. Of course, Johnson eventually lured ex-Smiths guitarist Johnny Marr into the studio for 1989's ground-breaking Mind Bomb. Marr brought a richer and more grounded sound to Johnson's near- formless compositions. The band's sound eventually evolved into the mellow New Order-ish pop of 1993's Dusk, and took a detour with 1995's near-ridiculous batch of Hank Williams cover songs entitled Hanky Panky. So, here's a novel idea for all you alienated, potentially homicidal youngsters: try trading in those ridiculous Marylin Manson CDs, and pawn whatever artillery your NRA-member father bought you for Christmas. Cleanse your tortured souls in the church of Matt Johnson. Take heed, all ye little doom-obsessed freaks, Manson's music will eventually make you open a vein-- or worse, open fire on your peers. But most of all, realize that Manson's crusade is merely to open your little pocketbooks and swindle you out of those hard-earned weekly allowances. Take a listen to The The's Burning Blue Soul. The lovable folks at 4AD reissued it just for you. Maybe it'll even open a few of your minds to more pacific and productive possibilities of expressing all that pent-up hate.","Y'know, if only the Trenchcoat Mafia could've discovered The The instead of Marilyn Manson.

Other frontmen: Hi, Jason. Jason: I really don't know why I'm here. Well, okay, I know why I'm here, but I don't think I have a problem. It's just that, ever since my band Jellyfish split up, I can't stay out of the studio. I keep making these songs and putting out these records, and then I wait, and wait, and wait. But they never come. Soundgarden's Chris Cornell: Who never comes? Jason: The people, man! The people never come. I don't know why. They just don't seem to know I'm here. I never went away, so why did the people go away? Miles Hunt (of the Wonder Stuff): Because they don't care. Trust me, friend, I played empty stinking clubs half of last year, and all I got was free beer. Jason: Yeah but... but... I'm special. People loved me when I was in Jellyfish. I mean, we didn't sell a lot of records, but the critics liked us. Living Colour's Corey Glover: Doesn't matter. Once you get rid of that band name, you're no better than shit on a horse's hooves. People don't care... nobody cares. Jason: Maybe not for you, Body Glove, but I'm different. I sound like a baritone Jeff Buckley. I know how to make pop songs that are both lush and longing. Pulp tragedies, if you will. Frank Black: Hey, man. I was a fuckin' star! I was the frontman for the greatest band ever! I carried Kim Deal and those other pansyass motherfuckers on my back! They lived off the fruits of my labor! Ungrateful bastards. Jellyfish wasn't even that great. So you had a couple of big songs. Woopdy shit! I have a whole collection of good songs, and look at me now. I'm a fatass, washed-up nobody with less fans than Kim Deal's sister! So how's about you just shut the hell up and deal with it like the rest of us. Besides, those ""lush"" songs you brag about aren't that great. Sounds like Brian Wilson serenading Herbie the Love Bug if you ask me. Jason: I don't need this. I'm an artist. The people will come around. It'll just take time. Late bloomer. That's it, I'm a late bloomer. Or a Creeping Charlie. Yeah, I'll creep up on people and before they know it I'll be all over them until they can't escape.

Fell in Love at 22 EP,Starflyer 59,by: Ryan Schreiber,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Founder</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a53e9d034d5c69bf3268/1:1/w_160/de59f915.gif,1999-02-23 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7460-fell-in-love-at-22-ep/,Tooth and NailTooth and Nail,"Goddamn, I'm tired. But what do you care? Don't you try to feign interest with me. I know what it's like with you. You're only interested in one thing-- what I have to say about an album. Well, guess what! I'm tired. Therefore, I lack inspiration. But that'll even out my feelings for this Starflyer disc. See, right now, I love this album. But will I love it a year from now? Hmm... that's a question for... somebody else! Somebody Else: Hi. I'm Somebody Else, and this is my sidekick, Another Guy. Eh, no. Maybe that's a bad idea. I guess I should just try to tackle this review with dignity. So, here's my Mom. Mom: It's Mother's Day, and that's the deal. Ryan handed this disc off to me to review it. Now, I'm not experienced in this line of work, but I decided, ""It's Mother's Day! I gotta do somethin' for this kid."" So, here to review these Starfur or whatever y'call 'em, is Tony Bennett. Tony: Hello. Can you resist my charm? I didn't think so, sweetness. After all, I'm Tony Bennett, the world's charming-est man. I've been in the music business since my father became the President of Music back in 1833, so I've been around. I know what it's like to buy some music, bring it home, listen to it and hate its damn guts. Just recently, I murdered, in cold blood, Tammy Wynette. You know why? Three words: ""Justified and Ancient."" Let's face it. When it comes to music, everybody sucks but me. And to prove it, I've got Rip Taylor on my side. Rip: Here's what I think of ""emo"" music-- it's a ruckus! I'd throw confetti if they let me have my own TV show! Tony: Rip, you'd throw confetti if I gave you a nickel. Emo is important to today's youth. It allows kids to be as melodramatic as they love to be, while simultaneously letting them do the slamdance. I don't know shit about the slamdance, but if I did, I'd be out there in the clubs instead of making records with the ""Sesame Street"" gang. Sting: Did someone say ""Feyd-Rautha?"" I have sex for six hours at a time! What do you make of that, Rip? Eh, Tony? And I know a heckuva lot about music-- got a phD in it. Tony: Sting, you talentless hack! A phD in music! Bah. You suck. Especially your solo crap. Suck! [mocking] ""It's such an ignorant thing to do/ If the Russians love their children, too..."" Sting: Hey, we got an album to discuss here, eh? Tony: They're a band... I don't know who they are, Styflaror... [hic!] Rip: On their latest offering, the Fell in Love at 22 EP, these boys push some dazzling sounds. Their music, despite being on the predominantly ""emo"" label Tooth and Nail, is quite distinctly not emo. Tony: What do you talk of, Rip? This is emo! It has emotion. E-mo-tion, Rip. They're all crybabies! Damn it [hic] to... my nostril's... in a shell. Sting: You're a 'orrible sight, Tony. Rip: Tony, emotion is not the only qualifier in emo. Emo's a genre that combines loud/ soft musical dynamics with introspective lyrics about loss, girls, puberty, school, and love. It's heartfelt, yet noisy. [throwing confetti at Tony] Tony: [retch] Sting: Well, I folla ya, Rip. You're right about Starflyer-- they're definitely not emo. What they are is dreamy and pretty with outer space atmospherics. Sometimes they're quiet, sometimes they're noisy. But when they're noisy, it's still pretty. In other words, they've assimilated the sonics of My Bloody Valentine and Radiohead, along with the shimmering pop brilliance of Phil Spector. Tony: Rip, I told you about the fuckin' confetti! Rip: Tony, if you don't mind, the Sting and I are professing our love for Starflyer 59. Sting: The title track, ""Fell in Love at 22,"" is really nice. It sounds like a perfected ""Earth Angel."" Remember that one? Rip: Do you remember ""Bill Bailey, Won't You Come Home?"" Sting: Eh... before my time, I think. Rip: Okay, forget Bill Bailey. How about the Beatles? You remember them, right? Sting: Yeah-- Ronny, Bobby, Ricky and Mike! Rip: No, that's New Edition. And you forgot Ralph. Sting: No, it's the Beatles. Remember the whole ""Ronny is dead"" thing? They had that song, ""Cool It Now."" Rip: I think we were talking about Starflyer. Tony: Numbnuts. Ryan: Burn in hell, you guys. I'll handle this. Sting: Hey, my name's on the cover of ""W"" this month! You can't talk to me like that at the peak of my popularity! Ryan: Rip and Sting were right earlier on when they were actually talking about the band. [Rip and Sting look down in shame] Ryan: Starflyer are more deeply rooted in old shoegazer rock than anything else. The reverb drench, the wall of sound, the lonely twang of the electric, the acoustics of Saturn-- all the elements of the shoegazing sound are here. But what the guys have added is a serious talent for penning melodies that are not just ear- catching, but also incredibly beautiful. Tony: Whiskey river, take my mind! Ryan: Mom, would you see Tony outside? On the title cut, the band emulates Phil Spector-ish '60s pop, but adds some much- needed warmth and sincerity. And ""E.P. Nights"" starts off simply enough-- just a basic pop melody, no major hooks, but certainly hummable-- before bursting into a supernova of melodic bliss. The guitars howl behind a force field of static- charged distortion, the cymbals crash into an unstoppable frenzied climax, and Jason Martin's vocals are elevated just above the noise: ""These are the nights..."" The band also proves on ""Traffic Jam"" that they're the masters of modern- day shoegazing instrumental epics. The track clocks in at just over 14 minutes with not a single second wasted. Finally, bringing the EP's 26 minutes to a close, is ""Samson,"" a track that can only be described as Low with a touch of country. So, y'know, I'm not here to tell you what to buy, but if it sounds good to you... [Rip throws confetti] Ryan: Punchline, anyone? I'm too tired.","Goddamn, I'm tired. But what do you care?

Keep it Like a Secret,Built to Spill,by: Jason Josephes,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a3ebea9e61561daa4da9/1:1/w_160/5f254a9f.jpeg,1999-02-23 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1014-keep-it-like-a-secret/,Warner Bros.,"I hate talking about press kits, but I'm gonna drop the rule this time around. Press kits, for the uninitiated, are like a sales pitch. You get a letter from some yahoo behind a desk who has this neat band they want you to check out. To get you to do that, they also include various write-ups and reviews for a previous work or, in the case of a new band, loads of ""Next Big Thing"" accolades. Usually, a press kit is a dozen pages or less. The Built to Spill press kit, on the other hand, may be the next great American novel. First, a three page letter from the publicist. Secondly, an 8x10 publicity shot featuring Doug Martsch flanked by bandmates and sitting on a radiator playing a guitar. (I'm sure he plays on the radiator all the time, or so the world of publicity shots would have me believe.) Then, twenty-eight pages consisting mostly of unanimous rave reviews for their last album, the fucking awesome Perfect From Now On. Finally, a four page article from the new issue of Spin regarding the new release... which is somewhere in the envelope. I had to turn the kit upside down and start shaking until a white cardboard promotional CD case came a-tumbling out. I put the disc in the player and began to leaf through the kit. Sure, I was just looking for my name somewhere in the clippings, and I suppose it would have helped to have previously written about them before. But that's fine because I can sit there and mock my fellow writers by playing the ""Sounds Like..."" drinking game or trying to find the biggest cliché of them all. The winner was a tie between Mr. Showbiz's Grant Alden, who referred to Perfect as ""...less ebullient than its predecessor, and has a wry durability about itself, yielding polished gems..."" and the usual hands- down winner, Will Hermes of the Village Voice, who actually managed to string together the words, ""As far as rock goes, the stay- at- home types seem peculiarly American these days, a gesture from a post- grunge culture weary and dubious of being the biggest, loudest, and most important, just as current Britpop might be read, in part, as postcolonialist white British weary of apologizing for its history and looking to feel good about itself again"" and call it a coherent sentence. The one thread that held every single review and article together was how different Perfect was from the band's previous release, 1993's There's Nothing Wrong With Love. Love was built on short, sharp, and snappy pop songs, but Perfect was-- as everybody went on to note-- ""epic."" Indeed, the 1996 release had few tunes under six minutes and wove dense guitars, emotional debris, and schizophrenic song structures into something gorgeous and fascinating. As avid readers of music publications will note as the reviews trickle in, Keep It Like a Secret will be heralded for retreating back to the pop songs of Love while keeping a foot inside Perfect's scrimmage line of dexterity and guitar heroism. (My friends, I think when the next album's press kit arrives, I'm going to win my own petty game with that last sentence.) It also recalls last year's fine Halo Benders release, The Rebels Not In, the album Martsch recorded with Beat Happening's Calvin Johnson and former Spinanes and current Built to Spill drummer Scott Plouf. And that's not a bad thing at all. Seriously, Keep It Like a Secret has already been spun at Club Jason five times within the past 24 hours. That's not a frequent occurrence-- not unless it really, and truly is, love. Doug Martsch just knows how to tickle me in all of the happy places, and he accomplishes that on the merits of the opening number alone. ""The Plan"" is a brisk, weaving anthem complete with a solo that would make Thurston Moore green with envy. ""Center of the Universe,"" the second cut and first single, conjures up some XTC and a little bit of Barnacle Pete's finer sea shanties. And what have we here? It's the downright pretty ""Carry the Zero,"" which merges Cocteau Twins- esque guitars and melody with equal sigh and much more articulate lyrics, none of which I'm going to quote to you. ""Sidewalk"" is classic indie rock in sound, classic rock in execution-- something I've been waiting a long time to hear. Speaking of classic rock, ""You Were Right"" is a tongue- in- check number about spitting back classic rock lyrics (""You were right when you said all we are is dust in the wind/ You were right when you said that we're all just bricks in the wall""), although why he's doing it is a mystery. But it's a fun mystery. You know, like ""Mystery"" on PBS, only without that meddling Alistair Cooke. Believe me, if there's one man who can spoil a rock and roll party, it's that evil tool of the Mobil Corporation. Luckily, he's passed on, leaving Diana Rigg to run the show, and she's no match for Martsch. Keep It Like a Secret? No, at the risk of hopping on a cliché wagon, I think I'm gonna tell all my friends about Built to Spill. Try and stop me, Diana.","I hate talking about press kits, but I'm gonna drop the rule this time\n\ around. Press kits, for ...

New World Record,Poster Children,by: Bruce Tiffee,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a107c0084474cd0bfcff/1:1/w_160/daa71eb1.gif,1999-02-23 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6435-new-world-record/,spinART,"The Poster Children have been perhaps the most reliable college band of the '90s. They haven't made a pandering sellout record. They haven't threatened breakup. They haven't moved away from the college town (Champaign, Illinois) where they started. And they haven't made a bad album, ever. The college indie rock crowd may expect big things from the Poster Children on their latest record because of their recent reassignment to the indie ranks (they left Reprise for SpinArt last year). But the truth is that even when they wore a corporate suit, their spirits were independent. They stay that way on New World Record, their first self- produced, home- recorded album. As always, there are new dimensions that keep the band from rehashing the same fast chords and blistering rhythms. The record opens with the shuffling drums and guitars of ""Accident Waiting to Happen"" before Jim Valentin's happily ascerbic vocals and the band's trademark coffee buzz sound kicks in on guitar. Feedback hangs around ""Time to Kill"" like a tie-die tapestry. Vintage new wave keyboards and monotone vocals bolster the indie harmonies of ""Ankh,"" giving the band a momentary resemblance to the late, great Brainiac. These are almost all of precious few extras thrown into New World Record. Maybe the Poster Children were intentionally trying to make their self- produced debut what people would expect from a home- recorded album, or maybe they just ran out of money. Whatever the reason, the spare, live quality makes this effort the most visceral Poster Children album since Daisy Chain Reaction. It doesn't sound literally live (as engineer Steve Albini made Daisy Chain Reaction sound), it just sounds more true to the band's live spirit than anything from the band's Reprise years. On the other hand, though there are a few competitors for anthem status-- the sheer volume of ""6x6"" and the light- through- stained- glass guitars of ""Deadman""-- few of the tracks here can match the power and persuasion of ""Junior Citizen"" and ""He's My Star"" from the Reprise years (live videos of both are included in a CD-ROM package, which also includes a video game that simulates touring). It's not for lack of trying-- the Poster Children have made easy work of cutting unique new songs using their routine, trademark structure. And though every song sounds familiar, you can rest assured that there's no ground on New World Record that the Poster Children have already covered.","The Poster Children have been perhaps the most reliable college band of the '90s.

Don't let the hippies fool you, there's nothing communal about pot. It's all about that high, and the only reason you want people around when you get high is so they can witness how good pot makes you feel. They're there so they can enjoy you, not enjoy pot with you. Masturbation is that joint you save for yourself and smoke when everyone has gone home. The beauty of Sebadoh is that they not only understand how selfish weed and wacking off are, but, to quote Malcom X, they ""talk right down to earth in a language that everybody here can easily understand."" There's no false conception that you're getting one band when you buy a Sebadoh CD-- you're getting a bunch of songs that sound like the person who wrote them. Sebadoh isn't a band as much as it's a means to an end. For the most part, the ends have been worth the means. Lou Barlow's always depressed, Jason Loewenstein's always pissed and Eric Gaffney always sounded like he took a wrong turn and ended up in Sebadoh's studio instead of GWAR's. That's part of the fun. If your girlfriend just shit on your heart, Lou was there to empathize. If you felt like letting off some steam, Jason was your man. If the crank was taking a minute to kick in, Eric could kickstart it. Then came Harmacy, by which time Eric was long gone and Lou and Jason, along with Bob Fay, decided they were a band. They weren't yet. The overproduction and cohesiveness was a wimpy kick in the nuts. No high, no climax, no thank you. The curious thing about The Sebadoh is that it is, in fact, The Sebadoh. You get the multiple personalities and the whole unit. ""Bird in the Hand"" is Jason Loewenstein at full tilt, screaming like an unwelcome orgasm and clanging out arrhythmic chords. ""Break Free,"" new drummer Russ Pollard's only song credit, sends out signals of longing without being overdrawn. ""Love is Strong"" is so distant and depressing that it could only have been written by Lou Barlow. Behind the personalities, though, all the songs are coming from the same place. Some people won't take to the cohesiveness, and the added production won't make them any happier. Change scares people, especially people accustomed to the stasis of weed. The warm organ and warped guitar on ""Tree"" may as well be aliens bursting out of the stomachs of musicians who made an entire album as bedroomy as Weed Forestin, but the rest of the track is as soothingly analog as any Nick Drake sobber. Likewise, the sci-fi noodlings and tambourine of ""It's All You"" sound polished, but retain that special Sebadoh quality. For Sebadoh, it's been a while since giving the pleasure of the two M's meant blatantly singing about them, but after a dismal attempt at coming together, Sebadoh seems to have made an album that's both communal and self- gratifying.

You had to use your imagination back then, folks. Watching a still image on the screen for a minute or two while a monotone narrator droned on about the history of Incan art meant flexing your brain constantly, if only to stay awake as you came down from that chocolate milk high. These kids today-- with their ""computers"" and their ""Internet""-- have everything spoon- fed. Sure, they can come up with the answers, but how the hell are they supposed to learn how to think? If you're old enough to remember those times, then you may remember that most school districts contracted with a company called Califone to produce those industrial- strength turntables that could fall five feet to floor and play perfectly every time. (I tested this personally back in the day.) Former members of Red Red Meat and Rex have borrowed that company's name for a new musical project, and their eponymous debut appeared this year on Flydaddy. It's an appropriate moniker for a band fronted by Tim Rutilli, as it implies toughness, solid design, and a keen awareness of how to blend classicism with the latest technology-- all these qualities are here in spades on this fine record. Rutilli's already strong songwriting improves with every record, and the music his band makes has an air of permanence about it-- you just know this stuff is going to be discovered by future generations. Stylistically similar to Red Red Meat's There's A Star Above The Manger Tonight, Califone tones down the more abrasive noise experiments and has an overall quieter feel. The junkyard space-folk blues vibe is still there, but is more refined with slightly catchier melodies. Prettiest of all is ""Silvermine Pictures,"" which mines the lo-fi classic rock sound with a subtle steel drum adding some nice textures. Throughout, the percussion is outstanding, particularly on the loping ""To Hush A Sick Transmission,"" which has a similar metallic groove to Tom Waits' old masterpiece ""In The Colosseum."" All told, Califone seems the perfect sonic evolution for rock, incorporating the noise prevalent in experimental electronic music in a completely new and organic way. Pick it up now, if only to have some answers when your hipper- than- thou kids ask you about it in twenty years.","Remember back in elementary school when multimedia education meant listening to vinyl records as some yo-yo worked the film strip ...

There's even a Jawbox movie, ""Savoring the Static,"" being made with Vince Vaughn, Janeane Garofalo, and Tom Cruise. I went to the set to discuss the new Burning Airlines CD with the stars. Pitchfork: Do you guys know about Burning Airlines? It's the post- Jawbox band with J. Robbins and Bill Barbot, who I believe Vince and Tom are playing. Vince Vaughn: Yes, I listen to it quite frequently in my trailer. I'm well past my phase of exclusively listening to bands of young Hollywood hunks, like P and Dogstar. Pitchfork: Now, does the movie cover the Burning Airlines formation? Tom Cruise: No. The studio really wanted a silly, typical, big- budget ending. At first, my character was supposed to snap, cut up his torso with a hunting knife, and blow up the Lincoln Memorial after one too many zine kids ask him, ""What was it like being on a major label?"" I thought that was a bit too much. Instead, they decided to go sappy and have some of us marry each other. Pitchfork: Let's get back to Burning Airlines. What do you guys think of it? Janeane Garofalo: Well, I'm bitter at the world and even I like it. It's so good that I forget how lonely and manless I am. Vince Vaughn: I was expecting it to be loud, full- on rock after hearing their debut 7"". Kinda like a continuation of Jawbox. I was so pleasantly surprised at how pop it sounded. Tom Cruise: So true. Those 7"" songs are on the CD, but they're some of the most straight- forward rock songs on the CD. The rest is pop, as Vince said, yet it's also joyously experimental. Pitchfork: Not experimental in a noisy, arty way though. Tom Cruise: No, not at all. I mean that you can hear all the influences of D.C. peers infused into their sound. It's an amalgamation of everything from recent Fugazi and Kerosene 454 to the Dismemberment Plan and Smart Went Crazy-- there's even some Monorchid in there. People who say that the D.C. scene has weakened are chumps. This record could be the defining record of the late '90s D.C. scene. Pitchfork: The drumming on ""Pacific 231"" and ""Flood of Foreign Capital"" bring to mind some of Smart Went Crazy's later stuff. It's really amazing. Drummer Pete Moffett's arms impressively play skittering breaks that would make Aphex Twin's Mac blush. Yet the songs are tighter than Cher's cheeks. Vince Vaughn: Yeah, I was amazed at how tight the band is! For a trio, they go together better than mirepoix. Bill Barbot's move to bass is the greatest surprise. His nimble fingers and creative lines might put Kim Coletta to shame. Pitchfork: Yeah, all the technical aspects are superb, but it's the songwriting that hooked me the most. The record is short and punchy. After one spin I knew all the songs, and looked forward to immediately going back through them. This is the most hook- laden record D.C. has produced in years. ""The Escape Engine"" stands out in my mind with those echoing ""whoo- a- whoo- hoo's"" in the background and that space- age snakecharmer solo. Janeane Garofalo: It's not as solemn as Jawbox. There's just an overall air of energy and fun throughout the record. It makes me forget for a moment that I'm approaching 40 and still single. Tom Cruise: The balance between liberal rock invention and traditional songwriting in the band is something that only decade- long veterans could forge. You forget that this a rookie release. Pitchfork: I'm shocked that big stars like you are so hip. Vince Vaughn: What's this line say? Pitchfork: What line? Vince Vaughn: Here. I can't read what you wrote... Pitchfork: Um... you're supposed to say, ""Well, when something like this comes along, where all the great elements of indie rock, from Gang of Four to XTC to Helmet are mixed together, how could any human not like it?"" Janeane Garofalo: Isn't that a bit much, Brent? I know you really like them, but please... Pitchfork: No, I'm serious. It's that good. Disclaimer: This review is a work of satire. Naturally, this conversation never occured and, to our knowledge, there is no movie about Jawbox being released. Though we do think that Vince Vaughn as J. Robbins would be inspired casting.","The ripples from Jawbox's dive into the underground rock pond still splash up against the shores of our ears ...

Really, I'm not just swiping a Tom Petty lyric for shits and giggles. My heart is huge, knocking off them block rocking beats like it was a couple of ugly English guys with a sampler. Speaking of which... techno music. Back in the day, there was Meat Beat Manifesto. Don't get me wrong-- there still is a Meat Beat Manifesto, but in the early '90s it was the only sort of techno I could wrap my hands around. Storm the Studio and 99% are sheer works of genius. I rediscovered this last week when I took a little jaunt to Los Angeles. There I sat in front of the stereo, stoned to the bone and kicking ass on ""Tekken 3."" Hard beats, so thick and bloated that a set of octuplets could come spilling out at any moment. Have you heard these albums? If not, snatch them up. They're the blueprint for all of the rigid, noisy dance music of the early '90s. Meanwhile, here in the late '90s, techno has taken a different track. Today's techno artists couldn't give a shit about anything under 120 BPM. Everything's too fast to dance to. Sorry if it dates me, but it's true. I don't want to hit a dance floor and wiggle back and forth at 900 BPM to jungle music. Arling and Cameron's latest in a string of American releases, All-In, has a handful of tracks like this but dancing doesn't seem to be the motive. Even on the track ""We Love Dancing,"" the motive is less KMFDM and more on the jokey Aphex Twin tip. Remember ""Milkman"" from Aphex's Richard D. James Album? Who didn't bust a gut during the crazy ""I would like some milk from the milkman's wife's tits"" chorus? Deaf people, of course. Everybody else got the joke. ""We Love Dancing"" is a hyperactive number built around a sample of giggling four- year- olds singing the title and yelling ""Yaaaaaaaay!"" The joke is later resurrected on the Kraftwerk parody ""We Love to Rock"" and the spacy ""We Love Dub."" I guess what I'm trying to say is that All-In is, yet isn't, a techno album. ""Speeding Down the Highway-- Fastest Girl Around"" is a nice merging of Buffalo Daughter and Stereolab without succumbing to the godawful hijinx of the Cardigans. ""But What About the Boys"" is a future gay club classic, and I say that with hope that future gay club classics won't entail Ace of Base or Human League. ""Get It On"" rubs itself all over shag carpeted bass lines before surrendering to jagged beats and Hammond organ. The sprightly fun of ""Groovy"" will have you tapping your foot and whistling in no time flat. Can you dance to it? Ask a dancer. I like music, and when you get right down to it, I like All-In.","I got a heart so big it could crush this town. Really, I'm not just swiping a Tom Petty ...

They're Autechre, folks-- Sean Booth and Rob Brown. Since 1993, these guys have been inventing, tweaking, twiddling, programming and creating the strangest sounds on this Planet Earth. A good reason to love them, but not good enough. See, to truly love a band, they've gotta actually stimulate you. They gotta activate your mind. Lucky for them, they do that, too. Otherwise, they'd be... I don't know, nameless bedroom losers emulating the Chemical Brothers or something. But Autechre don't emulate. And if they did, I'm sure they'd find someone better to copy than the Chemical Brothers. Instead, they do their own thing-- a thing of beauty. Is it hard to describe? You bet your ass, and thanks for asking. But allow me to give it a shot. Imagine what it'd sound like if Donkey Kong got his arm caught in a massive salad shooter. Or how it might sound if a drum machine attacked a Pokemon. Yeah, now you're getting somewhere. But here's the deal with electronic music: you've got emulators, inventors and the inbetween. And on a scale of one to ten-- ten being the most inventious of inventors-- Autechre rack up about a nine. When you hear them, you'll know why. Purchase, ye! I encourage thee. Go and discover! Seek! Find! As for all y'all who're already Autechre fans, mark these words: this is not your average Peel Session. Sure, it's about 30 minutes long, but that's where the comparisons between this and, say, That Petrol Emotion's Peel Sessions end. What you get is some serious-ass Autechre improv, brand new songs composed on the spot. Remarkably, they don't sound dramatically different from the songs on last year's LP5 (also referred to simply as Autechre 'cause it didn't acutally have a title). On ""Milk DX"" and ""Inhake 2,"" the beats jump and twitch like some b-movie zombie OD'ing on coke, and the shimmery, computer tones glisten in pools of warm liquid goo. But on ""Drone,"" Peel Sessions' third and final track, the band experiments with a rhythm that sounds more like an old- school lawn sprinkler than a computer hard drive, and a sci-fi doom orchestra that crescendos and gradually builds before becoming a distorted vortex opening into Dimension X. So, the low-down is, ""Milk DX"" and ""Inhake 2"" are your typical Autechre, with the band doing things their own way, yet with a good deal of predictibility. ""Drone"" is Autechre at their most amazing, creating psychedelic freakouts and other- worldly soundscapes that attack the senses as much as they massage them. Beautiful Autechre. Dreamy Autechre. So Peely before mine ears.","If you know 'em, maybe you love 'em. They're Autechre, folks-- Sean Booth and Rob Brown. Since 1993, these ...

Y'know why? Okay, okay, if you're gonna drag it out of me, I guess I'll tell you-- I'm moving from Minneapolis to Chicago in less than three weeks. And I'm taking Pitchfork with me. It's strange, really, to think about the dramatic changes that are gonna take place in my life in such a short period of time. I mean, for starters, I've sold my car. What a major shift, going from a reliable little Geo Metro to public transportation. And I can't wait. The beautiful thing about Chicago is that, unlike Minnesota, people actually talk to each other. In Minneapolis, if you talk to someone in the line at the movie theater, they get all nervous and twitchy. It's also slightly warmer there than it is in Minneapolis (though they get more snow). And best of all, everyone's completely laidback. Now, maybe I'm just glamorizing the place 'cause I'm excited about going there, but I've got proof about the laidback thing. Take, for instance, Chicago's burgeoning post-rock music scene. Bands like Tortoise, Isotope 217, Gastr del Sol, and Stereolab create nothing but the smoothest, jazziest rock you've ever fallen in love with. And Sam Prekop's first self- titled solo effort's in the same category. You might recognize Sam from his full- time band, the Sea and Cake, another of the many brilliant post-rock outfits coming out of the Windy City. But as with most musicians who front bands and make solo records on the side, you have to wonder what the difference is between the artist's solo music and the band's music. Well, in this case, the main difference is that Prekop's solo stuff is way more toned- down than most Sea and Cake stuff. Which actually sounds better. On his first solo outing, Prekop seems to have both accidentally epitomized the Chicago post-rock sound, and added new elements to it. Produced by Gastr del Sol's amazing Jim O'Rourke (who also plays on the record), the album comes off, production-wise, like a softer Camoufleur. Musically, it's warm, relaxing, and almost glowing. You can almost feel the wind coming off Lake Michigan on a warm summer day. Songs like the head- bobbing, pop groove ""The Company,"" the gentle and sublime ""A Cloud to the Back,"" the melancholy ""Don't Bother,"" and the Stereolab-ish, French funk of the record's closer, ""So Shy"" blend seamlessly into one another, held together by rich instrumentals like invisible Krazy Glue. Just as old 1940s Chicago blues 78s capture the feeling of depression- era Chi-town, Sam Prekop's solo record encapsulates the city in the late 1990s. Try listening to this on the Blue Line from Clark/Lake to Wicker Park and see if you're still skeptical.","I'm psyched. Y'know why? Okay, okay, if you're gonna drag it out of me, I guess I ...

Trad Arr Jones,John Wesley Harding,by: Neil Lieberman,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c05cabf31b7dc7156450/1:1/w_160/920e7db2.gif,1999-02-09 06:00:00,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3741-trad-arr-jones/,Zero HourZero Hour,"Needless to say, the headlines are more than a little burdensome these days. This week alone, we've been confronted by two of this world's most perplexing tragedies, those of the genocide in Yugoslavia and the high school shooting in Colorado. Naturally, these disturbing events force us all to ponder our social values and norms and, more directly, the nature of humanity itself. Genocide at least provides a modicum of an answer-- thousands of years of history, tradition, fear and fervor combined with the machinations of war allow us to at least partially, if ultimately unsatisfactorily, explain the inexplicable. However, when seemingly privileged children kill each other, there is no such history at work; merely someteen years of wasted life through which we will aimlessly fumble in the futile search for 'signs.' No doubt, the usual specters will be paraded in the media circus that is sure to transpire for the next couple of weeks. Our vain worship of fame and notoriety for any cause, the ease with which deadly weapons can be obtained in this country and the overwhelming level of violence to which we are exposed through various media will, in varying combinations, assuredly be blamed for the deaths in Littleton. Already there are reports that the members of the so- called ""Trenchcoat Mafia"" were enamoured with Marilyn Manson so it is all but a foregone conclusion that the devil's music will bear some of the blame here. But don't be mistaken-- if singers sing of teen angst and violence, those nefarious feelings are already brewing out there. Music, like all art, is merely a reflection of the society that created it and the elements within that society. The disgruntled singer must find a disgruntled audience willing to listen to his song. On ""The Devil in Me,"" a delicious play on the Stones' ""Sympathy for the Devil,"" John Wesley Harding blames misdeeds ranging from the crucifixion to air pollution on that inner demon before astutely concluding, ""it all seems like human behavior to me."" The song, a shamelessly catchy rollick, was at least partial cause for the promise of Harding's 1991 debut, Here Comes the Groom. The close of the decade that began with such high expectations for Harding finds him once again the folkie, and once again contemplating human nature. Trad Arr Jones is Harding's tribute to Nic Jones, a British folk guitarist whose arrangements of traditional songs (the album's title is short for the songwriting credit: Traditional; Arranged by Jones) provided blueprints to Dylan and Richard Thompson before an accident ended his recording career. Harding initially found himself intrigued by the tales of murder, deceit and debauchery in these hundreds of years- old songs and attracted to the fragile beauty of Jones' simplistic arrangements. Here, Harding adds only his strong voice and soft guitar to the faithful arrangements, though he respectfully notes that he had to adjust Jones' guitar parts down to his own skill level. As a result, the beautiful songs reveal themselves willingly. Killers kill senselessly and loved ones die tragically, while lovers betray each other throughout the album's eleven tracks. These songs, penned centuries ago, find the depths of human depravity as simply stated as the newspaper headlines we will read tomorrow morning, reflecting the harsh times in which they were written. Refracted through recent events, they provide no answers, only uncertainty. But just as these songs also sing of love and the struggle of the human spirit against itself, so, too, will the coming days and months bring us heartening tales of strangers saving lives under duress and students courageously helping one another in the face of danger. It is a sad truth that we live in a world perhaps even more brutal than the centuries- old one Harding sings of. It seems that after all these years, we would grow accustomed to our failings, but our communal shock is a reflection of our eternal hope for improvement. And that hope just might be our saving grace.","Needless to say, the headlines are more than a little burdensome these days. This week alone, we've been confronted ...

I got the record home and heard nothing of the kind. Yeah, it had some deep bass here and there, but I couldn't see how the sterile electronic production or the random, buzzing sonic excursions could be compared to the sticky, free- flowing ambience of dub. I mean, I still liked it, but I found myself confused by the comparison. Now, with Pole's latest offering, the EP CD 2, I understand. CD 2 brings to the forefront the catchier, more rhythm- oriented side of Pole's (somewhat limited) musical personality. Or, as the electronic eggheads of the European continent from whence Pole sprang would probably describe it, the music on CD 2 is ""Sound with a bit more organization."" There are very clear patterns, choruses even (well, kind of...), that bring a little funk to the table. A little bid-a-boom to go with that digital sshhh... Now, this is ambient electronic minimalism I'm talking about, so I mean it when I say ""a little"" funk. But that small bit makes a big difference. And when combined with the dry, yet spacious production environment that brings to mind a microprocessor's idea of what comes out of a Jamaican mixing board, these patterns make for a fun EP. And the ""pure sine waves, hold the overtones please"" kind of bottom end is the clincher. So, I'm sold-- a cold electronic version of dub. They nailed it.","When I picked up Pole's first CD (humorlessly titled CD 1) there was a little sticker on it with ...

The concept behind this music is plausible-- relatively easy techno grooves filled with '70s disco sampling and flava. But I found myself too often wondering if these trax benefitted at all from these wistful roots. Maybe I need some coke to truly delight in the seething vacancy of 1999, but I'm pretty sure that it's clearly not happening. Don't get me wrong-- as pure dance music, this album can stand side by side with the legions of house, techno and rave comps that stress booties on their covers. I mean, it could just be the pompous prick in me, but I've come to expect a more cerebral quality from Astralwerks artists. Sure, there are some decent tracks-- the synthesizer in ""La Monde"" is a squeezy delight. I'm sure ""Foxy"" is pumping out the loudspeakers of a club somewhere as you read this.

Brand equity is business- speak for the nebulous feeling that consumers get when they buy/ eat/ smell/ hear/ watch a product. It's a vague representation for the idea that people will buy a product if they think it's good, even if it ain't. Looking around, I see more than a few companies resting on their brand equity laurels. Perceived value is almost as good at the bank these days as real cash, but when it comes to music, brand equity stops here, with your Pitchfork reviewer. We don't get no money, so you can rest easy that we're not only unbiased, but also completely disinterested in the careers of the artists we review. For example, I'm not afraid to tell you now that after six months of Coca-Cola addiction, my eyes looked like pissholes in the snow, my skin was a pale shade of yellow, and I lost all feeling in my testicles. Has Pepsi sponsored me? No, I just tells it like it is, kidz. Which brings me to Coldcut's Let Us Replay!. I am pleased to announce that Coldcut has built up a brand equity among both my peers and myself that is almost unmatched among electroids.

Let Us Replay! is no exception. Germinated from the seeds of Let Us Play!, Let Us Replay! is so much more than yer standard remix disc that I hesitate to mention the connection here. However, the Coldcut- initiated will indeed recognize ""Atomic Moog 2000,"" ""Panopticon,"" ""More Beats + Pieces"" and others, if in name only, for these trax recall their predecessors like a whiff of smoke recalls a cigarette.

Call and Response,Call and Response,by: Rich Juzwiak,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a0b35e6ef9596931fff9/1:1/w_160/a4bf8ea5.jpg,2001-02-27 06:00:04,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1249-call-and-response/,KindercoreKindercore,"I can think of no record in recent memory that illustrates the dubiousness of hyper-catchiness as much as the debut LP from Call and Response. Initially, the five piece's hook-laden record, which lyrically tackles hard-hitting issues such as bubble-blowing, rollerskating, colors, and stars with eyes, didn't appeal. It was so cheerful and sunny that I feared my eyes might start bleeding. After a few more listens, though, that potential blood turned to the joyous tears that can only result from being charmed by the social awareness of five-year-olds. ""Rad,"" I said during an umpteenth listen, between jubilant sobs. ""I'm fascinated by its love."" Fast-forward to now, one week later. I haven't had the chance during the past seven days to revisit these adorable tykes. But you know, I don't really miss them. Sure, I'll hum a melody on occasion, or have a giggle over a lyric or two, but the impulse to actually listen to the record again never resurfaces. Why? Let's just say top 40 radio does it better, and without the adult-proof CandyLand gimmickry. But I suppose this sort of reaction is inevitable when the nature of Call and Response's music is taken into consideration. The band has already been likened to the Mamas and the Papas, and the Archies; both are fair enough reference points, though I don't recall any white-funk basslines burbling under ""Dedicated to the One I Love."" ""Nightflight,"" for example, plays like a suburban take on Jean Knight's ""Mr Big Stuff,"" complete with throwaway lyrics like, ""Then I knew/ It was you/ Who had a different point of view/ And I paid no mind/ To the soul I lost inside."" The song is as trite, non-specific, and meaningless as anything at the top of the Billboard singles chart. The remaining material is true to the form of ""Nightflight."" The record's opener, ""Blowin' Bubbles,"" is a lite groove that sports male/female vocals singing, ""I'm drinkin' stars up in the sky/ You know who you are/ I'm drivin' cars around your house/ It seems so far."" Meanwhile, the chorus of ""Rollerskate"" bestows wisdom like, ""Before you learn how to walk/ Before you learn how to walk/ You learn to rollerskate/ Hey."" Call and Response would have me convinced that they're just trying to be cute and ironic with lines like this if it weren't for the impossibly straightforward vocal and musical delivery. Songs that could be prime examples of well-realized nonsense, a la Ween or ""Sifl and Olly,"" simply are not. This makes for an album that's lean, unobtrusive, and largely slight. The songs may be infectious, but this isn't as much a product of fine songwriting as an exercise in smart calculation. I'd be an elitist liar if I said that catchy, nothing pop songs don't have the tendency to make me swoon. Still, however strong an immediate visceral reaction may be, awareness of pending expiration is essential. Call and Response are a brief flash of enjoyable fluff. And that may be the band's very aim; to create utterly disposable, formulaic echoes of yesteryear's pop hits. Even so, we've already been taught this lesson countless times, and it's even more resounding when delivered with sincerity. Really! When Andy Gibb proclaimed, ""I just want to be your everything,"" millions of girls around the world were instantly wooed, praying that his piercing wails were unleashed for them alone. So, Call and Response can wax reminiscent all they want, but their unknown status-- in the indie world and otherwise-- suggests that nostalgia will never be on their side.","I can think of no record in recent memory that illustrates the dubiousness of hyper-catchiness as much as the debut ...

Though they're said to parse each review for illogicalities, flagrant lapses in concentration, and general sloppiness, they rarely concern themselves with write-ups of indie rock mainstays. In matters ambient and chill, though, they override even the editor-in-chief's judgment. Why should this be? The copy editors' tasks are so crucifyingly dull that the only way to retain a knowledgeable and well-balanced team is to give each editor top-of-the-line headphones so that they may enjoy the soothing tones of chill-out discs while lazily perusing their articles. As a result of years of marking up copy while submerged in deep, deep chill, the copy editors have gained an acute knowledge of their preferred genre. The department recently voted Coco Steel and Lovebomb's Balearic ambient record Sun Set ""the most chamomile disc of the 90's."" The department has been defection-free since Nathan Scrote, a fine interpreter of Brent DiCrescenzo's prose, left without a word after working himself into a caffeinated tizzy over Moby's ""disrespectful"" mixes of Brian Eno's ""Fractal Zoom."" But since that wet Wednesday afternoon, the team has remained cohesive and love-bound. It's almost as if they'd all drunk of Milton the Monster's tincture of tenderness. Well, not quite. Rumors of disruption started up again on the Tuesday that the Orb's Cydonia was to be released. The editor-in-chief found fragments of vicious pink hi-lighter marker on the boardroom carpet. Elsewhere, red pencil shavings were scattered into Mrs Neshanigan's handbag-- what had the Pitchfork eurythmacist done to deserve such treatment? An extensive report from the internal affairs department reported that the copy editors had taken premature and violent exception to Cydonia. Nonplussed at Aki Omori's vocals and doot-doot-doo's on ""Once Again,"" the band's sixth album did not sit well with them. Their resented prevented further listening. In their resistance to anything other than another re-rerun of U.F.Orb, they never stopped to admire the breakbeat melodica dub of ""Promis"" or the rolling echoes and classically Orb-ular processing effects on the lilting ""Ghostdancing."" Recalling Orbus Terrarum's ""Slug Dub,"" ""Turn It Down"" concludes with an excerpt of a knighted Welshman telling tall tales of the local brewery's dark and powerful ale that sustained his generation through Nazi bombardment and forced rationing. Drifting in, possibly from some moments left off the Robert Fripp/Orb collaboration FFWD, ""Egnable"" is a Monty Python-esque monologue based on IKEA self-assembly instructions and upholstering manuals. After such headspace adventures, the Orb return to clubbier material with the Front 242 DMT trip of ""A Mile Long Lump of Lard,"" and ""1.1.1,"" which could have easily come off Krust's Coded Language. Cydonia closes with the circa 1989 ""Terminus,"" a lengthy, spaced-out ambient trundle around the universe-- exactly the type of adventuring that distinguished them over a decade ago. Though Cydonia is far from being a dull, sequencer-heavy Namlook ambient release, it regrettably sounds irrelevant in today's climate. No one will deny the importance of the band's first two albums, but by the time they released the frighteningly claustrophobic Orbus Terrarum, the glitch of Oval and the algorithm of Autechre had turned the electronic scene microscopically inward. Out on the dancefloor, Dr Alex Patterson and his cohorts' ""Land of Oz"" chillout has little meaning to the kids who've made hard house and trance the world's most in-demand genres. The Orb now find themselves creating breakbeat tracks that can't fairly compare with the dangerous dark of Dave Tipper or Rennie Pilgrem. Cydonia will confuse those who haven't followed the band's advice (""An Orb is for life, not just for Christmas"") and grown up with them. They'll rightly demand to know why these guys are considered pioneers. While it's so tempting to me, a longtime admirer of Dr LX journeying, to find all manner of excuses and apologies for the stalled and self-reminiscing Cydonia, I have to concede that it may be time for the Orb to make a Mir-like re-entry into Earth's atmosphere and collide with a Taco Bell sign in the middle of the Pacific ocean. Alternatively, the Orb could cop a few moves from the similarly named Orbital, who've managed to remain strikingly meaningful over a similar length of time. Orb fans should reflect on why indie-apostates such as Radiohead have turned to Richard D James for guidance rather than Dr Patterson, whose love of Pink Floyd and Tangerine Dream once seemed to chime perfectly with Radiohead's own. The Kosmos would show sublime and gracious irony if some 'Crasher kid, twenty years hence, discovered Alex Patterson and decided to give him one more bite of celebrity pie, just as Patterson did for Gong's has-been guitarist, Steve Hillage. Encouraging such System 7 fantasies is, in fact, the primary recommendation of the Pitchfork Internal Affairs Division report on the unrest within the copy-editing department. After a few spins of The Water Album and 777, staffers' write-ups will once again be freed from the stranglehold of pendant participles.","It's little known how particular the Pitchfork copy editors are.

Folktronic,Momus,by: Matt LeMay,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c393ea9e61561daa7f5e/1:1/w_160/0b6dcd3b.gif,2001-02-27 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5387-folktronic/,Le Grand MagisteryLe Grand Magistery,"These days, it seems the inhuman aspect of technology is approaching status as a central theme within rock music. It's pretty logical, too-- music and technology have always been closely intertwined, from the development of the pianoforte in the early 18th century to the work of 20th century pioneers like Karlheinz Stockhausen and Robert Moog. Though technology has certainly allowed musicians to expand their sonic palettes, it seems many are eager to turn on it in varying capacities, ranging from the all-out attack of shitty industrial music to more subtle protests, such as the insistence on using crusty old recording equipment. But Momus (aka Nick Currie) has never been a follower. Over the course of his career, he's gone from guitar-based folk music to unadulterated synth-pop to ""analog baroque."" And through all this, he's still found time to have a plaster cast of his penis made for display at a New York gallery, and write top-selling songs for Japan's favorite kinky little girl, Kahimi Karie. With his latest album, Momus seems to have brewed together all the elements of his musical history-- including his oft-discussed member-- into the crazy, glitchy electro-folk record that he has christened Folktronic. And while, at times, Momus constructs a bitingly clever post-modern take on folk music, Folktronic has an unfortunate tendency to choke on its own concept, rendering the album a bit hard to swallow. ""Finnegan the Folk Hero"" is the greatest success on the album-- a witty, entertaining update of a classic theme. The song presents the tale of Finnegan, an HTML wiz who's forced into obscurity by lack of pay, set against a backdrop of cheap Casio keyboards and drum machines. Musically, as well as lyrically, the song has roots in folk music; it's part western, part sea shanty. Momus' cheesy instrumentation somehow compliments the music perfectly, and the result is just the kind of clever enhanced-folk Momus was aiming for. ""Appalachia"" is another, more eclectic example of Folktronic at its best, taking the timeless subject of the ""Appalachian mountain girl,"" and placing her in a world of hyperactive drum machines, digital fuzz, and distorted baroque synthesizers. The lyrics are not quite as clever as those of ""Finnegan,"" but are none the less palatable, and fit the Folktronic theme nicely. Further kudos go to Momus for the closing the album with three songs written for Kahimi Karie's Journey to the Centre of Me EP: ""Lady of Shallot,"" ""Mistaken Memories of Medieval Manhattan,"" and the awesomely fucked-up Brechtian ""Pygmalism."" Not only are these perhaps the strongest songs Momus has ever penned, but they also seem to fit into the record's conceptual mold quite well. Sadly, many of Momus' other stabs at the ""Folktronic"" genre fall flat. ""Mountain Music,"" a song based on a comment made by Johnny Cash about Beck having ""that mountain music in him,"" wants to be a clever commentary on the way technology has changed access to different genres of music. Here, though, Momus gets a bit caught up in the idea, incessantly dropping names of persons (Massive Attack, Beck, and the late electronic innovator Bruce Haack, among others), and devices (the Rio MP3 player) alike. Though for the majority of the track, Momus pummels you over the head with his concept, he makes sure to include a few genuinely witty, amusing lyrics, such as ""'Moon of Alabama' is my favorite country tune/ With lyrics by a communist and music by a Jew."" The rest of Folktronic is similarly mixed. Songs like ""Tape Recorder Man"" and ""The Penis Song"" pair clever, funny lyrics with crap music. And much of the rest of the album totters the line between simply mediocrity and forgettability with a few particularly obnoxious flaws like the '80s-inspired ""Robocowboys"" and the awkward, bluesy ""Smooth Folk Singer."" Still, when taken as a whole, Folktronic's plusses certainly outweigh its minuses. This is Momus being Momus; he still sounds like Donovan, and he's still as quirky, arrogant, and witty as ever. Though the record is far from the genre-defining landmark Momus likely intended to be, it certainly ranks among his better works. My advice to diehard Momus fans: log off littlejapanesegirls.com, zip up your pants, and get your ass to the record store. The rest of you can take a hint from the man himself: put technology to use for you and pull a few tracks off Napster to see if it's your thing.","These days, it seems the inhuman aspect of technology is approaching status as a central theme within rock music.

Nightsongs,Stars,by: Sam Eccleston,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a547b1335d7bf1698b6a/1:1/w_160/e469bb10.jpg,2001-02-27 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7470-nightsongs/,Le Grand Magistery,"Stars are young and good looking and want to go out dancing. They're vibrant and dissolute and put French people saying, ""Light, calm and voluptuous,"" at the beginnings of their records. They draw on dance music of the most Europop variety imaginable. Their lives are full of endless, evanescent pleasures; each night a new revolution of the senses. They laugh at people like us, dressed like old men and hard to drag out of the house. That's what they'd have you believe, anyway. Nightsongs is, however, a devastatingly intelligent, moving record that wants desperately for you to think it's vapid. Stars make lush, keyboard-based pop songs that evoke a chronic-depressive Pet Shop Boys, or Stephin Merritt if he'd never heard of Bertold Brecht. These songs are short on the sort of cheese that typically plagues records of this genre-- horn parts, whispered vocals, wordless female backing vocals-- that they're sort of impossibly hip, chilly and suave. Very much the type of thing that one would imagine they play in bars that serve martinis in oversized glasses. So why would those of us who may be young, but are otherwise ugly and hate dancing-- people who prefer old man bars where no one ever employs a DJ, and you never have to dance (unless you find the jingling of Keno machines incredibly rhythmic)-- care about Stars? These are the people we hate, right? People who've found a way to morally justify paying more than a $100 for pants? They're letting those people make records now? They are. And goddamn it, those records are good. Nightsongs is an outstanding debut record, both in the trebly groove of its beats and the anomic fear and loathing of its lyrics. Stars take the dark edge of great dance records past-- the best of Chic, say, or Funkadelic, for God's sake-- and rub your face in it. This is a group, after all, known well for their dance cover of the Smiths' ""This Charming Man,"" another band unusually interested in discussing the travails of the young and hip. Still, even when dressed in Swedish sneakers and breakbeats, pain is still pain. And Nightsongs has its share. ""Stars on the Ceiling"" equates falling in love with staring-- naturally-- at the ceiling, while a blanket of horns mourn beneath the vocal. ""My Radio,"" a fine entry in the music-as-salve-for-young-woes genre, lays thudding drum machines under languid backing vocals and yet another of the album's astonishingly good horn parts, undercutting the wistful quality of the melody with a kind of unmentionable malice. Not that they don't get around to mentioning the malice, eventually. ""The Very Thing"" might sound a little like Everything but the Girl-- all acoustic guitars and chimy piano-- but it's a shockingly close-to-the-bone tale of domestic collapse, narrated by a husband and father who can't be categorized as heavy or hero: his kid ""put a light in front of [h]im,"" but his wife is, apparently, a whore. Like everything here, ""Very"" is toned in shades of grey. The fear-of-success anthem ""Write What You Know,"" and the admiration-unto-envy-unto-murderous-rage story of ""International Rock Star,"" are equal parts sugar (Chris Seligman's music and arrangements) and spite (Torquil Campbell's English-tinged vocals and lyrics). By comparison with the rest of this gallery, even the narrator of should-be club hit ""Liar,"" perhaps a serial killer, doesn't come off looking all that terrible. All this vaguely satiric venom doesn't tell the whole story, though. Stars aren't Momus with a bigger recording budget any more than they're the American Depeche Mode. There are songs here brimming with string sections and lyrics that prove that even people who are let in discos for free sometimes miss departed friends. In short, rather than delivering on the slick promise of their sound with expected vapidity, Nightsongs is a deeply felt album, hidden in what ought to be empty clothes. As with any good piece of candy, there are razor blades hidden within. Stars may be young and good-looking, and they probably don't turn their nose up at expensive pants. They get laid so often they can hardly walk. And they want so badly to go dancing. They'd probably take you with them if they could just get off their knees, brush those goddamn expensive pants off, and stop crying their eyes out.","Stars are young and good looking and want to go out dancing.

The Red Thread,Arab Strap,by: Camilo Arturo Leslie,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a0ecb1335d7bf169811f/1:1/w_160/760f1bc8.gif,2001-02-27 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/270-the-red-thread/,Matador,"Perhaps rather than The Red Thread, the brothers MacSomber should have called their new album The Red Threadbare. The perma-posture of self-loathing has-- to no one's surprise, really-- almost totally burned itself out; consequently the group's dependably rich musical arrangements have to work harder than ever now to justify the repetitious circus of misery and sexual obsession that's characterized the band to the present. That's the bad news. The not so bad news is that-- galling lack of novelty and progress notwithstanding-- the boys from Falkirk have made another better-than-average album. The celebrated songwriting duo of Aidan Moffat and Malcolm Middleton have four studio albums under their collective belt. And they'd have you believe you this is their best effort yet. Not so. It's simply on par. Moffat continues to spin his grim little narratives about relationship hell and dead sex, and his lyrics are as piquant, morbidly funny, and, of course, sad as ever. In ""Last Orders,"" he sings, ""We could pretend that this never started/ That you're still shy, I'm still broken-hearted/ And we'll get pissed just to watch the telly/ I'll get worked up when you flesh your belly."" Aidan always clothes the pain of love gone wrong in the most mundane details; his strength has always been a knack for capturing those details and presenting them in a sympathetic light. The Red Thread offers little in the way of memorable melodies. Moffat's voice never has and will never be a ""song"" voice. But as a vessel for his ever-lugubrious poems, and as a foil to the florid but coldly impersonal music, you couldn't ask for more. In the tension between Moffat's acrid, pained bursts of psychological commentary and the alternately pretty and negligible music is where Arab Strap gets its most mileage. Two sentences back, I almost wrote ""background music."" Therein lies the biggest problem with this band. Not to disparage their music, as much of it borders on gorgeous, but if the lyrics sucked, no one would give a shit. Let's be honest here: the main allure of the group is their psychological dimension and their bleak, haggis-sex-noir storytelling. You can slag a band like Low for making the same album over and over, but at the end of the day, it's hard to wear out ""pretty."" You can pick up any Low album and enjoy it (if you're disposed to that kind of thing), provided you don't listen to several of their albums in a short timespan. Arab Strap, however, leaning heavily on their emotional S&M; routine, are bound to run out of tricks sooner than later. This album does indeed have flashes of beautiful music. ""Screaming in the Trees"" is the album's sparsest track, eschewing percussion and superfluous instrumentation, while drawing on the natural atmospherics of the space around Moffat's voice and a lone guitar track. As if to underscore the theme of space, there's an inordinately long silence between the song's end and the beginning of the next track. ""The Long Sea"" is The Red Thread's most magisterial and engaging piece of music, building up over five minutes before incorporating fuzzy major chords over a minor background. Adele Bethel's voice and horns can be faintly heard through the delay-addled din. Both of these songs, as well as ""Infrared"" and the cinematic ""Haunt Me,"" feature music that rises to the level of the lyrical performance-- but that, more importantly, is of high enough quality to justify the endless additions to Moffat's book of misanthropy and self pity. Generally speaking, though, the music offers few surprises this go around, relying instead of the tried-and-true guitar arpeggios, atmospheric noises and orchestral, rainy-day crescendos. The album's first UK single, ""Love Detective,"" about a guy waiting for his lover to leave for work so he can open up her red metal cashbox full of secrets, is typical of the band's strengths and weaknesses. The emotional Pandora's box trope, the semi-humorous reflection on paranoia and jealousy, and the vignette structure of the lyrics are at odds with a lackluster musical foundation that sounds like hybrid of the theme music from Rocky and ""Peanuts"" as interpreted by Fiona Apple-- a combination that spells ""fucking awful"" no matter how drunk you are. I suppose there are equally valid arguments for and against a band like Arab Strap. Some people will want to own their entire discography, not because there's astonishing variation between the releases or measurable growth as time wears on, but rather, for much the same reason people own several Raymond Carver novels. Carver's stories are basically all the fuckin' same, and so are Moffat's. Yet, where else can you turn to hear your basest emotions, your most abject emotional episodes, or your most petty reflexes celebrated and dignified in this way? Moffat's gift for both eulogy and bile, and for making the unpalatable much less so is striking, repetition be damned. And maybe some of his appeal springs from the lyrical redundancy. Moffat, or at least the persona he assumes for Arab Strap, is damned to pushing the slippery boulder of emotional self-sabotage up the hill for all eternity like a Scottish Sisyphus, but also, so that we don't have to do it ourselves. It's only music, though, so either way, you're still fucked.","Perhaps rather than The Red Thread, the brothers MacSomber should have called their new album The Red Threadbare. The perma-posture ...

The Night is Advancing,Appendix Out,by: Matt LeMay,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a0d35e6ef95969320044/1:1/w_160/bb10ebe0.gif,2001-02-20 06:00:10,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/245-the-night-is-advancing/,Drag CityDrag City,"Despite originating from completely different set of social, economic, and class conditions, there are a few intriguing similarities between America's folk music tradition and Britain's folk music tradition. American folk music traditionally addresses death, violence, poverty, and sex. British folk music traditionally addresses death, violence, royalty and sex (with cool accents). Appendix Out frontman Alasdair ""Ali"" Roberts is frequently referred to as the ""British Will Oldham."" Taking into account the parallels between the musical traditions upon which Oldham is building and the musical traditions upon which Roberts is building, this statement seems markedly accurate. Lyrically, American folk music is a decidedly rougher affair than a good deal of English folk music. Will Oldham sings about cocks; Alasdair Roberts sings about ""nightshade."" And yet, musically and lyrically, one gets a sense that both Oldham and Roberts are lovers of their respective countries' musical histories. Further comparisons between the two singers can be drawn simply because the two have very similar voices. Alasdair Roberts never attempts the kind of loud, high-pitched yelps that Oldham has been known to let loose. Indeed, Appendix Out seems to rely much more heavily on subdued, meditative beauty than on pure, raw emotion. Thankfully, the comparison is completely valid where it matters most-- The Night is Advancing is an excellent, stirring, and deeply affecting album. ""A Path to Our Beds"" sets the tone for the record, with acoustic guitars swirling in stereo, a lilting bassline, and a constant, hypnotic drumbeat. Ali Roberts' voice is warm and appealing, but quavers with a hint of awkwardness. It stays at a near-mumble throughout The Night is Advancing, adding to the overall spare and lovely tone of the record. Many songs on The Night is Advancing are obviously deeply rooted in the British folk tradition. ""The Groves of Lebanon,"" one of the most stunningly gorgeous tracks on the album, contains highly folk-inflected lines like, ""Your hair is like a royal tapestry/ Fragrant as the groves of Lebanon."" Again, the backing is provided largely by acoustic guitar and muffled drums and bass. But while the album is highly steeped in the folk music tradition, it doesn't limit itself to the conventional instruments of folk. Throughout the album, faint flourishes of electronics and keyboards can be heard. These elements remain slightly buried within the songs themselves, allowing them to enhance without ever intruding. Perhaps the most impressive track on The Night is Advancing is one of its most uncharacteristic, the 7+ minute ""Fortified Jackdaw Grove,"" a haunting epic built upon oft-dissonant, jazzy piano, and an extended bass drone. Horns squeal almost agonizingly, mimicking the uncertainty of Roberts' voice. As the track nears its fifth minute, a strange drumbeat enters the mix, contrasting the still-present piano, and completely altering the feel of the track. It's a moment of musical near-perfection, and certainly suggests that Appendix Out are often at their best when they incorporate some pretty out-there song structures into their largely traditional music. So perhaps the Oldham comparison isn't entirely accurate-- The Night is Advancing is a much more meditative, deliberate affair than something Oldham would release. Thus, The Night is Advancing is an album that won't necessarily knock your socks off, but will certainly leave you feeling cozy and warm in them.","Despite originating from completely different set of social, economic, and class conditions, there are a few intriguing similarities between America ...

Standards,Tortoise,by: Matt LeMay,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a7e413d197565213951b/1:1/w_160/68309225.jpg,2001-02-20 06:00:09,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8114-standards/,Thrill Jockey,"There's something inherently non-anthemic about the type of music that's come to be known as ""post-rock."" In order for music to be considered anthemic, it has to work in big, sweeping gestures. Big, pounding rhythms, soaring melodies, powerful arrangements-- these are the things of American anthems. Up until now, most post-rock has featured none of these elements. The melodies-- when there are coherent melodies-- are usually sparse and minimalist, and far from hummable. Rhythms are complex and jerky, and difficult to tap out with only two feet. Vocals, which are rare, are generally languid; try to imagine Brian McMahan singing ""The Star Spangled Banner"" without lulling 10,000 grunting sports fans into a deep sleep. It seems remarkably appropriate that Tortoise, perhaps the most vital architects of the post-rock genre, would be responsible for its greatest advancement since its inception. Standards, the group's fourth full-length, takes their already adventurous sound into brave new terrain, exploring previously unknown dimensions of sonic depth and expressiveness. Not only is it the most acoustically enthralling album they've released, it's also without a doubt the most playful, dynamic, and anthemic post-rock album that has been released to date. I credit much of the increased fun factor on Standards to the more dominant role of guitarist Jeff Parker, whose work with Isotope 217 has proven that he's not only startlingly proficient, but also funny-- and funky. Though Parker's presence was a welcome addition to the band on TNT, he seems to have really come into his own as a band member on Standards, and his versatile guitar stylings not only breathe new life into Tortoise's sound, they also provide the kind of melodic centerpiece that previous recordings have at times lacked. But to give Parker the preponderance of the credit for the more playful, exploratory nature of Standards would be unfair; Standards is the sound of a whole band fully embracing their influences. Over the course of the album, one can hear echoes of such diverse sources as Miles Davis, Tom Zé, Jimi Hendrix, Philip Glass, Suicide, Brian Eno, Parliament, and spaghetti westerns and sci-fi flicks alike. But what makes this album truly impressive is the depth with which the five members of Tortoise approach the amalgamation of these complex sources. Rather than simply cutting and pasting superficial elements from a variety of genres, Standards sees the band truly reveling in the sounds of their influences. As the fucked up American flag on the record's cover suggests, Tortoise has taken this record as an opportunity to revisit an entire history of American music-- from jazz through dance and electronica-- and reshape it into an permutation of their own. Appropriately, Standards kicks off with a bang: the unrestrained, gorgeous blast of noise that opens its first track, ""Seneca."" As John McEntire wails on his drumkit even more aggressively than he did in his wild Bastro days, Jeff Parker's guitar intones a simple, highly melodic riff. The phrasing, and the explosive energy of McEntire's playing, leaves these few simple notes sounding utterly huge. After this pattern repeats, ""Seneca"" metamorphoses into a more complex, but equally dynamic track, that combines all the tenets of the traditional post-rock sound with some tasty new extras. As the beautiful chaos of the song's intro fades away, McEntire chimes in with what is perhaps the single most compelling beat he has produced over the course of his career, every bit as primal as it is astoundingly complex. With such diverse sonic elements as handclaps, backwards distorted guitars and, yes, vibraphones, ""Seneca,"" like many other tracks on Standards, succeeds in expanding the traditional post-rock sound. ""Eros"" follows, building upon a foundation of Latin-tinged percussion and a thick bass groove with intermittent sonar blips, spastic, squelching analog synth, and wah-wah guitar. As with the best of Tortoise, these tracks can be enjoyed on many levels, but when listened to carefully, they reveal seemingly infinite sonic treasures. The latter half of Standards sees Tortoise breaking even farther away from the trappings of traditional post-rock. ""Blackjack,"" one of the album's many high points, combines a guitar melody that could have been lifted directly off of a '60s Morricone score with high-pitched dance synthesizers and a straightforward, commanding beat. Whereas most of the tracks on TNT were written in the studio, and often fell victim to a high aimless noodling factor, the band composed most of Standards ahead of time, and as a result, ""Blackjack,"" along with the other nine songs on the album, are beautifully structured, and develop flawlessly from beginning to end. Tortoise has always been a band that thrives on subtlety. With Standards, they've finally managed to arrange those subtleties to form broad, bold sonic outlines. As a result, this record is by far the most intense, compelling, and memorable Tortoise has released to date. With its potent combination of the powerhouse wallop of rock and roll and the aural intricacy of jazz, minimalism, and electronica, Standards serves as the first Tortoise album that's every bit as exciting as it is intriguing.","There's something inherently non-anthemic about the type of music that's come\n\ to be known as ""post-rock.""

The Wilsons, the Jacksons, the Osmonds-- all have reached high enough levels of scandal and interest to warrant poorly-acted TV miniseries. Now, I'm not privy to the inner workings of the Oldham musical clan, but I doubt we can expect to see part one of The Oldhams on ABC any time soon. Sure, brother Will sings songs about drugs, screwed up relationships, and sodomizing everything under the sun. But those are just songs. To meet the publicity requirements necessary for a six-hour block on primetime, you need a genuinely screwed up family dynamic. And, in terms of outward appearances, the Oldhams seem a surprisingly functional unit. Brothers Will, Paul, and Ned tour together, record together, and produce each other's records. It's all very Disney, aside from the songs about cocks. Whether or not the Oldham family are ""Seventh Heaven"" material, they sure have managed to turn out a bunch of kickass records over the past decade, due in no small part to the laidback, familial tone that's practically become a trademark. This, the first full-length from Ned Oldham's Anomoanon project that doesn't center around the interpretation of children's classics, is another fine record in the Oldham tradition of slightly country-inflected folk-rock. All those Oldham signatures-- shaky vocal harmonies, sloppy lead guitar, persistent mid-tempos-- are here in abundance. ""Going to the Sea"" opens The Anomoanon on a pleasant, sing along-y note. Ned Oldham's voice, which will be familiar to those of you with any old Palace Brothers records, has all the quiver of Neil Young with none of the nasal whine, making it both expressive and listenable. This track, like the rest of the album's better tracks, achieves an instantly likable laid-back groove, like a porchfront family jam session with flawless, crisp production. Sadly, the sheer goodness of ""Going to the Sea"" is not to be frequently matched. The next track, ""Flock,"" sees the band indulging too greatly in their loose approach to writing and recording. Aram Stith does his best to keep the song afloat with twangy lead guitar, but when the Oldhams lose track of the song itself and slip into an aimless jam session, it's more akin to a Phish concert than authentic backwoods Appalachian folk. Since The Anomoanon is a fairly coherent album, the primary elements separating each track come down to subtle songwriting elements. ""Window (I Can't See Past The),"" the record's best track, pairs a sufficiently diverse song structure with a hauntingly beautiful melody, ranking among the better tracks in the Palace catalog. Sadly, the rest of The Anomoanon has trouble finding such focus. When all is said and done, The Anomoanon is a damned solid folk-rock record. But unlike past offerings from the Brothers Palace, it ends the minute the music stops. There's no ethereal murmur, no haunting whisper to stay with you and extend the album's reach beyond five inches of plastic. Still, it's clear that The Anomoanon isn't meant to be the kind of intense listening experience we've come to expect from these guys. Instead, it's the sound of friends and brothers loosening up, knocking a couple back, and enjoying what they do best. Not exactly miniseries material, but certainly the makings of a good record.","Man, these musical families can be pretty fucked up.

The myriad foxy chanteuse/keyboardist/producer collectives perform in a sphere that's so reliant on trends, they're practically tattooed with expiration dates (as per their contracts). And when they fade, these radio-friendly ""club"" artists take their tunes with them. Try, for example, to hum a Black Box song. Shit, try to remember the name of a Black Box song. It's hard, you know? Saint Etienne have deftly escaped the clutches of obscurity. Mainmen Bob Stanley and Pete Wiggs have nipped and tucked their once dancefloor-tailored sound over the years. The band's first distinct departure came with 1998's Good Humor, a relatively organic, charming pop record. And though further departures were expected, The Sound of Water was a mini-ambush. Their lavishly orchestrated stomps were distilled into fairly minimal compositions founded on the joy derived from the pitter-patter of little beats. With their 60's lounge-pop heroes beaming through their songwriting as clearly as ever, The Sound of Water looked like expensive plastic surgery. Now, as a belated follow-up, Saint Etienne offer Interlude, a compilation of b-sides, rarities and outtakes recorded during the Water sessions. And, if Water was a Beverly Hills facelift, Interlude, is the band deservedly basking in the success of aesthetic revision. Its best moments come with the one-off experiments that propel the band further from traditional dance music. There was no place on The Sound of Water for the comparatively dense ""Red Setter,"" a shame since it would have stood out as one of the album's finest moments. There's an impossible lack of tension between the song's rhythm (a laconic guitar riff, buried beats, and tentative bass), whirling electronic effects, and an astinato three-note piano cluster. The ambience is further augmented by vocalist Sarah Cracknell, who can be found alternately purring and humming a gorgeously sleepy melody somewhere in the middle of the song's thick layers. The minimal 5 A.M. house of ""Northwestern,"" the deliberate, piano-based torch ballad, ""Thank You,"" and the virtually solo acoustic ""Mountain Rain"" are all perfect examples of Saint Etienne's success in restraint. But songs this sparse give Cracknell's thin and occasionally flat voice more responsibility than it carried on pre-Water releases. Though she doesn't compensate with overwhelming personality like, say, Deborah Harry, her airy vapidity is a fine fit for the music's dreamy tone. Because Interlude is assembled from previously tossed-out material, a few scabs slip in. The French-sung ""Le Ballade de Saint Etienne"" features a churning beat so reminiscent of Enigma, it could as easily have been titled ""Dullness, Pt. 1."" The remixes tacked on to the end of the disc are far too beat-happy and uncreative to feel at home anywhere without a liquor license; Sound of Water's ""Boy is Crying"" is revamped as an inane, pumped-up, beat-heavy romp, and Trouser Enthusiast's eight-minute tech-house remix of Good Humor's ""Lose That Girl"" comes off as little more than pulsating regression. With each release, Saint Etienne seem more eager to prove that they're more than just a dance act that digs the 60's. They've almost completed work on their sixth proper album that Wiggs reveals will be ""seven times better"" in Interlude's liner notes. Yeah, this kind of cockiness is irritating, but it shows that Saint Etienne's members realize they have a lot to live up to. Really, the next record could be only 1\xBD times as good as Interlude, and would still be momentous.","I don't have an exact formula, but I figure that a decade in human years\n\ amounts to at ...

EP [2001],Red Stars Theory,by: Spencer Owen,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a238b1335d7bf1698441/1:1/w_160/13310bac.gif,2001-02-20 06:00:06,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6726-ep-2001/,Suicide Squeeze,"Red Stars Theory now have four official CD releases under their belt, which proves that they really want to be something other than ""the side project with that awesome drummer from Modest Mouse."" Okay, so frontman James Bertram may be the ex-bassist for 764-HERO. And yes, 1999's Life in a Bubble Can Be Beautiful may have defined the Red Stars Theory as the premier purveyors of indie dream-rock, complete with lingering effects, languid guitars, laid-back grooves and a full-time violinist. But damned if it won't be a long time before respected indie kit-rocker Jeremiah Green isn't mentioned within seconds of the band's name. Now that all that's out of the way, let's talk about their second, and latest, self-titled EP. It's comprised of two out-of-print releases-- a Deluxe Records 10"" and a 7"" from RxRemedy-- both recorded by Calvin Johnson way back in the group's infancy in 1995. It represents the earlier sound that followed through the band's 1997 debut, But Sleep Came Slowly, if more guitar-based and less dynamic than the stratospheric tones introduced on their sophomore effort. While not new by any means, newborn Theory-heads everywhere can solace in the fact that these long-unavailable tracks are finally seeing the light of day again. Unfortunately, this release seems as if it could be suitable only for those completists. The EP opens with the original recording of ""Broken Neck,"" the final version of which can be found on But Sleep Came Slowly. Granted, it's a pretty good song, as the version on the LP proves with a much fuller sound and tighter instrumentation. But like the rest of the tracks here, it sounds thin and flat; although not lo-fi enough to warrant pigeonholing, it nonetheless comes across as muddled and lifeless, utilizing only the dead center of the EQ spectrum. The following three tracks from the 10"" drudge along at a similar slow, middling pace. Bertram's vocals whine just a little more than usual, sometimes crossing the thin line between endearingly nasal and intolerable. It's hard to recommend something when the only moment that truly gets your attention is a brutally incompetent and mercifully brief guitar ""solo"" in the middle of the instrumental ""Think Piece."" Not even Green's drumming is particularly noteworthy. The record closes with the two tracks from the 7"", distinguishable in sound from the previous four only by slightly increased tempo and slightly harsher guitars. ""Castle Rock"" contains the best moment thus far, a brief passage with a snare cadence, whispered vocals, and slick lead guitar, which appears to save it from being a clone of the preceding song. But then it segues into its final minute-long segment, which begins dissonantly and gradually becomes increasingly more so, ending the EP on a painful note. Currently, Red Stars Theory's best release is Life in a Bubble. Bertram stays off the microphone more than usual, letting the subdued, harmonizing guitars, lilting violins, and Green's masterful beats speak for themselves. This EP is not a good introduction to their work for the uninitiated, and hardly essential for fans of their later output. Hardcore completists, if they indeed exist, will buy it no matter what. For the rest... hell, just listen to your Modest Mouse records.",,4.6,
Newness Ends,Matt & Bubba Kadane,by: Sam Eccleston,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c3efeb335119a49ed822/1:1/w_160/1f2a91d4.gif,2001-02-20 06:00:05,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5782-newness-ends/,Touch and GoTouch and Go,"The Kadane brothers used to be in a band called Bedhead, who a lot of people liked because they sounded not unlike the Velvet Underground and wrote sad, lovely songs about being sad and lovely and having fairly ambitious beards. Further, one of the band's auteurs was named Bubba Kadane, which certainly set them apart from many of their peers and made their aficionados like them more. (If it's any measure of fan loyalty, the profusion of websites and mailing lists available online shocked even this longtime fan.) But then Bedhead broke up, which was sad and not very lovely. Now les freres Kadane have started a new band called the New Year, whose first LP is called Newness Ends, which isn't particularly sad. Thankfully, it's still pretty damned lovely. Everything surrounding the New Year's debut screams ""break with the past."" Seeing as the guys elect to use the word ""new"" in both album title and band name, someone might get the idea that these guys have something to prove. After all, Bedhead's sinuous, country-inflected sorrow and chimy guitar lines could be argued as one of the Ground Zeroes for the current slow-core renaissance, making theirs one of '90s-vintage indie rock's most distinctive, influential sounds. The obvious question for the band that now contains the braintrust of such a blockbuster act is whether to follow down the same path of their previous triumphs or to light out for new territory. Newness Ends cannily splits the difference between innovation and nostalgia. The New Year features Chris Brokaw on drums, where he follows roughly the same steps he did behind the kit for Codeine, another seminal drowsy-rock combo. His tempos here are a little juicier than they were in his Codeine days, as if his other occasional work as axeman for vicious avant-bluesers Come has led him to understand the virtues of amping up a bit. Not uncoincidentally, the New Year seem more willing to rock than their immediate antecedents ever were. ""Reconstruction"" builds from a quiet, circular guitar figure into a roiling jam, signaling the band's development from a frail, occasionally silent rock band into an edgier, more rock-and-roll outfit. Similarly, ""Gasoline"" hurtles forward, propelled by skittery drumming and endlessly inventive soloing. Though no one's going to mistake the New Year for the Donnas, someone involved here has connected with their inner Angus Young. Or, at any rate, their inner Albini. Mr. Shellac committed this LP to tape, and though it's hardly the grot-rock he's become known for, his less-is-more approach certainly aids Newness Ends. Now that the boys in the band are playing harder, with more propulsive riffs and structures, the bare-bones effects of the recording make them sound even leaner and, god forbid, meaner. Where music of this variety can often disappear into its own navel without warning, the New Year sound hale, healthy and ready to rock. Bear in mind, though, that on their swansong collaboration with compatriots Macha, Matt and Bubba Kadane managed to make Cher's ""Believe"" into a somber dirge, and their sedated side doesn't go neglected here, either. ""One Plus One Minus One Equals One"" is the sort of mumbled hymn that marmoset-looking character from Bright Eyes would give important teeth for: Nashville-esque lead guitar co-exists peaceably with subtle washes of feedback, and the band's rhythm section patiently anchors the track. ""Alter Ego"" is endearing, strummy pop that builds to a complex instrumental climax without ever turning into abstraction or sludge. So much of the Kadanes' new effort indicates a self-consciousness about their place in the cosmos. Newness Ends, from its title on down, seems conscious of the ways in which it looks to Bedhead's accomplishments while plotting the future. At the same time, the band's name bespeaks a certain hope for change and possibility. Let's hope both prophecies turn out to be true.","The Kadane brothers used to be in a band called Bedhead, who a lot of people liked because they sounded ...

My first pass through fixed::context left me completely bored. As with E Luxo So, there just didn't seem enough to the music to hold my interest. But each time I played it, fixed::context burrowed just a little deeper in my brain and I now hum the simple themes constantly, even when the record is nowhere in sight. I may have been a bit slow on the uptake initially because fixed::context is an absurdly minimal proposition. The whole record is only 37 minutes long; there are only four tracks, and each has a handful of different sounds hitting only five or six different notes. I'm not being facetious here: it actually is easy to count all the elements in any given piece. The side-long ""20"" opens with some gurgling electrical pops that sound like the first Pole record. Then a gentle synthesizer drone comes in, then a reverbed electric guitar that slowly alternates between two chords, then there are a few glitches, then there's a chord change, and a few minutes later some noise folds in as the piece fades out. All this happens one drip at a time over the course of 18 minutes. This static sound world first struck me as tedious, but now I find myself holding my breath when I sense a change coming, to maximize the substantial impact. It's been said before about other bands, but when music evolves so subtly and so slowly, each change carries greater weight. Isaac Babel once wrote about fiction, ""No iron can stab the heart with such force as a period put just at the right place."" The same holds true with the chord change, and this Zen-like approach is what this Labradford record is all about. And it is chords that drive the music on fixed::context, mostly plucked on a warm, spaghetti-western style electric guitar, E, A and D strings only. After dabbling with orchestral flourishes on their last two records, Labradford return to their instrumental roots here. To be honest, the clichéd sound of the ""soundtracky"" guitar is one of the things that turned me off from Labradford's last two records. But here, they've stripped the thing down so completely, and placed it so far in front, that it can be heard it in a different way. Its repetition almost seems like an electronic sequence, though the tone quality is pure early-'60s Nashville. The guitar is the focus as always, but the surrounding noises are what give each track its personality. ""Up to Pizmo"" makes smart use of an ambient house bass thump throughout, another electronic technique completely recontextualized. On ""David,"" Labradford weave an Eno-esque drone through the chord sequence, which, believe it or not, recalls the slow bridge of ""I'll Melt with You."" Each track is cut from the same plain cloth, but identifying details become clear over time, and they're worth the wait. Maybe I'm just meeting Labradford halfway, but this is an album I enjoyed spending the week in.","If ever an album rewarded repeated listening, it's this one.

She was alarmed. Massages, foot sucking, chest rubbing, phermone wipes, jimmy hats, and PVC pop up in my reviews with greater frequency than pimples on Dawson's cheek. I explained to her it was all for the entertaiment of the Internet masses and that I would try to turn it down a notch. So now Ryan Pitchfork sends me the new Momus record, featuring the tongue- and- other- body- parts- in- cheek ditty, ""Coming In A Girl's Mouth."" The song is catchy as hell, but somehow I can't picture cheerleaders jeeping to squad practice, cranking the FM, smacking gum, swaying back and forth, singing along with the insightful line, ""With a fluid the consistancy of honey, tapoica, and motor oil."" However, I bet Momus, the horny Scotch bastard, can picture this scenario vividly. With his boney frame in back holding onto the rollbar, giggling and goggling the girls with wide eyes through designer sunglasses smeared with a gossamer of splattered gnats, Momus daydreams new songs ideas: Momus: ""So, lassies, what do you think of me new record?"" Dumbest Cheerleader: ""It's, like, really sorta catchy but, like, sorta... like, weird in that Beck way or that, like, early '80s way. There isn't enough guitar. I, like, like a lot of guitar."" Smartest Cheerleader: ""I cringed at seeing the cover, on which you describe your newest music as 'analog baroque,' which I suppose beats 'moog rococo.' However, I'm still flashing back to my step-dad playing 'Hooked On Classics' in his Impulse. Half of these songs twinkle with pansy-ass Casio harpsichord sounds. It'd be better off as spoken word."" Dumbest Cheerleader: ""What's up with the powdered wig? You look totally like Kip Winger's grandpa."" Momus: ""I had a bad eye infection and watched 'Amadeus' in the hospital."" Smartest Cheerleader: ""Your lyrics are very intelligent. The bitter tales of twisted love and pleasureless sex, juxtaposed to the intentionally programmed, banal toy-pop, drive home your theme-- social satire delivered in the most watered- down, common music of the society you're poking fun at. It's totally like ""Scream 2"" making fun of bad slasher flicks even though it totally is a horrible slasher flick."" Momus: ""I hope it's not like that."" Dumbest Cheerleader: ""Hehe! Oh my gawd! You say 'cock' in this song!"" Smartest Cheerleader: ""Okay, it's more like a 'Red Shoe Diaries' written by Vonnegut. Take 'Walter Carlos,' for example. That's a song about a guy who has a sex change. You speculate about his female form travelling back in time to marry his older male form."" Dumbest Cheerleader: ""Eww, gross."" Momus: ""Walter Carlos is a real person. Er, I mean, Wendy Carlos. She's suing me over that song."" Dumbest Cheerleader: ""Punk rock."" Smartest Cheerleader: ""I don't know, Momus. This album will be big in Japan, but I'm afraid only girls dressed in plastic barettes and Keroppi tees, and Anglophilic boys with Tamagotchi keychains will get into this in America. You're John Waters cult level. Coy cosmopolitan pop produced by a randy eccentric just isn't quite radio- ready in the USA. At best, jaded music critics who read Conde Nast magazines on the crapper will go ga-ga over this stuff."" Momus: ""That's okay. I'm big in Sweden."" Smartest Cheerleader: ""You're terribly clever. Perhaps too clever for your own good. The karaoke contest is brilliant. I love the way you supply instrumental versions of each song for fans to karaoke over for possible inclusion on your next album! That's marketing. It's all so very post- whatever. Unfortunately, you dangerously tread into the shallow waters of novelty. The Little Red Songbook is all brains and no body. It's pop genius brains in a tupperware tub. For someone so into sex and bodies, it's ironic that you don't realize that music too needs to be a complete package. Our American ears like to be fucked by sexy chords and chiseled, curvaceous rhythms. All the genius lyrics and karaoke ideas would just be frosting and gravy."" Dumbest Cheerleaders: ""We like Beck! Where it's at! Where it's at! I'm a loser bay-bee!""

13,Blur,by: Brent DiCrescenzo,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a0d99d034d5c69bf2804/1:1/w_160/dd2c4191.jpg,1999-03-23 06:00:08,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/831-13/,Virgin,"Six albums into their envious career, Blur have finally found a sound to match their name. I'm sure the name initially came from the donut- stuffed mouth of Virgin A&R; reps who feared selling a band called ""Seymour"" to the Teens UK. ""Blur"" fits the mold of the monosyllabic, schwa- voweled noun system of Brit-rock nomenclature-- Pulp, Bush, Lush, Suede. Now, after nearly a decade, Blur have grown comfortable with their image and talents. From now on, it's their mission to make ears and speakers uncomfortable. With producer William Orbit spreading gobs of digital fuzz, guitar wash, and deep- space bleeps in heavy strokes with William De Kooning- esque glee, the tracks on 13 bounce between studio walls, planets, and effects pedals until slowly unraveling and releasing with mercurian flashes and cherubic keyboard. It all... well... blurs. The more Guitar God status fans and critics throw on Graham Coxon, the more Coxon attempts to vigorously destroy such notions with feedback, drilling, and controlled crust, which in turn just makes the fans and critics swoon even more. From the wandering melodies that twang and fall apart in ""Tender"" to the tongue- in- cheek metal- solo, vacuum theremin freakout, and surf- boogie ending in ""Bugman,"" to the crescendoing strums of ""1992,"" Coxon drops creative brain- blowers all over 13. Yet, the album sounds nothing like the band's last self- titled LP. These days, Coxon's guitars are manipulated to sound unlike guitars. Plus, layers of organs and loops balance out the intoxicating mix. But it's Orbit's UFO studio tricks make 13 a much more cohesive and consistant record than the eponymous LP. Despite Graham Coxon's fingerprints, 13 is Damon Albarn's record from start to finish. From the opening epic, ""Tender,"" in which Albarn delivers the line ""Love's the greatest thing that we have"" with a sarcastic croon after admiting that his heart screwed up his life, to the beautiful, stripped closer, ""No Distance Left to Run,"" in which he sighs with resignation, ""It's over/ You don't need to tell me/ I hope you're with someone who makes you feel safe in your sleep,"" Albarn opens his veins over 13's DAT tapes. Sort of. On ""Swamp Song,"" though, he goes all Iggy Pop, grabbing the mic with sass and pose. And ""B.L.U.R.E.M.I."" could be a Brainiac song, the closest tune here to attaining the backlashed ""Whoo-Hoo!"" Despite all the knob- twiddling and pedal- kicking, 13 contains several surprisingly subtle songs. ""Trim Tramm"" bobs along to quiet chords before kicking in the jets, and ""Mellow Song"" lets dainty moon- cocktail piano lines and hollow chimes swirl around lovely acoustic plucking. Each song is unique, yet fits perfectly into the overall hungover, psychedelic, 2001 mood. Once again, Blur has kept one step ahead of expectations (well, okay, they didn't with The Great Escape, but that was still a great record) and continued to impress. In a way, Blur is one of the last big old- school ""album"" bands, a band more concerned with their entire career than radio singles, more concerned with ""album"" than ""song."" The Beatles made a dozen albums in the '60s and continually progressed. The reason why is simple: when a band is really, really good, they consistently make good records. Duh.","Six albums into their envious career, Blur have finally found a sound to match their name. I'm sure the ...

I fiddled nervously with the disc the whole way home, terrified that my Friends had joined the minions of Electronica. When I got the disc playing, however, I was met not with some ridiculous skittering beat, but with a moog and an organ, breathing slowly for a minute and a half in a way which immediately laid my fears to rest. Atardecer, the Friends of Dean Martinez's Knitting Factory debut, does incorporate a level of technology that I had previously thought irreconcilable to their sound. But there are no MIDI sequences here, and no smooth studio wizardry-- just the rough waveforms of moogs, harmoniums and weird analog effects: in short, the type of technology which actually belongs on dusty industrial shelving alongside the shells of old daisy- wheel printers. It hasn't replaced Bill Elm's haunting steel or desert sensibility, but instead has added a layer of texture which allows Atardecer to continue in the vein of previous Friends of Dean Martinez albums without simply retreading old ground. The opening track, ""Quickening,"" is no doubt the first Friends recording to be completely devoid of guitar, and it's just plain pretty. Likewise, the record's closer is likely the only Friends song on which Elm desn't play a lick, with Dave Lachance taking drum, bass, guitar and organ duties and laying them all over an expected beatbox. In between are nine tunes ranging from the straight- ahead band sound of ""Ethchlorvynol"" to the album's highlight ""Casa Mila,"" whose nylon string guitar and harpsichord eventually give way to a background of spacious washes and bleeps. Ultimately Atardecer reveals the extent to which the Friends of Dean Martinez is really Bill Elm's project, presenting itself as a cohesive whole in a way the band's two preceding albums have not quite managed. And the introduction of some new toys has helped head off the fear that these guys might find themselves the victims of the misconception that they're merely a lounge revival novelty. These songs are too sincere, and just plain too pretty for that.","The moment I saw the packaging I knew something was up: the cover art features the sort of computer punch- ...

In the past, that tiny little island has ingested the cream of American music and curdled it into some of the hugest moneymakers of all time. The list of UK successes is a long one: the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, Led Zeppelin, Howard Jones. Popular music makes so much money for the UK economy that Prime Minister Tony Blair could probably close down all the steel works and coal mines in Britain and pension off all the workers with funds generated by the Def Leppard back catalogue alone. So why is it that the UK, until now, has been entirely incapable of producing a credible rapper? The superficial answer is that a sarf Lahn-dahn accent is not exactly as street- real as a Noo Yawk one. But the theory bites, because by that reasoning, you'd have to rule out Arrested Development and the No Limits roster (oh, go on, please!). This baffling conundrum morphs into an impenetrable enigma when one factors in trip-hop. Massive Attack and Tricky have produced some superb platters but I doubt that you would call any of them rap albums. (That's why they call it trip-hop, I suppose.) But along comes Roots Manuva just to really baffle my already befuddled noggin. Brand New Secondhand is as near as I think the UK is going to get to an out- and- out and credible rap album. But with one proviso: Manuva delivers his consciousness rhymes in a sort of Brixton patois. So rather than getting something as woeful as MC Tunes banging on in his finest Mancunian eloquence, you get the most intriguing and appealing voices I have heard in years. I find Roots Manuva's delivery addictive, compelling, and, above all, heartfelt. His rhymes aren't exaggerated fantasies about pimping, high- rolling, and dismembering. No, the man has immersed himself in Rastafarian culture vibe and speaks of injustice and inequality, strength and resilience. In short, he is the postivity rapper you don't laugh at. ""Juggle Tings Proper"" advises that we should roll with the punches adversity deals out, but remain upstanding and proud. ""Inna"" is a realistic documentary about being in a bar, getting intoxicated and trying to cop off with the barmaid, before ending up in a semiconscious state on the floor. Manuva doesn't play this scenario for laughs; it's more of a warning against loss of self- control and dignity. Guest rapper Butterfly reprises this theme of pride in oneself ""Baptism:"" ""If you ever catch me dancing on a table top in a thong/ In a seedy dive/ Looking sad/ Like my stuff's gone wrong/ Yeah, for now I'm focused, diligent, strong."" And as a riposte to the callous exploitative stance of most commercial rap, Manuva chants during ""Big Tings Gwidarn:"" ""I jump upon the stage/ But I won't grab my dick/ I get down though/ Giving thanks to the creator."" Roots Manuva throws down such cruel, money- driven attitudes and replaces them with a roots- informed honesty and integrity. All these heartical rhymes are accompanied by sparse, bass- heavy tracks. Manuva has selected the anti- Bomb Squad approach-- little more than a bassline and a beat box. But where Public Enemy's producers crammed every moment with an assaulting urban noise, Manuva adores the off- kilter silence, employed so compellingly in masterful dub records. Nanosecond snippets of a soul vocalist run through ""Inna."" ""Juggle Tings Proper"" is propelled by nothing more than a thunderous bass line and a thrillingly syncopated percussion track. ""Strange Behavior"" wobbles on a nervy fretless bass figure and the metallic clanking of a iron gate. Similar to labelmate DJ Vadim, Roots Manuva revels in the abstract sounds of everyday objects (check out the cover art of a tumble of ancient microwave ovens and furniture held together with duct tape). So the album's title accurately reflects this marvelous album's contents. With his fresh dubby spin on rap, he's made a genre long gone the way of the hula- hoop relevant and dynamic, while simultaneously confounding vapid pop culturists everywhere. As he chants on the album's opening track, ""There's no blood in my body/ Just liquid soul.""","For politcially unaware, socially unconscious, ethically moribund pop culture vultures, there's no bigger disappointment than UK hip-hop.

So, with his parietal lobe ringing with his neo-Stockhausen ditties, Vogel abandoned being a Cabbage Head and headed south to the seedy coastal resort of Brighton, home of the cheeky wink, donkey rides across the beach, and shameless one- night- stands with skanks from all over the United Kingdom. Vogel probably told his folks that he was moving to Brighton to get a degree in 20th-century music; not to soak up the low-rent sleaze of his new home and fall in with a no-good bunch of twisted techno heads. Six months after handing over his first cup- a- noodle- bespattered rent check to his landlord, then-unknown local DJ Luke Slater picked up on Vogel's experimental sound and spread the word around to such an extent that abstract dance maven Colin Dale was soon dropping Vogel's ""Aux Culture"" DAT into his sets. Dave Clarke followed by signing Vogel to his Magnetic North label and the pair combined Clarke's jazz-imbued rhythm programming with Vogel's passion for outlandish analog noise. By 1994, Europe's techno big boys noticed dear Cristian, and the Frankfurt-based, Gilles Deleuze-worshipping, Mille Plateaux label, known for the abstract experimentalism (and Germanness) of its techno releases, released the superb Beginning to Understand and the disorientating live and improvised knob tweak-a-thon Specific Momentum. And once Mille Plateux had him, Berlin's mighty club-friendly Tresor label had to have him, too. Vogel's albums for Tresor are geared towards the dance floor, a prerogative that doesn't always bring out the best in Vogel, and Busca Invisibles bears out this criticism. Vogel excels when he generates warped, mechanical tones from his analog equipment and when he complements these alien shrieks and snarls with downtempo dub percussion. Beginning to Understand's ""Scuba Dub"" is the paramount example of Vogel's skill: it begins a dark blob of sound which uncoils into a squirming slug of a track, which leaves indelible slime trails. But nothing on Busca Invisibles matches it. See, in order to get the kids dancing, Mr. DJ can't offer them weird-ass noises plucked from the patch cords of some twentysomething Morton Subotnik. Vogel's unique when he's concentrating on contorting sine waves, and on Busca Invisibles he showcases this talent. Just not to the extent that he does on his albums for Mille Plateux. Don't get the impression that Busca Invisbles is a stinker of a dance record. Just as Neil Landstrumm's Bedrooms and Cities release took on the champagne and Versace sounds of speed garage and unfashioned them into raw machine music, Busca Invisibles throttles nu electro and should remind Warp Records that the future and present of electronic music is not Jimi Tenor's lounge porn. Given the choice between the Venga Boys and ""Sarcastically Tempered Powers,"" I know which I'd hurl myself around a club to. The opening to ""Shoe Renouncing Soul"" teases with untainted tones before Vogel lets loose his greasy beats and a severely spiked bass line. He starts ""Slices of Sink"" by aping Underworld's ""Bruce Lee"" before stomping his hallmark analogia all over the twitching spread; all the while it sounds like he's having tons of fun putting these tracks together. For this reason, Busca Invisbles is a lighter listen not only than his other albums, but also than the output of his Brighton buddies, Justin Berkovi and Jamie Lidell. As the album's title indicates, Vogel may still be seeking the invisible, but you get the impression he got a clear idea where to continue looking.","Reports didn't exactly come flooding in, but apparently Vogel's field research for Busca Invisibles took place in discotheques ...

Futureworld,Trans Am,by: Brent DiCrescenzo,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a7fbc0084474cd0c0d12/1:1/w_160/97f588e5.gif,1999-03-23 06:00:04,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8137-futureworld/,Thrill Jockey,"When I was a boy, I wanted to live in the movie Tron. Hell, I still want to live in Tron. Every object bathed in a blue glow, those suits made from mouse-pad material, killer frisbees and laser sails... Of course, at this point, I realize that technology will never bring my dream to fruition. But at the very least, I can listen to Trans Am's Futureworld and close my eyes. I nearly wept from nostalgia at the minimal Atari landscape cover of Futureworld. In this age of four million polygons per second, liquid animation, and ""Quake II,"" the simple pixelized Atari grid takes on Zen-like qualities. Trans Am realize that the future is always better in our heads now than when we actually get there. I'd love to think that rock in the future all sounds like Trans Am. I'd also like to teleport and have robot pal. But really, music in the future will still just be some teen named Spunky Glee singing about crushes over Roni Size beats. Opening with distorted blasts of saxophone and droning frequencies, Futureworld flat out smokes. Drums relentlessly pummel away while blasts of incinerating keyboard melt neck- snapping basslines. Synthesizers drench the caustic crunch with melody and hooks. The echo of an infinite yellow on black matrix chimes throughout. Not since Brainiac has a band better fused crushing riffs with sinister computer effects and a tongue pressed slightly against the cheek. A robotic voice commands, ""Come back to my house, baby"" (in both English and German) in ""Am Rhein."" Then in the next track, ""Cocaine Computer,"" the robot kicks out a nasty 80's funk jam after it has assumedly successfully seduced the character from ""Am Rhein."" Picture the droid from ""Short Circuit"" pulling a Barry White on Ally Sheedy in a scene of cyborg debauchery and crapulence. Futureworld is wonderfully lo-fi and direct, and the band's first cohesive album thus far. Trans Am craft ""Pong"" punk that somehow successfully fuses Shellac and Pan Sonic. Somewhere in a fantasy world, on green pastures of silicon motherboard, in clubs shaped liked RAM chips and transistors, Trans Am is the only rock band with soul, precision, licks, swagger, ambience, and good looks to boot.","When I was a boy, I wanted to live in the movie Tron.

Pucker Up!,Teen Idols,by: Michael Sandlin,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a743ea9e61561daa5548/1:1/w_160/98ebcd8c.gif,1999-03-23 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7953-pucker-up/,Honest Don'sHonest Don's,"Well, from the band's namesake alone, we already know what to expect: a King Crimson-soundalike or, possibly, a barely-audible slowcore outfit modeled after Low or Mojave 3, perhaps? Yeah, right. The Idols are young, attitudinal Nashville greaseballs that grab us by the belt loops and shake our emo-deadened asses up-- in the attempt to convince everybody that not all Nashvillians are Power For Living types that vacation in Branson, Missouri and think Ray Stevens is a real hoot. Upon first listen, they remind me of an uptempo, less world-weary Social Distortion-- you know, if Mike Ness and Co. had turned to coffee and Jolt cola instead of self-pity, smack, and booze. But I think a Ramones influence wins out here, as the guitarist, Phillip, reels off those lightning-quick Johnny Ramone chord changes like he was born to do it. And he even takes a few rare solos that aren't all that embarrassing. The band also boasts that undeniable Arthur Fonzarelli fashion sense: the studded black leather over the white t-shirts. They've got the greased-back duck-tail hair-sculpting thing going on, the cigarette behind the ear, the requisite array of arrow- through- the- heart tattoos, and cartoon characters. Oh, and for all you truck-stop chauvinists out there, get a load of the chick bass player-- the busty stereotypical blond with the pouty lips, tight t-shirt and painted-on patent leather pants. Looks like she might enjoy bouncing around a lot on stage. The Teen Idols' approach to songwriting is every bit as obvious as their image and band moniker would suggest. So I'll mercifully spare you any unnecessary bullshit analysis. As predictable and intentionally unoriginal as this punk-pop with a bubblegum center is, maybe I can still direct you to a few ""standout"" tracks. Take the title cut, for starters; it's a feisty little kiss-off to two-faced brown-nosers. And ""Insanity Plea"" is powered by the Idols' characteristic muscle-chord strength and bruising bass drum kick. Then you've got the fast 'n' furious (and especially comical) ditties about the Information Age's mechanically-dependent robo-children, ""Virtual Loser"" and ""Test Tube Teens."" One of the things that sets the Idols apart from your average testosterone-fueled grease-rock outfit is a much-needed dose of estrogen in the vocals-- big-boned, velvet-throated bassist Heather combines with the fellas for some of the strongest guy/gal harmonizing around. Unfortunately, Pucker Up, with its one-dimensional slant on punk, is capable of yielding too much of a good thing. Some of these three-chord, pedal- to- the- metal stomps have plenty of acceleration, but lack that key melodic line or hook that really burns rubber in the subconscious. And I'm not sure why so many bands, Teen Idols included, get a such a chuckle out of tacking on pointless filler towards the end of a particular disc. Here they include silly-ass studio bloopers and other moronic chatter during the final ten or so minutes of the album. I guess it must be some desperate need to communicate just how freaky, spontaneous and fun being stoned in a recording studio can be. The Teen Idols have enough up-yours attitude and sense of fun to be, I would imagine, a truly great live band. And now that the old guard of punks like Social Distortion and the Ramones have aged and petered out, and young fogies like Green Day have become self-righteous acoustic-plucking auteurs, we could certainly do worse than a little Teen Idolatry.","Well, from the band's namesake alone, we already know what to expect: a King Crimson-soundalike or, possibly, a barely-audible ...

Solar 3,Bailter Space,by: Jeremy Schneyer,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a2015e6ef95969320301/1:1/w_160/60ff5778.gif,1999-03-23 06:00:02,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/536-solar-3/,TurnbuckleTurnbuckle,"It's been nearly a month since I saw Bailter Space play live and my ears still haven't recovered. Needless to say, I've been to a great deal of concerts in my time, but Bailter Space wins the contest hands down for ""most pummeling wall of sound."" While impish bassist John Halvorsen bobbed around the stage and drummer Brent MacLachlan laid down some incredibly monolithic, mechanical (yet sometimes mind-numbingly complex) beats, singer/guitarist Alister Parker looked like he was completely immersed in a world of his own. Looking as if he could have been plucked from the offices of a British accountancy firm, he stood onstage stalk-still, whispering his monotonal, chant-like lyrics and creating an absolutely unholy din with his unsuspecting Rickenbacker. He was either completely bored by the proceedings, or was being mystically transported by them. It's hard to know. But, hey, the important thing here is that the live Bailter Space machine creates a huge mess of sound that's simultaneously beautiful, jagged, atonal, and supremely melodic. Their latest offering, Solar 3, does a fine job of imitating their huge live sound. Departing from both the spastic bursts of barely coherent noise that riddled last year's Photon EP, and the slightly poppier directions they explored on their two previous albums, Capsul and Wammo, they return to a sound very much like that of their landmark 1994 LP, Vortura. Great, spacious sheets of guitar noise collide with Halvorsen's pulsing, tugging basslines and MacLachlan's murderously precise drumming. Layered on top are Parker's mantra-like lyrics, which vary from a quiet whisper to a ragged, strangled scream. The songs themselves range from the lulling, peaceful 8+ minutes of ""Tide"" and the comparatively poppy, dreamy ""Live for You"" to the full-on pummeling attack of ""Windows on the World"" and ""Two Stars."" Parker's lyrics on Solar 3 are more concerned with human relationships than interstellar ones. And the fact that Parker is actually singing about-- rather than merely alluding to-- real people and emotions, lends a refreshing human warmth to the otherwise rather chilly proceedings. While the fact is that most Bailter Space songs don't amount to much more than a few lines sung quietly over a couple of chords played at deafening volumes, the whole package has the ability to transport the unsuspecting listener into the aural equivalent of the center of an imploding star. Now if somebody would only let me in on what the hell ""Bailter Space"" actually means, I'd be set.","It's been nearly a month since I saw Bailter Space play live and my ears still haven't recovered ...

The Albemarle Sound,The Ladybug Transistor,by: Mark Richardson,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc69eb335119a49ecc69/1:1/w_160/bafe79a3.gif,1999-03-23 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4628-the-albemarle-sound/,MergeMerge,"Something I've come to pay attention to in music over the last few years is the idea of ""arrangement."" A good arranger can choose the right instruments and deploy them in a harmonically rich combination to dress up even the lamest melody, making something fresh and beautiful in the process. In classic pop, from Tin Pan Alley forward, arrangement and the voicing of the instruments can mark the difference between a forgotten record and one that gets on heavy rotation in perfect pop heaven. At one time something of a lost art, arranging has enjoyed a renaissance of late with renewed interest in vintage Brazilian pop, Brian Wilson, Burt Bacharach, and others unafraid to sweat the details of how complex music is assembled. Jim O'Rourke, Robert Schneider and Sean O'Hagan are three contemporary masters of arrangement plying their craft in the world of indie rock. To those names I would also add Ladybug Transistor leader Gary Olson. On The Algemarle Sound he uses the time- worn elements of piano, guitar, bass, drums, violin, cello, saxophones, flutes, trumpets and organs to conjure the more mainstream, less trippy side of breezy '60s music. Admittedly, this record is shamelessly derivative, right down to the ""Blue Moon"" chord changes of ""Oceans in the Hall"" (which, if it had a reggae beat, could be the new millenium's ""The Tide is High""). And some will instinctively view this shoulder- glancing with contempt in the age where ""new"" and ""different"" are supposed to be synonymous with ""good."" But they would be missing out on some incredibly fun music. The first thing I love about this album is that it's 12 songs and 35 minutes, short and sweet like they used to rock 'em before CDs overwhelmed us with ""value."" I'll bet the Ladybugs had 20 songs to start with and chose the best dozen, because all of these (save the inexplicably terrible closer ""Aleida's Theme"") are wonderful. The sound is orchestrated, lush, piano- based pop that wraps all manner of instrumentation around the catchy melodies like a thick down comforter. And wending through it all is Gary Olson's appealing voice which sounds, I swear, like the Human League's Philip Oakey. It's cool, restrained, deep and pretty, without range but with just the right amount of clarity for these songs. And like every element here, it sounds like it's been laid in the perfect place. Those who yearn for a slightly more sophisticated and restrained version of that '60s- channeling Elephant 6 vibe should promptly tune in to the Ladybug Transistor.","Something I've come to pay attention to in music over the last few years is the idea of ""arrangement ...

Where's Wolfie?,Wolfie,by: Brent DiCrescenzo,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929aa6bb1335d7bf1699676/1:1/w_160/0ec99b9b.gif,1999-03-23 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8732-wheres-wolfie/,ParasolMudParasolMud,"If this is what independent music has come to, things are a lot worse than we could have ever imagined. It's understandable that total junk rules the mainstrem airwaves. We've come to expect that ever since Shakespeare and the Globes went to number one with their horribly cliched ballad, ""I'll Deflower You"" in 1602. Ricky Martin-- who apparently had fat and plastic removed from his head and reinserted into his pectorals to give him the look of a guy who used to be kind of cut but has since stopped working out and is just on the verge of going completely ex-lineman on us-- seems destined to make millions off the Summer Hit of '99 which he hath wrought. Today, the most completely inept jingle skyrockets to the top of the charts. In the year 2000, look for the Jimmy Jam (featuring Jimmy Page) Remix of ""Baa- Ba- Baa- Baa- Buh (The Pepsi Song)"" and a new funk- metal band called Poop to rule the charts. In this sad climate, something as inconceivably horrible and derivative as Wolfie could score a hit. But here's the joke-- Wolfie are so incompetent at their instruments they can't even hope for that much. Instead, they cater more toward the art- school freshman class who will, just minutes from now, proclaim that I ""just don't get it."" There's a sort of Twee License that plagues pop music. Audiences seem to cut some slack for a band if they're ""cute."" Aww, ain't Wolfie cute?! ""Where's Wolfie?! Where is he?! I can't see him! Peek-a-boo! There he is! I see Wolfie!"" And after seeing Wolfie pound on a drumset and keyboard they obviously just got for Christmas from Service Merchandise, I proclaimed to a friend, ""My lord, that's total junk."" ""But it's pop, Brent! It's just supposed to be like that. You're not supposed to think about it."" Really, have we come to this? Why has bad pop become excusable because of its inherent property of being labeled pop? Why can Wolfie randomly wail, ""Bah- Buh- Bah- Ba- Ba- Ba- Ba"" without thinking how it relates to the song or chord progression at all? And, alright, let's just say you're really into pop. It's just pop. I can show you a stack of great pop music! That's what I'm here for. Check out the Wrens or Super Furry Animals, who bore into your skull with inhuman hooks while still maintaining a progressive, wildly creative edge. Where's Wolfie opens with the ""Pinwheel""- esque ""Little Bee is Dancin'."" Wait, Wolfie, shouldn't that be ""Li'l Bee is Dancin'?"" I don't think it's cute enough as it is. This song introduces the jangled pounding that continues throughout the album. ""Steely Dan"" is so incompetent that it manages to make Bis sound vaguely techinically accomplished. Wolfie's other signatures and trademarks-- aside from their self- conscious cute-ass antics-- are repetition, fumbling, and ""Sweet Valley High"" poetics. I offer ""Busy Busy Busy"" and ""Knew It, Knew It"" as examples. I'll give you three seconds to figure out how those songs go. Alright, if you guessed ""Busy Busy Busy, Bah Bah Bah Bah Bah,"" you're damned close. Another scary aspect of Wolfie's music is their ability to brainwash kids who just don't know any better. Check out what other zines have said about Wolfie: ""Lots of ""na- na- na's"" and ""la-la's"" to sing along with. If you like happiness, you will like Wolfie. If you don't, you're a meanie and I don't like you."" --Big Orange Crayon
""If, however, you love tapping your fingers and bobbing your head to wonderfully creative music, then Awful Mess Mystery [Wolfie's full- length debut] is a surefire favorite."" --Signal Drench These zines should look up ""cloy"" in the dictionary. This, honestly, is enough to make us at Pitchfork want to give up. ""Wonderfully creative music!"" My god! With all sincerity, that breaks my heart. Maybe I should write a two- chord song about my feelings and impress the guy that runs Signal Drench. I think I'll call it ""My Wittle heart is All Pitter- Patty."" It will go G C G C D and it'll have some moog- stabs in there. I'll get a girl in a tight t-shirt to go ""la-la-la"" over it. If you enjoy attending the Annual High School ""Battle of the Bands,"" by all means, pick up this album. But if you really want good pop music, please go get a Beatles album, the Nuggets box set, Pet Sounds- era Beach Boys, the Magnetic Fields, Weezer, Built to Spill, Heavenly, Velocity Girl, the Charlatans UK, the Wrens, Chisel, the Pixies, the Cardigans, Blur, Edsel, the Wrens, Sloan, Supergrass, Karate, the Crabs, the La's...","If this is what independent music has come to, things are a lot worse than we could have ever imagined ...

Well, me. On a drab, overcast day spent thousands of miles away from the one you wish to be with most, nothing seems to fit quite as well as the somber sounds of minor chords strummed delicately on an acoustic guitar alongside tranquil and expressive vocals. And this is one of those days. Songs: Ohia's ethereal Axxess and Ace is a natural choice to compose this precise type of musical backdrop. This is that rare kind of album that won't grab you until you've reached a certain mood, at which point it will unexpectedly brandish the switchblade it was hiding in its back pocket and carve its initials into your heart. The initials primarily responsible for Axxess and Ace are ""J.M.,"" standing for Jason Molina, a 26 year-old songwriting prodigy who fashions folk songs with a plausibility and earnestness which belies his age. Molina wields an emphatic, powerful voice which lends itself well to the solemn candor of his compositions. But unlike so many would-be folk prophets, Molina radiates an immediate endearing sincerity. In this sense, Axxess and Ace's sound greatly resembles that of Palace Brother Will Oldham. Admittedly, Molina is more emotionally explicit and vocally polished than Oldham, but the two both employ the same sparse musical structure and evoke the same mood. Like Oldham's I See a Darkness, Axxess and Ace's moving choruses, recalling enigmatic lands of perpetual dusk and love unrequited, are achieved with only acoustic guitar, vocals, and the occasional sparse drum or bass. Many of these tracks feature remarkable backing vocals by the gifted Edith Frost which imbues them with a level of sexual tension befitting the romantically jaded and perplexed lyrics. On ""How to Be Perfect Men,"" Molina croons ""Be mine/ Until you're reminded of something better,"" a statement fairly indicative of his exhausted bewilderment at love. Before the stunning climax of ""Come Back to Your Man,"" Molina reveals that ""There are demands on spirit and flesh/ And I've made the effort to survive them."" At 26, a poor young minstrel already weary of the emotional demands of romantic ardor. Axxess & Ace isn't necessarily remarkable for its musical precision and innovation in composition, but for its striking authenticity-- the free form of Molina's songs is an asset. The various musicians who performed on Axxess and Ace hadn't actually heard any of Molina's planned compositions until the day they were recorded, and the album is recorded almost completely live. Thus, the feel of the album is unrehearsed and genuine. Axxess and Ace is a fine addition to the collection of any refined music aesthete and an empathic companion to any contemplative mood.","More melancholy acoustic ballads-- who needs 'em, right?

CM: Cornelius Mix,Cornelius,by: Nick Mirov,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a667b1335d7bf1698e0d/1:1/w_160/474fc93e.gif,1999-03-09 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1610-cm-cornelius-mix/,Matador,"Really now, what the last remix album that was worth anyone's time? Bjork's Telegram, perhaps. Maybe (and this is a big maybe) Tortoise Remixed. But the majority of remix albums that immediately come to mind-- the Sea and Cake's Two Gentlemen, owL remix Low, the High Llamas' Lollo Rosso, Mogwai's Kicking a Dead Pig, the Jon Spencer Blues Explosion's Experimental Remixes-- have only one or two tracks worthy of even hardcore fans. I know it's dumb to complain, since the remix industry has always been less about interesting reinterpretations of songs and more about giving sonic handjobs to each other (""Sonic the Handjob""-- now there' a Playstation title I wouldn't mind playing), but that doesn't mean I still can't be harsh on CM for simply being representative of the genre. Look. Cornelius is a fucking genius, I think we can all agree on that. But he succumbs to a bad case of Remixer's Syndrome on CM, wherein everything he remixes ends up sounding just like him. Thus, CM sounds like Fantasma with the original songs reduced to mere samples. Or, conversely, Cornelius reuses scads of samples and production techniques from Fantasma in the CM remixes, to the point where it might be redundant to own both albums. Either way, it's the same thing. To be fair, there are indeed some interesting moments on CM. Cornelius takes Money Mark's rather lead- footed pop song ""Maybe I'm Dead"" and makes it feather- light, the vocals floating about in a dreamy lounge arrangement. And UNKLE's ""Ape Shall Never Kill Ape"" melds punk rock rhythms with cartoony orchestral swoops so seamlessly you wonder why no one thought of it before. But overall, Cornelius sounds like he isn't trying too hard. Maybe it's that his sounds are so recognizably him that it sounds rote, or that the choice of artists he chose to remix seems pretty obvious, with the exception of the Pastels, whose ""Windy Hill"" is ironically the most enjoyable track on CM. (On the other hand, this version is also available on the Pastels' infinitely more enjoyable Illuminati rexix LP.) In that respect, CM is a grand missed opportunity; just think of what it would have been like had Cornelius tried to remix, say, his Matador labelmates. Cornelius remixing Cat Power? Yo La Tengo?
