AM,Karl Blau,by: Mike McGonigal,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b5c79d034d5c69bf50a2/1:1/w_160/330d4081.jpg,2008-04-29 05:00:02,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11425-am/,Whistler,"When confronted with Karl Blau's large and often excellent catalog, the inevitable question is: Why isn't this guy at least as well known as his musical cohorts Phil Elverum and Laura Veirs? It's easy to get on one's soapbox and suppose that people want mediocrity. I mean, how else are we to explain the success of a musical Steve Guttenberg such as M. Ward? One can argue that when it comes to music, the public tends to applaud a certain kind of consistency, with records that sound familiar. But that's of course a false dichotomy. And while none of us would easily deny fame and influence, some artists simply choose the roads less traveled (if I may be allowed to make a high school poetry reference rather than a grad school one). Blau-- who's one-third of supertrio D+ (alongside Bret Lunsford from Beat Happening and the aforementioned Elverum) and who's worked with Mirah, Wolf Colonel, Nate Ashley, the Microphones, and Little Wings-- certainly seems more interested in winding backroads than interstates. The Anacortes, Wash.-based singer-songwriter is kind of like Kevin Ayers with a work ethic. A strong advocate for all-ages venues, his own monthly record service (Kelp!) sends CD-Rs and LPs directly to fans. He may re-record a Microphones album or collect field recordings. His entire shtick might be precious and trite if the work weren't also so straightforward and excellent. Blau's delightful new record is called AM. Actually, it's not that new. Having originally released it in a more stripped-down form as a CD-R via his monthly record service Kelp! in late 2006, Blau started on this album after he finished work on 2006's Beneath Waves. ""As B.W. was a live with band album for the most part, I took some time to record by my lonesome,"" Blau explains via email. The album meanders from anxious and droney tunes such as the hurdy gurdy (or is that melodica?)-plus-guitar feedback opening number ""Morning Prayer"" to laid-back folksy groovers like the drawling last track, ""In the Morning"". The latter song has all of the charm of the least angsty and full-throated songs by Kurt Cobain. Speaking of the 1990s, ""Yellow Sunbonnet"" sounds like the drunken demo version of some forgotten grunge hit, while the playful xylophone on ""Growing Up"" sounds like Skip Spence doing a pop-punk tune backed by second graders. I'm not sure if it qualifies as a concept album, but three of the songs on AM have the word ""morning"" in the title. And then two tunes have the word ""bird"" in the title, which is apparently something one hears if one is to awaken early, the sound of birds. I personally am a late riser, but I love the idea of the morning. So does Blau, who writes that ""AM was written and recorded in the wee hours of the day to reflect beginnings: spring, childhood, morning."" And AM has multiple meanings, too: ""I adopted and adapted several poems-- one paragraph actually from a Winnie the Pooh story-- by A.A. Milne. I was reading his work to my daughter at the time of recording this; it hit me that this was very much in the vein of what I was doing with the music."" Again, this enterprise would be so fucking twee if almost anyone else did it. I hasten to add that it's entirely possible to listen to this without being aware of the song's origins. It's not like there's a cover of Loggins and Messina's ""House at Pooh Corner"" or anything. And musically, it owes no debts to either Belle or Sebastian. Instead, it's a messy experimental folk-pop album of songs recorded in the bedroom before the artist was fully awake. It's awesome.","Washington state singer-songwriter, who's one-third of supertrio D+ alongside Bret Lunsford from Beat Happening and Phil Elverum, returns with an eccentric album of home-recorded tunes.

Kensington Heights,Constantines,by: Jason Crock,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b5e4ea9e61561daa6e96/1:1/w_160/2da23623.jpg,2008-04-29 05:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11451-kensington-heights/,Arts & Crafts,"Every Constantines release from their 2001 self-titled debut to a pair of EPs to 2003's Shine a Light, was the stuff of thumbtacked liner notes on bedroom doors, worn and threadbare t-shirts, frayed patches sewn on backpacks and jackets-- nay, tattoos. They stole brazenly from heroes of dinosaur rock while dressing down their idol culture in their lyrics and demeanor, and reconstructed their music to a desperate beat. It was enough to make you believe rock and roll was a dead horse worth flogging. Yet the band's third album, Tournament of Hearts, found the band tugged in a few different directions, one of which was unexpected ballad ""Soon Enough"". That track was an ode to finding fulfillment by merely living up to the responsibilities of adulthood; after all their former bluster, the introspection and maturity felt fully inhabited and earned. Now, however: Are you ready for nearly an entire album of that? Well, almost a whole album: Opener ""Hard Feelings"" is as muscular and flailing as anything in the Constantines' catalog, but given the rest of the record, it seems like a capitulation to their old selves. The chorus of ""Million Star Hotel"" is slow and blustery, as if the band's jagged edges have been sanded off. ""Trans Canada"" starts with a keyboard pulse that's half train whistle, half trance anthem but its insistent chug leads to a full-band climax and the record's heaviest moment. Singer Bryan Webb has said ""Trans Canada"" was torn apart and rebuilt from scratch, and it reflects that, standing a few yards astride of the Kensington Heights' uniform tone while hitting the album's emotional peak. And while ""Our Age"" also nails a note of yearning, thanks to its stately melody and Webb's growth as a vocalist, the rest of the album seems weary and resigned. Even at their fiercest, Constantines sounded liked bruised and battered romantics, so a slower, more world-weary album is a natural-- but maybe too comfortable-- choice. Though there's still some traces of pride and defiance to be found here, like on the weeping guitar bends of the simmering ""Time Can Be Overcome"", the second side of the record is especially troubling. ""Credit River"" is a jump (and face-plant) into topical waters where Webb sounds nearly too bored to finish the chorus and keyboardist Will Kidman, who added so much to earlier songs, smothers the track in gaudy, dated effects. Just as jarring is the album's closer, which marries manufactured catharsis with shrugging bathroom-wall slogans. Webb's glass-gargling voice can make him sound like the mouthpiece of the disenfranchised, but on ""Do What You Can Do"" he can't muster up anything insightful. Maybe Constantines aren't just tired, but mortally afraid-- the specter of death that lingers over the city doctor of ""Million Star Hotel"" spreads to hospital rooms in the rootsier ""Brother Run Them Down""-- but without any of ""Hotel""'s tension. In the face of that mortality, Webb offers a cold shoulder to banner-waving and perpetual youth: ""You are not your generation."" No doubt that the best halves of this and Tournament of Hearts would equal a breakthrough album for the group, but taken as a whole, Kensington Heights sounds like a decisive break in the band's stride. What lingers after it's done, if not the songs, is how comfortably the group has slid into this lower gear.","A more introspective and mature-sounding Constantines rebound on their fourth album and first for Canadian indie label Arts & Crafts.

Rising Down,The Roots,by: Nate Patrin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b5ec13d197565213ad48/1:1/w_160/335e5ebd.jpg,2008-04-29 05:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11458-rising-down/,Def Jam,"It's gotten to the point where I can't even imagine the Roots being soft anymore. Not to be dismissive of their first few albums, which were thoughtful without being mushy or maudlin, but their three recent records-- the underrated/overhated alleged-sellout The Tipping Point, the Def Jam-released tightly knit return to rawness Game Theory, and now Rising Down-- are so singularly focused on a kind of distilled, uninhibited force that it's now difficult to think of the Roots as anything but intelligently aggressive firebrands. You don't throw on these albums if you want to chill out, and Rising Down does more than any of them to express, precisely and without compromise, a specifically African-American but increasingly universal strain of anxiety and frustration. A lot of Rising Down's urgency and immediacy owes to the massive guest roster. The Roots' Philly core of affiliates-- vets Dice Raw, Peedi Peedi, and Truck North, former member Malik B., and relative newcomer/search engine nightmare P.O.R.N.-- appear on more than half the record's songs, and they help give the record a sense of a communal strength in numbers; their appearances on vicious throwdown ""Get Busy"" (with the some deft cuts from Philly's legendary DJ Jazzy Jeff) and a stretch of tracks in the middle (""I Will Not Apologize"", ""I Can't Help It"", and ""Singing Man"") feel like the spiritual and lyrical core of the album. The guests from outside Philly work just as well: Talib Kweli spits with an atypically growly delivery on the anti-defeatist anthem ""Lost Desire"", Common displays glimpses of his late-1990s shine ruminating over tour fatigue on ""The Show"", Wale kills it with some so-corny-they're-great metaphors (""good rappers ain't eatin', they Olsen twinnin'"") on ""Rising Up"", and Saigon's final verse on ""Criminal"" is the fierce peak of a three-MC slow lyrical burn. And while Styles P's turn on the title track works well enough (it's something to hear the dude behind ""Good Times [I Get High]"" go after the pharmaceutical industry), Mos Def's verse-- the first one on the whole record-- is one of the best he's ever done, and probably the best guest spot on Rising Down: ""Identities in crisis and conflict diamonds/ Blindin', staring at lights till they cryin'/ Bone gristle popping from continuous grindin'."" But despite the massive ensemble cast, Black Thought is still the core of the record and the well-worn accusations of him being anti-charismatic feel largely false here. Most of his great moments come on tracks which feature a lot of other MCs' great moments, and after getting overshadowed on ""Rising Down"" (can any MC make the subject of global warming into a dope lyric?) he comes out swinging for the rest of the record. On ""Singing Man"", even with P.O.R.N. portraying himself as a vividly realized school shooter and Truck North putting together a disturbingly evocative characterization of a suicide bomber, Black Thought's depiction of an African child soldier justifying his violence (""13 year-old killer, he look 35/ He changed his name to Little No Man Survive"") is both sharply written and unsettling. His delivery is a bit more varied than you might expect, too, particularly when he's rapping about getting underpaid like he's got a clenched jaw in ""I Will Not Apologize"" or sweating his way through a pills-and-stress panic attack on ""I Can't Help It"". And when he's turned loose on a hookless lyrical exhibition, Black Thought is nearly unstoppable; it's scary the way he blazes through the one-take assault of ""75 Bars (Black's Reconstruction)"", throwing out endless Big Daddy Kane-level proclamations of untouchability (""My hustle is long, my muscle is strong, my man put the paper in the duffel I'm gone/ Y'all still a light year from the level I'm on/ Just a pawn stepping right into the head of the storm""). The abrupt way it ends, it sounds like he could've gone on full throttle for another two hundred bars if someone hadn't taken a cleaver to the tape reel. A revamped production style accompanies the deeper, darker lyrical tone, taking the aesthetic of Game Theory to its grimiest conclusion. Most of Kamal's keyboard work here isn't with the archetypal Fender Rhodes of Roots albums past; he's using a number of grimy analog synths that snarl and spit and hiss, the kind you hear in dead prez's ""Hip Hop"" or Outkast's ""Stanklove"" (or the J.B.'s' ""Blow Your Head"", for that matter). That racket combining with ?uestlove's fierce, crisp percussion makes for some diabolical rhythmic low-end, and since it dominates Rising Down's personality it gives the album the feeling of being this bionic monstrosity that just so happens to have a lot of headknock to it. There are a couple of exceptions, like the guitar-driven midtempo Fela pastiche of ""I Will Not Apologize"" and the unexpected country-blues tinge to ""Criminal"", but they're rare breathers in an album that otherwise closes in on you. Only when the triumphant, old-school Roots return on the demi-go-go of ""Rising Up"" does it feel like the weight's been lifted, and even then something about it-- the endless Oprah/Travolta namedrop hook, the mawkish Chrisette Michele vocal about a crying b-girl, the overly tidy-sounding keyboards-- seems a bit out of place. (Maybe not as out-of-place as the now-infamous and super-creepy Patrick Stump collab ""Birthday Girl"", however; excising that disaster singlehandedly saved the album's character.) Rising Down isn't always an easy listen, but it's an exciting one, and its abrasiveness never gets in the way of a good throw-your-hands-up beat or a well-crafted lyric. If you've been paying any damn attention to the world around you, most of Rising Down's messages ring familiar, and frequently true: This is an album that tells you the entertainment industry is turning into a coon show, the climate (both environmental and cultural) is getting fucked up, and broke people are still struggling. But this record states these ideas with respect to the notion that you know them already, and puts all the revelation and subtext into its unyielding sound. You could call it preaching to the converted, but it also feels like a reminder to the lapsed, less a wake-up call than a shot of renewed adrenaline.","The Roots follow their tightly-knit return to rawness Game Theory with another record that finds them coming across as intelligently aggressive firebrands, as they express precisely and without compromise an increasingly universal strain of anxiety and frustration

Station,Russian Circles,by: Cosmo Lee,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b5ce9d034d5c69bf50ad/1:1/w_160/7345117b.jpg,2008-04-28 06:00:04,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11432-station/,Suicide Squeeze,"Genre names are often as lazy and reductive as those who use them. Post-rock, in particular, is now so abused and misused that it somehow covers Tortoise, Stereolab, Mogwai, and Mono. In the 90s, the term originally described rock's subversion through its own tools. Thus, guitars didn't have to rock or define riffs. Vocals, if present, weren't the focus. Songs didn't rely on verses and choruses. Over time, this open system became a closed one. Now post-rock is very much defined: instrumental rock with long songs. If it's heavier, then the equally unhelpful ""post-metal"" applies. Destruction of rock's template has only created another one; now hordes of sound- and look-alikes have ditched vocals and grown beards. Still, variations exist, and Russian Circles have a distinctive one. This Chicago trio is more compact and disciplined than its peers. Whereas Mogwai are spiky and slightly oblique, Mono are purple-hearted and passionate, and Explosions in the Sky muck about in major key clouds, Russian Circles are efficiently precise. Clean tones ring cleanly, but so do the dirty ones. The band is also willing to be overtly metal; riffs march with military precision. Even sheets of sound are carefully painted, in contrast to, say, Mono's walls of weeping. This tautness of delivery suggests another ""post"": post-punk. In fact, guitarist Mike Sullivan's palette resembles that of U2's the Edge, but with an Isis fetish. Such economy of motion yields stark beauty. Sullivan favors hypnotic, clean-toned ostinatos reminiscent of Pink Floyd. In ""Youngblood"", they're ominous; in ""Campaign"", they're winsome. Even when distorted, these repeating figures are still tender. ""Harper Lewis"" unfurls melodic spirals that recall prog-surfers the Mermen. The organ-lit ""Xavii"" is practically Mazzy Star. ""Verses"" takes the chord progression of ""With or Without You"", kicks out Bono, and erects a gleaming church. Amid peers fond of obfuscation, such nakedness is startling. It's also sleek, and a little cold. The rolling 6/8 of ""Station"" is essentially Viking metal, evoking raised fists and frostbitten beards. Sullivan's riffing is vigorous, but as the only guitarist, that's all he can do. The riffs beg for vocals, melodies, some sort of top layer; instead they're just a robust foundation. ""Harper Lewis"", too, is ripe for counterpoint, but instead presents melodies linearly. The result feels muzzled. Songs hint at going over-the-top, but they never do. This can be tasteful, of course; the drumming in ""Station"" is astonishingly tasty. But if songs beg for vocals, they're no longer post-rock, but rock. Post-rock's forte is letting instruments speak for vocals. Russian Circles speak articulately, but could stand to roar a bit.","This Chicago trio, more compact and disciplined than most of its instrumental rock peers, offers this efficient, precise Suicide Squeeze release.

"Hello, Voyager",Evangelista,by: Adam Moerder,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b581ea9e61561daa6e0c/1:1/w_160/1cbe9ea1.jpg,2008-04-28 06:00:03,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11360-hello-voyager/,Constellation,"At this point in Carla Bozulich's career, an album stewing in this much unrefined emotional sludge is pretty surprising. Then again, with a résumé as expansive and convoluted as Bozulich's, there's little use in trying to plot out her next logical step, let alone identify what sort of creative stage, if any, you can consider her in right now. In a little over a quarter century, Bozulich's dabbled in such areas as industrial (Ethyl Meatplow), alt-country (the Geraldine Fibbers, Scarnella), elaborate performance art, and, on the 2003 re-imagining of Red Headed Stranger, even Willie Nelson. So, an avant-garde blues/metal/classical album dripping with bloody catharsis? Sure, why not? ""Here's to St. Anne, who's gone mad"" sings Bozulich on the nearly a-rhythmic opener ""Winds of St. Anne"". On Hello, Voyager, Bozulich mines more from her 2006 solo album Evangelista than a new name for her new band. Voyager further explores the omnipresent female dementia of Evangelista, this time with an even fuller sound and an increasingly tortured performance from Bozulich. Nearly every track here occupies its own realm, tenuously connected by Bozulich's vocals or similar string arrangements but otherwise completely alien to each other. Nothing demonstrates this better than the cold shower effect of ""The Frozen Dress"", a post-rock instrumental wasteland, coming after the blistering two-minute stoner metal of de facto single ""Truth is Dark Like Outer Space"". As the only American artist on Montreal label Constellation, Bozulich introduces touches of country and blues to the label's signature apocalyptic symphonies. Considering the popularity of Jonny Greenwood's recent There Will Be Blood score, there's probably no better time than now to juxtapose a grimy blues ballad like ""Lucky Lucky Luck"" with the chillingly out-of-tune violins of ""For the L'il Dudes"". However, Voyager doesn't simply run its listeners through a gauntlet of extremes. Bozulich provides flashes of her inner country songwriter, particularly on the surprisingly tender ""The Blue Room"". With a lead guitar imitating a dusty old music box, Bozulich herself waxes equally delicate, at least in comparison to Voyager's darker, tortured narratives: ""So I fold you like a dead poem/ And stick you in a teacup/ With a crack in the broke-off handle."" Despite these eclectic tracks, Bozulich doesn't just genre-surf for pleasure. Voyager gradually deposits its bitterness into the final two tracks, the epically bleak dirge ""Paper Kitten Claw"" and the title track, a twelve-minute evangelical tirade from hell. The latter in particular stands as the most memorable track here, even if its discombobulated cymbal crashes and call-and-response preaching would hit harder as live performance art. Of course, Evangelista make it pretty clear from the get-go that their artistic aims are not solely focused on recording songs in a studio. Rife with suspense, drama, and a grisly cast of characters, Voyager's probably more likely to ignite your inner playwright than get your foot tapping, but it's still a cathartic rush all the same.","Naming her new band after the title of her last solo album, Carla Bozulich returns with an avant-garde blues/metal/classical hybrid dripping with bloody catharsis.

Hard Candy,Madonna,by: Tom Ewing,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b5e69d034d5c69bf50d7/1:1/w_160/8df039ba.jpg,2008-04-28 06:00:02,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11453-hard-candy/,Warner Bros.,"Madonna is coming home: Having spent a decade working with producers drawn from European club culture, Hard Candy is her link-up with the American men who've come to define global pop. Five songs with Timbaland and Justin Timberlake, six with Pharrell Williams, one with Williams and Kanye West. The best, this line-up announces, need to work with the best. But lead single ""4 Minutes"" doesn't sound like the best working with the best: It sounds complacent, like a pop supergroup high-fivin' each other. The ""4 Minutes"" marching band rhythm-riff may be Timbaland's strongest idea on the album but the performers seem happy to let it do the work. He keeps shouting for ""Mad-DON-nuh!"" but she's a guest on her own track, singing from the margins of what might as well be a Timberlake outtake. Timbaland's productions are the weaker links on this frustratingly ordinary album. Partly he's a victim of his own ubiquity-- we know his tricks by now: the interlocking rhythmic hooks on his upbeat tracks, the bubbling claustrophobia on his ballads. ""Devil Wouldn't Recognise You"" is the third time-- at least-- that he's written ""Cry Me a River"", right down to the moody rainstorm breakdown and thunderclaps. But his less-typical productions don't all work well here either: ""Dance 2Night"" aspires to 80s funk slickness but lumbers where it should cruise. The 1980s, specifically Madonna's 80s, haunt Hard Candy: It's been touted as a return to the spirit and sound of her earliest work, but her voice and delivery have changed too much for the comparison to hold. Her vocal training and singing lessons in the 90s broadened her range but she's never sounded as hungry since, and her phrasing on Hard Candy is frequently dreadful-- words so evenly spaced and emphasized that it sounds like she's reading aloud to a class. Or teaching you the choruses: You won't get ""Miles Away"" out of your head in a hurry but that's less to do with its quality than the didactic way she delivers it. Her biggest misstep is ""Heartbeat""-- lyrics deliberately reminiscent of ""Into the Groove"" but sung so detached you might as well be at a Madonna Studies lecture. The record's better tracks are, unsurprisingly, those where Madonna sounds more engaged. Second single ""Give It to Me"" has her delivering an imperious lesson on success and survival-- ""Show me a record and I'll break it/ I can go on and on""-- over Hard Candy's most urgent tune, hard-pushing electro-ska whose keyboards break up trying to keep pace. Closing track ""Voices"" is gorgeously gothic orchestral synth-pop that she seems to relax and revel in. Centerpiece ""She's Not Me"" is a stirring piece of turf-defense, prowling between Chic-era disco and modern pop-house as Madonna slaps down a rival. It's taut and cold, easily Hard Candy's most emotionally compelling moment. ""She's Not Me"" smoothly lays out Madonna's credentials: Twenty-five years at the top of the game. She doesn't reinvent pop; she defines it. Her strengths have always been her authority, and her smart sense of who to work with and when. So even if it's a summary of where pop's at rather than where it's going, Hard Candy should still be excellent. After all, if you're not going to do your best work for Madonna, who are you going to do it for? But after listening, the question's still open-- nobody involved in Hard Candy is anywhere near their creative peak.","Having spent a decade working with producers drawn from European club culture, Hard Candy is Madonna's link-up with the American men who've come to define global pop, including Timbaland, the Neptunes, Kanye West, and Justin Timberlake.

Third,Portishead,by: Nate Patrin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b5d69d034d5c69bf50b9/1:1/w_160/aeec45fc.jpg,2008-04-28 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11438-third/,IslandMercury,"Can an album really be a departure if it's the first thing a group's released in 11 years? It ideally would be for a genre-bound band turned brand name like Portishead: As much as there is to miss about the mid-late 1990s, the time for any trip-hop revival is far into the future, and picking up right where they left off in 1997 would make Portishead some kind of sad cipher coasting on the fumes of an exhausted trend-- something they've always been above. If the voice of Beth Gibbons wasn't so ingrained in the consciousness of a whole generation of indie kids, you could look at Third as a sort of re-debut; it posits that the sound of Portishead can actually exist even after the group excises every possible remnant of trip-hop from it. As radical reinventions go, Third is surprisingly natural. You can credit Gibbons as the familiarizing factor: She possesses a voice that seems impossible to shackle to just one musical setting, even if it already sounds perfectly at home in brooding downtempo ambience. As the most recognizable component of the group, she has the most established stylistic tendencies-- subtle quivers, an ability to go from hushed to piercing without laboring over the transition, an aching timbre that expresses anxious vulnerability better than nearly any other singer-- and she slips back into them comfortably when she needs to. But it's also a style that works in more contexts than we've previously heard, something she hinted at with Rustin Man on 2002's folk and jazz-influenced Out of Season, and Third is the culmination of this. Pitted against the jarring mechanical stop-starts of first single ""Machine Gun"" or the chase-scene-paced opener ""Silence"", Gibbons sounds like both a defiant accuser and someone clinging on for dear life. Quieter numbers, like the slow-build electronic ballad ""The Rip"" or the softer moments of the cabaret highwire act ""Hunter"", highlight the fragility in her voice. And since almost every song on Third addresses some sort of emotional or mental helplessness-- typically a deep and profound sense of loss and isolation-- it's almost as though this shift in sonic identity is there to mask the fact that this is an incredibly bleak record lyrically. Gibbons' wounded tone can take commonplace-on-paper sentiments (""I'd like to laugh at what you said but I just can't find a smile""; ""I can't deny what I've become/ I'm just emotionally undone"") and give them a kind of pathos that's almost uncomfortably voyeuristic to listen to. As for how the music itself has changed, long story short: Third is a psychedelic rock album. It opens with a rhythm that's nearly twice as fast as almost everything else Portishead have done, the percussion on most of the songs is frequently muffled or buried under layers of noise and sometimes just stops short of being non-existent (though it's heavy and propulsive when it does make itself known), and their keyboards and strings have graduated from relaxed tension into dissonant rumbles and shrieks. There's a brief acoustic folk song (""Deep Water""), an abrasive and jittery electro-industrial number (""Machine Gun""), free jazz horns (""Magic Doors""), analog freakouts from the United States of America-fueled early days of electronic psych (""The Rip""), and a song that sounds a bit like Clinic's droning, rhythmically dense garage-kraut, except somehow spookier (""We Carry On""). Portishead as you previously knew them are represented, barely, by the last song on the album-- the sleepwalk-paced, David Axelrod-esque ""Threads""-- and even then, its intermittently fuzzed-out tension-and-release dynamic would've made it one of the harshest-sounding songs on Dummy or Portishead. You could say that this would be unrecognizable as a Portishead album without Gibbons' voice, and you'd be sort of right; guitarist and contributing songwriter Adrian Utley mentioned in a recent New York Times article that one of the rules they set for Third was that they couldn't fall back on any instruments-- or even any trademark sounds-- that they'd used on previous albums. But their style here isn't particularly out of character, comparatively experimental as it is; Utley's guitar still twangs sharply when it's not doing things like interjecting ""Iron Man"" growls in ""Hunter"" or splintering into Syd Barrett-isms at the coda of ""Small"", and the melodic identity that he and Geoff Barrow built on a foundation of minor keys and sinister grandeur still holds sway. In the terms of a group that was frequently lumped in with film composers as much as Bristol axis peers, Portishead's Euro-cool John Barry intrigue has been pushed into the disquieting territory of John Carpenter's compositions and Bernard Herrmann's Alfred Hitchcock scores. Keep in mind just how out-of-nowhere this all seems: The notion of a new Portishead album had, for many fans, fallen out of the realm of possibility. If Third had come out in 1999 or 2000, maybe writers would be calling it Portishead's answer to Massive Attack's Mezzanine, another third album by trip-hop icons eschewing dinner-conversation music by embracing anxiety and moodiness. Released today, it instead feels like a staggering transformation and a return to form that was never lost, an ideal adaptation by a group that many people didn't know they needed to hear again.","As radical reinventions go, Third-- the first Portishead studio album since 1997-- is surprisingly natural. Darker and bleaker lyrically than their previous work, Third is a sort of re-debut-- the band's sound after it has excised every possible remnant of trip-hop from it.

You Are Here,South,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a20413d1975652138781/1:1/w_160/8e7409f7.jpg,2008-04-28 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11371-you-are-here/,Bluhammock Music,"Yeah, this band's got a Google-hostility unseen since the Music called it a day, so it takes a bit of crafty sleuthing to find the following on South's MySpace page: ""We've never been the sort to jump on a bandwagon and start writing Snow patrol (sic) or Keane type ballads to sell more records. Our souls just wouldn't allow us. The South way has always been to push boundaries and never record the same record twice."" They certainly have the truth on their side: With a subtle individuality, each of their previous four albums were more likely to explore sonic texture than mawkish sentiment, but you have to wonder whether the above statement is borne of stubbornness, pride or denial, considering they're responsible for one of my most awkward concert experiences-- at a 2004 show in Athens, Ga., they got blown off the stage by an exponentially more energetic Metric and then proceeded to limp through their set in front of what couldn't have been more than two dozen Anglo diehards or alcoholics. Mind you, this was after ""Paint The Silence"" was prominently featured on ""The O.C."", so I'm not sure if these guys really have the moral high ground. South still can't find their compass-- You Are Here, despite being titled in a manner of directional certainty, mostly evokes the momentary disorientation of seeing said phrase on a mall map. It's easily their most raw and direct work to date, but that's a relative concept for guys who've shared studio time with James Lavelle and Dave Eringa. Crispy acoustic numbers like ""The Creeping"" and ""Better Things"" won't be confused for Bon Iver, but in the past, they'd likely be dripping in synth pad strings or two additional minutes of breakbeats. And yet, it's also South's most sonically damaged album as well, often inspiring double and triple-checks of the credits to make sure Dave Fridmann wasn't involved. He's not, so the next best guess is that you've received an unfinished demo, as most of their tricks sound like the work of my high school garage band buying its first digital recorder-- a deluge of ideas, way too much technology, and no idea how to use it. Even though the EQing here often has these poor guys sounding like they're pressed against a Plexiglas ceiling (the bass guitar might as well be a timpani), vocalist Joel Cadbury is the big loser in all of this; he's never been the most distinctive singer, sort of an Ian Brown with additional shades of beige. But attempts to bedeck his papery tone with color ends up in boundless self-sabotage. ""Wasted"" and ""Opened Up"" are occasionally gorgeous, featuring the sort of chiming delay notes, capo-ed strumming, and crunchy percussion that evokes top-shelf Travis. Yet, on the former, Cadbury is lashed by a sour flange effect that renders the verses meaningless. The latter reverses, as it's the chorus that sounds like the band's been transported to a studio trapped inside a steaming tea kettle. ""She's Half Crazy"" is all mess, with Cadbury either swimming in some backmasked brine or trying to play catch up while the rest of the guys try out a sort of playful, funk groove that proves South do neither playful nor funk. If it seems like I'm harping on the production too much, there's a reason-- South have always been more of a cipher than anything, a sort of blank slate where engineers can try out their more outré ideas without having any sort of bold melody or strong lyrical gambit get in the way (think of a British answer to Wheat). The latter's not so much of a problem, as Cadbury rarely speaks in something other than placeholder or platitude, which might be for the best, considering that ""Lonely Highs"", the most topical moment of You Are Here, ends up one of the lamest anti-drug PSAs since Jimmy Eat World's ""Drugs or Me"". But the insouciant ""Better Things"" (salvaged from 1999's obscure Overused) manages to do mushy properly (""the better things look forward to you""), as well as ""Every Light Has Blown"", which practically flicks its own Bic with lines like ""I'll do my best to keep you safe."" Get the hint? You Are Here ironically reaches its peaks as South lunges towards the very influences they claim to so conscientiously avoid, meaning this whole thing might not be a problem of production so much as projection. South may be worried about selling out, but in the process, they're selling themselves short.",,4.8,
Shots,Ladyhawk,by: Andrew Gaerig,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b5865e6ef959693227a6/1:1/w_160/e192f25b.jpg,2008-04-25 05:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11365-shots/,Jagjaguwar,"""I Don't Always Know What You're Saying"", the first track on Ladyhawk's sophomore album, Shots, opens with a pot-banging guitar riff and a cascading, swooping noise whose origins-- effected guitar? synth?-- are indeterminate. Fitting with its title, the song offers what are possibly the only moments of uncertainty, sonically or emotionally, on the entire album. Shots, befitting Ladyhawk's reputation, is no-frills guitar rock that takes clear stances on relationships (confusing!) and guitars (good!). Still, it's hard to put the Vancouver quartet in a box: Ladyhawk look the part of brawny Americana rock revivalists, but at no point does Shots fulfill even the most liberal stylistic requirements of folk or blues or country. There's too much jaunt and bounce for proper hard rock; power-pop might work if the whole thing weren't so…turgid. Grunge-- and, make no mistake, not ""neo-grunge"" nor ""post-grunge"" nor ""ironic-grunge""-- probably best encapsulates the band's over-arching sort-of-ness. Talking about what Ladyhawk are is a lot less interesting that discussing what holds them back: namely, their proclivity for Paul Bunyan-big, capital-R rock moments, with solos and crashing cymbals and howled vocals, or, more specifically, their need to tether those moments to their slowest and clumsiest songcraft. Shots opens with a trio of pop-rockers of such propulsion and grit that best-case-scenario thoughts start popping up: holy hell Ladyhawk might be Sugar! At their best, Ladyhawk share Sugar's penchant for crafting hooks around vanilla sentiment; that ""Fear""'s chorus is inescapable hardly lends any extra weight to frontman Duffy Driediger's refrain, ""I just wanna feel something other than fear/ I don't wanna go back but I can't stay here."" The unfortunately brief ""S.T.H.D."" might've been a sneak preview of the new Wolf Parade album but Driediger never lets the melody jerk out of his jaw, so it stays the best two minutes of 1980s punk Ladyhawk have ever put to tape. This familiarity, weirdly enough, breeds excitement: we know Ladyhawk are not new, but they might yet be a welcome brand of old. After the surprising opening salvo, however, Shots clumsily bogs down in its desire to be big and rocking, even though any time Ladyhawk can be bothered to push the tempo-- the latter moments of ""(I'll Be Your) Ashtray"", the once again too short ""You Ran""-- they gnash and spit gloriously. As for the rest of it: no thanks on the yawn-y ""Corpse Paint"" and the woebegone lyricism of ""Faces of Death"" (""There's no such thing as endless love/ Only a joke told in very poor taste/ That somehow keeps cracking me up""). Driediger has an unfortunate knack for these blocky, teenage phrases; the big poetic moment of ""Ashtray"" goes as follows: ""I'll be your ashtray/ If you need me/ ‘Cause I only wanna feel you burnin'."" Then there's closer ""Ghost Blues"", functionally no different from any other Ladyhawk song save for the fact that it is 10 minutes long and features a handful of guitar solos. Ladyhawk's not the first band to backload an album with an epic or two, but ""Ghost Blues""' random appointment as such leads to the uncomfortable notion that by me having written this review and you having read it, we have both thought harder about Ladyhawk's art than Ladyhawk. Perhaps Shots needs to be interpreted not as violent outbursts but rather as uncertain scatter: attempts. Ladyhawk aim squarely for the middle-– at least the middle of muscular guitar rock-– but they find plenty of potholes to make the ride seem bumpy. Shots is like any stretch of pocked road, though: the smoothest stretches are the shortest.","Second album from Vancouver band shows a proclivity for Paul Bunyan-big, capital-R rock moments, with solos and crashing cymbals and howled vocals.

Jane Doe Loves Me,Experimental Dental School,by: Mike Orme,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b5cd5e6ef95969322823/1:1/w_160/c0fcd5d9.jpg,2008-04-25 05:00:03,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11431-jane-doe-loves-me/,Cochon,"For those of you curious about the name, I'll spare you the suspense: listening to Experimental Dental School is indeed kind of like pulling teeth. That's not a 25-word dismissal, however: XDS revel in the difficult, the turgid, the painful. They've been called dance rock, but that isn't quite the right term for this Oakland trio-- ""shake rock"" might be more appropriate for their new album Jane Doe Loves Me, or maybe ""seizure rock."" Chaotic, constantly shifting rhythms teeter around, punctuated by furious organ lines, machine-gun samples, stutter-start flares from Jesse Hall's custom ""guitar-o-bass,"" and gleefully shouted lyrical one-liners. Ryan Brundage's drum fiery drum work keeps the band on pace through their many time-signature shifts, bouncing from 4/4 to 3/4 to 12/8 to 13/8 with the fluidity of the hard prog the band seems to idolize. The group skittered to a start, releasing Hideous Dance Attack!!!, also aptly-named, in 2003. Moving at a breakneck pace, Attack!!! took a page from fellow cross-Bay San Francisco contemporaries Deerhoof, except where Deerhoof make delicate use of space between instruments in the mix, XDS fill that space with a cacophony of furiously plonked organ riffs and busy drum fills. Jane Doe Loves Me is the group's third album and its most varied. The band's MySpace claims they spent 10 times on the album than on their previous two, and at times it shows. ""Whale Drone"" combines the jarring psychedelia of other conceptual cousins, Oneida and Captain Beefheart, with a buzzing duo of guitar-o-bass lines intertwining with a festive, swinging drumbeat. ""Uh Huh – Na Uh"" might even sound like a catchy psych-pop ballad, if it weren't for the synthesized screech bubbling under Horikawa's vocals. But too often, their offbeat identity gets the better of them. The grating juxtaposition of Horikawa's high-pitched organ with Hall's muddy guitar regularly dissolves into a messy homogeny, with only the aforementioned changes of pace acting as delimiters. All those rhythm changes and noises sound more busy than complex. Listeners can often take or leave music of XDS's ilk while appreciating its merits, but good noisy rock sounds aggressive without fronting like it's trying to be noisy. Certainly Deerhoof and their obtuse compositions have earned a fair-sized audience. At their best (as on the opener ""Jane Doe Loves Me""), Experimental Dental School make use of every weapon in their varied arsenal but bring a sort of sonic order from the mined battlefield of the mixing board. But more often, XDS always seem to teeter between the abyss of random noise for noise's sake, and the relative safety of tight, visceral aggression. Their inability to meld the two in more convincing fashion makes them far more attractive in concept than on the stereo.","The third release from this convulsive Oakland noise rock trio finds them getting out from the shadow of their more serene Bay Area contemporaries Deerhoof, tempering their frantic prog-punk at times with more streamlined dissonance.

If Children,Wye Oak,by: Mike Powell,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b5ccea9e61561daa6e78/1:1/w_160/026af70d.jpg,2008-04-25 05:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11430-if-children/,MergeMorphiusMergeMorphius,"There's historical poetry-- and plain shoe-fitting sense-- to Merge's rerelease of Wye Oak's 2007 debut, If Children. The band, a male-female duo from Baltimore, both in their early 20s, is like a Merge incarnate birthed 10 years late: mixed-sex; Mid-Atlantic; pretty without sounding porcelain. Their sound-- earnest folk-influenced indie rock with touches of noise and dream-pop-- is so second-nature that nobody realizes it's actually endangered. In 1995, If Children would've been vernacular, slotting on modern-rock radio next to Belly or sellable Dinosaur Jr.; in 2008, it flashes like lost slang. That's not to say If Children earns stripes from nostalgia. It doesn't. But it is refreshing that, in an era where the most promising indie rock bands operate through self-consciousness, flair, and fashion (LCD Soundsystem; modern Merge cash cows Spoon and Arcade Fire) or the equally hip pretense of eschewing those things (Animal Collective), Jenn Wasner and Andy Stack remove themselves from the discourse entirely. They aren't fashionable or sexy, but don't wear humility for a pity vote; they're earnest without expecting a pat on the back for it. If Children blends together in concept, but displays a band that knows how to vary a theme just enough to keep momentum: the restrained, porch-lit fingerpicking of ""Please Concrete"" gives way to cosmopolitan poses of free-jazzy squall; later, gliding Asian-sounding pentatonic runs on a piano during ""Keeping Company"" transition to the country-ish ""A Lawn to Mow"". Vocals trade between Wasner and Stack; her voice bears more sweetness, but the light variety is a palette cleanser. Their total defiance of novelty is almost minimalistic; it's a reminder that someone who understands food can make a good dish with three or four ingredients. Wye Oak isn't gripping song after song-- too uncouth, too flashy-- but moments on If Children are superlative. ""Warning"" is a collision of momentums, the inherent slowness of guitar atmosphere with drums sputtering out from a garage-rock song. The catch is that Wasner and Stack actually sound comfortable in both modes; their fuzz convincingly dizzy, their inertia reckless. A humble rollercoaster. I might even prefer the grandeur of ""I Don't Feel Young"", which foams to actual noise without losing any sweetness; the Byrds without acid or English shoegaze without the suggestion of French kissing. At the heart of both songs is bulletproof innocence. But Wye Oak aren't separatists or daydreamers; they're absolutely uncute. When Wasner sings ""I don't feel young, I don't feel scared"" she sounds saucer-eyed and terrified; when Stack joins her at the song's climax on the lines ""If you feel young and feel ready/ Or if you feel old...You know your secret's safe with me,"" their appeal to inclusion is wise enough to heed and comforting enough to cry into; when, on ""Warning"", she confides, ""The only hell I'll ever know is when you may go and I may not go,"" she doesn't flinch. It's not an appeal to be pet, it's a glass of water in the face, honesty so undramatized it's hard to imagine, at the moment, another band so achingly stupid, so brave at heart.","Merge re-introduces a band whose sound-- earnest folk-influenced indie rock with touches of noise and dream-pop-- is so second-nature that nobody realizes it's actually endangered.

Forever Changes [Collector's Edition],Love,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b5cab1335d7bf169a968/1:1/w_160/35a2ce71.jpg,2008-04-25 05:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11429-forever-changes-collectors-edition/,ElektraRhinoElektraRhino,"If I were reviewing only the original material that forms the basis of this Collector's Edition of Love's Forever Changes, I'd certainly give it a 10.0 and praise it in the most glowing terms possible. Such as: Fuck the Doors. This is the truer sound of late-1960s Los Angeles, which was neither a trippy paradise nor a Lizard Kingdom, but a purgatory characterized by paranoia and grievance. Already veterans of the local scene when they released their third and best album, Love captured the city in all its grizzled glory on Forever Changes-- or, rather, Arthur Lee did. A charismatic black singer/songwriter in a mixed-race band but a generally white scene, he had soured on the hippies and sunshine mentality, and instead saw the Vietnam War, his friends' drug addictions, and the end of the world. Sequestered in a house high in the Hollywood hills, he could look down at the city below and nurse a curious dread. Eventually, he became convinced that his death was looming and that Forever Changes would be his final statement to the world. So he became a rank perfectionist, expressing all his unhappiness, fear, blame, and hope not only in his dark, discomfiting lyrics, but in the music itself, which draws from rock, pyschedelia, folk, pop, classical, and even mariachi. Ultimately, the album belongs to none of those genres. That's certainly a compelling story, but it also points to a larger anti-story, one specifically bound to Los Angeles during the late 1960s. In her essay ""The White Album"", Joan Didion experienced a similar detachment from the world around her, piecing together fragments of scenes with the Doors, an interview with Manson girl Linda Kasabian, transcripts from the Ferguson brothers murder trial, and vivid descriptions of her own brittle mental state. *""*I was supposed to have a script, and had mislaid it,"" she writes. ""I was supposed to hear cues, and no longer did. I was meant to know the plot, but all I knew was what I saw: flash pictures in variable sequence, images with no 'meaning' beyond their temporary arrangement, not a movie but a cutting-room experience."" Forever Changes is similarly a thicket of tangled story threads, which of course shows in Lee's lyrics. Has rock music produced a stranger, more alarming cry for help than ""Sitting on a hillside, watching all the people die/ I'll feel much better on the other side""? Lee sings those lyrics on ""The Red Telephone"", and the calm in his voice, the matter-of-factness with which he delivers those lines, makes them the more worrisome. Lee's faltering grasp on any overriding narrative, however, comes through more strongly in the shape of the music, which is diverse and logical, but tricky-- full of feints, blind alleys, unusual passages. The traditional structures that served the band so well on its two previous albums (Love even covered Bacharach-David) are jettisoned in favor of more circuitous arrangements like ""A House Is Not a Motel"", which moves linearly, but repeats almost nothing. Even the most direct, lucid songs convey a sense of vague menace, the first sight of the storm out to sea. ""Maybe the People Would Be the Times or Between Clark and Hilldale"", perhaps the catchiest song here, surveys Los Angeles' music scene from Lee's perspective as he seems to bid conspicuous farewells to the venues and audiences. There's an acceptance and perhaps even a relief in his resignation: Listen to Lee sing along with the trumpet solo, his excitement driving and driven by the music. Forever Changes is both context and text, but none of it is academic. It's a rock album and, despite its tangles of meaning, a surprisingly accessible and enduring one. Nevertheless, as amazing as these songs are, this particular edition of Forever Changes is definitive only by default. Its similarities to the 2001 edition suggest an obligatory undertaking, offering few revelations about the album or the musicians who made it. The new liner notes were written by Andrew Sandoval, who produced the previous edition and contributed a short introduction. His access to the band members is valuable (he interviewed Lee many times before the singer's death in 2006), but he seems more interested in detailing the creation of the record than in exploring what it means or why it persists. The bulk of the bonus material consists of an alternate mix of the album, which pushes Lee's vocals to the forefront, deviates occasionally from the well-known stereo version, and generally recalls those Elektra anniversary editions of Love's previous albums. Otherwise, six of the 10 new bonus tracks appear on the original reissue, while one track is noticeably absent. Several are tracking sessions, full of count offs, false starts, and abrupt stops. This is by definition for-fans-only material. The only real discovery is their lackadaisical take on ""Wooly Bully"", which begins and ends so unceremoniously that it sounds wholly improvised, the byproduct of too much downtime in the studio. Of the two, this new edition is superior to the 2001 one if only because it relegates all the bonus material to a separate disc and presents the full album by itself on the first disc. The well-earned valedictory ""You Set the Scene"" closes Forever Changes as intended instead of leading into outtakes. On the other hand, this Collector's Edition lacks the impact of the 2001 version, which rescued the then out-of-print album and introduced it to new legions of listeners. In retrospect, however, timing may have been the most crucial aspect of that release, considering the events of 2001 and the outrage that has simmered since then. Inspired by the 1960s, Forever Changes may actually be the perfect soundtrack to the 2000s, when the stories we tell ourselves in order to live began to make even less sense. To say that Love's music has lost none of its power is beside the point: It has actually gained new gravity, as Lee's paranoia, far from unwarranted, has become frighteningly easy to identify with.","Arthur Lee's paranoia-soaked 1967 masterpiece is again reissued and expanded-- just seven years after its previous rollout.

The Airing of Grievances,Titus Andronicus,by: Adam Moerder,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b4c8ea9e61561daa6cd8/1:1/w_160/6683aa47.jpg,2008-04-25 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11202-the-airing-of-grievances/,Troubleman Unlimited,"Before writing the bulk of his legendary canon of plays and sonnets, William Shakespeare penned the charmingly flawed revenge tragedy Titus Andronicus. Due to its laughable bombast and over-the-top violence, its influence on contemporary culture has emerged mainly in dark comedies like Sweeney Todd or ""South Park"", and many Shakespeare scholars still balk at seriously analyzing the work. Of course, all these factors make the play a perfect moniker for an indie band as violent, overblown, and irreverent as Glen Rock, New Jersey's Titus Andronicus. Despite its title's implied politeness, The Airing of Grievances qualifies more as existentialism wrapped in an anti-suburban screed. Frontman Patrick Stickles howls with anguish way beyond his 22 years, often cramming lyrics into tight spaces just to make sure he gets the last word in. Plus, as anyone who's heard five seconds of this band already knows, he sounds like Conor Oberst screaming from the bowels of hell. However, to peg these guys as ""emo"" would be sadly inaccurate. Sure, torn diary page scribbles clutter Airing's heart-on-sleeve, fist-in-air anthems, but the drama's more Boss than Bright Eyes, fueled by blue collar frustration and, most notably, beer. So far Titus's rowdy live shows have generated the most buzz around the group; check your local listings, they're probably playing in a friend's tool shed near you. Those small venue acoustics translate wonderfully on the band's debut, its muffled mixing reminiscent of listening to a bar band from the men's room. Yet this inebriated aesthetic only intensifies the literary streak running through Stickles' easily excitable veins. A brusque ""fuck you!"" cues the band on Pogues-like opener ""Fear & Loathing in Mahwah, NJ"", but once the rubble clears it's a villainous quote from Titus Andronicus's Aaron the Moor that most elegantly expresses Stickles' bile: ""I have done a thousand dreadful things/ ...And nothing grieves me heartily indeed/ But that I cannot do ten thousand more."" As if the dreary title and playful, mock-optimistic guitar riffs of ""No Future Part II: The Day After No Future"" aren't enough to wrench your soul, the song ends with the closing passage from Albert Camus' The Stranger, in which the narrator wishes to be jeered by a large crowd on the day of his execution. Of course, none of these highfalutin' shout-outs will grab your ear as powerfully as the demonic E Street Band arrangements, rife with constant builds and breakneck rhythms. Nearly every track here starts innocently, usually with a straightforward eighth-note strum or folksy melody unaware of the beating it's about to go through. Whereas a band like Arcade Fire likes to gradually crescendo to enhance the dramatic oomph, Titus can't enjoy that luxury-- not when Stickles is already screaming by the second lyric. Fortunately the band finds unconventional ways to heighten its music, like ""Arms Against Atrophy"", which waits three-quarters of its duration to unveil a killer, song-altering guitar riff, or the outro on ""Upon Viewing Brughel's 'Landscape with the Fall of Icarus'"", when the band corrals a maelstrom of stop-start solos into a steady, almost rockabilly groove. Three-minute war cry ""Titus Andronicus"" best encapsulates Airing's pathos, and serves as a fitting primer for an otherwise hefty and (initially) inscrutable album. Bemoaning the creativity-crushing effects of his environs (""I'll write my masterpiece some other day""), Stickles imagines a conformist nightmare of no sex, no booze, and no cigarettes, blurting ""fuck everything, fuck me"" in between two verses just for effect. As Airing's most memorable moment, the song's taunting chorus maxim ""Your life is over!"" becomes to these guys what ""In the name of love!"" was for early U2. On a lyric sheet, Titus Andronicus may appear to espouse the sort of wrist-cutting histrionics emo's typically lambasted for, but the magic lies in the band's oddly enthusiastic grass roots delivery. They've studied their philosophy and found that life actually is pointless, so why not go down swinging?","Despite its title's implied politeness, The Airing of Grievances qualifies more as existentialism wrapped in an anti-suburban screed from a killer live band whose music is at times violent, overblown, and irreverent.

Ishumar,Toumast,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b57a13d197565213ac8b/1:1/w_160/9ea7d3f5.jpg,2008-04-24 05:00:04,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11354-ishumar/,RealworldRykoVillage Vert,"There's no better sign that a genre has come into its own than its diversification. From an international perspective, Kel Tamashek (aka Tuareg) rock and desert blues is young-- its first exposure outside of the refugee camps and temporary settlements it was born in came only this decade, though musicians had been honing the style since the early 1980s and circulating crudely recorded cassettes. As young as it may seem to the outside world, though, Saharan blues is mature, ready to appropriate further influences and claim more territory. For proof, look no further than Toumast, the latest Tamashek band to go international. Their sound is similar to the desert guitar standard-bearers Tinariwen, but beyond the immediate surface similarity, there's a lot of divergence. Toumast songwriter and guitarist Moussa Ag Keyna and his female cousin Aminatou Goumar formed the group in France, and as one can imagine, living in Paris puts many more sounds at your fingertips than living in the middle of the world's largest desert. Ishumar, named after a term used in West Africa to describe unemployed Kel Tamashek youths (it's a bastardization of the French ""chômeur""), takes the flowing guitars of Tinariwen and spikes them with rock dynamics, funky detours, and even a bit of jazz and hip-hop, all without losing the essence of the music that inspired it. Producer Dan Levy may have something to do with the album's eclectic arrangements as well-- his distinctive bass playing, with lots of melodic phrases, slides, and staccato phrasing, is a huge part of the sound of the record and very different from anything you'd hear on other Tamashek albums. Levy also contributes kit drumming to a few songs, including ""Kik Ayittma"", (""Hey! My Brothers!""), which rises suddenly out of its meditative intro into a driving rock passage full of ragged lead guitar and a dexterous vocal from Moussa. He's singing a call to his fellow Kel Tamashek not to give up the cause of freedom, and it's a political cause he's sacrificed for himself. Moussa was wounded while fighting in the desert during the late-80s/early-90s uprising against the governments of Mali and Niger. His wounds, in fact, are what brought him to Paris. He was forced to give up fighting, but discovered he could aid his cause just as well through music. He and Aminatou, as a duo, can't conjure the same kinds of chants that traditionally deliver the lyrics in their culture's music, but they keep the same spirit, and Aminatou's occasional ululations add a piercing, electrifying accent to certain moments in the music. Together, they balance their musical heritage and their own progressive leanings deftly. Opener ""Ikalane Walegh"" (""These Countries That Are Not Mine"") is a reasonably faithful desert blues tune, with a swaying hand percussion anchor and a pared-down chant, but it saves room for a jazz-inflected sax solo that comes out of nowhere, like a rider over a dune. ""Tallyatidagh"" (""That Girl"") moves from shifting waves of guitar to a startling dance-rock section that seems to nod to Algerian raï. The most thrilling turn into another genre, though, comes on ""Maraou Oran"" (""For Twelve Moons""). It's initially a very good piece of desert blues, with a jumping rhythm and superb guitar/bass interplay, but after three minutes it unexpectedly veers into a fragmented, thumping hip-hop passage-- Moussa actually raps well (in Tamashek). It's a brief burst, but it puts a huge charge into the middle of the song, and it's amazing how naturally the passage fits. Ishumar is but a glimpse at the potential Tamashek guitar music has to mix freely with its counterparts while preserving its unique identity and singularly arresting qualities. In some ways, it's the album that could best serve as a gateway for fans of Western pop and rock into this music, given that it shares many of its dynamic sensibilities-- particularly contrasting sections-- with rock. More broadly, it's just a fantastic album that merits a spin by any half-way adventurous listener.","The latest Tamashek band to wow Europe and America, Toumast are similar to desert guitar standard-bearers Tinariwen but the Parisian duo spikes its sound with rock dynamics, funky detours, and even a bit of jazz and hip-hop.

Boogybytes Vol. 04,Ellen Allien,by: Andrew Gaerig,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b5c013d197565213acf7/1:1/w_160/f4090ef7.jpg,2008-04-24 05:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11419-boogybytes-vol-04/,Bpitch Control,"Describing Ellen Allien's choices for the fourth installment of her Bpitch Control label's Boogybytes series is a lot like describing Allien's own music: chunky and warm but distinctly European; sexually charged but not outright erotic; rhythmic but not explicitly danceable. Previous Boogybytes volumes have featured Allien pals Kiki, Sascha Funke, and Modeselektor controlling the decks; Boogybytes Vol. 04 serves less as a proper introduction to Allien's upcoming LP SOOL and more as low-key reminder of Allien's peculiar artistic voice. ""Controlling the decks"" is a becoming a bit of an anachronism for DJ mixes: Even though Allien hand-mixed Fabric 34 she mans the keyboard for Boogybytes Vol. 04, stringing together 15 tracks, often for four or five minutes at a time. Allien mixes a little like you might twirl spaghetti onto a fork, locating one or two strands she likes and wrapping layer after layer. For most of Boogybytes Vol. 04 she lays off kick drums or propulsive melodies in favor of glandular melodic thumps. When vocals are introduced-- as on the Damien Schwartz remix of Friendly People's ""Music Is Improper""-- it is in a very Allien-type mode: robotic phrases that add to the glitch and whir. The mix then stays very consistent and very true to Allien's own strengths. She throws in the occasional monkeywrench-- the second half of Melon's ""Nitzi (In My Mind, So Fine)"" is a sly house rave-up and the wind-chime exotica of Lucio Aquilina's ""My Cube"" is a constant attention grabber-- but for the most part Boogybytes Vol. 04 is stuffed with linear grooves that coil together naturally. Allien does well to stray from the obvious, making slyly left-field selections from the mix's higher profile artists.

Ricardo Villalobos makes an appearance with Patrick Ense on ""Fizpatrick"" which steers well clear of the tribal minimalism Villalobos is known for. Allien's decision to open and close the mix with slight ballads-- ""Liniendicke"" from SOOL producer AGF at the front end, Little Dragon's ""Twice"" to end-- is the set's most distinguishing characteristic. Despite the varied and intriguing selections, Boogybytes Vol. 04 drags and rips, its sonic palette leaking out over the course of 66 minutes that feature too much suspension and too little build. Four minutes of Gaiser's icicle-pretty ""Withdrawal"" pass without event; six minutes quickly oscillating tones during Vera's ""In the Nook"" never stick, and it's the second track in the mix. Transitions often occur over such long passages that they are ""seamless"" almost by default; losing interest in what track is actually playing is not uncommon. Allien is a DJ of no small consequence, and there's no arguing with the sonics of Boogybytes Vol. 04-- they almost perfectly enunciate her tastes, interests, and collaborators-- but as a set, this mix is too much lock and not enough step.","For the fourth installment of the Boogybytes series-- previous volumes have featured Kiki, Sascha Funke, and Modeselektor-- Bpitch Control boss Ellen Allien mans the keyboard, stringing together 15 tracks, often for four or five minutes at a time.

Mr. Love & Justice,Billy Bragg,by: Joshua Klein,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b5c513d197565213ad03/1:1/w_160/8280d534.jpg,2008-04-24 05:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11423-mr-love-justice/,Anti-,"Billy Bragg's been called many things-- bard, busker, bloke, Bolshevik-- but ever since his auspicious emergence into the British punk scene, a folkie wielding an electric guitar, he's remained remarkably true to his roots. Bragg's the missing link between Woody Guthrie and Joe Strummer, and anyone who's seen him perform in recent years knows he retains the power to move and inspire. He gives you hope, and it's a testament to his songs that while the context has shifted-- wither Reagan/Thatcher, welcome Bush/Blair (and later Brown)-- his music still makes you want to storm the gates. Obviously a lot has happened since Bragg's last album, 2002's England, Half-English-- not least the enduring Iraq war and the soul-crushingly sloppy prosecution of the so-called war on terror. But anyone expecting Bragg to rise to the occasion when he's arguably needed the most may be disappointed by Mr. Love & Justice. In 2008, as the world goes to shit, Bragg has countered the pervasive bad vibes with an album of love songs. Mostly. Not that Bragg has given up the fight. Hardly. He's spent much of the gap between records writing books (""The Progressive Patriot""), reissuing his back catalog, and founding Jail Guitar Doors, a musical education program for British inmates. In the meantime, he's kept gigging like a kid half his age, fueled with the same fervor and idealism that still propels Pete Seeger to pick up his banjo whenever he hears the call of a cause in need of his help and support. But on Mr. Love & Justice, he comes off rather staid, if never less than solid. Granted, songs like the soulful ""I Keep Faith"" (featuring fellow rabble rouser Robert Wyatt on backing vocals) and ""You Make Me Brave"" are as lovely as they come. The latter in particular, plus the dramatic ""Something Happened"" and the new Bragg classic ""I Almost Killed You"", seem tailor made, lyrics and all, for a hopeless romantic with better pipes than Bragg, someone like Morrissey. That's a compliment, as Bragg would likely be first to admit, and indeed much of his appeal still stems from his own modest abilities. Bragg's one of us, and sounds it, at least if you exclude his impressive songwriting abilities. Moments of Bragg's trademark indignation are there, of course: ""Sing Their Souls Back Home"" is gospel by way of Barking, a tribute to the downtrodden and trod-upon-- and that includes, of course, the troops abroad. (""Bring em home now,"" declares Bragg, as if anyone had any doubt where he stood.) The cheeky but also a little cheesy ""The Johnny Carcinogentic Show"" takes aim at the marketing of toxins (both literal and metaphoric) to kids. The simple ""Farm Boy"" is sung from the perspective of a soldier stuck in a snafu of the military's doing, while ""O Freedom"" is as earnest as they come, a tale of extraordinary rendition delivered with melancholy fatalism. It's understandable that Bragg may not want to be pigeonholed as a protest singer, but if it ever was the time to step up, it's now. Where's the outrage? Where's the anger? Mr. Love & Justice isn't exactly the musical equivalent of dropping flowers down the barrels of rifles, but there is a certain passivity to the disc, a characteristic magnified by the rootsy approach of Bragg's trusty band the Blokes, who channel the bucolic bent of the Band rather than the edge of the Clash. It's a disc born of love when what the world needs is actually a little more justice.","Billy Bragg, redoubtable radical, responds to five years of America (and England) making a mess of the world with a disc of mellow love songs.

H.N.I.C. Pt. 2,Prodigy,by: Tom Breihan,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b5dd5e6ef9596932284c/1:1/w_160/8217e181.jpg,2008-04-24 05:00:01,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11444-hnic-pt-2/,Voxonic,"Prodigy's 2007 album Return of the Mac was a leftfield triumph, the work of a rapper everyone had counted out reconnecting with everything that was great about him in the first place. As half of the bloody-minded Queensbridge duo Mobb Deep, Prodigy had come off a losing streak at least a half-decade long. He'd been dissed by Jay-Z, signed to G-Unit and released a flop of an attempted comeback, and saw crossover attempt after crossover attempt go nowhere. But with Return of the Mac, he and producer Alchemist dove into their stashes of 1970s blaxploitation-flick soundtracks and came up with a stark and grimy revivalist movie, a cinematic fever-dream memory of the old, gritty New York. In a bad year for rap, it was a cause for celebration. It'd be great to say that Return of the Mac triggered a creative revitalization in Prodigy, but the past year has seen the man's life devolve into chaos, which positively bleeds through H.N.I.C. Pt. 2. Return of the Mac was originally intended as a mixtape teaser for H.N.I.C. Pt. 2, P's long-awaited sequel to his 2000 solo debut. By the time he got around to recording that sequel, though, Prodigy was staring down a three-and-a-half year prison sentence for gun possession, a term he's since started. Before Prodigy began serving his time, though, he reportedly recorded scratchy YouTube videos for every song on the album, signed a record deal with the translation-tech startup Voxonic, and started writing cryptically self-aggrandizing and weirdly addictive all-caps blog entries. (From his list of trends that he started: ""#5 HOW I FOLD MY BANDANA,"" ""#9 SAMPLING MUSIC FROM THE MOVIE SCARFACE,,,,,NOBODY DID IT BEFORE ME..NOT THE MUSIC""). Musically, H.N.I.C. Pt. 2 grants P's travails an epic dignity. Alchemist is on board again; he and Brooklyn's Sid Roams (two dudes, weirdly) produce the bulk of the album. But instead of the washed-out soul-samples of Return of the Mac, Alchemist and Sid Roams favor spare, eerie drums and streaky, evocative John Carpenter synths, almost giving a restrained East Coast boom-bap answer to the gothic horror-movie bounce of DJ Paul and Juicy J. Sometimes they distress Prodigy's voice, running it through filters so he sounds like he's rapping over a bad phone connection. And we get a few cameos from Mobb associates like the competently heated Big Noyd and the terrifyingly guttural RBX clone Big Twins (one dude, weirdly). Prodigy sounds absolutely at home in all this, his haunted husk sinking easily into these tracks and playing off his guests with grim authority. The Prodigy of H.N.I.C Pt. 2 isn't depressed; he's as defiant and strange as always. He'll be OK.","Prodigy from Mobb Deep follows his low-key leftfield triumph, 2007's Return of the Mac, with his second ""proper"" solo album, a disc he recorded as he was staring down a three-and-a-half year prison sentence.

Moon Safari - 10th Anniversary Edition,Air,by: Mark Pytlik,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b5da9d034d5c69bf50c3/1:1/w_160/502eff8f.jpg,2008-04-24 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11442-moon-safari-10th-anniversary-edition/,AstralwerksVirginAstralwerksVirgin,"We all know what horrors illegal downloading has wrought on new releases; one side effect of that erosion involves labels attempting to recoup those losses by re-animating their back catalogues, Mary Shelley style. Before the big swoon, it was tough to justify a reissue without a remaster, but desperate times call for desperate measures, and so lately, we've seen an increasing spate of albums re-released for no other reason than a round-number anniversary. In the cases of your Thrillers and your Pet Sounds, that's a justifiable enough benchmark-- in a way, those reissues provide the platform to talk about us and how much we've changed as much as the music. Something like the new deluxe edition of Air's Moon Safari, though, is a slightly trickier proposition. For starters: There's the niggling question of whether Air's debut, superb as it is, really merits canonical treatment. As a collection of songs, it's endured well enough over time; after a decade, it still holds up fine. But so have a ton of other similarly acclaimed and successful records from 1998, and it doesn't seem remotely appropriate to roll out the red carpet for those either. As far as modern connect points go, there's nothing really happening musically at the moment that makes Moon Safari suddenly worthy of re-examination. If anything, with its dainty sonics and polite arpeggios, a lot of this record runs counter to the discofied and Balearic dance that's currently in fashion. Even Air would quickly abandon the cultivated library music aesthetic that characterized this record in favor of spindlier, more complicated, more sinister material. So yeah: As a snapshot of a place in time, you could do a lot worse than Moon Safari. But as something to be canonized in a three-disc set? The physics are lost on me. What, aside from the poetry of the number 10, is the exact reason to celebrate it now? Granted, it probably wasn't Air's idea to do this, and it's certainly not their fault that Moon Safari's legacy ultimately yielded a long list of bands along the lines of Lemon Jelly, Zero 7, Morcheeba, and Thievery Corporation, so perhaps it's fairer just to concentrate on what this reissue offers rather than the reason for it. The answer there, unfortunately, is: mixed returns. Although a robust collection featuring the original album, a disc of bonuses and B-sides, and a DVD featuring Mike Mills' 1999 tourfilm Eating, Sleeping, Waiting and Playing, this reissue doesn't offer nearly enough in the way of substantive bonus material to warrant its existence, nor does it even select the right material from that era to re-package. The bonus disc is the biggest indicator of the lack of quality control or thoughtfulness on hand: instead of material from the duo's excellent surrounding EPs, Le Soleil Est Près De Moi and the singles compilation Premiers Symptômes (a lot of which could actually benefit from having a light shone on it), we get five live tracks-- including a horrible, thrashy version of ""Kelly Watch the Stars""-- which expose Air's live approach early on as light on musicianship and heavy on grating affectation and kitsch. Of the remaining demos and remixes, only the two-minute long, string-heavy take on ""Remember"" (itself a resurrected B-side) and a sparse demo of ""You Make It Easy"" (from when it was an instrumental called ""Bossa 96"") are remotely illuminating. Everything else just feels incidental and reheated. Provided you like your filmmaking mannered and slightly cutesy, Mills' documentary remains a worthwhile curiosity, but even still, I can't imagine that anyone who'd be willing to shell out the money for a Moon Safari 10th Anniversary Edition wouldn't be acquainted with it already. Aside from that, you're basically paying for the packaging; in this case, that means a DVD-sized hardcover package with a nice, if slightly unnecessary, lyrics book attached. As a case for Moon Safari as a classic record, it falls a little short. But as a nice keepsake of a lovely record, it could be worse. I guess in the end it's really just a matter of whether you're fanatical enough about this album to buy it again. Virgin's either betting (or hoping) that enough of you are.","Air's wonderful debut is, perhaps oddly, re-packaged as a 10th-anniversary set with a disc of B-sides and Mike Mills' 1999 tourfilm Eating, Sleeping, Waiting and Playing.

NY's Finest,Pete Rock,by: Evan McGarvey,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b57cc0084474cd0c2422/1:1/w_160/53c833eb.jpg,2008-04-23 06:00:04,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11356-nys-finest/,Nature Sounds,"NY's Finest, Pete Rock's fourth proper solo album since 1998, has just enough comfortable tricks for the one of the grand old men of 1990s New York production to maintain warm feelings. He may have abandoned his steadfast SP2100 for the MPC, he may be the featured MC on over half the tracks, and he may be doing his work at every hip-hop head's favorite label for sustainable nostalgia, Nature Sounds, but Pete Rock is still Pete Rock. It should be taken as a compliment to say that NY's Finest feels unhinged in time. ""914"" dotingly retouches ESG's ""UFO"" (one of the most beloved sample source materials in hip-hop), sanding down the original's howling sirens and tucking its loop under another Rock trademark, a modest, warm horn splice. Ever the consummate crate digger, Rock touches all his favorite sonic bases-- classical, reggae, Miles Davis-- across Finest. And in an age when producers bid for stardom as soon as they hop behind a laptop queued up to Fruity Loops, Pete Rock works selflessly. Steering any MC through the warp and woof of as a beat as calmly as he digs crates, Rock's most seamless gift is the way he can manage a range of talent. Papoose sounds spring-loaded on album-closing ""Comprehend"". The rhotics and sharp sonorants of New York accents (Masta Killa, Styles P, Raekwon, Jim Jones) bend across Rock's warm overtones. Emotions too sound fresher. Rock has Little Brother pound obese horn section gravitas (another one of those Rock horn loops) on ""Bring Ya'll Back"". Rock himself is a frustratingly spacy vocalist, unsure where the line breaks should go, happier to name check specific drum machines than to pause and inhale. His heart is genuine; his hooks awkward: ""Don't be mad cause you can't do what I can/ Like when Jordan went up for that shot and switched hands."" On this site Tom Breihan suggested that Snoop Dogg had essentially become rap's Tom Petty. While it doesn't make NY's Finest's missteps or lyric doddering any cleaner, Pete Rock probably falls into that same matrix. I'll leave the definitive analogy up to someone else (Pete Rock as Brian Eno? Pete Rock as T-Bone Burnett?), but the implications are clear. Everything Pete Rock does now sounds like a sweet negotiation with the past, a vivid reflection of a place and of sound and craft gradually freezing into memory.","Steering any MC through the warp and woof of a beat as calmly as he digs crates, the legendary producer's most seamless gift remains the way he can manage a range of talent.

Staying In,diskJokke,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b58ac0084474cd0c2439/1:1/w_160/957df323.jpg,2008-04-23 06:00:03,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11368-staying-in/,Smalltown Supersound,"With two singles out on Prins Thomas' Full Pupp label, two more on Get Physical sub-imprint Kindish, and now, a debut LP on Smalltown Supersound, the 27-year-old Norwegian producer Joachim Dyrdahl (a.k.a. diskJokke) is building an impressive CV. But there's more to diskJokke than bulletproof connections; his spacey electro-disco is technically impressive and effortlessly appealing. It's rife with surgically straight percussion, oil-slick synths, bouncy bass, and eerie almost-vocal melodies-- warm sounds with plenty of frigid antimatter, courtesy of judicious effects and pan envelopes, seething between them. Like his countryman Lindstrøm, who came to dance music from a non-dance background, diskJokke studied classical violin and mathematics before turning to beats. The former is evident in his music's sweeping lyricism; the latter, in its cleanly schematized structures. When we talk about going out, we mean going in-- to a nightclub, restaurant, theater, or other dim enclosure. The background template of diskJokke's MySpace-- a hammock stretched between palm trees before a huge blue sky-- suggests an entirely different listening environment for his music. When he talks about staying in, he means going out, in both senses of the phrase. His tracks are equally suited to the close air of clubs and the breezy expanses of the great outdoors, working in deft juxtapositions of the earthly with the alien. The title track's tropical cheer is tailored for a seaside stroll, with burbling hand percussion and a bright melody that evokes timpani runs. But when these peter out to fully reveal the ice-cold synth dollops coagulating beneath them, it's like an unearthly stillness descending as a UFO suddenly lands in the dunes. The same trick is repeated on the tortuously titled ""I Was Go To Marrocco and I Don't See You"": At first, it's claustrophobic, with a bass line like a big rubber ball bouncing frantically around a small room, but the walls crumble imperceptibly until they suddenly fall away. Then the stars come out, and we drift up through the ceiling. This sense of vertical motion is crucial to diskJokke's music. Different kinds of techno evoke different kinds of movement: Clark's Turning Dragons is a runaway Tilt-A-Whirl, while Pantha Du Prince's This Bliss hang-glides through the Aurora Borealis. On ""Folk I Farta"", diskJokke is a glass-elevator operator bearing the listener upward through discrete levels of architecture: first floor, Glassian piano runs spinning gyroscopically across stereo channels. Second floor, prizefighting drums. Third floor, synths like Native-American flutes and harmonic washes. Fourth floor, overdriven counter-melody; fifth, drum and bass break. Sixth and final stop-- everything at once, duh. ""Folk I Farta"" is a good example of a track that's set up so well, anything except a predictable finale would be disappointing. Sometimes, diskJokke builds more chutes and ladders into his music: ""Større Enn Først Antatt"" feints where ""Folk I Farta"" steadily ascends. But either way, at the end of each track, the listener seems to have climbed something very high, through thick undergrowth, to emerge in the cold, thin air.","Norwegian producer Joachim Dyrdahl-- who studied classical violin and mathematics before releasing singles on labels run by Prins Thomas and the Get Physical crew-- issues an impressive electro-disco debut for Smalltown Supersound.

Elephant Shell,Tokyo Police Club,by: Adam Moerder,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b5c8c0084474cd0c249b/1:1/w_160/bfb85a3a.jpg,2008-04-23 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11426-elephant-shell/,Saddle Creek,"After two years' worth of suspense, Tokyo Police Club's Elephant Shell carries a far heavier weight than your average debut LP. It's a letter of intent from a band that's squatted on the fence, tentative to commit to one particular genre until now. On their snappy EPs, the fresh-faced Toronto four-piece courted emo, post-punk, and pop fans with equal coquettishness, their brief, catchy songs terminating before anyone could wring them through extensive indie taxonomy. As the band's first release on Saddle Creek, no one should be surprised that Elephant Shell showcases TPC waxing bookish emo. Sure, the songs still barely scrape the two-minute mark, and you'll be hard pressed to find any long-winded solos or codas, but the band's signature assembly line efficiency has become saturated with densely layered arrangements, not to mention lead singer Dave Monks' self-consciously mature vocals. Formally shrouded in megaphone hisses and cracks, Monks practically croons in your ear, and he's brought his thesaurus with him. Already netting considerable Colin Meloy and Ben Gibbard comparisons, Monks' stately delivery isn't exactly shying away from the similarities, especially with mouthfuls like ""Dead lovers salivate/ Broken hearts tessellate tonight."" Warmed by sentiments like this, the rest of the band sounds equally gooey. Unlike the quick-cut action movie pacing of the EPs, Elephant Shell's built on fluid songwriting, each track easing into the next without giving the listener much of a jolt. While the holistic craftsmanship is commendable, lush guitar tones and intricate instrumentation doesn't do justice to the band's potential visceral kick. Just listen to the handclaps on ""The Harrowing Adventures Of..."". Recycled from TPC's stunning sci-fi ballad ""Citizens of Tomorrow"", the claps feel better suited for a golf match, lackadaisically inserted into this ho-hum sea chanty (Meloy strikes again!) as cutesy ornamentation. At times, the newfound prim and properness can feel downright suffocating. The synth line on ""Graves"" desperately wants to blast off like an M83 melody, but the song's brooding heft weighs it down. Even on a solid track like ""Juno"", with its stuttering drum intro and music hall piano punctuations, gets choked off, slumping on its anti-climactic chorus rather than shouting. Despite these setbacks, Elephant Shell stands to soak up tons of new fans and earn serious shine soundtracking TV teen dramas. That's not so much an attack on the album's marketable gravitas as it is an acknowledgment of its consistently easy-on-the-ears sound. However, with each instrument no longer fighting for attention, and Monks resting comfortably in his mid-range vocal groove, the album leaves a less-than-memorable impression. Whereas cheerleader chants and fanatic barks goaded their earlier ramshackle tracks, urging them along despite the vague sci-fi and political themes, their new incarnation conscientiously covers its bases. After dampening the powerdrill riffs on opener ""Centennial"" with his long-winded lyrics, Monks practically calls timeout towards the track's close to spell things out for us: ""I'm running out of space/ So let me sum this up for you."" The deliberation proves to be an omen. After nailing the rapid-fire EP format with tracks that constantly threatened to disintegrate themselves from the inside-out, TPC psyche themselves out on their first full-length, over-cooking songs made from otherwise spectacular ingredients.","After two years' worth of suspense-- and a few snappy EPs-- Tokyo Police Club's Elephant Shell finally arrives and finds the group waxing bookish and/or emo like fellow Saddle Creek stars Bright Eyes or the Decemberists.

Don't You Evah EP,Spoon,by: Ryan Dombal,Features Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b5d9ea9e61561daa6e7e/1:1/w_160/80d98a34.jpg,2008-04-23 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11441-dont-you-evah-ep/,Merge,"The victory lap continues. It's hard to blame Spoon for fully soaking in the success of last year's sinewy Ga Ga Ga Ga Ga with non-stop tour dates, generous interviews, and now this eight-song EP. With the oddly named LP, Britt Daniel & co. purified their less-is-more mantra like never before. Listening to the 36-minute exercise in economy, it seems like the bulk of recording time was spent deciding what elements to take off each svelte track-- a ballsy statement of confidence in the Arcade Fire era. Plus, Spoon aren't dumb: They know albums like Ga Ga only come once or twice a career, even for a band so superhumanly steady. Barreling momentum aside, even the biggest ""Don't You Evah"" fan may be daunted by the prospect of a CD filled with seven iterations of the bulbous tune. So it's a testament not only to Spoon's taste but also their groove-based malleability that this remix project is listenable at all. While ""Don't You Evah"" is an unlikely deluxe EP candidate, its skeletal chug makes it ripe for interpretation-- a fact Spoon know all too well since the song was originally written by the now-defunct NYC band Natural History, whose version caps this disc. Though the inclusion of ""Don't You Evah""'s source serves as a humble nod, its utter averageness underlines the reasons why Spoon are your favorite indie rockers' favorite indie rockers. While the Spoon version is hardly a total revamp-- the bass riff, vocal melody, and arrangement are nearly identical-- little things like a slight uptick in tempo, a more colloquial title (""Evah"" instead of ""Ever""), some off-the-cuff studio banter, and a few lyrical adjustments make it a vast improvement. Both songs take on notions of commitment and the inevitable cold feet that come along with it. ""Hope you always think it's right/ With that ring is on the finger, feeling tight, tight, tight,"" goes the National History version, which gives advice in the tone of an older, wiser brother. ""Bet you got it all planned, right?/ Never fit to worry,never even feel a fright,"" sings Daniel, taking on a more sarcastic and roguish edge. The differences are slight, but important. The Spoon version is more open-ended-- it's unclear whether the protagonist comes to terms with marriage, busts out of his engagement, or simply goes through the motions miserably. And each of the six ""Don't You Evah"" remixes on this EP run with their own idea of what the track should ultimately feel like and mean. Ted Leo's excellently dubbed ""I Want It Hotter"" mix takes the song's husband-to-be on a hazy bender somewhere near Lee Perry's underground lair-- it's like an extended outro to the songwriter's recent reggae excursion, ""The Unwanted Things"", off last year's Living With the Living. Leo nails the druggy vibe so much that Daniel's introductory pronunciations of the song's first word (""bet ... bet-uh"") sound like the musings of a smoked-out couch potato to which the word ""bet"" has lost all meaning. The sizzling mix is noticeably more humid than Spoon's take, if not a bit hotter. Electro-rock kingpin Matthew Dear's mix not only fills the apparent universal contract stating either he or Hot Chip must show up on every remix project in existence from now on, he does what Daniel couldn't according to another portion of the song's opening chatter -- he makes it slick. Clearly influenced by fellow remix wiz Four Tet, Dear adds a circular acoustic guitar line and Cloud City keyboards to give the song a contemplative air. Here, it sounds like the track's central character has found happiness along with a couple kids and a manageable mortgage. It's hopeful as it drowns underneath its own sweet synths. Elsewhere, party time mixers take things in more traditionally dance-y directions. But-- keeping with Spoon's purposeful tact-- none turn in completely rote, never-ending big bass bullshit. Diplo provides a tasteful, 1980s style rendition that's equal parts wistful and funky. DJ Amaze and Alan Astor show that maybe ""Don't You Evah"" isn't the best template for booty handclaps while MySpace find Doc Delay Fixerupper provides a novelty goofball mix somewhere between ""The Monster Mash"" and Justice. These versions stand in as youthful distractions, but they can't escape Daniel's worry: ""Bet you never think it feels right,"" repeats the singer on six of the EP's eight tracks. And if the record's only new song, the loner piano pusher ""All I Got Is Me"", is any indication, it seems like finer feelings may not come in pairs at all. So while the men in the middle of Spoon's spindly songs may not play well with others, the actual songs themselves are perfectly hospitable to outside interference.","This eight-song EP-- featuring iterations of its title track-- is another victory lap for Spoon following the success of last year's sinewy Ga Ga Ga Ga Ga. Ted Leo, Matthew Dear, and Diplo are among the remixers.

Live in Liverpool,Gossip,by: Rebecca Raber,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a1539d034d5c69bf292a/1:1/w_160/92abd886.jpg,2008-04-23 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11427-live-in-liverpool/,Music With a Twist,"This live album, Gossip's first effort for their new Columbia-owned LGBT-themed label Music With a Twist, would get a pass simply on the strength of its bluesy dancefloor re-imagining of Wham!'s ""Careless Whisper"" alone. Sure, the punked-up 1980s cover trend is old-- must every band  these day remake a hit from the Reagan era in their own American Apparel-clad image?-- and yes, any Gossip fan with access to a computer has probably already heard this track, as it has long been a British blogger favorite. But never mind. From its spare, throbbing-bass opening to super front woman Beth Ditto's soulful, wrenched delivery to its chugging conclusion, the song eschews the ironic wink and distanced posturing and infuses the song with the throttle and charisma that makes Gossip such a force. ""Careless Whisper"", as a result, has never sounded so raw: The song was always about regret, but something about George Michael's silky delivery and that hopelessly dated swooning saxophone gives it an air of elegant elevator muzak. As Ditto wails and Brace Paine's aggressive guitar stabs against Hannah Billie's four-on-the-floor stomp, they tear away all that was mannered about the original, leaving tears and sweat and propulsive dance rhythms in its place. Which, incidentally, is what the song is about in the first place. Luckily, this collection, which was recorded at a show (duh) in Liverpool last summer, has more to offer than just that one great song. Its two covers-- ""Whisper"" and Aaliyah's ""Are You That Somebody?"", which proves that should Ditto tire of wearing the mantle of tough garage-punk goddess, she's got the pop chops and the dramatic delivery to be a melisma-drunk R&B diva-- might be the highlights of this album. But the 11 originals, freed from the shackles of a recording studio, debut Gossip's sound as it has always been meant to be heard. Though the Oregon-via-Arkansas trio has released three studio albums over the past eight years, they have yet to capture the hot-blooded power of their muscular live sound on record. (They came closest on their previous live album, 2003's muddily recorded Undead in NYC.) This well-produced album attempts to remedy that and preserve their bluesy, blowzy show for posterity. Finally there's a sweat-and-beer-soaked alternative for those who always liked ""Standing in the Way of Control"" and ""Don't Make Waves"" but felt their studio incarnations were too clinical to capture the band’s overheated stage presence. (Want proof? Check the bonus DVD that comes packaged with this collection.) On Gossip's foray into dance-punk,  2006's Standing in the Way of Control, Billie's cool drum precision often felt too aloof for Ditto's bloody wail, so hearing that album's songs (most notably, standout ""Yr Mangled Heart"") live is to hear the rhythm section match Ditto's  level of fabulously messy agitation. There's not much stage banter here-- though Ditto does dedicate two songs to ""the faggots"" and ""the dykes"" respectively-- but this collection will still give listeners the feeling of being at one Gossip's concerts, complete with Joplin-esque vocal riffs, cathartic guitar bursts, and crowd singalongs (this was, afterall, recorded in England where Ditto is a much bigger NME-crowned star). There are few women in music today with pipes like Ditto's and even fewer still that can pull off her level of vocal emoting without either sounding overwrought or needing a backing track. So a live album is a wise way for Gossip to introduce themselves to their new major label. It highlights their strengths (that voice, those beats, that authentic giving-it-their-all vibe) and hides their weaknesses (lack of songwriting breadth and dynamic diversity) making it sound like there's no place more fun than a Gossip concert, and no better host than Beth Ditto.",,6.9,
In the Name of Love: Africa Celebrates U2,Various Artists,by: Joshua Klein,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b541ea9e61561daa6da7/1:1/w_160/786c9059.jpg,2008-04-22 06:00:05,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11306-in-the-name-of-love-africa-celebrates-u2/,Shout! Factory,"The comedian Ricky Gervais likes nothing better than slaughtering sacred cows, and on last year's ""BBC Comic Relief"" telethon, it was rock star do-gooders on charitable holiday in Africa he tagged the ill-fated heifer. In a brilliant bit, he fakes a self-righteous visit to Kenya, meeting with a poor villager who calls a cassette of U2's The Joshua Tree ""one of his most prized possessions."" ""When my brother was in the hospital,"" relates the fake villager, ""the doctor played him this cassette."" Gervais sheds a (fake) tear. ""Africa Celebrates U2"", proclaims the subhead of In the Name of Love, a collection of diverse African acts covering the Irish rock band, but that seems generally unlikely outside of this comp. Indeed, the notion of African acts paying tribute to U2 initially is a bit hard to swallow as much more than a gimmick, as if the rock band has made such pervasive inroads across the continent to ever be cited as a real influence. That the tribute to the music of such notorious do-gooders is itself a benefit, with proceeds going to the Global Fund (to fight AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria) provides an awkward element of irony, however well intentioned. Yet against all odds, In the Name of Love is no hackwork, and the hodgepodge of acts gathered together do represent some of Africa's highest profile musicians, at least in terms of crossover power. Even more laudable, the disc makes a point of delineating just where each performer is from, avoiding the patronizing habit of those who thoughtlessly rope together almost one billion people like they're all from one country. There's Vieux Farka Touré (from Mali), Tony Allen (from Nigeria), Les Nubians (from Cameroon), Cheikh Lô (from Senegal), the Soweto Gospel Choir (from South Africa), Sierra Leone's Refugee All-Stars (from Sierra Leone, natch), and several more (though, oddly enough, no one representing North Africa, or even specifically Morocco, site of some sessions for U2's upcoming 12th album). All the songs, save Vusi Mahlasela's ""Sometimes You Can't Make It On Your Own"", come from U2's prolonged pre-Pop golden period, and over half from the twin classics The Joshua Tree and Achtung Baby, which makes sense, given the respective (global?) ubiquity of each album. In fact, most of the tracks here fall on the familiar side of the U2 catalog, leaving it up to each act to suss out a new take on old stand-bys. They do a pretty good job, too, and while nothing here is totally unrecognizable, a few tracks are reasonably inspired. Tony Allen transforms ""Where the Streets Have No Name"" into sunny, funky, horn-propelled Afrobeat lite. Vieux Farka Touré injects more desert blues into ""Bullet the Blue Sky"" than U2 ever managed. The Soweto Gospel Choir accomplish something similar with ""Pride (In the Name of Love)"". After all, no self-respecting gospel choir would ever tap Bono as a member, no matter how hard he tries, so it's neat to hear pros achieve what the singer can only simulate. Elsewhere, Angelique Kidjo re-imagines ""Mysterious Ways"" as an Afro-Caribbean hybrid, and Les Nubians twist ""With or Without You"" into a stylish and modern Afropop ballad. The kora and wah-wah guitar mix in Ba Cissoko's ""Sunday Bloody Sunday"" and Cheikh Lô's talking-drum and fretless bass adorned ""I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For"" are pretty convincing. The African Underground All-Stars' hip-hop version of ""Desire"" isn't, but their collective heart is clearly in the right place. Not every track is a cover of a chart smash. The Sierra Leone All-Stars successfully tackle the martial ""Seconds"", from War, taking advantage of the original's reggae-ish bass run but pairing it with a jittery, percussion-heavy dance groove rather than militant rhythms. And concluding the disc is Waldemar Bastos' haunting version of the bleak Achtung Baby finale ""Love is Blindness"", with the original's power-drill guitar solo replaced with some strained, pained vocals. That the interpretations here are more interesting than essential, revealing few new facets of artist and song alike, is to be expected, especially when dealing with such (like it or not) iconic source material. But the fact that In the Name of Love handles such a potentially pitfall-rich project without any major stumbles-- and no groan-inducing ""play the rumba, Edge!"" moments-- is perhaps good enough.","Twelve acts from across Africa pay tribute to U2, but thankfully it's better than that sounds. And it's for charity!

Alison Statton,Pants Yell!,by: Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b5859d034d5c69bf5042/1:1/w_160/cdb7b961.jpg,2008-04-22 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11364-alison-statton/,Soft Abuse,"Alison Statton's name may not ring a bell. Young Marble Giants' really should. Statton sang, with gentle understatement, in that beloved, recently reissued Welsh post-punk group, but she doesn't bear any obvious relation to the album titled after her. Just this: Pants Yell! deal in gentle understatement, too. And on their fourth album, the Boston indie pop trio do so in a way that might even convince you to give that silly exclamation point one more stupid chance. Young Marble Giants' empty space came as a rebuke to every band that ever turned it up to 11, but Alison Stratton's rebellion is subtler than quiet vs. loud. For one thing, although undeniably twee (they've covered Jens Lekman), Pants Yell! aren't afraid of a big sound. New drummer Casey Keenan, who joins founding members Andrew Churchman and Sterling Bryant via Boston psych-rock group Major Stars, powers up the rhythm section considerably, his energetic fills driving the songs forward. Nor is Alison Stratton shy about feedback, letting the scraggly noise that Pavement learned from the Clean tatter the edges of their fey boy-girl harmonies on ""A New City Life"", or grind the glockenspiel-chiming ""The Royal We"" to a screechy halt. One-minute, 17-second ""Shoreham Kent"" even nicks the tom-bashing instrumental hook from the Cure's ""Boys Don't Cry"". Pants Yell!'s revolt isn't in declining to overpower with volume. It's in rejecting the grandiose. Churchman, who sings in the shy tenor of an American Stuart Murdoch, writes sweetly melancholy songs, as unprepossessing as growing up in the suburbs. Relationships die slowly, youth gets a bittersweet smell-ya-later. At its catchiest, Alison Statton comes close to the wry, wistful jangle of the Lucksmiths. See outsider's anthem ""Reject, Reject"", or the horn-backed ""Magenta and Green"" and ""Trying to Be Good""-- that last title really belongs on an indie-pop book (Would-Be-Goods would get their own chapter). ""For Dee"" is slow, stripped-down, and heartbreaking: ""I'll take all my goodbyes back/ If you give all your I-love-yous/ Waste 'em on anyone you choose."" ""I'd rather be a singer than a one-man band,"" Churchman sings on the title track. He isn't alone: For all the talk about the halcyon days of Postcard, Rough Trade, and Sarah Records in the UK, or K Records and Slumberland in the U.S., there's still a thriving indie pop underground today (and not just in Sweden), with its own gatherings, message boards, blogs. Some of the bands can be too gentle, understated, or, given the participatory culture, sometimes amateurish for their own good. Pants Yell! are a part of that community, and Alison Statton shows them maturing into one of its better ambassadors. Not the kind of ambassador that's all grandiose-like though.","Naming their album after the Young Marble Giants singer hints at what this Boston indie pop group creates: gentle understatements, stripped-down and sometimes heartbreaking.

Mantronix: The Album [Deluxe Edition],Mantronix,by: Nate Patrin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b59913d197565213acb2/1:1/w_160/90ddb543.jpg,2008-04-22 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11385-mantronix-the-album-deluxe-edition/,Sleeping BagWarlockSleeping BagWarlock,"Rising with 1983's ""Sucker M.C.'s"" and fading by the release of 1988's sample-era A-bomb It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back, hip-hop had a mid-decade infatuation with synthesizers and drum machines. It arguably peaked somewhere around 1985-1986: BDP's dancehall-inflected crime-story classic ""9mm Goes Bang"" out of the South Bronx, Schoolly D's killer two-fer ""P.S.K.-- What Does It Mean?"" / ""Gucci Time"" 12"" out of Philly, and Ice-T's prototypical West Coast gangsta anthem ""6 'N the Mornin'"" were all built on a sound that traded the old school's post-disco funk loop structure for something both rougher-edged and more futuristic. Chief amongst the catalysts for this sound was Kurtis Mantronik, a Jamaican-Syrian-American record store DJ who produced his debut single before he turned 20. His first major release, ""Needle to the Groove"", personifies our current idea of how drum machine hip-hop sounds-- even if, upon its 1985 release, it sounded pretty damn out there compared to its peers. Mantronix: The Album has undergone a strangely accidental evolution to its status as a lost hip-hop classic: Beloved by veteran heads yet considered incredibly dated in the sample-artisan Dre/RZA/Pete Rock/Primo 90s, it's since started sounding a lot more like a well-aging and prescient forebear of Southern bounce and hyphy. While the Deluxe Edition of The Album is an exhaustive 2xCD collection of remixes, extended versions, instrumentals, and a cappellas, the seven songs at the original album's core-- six originals and a slightly redundant but enjoyable ""Mega-Mix""-- are the main draw. More specifically, it's Mantronik's production, which incorporates multiple layers of polyrhythmic boom-clap percussion, alien-sounding proto-acid bass, and dubbed-out scratching that sounds like King Tubby trying his hand at turntablism. Tracks like ""Hardcore Hip-Hop"" and ""Needle to the Groove"" boast some of the most intricately assembled syncopated beats heard in any digital production to that point, and the mutated go-go of ""Ladies"" has a lot of carefully threaded gears turning beneath its instant-hook bounce, claps and kicks throwing counter-measures against each other until they sound like a rhythmic swordfight. But it's ""Bassline"" that's probably the most famously innovative of these tracks: The titular low end turns electro's android jerkiness into a live-body strut, and the immaculate drum programming contains a busy but carefully refined volley of claps and snare hits that dart and weave in and out of each other spectacularly. It's this complexity and attention to detail that makes the production about as carefully human-crafted as any electronic music of the 80s, even as it focuses all that effort and energy squarely at the art of moving butts. As prescient as some of this stuff sounds, the vocal portion of this duo is more of his time-- MC Tee is as 1985 as they come, replete with sing-song post-LL flow, party-people-centric lyrics, and an instance of the word ""shit"" getting bleeped out. Those who don't mind how lyricism sounded before Rakim will find charm in Tee's voice, though-- for one thing, he acts as yet another fine-tuned component of Mantronik's rhythmic traffic, frequently adding an altered cadence and off-beat emphases in what would otherwise be a straightforward old-school flow. (Plus it always helps to have a vocoder or a scratch answer back a few times.) Producer and MC complement each other enough that the instrumental tracks included on the extra disc seem incomplete, though as bonuses go having them is nice; throwing in a truckload of 12"", radio, and alternate edits (including the even-thicker club version of ""Bassline"") and a couple of solid live performances of ""Needle to the Groove"" and ""Ladies"" is even better. Mantronik would have a couple more years of hip-hop greatness ahead of him: a few T La Rock singles made in the wake of his smash ""It's Yours"", including ""Back to Burn"" and ""This Beat Kicks"", became underrated classics, and Just-Ice's misleadingly named 1986 LP Back to the Old School boasted one of the all-time great mid-80s hardcore breaks-- the monstrous ""Cold Gettin' Dumb"". On top of that, the second Mantronix LP, Music Madness, was a solid expansion of his signature sound. But by the late 80s he was arguably more revered by hardcore heads as an A&R than a producer, and his signing of EPMD to Sleeping Bag records ironically helped fuel a shift from mid-school electro-rap to the funk-break revivalism of rap's Golden Age. His house-friendly 1998 remix of EPMD's classic ""Strictly Business"" is indication enough of where he went from there, further away from traditional hip-hop and deeper into dance club territory, but don't take that as a warning. Mantronix: The Album sounds, in retrospect, more like the peak of classic rap innovation than a crossover compromise, and damn if it doesn't sound great played between Turf Talk and Mannie Fresh.","The Deluxe Edition of this prescient hip-hop classic adds remixes, extended versions, instrumentals, and a capellas.

Flight of the Conchords,Flight of the Conchords,by: Chris Dahlen,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b5d7c0084474cd0c24b8/1:1/w_160/0c310df8.jpg,2008-04-22 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11439-flight-of-the-conchords/,Sub Pop,"On their fictional television show, Flight of the Conchords almost never play a song that's worth a damn-- except in their imaginations. Every time they get a gig, Jemaine Clement and Bret McKenzie take the stage and limp their way through the deadly ""Who Likes to Rock the Party"". But in their own heads, they're stars: deadly rappers, psychedelic princes, and unstoppable ladykillers. It's a good joke, and the Conchords spun it into a hilarious HBO series-- the best quasi-mockumentary since This Is Spinal Tap, and a sendup of the myth of the struggling band that came right when the whole music biz feels blue. But the concept gets muddled, especially on their first full-length studio record. Where do they draw the lines between the real-life band, the band we see struggling on the show, and the band that the struggling band wishes it could be? They bill themselves as New Zealand's fourth-best novelty act-- so should we laugh at the songs, or with them? And their love of AM radio love songs shines true-- they thank Barry White in the album liner notes, probably not ironically-- but are we supposed to congratulate them for trying to do the same thing? In other words: Sure they're funny, but are these songs supposed to be any good? Surprisingly, yes. In their live act-- which is rigorously documented on YouTube-- Bret and Jemaine play a folk/comedy duo, mostly with acoustic guitar. But for their first studio album, working with producer Mickey Petralia, they graduate to a soft-rock exotica crossed with pool-side world beat and cockblocked lounge. The Conchords have an ear for melody and they take their genre appropriations seriously enough, especially on the French (phrasebook) lyrics and musky harmonies of ""Foux du Fafa"". But even with synths, percussion, and the occasional horn player, the arrangements enhance the core duo instead of supplanting them: hip-hop satire ""Hiphopopotamus vs. Rhymenoceros [ft. Rhymenoceros and the Hiphopopotamus]"" adds beats, but most of the rhythm comes from the guitars. This approach also keeps the album low-key, almost too much so. ""Boom"" had more oomph in the television version-- and all the dancing low-wage sign-holders in the video didn't hurt-- and when they got to the old chestunt ""Robots"", they sound like they've sung these jokes a couple times too many. (Stick with the live version, on last fall's EP.) They hit the highest energy level on the closers, ""Business Time"" and ""Bowie"", and while the guys are commended for not trying to ham it up, it's a strikingly mellow album for a comedy record. Assuming, that is, that it's mainly a comedy album and not just an indie rock record that's funny. And oh yeah, it is really funny. Even the jokes that try a little too hard-- like half of ""Inner City Pressure""-- wear well after several listens. ""Most Beautiful Girl (in the Room)"" and ""Business Time"" are still the highpoints, both true to life and totally hilarious: ""You're so beautiful, you could be an air hostess in the 60s...you could be a part-time model/ But you'd probably have to keep your day job."" And series fave ""Hiphopopotamus vs. Rhymenoceros"" matches the stumbling charm of the TV version even without the breakdancing. Some nitpicks: They probably left off one of your favorite songs-- say, ""Bret You've Got It Going on"", or ""Mermaids,"" or for that matter, ""Who Likes to Rock the Party"". And they included a couple, like ""Leggy Blonde"", that flounder without a story to set them up. But it's fair to guess that most of the listeners already know all the episodes by heart. The hardest-working duo in novelty finally made it to the studio, but they're still saving their old routines for posterity. And they're still working towards the pop craftsmanship-- and raw, irresistable sex power-- that they dreamt about on the show. We'll see what happens next year, when the series comes back; after all, they have a whole season's worth of new material to write, and the sky is still the limit.","The band from HBO's ""Flight of the Conchords""-- a hilarious sendup of the myth of the struggling band that came around right when the whole music biz felt blue-- is now Sub Pop's Flight of the Conchords, who have just released their self-titled debut album.

The Age of the Understatement,The Last Shadow Puppets,by: Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b5cf5e6ef95969322828/1:1/w_160/02b591e1.jpg,2008-04-22 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11433-the-age-of-the-understatement/,Domino,"Alex Turner has spent most of his short career trying to prove he's not whatever people say he is. Or else, trying to prove he can live up to it. At the height of Arctic Monkeys mania in late 2005, the Sheffield, England quartet followed their first UK No. 1-- post-punk dervish ""I Bet You Look Good on the Dancefloor""-- with one of Turner's most vivid character sketches to date, red-light vignette ""When the Sun Goes Down"". Which also went to No. 1. More importantly, it hinted that all the hype, most of it from the excitable British press (Terris? Gay Dad? Razorlight?...Coldplay?), wasn't all hype. The next single's B-sides included a cover of 1965 r&b oldie ""Baby, I'm Yours"". When it came time to pick a lead single for fine 2007 sophomore effort Favourite Worst Nightmare, the Arctics went with the one that didn't have a chorus. In between singing, playing guitar, and writing songs for one of the UK's biggest bands, Turner listened to some records. Old ones: Favourite Worst Nightmare finale ""505"" sampled Ennio Morricone, and in an interview at the time with The Onion's A/V Club, Turner touted everything from doo-wop and girl groups to late-1960s David Bowie rarity ""In the Heat of the Morning"". In retrospect, that's where Turner's latest project, the Last Shadow Puppets, begins. The other half of the duo, Miles Kane, played guitar on ""505"". The Bowie song, which the Last Shadow Puppets have since covered as a B-side, could easily have been their aesthetic template. Kane, formerly of 1960s-tinged English rockers the Little Flames and now with a new group dubbed the Rascals, is actually Turner's least well-known collaborator on the Last Shadow Puppets' full-length debut. Final Fantasy's Owen Pallett, who has arranged strings for the Arcade Fire, does so here with the 22-piece London Metropolitan Orchestra. Simian Mobile Disco half James Ford, who produced Favourite Worst Nightmare and the Klaxons' debut album, produces again and serves double-duty on drums. Together, they've helped create Turner's most impressive album-length statement yet, one that strives, musically and lyrically, for the epic grandeur of an era before GarageBand or MySpace, and avoids lapsing into pretentiousness by dint of its own headlong enthusiasm. As Turner's granddad might say, ""You've overdoon it."" Again. Ford may be better known for his work in unfortunately nicknamed subgenres like blog house and nu-rave, but on The Age of the Understatement, he oversees a remarkably vivid 1960s symphonic-pop pastiche. The title track and first single opens the record at a gallop, stretching the baroque-pop of early Scott Walker-- the Jacques Brel-translating, Ingmar Bergman-feting crooner, not the avant-gardist from Tilt and The Drift-- to the dramatic mariachi brass of Love's Forever Changes, or one of Morricone's Sergio Leone scores. Or Dave Dee, Dozy, Beaky, Mick & Tich's ""The Legend of Xanadu"". ""About as subtle as an earthquake, I know,"" Turner concedes on ""My Mistakes Were Made for You"", which settles into a regal symphonic-funk groove befitting David Axelrod (the producer for Cannonball Adderley and the Electric Prunes, not the adviser to Barack Obama). Pallett's contributions range from the jittery waltz fanfares of ""Calm Like You"" and whip-cracking horse race of ""Separate and Ever Deadly"" to the downy romance of ""The Meeting Place"", which could've fit on an album by the Arctics' fellow Sheffield son Richard Hawley. So obviously the biggest difference between the Last Shadow Puppets and Turner's main gig is in the lyrics. Though less immediately noticeable than the majestic production, the change in the scale of Turner's songwriting is ultimately more profound. The video for ""The Age of the Understatement"" is set in Russia, and compared to the Arctics' insider-ish dispatches about Life Among the Chavs or Life As the Biggest New Band Since Oasis, these songs are Tolstoy in their bird's-eye omniscience. ""Burglary and fireworks, the skies they were alight,"" Turner sings on ""Calm Like You"", describing a once-exciting city and the bitter romance that took place there. Brisk, timpani-rumbling ""Standing Next to Me"" is just conventional love-triangle stuff, but it finds Turner moving from his anthropologically detailed Arctics brushstrokes to bold, cinematic gestures: ""You want to have her/ Two years have gone now/ But I can't relate."" And on stinging recrimination ""Black Plant"": ""He's got papercuts from the love letters you never gave him."" Turner wisely decides not to compete in the crooner sweepstakes, letting his voice retain its usual charming grittiness. Kane, from near Liverpool, sings in a voice that blends in as naturally as if they were brothers. So if you hear only the caustic vocals and lavish arrangements of faster-paced tracks like ""Only the Truth"", the Last Shadow Puppets are exactly what you'd expect Arctics-with-strings to sound like. This single-mindedness hampers songs like ""The Chamber"" or ""I Don't Like You Any More"", which work fine on their own but offer little to distinguish themselves when following The Age of the Understatement's stirring first half. As on both Arctics albums, though, Turner keeps a tender surprise up his sleeve. The first minute of finale ""The Time Has Come Again"" strips away all but neatly picked acoustic guitar and a 22-year-old's panging nostalgia for a few years earlier. ""Don't go too soon/ She went too soon,"" Turner and Kane harmonize, as strings rise up to meet them, whatever people say they are, and everything else.","The Arctic Monkeys' Alex Turner teams with Final Fantasy's Owen Pallett, Simian Mobile Disco's James Ford, and Miles Kane, of 1960s-tinged English rockers the Little Flames and the Rascals, to create a remarkably vivid 1960s symphonic-pop pastiche.

Schmancey,Fancey,by: Joshua Klein,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b5a613d197565213acc4/1:1/w_160/f64b6feb.jpg,2008-04-21 06:00:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11395-schmancey/,What Are,"Since the days of the Beatles there have been plenty of great marginalized songwriters, sent to the sidelines to stew in their own creative juices until their main meal ticket takes a break (or, in the case of George Harrison and those Beatles, breaks up). New Pornographers albums always make room for a couple of tracks spotlighting Dan Bejar or Neko Case, but those two have their equally prominent solo projects as outlets. Hell, even lead Porno Carl Newman felt the need to release something under his own name. As for rest of the busy bunch, Newman's niece Kathryn Calder plays in the Immaculate Machine, John Collins aids Bejar in Destroyer, Kurt Dahle recently played drums on Chris Walla's solo bow, and Blaine Thurier makes movies. Which brings us to New Pornographers guitarist Todd Fancey, who has his own solo project, not very creatively but still appropriately enough called Fancey. Fancey's 2004 debut was unabashed in its affection for 1970s soft rock, and listening to it you can hear why there might not be room for Fancey's tracks in the New Pornographers. Unlike many side projects, Fancey sounds nothing like the main gig, save for his love of pop and ear for pleasant chord progressions. Fancey has already begun work on a third album, but in the meantime there's album number two, Schmancey, which was released last fall. Schmancey offers more of the same AM rock, stuff that goes down smooth but doesn't exactly rock the boat (and we're talking yacht). Still, a few exposures to the tight harmonies of ""Lost in Twilight"" or the mildly subversive (ELO by way of Steely Dan) ""Blue Star""-- a breezy paean to taking drugs-- and you're likely to ask permission to come aboard. If that boat metaphor seems cheesy, wait until you hear the music, always well-crafted and rife with twisted (if subtle) lyrical details. Heck, songs like the country rock-lite ""Fader"", ""Heaven's Way"", or the disco-on-downers ""Feels Like Dawn""-- while perfectly produced in glorious state-of-the-art (circa 35 years ago) hi-fi-- sound like they should be played at low volume, the better to replicate an elevator's hidden sound system or the thin murmur of an old transistor radio behind the front desk as you check into a cheap hotel. But the kitsch factor isn't always a bad thing, since Fancey's aforementioned affection is certainly infectious. This is innocent appropriation, short on smarmy irony but long on mellow tunes, music made to be enjoyed, forgotten, then rediscovered years down the line as more effective (and affecting) than the soundtracks to all those long cross country car rides may have seemed at the time. It's thrift-store chic, music that smells a tad of mildew and mold but which brings a smile to your face all the same.","The New Pornographers' Todd Fancey goes way back to the 1970s for a platter that ably apes the sunny side of AM radio (with a few dark clouds lurking on the horizon).

Bäbytalk,Idol Fodder,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b5309d034d5c69bf4fa8/1:1/w_160/53331057.jpg,2008-04-21 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11293-babytalk/,Slender Means SocietyStates Rights,"Were it not for some very modern production values, Idol Fodder's Bäbytalk would sound like a lost relic from the heady days of post-punk, before the cultural moment's unruly stylistic improvisation crystallized into a genre defined by upstroked guitars and neo-Marxist lyrics. It's a madcap hybrid of jump-rope pop and baroque chamber music that draws a zigzagging line between Arthur Russell, Young Marble Giants, the Homosexuals, and outlying points. And it does this while remaining direly infectious: no mean feat, in a lineage prone to prioritizing experimentation over user-friendliness. If the record sounds like a remarkably authentic reconstruction of the wide-eyed, freewheeling energy that attended the lo-fi British post-punk of the early 1980s, it's because Alig Pearce is no newcomer to this music-without-borders thing. During post-punk's first indefinable wave, he was always on the periphery of the zeitgeist with his rotating ensemble Family Fodder. He collaborated with This Heat and recorded in their practice space. He released an early single on Small Wonder, the same label that first issued Bauhaus's ""Bela Lugosi's Dead"" and the Cure's ""Killing an Arab"". He flipped the mandatory dub and tape-manipulation experiments on Family Fodder's debut, Monkey Banana Kitchen, and beyond the mandatory reunions, they were done by 1983. That Idol Fodder unites Pearce with Darlini Singh-Kaul, the daughter of Family Fodder vocalist Dominique Levillain, roots the album even more firmly in Cold War-era aesthetic rebellion. While Alig has remained active over the past couple of decades, Idol Fodder most overtly picks up where Family Fodder left off, exploring ways to make the baroque go pop. Bäbytalk is dominated by peppy sing-song vocals and deep, dramatic string rhythms, but each track delights with its creative deployment of these cornerstones and surprising embellishments. On ""The Onliest Thing"", Pearce and Singh-Kaul's twinned vocal lines ride a steadily sawing, bowed chord, and beyond an electric guitar bridge and some handclaps, all of the track's considerable interest resides in the contrast between the jackbooted strings and the fluid vocal line. It complements, yet in no way predicts, the next track, ""Earlimusix"", an inward-spiraling meditation for reed instruments. This is a band that knows how to milk one good idea for all of its undiluted worth. Bäbytalk is the sixth installment in the Pregnancy Series co-curated by Slender Means and States Rights, and its baby-centric theme represents a literal take on the series' ambiguous concept. Idol Fodder thankfully avoid ""wittle bitty snoogy ookums"" kinda talk, but they come close on ""The Onliest Thing"", a pledge of fealty to a newborn. The iron-banded durability of the track saves it from undue preciousness, and while the baby-theme isn't developed that interestingly, it never gets in the way of the diverse, sharp songwriting. ""Strangest Games"" is a jet-black noir for creeping percussion, funerary vocals, and gloaming strings flecked with reversed glissandos; hot on its heels is ""Infamy"", a tumbling, crispy-fried pop rock ditty. Singh-Kaul's bouncing-ball vocal melody on ""Analyze my Life?"" finds a perfect analogue in a robust jew's harp rhythm, and on ""Death and the Maiden"", Pearce sounds like Stuart Murdoch fronting the Kronos Quartet. The outsized charisma of the musicians holds their stylistic wanderlust fast at the seams, and their steadfast refusal to decide what kind of band they are reminds us of a cultural moment when to do so was considered tantamount to creative suicide.","If the record sounds like a remarkably authentic reconstruction of the wide-eyed, freewheeling energy that attended the lo-fi British post-punk of the early 1980s, it's because Alig Pearce is no newcomer to this music-without-borders thing.

Don't Stop: Recording Tap,Various Artists,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b5969d034d5c69bf505c/1:1/w_160/4c368bd0.jpg,2008-04-21 06:00:03,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11379-dont-stop-recording-tap/,Numero Group,"How do you finish a puzzle when the guy in the picture is holding the last piece? This is the question Numero Group's Rob Sevier and Ken Shipley ask in their liner notes for Don't Stop: Recording Tap. The question is rhetorical, of course, a way of explaining how difficult it was to assemble this compilation of a New York record label that was so obscure that it barely even released records and most of the people involved who can be located don't even want to talk about it. The label's very founder, Jeremiah Yisrael, born Teddy T. Thompson and now living in Jacksonville, Fla., refused for years to give up his old, moldering tapes and carefully selects the memories he shares of the time. The Numero guys have been through this kind of thing before as they've researched the eight volumes of their Eccentric Soul series, and though technically not part of that series, this could easily have been the ninth volume, between the backstory and the music it contains. The music on the collection was recorded in the early 1980s, as disco faded and rap was on the rise in the nation's biggest city. Continuity wasn't a big thing for Yisrael, and he moved his label from project to project, abandoning previous ones along the way, sometimes without even bothering to release them. Possible deals with the likes of Sugar Hill's Sylvia Robinson fell by the wayside as he set his sites on the next thing, and great early rap tracks that could have blown up if released when they were recorded in 1981 instead fell with a barely audible thump in 1986, years past their shelf date. Yisrael wasn't running a shoestring operation. He ran the Bronx-based T&T health food chain and was the organizer of the Brotherhood of Wisdom, Temple of Issachar, a storefront church that focused on the Torah. In the past, he'd apprenticed with Motown/Mercury/ OldWorld/Chess/Atco/ producer Gene Redd, Jr., who ultimately came to work for Tap, and he'd also had a brief acting career, including a role in the 1972 Bond flick Live and Let Die. He poured money into his recording sessions, booking time at Mayfair, Power Station, and Right Track, bringing in string orchestras and professional arrangers, some of whose hand-notated work can be seen in the supplemental book that comes with the CD. Disco is the bedrock of all of these recordings, and though some manage to be lo-fi in spite of their budgets, they all possess an infectious quality and a stomping, high-tempo groove. Yisrael started with Annette Denvil, who he discovered at a talent show he organized. ""So Nice"", the song included here, features smoothly grooving verses balanced by a somewhat sinister minor-key riff in between. It's good, but it's an hors d'oeuvre relative to what would come after, after Denvil's would-be music career ended with a positive pregnancy test. The year 1981 held great potential for Tap, as Yisrael latched on to the rap sound that was blowing up in the Bronx and Harlem. He brought in a crew, the Fabulous 3 MCs, and immediately set about finding a female crew to complement them. He turned up Denette ""Missy D"" Scott and charged her with getting a group together. The final Melody Crew included Tanya ""Lady T"" Barns, a member of Kurtis Blow's crew and no small potato in the early rap world. Don't Stop includes one track from each crew, and they're each hugely entertaining slices of live-band disco rap that plays nicely alongside Sugar Hill's early sides. Yisrael attempted to shop Missy Dee's ""Missy Missy Dee"", but never came to satisfactory terms with any prospective label. In the process, he completely neglected the Fabulous 3 MCs, who left bitterly. After a few months of failing to find a home for the Missy Dee track, Yisrael simply moved on, leaving the Melody Crew to break up on its own. At this point, Redd entered the fold and Yisrael brought on veteran performer Arnie Love, pairing him with two Lovettes for a clutch of fantastic disco-funk tracks. ""Breakout"" has a sick rhythm track, deft arrangement, and outstanding instrumental hook, ""Invisible Wind"" springs from a barreling, horn-laden intro into a sharp if somewhat poorly mixed disco jam, and the other offerings follow in a similar vein. If success was as simple as making a good recording, we'd all know who Arnie Love was, but Jeremiah Yisrael apparently neglected to promote and distribute the handful of Arnie Love 12""s that were produced, though it could have been considered progress that they were pressed at all. Love fell quickly into the rearview mirror as Yisrael threw himself into his next singer, Jackie Stoudemire. If you know the name, it's because she had a club hit in 1994 with ""Appreciate"", long after her association with Tap ended. During her time with Tap, she never even sniffed a niche chart. She was an associate of Slick Rick and Dana Dane, but Yisrael didn't try her out on any rap songs, instead sticking with the late-period disco he'd recorded with Arnie Love. He even resurrected a few songs from his work with Love, including ""Invisible Wind"". Her version is much slicker and far more chart-ready, but it wasn't to be: Stoudemire had been made to join Yisrael's temple, and clearly wasn't interested in its message of women's subservience to men. Though they continued to record in spite of this, producing the super-smooth choral disco track ""Guilty"" and the funky would-be floor-filler ""Don't Stop Dancin'"". A few Stoudemire 12""s were pressed, but true to form, flopped spectacularly from a lack of promotion and distribution. Redd became a victim of the AIDS epidemic in 1983, taking his sure hand in the studio with him. Yisrael simply didn't have the skill at a mixing board he needed to continue, and he dismissed Stoudemire. Love was still around but frustrated that he was clearly going nowhere. He ultimately changed his performing name and jumped ship, scoring a very minor hit with a song called ""I'm Out of Your Life"". Yisrael had just a few more trips to the studio in him, for a few ballads and an anti-drug rap song, all deemed unworthy of inclusion here in the liners. All told, it's kind of remarkable that any good music came out of the Tap story. On paper, it looks like a classic case of ambition exceeding ability, and on the business end it certainly was that. But on the musical end, enough things coalesced just right to create a unique body of work that's only now being properly exposed. Most of the recordings are endearingly rough, and the wild story and generous artwork that accompany it give it a more coherent feel than it had even in real life.","The Numero Group sets its sights on New York's Tap label, whose ultra-obscure sides from the early 1980s explore the intersection between late-period disco and early rap.

"Sorry Ma, Forgot to Take Out the Trash / Stink / Hootenanny / Let It Be",The Replacements,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b5d1b1335d7bf169a971/1:1/w_160/908d55e8.jpg,2008-04-21 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11676-sorry-ma-forgot-to-take-out-the-trash-stink-hootenanny-let-it-be/,Rhino,"Their persona is so well defined: The Replacements were the working-class kids bursting with talent but always ready to squander it; the bratty wise guys with a sensitive streak who refused to play by the rules. But the group's persona has a distancing effect for those who are new to the band. There's never been a shortage of thirty and fortysomethings reminiscing about the 'Mats. You read about the sloppily brilliant live performances, the massive quantities of beer consumed, the backstage hijinks; questionable theories are proffered, something about how this band should, if there were any justice in the world, have had pop hits and been on the radio. You hear such things from the people who were there, man, and it's tempting to dismiss the Replacements as a Gen X nostalgia trip and turn your attention to some unexplored corner of post-punk, maybe a boundary-pushing band with an experimental bent. The idea of the Replacements has a lot to do with why they've endured, and as archetypes go, it's a compelling one. But sometimes it gets in the way. It'd be nice if these reissues from Rhino, which remaster and generously expand upon the band's four early records for their hometown imprint Twin/Tone, can bring us back to what the Replacements were: a creative, smart, silly, exuberant, and often hilarious rock'n'roll band. Rhino has done everything right with these records, giving them the sort of treatment they deserve. The liner notes and documentation are detailed; the bonus cuts generous and well chosen. This crucial part of the Replacements story is finally available in all its detail, and hopefully, it'll help us hear the music again in a fresh way. There's a lot worth exploring. Hearing these records again, after having the originals in mothballs for quite a while, has been a revelation. It's not that they're top-to-bottom great (well, except for one of them, but more on that in a sec), because the Replacements weren't really that kind of act. But boy, they had songs and they could play, right from the start. Before these reissues, when someone would say that the band peaked with their first album, 1981's Sorry Ma, Forgot to Take Out the Trash, I'd assume they were either: 1) a serial contrarian, 2) someone who finds punk rock to be music's greatest expression, or 3) crazy. Surely, the Replacements improved as they went. But now, returning to these records after so long, the ""debut is best"" take finally makes some sense. I don't agree with this assessment, not by a long shot, but I can understand why someone might. For a supposedly sloppy and tossed-off record, Sorry Ma comes across as weirdly majestic and strikingly consistent. Also, amusing: singer Paul Westerberg's self-deprecating liner notes, which helped launch the Replacements myth, suggest that he might have had second career writing comedy: ""This song is proof that Chris Mars is one of the best drummers we could find at the time,"" he says of ""Otto"". As the short, sharp tracks tick off, each is immediately arresting. If Mothers Against Drunk Driving hadn't formed the year before, the invigorating and dangerous jolt of ""Takin a Ride"" might have served as the organization's catalyst; ""Customer"" is comical fast-talking portrait of an instant crush; ""Shiftless When Idle"" is an early statement of purpose. Bob Stinson can't wait to bust out his searing solos. Everything sounds loose, live, and brimming with energy. Over 18 songs, only a couple are less than great. Among the 13 bonus tracks, the highlight is the four-song demo from 1980 the band originally gave to Twin/Tone's Peter Jesperson, hoping to get some club gigs. I'm trying to imagine the excitement when he popped it in his tape deck and heard ""Raised in the City"", with its relentless drive and chugga-chugga riff and a 20-year-old Westerberg sounding like he already knew a hell of a lot about it melody. No wonder Jesperson became their manager. Then came Stink, the quickie EP follow-up from 1982. The cover's subtitle used to say ""'Kids Don't Follow' Plus Seven"" and its expanded version now reads ""'Kids Don't Follow' Plus 11"". Well, it's true: ""Kids Don't Follow"" is much better than these other songs. This is their true-blue punk record, and, while they pull it off, they sound too one-dimensional. The songs are entertaining, with titles alone that are good for a chuckle: ""Fuck School""; ""White and Lazy""; ""Dope Smokin' Moron""; ""God Damn Job"". You can guess how they go without even hearing them; it's a record for a single mood. Some the outtakes are actually better: There's a great cover of Hank Williams' ""Hey, Good Lookin"" that was a live staple of the time, and their disemboweling of ""(We're Gonna) Rock Around the Clock"" is worth a few laughs. Stink is an important piece of the puzzle, but less interesting on its own. Hootenanny is occasionally mentioned as the Replacements finest moment, the precursor to Let It Be that is funnier, more tossed-off, (i.e., more ""Replacements"") and also the most diverse offering in the band's catalogue. No argument on the latter; this thing is all over the place, and it has one example of just about everything they ever did. But too much of it sounds purposeless, the band amusing themselves rather than the listener. Some tracks have the whiff of something that would have been OK as B-sides, but sound underwhelming on an album proper. The title track isn't nearly as funny as it thinks it is; ""Mr. Whirly"", which mixes snippets of ""Strawberry Fields Forever"", ""Oh! Darlin'"", and ""The Twist"", is clever but skippable; ""Lovelines"", in which Westerburg half-sings personals ads while the band plays a peppy tune behind him, is infectious in the way that hearing someone else laugh makes you laugh, but it's also easy to forget. All that said: ""Color Me Impressed"" is possibly the best of the 10 or so proper Replacements Anthems, the moody ""Willpower"" improves on Stink's ""Go"", and ""Run It"" is as intense and joyous as any of the rave-ups on the debut. Bonus tracks here are also strong, mostly loud, fast, and snotty, with the exception of the bluesy acoustic demo ""Bad Worker"", about giving minimum effort for minimum wage. Essential for fans, but not the place to start. Hootenanny's ""Within Your Reach"" found Westerberg stretching out and trying a love song of sorts, but it would take one more record before he really hit his stride with this sort of material. The leap in songwriting on Let It Be, the final Twin/Tone album, is dazzling. As a record, it's both simpler and more complicated than anything that came before. You want hardcore? ""We're Comin' Out"" is the most intense punk song they ever made. A no-frills declaration of love? You can't get much more concise than ""Favorite Thing"". There's the perceptive ""I Will Dare"", which seems like it's about a relationship but is also about the band ready to take on the world; the wailing ""Unsatisfied"", with its disarmingly direct expression of frustration. All of the contradictions and wild mood swings of youth can be found here somewhere. Let It Be is widely praised as an independent rock classic and one of the finest albums of the 1980s, but before I started listening to this set, I didn't expect to rate it so highly. I kept thinking of songs that even fans of the record consider insignificant, namely ""Tommy Gets His Tonsils Out"", the cover of Kiss' ""Black Diamond"", the near-instrumental ""Seen Your Video"" and the silly ""Gary's Got a Boner"". Surely, this was filler. But the more I listened, the more I realized that all these songs have their place, and each does work on the album that needs doing. Film critics like to speak of emotionally charged moments being ""earned"" by carefully laid groundwork in character development. The farther Westerberg went out on a limb with songs like ""Androgynous"" (all of a sudden he's the indie rock Cole Porter, looking out for the shy, arty types that didn't fit in) and ""Sixteen Blue"" (the ultimate articulation of teenage angst), the more empathy he showed and the more he needed ballast. The dumb songs offer relief and make the ballads hit that much harder. They also rip. It helps that this is the best-sounding record they ever made, and the rockers pummel like never before. The mix is clear; the guitars tear the space in half when they need to and ring clearly when they don't, when they throw in unusual instruments, they work. The six outtakes-- a couple of covers (of T. Rex and, uh, the DeFranco Family featuring Tony DeFranco), and two choice originals-- are strong, but they wouldn't have fit on a record that doesn't waste a note. Let It Be is, in its own way, perfect. Being a fuck-up with a good heart is endearing when you're young; if you've not changed by the time you hit your late twenties, well, you're probably just pretty much a fuck-up, and eventually, you become annoying. All the contradictions in the Replacements' music, and in Westerberg's songwriting, are not something you can easily carry into adulthood, which is partly why the band would run into some trouble later on. But none of that matters here, when they were young and understood so much about youth. People change, but records don't, and that's part of what makes them great. They're frozen in place, ready to be found by people who need them. And if you haven't found these yet-- well, I'm jealous.",,9.4,
Reality Check,The Teenagers,by: Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a1c75e6ef95969320280/1:1/w_160/009f770b.jpg,2008-04-21 06:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11400-reality-check/,Merok,"Don't wanna live in America no more? Try living within the detritus of our aging teenage mass culture. In the 1950s, the Teenagers were a doo-wop group who backed up Frankie Lymon on ""Why Do Fools Fall in Love""; the Teenagers of today are a London- and Paris-based foursome whose songs work on the innocently sleazy assumption that ""Beverly Hills 90210"", American Pie, and Nada Surf's ""Popular"" showed U.S. high schoolers as they really are. Their 2007 single ""Homecoming"" ingeniously encapsulates this approach, pairing Jonathan Richman's wide eyes with the busily groping hands of Serge Gainsbourg. After a handful of other singles and remixes (including an excellent one of Simian Mobile Disco's ""It's the Beat""), full-length debut Reality Check still can't match the Teenagers' first time, but it shows a developing group with their own distinct take on misspent youth in the era of free internet porn. As with Art Brut or the Streets, their sound-- equal parts raw and mechanical, and a little lacking in variation-- isn't so much the point but it definitely fits their outlook. Smirking, French-accented lo-fi vocals earnestly sneer; tinny electronic beats, New Order guitars, and gleaming synths form a backing that's halfway between dance-punk and mall-punk. ""I fucked her-- it was wild/ She's such a slut,"" frontman Quentin Delafon bluntly asserts on ""Homecoming"", before his American cheerleader tells the girls, ""It was perfect, a dream come true/ Just like a song by Blink-182."" So, it's a 1990s revival in a time of 1980s revival (and free internet porn). When it's good, Reality Check can be Anthony-Michael-Hall-gets-Jennifer-Love-Hewitt good. ""Love No"", also given an optimistic electro-house remix by Spain's Delorean, is another ""Homecoming""-style two-part conversation, with Delafon this time standing in for both boy and girl (""That movie Showgirls? I can't believe you're watching it again"") as a battle of the sexes ends in cynical ceasefire. ""But It's OK to stay with you/ I'm not in love, oh, oh,"" he sings. On ""Feeling Better"", which could be the Teenagers' theme song if there weren't already one called ""We Are the Teenagers"" on their Fuck Nicole EP, they humbly request your obsession, quote ""Heal the World"", and sell you their T-shirt. ""Starlett Johansson"" lists the birthdate, place, and life story of a certain Tom Waits-covering starlet. The Teenagers can be sensitive, too, like when asking what-ifs on the slow, gliding ""Wheel of Fortune"" about a world without Ben Affleck, or whether you would still do them if they had unibrows. It's not always this good, and not just because that can all get to be slightly too much to take in larger than EP-sized doses. ""III"" amps up only to shout its ignorance a few times too shrilly. ""French Kiss""-- hey, wait, I get it! ...French class! Sure, early song ""Fuck Nicole"" does have me cursing at total strangers, but I prefer ""Homecoming"" because it doesn't have this shade of menace. ""Sunset Beach"" brutally murders Jeff Buckley; ""End of the Road"" is slow, but not a slow jam. ""Make It Happen"" isn't about it, but it does yield this significant couplet: ""And if we tell lies, we'll look at you straight in the eyes."" Did you hear? He fucked her.",,6.9,
So Embarrassing,Capillary Action,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b5115e6ef959693226f5/1:1/w_160/372c9356.jpg,2008-04-18 06:00:05,Jazz,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11266-so-embarrassing/,Pangaea,"Capillary Action's debut album, Fragments, was an instrumental guitar showcase brimming with virtuosity and violent rhythmic shifts. I think I could be forgiven for expecting more of the same from So Embarrassing, but holy confounded expectations, is this ever a different album from its predecessor. Are there still wicked rhythmic turns, hints of jazz, and mind-bending guitar runs? Sure, but this time they're all subordinated to songs-- the first thing you hear on this album is guitarist Jonathan Pfeffer's voice, singing over a breakneck but fairly straightforward rock beat. Pfeffer is now clearly playing with the tension between straight-ahead indie rock and spastic, mathy composition. Opener ""Gambit"" has those basic verses, but breaks them up with ragged odd-metered riffs, alternating in a way that makes each new 4/4 verse sound even more propulsive. A similar approach guides the album's best song, ""Elevator Fuck"". The band uses a string synth and what I think is a real trombone to inject sweetly melodic but rhythmically strange phrases between verse lines that seem as though they should disrupt the flow of the song but don't. Whereas the band's first album reserved the middle for its most introspective moments, this one gives us the aggressive experiment ""Badlands"", which features the sounds of Pfeffer's breathing cut up and made into a brutal rhythm. It's one of several tracks to use extreme dynamic range to great effect. ""Pocket Protection Is Essential"", for instance, sets quietly melodic sections against the heaviest, loudest bits on the album-- it's genuinely startling the first time the shouted vocals and pounding drums crash in, and not much less startling each time after that. Closer ""Self-Released"" uses all these techniques to create a collage of a song that has the pacing of a brawl, with quiet moments to catch your breath followed by furious passages of pounding rhythm and dissonant swells. The album as a whole extends the collage feel, with each track flowing easily into the next to make a kind of suite. The songs aren't inseparable from each other, though; quite a few of them work well on their own, and this owes much to the band's overall stylistic re-orientation. Pfeffer's even, baritone vocals add a strong melodic center for the listener and put the instrumental freakouts in context. So Embarrassing is a bold change in direction for Capillary Action, but one that pays off as well as one could hope.","After debuting with an album of instrumentals, Capillary Action incorporate vocals and play with the tension between straight-ahead indie rock and spastic, mathy composition.

The Show,eMC,by: Ben Westhoff,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b50ab1335d7bf169a83e/1:1/w_160/0f85dcd9.jpg,2008-04-18 06:00:03,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11259-the-show/,M3,"Where do rappers go when they die? Or, where do critically heralded, next-big-things rappers go when their dreams don't pan out? They get jobs, get married, and, if we're lucky, join forces and cut an epic, heart-breakingly honest update on their lives every now and then. The Show is the debut album from eMC, which calls itself a ""supergroup""; many critics would concur. The lineup features 41-year-old Juice Crew vet Masta Ace-- who has five solid solo albums, a few scattered hits, and Eminem on his tip-- and old Lyricist Lounge hands Wordsworth and Punchline, who, like Ace, are former New Yorkers who don't live in the city anymore. But the show is stolen (no pun intended) by the least known member of the group, Milwaukee MC Stricklin, whose high-pitched, sometimes spastic rhymes are laced with self-deprecation, naivety, and humor. I found him annoying for about five minutes, but now can't get enough of his giddy verses, like this one on ""Borrow You"": ""When I first saw you ma I was like/ 'Now, this a girl I can't mess with/ Out my league like them dudes I play chess with'/ Then I was like, 'What the hell, let me test it/ Hi, my name's Stricklin but you can call me interested/ You got a man, but he not like me'/ She said, 'Man? What, nigga? Yo, I got, like, three.'"" Sixteen meaty songs strong, the album is part slightly-fictionalized tour diary, part rumination on unrealized success and finding fun in the day-to-day. Its details are so mundane at times that those used to hip-hop melodrama may be taken aback. ""Got to town at like a quarter to three/ 3:30, still in the lobby, waiting on my room key/ 4:00, I'm in my room watching TV,"" Strick raps with comic urgency on the title track. Next, Ace tells us that he has stretched, showered, and shaved. They drive to the venue, do a sound check, and Strick takes a shit ""at 9:20."" They eat some chicken and then perform. That's it. It's a Sopranos-like non-ending, and Ladybug Mecca's robotic, GPS-voice chorus just makes the whole thing crazier. ""Feel It"" sketches the group members' lives without self-pity or glorification. ""In this ice-cold world, better get ya'll coats/ I'm a husband, a father, and a football coach,"" raps Ace, and Strick adds: ""You might be sick of me complaining and hearing me sob/ But it's kind of hard trying to juggle my career and my job/ Cause whether it's the m-i-c or an IV/ They be calling me, 'Notorious EMT.'"" That's just sick, and Money Harm's chorus may well bring you to tears if your girl's not around. The album's consistent, unpretentious beats have been culled from producers from all over the world (Croatia, the UK, Houston). Standouts include Quincey Tones' layered, r&b flavored jams, ""Traffic"" and ""U Let Me Grow"", The ARE's ""Leak It Out"", a disco and golden era-hybrid banger, and Nicolay on ""E.M.C. (What It Stand For?)"", a rattlesnake shake charmer. But with so many disarmingly candid confessions on the disc, it's sometimes hard to concentrate on the music. Only the rhymes from Punchline, who said in an interview that he brings ""that 'nigga' element"" to the group, contain elements of rap's typically incredible braggadocio (""I'm with these two chicks, about to cop me some kicks""). But even he is honest more often than not. ""I wish I could spend my life in reverse,"" he says, suddenly, on ""Feel It"". Still, ""I'm here, after the smoke clears, like a firefighter.""","Rap supergroup features 41-year-old Juice Crew vet Masta Ace, Lyricist Lounge hands Wordsworth and Punchline, and Milwaukee MC Stricklin; together, they've produced an epic, heart-breakingly honest update on their lives.

We Appreciate You,The Plastic Constellations,by: Zach Baron,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b5bcb1335d7bf169a952/1:1/w_160/2a5d16da.jpg,2008-04-18 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11415-we-appreciate-you/,Frenchkiss,"A phoenix, Don Quixote, and Sancho Panza were just a few of the enemies the Plastic Constellations downed on 2006's Crusades. Halfway through the record, the stage becomes an outright battlefield, the kick drum transforms into an earthquake, the bass apes a typhoon, and all four Minnesotans eventually go down fighting, only to be reunited at the three-quarter mark. Back to work in 2008, the Constellations get topical--spurred by global warming, the quartet fight famine with fistfuls of flames, and that's not on the song called ""Flames and Rain"". So the Plastic Constellations are without a doubt the most disaster-archetype-fixated non-metal band of the past 10 years. It was as wobbly 14-year-olds that this band started, and they've since been slowed by the hydra of four years of college-related sabbaticals and a recently declared ""indefinite hiatus on the horizon."" Their jagged turn through post-punk has now spanned more than a decade, and their Drive Like Jehu/Refused/Les Savy Fav/Fugazi shrapnel finally, in their relative maturity, sounds a lot like it did one album prior-- a first. The back of the Plastic Constellations baseball card will now forever read that the band gang tackles a ""la la la"" chorus better than a thousand Murder by Deaths, alliterates with the best of 'em, and channels cabaretish gothic horror with more conviction than either than Fall Out Boy or MCR. The record starts with a drawn-out gang vocal and ends with a drawn-out gang vocal: first they escape from their boring lives (""Stay that Way""), then they make a bunch of friends and call it a day (""So Many Friends""), presumably a more or less career-arc summary that could apply to every band ever. Throughout We Appreciate You, the Constellations gather hopefully in the night, post up on rooftops and in fortresses, get nostalgic for the basements of their past, and fall in love with the very same flames they'd with whom they'd just been fighting. Then they realize they have only one life to live and so stop sleeping, find some answers and, in the finale, gather in the backyard for first day of the rest of their lives. (Coincidentally, this plot is identical to that of Be Your Own Pet's Get Awkward, romantic subplots and all.) When Crusades came out in 2006, the Constellations got lumped in with the Pearls & Brass and Swords of the world, but you don't get the sense anybody in the Plastic Constellations ever listened to much metal. The sidewinding guitar at the beginning of ""Disastrophe"" is more Jehu than Jesu, and ""Perched on a Porch"" starts with a tangled drum creep that could've been cribbed right off a UOA record. The band's general dynamic tilt is a trebly scream-- they may even get a bit teary on the Native Nod-ish ""Heat Knocker""-- and ""Floated Down and Flew Around"" has a ska-climatic horn outro, hardly tough guy stuff.

Magnetic Morning EP,Magnetic Morning,by: Nitsuh Abebe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b5bd9d034d5c69bf5090/1:1/w_160/95ff6ff4.jpg,2008-04-18 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11416-magnetic-morning-ep/,iTunesDH,"There's nothing the least bit wrong with the constituent parts of Magnetic Morning. Sam Fogarino hails from Interpol, where his fierce, punchy drumming tends to sell songs every bit as much as the hooks do-- and as the eldest of the bunch, he's probably also the most likely to know a lot about the 1990s shoegazer acts they occasionally borrow from. Then there's Adam Franklin, who actually is from a 90s shoegazer act: Swervedriver, whose albums added a touch of hard-rock bombast to a scene that was often a lot more comfortable, pillowy, and dreamy. The two were introduced in New York by a mutual friend, and set about making music together-- deep, dark, spacious rock music-- and... Well, it's turned out awfully bland, is the thing. This EP seems to suffer from the problem that happens with a lot of very professional rock guys, where loads of attention get paid to subtleties and technical work-- the right guitar tone, the deep ""feel"" of the drum groove, the space and reverb in the production-- but a giant vacuum gets left around it: There's plenty of tastefulness, but not much in the way of hooks, movement, tension, spice, stand-out songwriting, stand-out style, stimulation, inspiration, or engagement value for the listener. (And that list could have been longer.) These songs let Fogarino drop into drumming with a lot more nuance than the boxy drive of Interpol, and Franklin surrounds that with all manner of drizzly, sweeping guitar tones. Chord sequences always turn in the smart direction; transitions always get scripted with the fluidity of people who know what they're doing. But apart from ""Don't Go to the Dream State"", which takes on an intriguingly spooky 1960s movie-soundtrack feel, this stuff just plods, like a high-minded band still missing a frontman. Which is odd: Franklin is a frontman, and yet the vocals really are a problem-- a kind of muddy, meandering moan that's unlikely to excite even Swervedriver fans. That band usually brought enough edge and speed to the music that Franklin's low-energy mumble was an ideal fit; pair it with poorly focused melodies and this nondescript lumbering, though, and it has a hard time carrying the weight. This makes for some odd results-- say, the way the instrumental reconfiguration of their song ""Cold War Kids"" (yeah, no, really) feels more engaging than the vocal version, or the way their cover of the Kinks' ""The Way Love Used to Be"" feels vague and aimless, despite their having punched up the original with tricky drumming and clearer organization. This is only an EP we're talking about here-- including a cover and some reconfiguring of a feature song-- so maybe it's not a lot to judge by; maybe they have the makings of a decent album tucked away somewhere. On the other hand, these two surely had some idea their pedigrees would get them plenty of attention from the first release: If they had better cards than these, you'd think they'd want to lead with them, right?","Interpol's Sam Fogarino teams with Swervedriver's Adam Franklin for a selection of songs focused on subtleties and technical work at the expense of, well, a whole lot of other stuff.

Skin Turns to Glass / Bliss Torn from Emptiness,Nadja,by: Cosmo Lee,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b593b1335d7bf169a90c/1:1/w_160/7c17d549.jpeg,2008-04-18 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11668-skin-turns-to-glassbliss-torn-from-emptiness/,NOTHingnessNOTHingness,"Nadja are almost overwhelmingly prolific. Last year, the Toronto-based duo had seven releases; this year, they'll put out three studio full-lengths and five 12""s. Such profusion risks diminishing returns. (Justin Broadrick's Jesu and Japanese sludge rockers Boris have both lost considerable mystique with similar fecundity.) In Nadja's case, abundance is particularly counterproductive. Their ambient shoegazer metal is deep and expansive, best experienced unhurriedly. A deluge of it only suggests it is easier to make than focused pop songs. But that makes it no less valid. Nadja may not have songs, but they have sound, so much that it almost obviates the need for structure. (Jesu and the Angelic Process use similar sounds, but both are more song-oriented.) Underneath their swirling distortion, shoegazer bands like Ride and Swervedriver were really pop bands. Nadja abstract those groups' ecstatic moments-- when pop became pow-- and dilate them into long meditations. The result is like the ""bullet time"" effect in The Matrix. Nadja freeze slow, cyclic chords into place, then embellish them on all sides. Around these chords hover counter-melodies, buzzing textures, and vocal fragments in an overtone-rich fog, a true ""storm in heaven."" As a cloud, this sound is compelling, but it's most effective as an effluent. Two recent reissues illlustrate this. Nadja mastermind Aidan Baker has remade 2003's Skin Turns to Glass and 2005's Bliss Torn from Emptiness with today's technology; a marked progression is evident between the records. Both have peak-valley dynamics, but Skin Turns to Glass wields them more coarsely. After slowly building drones for three minutes, a drum machine stumbles in. Huge, fuzzed-out guitars lumber through slowed-down Creation Records chords. Baker piles on layers of whining, soaring textures; celestial whispers slide over the title track like a winter wind. It's beauty through brute force. This reissue tacks on a 28-minute ambient track, which ends with intriguingly chaotic death metal. However, its wispy initial 26 minutes could have been cut. As with many other reissues today, more is less. Bliss Torn from Emptiness is darker and more nuanced. It's one long track divided into three suites that flow into each other. Their drones patiently and organically grow into teeming masses of frequencies. The low end is hulking, the midrange is gleaming, and static and feedback swarm the high end. It's like a dust storm in a cathedral. Mournful chords flood in, as sheet metal abrasions screech above. The din subsides to a single chord, as a female syllable repeats and over again. Baker then heats the chord to bioluminescence; an iron-clad drum machine rumbles underneath. The percussion is pure Godflesh; Baker cites Broadrick as an influence, but he's schooling the master now. Textures push left and right against the edges of the stereo spectrum. Disembodied vocals bubble up in agonized rapture. This is the aftershock of My Bloody Valentine's Loveless-- and it hits much harder.","Remaking two of their out-of-print albums with the latest technology, Nadja abstract the ecstatic moments of shoegaze-- when pop became pow-- and dilate them into long meditations.

The Blood Pressure Sessions,Naked on the Vague,by: Aaron Leitko,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b56b13d197565213ac6e/1:1/w_160/0b671873.jpg,2008-04-17 06:00:05,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11342-the-blood-pressure-sessions/,Dual PloverDual Plover,"You could argue that Sydney, Australia's Naked on the Vague are a bit of a 1980s-retro band, but only if you're thinking about the dark side of the decade-- no wave instead of new wave. Their first full length, The Blood Pressure Sessions, is mired in Reagan-era dread. Released last year on the Australian label Dual Plover and now given a U.S. vinyl treatment by Siltbreeze, the record drips with hollow contempt and dull scorn. It's the Southern Hemisphere's dark photo-negative answer to Times New Viking's Paisley Reich. Comprised of keyboardist Lucy Cliché, bassist Matthew P. Hopkins, and a drum machine, Naked on the Vague churn out stripped-down and monotonous post-punk. The rhythms are primitive; the most animated songs rely on little more than the incessant thud of a bass drum. Likewise, any pretense of harmony is chucked out the window. As a result, it's easy draw a straight line from a Naked on the Vague song like ""All Aboard""-- with it's slanted riff and stone-age drum loop-- to the esoteric scuzz of the past. But although Naked on the Vague wear some influences on their sleeves-- whether that's downtown noise, Flying Nun Records, or Huggy Bear LPs-- The Blood Pressure Sessions is more than just skilled homage. The band's take on post-punk is familiar but also tight and contemporary. Naked on the Vague aren't abrasive in the Dead C sense, out to fully lobotomize their audience with skree and treble. In fact, when compared to the production value of other records released on Siltbreeze-- a label whose reputation was built on shrill hiss and white noise-- The Blood Pressure Sessions is startlingly clear and intensely silent. ""All Aboard"" is sheared down to the most meager of ingredients-- one circular drumbeat, a bass riff, and a and a malnourished keyboard melody. There's nothing else, not even amp hiss. But all of the negative space enhances the pervading sense of desolation. None of the instruments resonate and each lyric hangs in the air for only a moment before vanishing back into the void, as if the band are performing in a vacuum chamber. Naked on the Vague also have a penchant for dubby textures that have more in common with the current Fuck It Tapes school of psychedelic music than to no wave. ""Brown Sun/Sydney Lane Road"" is six-minutes of clanking abstract percussion and flat vocal drones. There are accordion trills and lonesome trumpet farts thrown into the mix, but the sounds are hardly lush. Rather, they're restrained, like something from a claustrophobic horror-movie soundtrack. These moments alone don't divide them from the weirdos of yesteryear. Where no wave had a marked self-important streak, Naked on the Vague are self-aware. Although dark, their lyrics seem to drift around at the edge of black comedy. ""Horse, he's sick/ Horse so sick,"" sings Lucy Cliché during the appropriately titled ""The Horse, He's Sick"". We're talking some distance from Michael Gira yelling, ""All I can do is kill"" in straight-faced earnest. It's stupid to dismiss or embrace Naked on the Vague as merely the product of their influences. The Blood Pressure Sessions is an enhancement of an idea started a long time ago. During the 80s, bands responded to poverty, vacuous culture, and bad government with music that was appropriately nihilistic. It's not surprising that Naked on the Vague have been able to tap into that mindset 20 years later; the more things change, the more they stay the same.","Australian band making its way to the States via the Stiltbreeze label churns out primitive, stripped-down post-punk with a touch of dark humor.

Uneasy Flowers,Autistic Daughters,by: Marc Masters,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b5a59d034d5c69bf5071/1:1/w_160/72759212.jpg,2008-04-17 06:00:04,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11394-uneasy-flowers/,Kranky,"Uneasy Flowers, the second album by Autistic Daughters, is an incremental improvement over their fine 2004 debut Jealousy and Diamond. But any other degree of advancement would feel inappropriate, since this group's music deals in small steps and minute shifts. This can make for a sleepy listen-- sometimes it even sounds like the trio has drifted off into musical unconsciousness. But more often this album is like a quiet dream, filled with moods and images that linger past the end of each song. That effect combined with the fact that Autistic Daughters are on Kranky might imply their music is pure ambience. But the trio is actually a song-based entity, relying on vocals, guitars, drums, and some modest electronic effects. The seven tunes here sometimes evoke the soothing drift of Kranky stalwarts like Stars of the Lid. But they're closer sonically to the slow melodies of Low, the soft glitch of the Books, or even Wilco's mellower moments (the alluring bent of Dean Roberts' voice at times recalls Jeff Tweedy). The miniaturist feel of Uneasy Flowers is enhanced by Roberts' lyrics, which explore ideas in subtle shades. Phrases and images recur, tracing the outline of an enigmatic character named Rehana. Through clever repetitions of terms like ""rain,"" ""gin,"" and ""value judgment,"" Roberts paints an impressionist portrait that makes surreal sense. On the title track, over chopped snare hits, he describes an elusive ""it""-- ""tell your brother it's a balancing act""; ""it makes our laughter more easily stomachable""-- without ever fully revealing his subject. Later, on the sparse ""Bird in the Curtain"" and the minimal ""Hotel Exeter Dining Room"", Roberts slyly dodges meaning, singing about uncertainty and awkwardness with apt imprecision. Musically, the songs on Uneasy Flowers are skeletal, offering bare bones where more impatient bands might pile on sonic flesh. Sparse and measured, each tune forms gradually, letting its elements grow into each other like ivy on a wall. This encourages the listener to connect dots and color in shapes that may never actually be there. Not every tune rewards the effort, but enough do, especially ""Gin Over Sour Milk"", the album's masterful midpoint. Over a descending rhythm, Roberts whispers about a pretty obvious choice-- who wouldn't take alcohol over spoiled dairy? But as in most of Autistic Daughters' music, that simplicity hides a more complex idea lying just beneath the surface.","Autistic Daughters here make an incremental improvement over their fine 2004 debut Jealousy and Diamond and, despite being a song-based entity, evoke the soothing drift of fellow Kranky stalwarts like Stars of the Lid.

Dazzle Ships,Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark,by: Tom Ewing,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b5835e6ef959693227a3/1:1/w_160/0ed7d5b9.jpg,2008-04-17 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11363-dazzle-ships/,VirginVirgin,"Dazzle Ships is one of British pop's more notorious flops. It was the follow-up to a major hit album but cut OMD's audience by 90%. It was a mix of new songs, reworked B-Sides, and ""found sound"" experiments, which promised to mix ""ABBA and Stockhausen."" It was named after wartime camouflage boats. It was appallingly reviewed. In fact I don't think you could design a record more ripe for revisionism: It's got a strong backstory, it's as ambitious as it is catchy and it even has a gorgeous Peter Saville sleeve. Luckily, you don't need a contrarian streak to love it. The 25 years between release and this reissue have done Dazzle Ships the world of good: The weaknesses of 1983 don't seem that way today. Nobody now cares how nerdily singer Andy McCluskey dressed or how gawkily he danced, and while his bare-nerved sea lion yelp was a liability in an era of chilly reserve it sounds messily, modishly emotional now. More importantly, Dazzle Ships seems a lot less radical than it did on release: The Kraftwerk records and musique concrète it obviously borrowed from have been more fully absorbed into pop music. You'll have heard uglier noises than the title track's mechanical grindings and foghorn blurts, and stranger constructions than the layered robot voices on ""ABC Auto-Industry"". Those songs won't sound like clumsy shock-tactics to a new listener, just more parts in the album's sad, effective synth-pop collage. Dazzle Ships was born out of writer's block, and given the record's jumbled origins it's dangerous to claim too much thematic consistency. But the various interludes-- as well as the ships and robots, there are radio callsigns and sampled speaking clocks-- are crucial in building coherence and the transitions from experiment to song are well-handled. Those servile robot voices sound a lot more sinister alongside the grinning scissor-dance that opens the record's hookiest track, ""Genetic Engineering"". When the clocks on ""Time Zones"" unify and their final bleeps announce mournful closer ""Of All the Things We've Made"", it's like McCluskey has stepped outside history for a moment, to deliver a gloomy summing-up. The passing of time has had an impact on Dazzle Ships' content as well as its style. This isn't a concept album so much as an album made by a concept band-- all of OMD's early work digs into ideas about history and technology, and Dazzle Ships is no exception. But time has a tendency to turn technology into history. As ""This Is Helena"" clatters perkily along a voice chirps ""This is Helena! Music for your tape recorder!"" The first CD players went on sale six months before this album: Some of the reissue's buyers won't even have seen a tape recorder. ""This Is Helena"" now sounds as archaic as ""Telegraph""'s rousing celebration of the dawn of a mass communication age. Similarly, Dazzle Ships used to juxtapose World War imagery with the contemporary ideological struggle between communism and capitalism: now both are historical, and the sorrow in a song like ""International"" is the sadness of old sepia photographs. Dazzle Ships' reference points span the 20th century, and the record works today as a time-capsule farewell to it. Even the poppiest songs sound endearingly old-fashioned and awkward, more clockwork than digital, and the remaster is faithful to this machine-age charm. The extra tracks don't add much-- they're B-Sides to B-Sides, after all, with the extended ""Genetic Engineering"" 12"" the only standout. But history has done its own remix job on Dazzle Ships, and the result is a richer, more unified album than anyone in 1983 could have imagined.","One of British pop's more notorious flops, OMD's misunderstood gem is also ripe for revisionism: It's got a strong backstory, it's as ambitious as it is catchy, and it even has a gorgeous Peter Saville sleeve.

SVN FNGRS,Black Francis,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b5b05e6ef959693227ed/1:1/w_160/a55230a0.jpg,2008-04-17 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11405-svn-fngrs/,Cooking Vinyl,"Last year, Frank Black returned to his Pixies-era stage name, Black Francis, for the first time in his solo career. It seemed to be a way of marking a change in direction, steering away from the rootsy rock of the Catholics and his sedate recordings with legendary session musicians and back toward surging, punk-inspired weird-rock. His first album after the change, Bluefinger, didn't quite get it all right, but it was a good first step, and SVN FNGRS, a mini-LP that grew out of the sessions for a Bluefinger B-side, takes one more step in the right direction. It was recorded in less than a week with just a bassist and a drummer, and it sounds like Black for the most part just let things come to him and made the most natural record he could. In seven songs and about 20 minutes, he briefly touches on nearly every territory he's explored in his career. The record is led off by the oddest thing Black has done since the mid-1990s, the funked-up freak out ""The Seus"", which finds him kind of rapping in places and generally stumbling through a noble experiment with pretty unsatisfying results. ""Seus"" is never defined for us-- I was sort of hoping it would turn out to be a tribute to Doug Seus, trainer and owner of Hollywood animal actor Bart the Bear-- but Black's heartily yelped ""I am the great Seus!"" refrain doesn't seem to worry over it. After tripping out of the gate, though, the record picks itself up nicely with ""Garbage Heap""-- the best song he's done in ages. I don't think it's a coincidence that it's also the most Pixies-ish thing he's done in ages, apart from reuniting with the Pixies. The chorus is astounding, with a brilliant, doubled vocal melody featuring Black at the bottom of his range, in sharp contrast to the chorused falsetto he employs in the verse. It's a sharp reminder of what was so damn great about the Pixies in the first place. Their sense of songwriting dynamics was amazing, and it's been missing from a lot of his solo work-- it's great to hear it again. The rest falls into that uneasy space between his Pixies and Catholics days. The vowel-infused title track is great, and with a fuzz guitar it could be some lost 60s garage artifact. Black's sung-spoken verses and catchy, all-out chorus reminds me a bit of the La De Das' ""How Is the Air Up There?"" ""The Tale of Lonesome Fetter"" leans toward the Pixies side of things, riding a weird little groove in the opening verse, but never goes for the jugular, preferring to drop the rhythm entirely for its oddball chorus. ""When They Come to Murder Me"" and ""Half Man"" both retreat to roots rock, and ""Murder Me"" does it well, with a few big hooks-- it would have been the best song on a couple Catholics albums. Black isn't all the way back to his Black Francis form, but he's close. If he has a few more songs like ""Garbage Heap"" rattling around in his head, I hope we get to hear them on his next album, and as much as ""The Seus"" fails in its own right I hope he keeps going out on those limbs, because in the distant past that's where he found some of his best ideas.","Frank Black returns again to his Pixies-era stage name and a change in direction, steering away from the rootsy rock of the Catholics and his sedate recordings with legendary session musicians and back toward surging, punk-inspired weird-rock on this new mini-LP.

Konk,The Kooks,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b5ab9d034d5c69bf507d/1:1/w_160/38e26dd1.jpg,2008-04-17 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11401-konk/,AstralwerksVirgin,"Luke Pritchard has gone on record saying that Konk is his band's ""pop album,"" and initially, I thought he was just talking a gang of shit. Musically, the Kooks have never been the toughest nut to crack, and on the surface, this is a work obsessed with a sense of lineage-- their handle factually references David Bowie, but the album title slyly and phonetically conjures the Kinks, the band these guys try hardest to emulate. And to top it off, the record's namesake is the London studio in which it was recorded; it just so happens the owner is a certain Mr. Ray Davies. Similar scenarios: Lenny Kravitz's Electric Ladyland. Oasis' Abbey Road. But it turns out Pritchard is right after all, because the group's well-selling debut Inside In/Inside Out was a pop album, and the only real difference between itself and Konk is that this one doesn't have a song called ""Jackie Big Tits"" on it. More accurately, it's a Britpop album, meaning it's more than content to offer fingers up to the Albion-extolling NME altar with the same old knucklehead boys-club ethos that, to paraphrase Homer Simpson, likes its beer cold, TV loud, and homosexuals flaming. Take ""Do You Wanna"", which nicks from the Franz Ferdinand song of the sorta-same name with an audacity that's almost admirable, but unlike Alex Kapranos and co. the Kooks have no use for playful ambiguity. ""Do you wanna make love to me?"" asks Pritchard instead, but it's obviously a rhetorical question, because this guy's a rockstar now and you know the drill-- ""I know you want to make love to me,"" he says, but it doesn't come off as Rod Stewart swagger so much as the kind of ugly, self-mythologizing groupie bait we're used to from Kings of Leon. Nope, these guys ain't talkin' 'bout love...except when they are. Which is most of the time. Pritchard has also said ""we make songs for girls,"" certainly a fine goal and probably the purpose of nine out of 10 bands at least, except that most of Konk feels targeted towards some imagined audience instead of being borne of real inspiration. Following ""Do You Wanna"" is ""Gap"", which peppers Tony Hoffer's overactive strings with come-ons like ""please don't go,"" and ""I miss you and I love you and that's true""-- with any modicum of self-awareness, it could've been a lacerating parody of the kind of person who'll say anything to get in your pants. By chopping off several limbs from the Darkness' ""Love Is Only a Feeling""-- the righteous soloing, the lovely pastoral arrangement, Justin Hawkins' ability to totally nail the hook that simultaneously sends up and transcends power balladry-- ""Love It All"" starts us back at square one, offering a sort of lunkheaded acoustic version of the Rapture song of almost the same name. If you hadn't gotten the point by then, what does ""Stormy Weather"" feel like? ""It feels like love, love, love."" By the time that's done, these guys are so drained that they attack ""Sway"" like Our Earthly Pleasures at half mast, ushering in a mostly unmemorable final quarter. At least they're knowledgeable enough to frontload Konk with the most enjoyable tracks, including lead single ""Always Where I Need to Be"", which wisely eschews any of Pritchard's wolf cries with a wordless hook and zippy guitars. But while the vague send-up of an upwardly mobile ""Mr. Maker"" is catchy enough and aimed directly at Parklife pastiche, it just exposes how the rest of this record has a hard-on where Damon Albarn has a heart or a brain. And that will be more than enough for some people, but it shouldn't be with bands like Los Campesinos!, These New Puritans, the Long Blondes, and Glasvegas re-invigorating British indie and challenging the NME's necropolis of complacent, reactionary, and outmoded ideas of ""doing things the right way."" For self-professed straight-shooters like the Kooks, anyone whose greatest influences aren't sex, drugs, and dead white British bands might as well be some blogger in their mom's basement, but Konk feels like a mere cowardly act, a TPS report from a band that strives to be nothing more than British pop's ultimate company men.","The Kooks follow their popular debut Inside In/Inside Out with another record borne of the same old Kinks/Jam boys-club ethos.

But while their first EP recalled the swooning guitar-driven romanticism of artists like Jeff Buckley and early Radiohead, Colour Revolt seemed like a band who could pull it off. The sound felt familiar, but even as the singer reached for his downy-soft upper registers and the guitars choked in their own reverb, the songs had a grittier edge that was distinctive enough to transcend their influences. It's the same band on Plunder, Beg and Curse, but the debut full-length aims high and often misses. They laudably try to be a less predictable band than their forebears, but from the first song onward, it exceeds their reach. ""Naked and Red"" starts with a low vocal, a bare guitar melody, and drums that can't wait for the moment of release, pounding out the bass on every beat. But rather than a big, easy chorus, the band punches in and out intermittently, veering quickly between excitable and languid, and not always in sync with each other-- In Colour Revolt's attempts to take the road less traveled, they seem to belie their better instincts. The slippery ""A Siren"" has riffs that are unpredictable without being memorable, and the vocals ranting without quite earning their catharsis. The distorted vocal and slow pace of ""Elegant View"" wants to simmer dangerously, but its thudding fuzz guitars simply plod, and the less said about the hoarse singing on ""Swamp"", the better. The first half of Plunder is marked by over-emoting, over-playing, and over-compensating. It's a relief when they don't try so hard. On ""See It"", the waves of guitars never overcome the cool control of singer Dude Sir or the guiding hand of his melody. Same goes for ""Moses of the South"", with it's gently insistent rhythm scraped out from a muted acoustic, while the omnipresent glistening guitars merely color the song rather than take the focus. Later songs like ""Ageless Everytime"" and ""Shovel to Ground"" have soaring melodies and rhythms that unfold naturally, and ""What Will Come of Us"" has the open space that lets its bare, simple melody breathe-- but more than that, it's got the swagger that says they're convinced this simple melody will work. Colour Revolt prove here that they're a restless and ambitious band, which may very well lead towards more interesting material in the future, but they're still feeling themselves out and learning what works on Plunder, Beg, and Curse.","After an EP that recalled the swooning guitar-driven romanticism of artists like Jeff Buckley and early Radiohead, Colour Revolt return with their ambitious debut full-length.

"Move Every Muscle, Make Every Sound",De Novo Dahl,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b56313d197565213ac66/1:1/w_160/7deed764.jpg,2008-04-16 05:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11334-move-every-muscle-make-every-sound/,Roadrunner,"De Novo Dahl debuted back in 2005 with Cats & Kittens, a wildly ambitious double album that presented all of its songs twice in drastically altered forms, demonstrating a bold eclecticism. It was a fun record with a lot of alleys to explore and I still listen to it now and then. The thing about debuting like that is that it's hard to go even further on your second album, and so the Nashville band's sophomore offering, Move Every Muscle, Make Every Sound, is significantly pared back and more focused, leaning on the hooky power-pop sound that characterized disc one of the first album. They've also trimmed down from a sextet to a quintet. That basic power-pop framework still has plenty of room for splashes of biting new wave synth, the occasional proggy flourish, a few disco-fied beats, and other touches that keep things interesting from song to song. It's much easier to absorb in just a few listens and is spiked with a few phenomenal high points. The opening two tracks are massive and immediate. ""Shout"" is like American Supergrass, with ooh-ing and aah-ing backup vocals, thick, r&b-informed rhythm section playing and a ridiculously anthemic chorus whose lyrics nod, perhaps unintentionally, to Tears for Fears. The title of ""Heartbreaker"" is aspirational, as Joel J Dahl (aka Joel McAnulty) sings of his desire to crush another person romantically in a glammy croon that has you rooting for him to succeed. Matthew Hungate's wall of sunshine-drenched organ completes the sale. De Novo Dahl does up-tempo very well-- you'd probably have to hate rock'n'roll not to fall for the under-two-minute blast of garage rock organ boisterous group singing that constitutes the new, beefier version of Cats' ""Be Your Man""-- but the variety of slower songs that dot the album have their moments as well. ""Marketplace"" is one of Dahl's finest moments melodically, as he follows the deliberately ascending bassline with a dramatic croon. The song is a stunning centerpiece for the album, and packs more emotional punch than ""Not to Escape"", the album's world-weary closer, which gets a little lost in its own haziness. De Novo Dahl is a detail-oriented band, and they miss few chances to add an ornament or shift the dynamics of a song from a busy arrangement to one with just a few instruments. Even the amount of reverb is varied considerably within songs. ""New Hero"" has dry verses where Dahl does a swooning soul-man thing, but when he's joined by Serai Zeffiro's harmonies on the chorus, they're suddenly in Phil Spector's echo chamber, but it really helps to make the individual sections stand out in your memory. The core song of ""Wishful Thinking"" isn't even that memorable, but Zaffiro's backing vocals add hooks where there were none to shore it up.","Sophomore effort from this Nashville band is pared back and more focused, leaning on the group's more hooky power-pop sound.

The Seldom Seen Kid,Elbow,by: Joshua Klein,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b55513d197565213ac4d/1:1/w_160/24f63dcc.jpg,2008-04-16 05:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11322-the-seldom-seen-kid/,GeffenFiction,"Guy Garvey's got a great voice, and good thing, too. As Elbow have morphed from ambitious but sterile art-rockers to something slightly more visceral, his singing-- equal parts Peter Gabriel and Talk Talk's Mark Hollis-- has been one of the few elements linking the Manchester band's varied output. It's also what's helped Elbow stick out a bit from the choirboy pack of Chris Martin, guy from Keane, et al. At the same time it's not a very rock'n'roll voice, which perhaps explains how, despite some degree of hype, Elbow have always fallen just shy of expectations. Fitting, then, that ""Starlings""-- the first track on Elbow's fourth album The Seldom Seen Kid-- is all about expectations, or at least subverting them. The track begins with an intense cacophony before settling into a vaguely Polynesian groove; a sole orchestral stab blasts out as quickly as it disappears once again. It's a full two minutes before Garvey even sings, and by then one would be forgiven for thinking that, modest melody aside, expectation is all the suspensefully static track has to offer. Yet Elbow are album artists, first and foremost, and in that context it's hard to come up with a better way to ease into The Seldom Seen Kid. Indeed, the similarly exotic second track ""The Bones of You"", with its flamenco underpinnings and Gershwin coda, stands in stark contrast to its predecessor, and it's here that the benefits of Garvey's voice really come into play. Were he to rise to a pained falsetto, ""The Bones of You"" would invite endless comparisons to other, slightly more conspicuous British art-rock bands. That Garvey sounds so comfortable in his skin even as his band sheds its own from track to track helps thread the self-produced disc, suite-like. There are no roman numerals to be found in The Seldom Seen Kid's song titles, nor is there particularly dexterous playing to be heard from track to track, but that's not to discount the disc's mildly proggy vibe. The ebb and flow of the disc feels like it's advancing some unknowable plot, always the sign of a well sequenced disc but also the bridge between songs like the lovely ""Mirrorball"" and the bluesy (in the get-the-Led-out sense) ""Grounds for Divorce"". There, the song's lyrical and musical reputation are in keeping with the band's exploration of the static as well as blues traditions. It's a tragic drinking song where the protagonist loses himself in ""a hole in my neighborhood down which of late I cannot help but fall."" Less fancy-pants lyricists would have just said ""bar,"" but Garvey knows the value of a poetic line or two. In typically ornate Garvey fashion, he's called ""An Audience with the Pope"" ""a Bond theme if Bond was from Bury and a recovering Catholic,"" but he could have just described it as Tom Waits doing 007. The song is a rare autopilot moment on a disc that otherwise makes so much effort to skirt cliché. Anyone expecting ""Some Riot"" to reflect it's title is headed for disappointment-- the song could easily explode, but follows a different, more moving path instead-- and ""Weather to Fly"" is almost mantra-like in its simplicity. Yet while ""The Loneliness of a Tower Crane Driver"" begins much the same, it gives way to some subtle twists, turns, and escalations that push the track into dramatically fresh territory. On ""The Fix"", the twist is that guest Richard Hawley's croon vies with Garvey's voice as guide through the jazzy song, vaguely film score in its menace but pretty cool despite its half-familiarity. The single ""One Day Like This"" sounds like just that-- a single-- with its faster gait and sunnier demeanor, buoyed by strings and massed vocals despite a deceptive but welcome surfeit of space in the mix, but per Elbow's own downbeat reputation, the album doesn't end there. That would be too easy. Instead, The Seldom Seen Kid ends with a bonus tribute to the title's inspiration, Manchester songwriter/troubadour/busker Bryan Glancy. Track down and browse the website dedicated to his memory and you'll likely wish you knew him. Listen to this absolutely beautiful tribute and you'll miss him like a best friend.","Elbow's fourth album doesn't rock the boat so much as steadily alter the waves, with surprisingly good results.

Red,Guillemots,by: Chris Dahlen,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b5b3c0084474cd0c247a/1:1/w_160/78e12273.jpg,2008-04-16 05:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11408-red/,Polydor,"Again and again on Red, Guillemots singer Fyfe Dangerfield complains that he can't get the words out. He chases the moon, tries another drink to loosen his tongue, and moans about how life would be easier ""if I was half-drunk and mad."" Words are failing him-- they've got a whole song about it-- and whatever he's feeling, he can't get it out. This from the singer of the effusive, vivacious, and Mercury Prize-nominated Through the Windowpane, where his falsetto wails and declarations of love could not have been less abashed. Dangerfield sang like he already was mad, as if he'd rather play the fool than miss a chance to give pleasure. How did this guy hit a wall? The simple answer is, Dangerfield has nailed romantic drama-- but this isn't a romantic album. The band has downplayed the sprawling orchestrations-- as well as Aristazabal Hawkes's sensuous upright bass-- to build a tighter, harder, more jarring sound. They're also sharing songwriting duties between all four members. The result is a stylistic trainwreck of psych- and Brit-pop, hectoring beats and shout-alongs, and by-the-book ballads. It's a classic sophomore slump-- and a total mess. It's not that the songs are stinkers; most are fine, and a couple are fab. But a couple of clunkers and dysfunctional sequencing brings the whole record down. ""Kriss Kross"" startles the listener to happy attention with slogans and thundering beats, tempered by a dazzling chorus; first single ""Get Over It"" takes the same strategy to even better effect, changing Dangerfield's barks from a command to an invitation. But the album goes south early with ""Big Dog,"" an R&B nod that trips over its own machismo. And the shrill ""Last Kiss"" is a total non-sequitor between ""Clarion"" and ""Cockateels"", two songs that swing all the way back to the fantastical end of their spectrum. ""Clarion"" is a genuine puzzler, with a drippy rainbow palette of synths and beats that pop like psychedelic gum until the only voice of reason comes from a pipa (a Chinese stringed instrument). A killer chorus props up a meandering structure that peters out into a false ending, making it ultimately unsuccessful but totally irresistible the whole way through. ""Cockateels"", meanwhile, has the dizzy disco effervescence of a ""We're Here""-- judging by the train reference, it may even be a leftover from Windowpane-- and the keening, wordless Middle Eastern chant is the album's best hook. (It also proves how deftly they can appropriate any influence except the modern top 40.) After that it's a slow slide downhill, as the album's wind-down crawls across four songs. To their credit, for all their leftfield ideas-- dig the sudden drum'n'bass break or the closing typewriter sample in ""Don't Look Down"" -- Guillemots never sound ""clever."" And instead of winking and laughing their way through 1970s and 80s pop and disco, Guillemots have thoroughly internalized their sources; they don't show a single ironic impulse between them. The problem isn't that the album's too strange or exotic; rather, it's too confining. Guillemots cram themselves into awkward fits, and Dangerfield has to squeeze the hardest-- whether he's tying himself to a straightforward ballad instead of clamoring for the rooftops, or standing up for a fight when he's so much more comfortable slipping into a dream. But kudos to the band for taking the half-baked idea over the easy kill every time; it's reason enough to stay tuned, even when they stumble.","Ambitious England-based band follows the effusive, vivacious, and Mercury Prize-nominated Through the Windowpane with a record that downplays sprawling orchestration for a tighter, harder, more jarring sound.

H.A.A.R.P.,Muse,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b5adb1335d7bf169a937/1:1/w_160/c5d79074.jpg,2008-04-16 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11403-haarp/,Warner Bros.,"I suppose the existence of H.A.A.R.P. is proof enough that Muse hardly needs validation from highfalutin' music critics, what with our five-dollar words and readers who're just hoping they get some good Radiohead or Queen cracks out of this review. Live albums are usually just victory laps, contract obligations, or cash grabs (sometimes all three), but this could still be your make-or-break Muse record: Even if the words ""Apocalypse Please"" or ""Map of the Problematique"" mean nothing to you, odds are you've been told Muse are ""pretty good live."" And they're a different kind of ""pretty good live"" than you usually hear us talk about here, because Muse make superhero music, and if you're going to offer declarations like ""Tonight we can truly say/ Together we're invincible,"" there are few settings more appropriately comic-book than the one for this CD/DVD set: a twice-over sold-out Wembley Stadium. Muse recall some of the more arena-ready rock of the 70s, but charmingly fall short of such hyphenates as ""cock-"" or ""prog-""; their body of work is completely bereft of even the faintest hint of lemon-squeezing, and while showy, their musicianship services their songs: solos are prominent but rarely indulgent, the sort of challenges that precocious teen guitarists want to emulate and probably can in their bedrooms (a big reason for Muse's success). That said, skeptics will still find the audio disc of H.A.A.R.P. to be tough sledding. If you never cared much for the ""change the world by taking it on"" attitude of songs like ""Time Is Running Out"" or ""Invincible"", piping in some crowd noise isn't going to change your mind. H.A.A.R.P. leans heavily on a certain type of Muse song, and it's hard not to notice more than a few compositional similarities: singer/guitarist/piano man Matthew Bellamy never met a ""Thunderstruck""-style pull-off riff that he couldn't use for an intro, the rhythm section's liveliest setting is a steady motorbike chug, and the melodies are often built atop vaguely Latin minor chord progressions that switch to a ripe major nearly the same way every time (a Muse hallmark since ""Muscle Museum"" and ""Uno"" from Showbiz). And though the Radiohead comparisons don't really hold water anymore, the Yorke ones do; Bellamy sounds impressive having his falsetto blast over grand canyons of stadium air, but he relies almost exclusively on those unmistakable melismatics-- ""Micro Cuts"" is one of those interminable howlers that makes you wish Jeff Buckley's Grace never existed. Even so, there's no denying that a format this huge and an undertaking this ambitious is what Muse has been building towards over a decade worth of releases; H.A.A.R.P. makes their two previous live releases sound like practice runs. As Pitchfork's Sam Ubl conceded in a review of Black Holes and Revelations, ""Take a Bow"" is the ""kind of song that could level an arena,"" and as the closer of H.A.A.R.P., this proves to be true. Moreso than most bands, Muse feel limited by the space of a studio or a compact disc. Freed from its original casting as BH&R's overwrought ender, ""Knights of Cydonia"" opens the disc after a recitation of Prokofiev's ""Dance of the Knights"" (yeah, I know), dropping the whinnying horse effects, toning down the brass, and instead devoting itself to a multi-part rumble that recalls ""Achilles' Last Stand"". The stairstep piano riff that spikes the gorgeous ""Starlight"" could pass for a ""Speed of Sound"" rip in your local trainer shop (and, come to think of it...), but when you can hear the space between Bellamy and 90,000+ singing along like it's the biggest Dashboard Confessional concert ever, it chariots across the sky. Of course, the visual elements of Muse's live show means the CD can't compete with the dazzling, colorfully shot DVD, which comes included with the physical package at no extra cost. Much of the concert experience is rendered flat on audio, particularly since the band's sound is far more imposing than its personality. Bellamy offers mostly polite and totally sincere stage banter in response to the constant ""I LOVE YOU!""'s, along the lines of ""you're beautiful!,"" ""are you having a good time,"" and if the band had a sense of humor, I'd imagine introducing ""Supermassive Black Hole"" with ""this next song is for anyone who likes a little r&b"" was a cheeky nod to Rattle & Hum. It might be hard for those of us in the States to understand how Muse became the first rock act to sell out the new Wembley-- when they toured in the U.S. last year, they were the opener for My Chemical Romance. I'm not sure whether that says more about Muse's popularity or MCR's, but those are the kind of groups Muse needs to be taken in the context of, and when compared the likes of Gerard Way's band, Fall Out Boy, the Killers, or Panic at the Disco, grandiosity seems like more of a natural fit for Muse than any of their American counterparts who often sound like they're using bombast as a way of numbing critics into submission or escaping emo into another dead-end of ego gratification. While many of the latter outfits try explicitly to create a concrete fourth-wall-busting narrative, Muse are more effective for implying the give and take-- they may just be following in the path of the Cure, the Doors, Rush, Pink Floyd, or even Led Zeppelin (I mean, you've seen The Song Remains the Same, right?), bands with similarly geeky and insular tendencies. In their case, Muse are the kind of act that rarely serves as an endpoint but more often makes teens fall in love with rock hard enough to explore it further. And that's fucking important. I mean, we can't all start with Radiohead.","With their heroic gestures and stadium bombast, Muse have quietly become one of the biggest bands in the world. Here they attempt to cram their reputation as a great live band onto a CD/DVD package.

Beartrap Island,Division Day,by: Stuart Berman,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b5ac13d197565213acce/1:1/w_160/46d69e62.jpg,2008-04-15 06:00:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11402-beartrap-island/,Eenie Meenie,"As the recent yacht-rock revival has illustrated, the west coast has traditionally been associated with a certain sunshined contentment and peaceful easy feeling. However, the most prominent indie rock artists to have sprung from the region in the past decade have been defined by a notable lack of fun, fun, fun, from the macro, modern-world meditations of Grandaddy to the fraught, tender intimacies of Death Cab for Cutie. Situated between these two totems-- both geographically and spiritually-- are L.A.'s Division Day, who are seemingly so in tune with west-coast despondency that they named themselves after an Elliott Smith song. But Division Day are rarely shy about their diffidence-- their debut full-length, Beartrap Island, communicates its overarching sense of melancholy with assertive, sometimes aggressive gestures. The album has been gestating since 2005, and though one can't assume the tracklist reflects the songwriting's chronology, Beartrap Island plays like a spirited juxtaposition of ideas before tempering itself into a more refined, if less captivating, presentation. In its opening stretch, the album touches on wondrous, synth-swathed psychedelic reveries (the 80-second title track), scrappy, staccato rock rave-ups (""Ricky"") and, in their most successful turn, a reconciliation of the two on ""Catch Your Death"", which locks into a swirling, stuttering drum beat (suggesting a nascent dub influence) before double-timing into an effectively urgent chorus. But with the onset of ""Hurricane"", Division Day's agenda comes into sharper focus: plaintive, pulse-regulating adult-contemporary indie rock that's often afflicted with a bout of mid-tempo-itis. Perhaps sensing that his bald sentiments (to wit: ""I want your blood inside my head"") could set off the emo alarm, singer Rohner Segnitz maintains a poised, breathy delivery that keeps the melodrama and histrionics to a minimum, but at the same time seems overly subservient to the songs' lazy haze; by the time we hit the second-act power ballad ""Reversible"", the portentous synth tones and Edge-y guitars render Division Day indistinguishable from any number of contemporary modern-rock bands striving for 1980s Big Music import. So it's no small consolation that Beartrap Island's most serious song topic is given an affectingly spare presentation that allows Segnitz's voice to stand on its own humble terms, without attempting to obscure or bolster it. The song is called ""Dayenu"", a reference to a Passover hymn commemorating the Exodus tale, wherein the title (which translates to ""it would suffice us"") is traditionally sung with joyous gusto. But in Division Day's case, the song's theme-- essentially, one of just being lucky to be alive-- is appropriated for a downcast rumination on surviving a near-fatal fever, illuminated by trolling organ accompaniment and sparks of feedback. Perhaps it's not the most appropriate selection for the Seder table this weekend, but in their own modest way, Division Day turn their own sorrow into something worth celebrating.","This quartet's debut-- which has been gestating since 2005, and was released late last year-- communicates its overarching sense of melancholy with assertive, sometimes aggressive gestures.

Everything's Perfect,Team Robespierre,by: Zach Baron,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b59e13d197565213acbb/1:1/w_160/e86b3a5b.jpg,2008-04-15 06:00:04,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11389-everythings-perfect/,Impose,"These days, Philadelphia's Atom and his Package is the science teacher he'd always threatened to become, presumably making it easier for all the misfits hiding out at the athletically inclined private school where he now teaches. Nerds already out of high school will have to settle for Atom's heirs, and somehow, there are many. Dan Deacon, Matt & Kim, and Team Robespierre have all made recent runs at the bleating sequencer, kiddie wail title-- which I guess people now actually want? Certainly it still has the same effect on grownups: Watch the way Studio B's bouncers pulverize the crowd every time Matt & Kim storm through. Come to think of it, the video for ""88th Precinct"" from Everything's Perfect, Team Robespierre's recent debut, begins inside the Nassau G Train stop, just a few blocks away from Studio B. Somebody in a lucha libre costume takes off down the platform, then snorts at the camera, and pretty soon all the kids are at a raging TR gig, and everybody knows all the lyrics. This, I guess, for all the people who didn't just listen to record and get the same idea-- practice at home, and then perform it live every night Team Robespierre happen to be in your town. It's probably my bad ears that can't quite tell the Men's Recovery Project synth on ""Gasoline"" from the Thrones synth on ""88th Precinct"" from the Matt & Kim synth on ""Ha Ha Ha"", but I get the concept. Like Atom, Team Robespierre are shooting for rite-of-passage status. The band lets kids excited about music be kids excited about music. As far as I can tell, the quartet has a bent for MRP-style surrealistic lyrics, although most of 'em seem to be not very political; the primary standard for what comes out of the dueling vocalists' mouths almost certainly comes down to what sounds best shouted out loud. Same thing with the wavy dueling synths, programmed to incite the crowd, down to the drum machine double bass. So although Everything's Perfect may not be much for listening to in the ol' bedroom, the songs are actually sorta great-- forgettable blasts of energy'n'enervation. Now that even the most modest of bands can reasonably expect an audience in the millions for even their most throwaway practice sessions, it's great to hear TR make something strictly for the 150 kids they see every Friday night.","Like Dan Deacon or Matt & Kim, Team Robespierre use a bleating sequencer and kiddie wails to create a sound that pushes listeners to thrill to the pure joy of music.

The Mande Variations,Toumani Diabaté,by: Joshua Klein,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b523ea9e61561daa6d6f/1:1/w_160/f2c58432.jpg,2008-04-15 06:00:03,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11281-the-mande-variations/,World Circuit,"In West Africa, the last name ""Diabaté"" is a bit like the surname ""Smith."" It's common, as it traditionally connotes an occupation, in this case a musical caste, with the holder part of a long line of singers and oral historians-- griots, or, among Mali's Manding people, Jali. Indeed, Toumani Diabaté comes from a long line of kora players. One cousin is the well-regarded Maya Sona Jobarteh. Another is Mamadou Diabaté. Diabaté's name and his skills allegedly span 70 generations. Yet the rising crossover popularity of Toumani Diabaté stems as much from the instrument he plays itself as it does from his mastery of it. The kora is a 21-string harp, of sorts, crafted out of a halved calabash gourd, cow skin and fishing line. Watching someone play it is not unlike watching someone weave, with the results as beautiful as an intricate tapestry. It's a wonder the delicate sounds of the kora and Toumani Diabaté's playing weren't lost in his last project, a recording with his long-simmering Symmetric Orchestra. An African big band featuring Diabaté and over 50 other musicians, the Symmetric Orchestra is an overt attempt on Diabaté's part to modernize the traditional role of the griot in Mali. The Mande Variations-- only Diabaté's second solo record, and his first since 1988-- couldn't be more different. Here it's just Diabaté and his unadorned kora, recorded with maximum clarity as he pays tribute to his roots and peers. Backing up a tad, it is truly remarkable that a musician as revered and respected as Diabaté has really only recorded a pair of solo records, with a 20-year gap in between. Obviously he's stayed busy, what with collaborations with everyone from Björk to his Malian peer Ali Farka Touré (honored on a new song named after him). It's a real testament to Diabaté's talent that an instrument as distinctive as the kora can be made to fit in such disparate surroundings, and indeed The Mande Variations works as a sort of crash course in the kora's versatility. Even sans overdubs, the 10-minute ""Si naani"" hints at everything from jazz to chamber classical as Diabaté's lush polyrhythms and melodies overlap. ""Elyne Road"" (named after a street in London, and reportedly inspired by hearing UB40 on his first visit to England) begins as a beautiful ballad before evolving into something wholly more complex. The elaborate, improvised trills of ""Ali Farka Touré"" pay tribute to the style of the late guitarist (with whom Diabaté worked on 2005's In the Heart of the Moon). ""Kaounding Cissoko"" could pass for the tricky ragas of John Fahey, with its drone undercurrent, while ""Djourou Kara Nany"" swings, however gently. Less successful is the explicit Ennio Morricone quote that starts ""Cantelowes""-- the familiar theme from The Good, the Bad and the Ugly, no less-- but that very, very brief digression is the nearest The Mande Variations ever comes to pushing the listener out of Diabaté's world. No, this disc is the real thing, casually captivating from start to finish, with Diabaté's modesty and restraint keeping his virtuosity and the rigor of his compositions from calling conspicuous attention to themselves. It's haunting stuff, no doubt, not in the ""ooh, scary"" sense, but in the awe inspired by hearing music this pure woven from the hands of a man.","Only the second solo album from kora master Toumani Diabate, The Mande Variations pays tribute to influences both centuries old and of a more recent vintage, with brilliant, beautiful results.

Remix Romance Vol. 1,Sally Shapiro,by: Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b5b4b1335d7bf169a943/1:1/w_160/9ded8e81.jpg,2008-04-15 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11409-remix-romance-vol-1/,Paper Bag,"When Sweden's Sally Shapiro introduced herself in 2006 with near-perfect single ""I'll Be By Your Side"", she had no other discography, posed for no photographs except those taken by people she already knew, and gave no interviews. We knew her only by her bashful vocals and producer Johan Agebjörn's vintage Italo-disco production. Listeners could fill in the gaps of persona for themselves, unmediated by stylists, publicists, or the crumbling corporate edifices that have only lately wised up enough to start buying out your blogosphere. Like most great pop music, the song was able to make huge numbers of people each feel like it was just for us. As great as Shapiro's full-length debut Disco Romance turned out to be, both in its original 2006 form and last year's souped-up U.S. release, I'll admit I was leery about the prospect of a remix album. Would Remix Romance Vol. 1, like so many remix compilations before it, be little more than an attempt to strike while the fire was hot? To cash in on Shapiro's recent internet renown without the hassle of bulking up her slim song catalog? I worried the idea would stretch way too thin the songs of an artist whose appeal lies at least partly in shy understatement. Sometimes I think too much about things. Remix Romance Vol. 1 is an accomplished, occasionally revelatory recasting of Disco Romance's synth-pop by some of contemporary electronic music's most capable hands. The fragile melodies and melancholic lyrics of the original songs mostly survive the remixing process, but here they're dressed up in shiny disco (Toronto duo the Cansecos' ""Hold Me So Tight"", with its funky Gloria Gaynor bass lines), pulsating techno (Hamburg producer Tensnake's grand, Booka Shade-esque ""I'll Be By Your Side""), or even quirky keytar-and-cowbell electro-pop (Toronto duo Woodhands' ""Anorak Christmas""). The famously reticent Shapiro has finally come into the open in recent months, conducting a few interviews and appearing in public for a string of recent DJ gigs; Remix Romance is the sound of her coming-out party. Even the most dramatically altered remixes here still keep enough of the source material's lonesome charm, just changing the scope from pop's concise three-minute single to dance music's vast 12""-ready sprawl. An 11-minute ""Time to Let Go"" by Norway's Lindstrøm holds up after hours of listening, transforming the title phrase to dancefloor mantra while fluid guitars, synths, and house beats percolate gradually into a cosmic disco epic; Shapiro could be reading the phone book as she whispers in French, but it still wouldn't diminish the hypnotic effect. DFA's the Juan MacLean gets a co-writing credit for his ""I Know You're My Love"", which combines shimmering, angelic choruses with the analogue synth arpeggios of the classic Italo that appeared on the influential Mixed Up in the Hague compilation. And the ever-dependable Canadians of Junior Boys transform U.S. Disco Romance bonus cut ""Jackie Jackie (Spend This Winter With Me)"" into pensive, shadowy ""Jackie Junior"", with squiggly horn and synth fragments playing out atop a rubbery sawtooth bass line. Remix Romance Vol. 1 isn't always as breathtaking as those three tracks, but it's constantly uncovering new sides to Shapiro's songs. I've criticized Toronto instrumental rockers Holy Fuck's remix of Radiohead's ""Nude"" for adding little but drums and smeary textures to the original, but they flesh out ""Find My Soul"" with some metallic squeals and R.E.M.-esque minor-key acoustic guitar jangle, and their live drumming brings Shapiro from some fantasy 1980s European disco to the present day's beer-smelling but very real rock clubs. Norway's Skatebård nearly beats Agebjörn at his own game with the vocoders, snow-frosted synths, and whimsical whistles of ""He Keeps Me Alive""; Sweden's Between Interval re-imagines rain-drenched ""Sleep in My Arms"" as a serene, ambient space walk. Sure, absence makes the heart grow fonder, but Remix Romance Vol. 1 reaffirms that Shapiro's music is the type you can live with day in and day out. You know, a lasting romance.","This collection-- the first of two Sally Shapiro remix sets this year-- is an accomplished, occasionally revelatory recasting of Disco Romance's synth-pop by some of contemporary electronic music's most capable hands, including Junior Boys, Lindstrøm, and the Juan MacLean.

Saturdays=Youth,M83,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b5b113d197565213acd8/1:1/w_160/a84088b5.jpg,2008-04-15 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11406-saturdaysyouth/,Mute,"Saturdays=Youth-- the new album from French musician M83 (aka Anthony Gonzalez)-- opens with a stately piano phrase. Synths gradually overtake the piano and Gonzalez sings concise lyrics in falsetto-- ""It's your face/ Where are we?/ Save me""-- amid billowing harmonies. It's the sort of big, beatless slow-burn he often uses to dramatize an impending pivot, a moment when the percussion gallops in and the song takes off for the stratosphere. But on this track, ""You, Appearing"", that pivot never arrives. Instead, the music tapers off into the booming overture of ""Kim & Jessie"". Saturdays=Youth is still huge music, with three players in addition to Gonzalez-- but it has a different kind of heft from previous M83 records. On Before the Dawn Heals Us, M83 was all about the vertical push-- layer after layer of synths and drums piled up in a vertiginous tower. But these new songs disperse in all directions: Producers Ewan Pearson and Ken Thomas spread the melodies and beats into a sound world of uncommon vibrancy and pristine clarity, mounted on a massive yet now more proportionate scale. Not only does the music move differently, it offers a different take on M83's favorite decade, the 1980s. Where previous albums saluted the doomed grandeur of the Cure and the retro-futurism of Blade Runner, Saturdays=Youth pays homage to Cocteau Twins (whom Thomas has also produced) and the teen dramas of filmmaker John Hughes. It's dense with new wave tropes: the chrome-plated guitars and aqueous keyboards on ""Kim & Jessie"", the decadent synthetic toms on the otherwise cloudy ""Skin of the Night"", the funk guitars and shivering cymbals of the masterful ""Couleurs"". Many modern bands have appropriated these iconic touchstones with a wink, a revision, or both. M83's reverent take is less common, bringing to mind Lansing-Dreiden's underappreciated 80s throwback The Dividing Island. The album has the same nostalgic sparkle as Hughes' films, a soft-focused mythology of eternal summers and young love. In the liner notes, Gonzalez dedicates it to ""all the friends, music, movies, joints, and crazy teachers that made my teenage years so great!"" At 26, Gonzalez is just the right age to look back on this era with rose-tinted glasses, forgetting the alienation and anxiety, remembering only the sweetness. Whenever the darker side of teenhood rears its head, it's heroically battled back: On the shoegaze-thick ""Dark Moves of Love"", ""everything is wrecked and grey,"" but the song ends on a poignant note: ""I will fight the time and bring you back!"" On the album's cover, heartbreakingly radiant youths (one of them a dead ringer for Molly Ringwald) strike poses in a gold and russet pasture-- the same kind of beautiful misfits that Hughes arranged in after-school detention. In lyrics filled with lusty eruptions (""They are Gods! They are lightning!""), archetypal teens invent themselves with innocent fervor: A love-struck young couple in ""Kim & Jessie""; a goth with a crown of black roses and a heart of bubblegum in ""Graveyard Girl"". In the context of teen drama, how perfect is it that Gonzalez met Morgan Kibby, whose dovelike vocals enrich ""Skin of the Night"" and ""Up!"", on MySpace? In the context of a band whose music is both literally and metaphorically cinematic, how perfect is it that Kibby has done voiceover work on the trailers for Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire and M. Night Shyamalan's Lady in the Water? These symmetries make Saturdays=Youth feel like an unaccountably alive, complete album. While some fans might be disappointed by the lack of a ""Don't Save Us From the Flames""-style anthem, the change in M83's sound arrives just as Gonzalez has pushed the maximal thing to its limits and risks diminishing returns. On its first two studio albums, M83 did one thing very, very well: create compact doses of tension and adrenaline. Saturdays=Youth meaningfully diversifies M83's catalog while retaining Gonzalez's indelible fingerprint. Like his recent ambient foray, Digital Shades Vol. 1, it finds a guy who's known for painting gigantic horizons figuring out how to broaden them even more.","After a pair of impossibly huge, overpowering records, M83's Anthony Gonzalez changes up his sound, ditching maximalism for beauty and drama. His new album is dense with 1980s new wave tropes and teenage memories, reflecting the soft-focused mythology of eternal summers and young love.

Soundboy Rock,Groove Armada,by: Tom Ewing,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b53aea9e61561daa6d99/1:1/w_160/609d8852.jpg,2008-04-14 06:00:05,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11300-soundboy-rock/,SonyStrictly Rhythm,"Eclecticism is a perennial problem in dance music, indeed one coded into the notion of ""dance music"" itself. Would that be a genre in its own right, or a coalition of separate styles which mix at artists' own risk? The practical grapplers with this issue have tended to be DJs, but in Britain especially there's a tradition of prominent acts who've opted for a ""big-tent"" approach to music-making, cleaving to no particular subgenre and crafting albums which roam freely through clubland and beyond in search of anything that might catch a few ears. 808 State used to do it well, Leftfield proved there was a big market for it, and Basement Jaxx pushed it to a delirious artistic peak. And Groove Armada? They prove the perils of the big-tent approach. Soundboy Rock is the fifth eclectic album in the duo's eclectic ten-year career, during which they've sold plenty of (highly eclectic) records and the sum total of their pop culture impact has been a car advert about waggling bottoms. And most of the people who rightly hate ""I See You Baby (Shakin That Ass)"" wouldn't even know it was by them. Thankfully, Soundboy Rock offers two mighty shots at redemption. Messy first single ""Get Down"" is carried by the bubble-and-squeak energy of long-lost grime MC Lady Stush: it's so good to hear her squeal and cackle again that you don't really worry where the hook is. Besides, the glorious follow-up, ""Song 4 Mutya (Out Of Control)"", has all the hook you'll need-- an eighties pop fantasia where New Order collaborate with Prince to soundtrack Mutya Buena's ex-directed anger. ""Song 4 Mutya"" is inspired, but the rest of Soundboy Rock gives a truer picture of Groove Armada's talents and limitations. Nothing here irritates or even displeases, but almost every track is a stylistic workout missing the killer idea that would make it vital. Candi Staton turns up for a Chicago house tribute, ""Love Sweet Sound"", which gets the style's spacey noises right but not its sensual or spiritual desperation. On the other hand, The Rakes' Alan Donohue MCing about polar bears dying on the indie-dub ""See What You Get"" is a lot less awful than that summary suggests: almost everything on this album tends gently towards the middle. The group seem happiest here when they're pastiching their own former triumphs. ""From the Rooftops"" and ""Paris"" revisit the group's chill-out roots (and the roots of Chill Out-- both tracks borrow samples from the KLF's seminal album), swaddling pretty melodies in echo to create a genuinely comfortable comfort zone. ""Lightsonic"" is a cousin of former hit ""Superstylin'"", and the combination of balearic keyboards, big beat and cornball toasting is as stupidly uplifting this time as last. Groove Armada have touted Soundboy Rock as their best album, and they're probably right, because they've excised the smarmy or irritating elements of their earlier work. The record was inspired by the atmosphere of Lovebox, the London festival they curate and DJ at, and it certainly proves that they know what great dance music sounds like: it also suggests they lack the spark to consistently make it themselves.","Nineties big-tent dance music holdovers wisely enlist Lady Stush and ex-Sugababe Mutya Buena to help pepper their latest album with charm and sass.

The Air Salesmen,The Selmanaires,by: Adam Moerder,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b52d9d034d5c69bf4fa1/1:1/w_160/18643b4a.jpg,2008-04-14 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11290-the-air-salesmen/,International Hits,"When you're essentially partners in crime with a band of bad boys like the Black Lips, it takes extra effort not to appear tame by comparison. The Selmanaires have grown up in the burgeoning Atlanta indie scene nearly step-for-step with the Lips, but while both bands brandish a renegade, devil-may-care ethos, they each come at it from very different angles. Playing the ego to the Lips' id, the Selmanaires show off a (slightly) more civilized musicianship, exploring several decades worth of genres versus hedonistically ripping through three-minute Stones and Motown throwbacks. That's not to say The Air Salesmen doesn't also go down well with a lukewarm can of Milwaukee's Best. On this sophomore effort, the band offers plenty of opportunities for debauchery, though they're cribbed in a more nuanced tone. On one hand, you have a heedless lothario anthem like ""Just to Get Yr Love"", its skyscraping guitar wails and cocksure come-ons a friendly parody of chic retro bands like Wolfmother or the Darkness. That frat-friendly attitude gets turned on its head, however, by the sultry yet cautionary ""Nite Beat"", a dance-rock song steeped in Franz Ferdinand-style soap opera sex and violence: ""Get on the floor/ There's no time to implore.../ We lay down our instincts."" The middle third of Salesmen stands as the album's most brow-raising section. Here the band flexes some unexpected intellectual muscle to tackle bookish post-punk in the tradition of Talking Heads, Gang of Four, and Throbbing Gristle. It's a Rubik's Cube the band doesn't quite crack, but there's still plenty of existential charm in the Go4 offshoot ""Reason and Chance"", whether in its pleasureless metallic drone or observations on human rationality and determinism. It's no secret ""A Small Room"" and ""GMAFB"" (short for ""Give me a fucking break"") strive to emulate David Byrne's televangelist bark and his band's intricate rhythms, even if the crass demeanor and ham-handed songwriting more closely resemble late-1980s Red Hot Chili Peppers. While this jerky genre-hopping helps to hold the listener's attention, some dabbling passes by too quickly. The catchy ""Verdigris Intrigue"", for example, is a lone psychedelic daydream amongst rawkers and post-punk reincarnations, a sad fact considering it's the strongest four and a half minutes here. Still, Salesman makes a stronger case for these guys as serious musicians than their clumsier debut, and their enthusiasm, for whichever genre they're copping, remains irrefutable. Even when borrowing from a library of ideas, though, exceptional bands find a way to make it all sound exclusively their own, and that skill remains the Selmanaires's biggest hurdle to date.","The Selmanaires have grown up in the burgeoning Atlanta indie scene nearly step-for-step with the Black Lips; playing the ego to the latter's id, the Selmanaires show off a (slightly) more civilized musicianship as they explore several decades' worth of genres here on their second album.

Midnight Organ Fight,Frightened Rabbit,by: Rebecca Raber,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b576c0084474cd0c2418/1:1/w_160/37a33dc2.jpg,2008-04-14 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11351-midnight-organ-fight/,Fat Cat,"On the surface, Scottish trio Frightened Rabbit are like a lot of other bands. You could file them away with other musicians from their Glasgow scene, or other bassist-free groups, or other bands of literal brothers (frontman Scott and drummer Grant Hutchison are siblings). But somehow, despite the fact that their methods are well-worn, their product is one-of-a-kind, as their consistently great second album (in under a year, no less!) attests. The key here is Scott's urgent-yet-emotive songwriting. Midnight Organ Flight is full of rousing barnburners that flicker with soul, ballads that ache with masculine vulnerability, and Frightened Rabbit's best song yet, opener ""The Modern Leper"". Built on insistently downstroked guitars and drums that build from a gallop to a thundering crash, this Pixies-go-acoustic track swells with self-loathing. ""Is that you in front of me/ Coming back for even more of exactly the same?/ You must be a masochist/ To love a modern leper on his last leg,"" sings Scott, and rarely has a song with such anthemic, air-drum-worthy fills been shot through with so much personal revulsion. Grant's muscular drumming is a highlight throughout the record-- and on stage. At a recent New York show, the band hadn't yet made it through two songs before he'd splintered three drumsticks with his powerful pounding. With the absence of another instrument to hold down the rhythm section (guitarist Billy Kennedy does occasionally fill out the low end with keyboard), he uses his percussion-- the satisfying hiss of his cymbals, the breathless insistence of his thudding kick drum, the delicious sizzle of his marching-band snare-- to saturate the empty space in the compositions. Flailing about at his kit, he keeps time wildly yet melodically, controlled amidst the chaos. Despite the trio's static (and relatively spare) set-up, Scott's songs imbue the band with an elastic identity. Scuzzed up tracks like ""Fast Blood"" and almost-bluegrass weepers like ""Good Arms Vs. Bad Arms"" prove that Frightened Rabbit have stretched beyond the melancholic folk-pop of Sing the Greys. But elsewhere-- most notably ""My Backwards Walk"" and ""Old Old Fashioned""-- they re-confirm their dedication to the sound they perfected on their debut, playing electronic and acoustic guitars against each other for stomping mid-tempo gems that pulse with nervous energy and heart-on-sleeve lyrics. Though nothing else on the album hits the pop high of its opener-- ""Leper"" is a tough act to follow-- its I'm-not-worthy sentiments are prevalent on all the album's best tracks. On ""The Twist"", a desperate yet tender ballad built on a similar freight-train piano line as LCD Soundsystem's ""All My Friends"", the protagonist practically begs for sex-- ""I can be who you like,"" he pleads-- while sadly allowing himself to be used. ""Whisper the wrong name,"" sings Scott in his accented bagpipe drone of a voice, ""I don't care and nor do my ears."" In track after track, Scott expresses that need for the warmth of another, however unworthy he may feel of it. Those sentiments are also echoed in ""Keep Yourself Warm"": ""You won't find love in a hole/ It takes more than fucking someone to keep yourself warm."" He's wallowing, but Scott's cracked voice sells every word, and his band's rousing rhythms and rough-hewn guitar interplay keep the mood from ever getting lugubrious or maudlin. Sure, Frightened Rabbit aren't the first band to explore loneliness, horniness, or emptiness in song, just like they aren't the first set of siblings to decide to jam together, but their jangly melodies claw their way inside your brain just the same, making them latest in a long line of Glasgow bands to effortlessly combine celebratory sonics and miserablist lyrics into something singular.","Glasgow indie pop band (is there any other kind of Glasgow band?) follows its slept-on and charming debut Sing the Greys with another assured set of soulful barnburners and aching ballads.

In Ghost Colours,Cut Copy,by: Mark Pytlik,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b5b25e6ef959693227f7/1:1/w_160/8b3c5533.jpg,2008-04-14 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11407-in-ghost-colours/,InterscopeModular,"For better or worse, Cut Copy swim in the same pool as those electro, French touch, and new wave revivalists for whom fashion, irony, and self-consciousness represent swords to live and die by. In a scene as self-reflexive as this, backlashes are the order of the day, but even still, there are signs-- such as the increasing use of ""blog house"" as an eye-rolling pejorative, recent records by Calvin Harris, Does It Offend You Yeah?, and Ghostland Observatory, and the parallel rise of Balearic-feeling dance as a worthy substitute-- that this world might be slipping under the weight of its own ubiquity. Based on their patchy and rainbow-chasing 2004 debut, Bright Like Neon Love there was every reason to believe that a new Cut Copy record this late in the cycle would only accelerate the meltdown; after all, there are only so many ways to arrange and re-arrange vibrant art direction, moneyed aloofness, and the right kinds of sounds before the party heads to a new venue altogether. As it turns out, we needn't have been so cynical-- not when Cut Copy aren't. If the pastichey Bright Like Neon Love felt more like an opportunistic patchwork quilt of other people's sounds and ideas, the hugely enjoyable In Ghost Colours feels light, confident, and unencumbered by the dictates of fashion. More than anything, though, it's a gloriously positive record, one whose cheerily strummed acoustic guitars, shimmering synths, sweeping choruses, and playful sonics maintain a delicate balance; where a lot of summer pop records like this often scream fun to the point of being oppressive (or at least annoyingly instructive), there's nothing remotely show-offy about In Ghost Colours. In fact, it's closer in spirit to the Avalanches' Since I Left You than it is to anything from the past few years. It's a hard record not to love. In Ghost Colours was co-produced by DFA's Tim Goldsworthy, who deserves credit for simultaneously opening up the band's palette while relaxing their delivery. Sure, as you might expect, there are still blushes of French house and electro scattered liberally all over the show, but they're always deployed in ways that serve-- rather than overshadow-- the song. And while Cut Copy's principle and founding member Dan Whitford may come from a DJ background, the band-led songs come across every bit as muscular and as noteworthy as the dancefloor crossovers. To that end, this is one of the best bridges between electro and rock in a long time; the joins are so seamless that you don't even think of the songs on those terms. From the first swirling synths and gleaming melodies of curtain raiser ""Feel the Love"", In Ghost Colours asserts itself as a hugely magnanimous record. Everything here sounds stadium-sized, loved-up, and breezily inclusive. There's the lead single ""Lights & Music"", an arena rock slow burner with a disco chorus; or the superb, helicoptering house of 2007 single ""Hearts on Fire"", which gets a welcome reprise; or the sunburst rock of ""Unforgettable Season"", which recalls Broken Social Scene in its ability to sound in full swoon from chord one; or the carefree ""Strangers in the Wind"", whose lazy verse and torpid guitar peels owe a little bit to Fleetwood Mac. Elsewhere, ""So Haunted"" and ""Far Away"" compete for standout track status, the former sandwiching verses of fuzzy guitar squall around one of the most gorgeous-sounding choruses of the year, the latter an effervescent bit of 80s synth fluff that holds up against the best of Human League and Erasure. So yeah, you get the point: Pop lovers will find lots to love here, and if there's any justice, this record will keep them swooning through the summer. Regardless of what kind of audience it ultimately finds, though, In Ghost Colours earns its smiles with a combination of ingenuity and easiness that you don't often come by, and for that, even in April, it already feels like a triumph.","Blog house may be increasingly used as an eye-rolling pejorative, but don't punish Cut Copy's hugely enjoyable In Ghost Colours, a fantastic summer pop record that feels light, confident, and unencumbered by the dictates of fashion.

Wrenches: My Heart / Double Abacus,Microkingdom's Pro Hour,by: Grayson Currin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b568ea9e61561daa6de5/1:1/w_160/33eaa708.jpg,2008-04-14 06:00:00,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11664-wrenches-my-heartdouble-abacus/,self-released,"Microkingdom is the Baltimore-based jazz-spazz duo of Oxes guitarist Marc Miller and percussionist and Doctor of Composition Will Redman. With the help of like-minded Baltimore tinkerers, the duo frequently expands into Microkingdom's Pro Hour, improvising over Redman's pattern-shifting pieces. Pro Hour's debut, Wrenches: My Heart/Double Abacus, employees Baltimore improvisational mainstay John Dierker on saxophone and clarinet. In 20 swift minutes (unfortunately available only through a self-release of 300 aquamarine LPs), the trio capitalizes on Redman's tense writing and drumming, Miller's caustic guitar proclivities, and Dierker's improvisational fire. Wrenches: My Heart/Double Abacus is dynamic, challenging, confident, and preternaturally developed for such a humble beginning, the work of musicians questioning each other's habits so as to bend good ideas into great sounds. Count it: It's hard to imagine having more fun with some drums, a guitar, and some reeds. The compositional smarts are immediately apparent but just as quickly dismissed: All three musicians leap headlong into ""Double Abacus"", attacking a groove and mutating it. Redman, Dierker, and Miller shift a relatively simple time signature as though they're mapping Tony Williams' drumkit--which warped rhythms as a force of habit-- to an instrumental trio. The saxophone leans forward, the guitar pulls backward, and the drums kick in the middle, looking for stability until it's apparent there will be none. Things appear to fall apart, all three instruments squiggling in celebration of liberation. But the rhythm presides even as everyone darts around it. As each musician moves back toward the middle, the piece collapses into silence. The saxophone again blasts its staccato theme, but the guitar and drums plow forward now, sideswiping order with chaos. The horn reciprocates, slinking with flagrant squawks and piercing sharp notes. The remaining five minutes are a set of duo and trio battles. You'll need to pick a team. Similarly, ""Wrenches: My Heart"" makes the expected feel unexpected by working through two distinct parts. Each half shocks itself and its listener with sudden jolts of tightly wound motion. You see them coming from a minute or so out, developing into perfectly sculpted tension. Nevertheless, when they happen, they're still exhilarating, railroading the given shape with outsider confidence: An electronic hum opens, an invitation to something eerie. Flints of guitar noise, circular sighs of a saxophone, and percussive layers teetering above silence accept. When they flash out, you'll jump: Drums, sax and guitar jerk into tight time and steadily peel from the center in wild Z-shapes. The sax heaves ahead, but the drums jack behind in a loosely syncopated groove. The guitar skips between both paths, sliding into the beat before slashing right past it. Again, there's silence. The hum cedes to another flash-shorter this time, with less rhythmic lockstep. The pieces peel apart. Dierker's saxophone deals in long, slow sighs countered by quick flirtations with melody. Miller's guitar bypasses notes for textures. Schizophrenia defines both the unit and the individual. Even Redman can't stand himself. He's heavy and lumbering with the kick drum but light, teasing, almost playful with the cymbal and snare. Everything drifts outward until Redman pulls back toward the middle, offering a rhythm with rests big enough for the guitar and the saxophone. But Miller and Dierker just circle the gaps, cutting between and around them as the rests get smaller and tighter. Tension builds. Another flash? Nope. Silence. Then, a voice: ""It fucking wrenches my heart, man."" A fitting motto for such a breathless debut.","Baltimore-based jazz-spazz project's debut is dynamic, challenging, confident, and preternaturally developed for such a humble beginning.

Feel Good Ghosts (Tea-Partying Through Tornadoes),Cloud Cult,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b52a13d197565213ac04/1:1/w_160/d6c4b132.jpg,2008-04-11 06:00:05,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11287-feel-good-ghosts-tea-partying-through-tornadoes/,Earthology,"""It was so f'in precious."" So went a lyric from Cloud Cult's last studio LP, 2007's The Meaning Of 8, and it could've been the understatement of the year. Nearly everything about the group is so admirable (their studio runs on geothermal power) or adorable (live painter onstage?!?!), that you could feel comfortable nominating them for public office or writing about them only in LOLCAT speak. But while 8 wasn't exactly an epic fail, it was curiously underwhelming; pre-leak hype suggested that it would push these industrious Minnesotans to the upper echelon of blog hosannas and year-end top tens that they seemed perfectly constructed for, but it just sort of deflated upon touchdown. But Cloud Cult have developed a self-sufficiency that allows them to exist almost totally outside indie's name-making machinery; simply put, they don't need the help, seeing as how whatever happens, they'll just keep doing what they do, free of the temptation to compromise their lofty ambitions. So, as expected, Cloud Cult keep it moving with their eighth album in as many years, but Feel Good Ghosts (Tea-Partying Through Tornadoes) is a pretty marked departure from their previous records. Considering that they've got their aesthetic down pat (a sort of post-Beck kitchen sink alt-rock matched with the 21st-century quasi-religious collectives), it's got nothing to do with sonics, however. Their last two LP's combined to clock in at more than 120 minutes over the span of 44 tracks, but this time, they've damn near put out an EP-- 39 over 13. This would initially seem like a smart move, but sprawl is every bit as essential to what they do as capo Craig Minowa's warble; paddling through all the extraneous dross was part (or most) of the fun. Unfortunately, their batting average is far lower here, magnifying all the nagging problems they've compiled to date. The title rings true, as the contents of Feel Good Ghosts are effusive, but invertebrate. Essentially, this is where the insularity finally catches up. At the very least, ""No One Said it Would Be Easy"" begins Feel Good Ghosts with beautifully panned piano, expressing the type of sentiments that are uncut Cloud Cult at their most empathetic-- ""You're a pretty human being...living, it ain't easy""-- but overzealous studio treatment has Minowa sounding like Jeremy Enigk drowning in a jar of Smuckers. And then there's ""Love You All"", which ends Feel Good Ghosts with the scent of an acid-washed power ballad, expressing the type of sentiments that are uncut Cloud Cult at their most cloying. Minowa offers ""I love you""'s to his mother and father but does so through a fucking talkbox, which either undermines the emotion or completely cancels it out. In between, Feel Good Ghosts too often comes off like hamburger phone transmissions from the Juno-verse, force-feeding knotty or naughty feelings through a filter of whimsy. ""Story of the Grandson of Jesus"", in addition to mining the same territory as 8's ""Alien Christ"", relates the story of a false prophet with a ""penchant for the pinchies,"" offering ""cola and Twinkies."" Meanwhile, ""Journey of the Featherless"" gives you an idea of what an unplugged Her Space Holiday might sound like, impotently namechecking cellphones and eBay as if they're pillars of modern evil after Minowa dispenses a K.I.T. senior yearbook koan-- ""It's worth dreaming just for the dream of it."" The group's always had a predilection for the boomin' system in their drum machines, but ""The Tornado Lessons"" is finally where Minowa tries his hand at the rap game. I'll let you guess how that turns out. I really wanted to see ""May Your Hearts Stay Strong"" succeed more than it does, as it features one of Feel Good Ghost's most arresting arrangements of machinery clanks and dramatic keyboards, and suggests that Cloud Cult might be willing to strip away their shiny happy defense mechanisms. But nothing about the shadowy love affair described therein feels real-- a nightclub owner who ""got his first stitches when he bit an ice cream bowl"" falls for a girl who ""wore her grandma's prom dress and slippers on her feet."" Instead of letting the characters just be, they have to be characters instead, and lyrically, Minowa just sounds out of his element, similar to when he laments ""all the poop that brings me down"" over the oontz-oontzing fake disco of ""Hurricane And Fire Survival Guide"". I'll admit, it's hard not to root for these guys, considering that they mean so well. Minowa will likely always have Cloud Cult as a means to therapeutically address the death of his infant son, and then there's this from the band's website: ""We also plant ten trees for every 1,000 albums sold just to be sure any other pollutants are absorbed. We have turned away major record label interests so we can be sure we can maintain control of providing Cloud Cult music in the most environmentally friendly manner possible."" How can I tell you not to spend the ten bucks? But you don't need a Mclusky primer to tell you that good intentions can only go so far and Feel Good Ghosts repeatedly fails to meet the listener halfway; Minowa hasn't run out of things to say, but he's having trouble coming up with new ways to say them, and Feel Good Ghosts unfortunately feels like another byproduct of Cloud Cult's recycling process.","The environmentally conscious collective's eighth album in eight years is a marked departure from previous records.

Pershing,Someone Still Loves You Boris Yeltsin,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b5a4c0084474cd0c245d/1:1/w_160/15dd823e.jpg,2008-04-11 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11393-pershing/,Polyvinyl,"Clap Your Hands Say Yeah were supposed to totally change the game for up-and-coming bands looking to avoid being extra deck chairs on the majors' sinking ships, but after Some Loud Thunder met its inevitable and somewhat warranted backlash, it just became that much harder to invest in a group like Someone Still Loves You Boris Yeltsin (and Walk It Off ain't helpin' either). Yeltsin's story is familiar-- armed with a memorably silly name and all the right blogger friends, the Springfield, Mo., foursome stepped up to Polyvinyl in 2006, and their sources are so collegiate you can practically hear an awkward DJ announcing the title between pockets of dead air after every song. But is that enough to cut it when you're trying desperately to come around on that Fuck Buttons album? Pershing, their second full-length, maroons SSLYBY on a middle ground that's eroding as listeners try to have it both ways, indulging in more outré subgenres and getting their pop fix from more ""direct"" sources, as if hooks from Rihanna are intrinsically more valuable than those of, say, the Shins.Which is to say that indie elitism never dies, it just mutates, and an album like Pershing is more likely to slip through the cracks due to its general sense of inoffensiveness. Thing is, it finds SSLYBY a far more accomplished and confident band, something to be expected from two years of having to prove themselves outside of their homebase. If the hooks of ""Glue Girls"" were spread over the course of Pershing, we'd be talking about a pretty solid record, but as the opener, it sets off a chain reaction of indie pop that's clean-cut without being fussy, instantly accessible without being too lightweight. At times, SSLYBY trip up when they get a little too clever for their own good. The overly affected eccentricities of ""Oceanographer"" tests the limits of how many words should be consecutively rhymed with the title (the answer: one, tops) before wandering off to a non-jam jam session of gormless riffing. Meanwhile, the Archies-like fluff of ""Dead Right"" is too content in getting on some Cam'ron shit and flipping the title over and over again until it's nearly meaningless. Truth is, the band's in a bit of a Catch-22-- Pershing is so easy-going it tends to forget trying to be memorable. In fact, in the time it takes to listen to its first song, you could've checked out Boris Yeltsin's Wiki page instead (did you know his approval rating was rumored to be 2% at his resignation?!?) and been as entertained. ""Boring Fountain"" and ""Modern Mystery"" pleasurably go in through one ear and out the other with polite harmonies, spiffy guitar sheen, and the occasional horn. And that's the problem: Rarely does anything stick other than a spare melodic line. The fact that they're able to cobble a few together over the span of three minutes gives off a complexity that feels more illusory than anything.","Armed with a memorably silly name and all the right blogger friends, this Polyvinyl band made waves in 2005 with a sound so collegiate you can practically hear an awkward DJ announcing the title between pockets of dead air after every song.

That the Helio Sequence-- to date, a good-not-great duo on Sub Pop and Cavity Search-- buck this trend stands as one of the pleasant surprises of the still-young year. Brandon Summers is a compelling, economical, and technically sound vocalist and his strides as a frontman carry the band's fourth album, Keep Your Eyes Ahead, an uneven but varied affair that suggests a long and fulfilling trajectory for the Helio Sequence. Summers' development comes with a tidy backstory: Amidst touring for 2004 Sub Pop debut Love and Distance, Summers lost his voice, read Dylan's Chronicles, and saw a doctor who instructed him not to sing for almost two months. The resultant scare led Summers to a feast of indie rock anomalies: healthy living via exercise and a regular practice/recording schedule and technical improvement via singing exercises. The results lie in ascendant vocals that replace awkward growls and breathy whispers with precise notes and even phrasing. Summers and keyboardist/drummer Benjamin Weikel thankfully did not let this increased attention to detail and professionalism derail their ember-glow indie pop. Keep Your Eyes Ahead is an ambitiously large album, gassing Summer's voice with reverb and bottle-rocketing all sorts of synths and effected guitars into lilting rock songs performed with the measure and craft of Northwest scene veterans. The push-push verses of ""Can't Say No"" and the tremble-y guitars of ""Lately"" encompass the flat skies and multitudinous bridges of hometown Portland; ""The Captive Mind"" eagerly recalls Modest Mouse's ""Gravity Rides Everything"". The pulsing sequencer of ""Hallelujah"", the album's longest and most strident anthem, plays counterpoint to Summer's long, loose solos. The muscular title track wrestles lustily with the Stone Roses: ""You came on like you knew you would/ Wearing high-top shoes walking home from school/ And I just 'bout fell right off the balcony."" The unfortunate side effect of Summer's newfound expertise is that, well, he's apt to use it. Singers like ""carrying"" songs, and Keep Your Eyes Ahead falters when Summers and Weikel set aside their wiring and aim for folk sounds subtly aided by ambient backgrounds, a swell idea if your slow tracks don't sound like the ballads from Dylan's Down in the Groove. Lines like ""Drank the dark wine of the New York night/ With shattered mind across the borderline"" do not help. On Keep Your Eyes Ahead's final track, the harmonica-led ""No Regrets"", the two get it right: clacking percussion behind a drunken sing-a-long that suggests that, yeah, the Helio Sequence might one day pull off this Americana tip, too. Even when it fails, Keep Your Eyes Ahead has a refreshing maturity and presence, old enough to admit that folk jamboree and synth-rock can coexist, hopeful enough to think Joshua Tree, or at least Ocean Rain, was a really good idea. Summers got religion right during ""Hallelujah""-- ""We don't want answers, anyway""-- but the wisdom is equally appropriate for his and Weikel's newfound skills. Keep Your Eyes Ahead is content to see where merely questioning gets you.","One of the year's pleasant surprises and biggest sleepers, the latest from this Sub Pop group is full of lilting rock songs performed with the measure and craft of Northwest scene veterans.

"""Couples""",The Long Blondes,by: Ryan Dombal,Features Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b59dc0084474cd0c2454/1:1/w_160/d4a9804c.jpg,2008-04-11 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11387-couples/,Rough Trade,"When lead Long Blonde Kate Jackson sang ""I'd rather just stay indoors"" on her group's full-blooded debut LP, Someone to Drive You Home, the shrugging sentiment was buoyed by dollops of surging guitar pop. And while the album flirted with its fair share of romantic misery, the accompanying music offered a smorgasbord of high-end giddiness. Obsessed with the swooning glamor of old Hollywood, Jackson played her lovelorn roles with plucky aplomb on Home-- from valiant big sister to bitter ex-lover to cutthroat femme fatale-- never languishing in one persona for too long. The singer might resign herself to nights filled with nothing but gin and Ava Gardner on Thursday, only to be seen flipping huge eyelashes toward a best friend's beau at the local watering hole on Friday. The combination of her sensual blare, guitarist-lyricist Dorian Cox's Pulp-y kitchen sink stories, and the group's hi-hat'n'hooks attack proved a welcome twist on the tiresome post-punk trend; when most bands looked to Factory staples to inform their danceable rock styles, this Sheffield clan came off like sly Postcard descendants with a flair for vintage shawls and berets. The one-time Best Unsigned Band in Britain offered sexy, theatrical escapism for the thrift store set, who joyfully returned the favor with knowing nods and the odd herky-jerky twist moves. Their sophomore effort won't get the cool kids as loose, which is ironic since it's designed for the dance floor. ""Couples"" is a darker affair, with much of the band's jittering upstrokes dismissed in favor of synth squelches and airless grooves. And this time, when Jackson threatens to spend weeks on the couch, it doesn't sound like a mere flight of youthful fancy. ""I used to come here to have a good time but I can feel like this at home,"" she laments on the title track, alone and despondent in the corner of the bar. In contrast to Home, which often found the singer looking at relationships from the outside with wide-eyed yearning, ""Couples"" deals more with the complications that arise from within troubled pairs. The change in perception is likely a byproduct of age -- and the fact that two inter-band couples broke up since Home's release probably played a part as well. So while the songwriting is less lively, it still remains relatively sharp as chief lyricist Cox delves into the uglier depths of relationship drama. ""Guilt"" has Jackson trying to drop a persistent suitor while sticking with her boyfriend-- ""guilt has nothing to do with it,"" she tells her lover, though the plain existence of the song would suggest otherwise. ""Here Comes the Serious Bit"" and ""Erin O'Connor"" take on the topic of sex with bleary, bloodshot eyes; the former's ""serious bit"" refers to the tenuous line between friends and more-than-friends, and the latter's titular British model stands in as a mask for a woman trying to gloss over her infidelities. For a band so adept at bringing the frivolities of infatuation to a boil, doomed affairs like the one told in ""I Liked the Boys"" (about a bored housewife who dreams about the one that got away) don't take advantage of their most potent powers. Along with the dour new outlook, producer Erol Alkan also acts as a stymieing force as he quantizes ""Couples"" into beat-based boxes that suck away at the Long Blondes' jumpy spontaneity. Known for remixing Justice and Hot Chip among others, Alkan's style is similar to that of neo-post-punk godhead Paul ""Phones"" Epworth, i.e., turn it up, keep it steady, and chip away at any and all traces of humanness. When he's not botching the typical Long Blondes sound with distractingly piece-meal mixes and overly mechanical loops on tracks like ""The Couples"" and ""Serious Bit"", he leads the group into some intriguing-yet-unfulfilling experiments. As the ""Heroes""-esuqe quotes in the album's title suggest, the Long Blondes aspire to be legit art-rockers and, as is the mandate for such bands, they must challenge expectations. Mission accomplished on first single ""Century"", which not only introduces a spare disco pulse (that thinks it's about five times funkier than it actually is) but also changes things up lyrically, with Jackson penning a scattered and abstract ode to a hundred years gone by. It's all very ""Rapture"" minus the requisite strut. Odder still is the woozy wipe-out track ""Round the Hairpin"", a respectable attempt at Can-style kraut that suffers from an indulgent running time and lack of suitable context-- it's as if they Googled ""experimental genre"" and ran with the results for six long minutes. Of the self-consciously out-there tracks, the minimal ""Too Clever By Half"" is the clear keeper; on it, Jackson employs a sinister falsetto as she unravels a cunning quadruple-cross tale over skeletal disco. The song revives the winking Long Blondes of old while still progressing their sound instead of blindly tossing everything aside in search of something (anything) new. On the album's closer, a two-timing Jackson tries to cap the muddy trauma of the rest of ""Couples"" by embracing her sinful side: ""I'm going to hell so I may as well make it worth my while,"" she belts. It's a refreshing moment of defiance from an album that often seems awkwardly stuck-- between beats and guitars, complacency and loneliness, guilt and redemption. Well-studied pupils of the indie game, it's as if the Long Blondes willed themselves into a classically underwhelming, transitional second LP. (Talking about the record's penchant for left-turns, Cox recently said, ""It's a way of setting our stall out. This album's job is to point towards the third album."") They're blessed with a genuine pop star in Jackson, and Cox can still turn pedestrian travails into rousing anthems á la Jarvis Cocker, but neither talent is on full display here. In an attempt to be taken seriously, they've sacrificed too much of their effervescent appeal-- after all, enthusiasm and artfulness need not be mutually exclusive.","On its full-blooded debut LP, Someone to Drive You Home, the British band offered sexy, theatrical escapism for the thrift store set; follow-up ""Couples"" is a darker affair, with much of the group's jittering upstrokes dismissed in favor of synth squelches and grooves.

April / Nights,Sun Kil MoonMark Kozelek,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b5a7c0084474cd0c2464/1:1/w_160/7242f9fc.jpg,2008-04-11 06:00:00,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11672-aprilnights/,Caldo Verde,"Few songwriters could bear the scrutiny of a book of lyrics, although far too many invite it. Writing good songs is only half the challenge; the other is to set words compellingly to paper, without the securities of voice, chords, and melody to reinforce their internal rhythms and recast their meanings. In 2002, Mark Kozelek, formerly of Red House Painters and currently alternating between a solo project and the loosely defined Sun Kil Moon (which is pretty much a solo project), released a book of lyrics called Nights of Passed Over in Europe, where his cult is even more intensely rabid than his American audience. Culling primarily from his work with Red House Painters, the book argued persuasively for Kozelek as a gifted, intuitive, and insightful songwriter, with an aversion to sentimentality and a way of combining words that is evocative without being showy or clever. His lyrics can stand on their own, even without his low, rich, sad voice and shimmering, patient guitar. Six years later, Kozelek has reissued Nights of Passed Over in America. A lot has happened during that interim: He has released three albums as Sun Kil Moon and has already reissued one of them, has put out a live album under his own name, and has formed his own record label, Caldo Verde. The label is also publishing this new version of Nights of Passed Over, which is accompanied by Nights, a full disc of alternate takes, rarities, and live tracks. It might seem like an act of supreme hubris if it weren't for the fact the Kozelek often eludes musical associations in favor of literary ones. Despite the persistent comparisons to Neil Young and Crazy Horse at their most compact, his literary influences seem much more useful: Kozelek draws from Raymond Carver when he's in storyteller mode, at other times from Robert Lowell or Norman Dubie or James Kavanaugh. That's a big statement for any musician, especially one who tends to write about his cats. Nights begins with a live version of ""Michigan"", from the Painters' 2001 swan song Old Ramon. The song thrums with a palpable sense of desire and a quickly diminishing sense of restraint: ""I see through your thin cotton dress/ I don't know if we'll get to rest/ So pull by that store parking lot/ You know I've missed you lots/ Warn me of the cans and nots."" Recorded at Union Chapel in London, this version of ""Michigan"" features only Kozelek's vocals, which are subtle as an internal monologue, accompanied by his acoustic guitar and a rapt audience. That's really all it needs. In a sly stroke of sequencing, he moves directly into ""Drop"", from the same venue, with its devastating admission delivered in long lines that seem to break the meter: ""All the love in an instant makes my life stop/ But then my hate for you makes my feelings altogether drop."" Of course, Kozelek isn't a literary figure, but a musical one, so the CD lives and dies by the sounds that accompany his words. And these are, by Kozelek's own admission, the lesser takes, so occasionally Nights does little more than remind you to pull out your old copy of Ocean Beach. The guitars on this ""Jam version"" of ""Carry Me Ohio"" ground out the melody like a cigarette into asphalt, but the nice, twisty solo somewhat redeems this take. Originally released on Cameron Crowe's Vinyl Films label, this acoustic version of ""Duk Koo Kim"", from Sun Kil Moon's Ghosts of Great Highway, sounds hypnotic as the guitars pick out a steady theme that changes notes even as they repeat the same rhythm. For all its ups and downs, Nights never feels like a vault-emptying exercise. It's more a compendium of Kozelek's marginalia. Kozelek has updated Nights of Passed Over up through April, his long-awaited Sun Kil Moon follow-up to Ghosts of Great Highway (not counting the Modest Mouse covers album Tiny Cities). The simultaneous release of both works makes Nights of Passed Over seem like one of the most elaborate lyrics sheet ever. These new songs continue his emphasis on steadily paced compositions about lost loves, distant friends, deep regrets, and nebulous sadness, but shifts the setting from the open road to closed-in rooms at the end of long drives. Not as immediately accessible as Ghosts, April starts with ""Lost Verses"" and ""The Light"", two long, slow songs that are together nearly twenty minutes long. This is Kozelek time, and it takes a moment to adjust. But once you do, the nuances of the songs' melodies and arrangements gradually announce themselves, like lengthy jam tacked onto ""Lost Verses"" and the grinding electric strums that fill the spaces between the vocals on ""The Light"". Lyrically more than musically, ""Lost Verses"" makes for an effective opener, as Kozelek seems to consider all the things that he has neglected to write down: ""Lost verses well up my eyes and ears,"" he sings plaintively, fearing that he'll become a lost verse to the people he loves. That sense of faltering memory colors April in shades of rainy grays and deep blues. It's a spring album that still pines for previous seasons. By the time the moody, acoustic ""Lucky Man"" comes around, the album has set its stride and maintains it through eight more songs. Bonnie Prince Billy lends backing vocals on the country-tinged ""Like the River and ""Unlit Hallway"", which breaks for a spiky banjo solo. These are the most dramatic departures on April, which expands only minimally on the solemn Americana of Kozelek's previous works. He hits many familiar notes, yet manages to make it all sound new and even adventurous instead of conservative or quaint. He reaches into his fragile upper register on ""Harper Road"", and maps out a travelogue on ""Moorestown"" that feels nearly threadbare with remembering. ""Tonight the Sky"" draws out its meanings with churning guitars, pausing for a lengthy solo that threatens to fall apart with every note. The album draws its power not simply from the quality of Kozelek's songwriting, but from the close intertwining of words and music, which makes his albums much more essential than any book he could ever publish.","Much-loved cult singer and songwriter Mark Kozelek releases both the new Sun Kil Moon record and, under his own name, a disc of alternate takes, rarities, and live tracks to accompany the American release of his book of lyrics, Nights of Passed Over, which is culled primarily from his work with Red House Painters.

Neptune,The Duke Spirit,by: Adam Moerder,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b4acb1335d7bf169a7a5/1:1/w_160/9e44352c.jpg,2008-04-10 06:00:05,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11177-neptune/,You Are Here,"The Duke Spirit's bare-boned debut, 2005's Cuts Across the Land, flourished on the charming improbability of its artistic success. Surrounded by little hype, the British quintet cooked up ornery blues-rock that should've been rendered superfluous by similarly bluesy marquee acts like the Kills and White Stripes. Yet Cuts' murky sonics and dark lyrics mystified a genre that's become almost painfully familiar to listeners this decade. Neptune, on the other hand, practically screams that the band's ready for their close-up, and the band buckles under the pressure of an album where artistic (and possibly financial) success is expected. With Queens of the Stone Age producer and Masters of Reality founder Chris Goss behind the boards, the band took the next logical step and transplanted to Southern California to record Neptune. Don't confuse the album for a Desert Session, though. For one, there's a pretty overt nautical theme running these thirteen tracks, but even more surprisingly, the band's no-frills sound shows shrugs off the peyote-driven haze inherent in nearly everything Goss touches. Instead, Goss airbrushes the cold droning guitars a tad and fills the unintentional canyons of reverb with something more professional, but otherwise it's the same old Duke Spirit. Single ""The Step and the Walk"" sports some time-tested blues heartbreak as frontwoman Liela Moss opines over a straightforward riff. Although her signature husky alto remains intact, the heightened recording clarity draws increased attention to stock lines like ""I'm moving to the end of your loving."" This becomes problematic when the band attempts a power ballad like ""Wooden Heart"", leaving a wistful Saddle Creek sentiment (""I would understand your heart/ If I could feel it"") out to dry amidst instrumentation that's nurtured to the point of boredom. That's not to say Goss' skills add nothing to the Spirit's swagger. The tumbling slide guitar on ""This Ship Was Built to Last"" exorcises many of PJ Harvey's Desert Session highlights, and the flurry of droning piano keys on ""Send a Little Love Token"" adds a nuanced texture to the band's raw sound. For songwriters so ambivalent about their tuneful side, the Spirit take their biggest steps forward here on slower, weirder folk numbers. ""Dog Roses"" sounds like a haunting sea chantey, benefiting especially from Moss' erratic melody and a dissonant yet hummable chorus of ""oooh's""-- a welcome departure from Neptune's glut of forced rock choruses. Closer ""Sovereign"" does its best to defrost the album's emotionally detached chill, though it's up against several tracks worth of numb rawk, and that's the double-edged sword on Neptune. The Spirit still play hard-to-get, which helps to avoid any ridiculous moments on this polished sophomore effort, but they're often too stand-offish to even challenge the listener, let alone push the envelope that their influences have so neatly prepared for them. Somehow they emerge from the desert with less of an aura of mystery than they entered with, granting us only the occasional mirage.","After the charming improbability of their 2005 debut, the Duke Spirit's Neptune aims to prove the group is ready for its close-up.

Music for Lamping,Strategy,by: Mike Orme,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b56fea9e61561daa6def/1:1/w_160/6ffd11f1.jpg,2008-04-10 06:00:04,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11345-music-for-lamping/,Audio Dregs,"Paul Dickow ascribes to a sort of morality of the non-committal. He keeps busy with a number of bands and collaborations within the Portland music scene, whether it's drumming for punk band Emergency, working with improvisational trio Nudge, or recording under his solo electronic music guise, Strategy. Even within his solo work, Dickow avoids all the usual signifiers that might align him with a signature sound. Listen to Strategy's 2007 record Future Rock on an especially balmy night and you'd swear it was rooted in grimy 1970s funk. On a rainy day, its fluid repetition seems more at home in the auspices of the early Krautrockers. Still further insight gained by introspection in the dead of winter might place Dickow's solo project in the icy depths inhabited by Boards of Canada. The fact is that Strategy inhabits all these places at once. He's never afraid to try something new, is rather unconcerned with musical continuity, and is often proud to lack allegiance to an established musical identity. Even the name ""Strategy"" seems to be chosen to reflect a plan, not a person. In a pinch, Future Rock's closest reference is perhaps Byrne & Eno's My Life in the Bush of Ghosts, and it is a rough one at that. Now, in a complete non-shocker, Strategy's new Music for Lamping fully commits to Future Rock's sense of ambiance at the expense of its rock signifiers. Stylistically, Music for Lamping plays more formally, and that makes it oddly more challenging. On the surface, the record is pretty simple: repeated progressions and loops for anywhere from five to 15 minutes at a time, with the odd bit of color and fuzz passing in and out of the mix. It would be tempting to reduce the record to the vagaries of ambient or drone, but the glistening oscillations of songs like opener ""I Can't Stand The Rain"" seem a lot more selfish (and listenable) than you'd expect from music using those labels. Dickow is captivated by the ability to distill the enchanted spark powering Future Rock into pulsating, organic works, and he does that by removing percussion and almost all senses of progression. These compositions have stewed over for a long time (some of which came from a canceled 2002 ambient record for Tigerbeat6) but, even with six years of dust, sound like they could have been recorded yesterday. They also sound like they could have been recorded thirty years ago, as is the case with ""Lower Macleay"", which can trace direct lineage back to Klaus Schulze's Moondawn, and ""Cathedral Spark"" and ""All Day..."" which sound like lost Cluster & Eno pieces. It doesn't always work: ""Bike Click"", one of the more chaotic compositions, makes aggressive overtures at the outset, but never builds into the dramatic, threatening climax it seems to hint it could become. By the same token, listeners expecting the same soulful electronic music as Strategy's early work are in for a surprise from a forceful but taciturn group of works full of personality but too somber for someone without a stomach for ambient music. Still, Music For Lamping is a nice indicator that Dickow is willing to explore in-depth one of the many styles from which he borrows, and to attempt to run it through an aesthetic filter that is true to both him and the style. It complements his beat-oriented, melodic work by providing some insight into the stylistic backbone of those efforts. In another non-shocker, Dickow seems most committed to a rule that is key to making music: there are no rules.","Paul Dickow returns with another album from his diverse and rewarding Strategy project, but this time he fully commits to a sense of ambiance at the expense of its rock signifiers.

Antidotes,Foals,by: Tom Ewing,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b58e9d034d5c69bf5050/1:1/w_160/6c2735be.jpg,2008-04-10 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11372-antidotes/,Sub PopTransgressive,"Foals' debut, like many British records, trails clouds of homeland hyperbole, but it's harder than usual to cut through and get a fix on what exactly they do. Reviews have offered afropop, math rock, and techno as reference; the band members themselves cite Gwen Stefani and Steve Reich. Antidotes suggests these are mostly red herrings. Foals are squarely in a more recent and less exotic tradition-- the hi-gloss end of the post-punk revival: Think a more playful Bloc Party, a more measured Futureheads, a less heartfelt Maxïmo Park. That's not to say they lack their own sound. If some of the UK press have seized on ""math rock"" as a way to describe the largely 4/4 Foals it's less because they fit the genre and more that their best tracks sound like they were plotted on grid paper: oblique instrumental vectors crossing, rotating and transforming. In concert videos the guitarists face each other, instruments high and tight against their chests, reflecting one another on an invisible y-axis, shutting the audience out. The stances fit the songwriting: Foals are a band who offer their listeners little in the way of graspable emotion or explanation, but sometimes make up for that with momentum and intrigue. Take ""Cassius"", for instance: Breathless, contorted ska-pop, built around high, nervy guitar lines and stuttering brass, with Yannis Philippakis' plummy yelping prominent in the mix. Repeat listens make sense of the sound, reveal the excitement in the muddle-- but the content? It might be about Muhammad Ali. It might be about the Roman Senate. You may as well flip a coin, since it doesn't remotely matter which-- you can thrill to ""Cassius"", you can dance to it, you can admire its construction, but there's something chilly about its aggressive abstraction. So what? Aren't thrills and admiration enough? On tracks as propulsive as ""Cassius"" and its fellow single ""Balloons"" the answer's yes. ""Balloons"" actually has one of the album's stickier lines-- ""We fly balloons on this fuel called love""-- but is still driven by how its syllables dance and swing, not how they connect. Both singles also use the Antibalas horns-- intermittent guests throughout the album-- to excellent effect, enlivening and widening a slightly arid sound. The brass takes Foals into the tense, mournful spaces the English Beat once explored, and they feel at home there. When the tempo drops, the problems begin. As tracks like ""Red Socks Pugie"" and ""Heavy Water"" slow down, the band loses its crispness and instead of weaving around one another the instruments tread on each others toes, with good hooks lost in a murky coagulate. Worse, Philippakis' voice feels more exposed. It's a blunt tool at best, a kind of blank bark: each word given the same pained heft. On the album's longest track, ""Big Big Love (Fig. 2)"", he's repeats the dramatic line ""Oh! Electric shocks! No!"" again and again as the band wind down. He's demanding our attention but, without any discernible emotional context, doing nothing to earn it. The effect is excruciating. These moments of misplaced weight make Antidotes hard to recommend, but there are good ideas and moments all over the record. The delicate ""Olympic Airways"" makes a wistful virtue of the drones and echoes that bog the band down elsewhere, and even finds a prettier register to Philippakis' vocals. ""Two Steps, Twice"" and ""Tron"" aren't as memorable as the singles but share their appealing intensity. And it's likely Foals know their strengths and potential. They ditched Dave Sitek's original mix of Antidotes for an overuse of reverb, and they left their first buzz-building singles off the record, preferring to look forward. They've also taken pains in interviews to disassociate themselves from the moribund main current of British indie. That's a wise and admirable stance, but it's not showing up in their music quite yet.","Foals' debut, like many British records, trails clouds of homeland hyperbole.

Walk It Off,Tapes 'n Tapes,by: Adam Moerder,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b5989d034d5c69bf5062/1:1/w_160/24642df7.jpg,2008-04-10 06:00:01,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11381-walk-it-off/,XL,"There's probably a fascinating scholarly paper, or at least a feel-good Oprah episode, to be mined about the four smart, quirky Minnesota boys in Tapes 'n Tapes and their internet-fueled success. After hearing Walk It Off, though, I don't care to pursue it. Like Clap Your Hands Say Yeah, a band whose career appears equally shackled to the blogosphere's mercurial whims, it's tempting to romanticize TnT's rags-to-riches story. Yet on their follow-up Some Loud Thunder, CYHSY didn't just bristle in the limelight, they actively thumbed their nose at it with risky stylistic forays and stubborn hooks. That ending doesn't fit TnT follow-up Walk It Off, a blissfully directionless album guilty not of audacity but utter innocuity. Not shying from the CYHSY parallel, the band hired Some Loud Thunder producer Dave Fridmann to breathe life into these song skeletons. Judging by The Loon's prankish ambiguity and touches of psych escapism, Fridmann's mystical touch initially seems like a perfect fit. Unfortunately, these talents don't quite behoove the creative direction TnT veers towards on Walk It Off. Despite Fridmann's track record (Mercury Rev, Flaming Lips, Mogwai, the Delgados), TnT shy away from exploring the canyon-sized depths of sound at their producer's fingertips, instead utilizing his skills for mere decoration-- to the point of nixing the eccentric Pavement-isms of their debut for even more streamlined indie rock. To say TnT doesn't stir up endorphins in the typical rockist-wired brain would be a lie, but their pleasure principle's less convincing on this textbook sophomore slump. The Loon was upfront about its lack of originality but made sure the listener could at least have fun connecting the dots, noting the Pixies riff here, the Built to Spill jam there. By comparison, *Walk It Off'*s nods to its influences are too broad and underdeveloped to pursue. Sure, you can hear indie signifiers like the ""Le Ruse""'s octave riff barrage or the deadpan Beatles-via-Britpop chord changes on ""Conquest"", but each individual song repeats these tropes too cautiously, worried an impromptu psych vamp or rawk-out outro would shatter its contents. Amid such simplistic arrangements, a large onus falls on frontman Josh Grier's vocals. An astute Stephen Malkmus scholar, Grier again proves capable of crafting lyrics that, while arcane and often mumbled, manage to evoke strong emotions in small, timely snippets. On ""Lines""' epic build, Grier's repeated yelps of ""Over line!"" work in tandem with an off-kilter lead guitar to construct one of the album's only successful attempts at big-stakes rock. On the Modest Mouse-y ballad ""Time of Songs"", Grier remains stubbornly unintelligible, though the discernible line ""I'll pull you from the bottom/ And I'll leave you on the floor"" contains enough emotional weight to make the track stick. Yet despite being the wordsmith behind lines like The Loon's catch phrase ""like Harvard Square holds all inane,"" Grier's not a Morrissey or Bob Dylan; his enigmatic charm doesn't justify the use of instrumentation as mere lyrical scaffolding. Limp tracks like ""Say Back Something"" or ""Anvil"" can't subsist on a delicately strummed chord alone, and if you're gonna name a song ""George Michael"", it's gotta have a better punchline than Vaudeville horns and a half-assed white noise guitar solo. By nearly all accounts, though, this album could be much worse. Many of the band's best features remain intact, especially their total lack of pretentiousness and austerity. You won't find any symphony-backed lumps of schmaltz or ill-advised stabs at dire social issues, and hey, they even named a very serviceable track here ""The Dirty Dirty"". However, Walk It Off attempts The Loon's indie patchwork using fewer and larger pieces, causing less-than-stellar ideas and riffs to suddenly become load-bearing pillars for painfully linear three-minute pop songs. As opposed to their ramshackle debut, TnT don't unknowingly stumble upon infectious choruses or head-turning transitions anymore, they contort flimsy songs to contain those elements.","Like Clap Your Hands Say Yeah before them, blogosphere darlings Tapes 'n Tapes have enlisted famed producer Dave Fridmann to helm their much-anticipated sophomore album.

The Sound of Philadelphia: Gamble & Huff's Greatest Hits / Conquer the World: The Lost Soul of Philadelphia International Records,Various Artists,by: Nate Patrin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b526b1335d7bf169a871/1:1/w_160/793f61e9.jpg,2008-04-10 06:00:00,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11660-the-sound-of-philadelphia-gamble-huffs-greatest-hitsconquer-the-world-the-lost-soul-of-philadelphia-international-records/,Philadelphia International,"Philadelphia International was a purpose-driven appellation for a record label, the source and the destination both outlined in the name itself. Much like Motown in the 1960s declaring itself ""The Sound of Young America"", Philadelphia International aimed to conquer the world with a specific, auteur-driven sound steeped in the roots of one major American metropolis-- and the auteurs in question were Kenneth Gamble and Leon Huff, who stood as the primary architects of the 1970s' upwardly-mobile orchestral version of soul. Their productions' opulence, smoothness, and chops-- abetted by MFSB, one of the great studio bands in music history-- paved the way for disco, sparked inspiration in Elton John and David Bowie, and acted as the soulful but crossover-friendly counterpart to the decade's wild-assed, post-Sly Stone funk much in the same way Berry Gordy's meticulous empire offset the grittiness of Stax and Atlantic. MFSB's ""T.S.O.P. (The Sound of Philadelphia)"" had only one line, ""people all over the world""-- an echo of the underlying sentiment from one of the label's big early smashes, the O'Jays' ""Love Train"", but also a clear statement of who, exactly, they were aiming their music towards. The Sound of Philadelphia: Gamble & Huff's Greatest Hits is a not entirely thorough yet almost unfailingly great cross-section of singles focusing largely on the label's peak years in the early-mid 70s. Just about everything you need to know about the Gamble and Huff approach is covered in the comp's first two songs, both from the O'Jays' 1972 breakthrough LP Back Stabbers-- the optimistic idyll of global-peace dance number ""Love Train"", and the more cynical (and pragmatic) duplicity warnings of ""Back Stabbers"". They both feature the songwriting and production team's greatest strengths-- a simple, economic usage of lyricism that worked in both a rhythmic and melodic sense (listen to the way the chorus to ""Back Stabbers"" unfurls from the slow, sinister glide of ""they smiiiiiile in your face"" to the rapidfire finger-jabs of ""all the time they wanna-take-your-place""), backed with a fine balance of punchy, out-front grooves and almost delicate orchestral ornamentation. All that, with the vocal interplay of lead singer Eddie Levert and backups Walter Williams and William Powell-- well, it's nothing short of world-beating. The rest of the compilation is filled with songs that hit the top five on both the r&b and pop charts-- Harold Melvin and the Blue Notes' elegiac, gorgeous ""If You Don't Know Me By Now"" (a career-making performance from the young singer Teddy Pendergrass); Billy Paul's sly yet guilt-wracked infidelity ballad ""Me and Mrs. Jones""; the Three Degrees' ""When Will I See You Again"", which made longing sound strangely peppy. It's telling that seven of the compilation's 14 tracks fall in a two-year span, and once it gets past 1972-1973 things get even more lush and orchestrated, until it flirts with adult contemporary sounds. But given the singers-- the velvety rumble of Lou Rawls in ""You'll Never Find Another Love Like Mine"", or the old-school street-corner doo-wop flourishes of the Intruders' ""I'll Always Love My Mama""-- there's a sense that this sound of middle-class luxury was hard-achieved from the ground floor up. Throw in a couple late-period ballads by Pendergrass (""Close the Door"") and Patti Labelle (""If Only You Knew"", the only post-70s track in the collection) and McFadden & Whitehead's ""Ain't No Stoppin' Us Now""-- disco's greatest moment of populist hubris-- and it's clear that Philadelphia International's peak didn't taper off much. Like many Greatest Hits albums, especially label-centered ones, The Sound of Philadelphia does have that ever-present Catch-22-- the only real weakness in the songs included here is an overwhelming (if comforting) familiarity, but it's also easy to wonder why some equally familiar songs were left out; there's plenty other places to hear the O'Jays' ""For the Love of Money"", but why not here, too? At least the gaps don't cut out too much context or history; it's a shame we don't get to hear Harold Melvin & the Blue Notes' rapturous lament ""Bad Luck"" or the euphoria of MFSB's disco blueprint ""Love Is the Message"" (dubbed by some discophiles and B-boys, in a bit of scene-traversing appropriation, as ""Brooklyn's National Anthem""), but their absence doesn't alter the collection's disposition much. There's one regrettably missing track that could've underlined one of Philadelphia International's strongest characteristics-- 1977's ""Let's Clean Up the Ghetto"", an all-star neighborhood-revival benefit record featuring Rawls, Pendergrass, Paul, the O'Jays, & Dee Dee Sharp, was one of the label's many endeavors set up to give back to their city-- but the rest of the label's unique character is intact. Or at least the unique character that the Top 40 listener knew. Conquer the World: The Lost Soul of Philadelphia International Records is a counterpart to Gamble & Huff's Greatest Hits-- Philadelphia without the international, a locally focused collection of bands and singers who could lay claim to contributing to the sound of Philadelphia while frequently sounding little like their chart-topping labelmates from the very same area code. Despite the presence of seven songs co-written by either Gamble or Huff (five involving both), their imprint isn't as obvious here, and some of the songs they did write aren't so easily identifiable as such. People's Choice-- also represented on The Sound of Philadelphia by the elastic disco-funk of ""Do It Any Way You Wanna""-- deliver some bluesy, full-throated Southern-style soul belting on the Huff-penned ""The Big Hurt"", Ruth McFadden's ""Ghetto Woman (Parts 1 & 2)"" features a brassy, fuzz-guitar-drenched arrangement that sounds calculated to one-up every ""Theme from Shaft""-geeked coattail rider on the r&b charts, and David ""Bunny"" Sigler & Dee Dee Sharp's ""Conquer the World Together"" is a great recapturing of the chemistry that Marvin Gaye and Tammi Terrell sparked in the studio together. In fact, it's Sigler who makes his presence known in Conquer the World's most memorable and eccentric moments. As one of Gamble and Huff's longest and closest collaborators, Sigler proved himself to be a versatile lyricist and arranger, not to mention a helluva performer. Aside from ""Conquer the World Together"", he also delivers on ""Everybody Needs Good Lovin' (Parts 1 & 2)"", a fiery 1971 single that almost comes across like an answer to Wilson Pickett's 1970 Philly-recorded, Gamble & Huff-penned hit ""Get Me Back on Time, Engine Number 9"". And Bunny winds up beating Carl Douglas and his trail of kung-fu-alikes to the one-inch punch by a good year or so with 1973's ""Theme for Five Fingers of Death"", an unofficial title song to the Shaw Brothers classic, punctuated by twangy guitar and percussive backhand slaps and a ton of martial arts pontificating (""I've given you my secret technique for the Iron Fist. Always use it in the cause of justice. Never use it for personal glory""). It's a far cry from getting on board the Love Train.","Philadelphia Internaional auteurs Kenneth Gamble and Leon Huff-- the primary architects of the 1970s' upwardly-mobile orchestral version of soul-- are celebrated on a pair of compilations.

In Light,Arp,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b57913d197565213ac89/1:1/w_160/d02e30a0.jpg,2008-04-09 05:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11353-in-light/,Smalltown Supersound,"Alexis Georgopoulos, the sole member of Arp, used to be in the instrumental funk outfit Tussle. His former band, who are still going strong, made their name channeling the lean, driving sound of early 1980s New York outfits like Liquid Liquid and ESG; Arp, though a very different animal, is just as heavily indebted to the music of a specific time and place. The most obvious inspiration for this project is West Germany in the first half of the 70s, when the artistically inclined kids born around the time of WWII began to hit their stride creatively. Think early Kraftwerk on Phillips, Cluster, Popol Vuh, Tangerine Dream; though each has a hugely varied body of work, all were electronic music pioneers with their eyes and ears trained on the future. To Georgopoulos' credit, In Light doesn't come across as a retro exercise so much as an attempt to capture a certain spirit. Titles allude to his forbearers (hard to see a track called ""St. Tropez"" without thinking of Pink Floyd's 1971 LP Meddle, ""Premonition of the Sculptor Steiner"" references a Werner Herzog film and, by extension, an accompanying Popol Vuh score) and vintage synths abound, but the overall mood doesn't feel overly tethered to the era. What Georgopoulos capturers most of the age is an approach to sound that made electronics seem warm, friendly, natural, perhaps inevitable, and above all optimistic. The post-moonshot days of the early 70s-- like the 50s and the 90s-- were a time when it seemed as though technology might save us yet. In Light reflects a grounded, idealistic mindset; the music is not especially psychedelic, and clarity is prized over drugginess. The percolating ""Potentialities"" is the spaciest track, its fat, sequenced bass made for either stargazing or a show at the planetarium, but it still has an innocent cast. Even further in this direction is the clean, bright pulse of ""St. Tropez"", which brings to mind Raymond Scott trying to engineer the ultimate aural environment in which to raise babies. Only the 15-minute drone piece ""Odyssey (For Bas Jan Ader)"", its midrange-heavy synths burred with distortion, flirts with an unsettling atmosphere, but even here it's more a sense of anticipation than dread. All tracks are simple, effective, and easy to grasp, letting a few elements and subtle changes do loads of work. Most subtle of all is ""The Rising Sun"", which is perhaps the best example of Georgopoulos hearing the music of the past in a fresh way. Sometimes overlooked in discussion of the kosmisch pioneers is that they unwittingly invented new age. These acts weren't above teasing out a pure mood piece, something placid and meditative that was unashamedly in tune with Aquarian-age spirituality. ""The Rising Sun"", built with resonant piano clusters that seem to tumble down waterfall-style and a soothing whistle-like tone that brings to mind Florian Schneider's flute, strikes me as sort of brave in its delicacy. It flirts with a sphere of music many consider verboten and then, eventually, Georgopoulos brings through a bassy drone to shake up the calm and give the track some bite. The track's free use of acoustic instruments and familiar textures shows a pragmatic side also in evidence back in the day. Georgopoulos has a very specific vibe in mind for Arp, and he uses whatever works; though a small, simple record on the one hand, In Light, on its own terms, is a big success.","Former Tussle member Alexis Georgopoulos reinvents himself as the architect of an early 1970s throwback to a time when electronics seemed warm, friendly, natural, perhaps inevitable, and above all optimistic.

Asking for Flowers,Kathleen Edwards,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b53eb1335d7bf169a894/1:1/w_160/95822b8e.jpg,2008-04-09 05:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11303-asking-for-flowers/,ZoeRounder,"Of all the female singer-songwriters who inhabit the borderland between actual country and general roots music, few have as much presence as Kathleen Edwards. The Canadian inhabits her gritty tunes with the kind of authority that should come from real experience. Hopefully, she hasn't lived through all of her songs, which document rankled love and hard times in grave detail. Over three albums in just five years, she's proven herself a more capably imaginative and intuitive songwriter than Tift Merritt, Allison Moorer, or even post-Car Wheels Lucinda Williams. Edwards may not have the commanding voice of Neko Case, but she usually has better words to sing. What immediately sets her third and best album, Asking for Flowers, apart from her two previous collections is the opener. Both her 2003 debut, Failer, and her 2005 follow-up, Back to Me, kicked off with their best tunes, two hard-hitting, uptempo numbers that told the story of a petty crook and his exasperated lover. Asking for Flowers starts with ""Buffalo"", a downtempo song that shows off Edwards' new piano chops (she taught herself to play for this album) and her distinctive voice on the swirling chorus. It also features what sounds like an autobiographical angle, which is rare for Edwards: She sings about crossing the border into America and wondering if Customs will allow her to return. ""Buffalo"" isn't just a slow opener, but it's about paperwork. If the song promises a more somber album than what came before, ""The Cheapest Key"" kicks those expectations in the teeth. Using an easy mnemonic that makes it sound like she wrote the song in ten minutes (""A is for all the times I bit my tongue / B is for bullshit and you fed me some""), Edwards takes a slash-and-burn approach, essentially going ballistic on whichever lout has dared to cross her. Her studio backing band, which includes members of the Heartbreakers (Tom Petty's, not Richard Hell's), have her back. Occasionally, they pad their part, as on the six-and-a-half-minute closer ""Goodnight, California"", but generally, they bolster her vocals without intruding on the spotlight. The best moment in ""The Cheapest Key"" is Edwards spitting the line, ""F is my favorite letter, as you know,"" which has both sexual and bird-flipping connotations. She peppers her songs with lines like that, not necessarily ambiguous but surprisingly frank, the kind that make you stop short. In the title track, about a beleaguered wife, it's the second half of the chorus: ""Don't tell me you're too tired/ 10 years I've been working nights."" In the wrenching ""Alicia Ross"", about a real-life case of a woman abducted and killed by her neighbor, it's the opening line: ""I am a girl with a forgettable face."" In ""Scared at Night"", it's pretty much every line. Delivering these lyrics, she sings herself nearly hoarse, as if mustering the conviction to convey these hardluck stories properly. There's a combativeness to Edwards' singing and songwriting, as if she knows she's working in a genre that favors tasteful decorum and too often churns out sonic wallpaper. On Asking for Flowers, she sounds better than her peers for being so much braver.","Of all the female singer-songwriters who inhabit the borderland between actual country and general roots music, few have as much presence as Canadian Kathleen Edwards.

Mountain Battles,The Breeders,by: Stuart Berman,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b589b1335d7bf169a8fe/1:1/w_160/1afe1aca.jpg,2008-04-09 05:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11367-mountain-battles/,4AD,"It's generally bad critical form to reference the record company-supplied bio in a review, but the one-pager accompanying the Breeders' Mountain Battles is worth mentioning: It's written by Josephine Wiggs, who played bass on the band's first two albums but left in the late 1990s while the Breeders withered in a seemingly interminable state of inertia. That Wiggs has resurfaced after a decade to play the role of Breeders cheerleader speaks volumes about the kind of faith and goodwill Kim and Kelley Deal have accrued over the years, despite a career that's nearly derailed on more than a few occasions due to the sisters' well-documented substance abuse and the group's peculiar recording habits and revolving-door rhythm sections. After hearing Mountain Battles, Wiggs admits her reaction was: ""Why aren't I playing on this album?"" Her excitement is genuine-- Mountain Battles is indeed the best Breeders album since 1993's Last Splash. Which, of course, isn't saying a helluva lot, given that the 15 years in between have produced but one official record: 2002's Title TK, whose nine-years-in-the-waiting build-up was far too great a weight for its brittle, often sluggish low-fi pop oddities to withstand. In lieu of a return-to-form, we simply had to be content with the fact that the Breeders had returned at all. However, in contrast to all the uncertainty that hung over the band pre-Title TK, the Breeders approached Mountain Battles from a position of relative stability, with bassist Mando Lopez, drummer Jose Medeles, and producer Steve Albini all returning for another go; the six-year gap between that album and Mountain Battles is easily accounted for by Kim's entry into rehab in 2002 and the subsequent Pixies reunion tours that kept her on the road for the better part of 2004-05. But true to the Breeders tradition of tellingly apropos album titles (the hermetically sealed claustrophobia of 1990's Pod, the breakthrough/burn-out of Last Splash, the work-in-progress feel of Title TK), Mountain Battles suggests that all those Pixies paychecks don't make the Breeders' business any easier. If Title TK was a tentative first step back into the public eye, Mountain Battles finds Kim and Kelley proudly venerating the Breeders' battle-scarred history and bull-headed perseverance. Like Last Splash's ""New Year"", Mountain Battles' ""Overglazed"" is more intro than proper opener: Over an ascendant surge of swirling backward-looped guitars and crashing drums, Kim repeats the song's lone lyric-- ""I can...I can feel it!""-- like someone who's just woken from a coma. Or, in her case, it's someone who's reconnected with a muse that only seems to appear every half-decade or so, which would explain her tendency to linger on a feeling: ""Night of Joy"" plays up the contrast between its sweet, girl-group melody and the song's hauntingly absent ambience (much like Kim's star cameo on Sonic Youth's 1995 creeper ""Little Trouble Girl""); the optimistic rebirth narrative of ""We're Going to Rise"" playfully jibes with the song's lethargic waltz rhythm, as if slowing down the action lets her better savor the moment of peace. With such deliberately spare presentation, Mountain Battles takes some time to warm up to (and new-wave toss-offs like ""Bang On"" still carry traces of Title TK's song-sketch incompletion), but then Kim and Kelley Deal's pretty sing-song harmonies and affable Ohio charm can distract us from how difficult the Breeders' music can be-- both for them as players and us as listeners. By this point, that very sense of struggle is intrinsic to the Breeders sound: It's pretty amazing that after all those years of line-up changes and aborted recording sessions, the Breeders pretty much sound exactly the same as they ever did, the quirks, hiccups, and sputters once attributed to a certain amateurish enthusiasm sounding ever more like purposeful components of their bubblegum bricolage. (See: the basement-Zeppelin chug of ""No Way"".) No, there isn't a ""Cannonball"" here, but the buoyant, bass-driven strutter ""Walk It Off"" makes for a dandy companion piece to Pod's ""Only in 3's""; Kelley's power-pop pick-me-up ""It's the Love"" gleams with a ""Divine Hammer"" shimmer; and the sisters' voices have never sounded finer than on the country-harmony duet ""Here No More"". But Mountain Battles' air of revitalization-- the thing that has Wiggs wishing she had her old job back-- is characterized not just by these straight pop shooters, but the apparent glee with which the Deals toss out the curveballs: the Teutonic-tongued oompa-loompa punk of ""German Studies"", the Spanish-sung slow dance ""Regalame Esta Noche"" and the bizarro rumble-in-the-jungle group chant of ""Istanbul"". Once upon a time, bands used to model their careers on copping the Breeders' moves (see: Salt, Veruca). Mountain Battles' greatest success is it makes that very idea seem once again like both an admirable ideal, and an unachievable one.","The follow-up to 2002's Title TK-- a tentative first step back into the public eye after nearly a decade of inactivity-- Mountain Battles finds Kim and Kelley Deal proudly flaunting their bull-headed perseverance and their familiar arsenal of quirks, hiccups, sputters, and enthusiasm.

Piasa...Devourer of Men / Juggernaut / Jack's Creek,Sun City Girls,by: Mike Powell,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b571ea9e61561daa6df2/1:1/w_160/3fa0d233.jpg,2008-04-09 05:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11666-piasadevourer-of-men-juggernaut-jacks-creek/,AbductionAbduction,"In February 2007, Charles Gocher, drummer for Sun City Girls, died of cancer. Alan and Richard Bishop, the trio's bassist and guitarist, respectively, retired the band's name after 25 years of recording. Gocher's death spawned at least one hard, unromantic fact: One of the hairiest discographies in indie music wouldn't get any bigger. Quality control not only wasn't the group's forte, it was posited as antithetical to their ethic, an affront to spontaneity. Editing responsibilities were, essentially, left to the listener. This is an admirable line to toe as an artist and an obnoxious one to force on a consumer. The band has about 20 albums to choose from if you're buying new; counting used bins, eBay, and purloined stuffing from clandestine sources, it's closer to 50. But part of their genius was their anti-commercial commercialism. They recorded compulsively and released a substantial portion of what they recorded. Sun City Girls promotional discs tend to come directly from Alan Bishop. They're a cottage industry: They'll never grow outside of the house, but they're not too bashful or precious to work their product like a mule. The other part of their genius was their style. Sun City Girls' music might be most succinctly described as pan-ethnic folk played as trebly, half-improvised punk rock. But even that's a detrimental redux. Better to say they auditioned just about every guitar-based sound you'd never hear on a ""pop"" record with agility, humor, and focus so intense it often slipped into sounding cross-eyed. The writer Byron Coley once said that without them, all underground music would sound like Merzbow. Blender noise. Not a pleasant thought. But Coley's comment was as much about attitude as sound. Sun City Girls' sense of showmanship was the snake-oil salesman's or a circus performer's more than the artist's. It was flashy and full of mysterious bullshit. It was based on mutual suspension of belief, on the idea that they were shamanic conduits bearing deep-ass mysteries in their rucksacks to produce to their audience like rare gems or exotic birds. Jack's Creek, Piasa...Devourer of Men, and Juggernaut were all out of print before this past fall. It's not like SCG to reissue, but now that Gocher's gone, it's not surprising that they're willing to till the catalog a little more before quieting down. Ostensibly, Jack's Creek is the band's Americana record. Given their treatments of non-Western music, the prospect is interesting. The results, though, are ironic. It's unlistenable. Bad. Why they'd re-release it over other out-of-print SCG albums is beyond me. Juggernaut and Piasa are both soundtracks, and in turn both explore the quieter, less intrusive sides of their music. Piasa fares better. SCG could never really assimilate to a background, though, and that's one of the nice things about listening to Piasa-- it's a mood record that errs on the side of getting your attention rather than making itself invisible. It's also an album where the band gave full reign to their timbral experimentation, incorporating Asian horns, metal percussion, hand drums, and acoustic guitars into a sound that usually prided itself on the economy of the rock trio. Tackling Sun City Girls in a review is essentially exhausting. Some releases are better than others. It's hard to imagine someone liking one album and finding nothing in the rest of their catalog to appreciate. I couldn't even say that these few reissues are particularly worth it, save Piasa. As callous as it might be to say, it's nice to be able to start thinking about SCG in retrospect--even on the weakest moments in these three records, evidence of their influence on modern underground music is apparent and, at times, even overwhelming. And while the Sun City Girls are a band more likely to get brainlessly name-checked than actually listened to, well, that's immaterial-- the curious vagaries of influence. I could certainly think of worse figureheads.",,7.0,
The Last Tycoon,Peter Morén,by: Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b5675e6ef95969322774/1:1/w_160/a1f604b3.jpg,2008-04-09 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11337-the-last-tycoon/,WichitaQuarterstick,"It took more than a year, but Peter Bjorn & John's ""Young Folks"" finally turned into the kind of honest-to-goodness worldwide sleeper hit the mainstream U.S. music business hardly knows what to do with anymore. Not only did the single from the Swedish indie-pop trio's 2006 album Writer's Block hit #13 in the UK and crack the Top 40 in Germany and the Netherlands. Not only was it sampled by Kanye West and covered by everyone from the Kooks, James Blunt, and Pete Yorn to ""99 Luftballons"" singer Nena and Japanese folk-popper Shugo Tokumaru. Not only has it appeared on TV shows like ""Grey's Anatomy"" and ""How I Met Your Mother"", in commercials for Budweiser and AT&T. Why, the catchy little thing even charted in the U.S.-- where Writer's Block has sold roughly 160,000 copies. None of which quite explains why the guy who sings male lead on ""Young Folks"", Peter Morén, has chosen to follow his group's breakthrough with, umm, a meandering folk-pop solo album loosely inspired by the sad tale of a studio-era Hollywood mogul whose passion for his work causes him to miss out on life. The Last Tycoon, now known as The Love of the Last Tycoon, was the final, unfinished novel by F. Scott Fitzgerald. The 1973 film adaptation, starring Robert De Niro and Jack Nicholson, was the final (finished) movie by On the Waterfront director Elia Kazan. And Morén? Presumably, he's just getting started. And it shows, in a set of slow, plaintive love songs that flash occasional glimmers of his band's charms, but too often fail to even stand out over their stripped-down arrangements. It's not Morén's indulging his self-professed ""Dylanhead"" status that hobbles The Last Tycoon. Folk-flecked acoustic guitar underpins some of the better songs here, stretching out beneath the caustic rasp of the handclap- and piano-splashed digital single ""Social Competence"" or dancing beneath harmonica on casual, intimate finale ""I Don't Gaze at the Sky for Long"", which alludes to filmmaker François Truffaut. ""Le Petit Coeur"", the track Morén tells Billboard gave him the idea for this project, adds strings and rumbling piano for an ominous, bilingual song about nighttime skulking, tribal conflict, and relationship brinksmanship: ""If you lock me out again, I may not come back to seek you,"" Morén sings. The album's vague concept can't be blamed for the disappointment, either. Sure, loping opener ""Reel Too Real""-- with its synths, tubular bells, and knee-slaps-- examines the difference between images and reality. And Bert Jansch-esque six-minute epic ""This Is What I Came For"" is a cinematic character portrait: ""You're the spoiled white kid with clenched white teeth."" But it'll take way better Fitzgerald scholars than me to find other potential connections. See, this points to the album's main problem: a failure to communicate. Fellow Swedish singer/songwriter José González keeps his lyrics elemental and his playing atmospheric, but neither Morén's voice nor the samey folkie backing here are strong enough to add interest to the clumsy rhymes and lackluster tunes of songs like ""Tell Me in Time"". Same goes for the sparsely orchestrated ""Missing Link"": ""I've found the missing link, the missing link/ No longer do I have to think, have to think."" Morén's words and melodies were as big a part of the appeal of his songs on Writer's Block as was Björn Yttling's reverby production, so again, it's not as if Morén hasn't done stuff like this well before. In fact, he even does it here. Only once, on the electric guitar-based ""My Match"". With a spaciousness that's the closest The Last Tycoon comes, sonically, to Writer's Block, Morén delivers the album's deftest hook-- ""I can't say that I plead guilty of theft/ But I agree I've done you wrong""-- and backs it up with a plea to ""trust me, I trust you"", mirrored by weeping lead guitar. On the Cat Stevens-like piano confessional ""Twisted"", spiced up by Spanish guitar and güiro, Morén sings, ""Don't overrate yourself/ It could have been someone else."" I wouldn't go that far. But The Last Tycoon shows that although Morén may not suffer from writer's block, he'd be smart to withhold some of his output. A lot like the rest of us.","One-third of Peter Bjorn and John follows his group's breakthrough with a folk-pop solo album loosely inspired by the final, unfinished novel by F.

The Felice Brothers,The Felice Brothers,by: Joshua Klein,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b52413d197565213abfb/1:1/w_160/32da00ce.jpg,2008-04-08 06:00:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11282-the-felice-brothers/,Team Love,"Apologies to Todd Haynes and I'm Not There, but Bob Dylan in the mid-1960s alone was like a Venn diagram showing several different versions of Dylan overlapping. There was Dylan in the studio, recording the game-changing trio of Bringing It All Back Home, Highway 61 Revisited, and Blonde on Blonde. There was Basement Tapes Dylan. There was Dylan and the Hawks, out on tour. There was Dylan at home in Woodstock, recovering from his motorcycle crash (maybe) while defending his young family from psycho fans prowling for The Truth (definitely). And then, shared by all sets, there was the Dylan enigmatic even to the singer himself. This is the Dylan that, on ""60 Minutes"", cited ""It's Alright, Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)"" and declared: ""Try to sit down and write something like that. There's a magic to that, and it's not a Siegfried and Roy kind of magic, you know? It's a different kind of a penetrating magic."" Tell it to those unfortunate souls that continually set out to channel Bob Dylan, inevitably capturing the sound but rarely the ""penetrating magic."" The same goes for acts out to mimic the Band, let alone Bob Dylan and the Band. But while even Bob Dylan may not know what makes Bob Dylan tick, one suspects fellow upstate New York enigmas (by design) the Felice Brothers have clearly taken copious notes. Who knows whether or not the Felice Brothers-- brothers Ian, Simone, and James, plus a friend called Christmas-- are actually, consciously trying to come as close as possible to replicating Dylan an/or the Band on their self-titled latest. Regardless, the point is, whether they intended to or not, they've come eerily, awkwardly, creepily close to capturing that familiar mix of mood, mystery, atmosphere, and aesthetic. It's an act of brazen affectation, to be sure, but you've got to half admire the band's balls. Besides, it's not as if Dylan and the sainted Band had clean hands themselves. A Jewish kid from Minnesota posing as a hobo folk poet anti-hero in New York, hooking up with a bunch of Canadians playing Southern sharecropper Civil War reenactors? Hats off all around, guys. Like the fragments and experiments cut by Dylan and the Band that comprise the famed Basement Tapes, many tracks on The Felice Brothers sound like they were written a few minutes before they were recorded, little sketches fleshed out just enough to form proper songs. The likes of ""Ruby Mae"", ""Helen Fry"", and ""Frankie's Gun!""-- like two other tracks on the disc, recycled from the Felice Brothers' earlier Adventures of the Felice Brothers Vol. 1-- are detail-rich and pleasingly loose songs, buoyed by rubbery bass, barrelhouse piano, organ, and nicely ramshackle guitars. If they're not first takes, they may as well be. But rootsy authenticity is one thing, and self-consciously retro rootsy authenticity is another. It takes a massive suspension of disbelief to buy into the sloppy sing-alongs of ""Love Me Tenderly"", ""Take This Bread"", and ""Greatest Show on Earth"" (on the latter two tracks, the Band influence grows almost obnoxious with the introduction of horns). The accordion and shuffling drums of ""Radio Song"" are genial enough, but the song doesn't really go anywhere. The boho busker Dylanisms of ""Tip Your Way"" are too annoying to be salt of the earth, while elsewhere anachronistic references (plus loaded lyrical references to ""pillbox hats"" and the like) border a tad on the smug side, tipping a hand best played closer to the vest (just ask Marah). And that, in the end, is what hinders such an otherwise harmless exercise. Maybe played with more of a wink, the Felice Brothers could be good knowing fun. Played (apparently) straight, all it does is highlight how much better Dylan and the Band channeled the spirit of (in the words of Greil Marcus) the ""old, weird America,"" not by mimicking what came before but by creating their own alternate well of inspirations from which to draw. Why accept a substitute when you can listen to the real, fake thing?","The Felice Brothers perfectly replicate the old, weird Americana of Bob Dylan and the Band, a Phyrric victory.

"Excuse Me, This Is the Yah Mos Def",YMD,by: Rebecca Raber,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b560ea9e61561daa6ddb/1:1/w_160/c537977e.jpg,2008-04-08 06:00:04,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11331-excuse-me-this-is-the-yah-mos-def/,My Pal God,"What's really in a name? Sure, a rose by any other would smell as sweet, but what about a lo-fi Philly hardcore/hip-hop band? Will their skuzzy, spazzy tunes get the attention they deserve if their band name becomes an indistinct cluster of letters? Originally named for an amalgamation of defunct punks the Yah Mos and rapper Mos Def, the Yah Mos Def announced its genre-splicing intentions up front with a name that honored both their punk and hip-hop lineage. But they were forced to rethink their handle when their namesake rapper didn't get the joke and petitioned MySpace to remove their page. Now, sadly, their initialed name means about as much as EMF's. But don't let those bland initials deter you; there is absolutely nothing bland about this debut. Coming on like License to Ill-era Beastie Boys, these vegans from the Philadelphia hardcore scene have built hard-edged, DIY party tracks out of cheap, scratchy beats, old-school boasting, kitschy pop culture references, and nasal, white-boy patter. But what sets Distro and B. Awesome (according to their mothers, Rick Mitchell and Bryan Poerner) apart is the all-encompassing spirit of their punk/rap fusion. Though they rely on the sample-heavy techniques of hip-hop (albeit with much rawer production), their reference points are punk outfits like Franklin and Cap'n Jazz. The 10-track, 27-minute album wastes no time in announcing its intentions. Kicking off with the barely 15-second ""track"" ""Hiltz Is Hot"", which, named for Philly punk legend/former drummer of Born Against Jon Hiltz, is basically just Born Against's ""Neil"" with one small change. Thanks to a cheap cut'n'paste job, the YMD have inserted their band's name into the infamous line, ""Hello shit. We're Born Against. Now suck my fucking lizard."" Then Distro and B. Awesome immediately careen into ""Charles Maggio's Real Last Name Is Ash"", which takes its title from the Rorschach frontman/Gern Blandsten founder. Introducing their sense of humor, points of view, and B. Awesome's snotty, Ad-Rock-on-helium flow, the track encompasses rhymes about former notorious Philadelphia mayor Wilson Goode, Ian Svenonius, Weston, Rakim, and Bel Biv DeVoe (""I'm Michael Bivins/ ABC's how I make a living/ Your skills are starved/ Getting carved like Thanksgiving""). Even though they make a lot of jokes, don't make the mistake of dismissing them as one. Yes, their songs are strewn with blink-and-you'll-miss-'em scene in-jokes and winking braggadocio (""We're flossing MCs like a fucking dentist""), but the YMD isn't MC Lars. In between playing Name That Tune with the samples and recognizing silly shout-outs to the Gordon Gartrelle shirt that Denise made Theo on The Cosby Show, you will be sucked in by the infectious, nerdy joy of these songs. Will those in the know love ""Global Liberation Army"" more because they recognize Ian MacKaye's cheeky introduction to Beefeater's House Burning Down? Sure, but those that don't know Ian MacKaye from Ian McKellen will enjoy the feedback-drenched track, its adrenalized drums and the charmingly amateur quality of its rhymes. And though Bikini Kill fans jonesing for a Kathleen Hanna fix will perk up at the strains of Pussy Whipped's ""Hamster Baby"" driving ""Bathing My Hamster In Nail Polish Remover"", the rhymes about Paul Weller and Vanilla Silk soy milk set against blaring-alarm guitars and A.D.D.-addled beats will be enough to sustain the interest of any listener, no matter how limited their knowledge of punk history. One of the few things that hardcore has always had in common with hip-hop is hometown scene loyalty, and the YMD certainly tout theirs. Excuse Me, This Is the Yah Mos Def is a virtual mash note to the City of Brotherly Love; Philly even gets its own thank-you in the liner notes. ""New Direction"" calls out many local neighborhoods, from Fishtown to Bryn Mawr (or, in the band's own lexicon, ""From East Falls to these balls""), and the city's local music and sports legends are touted throughout. So, much like cheesesteaks, the YMD-- no matter what you call them-- is an addictive, if hard-on-your-heart, delicacy that could be from nowhere else.","Coming on like License to Ill-era Beastie Boys, these vegans from the Philadelphia hardcore scene have built hard-edged, DIY party tracks out of cheap, scratchy beats.

"The Singles, Volume Five: 1967-1969",James Brown,by: Douglas Wolk,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b51d9d034d5c69bf4f84/1:1/w_160/621ce2ec.jpg,2008-04-08 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11275-the-singles-volume-five-1967-1969/,Hip-O SelectHip-O,"James Brown was brilliant and terrible, a breathtaking innovator and an inept imitator, and even at his peak you never knew which he was going to be on any given day. The fifth volume of Hip-O's mail-order-only comprehensive collection of his singles catches him at both his extremes. These 43 tracks include 11 chart hits, some of them as good as anything anybody recorded in the 1960s-- ""I Can't Stand Myself (When You Touch Me)"", ""Say It Loud - I'm Black and I'm Proud"", and the unbelievable, skeletal vamp ""Give It Up or Turnit a Loose"", which Alan Leeds' liner notes point out is full of instrumental errors, but, as Leeds puts it, ""what's wrong with a couple fumbles if the team wins the game?"" Some of the other hits, though, you may not have heard of, perhaps with good reason: the undistinguished ballads ""I Guess I'll Have to Cry, Cry, Cry"" and ""Goodbye My Love"", and especially ""America Is My Home"", a patriotic recitation that got him in as much trouble with the Left as his July 1968 tour of Vietnam to entertain troops. (He promptly won radicals back with ""Say It Loud,"" the hottest anthem of the Black Power movement-- which he stopped playing live a few months later.) The great side of Brown-- aphoristic, emphatic, so rhythmically sharp he could slice diamonds with a grunt-- had two insanely awesome bands in the period documented here. One was his touring group, led by Alfred ""Pee Wee"" Ellis; the other was a white funk band from Cincinnati, the Dapps, who dropkicked ""I Can't Stand Myself"" out of the stadium. Their bassist Tim Drummond subsequently joined the Ellis ensemble for a while (and went on to play with Bob Dylan during his born-again period), and Brown noted that ""Tim's not a white bass player, he's my bass player."" Both the Dapps and the James Brown Band cranked out instrumental singles during this period, sometimes identified by each other's names, and usually working variations on J.B.'s hits: ""Bringing Up the Guitar"" revives a groove from ""Cold Sweat"" (and would later turn into ""The Popcorn""), ""Gittin' a Little Hipper"" does the same for ""Get It Together"", the two-part ""Shades of Brown"" recalls ""Ain't That a Groove"", ""Believers Shall Enjoy (Non Believers Shall Suffer)"" is a vamp from ""Maybe the Last Time"". This set also includes a pair of killer two-part instrumentals, ""Soul Pride"" and ""In the Middle"", on which Soul Brother #1 doesn't actually play. And then there's the embarrassing side of James Brown: the megalomaniac who thought he was a great keyboard player... or a good keyboard player. A lot of his singles at the time featured instrumental B-sides with piano or organ overdubs by Brown, and he had a habit of mixing his part to be twice as loud as the rest of the band. That might be acceptable if he didn't play more clams than a barrel of chowder: the two-part ""Maybe Good, Maybe Bad"" is far too optimistically titled, and he seems to keep forgetting what key ""Here I Go"" is in. As with every volume in the series, though, there are some peculiar, lesser-known wonders here. 1968's trio of Christmas singles (banged out in three days in October) includes a fabulous little jam called ""Santa Claus Goes Straight to the Ghetto"", and the Bobby Byrd duet ""Licking Stick - Licking Stick"" points toward the spiky cross-chatter of his 1970 band. Even better is ""You Got to Have a Job"", a January 1969 duet with his companion from the Vietnam trip, soul howler Marva Whitney. The two of them call for saxophonist Maceo Parker to solo-- the same trick Brown had used as far back as ""Cold Sweat"" (mid-1967 was an eternity ago, at the speed his music was evolving). But they keep crowing ""Maceo!"" back and forth at each other, just for the joy of showing off their loud, glorious powers.","James Brown was brilliant and terrible, a breathtaking innovator and an inept imitator, and even at his peak you never knew which he was going to be on any given day.

Rabbit Habits,Man Man,by: Adam Moerder,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b58d5e6ef959693227b2/1:1/w_160/213bad01.jpg,2008-04-08 06:00:02,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11370-rabbit-habits/,Anti-,"Lead singer Honus Honus kicks off Man Man's third album with the line ""Been locked down way too long,"" and he ain't kidding. Despite the temptation to revere/revile the Philly band as a homogenous curio, people forget Man Man's comprised of real people with real emotions. Forget the porn 'staches and Zappa/Beefheart/Waits funhouse gags, 2006's Six Demon Bag was, at the end of the day, an incredibly poignant confessional. In between three-ring antics, Honus lost his heart (and shit) over and over again, most memorably on the standout ballad ""Van Helsing Boombox"", pining to ""sleep for weeks like a dog at her feet."" Fast forward to Rabbit Habits and you'll find Honus still howling like a dog, but of a different breed. Dubbed by the band as their ""pop record,"" Habits knows that sex sells, and suddenly Man Man's starting to sound less archaic. Habits's steady rock swagger and listener-friendly songwriting stands to convert haters while also retaining the band's beloved quirks: You won't need to rent Fiddler on the Roof or own a hurdy gurdy to appreciate this record, just a libido and willingness to rock out. There's a tendency for a band's maturation to deep-six most their unqiue tics, but Man Man pull a Houdini by releasing an album that simultaneously showcases them at their most cogent and carefree. Unlike past albums, there's not so much garage sale rummaging as search and destroy songwriting. The band's dedicated to nailing certain ideas within the allotted track time and often does so. As a result, we get ""Mister Jung Stuffed"" and ""Top Drawer"", two of Man Man's most single-ready works and the finest entry points for Habits. The latter's particularly jarring, not only because of its confrontational lyrics and brothel boogie, but also for its stark contrast to the romantically waylaid Honus of Six Demon Bag: ""People claim I'm possessed by the devil/ But Mama, I know I'm possessed by your daughter!"" Throughout the record, Honus focuses less on himself than a rogue's gallery of offbeat characters. ""Hurly/Burly"" tells the tale of a pair of fuckups at odds with society, replete with two refrains of existential screams and the hushed mid-song disclaimer ""This ain't no love song."" That street urchin angst spills over into ""The Ballad of Butter Beans"", where Honus makes death threats to the title character over a Looney Tunes xylophone. In a testament to their refined craftmanship, the debauchery comes full circle by the eight-minute ""Poor Jackie"", an emotionally dampened gypsy stomp that turns a cold shoulder to its star-crossed subject: ""I don't see what everybody/ Sees in your sexy body/ All I see is a shallow grave/ Trapped inside a pretty face."" By the song's conclusion, the band practically dances on her grave, calling out a boisterous horn section before launching into a capella mock gospel and declaring, ""There ain't no God here."" Habits has little to apologize for, no serious blemishes or ill-advised shifts in direction. So why does it fall a hair short of Six Demon Bag, despite being a more cohesive effort? Partly because organization doesn't quite suit Man Man, but moreso because Habits sounds tailored for the stage. Even intimate ballads like ""Doo Right"" and the title track seem more like bellyaching than Honus coming apart at the seams. Still, what we've lost in a bedroom companion we've gained in one of the year's best rock albums (devoid of nearly any guitar parts, mind you). After making a case for melancholy hobo rock, Man Man's not begging for quarters or kisses anymore. Like a vagabond stumbling upon a sack of gold, they're now ready to hit the town and live a little.","Man Man follow their breakthrough Six Demon Bag with their self-confessed ""pop record,"" an album that hints at maturation without eschewing the group's unique tics.

Sings Live!,Colin Meloy,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b5975e6ef959693227c1/1:1/w_160/3cc01bee.jpg,2008-04-08 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11380-sings-live/,Kill Rock Stars,"The title of this solo, acoustic tour LP is accurate, yet potentially misleading. It conjures images of a white-tuxedoed lounge singer, voice as smooth as good vermouth, working through the standards with intimate asides and PG-rated innuendos on the side. It's funny to imagine Meloy as such a character, because he's essentially the opposite: self-conscious and bookish instead of blithe and effortlessly cool. The vocal interpreter sets love stories amid contemporary urban centers; Meloy orchestrates romantic tragedies in exotic period locales. This isn't the first time that Meloy has used the classic ""Sings"" format, although it is the first time he's bringing it to retail. Two previous tour-only EPs covered Morrissey and Shirley Collins. But again, Meloy put his own twist on the tradition. When Mel Torme sang Fred Astaire, or Frank Sinatra sang the Cole Porter songbook, the fundamental idea was the intersection of two musical greats. Torme and Sinatra could captivate a crowd with just charisma; Meloy usually uses elaborate props and ornate arrangements. His Sings albums sound more like a fan's love letters to his idols than a meeting of titans on a level playing field. Sings Live! is a little different, because it's unseemly to write love letters to one's self, and Meloy handles the material with a blend of irony and self-effacement that becomes its own kind of very modern charm. The set includes a broad variety of material: songs from Picaresque, Her Majesty the Decemberists, and Castaways and Cutouts, alongside rarities like ""Devil's Elbow"" (from Meloy's former band, Tarkio) and ""Bandit Queen"" (from the Picaresqueties EP), plus a handful of partial covers and unreleased songs. The mood is convivial during the lulls, as Meloy chats up the crowd in the dry manner of comedian John Hodgman, but turns somber during the songs-- you can practically hear the lights dimming. Stripped-down versions of album tracks are reverently delivered, exposing the affecting melodies that underlie Decemberists' bombastic arrangements, without which they all sound kind of similar. Meloy nods to his inspirations as he sings himself. A snippet of Fleetwood Mac's ""Dreams"" piggybacks on ""Here I Dreamt I Was an Architect"", and a chunk of the Smiths' ""Ask"" closes out ""Youth and Beauty Brigade"". Meloy is more of an assimilator than an interpreter, and the covers, like the Tarkio track, wind up sounding like Decemberists songs, too. Indie music fans are prone to filter even the most intimate experience though a sarcastic veil, and it's this weird dichotomy that characterizes Meloy's interaction with his audience. The making of the live album is mentioned often enough that it might have been titled Colin Meloy Sings Live About Singing Live. On the ""Evoking a Campfire Singalong"" interlude, he says with a touch of weariness, ""The other thing about these solo shows is that they're set up to be like campfire sing-alongs, so you're welcome to sing along as much as you like."" The audience hoots and hollers, but judging from the silence surrounding the songs, no one took the offer seriously. Nor did Meloy: ""Kumbaya"", he says with an audible wink before launching into ""The Gymnast, High Above the Ground"", putting a knowing spin on what might otherwise be perceived as an earnest gesture. It's as if a bunch of people have gotten together to try and create a communal experience they don't quite believe in. It's a little depressing here, but elsewhere, the sense of irony serves the album well. One of the unreleased songs, ""Wonder"", is a fine, standard Decemberists-style tune. The other, ""Dracula's Daughter"", is introduced at length by Meloy as ""the worst song I've ever written."" He isn't exaggerating. It's a genuinely heinous song. The guitar part is bad. The lyrics are worse. ""You think you've got it bad? Try having Dracula for your dad."" Meloy plays it slapstick, repeatedly pausing to amplify on a forthcoming cringe-worthy bit, and his audience relishes the kitsch with him. Of course, this kind of self-laceration is only possible because he's got plenty of good songs to balance out this one, which serves to undermine the self-serious impression you might take away from Decemberists albums. It's the rare case where an awful song actually makes an album better.","The Decemberists singer offers his third solo, acoustic record-- the first two found him covering Morrissey and Shirley Collins-- and handles the material with a blend of irony and self-effacement that becomes its own kind of very modern charm.

Disintoxication,The Secret,by: Cosmo Lee,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b538c0084474cd0c23b9/1:1/w_160/003e7901.jpg,2008-04-07 06:00:05,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11299-disintoxication/,Goodfellow,"Italy's the Secret are fascinatingly American. They sing in English, the lingua franca of today's globalized metal and hardcore punk. They sound a lot like Converge, America's most vital hardcore punk band. Americans rent metal from Europeans, but they own hardcore punk. As with any subculture, such nuances are obvious to insiders, but obscure to outsiders. ""All that yelling,"" people complain. ""I would like metal except for the vocals."" The trick is to stop hearing words in vocals and start hearing sound in them. As an instrument, Marco Coslovich's voice isn't much. It really is just yelling. But its caustic timbre perfectly tucks into its distorted surroundings. He yells-- and doesn't-- in all the right places. What he yells isn't important; the liner notes print no lyrics (though the band's MySpace does). Instead, when the booklet opens up, it shrouds itself-- daguerreotype grays, Photoshopped whites, somber black on black. The album sounds like this, too. The Secret's debut, 2004's Luce (Italian for ""light""), was relatively brighter. Its framework was angular, metallic hardcore punk, but its sophisticated harmonic sense suggested musical training behind its tattoos. Disintoxication drops most color for a hundred shades of black. Born of ""depression, attempted suicides, jail, nervous breakdowns, anti-depressant abuse, and pretty much anything negative you can think about,"" it's leaner, meaner, and more unshaven than Luce. The recording perfectly captures this, sounding like an incendiary rehearsal. It's similar to Kurt Ballou's sizzlingly electric production for Converge. Guitars are gloriously ragged; one can practically hear the rust in the cymbals. Flamethrower vocals, a beautiful smudge of a layout, sound shaped like an old warhead-- who needs language? Yet the album precipitates into layers. Rolling drums and bloodstained chords begrime ""Intoxication"". However, it eventually sheds such sackcloth for a naked, keening dirge. Tritones swarm ""Saul"", then disappear into an effluent of tunneling drums and sandpaper screams. ""Inferno"" seizes into a death grip of grim syncopation. The left guitar of ""In Limbo"" claws like fingernails on arms, while the right one spills scarlet sheets-- my bloody valentine, indeed. These are but feverish detours, though, en route to a thrilling final four. ""Funeral Monolith"" earns its name with huge, hulking riffs; ""Death to Pigs"" drapes darkly jeweled chords over desperate polka beats. In ""Kill the Dead"", dreamy jangles hover uneasily over a roiling rhythm section. The deliberate accents of ""Umea"" strip the bombast from Led Zeppelin's ""Kashmir"", tear out its heart, and fill its skeleton with gravel and despond. A whining melody snakes through the gaping hole in its chest. Coslovich's howl could skin knees; his words are completely unintelligible yet horrifyingly comprehensible.","This Italian band's 2004 debut was relatively brighter, with an angular, metallic hardcore punk framework and a sophisticated harmonic sense that suggested musical training behind its tattoos; Disintoxication drops most color for a hundred shades of black.

Birds,Collections of Colonies of Bees,by: Roque Strew,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b55f5e6ef95969322766/1:1/w_160/ae38693a.jpg,2008-04-07 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11330-birds/,Table of the ElementsRadium,"The birds and the bees: it's rock's quintessential subject. But is it a post-rock subject? In a way, it turns out. The name Collections of Colonies of Bees may call to mind spreadsheets, microscope slides, caffeinated Poindexters in white frocks, and, of course, the honey-bearing fairies that grace Cheerios boxes and a Rimsky-Korsakov interlude. The suggestions of the scientific and the imaginative fit this Milwaukee quintet to a T. Clearly, these people pay attention to names-- words carry heavy burdens, after all, in the taciturn deserts of post-rock. So when small winged creatures pop up on their fifth full-length, Birds, we take note. Given the name ""Flocks"", the record's four movements have a sense not only of flight, but of a group moving gracefully in unison. Formed in 1998, the Bees have spent a decade polishing their act and aesthetic. This is especially obvious in their renowned live sets (recently gushed over in Bon Iver's Guest List), which form the basis of Birds. These are not straightforward jam sessions. Organic and intricate as their compositions can be, the Bees clearly appreciate the emotional power of simple, thoughtfully tiered rhythms, as the opening movement ""Flocks I"" attests. Sometimes these rhythms are crafted out of crunchy guitar riffs, sometimes they are pieced together out of digital fragments, a technique they perfected on 2004's Customer. The amalgam falls somewhere between the drawn-out drama of Explosions in the Sky and Eno's furniture music, the concept-art relaxant. ""Flocks II"" begins as a gorgeous vista snapping in and out of view. Sublimity is drawn with tiny flecks of digital noise, cut-up keyboards, and softly shimmering tides of sound, giving the impression of a misty metropolis, the frenzy of light and noise glimpsed from the top of a skyscraper. The neon-pastoral ambiance is broken by Jon Mueller's majestic kit work. Thankfully, his drumming survives the band's slice-and-dice, collage instinct-- the Bees have learned the if-it-ain't-broke principle. Later in the song, unassuming riffs and keyboard figures enter the scene, cozying up to each other and easing into soothing grooves. Capturing the band's dual loyalty to the computer's possibilities and to rock's apparatus, this movement outshines the first. With a similarly tentative intro, ""Flocks III"" tiptoes in the midst of fluttery, manipulated guitars, its air of wind-chime serenity torn up by the percussion: a clockwork kick drum announcing that meditation time is over. The song picks up as the cymbals rattle, more and more violently. Abruptly at the four-minute mark, everything settles down, the silence surrendering to a few lonely plinks, then an equally lonely strum, then a jaunty and jazzily martial snare. Soon a full-blown song emerges, a moonlit wash of cymbals and guitars built on top of the drumbeat. You could say the tension between the dreamy surface and the more robotic, more rational undercurrents, marks the entire album. The interplay also links Birds back to the early avant-folk of their career, as two former members of Pele sought to update bluegrass with technology. Airy, slack, the beginning of ""Flocks IV"" gives off a soft-focus, 1970s glow. As it repeats hypnotically, a squiggle of guitar, bent into a funky, Oriental shape, distracts the listener from the less interesting theatrics in the background. Two thirds into the song, as the tempo climbs upward, the Bees offer a welcome (and less literal) change of pace. A sharper-edged, ragged guitar maneuvers into the picture as a Rhodes chimes and floats above and, briefly, an army of bongos quarter noisily underneath. As this Reichian moment slips away into static, the album ends on an uplifting note. Never lapsing into the doom and gloom of their stylistic peers, the Bees have eased into a mature, mesmerizing style that is finally and wholly their own.","Milwaukee post-rock outfit's fifth album falls somewhere between the drawn-out drama of Explosions in the Sky and Eno's furniture music.

Lagos is considered a 21st century ""megacity"" teetering on the brink of total chaos when it's not already embroiled in it. ""As a picture of the urban future,"" wrote author George Packer, ""Lagos is fascinating only if you're able to leave it."" Lagos wasn't always like this, nor was Nigeria as a whole. In fact, just about 40 years ago, following the end of the Biafran War, Nigeria briefly experienced a huge economic and cultural boom, its oil revenues generating billions, the nation thriving, and the country producing an impressive number of artists, writers, and musicians. As far as the musicians go, many still only know Nigeria for Afrobeat pioneer Fela Kuti. Some are also familiar with some combination of juju masters King Sunny Adé and Ebenezer Obey, the perfectly nicknamed highlife star Christogonus Ezebuiro ""Sir Warrior"" Obinna of the nebulous Oriental Brothers International Band, but they still represent just the tip of a vast West African iceberg. Fela's not included on the illuminating 2xCD Nigeria Special: Modern Highlife, Afro-Sounds & Nigerian Blues, but members of his pre-Afrobeat highlife band the Koola Lobitos are, playing in the Don Isaac Ezekiel Combination. Ebenezer Obey's not here, but the man who allegedly taught him how to play, Easy Kabaka Brown, is. ""There are thousands of tracks by popular and not-so-popular bands that are still yet to be issued outside of West Africa,"" writes curator Miles Cleret in the well-researched liner notes. That diversity, those numbers, and those colorful yet almost unknowable names are part of the challenge in compiling any collection of African music, especially drawing from a region as fruitful as the continent's northwest chunk. It's also no doubt what keeps many from diving in and exploring on their own. But if little on Nigeria Special sticks out for the neophyte or casual fan, all the better: The comp is the perfect place to start if you want to move beyond the better known heavy hitters of Nigerian music. What makes Nigeria Special doubly useful is that, per its subtitle, it doesn't just rely on funk or dance music. Instead, on Disc One, we get acts like the Funkees, with their soulful, organ-driven ""Akula Owu Onyeara"", or the trancelike, percussion-heavy ""Oja Omoba"" from Dele Ojo & His Star Brothers Band. St. Augustine & His Rovers Dance Band offer the unfailingly peppy ""Onwu Ama Dike"", while ""Feso Jaiye"" from the Sahara All Stars of Jos, is downright mellow in its sax, guitar and electric piano explorations. The Nigerian Police Force Band plays Afrobeat in a more familiar mold on Disc Two, their ""Asiko Ni Mi"" clearly indebted to Fela. Easy Kabaka Brown's band, Opotopo, plays up the West African-Caribbean connection in ""Belema"". The Hykkers' ""I Want a Break Thru"" is wah-wah infused psychedelic instrumental rock. The (again, perfectly named) Dan Satch & His Atomic 8 Dance Band of Aba contribute the tightly syncopated polyrhythms of ""Alabeke"", featuring a smoking guitar solo. Any one of these tracks may be eye opening on their own. Taken as a whole, the comp itself is as revelatory as it is incessantly enjoyable. Pop history has rarely gone down so painlessly. ""Thousands of tracks"" yet to be issued, claims Cleret? As long as they're this beautifully packaged and presented, bring 'em on.","Two discs of obscure but stellar Nigerian pop and rock from the country's creative golden age, compiled by Soundway, the folks behind the awesome Ghana Soundz comps?

If you don't own any of their music, buying all their albums and listening to each and every one of their songs in alphabetical order (an undertaking that'd take less than four hours, B-sides included) wouldn't tell you much less about their career's arc than a chronological study would. The formula they hinted at on 1997 debut single ""IPC Subeditors Dictate Our Youth"" and got down to a science on 2000's Internal Wrangler has expanded only slightly, and while there've been some noticeable shifts in production style (especially on 2002's crisp and glossy Walking With Thee), there's not much that sonically separates a decade-old Clinic song from what they're up to today. But maybe there's just not enough room for any other ideas: Clinic's aesthetic has already incorporated snatches of punk, doo-wop, garage psych, Krautrock, hard bop, mid '70s Miami disco, the film scores of Ennio Morricone, Augustus Pablo-informed dub (complete with melodica), Phil Spector girl-group pop, a few decades' worth of rockabilly, and antediluvian European folk music. It's all contained in an intricate frameworkt hat risks falling apart entirely if it's tweaked too much, and if that means that the same rhythms and melodies and moods keep cropping up in familiar ways, well, at least that sound hasn't gotten any worse. And while it's pretty easy to predict what you'll hear on their new album Do It!, especially if their last couple albums (the water-treading but enjoyable Winchester Cathedral and the slightly weirder, slightly better Visitations) are any indication, it's not the kind of predictability that results in disappointment. Despite the fact that there's still some old reliable structures underpinning Do It!-- the aforementioned parade of references wrapped around their playbook of big cabaret stomps, swing rhythms, shoegaze drones, and waltz-time R&B-- this new album might be Clinic's most adventurous since Internal Wrangler. Clinic songs are usually recognizable as such within less than 10 seconds, with or without the buzzing wail of lead singer Ade Blackburn, and that's still the case. Usually the giveaway relies on a combination of Carl Turney's organically metronomic drumming-- heavy clomping gallops or delicate cymbal rides, depending on the mood-- and Hartley's guitar, which sounds like nearly nobody else in rock, whether he's coaxing slow strums, sharp twangs or fuzzed-out violence out of his instrument. But they often find themselves in uncharacteristic contexts; there's a couple of surprising moments of acoustic demi-blues, like the freight train rattle of ""Tomorrow"" (think Led Zeppelin's ""Bron-Y-Aur Stomp"" with hints of Internal Wrangler track ""T.K."") and the 3/4 swoon of ""Mary& Eddie"", which eventually explodes into a foghorn-accompanied burst of trapeze-act acid rock. And there are other curveballs: Opener ""Memories"" makes like it's going to be one of their burlesque-rhythm boogie numbers (i.e. ""2nd Foot Stomp"" and ""Vertical Takeoff in Egypt""), but dips into a smart little bit of summery Beach Boys organ for the chorus, while ""Free Not Free"" bookends and interrupts an otherwise-tranquil bit of slow-dance reverie with a brief, snarling riff that sounds like some unhinged class-of-66 garage band scoring a bullfight. Blackburn, still murmuring half-intelligible lyrics with the same spooky whine, has aced a perplexing syntax that gives these songs a labyrinthine, off-putting sense of psychological unease: ""Knowing the chapters here that you close/ Fill in the gaps as half your mind is gone"" (""Emotions""); ""See yourself outside your skin here/ See yourself outside you for miles"" (""Free Not Free""); ""You stitch who you always wanted/ Now your thoughts begin to fray"" (""High Coin""). And even when they stick to their old blueprint-- ""The Witch (Made to Measure)"", ""Emotions"", and ""Winged Wheel"" sound a bit like 10 other songs they've already done, except better-- Clinic play with a renewed sense of the same eerie raucousness that drew people to them in the first place; this would be an easy second-album recommendation for a new fan after they've initially discovered and absorbed Internal Wrangler. Clinic could still stand to stretch their legs just a bit more-- it's still inexplicable for a band this savvy about groove-minded freakouts that they've never recorded a song longer than four and a half minutes-- but any band that's staved off stagnancy while still sounding more or less like they did a decade in the past shouldn't worry too much about messing with a good thing.","Despite the fact that there's still some old reliable structures underpinning Do It!, this new album might be Clinic's most adventurous since Internal Wrangler.

Dig!!! Lazarus Dig!!!,Nick Cave & the Bad Seeds,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bdbb5e6ef95969323104/1:1/w_160/c1ed6358.jpg,2008-04-07 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11375-dig-lazarus-dig/,Anti-,"This is how rock musicians are supposed to age. At 50, Nick Cave's hairline is receding, but he's turned that setback into a ""look,"" growing out his locks and cultivating the coolest mustache in the industry. Over 30 years, first with the Birthday Party and then with the Bad Seeds, he has refined his lurid growl and lascivious subject matter-- the usuals: sex, death, God, murder, redemption, all in the most brutal and salaciously poetical terms possible-- without losing any of his charisma or menace. During the past decade alone, despite sounding hoarse on No More Shall We Part and Nocturama, he has transformed his swagger into a potent brand of musical and amoral authority, honing his persona in tandem with the Bad Seeds, who a few years ago were one of the tightest and most versatile backing bands around and have only gotten better with each release. Prior to the recording of Cave's latest album, longtime guitarist/piano player Blixa Bargeld left the Bad Seeds and multi-instrumentalist Warren Ellis, of the Dirty Three, assumed a more prominent role. So maybe it's the line-up changes, or even the thrown-down gauntlet of Cave's side project Grinderman, or perhaps some other unnamed stimulus, but the Bad Seeds sound even edgier and more sophisticated on Dig, Lazarus, Dig!!!, providing a fitting pulpit for their bandleader's ravings. With the emphasis on acoustic guitars with occasional blasts of electric static, there's little of the distortion that colored Grinderman's album, but plenty of odd noises and lewd organs that suggest some sort of twisted take on 1960s psych and garage rock. Cave and the Seeds kick out the jams, kick in the Doors. ""Today's Lesson"" and ""Lie Down Here (& Be My Girl)"" are fierce, yet lean, while ballads like ""Moonland"" and ""Hold On to Yourself"" offset that energy with eerie nocturnal ambience. Just as surely as the 2004 double-decker Abattoir Blues/The Lyre of Orpheus was Cave's England album-- steeped in imagery that's equal parts urban-miserable Dickens and pagan-pastoral Wicker Man-- Dig, Lazarus, Dig!!! is his Americanized follow-up. He has always been interested in the darker corners of Americana, especially the Southern mythologies that informed early albums like From Her to Eternity and The Firstborn Is Dead, and Cave makes this collection an old-fashioned picaresque through exurban shopping malls, shuttered factories, and dilapidated ranches-- complete with Biblical overtones (and what's a Nick Cave album without those?). The opening title track, with its fierce strut and taunting floor-tom tattoo, opens on Lazarus newly resurrected, a fame junkie traipsing westward before ending up ""back in the streets of New York, in a soup queue, a dope fiend, a slave."" Cave spins the yarn not as a fire-and-brimstone sermon, but more like a sardonic Sunday school lesson-- and pretty funny to boot. Even the writers Cave namedrops are almost exclusively Americans: Ernest Hemingway, Charles Bukowski, and John Berryman, whom Cave, like the Hold Steady and Okkervil River, extols beyond all others. To his considerable credit, Cave may be the only rock musician who convincingly doubles as a literary critic. Such pretensions are built into his persona and tempered with his awareness that rock and roll is ultimately low-brow and therefore a subversive vessel for high-bow concerns. In other words, he has a lot more to say about Lolita than Sting ever did. As on ""There She Goes, My Beautiful World"" on Abattoir Blues, Cave assails all things bookish on ""We Call Upon the Author"", a rip-roaring metafictional rocker that questions not only the need for suffering on Earth, but Cave's own fascination with it. Mingling lines like ""myxamatoid kids spraddle the streets"" with base puns like ""I feel like a vacuum cleaner, a complete sucker,"" Cave implies the author in question might be himself or it might be God, which makes the song-ending shout all the ballsier: ""Prolix! Prolix! Nothing a pair of scissors can't fix!"" When Cave isn't editing the Bible, he's moving Dig, Lazarus, Dig!!! westward-- the trajectory of so many American stories-- through the heartland and into the Southwest, through the hilariously iniquitous ""Today's Lesson"" and into ""Albert Goes West"", set in the ""vast, indifferent deserts of Arizona."" As always, it's a strange road trip, with Cave keeping the car between the lines while Ellis messes with the radio. Their collaboration has intensified over the fourteen years since the violinist joined the band for Henry's Dream, and Ellis has obviously called shotgun on Dig, Lazarus, Dig!!! His strange noises color every track: the sinister wind-up music box sounds on ""Today's Lesson"", the gentle flute solo on the surprisingly tender ""Jesus of the Moon"", the delicate violin wheeze behind ""Night of the Lotus Eaters"". All of Cave's albums aim to unsettle, but rarely have he and the Bad Seeds managed to do it so efficiently, so gracefully, or so forcefully. It all culminates in the haunted closer ""More News from Nowhere"", on which Cave does Homer doing Dylan to sum up what sounds like his whole career. Ellis fiddles while America burns, and Cave sings, almost sweetly, ""It's strange in here. Yeah, it gets stranger every year."" Amen to that.","This is how rock musicians are supposed to age.

Love Is Real,John Maus,by: Aaron Leitko,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b525c0084474cd0c2398/1:1/w_160/d390fdf3.jpg,2008-04-04 06:00:05,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11283-love-is-real/,Upset the Rhythm,"Imagine that you are watching a bizarro version of the 1985 fantasy flop Legend. Here Tom Cruise has been replaced by new wave-singer/possible-alien ____Klaus Nomi. The film is run at half speed. Pink snow falls on a gray meadow while Nomi strikes the pose of an anguished clown. Unicorns weep. This just about sums up the mood that dominates Love Is Real, the second record by Ariel Pink associate John Maus. Here the tragic collides with the ridiculous in the most garish way possible, and it's never quite clear whether you're supposed to laugh or cry. It's as if a gang of drag queens walked into the sessions for Joy Division's Closer and exploded. Love Is Real finds Maus putting synth-pop through the washing machine until all of its vibrant sounds have turned to colorless reverb-drenched mush. On ""Heaven is Real"" the Austin, Minnesota-based musician projects sticky melodrama through new-age keyboards and half-hearted drum machines. ""You don't have to run anymore,"" chants Maus in a warbling baritone that sounds positively cadaverous. Similarly, ""Do Your Best"" brings the pulse down to a crawl as Maus slow-motion croons ""Reach out to the one you love/ In the city tonight/ You've got to get it right/ In the city tonight"" through a bed of shimmering synthesizers. It's gaudy, glittery, and cold-- simultaneously a parody of overwrought balladry and the loneliest, most desolate song ever. These are Love Is Real's finest songs and they're really, really creepy. But if you can't get into Maus' whole lo-fi-spiritual-anguish-as-brought-to-you-by-Falco thing, there's not much else here to pick over. For every thrillingly creepy 80s dirge that the record has to offer, there's at least two tracks of boneheaded filler. ""Too Much Money"" and ""Don't Worship the Devil"" are thin and skipable gags. The less said about ""Rights for Gays""-- a faux-disco prank where Maus sings the lyrics ""Tie them to a fence post/ Pow, pow, pow, pow, pow/ Rights for gays and medical care for every one!""-- the better. It's hard to make an album that's truly creepy these days. You can only get so far detuning your guitar and cribbing your lyrics from the back pages of Fangoria-- that path has been worn bare. But through a surprising combination of nostalgia and clumsiness Maus has stumbled into an eerie and claustrophobic realm that most full-on rock bands can't access anymore. As Love Is Real's Catholic Mass-inspired elegy ""Tenebrae"" escalates towards an ostentatious climax of Clockwork Orange-style keyboard fanfare Maus begins to chant the words ""Sing to the mystery of his blood"" and it's obvious that-- even if it is diluted by trifling filler-- Love as Real has succeeded in finding a softer, gentler way of guiding you to a gothy place.","Longtime underground music figure and recent Ariel Pink associate puts a bizarre and creepy spin on synth-pop wherein the tragic collides with the ridiculous in the most garish way possible.

A Sense of Purpose,In Flames,by: Cosmo Lee,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b57db1335d7bf169a8ed/1:1/w_160/e3523cd7.jpg,2008-04-04 06:00:04,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11357-a-sense-of-purpose/,KochNuclear Blast,"In the ever-conservative metal community, In Flames are most notorious for their change in sound. After the initial stumble of 1994's Lunar Strain, the Gothenburg-based quintet released The Jester Race, Whoracle, and Colony. This trilogy is widely considered In Flames' ""classic"" period. In contrast to the rough-hewn death metal of the early 90s, the Swedish melodic variant sped up Iron Maiden and replaced singing with growling. The result was aggressive yet accessible. Peers like Dark Tranquillity and At the Gates helped propagate the Gothenburg sound, but In Flames were arguably its bellwether by being its least idiosyncratic. Though limited to standard minor tonalities, their riffs and harmonies were exuberant and sometimes epic. Imitators quickly arose; the guitar harmonies of today's metalcore and emo owe much to In Flames. On 2000's Clayman, the band began to tinker with its formula. Riffs contained more space, and clean tones occasionally leavened the heaviness. Clayman was the transition to In Flames' current sound, which began with the aptly named Reroute to Remain. Industrial/electronic touches popped up, as did male and female singing. A slight rock feel began to alloy the previous metallic precision. For metal, such changes were experimental, but they yielded a more mainstream sound (one later-era video featured a most un-metallic wet t-shirt car wash). Accordingly, In Flames' appeal broadened and now they shift six figures per record. A Sense of Purpose continues along this path, and is neither the triumph nor disaster it has been held up to be. Its one experiment is an eight-minute attempt at Radiohead that feels much longer. Otherwise, the band revisits its latter-day ideas: hooky riffs, mid-paced tempos, and a tug-of-war between rock's immediacy and metal's ambition. ""The Mirror's Truth"" and ""Delight and Angers"" are basically the same song, toggling between simplistic riffs and baroque harmonies. ""Move Through Me"" is a dead ringer for Soilwork, a Swedish colleague whose artistic trajectory has mirrored In Flames'. Anders Fridén is still screaming about nothing, though his disclosure that ""I feel like shit/ But at least I feel something"" is clumsily poignant. The plodding ""Alias"" is catchy through perseverance, ramming home its melody until the listener capitulates. Yet grace abounds. Eighteen years into their career, In Flames wield a subtle instrumental fluency, almost in spite of their songs. Adherents like Shadows Fall and Killswitch Engage merely run through thirds-based harmonies, but In Flames dissect and upend them. The guitar break in ""The Mirror's Truth"" flowers into luscious blues bends and darting neoclassical runs. The fluid solo in ""Move Through Me"" recalls Marty Friedman's succulent licks in Megadeth. ""I'm the Highway"" has soaring harmonies that evoke In Flames' classic records. The bridge in ""Alias"" is also old hat, but it's some of the tastiest acoustic work in metal since Metallica's glory days. Unlike that band's wild stylistic leaps, In Flames have steadily continued to advance the ball. They may not gain much yardage sometimes, but they're still in possession.","The Swedish metal band continues to broaden its appeal and embrace a more mainstream sound, to the despair of some of its longtime metal fans.

Little Death,Pete & the Pirates,by: Amy Granzin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b4eb5e6ef959693226b0/1:1/w_160/3ce13aec.jpg,2008-04-04 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11231-little-death/,Stolen,"Music journalist Rob Sheffield famously described New Zealand pop band the Clean (famously among Flying Nun enthusiasts, anyhow) as what the Velvets would sound like if they ""had ever been deported to an island of 6 million sheep."" Pete and the Pirates, then, are the Clean if Kilgour & co. forsook their homeland's livestock-freckled landscape for a thickly populated post-industrial UK burgh. ""Ill Love"", lead-off track on the Reading band's inaugural LP Little Death could, with its babbling bass, rattling guitar, and infectious-as-ringworm melody be Dunedin, 1981, all over again. Any Kiwi bloodlines, however, are diverted through the now-hegemonic channels of 1990s American indie rock. So as much as the album sounds like a lost tape from the Boodle Boodle Boodle sessions, that's probably only because it rings with scrappy, melodic Pavementisms, amber-toned Yo La Tengo chords, and the genial chug of Superchunk's brake-free singles. ""Come on Feet"", one of the year's most potent earworms dangles a couple shallow hooks before plowing into a tent revival of maniacal handclapping and late-night, lager-sotted ooh-oohs. Singer/guitarist Tom Sanders previously recorded ""Feet"" (as well as ""She Doesn't Belong to Me"", née ""She Doesn't Belong"") for his Tap Tap solo project, but the full-band version of the song, which now also includes vocals from second guitarist Pete Hefferan (one of two Petes in the Pirates) exercises the song's full anthemic potential. ""Knots"" is a two-and-change blast of chipped guitar and oscillating rhythm. Even tracks that start woozy like ""Eyes Like Tar"" are pebbles on an incline; once kicked they can't seem to defy the laws of physics. Producer Gareth Parton (the Go! Team, Foals) wisely handles Little Death with a light touch, engineering some fantastic vocal interplay (like less dramaturgical versions of the Futureheads), and otherwise leaving things the hell alone. The Pirates aren't up to anything fancy lyrically, either. They ply several clever turns of phrase, even passages of rueful wit (""You and me trying hard to remember/ How we ever started out with our sights so high""), but most songs couch romantic travail and workaday worry in familiar pop music terms. There are endless references to bed-- knocking boots, passing out, and just plain sleeping. But unlike that of their laddish contemporaries, the Pirates' version of debauchery is mostly milquetoast, the Saturday night escapades of guys who don collared shirts and brave the M4 each weekday to get to their entry-level insurance jobs. In other words, a welcome respite for anyone weary of the tabloid exploits of that other Pete, Doherty (which is everyone, right?). Even if you'd be loathe to admit it to your friends, ""Dry Wings"", with lines like, ""Time for bed/ Find a girl and go to bed/ Close your eyes/ Stars are falling from the sky,"" is mighty affecting-- a winking galaxy of jangled wist, sweet, staggered harmonies and a gawky, yearning sense of wonder. And beneath the crusty shell of apathy and cynicism and the buzz and fuzz and hiss isn't that, fundamentally, what the best indie rock is always trying to communicate?","Reading band's name is reminiscent of the British Invasion, but its music recalls the Clean and other Flying Nun stalwarts funneled through 1990s U.S. indie rock.

One Hell of a Ride,Willie Nelson,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b588c0084474cd0c2435/1:1/w_160/ccc764a3.gif,2008-04-04 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11366-one-hell-of-a-ride/,ColumbiaLegacy,"Next to Johnny Cash, Willie Nelson is arguably the most anthologized artist in country music history. Even before 1975, when The Red Headed Stranger made icons of his braids and beard, Nelson had already toiled as a songwriter and performer for more than 20 years, long enough to release his first greatest hits compilation just a few years before his greatest hit. In the 30-plus years since that benchmark album, Nelson has interspersed his prolific new recordings (often two full albums a year) with a steady stream of hits repackagings. Most of his recent albums have consisted of new recordings of old material, which reinforces the impression of an artist constantly taking stock of his career, his life, and his legacy. It seems strange that with so many compilations on the market, so few of them even attempt to take in the full half-century breadth of Nelson's career. Granted, capturing such a wide-ranging, musically omnivorous artist in a limited space is always a daunting task, especially when affordability is a concern. In 1995, Willie released the 3xCD Revolutions of Time: The Journey 1975-1993, whose subtitle is revealing: Far from comprehensive, the set ignores his pre-Stranger output, including early hits like ""Shotgun Willie"", ""Crazy"", and ""Bloody Mary Morning"", in order to document his post-fame highlights. Two more recent retrospectives, the 41-track Essential Willie Nelson in 2003 and the 20-track Songs in 2005, take a wider view of Nelson's canon, but are necessarily hampered by their cursory tracklists. In Nelson's case, quantity ensures quality, which means that One Hell of a Ride is so far the best Willie retrospective by simple virtue of its size. Across 100 tracks on four CDs, the handsomely packaged set, which commemorates Nelson's 75th birthday, traces his career from his first known recording in 1954 to one of his most recent tracks in 2007. That they're both the same composition-- ""When I've Sang My Last Hillbilly Song""-- provides a nice symmetry, bookending all the hillbilly songs that came in between. One Hell of a Ride culls a full disc from Nelson's work in the 1950s, 60s, and early 70s, representing early albums like ...And Then I Wrote and Texas in My Soul, which are sadly out of print, as well as slightly more popular releases like Shotgun Willie and Phases & Stages (reissued in 2006 as The Complete Atlantic Sessions). After Willie released Stranger, the various labels he had recorded for began cleaning out the vaults, repackaging his older hits and selling them to new fans, and this set draws liberally from some of these reissues: three tracks from Willie-- Before His Time, a 1977 release of tracks from the previous decade (remixed by Waylon Jennings); one each from 1980's Minstrel Man and 1984's Don't You Ever Get Tired; and two from his All Time Greatest Hits Vol. 1. By comparison, Stranger itself gets only one track, Stardust two. This is significant. Nelson lives and dies by the song, whether he wrote it himself or is just covering it. With compositions like ""Crazy"", ""Sad Songs and Waltzes"", ""Bloody Mary Morning"", ""Too Sick to Pray"", and many others, One Hell of a Ride showcases Nelson's unparalleled songwriting skills, but with covers of compositions by Jimmy Cliff, Hoagy Carmichael, Bob Wills, Paul Simon, Fred Neil, and the Muppets, the set highlights his intuitive interpretive skills. Despite the decades in between, the leathery texture of his voice is immediately recognizable on the first disc as it is on the final disc, as idiosyncratic as Cash's grave baritone or Elvis Presley's full-bodied croon, and his behind-the-beat cadence, which draws from jazz and gospel as heavily as from country, makes every performance singular. In tandem with taking stock of his well-known hits like ""Whiskey River"", ""Night Life"", and ""Blue Eyes Crying in the Rain"", One Hell of a Ride pays particular attention to Nelson's many collaborations, the number of which suggests he might have been contractually obligated to sing with anyone who stepped within the Nashville city limits. The second disc kicks off with the first of five duets with Waylon Jennings, ""Good Hearted Woman"", from Wanted! The Outlaws, which not only helped popularize outlaw country but was for many years the best-selling country album ever. But the collaborators on One Hell of a Ride are admirably diverse: old timers like the Highwaymen (Cash, Jennings, and Kris Kristofferson) and Rays Price and Charles rub elbows with Lee Ann Womack, Leon Russell, Daniel Lanois, and even Julio Iglesias, on the gloriously cheesy ""To All the Girls I've Loved Before"". This emphasis on his friends means the third and fourth discs nearly lose Willie in the crowd, but it barely matters. One Hell of a Ride is perhaps the first Willie retrospective to portray him not simply as the famous long-haired singer-songwriter who penned hits and dodged the IRS, but as something more complex: an American artist who spent decades struggling in the country music industry, then spent decades redefining it.","Taking in the full half-century breadth of the country legend's career, this 4xCD, 100-track set reminds us why you just don't say no to the red-headed stranger.

The Glow Pt. 2,The Microphones,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b57713d197565213ac85/1:1/w_160/c5939a8b.jpg,2008-04-04 06:00:01,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11352-the-glow-pt-2/,KK,"In the latter half of the 1990s, as the grunge and riot-grrrl movements of the Pacific Northwest petered out, a young record store clerk in Anacortes quietly dreamed up a world that was entirely his own. Working in private, with analog tape, Phil Elvrum remade the twee-pop of Olympia, Washington's K Records into something broader in scope, proving that intimacy and opulence were not mutually exclusive by forging sweet tunes, childlike vocals, solar noise, and enigmatic tape collages into one molten mass. His speciality was reconciling extreme orders of magnitude, casting mountains and planets and stars as items hanging from a baby's mobile. The Glow Pt. 2, which remains his crowning achievement, is being reissued by K just as Elvrum says ""it threatened to go out of print."" Seven years of imitation have done nothing to dull its impact-- it sounds as unaccountably grand now as it did in 2001. The Glow Pt. 2 wasn't conceptualized, then recorded; Elvrum figured out where it was going even as he committed it to tape. He strived to document the esoteric flights of his imagination, and produced appropriately intuitive music: Vocal harmonies blur, disappear, return as ragged organs. Creaky percussion sounds like it might give way at any moment, and sometimes does. Staticky thumps that could level forests give way to calm acoustic expanses. The bum notes peppering the acoustic riff of ""Headless Horseman"" are reminders that Elvrum was lunging impulsively from one idea to the next. In this, it's a perfect mirror of Xiu Xiu: While Jamie Stewart's music fumbles in pitch darkness, Elvrum's gropes through blinding light. That easy but deliberate rhythm, along with Elvrum's mossy production, makes The Glow Pt. 2 feel uncommonly organic. Many of his songs move with the naturalistic but formalized cadence of an iambic meter. ""I Want Wind to Blow"" is cut by a heartbeat, plunked out on an acoustic guitar's low E string. The hardier pulse of ""The Gleam Pt. 2"" turns pitch-shifted guitars into a stately march. These could have been average indie pop tunes were they not shaped by Elvrum's unique sense of non-linear arrangement and space: He often gives us a few moments to acclimate ourselves to the Dub Narcotic studio's seething room tone before, with a sudden flourish, flooding it with energy, as he does on ""Map"" and ""My Roots are Strong and Deep"". Therefore, everything he records sounds huge and hollowed out, a little bigger on the inside than on the outside. Death Cab for Cutie would have written the frilly arpeggios of ""You'll Be in the Air"" and stopped there, but Microphones fans wait on tenterhooks for the moment when it inevitably shudders and begins to pile up on itself. Bonus discs are typically the province of demos and remixes. Because of The Glow Pt. 2's piecemeal construction, Elvrum has none of the former-- everything was taped over or went on the album. As something of an artistic hermit, he's constitutionally inclined against the latter. But, wanting to give fans something in addition to the existing songs, Elvrum spent some time in 2007 recording bonus material for the reissue. These additions range from the obvious (like the acoustic version of ""I Felt My Size"") to the arcane (like a vaguely dub-influenced version of ""I Want Wind to Blow""). There are also essential sketches of new material such as ""I'm Like You, Tree"", which expand the album's already-deep relationship to nature. Of course, none of the new lyrics clarify the overarching story; they're further snapshots of Elvrum feeling small and serene in a big, scary universe. But these snippets are thrilling for Microphones fans-- they reveal a few more glimpses of a distant, haunting world that's all the more alluring for its incompleteness.","K Records reissues Phil Elvrum's quiet masterpiece, a record of intuitive music and esoteric flights of the imagination. The set also features bonus material recorded in 2007 specifically to accompany this release.

In an age where a respected Def Jam lieutenant (that'd be Freeway) can barely lift a glossy, sturdy soul-rap album past 100,000 units, Trill's Standard Oil/Cash Money/Apple vertical integration has let Lil' Boosie, Webbie, and the label's comparatively forgettable posse albums routinely flirt with gold plaques. They keep their shows rowdy, packed, and staged in B-list cities and backwater towns no one at Clear Channel could find with a GPS. They keep their producers in-house and overworked. They could give a collective fuck when it comes to courting HOT 97 and MTV. Sound familiar? Call it Cash Money-lite. Producers Mouse and BJ understudy Mannie Fresh with Delta bass-bounce and zydeco flourishes. Lil' Boosie, though he's been rapping for as long as anyone in Cash Money, still scans like a mid-shelf Lil Wayne: a temperamental, ecstatic, vowel-chain loving whelp. Executive producers Turk & Mel are as invisible as Baby's silent partner and brother, Cash Money co-owner Slim Williams. Webbie's role is a bit harder to cast. Since his first appearances for Trill he's been paired with Boosie. Their duo album, 2005's Gangsta Muzik, collaborations across Webbie's debut Savage Life and Boosie's Bad Azz, and their obvious leadership roles on Trill's label album Survival of The Fittest pegged him as the Juvenile to Boosie's Wayne. Webbie plods where Boosie yelps; he extends his drawl where Boosie snips his lines into chain-link patterns; he wrestles with adulthood while Boosie plays Peter Pan. Fitting for an album that documents a perhaps unwilling crawl to maturity, Savage Life 2 succeeds when it sticks to the specific, discrete, and (relatively) adult. Webbie certainly sounds like he's done some growing up since his debut. It shows on ""Independent"", the album's lead single and one of the year's most refreshing jams. Webbie dishes out acclaim for his vision of full-fledged women-- ""She ain't waitin' for no man to take care of her/ She'd rather go to work and pay the bills on schedule""-- on a barking, two-tone bubble beat. He provides the steady drawl, newcomer Lil' Phat bricks a few lines (""She cook/ She clean/ She smell like onion ring""-- whatever works, brah) and Boosie steals away the final verse in a whorl of giddy shrieks. Nothing revelatory, nothing too illuminating, just lovely, reasonable olive branches served for a post-Imus rap world. Webbie finally has a wheelhouse. Like Trick Daddy he tells you not only what he has, but why, honestly, he values it. ""Your shit is the cheapest, you might blow out your speakers/ Sound we blowin' and all, got warrants and all, done look down at the phone, I done missed a few calls/ Me and Boosie was thuggin', he was telling me something but I couldn't much hear."" Sound systems are just that, but at least he's at least made his material concerns immersive and earnest. Webbie, like it or not, evolves. Better still, Webbie has earned a sense of monologue. ""Just Like Me"" is a caustic, direct speech by a father to his son, peppered with asides (""Hell yeah I'm a good dad/ But I don't know if that's good or bad"") and doubt: ""You gonna end up dead/ You gonna be just like me/ They gonna bust your head/ You gonna be just like me."" And paternal concern: ""All I can say is be safe."" But there's no hiding how much of a drop off the second-half of Savage Life 2 from the first. Webbie regresses and slides into the sloppy themes of self, self, and fantastic self. He's ""Too big to forget/ Too slippery to hold."" He's makin' money, you aren't. He's gonna hit it on the first night; you, of course, are not. Adulthood has its moments of regression; Webbie stumbles on more than a few on Savage Life 2, but at least there's a sense of forward momentum. When the whole rap world seems to be playing Chicken Little, at least there's a corner of this art that's climbing the ladder to maturity, undisturbed by the commercial world knocking on its door.","Fitting for an album that documents a perhaps unwilling crawl to maturity, the Baton Rouge rapper's second solo record succeeds when it sticks to the specific, discrete, and (relatively) adult.

The Garden of Forking Paths,Various Artists,by: Matthew Murphy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b554ea9e61561daa6dc5/1:1/w_160/cabc30b1.jpg,2008-04-03 06:00:04,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11321-the-garden-of-forking-paths/,Important,"Within the span of a few short years, James Blackshaw has established himself as the gold standard among the crowded field of contemporary acoustic guitarists. On 2007's brilliant The Cloud of Unknowing and throughout the course of his ever-expanding discography, he has drawn on an unusually broad array of influences, even by the voracious standards of his American primitive peers. So it comes as little surprise to find that on The Garden of Forking Paths, a new collection curated by Blackshaw for Important Records, he has sought to draw connections across some unlikely musical borderlands. For the compilation, Blackshaw has gathered solo works for various acoustic string instruments, including performances by cellist Helena Espvall, Japanese koto expert Chieko Mori, and Renaissance lute player Jozef van Wissem. These musicians each bring a highly individualized approach to their instruments, yet each displays a similar balance of reverence and disregard for traditional form and technique. Despite the musicians' diverse musical and cultural backgrounds, however, the collection is able to accent the many subtle echoes between each of these pieces, resulting in an engaging set that provides a refreshing alternative to the recent deluge of folk-based guitar records. The Garden of Forking Paths takes its title from the celebrated short story by Jorge Luis Borges, which is a dazzling meditation on time and the possibility of infinite simultaneous realities. It's a title that seems to suit this collection especially well, as the music here sounds unified enough to suggest that the performers have all been traveling parallel routes to reach the same destination. (And they each certainly appear capable of Borgesian bursts of virtuosity.) The album was recorded at various locations around the globe in 2006 and 2007 with a minimum of overdubs. Yet these are not wild flights of improvisation but are instead measured, deliberate compositions that progress to their natural conclusions with a quiet sense of purpose. It is left unclear whether the musicians had the opportunity to work together or hear one another's contributions prior to recording their own, but nevertheless the album's casual symmetry is impressive. Jozef van Wissem's lengthy ""The Mirror of Eternal Light"", in particular, seems to breeze across musical boundaries with an effortless fluency. As the piece opens, van Wissem patiently repeats a hypnotic, minimalist figure that sounds remarkably koto-like, before moving into a rippling torrent of notes that could have easily come from Blackshaw's own 12-string. Blackshaw himself submits ""The Broken Hourglass"" which, like all of his best work, sounds immediately accessible and yet somehow strangely alien, as his intricate playing grows further removed from standard blues and raga formula. It is Swedish-born cellist Espvall, best known for her work with acid-folk group Espers, who delivers the collection's most surprising and dissonant work. Her solo piece ""Home of Shadows and Whirlwinds"" is filled with darting overtones and ominous, scraping drones to provide a dark reflection to Blackshaw's more sun-sparkled illuminations. The album is framed by Chieko Mori's two koto pieces that draw as much on Western tradition as Eastern, especially on the resonant ""Spiral Wave"", whose layered harmonies and rhythms achieve their own singular, almost rock-like propulsion. In the time since this collection's completion, Blackshaw and van Wissem have resumed their collaboration under the name Brethren of the Free Spirit. And judging from the brilliant The Garden of Forking Paths, we can only hope this is just the opening statement in what will prove to be a fertile, ongoing joint dialogue.","Guitar maestro James Blackshaw curates this collection of solo works for various string instruments, including contributions from cellist Helena Espvall of Espers and Japanese koto expert Chieko Mori.

Cold & Kind,The 1900s,by: Jessica Suarez,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b5695e6ef9596932277b/1:1/w_160/c80920ba.jpg,2008-04-03 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11340-cold-kind/,Parasol,"If metal guys are kittens offstage because they've gotten all their aggression out onstage, then I wonder what the passive, refined, 1900s are like at home. Perhaps the law of inverse aggression governs the Chicago band's claims to Fleetwood Mac-style breakups, and to engage in serious ball-breaking everywhere else. A Forkcast track review compared them to an Elephant Six band, but they lack most E6 bands' abstraction and eccentricity. Closer, vocally and ideologically, maybe, are Belle and Sebastien and Sufjan Stevens (violinist Andra Kulans has played backup for Stevens), artists known more for great arrangements and delicate lyricism than a visceral pull. This is elegant pop, 1960s radio pop, yes, but 1900s should also cop to some less cool influences: Carole King (""When I Say Go""), or ""Danny's Song""-era Kenny Loggins (""City Water"") lurk on Cold & Kind alongside the Mamas and Papas-style harmonies. But the overriding theme here, despite their debt to pop tearjerkers, is an emotional distance that invades each track. The album title hints at a familiar personality type that, I'm guessing, describes either someone you know or something you recognize in yourself. It's the romantic partner that handles every step of a relationship, from first crush to fight to breakup to infidelity, with a frustrating calm. ""I can't tell you I love you until I see you crying,"" sings 1900s vocalist/guitarist Edward Anderson. And later: ""Everyone goes crazy except for me."" The arrangements warm up words like these, whether it's the clean and muted violin on""Georgia"" or the strings on ""Cold & Kind"" or ""Two Ways""' lead guitar sent through a tube amp. Every song is arrangled perfectly. But sometimes what I long for, and don't get here, are longer instrumental passages, the breaths that reflect the emotional space and quiet for which the album's protagonist longs. Perfection, like a distant boyfriend's impassivity, is a perverse, grotesque quality masquerading as something admirable. You might find yourself wanting to kick this sandcastle in by the 10th song, except the last two are totally worth saving.","Like Belle and Sebastian or Sufjan Stevens, this Chicago band is known more for great arrangements and delicate lyricism than a visceral pull.

Electronic Projects for Musicians,The Apples in Stereo,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b58213d197565213ac96/1:1/w_160/17d1fd84.jpg,2008-04-03 06:00:02,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11361-electronic-projects-for-musicians/,Elephant SixYep RocSimian,"I've always liked Apples in Stereo as an idea and as a band, an affection that stems from their status as one of the flagship bands of the 90s' Elephant Six collective and doesn't wane even when they release something of which I'm not entirely fond. In a decade full of sad sacks showcasing their pain, the Apples were a little ray through the gray, a band that actually sounded happy to be playing music. What a concept. One inclusion I was particularly pleased to hear is ""The Apples Theme Song"", which played on the band's splash page a few years ago. The lyrics ""We are the Apples in Stereo/ You hear our music on the radio,"" are a bit of a fantasy (you're actually more likely to hear them on the Cartoon Network, soundtracking ""The Powerpuff Girls""), but Robert Schneider, the band's everyman leader with the helium-injected voice, doesn't seem to mind. In his mind, he might as well be on the radio, and as long as you're listening to the Apples in Stereo, they may as well be your favorite band. Despite the range of years covered here, the fidelity is pretty uniform, and the band's essentially optimistic, sunny disposition holds true across ballads and pop songs alike. Little hints of Schneider's experimentalism crop up here and there as well. UK B-side ""So Far Away"" has electronic beats and a coating of processed guitar, while ""Shine (In Your Mind)"" spikes its slide-guitar-laden pop with strange electric keyboard phrases that add just a touch of clang to the song. And it's not all sunshine, either: ""The Oasis"" sounds like a descendant of ""Across the Universe"", but the lyrics are unusually dark: ""You're such a star/ But don't let it feed your head/ Because the music scene is dead/ Now where you are."" There are a number of somewhat bland mid-tempo tracks and a few sketchy incidental things, like the ultra-brief vocal exercise ""Thank You Very Much"", but this is a worthy addition for Apples fans who haven't already tracked down every flexi-disc, Japanese import, and vinyl edition in the band's large catalog. One of the best tracks is saved for last. Tone Soul Evolution outtake ""Dreams"" is a truly pretty song with some nice lead guitar and a bed of mellotron that would have nicely closed the album it was cut from. This is a great companion to the 1996 loose-ends compilation Science Faire, but if you're not into the band, it's no place to start. The band's debut, Fun Trick Noisemaker, 1999's Her Wallpaper Reverie, and last year's comeback New Magnetic Wonder are all better introductions to a band that these days is often curiously overlooked. Schneider's band never became as notorious as its E6 cohorts Olivia Tremor Control and Neutral Milk Hotel, but he had a huge hand in the sound of both groups (producing In the Aeroplane Over the Sea), and today must be considered one of indie rock's unsung heroes.","Offering material from as far back as 1995, this rarities collection scoops up a decade's worth of compilation tracks, Japan-only bonus songs, and other ephemera, including the band's 2006 ode to Stephen Colbert.

Last Night,Moby,by: Joshua Klein,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a1a113d1975652138692/1:1/w_160/a1d7eefd.jpg,2008-04-03 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11362-last-night/,Mute,"Moby's controversial strategy of licensing the hell out of 1999's Play proved, not surprisingly, something of a devil's bargain. After years of hard work on the club scene and as a cult crossover star, Play was the big payoff and big payday all wrapped up in one. But the downside was that Moby's sudden ubiquity, and the seeming effortlessness with which Play proliferated, downgraded the Moby brand. The guy actually accomplished quite a bit creatively before he became a commercial force, but making it look easy made a lot of detractors think it actually was. Still, at the same time, there may be something to that in light of Moby's post-Play output. Given that Moby has total autonomy, both creatively and financially, it's disappointing that the past several years have seen him do little in the studio to take advantage of freedoms many artists would kill for-- all while dozens of boundary-pushing DJs and producers circulate in and out of fashion. Maybe Moby sensed it himself, and, rejecting complacency, set himself some ambitious goals with Last Night, a concept album that serves as a nostalgic trip down clubland lane. This being Moby, it even comes with an explicit statement of purpose. ""It's me trying to take 25 years of going out in NYC and condensing it into a 65-minute record. It's also trying to condense an eight-hour night into just over an hour of music."" Distilling 25 years of material and an eight-hour experience into a 60-minute record is no small feat, and to Moby's credit Last Night isn't a totally pedantic drag. Moby's never been shy about tipping his hand when it comes to his influences, and returning to dance music for inspiration makes perfect sense at this point in his career-- especially after the relatively uninspired Hotel and Baby Monkey (recorded as Voodoo Child, his last stab at a ""straight"" dance record). But there's ""inspired"" and then there's inspired. Compared to (for example) Hercules & Love Affair's own recent stroll through New York's varied club history, the relatively indifferent grooves on Last Night don't quite cut it. These may be songs designed to make you move but the results are only intermittently rousing. ""Ooh Yeah"" and ""I Love to Move in Here"" (featuring the Cold Crush Brothers' Grandmaster Caz) start the album out with cool (as in cold) disco diva vocals and hip-house, respectively. Retro cred established, the disc then moves into peppier territory with ""257.zero"". The track doesn't really go anywhere, but it still feels like it could go on longer than three and a half minutes. ""Everyday It's 1989"", on the other hand, so perfectly encapsulates the spirit of rave that it might as well be drawn from a comp circa that titular year. If Moby wanted to distill that hour further down to just a single track, it would be this one. The track's also a reminder of Moby's prowess as a producer, but unfortunately too much of Last Night stresses his recent bona fides as master of the middle of the road. The hip-hop spiced single ""Alice"" (featuring members of Nigeria's 419 Squad) rides a moody subterranean bass but ends pretty much where it begins. ""Hyenas"" is all swoon and no drama. ""Disco Lies"" and ""Stars"" (anthems, both) are more perfect late-80s/early-90s club recreations that nonetheless miss an opportunity to mix (or at least bridge) the past with the present. Somewhere in the middle are tracks like ""Live for Tomorrow"" and ""I'm in Love"", sexy, moody things that are equal parts bedroom lures and hints at the beckoning chill-out room. That chill-out atmosphere kicks in for the album's final stretch, gloomy tracks such as the woozy trip-hop of ""Degenerates"" or the circular, minor key dirge ""Mothers of the Night"" that act as the big comedown after the implied narrative's night on the town. By dedicating such a big hunk of the album to the early morning, however, the lasting vibe conveyed by the record is not euphoric or even nostalgic, but oddly elegiac. In the end, lost amidst the faithfully reproduced house piano progressions and familiar melodies is anything signaling that those epiphany-filled late nights were actually, you know, fun. If Moby's glory days were anything like this, Last Night never quite makes an entirely convincing argument why anyone would ever want to go back.","A concept album that serves as a nostalgic trip down clubland lane, Moby's latest attempts to distill a quarter-century of NYC dance music into one hour.

Flock,Bell X1,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b4fe5e6ef959693226cd/1:1/w_160/e07c71b8.jpg,2008-04-02 06:00:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11248-flock/,InterscopeInterscope,"Perhaps inevitably, an ability to easily find free music combined with user-friendly web technology has resulted in an increased ability to praise every fucking mp3 under the sun. Keeping up with every song and artist praised somewhere by someone feels less like a labor of love and more like a crushing obligation. So imagine seeing Bell X1 getting the web in a titter with their stateside debut (and third album overall) on the strength of the following nugget of trivia: Damien Rice used to be in this band. Whatever caused Rice to jump, it probably wasn't the band's (formerly known as Juniper) lack of commercial prospects. These guys aren't performing Rice's decaf froth, but plenty of other satellite radio stations could play Flock, which aims to be a sort of good ol' gloopy, romantic, somewhat psychedelic record á la the Verve's Urban Hymns or Coldplay's X&Y. Unfortunately, like so many other middling bands from this decade, they see themselves as not just ubermenschen of empathy, but also disco infiltrators. ""Reacharound"" manages to bring to mind John Wooden and R. Lee Ermey; the former because ""don't confuse activity with achievement"" applies to the aimless guitars, the latter for obvious reasons when lead singer/studio drummer Paul Noonan belts ""always good for a reacharound!"" in a horribly indecisive almost-falsetto. As for would-be banger ""Flame"", it aims to capture that record-review chestnut ""angular"" but that would imply this shit is supposed to have angles, something to prod bodies into movement or draw blood. Instead, ""Flame"" is like getting pelted with a mouse pad before closing with an embarrassingly unearned round of applause. At least those tracks are somewhat energetic; otherwise, Bell X1 uses a breakout as an excuse for ""Bad Skin Day"", six minutes of bedsitting (literally) self-pity over glassy cymbal washes and acoustic glaze. Closer ""Lamposts"" is like this as well, only two mintues longer. What ultimately undermines the group's attempts at resonance are vocalist Paul Noonan's stabs at bon mots-- see: ""Maybe it's a seasonal affective disorder"" or ""Maybe we're just sad or makin' V's like Nixon."" Since I had a college roommate who loved the Barenaked Ladies, I'm at least prepared. Check the bulletproof fly shit from single ""Rocky Took a Lover"" (aka ""Travis Made a B-Side""): ""[He said] You're such an asshole when you're drunk/ He said 'At least I'm OK in the mornings'/ She said 'I don't believe in any old Jesus/ If there was a God, then why is my arse the perfect height of kicking?'"" Astoundingly, that's not the track on Flock that's titled ""He Said She Said"". At the very least, Flock allows me to clarify why I found A Weekend in the City to be woefully underrated-- the Bloc Party record managed to prove that ""strident"" and ""sappy"" weren't mutually exclusive, that you could pound your broken heart with a clenched fist. And they did it under the weight of overwhelming expectations. Bell X1 generically compartmentalize everything instead and end up with a record that doesn't even top the work of their former bandmate.","This is the stateside debut-- and third release overall-- from a band that, OMG, used to feature Damien Rice.

Blood Moon,Apes & Androids,by: Adam Moerder,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b544ea9e61561daa6daf/1:1/w_160/984cdd7b.jpg,2008-04-02 06:00:04,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11309-blood-moon/,self-released,"Ah, the young, introverted male's bedroom. Home to countless hours of video games, classic rock albums, and sexual discovery-- it's no wonder ""Paperboy"", Jenna Jameson, and Ziggy Stardust blend together so seamlessly in the collective brain of many twenty-something males. New York five-piece Apes & Androids have got a particularly bad case of this phenomenon. So bad that on their debut album, Blood Moon, it's difficult to determine where the digital sci-fi fantasy ends and the IRL hot-blooded yearning begins. Never before has a stronger case been presented for a Nintendo Power swimsuit issue. Riding a Mountain Dew high, Blood Moon never meets a dramatic pose it doesn't like. All your late-night movie marathon heroes are here in some incarnation, from Robocop to Rocky Horror, and the band's not afraid to reach into the gooey middles of gauche genres like glam rock or John Hughes soundtracks. Opener ""Blood Moon I"" acts as a movie trailer for the album, suspensefully playing monkey, spaceship, and horror scream sound effects before launching into the alpha dog strut of ""Make Forever Last Forever"". Not that it's a surprise, but Moon's biggest slap-you-in-the-face moments come during the band's robo-Queen numbers. Although their itchy-finger synth arrangements wouldn't fly in any opera house, the neurotic arias on songs like ""Hot Kathy"" and ""Doyle is Dead"" feel like an accurate Information Age update of Freddy Mercury vocals. When their libidos spill over, those hyper vocals take on the glitchy plastic soul of Midnite Vultures or Hissing Fauna. ""Golden Prize"" pulls out all the stops, its melody hijacked by countless falsetto interruptions along with a cartoonish Arabian outro. There are even a few tender moments on the album, though they naturally come off more as tongue-in-cheek send-offs of 1980s sentimentality. ""Nights of the Week"" tackles the plight of the over-zealous party-goer, replete with a guitar riff modeled after ""Every Breath You Take"" and a touching reflection on college-aged burnout: ""These are the nights of the week when you pull yourself out of bed."" The final third of Moon wades a little long in the soft stuff and loses the rest of the album's punch, but it could be so much worse. A&A have earned a reputation for garish stage outfits and dance party concerts, and we've seen bands like this too often overlook their music, practically beating the listener into partying with cheap gimmicks and shock jokes. Fortunately, these guys know they're cuter than they are shocking. Like equally goofy acts Junior Senior and Datarock, A&A find a happy medium between irreverence and ingenuity, doing their guilty pleasure touchstones a better service than today's deeper-browed bands ever could.","New York five-piece known for wacky live shows debuts with an album that, while glancing at Queen and the glitchy plastic soul of Midnite Vultures, ultimately finds a happy medium between irreverence and ingenuity.

Cover Up,Ministry,by: Cosmo Lee,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b55ec0084474cd0c23ea/1:1/w_160/678d64f9.jpg,2008-04-02 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11329-cover-up/,13th Planet,"""Always judge a band by its covers,"" says Ministry frontman Al Jourgensen. Indeed, covers have forensic value, revealing what a band has ingested. They also have sartorial significance; whose mantles do bands wear, and how do they fit? On Cover Up, Ministry rev up bluesy chestnuts, mostly from the 1970s. 2007's The Last Sucker was the band's final album of original material, but this odd coda may be more of a statement. Ministry have gone through so many phases-- synth-pop, industrial dance, industrial metal, digital grunge, political thrash-- that their only connecting thread is Jourgensen. Even early on, he defied genre expectations. While his industrial peers wore fishnets, Jourgensen donned a cowboy hat and threatened to record a country album under the name Buck Satan. Amid Ministry's thunder lay flashes of humor: the scat-singing thrash of ""Jesus Built My Hot Rod""; a strangely affecting cover, included here, of Bob Dylan's ""Lay Lady Lay""; and scabrously edited soundbites of George W. Bush, Jourgensen's anti-muse on Ministry's final three records. On Cover Up, Ministry send up heroes, not villains. The results are quite fun. Whether political or personal (Jourgensen's 20-year heroin addiction begrimed his late-90s/early-00s output), clouds have always hovered over Ministry; hearing them lift is refreshing. This is the afterparty for Ministry's career, and Jourgensen has brought out his oldest bottles. The Rolling Stones' ""Under My Thumb"" gets a tinkly intro that recalls Ministry's synth pop days. In 1990, Jourgensen covered Black Sabbath's ""Supernaut"" under the name 1000 Homo DJs; his howl was younger and more caustic then, and its inclusion here contrasts his lower, almost death metal-like growl on a bullheaded version of ZZ Top's ""Just Got Paid"". In its range, Cover Up subtly assays Ministry's decades-long run; a hidden track roasts their own hit ""Stigmata"" as an easy-listening a cappella. In the last half of their career, Ministry loosened up, fuzzing up their guitars and slyly slipping in blues licks. After his seminal Wax Trax! days in Chicago, Jourgensen relocated to a Texas ranch which had formerly been a brothel. He refers to his current recording studio as a ""compound""; Cover Up only reinforces his outlaw image. Instead of preaching the apocalypse, he now runs a circus inside it. Jourgensen sets the Doors' ""Roadhouse Blues"" to machine-gun thrash, yet warms it up with Hammond organ. On traditional work song ""Black Betty"", he revisits Ram Jam's classic, disco-tinged arrangement, but with huge, metallic riffs. Guitarist (and Prong frontman) Tommy Victor sings on two raucous cowbell workouts, Mountain's ""Mississippi Queen"" and Deep Purple's ""Space Truckin'"". Hearing the voice of Prong belting out Deep Purple over Ministry's hyperactive drum machine is simply sublime. Cover Up completes Ministry's transformation from industrial icons to beer-chugging humans. On Louie Armstrong's ""What a Wonderful World,"" Jourgensen emits a lovably Tom Waits-esque croak over teary-eyed barroom piano. Then the song inexplicably becomes a British punk raveup, albeit with battering ram percussion and walls of digital distortion. It's elegiacal yet triumphant, crazy yet logical, ironic yet sincere. One can practically see Jourgensen's musical life flashing before his eyes.","Although 2007's The Last Sucker was Ministry's final album of original material, this odd coda-- a covers record that finds the group tackling Bob Dylan, the Rolling Stones, ZZ Top, Mountain, and Deep Purple, among others-- may be more of a statement.

59.59,Sian Alice Group,by: Stuart Berman,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b54fb1335d7bf169a8a8/1:1/w_160/2d1864d6.gif,2008-04-02 06:00:02,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11316-5959/,Social Registry,"Naming your group after yourself usually means one of three things: a) You're a jazz musician, b) You're the guitarist in a rock band who wants to be a jazz musician, or c) You're a rampant egoist. But Sian Alice Ahern, leader of the London, UK-based Sian Alice Group, is none of these things-- as a frontwoman, she's as likely to recede as take the lead. With her band's debut charting transformations from psychedelic rock, pastoral folk, and piano-lounge balladry into analog-synthtronica, free-jazz breakdowns, pounding Afro-tech grooves, and avant-classical composition, Ahern is the sort of vocalist who patiently waits for the songs to settle into shape before stepping up to the mic. In their open-ended, exploratory approach to songwriting, Sian Alice Group-- co-founded with Rupert Clervaux and Ben Crook-- are logical additions to the Social Registry stable. But they'd be even more at home on the early 1990s Too Pure roster, which seemed to produce an inordinate amount of female-fronted bands (Stereolab, Laika, Th' Faith Healers, Pram) who severed psych from its 60s-rock roots and applied its principles to non-rock musical forms, emphasizing the music's hypnotic, repetitive qualities-- and, more often than not, sublimating their singers into a textural detail. Ahern spends 59.59 vacillating between presence and absence. But her turns in the spotlight contribute a considerable amount of heat to an album mostly set on simmer, no more so than on the sinister swamp blues of second song ""Way Down to Heaven"": ""I'm on my way to heaven now,"" Ahern declares, but the dirty PJ Harvey riff sounds like it's pulling her down in the other direction before setting the song alight in a blaze of distortion and ear-piercing organ tones. ""Contours"" is another early standout, with Ahern's choral vocal leading the hazy, synth-swathed hymnal before the drums come crashing in and start hunting for Caribou.
*
59.59* could use a few more fiery moments like these; as the album settles into its more temperate second half-- marked by sullen, straight-forward piano lullabies like ""Murder"" and ""Heartless""-- the titular album length seems less a product of fortuitous circumstance than a premeditated goal, with the tracklist deliberately padded to arrive at the numerically neat running time. But the beauty of Sian Alice Group is that formalism is ultimately a temporary condition, and that the band is capable of creating highly effective music even when they stray far from traditional torch-song territory: ""Days of Grace III"" is built on a striking, repeated piano motif that accrues an almost ""Tubular Bells""-like tension, while the closing, free-floating instrumental ""Complete Affection"" (featuring Spiritualized/Spring Heel Jack member John Coxon on guitar and Gang Gang Dance's Brian DeGraw on piano) is messy, pained and cathartic-- like all good crying fits should be.","On their debut album, this London band charts transformations from psych-rock and pastoral folk to free-jazz breakdowns, pounding Afro-tech grooves, and avant-classical composition.

Ghosts I-IV,Nine Inch Nails,by: Tom Breihan,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b52c9d034d5c69bf4f9d/1:1/w_160/1514afd0.jpg,2008-04-02 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11289-ghosts-i-iv/,The Null Corporation,"When Trent Reznor got his Just Blaze on last year to produce the Saul Williams slam-opera The Inevitable Rise and Liberation of NiggyTardust!, he sent it out into the world through a just-blazed distribution path, biting Radiohead's weeks-old pay-what-you want idea. Then, when not enough people paid actual money for the thing, he bitchily blogged about it. Now he's doing it again, this time under his own name. If you want the new NIN all-instrumental 36-track drone-marathon, you can pay as little as $5 or as much as $300. (Or, rather, you could have once paid as much as $300; the 2,500-copy limited run of the deluxe-packaging version of Ghosts I-IV sold out within three days.) That Radiohead model, it turns out, only works if you're a band on Radiohead's or Nine Inch Nails' level-- one with an arena-rock history and a rabid internet fanbase. Reznor stands to make millions from Ghosts, something that certainly wouldn't have been true if he'd released this two-hour 4xCD instrumental work on a major label. Reznor's defection from the music business might be the best thing that ever happened to him financially and ideologically. Aesthetically, it might be the worst. Reznor's greatest strength has always been his ability to let his fundamental pop sensibility show through his fuzzed-out industrial signifiers and screaming-at-a-wall tantrum-rock pretensions. For all its heavily processed walls of guitar and reptilian electro lurching and cusswords, Pretty Hate Machine, still my favorite of Reznor's albums, is basically a dirtied-up Human League album (and Human League albums, it turned out, could stand to be dirtied up). The gas-masks, megaphone yowls, and apocalyptic despair of his subsequent albums were fun, but his old-school devotion to song form and titanic hooks were the real reasons I once carved the NIN logo on a treehouse wall. As a producer, Reznor knows how to stack drones on top of each other and crystallize pianos like nobody else, but those studio tricks don't add up to much when he's not welding them to actual songs. There's not a song to be found anywhere on Ghosts; nearly every one of the untitled instrumental sketches here feels emaciated and half-finished. What we're left with is two hours' worth of really good soundtrack music for American remakes of Japanese horror films. In the 90s, Reznor played patron saint to IDM OGs, commissioning Aphex Twin remixes and signing Meat Beat Manifesto to his nothing label. In that regard, Ghosts is almost Reznor's IDM record, only he's never been all that interested in jittery side-panning drum programming or vintage-synth blob-farts. And this isn't ambient music either; nearly every piece here feels like a piece of a Nine Inch Nails song, a DVD extra to a movie we might never see. Many of the best tracks here are straight-up fuzz-rock stomps, but without the burden of lyrical conveyance or song-progression, that riffage just hangs there, churning without purpose. Elsewhere, Reznor pits staticy drones against each other to see what happens, and often there's a built-in sense of melody and a dynamic force at work; it's just frustrating that we never hear what Reznor might do with it. Sometimes he'll bury chattering electro beats under forebodingly tortured synth-tones. Sometimes he'll offer shockingly clear impressionistic Erik Satie-esque pianos, letting them plink prettily away for minutes at a time before sending some new ominous machine-hum to molest them. Every once in a while, he'll use a riff or a bassline that I could swear he's used before but can't quite place. But even if every one of these tracks stands as a formal experiment unto itself, after an hour or two these half-formed ideas begin to bleed indistinctly into each other, evolving into puddles of vaguely ominous aural mush. When Ghosts works best, it's as a showcase for Reznor's estimable studio skills. Plenty of the individual sounds here are just gorgeous, and Reznor even expands his palette a bit to encompass marimbas, banjos, and percussively Beck-like slide-guitar. He layers these sounds expertly, setting glassy pianos against distant roaring-siren counterpoints or interrupting a pulsing drone-hum with a surprisingly accessible bar-rock chug. But even as the tracks progress, nothing really goes anywhere or stands on its own-- even the best track here is essentially half of a really good Nine Inch Nails song. And maybe it still will be; Reznor could take the pieces here and and make great songs out of them, sort of like how James Murphy took a beat from his Nike-sponsored long-form LCD Soundsystem piece 45:33 to make the incandescent ""Someone Great"". Until then, though, we're left with pieces of songs, nothing more. If I were one of those early deluxe-pacakge customers, I'd want my $300 back.","Trent Reznor's defection from the music business might be the best thing that ever happened to him financially and ideologically. Aesthetically, Reznor's move is, so far, reminiscent of Prince's a decade ago-- his first new self-released project is a two-hour, 4xCD instrumental work.

Demonstration Tape (1997-2007),Solvent,by: Mike Orme,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b5515e6ef9596932274f/1:1/w_160/da2d12ce.jpg,2008-04-01 06:00:05,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11318-demonstration-tape-1997-2007/,Ghostly,"Jason Amm (aka Solvent) certainly isn't the first or last composer of happy ""robot music""; as one example, Jimmy Tamborello was similarly bubbly in his synth-pop alter-ego James Figurine before he was hammering out the electro-emo-pop of the Postal Service. But Amm's Solvent work is notable for its special melodicism and, more importantly, for its longevity. As this compilation's title suggests, Solvent has been around for over ten years now. Amm originally compiled this retrospective as a tour-only primer for his tour supporting VNV Nation. The two-disc set certainly shows off the remarkable consistency of Solvent's run, so Ghostly's decision to release it isn't too much of a surprise. Older tracks like ""My Blue Car"", always in limited release and often out-of-print, are treats for fans, and later cuts like ""My Radio"" nicely chronicle Solvent's timely entry into the techno-pop revival of the early part of this decade. His work exhibits influences of the new wave as well as older, progressive electronic artists like Kraftwerk and YMO. Solvent has at times been lumped with electroclash or IDM, but these comparisons never quite made sense. Artists such as Adult. (who turned in one of the four remixes on Demonstration Tape) or the IDM acolytes advocated sonic aggression as either an intensifier or an alternative, respectively, to the club. Though he uses heavier beats and more obtuse synthesizers than many of his contemporaries, Amm seems caught up in the idea of a boutique style of electronic music. He concocts pretty confections with buzzy drum machines, major-key synth lines, and sparse, faraway vocals that long for the pristine infinities of the future. It's almost difficult to sit through what appears to be the same message over and over: We're moving towards an age devoid of conflict, and our greatest challenge is to revel in the patterns constantly emerging from the complexities of time. Of course, the threat of conflict isn't necessary for a bunch of pretty songs or even an artistic statement. But instead of fully exploiting his palette, or hinting at the seemingly inevitable crises ahead, he's telling us over and over again to appreciate beauty. His approach, applied over ten years and distilled into two discs, washes together in a sea of ebbing, ever-evaporating, synthesized waves. It's certainly tempting to imagine such an elegant future. But even for all his major-key optimism, Solvent's is an outlook with only a disheartening modicum of stability: a homogeny that, quite simply, gets by.","This 2xCD set documenting the last decade of Jason Amm's electronic pop project is remarkably consistent, almost to a fault.

Innocent Youths,"Earth, Roots and Water",by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b545ea9e61561daa6db1/1:1/w_160/56c61a80.jpg,2008-04-01 06:00:04,Global,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11310-innocent-youths/,SummerSummer,"It came from a basement in Malton, Ontario. The Toronto suburb seems ill-positioned to be the source of a dubbed-out catalog of unique and innovative roots reggae, but a wave of Jamaican immigration in the 1960s brought with it one Jerry Brown, an auto body mechanic who also happened to be a singer. Before leaving Jamaica, Brown had been an original member of the Jamaicans, the group that went on to record the rocksteady classic ""Ba Ba Boom"" after his departure. Brown fell easily into the West Indian music scene that was exploding in Toronto in the late 60s, but it wasn't until 1974 that he got down to the business of establishing Summer Records and its accompanying recording studio in the basement of his Malton home. It was a shoestring operation, a labor of love, but it played host to some truly huge names in reggae, including former Skatalites keyboardist Jackie Mittoo, former Treasure Isle keyboardist Lloyd Delpratt, Leroy Sibbles, Stranger Cole, Johnny Osbourne, and producer King Jammy, who was still only Prince Jammy when he helped wire the studio. That studio became the focus point for an aggregation of local talent, mostly from Jamaica, but also a few Jamaicans from England and even one local kid. The regulars at Summer coalesced into a house band with a firm grasp on the tight groove that anchors most good reggae. They took the name Earth, Roots & Water, and in 1977, cut the first Summer Records LP, Innocent Youths. The record went nowhere-- how could it have? It had an original pressing of just 500 copies, one of which was given to Sting by guitarist Matt Shelley when the band opened for the Police, who were touring North America for the first time. Despite its obscurity, though, Light in the Attic's new reissue reveals it as a creative and absorbing roots album. It flows like a dubbed-out late night jam session, moving from idea to idea as the musicians come and go and take breaks to smoke a little herb. The record's original Side Two is essentially a dub suite, skanking slowly from one section to another as a rotation of male and female vocalists take their turns at the mic. The three songs that made up Side One were more discrete. The opening title track features a haunting melodica lead and a deep, hollow rhythm track that houses rolling echoes and a rich bass line. ""Tribulations"" could hardly have been a more powerful roots anthem in the hands of Burning Spear or Yabby You, with its slippery bass line, spectral vocals and spidery guitar work, though the tone of the string synth is admittedly a little weak. True to the previous volumes of the Jamaica to Toronto series, the album has been given a sonic dusting-off and comes with a thick book full of primary source information and amusing anecdotes, such as the story of the band playing between a local punk act and the Stranglers, and bluntly admonishing the crowd not to spit on them after seeing it happen to the opening band. It strengthens your connection to the men who made the music to hear it told in their own words. There's word that this is possibly the last title in the series, which is sad news, but the six volumes we've received have illuminated a treasure trove of great music from a scene that wasn't nearly as marginal as a first glance might make it seem.","The latest entry in Light in the Attic's Jamaica to Toronto series focuses on the Summer Records house band who, in 1977, cut this, the first album released by the Canadian label.

Everywhere at Once,Lyrics Born,by: Nate Patrin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b547ea9e61561daa6db6/1:1/w_160/139e55b0.jpg,2008-04-01 06:00:03,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11311-everywhere-at-once/,Anti-,"Tom Shimura is a nice guy. He's got an agile but easygoing rapping/singing voice, a murmuring rumble that he can switch from a deep raspy whisper to a piercing, high-pitched buzz on cue. He brags without being arrogant, his anger is short on rage and his sex rhymes are of the happily married, mild innuendo variety. There's not much glamor or danger in his lyrics or his persona; it seems more likely that a listener would want to hang out with him as a peer than live vicariously through him as an icon. I can't recall ever hearing about any beefs he might have had with anybody, and I can't imagine him getting involved in one any time in the future. He creates rap records Bill Cosby would find no problem with, records that your mom would probably like if she were young in the early 1980s, and it is almost impossible to feel like a hardass while listening to his music. That last paragraph might have read like a condemnation, which is kind of sad in a way. Lyrics Born's brand of uplifting, inoffensive party rap is maybe the least cred-boosting form of hip-hop outside of nerdcore, the kind of stuff we worry that real heads from the street are laughing at us for listening to. But it's also likeably unpretentious, and the best parts of Everywhere at Once show Lyrics Born as a sort of lighthearted yet substantially energetic vocal presence at the center of a big, shameless funk record. After swapping sample-based production for a sound largely centered around the live band that's been backing him up during the many live gigs he's played since the release of 2003's Later That Day..., he's filled a pretty comfortable groove on this CD, front-loaded as it is with the sort of Rick James/Gap Band/Cameo turn-of-the-80s style that complements him well. Even when he's going full tilt at his modern SoleSides-cultivated West Coast backpacker smooth-and-assonant style, the band really brings out a halfway old-school vibe in his rhymes. Despite a few underlying themes to some of the cuts-- ""Don't Change"" is the archetypal be-yourself anthem; ""Differences"" and ""I'm A Phreak"" and ""I Like It, I Love It"" cover the spats, sex, and love-struck excitement in relationships-- most of Everywhere at Once's first half is geared towards flat-out lyrical gymnastic party rocking. Early single ""Hott 2 Deff"" (featuring a sharp verse from Chali 2Na's familiar basso profundo) is probably the biggest potential crowd-pleaser, riding on a ""Give it to Me Baby"" bounce and stacking hooks upon hooks. But it's the way Born builds up and rolls out each syllable to play off that groove that really makes it; it's one thing to read a verse of his to try and diagram where all the gears in his flow start meshing (""Then I'm jetty like a Chevy on fresh Pirellis/ I'm talking veni, vidi, vici, baby, rest is history""), but to hear it in action like its own kind of instrument, whether rapping or singing, is where the power actually lies. There's plenty more moments like that, like the way the semi-conversational tone he affects in ""Don't Change"" subtly acts as a second bassline, or the rasp that harmonizes with the ""Fopp""-esque guitar in ""I Like It, I Love It"", or one bit in ""Differences"" where he rattles off a string of words where every long ""e"" sound hits in time with the rhythm guitar. But as intricate as it all gets, none of it really sounds smothering or self-indulgent; if Lyrics Born has one defining strength it's his ability to get structurally and rhythmically adventurous in his flow while still remaining perfectly simple to follow linguistically. The upbeat electro-funk mood eventually flags a little in the second half of the record, though part of that can be attributed to a couple of tracks that work on their own terms as more contemplative and personal moments. The downtempo ballad ""Is it the Skin I'm In?"" is subtly reminiscent of Curtis Mayfield, both in its plaintively-sung chorus and its reflections on racial self-consciousness. And ""Whispers""-- about the passing of his friend Benjamin Davis, aka rapper and KPFA rap radio show host Mack B. Dog (cop his short-but-great ""Hot Breath"" off Solesides Greatest Bumps)-- is a stirring eulogy with a Houston-tinged g-funk intensity and a laid-bare grief. Less effective are a couple diversions that stray a bit too far out of Lyrics Born's admittedly broad stylistic range; ""Top Shelf (Anything U Want)"" is a stab at dancehall that rarely gets deeper than its endless, smushed-together chorus, and hearing Lyrics Born tackle a bizarre Devo knockoff on the political screed ""Do U Buy It?"" only proves that there are limits to his singing voice's versatility (Mark Mothersbaugh being well outside them). But with only two weak tracks and some deletable skits outweighed by a dozen good-to-great cuts, Everywhere at Once is one of the best albums to come from a Solesides alumnus in along time-- and if anyone wants to give you shit for liking it, just turn it up until Shimura's voice drowns 'em out.","The best parts of Everywhere at Once show this Solesides alum as a lighthearted yet substantially energetic vocal presence at the center of a big, shameless funk record.

Attack & Release,The Black Keys,by: Roque Strew,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b57eb1335d7bf169a8f1/1:1/w_160/13b45bf5.jpg,2008-04-01 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11358-attack-release/,Nonesuch,"The Black Keys seemed doomed to linger in the long, black-and-red shadow of the White Stripes. That's perhaps unfair: Akron's Dan Auerbach and Patrick Carney have perfected their own brand of Delta-tinged, garage minimalism. But after four albums, even they seemed to realize they had hit a creative wall. Luckily, in 2007, they were tapped by producer Danger Mouse for a collaboration with Ike Turner, though when he passed away last December, the project left the duo with a host of material. This became the foundation of their fifth and most adventurous album to date. Maneuvering between the King of Rhythm's joie de vivre and their crestfallen, crossroads-blues heritage, Attack and Release subtly expands the Black Keys sound. An auteur raised on hip-hop, DM keeps the record from staying overly loyal to the Creedence or Free templates. This is a small but crucial difference from 2006's Magic Potion. He colors the band's no-frills narratives with futuristic accents or, on the opposite end, rural flourishes of psychedelia and folk. On each track they add a bolt of surprise that amplifies the pitch-black mood and message. Take the flutes and feedback of ""Same Old Thing"", which in combination suggest a childlike innocence peeled away by a cold, indifferent world. Likewise, a tension opens between the peppy xylophone and world-weary, Waitsian tremolo on ""So He Won't Break"". Longtime Waits and Elvis Costello guitarist Marc Ribot lends his powers to this song and to the anguished 6/8 masterpiece ""Lies"". Here (and elsewhere: ""Psychotic Girl"", ""I Got Mine"", ""Strange Times"") Danger Mouse's layer of backing vocals imbue these earthly stories with a beyond-the-grave air, taking lost-love themes to an eerily literal but quintessentially blues-y level. The unexpected organ line of ""All You Ever Wanted"" feels like a police ambush on this jilted-John ballad. We almost forget that, in light of the band's uniformly lo-fi discography, nearly every fresh sound on Attack & Release should strike us as alien. A sequence of slow burns, the record's tempos allow you to relish the details and the textures. ""Remember When (Side A)"", with its eddies of reverb, envisions nostalgia as something dim and meticulously crafted, with a touch of the fantastic. Speaking of the past, the raw, amplified wallop of the Black Keys' old days is still here, too. Given that Ike Turner was partly responsible for rock'n'roll's love affair with distortion, it would have been wrong for Attack & Release to discard fuzzy riffs. The other side of ""Remember When"" will sooth anyone longing for their sinewy Nuggets rave-ups. Fans of previous BK records will find this song and the first single, ""Strange Times"", the bluntest weapons here. ""Things Ain't Like They Used to Be"" leads the album to a grim finish. Auerbach's sluggish, hung-over melodies, echoed by teenage protégé Jessica Lea Mayfield's distant singing, carry an air of defeat. Addressed to an old lover, the lyrics describe a happier past, overgrown yards, a man blindly walking into battles, and other ingredients of lament. Yet Carney and Auerbach know that there's more to the blues than bad news. These men are stoics to the fingertips. ""It doesn't mean a thing to me,"" Auerbach repeats on the chorus. The jaded ex of ""Same Old Thing"" speaks the same language: ""It don't matter where you been."" We know better.","The Delta-tinged garage band's latest record-- created with producer Danger Mouse-- was originally conceived as a collaboration with the late Ike Turner. What remained following Turner's death became the foundation of their fifth and most adventurous album to date.

Consolers of the Lonely,The Raconteurs,by: Jason Crock,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b575c0084474cd0c2416/1:1/w_160/67f078df.jpg,2008-04-01 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11350-consolers-of-the-lonely/,Warner Bros.,"Never one to back down from confrontation, Jack White showed a little forethought this month and tried something new: He and his fellow Raconteurs rush-released their new album, Consolers of the Lonely, allowing it to hit stores merely a week after its existence was announced. Great for fans, a little tricky for the media (print especially). But despite (or even because of) expediting the process, they've still effectively given the media its hook: Raconteurs flout the system, bend the (one would assume) will of their record company, and hurry their album's release, hacks like us be damned. The cynical might say this is a red flag and a marketing gimmick, comparable to the press being denied advance screening to an upcoming movie, but that's not the case here. It's not a challenging record, nor one with any otherwise presentable narrative around it; it's four accomplished musicians making a decent-to-great record. For all their similar backgrounds, you'd think Raconteurs debut Broken Boy Soldiers would have come across as a little more fun to create. Their sophomore record seems hammered-out quickly, honing on what you'd expect from the members' pedigrees-- big hooks and bigger guitars, stuffed arrangements, and plenty of instrumental shock and awe. Or rather, it just makes all that sound easy. Even the fussiest arrangements feel natural, like friends screwing around rather than two songwriting talents facing off. This album isn't about the thrill of the new; the White Stripes have bent arenas to fit their particular vision, and the Raconteurs are grinning through their opportunity to fill them. From the first staccato scrape of guitar in the opening title track, White is easy to pick out of the mix, but the track's strolling swagger sounds like an easy compromise. A sudden eighth-note skip of the bass leads the band into a tempo boost that would be bar-rock by-the-books, were it not hiding a moment of cascading vocal harmonies and preceding a neck-constricting guitar solo. Other songs lean on overdone Ribfest-appropriate templates as well, but they all feature distinctive little details-- the Celtic violin of ""Old Enough"", the warm Memphis-borrowed horns on the tempo-shifting waltz ""Many Shades of Black"", the tweaked and overdriven licks of ""Hold Up"" or ""Five on the Five"". Many of those touches will sound familiar to White Stripes fans, of course, not to mention indulging White's Zeppelin fandom just one more time on ""Top Yourself"" (this time with banjos!). More of that teeth-rattling circus organ from Icky Thump hides in the corners of the strutting ""Salute Your Solution"", while ""The Switch and the Spur"" mashes spaghetti-western horns and regal cascading piano lines with echoing guitar chords out of a reggae track, all cramped together like a tiny budget Tarantino soundtrack. Maybe the best the Raconteurs can deliver is something like closer ""Carolina Drama"", a shaggy dog song-story featuring the attempted homicide of a priest and a rogue milkmen in its lyrics-- it's a song that tweaks tradition with a knowing wink, but doesn't disavow the power of continuing it. Despite leading much of the material, Brendan Benson doesn't contribute any ""Brendan Benson songs"" here; both he and White simply step forward as the occasion demands. The two vocalists, therefore, blur into one another in their roles as dual frontmen. White grows tremendously as a singer and gets a little of his mania back, while Benson tightens his belt a few notches and manages to sound just as excitable, notably on the tag-team vocal of ""Salute Your Solution"". Whether it was intended or not, White's personality sometimes overwhelms, and makes Consolers sound like a little sibling to Icky Thump-- a little less unique, certainly, but another loose, comfortable affirmation of what they do well.","Announced and released within a week, the sophomore record from Jack White and Brendan Benson's band features stuffed arrangements, big hooks, and even bigger guitars.

Without selling the newfound twang too thickly, the band nonetheless made a shift towards a down-home earthiness that tethered some of its more evanescent tendencies. Having formerly played with members of Band of Horses in the defunct sad-eyed Seattle outfit Carissa's Wierd, then-drummer Sera Cahoone followed its offshoot act long enough to handle kit duties for the aforementioned debut, departing prior to the recording of Cease to Begin. Clearly, however, she was on the same wavelength as her erstwhile bandmates regarding the need to temper ephemerality with something sturdier. Cahoone's own sophomore full-length, Only as the Day Is Long, could easily have wafted into the realm of wispy noncommittal Cat Power soundalikes itself if not for the reassuring presence of certain rustic-signifying instrumentation and arrangements. Cahoone enacts this push-and-pull from the opening track, ""You Might as Well"", girding gently clomping drums and a folky guitar figure against her lambent, echoing vocals, the song's subtle country underpinnings turning it into something hypnotic as opposed to hazily undefined. Its successor, ""Baker Lake"", nicely introduces the banjo and pedal steel that will likewise help anchor Cahoone for much of the remainder of the album, the latter instrument superlatively decorating ""Runnin' Your Way"" and ""Tryin'"" in particular. A couple of times (""Happy When I'm Gone"", the title track) Cahoone's assembled players even rustle up a knotty acoustic groove near-worthy of Iron and Wine's last record. The record's most significant musical disappointment is that Cahoone doesn't grace the drum stool more herself, with ""Baker Lake"", which features the record's most sublime percussion by some measure, being her sole turn with the skins. As a singer and lyricist, Cahoone doesn't do terribly much here to shake herself from the shadows of luminaries like Cat Power, Lisa Germano, and Azure Ray. That's not to say there aren't plenty of nicely evocative moments, as Cahoone does an especially nice job of describing the physical spaces of tousled and fraying love affairs on ""Shitty Hotel"", the exquisitely languorous ""Seven Hours Later"", and the title track. A wearied but welcoming tone of acceptance also permeates several of these songs, including ""You're Not Broken"" and ""Baker Lake"", and Cahoone mostly does a good job of skirting banalities, though ""Runnin' Your Way"" comes mighty close with pick-me-ups like ""You've got so much left in you/ And a big old world to see."" Once she catches wind that real country immersion demands narrative heft as well as music solidity, Cahoone will be a true earth-bound force.","Former member of the defunct Carissa's Wierd returns with her second solo album; while she's not always able to escape the shadows of luminaries Cat Power and Lisa Germano, there are plenty of nicely evocative moments to be found here.

Supercluster: The Big Dipper Anthology,Big Dipper,by: David Raposa,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b566c0084474cd0c23fc/1:1/w_160/ce0b32b1.jpg,2008-03-31 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11336-supercluster-the-big-dipper-anthology/,Merge,"I tried to describe Big Dipper's music to a friend without resorting to using the rudimentary ""indie rock"" label. In different circumstances, I would've gladly leaned on the astute description that WFMU's Tom Scharpling offers in the liner notes to the 3xCD Supercluster. He paints the group as the end result of a sonic Venn-Diagram between the three groups (Dumptruck, the Embarrassment, and Volcano Suns) to whom Big Dipper's four members used to belong. Of course, if someone already knows at least two of those three groups, then it's a safe bet that they already know about Big Dipper, and the logistical gymnastics I was putting myself through were unnecessary. After careful deliberation-- I spent at least five whole minutes of the work day on this-- what I came up with is the sort of vague description that's exemplary of the stuff that inspires the sort of burn-the-witch rhetoric you'll find in any number of lazy newspapers and blogs looking to zing music reviewers-- ""they sound kinda like early R.E.M., but nerdier and with more heft."" To translate into words that aren't as glib: I meant that Big Dipper shares early R.E.M.'s penchant for writing frisky pop tunes, but Big Dipper has a beefier bottom, and, well, they're nerdy. They write songs about hunting down the Loch Ness monster, they pen paeans to former bandmates and their destructive house parties, they make reference to UFO enthusiasts and astronomers. In even simpler terms: they sound a lot like what folks used to consider the sound of ""indie rock"" before the term became a meaningless catch-all banner for anything rock-like, unpolished, idiosyncratic, and potentially ""difficult"" for the average listener to dig. In a lot of ways, Big Dipper's story follows the mythical story of indie rock (the culture) during those halcyon pre-grunge days. If VH1 ever decided to revive their ""Behind the Music"" series to focus on the Homestead/SST underground, the general plot line of every episode would go something like this: ""As pedigreed underground darlings, with a small but loyal following within and outside the United States, [INSERT GROUP HERE] generated enough buzz to prick up the ears of the corporate music world. But with big money came big pressures, and the group's major label dalliance proved to be their undoing."" Whether by choice or circumstance, Supercluster opts to not include Big Dipper's one and only Epic Records release, Slam, which is probably for the better-- it's not awful, but horns and strings make awkward appearances on a good portion of the album, and the less adorned songs are too listless to make up the lost ground. What's left of Big Dipper's discography is what's on Supercluster-- their debut EP Boo-Boo, two full-lengths (Heavens and Craps), a collection of Homestead-era outtakes and demos, and 15 previously unreleased tracks from post-Slam recording sessions that would have comprised, in the words of guitarist Gary Waleik, ""the make-good follow-up LP."" The collection's first two discs show why long-time fans like Scharpling have kept the faith for so long. Whether they were bashing out slabs of rock such as ""Younger Bums"" and ""Easter Eve"", or winding their way through alternate-universe radio hits like ""She's Fetching"" or ""All Going Out Together"", the group's awkward yet winning charm never faltered. While the polish of Craps seems to come at the expense of the friskiness evident on the Boo-Boo / Heavens tracks mentioned above, songs like the shimmering ""Semjáse"" and shame-free ballads like ""Bonnie"" show the group spreading its songwriting wings. As for Waleik's claim about the demos available on the collection's third disc (titled ""Very Loud Array"") doing right by fans turned off by their first Epic offering: He's not just pissing in the wind. If the group had the chance to record and release songs like ""Restaurant Cloud"", ""Edith"", and ""Silentium"" on Epic's dime, it might have had an album on par with its earlier work, something that found a happy middle ground between the group's herky-jerky quirks and its burgeoning musical maturity. Instead, as with most groups of their era, it was remaindered by the industry, forgotten by all but a few loyal fans, and almost always referenced in a respectful, reverent fashion. There's a tendency with projects such as Supercluster to go overboard when trying to establish the excellence or greatness of the work being reissued, blowing all sorts of well-intentioned smoke up any available opening. Scharpling, to his credit, expertly plays the role of shameless hype-man in his essay, going so far as to call this multi-disc set a ""crucial"" compilation of ""one of the best bands ever."" You'll have to forgive me for not being as smitten with this otherwise enjoyable set of tunes. Where he sees a grand artistic statement trumpeting the group's neglected importance, I see a small piece of graffiti in the back room of a club saying ""BIG DIPPER WAS HERE."" The latter might not seem as big a deal as the former, but it's a part of history, and it's important for that reason. Whether this group becomes someone's Citizen Kane or a listener's American Pie should be left in the hands of the listener. What really matters is that the listeners are given a chance to find out for themselves.","Featuring members of Dumptruck, the Embarrassment, and Volcano Suns, Big Dipper wrote songs about hunting down the Loch Ness monster and destructive house parties; Merge gives them the reissue treatment they deserve.

No Disco Future,Melchior Productions,by: Philip Sherburne,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b54dc0084474cd0c23d4/1:1/w_160/8cfd9caf.jpg,2008-03-31 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11315-no-disco-future/,Perlon,"Repetition has always been Thomas Melchior's forte. Like any good minimalist, he knows how to drive a point home by tapping away, favoring patience over force. And after tapping away, in his inimitable style, for a long time now, he's made the best record of his career. That doesn't mean that Melchior makes ""minimal,"" much less what might once have been called ""microhouse."" Yes, he favors a stripped-down palette, usually just a couple of drum machines and analog (or virtual analog) synthesizers, judiciously fleshed out with a captivating vocal sample. (No Disco Future, Melchior's second solo full-length, is one of his first productions using Logic software; previously he programmed everything into hardware sequencers.) But house music, in its origins, was more authentically minimalist than most of what flies under the banner of ""minimal"" today, if only by virtue of necessity: Most of Chicago house's classic tracks made do with a handful of machines at most. What has always driven Melchior's productions is less a fetish for reduction than an affinity for Afro-American dance music's lean aesthetic, bumping and flexing down a road potholed with silence. Melchior's economical sense of the groove descends directly from early 1990s pioneers like Ron Trent, Chez Damier, and Blaze (in their ""Lovelee Dae"" phase). His beat structures-- swung, skippy, with rubbery bass lines beneath and high-flying ""wildpitch"" ostinatos above-- don't seriously deviate from blueprints drawn two decades ago. What he brings to the music is an esoteric sense of sound design and an irresistibly hypnotic charge. Melchior was born in Germany but spent much of his adulthood in London, before returning some years ago to Berlin. He got his start, in the early 90s, making acid, house, techno, and unusually danceable IDM in the duos Yoni and Vulva, for the labels Source and Rephlex, as well as working alongside the UK's house and techno pioneer Baby Ford in groups like Soul Capsule and Sunpeople. Melchior's multinational background goes some way towards explaining the unique character of his sound, just as his childhood education in Rudolf Steiner's unconventional Waldorf Schools suggests the origins of his dryly psychedelic, almost mystical approach to sound sculpting. (Fun fact #1: Sufjan Stevens is a fellow Waldorf alum. Fun fact #2: Melchior is a non-ironic student of astrology.) For listeners acquainted with Melchior's earlier works, like his 2004 Playhouse album The Meaning and his various singles for Perlon, much of No Disco Future will sound familiar at first. He still makes the most out of an electronic drum kit that's been pared down to kick, snare, hi-hats, handclaps, a clave or shaker or two-- and very little else. As always, his tumbling rhythms are both headstrong and reserved, as though pulling in two directions at once. (Like Matthew Herbert's, Melchior's beats follow their own time, not the MIDI clock's.) He still favors stubby bass lines that stumble around the tonic, and he still uses synthesizers as though they were watercolors, splashing color here and there like a particularly slapdash Fauvist. Often, his melodies are only implied, pieced together out of carefully tuned drums and samples to suggest a continuity that's only half there. Listening to Melchior feels more active than usual because he invites you to do half the work. Perhaps most crucially, he still uses voices-- usually speaking, not singing-- to add a human element to his music. Often, the words or phrases are so indistinct to be meaningless, but their cadence adds an incalculable sense of life and breath to the tracks. (Not that the music would sound inhuman without them; skeptics who persist in criticizing electronic dance music for being cold, or programmatic, owe themselves some time with Melchior's fraught, fallible grooves: the white noise off his hi-hats alone burns hotter than your average indie four-piece.) Elsewhere, as with the titular phrase of ""Coming Up"", repetition blunts the words' signifying power, opening up a world of free associations. When, on ""The Hypnotist"", a woman intones, over and over, ""People smiling,"" and a man responds, equally deadpan, ""A nice warm feeling,"" you don't think of smiling people, or warm feelings: you just zone out on the assonance, transported by the mantra. Compositionally, though, No Disco Future is a major step forward for Melchior. He's taken a penchant for the vertical axis-- accidental harmonies that arise from piling tone on top of tone-- and welded it to an increased focus on the long, horizontal line. ""Prepare for Love"", the album's opening cut, may lay out a familiar, shimmying groove, but it coats it in a layer of honeyed melody unlike anything he's done before. Like a melting sitar, it drizzles down over a four-bar structure in such a way that you can't tell where it begins and ends; it suffuses everything. ""Her Majesty"" follows a similar tactic, this time with slowly blooming pads vaguely reminiscent of the melancholic changes of Ricardo Villalobos' ""Dexter"". ""Don Juan"" represents Melchior's first foray into (quasi-)tango, with a backmasked accordion line that encloses its rollicking rhythms and Cuban-sounding vocals in a kind of protective cocoon, while the closing ""Water Soul"" swirls together strings, piano, and coolly ecstatic vocals in a manner recalling Melchior's collaboration with Luciano, 2006's ""Father""/""Solomon's Prayer"". Ultimately, all of this is academic: either it grabs you or it doesn't. And No Disco Future grabs: it grabs, it blankets, and it holds. To return to the cocoon metaphor, it spins a dense web, a mutable and malleable shell that conforms to your moods and imparts an almost amniotic sense of security. I can think of few albums in all of house and techno that feel warmer or more comforting. Not that this is your garden-variety chillout disc: every cut here is made for dancing. That the album is simultaneously as cozy as a cashmere throw is entirely fortuitous. And there are moments of rare sublimity as well, moments that fly in the face of domestic comforts: ""Her Majesty"" is so sweeping, so grandiose, that it makes you want to rip out your heart and toss it off the highest cliff you can find. Taking flight, of course, is part of cocooning. Melchior's skill is taking those moments of abandon and weaving them seamlessly into the enclosure, until every action, and every object, becomes its opposite: every rhythm a melody, and vice versa; every beat a caress, every shove an embrace. It takes a particular kind of hypnosis to make such equations possible, and once you've submitted to Melchior's even back-and-forth, you won't be able to turn away.","After tapping away, in his inimitable style, for a long time now, minimally-inclined German producer Thomas Melchior has made the best record of his career.

Live 1969,Simon & Garfunkel,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b55913d197565213ac54/1:1/w_160/1d51f797.jpg,2008-03-31 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11325-live-1969/,ColumbiaLegacyStarbucks,"By the late 1960s, Simon & Garfunkel had become the folk establishment. The duo-- who had been together since their teenage years, when they were known as Tom and Jerry-- were unfailingly polite, earnest, and very, very serious, singing gorgeous harmonies and guided by their belief in popular music as big-statement art. Even as they drew inspiration from the Greenwich Village folk scene of the early 60s, they were never quite part of it, and never quite so stringent as some of their peers-- simultaneously too straight-laced and too ambitious. Dispensing studious allusions to Dylan Thomas, Robert McNamara, and Frank Lloyd Wright, they were and remain primarily unthreatening and accessible, which forty years later makes them an ideal gateway act to the weirder, harsher, more complex folkies of the 60s counterculture. Since the duo's infamous break-up, how many teenagers have closed themselves up in their rooms poring over the lyrics to even Simon & Garfunkel's most overwrought songs (like the high school poetry of ""The Dangling Conversation"") before graduating to Bob Dylan, Joni Mitchell, or Fred Neil? Their status as a jumping-off point for further musical exploration might explain their durable legacy even four decades later, but Simon & Garfunkel have a deeper, more consistent catalog than most of their peers. For all their politeness, they still took risks, still tried to innovate, as this document of their short 1969 tour proves. Released exclusively to Starbucks with a wider release planned tentatively for this fall, Live 1969 collects performances from their six-city run, which culminated in a two-night engagement on their New York home turf. Along the way, they premiered new songs from their forthcoming album, which would be titled Bridge Over Troubled Water and would prove to be their swan song. Part of the pleasure of listening to Live 1969 is hearing early versions of ""Why Don't You Write Me"" and ""Song for the Asking"" and imagining what it would have been like to hear them with fresh ears, well before they became lodged in the American music culture. As Art Garfunkel remarks, ""This is also one of our new songs. It's called 'Bridge Over Troubled Water'."" Five and a half minutes later, the hall erupts in rapturous applause. Another part of this album's appeal is hearing Simon & Garfunkel's backing band rip through numbers like ""Mrs. Robinson"" and even ""The Boxer"". Having already played on their two previous albums, the ensemble-- Joe Osborn on bass, drummer Hal Blaine, pianist Larry Knechtel, and Nashville picker Fred Carter Jr.-- give these songs a spark of energy, loosening them up where the studio versions were tight and tasteful. When someone in the audience yells for more piano, Garfunkel replies, ""The keyboard should be louder, huh? What label do you produce for?"" That's pretty dickish stage banter, but sure enough, a few songs later Knechtel's more prominent piano puts extra bounce in ""Why Don't You Write Me?"", which here sounds like it should be a break-out hit. In addition to offering proof that someone once yelled for ""Richard Cory"", Live 1969 represents a turning point for Simon & Garfunkel. By this point they were all but broken up, with Garfunkel ready to try an acting career and Paul Simon destined for a more productive solo venture. They played some of their last live dates together on this tour, and wouldn't play together again until their official reunion thirteen years later (unless you count their brief reunions on ""Saturday Night Live"" in the 1970s). The tension with which their partnership famously ended is nowhere apparent on Live 1969, although Simon seems to hang back while Garfunkel dominates, introducing the songs and running through Simon's composition ""Bridge Over Troubled Water"" solo. Ultimately, Live 1969 succeeds on the merits of its tracklist, which mixes hits like ""Homeward Bound"" and ""The Sound of Silence"" with lesser-known tracks like ""For Emily, Wherever I May Find Her"", ""Leaves That Are Green"", and the lone unreleased cover, ""That Silver-Haired Daddy of Mine"", which had previously been covered by their heroes the Everly Brothers. Late on the album, the back-to-back sequencing of the quiet, self-consciously poetical ""Sound of Silence"" with the defiantly self-delusional ""I Am a Rock"" feels particularly inspired-- two takes on loneliness whose contrast makes it possible to hear both songs somewhat afresh. In fact, that seems to be the primary and most compelling goal of this belated release: to let us hear these songs as if for the first time, as a means to reconsider the two men behind them.","Released exclusively to Starbucks with a wider release planned tentatively for this fall, Live 1969 collects Simon & Garfunkel performances from a six-city run, which culminated in a two-night engagement on their New York home turf.

Accelerate,R.E.M.,by: Joshua Klein,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b543c0084474cd0c23c9/1:1/w_160/f8486928.jpg,2008-03-31 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11308-accelerate/,Warner Bros.,"In a lot of ways, the R.E.M. story ended with 1996's underrated New Adventures in Hi-Fi. That was the final R.E.M. disc to feature drummer Bill Berry, and in retrospect, Berry brought a lot more to the band than simply his drumming. But that hasn't stopped R.E.M from awkwardly furthering the plot. First came the often pretty but not quite rewarding Up. Next, the pleasant but uneven Reveal, and then Around the Sun, which even most hardcore fans disdained as lackluster at best. But if rock-star longevity is at least partially political, the savvier-than-ever R.E.M. took it upon themselves to control their message. As the band's studio output dragged, it presented itself as a revitalized live outfit, turning out inspired performances that seemed wildly disproportionate to its increasingly dull LPs. Reveal didn't warrant a tour, but tellingly, the band's 2006 greatest-hits collection did, and on stage, R.E.M. relished the opportunity to disprove naysayers with blistering sets that spanned their entire career. Accelerate is the name of R.E.M.'s new album, the band's 14th, and it attempts to port that newfound vigor to the studio, not just by trading longtime producer Pat McCarthy (on board since 1998's Up) for U2 associate Jacknife Lee, but also by paring down the excess and sharpening the focus. Accelerate might as well be called Reverse, as it self-consciously aspires to recapture the spirit (if not necessarily the sound) of R.E.M.'s prime. Throughout its 11 songs and 35 minutes, only two tracks top the four-minute mark, and many run less than three. But velocity is not the same thing as vitality, and brevity is not the same thing as urgency. Accelerate ultimately isn't so much a back-to-basics move as a redefinition of what ""basic"" even means to an arena rock band. Accelerate's broad strokes, big riffs, and beefy production (the album was reportedly recorded in ""just"" nine weeks) are admirable, as is the disc's concision, but its success is still more as a step forward than a slam dunk. Still, the very fact that R.E.M. recognized a problem and made an effort to remedy it is pretty impressive from a band of their stature. You can immediately hear the results on the lead song ""Living Well Is the Best Revenge"": Jacknife Lee has given the track (and the rest of the album) a refreshing sense of grit that's at odds with McCarthy's fussier studio constructions. Peter Buck's guitar rings and chimes with a layer of aggression one step beyond that of Monster, the band's previous ""rock"" record. Drummer Bill Rieflin plays with a Ministry-honed power, Mike Mills' backing vocals are absolutely key, and Michael Stipe's vocals are gruff, pissed off, and mixed low enough to make the lyrics tricky to make out. But ""Man-Sized Wreath"" is no match for that airless rush-- its vague 60-isms might make a solid B-side, but it's hardly a continuation of the opener's call to arms. The same can be said of the slick, safe single ""Supernatural Superserious"", the kind of song R.E.M. could write in its collective sleep. ""Hollow Man"", aside from its piano intro misdirection, might as well be the Gin Blossoms, Counting Crows, or any other middle of the road band R.E.M. influenced. ""Houston"" is about as weird as R.E.M. allows themselves to get these days, but against the odds the track's a highlight. It's a curious 6/8 dirge adorned with what sounds like a wheezing organ, featuring some nicely enigmatic lyrics and a musical toughness that updates the insular world the band introduced with Automatic for the People. Again, like ""Living Well Is the Best Revenge"", it unfortunately highlights the relative mundaneness of the next two songs, the title track and ""Until the Day Is Done"". Accelerate make a surprise finish, though, with its last four songs pushing the band to fresh places. ""Mr. Richards"" is a vaguely blurry hybrid ballad that hints at shoegaze, invoking the band's staid studio experiments but connecting them to the group's more aggressive origins. Similarly, the self-referential ""Sing for the Submarine"" recalls an Up-era waltz while name-dropping some blasts from R.E.M.'s more distant past. ""Horse to Water"" is pure rush, just over two minutes of condensed energy unlike anything R.E.M. has done to date, a kick in the nuts to anyone not impressed by what came before it. And as closers go, ""I'm Gonna DJ"" is an oddball but memorable choice, perfectly selected for its gonzo agitation. If you forgot the last couple of R.E.M. discs as soon as they were released, love it or not, ""I'm Gonna DJ"" and much of what precedes it at least ensures that Accelerate won't be forgotten quite as quickly. But, like any act of rehabilitation, it's no seismic shift, just a move in the right direction. It's as if the band strived for resonance but settled for a satisfactory glimmer of renewed relevance.","R.E.M. acknowledge a few misteps with their 14th album Accelerate, trading the sleepy studio experiments of their recent LPs for renewed vigor and louder guitars.

Trilla,Rick Ross,by: Evan McGarvey,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b5345e6ef95969322723/1:1/w_160/b93c72b1.jpg,2008-03-28 06:00:05,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11296-trilla/,Def Jam,"I wish this could be just a series of jokes. I wish I'd never heard Comin' Out Hard or Ridin' Dirty or even www.thug.com. I wish we could all just be droll about Rick Ross' need for a bra, his insistence on rhyming the same word with the same word multiple times a verse, and his little waddle in the opening 45 seconds of the ""Speedin'"" video. But here it comes, marching into the commercial American sunlight. The second album from the Miami rapper whose sole strength as an MC is that he may or may not have touched a kilo of soft a few times in his life. Trilla, Rick Ross's inexplicable second album, is every bit a fatty contemporary American disaster. Synthesizers fill every space where things like human voices or silences might go. Ross struggles with negotiating the most basic couplets. He doesn't so much articulate words and phrases as simply drop his jaw and eject whatever. The only moderate successes are songs (""Luxury Tax"") where Ross lets MCs like Trick Daddy and Lil Wayne focus on things like diction and syntax. ""Speedin'"", the sole arena of fun on Trilla, at least has Ross trying to squeeze out some item-based personality: ""Caesar's salad/ Caesar's palace/ You not a boss little nigga 'cause your cheese is average!"" Of course, that fun is all part of an unconscious self-parody-- DJ Khaled and Diddy and Fat Joe and the Runners (whose presence on a CD is becoming reason enough to shred it) each helming their own speedboat, the horsemen of a delusional costume party. Hip-hop fans invested in history and emotion are bound to recoil at song titles like ""DJ Khaled Interlude"" and shake their heads at Ross' eleventh-hour attempts at humanizing himself (they're on album-concluding ""I'm Only Human"" and involve chocolate milk-related flatulence). Ross's attempts at self-definition-- ""This Me"", ""Here I Am"", ""The Boss""-- are as calculated and chilly as his odes to consumption are revealingly spirited (""Maybach Music"", ""Billionaire"", ""Luxury Tax""-- in that sequence, no less). Repetition is one thing, but having America's favorite ASIMO, T-Pain, squawking ""Boss! Boss! Boss!"" is something else entirely. Maybe it's a question of geography. A friend from Florida explained to me last week why non-Floridians could never ""get"" Miami rap. He illustrated it as a matter of utility: New Yorkers listen to rap composed in and designed for suffocating, intimate, cell-like rooms. California rap is for slow cruising, oven-baked afternoons, and suburbs that can turn deadly on you, literally, around the corner. Miami? Peacock posing on South Beach, tops down, windows down, and vacuum synthesizers spilling into the atmosphere like digital locust hordes. In that case, consider Trilla, in all its deaf, shrieking power, a sound that sadly symbolizes the blissful complacency of now.","Second album from the Miami rapper whose name rhymes with ""boss"" is unsurprisingly terrible.

Hawk Medicine,Lazarus,by: Joshua Klein,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b542ea9e61561daa6dac/1:1/w_160/cb98d674.jpg,2008-03-28 06:00:04,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11307-hawk-medicine/,Temporary Residence,"Rock is filled with rules spoken and unspoken, but one axiom has survived nearly from the start: when in doubt, lay on the reverb. From Sun Records through Suicide and Spacemen 3 to Bruce Springsteen's Nebraska and so on, it's hard to go wrong submerging your songs in sonic soup or a comforting cloak of cool, mystery, and sometimes both. In the wrong hands, though, it can be a real crutch, studio shorthand that confers mood at the expense of the music. Trevor Montgomery, who records as Lazarus, loves reverb, and one assumes Jason Quever (of Papercuts not-quite-fame) loves reverb, too. Quever produced Hawk Medicine, the third disc from Lazarus, and from the humming organ to the drums to the vocals, everything seems to be draped with reverb. Hawk Medicine could have been a complete mess, but like the best conflations of song and sound (Lee Hazelwood's ""Some Velvet Morning"", for example) it succeeds as more than just a superficial exercise in style. Here the pervasive reverb, combined with Montgomery's slightly adenoidal croon, creates an almost timeless late-night vibe, certainly indebted to the 1960s but still drawing from the dark corners of the last several decades of folk, country, and rock music. The key is that Montgomery's songs would likely work in any setting, even stripped down and laid bare. The melodies coursing steadily through songs like ""Baby True"" and the instrumental ""Disco"" are subtle, to be sure, but they're there, and they have a tendency to grow in power the longer they stick around, often with modestly cathartic results. If not exactly tormented by demons, Montgomery clearly has a lot on his mind, too. ""It hurts when we talk, it burns when we pray,"" he mumbles in the dirge-like ""The Manic"", like a guy about to throw himself off a bridge, ""So who gives a fuck?"" ""Hawks"" is similarly a downer, brightened only a bit by some embellished picking before giving way to a dark, noisy release, Nick Cave by way of Ian Curtis. In ""The Sky of the Tall Sun"", Montgomery rails against materialism like a guy who had it all before seeing the anti-consumerist light. ""Surrender to the heart, surrender to the sun,"" he seems to be commanding near its conclusion, as if finding salvation from the oppressiveness of the almighty dollar in the only two things that give us unconditional life. Songs like ""Breathe"" and ""Sister"" take great advantage of the spacious yet intimate atmosphere, with Montgomery sometimes almost lost amidst the deceptively spare but very effectively earthy instrumentation. These bleaker sketches heighten the impact of ""Sewest"", one of the few places where Hawk Medicine picks up the funereal pace, at least before Montgomery leaves us with ""Forsaken"", its final notes fading like a sinister sunset. When the album ends, the stillness and silence that follows feels almost like an intended coda.","San Fran space-folk sets the controls for the heart of despair.

Debt Dept,Excepter,by: Marc Masters,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b5565e6ef9596932275a/1:1/w_160/de0506e0.jpg,2008-03-28 06:00:03,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11323-debt-dept/,Paw Tracks,"Excepter fans tend to fall into two camps: diehard believers, and semi-skeptics willing to take the bad with the good. As the Brooklyn group's mix of bleeping sub-disco, stoned moaning, and Casio dub has slowly expanded, the latter faction seems to have grown, too. Even positive reviews often seem bemused by Excepter's peak-and-valley drift, especially their meandering live shows, which can alternate between magic and tedium. But if you've drank the Excepter Kool-Aid, the group's ""boring"" stretches are part of their charm, as they can sneakily morph into epiphanies. In that sense, Excepter are a psych group, their music mimicking the way drugs kick in right after you stop checking to see if they have. The funny thing is, there actually aren't that many dead spots on Excepter albums. Throne and Sunbomber are filled with peaks, and even less consistent efforts like KA and Alternation have minimal valleys. It helps that singer John Fell Ryan is an excellent editor, mining musical gold from raw sonic murk. Still, the threat of boredom always lurks, which explains how music this passive-sounding can be so tense. Ryan knows when to let ideas work themselves out, allowing generic sounds to gestate into something new. Sure, Excepter's music could be sharper and tighter-- but it would probably be drier and less interesting, too. Debt Dept, Excepter's first release on Animal Collective's Paw Tracks label, is neither sharp nor tight, but simply another solid addition to the band's oeuvre. It takes the shape of an Excepter show, starting slow and a bit lifeless, as if the musicians are warming up separately. The lumbering ""Entrance 08"", thin ""Shots Ring"", and hip-hop-ish ""Kill People"" are all interesting but skeletal, like promising tracings that the band forgot to ink in. But Debt Dept rewards patience; once ""Any and Every"" launches into a Black Dice-like mix of beats and yelps, Excepter ride a unwavering high the rest of the way. Much of this high comes from standard Excepter strengths-- rolling loops, clicking drum machines, and droning synths woven together deftly by Dan Hougland, Jon Nicholson, and Nathan Corbin. But there's also a boost from new singers Clare Amory and Lala Harrison, who hum hypnotic circles around Ryan's zombie moans. It recalls Excepter's early days, when previous vocalists Caitlin Cook and Calder Martin made the band sound like a cemetery full of ghosts. No one will confuse *Debt Dept'*s sparseness with *KA'*s noise, but it's nice to hear that element seep back into the band's elastic approach. All these factors make ""The Last Dance"" smoothly hypnotic, ""Walking Through the Night"" gorgeously eerie, and ""Sunrise"" (which ends with a strange semi-cover of Stevie Wonder's ""Higher Ground"") insistently tense. And they peak in ""Greenhouse/Stretch"", whose two mesmerizing halves-- one a wavy synth stomp, the other a trippy dub loop-- are bridged by sublime female vocals. Such highlights would be impossible without Excepter's willingness to risk tedium, and Debt Dept is a testament to the value of ambition over perfection.","Excepter's first release on Animal Collective's Paw Tracks label plays up the group's strengths-- rolling loops, clicking drum machines, and droning synths deftly woven together.

Body Language 6,Junior Boys,by: Mark Pytlik,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b56e9d034d5c69bf5018/1:1/w_160/aa21eba2.jpg,2008-03-28 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11344-body-language-6/,Get Physical,"Like recognizes like, and nowhere in music is that better articulated than in the hyper-stratified world of techno, where labels, rhythms, cities, and influences combine to make co-ordinates, and by extension, neighbors. If message boards are anything to go by, many bristled when Berlin's Get Physical first commissioned the latest installment of its Body Language DJ mix series from non-DJs Junior Boys, and yet both sides' co-ordinates are similar enough that the pairing actually makes sense; melody, warmth, a dollop of retro, and the renaissance of the artful dance vocal are just a few of their shared affinities. The Junior Boys might not be expert mixologists, but as their LPs and remixer choices imply, they are voracious listeners with a clearly defined aesthetic. Body Language 6 plays to those strengths, shuffling between straightforward minimal techno, tracks from modern vocal-led dance contemporaries, and a handful of electro, disco, and new wave obscurities with the free-associative looseness and comfort of someone half-drunkenly interrogating their own LP collection. This eclecticism is both BL6's greatest strength and weakness. Mixwise, it plays more like a loosely assembled block of individual moments rather than a fully formed set, the emphasis seeming more on the selection process of the pieces themselves rather than the way they hang together, as and such, might not fare well with those accustomed to Body Language's typically immaculately rendered rises and falls. As a panoramic snapshot of sounds and influences, though, it works beautifully. In fact, the range of variety on display in Body Language 6 conjures up comparisons to January's DJ-Kicks entry from Get Physical's flagship act, Booka Shade, which melded offbeat retro and sleek, streamlined techno to similar effect. Structure-wise, Body Language 6 can be broken down into three basic acts. There's the rhythm-centric first third, which leans hard on techno and house, intercutting favorites like Supermayer's ""Saturndays"" and DJ Hell's remix of Chelonis R. Jones' ""Deer in the Headlights"" with more obscure sidebars like Love Nine's grinding ""Feedback"" and the brokedown rhythms of Kreon & Lemos' seasick ""Fola"". The familiar, whirligigging synths of Kelley Polar's ""Rosenband"" introduce the album's second and meatiest portion, a colorful half-hour of texture, synth and vocal-rich house and electro. Not surprisingly, it's in this section that the mix sounds at its most authoritative; after softening things up with Steadycam's pressurized ""In the Moog For Love"" and Todd Terje's groove-heavy take on Studio's ""Life's a Beach!"", the pair sandwich bits of obscure italo (Pushé's ""Don't Take Your Love Away"") and spangly retro (Visage's ""I'm Still Searching"") between three newer tracks: Matthew Dear's superb ""Deserter"" B-side ""You Know What I Would Do"", Stereo Image's ""Dark Chapter"", and their own, previously unreleased orphan ""No Kinda Man"". Even though there's an ocean of 25 years between the five songs, their connections come logically and easily, making for one of the most satisfying stretches on the mix. The fading strains of ""No Kinda Man"" (itself a serviceable but perhaps unremarkable b-side) give way to the album's final third, which consists of a quick squiggle of noir techno from Rework, Chloé (whose thrilling ""Be Kind to Me"" is clipped after two minutes) and F0st3r (aka Junior Boys' touring drummer Dave Foster). An appropriately off-brief non-sequitur from new wave alchemist Bill Nelson closes out the mix, underlining, in its three minutes, the set's devotion to materials over transitions. If cohesiveness and a DJ's artfulness are what you're after, Body Language 6 probably won't do much for you; those more interested in some fast and thoughtfully compiled glimpses of what gets spun on the Junior Boys' private time will find lots to like.","The Junior Boys might not be expert mixologists but Berlin's Get Physical commissioning of them for its latest Body Language series still makes sense: melody, warmth, a dollop of retro, and the renaissance of the artful dance vocal are just a few of the group and label's shared affinities.

It's a Shame About Ray [Collector's Edition],The Lemonheads,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b5579d034d5c69bf4ff1/1:1/w_160/93d5a0bb.jpg,2008-03-28 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11324-its-a-shame-about-ray-collectors-edition/,AtlanticRhinoAtlanticRhino,"I couldn't have given a shit about the Lemonheads in 1992, when I was a freshman in college and all the upperclass women were swooning over Evan Dando. For me, his pin-up status de-authenticated his music, which seemed mopey and unsubstantial. He sounded detached, like a stoner at a funeral, and the songs on the Lemonheads' break-out album, It's a Shame About Ray, were so short (several under two minutes) and the hooks so nonchalant they sounded accidental, all of which suggested a paucity of ideas and a short attention span reinforced by song titles like ""Rudderless"" and ""My Drug Buddy"". So, when Rhino's new reissue arrived in the mail a few weeks ago, I put it in my early 90s boombox out of pure nostalgia, mildly curious to hear how or if it had aged. Since then, I've kept playing it for very different reasons, which are more difficult to pinpoint and hopefully say as much about the music as they do about me. Almost 16 years after its initial release, Dando's slacker pop sounds almost Zen. Those short songs now seem concise and even disciplined. What was once mopey now plays as something much more complex and contradictory: exuberant pop melancholy. Some background: The Lemonheads formed in Boston during the mid-1980s and released three albums of fuzzy punk-pop on local label Taang! Records before signing to Atlantic in 1989. Their 1990 major-label debut, Lovey, wasn't a huge return on the investment, but in the two-year interval between that album and Ray, Nirvana and the ensuing alternative boom proved that smaller bands and unlikely signings could have enormous commercial prospects. The Lemonheads both benefited and suffered from this new pop cultural climate: Just as Ray found a more open-minded audience, it was also disregarded by so many kids like me, who were suddenly very serious about music, man, and saw only Dando's model looks, not his songcraft. Never mind that Ray is as much a junkie album as Nevermind, written and partly recorded during a particularly narcotic-heavy trip to Australia. No wonder Dando was a pin-up: He was handsome but damaged, a fixer-upper. If he was the Jordan Catalano before Jared Leto, then the do-they-or-don't-they controversy between him and roommate/bassist/kissing partner/self-professed virgin Juliana Hatfield made them the Ross and Rachel of the ""120 Minutes"" set. Now that all of that hubbub has died down and Dando is just another alt-act trying to make a comeback, Ray sounds nearly revelatory in its restlessness, mixing college pop with country flair and relocating Gus Van Sant's Portland atmosphere to New England. The most beguiling aspect of the title track, one of Dando's best compositions, is its impenetrability: It could be about anyone or pertain to almost any bad situation, and that ambiguity suggests some tragedy that can't be named or faced. ""The Turnpike Down"" descends on a tripping hook that sounds altogether too bubbly for the material, while ""Alison's Starting to Happen"", inspired by a friend's ecstasy trip, sounds genuinely excited, especially when Dando starts rushing his words towards the end. ""Kitchen"", with its handclaps and effervescent jangle, rubs elbows with the tense chords and casually manic repetitions of ""Rudderless"", where the acoustic guitar sounds spikier than the electric. And the bow on the package is the not-necessarily-ironic cover of ""Frank Mills"", a song from the musical Hair that Dando sings with a charmingly goofy bliss. This is, of course, a reissue of a reissue: Less than a year after its initial release, Ray was re-released with that cover of ""Mrs. Robinson"" as a bonus track. It was more of a marketing than a musical decision, some suit's confounding idea to commemorate the 25th anniversary of The Graduate. So, take a red fine-point Sharpie and write ""(bonus track)"" next to that song title, and pretend it's a curious rarity rather than the lame album closer it became. The song is more endearing as a lead-in to Rhino's unearthed bonus tracks, which sound like they've still got dust on them. Aside from the B-side ""Shaky Ground"", which doesn't need the full-band treatment to convey its slept-on melody, there are nine rough demo versions featuring mainly Dando accompanying himself on guitar. That's three-quarters of the album, which isn't bad. There's also a DVD of videos and live performances from the Lemonheads' Australian tour, showcasing the circle of friends who inspired the album as well as a dated title-track clip starring Johnny Depp. But the real attraction here is that set of demos: Dando's songs stand up exceptionally well stripped to their barest essentials, especially ""My Drug Buddy"" and ""Bit Part"", which loses Peggy Noonan's shouted intro but features tender backing vocals from Hatfield. Ultimately, these demos prove how much craft and care went into the album's unique blend of levity and gravity, which sounds so unaffected it could easily be missed.",,8.4,
On High,Kate Maki,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b50b5e6ef959693226e9/1:1/w_160/d1c36967.jpg,2008-03-27 06:00:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11261-on-high/,Ow Om,"On High is Kate Maki's U.S. debut, but it's actually her third album. The Sudbury, Ontario-based singer-songwriter, whose folksy ruminations have earned her a following in her home country, released Confusion Unlimited in 2003 and The Sun Will Find Us the next year, but neither is available south of the Canadian border. Shortly afterwards, she met Giant Sand frontman Howe Gelb and made a small appearance on his album ‘Sno Angel Like You in 2006. Ostensibly returning the favor plus heavy interest, Gelb signed Maki to his OW OM Recordings label, and co-produced her third album, On High, which was recorded in five days with a small band of friends. Gelb himself plays guitar on almost every song, and he even duets with her on ""Don't Look Down"". Maki and Gelb make a fine match. Along with co-producer Dave Draves, he creates a dusty, twilit setting, full of junkyard guitars and ghost-town saloon pianos, and she settles in nicely, penning a collection of songs that use few words but are never simple. Maki, who teaches French and science when she's not touring, is rarely showy in her songwriting, and she can sell a song with only her voice and an acoustic guitar. ""Wanted Ads"" and ""We Are Gone"", two of the album's standouts, are delicate wisps of melody that would crumble under one more instrument. Occasionally Maki overreaches, as on the pseudo-philosophical ""Beyond the Sun"", and she can be cloyingly precious, as on ""Badminton Racquet"", a duet with Royal City's Nathan Lawr that sounds like a Juno outtake in the worst way: ""We keep together like a badminton racquet/ Bouncing little birdies everywhere."" Even when she strays, Maki's voice, which recalls early Suzanne Vega, remains delicate and invested with personality, often fading at the ends of words to intensify the sense of intimacy. For better or worse, Gelb is just as formidable a presence on these songs as the woman whose name graces the album cover. He contributes some curious flourishes here and there, such as the ruptured electric guitar on ""Highway"" and the echoey old piano on ""White Noise"", which sounds like it's mic'ed on the floor to capture the workings of the pedals. Occasionally, he threatens to overshadow her, and On High begins to sound more like another Gelb project than a Kate Maki album. She sounds a little lost on the over-orchestrated ""Beyond the Sun"", which eventually descends into meandering piano and organ solos. But generally such inventiveness is welcome, especially when it results in a song like ""To Please"", which scrambles along on a modified jugband beat while Gelb and steel guitar player Dale Murray perform solos by blowing on bottles. It sounds completely different from anything on the album, yet its spiritedness sounds like the flipside of Maki's slow, sad songs, revealing her willingness to stray from the typical strictures of this brand of folksy roots music.","Ontario singer-songwriter joins forces with Howe Gelb to create a moody record full of junkyard guitars and ghost-town saloon pianos.

J2,JarboeJustin K. Broadrick,by: D. Shawn Bosler,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b518c0084474cd0c2386/1:1/w_160/35e9f7f9.jpg,2008-03-27 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11272-j2/,The End,"When two artists with résumés like Jarboe and Justin Broadrick join forces, it's hard not to have high expectations. It would take many more words than this review warrants to describe the immense influence these artists have had on underground music: Between Broadrick's work with Napalm Death, Godflesh, Final, Techno Animal, and Curse of the Golden Vampire-- and that's leaving out a bunch (!)-- and Jarboe's with Swans, World of Skin, her solo albums, and numerous collaborations, all kinds of genres have been touched upon, if not entirely reworked: ambient, blues, cabaret, digital hardcore, doom, drum'n'bass, dub, grindcore, electronica, gothic, industrial, shoegaze, pop, psych folk, regular ol' rock, tribal. An open-eared musicologist could notice how these various strains grew horns, fangs, and wings and evolved into a whole new kind of beast after one of the Js left their golden touch. (For example, follow the way industrial metal and ambient guitar drone got a facelift by Broadrick, or note the weird and wonderful cross-pollinations Jarboe crystallized from mixing cabaret, blues, and goth with electronica sounds.) This pairing comes at an interesting juncture in both of their careers as both are possibly at their peak of recognition. For Broadrick, his brilliant Jesu project (a kind of epic and melodic, shoegaze-glazed Godflesh) has been like the elder master responding to the work of his students (primarily the whole Neurosis-Isis-Pelican post-rock metalgaze school) and in turn, blowing open the whole genre, yet again. Whereas with Jarboe, her Diamanda Galas–gone-(even more)-ballistic demon-diva thing has come home to roost among a new generation of extreme music lovers via her recent metal-related spin-offs: The last several years have found her involved with a Neurosis collaboration album, a band called Byla (featuring members of NYC-based prog/death bands Dysrhythmia and Behold...the Arctopus), a tag-team with black-metallers Cobalt, a guest video appearance with the Agony Scene, as well as loaned vocals for Tool's Maynard James Keenan–related projects A Perfect Circle and Puscifer. And there's more, but we still have a new album to talk about... Sonically, J2 sounds most like the terrain Jarboe has been exploring as a solo artist: dark electronica, laced, bound, and gagged with goth, psychedelia, and metal. Yet the seeds of this album were planted during the Jarboe-sung ""Storm Comin'"" from Jesu's recent Lifeline EP-- a dance-y, swirly, poppy track, perhaps even recorded during the same session as these. J2 opener ""Decay"" begins with eerie, heavily effected Jarboe yodels with a spooky synth-bass churning underneath. Then you get blasted with that thunderous distorted bass-- also an echo of sorts, showing how Broadrick's grit-doom bass from the first few industrial-based Godflesh albums owed a ton (operative word meaning heavy) to the Swans' early nightmare stomps. As to be expected, these six songs are packed with the signature components that make each artist so strong, but also included are their weaknesses: As ""Let Go"" and ""Magick Girl"" exemplify, sometimes the keyboard tones and drum machine choices that J & J have both chosen over the years leave something to be desired-- sound choices that are often an overlooked mainstay of Jesu and most of Jarboe's solo output. If watery, cheesy keyboards, not-so present piano, and canned drums with tinny sampled cymbals don't bother you, then it's easily overlooked. But still, those songs also show off some individual genius: While Jarboe explores different voices colored with different expressions of fire and air, often repeating and slowly building, Broadrick drops in his stupidly/brilliantly primal guitar sludge. The rest of the album splits the difference between the two: the heavy keyboard trip-out of ""Romp"" (Jarboe) and the My Bloody Valentine dream-drone of ""Tribal Limo"" (Jesu), and then there's the more overtly electronica closer ""8mmsweetbitter"" sounding like Jarboe dancing along to one of Broadrick's other bands-- Techno Animal perhaps? An interesting meeting of minds with majestic moments, but unfortunately, like most big name pair ups, this EP sounds like it could've used more time to really pull from each artist's grandiosity. With luck, they'll do it all over again.","Two of the most prolific, restlessly creative, and influential artists in underground music join forces; the result sounds closest to Jarboe's dark, gothic electronics.

At All Ends,Yellow Swans,by: Marc Masters,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b520ea9e61561daa6d6c/1:1/w_160/b3718dfd.jpg,2008-03-27 06:00:03,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11278-at-all-ends/,Load,"The relationship between drone and noise can be hard to define. Sometimes they are sides of the same coin; other times they conflict like boxers in a clinch. It's easy to say that not all drones are noisy, and not all noise is drone. But when a band combines the best of both, making something bigger than either could muster alone, words tends to fall short. At least, it's tough to capture the power of At All Ends, the umpteenth release from Portland's Yellow Swans. Since 2001, the duo of Pete Swanson and Gabriel Mindel Saloman have used vocals, guitar, and a wide array of effects to make music that constantly resists definition. They can sound abrasive, industrial, dreamy, electronic, even symphonic. Though they've earned a spot among the cream of the American noise underground, their music is so versatile and malleable, it's tough for any genre to fully claim it. Which means Yellow Swans haven't always made drones, nor have they always made noise. But they are certainly great at making each, and At All Ends shows they are even better at making both at once. This is an unashamedly epic album of grand noise-drones, with ambitious pieces in search of infinite expansion. Terms like ""end,"" ""stretch,"" and ""mass"" pop up in the song titles, suggesting that for Swanson and Saloman, universes of sound can fit into 10-minute chunks of music. If that's what they believe, At All Ends offers a convincing case. The album opens with the title track, a 12-minute journey to the center of guitar drone. Building into a holy mountain of static, it should be example number one in some future Wikipedia entry for ""noise-drone."" ""Stretch the Sands"" follows with long, screeching tones, like a horror-movie negative of the opening track's soothing waves. Those are two daunting pieces to start a record with, but At All Ends continues to rise, peaking with the masterfully-constructed ""Mass Mirage"". Here, Yellow Swans turn four shimmering guitar chords into first a sonic cathedral, then a trembling earthquake, and finally a pensive denouement, as the original four chords return like a phoenix escaping quicksand. This all might sound a bit lofty, but Yellow Swans' music is far from pretentious. It's actually pretty visceral, often as fun as a rollercoaster. And they can tell a joke, too: The title of the closing track, ""Endlessly Making an End of Things"", must be a self-deprecating reference to the band's sonic tail-chasing. But even if they acknowledge their ambitions, Yellow Swans don't apologize for them, and they shouldn't. At All Ends is as huge as it wants to be, maybe even more.","The umpteenth release from this Portland duo is an unashamedly epic album of grand noise-drones, with ambitious pieces in search of infinite expansion.

Sessions,Carl Craig,by: Andy Battaglia,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b55a9d034d5c69bf4ff3/1:1/w_160/d1cead80.jpg,2008-03-27 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11326-sessions/,!K7,"Carl Craig is so simply good at what he does that he can be hard to talk about. The effects of his best tracks, among the best in techno history, tend to be more incremental than incendiary. The arc of his career, so long and actually arcing, has never swerved through the kind of progressive flashpoints that make for grand narrative. Craig has always been about reform more than revolution-- even for his most stalwart fans, voicing support has been less a matter of redrawing electronic music borders than of waving flags for whatever Craig happens to be doing at any given time. But not all of it: Another reason Craig is hard to talk about is that a fair amount of what he's done has been less than essential. It wasn't long ago that Craig seemed to be going the way of other aging Detroit techno artists whose reputations owe more to legacy than to potential. However interesting his forays into jazz fusion, however stirring the occasional track that reiterated his influence, Craig remained stuck somewhere foggy between the there-and-then and the here-and-now. And the problem was compounded by the fact that there was never a single manageable manifesto-- a lone album, mix, or compilation-- that you could hand a new initiate and just say ""...here."" Sessions is that manifesto, at long last. Gathering 23 original tracks and remixes on two continuously mixed CDs, it catalogs all the hallmarks that have come to define Craig from the start: his concise beats, his distinctive warmth, his fluency with all the different subtleties and nuances of ""soul."" All prove abundant on Disc One, which moves between tracks made from 1992 to 2007 without showing the slightest bit of strain. The newest cut is one of the recent epics that have reasserted Craig's importance in the present: a remix of Junior Boys' ""Like a Child"" that plays arpeggiated vertigo games with source material whose emotive delicacy Craig retains while piling on sci-fi strings and a hissing beat that creeps until it cracks. The nature of that crack-- into a crevice burrowed between a spirited house-y saunter and robotic techno drive-- figures in other tracks as old as Paperclip People's ""Throw"" and as new as a remix of Delia Gonzalez & Gavin Russom's ""Relevee"", which pushes cosmic synth patterns past the red-line toward something more majestically black and blue. Disc Two features fewer remixes of other artists and more tracks of Craig's own-- either under his given name or aliases like 69, Tres Demented, and Innerzone Orchestra. Though two of the highlights are in fact more remixes: a steaming, stomping, strobing rework of Faze Action's ""In the Trees"" and a tender take on X-Press 2's ""Kill 100"", whose fleshy vocals and dark acid lines signal Craig's facility with both pop humanism and techno alienation. Plus, like so much on Sessions, it's hard to place in time. Indeed, the most noteworthy aspect of this invaluable set is that there's so little disparity in terms of quality between tracks that span 15 years. They're all just simply, extremely, uncommonly, uniquely... well, good.","A Detroit techno legend mixes a career retrospective on his own terms.

Funplex,The B-52’s,by: Eric Harvey,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b552c0084474cd0c23db/1:1/w_160/1801ce13.jpg,2008-03-27 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11319-funplex/,Astralwerks,"To put it (very) lightly, the B-52's have never felt at home completely in the here-and-now, preferring to mix together modern and outmoded styles in a parallel universe of garish fashion. The band's stone-cold classic 1979 debut still sounds like nothing else before or after: A surf-rock soundtrack to an early 60s spy film about a gay underground dance culture from the future. The band's self-consciously retro appeal was never a gimmick, and still isn't: It's rooted at the foundation of the genre they created and own, to the extent that it's their brand. Like their debut's late 70s debts to new wave and garage rock, there's a lot about Funplex, the band's first album since 1992's Good Stuff, that says 2008 loud and clear. The visual elements that make the B-52's undeniably themselves-- Pierson's and Wilson's dos and dresses, Schneider's gaze and pose-- are present on the cover, but on top of a stark white infinity backdrop and with the sterile clarity of digital photography. The band brought in producer Steve Osborne, who's got some experience giving old bands new sounds-- he helmed New Order's 2001 comeback Get Ready and Suede's electro-pop departure Head Music-- and he gives the band its most massive sound yet, as if they've returned to reclaim their dance-band throne through volume and size alone. While Funplex's super-sized dance pop can't quite compare with the band's best moments, there's plenty of residual B-52's-ness to satiate longtime fans. The title alone, which hints at a self-contained universe of good times and weirdness, is appropriate for a band so prone to creating self-contained worlds like ""Planet Claire"", ""Private Idaho"", ""53 Miles West of Venus"", and of course, ""that little old place where we can get together."" Though the band members' average age is now in the mid-50s, they still navigate their surroundings with the naivete of tourists. When Fred Schneider paves the way toward the chorus with the lyric ""Faster, pussycat/ Thrill, thrill!/ I'm at the mall/ On a diet pill!"", I can't tell if he's being sarcastic or honestly reveling in his superficial surroundings, and that alone is evidence that the band hasn't lost much of what made it so great in the first place. Funplex's songs are just as jubilant as they were on Cosmic Thing and Good Stuff, with bits of dark surf guitar, outer space, travel themes, and of course, kitsch culture bleeding through the high-gloss electro-pop. ""Deviant Ingredient"" brings some lounge and exotica along for the ride down ""that Martini mile,"" and ""Hot Corner"" sneaks a dark guitar rumble under the verses with a with an ebullient Cindy Wilson/Kate Pierson chorus, as the band transforms a 3 a.m. bus stop into a dance party. Even a bit of the band's political bent comes across on closer ""Keep this Party Going"", but in a pleasingly non-didactic manner that would fit any era: ""Take this party to the White House lawn/ Things are down and dirty in Washington!"" Most importantly, though, all of it's delivered in three of the most recognizable timbres of the past 30 years, which sound as wonderful as ever. When they harmonize, Pierson and Wilson conjure a giddy, yet spooky femininity attributable only to the band, and as for Schneider, there's still no one else making music who can pull off the ""Ultraviolet"" lines ""There's a rest stop/ Let's hit the G-Spot!"", or ""Tell your skirt to take a hike!"" This isn't to say that the band is above its more confessional bits: At one point, Schneider blurts out a line that might have come from Hissing Fauna, Are You the Destroyer: ""I am a fully eroticized being! No more neuroses!"" This overriding theme of Funplex-- temporarily forgetting your troubles and giving over completely to the pleasures of getting down-- underscores the album's two best moments, ""Juliet of the Spirits"" and ""Eyes Wide Open"". ""Juliet"" is the album's ladies-only electro-jam, Pierson and Wilson's voices pushed into a deleriously high register, and asserting on the wide-eyed chorus ""I'm not afraid anymore."" ""Eyes"" moves from a dark, claustrophobic verse to an expansive disco-tinged refrain, triggered by Strickland's crisp, echoed guitar: ""I don't wanna clash/ I don't wanna rehash the past/ I just wanna release!"" There will always be those boring purists who think that punk bands should forever play punk or die, or that people over 50 shouldn't have sex or, you know, fun, two silly myths more than debunked here (as well as with Bob Mould's latest reincarnation). Funplex is a place, but it's also a condition. No matter what the B-52's do, they can't help referencing what they're doing and how great of a time they're having while doing it, and wonder, Why aren't you doing it too? It's fitting that, along with R.E.M.'s Accelerate, both canonized groups to crawl from Athens at the dawn of the 80s have reappeared nearly 30 years after forming to release pretty damn good pop-rock records. Records that thankfully emphasize a way to age gracefully that takes the sonic shape of stuff traditionally associated with those much younger. The B-52's may have no desire to rehash the past, sure, but they know how to adapt.","On their first album since 1992's Good Stuff, the venerable pop band shows off its most massive sound yet, as if its returned to reclaim its dance-band throne through volume and size alone.

Another Country,Tift Merritt,by: Joshua Love,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b4e9c0084474cd0c2346/1:1/w_160/cfe5a56f.jpg,2008-03-26 06:00:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11229-another-country/,Fantasy,"The impending demise of No Depression magazine, brought on by declining ad revenues symptomatic of the music industry's general malaise, is undeniably sad. It likely didn't help matters that ND was a niche publication, and that its niche was alt-country, a genre whose hippest days are, at least for the time being, solely in its rearview. The height of alt-country's visibility and No Depression's prominence coincided with the success of unpolished, deeply twangy throwbacks like Uncle Tupelo, Gillian Welch, and Whiskeytown. In recent years, however, the roots movement has cleaned up its act, and the emergence of competing rags like Paste and Tracks that lack ND's gritty legacy points to a new landscape where safer, less-regionalist performers like Norah Jones and Josh Rouse hold greater sway. Whether intentionally or not, Tift Merritt has managed some savvy positioning throughout this sea change. Merritt's 2002 debut, Bramble Rose, introduced the North Carolina native as one in a then-steady succession of insurgent sweethearts, alongside the likes of Kasey Chambers and Kathleen Edwards. As a Southern-bred critic's darling with a fragile, honeyed voice that brought to mind the irreproachable Emmylou Harris, it seemed fated that Merritt's fortunes would be tied to alt-country's as a whole. However, as the genre's trendy cachet began to erode, Merritt herself started moving away from those dirt-road influences and towards a more MOR, pop-flavored take on roots, namely the laidback stylings of Bonnie Raitt or Carole King. The shift was already evident in 2004's Tambourine (ironically nominated for a Grammy for Best Country Album), and is only further crystallized by Merritt's newest record, Another Country (its title, of course, representing another irony). Time will tell whether Merritt's artistic adjustments will make business sense (Tambourine barely outsold its predecessor), but what's more important is whether distancing herself from No Depression tropes has made Merritt a better or a poorer artist. At first glance I'm inclined to say it's a boon, recognizing that alt-country is an enticing trap most of its greatest practitioners (Ryan Adams, Lucinda Williams, Jeff Tweedy) eventually freed themselves from, to at least some degree. Then again, results speak for themselves, and Another Country just isn't nearly as consistently satisfying as Merritt's earlier offerings. Her voice is still the same willowy, sigh-inducing instrument, and it shines as ever on ""Hopes Too High"" and the admittedly powerful title track, both of which nonetheless move with the same kind of pleasantly distracted amble that tows most of Merritt's compositions. A little juice is typically a solid cure for lazily shuffling ingenues, but the jauntier likes of ""My Heart is Free"" and the horn-aided ""Tell Me Something True"" actually squash the melodic effects that go a long way towards redeeming her songwriting. At least until a line like ""start revolutions with a glint in your eye"" jumps out and makes you wince a little. Regarding what I suggested above about alt-country's enticements, I really do believe that a little pedal steel can cover up a multitude of sins. I wouldn't go so far as to call Merritt's initial recordings a smoke-and-mirrors act-- something else besides dirt was under her fingernails then, something that's been lost in her subtle-but-definite folk-pop reinvention.

Humanimals,Grand Ole Party,by: Eric Harvey,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b52f9d034d5c69bf4fa5/1:1/w_160/b9daa00a.jpg,2008-03-26 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11292-humanimals/,DH,"A few years ago, when Kristin Gundred and John Paul Labno were jamming drummerless, the duo eschewed Craigslist-fishing for trap-work, and Gundred decided to hop behind the set herself. For a band trying to make noise in a crowded field playing basic blues-based pop-rock, moving the attractive female lead behind the most cumbersome instrument around was a gamble to say the least, but a few years later, it's starting to pay off. GOP's MySpace page fell under the sniffer of Rilo Kiley/the Elected's Blake Sennett, who saw potential enough to produce the trio's first full-length record Humanimals, as well as convince his manager Dave Holmes (who also handles Coldplay and Interpol), to release their debut on his DH Records. Once writers got wind of them, comparisons between the GOP and the Yeah Yeah Yeahs came fast and furious. At least superficially, there's something there: both are trios with a bold chick singer and two less-bold dudes, and both share a generalized orienting framework toward rock-- Nuggets-style blues-riff variations and howling female vocals. What separates the GOP from the YYYs is evident in the former's moniker, really: Instead of lacquering on the gallery grime and experimenting with texture and meter, Grand Ole Party's fifth-generation blooze is as uncomplicated and artless as nickel beer night or a sweaty, jam-packed house party. A lyric from the surf-rock inflected ""Belle Isle"" should give a good-enough idea of GOP's M.O.: ""How can the young things keep at bay/ The dark shadows, if they can't drink them away?"" The San Diego trio is certainly self-aware, as well, and wears its starkness as honesty. During the refrain of the call-to-arms ""Turn on, Burn on"", Gundred asks, ""Why can't we be simple, and enough to matter""? There's not much new on Humanimals, but its simple, spacious throwback rock is rendered ingratiatingly, recalling the re-energized greaser rock of Mink Deville and Richard Hell, with occasional hints of a boiled-down Pretenders in the cooed background vocals of Labno and bassist Michael Krechnyak-- especially on the catchy choruses to ""Insane"", ""Redrum Heart"", and ""Dirty Spirit Rag"". Lyrically, Gundred indexes the time-tested signifiers of rock-as-rebellion-for-lost-youth, her strained howl showing naïveté and toughness in equal parts. Humanimals' brassy opener ""Look Out Young Son"" casts her as the ""bastard child"" of ""rough love and abandonment,"" and ""Bad, Bad Man"" is a lesson learned: another Little Red Riding Hood caveat against men who would ""lead you down temptation lane."" As might be expected, Gundred occasionally veers off course from simple to simplistic, relying on moon-spoon-June rhyme schemes and iffy attempts at social comment. The chorus of ""Nasty Habits"" tells us that they not only ""make us who we are,"" but also ""take us very far,"" and the more ham-handed, Hell-in-a-handbasket nihilism of ""Insane"" offers a take on this thing called ""reality television,"" which apparently isn't very ""realistic"" at all. Ultimately, however, it's not the lyrics that stop Humanimals from rising too far above pleasant pastiche. Much more is GOP's resistance to doing what it seems built for: revving up to an explosion. Gundred's singing voice has tons of energy, to be sure, but it needs to mature past the blues-rock mirror stage to push the band into its own space. Sennett does a fine job of reining in Labno and Krechnyak to give the songs a sense of space and liveness, but I found myself on more than one occasion waiting for a big pop that never comes. Like thousands of singers before her, Gundred tries to start some shit on ""Turn on, Burn on"", recommending, ""let's just start a fire."" Despite GOP's kinetic energy, however, Humanimals stays a collection of smoldering embers that never fully ignites.","This Yeah Yeah Yeahs-like San Diego trio has lately been turning heads, incuding those of Rilo Kiley's Blake Sennett (who produces this debut) and Coldplay/Interpol manager Dave Holmes (who issued it on his DH Records imprint).

Go Away White,Bauhaus,by: D. Shawn Bosler,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b56213d197565213ac64/1:1/w_160/b1441531.jpg,2008-03-26 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11333-go-away-white/,Cooking VinylBauhaus Music,"Don't freak, but the first thing that comes slithering out of the new Bauhaus record aren't ghoulish echoes from these goth godfather's past. Instead, on the album opener ""Too Much 21st Century"", a ""Taxman""-like bassline shepherds a procession of T. Rex guitars and lush Love & Rockets–styled backing vocals. And herein suggests some of the challenges faced when a band with such a singular voice like Bauhaus takes 25 years to write its fifth studio album. Especially considering the many career re-defining moments between the final chapter-- when in 1983 these legendary post-punks threw in the towel (the first time) and eventually formed the two less-goth and more commercially successful acts, Love & Rockets, and frontman Peter Murphy's solo work. A more recent epilogue-- a series of reunion tours-- eventually birthed this impressive and surprisingly true-to-form swan song. Yes, sadly, this is the final (!) slab from these insanely influential art rockers, who managed to wield epic, moody masterpieces from such unlikely materials as glam, dub, punk, and funk. After more than two decades painting (primarily) pop songs with a different pallet, when they reconvene as Bauhaus they can't seem to shake the shapes and sounds they developed decades ago-- even if they're still filtered through the work of Love & Rockets and Murphy solo. Tracks like the aforementioned opener, plus rockers ""Adrenalin"" and ""International Bulletproof Talent"", sound like the glam-side of Bauhaus-- complete with Murphy's Transylvanian Bowie vocals-- but re-worked with the Rockets' detached and breezy sensibility. Then there are tunes like ""Saved"", ""Zikir"", and ""Undone"" that feature a pronounced Murphy influence: synth-heavy Middle-Eastern–flirting drones and/or 80s-esque alterna-pop. Elsewhere, authentically retro numbers like ""Endless Summer of the Damned"" (an obvious shout out to goth nation) and ""Mirror Remains"" would've fit nicely either on The Sky's Gone Out or Burning From the Inside. The real gems here, however, are the tunes that point to what Bauhaus could've become had they continued this comeback for another album or two. Both ""Black Stone Heart"" and ""The Dog's a Vapour""-- the latter was actually recorded back in 1998 during their initial reunion shows and previously featured on the soundtrack for the animated film sequel Heavy Metal 2000-- wheeze with brooding atmospherics and shine with a playful sense of experimentation. ""Black Stone"" melds dark and dancey rhythms and Murphy's novel multi-personality melodramatics with hand claps, whistling, and stilted piano while ""Vapour"" creeps around in the fog slowly building into ominous guitar sirens. Bauhaus can hold their head high, mission accomplished; but with no victory-lap tour, no more studio albums, and several awesome new tunes pointing at an un-actualized future, it all feels rather anti-climatic and lacking closure. One more time: Bauhaus are dead. Undead, undead, undead.","Twenty-five years after they first disbanded, Bauhaus are again calling it a day-- but not before issuing an impressive and surprisingly true-to-form swan song.

13 Blues for Thirteen Moons,Thee Silver Mt. Zion Memorial Orchestra & Tra-La-La Band,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b561c0084474cd0c23f3/1:1/w_160/b5039cc1.jpg,2008-03-26 06:00:02,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11332-13-blues-for-thirteen-moons/,Constellation,"Godspeed You! Black Emperor spawned numerous post-rock imitators, most playing rock-infused chamber music and looking to bridge the gap between whispers and roars. This is old news, but the career of Thee Silver Mt. Zion Memorial Orchestra & Tra-La-La Band has been a crescendo itself. You can see it in the band's name, which began in 1999 as A Silver Mt. Zion, a trio comprised of Godspeed guitarist Efrim Menuck, violinist Sophie Trudeau, and bassist Thierry Amar (also of Godspeed). Over the course of several albums, ""Memorial Orchestra,"" ""Tra-La-La Band,"" ""with Choir,"" and an extra ""e"" were introduced, as the trio swelled to a septet with various auxiliary players. This increase in personnel was reflected in the band's music. Their debut, the serene He Has Left Us Alone But Shafts of Light Sometimes Grace the Corners of Our Rooms, was like Godspeed in miniature. Even on that album, vocals were featured prominently, which they rarely were in Godspeed. Their second album, Born Into Trouble as the Sparks Fly Upward, was still dominated by blustery strings, but Menuck's tomcat yowl and the flashes of rock were more pronounced. By this point, the band's anarchist bent was made clear in their terrorist-letter liner notes and the theory they cited, although their music still sounded more like an uneasy slumber than a violent insurrection. Then Silver Mt. Zion made a definitive break with their origins and transformed into a band almost completely distinct from the one that made Shafts of Light. ""This Is Our Punk-Rock,"" Thee Rusted Satellites Gather + Sing featured heavy rock drums and even more of Menuck's elongated, off-key moaning. The albums featuring the ""choir"" had a whole host of Menuck-alikes caterwauling away, and by 2005's Horses in the Sky, Silver Mt. Zion sounded more like an experimental rock band with strings than anything post-rock. New album 13 Blues for Thirteen Moons is the weakest entry to date in Silver Mt. Zion's catalog. It gets off on the wrong foot with a conceit that seems pointless at best: Twelve tracks, each just a few seconds long, of high-pitched, modulating drones. Why? Maybe it was conceptually important to the band that the album begin on track 13, but there's nothing to suggest it should be important to anyone else. Of course, these drones would be inconsequential if they were a prelude to inspiring music, but their mysteriousness is the most interesting aspect of the record. Here, strings have moved into the background and guitars into the foreground of Silver Mt. Zion's music, inverting their original template. They no longer erect shimmering palaces in the distance, preferring instead to drop the great marble slabs directly on our heads, over and over again. The song's artillery drums and napalm riffs sound exciting on paper, and there are indeed a few thrilling moments (swoony trumpets!), but the turgid arrangements, which lack enough content to justify their length (each is around a quarter-hour), reduce them to isolated moments that don't feel hard-earned when they arrive. ""1,000,000 Died to Make this Sound"" begins and ends as a post-apocalyptic chorale, and while the moment when the bludgeoning riff that dominates its middle section roars to life is tingly, the feeling soon becomes a dull ache. The title track is more dynamically arranged, with swells of battery-acid guitar, but its rippling pattern makes it feel preordained, like Explosions in the Sky gone psych-rock. Nevertheless, the final movement, where Menuck's voice is chopped hard across stereo channels (lending it a rhythmic force it often lacks) is the album's most credible climax. The last two tracks are better: ""Black Waters Blowed/Engine Broke Blues"" makes room for gusty organ-and-string dirges amid the brambly rock, enhancing its contrast, and ""Blindblindblind"", with its gradual increase in wattage, exemplifies the kind of nuanced upsweep that most of the album unfortunately sacrifices. Righteous anger is the emotion that dominates 13 Blues for Thirteen Moons, leaving its listeners feeling rather scolded. When Menuck sings, ""One million died to make this sound,"" you get the impression that the romance of disaffection might be dearer to him than the social reforms that would mitigate it. When he sings about ""your band's bland ambition,"" you have to wonder if his self-regard has completed a crescendo of its own, one disproportionate to the actual political efficacy of his-- or anyone's-- music. Overall, it's this sense of forced importance that makes the album no fun: You feel like it's meant to do something to you, not for you. I don't know about you, but I've got more than enough tyrants and oligarchs talking down to me already, without getting browbeaten by anarchists, too.","After multiple records-- and seemingly more name changes-- the latest Silver Mt. Zion release finds the strings finally moved into the background with guitars located in the foreground, inverting the group's original template.

The Odd Couple,Gnarls Barkley,by: Nitsuh Abebe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b55c5e6ef95969322761/1:1/w_160/0406d68c.jpg,2008-03-26 06:00:01,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11328-the-odd-couple/,AtlanticDowntown,"Since Gnarls Barkley jumped into everyone's consciousness on the back of a single called ""Crazy"", would you forgive me the groaning joke if I said their follow-up sounded a little like someone prescribed mood stabilizers? That's the gripe you'll probably hear from most people: The Odd Couple is flatter, in both directions. The joy of this duo's debut was a kind of erratic, anything-goes lightning-bottling; its chintzy, slapdash qualities were more than made up for by the number of bottles containing honest-to-god scraps of actual lightning. Hit the big time on the strength of one of those, though, and the world has big-time demands. It was inevitable that these two would have to fight past their idiosyncrasies (producer Danger Mouse's short attention span, singer Cee-Lo's ease with throwing vocals together on the fly) and deliver something more focused, something that doesn't require so much sorting through. They've done that, to an extent-- not by any huge, transformative leap, but a little. And much like your average SSRI, it means less of the unpredictable magic and the sideways song-notions that sold the first album. It'd be cruel and point-missing to pick on them for this-- as cruel as it'd be to tell your friends they're more ""fun"" when they're off their meds. More importantly, there are times, as DM's beats trail by in their muddy, tasteful way, where Cee-Lo sets to work developing something terrific, even if it's not the shiny pop thrill a lot of fans might want. What Cee-Lo seems to be after is a kind of restrained, gut-searching soul music, packed with even more self-doubt and self-laceration than the first record. Get over the lack of colorful pop baubles, and you'll notice that the best work here comes in the form of low-key cuts about isolation and uncertainty, like ""Who's Gonna Save My Soul"". Oddly enough, that means this album will be a grower-- dead opposite the flash and fade of that debut. Danger Mouse, meanwhile, is tackling a different set of challenges. Somewhere between Outkast's ""Hey Ya"" and this group's ""Crazy"", the formula for success with this stuff became clear: Make hip-hop-styled music based around the sound of the 1960s-- the old soul music that's a common ancestor to nearly everything going today-- and you'll bring in fans from every direction. DM's taken that to heart here, and he keeps his beats warm and organic, with none of the futurism that came through on St. Elsewhere, and plenty of straight-up 60s grooves: ""Surprise"" drops in a vocal harmony that may well be sampled from the 5th Dimension, ""Going On"" works its organ and hand-claps, and ""Charity Case"" even has Cee-Lo recreating the ooh-aah backing vocals from Sam Cooke's ""Chain Gang"". Where the last album covered a 60s-styled track from the Violent Femmes, this one has Gnarls writing what might as well be one-- a great bratty thing called ""Whatever"", filled with half-mocking sympathy for the teenage loser pining for girls and yelling at his mom. But it's not always in the way you'd think; most of DM's warm, organic vibes here are dark, slow-creeping, blunted, psychedelic ones, and they don't stop him from trending left-field. (The shaky syncopations and grotty sound of ""Open Book"" could have come straight from Tricky.) In the end, that leaves the bouncy pop tracks here seeming like the odd ones out: This album might be more focused than its predecessor, but what it's focused on is a the kind of murky, paranoid weight and depth that doesn't much make for chart-climbing singles. Gnarls Barkley's combination-- an r&b singer and an ""underground"" hip-hop producer (roughly)-- isn't so much of a novelty these days; it's essentially the same thing you'd get from Erykah Badu's newest album, a pretty apt peer for The Odd Couple. Listen to this album in that context, and you'll be a lot more likely to hear the progress they're making. The next pressing question, besides what we can do to help Cee-Lo cheer up, is this: If this is the album where we watch patiently as this duo develops its third dimension, what are the chances that these two guys-- who, unlike the average rock band, have plenty of other projects they could be off working on-- stick around to show us what their ""maturity"" might look like?","More focused than its well-liked predecessor, the second album from Cee-Lo and Danger Mouse is a less pop affair full of dark organic vibes.

Phylactery Factory,White Hinterland,by: Stephen M.

The song begins as a breezy ditty, with a girl, Dienel's narrator, carving her lover's name into the trunk of a cypress. He leaves for war and, of course, doesn't return, inspiring the townsfolk to tie yellow ribbons around every tree in the typical patriotic memorial. Seeing this marker over his name, Dienel sings, ""I rip that ribbon off the tree, burn it down by the river that now shares your name."" It's a startling, simple, and poetically defiant act, neatly and decisively wiping away the politics and statistics to find the human being. ""No one wants to believe you died in vain,"" Dienel concludes, as her piano returns to that original breezy theme: There is a bittersweet freedom, she discovers, in accepting the meaninglessness of the tragedy. Phylactery Factory is Dienel's follow-up to her 2006 debut, The Wind-Up Canary, a loose collection of quirky pop songs delivered with a light touch-- always an underrated quality. Since then, she has signed to a new label, adopted a new stage name (but why not something that doesn't sound like a death metal band?), and assembled an impressive backing band that features Laura Gibson and members of Norfolk & Western. Nevertheless, White Hinterland remains essentially a solo project that showcases Dienel's songwriting and vocals, and Phylactery Factory is a more ambitious, more professional, and more complicated record than its predecessor, with dark jazz-pop flourishes and compositions heavy with words. It is, however, not quite as rewarding. After the seven-minute ""Hometown Hooray"", which is heartbreaking despite her self-consciously Homeric affectations, comes ""Lindberghs + Metal Birds"", with its bouncing bassline from the Village Green's Dave Depper and an energetic performance from Dienel. It's a perfectly acceptable, if somewhat self-satisfied, anti-military/industrial/what-have-you anthem, but on Phylactery Factory it completely ruins the solemn tone of the song that came before. More than a mistake of sequencing, this abrupt transition reveals Dienel's divided interests with this new project. She has one foot in the real world, with its insoluble tragedies, and the other foot in her own private imaginarium, with its eccentric wordplay and clever anachronisms. Given that a whole arm of indie pop seems devoted to storybook lyricism, this could be an intriguing stance, but Dienel's mix of willed naïvete and kneejerk cynicism creates some jarring shifts on Phylactery Factory, muddying instead of illuminating her songs. Occasionally, but not often enough, the force of the music compensates. ""Napoleon at Waterloo"", the album's most uptempo song, rounds out the wartime trilogy, disconnected from the present but still worth it for its spiraling momentum and Dienel's spirited, even angry repetition of ""There goes another man down."" Likewise, ""Dreaming of the Plum Trees"", about vast class discrepancies, alludes slyly to Suzanne Vega's ""Luka"" and Paul Simon's ""Me & Julio Down by the Schoolyard"". But mostly, her wordy compositions make for dense, leaden songs like opener ""The Destruction of the Art Deco House"" and ""Hung on a Thin Thread"", which move slowly and sometimes not at all. Ultimately, what was intended as an ambitious artistic leap forward feels more like a slight step to the side.","Casey Dienel follows her 2006 turn at eccentric piano-pop, Wind-Up Canary, with a change in moniker (White Hinterland, duh) and label (from Hush to Dead Oceans), plus a new backing band that features Laura Gibson and members of Norfolk & Western.

Magnificent Fiend,Howlin Rain,by: Andrew Gaerig,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b53fea9e61561daa6da2/1:1/w_160/d51219bf.jpg,2008-03-25 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11304-magnificent-fiend/,BirdmanAmerican,"Howlin Rain, the side project of Comets on Fire frontman Ethan Miller, are often posited as a blend of Comets' psychedelic rock and the more traditional AOR sounds of late 60s/early 70s hard blues acts. It's a bit of a mischaracterization even when you account for the fact that the last Comets record, Avatar, made such strident moves toward that same mix that Howlin Rain became all but superfluous. The issue, more so, is that on their second album, Magnificent Fiend, Howlin Rain make absolutely no attempt to incorporate Miller's sturdy noise background into their tracks, unless you count mixing the organ so high that the songs take on a hallucinatory vibe that was not, in all likelihood, intentional. Instead, the aim was admittedly to complicate Miller's songwriting via layers of classic rock filament. What's left is an album heavy on signifiers, even in comparison with Howlin Rain's eponymous 2006 debut. Howlin Rain are from San Francisco and have some beards so they'll be compared to The Grateful Dead; Howlin Rain are from California and most of their songs have thick, muddy grooves so they will be compared to Creedence Clearwater Revival. But in terms of both sound and execution Howlin Rain share more with, say, the Faces, at least in so much as Miller, like Rod Stewart, is less interested in crafting perfect melodies as he is in doing some hollerin' and yellerin' on the same stage as four or five of his boys, one of whom goes sort of nuts on an organ. Ethan Miller doesn't have Stewart's hilarious foxiness; hell, he may not even have the panache and flair of 2006 Ethan Miller-- something ""Calling Lightning Pt. 2"" goes (literally) lengths to illustrate. ""Calling Lightning with a Scythe"" was the finest, Dead-iest track on the band's debut, featuring a mélange of strummed acoustics, banjo, and wonderfully confused electric gnashing. Miller reached for his sweetest, stoned-est falsetto and shyly navigated his way through the band's bushy terrain. A side-by-side comparison of ""Calling Lightning"" and ""Pt. 2"" highlights most of Magnificent Fiend's shortcomings: the latter is obnoxiously full of big, beefy rock sounds-- tube amps, Hammond organs, a Rhodes piano solo-- so familiar that they are nearly impossible to differentiate. Miller drones about ""distant youth"" and being a ""hard-workin' stiff."" Something about the ""Golden Age."" Call it a period piece if you must, but Magnificent Fiend doesn't hold up there, either: ""Lord Have Mercy"" might've been a higher fidelity cousin to Built to Spill's spectacularly referential ""You Were Right""-- ""That was the dawning of the age…"", ""Down by the river,"" etc.-- but it's telling that Miller manages to sink a song already leaning on homage with cliché: his churchy choruses have enough ""Mama have mercy on my soul""'s to stuff even the campiest appetites. It's not until Magnificent Fiend's closing trio of seven-minute behemoths that Howlin Rain find traction, though it's the band's willingness to tweak its grand appropriations, rather than the tracks' epic lengths, that helps the songs stick. ""El Rey"" finds Miller, for the first time, curling his voice around a chorus before attacking it, and the brass that backs him contributes in making it the most sprightly and limber track on Magnificent Fiend. ""Goodbye Ruby"" succumbs to funk in a way that allows Joel Robinow's organ to bounce instead of splat. ""Riverboat"" succeeds further, building towards a sweetened piano coda with-- surprise!-- a hearty, cheesy synth that aims, if not for ELO, at least for Yes. These triumphs, however, don't overpower the album's tepid overflow. Of all the rock stereotypes adopted, the one that ultimately damns Howlin Rain is extra-musical: a big, technically skilled band with good vibes but nowhere to go.","The side project of Comets on Fire frontman Ethan Miller again blends psychedelic rock with the more traditional AOR sounds of late 60s/early 70s hard blues acts.

Yet his most enduring legacy isn't the corpse of Euronymous, his band mate in Mayhem, whom he stabbed to death; nor the ashes of the Norwegian churches he was convicted of torching; nor his rambling writings on race and nationalism that have led weaker minds to tie Nazism to black metal. Vikernes will live on longest with Burzum, his one-man band that redefined black metal's parameters. Burzum made black metal an open system. No longer was the music just a blastbeat-driven blur. Burzum slowed it down, bent it into strange angles, and pushed and pulled them into long, exploratory tracks. Denied a guitar while incarcerated, Vikernes turned Burzum towards keyboard-based ambience with wispy, faux-classical melodies. The astral synths of ""Rundtgåing Av Den Transcendentale Egenbetens Støtte"", from 1996's Filosofem, could have been on Warp. Freed from strictures like bandmates and song structures, lone wolves the world over have explored Burzum's template. To name but a few-- Leviathan, Krohm (USA), Nortt (Denmark), Hypothermia (Sweden), Elysian Blaze (Australia), and Taarma (Afghanistan). (Ironically, the most prominent of Burzum's progeny, Xasthur, has developed such a defined sound that it's become a closed system.) Buffalo, New York's Wrath of the Weak is a worthy, if unlikely, addition to Burzum's brood. The few pictures that exist of ""Jordan,"" the band's mastermind, are startling-- a kid with glasses and a baseball cap, jeans, and sneakers. He should be strumming in coffeehouses, not unleashing feedback-soaked dirges that update Creation Records with corpse paint. Much has been made of black metal's connection to shoegaze. Both prize texture over definition, and transcendence through fuzz. While Enslaved occasionally evoke a ballsier Swervedriver, Wrath of the Weak pins that band's abstract emotion in the red. Alogon chains together digital distortion into scathing sheets of sound, recalling early Jesus and Mary Chain. The core sound is thin, but multiplied in layers of noise and harmonics, it becomes torrential. Yet the muck is surprisingly easy to penetrate. The chords are hardly metallic in the conventional sense. No macho machine-gun riffs here, just smears of melancholy. This record armors a very vulnerable center. The vocals hide behind distortion and reduce to strangled cries in the distance. Like with My Bloody Valentine, they're simply another texture. However, they're so sparse that the record is essentially instrumental. In their fearsome fragility, the guitars go far, becoming hypnotic through repetition. After too long, though, they become repetitious. More, and stronger, vocals might help. Unlike Xasthur, who's mired in a self-created miasma, Wrath of the Weak might have something to say. But even Burzum was a perpetual work-in-progress, and not all brilliant. That happens when one breaks old rules to make new ones. Alogon's greatest misstep is its most blatant Burzum worship: a 21-minute ambient snoozefest. Otherwise, it's a diamond in the rough. Its obscuring is sublime; its unveiling might be more so.","Chaining digital distortion to scathing sheets of sound, this one-man black metal band from Buffalo brings to mind shoegaze while also worshiping at the altar of Burzum.

You Have No Idea What You Are Getting Yourself Into,"Does It Offend You, Yeah?",by: Tom Ewing,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b52eea9e61561daa6d83/1:1/w_160/2714b14c.jpg,2008-03-25 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11291-you-have-no-idea-what-you-are-getting-yourself-into/,VirginAlmost Gold,"Does It Offend You, Yeah? are a hard band to warm to. There's the name, for one thing: a question whose only tempting reply is an exaggerated shrug. But at least ask yourself what kind of sonics might fit that name. Howling batteries of unreconstructed noise? Try again. High-strung mall-emo with serious entitlement issues? If only. Barely adequate dance-rock to keep you occupied until the next Klaxons record? Now we're talking! As this album trundles on, its title turns unpleasantly sarcastic. Any one of these tracks will give you a very strong idea what you've gotten yourself into, and that'll be the only strong idea you meet. Does It Offend You, Yeah? play doggedly ugly, riff-driven electro. Their harsh, crunching keyboards might sound raw and immediate, if it wasn't for the way the hooks slide out your brain so fast. Their ranting vocals might seem confrontational, but they're autotuned so often they feel diffident and defensive. Their beats might be so propulsive as to make all that irrelevant-- except all the band's rhythmic ideas are stuck a decade ago, like they've bought up some old Chemical Brothers kit on eBay and haven't read the manual yet. So this record's creative and artistic value is pretty much nil-- in fact it only just hits competent. But that's OK-- I don't get the feeling the band are shooting for ""art"" anyway, and competent music can still be functional music: a good accompaniment to more exciting activities. Does It Offend You, Yeah? have already licensed songs to the FIFA Street 3 game, for instance: I can imagine the yelpy ""Battle Royale"" sounding fine if half-heard while doing digital ball-juggling. Other songs will also have their uses. It's probably a bit stale for advertising, but the tolerably aggressive ""We Are Rockstars"" might work over a montage of camphone footage in a sales presentation. Partygoers throughout 2008 may wake up grateful the band wrote a song called ""Let's Make Out"" so they could burp the title into someone's ear. The best track, which for two minutes does recapture Klaxons' playful frenzy, could be great on a sweaty college dancefloor. It is still called ""Attack of the 60 Ft Lesbian Octopus"", but you have to start somewhere. The closing songs do find the group stretching themselves a little more-- ""Epic Last Song"" and ""Being Bad Feels Pretty Good"" lose the electro-vox and go for something a little slower and a lot more pained. To no great surprise, when they drop the nu-rave trappings the band fit perfectly into a long-shuffling queue of British plod-rock, somewhere between Shed Seven and Gay Dad. But the thing about offending people is that you can nearly always find someone to take the bait. In the band's own world, Does It Offend You, Yeah? are electro punks with nostalgia in their sights: They talk in interviews about how old-school ravers are disgusted by their rock sounds and instrument-smashing stageplay. I suppose it's possible-- maybe they're just rightly pissed at the band's tired ideas and terminal complacency.","Not even sure where to start with this one.

Trouble in Dreams,Destroyer,by: William Bowers,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b55b13d197565213ac58/1:1/w_160/1b1a963b.jpg,2008-03-25 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11327-trouble-in-dreams/,Merge,"Trouble in Dreams is a rad party to which actual people aren't invited, because it admittedly exists to lure muses (at least seven are named) out of Dan Bejar's imagination and into his bedroom: ""A chorus is a thing that bears repeating/ And the problem, as I see it, is girls stay away from that shit."" He yelps that bit here on a, um, repeat performance of a track from the Swan Lake album, which you will remember, because the next line is, ""Saw you in Swan Lake."" The vibe of this moment hews close to the one conveyed by Destroyer labelmate, hero, and fellow English-accent-faker Robert Pollard on Guided By Voices' ""The Official Ironmen Rally Song"" back in 1996: ""Crawling people on your knees/ Don't take this so seriously/ You just have to hum it all day long."" (Except, well, Bejar even hums seriously.) In 1996, GBV were where Destroyer is today: facing a not-quite-backlash because the act's longevity had begun to work against the initial reasons for fan excitement-- what were once singular eccentricities now have become anticipatable. Through some kind of consumer transference, the audience, having seen the magician do its favorite trick so many times, convinces itself that it has actually gone backstage. That most Destroyer listeners could likely pen and perform a decent Destroyer spoof is the reason some now (via projection) accuse Bejar of parodying himself, just as folks used to act like they had Pollard's genius ""figured out"" because they could joke, ""Alright kids, this one's called 'Logo Manchild Umbrage Saloon' off our new EP, Sanguine Flake Emperor! One, two, three, four--"" Mockery usually lacks its target's magic, though, and Bejar is pretty much an untouchable wizard. Trouble in Dreams succeeds despite itself, despite contemporary tastes, and despite the cynicism its grandiosity triggers in us breathing, farting pedestrian mortals. Anyway, one can't be embarrassed for Bejar re: this album's hyperdramatic wince-worthy turns-- or an uptick in his nonsense-syllable scatting thing-- because he clearly does not care what we ""think."" He's so dedicated to his unbearable fringes that he sells them-- like the kid from junior high so unconcerned with cool that he had to settle for being totally fucking awesome. Not that Destroyer doesn't try to have it both ways: The risky, invested intensity of the delivery, leavened with the detachment of it not being so gauche as to specifically mean anything. What a performance the whole album is*.* The vocal inflections, the real words, the nonwords, the handclaps, the whistling, the guitars, keys, drums, tempos, and spaces combine to create not so much a sound as a (gulp) spirit. Spirit is another word, of course, for alcoholic beverage, and Trouble in Dreams is shitfaced, from the leery cover's stash of bottles to the wine, sherry, drugs, drunkenness, and high-ness referenced inside. For all the music's deliberate flailing, the speaker lacks agency-- he wanders around not knowing what time it is (""Foam Hands"") in disbelief at decibel levels (""Plaza Trinidad""). The most rousing, antic, and fun number, ""Dark Leaves Form a Thread"", is about terror, depression, abandonment, and waitress fatigue. The closing track, a coherent (for Destroyer) character study about the ominous redemption of a ""wasted"" ""boozing"" woman who's ""been fucking around,"" suggests a Bejar strutting and fretting his way onto the Hold Steady's stage. Revisitations abound. In addition to the Swan Lake do-over, a verse from a song Bejar did to accompany a 2005 children's book pops up in a decidedly adult context. The guitars continue Destroyer's blend of geek-rock and classic rock, ranging in the same tune from stately to anti-subtle, like an XTC Skynyrd with pinches of Marr and Malkmus sautéed in Beatles and Bowie. The hotfoot confidence of a certain recent celebrated Destroyer album gets paired with the disheveled sprawl of another-- if only Pitchfork would pay me for a three-word review, I could have just typed: This Night's Rubies. Which is to say that Trouble in Dreams offers all the hookiness of pop with none of the concision. For a recombinatory effort, though, some elements are missing. TID might be Bejar's most pompous, profane, and pastoral record, but it's also his least ""intelligent,"" rational, or linearly clever. Bejar denies fans old modes of dorksport: I caught only one pun, two snippets of others' famous lyrics, and two references to other bands. Plus ""Introducing Angels"" just sounds like Air Supply. And part of me buys the argument that this is the rock equivalent of Mars Attacks, going through the motions of creating a blockbuster without allowing the audience a legitimate ""in."" At first listen, the album seemed long because something was running a little lean. I thought I'd gone from the enjoyable thrill of wondering what Bejar was talking about to the jaded position of not caring. But after multiple spins, I'm confusingly seduced by the vermouth-versus-absinthe reverie of its arrangements, pronouncements, and elliptical solos. Here's a guy fussily throwing his whole soul into his camouflage.","By now, Dan Bejar's signature eccentricities have grown predictable, but they're still no less risky, and Trouble in Dreams succeeds despite both itself and contemporary notions of taste.

Golden Delicious,Mike Doughty,by: Ben Westhoff,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b4eab1335d7bf169a808/1:1/w_160/a07bc859.jpg,2008-03-24 06:00:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11230-golden-delicious/,ATO,"Mike Doughty, formerly M. Doughty, not to be confused with American Idol's Daughtry, was once my idol, playing music with Soul Coughing that was as similar to rap as could be expected from a white Army brat, and writing for the New York Press. Fortunately I never lived up to my dream of being him, because then I'd have to be signed to Dave Matthew's ATO Records and probably practicing Matthews' lines with him for the next time he's on House. One tries not to judge Doughty by the company he keeps, of course, and though his singing is sometimes compared to Matthews', their voices are actually quite distinct. Matthews' sounds like roofies, while Doughty's just wants to invite you up for a couple beers and get to know you. (He understands that no means no.) Moving on: Golden Delicious's first two tracks are among the best I've heard from him. Both borrow ditties from outside sources, ""Fort Hood"" from Hair's ""The Flesh Failures (Let The Sunshine In),"" and ""I Just Want the Girl in the Blue Dress to Keep on Dancing"" from ""The Little Drummer Boy""'s ""ba-rum-ba-bum-bum""-type thing. Hell, the third track, ""Put It Down,"" is full of nonsensical, recycled-feeling sing-along tidbits (""put it downtown, put it down, down"" ""let it go go, let it go go,"" ""drop it in the mail, drop it in the sauce, bottle up the sauce"") and it's good, too. Doughty's former hip-hop mentality is probably what allows him to engage in this free-association, homage/rip-off technique, and there's no reason why more earnest singer-songwriters shouldn't adopt pastiche approaches. Things are actually tighter here musically than his last album, Haughty Melodic, which this website complained was ""full of jam-band percussion, vanilla-funk basslines, and the occasional strings and horns, played with an affected worldliness."" It surely helps that ever-unpretentious producer and Semisonic alum Dan Wilson-- who also produced Haughty and won a Grammy with the Dixie Chicks-- has had three years to step his game up. Production-wise, Golden Delicious splits the difference between Haughty and Free Life, Wilson's solo debut from last year which strayed far too close to the adult contemporary flame. Only 37 minutes long and mostly recorded live, Golden Delicious has crowd-pleasing on its mind, so much that it even features ""The Final Countdown""-style solos from keyboardist John Kirby. Doughty's solo career trajectory is clearly headed skyward since the days of his first two solo works, * Skittish* and Rockity Roll, fairly granola affairs both. Why, then, have the powers-that-be (Matthews?) chosen a Rockity Roll outtake as Golden Delicious' first single, the boring ""27 Jennifers""? It sounds just like the old version, which was no fun to begin with. (Perhaps it has some sort of subliminal commercial appeal I can't hear. A young Texas girl in hot pants has a YouTube video of herself vamping to it, after all.) But ""27 Jennifers"" isn't the worst song on the album -- that would be ""More Bacon Than the Pan Can Handle,"" a self-consciously weird clunker which retreats from the album's ""hum first, think later"" ethos. The ship is righted by the efficient, na-na-na-y ""I Wrote a Song About Your Car"", but riffing and borrowing aren't going to work for him forever, just as Soul Coughing's (I almost said Soul Asylum's) beat-poetry and upright-bass oeuvre sounds ridiculously dated nowadays. Eventually Doughty is going to have to do something about his lyrics, because ""The moonlight shines like a luminous girl tonight/ Yeah, Jesus Christ like a luminous girl tonight"" isn't going to hack it. My advice: stick with Wilson, but hire Pharoahe Monch to ghostwrite.","The former Soul Coughing frontman with a flair for nonsensical sing-along tidbits returns with another solo album for Dave Matthews' ATO imprint.

UnonoU,Danava,by: Robbie Mackey,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b4f39d034d5c69bf4f45/1:1/w_160/6f04bcc7.jpg,2008-03-24 06:00:04,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11238-unonou/,Kemado,"Because they're on Kemado-- or, rather, because Kemado is forever linked to the Invaders comp that crystallized the hipster metal thing in 2006-- it's tough to talk about Danava without tossing around comparisons to the Swords and Saviours of the world. Certainly, there was enough Blue Cheer riffing and 1960s gloom on the band's self-titled debut to cast them as convincing nu-stoner attachés. But when their beefier brethren straight-copped Tony Iommi doom and dingy Horsemen thrash, these Portland space cadets were accentuating druggy astro-rock with slightly more obscure cues. Think Hawkwind instead of High on Fire, Magma rather than Maiden. But the wire-crossing of prog, glam, and academic metal only worked in spells in '06. They peaked early on the UFO dragstrip ride of Invaders stand-out ""By the Mark"", but Danava never really found a comfortable or convincing step afterwards. No-frills freakouts seemed a bit too dead-eyed, the big art-psych foibles seemed unsure, and the in-betweens didn't really exist. On UnonoU, the focus has rightly shifted to the idiosyncrasies and outliers that made them special (and occasionally gave them trouble) last go-round. Naturally, guitars are still doing most of the heavy lifting. ""Spinning Temple Shifting"" is probably as snarling as Danava will ever be, and for a four-minute stretch it nearly rivals the Pentatonic calisthenics of solo-kings Earthless. And despite its somewhat cheesy boogie, ""A High or a Low"" is the best T. Rex these dudes have ever attempted-- believe, they've tried their hand a couple times. But singer Dusty Sparkles and one-namer Rockwell's synth work is the real treat throughout, turning ""way too long"" into ""rewardingly ornate"" on tracks like the symphonic Atari grinder ""The Emerald Snow of Sleep"". Seriously, without the alien tones and War Games final third of ""Where Beauty and Terror Dance"", the album's Reaper-fearing lead single is little more than a three minute guitar somersault with a decent rhythm section shuffle. As it stands, its laser-light coda is one of the record's finest moments. Elsewhere, just when the eight-minute-plus sprawler ""Down From a Cloud, Up From The Ground"" is about to over-stay its welcome, a giant swatch of synth turns things downright operatic, casting Sparkles' boney, revered voice in the most flattering, spaced-out light it's ever seen. Scattered throughout UnonoU, and rarely birthed by six-string rumble, these grandiose moments showcase a band able to do much more with heavy armor than recite Sabbath scripts. Indeed, while not yet fully formed, Danava's voice has grown surprisingly unique on the band's second outing.","Kemado band rightly shifts its focus to the idiosyncrasies and outliers that in the past have helped it stand out when compared to its hipster-metal peers.

Sixes & Sevens,Adam Green,by: Rebecca Raber,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b5405e6ef95969322738/1:1/w_160/d2119284.jpg,2008-03-24 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11305-sixes-sevens/,Rough Trade,"Thanks to a former stripper's little movie about a pregnant teen, the Moldy Peaches can now count Whoopi Goldberg and my 57-year-old mother amongst their fans. That's great news for erstwhile Peach Adam Green, who, with his fifth solo album, has finally created a collection that's ready for mass-consumption. The prolific, potty-mouthed former anti-folkie was an acquired taste back when he was singing naughty throwaways like, ""Choke on a Cock"", but following in the footsteps of Jacket Full of Danger's pretty (if slightly corny) soft-rockers, he offers more palatable, grown-up fare on Sixes & Sevens. Green has long possessed a mature voice-even in his faux-naif, Robin-Hood-costume days, his resonant baritone was startlingly emotive-and, finally, his songs are worthy of his warm, velvety delivery. ""Getting Led"", for example, bolsters his buttery tones with the sweet levity of a gospel choir, showing off a developed croon that's as richly colored and evocative as Elvis'. Thanks to legendary arranger David Campbell-- he's worked with fellow lounge-loving singer, Beck-- Green's often squirrelly songs are now filled out by swooning orchestrations of wistful pedal steel, soaring strings, and (as on ""You Get So Lucky"", his dusty, pan-Latin homage to Simon And Garfunkel's ""El Condor Pasa"") even some wily pan pipes. And though on previous albums, Green's ornate orchestrations often read as winking hipster re-imaginings of schmaltzy easy listening, the 70s radio that he and Campbell evoke here has a playlist that's part 60s hangover (wall-of-sound album opener ""Festival Song""), part swaggering disco-funk (""Tweet Tweet Dee""), and part sax-fueled Bowie ""plastic soul"" (""Morning After Midnight""). Straddling a precarious line between ""classic"" and ""cheesy,"" Green sounds most assured and comfortable against those sorts of vintage arrangements. But listeners looking for lyrical meaning will still be disappointed, searching in vain for hidden significance in these nonsensical love song lines. (Though Green insists his prose isn't the product of any cut-and-paste or stream-of-consciousness method, with lines like, ""I finally grew a leg in Thailand/Marauding on a typhus flu,"" they might as well be.) A word of advice: It's best to just accept his words as conduits for his dreamy voice, and give in to his charming tunes. The best ones-- like ""Tropical Island"" (which is, strangely, about smoggy Los Angeles) and ""Be My Man"", an acoustic country-folk riff on ""Sweet Jane""-- are built on such appealing pop melodies that their lyrics feel unimportant anyway. They aren't all winners though. ""That Sounds Like a Pony"" features the kind of rhythm-driven, unfunny ""rapping"" that the Peaches did back in the day on ""D.2 Boyfriend"", and the gimmick was already moldy then. And the vaudevillian Leon Redbone paean ""Grandma Shirley And Papa"" feels like a half-hearted genre exercise in the company of the album's more straightforwardly pretty songs. But in an era where a 10-song record is basically one or two iTunes-ready singles cushioned by some extraneous fat, this ambitious 20-song opus is, percentage-wise, a success. Reinvention isn't easy, especially when your past work is newly popular. But Adam Green has managed it, embracing sincerity and musical extravagance in a way that ""Anyone Else But You"" never intimated was possible. Whoopi and my mom will be pleased.","The other former Moldy Peach retuns for his first post-Juno record.

Retribution Gospel Choir,Retribution Gospel Choir,by: Mike McGonigal,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b55013d197565213ac42/1:1/w_160/577b2812.jpg,2008-03-24 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11317-retribution-gospel-choir/,Caldo Verde,"Who knew it would be such a pleasure to hear Alan Sparhawk-- master of minimalist pop-- rock out with his cock out? Sure, the last two Low albums had downright loud moments, and there's that bluesy side project the Black Eyed Snakes that Sparhawk had a few years back. But on the Retribution Gospel Choir album, the dude channels his inner Crazy Horse with dark dirge-y anthems. He even curses and stuff! It's taken Retribution a few years to make a full-length; the group's been around since 2005 and have released two tour EPs. Eric Pollard plays drums and new guy (in this band as well as Low) Matt Livingston plays bass, while Sparhawk plays guitar and sings, and he wrote the songs, too. Three aspects of the group's live shows and EPs are missing on their debut. First and foremost, there's singer-songwriter Mark Kozelek, who did produce the record, and it's on his label. But Kozelek was once a member of the band, and his guitar playing is missed (as are a few songs they played with him, notably the great ""Hatchet""). Not missed so much are the group's penchant for cool covers (though two songs-- ""Breaker"" and ""Take Your Time""-- could be called self-covers, as they have already appeared on the last Low record). Sure their live take on ""Sandinista"" is great, but the covers felt like concert or B-side material, so it's good that they realized that. Finally, the group's experimental and dubby aspects are relegated to subtle sound effect elements. That's made the album more cohesive but less diverse than their music is live. Sparhawk knows how to wring emotional depth out of the most tired lyrical clichés, and he's clearly dissected rock dynamics to the point that when he does them ""straight"" it's either boring (as on ""They Knew You Well"") or something to behold (""Easy Prey"", ""Somebody's Someone""). Songs like ""Holes in Our Heads"" and ""Take Your Time"" are dynamic in a loud/louder/soft/loudest way that works well in service of decent songs and melodies. (By now, Mogwai and Sigur Rós devotees have copied those tricks to death-- contemporary math rock is so simple it may as well be called subtraction rock.) Entire swaths of the Retribution Gospel Choir album are reminiscent of the slash-and-burn imitation classic rock found on the Bush League All Stars' 1995 Pop Narcotic album Old Numbers (albeit with odder tunings). At the time, that fine album sank like a stone in the indie music scene; RGC arrives after a decade's worth of stoner metal has convinced kids it's OK to enjoy back-to-basics riff-heavy rock'n'roll-- even without the irony that was so heavily drizzled atop 80s and 90s revisionings of 70s conventions. To address the album on 70s turf, Retribution Gospel Choir may not be as great as a Neil Young with Crazy Horse album, but it's better than any of the albums Crazy Horse made on their own.","After two EPs, Low's Alan Sparhawk and his fellow Choir members finally release their debut LP.

"Signals, Calls, and Marches / Vs. / The Horrible Truth About Burma",Mission of Burma,by: Marc Masters,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b54813d197565213ac33/1:1/w_160/3ae4ed56.jpg,2008-03-24 06:00:00,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11662-signals-calls-and-marchesvsthe-horrible-truth-about-burma/,MatadorAce of HeartsMatadorAce of Hearts,"The history of post-punk has been written in many different ways, but in most versions, the question of where Mission of Burma fits in is a puzzler. Which is as it should be, because their music, a singular mix of complexity and immediacy, deserves its own notch on any post-punk measuring stick. Though popular in their hometown of Boston, they weren't really part of a scene. And though their early 1980s music overlapped with the bass-driven post-punk of Joy Division and PiL, the heroic hardcore of Black Flag and Hüsker Dü, and even the contrarianism of New York No Wave, it mostly sounded like nothing else. Twenty-five years later, Mission of Burma's fusion of brainy experiments and anthemic rock remains unique. That's due in part to how unique the recordings actually were. Where most indie bands at the time recorded in less-than-ideal circumstances, Mission of Burma were supported by Boston label Ace of Hearts, whose owner Rick Harte produced them with meticulous precision. For these three Matador reissues, Harte himself re-mastered the original analog tapes. The resulting clarity adds power to songs that have reverberated loudly through alternative rock for three decades, influencing everyone from R.E.M. to Fugazi to Nirvana. Ironically, these recordings were somewhat misrepresentative, as Harte's production cleaned up the band's brutally-loud live sound. But that's why ""Academy Fight Song"" and ""That's When I Reach For My Revolver"" were instant post-punk classics. As guitarist Roger Miller explains in his notes, ""Revolver"" came out ""much milder than we thought it should be...[and] that probably helped it become as big of a 'hit' as it was."" Burma formed in the late 70s after Miller and bassist Clint Conley left Boston group Moving Parts, recruiting Peter Prescott to play drums and Martin Swope to add tape loops. Miller and Swope had backgrounds in avant-garde music, but the band was equally interested in rocking out (Conley and Miller bonded initially over a love of the Ramones). This dichotomy is encapsulated by ""Max Ernst"", the B-side to their first release, the ""Academy Fight Song"" 7"". The band swerves seamlessly from chugging beat and jangly guitar to off-key chords and off-kilter rhythms, ending with a chant of ""Dada!"" that's both goofily artsy and seriously infectious. That 7"" opens Matador's reissue of the band's second release, the Signals, Calls, and Marches EP. From the spine-stiffening ""This is Not a Photograph"" to the post-rock-presaging ""All World Cowboy Romance"", this CD is impeccable. Even two new cuts, instrumental tracks from 1981 to which the band added vocals and guitars last year, are forcefully memorable. Add a DVD of two stunning shows (the black and white multi-camera shoot from a 1980 set at Boston's Underground is almost too good to be true), and this is probably the best Mission of Burma release ever. The two other Matador reissues are nearly as essential. Vs., the band's sole full-length, sees them stretching their sound without overreaching. There are more anthemic gems, like the Modern Lovers-in-a-blender ""Ballad of Johnny Burma"" and the frantic ""That's How I Escaped My Certain Fate"". But there is also a moody Joy Division-ish exploration (""Train""), chiming meditations (""Dead Pool"", ""Einstein's Day""), and a dissonant stomp (""New Nails"") that predicts Sonic Youth's marriage of Glenn Branca and the Ramones. The Horrible Truth About Burma was a posthumous live release, its title a reference to the group's unruly concert sound. Live, Swope often recorded the band and looped them back through the PA, so that the musicians didn't know exactly what the audience was hearing. This album has been faulted for its sonic clutter, but its raw energy is fascinating, especially in covers of the Stooges' ""1970"" and Pere Ubu's ""Heart of Darkness"", as well as a version of ""Peking Spring"", an early fan favorite Burma never recorded for Ace of Hearts because they had already tired of it by the time of their debut single. Both Vs. and Horrible Truth include bonus material, most of which has been released in some form before. So, aside from excellent re-mastering, their main attractions are their companion DVDs, offering two sets from the band's final Boston show in 1983 (originally available as an abridged VHS on Atavistic). Though not as visually enticing as the Signals DVD, the footage is still invaluable, if only as a document of Burma's enthusiastic hometown following. Conley, Prescott, and Miller (clad in ear-protecting headgear due to a case of tinnitus that would ultimately cause the band's demise) perform in workmanlike fashion, unfazed by the ecstatic bodies that flail past them. It's an apt visual metaphor for their place in history: As trends have flown by, Mission of Burma's music has held firm, unaffected by fashion, unsullied by imitation, and undiminished by the passage of time.","Matador reissues the work of one of the best post-punk bands of all time, a singular mix of complexity and immediacy that fused brainy experiments and anthemic rock.

Venus on Earth,Dengue Fever,by: Mike Powell,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b4f7b1335d7bf169a822/1:1/w_160/c23b5a30.jpg,2008-03-21 06:00:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11241-venus-on-earth/,M80 Music,"The task of presenting Dengue Fever-- an L.A.-area garage band with a Cambodian female singer-- would be a cakewalk for even the clumsiest marketers. Their novelty is clear, present, and safe; their assortment of 1960s minutiae-- from strange Cambodian translations of U.S. and UK psych-rock to spy movie soundtracks to surf-- is charmingly jumbled and affable. Every element shiny and signifying, straightforward and appealing. And yet their style creates a little dissonance in me. Celebrating Cambodian garage rock-- a music whose practitioners were systematically executed by the Khmer Rouge in the late 70s-- is an odd thing to do without historicizing it, especially when the history deserves so much sober attention. But my frustrations with them aren't conceptual, they're practical. Vocalist Chhom Nimol has an elevatory, radiant voice that would overshadow pretty much any band she might be in. In the case of Dengue Fever, that's a special blessing. Even when their songs pass muster, the performances feel ineffectual, which makes long stretches of Venus on Earth drag semi-miserably. Even the styles they so dutifully ape had an imagination about what to do with the aural character of their guitars, whether through distortion, other effects, or a particular production style. Dengue Fever's textures are straight out of the box, as if what they thought what they're doing between the bars is novel enough. Sometimes it is. Usually, it's not. While Chhom used to sing almost exclusively in Khmer, almost half of Venus on Earth is in English. There's such a thing as subpar lyrics that don't distract from the gestalt of a band's sound, but Dengue Fever don't find the balance. Instead, narratives about the strains of cross-continental love (""Tiger Phone Card"") or the distinctly Southern Californian pain of having to pick up your drunk girlfriend from parties across town (""Sober Driver"") tend to act more as a compounding element for than a distraction from the band's distinctly okay music. Gone are the few dazzling mutts that skulked through 2005's Escape from Dragon House (particularly ""Sui Bong"" and ""One Thousand Tears of a Tarantula""); here are 11 well-forged set pieces that don't really add up to great songs. I feel anal-retentive and self-loathing saying that I want to like Dengue Fever, but it's true: I appreciate that they're making indie rock music informed by a foreign stylistic context, I appreciate the mix of non-Western music with Western, and I love Chhom's voice. But there are better ""foreign"" bands, and musicians making more interesting mixes at the moment-- M.I.A., Tinariwen, and even some of Ricardo Villalobos' recent singles sound like they could be from more than one different place, and I mean that as a compliment. While Dengue Fever's intentions are good, their expressions verge on vacuous. Venus on Earth is the kind of benign aural tourism that always made me a little bored and suspicious of Air and even, occasionally, of Stereolab. But what those bands might've lacked in sincerity (if that's what you could call it), they covered for with diligence of craft. I'm generally up for pledging to lightness of mind and the revelations of exoticism, but if Venus on Earth is their idea of, well, Venus on Earth, I'll stick with Earth as is.","Dengue Fever-- an L.A.-area garage band with a Cambodian female singer-- continue to craft strange Cambodian translations of U.S. and UK psych-rock to spy movie soundtracks to surf.

Alles Wieder Offen,Einstürzende Neubauten,by: Brandon Stosuy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b50cc0084474cd0c2373/1:1/w_160/2eaf8a13.jpg,2008-03-21 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11262-alles-wieder-offen/,Potomak,"There's one heck of a conceptual framework behind Einstürzende Neubauten's Alles Wieder Offen. By now, if you're at all interested in the band, you've heard the story: The classic proto-industrial Berlin quintet funded the album via subscriptions to their website. Kind of like In Rainbows, but before Radiohead did it, and in reverse. Subscribers had the ability to critique the album while it was being made, suggesting a final sequence or telling the band to pick up a scrap they decided to leave behind on the studio floor. Additionally, a subscription gave the lucky EN fan access to webcam performances and rehearsals. Again, tres Radiohead. The subscriber service isn't new to EN's practice: Their last ""official"" release was 2004's Perpetual Motion, but the group's self-released more than ten collections via the website between Perpetual and Alles. Increasing the meta, some of that material made its way-- chopped, diced, or re-envisioned-- onto Alles. And that's only part of the frame. If you go to the band's web page, they provide usual EN-style background info-- source material, anecdotes, and/or inter-oeuvre references-- for the 10 tracks. For instance, ""Susej"" is based on a piece for rhythm guitar vocalist Blixa Bargeld recorded in a flooded cellar in Hamburg in the early 1980s. We also learn Alles features the band's first use of a box of aluminum sticks as an instrument (can you guess which tune?). There's too much to absorb-- you could spend nights reading the supporting materials (including the lyrics handily translated into English) without finding the time to listen to the music. Thing is, when you do get around to listening, the background isn't all that interesting or integral. In fact, it actually takes away from collection's sonic purity. It makes it feel too self-important. Alles works wonderfully as music when divorced from its press releases: The collection definitely includes uninteresting passages, but on the whole, it also introduces some of the band's most sublime work to date. This isn't the Neubauten of your childhood. There are moments of dissonance (see the anti-climax of the 9-minute ""Unvollständigkeit"") and the sheet metal's all over the place, but from ""Die Wellen""'s opening pulsation swell to the strummed and then screeched finale ""Ich Warte"", it's a relatively smooth ride. On ""Die Wellen"" (""The Waves""), for example, Bargeld whispers soothingly. He does that sorta thing often. This is the first time you hear him on the record, and as the vibrations accrue volume and a little bit of violence-- guitar, organ, piano, drums viola, and cello are interwoven-- he grows angstier, but remains controlled all the way to the final poetic exclamation: ""I hold my own, shout at each single wave: Are you staying?/ Are you staying?/ Are you staying, or what?"" It's like a tuning of strings before an orchestra starts. Then it cuts. The following track, ""Nagorny Karabach"", has a mellow, gentle, 70s proggy feel. The song's somewhat reminiscent of Fritz Ostermayer's Kitsch Concrete, or, more intriguingly, the recent nighttime baroque of Ulver, another European shape-shifter mellowing ecstatically with age. It includes an e-bow guitar (which I could hear), a jet turbine (maybe), and samples from a 16th century church organ (which I read about on their site). Lyrically, there are ""Two large black ravens/ Devouring the plums in the tree"" and a man in exile, ""hiding in Nagorny Karabakh."" Like a lot of the tunes here, it reminds me of Shakespeare, if only because EN wrestles with huge human themes. Maybe the most surprising song is ""Let's Do it a Dada"", which could seriously work as a dancefloor hit. When placed beside the work of some of the more adventurous producers on pop radio, it feels like clattering electroclash, complete with a huge chorus. (Wonder what the Dada would look like as an actual dance step? If anything, hopefully there's a lobster suit involved.) There are a number of other interesting moments, like the nursery rhyming ""Ich Hatte Ein Wort"", which reminded me of old Siltbreeze noisemakers the Shadow Ring: we hear storytelling voices over a clamoring, but skeletal background, muted rock guitar, and an infectiously insane ""de de de de de"" hook. ""Von Wegen"" has a similar feel, but seemingly stays quieter-- midnight rumbles, nocturnal taps-- until Bargeld pilots into a ""wegan"" loop, repeating the word, as though mantra. After which, strings cascade with the clamor of metal alongside downward-drifting vocalisms (bum, bum, bum), and this line: ""Dissolve me like sugar/ If you find the time for it."" A love song! Sort of. Maybe it's coincidental, or I'm over doing it because of all the materials they attach to the album, but EN save what could be read as the album's moral (or punchline) for the ending. ""Ich Warte""-- which the website tells us ""probably includes more untranslatable German puns than any EN song""-- starts with a pastoral guitar and Bargeld's gently spoken words; somewhat surprisingly, it shifts into crazy ride-em-cowboy noise-slapping. You get the sense Neubauten's reminding us they don't plan to go quietly. Some of the lyrics, minus those German puns? ""I'm waiting for there to be nothing left to wait for/ Life is not an error, not error and music/ I'm waiting/ I'm waiting still."" That restlessness keeps the band ferocious even when they're singing these semi-lullabies. Einstürzende Neubauten have been together for more than three decades, and it's satisfying watching (and listening to) them at the height of their powers, constantly using an exploratory virtuosity to push their practice into ever newer realms. The album's title might be translated ""All Open Again,"" but no real need for that ""again.""","The German industrial veterans created a new album funded by donations (and feedback) from their fans. The result is a shift in sound: while there are moments of dissonance and the sheet metal is all over the place, overall it's a relatively smooth ride.

Love and Circuits: A Cardboard Records Compilation (From Aa To Zs),Various Artists,by: Jason Crock,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b53b9d034d5c69bf4fbe/1:1/w_160/43bb630f.jpg,2008-03-21 06:00:02,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11301-love-and-circuits-a-cardboard-records-compilation-from-aa-to-zs/,Cardboard,"The 2xCD compilation Love and Circuits does not represent the best of the best, or the pick of some unrepresented litter. It is not going to clue you into the new hot scene. It was not ""curated"" by a major magazine, PR company, or Devendra Banhart. It does not even hope to hang together as a cohesive album; its 57 contributors are presented in alphabetical order. Many of the bands are from the Cardboard label's home of Brooklyn, but on the whole the record has no geographical center. Given that the contribution from Trey Told 'Em (Greg Gillis aka Girl Talk and Frank Musarra) is a mashup of the record's other 56 tracks, the compilation is almost a love letter to overstimulation and information paralysis. I've seen the words ""scene report"" around Love and Circuits, and while there are some similarities to be drawn between the bands-- kinda punk, kinda dipping their toes into noise or drone or folk or or experimental music or muscular rock-- its overwhelming diversity is its highest strength. By abandoning notions of scenes, enclaves, genre, and anything else but bands still plugging away at a (mostly) small DIY model, it's a much more accurate representation of whatever passes for ""indie."" I mean, I guess it could have No Age on it, come with a bonus DVD, and could give you beer candy every time you played it, but otherwise it's pretty hard collection to fault. Its compilers, Dan Friel and BJ Warshaw of Parts & Labor, say he hopes you find your new favorite band here. If you have any taste for left-of-center punk and indie, you likely will. Most of the artists tend towards the more discernibly melodic side of the noise spectrum, and no one's afraid of electronics (no matter how cheap they sound), but there's plenty of room here for variation. Arch hypnotists like Fuck Buttons or These Are Powers (both among the few who contribute previously released songs, alas) go up against pagan primitivists like Fathers Day, offering up the desperately ironic ""I Have So Much Respect for Women"". Relative OGs of the indie underbelly like the mighty Oneida or Japanther turn in exemplary tracks, making sense of incidental noise within their own skewered yet effective songwriting, while newcomers like Bipolar Bear and their crumbling swagger or indie's latest soundtrack for finger-painting, High Places, put forth fine arguments for why they belong in this company. Treble-heavy Big Black acolytes like Action Beat or Tunnel of Love sit next to blink-and-you'll-miss-them Casio workouts, one of which is called ""I Smell Poop Gub"". It sounds like every support act Parts & Labor ever shared a bill with, and that turns out to be a great thing. While Love and Circuits ranges from ear-splitting upstarts like Jerk to the sunny one-finger keyboard anthems of Best Fwends or Matt & Kim, it might be the artists actually repping Cardboard who make the biggest impact: Parts & Labor turn in more gritty synth-punk with supercharged straight-ahead rhythms on ""No Night"", while P&L offshoot Shooting Spires cover Bad Brains' ""Sailin' On"" in ominous washed-out electronics. New signeess Ecstatic Sunshine coast further on the quirky charm of their guitar-duet debut on ""Crystal in the Sky"", and Pterodactyl provide another gleeful slice of squealing psychedelic noise on ""5 Minutes in 2 Minutes"". Gowns, however, add the sparest bit of electric guitar to serve as a downbeat to their painfully austere horror folk, and the result, ""What if Not You"", is their very own ""Under Pressure"". Chaotic or serene, minimalist or balls-to-the-wall, there's a similarity between these disparate artists that's hard to define-- and maybe for the better, Love and Circuits doesn't try. A new prefix or genre tag belittles the diversity of this compilation, as well as the eclectic scene that inspired it. Market-clogging compilations like Next can make some forget that there's more to indie than adult-contempo for snobs, but the interesting bands just below the surface of that are legion-- and Love and Circuits offers curious listeners a running start.","By abandoning notions of scenes, enclaves, genre, and anything else but bands still plugging away at a DIY model, this 2xCD compilation of everything from punk to folk to experimental music to drone is about as accurate a representation of whatever passes for ""indie"" these days as you're likely to find. Among the 57 bands featured are Matt & Kim, Oneida, Fuck Buttons, High Places, Thee Oh Sees, Numbers, Gowns, and Parts & Labor.

Visiter,The Dodos,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b51413d197565213abe6/1:1/w_160/fd55ddc8.jpg,2008-03-21 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11268-visiter/,Frenchkiss,"To understand where San Francisco's Dodos are coming from, just check the weekend itinerary from their most recent visit to L.A. On a Friday, they did a campus show for USC students; but when a miscommunication foiled their next day's plan to play at the Smell-- the venue at the epicenter of the local scene-- they ended up joining a bill with Thee Oh Sees and the Crystal Antlers at a birthday party at the Silverlake Lounge, an intimate, cozy space where you can't see a thing if you're more than five feet from the stage. It's within those coordinates (campus-quad pop, art-punk, and communal, lo-fi folk) that their Frenchkiss debut Visiter exists; an acoustic-and-percussion duo at their core, Dodos manage to hit with a full-band force that's even more pronounced in their astounding live sets. On Visiter, Dodos guitarist Meric Long alternates between fingerpicking and breakneck strumming while playing in confounding alternate tunings. Logan Kroeber's clattering, locomotive percussion (which includes shoes outfitted with tambourines) is every bit a lead instrument as Long's guitar, and a big reason the band's music has garnered comparisons to the less abstract moments of Animal Collective and the output of other new-primitivist bands like High Places and Yeasayer. The first quarter of Visiter marries those impulses with fantastic results. The banjo playing and female harmonies on opener ""Walking"" echo Michigan-era Sufjan, but the connection ends at Long's stridently confident vocal delivery. That song immediately segues into the maniacal ""Red & Purple"", a bewilderingly worded love song accompanied by a toy piano and fuzzy bass. And after the brief ""Eyelids"" comes ""Fools"", which has been bouncing around the web in some form for months, and is fast becoming the Dodos' signature tune-- although it may soon be eclipsed by the rollicking, Feelies-esque ""Jodi"". From that point on, Visiter alternates between longer, more improvisatory material and near-interludes, which can leave a slightly spotty impression on its first few listens. With more exposure, the record reveals the celebratory acoustics of Led Zeppelin III or a more song-oriented take on tourmates Akron/Family. Playing with infectious fervor, Long runs through tricky blues-boxing and molten slide riffs on the galloping ""Paint the Rust"" and the second half of the epic ""Joe's Waltz"". Visiter's second half is anchored by ""The Season"" and ""God?"", two massive shapeshifters that help define the record. Long and Kroeber here don't seem wedded to power duo minimalism-- and it's intriguing to wonder how they could incorporate their backgrounds in metal, African Ewe drumming, and gamelan beyond a sense of rhythmic intensity. These possibilities could also make more streamlined, Magnetic Fields-like numbers ""Winter"" and ""Undeclared"" seem vanilla by comparison to some, but by making room for both, Visiter ends up being one of the most welcoming (and welcome) records of 2008 so far.","Despite a stripped-down setup of just acoustic guitar and drums, this Bay Area duo hits with a full-band force. Visiter, their Frenchkiss debut, has garnered comparisons to Animal Collective and new-primitivist bands like High Places and Yeasayer.

In a Cave,Elf Power,by: Adam Moerder,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a180c0084474cd0bfe05/1:1/w_160/155ec12f.jpg,2008-03-21 06:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11246-in-a-cave/,Ryko,"A band that once could be described as traipsing through a blissful psych-pop daydream, Elf Power now appear doomed to wander through indie rock purgatory for an eternity. Outliving just about every other original E6 band, they've made a career flirting with both commercial and critical success only to come up empty-handed in relation to their E6 peers. Their mainstream coup, 2004's Walking With the Beggar Boys, eschewed the band's lo-fi safety net in favor of pristine power-pop and unmitigated T. Rex-isms, failing at a genre shift that ironically would prove fruitful in 2007 for fellow E6 elders Of Montreal. So as reparations, fans first received 2006's no-frills Back to the Web and now In a Cave, the tail end of an extended sigh that started after Beggar Boys' glam rock blowout. Like any Elf Power effort, the songs here are built around frontman Andrew Rieger, and they sink or swim based on his intermittent sparks of creativity. At its brightest, Cave evokes the lysergic escapism of E6's glory days. The meaty bass riff on ""Spiral Stairs"" gets diluted with vintage fuzz effects and Rieger's consistently sedated delivery, creating yet another gem from the template of Olivia Tremor Control's ""The Opera House"". The band sounds even fresher when digging through a dusty attic's worth of eccentric instruments and sound effects. Drowsy dirges like ""A Tired Army"" and ""Window to Mars"" feel tailor-made for Rieger's unflappable droll, and their disjointed yet catchy melodies-- which are too seldom on this album-- even raise the question of whether or not this band should be doing more drugs. Working with such a canonized palette, the pressure's constantly on Rieger to transcend his band's stylistic limitations. In the E6 universe, nothing does this better than a Beatles-esque hook. Unfortunately, he's only got a handful to spare on Cave, and for every heart-melting ditty like ""Softly Through the Void"", he's likely to lull listeners with lazy folk numbers like ""The Demon's Daughter"" or closer ""Midnight Crawls Out"". Even worse, the residual effects of Beggar's libidinous strut plague some of the filler tracks here, their hazy boogie beats giving Rieger an excuse not to be as engaging as he could be while sounding way less sexy than needs to. For all these drawbacks, Cave will still provide a quick fix for psych fans. In fact, they've even managed to exorcise most of the demons from their ill-advised geek glam dabbling. But while Cave represents a return to form, the band hasn't recaptured the beauty of early highlights like When the Red King Comes or A Dream in Sound. Instead, the band churns out another canned acid trip that only hints at E6's salad days, their mind-freeing mysticism stripped away long ago to leave nothing but rote psych manufacturing.","

I Shall Exterminate Everything Around Me That Restricts Me From Being the Master,Electric Six,by: Roque Strew,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b517ea9e61561daa6d5d/1:1/w_160/a5a790ba.jpg,2008-03-20 05:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11271-i-shall-exterminate-everything-around-me-that-restricts-me-from-being-the-master/,Metropolis,"In 2003, the Detroit band Electric Six found some fame, especially in England, through their transcendently dumb singles ""Gay Bar"" and ""Danger! High Voltage"". The songs were over-the-top and showed the jesters' almost encyclopedic hold on every brand of rock theatrics from 1975 to 1985. Sure, this may describe about 70% of your student center's Battle of the Bands entrants, but this band spiked the brew with heaping helpings of irony and self-consciousness. Kings of Leon they are not. Electric Six are chuckling at themselves, yes-- and they also seem to be poking fun at those hammy, cartoonish expressions of manliness that crowd the playlists of every nipple-ringed Delta pledge. Thus the Electric Six discography abounds with wry renditions of cock- and garage-rock that the gender-studies set can comfortably load onto their iPods. It is quite a coup. Yet on I Shall Exterminate Everything Around Me That Restricts Me From Being the Master, the revolution sputters. It's not the old case of a perfectly low-rent aesthetic becoming somehow ""compromised"" by the more upmarket production you'd find on MTV, lacquered and Autotuned to oblivion. Simple predictability is to blame. When Dick Valentine opens the record, bellowing on the saloon rambler ""It's Showtime!"" in his mock-macho growl, over mock-operatic riffs, and clarinets and pianos, you quickly get your fill. Soon you yearn for the old Electric Six, with its perfect quantity of smarty-pants pomp, when there was a little energy and wit behind their disco infiltrators. This just feels derivative. Once upon a time, being derivative was half of the band's shtick-- but never more than half. They cleverly and shamelessly used MOR clichés as touchstones for their twisted imagination. So the other half was the act of poking fun at this source material, as they remade all that high-stepping 1980s swagger into memorably silly, truly postmodern dance music. (Of course, this only applies to 2003's Fire.) Electric Six defenders may answer that these judgments miss the point, that there's far more to the band than tongue-in-cheek appropriation of the past. They may say their whole body of work takes aim at the carnival of American culture. Free of any ""Danger""-grade hits, 2005's Señor Smoke is held up as proof of the band's satirical, capital-s Seriousness. But the fact is that ""Jimmy Carter"" says exactly as much about presidential folly as ""Down at McDonnellzzzzz"" says about the nation's waistlines. Valentine wants to decry our excess by turning it into a punchline, yet thanks to the cheese-ball arrangements and childish lyrics, neither comic effect nor social critique is ever attained. Given that Bush's America is more than a little like Weimar Germany, this should have been like fish in a barrel. More evidence of a hidden Swiftian intellect, supposedly, is that the title of the new album comes from an anti-Weimar George Grosz cartoon. Defying any rumors of thematic gravity, Dick Valentine himself crunched the numbers, once declaring that ""80 percent of our songs, maybe even higher than 80 percent"" are about nothing at all. On the gleefully nihilistic Fire that was fine. But five years later, without glee, we're left with boring nihilism. Without any attempt to elaborate their sound, without dance-floor contenders or striking hooks, without straying meaningfully from the templates of straightaway rock, Exterminate simply fulfills the promise of its title: like most Dadaist jokes, this one isn't funny.","On their latest tongue-in-cheek take on cock- and garage-rock, the Detroit band suffer from predictability.

Annwn,Ocrilim,by: Grayson Currin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b503c0084474cd0c2369/1:1/w_160/a8dfe0fc.jpg,2008-03-20 05:00:03,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11253-annwn/,Hydra Head,"I don't love Annwn, Mick Barr's 79-minute-and-41-second guitar wall of extreme theme-and-variation, melody-and-texture stratification. But I do respect its seven unflinching, unapologetic seven-to-15-minute guitar monoliths, not to mention Barr's technical ability and his sense for compounded sounds. This isn't strict minimalism, but it carries that sense of devotion to sound and idea, to chasing a notion from one end of an album to another. Barr's piercing multi-tracked electric guitars build deep beds at the base. On ""Part 1"", he sporadically stops his static sound to unload a thin riff, which gets longer each time he plays it. Before the 13 minutes of ""Part 1"" expire, he's playing over the static, augmenting it and bending it from above. Barr is a composer in search of a single epic and a guitarist in search of a million thrills, and here he proves he's got the tools and the mindset to procure both. But Annwn is a little unkind to most every audience, save perhaps the most attentive. It's more of a workshop than an album, really. Casual listeners will get lost in Barr's long-form excursions after 90 seconds. If you're willing to hang on Barr's every riff and layer time and again, Annwn is full of rewards. The record is at its most effective when it is rapid on top and glacial beneath, as during the midsection of 15-minute ""Part 2"". Barr moves between small intervals in slow, jolting steps, and each drop or lift feels like a revelation, even though he's shredding above the stasis with thin, high, impatient lances. The effect is one of simultaneous and alternate allusions-- of sprinting but getting nowhere, of crawling but watching mileposts click past. Whenever Barr creates conflicts and resolves them while baiting the listener with serpentine riffs, Annwn is exhilarating. On ""Part 4"", for instance, he lets riffs whiz by one another, tugging attention in multiple directions, only to circle the wagons with harmonies you never saw coming. It's composition disguised as chaos, more meticulous than masturbatory. As another symptom of Annwn's workshop feel, Barr saves the most triumphant and accessible illustration for ""Part 7"", the last and shortest thing here: It's an anthem from the start, several circular parts interconnecting with one another, rising and falling constantly. By track's end, there's a viscous sound at the bottom, but one guitar crests its breakers like a champion. Suddenly, a record that's felt mostly like an inhuman exercise climaxes like a victory march.","Mick Barr is back with seven unflinching, unapologetic seven-to-15-minute guitar monoliths.

Hungry for Nothing,Fight Amp,by: Cosmo Lee,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b5015e6ef959693226d2/1:1/w_160/8538f3d3.jpg,2008-03-20 05:00:02,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11251-hungry-for-nothing/,Translation Loss,"Fight Amp's MySpace description is dead-on: ""Grunge / Punk / Metal."" This New Jersey band harkens back to a time when these genres were bedmates. Before recording Bleach, Nirvana listened to Celtic Frost incessantly. This was before Butch Vig polished off their edges, before Marc Jacobs had a ""grunge"" collection. In the late-1980s/early-90s, Amphetamine Reptile belched forth West Coast grit (the Melvins, Steel Pole Bath Tub), East Coast noise (Helmet, Unsane), and Midwest dirt (the Cows, Hammerhead); Touch and Go-- pre-indie rock days-- likewise issued filth and difficulty via Big Black, Butthole Surfers, and the Jesus Lizard. Though sonically disparate, these bands shared a contemptuous disregard for rock's playbook. Thus, Fight Amp aren't revelatory: They're drawing on established models of rebellion rather than drawing their own, but they're no less potent for it. In fact, hindsight has honed their influences with fearsome focus. Guitarists Mike McGinnis and Rebecca Burchette slice out riffs with metallic accuracy. In the liner notes, Jon Dehart slings a duct-taped P-Bass; the black-and-white photo could have come from a Sub Pop sleeve. But unlike his forebears, Dehart can play his instrument. Scott Hissem's precise pounding opens big holes, into which Dehart pours throbbing pulses. The overall effect recalls the Jesus Lizard, who had one of the most punishing rhythm sections of the 90s. The payoff, then, is different. Instead of the white-knuckle anarchy of AmRep 7""'s, Hungry for Nothing is a calculated beatdown. Even the band's name reflects this. As Fight Amputation, the band raggedly sprawled with hardcore punk influences. But as a leaner Fight Amp, they've slowed down, making each punch count. ""Late Bloomer"" punctuates verses with pregnant pauses, building to churning climaxes. Air raid unisons then announce the return of Black Sabbath. ""Dead Is Dead"" rides train tracks of chugging riffs, as Hissem drops hi-hat accents like elbows. In ""Get High and Fuck"", low end snarls the titular mission, while drones descend like distant warplanes. Scarred-throat howls erupt from the next room. The hollow-eyed filth of early-00s Ministry comes to mind. Peers like Akimbo, Black Elk, and Blues mine similar inspirations, but Fight Amp stand out with metallic atmosphere. ""What a Drag"" drowns in sheets of doomy desperation. ""Bound and Hagged"" gives Jesus Lizard dissonance Danzig-esque brawn. Three-fourths through, it slouches into a shuffle, which is really a ruse; after a tense pause, hammering re-commences. Danzig glowers throughout, in the song title ""Samhain"", the horror comic book artwork, and the lyrical altitude set at six feet under. This is no mere garage punk; this is a finely tuned assault with booming, modern production. It's not ""dope, guns, and fucking in the streets,"" but it's pretty fucking dope.","This New Jersey band harkens back to a time when genres like grunge, punk, and metal were bedmates.

Murray begged for the listener to use his body as if it were their own on With Love's ""Nobody Move, Nobody Get Hurt"", and on his new record he sounds like someone who's been taken up on the offer far too often-- ""We all recognize that I'm the problem here"" (""Ghouls""), ""I realize that I am naturally inclined just to let you down"" (""Let's See It""), ""Listen, I may have given you the wrong impression"" (""Spoken For""). You get the idea, but rarely does it come off as self-pitying so much as self-deprecating. Modesty, however, can create problems for a band that lives three minutes at a time. While With Love and Squalor was frequently, oddly tagged ""dance punk""-- a claim that stretched the sub-genre to the breaking point-- We Are Scientists here rely heavily on synthetics, which don't suit them. There's no point in taking a band to task for shitty mastering if it's countered by melodies or emotional resonance (see: Neutral Milk Hotel), but it's troubling for a record that's pursuing more surface thrills. The dominant sound of Brain Thrust Mastery is a synth wash that tries to excite like cocaine but ends up numbing like Novocaine, effectively narcotizing what are mostly bland arrangements to begin with. We Are Scientists got accused of coming on too strong on With Love-- uptempo pop-rock, almost entirely about girls and embarrassing drunkenness-- and they do the same thing here, only from a sonic angle; namely, there's no empty space at all. The lurching fuzz bass and ticky-tack 808 hi hats of ""Ghouls"" suggests seriously intense study of TV on the Radio's ""Staring at the Sun"", but it all goes to highlight the importance of David Sitek's production. Despite inevitably blasting into more traditional rock, ""Ghouls"" still goes nowhere-- each element desperately groping at each other in a cluttered mix like horny teens in the dark. ""Lethal Enforcer"" comes equipped with a serious mid-1980s Cure jones, and far too much extraneous baggage. The imitative strings are a decent touch, but they keep getting inappropriately prodded by popping bass and chicken-scratch guitar. Even the palm-muted aimlessness of ""Spoken For"" eventually gives way to distended guitar blasts that come off more like pressure hoses than a sound emanating from wood and string. Still, as far as mainstream pop-rock records go, Brain Thrust Mastery occasionally gets the job done. Lead single ""After Hours"" bops along like the second single Jimmy Eat World's Chase This Light sorely lacked, while the dramatic ""Tonight"" finally makes good use of their Korgs. Both are good enough to make you marginally interested in what We Are Scientists will do next, at best. Those who fail to learn from Hot Hot Heat are doomed to repeat them.","After the modest success of 2006's With Love and Squalor, We Are Scientists again pursue surface thrills through self-deprecation and uptempo modern rock about girls and embarrassing drunkenness.

Midnight Boom,The Kills,by: Jason Crock,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b53c13d197565213ac20/1:1/w_160/29731d12.jpg,2008-03-20 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11302-midnight-boom/,Domino,"Stylish, sexy, and simple, the nouveau-garage clatter of the Kills has magnificently sat on a line between base and brilliant. They've traded in a bluesy, overdriven sleaze that's served many a duo well in recent years, blurring the edges between their tandem vocals, staccato guitars, and vintage drum machines. On albums such as Keep on Your Mean Side (2003) and No Wow (2005), they managed to take a classic rock template and turn it into something more modern and audibly dangerous. Midnight Boom pushes those edges even further, and has its own kind of swagger that stands apart from anything they've done so far. Despite hammering on its titular phrase like it's a lip gloss for sale, opener ""U.R.A. Fever"" manages to sound like an XTRMNTR outtake that substitutes seduction for violence, with a slinky backbeat made from equal parts purring bass and jarring phone noise. Many Kills reviews suggest romance in between the two principals-- Alison ""VV"" Mosshart and Jamie ""Hotel"" Hince; the masterfully sustained tension of their previous music practically invited the guesswork. But in comparison, Midnight Boom is limp. The album's beat-heavy inclinations are supposedly inspired by playground chants (specifically a film documentary called Pizza Pizza Daddio), which is easy to pick out from handclaps and martial drumbeats that run through almost every track here. But that same inspiration extends to the sing-song vocal melodies, and much of the lyrics. Now, lyrically, the Kills never had to do any heavy lifting; so long as the words sounded vaguely sexy and/or badass, they fit perfectly. However, the tawdry cheerleader chanting of ""Cheap and Cheerful"" quickly move past intriguing to inane, and the wordless chorus of ""Getting Down"" recalls all the inspiration and verve of the Greg Kihn Band. They just don't write 'em like that anymore, and with good reason. The saving grace of Midnight Boom is the Kills' desire to break these songs open and see how they work, what makes them tick. The beat-first approach is just window dressing on tracks like ""Cheap and Cheerful"" (despite some production help from Armani XXXchange of Spank Rock; maybe the remix will fare better), but others like ""Tape Song"" jump from coy and insinuating to the album's most blistering chorus. Throughout, Mosshart's vocals are fuller and reflect more character than before. On one of the best rock songs I've heard so far this year, ""Last Day of Magic"" trades the stiff pinball plink of its verses with a tease towards catharsis on a tantalizing two-chord chorus that gets a little longer with each return, until it's finally revealed unmolested as the song's melodic anchor in maybe the last half-minute. By the time you get the full impression of the song, it's over. It's a great trick of rearranging that pulls back the curtain dramatically, but nearly every other song on Midnight Boom seems to be waiting for this kind of moment, losing it to a pile on the cutting-room floor.","On Keep on Your Mean Side and No Wow, the Kills managed to take a classic rock template and turn it into something more modern and audibly dangerous; here, the band pushes those edges even further.

Just a Little Lovin',Shelby Lynne,by: Joshua Klein,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b5069d034d5c69bf4f6a/1:1/w_160/e207f579.jpg,2008-03-19 05:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11256-just-a-little-lovin/,Lost Highway,"How many times can a singer introduce herself before the act become meaningless? Shelby Lynne released several albums of contemporary country throughout the late 1980s and early 90s before reemerging (and recreating herself) on 1999's renewed statement of purpose I Am Shelby Lynne (in true Grammy fashion, she won a Best New Artist award for this, her sixth album). Yet despite that album's relative success, Lynne proved as restless as ever with 2001's poppy Love, Shelby, 2003's aptly named Identity Crisis, and 2005's Suit Yourself, which further toned down the twang in favor of spare, moody rock (not nearly as eclectic as some claimed, even as Lynne showed clear, confident growth as a songwriter). Lynne has made another about face, this time with Just a Little Lovin', a tribute to Dusty Springfield. The timing of the disc is curious, to say the least. A known quantity, Lynne seems to be trying re-establish herself once again, gaining a new foothold as a chanteuse and interpreter with a critical catnip move that, at least on its face, appears pretty safe. After all, a Springfield tribute would have been the perfect attention-gaining move, say, 10 years ago. In 2008, it seems a bit like playing a ""get out of career jail free"" card she's been holding in her pocket for at least as long. Lynne (and, for that matter, little sister Allison Moorer, also out with a new covers disc) has been earning comparisons to Springfield for years, but to her enormous credit seems to have been the first to acknowledge the 800-lb gorilla in the room: Just a Little Lovin' may pay tribute to Springfield, but it treads very lightly when it comes to Springfield's definitive Dusty in Memphis, whose sessions inspired just four of the remakes on this disc. The rest come from Springfield's 1964 debut A Girl Called Dusty, plus a pleasant run through the oft covered (by Dusty and others) ""The Look of Love"" and ""How Can I Be Sure"". And then there's ""Pretend"", the biggest risk on the album, an original song inspired by Springfield and as good a place to start as any when tackling such a loaded disc. Respectfully deferring to the legacy of Dusty in Memphis (and, specifically, ""Son of a Preacher Man"", which Lynne wisely did not record) is one thing. But including an original song on a disc otherwise composed of songs associated with Springfield is another. It's a tall order to summon up a song Dusty Springfield might have sang. Then again, few would have ever imagined Springfield would have a hit collaboration with the Pet Shop Boys, so who knows. But does ""Pretend"" work? Sure, why not, which gets to the conflicted crux of this project. Lynne could have easily attempted to emulate Springfield, but she doesn't. Just a Little Lovin' could have easily attempted to emulate Springfield's arrangements, too, with horns or strings, but it doesn't. Instead, both Lynne and album alike attempt to pay tribute to the songs Springfield sang and made famous as much as the singer herself. That's an honorable approach, to be sure, with one catch: Springfield didn't write her songs, so if you take away the things that made them hers what's left are songs that may as well be anyone's. With jazzy, crystal-clear production favoring intimate acoustic guitar and upright bass, Lynne does justice to these tracks, her voice just the right mix of smoky, sad and soulful even if the milquetoast backing lends it little muscle. The title track and ""I Only Want to Be With You"" are light and airy, with extra credit to the latter for twisting such a standard into an entirely new shape. The Delta blues underpinnings of Lynne's ""Willie and Laura Mae Jones"" may not quite be a revelation, but the swamp vibe feels perfect. On the other end of the spectrum, while Springfield might have recorded the first version of ""The Look of Love"", the song's since moved well past any claim to ownership. Just as Lynne steered clear of ""Son of a Preacher Man"", she should have steered clear of this over-exposed cliché of a song, too. But a bigger problem can be found in the sultry gait of ""Breakfast in Bed"", which boasts (and highlights) something missing from much of the rest of the record: some playful sexiness. By stripping them down to their bones, Lynne gets the skeleton of these songs right, but in the end you can't help but miss the meat that made Springfield who she was. Springfield never made music meant for the background, but that's unfortunately just where Lynne's emotional in intent but passive in execution take on Springfield's legacy ultimately belongs.","A dour Shelby Lynne does Dusty Springfield, demonstrating that minus the Dusty these standards don't shine nearly as bright.

Two Rivers,Amir ElSaffar,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b5029d034d5c69bf4f61/1:1/w_160/0b1cdf27.jpg,2008-03-19 05:00:03,Jazz,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11252-two-rivers/,Pi,"Let's do a little free association. The word is Iraq. What comes to mind? I bounced this off a few people in the past few days, and got back answers that included war, violence, Islam, Sunnis & Shiites, Arabs, Saddam Hussein, oil, WMDs (answer given as an acronym) and suicide bombings. You'd barely even know there was an actual country, much less any kind of culture, behind all that if you just looked at the collection of words. Really, the responses I got were a collection of impressions (very similar to my own) culled from news reports dating back to the Iran-Iraq War in the 1980s-- it's exceedingly easy in our media culture to forget that behind all the no-fly zones, Sunni Triangles, concrete barriers, smart bombs, and corpses there are more than 25 million people trying to lead somewhat normal lives. Amir ElSaffar doesn't live in Iraq and wasn't even born there-- he was born in Illinois to an Iraqi father and an American mother, but you can imagine that ever since 1991 his Iraqi heritage weighed heavily in his mind. He's played jazz and classical trumpet since the 90s, including stints with Cecil Taylor and Vijay Iyer, but in 2002 he traveled to Baghdad as the drum beat of war was slowly rising to learn to play the santoor, a Mesopotamian hammer dulcimer. He also learned to play traditional maqam music. The maqam is built around a ruhiyya, which is a basic modal melodic framework for improvisation-- the same approach taken by a great deal of modern jazz. This trip back to his cultural roots led directly to his first recordings as a bandleader, including this one. The title Two Rivers refers to the Tigris and Euphrates, the two principle rivers of Iraq, and the water sources for some of the world's earliest civilizations. The record isn't a maqam recording in the strictest sense-- rather, it blends the techniques of maqam with modern jazz (Iraqi maqam is also a vocal form, but ElSaffar keeps it mostly instrumental for this record). The sextet includes trumpet, santoor, alto sax, oud, violin, bass drums, and hand percussion (not all at once, obviously) and swings back and forth between mellifluous themes, complex rhythms and time changes, and diffuse semi-free passages that often feature multiple instruments playing against a single one that holds down the theme. ElSaffar carefully annotates each of his compositions in the liners, explaining where the rhythms came from and the origins of the maqams his own tunes are drawn from-- reading them, I got the rare feeling that I was actually learning something from the album notes. That's all great, but it wouldn't be worth much if the music didn't move me as well. And it does. The unique rhythms (one track is in 17/8) create an interesting framework for jazz improvisation, and the tension between structure and anarchy is high throughout the album. One of the record's most gripping moments occurs on ""Khosh Reng (Maqam Awj)"", when ElSaffar puts down the trumpet and sings. The phrases tend to begin with a few words sung on a single note and move away microtonally at the end. It's also great to hear a new recording that showcases the santoor, a beautiful instrument that sounds somewhere between a piano, a mandolin and a harp. It's an instrument most people in the West don't even know exists, played in a style most people in the West aren't aware exists, and it gives us a piece of Iraq we can't get on CNN. In fact, apart from Sublime Frequencies' excellent Choubi Choubi! compilation, it's hard to hear any Iraqi music today and rare to get a glimpse into the country's incredibly rich cultural history. Two Rivers provides that, and it's also a great modern jazz album.","Chicago vet and Iraqi-American returns to his cultural roots, mixing the techniques of maqam with modern jazz.

Angels of Destruction!,Marah,by: Andrew Gaerig,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b4fc9d034d5c69bf4f54/1:1/w_160/071618b2.jpg,2008-03-19 05:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11247-angels-of-destruction/,Yep Roc,"Oh shit: Marah have been running sideways from indie rock trends for so long that they've stumbled into a scene-wide Springsteen love-in. Arcade Fire, Hold Steady, Constantines, even the Killers-- several of the most acclaimed/successful bands of the last three years have taken up influences Marah's been hammering for a decade, and if this trend wasn't already flying high on the fiery eyes of your lover's dying pride when If You Didn't Laugh, You'd Cry dropped in early 2006, it definitely is now. Say what you will about Marah's spotty recordings, but if you were going to set Kids in Philly as the over/under for the quality of the next Killers album, how many of you are taking the over? For the next Arcade Fire album? Okay okay, but it would still be some kind of nasty irony if the reason Marah didn't catch a break in 2008 is because they don't sound enough like Brooce. It's no secret that Marah, through personnel changes-- Angels of Destruction! features four new members-- or general restlessness or maybe a shredded throat, have abandoned their reedy, rambling The Wild, the Innocent, & the E Street Shuffle sound. Today, they're a beefier band that has more in common with the Strokes or Wilco than the 1970s groups to which they're more often compared. Singers Serge and Dave Bielanko disappointingly leave one another alone too: sloppy buddy-choruses have given way to polite turn-taking. None of this really changes the fact that listening to Marah is sort of fun, if for no other reason than in the middle of a Marah album you can rationalize a lyric like ""Reelin' from a tongue-kiss/ On the outskirts of foreverness"" in way that you mostly cannot when you are reading or writing about the band. Marah's reputation has probably suffered among critics for that very reason, but it's a phenomenon that Angels will absolutely not correct: at this point in their career Marah hardly need black-and-white photos of sparking cigarettes, exclamation points, or 10 minute multi-part album closers (""Wilderness"") to prove to the world they are very, very serious about rock'n'roll. Angels contains plenty of good Marah-y things, too. Marah are best when they boogie or slow-dance (as opposed to the alt-rock in-between). Marah find the former on opener ""Coughing Up Blood"" and ""Wild West Love Song"", both of which blitz along quickly enough to make you forget about dynamics or even great hooks-- the rush is its own atmosphere. True to their tendency to include one readymade prom-night song on each album, ""Blue But Cool"" features ""wooo-oooh"" backing vocals and loping piano chords. It is likely not the album's most ridiculous set of lyrics, but it seems so because they're the slowest, and the best too: ""Two heart-sick fools drinking beer on the kitchen stools/ And we're scared/ Yeah we're blue, but cool."" Also: ""Now that we're talkin' at it/ How the hell are we gonna pay for all your clothes?"" Marah have the infuriating ability to sketch scenes that actually bust hearts, such that it's impossible not to think that their romance-junkie tales wouldn't be better served by the above than by meaningless horseshit like ""Angels will rip your chest open/ And fill it with flowers."" This is, of course, a long-winded way of saying that Angels is a Marah album, which sort of sucks, but that ""Blue But Cool"" and ""Santos De Madera"" and the title track might still make you a little misty eyed and/or end up on a mixtape. More to the point, Angels will cause no one to forget Separation Sunday or even Kids in Philly.","Marah have been running sideways from indie rock trends for so long that they've stumbled into a scene-wide Bruce Springsteen love-in-- just as they start to sound least like the E Street Band.

A Mad & Faithful Telling,DeVotchKa,by: William Bowers,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b537ea9e61561daa6d96/1:1/w_160/3efd87ca.jpg,2008-03-19 05:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11298-a-mad-faithful-telling/,Anti-,"DeVotchKa's career bio is so unlikely that we pitiable reviewers usually have to indulge our inner allusion-making spazzes to give the impression that we're not just recasting the interesting facts from the band's press releases as zingers. I, for one, was going to utter something like, ""This band will be perfect to replace Jose Feliciano in the Celebrity Room scene when Guy Maddin remakes Fargo, setting it at the turn of an imaginary century."" See, right there, you get the exoticism, the uncouthness, the kitschy passion (or earnest camp?), the hint of menace, and the nostalgia so nonspecific that it seems forward-looking. Woodchipper-bound criminal Carl Showalter even (mis)references the work from which DeVotchKa's name derives, A Clockwork Orange, during that segment, when he tells his prostitute date he's only in town ""for a little of the old in-and-out."" Seriously, I can't compete: A professorial classical violinist. A sousaphone player from a Civil War recreation band. A punk-turned-mariachi-enthusiast drummer raised by polka musicians. A Gypsy-descendant singer more multi-instrumentalist than the other three band members that I just reductively identified according to their ""main"" pieces of equipment. DeVotchKa invented the Diablo Cody arc, as they've gone from accompanying burlesque/fetish shows to getting a Grammy nod, despite being unsigned at the time. Sire reportedly couldn't have them because parent company Warner thought them ""unmarketable""-- and yet they just no-thanxed an offer from McDonald's to feature their music in the ubiquitous carcass-merchant's, um, marketing. An odd byproduct of the band's matriculation to Anti- Records is realizing that one of their new labelmates already ""did"" their blend of oompah/Morricone/lounge/Latin/etc textures, though with an entirely different vocal approach: the arrangements on Tom Waits' late 1980s and early 90s Island work could be just as baroque. Nick Urata's croon, however, is, whew, like Caetano Veloso had a declamatory baby with each of the Traveling Wilburys. His intensity and, fuck it, beauty is probably what keeps the music's globe-groping cleverness from coming off as sorta quirque-du-soleil. I mean, Urata can sell impresario, lothario, and tragic romantic hero within a single track. Plus, the balanced, stately-but-dreamy production is pristine-- jams with urgent pulses á la the National/Constantines somehow feel nimble. The band adopts modes from several cultures' wedding- and-funeral traditions, yet never sounds simply ritualistic. Again, once Urata opens his trap, the proceedings immediately feel more the Cure than curated. But something mysteriously blocks this very good record from being great. I wanted it to inspire obsession, I wanted it to break my heart, I wanted its graceful fusion to borrow so freely from so many musical worlds that it achieved worldlessness. Maybe DeVotchKa's vibe is difficult to withstand for the duration of a long player. ""Head Honcho"", included here, is a revisitation of a song from the release on which they coined the term for their style: Supermelodrama. Stretching its sweetness out further than an EP can result in a new form of aesthetic torture: syrupboarding. (The two instrumentals kind of acknowledge that the listener might need a boutiquey break from how Urata's epic tremble-slur has the potential to make someone so manic that they'd practice ocular aversion to keep from believing that whoever's in their sightline is ""the one."") And the standard relationship-disillusionment lyrics are lacking. You get a (true, reckon) cliché about the winner of the rat race still being a rat, and bits such as ""You can bury it deep inside but you can never hide."" Worse, half of the songs hit such impressive peaks that the rest seem slight by comparison. But oh, those peaks-- buy this disc for ""Along the Way"", for ""Undone"", or just for the spooky dip of ""New World""'s eww/oohs. That these are the album's ballads might be testimony that what we have here is a group heartily willing to pen raucous romps for clubs and festivals while secretly wishing to go quiet.","A professorial classical violinist. A sousaphone player from a Civil War recreation band. A punk-turned-mariachi-enthusiast drummer raised by polka musicians. A Gypsy-descendant singer. So naturally, they were up for a Grammy.

Get Awkward,Be Your Own Pet,by: Nitsuh Abebe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b53613d197565213ac18/1:1/w_160/d55d0c3e.jpg,2008-03-19 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11297-get-awkward/,XLEcstatic Peace,"Be Your Own Pet's latest output includes two songs that give an indication of just how well these kids can grow. ""Becky"" (available only on XL's UK version of the album) has a faint girl-group tinge and a classic girl-group subject: It's an over the top best-friend break-up song, running from tears in the lunchroom and final demands (""Give me back all the clothes you borrowed/ Don't give me bullshit, bring them to school tomorrow"") to after-class ambushes and knife-fights in the halls. High-school snot, right? But then there's lead single ""The Kelly Affair"", which cribs from Beyond the Valley of the Dolls: Now it's the story of a hot young band, just arrived in Southern California and surrounded by high-rolling, pill-popping sex addicts. ""It could be dangerous,"" says singer Jemina Pearl, ""living in this valley."" But she sings it like someone who's not particularly worried, and smirks it out like someone who's hungry for a little of that danger. So Be Your Own Pet have graduated from high-school sass to world-conquering-- with a new drummer, no less-- without losing any of the lovable Muppet-like punk enthusiasm of their first record; they still come at you in a way that could probably make college kids feel ancient. On Get Awkward, the band has become a lot more precise, which always happens when you're developing your songs in a studio instead of just rampaging over crowds in bars. And what happens when you combine teenage punk, chops, and precision is, well, a little bit of glam: The guitar work here is still ten times rangier and more inventive than you'd expect, but it takes a few very professional steps back, nailing down its snappy flourishes amid ecstatic ""whoo!""s, new-wave poses, and occasional clouds of glitter and confetti. With the band members' ages now clustered somewhere around 20, that glam is still the fascinating thing about this act-- they're from what might be the first generation to see American hardcore punk not as a venue for intense, frustrated guys to scowl at the world, but for good-time kids to bounce around like insane teddy-bear rock stars. It's not as if Black Flag never indulged in happy gang chants about watching TV, but they never sounded as thrilled about it as this band does on ""Bummer Time"", let alone on the song about food fights (timeless chorus: ""Sucks to be the janitor!""). That's not to say that this album's half-hour running time doesn't sag in spots. Once you start sounding a little more slick, it can get hard to keep selling that rickety energy, song after song. And while Pearl's singing voice has developed beautifully, she has some nagging bad habits with the lyrics-- sometimes it's the kinds of rhymes that make you cringe once you pass legal drinking age, and sometimes it's the way she'll get stuck for subject matter and riff off whatever movie was on TV the night before. (""Bitches Leave"", a piece of girl-on-girl crime in that mid-album sag, jumps off from a line in Robocop but gets points for a great snarky aside about women trying to impress people by claiming to like anal sex.) It's a surprise, because some of her lyrics here are terrifically blunt and on-point, especially when she's singing about liking guys she shouldn't: ""Heart Throb"", the album's best song, may be addressed to the man in the title, but it feels more like she's coaching herself on how not to go boy-crazy when she's already with someone. That's what's less of a surprise: Pearl continues to make being young, blonde, awesome, zombie-obsessed, and in a cool band seem entirely relatable, like her rock heroism is genuinely on behalf of smart-ass misfit girls the whole country wide. When she's giving the kiss-off to that former best friend on ""Becky"", the guys in the band step up for some backing vocals, shouting ""We don't like Becky anymore!"" in unison. There's something in that, and in the three-song run of perfect enthusiasm near the start of this record, that makes it easy to look past any moments where the steam runs out: They might be out of high school, but these kids sound tight-knit and generous, exactly the kind of Muppety teenage punks you'd want to drink beer with and have backing you up in any knife-fights after homeroom.","Thurston Moore-supported teen punks lose the element of surprise on their sophomore album as they attempt to graduate from high-school sass to world-conquering.

Pop Ambient 2008,Various Artists,by: Andrew Gaerig,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b521b1335d7bf169a869/1:1/w_160/85a9ec29.jpeg,2008-03-18 05:00:04,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11279-pop-ambient-2008/,Kompakt,"Kompakt's Pop Ambient series is in some kind of impressive stasis. The label's prominence and a growing critical reputation have yet to elevate the awareness of the series to those not predisposed to German electronic music. But Pop Ambient 2007 offered the previously unthinkable: a breakout star. The Field's ""Kappsta"" was the standout track on PA07, nominally the album's least ambient tune but its most pop. ""Kappsta"" helped kick-start the Field's impressive 2007, a year highlighted by as much crossover indie success as a low-key sound architect could ever expect. If ever there were a year for the Pop Ambient series to stake a bigger foothold in the experimental and pop music consciousness, 2007 would've been it. It's perhaps with this missed opportunity in mind that Kompakt constructed Pop Ambient's 2008 edition, which with 10 of its 12 tracks provided by artists featured on last year's model (including, no joke, ""Kappsta 2"") is as much Pop Ambient 2007: II as an entirely new entry into the series. It's clear, though, that Pop Ambient is less a showcase for new talents and more an annual hello from the draftiest corners of Kompakt's roster. Pretty flowers, pretty tones, etc.: Pop Ambient volumes have always benefited from an homogeneity of tempo and wordless sprawl, such that they have always felt very ""album-y."" Elsewhere, the composers play with the seasons and sort of generally make good on the ornate foliage that adorns the cover: Klimek's ""The Ice Storm"" is the most aptly named track here, and perhaps the most dynamic as well. A string section waxes in and out of focus as a sharp, high-pitched melody plays over the top producing an effect not unlike William Basinski's looped orchestrations. DJ Koze provides a summery counterpoint with ""Nymphe Und Schäfer"", using a similar loop but placing it under vinyl crackle and an unobtrusive field recording of insects. Still, though, with the weight of seven preceding volumes on its shoulders, PA08 can't afford the uninspired soundwash of Ulf Lohman's ""My Pazifik"" or Popnoname's ""Fembria"". Pop Ambient has grown into a bit of institution, a haven for listeners dipping their toes into accessible ambient music or for dedicated electronic fans seeking calm water. PA08 does nothing to distract from this purpose, nor does it expand upon it. Stasis, right: Pop Ambient's glacial progression as a series mimics the ""nothing to see here folks, move along"" rallying cry of the artists it houses.","Kompakt's annual, too-overlooked ambient series picks up where it left off last year, with 10 of the same artists represented-- including the Field, Wolfgang Voigt, Markus Guentner, and Thomas Fehlmann.

To Serve With Love,Black Spade,by: Ben Westhoff,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b4ecb1335d7bf169a80c/1:1/w_160/6fce2994.jpg,2008-03-18 05:00:03,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11232-to-serve-with-love/,Om Hip Hop,"In the first half of the decade, rapper and producer Black Spade repped St. Louis crew Soul Tyde, that city's neo-soul answer to Wu-Tang Clan, maxing out at about 14 highly motivated members. Spade had been compiling solo album material since 1997, and even had a hit of sorts on local radio, ""2 Step"", but his album was delayed partly because he was boxed in by the group's overzealous leadership. He kept at it, however, and was eventually discovered by Om Records' brass at a Bay Area show he played in 2004. And now, 11 years after its inception, the 32-year-old MC's debut is finally out, squinting at the sun after having undergone major reconstructive surgery. Gone is its turn-of-the-century Like Water for Chocolate/Black Star vibe in favor of a fairly psychedelic, electronic overhaul that seems to draw as much influence from Radiohead as Common. (There's also reggae, r&b, soul, jazz, and even indie rock in there.) This is certainly for the better; To Serve With Love is that rare future-sounding, cohesive rap album that doesn't really feel like much else out there. Opener ""To Serve With Love (Intro)"" is a gleeful, quirky, off-beat, Kurzweil 2000-crafted electronic tune that shows off Spade's ample ability with a synthesizer. Spade produces all the tracks on this CD, sampling Cheech & Chong DVDs, Flora Purim, and even an uncredited song or two spun backward. Many were recorded in the St. Louis basement studios of Kenautis Smith, a mixer/beatmaker/magician who has produced for approximately every good MC in the lower Midwest (he now lives in Chicago), and the CD is brimming with current and former St. Louis underground talent, including Rockwell Knuckles, Wafeek, and three ex-Soul Tyde members: Coultrain, Spade's younger brother Tef Po, and Gotta Be Karim. Spade, who now spends part of his time in L.A. recording and enjoying the sunshine, also pays respect to his Big Muddy affiliation with a bit of Chingy-style slur on ""Not for the Bullshit"" (""I show you how to do that thurr/ Pay dues but no one currr/ See it's so unfurr.""). The album was named for the 1967 Sidney Poitier movie To Sir, With Love, and in total it's about Spade's loves-- of girls, friends, possessions, and weirdness, even when said love is destructive. But mostly it's about his endearment for music. This is not the most novel concept, and while one never doubts his sincerity the lyrics aren't quite as interesting as the tunes, full of cute but not really memorable turns like, ""I want to take from the rich and give to the poor/ So we can buy fly shit at the clothing store."" It really doesn't matter too much, though, because this is not a lyricists' album; it's barely even a hip-hop album. ""Everything's gonna be all right,"" he sings on ""Good Crazy"", ""everything's gonna be crazy."" Exactly.","Eleven years after its inception, the St. Louis MC's debut is finally out, squinting at the sun after having undergone major reconstructive surgery: Gone is its turn-of-the-century Black Star vibe in favor of a fairly psychedelic, electronic overhaul that seems to draw as much influence from Radiohead as Common.

Beat Pyramid,These New Puritans,by: Jason Crock,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b5339d034d5c69bf4fb0/1:1/w_160/0b7fc25f.jpg,2008-03-18 05:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11295-beat-pyramid/,Domino,"Whether you're a longtime fan of Joy Division or a booster of Bloc Party, there's much you'll find familiar on the debut LP of These New Puritans. But out of all the British bands still playing under the umbrella of post-punk, there's so much that TNP get right about the sound: scraps of syncopated guitars making the barest insinuations of melody, stiff electronic beats that sound like factory noise, and singer who barks excitedly but whose message is initially cryptic. The pattern suits them well and doesn't sound derivative or dated; that may be in part to this record owing as much to its heavy, ominous beats as its guitars or melody. ""Numerology (AKA Numbers)"" has a bludgeoning thump driving its layered keyboards and chicken-scratch guitars, while ""Doppelganger"" has atmospheric effects that would fit onto any Prefuse 73 record. Moreover, there aren't any wide-eyed ballads or snappy, ingratiating choruses here. These New Puritans come at their songs as if they were challenges presented to them and they write them to their own distinctive logic. It's simpler than it sounds: Finding just the right amount of verse to fit in 60 seconds on ""Swords of Truth"" or how much tension they can wrest from (and how long they can get away with playing) one open note on ""Elvis"". Rather than verse to chorus and back, the songs seem like chunks of raw riffage and misbehaving machinery sewn together, their sleek edges fitting perfectly. Electronic interludes flow expertly between the tracks, never sounding extraneous, while the songs themselves are full of jagged transitions, like the percussive rant of ""C 16th"" or the seething patchwork of ""Colours"": A flurry of drums into a strutting chorus and simmering bridge section. Meanwhile, lyrics bleed from one song to the other, melodies and themes are recycled, titles blur into each other-- the album is almost remixing itself as it moves along, adding to its chaotic overall feel. Tantalizing advance singles ""En Papier"" and ""Elvis"" are both here, with ""En Papier"" veering between from winding guitar licks to anchorless electronic textures, and ""Elvis"" maybe the album's most insistent track-- its tension and release is much simpler than many of the other tracks, but the chorus is monstrous, as is the payoff. They're among the album's best, but they don't outshine the rest, and Beat Pyramid proves to be an affirming and promising first step. The mystery and paranoia are mostly communicated through the music rather than the heavy repetition of the lyrics, with their questions about numbers and sums of money coming through in impatient monotones. Making a genre that's become a bankable prospect sound earnest and exciting is no easy feat; hopefully the next step is finding room for some more trenchant messages along with it.","Despite the number of British bands still playing under the umbrella of post-punk this decade, there's still so much TNP get right about the sound: scraps of syncopated guitars making the barest insinuations of melody, stiff electronic beats that sound like factory noise, and a singer who barks excitedly but whose message is initially cryptic.

This Year's Model: Deluxe Edition,Elvis Costello,by: Matt LeMay,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b51eb1335d7bf169a862/1:1/w_160/2b977c76.jpg,2008-03-18 05:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11276-this-years-model-deluxe-edition/,InterscopeRhinoHip-O,"So before I get into the necessary nitpicking, let me just say: holy shit, this album. Pop music is seldom this fierce and purposeful, rock music seldom this melodic and thoughtful. This Year's Model is fully realized in style and substance, both unique and unassuming. You can tell an Elvis Costello song from melody alone, but the arrangements and performances offered up by the attractions are no less distinctive and recognizable. There is not a single bad song on This Year's Model, and the one moment on the record that kind of goes clunk (the opening line of ""Lip Service"") still gets stuck in my head all the time. If you don't own a copy of this record, you should... ...seek out the cheaper, better (and sadly out-of-print) Rhino reissue. Sorry, folks. This Year's Model itself is a 10.0 in most any context as far as I'm concerned, but reviewing a value-added ""deluxe"" edition warrants an interrogation of, uh, the added value. A thoughtful, reasonably priced, and only-six-year-old 2xCD version of this album is no longer available new, and Universal's latest ""deluxe"" reissue feels bloated and dubious by comparison. Going through the bonus tracks in detail is almost entirely fruitless here; every single extra included on the first disc of this reissue was also available on the Rhino edition (with the exception of the excellent ""Tiny Steps"", which was included on Rhino's Armed Forces). Three good bonus tracks versions from Rhino's reissue are omitted here, leaving this reissue with only the live disc to recommend it. Thankfully, this time around it actually does. A complete concert recording from a 1978 show in Washington, D.C. fills out the second disc nicely. The recording lacks the crackling frenzy of the classic Live at El Mocambo recording, or even the enlightening tenuousness of the Nashville Rooms show included on Universal's My Aim Is True reissue. Simply put, it comes off as an average night on tour for a spectacular band, marked by a few stray sour notes and chords but still nothing short of inspiring. Perhaps owing to their position after that ampersand, the Attractions still don't really get their due as one of rock and roll's truly great bands, and this live recording shows Elvis Costello and the Attractions as an inseparable and forceful group, not a songwriter and his backing band. Does a good live recording of a great band warrant dropping $25 on a reissue? So there you have it-- plus one for a better live disc, minus one for zero new bonus material. This looks and feels like a ""deluxe"" version, for sure, but lacks the curated and cared-for feel (and the liners, provided by Costello himself) of the Rhino reissue. Indeed, the problem with this ""deluxe"" series so far isn't that it's poorly conceived, or poorly designed, but rather it feels so generic and uninspired, right down to (and, yes, I will mention this in the review of every single reissue from this series) the ad for ""ELVIS COSTELLO RINGTONES"" in the back of the liners. This Year's Model is a sharp and brilliant album, rife with wit and cynicism; it's hard not to be put off by a reissue whose last words are ""RINGTONES ARE FOR PURCHASE ONLY, NOT PART OF EXCLUSIVE COMPLIMENTARY BONUS MATERIAL.""","One of the greatest albums in rock history is reissued...again. This time it features no new bonus studio material and is bloated by an OK live disc and a hefty new price tag.

IV,Chatham County Line,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a174ea9e61561daa47e4/1:1/w_160/d42b42bc.jpg,2008-03-18 05:00:00,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11236-iv/,Yep Roc,"Chatham County Line recorded their second album, Route 23, gathered around one microphone, letting the natural tendencies of sound waves in air take care of mixing for them. Their process hasn't gotten a whole lot more complicated since then. Though the microphones have proliferated in the studio, they still record their harmony-heavy bluegrass in live takes, and apart from the occasional steel guitar, it's all acoustic. Producer Chris Stamey, known for well-produced power pop, both on his own and with the dB's, basically lets them do their thing, keeping the sound basic and earthy with just a few choice overdubs. Dave Wilson's songwriting has a very distinctive harmonic feel-- his chord sequences seem chosen for their relative lack of resolution, and the banjo, mandolin, fiddle, and guitar parts seem to float around on the rhythm. Opener ""Chip of a Star"" is even kind of spacey, with bassist Greg Readling's pedal steel additions heightening the song's cosmic country feel. Wilson also has his moments lyrically. ""Country Boy/City Boy"" isn't quite the typical boosterism for the rural life you hear on albums like this-it's really more about how we all wish we could experience another life. ""If I was a country boy, I'd wish for the city lights/ If I was a city boy, I'd wish for a quiet night,"" he sings, taking the air out of the country/city divide that modern country music plays so heavily on. Outside of Wilson's strengths as a songwriter, he simply has the right voice for the music, a soft tenor with a bit of a twang and accent that never fails to be melodic. Even on ""Birmingham Jail"", a darker, more intense song than any of the ones around it he dips and dodges around John Teer's searing fiddle part with ease. That sense of interplay between the band members is evident all over. The dynamics of the gently bouncing ""The Carolinia"" feel natural and unstudied, with the mandolin and banjo practically having a conversation around the lead vocal. The band lets that interplay loose on banjoist Chandler Holt's brief instrumental ""Clear Blue Sky"", a too-brief showcase for the band's old-time mountain music leanings. The other instrumental, ""Paige"", is a gorgeous mandolin fantasia by Teer that owes a little something to Bach is its delicate chords. IV is the most rewarding offering from Chatham County Line to date. It's a little bit bigger and a little more elaborate than its predecessors, but it's an incremental step toward something more expansive. It still retains the best elements of the band's music-- its separation from the moment. This music isn't a product of its era, but nor is it married to a bygone one. It's essentially timeless, both in terms of era and when I find I can listen to it. That's a quality any band would be happy to claim.",,7.4,
Sleep Forever,The Big Sleep,by: Adam Moerder,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b4e6ea9e61561daa6d0c/1:1/w_160/0309ed3e.jpg,2008-03-17 05:00:04,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11227-sleep-forever/,Frenchkiss,"The joke I'm hearing is that this band's not named after the classic Raymond Chandler crime novel but rather the soporific effect produced by the Brooklyn trio's ho-hum post-rock. That's a little mean, but I can't help feeling equally frustrated (and sleepy) when I find that, two albums into their career, the Big Sleep still haven't fully harvested the crop of mind-blowing music they take half-hearted stabs at emulating. Unlike so many other similarly knowledgable bands, the Sleep's fatal flaw isn't poor taste or a sycophantic rehashing of their influences-- they just need a shot in the arm, something to remind them of the power of rocking out. Sleep Forever, like its predecessor Son of the Tiger, contains mostly instrumental tracks, an odd move considering that the band's most notable songs have used vocals. Riding the momentum from Tiger standout ""Murder"", this album's highlight ""Bad Blood"" follows the Pretty Girls Make Graves formula to similar success, with bassist Sonya Balchandan's vocals remaining icy despite the searing guitar riffs and chugging percussion accompanying her. Coupled with ""Pinkies"", a head-in-clouds dream pop song somewhere between TV on the Radio and Coldplay, these two melodic tracks constitute the crux of Sleep Forever. Excepting the impressive two-minute powder keg ""Tigers in our Hearts"", the rest of Sleep Forever struggles to maintain a pulse-- a desired quality only when they shoegaze. Drone instrumental ""Slow Race"", for example, smacks of Mogwai's ""Like Herod"", and the filching's worsened by a ""climactic"" guitar line that predictably walks down the scale. The tragically named ""Chorus of Guitars"" buckles even more, attempting to build a wall of sound with a flimsy piano line and languishing, scattershot vocals. Lacking the necessary grandeur to pull off godlike post-rock, the band mines some instrumental gems when they set their sights on more nuanced numbers. The cartoonish swagger of ""The Big Guns"" sounds like the Octopus Project 'roid raging-- not tough enough to soundtrack an actual fight, but perfectly suitable playing in a Double Dragon stage. The latin-inspired acoustic ballad ""Little Sister"" represents an even bolder experiment, and while they don't quite pull it off the track succeeds as a welcome changeup. Unfortunately the Big Sleep is faced with the problem of mystifying a doomsday post-rock sound that's very familiar to fans of the genre, and it's a fight they're often not up for. Despite its slightly more diverse palette, Sleep Forever merely dabbles in more styles rather than explores them, and as soon as their creative finger slips off the pleasure button, it's hard to resist from dozing.","Brooklyn post-rock trio offers another collection of mostly instrumental tracks, an odd move considering that the band's most notable songs have used vocals.

The Last Sucker,Ministry,by: Brandon Stosuy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b50e5e6ef959693226ef/1:1/w_160/27776c64.jpg,2008-03-17 05:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11264-the-last-sucker/,Megaforce13th Planet,"Al Jourgensen hates George W. Bush. And Dick Cheney. Hell, republicans in general. The Last Sucker, Ministry's 11th and ""last"" studio album, as well as the final piece in his anti-Bush trilogy that also includes 2004's Houses of the Molé and 2006's Rio Grande Blood, makes that pretty clear. Again. The subject matter of the 11 tracks should be familiar territory for Ministry fans or anyone who's attended a collegiate anti-war rally-- typical, tame anti-Bush shit, but Jourgensen sounds so angry, it hardly matters what he's ranting about. Like, you don't need to give a shit about Satan to get into Marduk or Gorgoroth-- it's the bleak, intense atmosphere that's conjured. The Last Sucker does have powerful sonic moments. The amped Texas two-step of ""Let's Go""'s like an updated ""Jesus Built My Hotrod"", despite an incredibly goofy vocal sample. The guitar parts on it are intense. The fuzzed bass and nu metal chops of ""Watch Yourself""-- divorced from the ""Big Brother"" theme-- has some chunky riffs and head-wagging grooves. And it is pretty rousing when Jourgensen shouts, ""There's no running away/ This is the U.S.A."" Likely because it sounds like it could be a chant that means a thousand different things. The non-specificity works. One of the best tracks, ""Die in a Crash"", maintains whiplash intensity throughout, upping it a tad for an ""I can feel it/ I can feel the pressures of this life"" chorus that, as I write this, should be going over well in gymnasiums everywhere. Jourgensen also turns in a fun cover of ""Roadhouse Blues"", which is prefaced by an ""All I wanna do is get my kicks before this whole shithouse goes up in flames."" And get his ""kicks"" he does. The percussive ""Death & Destruction"" pieces together Bush's creepy laugh (sounding very devilish) and a bunch of samples from the big guy that fit with and echo the title. Then Jourgensen puts his back into it. ""The Last Sucker"" is another catchy tune that traces Bush-- ""I never studied but I got my degree/ I didn't need to with my family tree""-- in all the usual ways. The best example of the weak content destroying an otherwise enjoyable track is ""The Dick Song""-- explosive musically, but the dorky samples and ""run run run Cheney's got a gun"" chorusing feel like a ""Saturday Night Live"" sketch. On the other hand, samples are put to good use on ""No Glory"", which discusses the pointlessness of the war in Iraq, punctuating the buzzing instrumentation with a-capella spoken ""greed,"" ""power,"" and ""corruption."" It creates a dynamic, instead of stealing the band's thunder. In the end, though, The Last Sucker goes out in a blaze of glory, largely because the last three songs are also the album's best. First is the aforementioned ritalin-chomping ""Die in a Crash"" and then ""End of Days"", Parts I and II. Fear Factory's Burton Christopher Bell adds vocals to all three. The two ""End of Days"" tracks are a combined 14 minutes long. The first part is more of the nu-metal, Bell howling and barking angrily: ""Judgment day's upon us and I see no one cares,"" etc. Kinda sounds like Fear Factory. The second is a long, somber, meditation on the end of things. The vocal part is kinda Vincent Price-in-""Thriller""-- and there's a fucking kid's choir! Threaded into the end of the piece, too, is Eisenhower's well-known farewell speech. Pretend it's Jourgensen speaking, because it is: End of Bush, end of the world, end of Ministry. It's his State of the Union. The last words conjured by Ministry before Eisenhower checks the mic are ""Face down on pavement and drunk at the end of my days/ The end of days."" Defusing the pomp, it's a suitable ending to an overblown exeunt. Otherwise, The Last Sucker isn't as huge as Psalm 69, but it is Ministry's most exciting record since. Just don't go into it thinking you'll get any astute politicizing -- but then, that's not what we go to Ministry for, right? And, as tear-jerky as the finale is, this isn't the end for Uncle Al! A covers collection called Cover Up-- with takes on the Stones, Beatles, and others-- should be out soon. And he's basically halting Ministry so he can spend time building the stable at his label, 13th Planet, a subsidiary of Megaforce. Plus, the final tour-- the he ""C-U-LaTour""-- includes Meshuggah as a supporting act. So, even if you're showing up to theater to see the Swedish tech-metal gods bring their brilliant, apocalyptic obZen to life, Ministry should have some new jams to keep you interested. Though I imagine the between-song bantor could get pretty painful.","Ministry's 11th and ""last"" studio album, is also the final piece in Al Jourgensen's anti-Bush trilogy, which also includes 2004's Houses of the Molé and 2006's Rio Grande Blood.

Overture: Live in Nippon Yusen Soko 2006,Ghost,by: Roque Strew,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b516b1335d7bf169a854/1:1/w_160/34e8f4a5.jpg,2008-03-17 05:00:02,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11270-overture-live-in-nippon-yusen-soko-2006/,Drag City,"The Japanese band Ghost are the hippies and the ashram rolled into one. They are at once the seekers and the source of mysterious, mystical art. Led from from tattered subways to temple rubble, flutes to feedback, by their guru Masaki Batoh, their constant motion also allows them to easily elude the reviewer's labels. Not surprisingly, they get lumped in with the psychedelic rockers. It is easy to forget that, before Ghost's stylings puffed over the Pacific like a bloom of hashish smoke, an Eastern echo of King Crimson and Cluster, these six artists chased after a different form of transcendence: improvisation. Overture: Live in Nippon Yusen Soko 2006, their first entirely improvised release, draws a sharper picture of these early days. Actually, it is multimedia: apocalyptic Powerpoint rather than nostalgic Polaroid. (There were even projectors at the venue.) A Yokohama warehouse for mailboats, now an art gallery, lent the eerily vacant, urban-cavern space proper to a Ghost show. Each of the members stood behind tall curtains, veiled from the audience and from each other. A reverent silence was the rule. ""Once the door is closed,"" the crowd was told, ""you cannot enter or exit the space until the performance is ended."" And the boom of the iron door shutting is the record's first sound. As soon as that crash rumbles outward, trailed by a moment of quiet, we sense how perfectly the acoustic properties of the warehouse suit the band's art. That expanse, that tangible nothingness, is more than negative space. It envelops you like the clouds and waves wrap around Winslow Homer's lonely boaters, making them somehow lonelier and that loneliness more heroic. Likewise when Michio Kurihara lays siege to the venue's architectural emptiness with his electric guitar, it feels like a struggle against cosmic emptiness. Ultimately that is the mood of Overture. While it does feel introspective, this wandering inward is no cakewalk: it is a bumpy travel through turmoil and discord and nonstop tension. Every element seems to partake in this shakiness. Cymbals and shakers tinkle in the shadows, a steady radiation of yellow-wallpaper delirium that never quite lets up. Meanwhile, battling out center stage, you always find a brilliant rivalry of sensibility. Taishi Takizawa's saxophone reels out these stretched-out ribbons of film-noir sadness, for instance, which calmly coexist with Kazuo Ogino's lute as a union of the country and the city, the forest and the dark alley. Any instrument, any musician, can go from Dr. Jekyll to Mr. Hyde without warning. One minute, Takizawa's playing is sober and serene; the next it assumes a frantic, trash-compacted quality that is nearer in spirit to free jazz. The same goes for Ogino's piano improvisations, which unfold without drama at many points, only to incarnate it, in full-on Max Steiner mode, at others. While it may not push the band's aesthetic forward, Overture serves as a document of the band's astonishing evolution. Batoh has drafted the old gang, from Takizawa to Ogino to Kurihara, and recreated the searching, schizophrenic vibe of their self-titled debut. Beyond merely evoking their beginnings, the record follows their restless quest for a higher consciousness: from the idyllic, acid-folk woodwinds and finger-picking to the more brooding and hypnotic Krautrock rhythms, rewinding all the way back to the AMM order and Colemanesque chaos of their jam-session roots. Overture may not attract long-time fans, who have already experienced this variety. Nevertheless, even at 56 minutes, this is a warp-speed tour of Ghost's 20-year history of genre bending and blending.","The Japanese psych band's first entirely improvised release draws a sharper picture of these early days, before they sounded like an Eastern echo of King Crimson and Cluster.

Crystal Castles,Crystal Castles,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b4d8c0084474cd0c2327/1:1/w_160/75b8c461.jpg,2008-03-17 05:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11215-crystal-castles/,Last Gang,"Crystal Castles prefer traveling light. While the hotly-tipped and already hotly-contested Toronto duo's basement party set-up doesn't look like it'll fill up the passenger seat on a tour van, they also like to play fast and loose with their associations. They've remixed at a Hot Chip-like pace for everyone from Bloc Party to Uffie to Klaxons, but they're not a part of your nu-rave genre (really, who is?), or blog house for that matter. Their debut LP partly picks from 7"" and 12""s that have been available in some format since 2005, and it's every bit as difficult to pin down. The lead track samples DFA 1979's ""Dead Womb"" and places those vocals atop a cyclical synth loop while they get disembodied and chopped up-- both function as song-length hooks. But the thing's called ""Untrust Us"" (natch) and by the next one, they're making good on that claim. ""Alice Practice"" absolutely sears with megaphoned (emphasis on mega) barking and Ethan Fawn's Atari-laced keyboards going on the fritz and racking up free plays. Ah, so this is what an arcade fire sounds like. They don't stay in one place for too long, but the body of the album can be distilled to an essence of the glassy, ten-lane stare of Last Exit with Ed Banger's egg-frying EQ. Well, except when it sounds more like ""Alice Practice"" (""Xxzcuzx Me"" and ""Knights"" are a bit interchangeable in their diminishing returns). Whether it's a thank you or challenge to everyone they've worked with, Crystal Castles opens up endless remix possibilities. Though hardly minimal, there's plenty to easily pick apart and work with-- ""Good Time"" is a veritable toybox with undulating octaves, an almost Eastern-sounding riff and tweaked nice-guy vocals which combine the Knife and New Order. Even if you can't really make out the words, the call-and-response chant of ""Courtship Dating"" glows amidst fizzy synths and Triple 6 drum clicks. And ""Crimewave (Crystal Castles vs. HEALTH)"", is a collaboration with the LA noisemongers that builds from now-retro electroclash to a clattering mix of drums. Just when you think you've gotten your paragraph-long blurb ready for the internet's approval, the last two tracks offer a bait and switch; the mad dash of ""Black Panther"" is probably what nu-rave was supposed to sound like (the Goth! Team?), and then the record ends on a disquietingly beautiful shoegaze comedown played on an acoustic guitar of all things (""Tell Me What to Swallow""). That they play such hide and seek musically should've come as no surprise anyway; despite the fact that there's literally an Atari game named ""Crystal Castles"", they named themselves after a She-Ra playset, which is like finding out LeBron James chose to wear uniform number at #23 as a tribute to his favorite Jimmy Eat World song. Then again, it's fitting for a record that draws so much of its power from unpredictability.","In-demand remixers with an armful of much-loved singles, the hotly-tipped and hotly-contested Crystal Castles don't stay in one place for too long on their debut LP.

Street Horrrsing,Fuck Buttons,by: Marc Masters,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b522b1335d7bf169a86c/1:1/w_160/c57b279b.jpg,2008-03-17 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11280-street-horrrsing/,ATP,"Floating around the internet last fall before emerging on a 7"" in November, Fuck Buttons' ""Bright Tomorrow"" proved surprisingly resilient. The duo's blunt repetition of simple elements-- metronomic drum-machine, chugging synth, blissful keyboard, and distorted screams-- seems like a formula for tedium. But the song somehow gets stronger with each replay. For a noise group, Fuck Buttons are surprisingly welcoming-- for noise music, anyway-- and their mix of dreamy melody and abrasive climax evokes strange stylistic bedfellows: Yo La Tengo and Ministry, My Bloody Valentine and Prurient, Spacemen 3 and Black Dice. ""Bright Tomorrow"" wasn't the web's first glimpse of Fuck Buttons, or even of this album: Street Horrrsing was available for free from the band's website (under a since-forgotten alternate title) when Pitchfork first wrote about the duo in Forkcast more than a year ago. But with the record now seeing official release, anyone hoping for an LP-length version of ""Bright Tomorrow"" will not be disappointed. For 50 minutes spread across six tracks, Fuck Buttons craft hypnotic patterns with the same set of sonic tools (plus live-sounding drums, in tribal Boredoms-meets-Animal Collective mode). Long chords drift over oscillating tones and pounding beats. Simple figures build slowly into cresendos punctuated by fiery howls. Sounds and ideas repeat constantly, yet Street Horrrsing never feels redundant. The key to how Fuck Buttons pull this off lies in their creative origins: Brits Andrew Hung and Benjamin John Power formed the group in 2004 with the goal of creating pain-inducing noise music, but soon became curious about mixing in prettier sounds, and adding structure and melody to their brutal tracks. Still, they never lost the aggression and abstraction of their noise leanings: They're not afraid to let a beat pound forever, or let a drone wash slowly, or let a pedal loop endlessly. Where more traditional groups might worry that a part goes on too long, Fuck Buttons seem fascinated by what will happen if it does, riding it just past the point of expectation before hitting you with the next big switch-up. It's a trick that gives Street Horrrsing a sense of constant tension, with another surprise detonation always looming around the corner. The album begins with ""Sweet Love For Planet Earth"", whose sparkly synths and pulsing drone bring to mind Gang Gang Dance's starry-eyed explorations. The patient power of that track courses through the rest of this seamless record. It's in the drum circles and chants of ""Ribs Out"", the chopping drift of ""Okay, Let's Talk About Magic"", and the blown-out metal vocals of ""Race You To My Bedroom/Spirit Rise"", which seem to make time melt away. Throughout, Fuck Buttons stick religiously to simple ideas, but mix them in surprising ways. When you expect a scream to burst forward, a synth figure slides in, or a bass rumbles up from the background. Still, the duo's signature is devout repetition. And by the time the loops of album closer ""Colours Move"" finally dissolve, Street Horrrsing has become one big loop itself-- an unbroken sonic circle.","Fuck Buttons came together in 2004 to create pain-inducing noise music, but soon became curious about mixing in prettier sounds, adding structure and melody to their brutal tracks.

City of Microphones,The Exit Strategy,by: Jason Crock,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b4e5b1335d7bf169a7fe/1:1/w_160/f8617148.jpg,2008-03-14 06:00:05,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11226-city-of-microphones/,One Percent Press,"The ever-present guitars and tight, unpredictable rhythms on the Exit Strategy's latest cover familiar ground, to be sure, but the band play it as if they're not only excited, but also privileged to have the chance to nod to their heroes. As soon as one pushes play, a forceful drumroll paves the way for a fade in of cascading quick strums, but it's a fake-out for the beefier, syncopated strut of ""X-Rays"". Its lyrics are vague (""performing research, performing X-rays from A to Z""), but the hook is broad and quickly ingratiating, and the ominous full-band patter of the bridge is where the Exit Strategy flash a little instrumental muscle. More manic Muppet Show drums bring in ""Addition by Subtraction"", along with a properly snaky guitar line and a breathless tempo throughout. There are some obvious references in the songs on Fear of Microphones, but the Exit Strategy, rather than revive any one band or scene's particular sound, nod to any band that they likely grew up on. There's a line between staying varied trying to sound like more than a few bands at once, and it's that balancing act that here keeps the Exit Strategy from asserting any real personality of their own. Take the first few moments of ""Motorcade"", which is essentially what the opening of Jawbox's ""Savory"" would sound like if sped up from 33 to 45 rpm-- bear in mind that J. Robbins actually recorded this album, so playing it in front of him must have taken, as the Brits say, considerable cheek. Still, ""Motorcade"" is the track where the band lays all it's cards on the table: working up a tense and furious rhythm in the verses, alternating quickly between clipped octaves and wide-armed strums, and soon adding whole new counterpoint from the guitar, they pile on the changes and make three minutes feel a whole lot longer. But while the Exit Strategy take a bite off of Jawbox or name one of their songs after a familiar XTC lyric (turn your monitor upside down at the end of this review to read the answer!), they make these offhand references without bringing the same studiousness to their own sound. Despite the energy of the first three tracks, ""System of Youth"" aims for the woozy lurch that bands like the Jesus Lizard were so good at, and makes an awkward fit for the Exit Strategy. Elsewhere, the full stops in ""What the Fuck is Low Art?"" nod to Fugazi's ""Repeater"", though you may be distracted by the singer's strange accents on every other syllable, getting higher each time, like singing can stave off his narcolepsy. Singer Mark Constantino has a brighter, almost cheerful voice that suits songs like the opener just fine, and adds a youthful, spirited feel to many of these tracks. But his refrains can be just silly (""X-Rays""; ""The First The Finest The Future""), and it's awkward to hear him adopt a neurotic talk/sing style on ""Judas Kiss"". The band keeps things interesting, the rhythm section especially-- while the punk discipline and dub-leaning ear of Fugazi is a clear influence, they actually do a fair impersonation, adding double-time on the early songs like ""Addition by Subtraction"" or a global flavor to the bridge of ""Judas Kiss"". There's really no need to mimic or steal when your band is clearly capable of subtlety. ""All Circuits Are Dead"" features some of the same spring-like guitar work as Don Caballero, but in this song and in the the album's best moments, the band has the momentum to make up any lack of originality. The Exit Strategy aren't really concerned with changing the face of the musical landscape, and that's fine.

Autumn Response,Richard Youngs,by: Douglas Wolk,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b5009d034d5c69bf4f5a/1:1/w_160/33c2d18b.jpg,2008-03-14 06:00:04,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11249-autumn-response/,Jagjaguwar,"Richard Youngs has made so many records, both on his own and with collaborators, that it's tempting to hear each new release from him as a sort of checking-in. But he's also a fine and patient formalist, most of whose work is built on formal constraints; a typical Youngs record from his Jagjaguwar era is an extended exploration of a particular idea, usually meditative and melodic, ""singer-songwriter"" music from a distance but rather more peculiar when you pay close attention. Before long, the second voice deviates a little from what the first is singing, or sings a different note or two, or a single voice may actually be enhanced by delay and echo. ""One Hundred Stranded Horses"" introduces a third voice, interrupting the first two mid-verse to interject a few related lines of its own. ""How many horses in the wood?"" Youngs sings. ""How many running free? How many horses are in the bay, and how many on TV?"" (The song was written in 2006, too early to be a response to M.I.A.'s ""Boyz"", but you can sing it to the same tune if you like.) These songs are more or less of a piece-- Youngs' lyrics are evocative but nonspecific (""sound through the night and the color of day""), and he repeats and shuffles individual phrases, sometimes altering them a little, weighing each one for its value. As usual, Youngs takes his time getting where he's going, playing simple repeating riffs and creeping forward to the next chord whenever it pleases him. The guitar part to ""Paths in the City"" is nothing more than a five-note figure, duplicated hundreds of times (by hand, or digitally? it's hard to tell) and scattered in clumps until it sounds like a bizarre set of wind chimes. The shortest song here is under a minute and a half long; the longest, the concluding ""Something Like Air"", is more than 16 minutes long, and doesn't seem appreciably longer. By the end of that final piece, Youngs' voices have diverged from each other almost completely in words and tone, as if the song they're singing is no longer the same. It's a static record, even by Youngs' standards, but its near-stasis is the source of its loveliness. You can let it run its duration, hearing the slow moiré patterns rippling over its surface while you wait for something to happen, or you can focus on it and be swept away by how alive and complicated those ripples are.","Latest Jagjaguwar release from Richard Youngs is constructed around what might be some kind of divided-consciousness metaphor, with the singer's voice and acoustic guitar overdubbed and sounding like they were recorded in the old Sun studio.

The LK vs. the Snow,The LK,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b4e4c0084474cd0c233d/1:1/w_160/352a1039.jpg,2008-03-14 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11225-the-lk-vs-the-snow/,KoraPOLKoraPOL,"According to their website, the full name of Malmø, Sweden's the LK is The Love of Kevin, Colour, Chaos and the Sound of K (no word on how to say that in Swedish). This ungainly phrase, wisely abbreviated for general use, seems like an oblique reference to member Lindefelt's synaesthesia, which causes him to mentally associate colors with timbres. Synaesthesia's one of those weird brain glitches that seems like it could actually be cool to have, though I imagine that for those afflicted, the novelty value of being able to see sounds isn't quite as apparent. Lindefelt's partner in the LK, Fredrik, can't see sounds, but is apparently a good chef. Both men have their own projects-- Fredrik's is a band called Fredrik, and Lindefelt performs solo electroacoustic shows with his cello-- but together they make some pretty awesome synth-pop. The music has a spiky immediacy, with Lindefelt's vocals way up front, backed by sharp beats and electronic collages. Fredrik's guitar and Fender Rhodes provides the harmonic structure, but the timbres of the instruments are rounded off and subsumed into the overall texture. It's a sound superficially similar to the Cansecos and Russian Futurists. The key to the album's infectiousness, though, lies not so much in the vocals as in the bouncy basslines that percolate at the bottom of the songs. ""Tamagotchi Freestyle"" rides one of these , a disco-worthy descending phrase that perfectly backs up the instrumental hook, which Fredrik swaps between guitar and cornet. The lyrics mercifully skip any references to the once-ubiquitous digi-pets of the title in favor of calls to burn Elvis alive, and the immolation of a pop icon has never sounded quite this appealing. I would've called ""Tamagotchi Freestyle"" a standout, but frankly by that standard half the album would be standouts. In addition to being a good pop record, it's a good details record-- dig the echoing pings and odd, watery guitar tone on closer ""Yellow Ribbons"", for instance. ""Stop Being Perfect"" has a great verse melody to set up the chorus, but the bed of electronic tones that worms its way through the beat is just as interesting. Then there are the staccato blasts the underpin the beginning of ""Private Life of a Cat""-- what are they made of? It sounds like guitar and trumpet and white noise all smashed together to make one sound. And speaking of cats, one of mine was completely freaked out by the way the backing vocals on ""Eurovision"" are injected into the song. He was convinced the sound was coming from someone in the room. The album hits a bit of a lull toward the end, with a few slow tracks that don't grab with nearly the force of their neighbors, but overall The LK Vs. the Snow is a sharp collection of songs that keeps pulling me back for more.","Duo from Malmø, Sweden makes catchy, sophisticated, and infectious electro-pop.

Ego Trippin',Snoop Dogg,by: Tom Breihan,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b51f9d034d5c69bf4f8a/1:1/w_160/e8c715a1.jpg,2008-03-14 06:00:02,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11277-ego-trippin/,Geffen,"Snoop Dogg was more famous for being famous than for rapping long before the E! network gave him a reality show. His pimp persona hardened into shtick at least a decade ago, and music has felt like an afterthought for him ever since he embarked on an endless run of stoner-comedy cameos. The dangerous urgency and viciously charismatic lean of his early Doggystyle peak are distant memories. And yet he's somehow managed to evolve into a model of gangsta consistency, a sort of rap version of Tom Petty or Alan Jackson. He cranks out lazy, effortless hits at a scary clip, slightly tweaking his formula as the musical climate changes without ever leaving his comfort zone. On ""Neva Have 2 Worry"", the fifth track of his ninth album, Snoop reminds us that he ""ain't never went gold""; every one of those previous eight albums sold a million copies. Those numbers are worldwide, not domestic, but still. He's doing something right. ""Neva Have 2 Worry"" is a lean autobiographical track, but it's not a frustrated emo-memoir like Nas' ""Last Real Nigga Alive"" or Bun B's ""The Story"". Snoop doesn't do self-disclosure. Rather than giving us inside glimpses of his triumphs and failures, Snoop calmly recites his accomplishments, taking quick pauses to remind us of his murder trial and to defend himself from accusations of misogyny by kicking more misogyny. We don't learn anything from ""Neva Have 2 Worry"", but it sounds great: Snoop's craggy sing-song purr sinking deep into his own lush, smooth, low-key track. It doesn't reward close attention, but it fills the air beautifully. That's true of almost all of Ego Trippin'. Snoop says basically nothing new over the course of the album's way-excessive 21 tracks, but he usually sounds good saying it, and the expansive, expensive production gives him the sort of luxuriant bed that few rappers can afford anymore. First single ""Sexual Eruption"" might find Snoop cooing though one of T-Pain's vocoders and extolling the virtues of bedtime reciprocity, but those tweaks are subtle; it's not like Snoop is diving headlong into feminism or electro. Rather, the slight, unremarkable track seems to exist mostly as an excuse for its retro-VHS video than as a song in its own right. That video is the best thing Snoop's done in years, a better vehicle for his sly, self-aware persona than any of the songs on this album. And yet there's something encouraging about endless confidence and professionalism on display here. In a time when the rap industry is in serious money-drain tumult, Snoop sounds as unperturbed as ever, and better for it. Many of the tracks on Ego Trippin' come from some iteration of the newly-formed QDT, a production trio of Snoop, new jack swing architect and former Blackstreet frontman Teddy Riley, and g-funk architect and former convict DJ Quik. All of these guys are pros, and it's great to hear Snoop using his enviable position to play patron to those two underrated pop veterans. Quik's beat for ""Press Play"" is all fluid soul-rap, its Isley Brothers sample twittering gorgeously over its rippling guitars and horn-stabs. And on ""SD Is Out"", Riley somehow pulls off the neat trick of crafting a lush snap beat, its spare production absolutely at home in its pillowy layers of bass and vocoders. But tracks as pretty as these can't erase the sad reality that Snoop is running through trite pimp-life clichés for the billionth time, talking about macking hoes with Leonardo DiCaprio and never quite sounding enthused about the women he's reportedly fucking. Even the love song he dedicates to his wife turns out to be more about Snoop's globe-trotting exploits than anything resembling actual sentiment. So it comes as a relief whenever Snoop deviates from his usual talking-points to give us the odd stylistic curveball. And those curveballs can often be pretty great on their own merits, as when Snoop covers the Time's Minneapolis new-wave funk manifesto ""Cool"", singing in a self-obsessed whine about diamonds on his toes while Riley faithfully recreates the original's Princely synths. And then there's the utterly inexplicable country-fried ""My Medicine"", which Snoop dedicates to ""my main man Johnny Cash, a real American gangster"" before intoning ""Grand Ole Opry, here we come"" and sing-rapping about weed over Everlast's respectable Tennessee Three pastiche. It's the closest thing we've ever had to a straight-up country song from one of the world's most recognizable rappers, and it's also a celebration of drugs dedicated to a beloved figure whose pill habit almost killed him more than once; I sort of can't believe it exists. As batshit awesome as ""My Medicine"" is, the best two moments of Ego Trippin' are its two last songs, ""Why Did You Leave Me"" and ""Can't Say Goodbye"", both wide-open heartbroken emo-pop-soul lilts on which Snoop sounds more like an actual human being rather than a walking catchphrase dispenser. The first is a generous, bedraggled breakup track with an absurdly catchy beat from Hitboy and Polow da Don; three months from now, it'll probably be inescapable. And on the second, Snoop and the Gap Band's Charlie Wilson moan empathy for the people who share their backgrounds over a gorgeously elegiac Riley track. These are some grown-up songs, and Snoop probably has a whole album of them somewhere in him. But as long as the pothead-pimp shtick keeps selling, we'll probably never hear it.","On his ninth album, like a hip-hop Tom Petty, Snoop continues to deliver more of the same MOR, easy-on-the-ears stuff: His sing-song purr sinking deep into lush, smooth, low-key tracks.

Stainless Style,Neon Neon,by: Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b51313d197565213abe3/1:1/w_160/70719caa.jpg,2008-03-14 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11267-stainless-style/,Lex,"Where we're going, we don't need roads. Remember with me, if you will, a time when cocaine was as rampant as synthesizers. When a wave of unprecedented M&A activity and yuppie-style prosperity was driving Wall Street to record heights. Sequels and superhero movies dominated at the box office, while starlets with limited discernible musical talent were releasing remarkably enduring pop songs. A conservative Republican was in the White House, giving aid and comfort to Iran as if he were someone who wasn't quite all there. I'm talking, as you know if you're reading two words ahead, about 2006, when Gruff Rhys and Boom Bip first announced their collaboration under the name Neon Neon. Just as a yearning for the 60s characterized much of the indie pop and indie rock of the 1980s-- from R.E.M.'s jingle-jangle mourning to C86's ""perfect pop"" to the slowed-down garage-y guitar heroics of Dinosaur Jr.-- so the memory of the 1980s has dominated certain music circles in recent years. Whether electrohouse, new wave, new rave, synth-pop, Miami bass, Detroit techno, Chicago house, Italo disco, Balearic, or, most recently, the revival of what used to be called ""world music"", the 80s have left their mark on the YouTube era. Now if only the 49ers could win four Super Bowls again. Rhys, solo artist and frontman for Welsh psych-poppers Super Furry Animals, and Boom Bip, the electronic/hip-hop producer known to his folks as Bryan Hollon, bring an eclectic background to the early-1980s revival. For an album conceived two years ago*, Stainless Style* captures a lot of what's been in the past few years' zeitgeist-- from Alan Braxe and Fred Falke's ""Rubicon"" to Chromeo and Cool Kids (if not quite all the way to Yeasayer); a recent Neon Neon ""influences"" mix included the Italian prog song that lays the foundation for Justice's ""Phantom"". And then the bright, 1980s-style guitar pop, murky electro rap, and cybernetic white-boy funk make for an album that upends some of the stereotypes about the hollowness of sleek 80s chrome. Hey, there's heart behind all this silvery excess. The more melodic, Rhys-fronted tunes sped up on me first, and they're also the most chronologically displaced. Bizarre Princess Leia brush-off ""I Told Her on Aderaan"" puts the Cars beneath 1980s snare sounds, angelic synths, kitschy spoken-word interjections, and one of the catchiest choruses so far this year. The midtempo candidate for a weepy beach break-up music video, ""Steel Your Girl"", comes close, with chiming soft-rock guitars and phased keyboard. ""Video games are nothing but illusion,"" Rhys begins. Factory farewell ""Belfast"" leans more toward wistful Duran Duran synth-pop. To all this, the herky-jerk call-and-response ""Dream Girls"" and shades-are-good electro creep-out ""Michael Douglas"" are wrecks by comparison. Not that there's a clear divide between songs where Rhys seems dominant and ones where Boom Bip takes over. Raquel Welch ode ""Raquel"" and its Miami Sound Machine (and then Run-D.M.C.) beats comes closest to melding the SFA frontman's skewed pop vision and Hollon's electro-conscious hip-hop. On ""I Lust U"", meanwhile, Rhys duets with Welsh singer Cate Le Bon, trading one-liners on an Italo-tinged dream not too far from something like Simian Mobile Disco's ""I Believe"". Spank Rock and Sean Tillman get in a couple of snappy verses amid the Prince-ly groove and Midnite Vulture-isms of Har Mar Superstar on first single ""Trick for Treat"". A messed-up title pun and Rhys's fuzzed-out oddness sort of redeem Yo Majesty's heavy-breathing shtick on ""Sweat Shop"" (where's Missy Elliott?), but Fatlip's scene-setting rap on ""Luxury Pool"" is more biography than biopic, helped by a hiccuping, fame-pimping hook. As a crossover side project involving an artist linked to 1990s Britpop, Neon Neon were bound to get compared to Gorillaz. Stainless Style is more consistent as an album than Damon Albarn's output with his first non-Blur group, and the potential hits, for what it's worth, hit equally hard. ""Oh, how many are my foes?/ How many rise against me?"" Rhys sings, with a choir of himself, on the title track and finale. Tuneful and engaging, though not flawless, Stainless Style holds a mirror up to a generation of 1980s nostalgia and, by warmly and humorously depicting a human being behind the bizarre rise and fall an engineer playboy, reminds us there's more to that most notoriously superficial decade than, well, surfaces. There's Huey Lewis, for example.","Super Furry Animals' Gruff Rhys and Boom Bip enlist the Strokes' Fab Moretti, Spank Rock, Yo Majesty, and others on a record that-- although it was conceived two years ago-- captures a lot of what's been in the past few years' zeitgeist.

Return of the Giant Slits,The Slits,by: David Raposa,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b4e713d197565213aba1/1:1/w_160/9280eac1.jpg,2008-03-13 06:00:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11228-return-of-the-giant-slits/,CBSCBS,"Return of the Giant Slits is a slippery, glorious mess that will infuriate anyone expecting the Slits to revisit their debut. The nervous energy that powered Cut is seemingly replaced with a relaxed smoked-out vibe that belies the group putting their Jamaican influences-- as well as their interest in other world musics-- front and center. At times, this might make the record sound like aimless noodling, the band just biding time on the label's dime while someone behind the mixing board packs a new bowl. However, while this tact has little in common with the pogo grind essayed by their more traditional punk rock contemporaries, they're right in line with the off-the-wall antics of their more open-minded countrymen, like This Heat and especially the Pop Group. For Return, it's not a case of less energy, but repurposed energy. The inclusion of Pop Group drummer Bruce Smith in the group has a lot to do with the album's success. He provides a deceptively primal backbeat that meshes perfectly with the odd angles the group explores. On ""Earthbeat"", he pounds out a simple tribal beat, a fine backdrop for the song's two-note bass motif and Ari's environmentally-conscious warbling. He's just as comfortable providing a grounding rocksteady shuffle for ""Difficult Fun"" and ""Or What It Is?"" as he is following the group's shambling muses into the ether (as on ""Animal Space/ Spacier""). Viv Albertine's guitar playing, already fragmented and skittish, is even more skeletal here, her scratches and stabs flitting about the record's periphery (aside from some wah-wah work on ""Walkabout""). On the other hand, Return's rhythmic bent allows Tessa Politt's loping and nimble basslines to take center stage. And amidst the flourishes of melodica and trumpet is Ari Up's unmistakable croon, attacking the songs the way one would expect a five-year-old to approach them-- shamelessly singing notes for the sake of the notes instead of for the sake of some stodgy old melody. While the lyrics, moving from personal to global concerns, might not pack as much punch as they once did-- don't hurt yourself trying to delve deep into song-long couplets like ""Difficult fun is hard to come by/ And empty fun is easy to find""-- it's the way she's saying what she says that matters most. Return of the Giant Slits isn't as easy to love as its predecessor, but it could turn out to be the more rewarding album of the two. Unfortunately, the extras tacked onto Return might make that reward seem less valuable. Finally having this album in print is a blessing in and of itself, and the label's dedication to offering folks everything related to Return is commendable from a completist's standpoint. Unfortunately, there's not much in the vaults, which is why the eight-track bonus disc contains FIVE versions of ""Earthbeat"". Offering just ""Dub Beat"" (which sounds as you would expect) and the version from the ""Earthbeat"" 12"" (which three minutes to the original's running time) would have been plenty. But why stop there when you can have a version sung in Japanese that sounds just like the 12"" version, a version sung in German that sounds like the Japanese version, and an ""extra"" version that sounds almost exactly like the version on the album proper? And then there's a twelve-minute radio interview where the group (stopping off during a U.S. tour) treat almost every caller with charming disdain and disrespect. It's a cute curio, but might be worth only one listen, if that. A more judicious compiler could have gotten away with grabbing the aforementioned good ""Earthbeat"" outtakes, the re-dubbing of ""Face Place"", and the re-dubbing of ""In The Beginning, There Was Rhythm"", and fit them nice and snug onto the end of the disc containing the proper album. Of course, this re-issue is aimed squarely at the sorts of folks that probably want to hear Ari Up sprachen zie deutsch, so better to err on the side of offering too much. And given that this is the first time in twenty-six years that the album's been available on CD outside of Japan, letting a few dull outtakes spoil the album proper is just silly.","This long out-of-print 1981 album-- now reissued with bonus tracks-- is a slippery, glorious mess that will infuriate anyone expecting the Slits to revisit their groundbreaking debut.

The mitosis of the Band of Horses stem cell resulted in the more streamlined and sedate Cease to Begin and Mat Brooke's Grand Archives...a band that sounds like they'd end up on the label any damn way. Or, how about this: The band that pulls off what the Elected were supposed to, a mixture of hayseed indie, bashful singer-songwriter comedowns, and sunny, orchestral pop. Grand Archives won't have the same impact of either Horses record, since it's more about hooks than heft and certainly less scrutable in topicality. But after hearing ""Torn Blue Foam Couch"" spiral endlessly upward, the ""Bungalow Bill""-quoting harmonica/whistle riff of ""Miniature Birds"", or the playful jig in the chorus of ""A Setting Sun,"" you begin to suspect the root of *Cease to Begin'*s occasional dourness. Brooke did manage to salvage a sense for the anthemic, although it isn't quite as barnstorming-- ""Swan Matches"" and ""Index Moon"" come girded by strong, but slow-evolving melodies that reveal themselves as stop-motion lighter wavers. Brooke's c.v. might be the main draw for rubberneckers here, but Grand Archives are far from a plug'n'play set-up; Brooke's slight voice, more airy than airborne gets plenty of help in from his backing band (which includes Carissa's Wierd's Jenn Ghetto and Ghost Stories), all of whom contribute strong vocals. ""Sleepdriving"", the album standout, is a monument of gauze, slowly evolving harmonies lingering before the coda breaks into a triumphant string uplift straight from Sigur Ros. While it's tempting to lump them into the ever-increasing pile of 70s California daytrippers, there's actually more forensic evidence of Summerteeth in the perfectly laconic horns on ""Miniature Birds"" and mandolins of brief closer ""Orange Juice"". The melodica instrumental ""Breezy No Breezy"" is a bit of trifle, but ""The Crime Window"" is the only real clunker on Grand Archives-- and it's a doozy. Relentlessly loud with power chords, bleating horns, and an unbecoming/unconvincing shoutiness, ""Crime Window"" shows the band trying to traverse the entirety of Montreal in four minutes, and by comparison, Neon Bible is a case study of subtlety. At the very least, the recording sessions for ""Crime Window"" must've been a blast, a feeling you get from just about everything else here. The insularity of Cease to Begin certainly has its merits, and it's pointless to argue about who comes out on top here, but the way Grand Archives come forth with arms outsretched results in a debut that likely exceeds most expectations.","A Sub Pop band led by ex-Band of Horses guitarist Mat Brooke, Grand Archives offer a mixture of hayseed indie, bashful singer-songwriter comedowns, and sunny, orchestral pop.

Cove,A Weather,by: Rebecca Raber,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b4f5b1335d7bf169a81b/1:1/w_160/da94ebd3.jpg,2008-03-13 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11239-cove/,Team Love,"Too often, it seems, songwriters must choose between the intimate and the anthemic. Portland, Oregon's A Weather, however, have managed to create an album full of songs that are both sonically expansive and painstakingly private. Their debut full-length is bursting with intricately plotted melodies and lush arrangements that sound like they were made in a bedroom, but meant for a ballroom. Sure, the news angle here is how a relatively unknown quintet from the Rose City snagged an opening slot on last year's Bright Eyes tour and a spot on Team Love's roster. But, despite their organic instrumentation and reluctance to deviate from sad, slow songs, they have little in common with their labelmates, and thus Conor Oberst's involvement is a mere parenthetical to the real story: these elaborately plush songs. Like Beach House without the gossamer reverb or Stars stripped of their most upbeat pop impulses, A Weather uses warm organs, folk-influenced guitars and the hushed interplay between the male and female vocalists to weave a tapestry of tenderly crafted chamber-pop that pays as much attention to its straightforward choruses as it does to its evocative details. Singer/drummer Sarah Winchester has an emotive yet controlled coo reminiscent of Aimee Mann's, and sexy, sad album opener ""Spiders, Snakes"" sounds like ""Save Me"" from the Magnolia soundtrack if Mann's version was fleshed out by fuller instrumentation and complemented by breathy male vocals. (Also, notably, that track references Bedhead, another band that knew that slow and somber didn't mean boring.) Those male vocals are provided by frontman Aaron Gerber, who, against his partner's Mannish tones, shapeshifts his winsome, pliant voice into disparate pop guises depending on each song's mood. For ""Pilot's Arrow"", a muted acoustic number that uses flight as a metaphor for a failing romance (and, curiously, finds Gerber singing to his drummer by name), he gets in touch with his inner whispery Elliott Smith. And on ""Hanging Towers of Baltimore"", he embodies the creamy-smooth tenor of Paul Simon, which is apt since the track softly alludes to the parts of Graceland that Vampire Weekend didn't already steal. Though the interaction between Gerber and Winchester's voices is the dramatic throughline of the album, its heart is her drumming. She plays a threadbare three-piece set, but its sparseness anchors these tracks-whether they're plumped with layers of instruments or spare and folky-in immediacy. ""Pinky Toe"", which takes the most familiar and banal hurt in the world (that of stubbing a toe) and turns it into a meditation on personal pain, builds anticipation with its raindrop-delicate percussion simmering against the withholding electric guitar line that never seems to fully fill out its melody. Assured in their quietness, A Weather don't back away from their most vulnerable moments-Gerber and Winchester inhaling in tandem or the rustle of their mouths against the microphones-and it is those tiny, aural imperfections that make this collection so sensual. But unlike the slowcore heroes who have influenced them, this fivesome isn't restrained or careful. Even if the volume on Cove is ubiquitously low and primed for headphone listening, there is a crashing power within. No wonder they named themselves for meteorology; A Weather are, quite literally, a quiet storm.","Portland, Ore.-based Team Love band have managed to create a debut album full of songs that are both sonically expansive and painstakingly private.

Parc Avenue,Plants and Animals,by: Rebecca Raber,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b4c713d197565213ab76/1:1/w_160/03c5ade5.jpg,2008-03-13 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11201-parc-avenue/,Secret City,"Montreal's music scene is like a clown car: just when you think it couldn't possibly have room to contain any more talent, some more emerge. The City of Saints can already lay claim to Billboard chart-toppers (Arcade Fire), Polaris Prize winners (Patrick Watson), punky Francophone ambassadors (We Are Wolves), no-wave revivalists (Les George Leningrad), noise rockers (AIDS Wolf), rappers (Gage), electro-funk party-starters (Chromeo) worldly indie pranksters (Islands), plus all the members of Wolf Parade and their many side projects. And now it can add ambitious, sun-baked trio Plants And Animals to the ranks of its growing community of celebrated musicians. Like a distant Canadian cousin of Blitzen Trapper, this three-piece spins shaggy songs into expansive, genre-bending symphonies. And though last year's too-brief * With/Avec* EP hinted at Plants and Animals' expansiveness, it didn't fully prepare listeners for Parc Avenue, a sprawling collection of rootsy melodies, majestic arrangements, and classic rock riffs that owes as much to jam-band psychedelia and it does to delicately orchestrated chamber-folk. The album kicks off with ""Bye Bye Bye"", which sounds, initially, like a Coldplay ballad led by Neil Young. But, mere seconds into the song, it explodes into a choral epic built on a foundation of jaunty pianos and embellished with plangent autoharp runs and bursts of stately brass. Tellingly, the track's infectious climax is more satisfying because it comes in fits and starts, its anthemic build interrupted several times by quiet interludes of noodley folk. That, in short, is Plants And Animals. They offer up explosive, Polyphonic Spree-sized choir choruses, 1970s AM radio guitars, cozy folk balladry, and rambling stoner boogie-often in the course of one song-- and switch between them with little warning. Many of their songs clock in at over five minutes long, but that's all the better for them to pick up steam, stylistically mutate, or expand. ""Faerie Dance"", which also appeared on the EP, explores multiple genres and tempos within its seven-minute run. Its dreamy opening is marked by ethereal backing vocals, but then gives way to a wiry, disorienting guitar melody that churns in opposition to melodramatic strings. Just when you've given in to its post-rock vertigo, a lackadaisically strummed guitar pushes the tune into slacker-blues territory à la * Mellow Gold*. Likewise, the album's centerpiece, ""Mercy"", marries a Phish-like guitar vamp and jazzy, cymbal-heavy drumming to Go-Team!-ish cheerleader chants and handclaps. Saxophone belches add some welcome hard-edges to the loosey-goosey jam, and singer Warren Spicer offers, as counterpoint to the chipper cheering, a growling Sean Connery impression. Spicer's lithe tenor, in fact, proves malleable over the course of the album, adapting to dispassionate talk-singing, raggedy country warbling, and arty, dramatic vibrato. His Beck impersonation on ""Faerie Dance"" is followed by ""Feedback in the Field"", on which he cops a convincing Tom Petty accent (""Somethin' in the air to-nye-ite""). ""New Kind of Love"" begins like a spare Iron & Wine ballad, but builds to theatrical, Arcade Fire levels of orchestral splendor. And on ""Sea Shanty""-- which starts out like Ryan Adams' ""Amy"", minus the confessional self-pity, and evolves into meandering Lynyrd Skynyrd-style Southern rock-- Spicer is able to affect a honeyed croon. From its scrawled, lower-case liner notes (complete with mistakes and cross-outs) to its sound, everything about Parc Avenue feels homemade. Its analog recording, which took place, in part, in Spicer's apartment, crackles with warmth and intimacy, and because the guest artists who fill out these orchestrations (including Arcade Fire/Bell Orchestre's Sarah Neufeld) are friends of the band, a sense of camaraderie prevails. Plants and Animals may not be the first band to put Montreal on the musical map, but, with this album's there's-no-place-like-home vibe, they are certainly the first to celebrate it so warmly.","Like a distant Canadian cousin of Blitzen Trapper, this Montreal three-piece spins shaggy songs into expansive, genre-bending symphonies.

The 11th Hour,Del Tha Funkee Homosapien,by: Nate Patrin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b4f19d034d5c69bf4f43/1:1/w_160/758e4b3b.jpg,2008-03-13 06:00:01,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11237-the-11th-hour/,Definitive Jux,"Del the Funky Homosapien was one of indie rap's leading stars by the end of 2000, and he did it with a pair of albums that couldn't be much more diverse: Deltron 3030, a conceptual space-rap opera about an AWOL mech soldier turned supernaturally powered anti-corporate freedom fighter, and Both Sides of the Brain, where his lyrics concerned things like Dreamcast games and weed and people who smell really bad. The next year, he appeared on two singles from the smash hit Gorillaz album-- a brush with mainstream pop fame he capitalized on by dropping a few verses on Hieroglyphics' Full Circle in 2003 and then disappearing from the public radar almost completely save the occasional guest spot. This wouldn't be the first time Del's been on semi-hiatus; 1993's No Need for Alarm took seven years to receive a mass-market solo follow-up, thanks in part to Elektra terminating his contract and relegating 1998's lost classic Future Development to a delayed indie distribution four years later. But there's still cause to wonder how much popular momentum Del might have lost by ducking into the sidelines all these years. Especially once you take into account how much momentum he's retained in just about every other department, at least if 11th Hour is any indication. Del's newest album and first for Definitive Jux is a straightforward and uncluttered record that flows surprisingly naturally for an album that's been so repeatedly delayed. Part of this could be credited to the production: This is one of those strange records where you forget most of the beats 15 minutes after you put away the CD but get completely hooked by them while they're playing. Del's production skills have been largely underrated as one of the things that keeps his albums held together, and he's stated in a few interviews that the beats on The 11th Hour came before the lyrics did-- maybe it's not obvious at first, but once it sinks in how that unobtrusive digital funk is complemented and augmented by a voice that knows every in and out of the beat's mechanical structure and jabs back at it in intricate ways, the more that the production's unpretentious simplicity makes perfect sense. As a lyrical exhibition, almost everything that makes Del the MC he is is in full effect: A taunting, sing-songy flow, internal rhymes that remain intricate without getting too convoluted or highfalutin', and the tendency to mix tightly-packed gymnastic verbiage and straightforward talk. One vital component that's missing, however, is the detailed storytelling and earthy day-to-day humor that informed records like Both Sides of the Brain and 1991 debut I Wish My Brother George Was Here alike. What we're mostly left with, aside from a few stress-rap cuts like the self-conscious ""Hold Your Hand"" and the anti-rumormongering ""I'll Tell You"", is Del sticking to one aspect of his subject repertoire-- his skills. He's got 'em, you don't, he likes MCing and making beats, rocking crowds because he's good at it-- yeah, it's the alpha and omega of rap lyricism to big up yourself, and it's not anything Del can't back up. But the more he flaunts it-- on ""Raw Sewage"", ""Bubble Pop"", ""Naked Fonk"", ""I'll Tell You"", ""Workin' It""-- the less it seems to stand out from one boast to the next. It actually comes as a relief when he manages to express it as a basketball metaphor (""Slam Dunk""), which says a lot coming from someone who sat through that tiresome Dan the Automator NBA 2K7 comp in its entirety. Still, for an album that pushes the limits of how much you can say about so little, the stuff that's said rarely fails to be entertaining in the pure linguistically structural sense. That aforementioned flow of Del's prods into your subconscious when you're focusing on anything but the lyrics, like you're hearing fragments of a spirited conversation in an adjacent room, and when you switch your attention to the words themselves they click so well it's almost hard to believe they sound like that and still make some kind of sense, even if they look perfectly normal on paper. (One highlight, from ""Last Hurrah"": ""The faintest notions that they're finna get some/ It's dumb, I spit some of this wickedest wisdom"".) And the barrage of lyrics is exhausting without being tedious, with endlessly-parseable knots of phraseology and weird little asides everywhere to keep your attention. With the battle-centric focus of No Need for Alarm given an additional 15 years' worth of experience and perspective, The 11th Hour is a tight and ruthlessly efficient 48 minutes of boasting-- if only its lyrical personality was as outsize as the voice delivering it.","After a lengthy hiatus, the indie rap star teams with Def Jux and issues a straightforward and uncluttered record that flows surprisingly naturally for an album that's been so repeatedly delayed.

Come Into My House,No Kids,by: Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b4db9d034d5c69bf4f23/1:1/w_160/0e2bea24.jpg,2008-03-12 06:00:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11217-come-into-my-house/,Tomlab,"No Kids are the non-children of P:ano, a Vancouver-based indie pop group who borrowed from an unusual array of influences-- from Broadway to post-disco-- over a catalog of three little-heard albums, one 7"" single, and an 11-track EP. After the departure of co-founding member Larissa Loyva, P:ano's remaining threesome have returned as No Kids, changing course from 2005's ukulele-driven Ghost Pirates Without Heads for a debut that rivals the Dirty Projectors' The Getty Address in its art-saturated omnivorousness, though its appetites aren't always within its means. On Come Into My House, everything from present-day urban radio to kitchen-sink chamber-pop to college glee clubs serve as fodder for F. Scott Fitzgerald-esque depictions of effete East Coast student loneliness. This old beach house is an extravagant one, peopled by characters who probably weren't hurt by the housing-market slump. Plenty of indie pop bands borrow from 1960s Motown, but No Kids' appropriation of contemporary r&b puts them in a lineage that runs from Orange Juice's Chic-style guitars and Scritti Politti's soulful balladry to Hot Chip's self-aware electropop-- and, alas, labelmate Hey Willpower's un-FutureSex-y Timberlake sounds, too. When the compositions are as engaging as the intricate percussion, as on advance mp3s like piano-based male-female duet ""For Halloween"" or the falsetto-frosted ""The Beaches All Closed"", songwriter Nick Krgovich conjures a world of empty vacation homes and full scrapbooks. The T-Pain-esque Auto-Tuning on ""Listen For It/Courtyard Music"" comes off as an eccentricity next to what sounds like bassoon, but Krgovich's protagonists have eccentricities instead of girlfriends. ""Neighbour's Party"" interpolates the slinky piano riff from Amerie's ""Crush"" as if it were a sample; the obviousness of the reference is a painful reminder that Amerie would be a lot more fun to hear blasting from your neighbor's party. Of course, No Kids know this, too. ""It's a dance in my heart,"" Krgovich and Julia Chirka sing-- not a night in the club. Opener ""Great Escape"" describes ""wandering around the gardens on this great estate"" with the band's Jimmy Jam-Terry Lewis fascination hidden behind lush orchestration, marching-band drum rolls, and quiet wistfulness. When the time comes for celebration on ""I Love the Weekend"" or ""Old Iron Gate"", Krgovich's melismas flit over Brazilian rhythms instead of icy-hot r&b. ""Four Freshmen Locked Out as the Sun Goes Down"" sets barbershop-style harmonies atop unobtrusive strums. Lyrical mentions of upper-crust academic life are about as frequent here as musical allusions to the pop charts. In Fitzgerald novels like The Beautiful and Damned, the characters may come from the WASP elite, but their passions burn like the booze in which they can't help but overindulge. Come Into My House represents another side of paradise-- the yearning of the well-to-do young intellectual who doesn't do well when it comes to matters of the heart, the insider who finds himself on the outside (with his pockets full of saltwater taffy). The album could use a little more of Fitzgerald's fiery extremes, and a bit less of meandering disappointments like ""You Looked Good to Me"" or ""Dancing in the Stacks"", but at its best it's a clever piece of musical storytelling by a band unintimidated by genre.","After the departure of co-founding member Larissa Loyva, P:ano's remaining threesome have returned as No Kids, changing course from 2005's ukulele-driven Ghost Pirates Without Heads for a debut that rivals the Dirty Projectors' The Getty Address in its art-saturated omnivorousness.

Love Goes On: A Tribute to Grant McLennan,Various Artists,by: Stuart Berman,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b4df5e6ef9596932269f/1:1/w_160/9e799a57.jpg,2008-03-12 06:00:04,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11221-love-goes-on-a-tribute-to-grant-mclennan/,Rare Victory,"In Robert Forster and Grant McLennan, the Go-Betweens boasted perhaps the most fruitful singer/songwriting partnership in 1980s indie, but even with their distinct characters and canons, they never asked you to pick sides. As foils they were as complementary as they were contradictory, Forster's arch, assertive delivery often serving as a front for a bruised sensitivity; McLennan's more genteel voice and agreeable melodicism often acting as decoys to his matter-of-fact observations and disarming punchlines. But even if McLennan wrote the kind of love songs that could become tough and unsentimental at the turn of a couplet, it was never for pure shock or subversive effect-- rather, it felt like sage advice for old-fashioned romantics in a world that has no time for them. News of McLennan's sudden passing in 2006 came with all the sucker-punch surprise as one of his lyrical twists, and it was particularly tragic in light of the fact that, since a 1999 reunion with Forster, the Go-Betweens were once again a going concern. But there was some consolation in the fact that McLennan's death-- brought on by heart failure during an afternoon nap-- reflected the same quiet dignity he carried himself with in life and song. And it's this very spirit that Love Goes On seeks to honor. It says a lot about the intensity of admiration McLennan inspired that an obscure Long Beach-based micro-indie-- headed by superfan David Buckner-- could round up various indie luminaries (Stars, Portastatic, the Clientele) and long-time associates (the Bats, former Saints founder Ed Kuepper, Black Box Recorder's Luke Haines) to donate self-financed covers to the album. (Though the project's modest means are unfortunately betrayed by Jack Rabid's liner-note essay, which would've benefited from another round of proofreading-- to wit, ""Cattle and Cain"" [sic].)
*
Love Goes On* smartly frontloads some of McLennan's lesser-known work before delving into his signature material, with the Clientele turning in a seductively swirling version of ""Orpheus Beach"" (from 2000's Go-Betweens reunion album The Friends of Rachel Worth), and Ed Kuepper recasting ""Finding You"" (from 2005's Oceans Apart) as a solitary blues that's almost murder-ballad-like in its desolate air of despair. Kuepper's contribution is especially notable in that he's the only singer here operating well outside of McLennan's gentle, relaxed vocal register, adopting a deep, throaty tenor closer to fellow Aussie Nick Cave. The artists entrusted with McLennan's more revered songs tweak the material in much more subtle fashion. Stars pull the long straw by claiming arguably McLennan's greatest and most poignant song, ""Cattle and Cane"", and their take is actually more revelatory as a Stars track than a McLennan cover, with an uncharacteristically stripped-down acoustic arrangement and dry, unaffected vocal from Torquil Campbell that makes the original's themes of faded memory and lost innocence feel all the more present-- however, the closing, climactic charge to the finish line feels at odds with the original's muted melancholy. McLennan's other masterstroke of ordinary-people portraiture, ""Streets of Your Town"", is likewise reduced by Ivy to a metronome-click and piano figure, with Dominique Durand's coo lending it a newfound space-age bachelor-pad allure. The ageless integrity of McLennan's songwriting naturally encourages a simple approach-- one heard on everything from Portastatic's folk-circle adaptation of ""Bye Bye Pride"" to Haines' spectral, Elliott Smith-like treatment of ""You Won't Find It Again"" to Future Pilot AKA's dreamy piano-lilted zone-out on ""Dusty In Here"". The net effect both emphasizes McLennan's lyrical charms, and liberates some of the Go-Betweens' material from its occasionally dated 80s production (most notably, ""Bachelor Kisses"", whose soft-focus surface is given a mild scuffing by UK songwriter Paul Handyside). The bittersweet inspiration and homespun origins of these covers means that Love Goes On is not really a forum for lofty reinterpretation, and in some cases the overly tasteful handling of the material (see: ""Haunted House"" by Brookville, aka Ivy's Andy Chase), can nudge the tracks toward Starbucks-scented AC. Love Goes On feels most rewarding when approached as an intimate, quietly celebratory wake among friends-- and if the readings of their favorite McLennan songs are too faithful to warrant much revisiting in lieu of the originals, as the man himself once famously sang, ""faithful is not a bad word.""","This tribute to the much-missed Go-Betweens co-leader (and wonderful solo artist) Grant McLennan features self-financed contributions from Stars, Portastatic, the Clientele, the Bats, former Saints founder Ed Kuepper, and Black Box Recorder's Luke Haines, among others.

Fool's Gold,Ssion,by: Eric Harvey,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b4d3ea9e61561daa6ceb/1:1/w_160/e7f5318b.jpg,2008-03-12 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11211-fools-gold/,self-releasedself-released,"As an BFA student at the Kansas City Art Institute, Ssion leader Cody Critcheloe produced an animated short called The Lemon Cookie Revolution. Effectively, and often hilariously, blurring the two most popular definitions of ""cult"" beyond recognition, Critcheloe imagined himself poisoning his heroes with delicious snacks of the film's title, thereby assuming a place among them in the cred-fed indie pantheon. It's a crude and campy stop-motion animation piece with a soundtrack boasting Wire and the Pet Shop Boys, and it allows Critcheloe to indulge his two fascinations: ironically chiding subcultural ""outsiders"", and indulging in over-the-top wish-fulfillment fantasies. In his narrated introduction to the film, he introduces its two themes thusly: ""Underground music cult figures you've probably never heard of, nor do you even care about. My second favorite thing in the whole wide world is, without a doubt, revolution."" If ""Fear Us"", from * Fool's Gold*, Ssion's second album, is any indication, Critcheloe is now a member in good standing. The song documents (as ""we"") a caricatured, nihilistic hipster netherworld-- mirrored in the album's butched-out cover image-- as a cartoonish, unambiguously bold amalgam of gay subcultural stereotypes, which Critcheloe both calls attention to and celebrates. In the Revolution short, an ejaculating penis is a recurring motif symbolizing rapture, and Gold's first single, ""Street Jizz"", similarly approaches orgasm and its byproducts as the (equally metaphoric and literal, no doubt) quintessence of experience, the ""white light"" that pierces the dark of night. Any revolution needs converts to succeed, though, and the song's chorus doubles as a recruitment slogan: ""It feels more dirty than it really is."" As an anthem, ""Jizz"" is also ridiculously catchy and simple: Critcheloe's exhortations echo atop a buzzing synth melody doubling a spry disco bassline, with a refrain dripping with affirmation and aspiration. Appropriately for music that makes smut sound so enticing, Fool's Gold vacillates between glossy disco and squalid electro-punk. Between the kinky ""Warm Glove"", the petulant screamalong ""Dayjob"", and ""Bullshit"", Critcheloe's voice, buffered by plenty of fuzz and the occasional sax squonk, finds a middle-ground between the late-1990s incarnation of Royal Trux's Neil Hagerty and a spit-shined Darby Crash. Despite the textural shifts, the optimistic sentiment stays the same throughout: like CSS' ""Fuckoff is Not the Only Thing You Have to Show"", or Scissor Sisters' ""Mary"", Critcheloe keeps his advice blissfully simple: ""Don't let the bullshit get you down."" Ssion's tendency to weave sympathy and encouragement through the naughty bits-- erasing the boring distinctions between partying, sex, music, and boundless, delirious dreaming-- clearly aligns them with CSS, Scissor Sisters, and Junior Senior, their fellow purveyors of devilishly simple, self-reflexive, and undeniably catchy dance-pop. Fool's Gold kicks off with ""Clown"", a sinuously funky piano-driven disco jam that extols the virtues of using the club to take (not lose) control. It's impossible not to hear the refrain ""pride, faith, heart and soul"" as anything other than a statement of purpose, and in this context, the decision between living in the ""trenches,"" or in a ""house with picket fences"" shouldn't take very long to make. While it's clear which of the two is more enticing, the glimmering banger ""A Wolves Eye"" still allows for keeping ""your head in the clouds"" while slinking through the underground. That metaphor extends to Fool's close; over an ecstatic, quasi-gospel synth shriek, ""Heaven"" proffers the same sort of take-no-prisoners approach from The Lemon Cookie Revolution (and hinted at in the title to the band's 2003 album Opportunity Bless My Soul): ""Just to get you all dancin'/ I'd hold god up for ransom."" In order to find redemption, sometimes it's just easiest to take out the deities and install yourself in their place.","Along with contemporaries CSS, Scissor Sisters, and Junior Senior, Ssion makes music that erases any distinction between partying, club scenes, sex, music, snark, and boundless, delirious dreaming.

Strangers Almanac: Deluxe Edition,Whiskeytown,by: Stephen M.

My memory is cloudy and I don't have the ticket stub anymore, so I don't recall who they opened for (I'm pretty sure it was Son Volt) or which songs they played. I do remember that it was at the New Daisy Theatre on Beale Street in Memphis, and that I was pleasantly surprised by their performance. Of course, I'd heard of Whiskeytown: Faithless Street, the North Carolina band's full-length debut, had been trumpeted by No Depression (R.I.P.) and had become an alt-country touchstone. Still, I thought that album sounded derivative and a little dull, too indistinct up against bands like the Old 97's and Freakwater. So I was only mildly curious when Whiskeytown took the stage and played new songs from their upcoming major-label debut, Strangers Almanac. Scruffy Ryan Adams, who looked muscular in a black t-shirt, had a good rapport with violinist Caitlin Cary, who stood off to the side and handled most of the between-song banter. There was an easy chemistry between them, guitarist Phil Wandscher, and the new rhythm section, and they funneled all that famous band tension into a tight, energetic show. I left convinced that they would make a great album someday. Sadly, Strangers Almanac wasn't it. Alternately confident and overreaching, original and derivative, it showed a band still coming into their own and a singer-songwriter still settling into his voice. The band borrow obviously from the Replacements (""Yesterday's News""), Bruce Springsteen (""Houses on the Hill""), Uncle Tupelo (""Losering""), Gram Parsons (""Dancing with the Women at the Bar""), and the True Believers (Alejandro Escovedo sings the bridge on ""Excuse Me While I Break My Own Heart""). At the time, they were unable to integrate these influences into a distinctive, personal sound. More than 10 years after its initial release, Strangers Almanac is getting the deluxe, two-disc reissue treatment, complete with five live tracks from the band's studio performance at KCRW, the complete Barn's on Fire and Baseball Park sessions, and a handful of stray covers and soundtrack contributions, which vary from excellent (the darkly urgent ""Breathe"") to the throwaway (the overwrought ""Wither, I'm a Flower""). Despite the official plastic ""deluxe"" slipcase and thoughtful liner notes by No Depression co-founder Peter Blackstock, I get the impression that the album's reputation has more to do with the music the band made afterwards than with the music the band made at this particular point in their careers. Adams in particular sounds like he's still finding his voice on the album, despite the many accolades for his songwriting. The album proper is littered with clunky lines and unwieldy imagery, such as the lame pun that anchors the drowsy opener ""Inn Town"", which plays out in the chorus as ""When I'm in(n) town..."" The verse melody on ""16 Days"" sounds awkward, never quite resolving itself satisfactorily, and Adams writes some of his most maudlin lyrics on the bridge: ""Old tin cups, little paper dolls/ All wrapped up, in ribbons bowed with hearts."" His subjects-- broken hearts, unspoken apologies, lonely roads, cheap motels-- were common to almost every alt-country band in the late 90s, but somehow his treatment sounds obligatory, as if he's learning to speak a new language. On ""Dancing with the Women at the Bar"", the father-and-son tale of life on the strip lacks that one crucial detail that would make it believable or lend it personal gravity, but fortunately, the song veers into one of Adams' loveliest and most forlorn choruses, which producer Jim Scott underlays with a thrumming organ more evocative than any of the lyrics. In fact, Scott, who had previously worked with Tom Petty and Wilco and who has since worked with Foo Fighters and Wilco again, helps Whiskeytown put many of these songs over, adding those explosive chords to the chorus of ""Yesterday's News"" and those ghostly doubled vocals to ""Not Home Anymore"", which reinforce its sense of isolation. The alarm clock that ends the album, however, remains a needless gimmick. Several weeks after the Memphis show, Strangers Almanac arrived in stores heralded with a lot of hype, but due to either Outpost's lackluster promotional push or to the growing rift between the band members, it was not the predicted break-out (Even Grant Alden, No Depression's other co-founder, gave it only three stars in Rolling Stone, calling the band ""still tentative, still learning""). Before breaking up, the band-- well, Adams, Cary, and guests-- recorded a follow-up, which was shelved until 2001. That album, cryptically titled Pneumonia, was the great album I wanted Strangers Almanac to be, a well-written and wide-ranging collection of songs that nicely realized the possibilities of Adams' voice melding naturally and beautifully with Cary's. In some ways, Strangers Almanac is a relic of late-90s alt-country, representing a moment just before so many of its most popular acts broke free of the genre's conservative strictures and began experimenting with a wider sonic palette. As such, the album feels a little dated; it's hard to understand how it would have been revolutionary eleven years ago. Either the aesthetic of country embellishments on a rock framework has been so absorbed by Starbucks roots music or maybe I've just gotten too old, but very little about Strangers Almanac feels especially innovative in 2008. It just sounds like another rock album, sturdy enough but rarely engrossing.","Alternately confident and overreaching, original and derivative, Whiskeytown's much-lauded major-label debut recieves a 2xCD reissue complete with KCRW-recorded live tracks, the complete Barn's on Fire and Baseball Park sessions, and a handful of stray covers and soundtrack contributions.

Hercules and Love Affair,Hercules and Love Affair,by: Philip Sherburne,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b5159d034d5c69bf4f7c/1:1/w_160/36b23908.jpg,2008-03-12 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11269-hercules-and-love-affair/,DFA,"Forget disco for a second. The most significant thing about the debut album from New York's Hercules and Love Affair has less to do with revival than arrival-- that of a compelling new voice in American dance music. Not Antony Hegarty's, of Antony and the Johnsons, even though his pipes are an integral part of Hercules' aesthetic, but Andrew Butler, a twentysomething resident of New York who has made one of 2008's great albums, and one of the best longplayers from DFA. (DFA's Tim Goldsworthy surely deserves some of the credit as well, as the album's co-producer and the programmer behind most of the record's beats.) Butler got his start writing music for art projects in college-- ""like a remake of Gino Soccio's 'Runaway' done in the style of Kraftwerk,"" he told Fact magazine-- but Hercules and Love Affair's music doesn't require Fischerspooner-type theatrics. This debut album is a self-contained, self-assured, 10-song set that runs vintage styles through a restless compositional imagination to create something joyfully, startlingly unique. Of course, you can't entirely forget about disco; the record owes a debt to the dance-music of the 1970s and 80s, from Gamble & Huff-style strings to the camp sensibilities of Sylvester or Patrick Cowley. Butler has clearly studied Arthur Russell: His dancefloor jams have the same energy that drives uptempo Russell numbers like ""Go Bang"" and ""Is It All Over My Face?"", and his arrangements-- as when he nestles Kim Ann Foxman's voice in a bed of spongy keys and bass on ""Athene"", like an Easter egg in plastic grass-- recall Russell's facility for space and timbre. There are plenty of signposts for disco, the genre: octave-toggling bass lines (played by Automato's Andrew Raposo and !!!'s Tyler Pope), rattling congas, bouncing 4/4 kicks, and insistent open hi-hats. There are references to house, as well, as would be expected from a record whose lead single features a Frankie Knuckles remix. But they point less to the 90s version of house as a distinct genre, whether sleek and lush or raw and machinic, than to house music in its origins, when it was simply disco music that was played at the Warehouse. Only ""You Belong"", with its taut, spiky drum machine programming and pistoning chords, engages the formalism of early Chicago house. And it engages it brilliantly. What is often forgotten when talking about music so steeped in tradition is how it actually sounds-- how it works, how it conjures. It would be a shame if Hercules and Love Affair's music were to be reduced to the sum of its references, even in shorthand, because Butler's music is too complex, too lovingly stuffed with ideas. That Hercules and Love Affair is as unwieldy as its name-- and also just as passionate, camp, and muscular-- is one of its great pleasures. ""You Belong"" begins as a faithful exercise in acid-house revivalism, from the syncopated cowbell patterns to a looped vocal sample recalling the classic house invocations to ""Jack, motherfucker."" (It doesn't matter that the indistinct sample says something different; its cadence triggers something like an unconscious memory of acid house's vocal tropes.) It's the way that Butler and his collaborators mold formalist fidelity into something stranger that makes the track really sing, beginning with keyboards that seem to float on a cushion of air, and extending to the way that the singer Nomi's lead vocals are mimicked by a multitracked backing refrain from Antony that sounds as though it's been run through a prism. For its minor-key structure, the song's augmented chords give it the quality of an exploding rainbow. Not everything here is designed as ""dance music."" The opening ""Time Will"", one of the album's highlights, mutates a standard disco framework into a weird and gelatinous torch song. ""Iris"", likewise, slows house music's pitter-patter dramatically, leaving the rhythm a framing device for the interplay between horns, synthesizers, and Foxman's sentimental lead vocals. And ""Easy"", the album's most understated song, sounds so different from the rest of the record that it suggests an alternate trajectory Hercules and Love Affair could presumably pursue-- a dusky noir somewhere between the Knife and Shriekback. But while more than half of the album's tracks would easily work on forward-thinking dance floors-- ""Hercules' Theme"", ""You Belong"", ""Athene"", ""Blind"", ""This Is My Love"", ""Raise Me Up"", and ""True False, Fake Real"" all cruise comfortably between 110 and 120 bpm-- what really shines is the songwriting. The album brims with hooks, choruses, bridges, strange twists, and turns. It's hardly maximalist-- every song feels like it could be played by a four-or-five piece band with a few overdubs-- and yet the record expands and contracts, pressing tones together before zooming outward to present each element in stark, shining relief. Nowhere is this more apparent than on the rollicking ""Hercules' Theme"", which opens with a spare loop of percussion, Rhodes, and electric bass and gradually balloons into a soaring mess of horns, string vamps, and vocal harmonies. Few producers can pull off excess as well as Butler and Goldsworthy; that they balance their outré tendencies with moments of careful restraint only confirms their finesse. If the record has a flaw, it might be its overall pacing. ""Time Will"" and ""Hercules' Theme"" feel like they're vying for the opening slot, a sense confirmed by the fact that they're in the same key. And the flow of the record's latter half feels off, with the subdued ""Iris"" and ""Easy"" followed by another muted disco number (""This Is My Love"") before jumping back into the jaunty ""Raise Me Up"" and ""True False, ""Fake Real"". But these are quibbles. Hercules and Love Affair is a phenomenal album, one destined to save disco not from its detractors but rather from those fans and revivalists who would calcify the music as a set as a set of tropes and reference points. Lush, melancholic, gregarious, generous, both precise and a little bit unhinged-- this is the most original American dance album in a long while.","DFA introduces Andrew Butler, a compelling new voice in American dance music.

It was as if that decade hadn't even happened. But on this, the second full-length of his return, the feeling of déjà vu is mostly gone. Whereas I got the sense his last album and the couple of EPs that orbited it were a clearing of house from all that time off, The Imagination Stage seems to be the record that tells me what he sounds like now, a genuine move into new territory. The building blocks for Matthews' brand of indie pop-- careful, ornate arrangements, steady medium tempos, breathy vocals, restraint-- are still in place, but this album slows down that sound and stretches it over an atmospheric hour. The result ranges from pretty to dull, and the album suffers from the same basic problem as 2006's Foundation Sounds: it's way too long. Of the album's 56 minutes, far too many consist of little more than keeping time, and on the few songs that feature drums, they never do anything more interesting than an entry-level rock beat. As usual, Matthews uses his vocals as another instrument in the texture, but this time around the approach denies the songs a gravitational center more than usual. Certain tracks get by mostly on feel. ""That Kiss of Life"", for instance, doesn't have a strong melody and the Bacharach-ish horns repeat a simple phrase that doesn't quite amount to a hook, but it all coalesces to create a plush, echoing aural pillow that at least sounds nice. On the title track, he sings, ""I tried like hell to make the music beautiful,"" and he mostly succeeds at that, but beautiful and memorable aren't necessarily the same thing. That's illustrated amply on ""Don't Take Light"", which wanders through an ambient haze of piano, vocals and strings, and sounds pretty but never hooks you with anything more than its prettiness. It is one of the few songs, though, to feature real dissonance, which sets it apart some. Most of the rest of the record is heavily diatonic and unsyncopated, leading it all to blur together. The church organ of ""Her Life"" provides another spike of darkness, but again, it's mostly just atmosphere as the vocal never latches on to a real melody. This is an album that, despite possessing many of the signifiers of pop and surrounding them with pretty chamber orchestra arrangements, doesn't stick with you. It's the age-old wallpaper effect: it sounds good, and it's hard to pick out any one thing that's terribly wrong with it, but it's also hard to find a reason to listen again. Even after several listens, I felt like I was hearing each song for the first time, not because there was a lot to listen to, but because none of it had stayed with me. It's good to hear Matthews challenging himself and exploring a different sound, and his most ardent fans will want to hear where he's gone, but in his comeback he's yet to equal his first two solo albums from so long ago.","The building blocks for Matthews' brand of indie pop-- careful, ornate arrangements, steady tempos, breathy vocals, restraint-- are still in place, but this album slows down that sound and stretches it over an atmospheric hour.

Basic Replay,Various Artists,by: Mike Powell,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b4e1b1335d7bf169a7f6/1:1/w_160/31742ca3.jpg,2008-03-11 06:00:04,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11223-basic-replay/,Basic Replay,"Germany's Basic Replay specializes in near-facsimiles of reggae obscurities. Though it tends to focus on highlighting weirdness at the genre's margins, there aren't stylistic or regional boundaries on what the label reissues; though it primarily culls from the mid-1970s to the mid-80s, there's no tight historical scope, either. Basic Replay, the label's first CD compilation, collects a sampling of the 20 or so singles it's released since 2003. And though there's no real organizing principle at work, the compilation does a decent job of demonstrating how radically Jamaican music changed when the roots sound popular in the mid- and late-70s gave way to dancehall in the early- to mid-80s. Imagery in roots reggae, as the name suggests, was fixated on the past; its molasses-thick, groaning sound suggestive of the trudge-- both physical and metaphysical-- back to God-sponsored homelands. Vocalists du jour tended to either be deep and foreboding (Prince Far I, Yabby You) or clumped into sweet, transportive trios (the Congos, the Mighty Diamonds, Culture); roots' productions sounded foggy and lumbering. By comparison, dancehall was dapper and uptempo, littered with sequenced drum-machine sounds and digital frills. On Basic Replay, tracks like Jackie Mittoo's phantasmagoric ""Ayatollah"" or Keith Hudson's back-to-loincloths fantasy ""Hunting"" rub against Prince Jazzbo's ""Replay Version"" or Ackie's ""Call Me Rambo"", a plasticky, mid-80s production inordinately proud of its machine-gun samples. What I've always loved about this era of Jamaican music is its aloof experimentalism. Like early hip-hop, it's a record of a group of people confronted with a lot of technology they had no idea how to use. Instead of spending a lot of time with pedestrian tasks like ""figuring it out,"" they pushed a few buttons in the name of novelty, etched them into vinyl, and moved on to some new, inscrutable buttons. It's the DIY aesthetic without the self-conscious politics, or progressivism without the pretension of being progressive. The best music on Basic Replay shows how far a little courageous ignorance can go. Reggae reissues tend to enter the market either in trickles from boutique imprints like Basic Replay, or the diarrheic, fire-hose force spray of repackages from Trojan or Greensleeves. With the smaller labels, it's customary to get a more lovingly curated, aesthetically pleasing product. Basic Replay's reissued singles tend to look exactly like the out-of-print originals, logos and all, but with a small ""Basic Replay"" stamp. It's surprising and disappointing, then, that Basic Replay doesn't come with any liner notes. (Given the lack of chronology, it's really surprising to not have recording dates for the tracks.) And though I think it's a disservice to keep curious listeners in the dark as to a music's history (especially when it's an obscure history), it's hard not to concede to the magic of the music itself, which bubbles, squeals, and clangs around with the amazing gracelessness of an animal struggling to make sense of its brand-new body.","Germany's Basic Replay specializes in near-facsimiles of reggae obscurities, and this-- its first CD compilation-- collects a sampling of the 20 or so singles the label has released since 2003.

Precambrian,Ocean,by: Cosmo Lee,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b4d79d034d5c69bf4f1d/1:1/w_160/2d50f8b5.jpg,2008-03-11 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11214-precambrian/,Metal Blade,"Berlin's the Ocean are a peculiar study in band management. Guitarist Robin Staps writes their music, then teaches it to a rotating cast-- basically, whomever is around. Staps estimates that the Ocean has five guitar players, but no more than two at a time. On a recent tour, one was a Swiss 19-year-old plucked from the Internet. Twenty-six musicians played on Precambrian, including a British vocalist (also found via the internet), various hardcore punk luminaries, and members of the Berlin Philharmonic (the band is currently seeking a long-term live cellist). Drums were recorded in Finland, while vocals were recorded in the U.S., Netherlands, Sweden, and Germany. Staps assembled these materials at his home base, a former aluminum factory for U-boats in World War II. Now dubbed Oceanland, it houses a recording studio, rehearsal space, and sleeping quarters. Such spaces are distinctly European, as is the Ocean's scope. The band has two sides; the first blends Neurosis' heaviness with Converge's angularity, while the second tempers the first with atmospheric keys and strings. To showcase these sides, the band's first two full-lengths, Fluxion and Aeolian, were originally planned as a double album. Their record label nixed this idea, but agreed to it for Precambrian. Its first disc is 22 minutes of metallic hardcore punk, while the gentler second disc sprawls across an hour. One 11-minute song combines 84 tracks of audio. Even the packaging is epic-- in Europe, anyway. There, Precambrian comes in a colorfully layered, die-cut digipak. Metal Blade's U.S. arm, citing American apathy to artwork, issued the album in a standard jewel case. Even such flat presentation requires two booklets of liner notes. Ostensibly, the album revolves around the Precambrian era, the first chapter in the earth's history. The discs are subtitled ""Hadean/Archaean"" and ""Proterozoic"", the two halves of the era; their subdivisions are the song titles: ""Siderian"", ""Rhyacian"", and so on. Staps wrote the music first, then applied this conceptual framework. Such post hoc construction risks pretension, but the framework fits. Unlike Isis' minimalism and Neurosis' elemental bent, the Ocean is beautifully baroque. Even its harder side is artsy. ""Neoarchaean"" begins with early-Spoon indie-arena rock, then detonates with drum rolls and spiraling guitars. ""Eoarchaean"" throws sharp elbows, but tags on a Middle Eastern-flavored coda. Disc two parallels the reconstruction of life after the Oxygen Catastrophe. It starts as a clean-toned spaghetti western, patiently building before exploding with distortion. ""Statherian""'s 6/8 recalls Beethoven's ""Moonlight Sonata"", then leaps into synth-sprinkled thrash. ""Cryogenian""'s piano ostinato suggests ""Linus and Lucy"" dressed in black. The Ocean had such colors before, but they pulse more vividly in these spacious settings. ""Calymmian"" layers Pink Floyd slide guitar over mournful cello. In ""Stenian"", Radiohead does ""Hotel California"", as strings keen underneath. But crushing distortion buries the dirge; there will be blood, indeed. Unlike Mastodon's Leviathan, which simply set Moby Dick to song, Precambrian isn't about rocks and lava. The lyrics bristle with natural imagery, but they're metaphoric. During the Precambrian era's Oxygen Catastrophe, oxygen and methane products of photosynthesis built up and caused mass extinction of anaerobic organisms. The obvious parallel is global warming. Precambrian, however, addresses human destruction more generally. ""Hadean"" declaims, ""Sitting out the goosestep of the long march of the yes-men/ As their gold card-wielding wives are consumed by bitterness."" ""Archaean"" is likewise anti-consumerist: ""We'd pay any price to buy everything/ We stand in line and smile...Celebrate the great emptiness of our lives."" ""Paleoarchaean"" sets Baudelaire's ""Man and the Sea"" to ripping hardcore punk; the vocals draw out the English translation and grind it on gravel: ""The sea is your mirror; you contemplate your soooooul/ In its eternal waves that chafe and roooooll."" When man fights the sea, he ultimately fights himself. Precambrian is gaudily dense with literary references. Quotes from the Comte de Lautréamont's Les Chants de Maldoror fill the liner notes, as well as the entirety of ""Mesoarchaean""; ""Neoarchaean"" draws from de Lautréamont's ""Poésies"". ""Ectasian"" sets Austrian poet Georg Trakl's ""De Profundis"" to Pantera-esque hemiolas. In ""Rhyacian"", Staps mixes his words with those of Nietzsche and de Lautréamont. He over-reaches, as his lyrics are bluntly unpoetic. But even if his references aren't narratively coherent, they're spiritually congruent. Staps is fighting for the human soul. His liner notes contain a mission statement: ""Precambrian is our stance against MySpace-induced volatileness and transience...It is an album for people who still believe in the idea that an album can be more, and should be more, than the sum of its tracks."" In concept, packaging, and strata, Precambrian defiantly shakes up the human fossil record.","Berlin guitarist Robin Staps writes his band's music, then teaches it to a rotating cast-- 26 of whom played on this 2xCD album, which blends Neurosis' heaviness and Converge's angularity with atmospheric keys and strings.

Guitar Trio Is My Life!,Rhys Chatham & His Guitar Trio All-Stars,by: Grayson Currin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b50db1335d7bf169a847/1:1/w_160/51ef0c73.jpg,2008-03-11 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11263-guitar-trio-is-my-life/,Table of the Elements,"If the most pure rock'n'roll is all about excess, emancipation, and sexuality, then 55-year-old Parisian composer Rhys Chatham makes Mick Jagger seem like a Sunday school teacher: Chatham's second 3xCD box set for Table of the Elements, Guitar Trio is My Life!, collects 10 performances from Chatham's 2007 14-city North American tour. Every night, Chatham and a different ensemble of musicians performed his most famous work, 1977's ""Guitar Trio"", twice. It's about time: For too long, Chatham's massed guitars have been a footnote to those of the more famous Glenn Branca. But Branca--- like Sonic Youth's Lee Ranaldo and Thurston Moore, Swans' Michael Gira and Jonathan Kane, and the Modern Lovers' Ernie Brooks, many of whom appear here-- was an early student of and member in Chatham's New York ensembles. This exhausting, exhilarating collection, though, should confirm both Chatham and ""Guitar Trio"" as staples in the rock and 20th cenury composition canons. At the very least, from the first E note to the last E chord three hours later, it proves that Chatham-- also significant for his curatorial role at New York's The Kitchen in the 70s and in the establishment of No Wave later that decade-- fucking rocks. The ""Guitar Trio"" score is deceptively simple: ""In this century, it has never taken more than an hour to teach 'Guitar Trio' to everyone's satisfaction and comfort level,"" Chatham wrote in the score notes circulated for the 2007 tour documented by Guitar Trio Is My Life! ""So please don't worry about anything."" Several guitar players gather around a drummer and an electric bassist. Their amps are clean, loud, and high on treble. The drummer counts off, and Chatham strums an open low E string, his rhythm a bit like a jumpy 60s Brit Invasion tune. The drummer plays a cantering, steady rhythm restricted to the hi-hat. One by one, Chatham signals each guitarist to join. The bassist enters. After several minutes, Chatham begins strumming the top three strings and then signals each guitarist to do the same. Later, Chatham begins strumming all six strings, fretting only the second string to B. Eventually everyone stops playing except the drummer, still using only hi-hat, and Chatham, again playing one string. The entire process repeats, and it's generally a bit briefer the second time around. The music fades out with a final chord played on a conclusive downbeat. Chatham announces the ensemble, bows, turns to his band, and starts again in the exact same way. Except this time, the drummer is given use of his full kit, especially the snare and kick drums. The only previous version of ""Guitar Trio"" (available on the long-since out-of-print 2002 box set An Angel Moves Too Fast to See and on the 2006 disc Die Donnergötter) was eight minutes long (first cycle only). The shortest take on Guitar Trio Is My Life! is the second Brooklyn cycle, which ends after 16 driving minutes. But the ""Guitar Trio"" sound is surprisingly dynamic: Chatham does not specify when any given player should play above any given fret or for what length of time. Such inherent indeterminacy means that what begins as a stately, strummed guitar pattern begins to mutate and grow into surprising shapes. This variety of sounds builds cumulatively into a thick swath of high and low overtones bouncing off of each other like long-lost kin at a crowded family reunion. All of the sounds are made from the same E string or E chord, but none of them are exactly the same. By the time ""Guitar Trio"" hits its six-string segment, it's as thick as a furious blizzard. When the notes really come down, it's beautiful and overwhelming. Still, 10 versions of the same 16-to-30 minute piece of music? Boring, right? Perhaps were it not for the musicians included here-- from members of Tortoise, Sonic Youth, and Thee Silver Mt. Zion to an unknown but incredible Buffalo drummer named Jim Abramson, who gloriously mauls his 21 minutes of Table of the Elements time on Disc One. ""Guitar Trio"" ingests individual talents and funnels them into a composition loose enough for new ideas but tough enough to test physical and mental limits: On the full-drum version from Toronto, then, you get a six-piece string section (including Final Fantasy's Owen Pallet), thickening the guitar sound into a viscous smear. But after the one-string turnaround, it sounds like Chatham's worn them out. Same for Tortoise's John McEntire, who turns in the best brass-only drumming with his Chicago performance, riding his hi-hat with impeccable time and finesse. But he gets lost inside the nine-guitar storm on the full-kit version, unlike improvisational heavyweight and Collections of Colonies of Bees drummer Jon Mueller. Like he does on this year's solo drum Table of the Elements release Metals, Mueller rattles speakers from the frame. His kick drum and heavy snare slap fearlessly. They lash at the six guitars like the only way out is revenge. Same for Ernie Brooks' bristling bass pops on the second set from Brooklyn: With a rhythmic sense that sounds like whiplash must feel, he folds his own aesthetic beneath Chatham's masterful umbrella work. When considered alongside Chatham's statement that he can teach anyone this piece in an hour, such variety is exhilarating. ""Guitar Trio"" was composed after Chatham, then a New York composer taking a somewhat academic approach to minimalism, saw the Ramones play CBGB. Their music shocked him into redirecting his sonic approach within his own pre-existing ideas. The result is glorious, one-chord, electro-orchestral, garage-band minimalism. Anyone can learn this music. Anyone can play this music. Anyone can enjoy this music, rhythmically and tonally electrified as it is. This is a popular inroad for both understanding and participating in sound fields generally relegated to academia. ""Guitar Trio"" suggests infinite possibilities for this music, for all music, really: If you can combine basic ""punk"" ideas with basic ""classical"" ideas to create something that will forever alter the shape of both memes (see Sonic Youth and Glenn Branca), what can't you do?","Paris-based composer and experimental music legend Rhys Chatham's second 3xCD box set for Table of the Elements, Guitar Trio is My Life!, collects 10 live performances of various ensembles performing his most famous work. Among those featured are members of Sonic Youth, Tortoise, Godspeed You! Black Emperor, and Hüsker Dü, as well as Fog and Final Fantasy.

Alopecia,WHY?,by: Jason Crock,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b50413d197565213abca/1:1/w_160/c4620579.jpg,2008-03-11 06:00:01,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11254-alopecia/,Anticon,"Eyebrows raised when Why? were chosen to support the Silver Jews on a 2005 tour, but that seemingly incongruous bill made more sense when considering one of Berman's better lines: ""All my favorite singers couldn't sing."" Likewise on Alopecia, Yoni Wolf doesn't seem to know he isn't a diva on ""Simeon's Dilemma"", that he isn't a New Pornographer on ""Fatalist Palmistry"", or that he's not a grizzled battle-rapper on ""The Fall of Mr. Fifths"", and he won't let any of it get in his way. He's got too much to say to be concerned about it. ""Unclassifiable"" is usually lazy shorthand for albums featuring both guitars and keyboards. Alopecia is a liquid in the sieve of genre: put it on headphones and it begs to bump; recite lyrics aloud and people will look at you with loathing usually reserved for religious leaflet canvassers and slam poets; try and decode the words in your head and you'll only hear the melodies behind them. As for his lyrics, it's wrong to call them stream-of-consciousness, since that implies Wolf is a poor self-editor; nothing about Alopecia is lazy. It's more like 5 a.m. journal entries cut up and turned to collage. Clearly, every line won't be pure gold, but they all add up to something. Alopecia opens with the chain-gang lurch of ""The Vowels Pt. 2"", its slow claps and big, watery bass hits rubbing against Wolf's most insistent rap/sing delivery, and the unlikely hook of ""Cheery-ay, Cheery-ee..."" somehow becoming the record's most ingratiating. Funnily, the first two lines (""I'm not a ladies man, I'm a landmine, filming my own fake death..."") reveal most of the record's preoccupation. No matter what he's on about on Alopecia-- although most of the time, he's pretty easy to follow, especially compared to his Anticon brethren-- sex and death are never far from Wolf's mind. The former is pretty evident on ""Good Friday"", a crisper revisiting of the acoustic plucking-plus-beats of Why?'s earlier work, and an uncomfortable litany of perversions Wolf ""wouldn't admit to his head-shrinker"" that includes forgetting Elton John lyrics in karaoke. Wolf's voice is (putting it delicately) distinctive, but his monotone murmur here is just one example of his ability to change up his delivery. Not that he needs to-- while Wolf fearlessly splays open his head for all to see its contents, the band is the real star (the core of Yoni, brother Josiah Wolf, Doug McDiarmid, and here fleshed out by Fog's Andrew Broder and bassist Mark Erickson). They're what make ""The Hollows"" work as both tentative and propulsive guitar-rock under Wolf's paranoia, and make ""Palmistry"" cheerful and memorable pop under the sobriety of his lyrics. ""These Few Presidents"" is stiff indie rock, with drum-machines and the polite blurt of an organ, until the bottom drops out and cascades of clattering percussion and yawning low frequencies soundtrack the most sincere Hallmark card ever: ""Even though I haven't seen you in years, yours is a funeral I'd fly to from anywhere."" ""Mr. Fifths"" returns to bouncy, rap-minded delivery, with tongue-twisting lines about syphilis and the sound of high heels on marble. But they've got some nerve here, making us wait until the record's last third for its best songs: ""A Sky for Shoeing Horses Under"" is some strange, sublime triangulation of Steve Reich, deadpan rap swagger, and blustery multi-tracked choruses you could link to Alice in Chains. But trainspotting is beside the point-- the band creates a musical landscape so vivid that every cryptic line doesn't seem inscrutable, but more like puzzles worth unlocking. The stalker's serenade, ""Simeon's Dilemma"", is creepy, sure, but then Wolf busts out the falsetto like he's a supporting character in a boy band getting his big solo moment-- you can almost hear him pointing at notes on the invisible scale with his hand. Then there's the disorienting and dreamy behind-the-beat thump of ""By Torpedo or Crohn's"", featuring what I guess you might expect from underground white-guy rap: cryptic lyrics about throwing up behind Whole Foods, the admission that as a kid he ""didn't shit his pants much,"" and hoping for health food in hell. It contrasts with the rest of Alopecia, but even as a portrait of a medium existence, it's still a complicated one, and its most lasting impression after the lulling sing-song of the chorus is pervasive anxiety. It's weird to think that 2008 could be a year of reaffirmation for Anticon, but along with Subtle, they just won't adhere to the boxes we've tried to stuff them into. If there's anything that drags down Alopecia, it's that ""Fatalist Palmistry"" is the only real sigh of relief on a very sober record (and even that song begins and ends on thoughts of death). Even as it charted a difficult breakup, 2005's Elephant Eyelash had a few more moments of relative sunshine. Here, Wolf's exhaustively catalogued his sins and imperfections as on ""Good Friday"", and even the stalker in ""Simeon's Dilemma"" has no release or acknowledgment to look forward to; he braces for the fall, and prepares to ""deny, deny, deny."" Wolf seems doomed to feel too much here-- to take in everything, and take it all very, very seriously.","The inscrutable indie hip-hop group returns with an uncontainable record that defies genre and expectations at nearly every turn.

Though they've played in other bands, as Ida they've released several records, in a typical roller coaster from indie label, to major label, and back to indie label (the latest is Polyvinyl, on which they released 2005's Heart Like a River and this album.) The couple has been accompanied by drums and bass in the past, but on this release, they are mostly independent and acoustic, bending more in the direction of soft, folk-tinged pop-- mostly string-and-voice with some crucial piano additions-- and oozing the reflection that comes from living ""in the woods,"" as Mitchell described it at a recent New York show. While the title track is the most notable, a focal point with percussive oomph, there are a lot of others that are quietly impressive, percussion-free, and piano driven, like ""Surely Gone"". It hearkens back to the most touching songs of a contemporary like Liz Phair, though there is just as much flavor as a simple Beatles or Van Morrison ballad, and the easy but memorable tune from the piano saves the sweetness from getting cloying or the structure too clunky. In fact, the piano is really the star of the show here, as ""Lovers Prayers"" is well punctuated by the thick bass notes of the keys. Like many of their melodies, this one is wandering yet repetitive; a syncopated rhythm and peddling keys saves the whole thing from floating away. On ""Weight of the Straw"", the fluttering brush of the drums and voice take us to a Bacharach-like world of delicate strings and sunny vocals. Yet Mitchell and Littleton, often in duet, sound no more powerful than Low, who croon from deep inside a thicket of noisy and lush instruments. Here, Ida's instruments are just a legato backup, an airbrush of atmosphere, and it works to their advantage, even if the voices occasionally sound like mere powder puffs of color themselves. Ida have no concern whatsoever for what's cool, but they seem to instinctively know that an old traditional of string-and-piano aperitifs, which take several listens to know intimately, are enjoyable to a broad and patient selection of music lovers. Like Nina Nastasia's collaboration with Jim White, this album has just the right balance of popular ideas and remote ones; all are familiar, but those languorous tempos and scintillating guitars, as on ""First Light"", are wise and grown-up, not trite or somnolent. And knowing the relationship between the two performers certainly gussies up our reading of the songs; their partnership is strong and secret, yet it's being narrated rather openly to us: Here's how we jointly see things. There are a few songs on this release that mumble and pluck incoherently, though still prettily. And to be honest, the harmonies between the two are more impressive live, where an assortment of covers and older work peppers this mix. But the verdant, peaceful atmospheres of songs like ""Kora"" can thankfully be taken anywhere, and communicate a warmth and privacy that a stage just can't replicate.","The prolific Daniel Littleton and Elizabeth Mitchell return with a second full-length for Polyvinyl, as they expand their oeuvre of quiet, wistful, and accessible acoustic duets.

Longplay 2,Pacific UV,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b4cb5e6ef95969322677/1:1/w_160/1a3d4094.jpg,2008-03-10 06:00:04,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11205-longplay-2/,Warm,"It's been five years since Pacific UV's last full-length, with only a brief EP in 2006 to tide fans over. And yet, the first track on Longplay 2 (""Alarmist"") takes about three minutes to completely fade in from silence. I guess that's just how they roll-- none of Pacific UV's members will be mistaken for Bradford Cox, at least since the time they faked people into thinking they added two Swedes to their lineup and had a minor controversy about what the actual title of their debut. Longplay 2 comes in a no-frills package that keeps facts and talking points at a minimum, in accordance with the functionality of its title. This could be seen as a risk for a band whose amorphous lineup and drone-heavy mien threatens to brand them as more academic than personally approachable. Fortunately for the Portland-by-way-of-Athens group, it's able to stand on its own regardless of who's propping it up. Due to its rotating cast of vocalists (including guitarist Clay Jordan and Carolyn Berk of Lovers), Longplay 2 feels more like the work of a collective than a ""band"" and more of a collection than an ""album""; maybe something like a post-rock version of Studio's Yearbook 1. ""Alarmist"" and ""Orson"" function as the centerpieces (eight and ten minutes each, respectively), tapping into well thought-out twinkles like Sigur Ros' () on fewer Ambiens and more Vitamin Water. Which arguably makes things a little lacking in the white magic department, but if that record was your sort of thing to begin with, Longplay 2 will certainly prove every bit as comforting even if they sometimes choose to move icebergs with tugboats. The movements in ""Alarmist"" are slight, but necessary for the illusion of space flotation, while ""Arson"" unhurriedly shimmers towards a choir of chattering electronics. Among others, Pacific UV point to Mazzy Star and Spacemen 3 as influences, which might be the coordinates for Brightblack Morning Light; certainly, ""If So"" and ""Tremolo"" aren't giving off the same moonchild whiff, but they'd still sound fantastic in lunar rovers. In response to a criticism that Pacific UV's melodies were ""derivative,"" former member Lucas Jensen posted on a defunct blog (to paraphrase) ""Well, we only use two chords."" He's got a point; this sort of thing isn't meant to be nitpicked so much as consumed whole, and a tolerance for a high ratio of delay pedals vs. innovation is reasonable fee for the rewards reaped. ""Waiting"" takes the verse riff of Def Leppard's ""Hysteria"", of all things, and stretches it to infinity over washes of cymbal and a repeated incantation of ""I'm waiting for you to come home."" It might not sound like much on paper, but your significant other could be running 15 minutes late from work, and ""Waiting"" could make that time feel like an eternity of longing. Longplay 2 glides with such ease that the only real fence-sitter is ""Need"", a BRMC-evoking battle of fuzz soloing and detached vocals that's either a welcome kick in the pants or a mismatch with the rest of the material.

14 kt God,Panther,by: Andrew Gaerig,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b4c213d197565213ab69/1:1/w_160/0073cd21.jpg,2008-03-10 06:00:03,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11197-14-kt-god/,Kill Rock Stars,"On 2007's Secret Lawns, Panther mastermind Charlie Salas-Humara embraced the weirdo pop constructs of contemporary chart-pop producers; now, seemingly in an attempt to boil Secret Lawns to its roots he's stumbled into 14 kt God, another record that applies his nascent compositional talents to wily punk rock. 14 kt God is more conventional than its predecessor, however, and as a result it sounds less like a DIY Prince pastiche and more like a rangy Gang of Four or a less-abstract Pop Group. It's danceable, hook-oriented funk-punk with real-band dynamics and focused songwriting. The change unfortunately strips Panther of many of their defining elements: Salas-Humara's surprisingly passable falsetto and overdriven Casio tones disappear in favor of cellos, violas, and Joe Kelly's live drumming. Failed compositional choices no longer pass as googly-eyed pastiche. 14 kt God benefits, though, from sturdier arrangements, legit funk rhythms, and instrumental interplay that erases the image of a rogue latch-key kid wilding out over an 808. 14 kt God opener ""Puerto Rican Jukebox"" crystallizes the differences: a jittery guitar locks step with a descending bassline. Salas-Humara keeps phrases short and shouted, like the Rapture's Luke Jenner, as the track cycles through two or three distinct motifs that never explicitly establish a verse-chorus-verse relationship. So, you may long for the busy/mad skree of Secret Lawns but 14 kt God makes good use of its lithe, malleable guitar/bass/drum setup. ""Her Past Are the Trees"", ""Decision, Decision"", and ""Beautiful Condo"" jig and writhe around Salas-Humara's spindly axe work. Kelly earns his keep with spastic, controlled rhythms, coloring ""Her Past"" with orbiting cymbal crashes and adding a backbone of kickdrum to ""These Two Trees"". Panther sound best, though, when throwing change-ups: The album's only slow burner, ""Glamorous War"", lurches with an in-the-red electric organ. ""Take Yr Cane"" grooves on a distorted viola riff before a string section ushers in the chorus. ""On the Lam"" and ""These Two Trees"" abandon hooks in favor of dub-plate putty. The title track alternates between a playful chant and chunky, attenuated bursts of synth, as indecisive as anything from Secret Lawns but with greater sonic heft. Salas-Humara doesn't have the pipes to carry a rock band long-term-- see the cringe-inducing ""Violence, Diamonds"", whose ""Cave In, but funkier!""-patter almost sinks the first half of the album-- and he'd do well to incorporate more of Secret Lawns' goofball mannerisms: His Prince jones would sound comfortable inside ""Jukebox"" or ""Take Yr Cane"". 14 kt's move away from playful pop to rhythm-focused punk leads to some awkward groping, but there's enough hop in Salas-Humara and Kelly to keep the floor vibrating, even if the party has moved elsewhere.","The latest from Panther is danceable, hook-oriented funk-punk with real-band dynamics and focused songwriting.

The Hits,Kelis,by: Joshua Love,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b5109d034d5c69bf4f77/1:1/w_160/a241789b.jpg,2008-03-10 06:00:02,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11265-the-hits/,Virgin,"Kelis' 2006 hit ""Bossy"" was an oddly insecure piece of metatextual boasting, the R&B star making sure to remind us exactly who she is and what she's done. ""I brought all the boys to the yard""-- yeah Kelis, we remember, that song was absolutely inescapable just two years previous. ""I'm the one that's tattooed on his arm""-- don't worry, Nas enjoys being photographed in wifebeaters far too often for us to easily forget the image of you rendered topless in ink. Yet if anyone should feel paranoid about their status in the U.S. pop landscape, it's Kelis. Even with the ubiquity of ""Milkshake"", Kelis' career in her home country has been frustratingly checkered, exemplified by the fact that her second album, 2001's Wanderland, wasn't even released at home. Little surprise then that her newly released compendium, The Hits, isn't slated to hit shelves here either. While the Brits seem to have always gotten Kelis, America has never quite known what to do with her. I guess we tend to like our R&B singers more earnest and workmanlike than the mercurial former Neptunes protégé-- the duo produced her first two records (1999's Kaleidoscope and Wanderland), while contributing heavily to 2003's Tasty. Of course, as the messy, mishmashed The Hits attests, Kelis herself rarely seems certain of her persona either. Perhaps the affirmations of ""Bossy"" are just reminders to help herself stay on terra firma. The Hits conspicuously kicks off with Kelis' two most indelible songs, the angrily empowered nu-soul shouter ""Caught Out There"" and ""Milkshake"", but slamming these two wildly divergent tracks against each other does us no favors in helping to figure Kelis out. They're followed by the infamous ""Got Your Money"", the Ol' Dirty Bastard hit for which Kelis merely provided the hook. You'd think the decision to include this song, as well as Kelis' abbreviated turn on N.E.R.D's ""Truth or Dare"" would've given her label pause about putting out a best-of comp at all, until you remember her last record, 2006's Kelis Was Here, performed poorly even in her most enthused European marketplaces. Suddenly, The Hits looks like an exercise in salvaging a few bucks from a money pit. That said, there's plenty of essential material here that's been mostly overlooked over the course of Kelis' spotty-selling career: The winsome, skipping ""Get Along With You"" from her debut record and the arcade-effects thumper ""Young Fresh N' New"" from Wanderland are two particularly exemplary Neptunes-produced examples. Of course, Kelis is no mere vessel, and she expertly provides sass on ""Trick Me,"" lust on ""In Public"", and false modesty on ""Lil' Star"". Still, there's plenty of space between vessel and visionary, and this compilation does a worse job of focusing Kelis' artistic aims than either of her first two albums. The result is half-exhilirating, half-maddening, and comes across as oddly middle of the road.","Kelis' frustratingly checkered career is examined and, tellingly, the compilation-- like her underrated second album, Wanderland-- isn't being released in the U.S.

Volume One,She & Him,by: Grayson Currin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a155ea9e61561daa4792/1:1/w_160/2dffcc62.jpg,2008-03-10 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11260-volume-one/,Merge,"The grammatical inequality in the band name She & Him is significant, even if it's a joke or a mistake: The female with the nominative pronoun is Zooey Deschanel, the actress whose credits include Elf, All the Real Girls, and The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford. The male with the objective pronoun is Matt Ward, the John Fahey and Hank Williams acolyte who in eight years has risen from indie label obscurity to, arguably, the three or four spot in the active Merge Records rotation. Both Deschanel and Ward have their own successful careers, but on Volume One-- the first offering from their new collaborative band She & Him-- him is less than she. Although Ward produced the record and closet songwriter Deschanel only started sharing her songs at his request, the album succeeds mostly because those songs feel like familiar AM radio classics and because her voice offers instant emotional empathy. Ward's tasteful playing and sparse arrangements just serve to make something good that much better. She also narrates the 11 songs here, all about her changing relations to an anonymous him: On the charming ""Sentimental Heart"", she's wrecked, crying on the floor, lonely without him. One song later during ""Why Do You Let Me Stay Here?"", she's sitting on the shelf, playfully waiting for him to come over. On the petulant ""Take It Back"", she doesn't want to be loved, fooled, or wooed by him. One song later during ""I Was Made for You"", she's giddy over the smiling him in the street. The him in question changes throughout Volume One, but she relates to the masculine through a consistently naïve romanticism, whether it's riding a tandem bicycle alone on the somehow upbeat ""Black Hole"" or cheerfully telling girlfriends that love is a glorious but interminable conquest on ""This Is Not a Test"". Aside from two duets and obscurant backing vocals on one track, Ward serves as him only sonically, servicing the songs from the wings; thematically, Deschanel sings about a him that's not Ward at all. But Ward and the team he gathered for two Portland, Ore., sessions in Fall 2006 and Winter 2007-- Norfolk & Western/Decemberists/M. Ward drummer Rachel Blumberg, Saddle Creek production mainstay Mike Mogis, Devotchka violinist Tom Hagerman-- are invaluable to Volume One. Deschanel writes old pop songs built around black-and-white, simplistic emotions and dotted with vintage sexual innuendo (see ""Why Do You Let Me Stay Here?"" and ""Black Hole""). Her precious delivery suggests Loretta Lynn or any number of jazz vocalists minus a bit of brio, and the band-- which either builds gradually into its walls of sound or keeps things spartan and pristine-- helps the songs make sense. Ward provides an anxious staccato string arrangement and a Mellotron hum on ""Sentimental Heart"", teasing an optimism that, like Deschanel's romanticism, is always denied. Above Mogis' plaintive steel sighs and Ward's indifferent acoustic waltz on ""Change Is Hard"", her fragility becomes personal and endearing. Blumberg's big drums and Ward's stuttering electric line offer a platform for her elation on ""I Was Made For You"", and when Ward trails her voice on ""You Really Got a Hold on Me"", he's the perfect complement, his voice the shadow behind her sunlight. Deschanel is more convincing when she's on an extreme end of romance-- either losing it or being swept into it-- than when she's trying to rationalize it. She makes that mistake three times on Volume One. The other sense of disappointment here comes from the promise Volume One suggests but doesn't deliver: Deschanel's writing is too canny (""Why do you edit? Give me credit"") and her voice too natural (listen for that Feist-like crack on ""Change is Hard"") to sit on the tribute shelf very long. Granted, the retro exuberance here will be what sells She & Him to those beyond the indie realm. Don't be surprised when Garrison Keillor jumps on board. But with this successful introduction and the admitted homage to influences it entails finished, Deschanel has a solid foundation for building her own classic sound. After all, she's a readymade star who's already found a pretty fantastic facilitator in him.",,7.4,
Board Up the House,Genghis Tron,by: Robbie Mackey,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b4d5b1335d7bf169a7e7/1:1/w_160/301c196a.jpg,2008-03-07 06:00:04,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11213-board-up-the-house/,Relapse,"Aside from a few leftfield fetishists like Abiku, Philly robo-blasters Genghis Tron don't have many stylistic confidantes. And for better or worse, dudes stick religiously to their script on three EPs and one full-length for Crucial Blast-– each an elemental gush of drumerless pixel-skree, nothing more, nothing less. Which is all just to say that GT have always seemed pretty comfortable in their own tiny, claustrophobic box. So it's kind of cute they've dubbed their Relapse debut Board Up the House. But take a minute to figure out what Mookie Singerman is hollering about (hint: it's in the booklet), and the album title takes on a bit more than half-jokey overtones. At its core, House is a record about the psychology of claustrophobia, about feeling uncomfortable in that tiny box this band calls home. Here, characters are trapped in horrible lives, hiding from endless wars, boarding themselves up in houses and eventually, NSFW, rotting to death (check the album-opener). Overtaken by the same sort of cabin fever that sacked Singerman's pen, guitarist Hamilton Jordan and keyboardist Michael Sochynsky are doing the unthinkable this time out: they're writing conventional(-ish) songs. With verses and choruses and codas, even. Hard to believe, but from the House's first blow, the frenzied clutter of Dead Mountain Mouth gets packed into something much more focused, even refined. It's a sort of distilled clatter that forgoes the few dozen weedles of ""The Folding Road"" or the electro-grind mish-mash of Cloak of Love standout ""Arms"", for a handful of fat, gnarled riffs, some mega-huge Kurt Ballou guitar sounds, and a whole lotta order. Sure, ""The Feast"" is still a wild Agoraphobic Nosebleeder, getting by on the strength of the epileptic fits that won these guys the love of Relapse. But often the new, slightly more restrained Tron is capable of melding its poles-– the coarse grinds and the smooth electronics-– in much more convincing, cohesive ways. Take, for instance, the methodical beatdown of ""City on a Hill"", a track that relies on dynamic building blocks (blastbeat, keyboard patch, blastbeat and keyboard, keyboard patch, sputtering outro) over sheer force to achieve the same end result. Obviously, though, a band this used to blowing its load for three-minute intervals is going to make a few missteps. The tepid Team Sleep syrup of ""I Won't Come Back Alive"" forgets what made their music compelling in the first place: the energy. Plus, it's about three minutes too long. And the NIN flatness of ""Colony Collapse"" doesn't do the song any favors. But when they're on, tracks like ""Board Up the House"" make the first compelling case for Singerman and company as actual songwriters. Yeah, the strongest moments on Mouth occasionally suggested it, but here Genghis Tron establishes once and for all there's more to their sound than Cephalic Carnage records and Atari Teenage Riot worship. And now that they're out of that pesky box, it's going to be pretty interesting to see where they wind up.","On their first record for the Relapse label, this Philly-based band broadens their experimental metal/grindcore sound-- no drums, plenty of electronics-- to allow for more conventional songs.

Moonbeams,Throw Me the Statue,by: Stephen M.

Taken by Norwegian photographer Heidi Johansen, the image has the feel of an unstaged vacation souvenir: There's a boat in the background, a towel draped loosely around another woman's head, and a big toe intruding into the lower-left hand corner. It's well chosen: The casual composition and playful flash of nudity say quite a bit about the music contained therein, despite not including the name of the band or the title of the album. Moonbeams is a collection of loosely staged fuzz-pop songs about travel and sexual treachery, possessing a lens flare of regret even as they portray the singer-- or at least his first-person counterpart in these songs-- as a ""lusty"" soul living from one hook-up to another. Throw Me the Statue is the clunky pseudonym for Scott Reitherman, who plays almost every instrument on *Moonbeams * and even released it on his own label before signing with Secretly Canadian. He introduces opener ""Young Sensualists"" with a brief overture of bright synths, then fades into darker, droning chords for his tale of a beach-set love triangle. The simple plucked strings, programmed beat, and melodic guitar solo give the impression of one guy turning himself into a band. And yet, just as the title hints at youthful self-mythologizing, the vacation details suggest that the inspiration came not from a postcard tacked to a bedroom wall, but seemingly from real experience. The rest of Moonbeams bolsters that impression. Reitherman comes across as far too social-- and far too well-traveled-- for such a solitary pursuit; as the cover art suggests, he's too worldly and musically curious to shut himself in. Moonbeams features a small backing band and a revolving roster of guests, including multi-instrumentalist/producer Casey Foubert, who has worked with Pedro the Lion and Sufjan Stevens. There are horns on ""Groundswell"", samples on ""Yucatan Gold"", and what sounds like an ambient accordion on the title track. Occasionally Throw Me the Statue's musical range seems like an end in itself, as if eclectica were its own genre, but generally Reitherman's range highlights his hooks and wordplay. ""About to Walk"" begins with a static-crusted pong beat before Reitherman launches into a vocal melody that has him reaching into his upper range. ""Yucatan Gold"", another tale of a vacation dalliance, begins with a syncopated percussion sample that nods to Latin American music, but as the other instruments enter, all that remains of it is the cowbell, twitching on offbeats. ""She's a crazy animal when she screams,"" Reitherman sings. Overly dramatic and more than a little self-satisfied, it's a silly refrain-- an indie-pop nod to Girls Gone Wild. Following the ""juvie malaise"" of ""A Mutinous Dream"" and the hopped-up horn section of stand-out ""Groundswell"", the Hallmark imagery and funereal trumpet on the title track sounds too pedestrian, even for a song about his dead grandfather (well, especially for a song about his dead grandfather). Sure, it leads Reitherman to realize he'll be dead a hundred years from now, but that's a well-worn idea. Moonbeams is best when it is least sentimental, when Reitherman's antihero coldly accounts for his own actions and confusions. Fortunately, the album doesn't end with Reitherman flipping through old family photos, but with him softly singing ""The Happiest Man on This Plane"", a drifting acoustic valedictory that confuses sex with love. Again. Adding a bit of carnality to an often asexual genre, Throw Me the Statue's candor is compelling.","Throw Me the Statue is the pseudonym for Scott Reitherman, who plays almost every instrument on *Moonbeams *and even released it on his own label before signing with Secretly Canadian.

R.I.P.,Rocket from the Crypt,by: Stuart Berman,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a1e8ea9e61561daa48f2/1:1/w_160/48e86c99.jpg,2008-03-07 06:00:02,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11250-rip/,Swami,"Glastonbury Festival, June 1998: A torrential downpour has turned the fields into an ocean of E. coli, flooding the festival grounds to the point where even Nick Cave can be seen milling about in standard-issue Welly rain boots. But up on the Other Stage, Rocket From the Crypt are looking like a million bucks (or, roughly £500,000). Halfway through their set, John ""Speedo"" Reis parts the crowd and challenges the more daring members of the audience to use the empty space as a mud slide; after five minutes of watching inebriated Englishmen hurtle themselves face down into the brown, Reis stops mid-song, flashes a shit-eating grin a mile wide, and announces, ""Ladies and gentlemen, if we have learned anything here today, it's that you can dive face first into pig shit, and still not be famous."" Sadly, for Rocket From the Crypt, you could haul ass for 15 years, release 11 albums, and even get Interscope to pay for two of them, and still be only slightly more famous than a bunch of British knuckleheads swimming in mud. But then Rocket From the Crypt were early 1990s punks who operated much like an indie rock band circa now, releasing a seemingly inexhaustible supply of quality singles and EPs at a clip that hearkened the current post-blog de-emphasis on the album, while their atomic fusion of Springsteen and the Stooges foreshadowed indie rock's now-perfunctory Boss worship. But where so many contemporary indie rock bands pay lip-service to Bruce's all-American authenticity, RFTC were more proponents of the E Street big-band theory, favoring breathless, soul-revue-styled set lists, titanic blasts of brass, and only the most self-aggrandizing stage banter. So it's fitting that when the San Diego sextet announced their final show on Oct. 31 2005-- as per their tradition of Halloween homecoming shows-- the venue of choice was not a local punk-rock landmark like the Casbah, but rather the ballroom in the Westin Horton Plaza Hotel. However, as last-show documents go, the CD/DVD package R.I.P.-- arriving perhaps two years too late, but just in time to herald the arrival of Reis' new band, the Night Marchers-- is determinedly low on sentimentality. It's hard to get too choked up when you've got El Vez reading your eulogy (""they were so young!""), and Reis taking the stage dressed as Screaming Jay Hawkins-- complete with nose bone-- to warm up with a goofy riff on ""I Put a Spell On You"". But after this awkwardly stagy intro-- Reis admits himself it's ""long, boring and [goes] nowhere"" in the entertainingly no-bullshit liner notes-- it's all business. ""We invented this type of music,"" Reis declares six songs in, ""it's called rock'n'roll."" He's half right: What RFTC really do is rock'n'roar-- you don't so much listen to songs like ""Boychucker"" and ""Don't Darlene"" as brace yourself for their rib-bruising onslaught of sax and violence. The chain-fight menace is reinforced by the fact that R.I.P.'s career-spanning set-list is stacked with one-two punches pulled sequentially from the original albums: ""I'm Not Invisible""/""Get Down"" (from 2002's Live From Camp X-Ray), ""Light Me""/""A+ in Arson Class"" (1995's The State of Art Is on Fire EP), ""Middle""/""Born in '69"" (1995's Scream, Dracula, Scream!). Like all great prizefighters, Rocket give you nary a second to figure out what hit you before hitting again. The 51-minute CD portion of R.I.P. features only part of the full 95-minute set documented in grainy digital video on the DVD, and with good reason: this chaotic concert is marked by the sort of intrusions-- a tossed plastic gun to Reis' head during ""Jumper K. Balls,"" an over-eager stage diver derailing ""Carne Voodoo"" mid-song-- that make for more interesting viewing than listening. But you still have to question some of the editing choices: a meat-slab-tough version of Hot Charity's ""My Arrow's Aim"" doesn't make the album cut at the expense of momentum-curbing selections like ""Shy Boy"" and ""Velvet Touch"" (both from 1991's Paint as a Fragrance), and while the CD omission of RFTC's one alt-rock semi-hit, ""On a Rope"" suits the band's contrarian attitude (says Reis in the liners, ""[it's] the song that will forever be our piss stain on the footnotes of underground 90s rock lore...I still get checks for $13.92 every year. In some parts of the world I can buy an ox and fuck it for that price.""), R.I.P. feels less like a definitive career-capper as a result. But such quibbles are forgotten by the time we hit the late-set airing of Circa: Now!'s triumphant grunge waltz ""Ditch Digger"", where, even without the benefit of a DVD, you can just picture the costumed crowd raising their arms to valiantly brandish those RFTC tattoos that can no longer be used to get into shows for free. Even in its dying moments, a Rocket From the Crypt show is no place to get all emotional, but if only for a few minutes, you just might confuse all that sweat for tears.","Two years after their dissolution, RFTC-- an atomic fusion of Springsteen and the Stooges-- offer a CD/DVD that packages their final show.

Her voice often seems more typical of shoegaze or introverted folk than 1980s-cribbing pop, but she strikes the right note of dreaminess and cool drama in Sambassadeur's songs. The band gently buttresses her vocals with guitar and synth rhythms that percolate playfully, creating a wistful contrast with her sustained vocals. This combination of textures-- like tweed under silk-- lent past singles like ""Between the Lines"" and ""Kate"", from the band's 2005 home-recorded self-titled debut and their Coastal Affairs EP respectively, their melancholy charm and distinctive personality among their Swedish contemporaries. The big news on the band's follow-up LP, Migration, is that Sambassadeur have changed their sound considerably. If they flirted with lo-fi indie pop in the past, these new songs sound triumphantly hi-fi circa 1986, fitting lush, rainy-day pop melodies with the ornate flourishes of Book of Love-- singles ""Final Say"" and ""Subtle Changes"" explode out of their verse-chorus-verse, three-minute restrictions. Nine tracks clocking in at just over half an hour, Migration manages to sound simultaneously sprawling and succinct. ""The falling of stars will come back in fashion again,"" Persson sings on ""Subtle Changes"", and it sounds less like nostalgia than a musical mission statement. The song's galloping pace pushes Persson's vocals into her upper range, suggesting hopefulness in the face of so much hurt and regret. On opener ""The Park"", she pleads with a friend or lover to ignore their big problems for the moment and just enjoy a park bench together, ""making comments on the people passing by,"" and the chipper synths and the keyboards set to woodwind-- familiar enough to make you think you recognize it-- give her plea a sense of desperation. Even as these new bells and whistles make the songs more elaborate and immediate, in actuality Sambassadeur sound more or less the same. The style is still subdued baroque, the overriding mood still dreamy and downcast, their primary subject still romantic disillusionment. It's fitting that their cover of Dennis Wilson's ""Lady (Fallin' in Love)"" comes across as ruminative and rueful instead of celebratory. Singing ""I'm in love in love in love with my baby,"" Persson doesn't sound like she's shouting it from the rooftops, but resigning herself to the inevitable heartache ahead. For her, love is bad, bad news. Immediately following ""Fallin' in Love"", the title track sounds even more like a cover, sporting a 60s-style hook that makes a sad pun of the marital declaration ""I do."" This pair of songs, adorned mostly with guitar and drums, recall the Sambassadeur of previous releases, but with a stronger interpretive bent and a grimmer sense of humor. So it's a little disappointing when Daniel Permbo takes over vocals for ""Someday We're Through"". Instead of forming a he-said, she-said dialogue with Persson, the change is simply abrupt, isolating the song from the album. He does a passable job with the slightly more bitter song, but it only reminds you how much more commanding Persson is. Between that song and the instrumental closer ""Calvi"", Migration ends on a sleepy note, where once it had been subtle and insinuating. Even the relatively upbeat ""Something to Keep"", sandwiched between the two, can't rouse the album's final third out of this dreary daze.",,7.0,

McPhun's work as the Ruby Suns functions in much the same way: Stationed on New Zealand's North Island, the California native dresses his work in global music, nibbling at the edges of unfamiliar sounds but, ultimately, skillfully creating sunny psych-pop. The result is an album of environments, both natural and imagined, hinted at by the cover art's pastel Candyland, the collage of African wildlife on the CD insert, and McPhun's tributes to his home state's Mojave desert and Joshua Trees (""Oh, Mojave""). The album's title refers to the colony of animals that sun in the ocean off of California's Highway 1, and on ""There Are Birds"", co-vocalist Amee Robinson pines for a world where ""there are birds and it is calm."" A host of animal references doesn't equate to an environmentally conscious album, but Sea Lion takes to heart quaint state park signage: take only pictures, leave only footprints. The Ruby Suns visit the world via an array of global signifiers-- pinging conga drums, field recordings of animals, slight, sunny harmonies-- but as they do, the band sounds genuinely curious and respectfully adoptive rather than calculating or opportunistic. Sea Lion, therefore, has a fair amount of clutter-- expect comparisons to musically busy peers like Panda Bear or the Russian Futurists, and to the jumbled orchestral experimentation of Olivia Tremor Control-- but the album's building blocks ooze with a homespun grace. Opener ""Blue Penguin"" rubs the sleep out of its eyes before grinding a dirty acoustic guitar into overdriven tape. The tender horns on ""Remember"" are reminiscent of the gentle indie rock of Beulah before introducing a coda of warm, looped sighing. ""Adventure Tour""'s high-pitched, descending choruses recall Avey Tare. ""Tane Mahuta"", sung in indigenous Maori, provides the sole link to McPhun's adopted home, but the song's furious strumming and dewy harmonies are straight from power- and African- (think Tabu Ley) pop. Sea Lion likely will be pegged a great guitar-pop album, but it's more sonically complex than that suggests. Intriguingly, some of its stylistic conceits-- the 4AD hum of ""There Are Birds"" or the New Order-via-Graceland second half of ""Morning Sun""-- are found on both their most straightforward and best pop moments. Meanwhile, the unfortunately titled ""It's Mwangi in Front of Me"", and the even worse ""Kenya Dig It?"", provide the record its most abstract, collage-inspired moments. Sea Lion's one constant is its hard-charging positivity; even songs that begin with a slow drizzle (""Ole Rinka"") or hesitant atmospherics (""Blue Penguin"") end up as paeans to suns or birds or-- most traditionally-- love.

Residue Hymns EP,Magic Weapon,by: Eric Harvey,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b4b0ea9e61561daa6cb8/1:1/w_160/5ef348b5.gif,2008-03-06 06:00:05,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11180-residue-hymns-ep/,self-released,"At the climax of ""Pipe Dreams"", the opening song from Magic Weapon's Residue Hymns, Jordan Robson-Cramer nonchalantly sings, ""I've got my blood in you."" To that point the song has been a complex argument of some sort, and this quiet statement could be a declaration of love or a recognition of some hereditary overlap (or both.) As on much of his work under this title, Robson-Cramer doesn't seem to care about discovering or revealing details as much as reveling in the absurdity of bewilderment. On Hymns, the Sunset Rubdown drummer's second EP as Magic Weapon and first with the lineup of drummer Matt Shane (Think About Life) and guitarist Rory Seydel (Shapes & Sizes), he creates a hallucinatory borderland between the real and imagined, his songs taking place in dark alleyways, film fantasies, dashed empires and-- appropriately for an indie band with such a pedigree-- music scenes. Hymns' murkiness is matched by its sense of magnitude. Robson-Cramer mashes surreal lyrics with grandiose, organ-driven backdrops, clattering rhythmic patterns, and peals of distended guitar, like Spencer Krug minus Bowie plus the sounds associated with another trio of interchangeable parts, Emerson, Lake & Palmer. The title track's opening organ sounds like something from ELP's Pictures at an Exhibition, but is lent a modern sense of grotesque majesty with the refrain ""She's having a seizure in dark alleyways and coughing up globs of light."" Robson-Cramer toys with ideas of sovereignty-- ""Charles (the Red One)"" sounds like the tale of a boy king-- and ties empires and epitaphs together with his chosen profession on the torrential ""Sandstorms"". More concerned with getting the point across than with staying on key, Robson-Cramer's singing voice situates Magic Weapon in the here and now. His vitriolic, emotive, indie sing-yell splits the difference between trumpeting and, well, whining. Maybe long ago mastery could be attained at such a young age, but in 2008, Robson-Cramer's tentative grasp on expressing intensity hints at why Hymns-- while a big improvement over its comparatively muddy predecessor-- is his second EP instead of first LP. Robson-Cramer's intonations locate Magic Weapon in a mythical realm, but his antiquarian leanings run head-first into the post-modern via ""Blood Songs"", where he pricks himself and bleeds blue, railing against charlatans who phone in meaningless, pre-fab indignation for rent check money. Appropriately for someone so swathed in sincerity, Robson-Cramer goes scorched-earth against those who opt for the ironic as a misguided strategy of ""embracing all the worthless"" which follows ""the tune of all misguided exclamations."" I probably shouldn't expect anything less than archaic fire and brimstone rhetoric from a record titled Residue Hymns, of course; but it also results, more often than not, in the music itself resonating as warmly as a weathered limestone monument.","Second EP from the group led by Sunset Rubdown sideman Jordan Robson-Cramer-- now including drummer Matt Shane (Think About Life) and guitarist Rory Seydel (Shapes & Sizes)-- is an improvement on the project's murky debut.

What Doesn't Kill Us,What Made Milwaukee Famous,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b4ca9d034d5c69bf4f0b/1:1/w_160/74d2aa09.jpg,2008-03-06 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11204-what-doesnt-kill-us/,Barsuk,"Wisecracks in regards to What Made Milwaukee Famous' debut on Barsuk were most likely to take the Austin four-piece to task for a sense of geographical confusion, but I'll be damned if that name doesn't make a hell of a lot of sense this time around. Like the potent potable its name suggests, the band increasingly feels like a gateway to the harder, better stuff. If What Doesn't Kill Us carries anything over from Trying to Never Catch Up, it's a sense of variety, although that feels less like the result of artistic restlessness than a buffet-style approach to the Hear Music rack. The first time around that could be attributed to the fact that the record was Frankensteined from a 2004 release, but excuses are harder to come by here. The sludgy waltz of ""Blood, Sweat & Fears"" attempts to mate the brooding masculinity of Britt Daniel with the fevered literacy of Will Sheff in some sort of Austin dream sum, but it doesn't go much beyond ""sludgy waltz."" As far as science experiments go, however, it's better that than ""Sultan"", which brazenly solders together Billy Joel's ""My Life"" and Spoon's ""The Beast and Dragon, Adored"" with astonishingly flip transparency. The sense of resolve suggested by a title like What Doesn't Kill Us is contradicted by the album's hangdog lyrics. The self-pitying Ryan Adams grab bag ""Cheap Wine"" sounds suspiciously jaded for a band that finally got a chance to break out of the SXSW holding pattern. ""When I come into your town/ All it ever does is bring me down"" Michael Kingcaid sings before his band explodes into a ruckus that's right in line with the topical search for easy answers. Half as long, and exponentially more successful, is the two-minute rave-up of ""The Right Place"", but all this blind dart throwing and we're only a third of the way through. So, you get the idea; most of what follows can generally be filed under ""indie rock"" not so much for a pioneering spirit, but...well, you have any better ideas? At least some songs bring energy to the proceedings: After ""And the Grief Goes On...,"" you'll be headed back to Wilco's Sky Blue Sky to remember what it did right, and ""Resistance St."" or ""Prevailing Wind"" throw up softball progressions that sound like they could've been something with soaring vocal melodies. ""In the middle of the night,"" Kingcaid declares on the dorm-room strummer of the same name, ""Everything's gonna be all right/ What you need is love, sweet love."" Freed by the liberty of succumbing to cliché, they repeat it over and over again before you can hear the brooms sweeping during the last call of ""The Other Side"", which bares little divergence to any other song about the same thing. That shouldn't come as much of a shock, considering these guys are obviously fond of slogans-- but you can't help but think that records such as What Doesn't Kill Us inspire movements like Keep Austin Weird.","Austin four-piece returns with another record of kitchen-sink indie rock.

Transparent Knives,Promise and the Monster,by: Amy Granzin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b4c19d034d5c69bf4efa/1:1/w_160/9ca15874.jpg,2008-03-06 06:00:03,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11196-transparent-knives/,Imperial,"Promise and the Monster is a children's book about a pony named Promise and a monster called, well, presumably, Monster. Promise and the Monster is also the adopted name of Swedish singer/multi-instrumentalist (guitar, cello, flute, organ, glockenspiel) Billie Lindahl, who, at 19, isn't that far-removed from picture-book reading herself. As if traced from some market-tested ""indie girl"" template, Lindahl has Feistian dark bangs and a coltish, eye-skirting demeanor, and sings in a high, breathy, elfin chirp in the neighborhood-- though with nowhere near the fence-building potential-- of Joanna Newsom. That sounds unbearably precious, but it isn't. Lindahl's songs are as indebted to pre-adolescence as her moniker, but they don't document devotion to ponies or, I dunno, Disney's mind-bogglingly successful High School Musical, but anxiety over skin, bodies, adult sexuality. ""I think I'd rather be made out of porcelain. Because I hate the body as a physical object,"" Lindahl has said, sounding like that girl at the party with her nose defensively buried in a battered copy of The Sorrows of Young Werther, wishing she had the courage to speak to someone (so stated, hopefully, with a smidgeon of self-mockery). But her first LP, Transparent Knives, pursues this theme relentlessly with a succession of frigid motifs: shivering lips, frozen sheets of skin, steel veins channeling cold, roots recoiling into winter soil. Lindahl's vocals perch high in the songs' chilly mixes like carrion birds dispassionately surveying snow-sheathed hills for fresh kill. At the same time, she articulates repulsion's inevitable corollary-- attraction. ""When I watch you sing/ Along with that song/ I love the way you move,"" she coos contradictorily in ""Night Out"", more fire than ice. Lindahl shares a label (and has toured) with countryman José González, and fingerpicked figures and classical guitar cadences mark Transparent Knives' surfaces. The common carp about González-- that all the songs sound the same, even the covers-- might also implicate Promise and the Monster. ""Antarktis"", ""Light Reflecting Papers"" and ""Trials"" are powered by low steady currents rather than fuse-blowing surges, their arabesque guitar figures shapeshifting languorously via subtle tempo and tone permutations. This makes for ethereal and mesmerizing, but not always memorable, music. Lindahl's capable of dynamic arrangements, though. ""Night Out""'s chorus explodes like a thicket of fireflies against the midnight sky, its double-tracked vocals and string section marking the album's warmest, and Euro-poppiest, moment. While ""Sheets'"" organ vamps aren't exactly electrifying, they shade the track with spooky gothic menace. And her version of Carter Family staple ""Single Girl, Married Girl"", trades mountain-folk fatalism for percolating plucked strings and a sprightly singsong. Sweden's thick on the ground with chanteuse-troubadour types these days, and the more obviously charismatic El Perro del Mars and Jens Lekmans of the scene could easily overshadow Promise and the Monster's dark, diffident presence. Which would be a pity. Transparent Knives is a tuneful, complex-- and surprisingly mature-- debut from a kid who's likely to have even more to say as she accumulates life experience.","Swedish singer/multi-instrumentalist and José González labelmate Billie Lindahl documents anxiety over skin, bodies, and sexuality on her tuneful, complex debut album.

"Some Racing, Some Stopping",Headlights,by: Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b4fac0084474cd0c235f/1:1/w_160/95fc5acc.jpg,2008-03-06 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11244-some-racing-some-stopping/,Polyvinyl,"Headlights probably aren't going to rewire your synapses or hip you to the new subgenre, and that's sort of why I feel bad I don't like them more than I do. Stacked up against an increasingly cluttered media climate, bands can sometimes slip through the cracks simply because the pleasures they offer don't translate well to one-liners and pithy blurbs-- especially when what sets them apart isn't style, ambition, or personality so much as warm, welcoming production and reasonably sharp hooks. This three-piece from Champaign, Ill., introduced themselves as another such sleeper band on 2006's Kill Them With Kindness: a varied, melodic indie-pop debut album recalling New Pornographers, Grandaddy, and Stars. Some Racing, Some Stopping is another disc of unassuming, well-crafted charms, sweetening its predecessor's already gentle brew with splashes of folk-pop, alt-country, and 1960s girls groups. Erin Fein still trades her light, airy vocals with Tristan Wraight's indie-dude murmurs, but here Wraight is more likely to be strumming an acoustic guitar than crunching out electric guitar chords. Headlights drummer Brett Sanderson helms the production, and like Death Cab for Cutie's Chris Walla, he proves himself able to get out of the way, so that chiming percussion, Fein's pealing keyboards, and even a bit of accordion by Decibully's Nick Sanborn can all pass by without calling attention to themselves for those who might dislike twee-pop, synth-pop, or accordion. Strings were the most grandiose thing about Kill Them With Kindness, opening the album in chamber-pop finery; Some Racing, Some Stopping integrates orchestral touches more fully into the songs, none of which linger past the four-minute mark. Slog dutifully through as much self-important art music as we do and such restraint seems even more admirable, but it's hardly Headlights' greatest strength. Bands like Rogue Wave and Rilo Kiley also make clean, concise guitar pop that's easily palatable for everyone from indie kids to TV licensing crews to your aunt whose last musical purchase was Norah Jones-- the second one. But not since The Execution of All Things, or possibly not even then, has either band done anything as flat-out pretty as Some Racing, Some Stopping's first mp3, the love-blissed ""Cherry Tulips"". See? That wouldn't be a pithy blurb. Other songs aren't always as distinctive, but do have appeal. ""Towers"" is a slower song with a ""Cherry Tulips""-like arrangement, Fein singing softly about summer breezes and skinned knees, though all you'll probably remember is a wordless ""ahh ahh"" or ""ooh ooh"" here or there. Sanderson's drumming fills the air with hi-hats and early-Beatles snares on ""On April 2"", while the stripped-down title track gracefully confirms that Some Racing, Some Stopping refers to, aww, hearts. ""So Much for the Afternoon"" is dream-pop that glides by like a lazy summer Sunday. That tendency to drift, to fade into the background, is part of what makes the album such an effortless listen, but it also makes some tracks unremarkable. With ringing, wistful acoustic guitar, ""Market Girl"" could be a latter-day Death Cab for Cutie song, though Wraight's vocal and lyrics are both more anonymous than I'd expect from Ben Gibbard. And Wraight's whispers are jarringly Elliott Smith-like on plodding nadir ""January"", one of the rare moments on the album where a single element calls attention to itself at the expense of the track as a whole. Some Racing, Some Stopping is the kind of record, in other words, that you'd expect casual listeners to enjoy and critics to unfairly malign. Like I said, I'm not thrilled about it, but I don't think I'm being unfair. For all the giddy heights of ""Cherry Tulips"", it's hard to imagine many people ending a hard day rushing to their headphones so they can lose themselves in opener ""Get Your Head Around It"", where Wraight sings, ""The things I will keep/ Are never in my sleep."" If you can stick to moderation, the album has its share of contentments-- and a couple of real delights, too.","Latest from the Illinois band is another sleeper of an indie pop record-- another disc of unassuming, well-crafted charms that threatens to be overlooked.

Turning Dragon,Clark,by: Ryan Dombal,Features Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b4f6b1335d7bf169a81e/1:1/w_160/52e348ac.jpg,2008-03-06 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11240-turning-dragon/,Warp,"In a recent interview, electronic music producer Chris Clark admitted he's ""a bit of a perfectionist"" when it comes to producing his beyond-intricate instrumentals. This is an understatement. Considering the Warp disciple's flair for pinpoint micro-rhythms, Clark's compositions come across like the inner whirlings of a beautifully disturbed mind. His beats rev up only to exhale into cleansing waves of static; each synthetic echo is draped with an echo of its own; oscillating fragments drift in and out of songs like unsettling half dreams-- this is imposing music. And without Clark's penchant for bruising emotion, it would be as useless as a stack of crashed, clicking hard drives. The human logic within his wave forms is convoluted but nonetheless present; Chris Clark is the guy with the bomb-rubble room-- a leaning pile of CDs here, gear head mags there, questionably clean clothes everywhere-- in which everything is oddly in its right place. Across his first three albums, Clark utilized his talents with steely machines and warmer acoustic instruments-- including pianos and drums-- to assemble increasingly fluid tapestries, culminating with 2006's masterful Body Riddle. That album-- which attempted to answer the body's queries from the inside out-- assured its longevity with an all-encompassing attention to detail: Two years later, fresh folds continue to reveal themselves. Turning Dragon takes a detour from Clark's ultimate goal of meshing man and machine into one seamless, clattering bundle. Consisting of material tailored during frenetic live gigs and pegged as a counterpart to Body Riddle rather than a proper follow-up, Dragon finds the robots taking the upper hand. Clark's OCD tendencies are still apparent, but they're conveyed in a markedly brasher manner-- snares snarl, samples fire off semi-automatically, and the compression gets bumped up to Justice levels. It's the fire-breathing flipside to Riddle's contemplative stateliness. And it's liberating to hear this sonic manicurist doing his best to freak out. Clark wastes no time in addressing his newly hedonistic agenda with the appropriately titled ""New Year Storm"". Ostensibly, this is his take on straight-up techno, but the near-industrial 4/4 pummels more than it pulses as it attempts to push through the producer's constant barrage of air-raid assaults-- this is what Trent Reznor wants to sound like in 2008. Galvanizing beasts ""Volcan Veins"" and ""Truncation Horn"" both employ micro-sampling to punctuate their soaring-BPM onslaughts; in the midst of these recklessly caffeinated raves, Missy Elliott and INXS are nothing but scattershot pawns in Clark's twisted game. After the record's initial manic three-track bum rush, things settle into a slightly less leg-cracking groove. ""For Wolves Crew"" is the requisite Chris Clark album-within-a-song stunner: Before the seven-minute epic is through, we've heard the sound of a wood plank falling down metal stairs, a remixed alien transmission, and even some sped-up grime backed by a soothing, circular synth line. The whole disc sometimes risks becoming a tiresome test of modern beatmaking at its noisiest, but Clark is wise to include small-yet-essential breathers into the mix-- ""Hot May Slides"" acts as a side B sigh before ""Beg"" and ""Penultimate Persian"" close this scarily accomplished excursion with genre-melting finesse. So while Dragon may be billed as a visceral antidote to Clark's impossibly complex Erector Set productions, it still has all the markings of a confessed perfectionist. Yet, as Clark himself said last year, ""To make complex music with machines is actually pretty easy-- it's the mastering of technology rather than the mastering of music."" While Dragon lacks some of the pathos of Clark's richest work, he's still much more than a mere button-pusher chasing the next plug-in. The struggle between his superhuman technical acumen and his desire to access nothing less than the secrets of the human condition continues to play out here, albeit on a more brazen plane. He's the ideal type of musical perfectionist-- one who realizes flawlessness is unattainable, but strives for it headlong all the same.","On this fire-breathing flipside to 2006's stately Body Riddle, the Warp producer issues a visceral take on the art of modern beatmaking.

Little Happyness,The Aluminum Group,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b4b513d197565213ab54/1:1/w_160/9e7b0e7e.jpg,2008-03-05 06:00:05,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11186-little-happyness/,Minty Fresh,"It's hard to believe that back in the 1980s, long before forming the Aluminum Group, John and Frank Navin were in a hardcore band. It's about as opposite to the sensibilities they tap for their current project as you can get; when you listen to the music and take into account the fact that they've now pursued this concern for over ten years, it's clear that they followed their hearts into the Aluminum Group. Their choice to go with a sound heavy on the vintage easy listening seems more apt every year, too-- when they started there weren't a whole lot of people outside of Stereolab, Jim O'Rourke, and some scattered lounge revivalists doing this kind of thing, but breezy, plush indie pop has since become a much larger niche. Little Happyness theoretically closes out a trio of releases that began with 2002's Happyness and continued with 2004's Morehappyness, but apart from titles and freaky fractalized faces on the covers it's hard to see what exactly unifies the three works thematically. They are similar sonically, though, and these three albums could be seen as something of a second phase for the band, a sleeker descendant of the heavily orchestrated music they made on their early albums. The Navin brothers have always had a penchant for literate lyrics sprinkled with references, and that persists here. It's hard, actually, to think of a lyrical approach that would fit better with their sophisticated, highly designed, and reserved aesthetic. John McEntire of Tortoise and the Sea & Cake, the latter of whom is the Aluminum Group's closest point of comparison, is back in the producer's chair, oddly joined by Prada designer Fabio Zambernardi, whose presence makes more sense once you've heard the music. The first thing that's apparent-- and you already know this if you've followed these guys-- is just how much control they have of every aspect of their sound. There is not a note or phrase out of place-- which could be a recipe for sterility, but rarely is for them. ""Headphones"" is a smooth-as-silk anthem for the iPod generation with a superb chorus and memorable verses, all sung from the perspective of a guy on an elevator standing next to someone listening to music so loudly that he can hear all 16 tracks of the recording. The band's trademark close harmonies and lightly buzzing synths make it go down easy. The album's bookends, ""Milligram of Happiness"" and ""The World Doesn't Spin on Us"", are likewise superb pieces of well-cushioned indie pop, with airy harmonies and swaying beats-- the first one in particular feels like an update of Steely Dan's best moments. ""Paper Crowns (Runaway Bride)"" has a different feel from anything I can think of in their catalog, with a dancier beat, an assertive post-punk bass line, and a bed of synths that suggest a lost Stereolab backing track. They flirted with this type of thing on Pelo, but didn't nail it so precisely. Not every track has a grabbing melody to build around, and these are naturally the lowlights of the album (""Atlantic"" and ""Post It"" are especially sketchy), but even a few of them grow on you. ""Checking Out"" slipped right past me on the first several listens but eventually revealed itself as an engagingly mysterious track that even expands their range a bit. Little Happyness is a more-than-satisfying conclusion to the Happyness series and, after Pedals, is in fact one of the band's best albums.","The newest album of sleek, sophisticated pop from the Navin brothers closes out a trilogy of sorts and is among their finest records.

Mirror/Messenger,Major Stars,by: Aaron Leitko,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b4c0b1335d7bf169a7c0/1:1/w_160/866447fa.jpg,2008-03-05 06:00:04,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11195-mirrormessenger/,Drag City,"Playing in a modern psych-rock band is, in many ways, like being a guitar-toting Live Action role-player-- reliving 1969 not as it was, but as we feel it should have been. The genre can be a playground of vintage instrument-wielding longhairs clad in period frock-- if you're at a Mammatus or Acid Mothers Temple show you might even see a wizard cloak or two. Boston's Major Stars, however, have a pretty unique voice for a psych-rock band, but it's kind of hard to hear it on their latest album, Mirror/Messenger. On 2005's 4 Major Stars guitarists Wayne Rodgers and Kate Biggar labored under the pretense of verse and chorus only for as long as it took somebody to drop a lead foot on the wah-wah pedal and send the band choogling off into shred-oblivion. But Mirror/Messenger revels in fuzzy freak-outs-- it's pleasantly free of retro-stoner affectations and heavy on punk-inspired edge. Mirror/Messenger therefore finds Major Stars at their most accessible-- there are verses, choruses, and only a few songs that stray over the four-minute mark. The record's best moments, like the laid back ""East to West"", are loud and heavy, but sound familiar to anybody who's listened to Dinosaur Jr. Rodgers has wisely ceded vocal duties to Sandra Barrett and, while her classic rock tenor is more than a little reminiscent of Heart's Ann Wilson, it's a step forward from Rogers, whose dull growl recalled a despondent Dave Grohl. Meanwhile Rogers is left free to join fellow guitarists Kate Biggar and Tom Leonard (who handed bass duties off to Dave Dougan) in kicking up a larger and wilder noise-- so much noise in fact, that it's hard to fit anything else comfortably on the record. The three-guitar approach allows everything on Mirror/Messenger to sound thrillingly heavy. The album's title track and closer fits a guitar into every spare inch of space-- there's always somebody with a spare limb to jimmy the wah-wah pedal up and down, bend notes, and pummel strings into dust. As a result the rhythm section winds up buried. On ""Portable Freak Factory"" Casey Keenan's drums crumble into a dull racket as soon as the song's chugging core riff vanishes. Meanwhile, the only way to shoehorn in Barrett's vocals is to dial them way up into the mix, making her sound awkwardly and disproportionately present. On ""No More"" she comes across like an afterthought-- unnaturally Frankensteined over the top of an otherwise tight instrumental jam. Plenty of good psych records have sounded bad in the past; indeed many of them even made a virtue out of sounding bad. Nobody bought a Mainliner record for clarity (although, nobody really bought them in the first place). But Mirror/Messenger deserves better than that. For the first time in Major Stars' career they've produced a set of structurally tight compositions that stand out stylistically among their peers-- songs that deserve to be heard with some sort of clarity. But as it is, Mirror/Messenger doesn't cut through the din.","Boston psych-rock band's latest is pleasantly free of retro-stoner affectations and heavy on punk-inspired edge, resulting in the group's most accessible record to date.

L.A.'s Warbringer are, well, not only bringing the, um, war-- and as their debut verifies, bringin' it without end (!)-- but also building an impressive underground buzz as one of the premier new school thrash bands. They allegedly range in age from 17 to 22 years, and march in stride with other young metal militia such as Municipal Waste, Fueled by Fire, Toxic Holocaust, and Meltdown. Warbringer's debut isn't only fun and nostalgic, however, but a hugely impressive, geeked-out style-study of the albums that have become the thrash blueprints. These kids have either listened to the same six-to-eight albums so incessantly that they've internalized every Kill 'Em All/Reign in Blood riff, or these dudes literally sit down and have a caucus deciding which passages sound like they were appropriately crafted between 1983 and 1987. Essentially, Warbringer sound like modern-day E-string chuggaholic purists, and they've made a record that sounds exactly like slightly altered phrases from the early classics. Unlike new school thrash-y bands such as Shadows Fall they don't dabble in metalcore, death-metal, or anything except old-school speed. Assisting these insanely specific and spot-on recreations is the production work of Bill Metoyer, the noted knob-tweeker behind early albums from Slayer, D.R.I., and Dark Angel. On the anthemic album opener (and likely live mainstay) ""Total War"", vintage Slayer and Exodus chunklets lock horns while blown out Dave Mustaine–like solos get WWF smackdowns via Kerry King-esque dissonant tremolo bar dive bombs. Extra party-dude testosterone comes courtesy of gang-chorus backup vocals à la Anthrax. Elsewhere, ""Systematic Genocide"" begins with an intro a smidge too similar to key moments from Metallica tracks ""For Whom the Bell Tolls"", ""Trapped Under Ice"", and ""Creeping Death"", but it's then tickled with a little of Anthrax's ""Caught in a Mosh"". Vocals and lyrics are also time machine-authentic, lyrically oscillating between quasi anti-war teenage deep thoughts and generic war slogans (""kill with no remorse,"" ""shoot to kill,"" ""time to die,"" etc.) and vocal barks reminiscent of a youthful Tom Araya (Slayer) or Paul Baloff (Exodus). In a recent thrash-revival feature in Decibel mag Warbringer frontman John Kevill declared that they don't write about politics and even purposefully use incorrect grammar to make things sound more ""deranged."" That's fairly appropriate from a sound steeped in mushroom clouds and inverted-crosses-- not always as a political or anti-religous statement, but a fashion accouterment. As we slide into-- or, as some would say are already deeply in-- a recession, it's interesting to note that the blue-collar ethos of thrash metal (originally birthed in the cold war of Reagan's frightening version of GWB's fear politics) is back, loud and proud, and almost totally pretension free. (Goodbye metalcore white-belt whine-scream?) It's a welcome retreat, even if it comes at the price of some envelope-pushing.","L.A.'s Warbringer-- whose members allegedly range in age from 17 to 22-- are, along with Municipal Waste, Fueled by Fire, Toxic Holocaust, and Meltdown, helping to lead an exciting new school of thrash metal bands.

Robotique Majestique,Ghostland Observatory,by: Eric Harvey,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b4f9b1335d7bf169a827/1:1/w_160/f98cc1dc.jpg,2008-03-05 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11243-robotique-majestique/,Trashy Moped,"A few months ago, an mp3 circulated of David Lee Roth's isolated vocal track from the original version of ""Runnin' With the Devil"". For some it was a fascinating glimpse at Diamond Dave's hyper-stylized faux-blues wail, stripped bare of the Van Halen brothers' virtuosity. For most, it was pure comedy gold-- long gaps of silence pierced by a cartoonish falsetto croak-- that quickly gave way to the realization that, wow, as great a song as that is, David Lee Roth is, technically, a pretty shitty singer. The moral: A voice alone, especially one that doesn't add up to much more than a well-intentioned set of signifiers, does not a great band make. Freddie Mercury had some killer pipes, but he also had Brian May and the uncanny ability to craft wonderful pop melodies. Aaron Behrens, the vocalist for Austin's Next Big Thing Ghostland Observatory, is the latest in a long line of supplicants to the Queen leader's throne. Ghostland's schtick doesn't go much further than Behren's pipes and prance, on which the duo relies to fill in the significant gaps of Thomas Ross Turner's spare electronics. Sure, Behrens' voice is a fairly good bar-band approximation of hair metal timbral wankery, yet Turner's sketchy electro backdrops provide only the most rudimentary assistance. The album's title-- a semantic nod to a certain pair of majestic French robots-- is pure wishful thinking. Robotique Majestique, which opens with the instrumental ""Opening Credits"" and includes meandering instrumentals for nearly a third of its 39 minutes, could have worked well as the score of a 1981 techno-horror shlock-fest. ""Dancin' on My Grave""-- passable synth pop that circles around a solid hook without ever landing-- would have run under the closing credits, but here, it's the only even slightly recommendable moment, the highlight of one song after another that finds ways to excise the energy and excitement from dance music. ""Heavy Heart"", the title track, and the Downward Spiral pastiche ""HFM"" rely on Behrens' empty vocal histrionics to carry the songs, but they don't gloss as much more than extended glam-vamps. Like hearing DLR's lonely voice doing its best in the absence of accompaniment, most of Robotique is just sort of depressing. Pop trends and genre hybrids don't just fall out of the sky; despite all signs pointing toward unlimited choice and fan freedom during industry restructuring and p2p smash-and-grab, repertoires are still being created to fill market gaps. In those terms, Ghostland Observatory are even more depressing: They're a duo, one of whom wears a cape while the other patrols the stage howling atop generic electronic noodling-- not dissimilar from recent Columbia signees and Of Montreal tour openers MGMT. In addition, the first time I heard of Ghostland Observatory was from a DVD sent to me of their December '07 ""Austin City Limits"" gig, coming on the strength of two completely-ignored self-released records on a self-created label (it doesn't hurt that they're from Austin, but c'mon). And: They've already played Lollapalooza twice and appeared on freakin' Conan. I'll guess they'll sell 150k of Robotique and stick around to haunt us with their Daft Punk-for-frat-boys schtick for years to come. Boo.","Daft Punk for frat boys.

Quaristice,Autechre,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b4fbb1335d7bf169a82b/1:1/w_160/c03a2734.jpg,2008-03-05 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11245-quaristice/,Warp,"There was a time in the late 1990s when Autechre embodied one way of thinking about music's future. Producers exploring the infinite possibilities of increasingly complex software were creating new sounds on an almost weekly basis. Autechre were recognized as the leading edge of this clan. Their music, while not always alien in terms of texture-- they've often favored timbres that reference electro and early techno in one way or another-- was difficult to get a handle on; the beats were hard to follow; the spaces in which the music breathed impossible to define. Music this strange was only possibly through accelerating technology, and you got the idea that Autechre's music would continue to accelerate in parallel. They were pioneers. One of the ironies of Autechre a decade on is that they still more or less occupy the same position, while trends in experimental music have drifted elsewhere. While some laptop producers began to think about songs again-- working with vocalists, putting their own spin on krautrock, or seeing how shoegaze might sound coming through a computer-- a younger generation came at abstraction in an analog frame of mind. They began with crude electronics, incorporated tribal metaphors, and forewent the beautiful pure math of the circuit board for the messy concerns of the body; instead of shaved heads, they sported wild hair and beards and maybe a bit of face paint. I thought of these contrasts with regard to Quaristice, Autechre's first new album in three years, when listening to ""The Plc"", the album's second track, which follows the ghostly synth-drone opener ""Altibzz"". ""The Plc""'s reference point is electro-- the stiff and mannered snare drum, seemingly fashioned from tin, marks every measure robotically. But swirling around the steady-state beat are a number of odd sounds that lend a decidedly psychedelic cast. In purely sonic terms, it's not all that far from something like Excepter in their more beat-oriented mode, but Autechre's way of getting there couldn't be more different, and process is in part what defines them. Autechre's research-and-development-style approach to music making is one of the things they're known for, but Quaristice is said to be special in that regard. Instead of focusing on the micro, painstakingly stitching together each track second-by-second, this album grew out of jamming, with Sean Booth and Rob Brown reconfiguring and ""versioning"" elements of their by all accounts formidable live show into new tunes. It's hard to tell exactly how that plays out, but one thing about this record is very different from anything else Autechre has done this decade: The tracks are short (most around three or four minutes) and there are lots of them (20). While it's tempting to think of this collection of sonic miniatures as a set of ""singles,"" Quaristice winds up working in almost the opposite way. Since the bulk of these pieces each explores one focused idea without a lot of variation, they don't make a whole lot of sense when removed from the album. Autechre have always made music of changes, where part of the interest was in hearing the gears of the music slipping as rhythms fell in and our of sync with each other and wound up somewhere different from where they began; development within most of the tracks on Quaristice is smaller and less noticeable, and many are over before you know it. So it might be more useful to think of the short tracks as sort of miniature movements within the album's suite-like whole. Which is another way of saying that I've most enjoyed this record when I've had the time and focus to allow me to listen to the entire thing straight through. It's then I can follow the arc of the record as it moves from the billowy opening of ""Altibzz"" past the menacing, high-speed future-shock fuckery of ""IO"", to the nervous ghost-in-the-machine drone of ""SonDEremawe"", on through the positively AFX-ian ""Simmm""-- with its wired gamelan percussion hits and too-bright melody that makes you think of an artificial sun-- stopping along the way for the towering beat and acid riff of ""Rale"", the disorienting implosion of ""Fol3"", and the double-speed Detroit assembly line of ""bnc Castl"". As they move from ambient washes to classic-sounding IDM to their usual variations on techno and electro, I'm hearing more overt referencing of sounds of the past on Quaristice, like Autechre are more readily glancing and poking at genre, perhaps in an attempt to escape the oppression of so much focus on detail. So Quaristice also feels a bit like a survey, an esoteric and abstracted summary of electronic music's past that also glances toward what might come. After the hyper techno of ""chenc9"", the album folds back in on itself in the final two tracks, allowing space for contemplation of where the music has been. ""Notwo"" is so moody it almost sounds like Angelo Badalamenti; with its a dubby underwater drone and clipped upper range, it wouldn't sound out of place on Amber. And then lengthy ""Outh9X"" finishes the album on a more neutral note, as a steady electronic pulse is stalked by bassy tones that eventually trail off into mist in an extended ambient coda. It's been some time since we've heard Autechre sounding as purely beautiful as the opening and two closing tracks on Quaristice, but these moments aren't indicative of the record as a whole. Even while *Quaristice * is in some ways the most listenable album they've created in a decade, it's ultimately no easier to parse, and can be very rough going indeed if you're not in the mood for their peculiar world. Ultimately, this is still the same Autechre, remaining apart from trends as the rest of electronic music world goes on its way, their steadfast commitment to their vision being both their greatest strength and most confounding obstacle.","Instead of focusing on the micro, painstakingly stitching together each track second-by-second, Autechre's latest album grew out of jamming, with Sean Booth and Rob Brown reconfiguring and ""versioning"" elements of their formidable live show into new tunes.

Matinée,Jack Peñate,by: Tom Ewing,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b4ba5e6ef9596932265a/1:1/w_160/1e35bd59.jpg,2008-03-04 06:00:05,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11190-matinee/,XL,"When you listen to singer-songwriter Jack Peñate you feel you're listening to an honest fellow with bags of integrity: just as well, as otherwise you might suspect the dark arts of the focus group at work. He has some of Pete Doherty's visionary busker schtick, some of the cosy chattiness of Kate Nash, and some of the brisk optimism of goofy UK chart darlings Scouting For Girls. It's no surprise that he's done rather well in Britain. This debut album opens with ""Spit At Stars"", all his signature elements on show: the chunky, quick-strummed acoustic guitar, the undeniably sticky hooks, and most of all the breathless vocals and philosophical lyrics. Peñate's thoughtful bent is what sets his approach apart from his pop friendslist: he sings like he's just read the secrets of the universe in his fish and chip wrapper and is bursting to pass them on. So what are they? Here's where the trouble starts. ""Made Of Codes"" and ""Learning Lines"" tell us that society's structures come pre-scripted: ""Deciphering is the game we're all in."" On ""We Will Be Here"" he takes a still wider view: ""So small, oh so small are we/ By 'we' I mean all humanity."" What's the solution? Well, like he says on ""Spit At Stars"", ""we all got our dreams,"" and it turns out our smallness is what makes us human: ""The stars can't feel a lover's touch."" Matinée is full of these little aphorisms, and Peñate's heartfelt presence means that your impression of the album is going to be quite closely related to whether you think they're full of shit or not. One of Peñate's problems is that his gift for showing gets overtaken by his penchant for telling. ""Got My Favourite"" runs through some of his most treasured clothes, noting who gave him each of them. The point is clear and sweet-- our lives are a collection of connections-- but he has to ram it home with a chorus that clumsily explains exactly what he's saying. His quirky observations are always crushed by explanations, and only on his ballads does he stop cramming in thirty words per line. Listening to Matinée straight through is exhausting, like being trapped in the kitchen at a college party while someone with curiously wide eyes Explains It All to you. Mind you, those wide-eyed guys tended to have pretty intriguing love lives: Matinée is at its best when Peñate turns his eyes from the cosmos and attends to matters of the heart. ""My Yvonne"" keeps it simple and gentle, a hushed infatuation ballad which gives Peñate's melodic touch much needed space. The best of his upbeat tracks, meanwhile, is ""Have I Been A Fool?"", where he's the one doing the unrequiting and worrying he's leading a girl on. The song isn't much more than a pretty piano figure and a sense of rhythm but it suits Peñate's intimate style. The most interesting track, though, is ""Run For Your Life"", partly because it appears to be starting a beef with Dizzee Rascal. ""Don't fix up or look sharp"", he says, while calling out bullies everywhere with the passion of the sometime victim. It's brave, and not disagreeable, and it nails Peñate's appeal: everything on Matinée suggests he's a decent guy. But just as you're warming to him he comes out with another one-liner like ""no one owns what nature's grown,"" and you're forced to remember that good men can also make bad records.","London singer-songwriter known for high-energy shows debuts with an uneven album marked by undeniably sticky hooks and often clumsy lyrics.

Liquidate Paris!,Blood Meridian,by: Evan McGarvey,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b4bc9d034d5c69bf4ef7/1:1/w_160/6320c7dd.jpg,2008-03-04 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11192-liquidate-paris/,Elevation,"Picking out the constituent peaks in the playfully grizzled Black Mountain rock collective is a sober task. Mapped out, the members of Black Mountain, Pink Mountaintops, Blood Meridian, and Lightning Dust resemble a topographic chain with shifting features-- a drummer moves here, a bassist plays for this band, sometimes, and so forth. For Blood Meridian, the hashchild of Black Mountain bassist Matthew Camirand, the mission is clear: Create rust-belt ballads that sound like the bawdy, direct, rye-drenched barroom underneath Black Mountain's splashy art studio. Liquidate Paris!, a limited-edition, nine-song CD and vinyl release from Michigan's Elevation Recordings, is the latest Blood Meridian record, and the follow-up to 2006's Kick Up the Dust. Liquidate Paris! has all the elements of Blood Meridian's sound: dusty vocals, guitar lines like steel twine, trotting, patient drums, and occasional moments of tremolo guitar. As durable and effective as their sonics are, there's a bewildering set of mixed messages on Liquidate Paris!. The title, taken from Danish author's Sven Hassel pulp WWII novels, proclaims a set of intentions: brutal, visceral, and portentous. Even better, it's an album title fitting for their band's name-- that in itself an explicit nod to contemporary lit-don Cormac McCarthy's agnostic, blood-fed opus. The products, however, barely resemble the intentions laid out in the title. The nine ballads here are lyrically derivative-- ""We were drunk as fuck/ We were down on our luck""-- and more plaintive and petty than any of songs in their catalog. Where Camirand was at least giddily petulant on Kick Up the Dust, here the lyrics are ham-fisted in their solipsism (""Some people say I'm out of my head/ But they don't see what I see"") and maudlin in their stabs at romance (""Turning slowing to the beating of your chest/ Ocean breezes sticking to your skin/ The world goes on without you, while you remember everything she said""). Trailblazing lyrical insight isn't Blood Meridian's forte, but there's no getting around how detrimental the songwriting is to the overall craft. There are stirring musical moments here-- the glistening piano on ""Walk Through the Door"" for instance-- but they are nullified by lyrical passivity. Blood Meridian aren't designed for dramatic peaks and vistas-- they deal in nostalgic compositions and have influences (Leonard Cohen's moods, Neil Young's settings, the Replacements' adolescent disappointment) inseparable from their form-- but even the modest hills in a range deserve resonant words.","The hashchild of Black Mountain bassist Matthew Camirand, Blood Meridian sound like they're performing in the bawdy, direct, rye-drenched barroom underneath Black Mountain's splashy art studio.

Nothing Is Underrated,Joe Lally,by: Tom Breihan,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b4ce13d197565213ab7d/1:1/w_160/e0a10fd9.jpg,2008-03-04 06:00:03,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11207-nothing-is-underrated/,Dischord,"It's tough to imagine Fugazi without Joe Lally. His bass is the first thing we hear on ""Waiting Room"", and since then his supple, spacey, propulsive basslines have anchored too many jams to count. Fugazi's ideological ferocity and hometown boosterism always got the press, but they also had one of the most capable and economical rhythm sections working; Lally and drummer Brendan Canty's beats could imply funk or reggae without ever drifting from their post-punk rigor, and they had a way of maintaining absolute stillness while Ian MacKaye and Guy Picciotto thrashed off into the void. From Fugazi's 1987 inception until they went on hiatus sometime after The Argument, Lally remained among the most dependable foot soldiers in punk rock, a born sideman who made everyone around him sound stronger and more focused. But it's equally hard to imagine Joe Lally without Fugazi. At his old band's shows, Lally would lurk off to the side of the stage, bobbing his bald head in monastic concentration while MacKaye barked and Picciotto wriggled. Every so often, he'd move toward centerstage to deliver a whispery lead vocal, but then he'd just recede back into the shadows just as quickly. He never exactly came off as someone eager to be noticed. And yet here we have a Fugazi-less Lally. Nothing Is Underrated is Lally's second solo album following 2006's There to Here, and the ghosts of Fugazi are still all over this thing. MacKaye and Picciotto both make cameos, as do various other D.C. scene-vets. And Lally's basslines here are basically Fugazi basslines without Fugazi songs attached. As basslines, they're great: sparse and ringing and indelible. But they scream out for more than the unfinished song-sketches Lally grants them here. The main problem here, if it's a problem at all, is that Nothing Is Underrated never sounds anything less than pleasant, which means it always sounds polite. Besides the basslines, Lally's low-key mutter of a voice is the focal point. Everything else comes in minimal flourishes: muted brush-drums, warm swells of feedback, something that sounds like a jewsharp being run through an effects pedal. Lally's lyrics usually take the form of vague, aphoristic musings, doodles and half-ideas that don't bear much scrutiny (""No destiny/ As seen on TV,"" that sort of thing). As background music, it's not unpleasant; there's a soft, soothing tone in Lally's voice, and he never throws any leftfield noises at us. When he ran the indie Tolotta, Lally released records from D.C. psych- and doom-metal bands Dead Meadow and Spirit Caravan, and that influence shows up from time to time in the form of freaked-out acid-rock organ, but that stuff stays firmly in check, never giving the songs the electric charge they might need. Even ""Motora"", which is mostly just Lally reciting pseudo-beat poetry over guitar feedback, somehow manages to sound polite and unobtrusive, which is surely some kind of accomplishment. As nice as all this sounds, though, the sense of near-messianic purpose that drove Fugazi is missed. But near the album's end, Lally at least moves towards it on two songs. ""Mistaken Identity"" rests on nothing but bass and reverb, but Lally's lyrics make for a really simple, powerful, and direct statement of negation: ""I am not a list of desires/ I am not the hopes of others/ I am not a warehouse of memory."" And ""Painfully Aware"" has some seriously funky Curtis Mayfield cymbals to go with its monster bassline; it's a simple stylistic flourish that pushes the track that much further toward Fugazi territory. Most of the time, though, Nothing Is Underrated is an easy record to like but a hard one to love.","One of the most dependable foot soldiers in punk rock, Fugazi's Joe Lally and his supple, spacey, propulsive basslines are back on his second solo album.

Afterparty Babies,Cadence Weapon,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b4f8b1335d7bf169a824/1:1/w_160/a4b8dcf1.jpg,2008-03-04 06:00:02,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11242-afterparty-babies/,EpitaphAnti-,"On Cadence Weapon's pair of 2005 releases, the mixtape Cadence Weapon Is the Black Hand and the album Breaking Kayfabe, it was thrilling to watch (former Pitchfork writer) Rollie Pemberton assemble his hip-hop bricolage in plain view. The sparse Canadian rap canon afforded him plenty of room to maneuver, and he used it to execute acrobatic feats of self-invention. As the son of Teddy Pemberton, the radio DJ for the seminal Canadian hip-hop program ""The Black Experience in Sound"", the junior Pemberton must have been acutely aware of his tacit responsibility not just to make hip-hop, but to create a strain of it from the ground up. Aggressive mechanical drum patterns, gnarly electro synths, oddball samples, rubbery vocal cadences, pop-cultural punch lines, honor-roll puns: All of these comprised the broad strokes of Pemberton's musical identity, and now, on Afterparty Babies, they feel like the fixed elements of a mature style. But at the time, hedged in by leftfield excursions, they felt tenuous, as if Pemberton were testing a variety of directions before choosing one. Skewed instrumentals like ""Those Sliders"", hallucinatory mash-ups like ""The Anthem (Cadence Weapon National Remix)"", and bizarre Reichian beats like the one on ""Fathom"" made Pemberton's style sound marvelously curious and questing. If the satisfying Afterparty Babies doesn't have the same thunderclap impact of its predecessors, it's because that element of adventure is subdued. This record has a clearer idea of what it wants to be, with seams neatly tucked away under a monolithic style. Pemberton's knack for massaging startling sounds into hyperkinetic dance tracks flares up periodically: ""Do I Miss My Friends?"" is built upon a Hanson-baiting a capella ""mmm-bop."" More often, he sticks to a reliable blend of techno and vintage electro. But if Afterparty Babies solidifies the musical nature of the Cadence Weapon project, Pemberton's identity seems as fluid and unresolved as ever Pemberton himself is not quite a hipster rapper, although he does have lots to say about Friendster, emoticons, and Heiro-logo tattoos. He's not quite a nerd rapper, although he does drizzle juicy 8-bit blips and molten, neon synths over ""Limited Edition of OJ Slammer"" while rapping about Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes. He's not quite an undie messiah, although he takes a few potshots at what he perceives as a vacuous mainstream, especially on the stabby neo-disco track ""Real Estate"", where ""rappers on the radio don't talk about shit"" and choruses are fast-food jingles. He's not quite an old-skool preservationist, although Afterparty Babies is awash in scratching and sturdily linear sample beds, and he's not quite a party-and-bullshit MC, although he's fond of house beats and clubland send-ups like ""Unsuccessful Club Nights"". Instead, Cadence Weapon is a panoramic, everything-but-the-gangster portrait of modern hip-hop offshoots. ""The New Face of Fashion"", a nasty electro banger with funk accents, is a screed against trendy couture. On the album's back cover, Pemberton appears in a red hoodie and a peppermint-striped tee with abstract lightning bolt patterns. ""Limited Edition OJ Slammer"", a diatribe against celebrity-obsession that finds Pemberton ""wiping the fame off [his] mouth,"" seems rather ironic on a record characterized by lyrics like ""Say you spray the nina when you're fey like Tina"" (on ""Your Hair's Not Clothes!"", amid fluttering bat-wing synths and deep tone umlauts). At their core, most of the songs here are critiques of the same fast, slick youth culture in which Pemberton is an avid participant, and this paradox is what gives Afterparty Babies its self-contradicting aura. The cover sums it up: In a yearbook-style photo, Pemberton sits on a stool in front of a gallery of standard-issue indie-hipsters (and one Kid Rock clone), included yet apart. This sort of self-contradiction is really just honesty. Internally consistent points of view are rare, and Pemberton makes no attempt to construct a false one. A thin seam of personal archaeology lends another layer of biographical complexity to the statements and contexts that negate each other. ""Do I Miss My Friends?"" is dedicated to ""all the accidents out there;"" the afterparty babies for which the record is titled. A skit at the end of ""In Search of the Youth Crew"" finds a relative reminiscing about young Rollie's desires to play with dolls. When Pemberton says, ""Allegory I label a true story,"" he's talking about girls again. But he's also talking about Afterparty Babies, which finds him attempting to reconcile his beliefs, lifestyle, and origins, yet finding no place where they neatly align.","Aggressive mechanical drum patterns, gnarly electro synths, oddball samples, rubbery vocal cadences, pop-cultural punch lines, honor-roll puns: All of these comprise the broad strokes of Rollie Pemberton's musical identity, and now, on Afterparty Babies, they feel like the fixed elements of a mature style.

Saturnalia,The Gutter Twins,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b4ef5e6ef959693226bb/1:1/w_160/4ae9aba6.jpg,2008-03-04 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11235-saturnalia/,Sub Pop,"While so many other 1990s alt-rock acts are rehashing their hits on nostalgia package tours, Greg Dulli and Mark Lanegan have pushed ahead musically without having to rely heavily on past triumphs. Dulli continues his surprisingly tenacious Twilight Singers project, and Lanegan has released six fairly well-received solo albums, although he's better known for collaborating with Isobel Campbell and Queens of the Stone Age. Dulli and Lanegan have spent most of the 2000s collaborating flirtatiously, touring and recording together-- check out Lanegan's vocals on the Twilight Singers' cover of ""Flashback"" by Fat Freddy's Drop, from their 2006 EP A Stitch in Time-- but Saturnalia is their long-in-the-works debut as the Gutter Twins, a partnership that Dulli describes as ""the Satanic Everly Brothers."" The ""Satanic Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid"" might be a little more apt: The album finds them bursting forth from their studio, guns blazing but no clean getaway in sight. Musically, Saturnalia, named after the Roman festival where slaves and masters switch roles, is a concentrated dose of their usual badassery, never straying too far from the territory Dulli explored on the last three Singers albums, and even includes many of the same collaborators: wayward troubadour Joseph Arthur, Mathias Schneeberger, Dave Rosser, Martina Topley-Bird, Queen of the Stone Age Troy Van Leeuwen, and New Orleans organist Quintron (who illuminates ""Seven Stories Underground""). The project's sense of familiarity, however, is not a negative. ""Each to Each"" revisits the eerie electronica of the Twilight Singers' debut, a welcome compliment to Dulli's vocals courtesy of guitarist Jeff Klein and synth player Natasha Schneider. With its odd chorale intro and a string arrangement that shifts chords tectonically, ""Idle Hands"" builds to a chorus that could scale a skyscraper. Scavenging the gutter, though, Dulli and Lanegan come across some new flourishes. Discordant strings add tension to opener ""The Stations"", which marches along at a midtempo before Schneeberger's churchly organ raises it aloft. Before the Twins can build to the expected finale, the song simply fades out, redemption thwarted. ""God's Children"" settles into a Whigsy blaxpoitation mood before drummer Greg Wieczorek hammers out a soaring chorus. ""Who Will Lead Us?"" is part folk and part gospel, so subdued that the tension never releases but bubbles into ""Seven Stories Underground"". With a billion cigarettes between them, the Twins are well matched vocally: Lanegan sings like he's rising from the dead, Dulli like he's falling from grace. Together, they can make a line like ""We're gonna have some fun"" sound utterly sinister, which lends these lecherously slow burners their peculiar gravity. Lanegan sings ""All Misery / Flowers"" like a Tom Waits song, his vocal delivery tripping against the song's rhythms as he conjures junkie afflictions: ""Little girls might twitch at the way I itch, but the way I burn, it's a son of a bitch."" Dulli closes the album with ""Front Street"", which begins, somewhat morbidly, with the chirping of birds. It's no joke, but a chiaroscuro contrast with the song's pitch subject. ""People to use, lovers to break, handful of pills, no life to take,"" he sings, flirting with the masochist lover/confidence man he perfected 15 years ago on Gentlemen and seemed to abandon with the Twilight Singers. It's no coincidence that Sub Pop is releasing Saturnalia: The label was home to both the Whigs and the Trees, as well as to Lanegan the solo artist. These songs plumb their persistent themes of sin and redemption, damnation and salvation, but in a way that sounds like they're taking stock of their own long and undeniably tough careers, in which disappointment, death, and drug addiction are public record. As such, the album possesses a gruesome attraction for fans of both musicians, who will hear it as a bloodletting, as well as for newcomers, who may hear it as a violent shoot-out-- Dulli and Lanegan against the world, their fates undecided. The Twins push each other to go darker and deeper, to bare more of their souls, so Saturnalia sounds heavier, bleaker, simultaneously more desperate and more content than anything either musician has done in years. As they both sing on ""All Misery / Flowers, ""I did all I did just to get through to heaven."" Dulli and Lanegan haven't reached the Pearly Gates yet, but that's our good fortune.","Unlike many of their 1990s alt-rock contemporaries, Greg Dulli and Mark Lanegan continue to push ahead musically without having to rely heavily on past triumphs-- a winning streak that continues with their long-in-the-works debut as the Gutter Twins.

Another Sound Is Dying,Dub Trio,by: Cosmo Lee,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b4b85e6ef95969322654/1:1/w_160/3f4352c6.jpg,2008-03-03 06:00:05,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11188-another-sound-is-dying/,Ipecac,"The conceit of this record-- mixing aggressive rock with dub reggae-- isn't new. Bad Brains were the first notable practitioners, inserting clean-toned dub between bouts of hardcore punk. Blind Idiot God were like if Bad Brains were white, instrumental, and played avant-garde metal. Fugazi's rhythm section had heavy dub influences. For the most part, though, these bands kept rock and dub separate. The innovation of Brooklyn's Dub Trio is mixing them within songs-- or more precisely, smashing them together. Dub Trio arose out of Actual Proof, a drum'n'bass-inspired band of Berklee College of Music alumni. The members are in-demand session musicians, with credits including 50 Cent, Mos Def, the Fugees, and Common. Two studio albums on ROIR (which issued Bad Brains' legendary debut) led to a collaboration with professional collaborator Mike Patton, whose Ipecac imprint released this record. Dub is about emptying space, while rock, to an extent, is about filling it up. Midrange is the contested territory, and Dub Trio negotiate it awkwardly. Most songs here abruptly toggle between rock and dub. ""Agonist"" begins as one-drop reggae with plaintive organ mutterings. However, it suddenly becomes fast, mid-1990s punk; one expects Bad Religion's Greg Graffin to start singing. Just as suddenly, it returns to dub. Three minutes later, punk drops in again, apropos of nothing. In ""Regression Line"", the band brilliantly recreates J Dilla's laidback kick-snare patterns, but the hip-hop feels airdropped into its Jesus Lizard-esque surroundings. ""Safe and Sane"" starts with an angry Pearl Jam riff, but cools down before settling into dub. Thankfully, the rock doesn't return-- so what was the point of it? Pouring distortion into the midrange (rock) and then yanking it away (dub) can be fruitful, though. It creates tension, which Dub Trio sometimes finesse, between foreground and background. ""The Midnight Rider"" layers rock and dub in an uneasy simmer. Such coexistence creates cross-rhythms between guitars and dub echoes, which would otherwise merely dissipate. ""Jog On"" keeps its guitars at a muted roar, so that when it goes dub, the shift feels organic. ""Felicitacion"" feints rock, goes dub, then blossoms into beautifully gauzy, Mono-esque textures. Dub may be about space, but it's often merely cavernous; here, the song goes widescreen. However, it cruelly and suddenly dials the reverb back to zero, returning to cast-off Helmet riffs. Dub Trio are a formidable dub unit. But as a rock band, they're only passable. This is not for lack of chops; in fact, they're almost too good.

At War With Walls & Mazes,Son Lux,by: Evan McGarvey,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b4ad9d034d5c69bf4edf/1:1/w_160/45b31ceb.jpg,2008-03-03 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11178-at-war-with-walls-mazes/,Anticon,"Son Lux's debut, At War With Walls & Mazes, resembles the classical concerto. Electronic composer and Son Lux leader Ryan Lott is the soloist, with gentle, sparse vocals, against a backdrop of classical instruments. Occasionally a single organic sound rises behind Lott's utterances, like the bass guitar peeling away from the timberline drum creaks and overlapping whispers on ""Raise"". These are rarities; for the lion's share of the album's 45 minutes the mood is severe. Son Lux perches over a digital wilderness-- a wilderness of recreated crowd noise, cracked samples, and mutated loops. Laid out as a narrative (beginning with ""Prologue"" and tidying up with ""Epilogue""), with sharp, direct titles (""Wither"", ""Stand"", ""War""), Walls & Mazes has a coarseness, a fatalism, between Lott and the landscapes he creates. It's a heaviness of heart relieved only when those interceding instruments (cello on ""Stay"", the supple, measured piano on ""Break"") twine with the vocals against the molded chaos. But there are lights in the darkness and a holy ghost in the Son Lux machine. At War With Walls & Mazes is an album infused with a religiosity that's at times humble and unnamed and at times romantic. ""Where have all the holy gone?/ Is there no one to condemn you?/ Where have all the wicked gone?/ Is there no one left to beat you down?"", he asks on ""Break"". The imagery is clear, the sentiment classic, and the delivery hushed and awed. It's the sonic background that's so affecting. That twist in the combination produces odd troikas of comparison: the lyrical concerns of Sufjan Stevens circa Seven Swans, production techniques from Massive Attack, and the classical habits of Nico Muhly. And even when Lott is playing for us here on Earth, the album's concerns are stained. ""Will you love me/ Like he loves me?"" Son Lux mews on the clinging, almost uncomfortably sensuous ""Stay"". That ""He"" should probably be capitalized. Later, on ""Betray"": ""You will betray me baby/ And I will be true."" (Sucks to be ""You""). Lott is a performance artist at heart-- he's had his multimedia projects featured in the Guggenheim and produces as much music for choreography as he does for just listeners. As an album, Walls & Mazes may have moments of gauzy, near-inert tinkering-- ""Stand"" and ""Tell""-- and it's no doubt an emotionally draining listen, but as a project, as an aesthetic, there's a resonant, engaging conflict. A good friend of mine once said there were only three proper subjects for rock songs: God, Girls, and Growing Up. Ryan Lott proves with Walls & Mazes that he's got the first one down. How orthodox will the next ones sound?","Intriguing debut by composer Ryan Lott is an unusual blend of approaches, especially for a release on Anticon: the lyrical concerns of Sufjan Stevens circa Seven Swans, sonic techniques from Massive Attack, and the classical habits of Nico Muhly.

Belly,Food for Animals,by: Aaron Leitko,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b47813d197565213aaf7/1:1/w_160/984775ce.jpg,2008-03-03 06:00:03,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11134-belly/,HOSS,"Food for Animals come at hip-hop from an oblique angle. Or, to put it less gently, they do it ass-backwards, inverting the traditional roles of beats and rhymes. MCs Vulture Voltaire (aka Andrew Field-Pickering) and Hy (aka Sterling Warren) hold down the rhythmic pulse with their flows, while the beats-- well, the beats just fly all over the fucking place. Producer Ricky Rabbit's loops sound like a Stan Brakhage Nintendo game-- P.A.-pulverizing fits of chopped and screwed digital squalor that mash up lo-bit Pita-style electronics with breakcore, Baltimore club, dubstep, and techno. But the topsy-turvy ethos and gurgling electronics hardly make Belly-- the group's first full-length-- a headache-inducing mess. Rather, Belly is a giant step forward for the trio in just about every regard. The hooks are stronger, the verses are tighter, the noise is, well, better. In 2004 Food for Animals were loud and messy. Rickey Rabbit used to perform live by routing his iTunes into a smorgasbord of pedals while Vulture rapped through a delay and a now absent guitarist plucked out circuit-bent Atari sounds. They produced a formidable speaker-cone-busting racket, which-- more often than not-- soundsystems weren't quite up to. Likewise the Scavengers EP-- the group's overlooked first release-- was structurally loose and sonically raw. Ricky Rabbit regularly made use of frequencies so severe that it often felt like your hearing was shutting on and off in time to the music. On Belly, Food for Animals haven't gone smooth-- the record is still loud enough to shorten the lifespan of your high-range hearing-- but they have tightened up. ""Shhhy""'s shattered synth-loop bursts from of a cloud of murmurs and chopped piano samples, with Vulture's rapping anchored by coarse bass thuds. But the tight chorus-- with its layered vocal samples and psyched-out chipmunk octave chant-- is where ""Shhhy"" will make you lose it like a 14-year-old at a Rage Against the Machine show. ""Yeah my generation got clowned and still my surroundings can't even make a sound,"" raps Vulture. ""You look at me nervous with your finger on your mouth-- but you don't have to be so shy."" Vulture's lyrics have also come up a notch since Scavengers. Where old songs might have found the imposing 6-foot-plus beardo rapping about ""elephants humpin' in your trunk,"" on Belly he delivers tighter and deeper rhymes about everything from hot days spent with Arthur Russell records to his mother's untimely death. ""Every time I hear the word cancer I need a cigarette/ I'm not sure I get it yet,"" he raps in a poignant moment on the unexpectedly heavy album closer ""Grapes"". The arrival of Hy also adds a little more flavor to the proceedings by giving the songs the fuel of another personality. But it's producer Ricky Rabbit who really pushes Belly's game forward. Despite Vulture and Hy's ample charisma, without the upside-down rhythm, skull scraping buzzes, and stereo-bong samples, Belly might struggle to stand out at a Takoma Park open-mic night. Instrumentals like the gentle and trippy synth-blips of ""Grapes (Preprise)"" or ""Virgogo""-- a slanted pass at Baltimore Club-- show off his talent for taking the navel-gazing sounds of digital minimalism and making them bounce. Belly may be a weird and noisy hip-hop album, but it's still a hip-hop album, and by that measure it's more 3 Feet High and Rising than Death Certificate. Food for Animals bring the noise, but they don't want to bludgeon you with it. On Belly, they drop some incomprehensible beats, make sounds that recall a box of light bulbs rolling down a flight of stairs, and put down some pretty heavy lyrics-- the name is after all a reference to the belly of the beast, to being pulverized and digested-- but it's not a some head-grinding avant-deathtrip. ""I get nice and fuzzy with my buddies cause they funny and I love y'all/ We chuckling and coughing and laugh for no reason while we talkin',"" raps Vulture on ""Swampy (Summer Jam)"", a song that's as much about healing as it is about murky underpants. Belly may be all about getting turned upside down and inside out, but when it's over, all that tumult will leave you feeling pretty good.","Full-length debut by Baltimore area group comes at hip-hop from an oblique angle, with the rapping holding down the rhythmic pulse while producer Ricky Rabbit's noisy and diverse beats fly all over the place.

I Need You to Hold on While the Sky Is Falling,Kelley Polar,by: Mark Pytlik,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b4ee9d034d5c69bf4f3e/1:1/w_160/8128c505.gif,2008-03-03 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11234-i-need-you-to-hold-on-while-the-sky-is-falling/,Environ,"""At the top of the mountain, there is a special sensation at the centre of your body, and you can feel the earth moving underneath your feet. In the deepest part of the ocean, there is a cool and special place that is good for thinking. It happens to all of us at the same time. A feeling of the All-Thing."" If you were to come across that blurb on a back cover during a random bookstore browse, you'd hot potato it to the back of the display table. But that's exactly what emanates in faintly recognizable vocodered waves, line by line and time-delayed, from the flowery but strangely alluring intro to Kelley Polar's flowery but strangely alluring second full-length, I Need You to Hold on While the Sky Is Falling. Like a grisly opening scene in a slasher flick, that extravagantly over-the-top curtain raiser sets the parameters for what's to come next. An unashamedly earnest record full of with waterlogged synths, classics references (Greek, not Kraftwerk), and above all else a sense of theatre, I Need You is an album which, for its many conceivable annoyances, genuinely doesn't sound like anything else before it. Sonically, there is a lot to like. A talkative mixture of fizzy electronic timbres, soft disco strings, tumbling harmonies, and smart rhythms, the music isn't really that far removed from the fulsome and verdant template that Polar, a Juilliard-trained violinist, established with 2005's minor breakthrough Love Songs From the Hanging Gardens. But where that debut found the then-unknown musician in mostly timid voice, I Need You depicts him, one album under his belt, as a bolshier and far more assertive presence. The change is most plainly evident in his singing, where the unassuming, rounded off sweetness of his former vocal style has been replaced by a breathless, compulsively enunciative delivery. At times, as on ""Zeno of Elea"" and ""A Dream in Three Parts"", he sounds almost possessed by his own wonderment; the effect is so pronounced that at first, you suspect he's play-acting as much as he is singing. And then you realize: Actually, it feels more like he's play-imagining. From the frequent references to ancient Greek philosophers and Greek cities to the physics and science-leaning asides to Polar's constant spiritual assertions (in a nutshell: everything in the universe is connected), I Need You feels like a soundtrack for an alternate universe of his own creation. Much like his dialed-up vocal presence, the change in this regard is every bit as dramatic-- Love Songs certainly never wanted for the occasional proggy inflection; this practically demands a footnoted lyric sheet. The highlights come easy and often. The aforementioned album opener ""A Feeling of the All-Thing"" turns that churning spoken-word passage into the skeleton for a celebratory sliver of symphonic electro; ""Roseband"" opens on a set of string trills before blossoming into a brisk, stuttery bit of disco; the throbbing ""A Dream in Three Parts"" rests on a gooey analog synth and Polar's even gooier delivery; and the sumptuous, string-drenched boy-girl duet of ""Entropy Reigns (In the Celestial City)"" is one of the best of the year so far. Never mind that all that hokum isn't actually so hokey, that the ideas that form the backbone of the album's intro sequence-- that mind/body divide-- have functioned as dance music critic catnip for the better part of the last 15 years; by working them into a strain of music that walks the tightrope between that divide, Polar's managed a neat rhetorical track. More than anything else, it's really Polar's willingness to extend himself beyond dance music's often frustrating, low-risk, low-reward tendency towards po-faced seriousness that excites. Regardless of how you square with his overly-besotted singing style, his new age proselytizing, his occasionally agonizing earnestness-- and make no mistake, some people will hate this record-- it's hard to debate the artistic impulses that led him to make it. After all, if the sky really were falling, what more could one person do than set out to make a new one?","Kelley Polar's flowery but strangely alluring second full-length is an unashamedly earnest record full of waterlogged synths, classics references, and a sense of theatre.

Real Emotional Trash,Stephen Malkmus and the Jicks,by: Matt LeMay,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b4ed13d197565213abaa/1:1/w_160/917453ff.jpg,2008-03-03 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11233-real-emotional-trash/,Matador,"The first line of Real Emotional Trash begs to be read autobiographically: ""Of all my stoned digressions/ Some have mutated into the truth/ Not a spoof."" It's the same tease that Malkmus pulled by calling his last album Face the Truth, in spite of its characteristically elusive contents. While that record featured Malkmus fully indulging his penchant for eclectic basement tinkering, Real Emotional Trash is an unabashedly rock'n'roll band album. It's the most aesthetically cohesive album of Malkmus' solo career (which is good), but also the jammiest (which, here, is bad). The record may sound like it would have been a blast to play on, but that doesn't always make for an engrossing listen. On the plus side, Real Emotional Trash is still a Stephen Malkmus album, and it's host to all his pursuant charms and quirks. As a writer, Malkmus remains in top form; the album is rife with character-based songwriting that seems increasingly rare and valuable as songwriters increasingly grapple with overstated signifiers of sincerity. Even the album's title is characteristically apt-but-not-apt; though the material on Real Emotional Trash could hardly be considered straightforwardly ""emotional"" (even in comparison to Malkmus' output at large), there's a very real sense of excitement that comes from its communal sound. The excitement is justified, too; these Jicks (Malkmus included) are stellar musicians. Malkmus shows off his band's strengths right off the bat; ""Dragonfly Pie"" is equal parts swaggering indie and 1970s AOR, coupling simple and memorable melodic phrases with synchronized, fuzzy guitar riffs. There are some moments of extreme understated structural elegance here; as the song's chorus emerges from a tangled verse, Sleater-Kinney/Quasi drummer (and now Jick) Janet Weiss' muscular and precise drumming lends the song a unified sense of purpose that's largely been absent from Malkmus' solo work. Unfortunately, it doesn't last. Many of the songs on Real Emotional Trash start promising, but quickly become frustratingly repetitive and aimless. At times, the album veers satisfyingly into proggy excess or White Stripes-like forceful minimalism, but never commits to either. If anything, it sounds like the work of a band that knows how to play well together, but can't necessarily convey a purpose beyond that. ""Hopscotch Willie"" starts out with a pleasant verse (that actually brings to mind the melody from Sade's ""Smooth Operator""), but by the six-minute mark you're, uh, well aware that you've hit the six-minute mark. The album drags even more with its title track, one of many on Real Emotional Trash that struggles to construct an epic from just a handful of memorable moments. The song’s extended midsection deftly shows off the band’s ability to work in tandem, but it's not a gesture that rewards repeat listens. Thankfully, the album picks up with lead single ""Baltimore"" and the under-three-minute, almost-""Reelin' in the Years""-quoting ""Gardenia"", both of which use the band’s strength to put some extra oomph into already-great songs. Closer ""Wicked Wanda"" is great, too, incorporating enough musical curveballs to keep things interesting. Then again, ""Wicked Wanda"" is a fitting end for a record that is something of a curveball itself. Face the Truth overflowed with incongruous musical ideas, but Real Emotional Trash is determinedly unified, even if it isn't always clear to what ends. At its best, the record hints at opening a whole new musical world for Malkmus-- one in which his well-worn style is effectively played down in the service of a mighty rock'n'roll band. Otherwise, it's simply a satisfying, if underdeveloped, gesture towards something much greater than itself.","The most aesthetically cohesive album of Stephen Malkmus' career, Real Emotional Trash is also his jammiest-- an unabashedly rock'n'roll band album unafraid to stretch its songs past the 10-minute mark.

Dusker,Kiln,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b4a65e6ef95969322636/1:1/w_160/5f1b46df.jpg,2008-02-29 06:00:05,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11172-dusker/,Ghostly,"The Album Leaf is functional elevator-music to Brian Eno's conceptual elevator-music. It's pretty and beatific, but also unadventurous and a bit dull-- a rote version of what it emulates. In Kiln, Boards of Canada have found an Album Leaf of their own. The Michigan trio processes guitars, drums, and electronics into warm headphone tapestries of lambent melody and skittering rhythm, and while Dusker is dense with seductive ambiance, it seems like a rather disinterested seduction: plenty of stuff to flirt with the ear, little to close the deal. On paper, it's a little bit tough to pin down what makes Dusker less than satisfying: Everything appears to be in its right place. This album is obviously the result of meticulous editing: The melodic figures are deceptively stagnant, rolling through seamlessly blended iterations of various color and tone, and the even-keeled beats are syncopated with precise yet splintering percussive embellishments. The album flirts with ambient music and dub (the sort of nebulous electronic composition we file away under the catch-all ""IDM""), often simultaneously, as on ""Fyrepond"", with its echoing, clip-cloppy cadence, sputtering loop-ends, and glassy duotone melody, and ""Rustdusk"", a molten pool of swelling deep-tones and fizzy live-wire drums. Both of these compositions are skillfully turned, so why do they sound so affectless? While sonic fussiness is a prerequisite to making this sort of music, Dusker sounds like it fell prey to overzealous micro-management. Since one spitting drum program much resembles another, we count on artists to imprint some aspect of their personality into the medium, and Kiln appear to have scrubbed their music so clean that not a fingerprint remains. Nothing on Dusker offends, but much of it is forgettable. The exceptions are the tracks where Kiln doesn't rely on boggy rhythms alone to hold our interest, but enlivens them with emphatic melodic content, which makes for more balanced compositions. ""The Colorfreak"" is enhanced by a lively down-sweeping tune, adroitly capering across stereo channels. The hushing ""Airplaneshadows"" glows with a sprightly yet recessed piano theme, and the staticky ringtones of ""Arq"" are closer to Dntel's indie-rock-in-electro-clothing than anything IDM. For what it's worth, I think the Album Leaf gets a bad rap-- sometimes, all you need is some pleasant wallpaper, and they're great at plastering up the stuff. Ditto Kiln, whose staunch formalism works against their music's conceptual strength, but bolsters its modest functionality.","Like Boards of Canada, this Michigan trio processes guitars, drums, and electronics into warm headphone tapestries of lambent melody and skittering rhythm.

We Have You Surrounded,The Dirtbombs,by: Jason Crock,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b4a75e6ef9596932263a/1:1/w_160/ce33a79d.jpg,2008-02-29 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11173-we-have-you-surrounded/,In the Red,"On my list of bands most likely to record a concept album about creeping future dystopia, the Dirtbombs were not in the top 10. Yet here we have We Have You Surrounded, which, while featuring the same setup (two bass, two drums, one guitar), and the same knack for inventive cover versions, shifts focus ever so slightly toward cautionary science-fiction. The lyrics take a kaleidoscopic look at the slow decline of civilization, through such as the eyes of Alan Moore (the lyrics for ""Leopardman at C&A"" were taken from Moore's Songbook), militant and wasted northwestern youth (Dead Moon's ""Fire in the Western World""), rebels on the run (""I Hear the Sirens""), and, uh, in French (""La Fin du Monde""). Which, in theory, should work out just fine, as the Dirtbombs were first and foremost a theoretical band. Every record was to work around a new concept and a different sound entirely-- garage punk, classic soul, ""car-commercial"" ready pop-rock (the bubblegum record still sadly postponed). With this, Collins and co. should be able to just line up the records from their collections that correspond with the theme of paranoia and put the pieces together. No sweat. But with that distinctive instrumental lineup, that priceless fly-buzzer fuzz tone, and Collins wailing above it all, the Dirtbombs always sounded pretty much like themselves. Songs like ""Ever Lovin' Man"" won't get mistaken for anyone else, but this might be the first record where they make decisive leaps from their signature sound: Rather than becoming a new band, they simply shoot for being a more versatile one. It should be well within their grasp, but Surrounded was originally slated to be a five-song EP, and I have the sneaking suspicion that ""Wreck My Flow"" and ""Pretty Princess Day"" weren't among them, nor were odd transitions like ""They Have Us Surrounded"" or an eight-minute noise track. ""Wreck My Flow"" is a leaden litany that's like a garage-punk ""We Didn't Start the Fire"", and Collins sounds like he's being forced to record at gunpoint as he talk-sings through ""Pretty Princess Day"". But there are curveballs that work, for sure: Sparks' ""Sherlock Holmes"" gets the breathless ""Crimson and Clover"" treatment, making it all the more seductive without erasing the trace of malice in the original (""Dogs bark and he knows their breed/ And knows where they went last night...""). And the band sticks to a lovingly familiar script on ""Ever Lovin Man"", where the band cries ""yeaaah"" before its cathartic chorus like the crowd at a rally race, and chimes in on the silly a capella spy riff on ""Indivisible"". Not only does it keep things light, they're moments when, perhaps more so than on any previous record, The Dirtbombs sound like a band of five musicians with distinct input, rather than the many arms of Mick. In contrast, ""Leopardman"" seems too sober for the urgency of its lyrics, despite having a few choice dystopian images (including ""turning CDs into wind chimes,"" to which longtime vinyl supporters like the Dirtbombs add another layer by claiming here.) ""Race to the Bottom"" is an aimless collage of laser noises and shortwave radios gone mad, sounding like the robots-fucking track hidden at the end of Odelay, but without the rhythm. ""La fin du Monde"", however, might be the prettiest Dirtbombs track yet, with the same lo-fi bluster but guitars that shimmer rather than scratch while Collins croons a lullaby-like melody in French. The band mixing up the palette isn't a bad thing, and Collins, for all of his garage-rock pedigree, has always been a musical dabbler, not least in techno. But a transitional record? Now? After Jim Diamond left and they cleaned house in 2005 with the exhaustive compilation If You Don't Already Have a Look, the pessimist in me thought they were pretty much done. But they came back swinging, and while they swing a little wildly, there are enough safe plays here balanced with new strategies. So what if the best track is a cover, when they're one of the best and cleverest covers acts running (and most of their originals careful tributes besides)? The band's intermittent release schedule just makes them an inflatable clown you can't really knock down; all part of the luxury of only pulling your band together when the fancy strikes you-- or, more importantly, only when you want to.","On our list of bands most likely to record a concept album about creeping future dystopia, the Dirtbombs were not in the top 10.

"What Did You Do During the War, Daddy?",The Jet Age,by: Chris Dahlen,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b4a8b1335d7bf169a7a0/1:1/w_160/251cf0da.jpg,2008-02-29 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11174-what-did-you-do-during-the-war-daddy/,Sonic Boomerang,"The premise behind the Jet Age's heart-pounding rocker What Did You Do During the War, Daddy? sounds outlandish at first, although on record it's subtle: You wouldn't know what the story's really about unless you dug into the key lyrics and made a few leaps. Although this is staged as a concept album, it feels more like a 35-minute rush through the head of a man who's about to blow himself up. And by the way, that's the storyline: Eric Tischler has organized his latest songs around the story of a father and husband who, upset at the government and scared for the future of his family, becomes an American suicide bomber. Tischler-- the singer, guitarist and writer of the album-- acknowledges his debt to Pete Townsend and the Who, and a story this emotional but outlandish could bring back memories of Quadrophenia or maybe Tommy. But the end result isn't bombastic or over-complicated; there are no instrumentals, soliloquies, or drawn-out explanations. Tischler's trio, which includes fiercely melodic bassist Greg Bennett and the Keith Moon-esque fills of Pete Nuwayser, works across the board better than on their fine debut, Breathless. In fact, if it didn't have stop for the shoegazing catharsis of the Bennett-co-penned ""Now We Are Three"", it would almost end too quickly. The album is divided into three parts, where the protagonist-- who is not given a name-- has married a girl and sired two kids, and he's happy. But he's also growing frustrated with his country. Specific references to the Republican administration, Dick Cheney's promise to take us to ""the dark side,"" or the mother of all sudden terrors, 9/11, are unnecessary, and Tischler doesn't use any of them; the real subject is the character's state of mind. Anyone who's had a couple kids or owns even so much as a nice piece of furniture has probably, at some time, felt the fear that they can't protect any of it-- that while we're supposed to be adults with rights and protections, someday those protections could just vanish. Sleater-Kinney also aced this theme on their song, ""Far Away"", about how vulnerable you can feel for your kid all the way on the other side of the country from a terrorist attack. I'm not sure if the sentiment-- or the ferocious, taped-in-Tischler's-basement classic rock production-- speaks as deeply to younger rock fans who are in the ""nothing left to lose"" stage. But Tischler tries, with the falling-in-love-again rocker ""O, Calendar"". And all of the riffs are stellar. Personally, the album's heart comes right in the middle, on ""Dumb""-- an interior monologue from our hero, waiting out a long commute and mulling over his uselessness. He confesses he's scared to fight, but he's tired of accepting the ""fear"" and ""shame"": ""this world gave you to me, it can take you away."" This is fueled by the politics of the day, but the fear he nails is timeless.","The premise behind the Jet Age's What Did You Do During the War, Daddy? sounds outlandish at first: It's the story of a father and husband who, upset at the government and scared for the future of his family, becomes an American suicide bomber.

The Bees Made Honey in the Lion's Skull,Earth,by: Zach Baron,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b4dc9d034d5c69bf4f25/1:1/w_160/c6c515a0.jpg,2008-02-29 06:00:02,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11218-the-bees-made-honey-in-the-lions-skull/,Southern Lord,"Earth's ""Miami Morning Coming Down II (Shine)"" is a steady, sedate, chiming march, a primary-colored burst of guitars, organs, drums. For a man whose scuzzy, Melvins-mainlined Earth 2 remains the document for drone-and doom-minded depressives-- some of whom actually named their bands after Earth songs/guitar equipment-- Dylan Carlson's return as the Ennio Morricone of metal continues to confound. The band that borrowed their name from Sabbath's earliest, nuclear-paranoid incarnation have become optimists, purveyors of uplift. Where Earth once pounded chords flat, the newly reconfigured quartet pulls them out like taffy. ""Miami Morning Coming Down"" nods at Johnny Cash, spaghetti twang, gospel hymns; even Carlson's newest title, The Bees Made Honey in the Lion's Skull, turns his band's fearsome reputation inside out, offering up metal's ubiquitous skull as the birthplace of something sweet. Earth's hiatus, from 1996 to 2002, turned Carlson into a cult figure, and his return was fretted about by the acolytes he'd picked up while he was gone. Sunn0))), Boris, and Sleep had turned Carlson's sound into a movement-- a slow one, to be sure-- waiting eagerly for his return. Perversely, he came back with 2005's Hex, or Printing in the Infernal Method instead, a demoniacally glacial deconstruction of the post-rock twang that had abounded in his absence. Hex was heavy in the sense that it kept time even as Carlson meandered and detoured and wandered through melodic progressions so spaced out they sounded like jazz; one thing it definitely wasn't was Sunn0))). Carlson's concept for Bees was even more abstract. ""After we did Hex, we thought, 'Let's do a kind of gospel record,'"" Carlson told Pitchfork last year. Perhaps Carlson just meant strength in numbers: Bees is probably the most band-oriented thing Carlson's ever done, as much about drummer Adrienne Davies and organist Steve Moore as Carlson's guitar lines, which for the first time were added not first but last. The result is an imperceptible relay between keys, guitars, bass, and drums, with any given melodic line handed off three or four times in the course of a song. Over time, the parts stay the same, the instruments change, and time slows down-- after a while, the songs shrink down to exact moments, static pictures that morph so gradually you never spot the change. Still, Bees is the biggest, cleanest, and most flagrantly melodic record Earth's ever recorded. ""Omens and Portents I: The Driver"" has the kind of mildly ominous, lazily distorted tone that soaks Beach House records, while ""Omens and Portents II: Carrion Crow"" offers up the exact same five-note ascending harmony as the Microphones' ""I Love it So Much!"" It's left to Davies to provide the weight: ""I've always noticed that it's hard to get your playing down towards where your heartbeat is... It's all about keeping your heartbeat down, for me,"" she told Pitchfork. Carlson's always played slow, but six years of playing with Davies (and touring with bassist Don McGreevy) has given every Earth improv the same massive feel of doomy inevitability. Even as Carlson opens up, and looks up, Davies keeps his compositions anchored to the ground. But what melodies. ""Engine of Ruin"" deadpans a kind of flat keyboard line which Carlson expands, alternately following along and filling in, stalking down every harmonic permutation. ""Miami Morning Coming Down"" has probably Carlson's purest and most ravishing pattern ever, a trebly rise and fall that triggers nostalgia, sunrise, sunset, panic, elation, resignation. For a heavy record, Bees spends a lot of time just staring into space, thinking. When Earth started, in 1990, it was an oddball project among friends; Carlson was better known for being pals with an aspiring musician named Kurt Cobain than he was for being one in his own right. In a way, Bees feels as quixotic as anything he was doing then: where once he spent his days stripping down Sabbath to a single ringing chord, now he's stripping chords for parts. Amazingly, the results are just as huge. Who knew you could do so much so slowly?","Dylan Carlson's return as the Ennio Morricone of metal continues to confound, as he offers up the  biggest, cleanest, and most flagrantly melodic record Earth's ever recorded, a true band album as much about drummer Adrienne Davies and organist Steve Moore.

Sun Giant EP,Fleet Foxes,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b4cd5e6ef9596932267b/1:1/w_160/98bcce6c.jpg,2008-02-29 06:00:01,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11206-sun-giant-ep/,Sub Pop,"The opening track on Fleet Foxes' debut EP is the perfect introduction to this Seattle band, whose carefully fashioned songs reward more active listening than your typical indie-roots outfit. ""Sun Giant"" begins with their soft harmonies reverberating in what sounds like a cathedral space. With no accompaniment, their sustained a cappella notes fade slowly, adding gravity to this hymn of contentment: ""What a life I lead in the summer/ What a life I lead in the spring."" The only other instrument is Skyler Skjelset's mandolin, which enters late in the song playing a delicate theme as singer Robin Pecknold hums quietly. The Sun Giant EP-- sold on tour and digitally through Sub Pop, with a proper release forthcoming-- contains familiar sounds, but Fleet Foxes make something new and special with them, following their own musical whims as closely as they follow tradition. (Maybe more closely.) These five songs-- modest but never spare, atmospheric but never as an end in itself-- change shape constantly, taking in elements of classic rock, church music, old-timey folk, and soundtrack flourishes. Already mistaken for Southern rock (there's not enough boogie in Nicholas Peterson's drums for that), Fleet Foxes will bear repeated comparisons, both praising and disparaging, to groups like My Morning Jacket and Band of Horses, but those connections are based on superficial similarities like geography or the heavy use of reverb. In fact, Fleet Foxes' touchstones are much more diverse than that-- and not necessarily so contemporary. Until recently, their MySpace page listed Judee Sill, Crosby Stills & Nash, and Fairport Convention as influences, although now it reads ""not much of a rock band."" That's not especially true. You could also make a case that Fleet Foxes' demonstrative harmonies recall Fleetwood Mac; that their rearrangement and recombination of traditional styles hints at the Band or, more recently, Grizzly Bear; that their short, evocative instrumental phrasing bears similarities to Pinetop Seven. Such comparisons accompany the arrival of most young bands, but Fleet Foxes' songs inhabit a very specific, very rural space that's as much a product of how these songs are assembled as it is of how they sound. Like a novelist writing intricately winding sentences, the band craft hummable melodies that never quite go where you expect, but sound neither manipulated nor directed. After the quiet title track comes ""Drops in the River"", which builds gradually as the band patiently add instruments-- strange ambient clattering in the background and simple floor toms in place of a drum kit, accentuated with tambourine and a snaky electric guitar. Halfway through the song, Fleet Foxes reach a dramatic peak, and their next move is surprising: The music ebbs momentarily, as if to build anew through a second verse, but then picks up at that same dramatic level. Like the rest of the EP, ""Drops in the River"" possesses an intriguingly blunt concision, as though Fleet Foxes have no time for the luxury of long, slow crescendos or meandering jams. They focus their arrangements finely, emphasizing Pecknold's rustically impressionistic lyrics as much as their organic and inventive sound. ""English House"" and ""Mykonos"", the longest and most obviously ""rock"" songs, comprise the EP's rising action and reveal more of Fleet Foxes' range. The former is a graceful downward rush of guitars and percussion, with a falsetto chorus trimming the music like Christmas lights in the rafters. ""Mykonos"" doesn't travel as far as its title suggests, but thrives on the tension between Pecknold's wordless vocal intro and the band's intricate harmonies. Of course, it careens off in new directions. ""Brother, you don't need to turn me away,"" Pecknold pleads, bringing the song to a dramatic standstill. Then the band just runs away with the song again. The Sun Giant EP ends with Pecknold alone once more, singing ""Innocent Son"" with only a few brusque strums as accompaniment. With only the sparsest elements, he turns the song into a sort of rough county-road soul, his voice unceremoniously fading out on the final words. This song, and the others here, reinforce the impression that Sun Giant is more than a tour souvenir or a promotional teaser for a proper release. It's a sovereign work: a statement EP, supremely crafted and confident.","The first official release from Seattle-based Fleet Foxes may be largely influenced by vintage folk and rock LPs, but this pastoral psych-pop band does something special with these elements. Fusing classic rock, church music, old-timey folk, and epic, reverb-drenched harmonies, the group's brilliantly rustic songs never go quite where you expect them to, instead taking more scenic routes to arrive at perfect, natural conclusions.

12 Crass Songs,Jeffrey Lewis & the Jitters,by: Douglas Wolk,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b4a4c0084474cd0c22de/1:1/w_160/5c360918.jpg,2008-02-28 06:00:05,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11170-12-crass-songs/,Rough Trade,"Crass, as Scroobius Pip put it in ""Thou Shalt Always Kill"", were just a band, but they tried as hard as any band ever has to be more. Between 1978 and 1984, they made some extraordinary records-- explicitly political, full of raging wit and anarchist-utopian harangues-- and wrote some great songs in response to the headlines of their moment. But even their best songs depended on their cultural context. What mattered with Crass was the entire package: not just the music, as explosive as it sometimes was, but the way it was a part of their organization, their ideas about politics and economics, their design sense, and the autonomous way they lived their lives. Covering their songs makes about as much sense as covering ""The Ballad of John and Yoko"". So jokey NYC singer-songwriter Jeffrey Lewis making an album of a dozen re-arranged Crass songs is an audacious idea, but it's also a terrible idea. What Lewis has in common with them is frustrated-idealist politics and a penchant for lyrics that rattle on and on. He's a funny lyricist and a good cartoonist, but his recordings are almost entirely a delivery system for words; it's hard to imagine anybody listening to them for their sound. It's also hard to imagine anyone wanting to hear 12 Crass Songs more than once when listening to one of Lewis's ""real"" albums, or alternately an actual Crass album, is an option. Thankfully, Lewis doesn't try to sound at all like Crass-- he translates all the songs into his own idiom. But that idiom mangles them. His voice is flat and uncertain, both in affect and in pitch; he mostly sticks to one or two notes, which gets old fast when he's delivering Crass's 800-word lyrics; his arrangements, for the most part, are straightforward guitar/drum acoustic-antifolkie stuff, with occasional string and organ parts or Helen Schreiner's equally wobbly voice chiming in. The formal disconnect between source and style actually sort of works once, on the anarchist manifesto ""Big A Little A""-- partly because the song's almost a jumprope rhyme (""No one ever changed the church by pulling down a steeple/ Systems aren't made of bricks, they're mostly made of people""), partly because Lewis doesn't shy away from its potential for big noise. Twelve is eleven too many, but that song, by itself, would've been a clever gesture. Still, to make music in Crass's spirit isn't to repeat their utterances but to follow their example. (No American musician has come up with a response to the Iraq war as furious, direct and daring as Crass's string of records about the Falklands war: ""Sheep Farming in the Falklands"", ""How Does It Feel to Be the Mother of 1000 Dead?"", and ""Yes Sir, I Will"".) When Lewis and Schreiner chant the 27-year-old couplet ""Be exactly who you want to be, do what you want to do/ I am he and she is she, but you're the only you"", it's hard to tell if they're missing the point on purpose.","Jokey NYC singer-songwriter Jeffrey Lewis offers an album of a dozen re-arranged songs from the explicitly political, often witty Crass.

Ode to the Ghetto,Guilty Simpson,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b4a513d197565213ab38/1:1/w_160/ac1de3ca.jpg,2008-02-28 06:00:04,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11171-ode-to-the-ghetto/,Stones Throw,"At the risk of sounding thick, I'll admit I needed a second to get the joke of Guilty Simpson's name, so you can imagine what kind of endorsement it is to say that's what passes for ""clever"" on Ode to the Ghetto. Just as Lupe Fiasco diverts interviews to boast about his gully Chicago upbringing, Stones Throw interrupts its wise exploration of alternative hip-hop and puts its goodwill on the line in order to release a thoroughly mediocre gangsta rap album. Not that Ode to the Ghetto was likely to be any better in the event it was inspired by cartoons and video games instead of more traditional muses, since like his namesake, Simpson creates a document of violent crime that's hard to take seriously even if it's based in reality. Detroit's reputation obviously precedes itself, and yet Motor City native Simpson robs the city of its menace by presenting it in the most generic terms possible here, rendering it as replicable as a Levittown. Dope boys have the block on lock (""Footwork"") and are more admirable than the cops trying to stop them (""Pigs""). Guns pop off and mouthy bitches won't shut the fuck up (""She Won't Stay at Home""). Perhaps it's meant as some sort of commentary on the universality of ghetto hardship, but I think that's giving Simpson far too much credit after suffering though the pointedly low ambitions of ""The Real Me"" and ""Getting Bitches"" (rhymes with ""getting riches""), or hearing Sean P show him how this C-list rap shit is done (""Run""). At the very least, Simpson finds more inspiration in popular undie rap's leading beatsmiths; Madlib, Oh No, Black Milk, and J Dilla (oddly responsible for championing this dude) gamely give ""A"" efforts while Simpson ramrods everything with a bullish flow reminiscent of a blue-collar hardhead like Obie Trice. At times, he'll wisely refrain from any sort of attempt at a hook, but the times he goes in-- the off-key ramble of ""Robbery"", for one-- are painful. And his attempted slang-slinging on ""Footwork"" makes Juelz Santana's awkward ""Clockwork"" sound Webster's-bound. If you're feeling generous, you might call ""I Must Love You"" Simpson's Mike Skinner moment; potentially penetrating in its detail, an already faltering relationship is upset by a perceived flirtation in a Red Lobster. But Simpson's boredom with the actual argument with his girlfriend spills over to him sounding bored relating the story, at which point you want to be involved in this about as much as he did. He eventually closes it with ""why you actin' like a bitch again,"" a question that really can never be answered, but it's appropriately honest for a record that's mostly incapable of inspiring any sort of meaningful reaction.","Stones Throw interrupts its wise exploration of alternative hip-hop and puts its goodwill on the line in order to release a thoroughly mediocre gangsta rap album.

XMMER,His Name Is Alive,by: Nitsuh Abebe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b4a95e6ef9596932263e/1:1/w_160/c3b883b7.gif,2008-02-28 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11175-xmmer/,Reincarnate,"There are a lot of qualities that can keep a great album under wraps-- sometimes it's not even the type of music that makes a difference, so much as the words critics have to use to talk about it. This might be a little of what went on with His Name Is Alive's last record, Detrola. The album was a gorgeous accomplishment, pulling threads of American music-- folk, blues, r&b, gospel-- together with synthesizers and obsessive attention to sound and space, and coming up with a sound that was entirely unique, remarkably natural, and thoroughly pop; it collected, quietly, a decent number of glowing reviews. (That includes one from me, here.) But it also has a lot of the qualities that make critical darlings hard to make big waves about: This was sedate and cerebral stuff, on a ""small"" release from an older guy, holed up in his studio, working in an aesthetic that felt insular, personal, not-for-everyone. Not exactly the kind of thing that goes in headlines and on covers, even if it turns out incredibly well. And hey, what do I know: Plenty of people listened to it and didn't hear much of interest to fuss over. Xmmer, the latest from Warn Defever and company, is a sort of companion piece to Detrola, but it goes a whole lot further in that not-for-everyone direction. The tracks here have less of the pop precision that marked its predecessor, as if they were side material from the same sessions; they're also a lot more synth-free, focusing in on the twang of more traditional instruments. The set sprawls and meanders, and the vocals-- unlike Detrola's rotating cast of singers-- come entirely from the close-miked, sleepy-sounding woman called Andy FM, whose voice and melodies always feel more like chants or humming; they're incredibly low on affect, a dealbreaker for the many, many listeners who justifiably expect singers to be expressive. These songs don't reach out and grab you: They sit patiently, waiting for you to dive and sink even further into the band's current sound-- specifically the droning, old-weird-America side of it, where everything sounds like dive-bar jukeboxes and dirges. They're also filled with great ideas, though-- even if a lot of them are the sorts that'll mostly blow the minds of other people who play or record music. The most arresting is ""The Wolf Put His Mouth on Me"", and its curious arrangement is more proof that Defever can organize sounds in ways you're not likely to get from anyone else. Maybe he's just been listening to the African band Konono No. 1: First comes what sounds like a slightly overdriven thumb piano, then a clean one; then a tense clatter of drums, spread interestingly across speakers; then saxophones pushing along; then a psychedelic guitar line. These are the thrills of a studio rat-- you don't look for the melody to develop or the chords to change, you just marvel at the tones, the rhythms, and the astounding and original ways noises are being arranged in space. There are plenty of those moments, many of them in minor keys, and many of them finding the kinships and middle spaces between different strains of music: central-African rhythm and dark folk, funeral marches and r&b, bluesy country and sunny pop. There's some of Detrola's dabbling in Bacharach-styled pop (""This Is My Confession""), a few looks back at the kind of work this band did in the 1990s (""Oh Miss Flower""), some weirdified German-style pulse (""Sangaree""), and another ""Wolf""-style clatter on ""Come out the Wilderness"". And yet, for such a grab-bag of interesting sonic ideas, it floats by with a certain dirgey sameyness, as if melody and motion are far from its chief concerns. Think of this one as a B-album-- all the fascinating ideas that require more of your patience and indulgence than Detrola ever did, something for fans to chew on while we wait to see if another great one is on the way.","Veteran Michigan band follows its underappreciated Detrola with a sort of companion piece, albeit one focused less on synths and more on the twang of more traditional instruments.

Naked Acid,Valet,by: Grayson Currin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b4d4ea9e61561daa6cef/1:1/w_160/414b573a.jpg,2008-02-28 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11212-naked-acid/,Kranky,"Calling Valet constant Honey Owens a Portland musician is a simplification: Aside from two LPs in two years as the spectral Valet, Owens has contributed to Jackie O-Motherfucker and Dark Yoga. She's a member of broken funk trio Nudge and the touring bassist for Kranky labelmate Atlas Sound. She also co-owns Rad Summer, a hand-me-down and homemade clothing store that sells local music, hangs local art, repurposes used bikes, and, of course, hosts shows. Owens also co-founded and booked Dunes, a music club that the Portland Mercury calls the city's ""hippest dark hallway/dance club,"" and she runs the tiny Yarnlazer label with her longtime boyfriend, White Rainbow's Adam Forkner. Owens, if anything, is a Portland mixed-media outlet and conduit. Naked Acid, the follow-up to 2007's Valet debut Blood is Clean, functions with the same parts-into-a-whole synergy as its creator. The first five songs work almost exclusively through distended sounds, creeping up through patient drones, manipulated vocals, and echo-in-canyon drums to slow payoffs. The sixth song, ""Fire"", is a lovesick ballad, an elliptical guitar/voice/tape-hiss first-take that Owens admits is about giving up drugs. The final song explodes the sounds of the first five beneath a noisy, throbbing beat, like Neil Campbell's Astral Social Club ripping Valet apart and spinning everything back on the faster reel. On first listen, such a sequence may seem like a ruse or even an apology: After 35 minutes of long-form washes and only slightly comprehensible vocals, ""Fire"", the shortest thing here and the most straightforward Valet song released to date, could be an attempt at relief or a stab at a single (which it was, in 2007, as a 7"" for Burnt Brown Sounds). The same goes for beat-and-synth closer ""Streets"", a track that could give attention-deficient mp3 bloggers a toe-tap inlet into a record they'd otherwise ignore. Or perhaps Owens is offering herself an outlet for how future Valet records may sound. But keep listening, and it seems that the album-length incorporation of three distinct Valet styles is more a reflection of individual tracks themselves than an attempt to find common ground with a new lot of Kranky converts (see also: Deerhunter/Atlas Sound patrons). The ""ambient"" songs aren't ambient at all. Nothing is played too straight on those first five, their textures teeming with variety: Over a matrix of manipulated chimes and bowls, Owens and Adrian Orange combine for a ghastly duet on opener ""We Went There"". Her acid guitar tone slowly spills over the singing before an enormous electronic wash supplants it, too, sustaining the mood but slowly fading away. ""Kehaar"" sounds like Delta blues choking on lithium pills, a direct beat pulsing behind one chord and Owens' wounded whisper. Over five minutes, sheets of noise appear from beneath, slowly drowning Owens. They're all that matter as the song peaks, as with album highlight ""Fuck It"": In five minutes, it goes from a dramatic poetry reading backed by ragged, glorious guitar into a restrained Magik Markers noize + drumz berating. Thing is, these layers aren't immediately apparent: Naked Acid is a well-conceived and executed album, all its variety sewn into a single quilt that's strangely comforting and surprisingly sensible. The advance of Naked Acid is substantial if subtle, as with most everything Owens has committed to tape. Owens has finally incorporated her varied musical interests into one record, something she implies with the first five tracks but explains with the last two. After all, she says these songs-- elliptical but elegant, woven from phrases like ""trees susurration, influential lake"" and ""warm kept my future cat""-- were written about specific people and events in Portland. These are things she's seen and lived. Blood is Clean was a fine series of snapshots connected by poetic vagaries, warped tones, and low-lying dynamics. Naked Acid is that, too, but here, Owens' different ideas finally feel like one long thought from one highly engaged person.","Portland Renaissance woman Honey Owens returns for her second album as Valet, this time fusing the project's distinct styles-- patient drones with manipulated vocals, lovesick ballads, spiky tunes infused with electronic noise-- into a unified whole that works terrifically as an album.

"The Complete Motown Singles, Vol. 9: 1969",Various Artists,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b4c9b1335d7bf169a7d2/1:1/w_160/9a1bf60c.jpg,2008-02-28 06:00:01,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11203-the-complete-motown-singles-vol-9-1969/,Hip-O Select,"The most famous recording from 1969 isn't a piece of music at all. It's a muffled, static-soaked transmission from the moon, Neil Armstrong announcing that he'd taken a giant leap for all of mankind as he left the first footprints in the gray dust. What an odd time 1969 was in the U.S. Here we had a man walking on the moon while halfway around the world we had kids getting dropped in the jungle to be killed and maimed by bullets and punji sticks. Dozens of cities were still recovering from destructive riots (a few, including Detroit-- which saw rioting in 1967-- never did) and we had new President Richard M. Nixon urging the ""Silent Majority"" to come forward and support an impossible war. Where had that giant leap for mankind actually taken us? If you were a poor, disenfranchised black man living in a Detroit neighborhood full of boarded-up shops you could be forgiven for wondering. This was the very type of neighborhood Motown was busy vacating as the year dawned-- all that remained of the original Hitsville cluster of houses that served as the company's early headquarters was the Snakepit studio. The rest had moved downtown to a towering office building, forever altering the dynamic of the label's creative process. Even as the operation was moving downtown, Motown was already beginning its transition to Los Angeles, to where founder Berry Gordy had decamped the previous year without fanfare. 1968 had been a rough year for Motown, with the riots and the assassinations of Martin Luther King, Jr. and Bobby Kennedy serving as a backdrop for the legal proceedings that followed the rancorous departure of the label's most productive and successful songwriter/producer team, Holland Dozier Holland, in 1967. There was a sense, not unfounded, that Motown was falling a bit behind the curve, sticking to its guns as funk, psychedelia, and flower power passed it by. The hits were still coming, but the people in the trenches-- the producers, writers, and performers-- realized in 1968 that the signature Motown Sound needed to change and get with the times. That meant getting funkier, heavier, more topical, and taking better advantage of the album format that had previously ridden in the back seat while 45-RPM singles drove sales. The Supremes and the Temptations were the label's two banner acts, and they'd joined forces in late 1968 for a television special that ultimately spawned a couple of LPs and a raft of hit singles, not to mention a second TV extravaganza in 1969. Both acts had also ended the year with singles that were among Motown's most socially conscious to date-- the Supremes' child-out-of-wedlock narrative ""Love Child"" and the Temptations' thunderous psychedelic soul masterpiece ""Cloud Nine"". The latter, with its traded leads between all five voices, hard beat, and crunchy wah-wah guitar, became the A-side blueprint for the Tempts and producer Norman Whitfield in 1969, from ""Runaway Child Running Wild"" (edited down from its nine-minute LP runtime for the single) to the funked-up love song ""I Can't Get Next to You"". By the end of the year, they were off to the ""Psychedelic Shack"" and in the middle of a mind-blowing run of hits. The Supremes, on the other hand, were in for a world of change. They'd officially been Diana Ross & the Supremes since mid-1967, and Gordy was dead-set on breaking Ross out of the group and getting her solo career started. He spent most of the year looking for a high note for her to leave the group on, which finally came in October, when Johnny Bristol, who spent 1969 establishing himself as one of the label's top producers, dusted off an old gem he'd written in 1961 for himself and Jackey Beavers, ""Someday We'll Be Together"". It was a wistful, weightless track that became the label's last number one of the 60s and gave Ross her final peak with the Supremes, the other two of whom didn't even appear on the single. It's narratives like this that Hip-O Select's Complete Motown Singles series follows so well-- you can listen to what each artist did each year, how the label chose follow-ups to big hits, where the ups and downs were, and what the label tried that didn't work, all together in chronological order and with hugely informative notes for every release. It's these last two things that really spike the value of the sets-- almost everybody knows the hits, and soul collectors are bound to know the B-sides, but the forays into country and crooner records, half-hearted attempts to crack the rock market, and weird novelties tend to get lost in the shuffle. Some get lost for a reason, of course. This set includes a single by Soupy Sales parodying ""MacArthur Park"" (which itself was written by former Motown songwriter Jimmy Webb) that is just not funny, and the ""punch-in"" comedy routine ""The Luney Landing"", which features corny announcers asking questions of astronauts and receives answers in the form of brief song clips, is best forgotten. There are a few easy listening sides that don't wear very well either, but for sitting through each of these you get treasures in return. For instance, there are two brilliant singles by the Fantastic Four, a vocal group that regrettably never managed to get much attention during its time at the label. There is also a scattering of jazz instrumentals worth hearing. Another thing that makes this set fascinating is that it catches Motown in full-fledged transition, casting a much wider net than usual and upgrading the equipment. Motown got its first 16-track boards that year, and a cover of the Band's ""The Weight"" by Diana Ross & the Supremes and the Tempations became the label's first stereo single. Shorty Long and original Funk Brothers drummer Benny Benjamin both died far too soon, Harvey Fuqua and Billy Eckstine left, and the Marvelettes, Motown's first hit girl group, called it quits. Whitfield's aggressive new funk style paid dividends not only the Temptations, but for Marvin Gaye and Gladys Knight & the Pips as well, while Johnny Bristol was busy taking Junior Walker, long the personification of grit at Motown, in the other direction, sanding off the hardest edges to deliver a truckload of hits. Two new labels joined the fold that year as well, essentially making 1969 the year Motown stopped dabbling in other sounds and started genuinely branching out. Hugh Masekela and Stewart Levine's Chisa label was founded in 1965 to promote African sounds in the U.S., and it became part of the Motown family in 1969. Actually, there aren't any African artists in the clutch of singles Chisa released that year, but there are a number of adventurous jazz and funk sides, including Monk Montgomery's wild electric bass-lead cover of Stevie Wonder's ""A Place in the Sun"". If only James Jamerson had been given a similar chance. The other new label was Rare Earth, Motown's rock label, coined for a Detroit rock band of the same name that would become its flagship act. Early on, Rare Earth focused on licensing British and Australian rock singles for the U.S. market, including discs by the Pretty Things and the Easybeats (none of these are included here because Motown never owned them), but the intention was always to produce new material. Rare Earth's first single flopped, but it's worth hearing. The real gem from that label's first year, though, is former Vancouver Wes Henderson's ""In Bed"", b/w ""Reality"", a double-sided blast of psychedelic soul that's the closest thing to an answer to Hendrix Motown ever put out. There are other tremendous sides lurking on these six discs. Chuck Jackson's ""Are You Lonely For Me Baby"" is a brilliant, funky song that hints at Southern soul and balances the heavy beat of its verses with a subdued chorus featuring the Andantes, Motown's long-time female backing vocal corps, singing the title. And Edwin Starr's first smash, ""Twenty-Five Miles"", kicks the whole thing off with a stomping, powerhouse performance, both from Starr, who's at the peak of his screaming, grunting brilliance, and the Funk Brothers, who hammer home the song's fitting message of resolve to reach a goal. The goal in the song is a woman, but it could easily scan as a metaphor for Motown itself as the calendar flipped. All of this is fantastic, but we haven't even gotten to the biggest seismic event of 1969 for Motown: the arrival of the Jackson 5. Gordy had been hearing about them from his artists for about a year, but remained skeptical, being generally against the concept of ""kids groups,"" as he called them. And then he heard them. This was no ordinary kids group-- they'd been drilled into a dynamic unit by their father, and they possessed a magnetic focal point in young Michael, who tackled adult lyrical themes with a range of expression well beyond his years. Deke Richards had been kicking around a song called ""I Wanna Be Free,"" intended for Gladys Knight & the Pips, but brought it to Gordy when the Five joined the label. A few re-writes later, it was ""I Want You Back"", an instant number one and one of the best debut singles ever. Tellingly, ""I Want You Back"" was written, rehearsed, and recorded in L.A., and Gordy generally kept the Jackson 5 away from Detroit. The song's writing credit also went to The CorporationTM, a group of long-tenured Motown writers (including Gordy) who'd previously credited themselves as the Clan several times. This L.A.-centric approach and depersonalization of the credits-- to something called the Corporation, no less-- signaled a huge change for the company's way of doing business, and solidified the various arrows pointing toward the company's future out West. Crediting a song to the Corporation just a couple of months after Woodstock had re-energized the hippie movement also strikes me today as woefully out of step with the zeitgeist of the era-- Motown's own Temptations had scored a huge hit earlier that year with ""Don't Let the Joneses Get You Down"", a sharp-tongued takedown of rampant consumerism. And in the end, the hippies carried the day, as far as popular memory is concerned. Motown had hit after hit in 1969, but perhaps the signature musical moment of the year came far away, on a farm in upstate New York, when Jimi Hendrix had his electrified way with the ""Star Spangled Banner"", a rendition that captured in the starkest possible terms the complex feelings that came with being an American. There we were on the moon, and there we were in Vietnam, and finding the thread between those things was tough. Motown couldn't find it either, but the label did regain its footing in 1969, and this set makes that fact undeniable.","Hip-O Select's latest in its exhaustive series of singles collections gathers all of Motown's sides from 1969, a tumultuous and transitional year for both the label and its (soon to be former) Detroit home.

Some People Have Real Problems,Sia,by: Liz Colville,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b496b1335d7bf169a785/1:1/w_160/6cc72c24.jpg,2008-02-27 06:00:05,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11158-some-people-have-real-problems/,Hear Music,"Each of Sia Furler's albums has been released on a different label, but it should come as no surprise that her fourth, and most promising, comes on Starbucks' label Hear Music. (It also should be no surprise that Hear Music has helped make this her most commercially successful record.) The Adelaide-born English crossover, who has worked with Jamiroquai, Massive Attack, and Zero 7, has been a likeable, clean-voiced accessory for years, but she got her first (independent) big break when ""Breathe Me"", off 2004's Color the Small One, was featured in the final episode of Six Feet Under and caused a minor that. Some People Have Real Problems tries to be something else: brazen yet fun, sophisticated yet goofy. Composed in large part by Sia in conjunction with her supporting instrumentalists, the songs are full of bounce, springtime, and California cool. And Beck is featured on two tracks, ""Academia"" and ""Death By Chocolate"". But it doesn't help. From the start, Problems nods to both Sia's résumé and to her neighbors on the latté bar: Feist's playful, smokey ballads and Zero 7's drum-and-bass slugs. ""Little Black Sandals"" screams failure just by mentioning a pair of shoes in its title (see: Katherine McPhee) and the R&B reaches are dreadful. ""Lentil"" is brave and explorative by rhythm and melody, inserting a pinch of Regina Spektor-via-Tori Amos into the mix. Still, the chorus is too bland and the rhythm too slow. This andante dullness is prevalent on the album, as if Norah Jones were going about stealing Feist's audience. has potential, but where this song could actually use the heat and the punch of percussion, there is none. ""The Girl You Lost to Cocaine"" is stellar, but like Esthero before her, Sia so often concedes to choruses that are rote and thin on the ground, packed full of airy, electrified harmonies. I want soars, climbs, and surprising bridges; instead there are puffed up harmonies and a tad of decoration from the brass and keys. The anticipation of the chorus is enough to play the song on repeat for a couple of days, but the chorus is still there, irritatingly memorable, and, in fact, it seeps into every part of the song, dominating the subtle inventions of melody and Sia's clear talent for deft hops around the scale. ""Electric Bird"" is a winner, though it, too, has stock elements in its alternatively languorous and rushed lyrics, pumps from the brass, and tricky shifts into minor key. ""Playground""'s all click-clacking and hand-clapping and more overused vocal multi-tracking. I'd venture to say Sia has not penned a single song without this feature. The perfect balance-- and the potential that few of the tracks reach-- is uncovered on ""Soon We'll Be Found"", which is sexy and balladic, yet dark and raging. It's surprising, colorful, and complex. But there are too many attempts at this type of song, and not enough of the springtime fun suggested on the ridiculous cover. If Sia spent more time at the piano, and/or hired Robyn to write her a couple of tracks, the results could be marvelous. But as it stands, Sia is not aware of her potential-- or rather, her options.","Longtime vocal contributor to the likes of Zero 7 and Massive Attack returns with her fourth solo album, a user-friendly, electronics-free easy-listening session featuring a little Beck and a lot of ballads.

Ghost Dance,The Pine Hill Haints,by: Andrew Gaerig,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b4a3b1335d7bf169a797/1:1/w_160/fcc31c5f.jpg,2008-02-27 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11169-ghost-dance/,K,"Punk rockers don't need anything extra to get vigilant and pissy about; the genre can do without regionalism. I mean, have you ever tried talking to a Dropkick Murphys fan? All the regular punk shit-- youthful rage, middle-fingers-to-the-man, no perspective-- all that plus regional pride. It's intimidating. Consider, then, the Pine Hill Haints: On the scale of unreasonable bands and fanbases, defiantly Alabamian punk/rockabilly troupe who used to practice in a graveyard should rank really, really high. Strange, then, just how patient and precise the quintet's third full-length and first for K Records, Ghost Dance, sounds. In the midst of what should be a near-insufferable territorial pissing contest, the Haints have stumbled on a winning formula: choppy, rhythm-centric odes to Buddy Holly and Carl Perkins-- mostly about girls, but often about ghosts, too. This, to be fair, is how the Haints have always operated, but Ghost Dance distinguishes itself with deft arrangements and an old-hound's sense of restraint. Frontman Jamie Barrier has plenty of fire but tired bones; he dutifully carries out those ""whoa-oh-oh""'s by himself, like this rallying cry shit is sort of silly but has nonetheless got to get done. The world is changed when a band signs to K and gets less lo-fi, but no doubt some of the credit lies with label-guru Calvin Johnson who produced more than half of Ghost Dance's 20 tracks. Barrier's pattering guitar is allowed plenty of acreage to pound out slyly danceable rhythms. Drummer Ben Rhyne breaks his martial snare into fractal riffs. Occasional swaths of accordion, mandolin, fiddle carry traces of bluegrass and Celtic music. Sometimes things are wacky: Rhyne is credited with playing a ""snake rattle"", Matt Bakula with washtub bass. Tracks like ""Death by Stereo"" and ""For Every Glass That's Empty"" don't offer a lot of low-end but their hollowed-out take on sock-hop rock shake with teenage familiarity. Several public domain covers-- ""You're Gonna Need Somebody on Your Bond"", ""St. James Infirmary Blues"", and ""Columbus Stockade Blues"", among others-- don't differ substantially in style or sound but suggest the Haints are paying proper attention to their roots. All of this attention to history and form give more than adequate weight to Barrier's love-slush nonsense. During ""I Never Thought the Day Would Come"" the drums drops out in one of those romantic punk moments: ""To the people in the city/ Where you would disappear/ I follow you in the dark light of every street my dear"". Elsewhere he smokily urges, ""Shine on/ Catfish angels"", whatever the hell that means, likely something about a girl. Or a ghost. Mostly, though, clichés abound, and they are welcome clichés. Refreshingly restrained, pleasingly punk, Ghost Dance goes to great lengths not to overextend itself; what might've been a tireless four-on-the-floor is instead a boxful of tender, shaky paeans.","Alabama punk band's third album, and first for K Records, is a winning set of choppy, rhythm-centric odes to Buddy Holly and Carl Perkins -- mostly about girls, but often about ghosts, too.

Kutiman,Kutiman,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b4979d034d5c69bf4ebc/1:1/w_160/1b660564.jpg,2008-02-27 06:00:03,Global,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11159-kutiman/,Groove Attack,"I know music I like when I hear it. I've never been able to enumerate a list of things I like or don't like in music, and I don't always necessarily know why I like something-- it just flips that switch we all have inside of us. Ultimately, I don't think it's important to know why we like the music we do, because the act of liking it is self-justifying. I'm saying all this in part because I couldn't immediately think of a way to describe what's so great about Kutiman. I know one thing, though: I like this. Ophir Kutiel (the Kutiman moniker stems from his family name, but could as easily be read as admiration for Nigerian Afrobeat icon Fela Kuti) is a solo act from Tel Aviv, Israel, a one-man band who occasionally brings in his friends when he thinks they can improve the sound or he needs some horns (he needs them often). His music is something like Israel itself, a mishmash of things from all over the world, the old and the new side by side, a melting pot with a common overarching identity. He's schooled in the funk and fusion of the 1970s, Afrorock and Afrobeat, heavy psych from the 60s, hip-hop and modern R&B, a bit of reggae and dub, a couple decades of electronic music, and the general art of the groove. This comes together in a fantastic, head-spinning debut album, a psyched-up groove monster that can't decide between vintage and modern and instead just has it both ways. It works in the same way a lot of releases on the Ubiquity label, like Shawn Lee's Ping Pong Orchestra or Will Holland's Quantic, work, by finding that switch that makes you forget about the why and just enjoy the what. It opens with a light appetizer in instrumental ""Bango Fields"", a basic funk track topped with a squiggle of ring-modulated analog synth that suggests Kutiel might be able to make a pretty good living as a hip-hop producer, but that barely prepares the listener for the album as a whole. ""No Reason For You"", one of several tracks that features vocals by Elran Dekel, follows with a crushing Led Zeppelin beat, heavy Fela horn section, huge, sweeping chorus, and a towering, psychedelic hook that sounds like a cross between a choir and a string section but actually probably comes from a synthesizer. The synthesizer on ""Once You're Near Me"" is more playful, sort of an electro-exotica hook for Dekel to play off. He's a pretty versatile singer, giving a pointed, almost ominous performance on ""No Reason"", while his contribution to ""Once You're Near Me"" sounds like a lounge signer sucked into an echo chamber. Kutiel's other principle vocal collaborator, Karolina, has a voice sort of like a melting trumpet-- you can tell she's listened to a least a few Billie Holiday records. She sounds especially great on the jazz-inflected ""Trumpet Woman"", wherein she imitates the titular instrument to great effect over a miles-thick bass line and chilled-out drumbeat. She gets a little more down and dirty on the spectacular funk workout ""Music Is Ruling My World"", given a kickass drum break and a big horn section to duke it out with. Even when the album moves away from funk workouts, it remains engrossing. ""I Just Wanna Make Love to You"" provides a chilly interlude at the album's midpoint, with muted trumpet and saxophone wandering through an R&B fog driven by a downtempo funk beat. The closest thing I can think to compare it to is DJ Shadow's ""What Does Your Soul Look Like? (part 1)."" Somewhere in all that, there are a whole lot of reasons to like this record. It's an album that feels right all over the place-- in the car, at home late at night, on a large soundsystem at a party...Kutiman takes all his influences, gives them a swirl and emerges with a great debut that hits that elusive switch over and over.","This Israeli one-man band has created a fantastic, head-spinning debut album, a psyched-up groove monster that can't decide between vintage and modern and instead just has it both ways.

Red Yellow Blue,Born Ruffians,by: Stuart Berman,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b4b9ea9e61561daa6cc7/1:1/w_160/5ffba086.jpg,2008-02-27 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11189-red-yellow-blue/,Warp,"Scenes often imply a style, but for the most visible exports of Toronto's post-millennial indie-rock scene-- Broken Social Scene, the Constantines, the Hidden Cameras-- the unifying principle has been not so much a common musical aesthetic as a communal ethic: the compulsion to crowd the stage with players and audience members alike, turning observers into participants and vice versa. Arriving in Toronto three years ago from the nearby town of Midland, on paper Born Ruffians seemed antithetical to the prevailing group-hug atmosphere: they boast no auxiliary horn or string sections, no spotlight-stealing guest female singers, no balaclava-clad dancers-- just three unassuming kids in standard guitar/bass/drums formation. But Born Ruffians haven't let their personnel deficiencies and basic instrumentation stop them from thinking and functioning like a mass collective-- they simply hoot and holler and make a spectacle of themselves (a cappella group-huddle sing-alongs, anyone?) like a band three times their size. Born Ruffians' 2006 debut EP packed this restless vigor into six compact but complicated songs: wiry frontman Luke LaLonde shrieked about getting laid and getting paid, while bassist Mitch DeRosier and drummer Steve Hamelin seemed to be reacting not to the singer's melodic cues, but the convulsions in his puberty-freaked voice. So compared to this petulant precedent, the opening title track to the band's first full length, Red Yellow Blue, goes down like a horse tranquilizer: amid a rippling, hypnotic guitarpeggio, the sound of distant whistles and an eerily expansive sense of space, LaLonde's voice assumes a Panda Bear-like levity, as he sings of a fantasy to start his own country and choose the colors for its flag: ""Such a myriad to choose from/ I pick red, yellow, and blue."" Of course, he would go with primary colors-- for all their spastic outbursts and time-signature trickery, at the heart of every Born Ruffians song is a plea for simplicity. That a band as tightly wound as Born Ruffians would eventually loosen the noose is not surprising; perhaps all those unwanted copies of Some Loud Thunder sitting in record stores served as a sobering reminder of what happens when a nervy indie-rock band sticks too close to type. But Red Yellow Blue plays out not as some premeditated step toward maturity-- following that opening reverie, the giddy one-two punch of ""Barnacle Goose"" and ""Hummingbird"" reassert equal proportions of the herky and the jerky-- rather, it explores different shades of the young-man's blues. Almost every song here sounds like a defense of some innocent ideal-- cooking dinner for ""ma and pa and grand mama"" (""Hedonistic Me""), a promise of unconditional love even ""when the money's gone"" (the Built to Spillerific stomper ""Badonka Donkey"")-- which, of course, makes LaLonde something of a modern-day outlaw. Hamelin and DeRosier's cheeky back-up harmonies reinforce the image of a 1950s doo-wop gang, summoned by LaLonde as if they were his own personal Sha Na Na. But for all their childlike abandon, Born Ruffians are still too twitchy to ever come off as twee. For a three piece, they're like an anti-power-trio: LaLonde's tinny guitar tone is as thin as his frame, and Hamelin seems more intent on hitting the rims than the skins. But the threadbare presentation means the band never lets itself get too comfortable, instead introducing novel mid-song change-ups to elevate a track (the winsome two-part campfire serenade ""Little Garcon, Little Fille""), or in some cases, salvage them (""In a Mirror"", which, just as its circular melody crosses the line from insidious to annoying, kicks into a rousing victory-lap send-off). Or sometimes, it's just an easy but effective ploy to heighten the drama, like the middle break in ""Kurt Vonnegut"" that halts the song's drum-rolled momentum but sets up its heart-rending climax, where the Ruffians gradually lay off their instruments and, in three-part harmony, coax a girl to her bedroom window like a multi-headed Lloyd Dobler. After this grand finale, it's surprising that Born Ruffians have anything left for closer ""Red Elephant"", and as such, the song feels like an unnecessary addendum, its repeating pattern of dirgey verses and sped-up choruses constituting one of the few instances here where the songwriting feels routine. But even if Red Yellow Blue overstays its welcome for one song, it still counts as one of this new year's most engaging and endearing indie-rock debuts. Which may echo the sentiments attributed to another debut album on this site recently, but then Born Ruffians are the Vampire Weekend you don't have to fret over-- all the witty wordplay and jingle-jangle joy, none of the nagging questions about Afro-pop appropriation and Ivy League privilege.","First full-length by the herky-jerky indie rock trio from Toronto expands outward from their debut EP, not so much a premeditated step toward maturity as an exploration of different shades of the young-man's blues.

From the Valley to the Stars,El Perro Del Mar,by: Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b4b6c0084474cd0c22fe/1:1/w_160/d63683fc.jpg,2008-02-27 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11187-from-the-valley-to-the-stars/,Licking FingersControl Group,"Irving Stone named his biographical novel about Michelangelo The Agony and the Ecstasy. Sweden's Sarah Assbring sculpts her high-concept pop out of similar emotional extremes-- and quasi-religious themes-- on her third album as El Perro del Mar, From the Valley to the Stars (out now in Sweden, and coming to the U.S. in April on the Control Group), which suggests in its title both the deepest depths and the most exalted heights. On El Perro del Mar's self-titled 2006 breakthrough album, the agony rained down from Assbring's voice, contrasting exquisitely with the ecstatic Phil Spector-style production, sashaying girl-group rhythms, and songs about candy. Her latest leaves its ecstasy to uplifting lyrics and lets the vocals' agony seep into starker, sadder arrangements. The result is an album that's more conceptually unified than its predecessor and has its share of intimately compelling songs, but could also stand to give its misery a little more company. Last year, ex-Concretes singer Victoria Bergsman made her solo debut under the name Taken By Trees with an album that put Spectorian instrumental flourishes into the sparser vocabulary of melancholic folk-pop. Called Open Field, the introspective record found a barren, beautiful middle ground between El Perro del Mar's valley and stars. Here, Assbring sends out forlorn-sounding songs about hope, happiness, imagination, the sun, the time we have left, and other precious things from the place where prayers are usually cast aloft: a church. A church-ready organ underpins most of the songs on From the Valley to the Stars, and combined with mantra-like lyrics and choir-like harmonies, particularly on ""Happiness Won Me Over"", for a set of modern love songs. Strings, horns, some subdued drums, and a few times some jingling piano also round out the arrangements, and sly references to pop history (the jaunty ""Somebody's Baby"" finds joy where Jackson Browne found jealousy) still recur, but this time the effect isn't cinematic so much as ecclesiastical. Humble religiosity and downcast optimism resonate throughout the album, offering both love and music as redemption. Still, as on El Perro del Mar's previous outing, Assbring is at her best when her heart-wrenching songs can stand (or at least kneel) on their own. ""Glory to the World"" has the most in common with the smiling-through-tears pop that made the last record so endearing; Assbring's layered vocals bring us flowers and ambiguous glory as shrill woodwinds chirp over a descending organ progression. Slow, restrained first single ""How Did We Forget"" returns to the prior record's doo-wop feel. Despite the understated loveliness of Assbring's ""baby, baby""s, the track is an oddity on From the Valley to the Stars-- a song with lyrics as heartbroken as the music. Elsewhere,""You Can't Steal a Gift"" joins ""Somebody's Baby"" as a piano-based, (relatively) upbeat song giving a glimmer of hope that still sounds barely out of reach throughout most of the album. ""You just can't hide away,"" Assbring repeats, joined again by woodwinds and horns over organ triplets and walking piano bass notes. Repetition was a big part of El Perro del Mar, but on the new album, it's carried out to new lengths, not always rewardingly. Opener ""Do Not Despair"" finds reassurance in the stars, and its organ-- together with its subtle, optimistic wordplay, ""Today's gone to bed and tomorrow's unmade""-- gives the song a psalm-like resonance. ""To Give Love"" tries to extract maximal meaning out of its title's three words, straining against the bounds of language like classic Van Morrison: ""There's still time/ To give love, to give love, to give love, to give love, to give love."" But the wandering bells and synths of the title track and the wedding-recessional organ peals of ""Jubilee"" anchor songs slight enough to float away, while ""Inner Island"" admonishes us to hold onto the place inside where we'd escape as kids-- for four minutes. Instrumental ""Inside the Golden Egg"" and one-sentence ""The Sun Is an Old Friend"" come off as little more than fragments. If Taken By Trees' debut did spare yet Spector-informed depressive pop better than From the Valley to the Stars, then fellow Swedes Club 8's ""Jesus Walk With Me"" more effectively found religion. Relying on acoustic guitar arpeggios and plainspoken, communicative lyrics rather than vague repetitions, the song from last year's The Boy Who Couldn't Stop Dreaming found parallels between faith in God and faith in a lover, as Assbring's latest also does, and hit upon something poignant. From the Valley to the Stars has hills that rise close to El Perro del Mar's peaks, and its cohesive vision is a pleasure to behold. At the same time, though, it harps on its themes with an overzealous single-mindedness, occasionally letting flimsy stuff support an overarching conceit that requires foundations of marble. Or at least a really big old Italian ceiling and a whole lot of paint.","Sweden's El Perro del Mar follows her breakthrough with a more conceptually unified album, albeit one still built on ecstatic Phil Spector-style production and sashaying girl-group rhythms.

The Last Post,Carbon/Silicon,by: Stuart Berman,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b49d5e6ef95969322622/1:1/w_160/7db10db0.jpg,2008-02-26 06:00:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11164-the-last-post/,Carbon/Silicon,"Mick Jones doesn't really need to be making records in 2008. He could probably live the rest of his life off the radio residuals from ""Should I Stay or Should I Go"" alone, he already made the indie kids dance over 20 years ago with Big Audio Dynamite, and his suitably gritty production work on the Libertines' two albums should've satisfied any lingering, late-career urges to score cred points with the skinny-jeaned set. So it's encouraging to see the enthusiasm with which he's hurtled himself into his latest project, Carbon/Silicon, a prolific collaboration with Generation X's Tony James that's rooted in DIY principles both traditional (booking weekly residences at London pubs) and modern (releasing a steady stream of albums and EPs through free downloads on their website). With the two principals evenly sharing the songwriting and vocal duties, Carbon/Silicon resemble a sort of pared-down Travelling Wilburys for the class-of-77 set: A good-natured get-together of old mates who seem happy to play purely for the pleasure of one another's company. Which isn't to suggest the two are eager to shut out the world around them. Their chosen Carbon/Silicon moniker can be interpreted as a response to a world overrun with pollution and plastic, and The Last Post-- comprised mostly of re-recordings from the band's web-only releases-- touches on all the Big Issues (the Iraq war, terrorism, materialism) with news-ticker efficiency and expediency. But the overall attitude of the album is not one of anger so much as shrugged-shoulder bemusement, perhaps resulting from the fact that the modern world looks no more sane or dignified than the garbage-strewn London streets that spawned Jones and James' former bands. You can hear their sardonic detachment simmering underneath the up-with-people exuberance of opener ""The News"", in which Jones fires off a laundry list of utopian ideals-- ""people started caring about what they eat/ and people started smiling at everyone they meet""-- while the song's ringing, repetitive guitar riff and sprightly rhythm coat the lyrics in a synthetic sheen that underscores their inherent, pipe-dream fallacy. But this surface simplicity exposes both Carbon/Silicon's charms and their limitations. The band may have evolved from a two-man team to a full four-piece band, but the recordings still possess a demo-like quality-- not in the raw, primal sense, but rather what sounds like home-computer-generated blueprints begging for embellishments that never come. The grinding riffs and metronomic drum tracks pretty much map out entire song structures within the first 10 seconds, with verses and choruses often following the same melody line (see: the ersatz Oasis of ""Tell it Like It Is""). The result is a sometimes awkward disconnect between intent and execution: with its descending central riff, agit-folk sloganeering (""what they're trying to sell us is really just a con"") and immediate, anthemic chorus, you can't help but wonder how exciting centerpiece track ""War on Culture"" would've sounded had Jones or James recorded it 30 years ago; instead, it exists today as an amiable mid-tempo chugger that cruises along for six minutes without ever really accruing any of the fury seeping out of the lyric sheet. So with the parameters so rigidly defined, success boils down to the spirit of the performances: James' ""Magic Suitcase"" recasts its disarming images of airport security and concealed bombs into an enchanting bit of Robyn Hitchcockian psych-pop whimsy, while the fetching ""National Anthem"" sublimates T. Rex's ""Bang a Gong"" groove into a sly, soul strut. But within The Last Post's stately surroundings, it follows that the most invigorating song is also its silliest: a ""Clash City Rockers"" redux called ""What the Fuck"". Jones may be stretching things a touch when he links the title's punk-perfect sentiment with the existential angst of Fyodor Dostoevsky, but the song marks the rare moment where Carbon/Silicon sound like a product of ""Garageland"" rather than GarageBand.","Mick Jones and Tony James team for a prolific project rooted in DIY principles both traditional (booking weekly residences at London pubs) and modern (releasing a steady stream of albums and EPs through free downloads on their website).

Glory Hope Mountain,The Acorn,by: Eric Harvey,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b4b2c0084474cd0c22f8/1:1/w_160/92447f41.jpg,2008-02-26 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11182-glory-hope-mountain/,Paper Bag,"Ever since people began to appreciate the world around them, storytellers have represented the natural world through the ""mother"" metaphor. Glory Hope Mountain, the title of the debut LP from Ottawa's the Acorn, is a loose translation of Gloria Esperanza Montoya, the given name of group-leader Rolf Klausener's mother. In a touching, symbolic representation of her life as told to her son, these songs are Klausener's own reinscription of his mother's life story onto the landscape that helped shape it. Mountain's lyrics are rife with anthropomorphic surroundings-- ""mounatins like diaphragms,"" ""scenery painted by brushes of hair,"" ""a landscape that is breathing,"" ""the heavy clouds that crowd your head""-- and maps made of stars and rivers, binding the journey it chronicles with the earth that facilitates it. Mountain came together in a manner similar to the Fiery Furnaces' own oral-history project with their grandmother, Rehearsing My Choir: Klausener recorded a series of lengthy conversations with his mother-- about her childhood escape from a troubled, abusive environment in Honduras, and journey north to Canada, where she re-settled, married, and had a son-- and set them to music. Where Mountain parts formally from Choir, however, is in the details-- or more specifically, the lack thereof. The album is dedicated, through a small mention in the lower right corner of the liner notes, to Montoya, but the only time we hear her actual voice is on ""Sister Margaret"", as it bookends a wistful piano and lapsteel instrumental. Specific references are dotted throughout, but Mountain is no biography. Instead, Klausener crafts from her stories an allegorical narrative of strength, perserverence, love, and redemption. The record has some ethnomusicological underpinnings: While writing it, Klausener researched Honduran indigenous music, which has connections to the West African roots of many of its practicioners, but stopped short of replicating it outright, preferring to learn from its rhythmic pecularities and translate them to his own folk-collective worldview. ""Crooked Legs"" is easily the best example of the band's strengths; a melodic hodgepodge of brass, rumbling drums, intricately plucked guitars, and Klausener's plangent vocal melody do more than their parts to propel a charming, inspirational lyric. Elsewhere, the group (five core members and a dozen or so hired hands) avoids generic world-music traps, using dynamic shifts and evocative instrumentation to forward the narrative: ""Hold Your Breath"", for instance, opens the record-as-journey by replicating the quiet of a nighttime escape before expanding into a jammy coda of sun-soaked freedom and the wonder of the natural world, seguing into the tribal percussion and chanting of the dramatic ""Flood Pt. 1"". Maybe appropriately for an album devoted to finding one's way through unknown territories, there are times when Klausener's muse wanders. His drive to globalize musically pays off more often than not, but in terms of sentiment, he occasionally catches himself in thickets. Declarations like ""my blood runs through your heart with every beat,"" which echo throughout, are touching if not a touch hokey and simple, while a line like ""whitewashing avenues of our widening disparities"" veers off too far in the other direction, trying for highminded poetry but landing in the purgatory of the too-wordy. A concentration on the intricacies of Klausener's own verbiage raises a final, fleeting, and speculative question, however: How much is lost when Montoya's story is shook down to a series of pretty, impressionistic renderings? It's nice to approach Mountain in the manner of any sentimental gift from a son to his mother, but in terms of its circulation outside the two of them might we be equally enlightened by, say, her actual words? That first lyric, though, functions as Mountain's solemn conclusion, to the song ""Lullabye (Mountain)"", which affirms Klausener's own recognition of the inevitable course that life takes. Regardless of what happens between birth and death, all stories must eventually conclude, and those endings so often mirror the beginnings.","In a touching, highly symbolic gesture, this collection of indie rock songs is Acorn leader Rolf Klausener's interpretation of his mother's life reinscripted onto the landscape that helped shape it.

David Thomas Broughton vs. 7 Hertz,David Thomas Broughton7 Hertz,by: Amy Granzin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b495b1335d7bf169a782/1:1/w_160/a4789f3b.jpg,2008-02-26 06:00:03,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11157-david-thomas-broughton-vs-7-hertz/,Acuarela,"It took time for 2005's low-flying The Complete Guide to Insufficiency to penetrate even fringe-folk's radar. But many who now know it consider David Thomas Broughton's gutting first LP a minor masterpiece. Notorious for lines like, ""I wouldn't take her to execution/ I wouldn't take her to a live sex show/ I wouldn't piss or shit on her would I/ Because I love her so,"" the album paces the vague, uneasy borderlands between horror and comedy, danger and play, reality and performance. Just as arresting as his narratives of murder, dismemberment, rape, suicide, and other themes more typical to Norwegian death metal bands than polite singer-songwriters are Broughton's thick and knotty ropes of sound-- his quavering wounded-beast baritone woven with guitar and ambient noise loops. David Thomas Broughton vs. 7 Hertz is the London-based musician's first major, or majorish (even though it exceeds an hour, Spanish label Acuarela is marketing it as a mini-album), release of new material since then. Like Complete Guide, vs. 7 Hertz memorializes in five tracks a largely improvised live performance, with minimal post-production mop-up. Supported-- perhaps I should say goaded-- by Leeds chamber quintet 7 Hertz, Broughton notches up the noise and maximizes the meander. So this probably won't be the record that wins the unconverted. Still, there's plenty here for Broughton faithful. ""Weight of My Love"", with its desperation, plain-cloth melody, and archaic syntax (""I dig you a grave for to sleep, my love""), draws on ancient murder balladry while voicing the sharp and specific woes-- too skint to afford a pasty from the corner shop or transport to Leeds-- of contemporary Britain's margin-dwellers. ""River Outlet"" is a mesmerizing 22-minute meditation on memory and loss, and ""Fisted Hand"" is disconcertingly lovely as it swathes violence in tender string-plucks and lilting melody. Despite its pugilistic title, any implied opposition between the folkie and classically schooled combo proves a feint. Broughton's amalgam of Northern soul, Faheyesque blues, pastoral folk, and machine manipulation pairs surprisingly well with 7 Hertz's classical-jazz-experimental palette, and the ad-hoc band seems unanimously committed to the aesthetics of chance and privileging of process over product. Compositional free-form occasionally, as in ""No Great Shakes"", finds Broughton awkwardly bumping elbows with 7 Hertz. And ""Hands""'s spitting amp is more annoying than conceptually provocative. But the spontaneous arrangements usually work. Rusty violins saw and a double bass pecks at ""Weight""'s simple reiterated chord progression, building to a combustible convergence of scribbled strings and lowing clarinet. ""River""'s sampled fret squeaks chirp like sonar signals and loop, unnervingly, like hungry sharks, so when the track finally erupts into a hysteria of noise, it's the only satisfying resolution. At just over a minute, ""Jolly (Interlude)"" seems like a spell-breaking joke, a crude rebuttal to anyone who'd assert that the guy never lightens up. But it's actually integral to vs. 7 Hertz and any complex understanding of Broughton-- whose maudlin vibrato always holds a hint of perverse humor and whose stage manner reportedly swerves from downcast to slapstick. ""Jolly"" signals, if it weren't already apparent, that Broughton isn't going to provide emotional shortcuts for his audience.","Supported by Leeds chamber quintet 7 Hertz, singer-songwriter Broughton notches up the noise and maximizes the meander, blending Northern soul, Faheyesque blues, pastoral folk, and machine manipulation.

Safe & Sound,Justus Köhncke,by: Mark Pytlik,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b4d0b1335d7bf169a7e1/1:1/w_160/2b795444.jpg,2008-02-26 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11209-safe-sound/,Kompakt,"Even on a label dominated by techno-pop fetishists, gushy romantics, and campy sentimentalists, it doesn't take a giant leap of imagination to picture Justus Köhncke as Kompakt's resident odd man out. A meandering blend of naval-gazing techno, burlesque pop, and German-accented disco, his 2002 debut Was Ist Musik was a sometimes difficult record that felt like a private, closed-door articulation of the same sensibility his labelmates were dutifully trying to popularize at the time. Since then, Köhncke has gone on to enjoy his fair share of commercial high points as well (most notably with 2004's still pretty brilliant ""Timecode"", easily his defining single), but his seeming refusal to elaborate further on any of those singular moments paints a picture of an artist for whom success is more often than not accidental. While Safe & Sound marks Köhncke's first full-length since 2005's Doppelleben, there's nothing celebratory or assertive about his return. If anything, S&S is a bloody-mindedly unassuming record; it's almost as if Köhncke made a conscious decision to fly low. With the exception of the spangly ""Parage"", one of the album's pastichey highlights, and the shimmering ""Molybdan"", Köhncke's trance-inflected revisiting of ""Timecode""'s tick-tocking rhythms, everything on Safe & Sound lingers shyly in the mid-tempo range, much of it threatening to lift off but never leaving the ground. Those without much patience for Köhncke's hit-and-miss predilection for kitsch German-sung pop will be pleased to know that, having recently completed a string of Iggy Pop and Velvet Underground covers under the pseudonym Kinky Justice, he's completely done away with the on-album vocal sidebars. In their absence, though, his productions seem to have taken a more conversational tone. Gone is the sleek, streamlined retro disco that categorized a lot of Doppelleben; the pulse on Safe & Sound is much more finely rendered, its level of detail and gristle implying a sturdy reverence for early 1990s techno. In fact, from the skittering patterns and analog synth washes of opener ""Yacht"" (which rests on a tantalizing sliver of Grace Jones' ""Slave To The Rhythm"") to the chattering, almost industrial rhythms of the dark and metallic ""$26"" to the lumbering album closer and title track, Safe & Sound's most recurring touchpoint is probably early IDM. Of course, this being Köhncke, the quiet skill and confidence with which it's all assembled is hard to deny. Even more so than with his previous outings, there's a subtle craft and a generosity of at the heart of Safe & Sound that emerges with repeated listens. As evidenced by the album's centerpiece, a buzzing cover of Michael Rother's (Kraftwerk, Neu!, Harmonia) ""Feuerland"", this is very much a producer's record. With its refined palette of sounds, sonic textures, and subtle melodic hooks, it's an easy enough record to like. Nonetheless, those who were hoping for an album full of the slow-burning disco that Köhncke has proven such a skill for in the past might come away feeling a little underwhelmed. But I suppose that's part of the deal with any Köhncke record; the man has such a wide array of tastes and influences that some are always going to be left undeveloped.","On the Kompakt-associated producer's first full-length since 2005's Doppelleben, there's nothing especially celebratory or assertive going on; it's almost as if Köhncke made a conscious decision to fly low.

Devotion,Beach House,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b4cf13d197565213ab80/1:1/w_160/58f96b36.jpg,2008-02-26 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11208-devotion/,Bella UnionCarpark,"Baltimore is as musically diverse as anywhere else, but in 2008, indie rockers associate the city with colorful, energetic music, from the expatriated Animal Collective to Dan Deacon's Wham City crew. The music of Beach House, the Baltimore-based duo of multi-instrumentalist Alex Scally and vocalist/organist Victoria Legrand, is a shadow narrative running parallel to this trend: Their delicate, lovelorn pop comes in the form of deathly waltzes and dark pastoral dirges on which Legrand sings about desire, loss, and dreams as if telling a ghost story, splitting the difference between lovely and creepy. For pristine pop, Beach House's self-titled 2006 debut was awfully raw: Legrand downplayed her classical piano and voice training in a humble negation of virtuosity. The organs sounded like something thick and coarse being pulled through a small, jagged opening; chord structures were simply suggestions; imperfections were kept intact. That balance of beauty and imprecision made inspired songs like ""Saltwater"", ""Tokyo Witch"", ""Apple Orchard"", and ""Master of None"" easy to fall in love with. The duo's songwriting hasn't fundamentally changed on Devotion; they've simply cleaned up their act. These are crisper, brighter, bolder songs, retaining Beach House's sense of elegant decay while sweeping up the debris. ""Gila"" is a funeral on a sunny day; its shimmering organs are controlled, never bleeding chaotically as they did on the debut, and are complemented by frilly but steadfast guitar. ""Turtle Island"" reaffirms Beach House's preference for simple, skeletal percussion, but its dense melody is a marked advancement. The result of this pre-spring cleaning is that Devotion lacks some of the immediate highs of the first album-- you no longer get the sense of rooting for an embattled underdog-- but winds up consistently stronger. Even though it's tidier and more streamlined, the music surrenders none of its autumnal charm, and there's still a sense of eavesdropping on a private, ongoing dialogue between Legrand and a ghost. Of course, we only get to hear her side of the story. As on the first album, which began with the words ""Love you all the time, even though you're not mine,"" she favors second-person assertions that speak of self-effacement, dependence, and sinister dream-world conversations. ""Your wish is my command,"" she intones on ""Wedding Bell"", becoming a genie in a puff of smoke. And on ""Gila"", she sings in a world-weary wheeze, ""Man, you've got a lot of jokes to tell."" But instead of the punch line, we get the sort of jarring shift that characterizes dreams: ""So you throw your baby's banners down the well."" ""Invite your sister into the garden,"" she drones on the wind-up waltz ""You Came to Me"", concurrently inviting us into the murky depths of her romantic consciousness. There's a sense of latent danger in the invitation, like a siren song luring us toward sharp clusters of rock. Portals into mysterious spaces pockmark Devotion; none of them promise a way out. Perhaps this explains why an album that takes its title and concept from a superficially sweet concept has such a subtle bite: Legrand's devotion is a dungeon into which she tosses her own desires like coins into a wishing well, a one-way conduit from which only echoes return.","Beach House's songwriting hasn't fundamentally changed on their second record; they've simply cleaned up their sound, resulting in crisper, brighter, bolder songs that retain the Baltimore dream-pop duo's melodic sense and vibe of elegant decay.

The Sky Behind the Sea,Mike Bones,by: Andrew Gaerig,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b4a2b1335d7bf169a795/1:1/w_160/ac86fb0f.jpg,2008-02-25 06:00:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11168-the-sky-behind-the-sea/,Social Registry,"As anyone who's ever addressed an audience over a PA or listened to their own voicemail message knows, the recorded voice reverberates differently outside of one's own head. Listening to Mike Bones' (née Strallow) voice on his debut album, The Sky Behind the Sea, is a lot like hearing your own through a set of speakers; the experience is disarming, odd, and above all sort of unpleasant. This is not to say that Strallow is a bad singer-- he doesn't sing off-key or lose breath, and indeed, a limited-run 2007 live show suggests that his pipes hold up better in a club-- just one whose voice never quite shakes that alienating feeling of hearing something unexpected for the first time. It's like he's trying to sing like Hank Williams, or maybe trying hard not to. It's a sensation that colors all of The Sky Behind the Sea, Strallow's debut as a singer and songwriter. To learn that Strallow actually made his name as a guitarist on New York's underground circuit-- he has backed Damon McMahon and Lizzy Trulie and plays with members of Oneida and Oakley Hall-- is like that time everyone told you Jeff Buckley's Grace was one of the best guitar albums of the 90s. Really? The insistent emphasis on Strallow's voice throughout The Sky-- only ""Town Crier"" makes an attempt to shift weight to the arrangement-- seems like a willful subordination of talent. When he steamrolls the final minute of ""Pope John Paul"" with rough distortion or disrupts the middle of ""Love's Not Yours"", his fingers expose a flare and complexity that his lumpy verses rarely achieve. The Sky's eight songs are almost relentlessly tuneless and dour. If Strallow has a sense of humor or lightness-- a clever song title like ""The Enemies of My Enemies Hate Me Too"" suggests he might-- he rarely exposes it. Even ""Enemies"" loses its wry punch when you realize that it's quite literally a tale of spiteful persecution (""They would not let me be/ They took all I had from me and left me desired and diseased""). Strallow occasionally offers a strong image-- during ""Do You Wish I Left?"" he mutters ""I don't want what I came here for/ Still I beat my knuckles upon his door""-- but too much of The Sky is a self-serious stew. When Strallow does break the mold, you wish he hadn't: the album's most memorable line bookends ""Pope John Paul"", ""Pope John Paul/ You're my man and all/ But you wasn't always fair"". Strallow's most obvious sonic parallel is Leonard Cohen (even on the outliers: compare ""Town Crier"" to ""First We Take Manhattan""), and like a Cohen album, The Sky contains quiet, woven arrangements subservient to their bandleader's maundering. Strallow's voice, odd though it may be, never growls or whispers or contorts. Instead, he hangs in the air, humidly, casting himself over every moment of The Sky, save those rare occasions when he allows his guitar to speak for him; Strallow can only wonder at his instrument's articulation and passion.","He's made a name as a guitarist, backing Damon McMahon and Lizzy Trulie and playing with members of Oneida and Oakley Hall, but here Bones tries his hand as a singer-songwriter with decidedly mixed results.

Unfamiliar Faces,Matt Costa,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b4909d034d5c69bf4eb1/1:1/w_160/a000ba10.jpg,2008-02-25 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11154-unfamiliar-faces/,Brushfire,"Whether it's the jaunty player piano that kicks things off, Matt Costa's over-syllabified singing of the title, or just due diligence on his bio, there's plenty of ways one can deduce that ""Mr. Pitiful"", the first single from Unfamiliar Faces, is not autobiographical. Indeed, it's a send-up of an upwardly mobile peer that implies that Costa's been listening to the National recently. But while the latter's ascendance has coincided with their increased willingness to empathize rather than accuse, as a kid from Huntington Beach barely in his mid-20s, Costa just kinda sounds like a dick-- ""I hope you see through your big yard and white picket fence...don't make me feel bad that we're still friends."" So if Costa makes it appear that home-ownership is the realm of true squares, it's easy to chalk it up as a collateral effect of trusting your major label debut to the hands of Jack Johnson (who released Unfamiliar Faces on his Brushfire imprint) and producer Tom Dumont (clearly with some time on his hands, post-No Doubt). I'd imagine most people reading this actively loathe Johnson not so much for his music, innocuous to the point of invisibility, but for a McConaughey-esque ascription to carefree living that is feasible only after achieving massive success; paradoxically suggesting money can buy happiness. And as was the case with Rogue Wave's most recent album, as well as Johnson's, the holistic vibe undermines just about any chance Costa has of showing a dark side or artistic unrest, leaving mostly a chamber-singer/songwriter record for people who think Kelley Stoltz is too edgy or are scared that Sondre Lerche might not speak English. Certainly there's more to Costa than a one-man acoustical jam, even if his pleasure zone isn't far from the AM Gold dial. ""Lilacs"" evidences a proclivity for psych-tinged lyrics (""I choked on your kaleidoscope""), and I won't even knock its frothy David Gray guitar strum; the track itself sorta outstays its welcome. There's plenty of nice production touches from Dumont, like the acid-washed backing vocals of the title track and the Stephen Street-tipping tones of ""Vienna"". But when Costa tries to convincingly ply his ""hypochondriac blues"" on ""Emergency Call"", he's clashing with overly peppy horn charts. And then there are the times when Costa's got no one to blame but himself: ""Cigarette Eyes"" hosts one of the more baffling metaphors this side of Tom McRae and has an undercurrent of domestic violence, but Costa slowly lets the air out with a chord progression too ambitious for his melodic sense and an unrealistic Brit affectation. It's unfair to write off these guys completely considering Radiohead is signed to a label that owes its creation to Dave Matthews. But thus far, Brushfire (whether intentionally or not) is keeping their artists on a tight leash. Whatever Costa is attempting to convey in ""Trying To Lose My Mind"", it gets lost in a Johnson-worthy platitude: ""Put it in a song and I know we can get along."" But when ""Miss Magnolia"" tries its hand at applying that philosophy to a Grateful Dead tribute, it ends up sounding way too much like Mungo Jerry to be unintentional. Really, in the way that Johnson embodies the Hawaiian lifestyle, Costa reps for Huntington Beach-- an archly conservative dreamland that most of its residents secretly wish they could leave.","Huntington Beach singer-songwriter's second full-length finds him on Jack Johnson's Brushfire label.

Daxaar,Steve Reid Ensemble,by: Grayson Currin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b48eb1335d7bf169a778/1:1/w_160/40aea722.jpg,2008-02-25 06:00:03,Jazz,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11151-daxaar/,Domino,"Whether talking Jandek or Albert Ayler or La Monte Young, some musicians-- even if their work is inventive and perhaps revolutionary-- owe their reputations-at-large to public personality. Jandek, the recluse; Ayler, the firebrand; Young, the hoarder: These musicians have calling cards somewhat removed from their art. You don't have to know their music to know their personas. If you've heard the name Steve Reid at all, his story is probably familiar: Berry Gordy paid him $75 in the early 1960s to play drums on Martha and the Vandellas' ""Dancing in the Street""; he gigged regularly at the Apollo; he drummed his way through college; he moved to Africa, working with Guy Warren and Fela Kuti; he was arrested for draft-dodging back in America; he recorded and toured with Sun Ra and Miles Davis; now 64, he's recorded four albums with Kieran ""Four Tet"" Hebden since 2005. What's more, the liner notes for both of Reid's albums with the Steve Reid Ensemble have included breathless writing by BBC Radio 1 DJ Gilles Peterson: 2005's Spirit Walk used a long-form interview with questions and answers about Africa, influences, and adolescence; this year's Daxaar-- captured last January during Reid's first trip back to Africa in four decades-- includes a Peterson essay that reads, ""For Steve Reid to return to the home of the drums... was a natural trip.... If the quest is to 'keep in the rhythm' then Steve Reid is The Man and Daxaar is the lick."" Lucky for us, the music on Daxaar's not bad, either: Recorded by a septet that recalls only Hebden and keyboardist/music director Boris Netsvetaev from the octet that made Spirit Walk, Daxaar uses Reid's tight, steady grooves like loam. The band's textural nuances and unorthodox solos spring above his traps, but they always trace back to the rhythms, acknowledging the fecundity of the soil beneath. The trumpet of Roger Ongolo and the guitar of Jimi Mbaye, for instance, weave through the hi-hat tap of ""Dabronxxar"", slipping into and stepping out of the rhythm, emphasizing its tiny waves. And on closer ""Don't Look Back"", everything funnels into the groove one layer at the time-- bass, electronics, drums, keys. Again, the guitar and trumpet lock around that meter, darting between its cracks. All five tracks operate under the same premise: Let the rhythm be the foundation, and surprises will surface. That principle has been evident in Reid's work since 1975's excellent Rhythmatism. The outlier, though, is the disc's intro, performed solo by singer and kora player Isa Kouyate: Titled ""Welcome"", it's a prelude that functions like a string section opening a black metal album or a well-placed skit opening a hip-hop album: Except for fundamental ideas, it has little to do with the nearly familiar jazz that follows. It's only an invocation opening the curtains on the homecoming, the communion, the recontextualization. ""Welcome"" is such a successful gambit because, for the rest of the record, Reid and his four-sevenths-native band don't emphasize region or sentiment. Aside from an African-American émigré living in Switzerland returning to Africa with an English electronicist and a Russian keyboardist, there's no agenda in the music they're making. Instead, Reid coasts with his crash and ride, leaning forward against the beat on the title track, as Netsvetaev builds wide organ arches. Khadim Badji's hand drums complement Reid's stick-and-metal lead, and bassist Dembel Diop lopes around the basic rhythm, always pulling on it or pushing against it with a brilliant, buxom tone. Hebden sparkles with some of his best moments in his prolific if patchwork collaboration with Reid. His young mercury has hamstrung his duo records with Reid, although he's excellent at identifying interesting sounds and tinkering with them: Here, as he's often done as Four Tet and on last year's Fire Escape with Sunburned Hand of the Man, he's content to play that role. Hebden accents and warps but doesn't define. No one else does, either: Taken as a whole, Daxaar is fun if somewhat static. Spirit Walk was an essential listen, its hymns to heroes and its huge, charging arrangements signaling Reid's renewal and new status with force. Daxaar, then, is the other side of the picture-- a lot more comfortable, a little more nuanced, a bit too stable. But, again, Steve Reid is 64, and this jazz is far outside of the supper club. And it gets by on more than its backstory.","The prolific and versatile drummer's latest finds him returning to Africa for the first time in four decades to work with a band that includes Senegalese guitarist Jimi Mbaye and frequent Reid collaborator Kieren Hebden of Four Tet.

Living Bridge,Various Artists,by: Marc Masters,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b4bfea9e61561daa6cce/1:1/w_160/f727e558.jpg,2008-02-25 06:00:02,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11194-living-bridge/,Rare Book Room,"For over a decade, Nicolas Vernhes has brought a seemingly infinite amount of indie bands to his Rare Book Room studio. So it makes sense that Vernhes chose to inaugurate his new label with a compilation of groups recorded in his Brooklyn lair. The surprise with Living Bridge is how cohesive and consistent it is. Whether it's Vernhes' production, the groups' stylistic overlaps, or simply the high quality of the music, something makes this 25-track, 2xCD collection sound more like an album than any compilation should rightly be expected to. Vernhes creates Living Bridge's flow by mixing the songs roughly like a DJ (as he told Pitchfork in January, he ""made sure to record extended intros and outros so the songs merge together into one long, but indexed, piece of music""). But that approach would be just a gimmick were the songs not so congruous, so alike in tone and mood. It might be hard to imagine Black Dice and Tara Jane O'Neil sounding similar, and no one will mistake the former's throbbing bleeps for the latter's soft musings. But both of their contributions possess a subtlety and restraint that runs throughout the majority of Living Bridge. That common feel is strongest on disc one, which progresses almost seamlessly. The loping hum of Telepathe's ""I Cant' Stand It"" climbs to a shoegaze pitch, which melts nicely into Palms' minimal trance ""Der Koening"". Later, Blood on the Wall adorn a simple bass line with the haunting chill of EVOL-era Sonic Youth, a vibe that perks up in Silver Jews' aching melodies, then rises into Charles Gansa's piano-driven croon. The peak of all this building intoxication is Samara Lubelski's ""Ego Blossoms"". Diverging from the version found on her recent Parallel Suns album, it forgoes percussion for layers of mesmerizing keyboards. Disc two continues that aura, opening with the a cappella freeze of Theo Angell, the clipped hooks of Rings, and the airy pop of Deerhunter. But the remainder doesn't catch quite the atmosphere of disc one. The moods are less consistent, and Vernhes' transitions aren't as effective. But the music is still pretty good, from Enon's pulsing new wave to John Wolfington's majestic melody to Sam Jayne's Malkmus-like sway. Only after Jayne's cut does Living Bridge falter, finishing with generic punk, synth-pop, and painfully-bad soft-rock that would embarrass even Journey, by someone called the Jewish. Still, on the whole, Living Bridge is so strong that it's tempting to draw overreaching conclusions-- that this represents the most interesting indie rock around, or that it proves that sonically less is more, or that it's a model for compilations that hope to be more than just a highlight reel. But like any good album, Living Bridge is valuable primarily as an aesthetic experience, its music a stronger statement than any thesis one might try to impose on it.","Rare Book Room studio head Nicolas Vernhes inaugurates his new label with a compilation of groups recorded in his Brooklyn lair. The roster reads like a leftfield indie all-star team-- among those contributing songs are Avey Tare, Silver Jews, Black Dice, Deerhunter, Enon, Blood on the Wall, Fischerspooner, and Telepathe.

Seventh Tree,Goldfrapp,by: Nate Patrin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b46fb1335d7bf169a751/1:1/w_160/902502e7.jpg,2008-02-25 06:00:01,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11128-seventh-tree/,Mute,"One thing writers often don't give musicians enough credit for is the rationale for their restlessness. If a well-known pop artist alters their style-- especially if it deviates from a sound that made them a commercial success-- there's often this urge to label the musician as bored and impulsive, chasing new trends or jumping off bandwagons as if holding off stagnancy is their only motivation to test their creativity. It can be upsetting to longtime fans, but often times the only real hurdle to these new directions is unfamiliarity-- just look at Goldfrapp, who startled their earliest fans by shifting from the surrealistic elegance of their 2000 orchestral-pop debut Felt Mountain to a beat-heavy mid-decade run at the dance charts. With two hard-to-top electro-pop albums under their belts-- 2003's Black Cherry and 2005's Supernature-- it's safe to assume that Alison Goldfrapp and Will Gregory are perfectly happy with getting some closure on what they've accomplished in the last few years and are moving on to something else out of a feeling more substantial than impatience. It was unprecedented enough that a group which started out trafficking in cabaret eeriness and cinematic grandiosity would ease so naturally into club-pop, so it's not out of the question that dialing back to pastoral, folksy indie-electronica would unearth another side of a duo that was shaping up to be one of the decade's most versatile. So how could a group that's already established success with slow, lush ballads-- think 2000's ""Pilots"", 2003's ""Forever"", or 2005's ""You Never Know""-- release an album filled with a whole bunch of uncompelling attempts at them? It could be because Goldfrapp's best songs, regardless of how downbeat they were, at least had something to grab the ear melodically, where most of the material on Seventh Tree focuses more on subtle, slow-moving ambience. This ambience is often so subtle and slow-moving it doesn't seem to go anywhere, and it coasts on some frothy sense of pleasantness that evaporates the moment the song ends. Like the bulk of the album, there's a certain beauty in opener ""Clowns"", but it's an empty one-- more lullaby than pop song, it's symptomatic of what happens when you take all the grandeur out of big sweeping melodies. Other songs attempt to use these flimsy backdrops to build up to big, epic crescendos-- the Nick Mason drums cutting into the narcoleptic Air-circa-Virgin Suicides swoon in ""Little Bird""; the latter-day Moby bombast that rears its head in the second half of ""A&E""'s Sarah McLachlan-isms-- and it feels false and gratuitous, as if it were the only way to maintain any actual momentum. At its best-- the desolation of ""Cologne Cerrone Houdini"" and ""Some People"", which inject the ambience with a much-needed eeriness-- this stuff's fairly soothing; at its worst it evokes that old ""Mystery Science Theater 3000"" bit about the two-note chords of New Age music: ""Put your finger down here...now put another finger down...now hold it down for an hour...now hold it down 'til you get a record contract from Windham Hill."" At least ""Caravan Girl"" provides a nice, upbeat Neu!-meets-ABBA distraction, but it's too little too late. All of Gregory's codeine melodies would be a lot more salvageable, however, if Alison undercut it with the trademark strengths of her voice. It's what made the Marlene Dietrich mood of Felt Mountain so intriguingly weird, while Black Cherry and Supernature would have simply been slightly-above-par electro-glam ephemera without her Kylie-gone-sinister purr. But she's not assertive or seductive or mysterious here; what she's offering is the kind of mannered, chirpy delicacy you could get from any number of indie-folk and adult contemporary artists piped through off-brand coffeehouses everywhere. There's still some interesting dissonance in hearing this fragile version of Goldfrapp's voice wrap around lyrics that occasionally match the ominous nature of her older songs; ""A&E"", shallow as it sounds, hints at a pill overdose. But with all the excitement and decadence drained out of the music and the voice, the trite themes stand out a bit more clearly: you can be happy if you give money to people who promise to make your life better (""Happiness""); birds have wings and are free (""Little Bird""). That's assuming you can understand Goldfrapp's lyrics in the first place, since she mumbles incoherently and is muffled under a swampy mix through half the record, which only highlights the feeling of sleepy halfheartedness. Even if Seventh Tree is sonic dishwater, I'll give Goldfrapp enough credit to assume that this isn't change for its own sake, that the motivation for this album's tone wasn't simply a fatigued boredom with their old sound. It's just too bad most listeners won't be able to say the same about their own reactions to this new one.","After two albums of fantastic club-pop, the versatile UK duo dial back to a pastoral, folksy indie-electronica sound.

Trinity Revisited,Cowboy Junkies,by: Stephen M.

The ambient buzz of Toronto's Church of the Holy Trinity, where the Junkies recorded the album around one microphone, colors every song, reinforcing the live setting and generating vinyl intimacy even on CD. It's as if the church itself was an instrument, one that Junkies could play pretty well. It allows Margo Timmins' voice to fill your field of vision, simultaneously soothing and unsettling, while her brother Michael's guitar rumbles through the songs, a little louder and sharper than anticipated. In 1988, The Trinity Sessions sounded old but felt new, a sensation amplified by the liberties they took with cover songs. The Junkies brought out the danger of Hank Williams' ""I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry"" and Patsy Cline's ""Walking After Midnight"", which echo each other creepily. They rewrote ""Blue Moon"" as a paean to Elvis, and their slowed-down ""Sweet Jane"", endorsed by Lou Reed himself, remains one of the best Velvet Underground covers put to tape. Two decades later, instead of releasing the expected 2xCD special edition with dry liner notes arguing for the band's impact on, say, the next decade's alt-country movement, the Junkies came up with a different way to celebrate the anniversary of their breakthrough. The band, whose line-up hasn't changed since then, returned to the Church of the Holy Trinity and re-recorded The Trinity Sessions song by song. There were rules, of course. To capture the loose spirit of the originals, they held few rehearsals, allowed themselves only one day to record, and again played live in the round. On the other hand, they used much more sophisticated equipment; invited Ryan Adams, Vic Chesnutt, Natalie Merchant, and multi-instrumentalist Jeff Bird to play along; and had the performance filmed. The performance has been released on CD/DVD as Trinity Revisited, and it is certainly an odd product-- redundant to anyone familiar with The Trinity Sessions and unconvincing to everyone else. This isn't a reinterpretation, but a re-enactment. The Junkies run through songs almost note for note, and when they go off-script, as on the overly dramatic reading of ""Sweet Jane"", they display only their limitations. The Junkies don't really jam, nor do they do noise very well. Thank God for Vic Chesnutt, whose idiosyncratic phrasing and ghostly moans add new twists to ""Blue Moon Revisited"" and ""Postcard Blues"", as if he's been singing along to them for years. Ryan ""Bedhead"" Adams fares nearly as well, turning ""200 More Miles"" into a rolling trucker's anthem. Unfortunately, Natalie Merchant's presence, as always, is overly somber, especially on ""Misguided Angel"". At no point in her career has she ever mustered the sexuality needed to convey the song's conflicted desires. What is perhaps most disappointing is that the gentle irreverence of the original, which had the temerity to take liberties with traditional blues and country, has been commemorated with such a respectful performance. Covering their own originals or covering themselves covering others' songs, the Junkies surrender fully to their own history, adding nothing to songs they once proved could always be newly reimagined. Amid all the back-patting, the lo-fi sound that so distinguished The Trinity Sessions is lost completely, and the church becomes nothing more than a pretty backdrop. The worst I can say for Trinity Revisited is that it sounds utterly placeless; the best I can say is that it made me dig out my old copy of The Trinity Sessions and give it another spin.","Instead of releasing the expected 2xCD special edition, the Cowboy Junkies celebrate their breakthrough album by re-recording it song by song in the same location in which it was originally created.

In Her Gentle Jaws,The Depreciation Guild,by: Adam Moerder,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b483ea9e61561daa6c76/1:1/w_160/79f40dd7.gif,2008-02-22 06:00:04,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11143-in-her-gentle-jaws/,self-released,"Wielding a blocky 8-bit arsenal, the Depreciation Guild's more likely to attract attention from video game blogs than music publications. Considering the tacky rep the video game aesthetic carries in indie circles, this doesn't seem like such an unfair relegation for the Brooklyn duo. However, as the Nintendo generation continues producing new bands-- especially those who know no world before the Famicom system-- the use of these 8-bit blips doesn't smack so strongly of nostalgic novelty so much as it represents an integral musical element in these people's lives. In that vein, the Guild's debut In Her Gentle Jaws sticks its neck out further than Nintendocore staples like the Advantage or Minibosses, never resorting to tongue-in-cheekery while decorating its original compositions in NES furnishings. As appropriate as it is that In Her Gentle Jaws kicks off with a cinematic title track tailor-made for an RPG start screen, it's the only song here that could plausibly come from an NES cartridge-- and even that's a stretch. Despite being heavily steeped in the four-channel efficiency of legendary Nintendo composer Koji Kondo, the instrumental turns to moody Disintegration-style reverb guitar for some extra muscle by the song's midway point. By the dense shoegaze of second track ""Sky Ghosts"", the duo's already winnowed their virtual stylings into mere ornamentation for In Her Gentle Jaws' two weapons of choice-- laptop pop and shoegaze. Surprisingly, the mishmash of these two genres with video game music feels organic, and by the end of In Her Gentle Jaws these monophonic pulse channels don't stick out any more than a guitar with fuzz distortion. The Guild pull this off especially well when they play up the genres' least common denominators-- escapism, emotional expression, and, of course, the fact that these styles of music are conducive to brooding alone in your bedroom. Nothing cures the blues like a few levels of ""Super Mario Bros."", so naturally the romantic pathos of ""Butterfly Kisses"" gets introduced by spaceship launch SFX straight from ""Metroid"". The bouncy laptop melodies and tender vocals of Kurt Feldman and Christoph Hochheim may bite Ben Gibbard a little, but the Guild's seldom so up front about their feelings. For example, is the chorus of Cocteau Twins 2.0 song ""Sky Ghosts"" (""Whatever cloud you're on/ I will find you"") a heartfelt plea to a lost love or a trash-talking gamer threatening the Hammer Brothers? The back half of In Her Gentle Jaws jettisons any emo tendencies, instead opting to explore the recesses of this semi-digital realm they've created. Although not quite as enticing as the first half's rapid-fire hooks and ADD song structures, the latter tracks form a formidable wall of sound, albeit one built using a lot of coin blocks. Closer ""Heavy Eyes"" builds mostly on ethereal guitar and vocals, but it can't climax until the 8-bit lead comes in, sounding strangely feasible in what could pass for a Slowdive song. If video game music's ever to have a Loveless, the Guild's taking a serious stab at it, regardless of how many mushroom power-up jokes you got for them.","On their promising debut, this Brooklyn duo folds the blocky 8-bit textures of vintage video games into a refined shoegaze aesthetic.

I Hate CDs! Norton 45s,Various Artists,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b487ea9e61561daa6c7d/1:1/w_160/7f43db88.jpg,2008-02-22 06:00:03,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11146-i-hate-cds-norton-45s/,Norton,"It's been the mantra of the hardcore vinyl lover since 1982. Hell, I was two years old when the CD was introduced and it was the dominant medium by the time I could string together a few allowances to buy an album, but even I've never found the shiny, lightweight discs half as lovable as the good old grooved 45 and 33 1/3 RPM LP (to say nothing of 78s, 10""s, and those 16-RPM super LPs that never caught on). A jewel case just can't compete with the one-foot-by-one-foot cardboard canvas LPs came in for decades. The insert's not even as big as a 45 picture sleeve, and we won't even bother talking about jpegs. I've never honestly had much of a stake in the argument over whether the old grooves have a better sound than the new ones and zeroes, not being much of an audiophile, but it's hard not to love the crackle of an aged, well-loved piece of vinyl. Norton Records was founded in 1986 by Brooklynites Miriam Linna and Billy Miller. They shared a mutual admiration for West Virginia one-man-band Hasil Adkins, whose outsider rockabilly recordings from the 50s were difficult to find at the time but presented a lo-fi musical vision that, for their time, bordered on the avant-garde. Their first release was a compilation of his work that helped put him back on the map and led to a long and wild run of releases of raw and unfiltered rock'n'roll and r&b mayhem, including reissues of dozens of obscurities and classics from the 50s, 60s, and 70s and releases of numerous contemporary bands that fit the label's basic aesthetic preferences. Their catalog these days is an 80-page book dedicated to Adkins, who passed away in 2005 just days after being assaulted in his front yard by an asshole on an ATV. Norton has actually released plenty of CDs over the years, generally paired with an LP version, but it was one of several labels to keep the old 7"" and 12"" formats alive during the late 80s and early 90s, when it seemed like they were destined for rapid extinction. The purpose of this cheekily named compilation, though, is to offer the internet generation a way to hear three CDs worth of wild 45 sides the label has reissued over the years. The irony of releasing a compilation called I Hate CDs digitally is entirely intentional. If you've been attuned to the Norton ethos over the years, chances are the contents of this thing won't surprise you much. It's full of brawling garage-rock, demented novelty records, solid rhythm & blues obscurities, surfy lead guitars, untrained vocals, and bucketloads of energy. Some of the artists included are acknowledged greats-- the two Ramones tracks, ""Judy Is a Punk"" and ""I Wanna Be Your Boyfriend"", are songs everyone should know, and the Sonics are essential to any understanding of where punk rock as we know it came from. Big Star's gorgeous power pop masterpiece ""September Gurls"" is here, too, as are tunes from Doug Sahm, Link Wray, ? & the Mysterians, and Mary Weiss of the Shangri-Las. A few tracks are the kind of basic, punk-pop that can serve as a gateway drug to crazier stuff. The Real Kids' ""All Kindsa Girls"" is a melodic, punchy song that's more than happy to get its handful of chords stuck in your head, and the Dictators offer an even more potent earworm with ""Who Will Save Rock'n'Roll?"" The guitar riffs, economical solo, and instantly memorable ""my generation is not the salvation"" hook make you wonder if it really needed saving, because it sounds pretty alive and well on this song. There's a raft of seat-of-the-pants blasts of garage rock among these 45 tracks, from the primal, indistinct stomp and grotesque fuzz of Roy Loney & the A-Bones to the piano-pounding rockabilly thrash of Scotty McKay's ""Bad Times"". You can probably guess what the Neanderthals' ""Twinkle Toes"" sounds like without much help. This all sits quite comfortably next to shuffling r&b bruisers like Don Covay's ""Switchen in the Kitchen"" and Esquerita's juke-joint jam ""Rockin' the Joint"". Andre Williams' funky ""The Monkey Speaks His Mind"" offers a brilliant inversion of the old evolution debate, with a monkey claiming that it's insulting to arborial primates to say that man descended from them. ""No monkey ever deserted his wife, starved his baby and ruined her life,"" says the monkey. We could learn from this guy. The compilation is nicely spiked with a few flat-out strange artists, with the two weirdest grouped together at the beginning of disc two. Screamin' Jay Hawkins is a legend in oddball music circles and had a personality to match the crazed, bizarre vocal style that gave him his nickname. There's an actual club for all of his illegitimate children, who outnumber the broods of most Egyptian pharaohs, and his onstage presence was a thing to behold, as he emerged from a coffin at the beginning of his sets and used a number of macabre props, including a skull that appeared in a great many of his publicity photos. His ""I Hear Voices"", included here, is a brilliant and totally warped piece of nightmare exotica, with an apocalyptic organ part and frenzied voices tugging at his heels as he undergoes a massive vocal freakout. You just have to hear it. It's followed by Wade Curtiss & the Rhythm Rockers' ""Puddy Cat"", a hard-to-describe rip-off of the Trashmen's ""Surfin' Bird"" that features vocals that imitate an angry cat from way back in the throat, giving them a simultaneous psychotic and robotic feel. This set is great for anyone who's into raw garage-rock, the roots of punk, rockabilly, or good-old-fashioned rock'n'roll. And despite focusing on mostly unknown old 45 sides, it's not only for fanatics-- a lot of this stuff (certainly not all of it, though) will have very broad appeal, and the Adkins track, ""Chicken Shake"", gives newcomers to his music a pretty good taste of his style. And then there's the format issue. Frankly, most of these records aren't hi-fi enough for anyone to notice much difference in quality between the 45s and mp3s, and that exposes the most basic fact that gets overlooked in the format debates: it's what's in the grooves that counts, and the grooves they've digitized for this comp are a hell of a lot of fun to listen to in any medium.","This sprawling digital-only compilation of 45s generally focuses on garage-rock, punk, and r&b, but artists come from all over the map, ranging from well known (the Ramones and Big Star) to the obscure (Shades of Night) to the flat-out strange (Screamin' Jay Hawkins).

Colorloss Record EP,Belong,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b4ab5e6ef95969322643/1:1/w_160/504d1f34.jpg,2008-02-22 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11176-colorloss-record-ep/,St. Ives,"In early 2006, Belong's October Language, the debut album by Turk Dietrich and Michael Jones of New Orleans, was discussed in the context of Hurricane Katrina. That they had recorded the album before the catastrophe didn't seem to matter; ""Katrina"" was the first and only thing that came to mind when you thought about New Orleans in those days, so October Language became for many a kind of response. If nothing else, the association said something about Belong's approach to shoegaze: Where Loveless and its kind tend toward the swooning, sensual, and feminine, using noise to suggest a protective womb into which one can withdraw and dream, Belong's walls of distortion were a shade darker, a few degrees colder, more isolationist. The stuff of an aftermath. These qualities are magnified on the brief EP Colorloss Record, but something additional is brought to the table: All four of these tracks are covers, complete with vocals. For artists in Belong's sphere, the tendency when covering songs has been to pull the tune apart and reassemble it in a barely-recognizable configuration, using noise to smash the pop confection into a million glittering slivers. Belong have a different M.O. Deep down in the belly of the track, you sense that these songs are intact and functioning normally, but Belong use feedback and drone to overwhelm the tunes, to make them sound small, like something you're straining to hear and can't quite make out. Voices inside a collapsed mineshaft, maybe, or echoes from a kid stuck in a well. That the four songs chosen are obscure psych-pop tunes adds to the effect, making the voices sound even more distant, harder to hear under an additional layer of dust. The Cleaners From Venus' early-80s take of Syd Barrett's Madcap Laughs closer ""Late Night"" (the version that Belong say they're referencing) is a thin, spiky new wave spin on Nuggets-era psych; Belong take the happy-sad melody and banish it to the horizon, where it can just barely be heard through the thick chords. Someone overhearing it in my vicinity likened it to Robert Pollard trapped inside a seashell, which made some sense; the Technicolor loopiness of the melody survives intact, despite sounding tiny and frail. ""Beeside"", originally from Tintern Abbey, is altered most radically, the peppy melody being basically stretched like taffy to such a length that it's hard to tell where the vocals leave off and instruments begin. Because of this transformation it also sounds like the most like traditional (if well done) drone here, like it could have been made by a lot of bands. For Billy Nicholls' ""Girl from New York"", Belong replicate the chords with unstable, static-ridden held tones, but the vocal melody is revealed only gradually, first appearing as short, clipped notes and then hitting the full refrain about halfway in. It's pop song length (three and a half minutes) but still feels epic, as it slides uneasily through its clearly delineated sections. ""My Clown"", originally by the band July, ends the set closer to where it began with the Syd Barrett tune. The plaintive ""But I love my clown more than you know/ Stop fooling around"" chorus sounds like it's addressed not to anyone in particular, but rather to anyone who might hear it, a message in a bottle rolling along on the heavy waves of the chords. As the track progresses-- it's the longest, stretching almost to seven minutes-- the voices become more abstracted, not-quite-lost in the din, which eventually swells into the most richly textured construction on the record. It feels important that the voice is still in there somewhere, but by this point, you feel ready to let it go, to follow the pure sound of Belong wherever it may lead.","The best qualities of Belong's 2006 LP October Language-- dark shades, an almost isolationist feeling-- are magnified on this brief but wonderful covers EP*.*

Alegranza!,El Guincho,by: Tim Finney,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b4c65e6ef9596932266d/1:1/w_160/8ed35e4d.jpg,2008-02-22 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11200-alegranza/,Discoteca Océano,"Alegranza! does two things that often appear separately in records you fall in love with, but rarely together: On the one hand, it reminds you of so much other music you love, and on the other, it sounds little like any of them. Spanish artist El Guincho (real name: Pablo Díaz-Reixa) makes music from Spanish chanting, thudding tribal rhythms, ghostly harmonies, and the bits and pieces of a thousand as-yet-unwritten pop songs. It's a combination that won't be appearing in any pop how-to guides any time soon. The impressive and probably unwittingly fashionable source material-- Afrobeat, dub, Tropicália, and early rock'n'roll-- and the irresistibility of these songs can only briefly obscure the fact that no one else is really making music quite like this. Alegranza! has already been compared extensively to Panda Bear's Person Pitch, and the two records do share a hazy, sampladelic love-in feel (hypnotic, interlocking sample loops; delirious, auto-harmonizing pop song choruses). I'm more strongly reminded of Animal Collective's Strawberry Jam, even though this record sounds very different: Both it and Alegranza! are spikier, less pristine, and less invested in images of the past. There's no sacred totem in Alegranza! to play the role that the Beach Boys do for Person Pitch-- opener ""Palmitos Park"" may sound a bit like Richie Valens, but otherwise El Guincho's songcraft resemblances are at once so broad and so diffuse that they feel osmotic rather than deliberate: Confused chants coalesce into brain-teasingly familiar vocal hooks, while quicksilver flashes of guitar trace echoes of melodies you feel you must already know like the back of your hand. While the ""What if...?"" experiments of Person Pitch suggested a future and a past in secret communication with each other, Alegranza! is locked into an endless now: a fusion of songful simplicity and unpolished production wizardry that feels right more than it feels startling. It's nice, too, that this music resists the easy tag of ""dreamlike""; there's a sharpness to the detail and to the buoyancy of Díaz-Reixa's vocals and rhythms that suggests a state of gleeful alertness. This is music for children, in the best sense-- wide-eyed and excitedly open to the whole spectrum of possibilities out there in the world, devoid of past baggage or future anxiety. (In fact, it's not at all coincidental that one of the best reference points I can offer for this album is British post-rock band Disco Inferno's final EP, It's a Kid's World. There's something childlike, too, in the way El Guincho's chants and harmonies seem to shift between (relative) tension and release with delighted and purposeless ease, shuttling between the registers of high and higher for the simple thrill of confounding expectations, as if reaching a peak and staying there would be a cop-out. The madly hopping ""Kalise"", at first ridiculously and hypnotically repetitive, is ultimately exposed as a giant tease for an astonishing, panoramic chorus, whose multi-tracked ""ah ah ah!"" might be the most utopian moment in music you'll hear this year. There's little subtlety here: ""Fata Morgana"" may begin with ambient washes of sound, disconcerting looped string riffs, and abstracted wails in the background, but again it's a trap: the song soon morphs into a triumphant anthem, zooming across the stereo mix as if on a trapeze. Most of all, it's Díaz-Reixa's intuitive feel for rhythm that marks out *Alegranza! * as such an unusual and enticing listening experience. Deceptively simple and surprisingly prominent in the mix, his drum patterns shock not just by their variety (how do you get from the charged booty grind of ""Cuando Maravilla Fui"" to the spacious underwater kraut-dub of ""Buenos Matrimonios Ahí Afuera""?) but also by their suspicious habit of mutating almost imperceptibly from comforting to impressively alien: Check the way ""Costa Paraíso""'s clattering tribal rhythms fold themselves into ever tighter coils of frenzy, like a crowd of dancers about to spontaneously combust. Rather than stretch out on endless expanses of sound, El Guincho's music is all about sharp and sudden peaks and valleys-- the idea isn't to tune in and drop out, but to revel in being surrounded by something larger than yourself, swept along on the rapids of rhythm.","Taking impressive and probably unwittingly fashionable source material-- Afrobeat, dub, Tropicalia, and early rock'n'roll-- and applying an intuitive feel for rhythm, Spain's Pablo Díaz-Reixa crafts a fusion of songful simplicity and unpolished production wizardry that feels right more than it feels startling.

Safe Inside the Day,Baby Dee,by: Joshua Klein,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b480c0084474cd0c22ac/1:1/w_160/8afd3b89.jpg,2008-02-21 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11140-safe-inside-the-day/,Drag City,"Cabaret music can be played as camp or played as kitsch, but it's best when it's played straight. Not that Baby Dee cares much about playing it straight. A loud and proud transgender performance artist, Baby Dee's a self proclaimed former ""traveling hermaphrodite"" who spent time working a Coney Island freak show (a family show, she says) before ditching New York and returning to her home town of Cleveland, where, if you believe her autobiographical press notes, she ran a tree removal service (imagine being on the receiving end of that service call). It was there that fan Will Oldham came knocking, rescuing Baby Dee from can't-pay-the-bills obscurity. Oldham wasn't exactly calling blind, however. A friend of Antony Hegarty, Baby Dee also found support from early Antony benefactor and Oldham pal David Tibet (of Current 93). Tibet had released Antony's debut on his Durtro label, and he would do the same for several of Baby Dee's recordings. In Cleveland, Oldham invited Baby Dee to support him and Matt Sweeney on their Superwolf tour, and apparently she made enough of an impression that Oldham and Sweeney subsequently signed on to produce and play on her excellent Drag City debut Safe Inside the Day, the album rounded out by vets of Hegarty's band, Chavez, Current 93, and no less than incredible hulk Andrew WK on bass. Even were the Antony connection not explicit, there's no missing some musical similarities. As with Antony, Baby Dee gets over on her total, naked sincerity, the kind of presence and honesty that pushes right through any preconceived notions. She shares this quality with a host of fellow outsiders and eccentrics, everyone from Tiny Tim through Tom Waits, artists who approached cabaret and vaudeville in a manner that transcended categorization. Baby Dee's earlier releases were solo affairs, and while she's certainly surrounded by steady hands here, she's hardly leaning on her collaborators for support. If anything, given the explicitly autobiographical bent of Safe Inside the Day, it's overwhelmingly Baby Dee's show, and for better or for worse her outsized personality dominates, even on instrumental tracks like ""A Christmas Jig for a Three-Legged Cat"" or ""Flower on the Tracks"". Those instrumentals come late in the album, and since by then you've been well-immersed in her world, lyrics or not those instrumentals continue in the mode established earlier by songs like the title track and ""The Only Bones That Show"". It's on cuts like these that Baby Dee brings us back to her Cleveland roots, from whence stem memories dark, wistful, and sometimes even a tad humorous. In the latter category falls ""The Dance of Diminishing Possibilities"", about a pair of neighborhood characters who take an ax to an upright piano. The rest of the disc is populated with drunks and daddy, damaged goods and dreamers, subjects given arrangements that wouldn't have been out of place on Waits' Rain Dogs but here are offered with a confessional edge. The twisted piano ditty ""Big Titty Bee Girl (From Dino Town)"", for example, denotes a litany of abuses levied on an albino victim, with Baby Dee's voice a mix of ironic sun and menacing snarl. In ""The Only Bones That Show"", it's teeth that link smiles with violence, vulnerability, and viciousness. In ""You'll Find Your Footing"" Baby Dee makes hope sound like an illusion embraced by the desperate at rock bottom. ""You'll find your footing/ In another world/ On another day/ And in another time/ You'll find your footing there."" It probably goes without saying that Baby Dee has had something of a tough life, but what makes Safe Inside the Day so palatable is its tenderness. If Baby Dee's voice is something of an acquired taste, there's no faking the conviction as she exorcises her demons. Besides, rarely has an exorcism come off so resoundingly beautiful. A heart of darkness and a heart of gold need not be mutually exclusive, and in Baby Dee's world, even a sunrise in hell is no less pretty for its surroundings.","Cleveland's transgender chanteuse turns through her back pages for dark, twisted, but oddly tender recollections of a life lead and in some ways escaped (featuring Will Oldham and Andrew WK).

Lies and Rhetoric,Statehood,by: Jason Crock,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b47fea9e61561daa6c6c/1:1/w_160/b39e8c96.jpg,2008-02-21 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11139-lies-and-rhetoric/,self-released,"Eric Axelson and Joe Easley, the former bassist and drummer of Washington D.C.'s the Dismemberment Plan, should be treated as a natural resource. While I'm sure they have their own ambitions (and lives), they should still be hired out in an act of musical socialism, or be hired guns for some label like the Memphis Horns, pushing the music of their peers forward with their fluid and distinctive patter, mined from Motown and forged in D.C. Take Statehood's ""End the Moderation"": verses where manic drumming barely leave room for the morse-code rhythm of the chicken-scratch guitars, bookended by huge, dramatic strums, before they lay back and breathe for a dreamy, but driving chorus, and finally collapse in a pile at the end of each refrain. It's a relay-race performance for all involved, but even the sharpest songwriter on their own couldn't make these transitions without sounding ostentatious about it or tripping over their feet. With Axelson and Easley, it's another day on the job. Musicians sound better when these two are behind them. But despite the presence of the two of them and guitarist Leigh Thompson, Statehood's 2007 debut is pretty much a vehicle for singer and guitarist Clark Sabine. Lies and Rhetoric is a record that still has one foot in the bedroom, and the other in the melodic, but twisted D.C. post-hardcore that plenty of listeners will never tire of. ""A Story's End"" and ""Giants"" start the record off with nervous energy and distinctive melodies, but don't quite transcend the anxious pulse of the post-punk we've heard much of before. The guitars grind out tense progressions in syncopated bursts while Sabine flips between his nervous croon and choked, emotive yelp (not too far from another area luminary, J. Robbins). The rhythm section asserts themselves more in the steady sidestep of ""Save Yourself"", but more than that, its chorus is a surprise dreamy cool-down with just a bit of minimal, textural guitar, like falling rain on a rooftop, courtesy of Thompson. Sabine's lyrics are unfortunately broad here (""The house we built has crumbled""), but it's a moment where the four of them congeal into a passage that's creative and surprising. The aforementioned rhythm section add ghostly percussion to ""Every Single Question"", making Sabine's distorted vocal all the more ominous, and a sleek mechanical thump to closer ""Jailer's Daughter""; you wouldn't think it from the rest of the record, but the influence of dance music is integrated in thoughtful, unobtrusive ways that always serve the song. Thompson acquits himself well on the sparkling textures of ""Hidden Views"" and even some talkbox-like effects on ""Transfixed"". The lyrics on the latter offer vague notions of dissent without digging into themes of ""lies and rhetoric"" the song mentions offhand, alluding more towards interpersonal relationships in pattern with most of the record. The interplay is seamless in ""No, I Don't Think You Want to Know"", which features both a familiar loping disco beat as well as a spacey, almost drum-n-bass bridge, as well as woozy, delirious guitar bends and another indelible chorus. Likewise, the deft curveball chorus of ""Still Spinning"" is both gorgeous and chest-beating, and it's on these tracks where Sabine shows off his New Pop side just as much as the side steeped in post-hardcore. These moments are obvious standouts, but the rest remind us of that one thing that's hard to write about because it's impossible to quantify: chemistry between musicians. It's where prior influences and new ideas go in, and come out as something entirely different; when a band is more than the sum of their parts. The Dismemberment Plan was a shining example, and all the later projects of their members have just reminded how rare that quality is. Songs like ""Disconnect"" were near finished (and even available on the band's myspace page) before Sabine hooked up with his current cohorts, and there's a fine singer-songwriter's record here, one that's angrier and funkier than most, and benefits from some talented and sensitive accompanists. But what I'm really looking forward to is future releases where Statehood might start to sound like more of a full band.","Eric Axelson and Joe Easley, the former bassist and drummer for the legendary Dismemberment Plan, back singer and guitarist Clark Sabine in a new band.

Soundboy Punishments,Various Artists,by: Tim Finney,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b4bd13d197565213ab62/1:1/w_160/c92e806f.jpg,2008-02-21 06:00:02,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11193-soundboy-punishments/,Rough TradeSkull Disco,"""Blood on My Hands"", the most well-known release from dubstep producer (and co-owner of label Skull Disco) Shackleton, succeeds by restraint, its scintillating percussion loops so clearly and carefully etched that it's difficult to know what to make of the song's ghostly narrator: ""When I see the towers fall, it cannot be denied/ That as a spectacle it is a realization of the mind."" In any other dubstep producer's hands such a vision would be married to a groove of apocalyptic violence, or at least uncompromising grimness, but Shackleton realizes just how unnerving beauty can be. It's this (and the hi-hat quietly ticking on every half-beat) that allowed the track to cross over to minimal house dancefloors-- indeed, the subsequent Ricardo Villalobos remix, included on this two disc Skull Disco retrospective, had to stretch out past 18 minutes just to ward off charges of redundancy. ""Skull Disco"" is often used as shorthand for the refined, delicate sound of the label's main producer Shackleton, ignoring the sound of the label's other owner-producer Appleblim, and the distance that separates the two. On the first disc of Soundboy Punishments their tracks are counterposed, only emphasizing their respective strengths and weaknesses. Appleblim, who contributes almost a third of the tracks here, is surprisingly close to dubstep hegemony, his stunted, slow-motion ""halfstep"" beats, nihilistic basslines, and overwrought breakdowns distinctive only for their relative subtlety and high production values. Appleblim is clearly a student of music history, and his productions bear the strong imprint of early techstep drum'n'bass' moody, midnight noir vibe-- in fact the stomping ""Fear"" is an open (and pretty great) homage to this sound. But what Appleblim and other halfstep producers often inherit from techstep are grooves that sound wounded and even crippled, dragging themselves forward in a painfully lopsided manner, as if all their limbs ended in bloody stumps. The crucial difference is tempo: The faster speeds of techstep allowed the grooves to be dynamic and fleet-footed in spite of their blood and gore; Appleblim's grooves mostly just stagger unpleasantly, their accumulated menace excreted in blaring explosions of bass. Shackleton's work raises entirely different questions: If his fluid, multi-textured rhythms clearly share dubstep's lineage, they're too ornate and perfect-sounding to be mistaken for any other producer's work. Set opener ""Hamas Rule"" is even more painfully refined than ""Blood on My Hands"", each percussive rustle placed with agonising care, while underneath the sub-bass roams and prowls with a lazy, feline grace. Shackleton's flair for intricacy is impressive and almost unmatched-- of all the dubstep producers operating, only Pinch and Mala can concoct such thrillingly delicate grooves, and then even they fall short of Shackleton's single-minded devotion to the cause. But the formalism and reserve of Shackleton's arrangements can render them as claustrophobic as they are compelling, like staring at beautifully sculpted (but locked and unscaleable) wrought iron gates. If Appleblim marshals together bundles of energy and menace without knowing what to do with them, Shackleton's production can seem like statues of invincible soldiers, only waiting for someone to enliven and animate them. I keep expecting these grooves to ""brock out""-- to borrow a term from drum & bass-- but such brute physicality is rarely on the producer's agenda. Perhaps he thinks such displays would undermine the impressive self-containment and majesty of his arrangements, and he might be right. Still, when he succumbs (mostly on disc two) the results are stunning: ""I Want To Eat You"", at first slow and reverent, shifts from poised vigilance into a double-time and deadly battle, its rippling, snaking drums slicing through the majestic arrangement like glittering blades. And while Appleblim's line-towing conservativism largely bores, some of Soundboy Punishment's most enjoyable moments are those where Shackleton drifts closer to the scene orthodoxy of his partner in crime. The jittery grime/dubstep fusion of ""Stalker"" wears the producer's sonic signature more lightly than anything else by him, but its tense, paranoid stutters brilliantly live up to the track's title. Likewise, the spacious but restlessly energetic closer ""You Make Me Cry"", all fluttering bongos and stabbing halfstep beats, flawlessly appropriates the best ideas from Benga and Skream's more agile dubstep productions. Not surprisingly, it's on these excursions away from his perfected template that Shackleton can sound almost lighthearted. He should try it more often: The weight of possibility is enough that he hardly needs to make things heavier.","Shackleton and Appleblim's Skull Disco label offers a 2xCD set of refined, delicate dubstep and moody techstep-influenced productions.

Ire Works,The Dillinger Escape Plan,by: Cosmo Lee,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b4939d034d5c69bf4eb7/1:1/w_160/dc50d518.jpg,2008-02-21 06:00:01,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11156-ire-works/,Relapse,"News of the Dillinger Escape Plan often reads like the sports page: ruptured disc, torn rotator cuff, tooth knocked out by guitar, foot broken by guitar. Bassist Liam Wilson once dubbed his band ""The Dillinger Insurance Plan."" DEP's brutal live shows (at New York's Virgin Megastore in 2005, singer Greg Puciato literally ran over the crowd) are partially responsible for the group's high rate of attrition. Only one member, guitarist Ben Weinman, remains from the original lineup. Despite a turnover of four guitarists, two bassists, one singer, and one drummer, DEP's sound has retained its foundation, mathcore, which it nearly perfected on 1999's Calculating Infinity. Around that time, Converge, Cave In, and Botch also twisted hardcore punk into angular, metallic shapes. But DEP were twice as spastic and technical, spraying odd meters and dissonant lines like epileptic machine gunners. Calculating Infinity was an instant classic, inspiring a new generation of mathcore bands like Psyopus, the End, and Thumbscrew. However, DEP branched out. In 2001, vocalist Dimitri Minakakis left the band. Irony Is a Dead Scene followed, an explosive collaboration with Mike Patton (Faith No More, Mr. Bungle) which included a cover of Aphex Twin's ""Come to Daddy"". In DEP, Puciato replaced Minakakis' one-note bark with an extremely wide range. 2004's Miss Machine deployed this range over varied tempos, electronics, and occasional pop moments. Faith No More and Nine Inch Nails were obvious influences; on 2006's Plagiarism covers EP, Puciato did a note-perfect Trent Reznor-- and a passable Justin Timberlake. Such moves are pure Patton, and Puciato's voice is startlingly similar in timbre. But unlike Patton, DEP don't colonize their experiments. Inevitably songs return to quirky, jerky cores. On Ire Works, the ""Living Colour as white boys"" falsettos of ""Black Bubblegum"" are startling at first-- not to mention its recent performance on ""Late Night with Conan O'Brien"". But even such a poppy song has a churning, abrasive bridge. Half of Ire Works is still mathcore. Unlike Calculating Infinity's sprawling roundhouse kicks, though, Ire Works throws short, hard jabs. Most songs clock in well under three minutes. New drummer Gil Sharone is much to credit for the punchiness. His predecessor, Chris Pennie, was a formidable technician, but Sharone adds a palpable sense of groove. More than ever, DEP have songs. They're also the band's most colorful to date. Glitchy electronics palpitate ""Sick on Sunday"" and ""When Acting as a Wave"". Strings flutter like insect wings on ""When Acting as a Particle"". The piano soundscape of ""Dead as History"" could come from NIN's The Fragile. ""Milk Lizard"" oozes sleazy horns over saucy rock, while ""Mouth of Ghosts"" unfurls psychedelic, jazzy jamming. These are elephants in the mathcore room; then again, Faith No More was about elephants in the room, and DEP now pick up where Faith No More left off.","After yet another lineup change-- drummer Gil Sharone joins the band, a move that already is paying dividends-- DEP return with another set of mathcore colored at times by glitzy electronics, strings, and horns.

"Hold on Now, Youngster...",Los Campesinos!,by: Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b4ae5e6ef95969322646/1:1/w_160/f93de276.jpg,2008-02-21 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11179-hold-on-now-youngster/,Arts & CraftsWichita,"ONE! TWO! THREE! FOUR! Every musician is also an audience, and if the ever-growing pile of new music my exhausted mailman brings me every day is any indication, more and more audience members are becoming musicians, too. Since long before ""indie"" was a buzzword, the loosely defined scene has celebrated participatory self-expression-- whether in the first independently released punk records (""It was easy, it was cheap, go and do it,"" sang the Desperate Bicycles in 1977, on one of the first ever), the hand-assembled 7"" singles of 1980s indie pop, the four-track cassettes of 1990s lo-fi, or even the revival-meeting catharsis of the Arcade Fire and ""Form a Band"" exhortations of Art Brut. Nobody writes them like they used to, so it may as well be you. (WITH MY WALKMAN TUCKED UNDER MY FOREARM) Few bands have made as much out of this ideal of enthusiast-as-artist as Los Campesinos!. Formed two years ago at Cardiff University in Wales, the indie-pop septet first grabbed attention on MySpace, but their music embodies some the best elements of the past 30 years of indie music. It's not just the superficial connections, like their Ramones- or Pastels-style surnames, band-made zine, or the cover of Pavement B-side ""Frontwards"" on last year's slept-on Sticking Fingers Into Sockets EP. With boy/girl exclamations (!) befitting a punkier Heavenly/Calvin Johnson collaboration (!!), the lavish instrumentation of Broken Social Scene (whose Dave Newfeld produces), childish glockenspiels, and exuberantly buzzing guitars, debut album Hold on Now, Youngster... is a giddy, tuneful love note to individuality, pathos, smarts, silliness, and everything else indie pop built its name on. There's even the requisite ironic self-mockery-- nobody actually thought this stuff was cool, did they? FOUR SWEATY BOYS WITH GUITARS TELL ME NOTHING ABOUT MY LIFE! Like indie bands from the Smiths to Vampire Weekend, Los Campesinos! pack their songs with lyrical specificity, only their lives are apparently full of internet surfing, indie fandom, and absurd humor. ""Stick with the imprints/ With the hieroglyphics that the fan club sent us,"" Gareth Campesinos! hollers with every exclamation point in his young being on ""Broken Heartbeats Sound Like Breakbeats"", which claps into an Aleksandra Campesinos!-sung chorus about Spiderman. This bunch are as apt to sing about CTRL-ALT-DEL, LiveJournal entries, and that old blogger standby ""throwing up in my mouth"" as they are about B-sides, K Records T-shirts, or C-90 cassettes. Hey, this is what they know, and they document it with an emotional vividness that should have Pete Wentz friending them in no time. (Even though he probably won't get most of their jokes.) THE OPPOSITE OF TRUE LOVE IS AS FOLLOWS: REALITY! Depressive gloominess is, of course, another indie hallmark, perhaps put most succinctly by a certain former K Records affiliate in the Nirvana title ""I Hate Myself and I Want to Die"". Hold on Now, Youngster... takes on the topic with wit, sure, but also an ache that suggests that such feelings are still all too real to them. Asked what character from The Breakfast Club he would be, Gareth proclaims, ""I'd be the one that dies."" Told by Aleksandra that ""no one dies,"" he retorts, ""Well, then what's the point?"" Then again, ""...And We Exhale and Roll Our Eyes in Unison"" flirts with sex-- starting with the coy opening line, ""It's bad enough you ever use the word as an adjective""-- so Los Campesinos! have also shed some of indie-pop's stereotypical puritanism. AND EVERY SENTENCE THAT I SPOKE BEGAN AND ENDED IN ELLIP...SES! In contrast with the often exclusively macho male archetypes typically offered by mainstream rock and hip-hop, indie-oriented bands since the Modern Lovers have offered new visions of masculinity. And Hold on Now, Youngster...'s masterful update of indie tropes goes as far as embracing indie pop's bookish wimpiness for both boys and girls, from the Jane Eyre disses of the colorfully chiming ""Don't Tell Me to Do the Math(s)"" to the ""damn extended metaphors"" of ""My Year in Lists"" to, well, there's a song called ""We Are All Accelerated Readers"". The best holdover from the Sticking Fingers Into Sockets EP, ""You! Me! Dancing!"", is a shy acknowledgment that as much as indie audiences may have come to love dance music, not everyone can do the Dude 'N Nem. I SPENT THE LAST SEVEN YEARS PERCHED ON THE EDGE OF MY BED SCRATCHING ""I AM INCREDIBLY SINCERE"" INTO MY FOREARM! Wry self-criticism has been arguably another of the most integral aspects of indie fandom for decades. If you're going to be a lonely obsessive carting around boatloads of worthless records and even more useless knowledge, you'd better at least have a sense of humor about it. And Los Campesinos! do: ""Well, I need new hobbies, that's one thing for certain,"" they shout on ""Knee Deep at ATP"" after overturning High Fidelity's hypothesis that ""what really matters is what you like, not what you are like."" The aforementioned ""My Year in Lists"" starts to apply the music fanatic's favorite pastime, list-making, to New Year's resolutions, then thinks better of it. You won't admit to reading about it in Pitchfork. Whatever. I GET CARRIED AWAY... For all its unabashed indie fandom, Hold on Now, Youngster... varies from the music it worships in a very fundamental way. No one will ever call Los Campesinos! ""shambling"", as John Peel termed the twee-pop set, nor will they be called slackers, like their heroes Pavement, because this debut is unusually taut and polished, with hooks, crescendos, and clever turns of phrase nearly always in the right place. Yeah, they've started recycling a couple of their tricks, like Ballboy-esque spoken-word outros, and their youthful, shouty vocals won't be for everyone. But in the album's highlight, ""Sweet Dreams, Sweet Cheeks"", the guitars jangle in one speaker and squawk in the other, building up to a gleeful chant-- ""One blink for yes, two blinks for no!""-- that caps one of the most triumphant indie-pop songs you're likely to hear in 2008. Cynics will no doubt tar the band's admirers as undeveloped, ignorant, or stupid. But we're happy.","With a punk spirit, some self-criticism, and lots of (too much?) shouting, the Welsh band offers a giddy, tuneful love note to individuality, pathos, smarts, silliness, and everything else indie pop built its name on.

Songs From The Bigtop,Various Artists,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b4739d034d5c69bf4e84/1:1/w_160/3a9312f3.jpg,2008-02-20 06:00:04,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11130-songs-from-the-bigtop/,Devon Reed,"Songs From the Bigtop is the soundtrack to Devon Reed's movie musical The Bigtop, a movie about a kid from the prairie who runs away with the circus and, in Reed's description, ""essentially becomes a monster in his quest for power."" He also falls in love and there's apparently a subplot about industrial sabotage-- I can't elaborate much beyond that, because the film isn't out yet as of this writing and I've naturally not been able to see it. The soundtrack, however, functions fine without the movie: These are fully developed, listenable songs, all written by Reed but performed by an assortment of indie rock names and newcomers-- in some cases, before the screenplay was even written. Fittingly then, most of the music has no circus feel in either the writing or the instrumentation, so don't come hoping for calliopes, trumpets, and barrel organs. Instead, it's pretty straightforward indie pop and indie rock, but performed by an all-star cast: Built to Spill's Doug Martsch, the Clientele, Damien Jurado, Robert Schneider's Marbles project, Eleventh Dream Day, Lisa Germano, Matthew Sweet, and Howe Gelb all contribute tracks built on his lyrics. Generally, the artists are well-suited to the material, though Reed's songwriting tends to lean heavily on the easy rhyme, a trait that becomes noticeable over the course of the album. Reed also allows the artists to stick to their respective sounds, so the Clientele's too-brief song plays like it could easily have fallen off one of their LPs, and Matthew Sweet digs his husky voice into fuzzy power-pop that recalls his early 90s output more than anything he's done recently. A couple of tracks do hint at the film's circus elements: Tullycraft's ""The Girl Who's Above Us"" has a staggering waltz feel backed with a couple accordions, while Howe Gelb goes more for the scary clown angle on the 54-second spoken word/noise track ""Falling in Love"". Thing is, none of this material is all that exceptional-- Communiqué's ""Way to Walk"", for instance, is a carefully crafted indie rock could-be anthem that never quite breaks out into that huge chorus it's reaching for. ""I Only Want the Sky"", arranged and sung by Michael Leviton, pokes along without much of a melody, and as gamely as Doug Martsch tries to fill ""Cracked and Crazed"" with the natural ache that suffuses his own work, the song doesn't give him a whole lot to work with. Songs From the Bigtop is an interesting project, and the contributions of each artist will be attractive to their fans, but on the whole the disc feels scattered and devoid of any standouts.","The soundtrack to Devon Reed's movie musical features songs written by the filmmaker and performed by indie all-stars such as Built to Spill's Doug Martsch, the Clientele, Eleventh Dream Day, Robert Schneider's Marbles project, Lisa Germano, Matthew Sweet, and Howe Gelb.

Pillowface and His Airplane Chronicles,Steve Aoki,by: David Raposa,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b4a05e6ef9596932262c/1:1/w_160/5a6e5b03.jpg,2008-02-20 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11167-pillowface-and-his-airplane-chronicles/,Thrive,"This mix, the first (and hopefully last) from Dim Mak major domo Steve Aoki, kicks off with Refused's ""New Noise"", a 10-year-old track that mixes Fugazi-loving ruckus with the merch-friendly electronic ambiance now heard on the quiet moments of your average Linkin Park single. After two minutes of this enjoyable ruckus, the disc jumps into a 16-track mix of modern-day post-punk and indie-approved dance tracks that I assume by the incongruous Refused intro is meant to signify the ""new noise"" of a 21st century American Apparelled rock/dance zeitgeist that's not at all played out in the slightest. Granted, this thing passes the American Bandstand test just fine, which is its primary purpose. That said, a broken dishwasher also has a beat to it, and sticking someone's gussied-up 1987 Maytag front and center at the trendiest L.A. hot spot would undoubtedly get both scene-stealers and scene-makers on the floor in time for a Cobrasnake photo op. So we have a guitar-flavored version of the boundary-busting credo offered in Green Velvet's ""Shake and Pop""-- ""I like electro/ I like retro/ I like ghetto/ House & techno""-- never mind that kicking those doors down in a Daft Punk world doesn't take all that much effort. That said, whenever Aoki tries to bring two (or three) purportedly great tastes together, the end result is the aural equivalent of mixing toothpaste and orange juice. In Aoki's mind, Mickey Avalon can offer a verse on a perfectly fine little electro squiggle like K.I.M.'s ""Wet 'N Wild"" without gumming up the works, while Pase Rock can pinch a horny-backpacker loaf on one of two Justice tracks and not sound like an assclown. For what it's worth, Pase does his business all over ""Waters of Nazareth""-- take a wild G.U.E.S.S. what the other Justice track is (and guess which indie-rooted RMXGRP worked their magic on it). Guests of similar quality pepper the disc, with only Kid Sister's turn atop ""Shake and Pop"" being worth a damn. Turns by the vocalists for Hot Hot Heat and the Faint come off more like extraneous cameos than the spotlight-grabbers they should be. If only other folks followed suit: Har Mar Superstar fronts like Licensed to Ill is the be-all and end-all of hip-hop, Spank Rocker Amanda Blank manages to make a turgid remix of Does It Offend You, Yeah? even worse, and Santogold damages one of the mix's more enjoyable tracks (""Licky [Work It Out]""), with her bargain-basement-Peaches turn at the mic. If you're the sort that accepts no substitutes, then you'll be happy to know that the original shows up on this thing as well, thanks to Weird Science, a remix duo featuring a member of Moving Units and a certain Mr. Aoki. Peaches emerges relatively unscathed on their manhandling of ""Boys Wanna Be Her"", but then there's her turn atop a castrated version of Bloc Party's ""Helicopter"". Weird Science take a perfectly fine guitar-driven track, strip out its frenetic drive, add a lumpy sea-sick strobe-bass beat, and put the track's focus entirely on Kele Okereke's and Peaches' vocals, because that's supposedly where the party is. After 50 minutes of this tired nonsense, with the highlights (like the bloops and bleeps of Yelle's thankfully untouched ""Je Veux Te Voir"", or the bits of Datarock's strummy ""Fa-Fa-Fa"" that aren't beset by hot hot air) sorely outnumbered by the lowlights, the mix ends with another turgid rock-meets-dance-with-guest remix, this time a track by Dim Mak group (and post-punk aficionados) Scanners with additional words of wisdom offered by Justice labelmate Uffie. By this point, whatever ""new noise"" Aoki seemed to promise at the start comes off as just futile sound and fury signifying the number of folks he has in his iPhone and/or under contract.","Dim Mak label head and professional L.A. scenester offers a mix of, what do you know, modern-day post-punk and indie-approved dance tracks.

Mission Control,The Whigs,by: Joshua Klein,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b4825e6ef959693225fc/1:1/w_160/06681b5d.jpg,2008-02-20 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11142-mission-control/,ATO,"Originality is overrated. Indeed, there's something pleasantly, comfortably, even lovingly familiar about just about every last element of Mission Control, the second album by Athens, Georgia's the Whigs. A riff there, a crash here, a little bit of purloined melody there, a little bit of swagger here. Taken as a whole, however, the disc adds up to... OK, so it basically adds up to latter day Local H, redux. But it's hard to fault the Whigs for trying, since they try so damn hard. The secret to the (conditional) success of Mission Control is that the band tackles every last rock'n'roll beat (both literal and figurative) with maximum energy and enthusiasm, mashing rock's rich history, both mainstream and underground, all together into a sharp power-pop collage. Typically, that's the kind of approach that gets bands signed to desperate and easily impressed majors-- enthusiasm over talent-- and indeed Mission Control marks the group's first album for Dave Matthews ATO imprint. But in the Whigs' case more than a little bit of honest to goodness hard work played into the equation: non-stop touring, good buzz, and most of all the satisfying feeling of calories well burnt. In fact, one of the most lasting pleasures of the disc is the sense that the Whigs left the studio each day drenched in sweat-- band and board alike. Expertly and very loudly produced by Rob Schnapf, there's not a track on Mission Control that isn't primed for maximum impact, not in the slick spit-and-polish sense but in the explosive sense. Yet for all its intensity, the album's hardly intense. The group's pop instincts are simply too strong, and if the studio magic threatens to steamroll right over the tunes, the band confidently holds its own. Pixies, late-period Replacements, Spoon on steroids-- these are just a few more touchstones for the openers ""Like a Vibration"" and ""Production City"", songs that showcase Parker Gispert's perfectly rough rock voice and in particular Julian Dorio's indomitable drums (here paired with a couple of strong stand-in bassists while the group's lineup was in flux). But familiarity in this case is no grounds for discontent, especially since the Whigs never resort to pastiche. Everything about the slight breather ""Sleep Sunshine""-- from the waltz time to the keyboard intro to the slide guitar-- rings a bell, but the band makes the confection work. Same thing for the 1960s jangle of ""Hot Bed"" or the huge wall of guitars and pounding drums that comprise ""Right Hand On My Heart"", or the hooky quiet/loud dynamism of ""I Got Ideas"". It takes cojones to do this stuff as if no one has ever done it before, but you've got to respect the outcome, and, over-the-top or not, at least Mission Control doesn't fuck around. Like some big car-driving bad seed pulling up outside the high school, it's an easy album to fall for.","You've heard it all before, but that doesn't stop the Whigs from playing as if you've got virgin ears here on their second album.

Lust Lust Lust,The Raveonettes,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b4b4ea9e61561daa6cc1/1:1/w_160/2d480250.jpg,2008-02-20 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11184-lust-lust-lust/,Vice,"Lust Lust Lust is best heard loud loud loud. At a medium volume, it loses vitality. Any lower and it's a complete waste of time. Sune Rose Wagner and Sharin Foo's twisted update on early rock riffs and Jesus and Mary Chain distortion was built for intensity, and when cranked up to speaker-rattling levels, that agenda is clear. Granted, any album would gain new (and not necessarily pleasing) power at exaggerated volumes, but Lust Lust Lust sounds specifically engineered for eardrum-exploding impact. The few instruments-- guitar, drums, bass, guitar, synths, vocals, and guitar-- all bleed together into an aggressively trebly jangle, Wagner's riffs and waves of distortion washing over you like a bad trip. Lust Lust Lust is the Raveonettes' third full-length, and on first spin, it might sound like a step backwards. Their previous effort, 2005's Pretty in Black, was a look-at-me effort that scrubbed the grime off their past work and expanded the duo into a full band with guests like Mo Tucker and Ronnie Spector. But it also proved the Raveonettes don't clean up very well; they're most presentable when they're not presentable, so the return to distortion is a welcome regression. Lust Lust Lust relies less heavily on the early-rock influences that informed the 2002 EP Whip It On! and 2003's Chain Gang of Love, as the Raveonettes have learned to better integrate them into a fuller arsenal of sounds. Opener ""Aly Walk With Me"" is the record's best argument for maximum volume. Over a coldly steady heartbreak-stroll drumbeat, Wagner and Foo chant verses between eruptions of scalding guitar distortion. ""Aly, walk with me in my dreams/ All through the night,"" they sing in dead-eyed harmony. Part wet-dream manifesto, part invocation to a soiled muse, the track makes an ideal introduction into the gutter world of Lust Lust Lust, where Foo's gauzy vocals rise out of the din and where desire can seriously fuck with your color registration. What makes the Raveonettes so compelling-- and what elevates their nostalgia above pure gimmickry-- is their refusal to separate sex from drugs from rock'n'roll. They're all the same sin, and all worthy of the same distortion. ""You Want the Candy"" disguises its sordidness (""tastes so sweet makes good love bad"") with sugary pop hooks that might have you believe Wagner means ""candy"" literally. The Raveonettes usually sound best when they play fast: ""Blush"", ""Dead Sound"", and ""Blitzed"" rush by on Foo's shoegaze/girl-group vocals, synths that sparkle like stars over slums, and Wagner's back-alley Silvertone approximation, quickening the pace as they convey barely contained excitement of some dark need. But slower songs like ""Expelled From Love"" and ""Sad Transmission"" allow Wagner to play around a little more, crafting pulsing beats from a drum machine or a guitar and translating old styles into new contexts. In the past, Wagner has held himself to certain restrictions as a means of sonically defining a release: On Whip It On! the Raveonettes played all their songs in the key of B-flat minor using only three chords. For Chain Gang of Love, they switched to B-flat major. On Lust Lust Lust, there are no stated restrictions, just the unavoidable limitations of one guy playing only a few instruments. Wagner can only get so many sounds out of this array, so even at 12 well-sequenced tracks (14 counting the U.S. edition's two bonus tracks), the album occasionally seems overlong and repetitive, not because the songs are weak but because not every one of them shows us something new. A case could be made that this musical dynamic mirrors the machinations of desire, as Lust Lust Lust details the many ways that good love can grow stale, with or without new things to want. But really, for the most part these shortcomings can be drowned out with sheer volume.",,7.4,
The Golden Age,American Music Club,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a11e13d197565213855a/1:1/w_160/889aca59.jpg,2008-02-20 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11185-the-golden-age/,Merge,"In 2004, American Music Club returned from a 10-year hiatus to release Love Songs for Patriots, an angry wartime record that occasionally abandoned their usual palette of soft grays and browns for a fiery-red crunch. On smoldering rockers like ""Ladies and Gentlemen"" and ""Patriot's Heart"", AMC's Mark Eitzel was a bar-stool prophet calling the nation to account for its moral hypocrisies and empty promises. These polemics, rendered as character sketches, were softened by the profound empathy the singer displayed toward his subjects. Four years later, we're still at war, and like many of us, Eitzel seems to have found his anger shading into weariness. There are still flashes of bile: ""The Sleeping Beauty"" makes time, amid its autumnal romanticism, to fire a potshot at ""the bankers, the liars, and the thieves"" that ""want to sell you into a life of fear,"" while on ""The Dance"", a cop's sunglasses ""show the world who's on the winning team."" But by and large, The Golden Age is a relentlessly interior record, from the contemplative nature of its quiet arrangements to its dreamy, sentimental lyrics. Besides exceptionality and archetypal purity, golden ages are typified by brevity. As such, AMC's The Golden Age is appropriately obsessed with the hemorrhaging of time; many songs here find Eitzel grasping at the stuff even as it spurts through his fingers. ""It's hard to love when you only see the dust,"" he mopes amid the wistful acoustic arpeggios of ""All My Love"". Eitzel's view of life as something one snatches from death's clutches, bit by bit, is the motif that drives the album. ""Time is a current that only flows from warm hands to warm heart,"" he asserts on the darkly rushing ""Decibels and Little Pills"", after observing that ""names are only good for grave stones."" It's undeniable that, as a lyricist, Eitzel works in homilies and clichés. ""The Sleeping Beauty"" finds him driving over the dead leaves of a southern town, watching someone wave goodbye in his rearview mirror. On ""The Stars"", a monochromatic dirge with a prismatic rock chorus, he sings, ""We marry our fear/ But what makes the night not so deep/ Is someone watching over us/ While we sleep."" And on ""Who You Are"", he offers, ""I'm stuck in my confusion/ I hope you'll go far/ You're chased by the horizon/ Because you know who you are."" Frankly, these lyrics might be intolerable if melodrama were Eitzel's thing. But his gruff gentility, and his masterful command of his voice, redeems them. In going for the soft-sell, the light touch with the heavy sentiment, Eitzel doesn't try to make more of his truisms than they are, letting their time-worn wisdom carry their own weight. It's the same story with the music: AMC works a deceptively simplistic vein of shadowy Americana, characterized by seductive blurs of acoustic guitar, twinkling leads, and circular compositions that complement the album's obsession with the wheel of time. There's just enough variation to keep it from being homogeneous: ""The John Berchman Victory Choir"" proceeds as a series of pauses and flourishes, breaking the album's metronomic regularity; the organ-fueled ""All the Lost Souls Welcome You to San Francisco"" (one of a pair of picturesque odes to Eitzel's hometown) bounces instead of slinking; and ""The Windows on the World"", a character-driven meditation on the tourist's urge to scale great heights, sloshes woozily. American Music Club's central values-- humility, self-effacement through musical understatement, sentimental candor-- may be currently out of fashion, but The Golden Age proves that, handled with care, they never truly go out of style.",,7.7,
In Field & Town,Hayden,by: Robbie Mackey,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b47e13d197565213ab03/1:1/w_160/14928d41.jpg,2008-02-19 06:00:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11138-in-field-town/,Hardwood,"For a guy who can count five records of unapologetic sad-sacking to his name, Canadian husky Paul Hayden Desser sure has a cumbersome time with his chosen subject matter on In Field & Town, an album primarily concerned with-- nope, no surprises here-- a failed relationship. The snag: While past releases allowed Hayden to hang his hat on the fresh embers of harsh breaks, or the occasional song about Alan Balling for a sixteen-year-old, the mostly-yawn greys of the doomed romance he eulogizes here don't offer much in the way of inspiration. ""Take it easy, it's what we need to do now,"" Desser sings on the album-opening title track. What he means, of course, is a break. And considering the even-keeled delivery, and the songs that follow, nobody seems to argue with his reasoning. Which is either fodder for an interesting look at the death knell of a relationship, or the making of a totally boring break-up record. Hint: it's the latter. Hayden's depiction of restless bedmates (""The Hardest Part""), lying just to get caught (""Did I Wake Up Beside You?""), and oops, we-made-a-mistake incongruity (""More Than Alive"") ring hollow throughout. So, understandably, the only song that doesn't focus on romance is the strongest. ""Lonely Security Guard"", a narrative about underestimating an origami-loving rent-a-cop (no, really), acts mostly like ""Bass Song Part 2"", complete with the line ""so I grabbed the first thing that I saw,"" and a protagonist who spends at least part of the run-time laid out on the floor. Musically, In Field & Town often eschews the proven strength of Desser-plus-guitar(-plus-harmonica) for sagging, if competently arranged, flesh-outs. ""Worthy of Your Esteem"" is a whirring synth-led pulse not far from the stuff Dave Bazan filled his last Pedro The Lion record with. Meanwhile, ""Where and When"" is a scuttling guitar strum set against insistent drums, and big, uncharacteristically prominent bass hustle. Sure, he's dabbled in this territory before, only with much more compelling material to back it up. Even when the album plays to Desser's strong suits, exemplified in the short, sweetness of piano-led ""The Hardest Part"", it's not enough to overcome the prevailing semi-felt-ness of the thing. Such a problem that it curses the moments Desser actually dares to go for it, leaving his most diary-page lyrics seeming, at best, brash, and at worst, unbelievable. ""I'm going to miss how bad this has felt,"" he sings on ""Damn This Feeling"". Nu-uh. On another record, it would seem old hat. Here, too left-field not to peg as melodrama. And that's the problem: after years of high highs and lower lows, such a flatline seems, well, pretty boring.","Canadian singer-songwriter Paul Hayden Desser continues to probe the minutiae of failed relationships, this time with a slightly fleshier sound.

60 Watt Kid,60 Watt Kid,by: Stuart Berman,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b474b1335d7bf169a75a/1:1/w_160/4eb052d6.jpg,2008-02-19 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11131-60-watt-kid/,Absolutely Kosher,"The word ""schizo"" is an oft-invoked music-critic term used as easy short-hand to describe sudden shifts in style and structure, or deliberate genre-hopping eclecticism. But if we are going to appropriate the name of a debilitating mental disorder simply to quantify an artist's musical whims, best to apply it to a band that actually sounds like two split personalities fighting for control over the same vessel, where the songs share a certain elemental consistency but behave in markedly different ways. By that measure, San Francisco trio 60 Watt Kid are certifiably schizo. Every song on the band's debut utilizes the same rudiments-- reverbed guitar ripples, distorted organ drones, spare tambourine-rattled rhythms and frontman Kevin Litrow's mantric incantations-- but their interaction produces two distinct outcomes: serene, psychedelic reveries and sleazy garage skronk. Litrow is at least self-aware enough to recognize his band's internal contradictions; as he sings at the outset of one song: ""I've been thinking of things that confuse me."" But it's this very sense of bewilderment that keeps you intrigued even throughout this lengthy, 14-song debut's more ponderous passages, to see if 60 Watt Kid's dichotomous dispositions eventually work toward a peaceful reconciliation. And peace does seem to be the end goal here, if the album's best and most fully realized song is anything to go by: The eight-minute ""Ocsicnarf Nas"" is a marvel of sustained, slow-release euphoria, its glistening guitar trembles and tribal drum builds working together to send Litrow's indecipherably echo-drenched vocals skyward in triumph. But the song's entrancing effect is immediately shattered by the first installment of the two-part ""American Standard"", an excerpt from what sounds like an endless ""Sister Ray""-style organ grind, wherein Litrow assumes the megaphoned voice of a mad auctioneer barker. It's a pattern that repeats itself throughout the album's duration: ""Chem Trials""-- a similarly styled and, as such, somewhat less striking companion to ""Ocsicnarf Nas""-- is rudely up-ended by the broke-down blues of ""Need a Job"", which sounds like something Jon Spencer might sing to himself in the welfare line, complete with affected fat-Elvis drawl; the lighter-waving Floydian psych-folk anthem ""The Road"" works itself up into a cacophonous freak-out to set up the throat-shredding, ""96 Tears"" garage-slop of ""I Got Money"". Perhaps these jarring juxtapositions are 60 Watt Kid's comment on modern life, where dreams of escape are inevitably undermined by the harsh, day-to-day realities of trying to make rent. Or maybe they simply can't figure out if they want to be Animal Collective or the Blues Explosion. But the album's conclusion suggests they may not have to make a decision: Following a suitably sodden last-call shanty called ""The End of the War"", 60 Watt Kid get on with peace process, in the form of a hidden-track instrumental jam that finds the band's dreamy organ swirls and gutter-blues grittiness coalescing into a steady, motorik motion-- one that proves the difference between 60 Watt Kid's split personalities is really just a function of whether they're taking bong hits in the basement or gas-huffing in the garage.","This San Francisco trio sounds like two split personalities fighting for control over the same vessel, like the Being John Malkovich of indie.

Suuto Breakor,Afrirampo,by: Mike Orme,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b4765e6ef959693225ee/1:1/w_160/122d53a3.jpg,2008-02-19 06:00:03,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11133-suuto-breakor/,P-Vine,"If you've ever bought a Japanese import CD, you've probably encountered the obi strip. It's a little slip of paper folded around the spine of the CD case on which the price and CD information are printed, and it's highly sought after by collectors to prove the authenticity of their import purchases. Obi strips often include marketing phrases, similar to the shrink-wrap sticker you see in the States and elsewhere, that can offer intriguing Japanese descriptions for music that so often has to haltingly speak for itself to the Western world. On Suuto Breakor, Osaka girl duo Afrirampo's newest disc, the message is pretty clear, if roughly translated: ""Forty-plus minute long trip song! In the lost forest, the swirling comet appears! Hey everyone, come play in the same forest as Afrirampo!"" This zany missive is sort of a statement of purpose for the twentysomething pair Oni and Pikachu, who have become famous thanks to a mixture of humorous noise and dangerous chaos. The girls have played varying shades of old-school Borebox-inspired ""idiot-rock"" since their inception in 2002, their guitar and drums enduring heavy punishment and their voices rising to banshee level and then to whisper in a breath-beat. Their eccentric, batshit-crazy ramblings have attracted such fans as Acid Mothers Temple, who has recorded with Afrirampo multiple times, as well the Boredoms, Sonic Youth, and Lighting Bolt, who have all taken the girls out on tour. As mentioned, Suuto Breakor is basically one 42-minute song, but it's broken into seven discrete parts. As ""1"" skitters to a start, it seems business as usual for Oni and Pikachu, drunken slide guitar entering with nonverbal chants from the girls. But somehow the pair end up settling down into a more centered kind of groove than they've really ever played before. By the time ""2"" enters the picture, it's clear that Suuto Breakor tempers the loose, fierce, and generally chaotic noise-mongering by piercing into melodic spaces reminiscent of their contemporaries OOIOO. Suuto Breakor is an especially tuneful record; it might also be their most focused. At no point do the girls scream at the top of their lungs, and only briefly does Pikachu bash on the drums, as she is prone to do, as hard as she fucking can. Between the serenely arpeggiated guitar of ""5"" and the spare jungle drums of ""2"" (accompanied by some Seadrum-esque piano), Oni manages to actually communicate a fully-formed melody. The climax of the CD is found on tracks six and seven, where the girls establish a sing-song melody that rises and falls to a sweet little guitar riff. Interviews with the pair are always a little baffling. The girls tend to act a bit off-the-wall and salty to interviewers, (Q: ""What are your hobbies?"" A: ""DRINKING""), but they also front this ineffable sincerity towards their music, and seem to practice some form of feel-good feminism (""Woman never die!!""). Oni and Pika seem determined to keep any questions of their values, even their actual humanity, at arm's length. But it's certain that whatever random forest they managed to land in, whichever backwoods tract they've managed to spiral down into, it really wouldn't be a bad idea to track out there and learn a bit about whatever random-ass philosophical truths they've obviously already figured out and serenely communicate on this album.","The latest from the Japanese ""idiot-rock"" duo who have become famous thanks to a mixture of humorous noise and dangerous chaos.

"The Best of the Johnny Cash TV Show, 1969-1971",Johnny Cash,by: Amanda Petrusich,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b4bb13d197565213ab5d/1:1/w_160/44848852.jpg,2008-02-19 06:00:02,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11191-the-best-of-the-johnny-cash-tv-show-1969-1971/,ColumbiaLegacy,"Between 1969 and 1971, Johnny Cash spent his Saturday nights hosting a variety show for ABC. ""The Johnny Cash Show"" was shuffled in as a summer replacement for another song-and-skit show, ""The Hollywood Palace"", and featured Cash and his touring company: His wife June Carter, various members of the Carter Family, Carl Perkins, the Tennessee Three, the Statler Brothers, and a series of rotating guest stars (beginning, rather auspiciously, with the camera-loving Bob Dylan). Each of its 58 episodes were shot before a live audience in Nashville's legendary Ryman Auditorium, the former home of the Grand Ole Opry. It was the first network television show ever produced out of Nashville. At the time, Cash was hitting his popular and personal apex: At Folsom Prison had enjoyed a remarkable 92-week run on the pop charts, a Grammy (Best Male Country Vocal) gleamed on his mantle, he was newly married, he was sober and devout. Johnny Cash was a rehabilitated outlaw, a Christian, a husband, a real, earnest American. And for home viewers in 1969, Cash was a welcome antidote to flag-draped coffins. A 2xDVD best-of featuring 66 of the show's musical performances was released in September; the punctuated CD version features 16 songs, including nine that didn't make the cut for the DVDs. The Best of the Johnny Cash TV Show is a remarkable collection, featuring live performances by Cash's country peers (Waylon Jennings, Bobby Bare, George Jones, Tammy Wynette, Kris Kristofferson) and, perhaps more compellingly, tracks from folk, pop, and rock superstars (Ray Charles, Joni Mitchell, Roy Orbison, Derek and the Dominoes). The CD's production is impressively fluid, given the source material (8-track reels operating at half-capacity, recorded from scattershot stage mics), and was lovingly remixed and remastered after the tapes were pulled from Cash's personal vault. Some of the best bits include the pre-song banter-- before Waylon Jennings performs ""Brown-Eyed Handsome Man"", the former roommates rib each other gently: ""He was my cook,"" Jennings explains. ""Can you imagine Johnny Cash in a black suit with baking powder all the way down and gravy in the hair?"" ""I was a good cook,"" Cash retorts. ""You couldn't do nothing."" Ray Charles' rich, sultry rendition of ""Ring of Fire"" is stunning, riddled with organ, piano, and brash horns; Charles' transforms the song from an obtuse acoustic tale into high drama. Joni Mitchell duets with Cash on ""Girl From the North Country"" (ironically, the same song Dylan performed for the show's opening night), while Cash and Lynn Anderson kick out a sprightly version of Geoff Mack's ""I've Been Everywhere"". Still, Cash's rendition of Carl Perkins' ""Daddy Sang Bass"" is the record's highlight. The track, which, occasionally dips into the Carter Family's legendary ""Will the Circle Be Unbroken?"", works as a parable for the entire two-season run of ""The Johnny Cash Show"", with Cash intoning: ""We'd get together in a family circle, singing loud/ Daddy sang bass, Momma sang tenor/ And me and little brother would join right in there/ Cause singing seems to help a troubled soul."" Although anyone who's checked out the DVDs will find themselves maniacally restructuring the track list (it's not hard to assume that the label wanted a hook to get fans to buy both documents, padding the CD with a handful of second-tier, if still outstanding, cuts), The Best of the Johnny Cash Show is still a tough testament to the grand fluidity of American music. Cash acted as a perfect conduit for cross-genre pollination, and the class, race, gender, and regional divisions that plagued America in the late 1960s are rendered perfectly irrelevant here.","Columbia/Legacy continues to mine the vaults of the short-lived variety program ""The Johnny Cash Show"" by following a 2xDVD best-of featuring 66 of the show's musical performances with this 16-song punctuated CD version. Among those featured are Cash, his wife June Carter, Ray Charles, George Jones, and Joni Mitchell.

Let the Blind Lead Those Who Can See But Cannot Feel,Atlas Sound,by: Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b498c0084474cd0c22ce/1:1/w_160/009d410b.jpg,2008-02-19 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11160-let-the-blind-lead-those-who-can-see-but-cannot-feel/,Kranky,"Bradford Cox spent the summer he was 16 in a children's hospital having multiple surgeries on his chest and back. His condition, Marfan syndrome, has proven difficult to separate from his music. Cox's lost summer hangs over his songs, and his gawky physique has been the dress-draped centerpiece of his band's confrontational live shows. At the same time, he can also be defensive about his appearance, using it to explain why his music's detractors are sometimes as hyperbolic as his most fervent admirers. Thousands of words later, other music critics still ask me what I could possibly like in Cox's work. Cox plays and sings in Atlanta five-piece Deerhunter, but it's tempting to say he actually lives as Atlas Sound. He's used the name for his solo recordings ever since the sixth grade, and lately his output has been almost nonstop: He's posted roughly 70 new tracks, mostly originals, on his blog since last July. Deerhunter's Cryptograms and Fluorescent Grey EP expertly brought together elements of krautrock, psych, shoegaze, ambient, post-punk, and indie rock, but Atlas Sound's full-length debut turns inward from that band's high-volume squall. Cox also trades the four-track of previous Atlas Sound vinyl splits for a laptop. The result is a gauzy bedroom pop album that drifts from ambient bliss-outs to sadsack avant-garage, from hospitals to heartache, as if passing through different stages of sleep on a sunny afternoon. No previous interest in Deerhunter required. Cox spent the summer he was 25 touring and recording Let the Blind Lead Those Who Can See But Cannot Feel. But the fears of nine years earlier stalk the album's corridors. Opener ""A Ghost Story"" sets a hissy sample of a young boy clumsily narrating over the fluorescent hum of treated, sampled glockenspiel. Childhood innocence gives way to to adolescent confusion on the waltz-like ""Recent Bedroom"", as a music box crashes headlong into squiggly guitars and bustling percussion. A Zimbabwean instrument called a mbira and some bells from Ghana waft through guitars and collaged drums on ""Quarantined"", a song that evokes both children's hospitals and a sense of unresolved metamorphosis: ""I am waiting to be changed."" By the time of his summer in the hospital, Cox had already met Deerhunter guitarist Lockett Pundt, to whom he dedicated this album. A sample of Pundt's slender, bouncing guitar lick forms the basis of seventh cut ""Cold as Ice"", the way a Flamingos or Lionel Richie snippet might become a track by the Field, although Cox adds his own frail tenor and jangling tambourine along with a driving beat. The first half of the album watches the world from afar, but from here on, Cox's narrator directly addresses an unattainable love interest. The difference between the album's halves is clear from just its catchiest few songs. On what would be side A, the clipped drum rolls and treated harps of ""River Card"" can't make the object of Cox's doomed whispers (""River so clear and blue/ I'm so in love with you/ But you'll drown me"") any easier to hold, just as the narrator can't cry on ""Recent Bedroom"", see his friends on ""Quarantined"", or make friends at all on ""On Guard"". Near the end of the album, though, the guitar-driven, spring reverb-drenched ""Ativan"" goes into bitterly specific detail about sleeping in while a person has ""lunch with a girl/ who takes time to listen to every single word you utter."" Two tracks earlier, ""Bite Marks"" describes self-inflicted scars-- not surgical ones-- as two guitar notes drone and buzz. Weezer's ""Only in Dreams"" probably isn't the comparison Cox would pick for his achingly nostalgic bass line, but then again, the title fits. Let the Blind's beauty is in the way the music renders Cox's plaintive themes, not in the impressionistic language he chooses to express them. The closing, instrumental title track returns to the glockenspiels from opener ""A Ghost Story"", joined by organ and mbira for a flickering, look-ma-no-drums ambient piece recalling the ""pop ambient"" of Kompakt's Gas and Markus Guentner or the psychedelic electronic space-outs of the Orb; wordless ""Ready, Set, Glow"" achieves something similar with nylon-string strums, shakers, glockenspiel, and Cox's own sampled vocals. Later, ""After Class"" reshapes Deerhunter's contribution to the recent Living Bridge compilation into another lyric-less track that builds up nicely to ""Ativan"", like a skilled DJ keeping the room on edge before a climactic break. Out of context, it's the least essential thing here, but it seems significant that the original's coda (""Strip down, strip down"") implies a release this album's lovelorn central figure never finds. When there are words, they're often simple and repetitive, or else overshadowed by the lush sonics. The chiming prettiness and misty vocals of Kraftwerk via Ralf & Florian's ""Tanzmusik"" help set the template for more than a couple of tracks on Let the Blind, including the terse, jittery ""On Guard"". Brooklyn-via-Detroit techno-pop savant Matthew Dear would probably give up one of his pseudonyms for the way ""Winter Vacation"" merges glistening, euphoric pop with a minimal techno beat. Music boxes no longer sound so innocent on the clanging, alarm-like ""Scraping Past"", the track that will interrupt your reverie. Then again, the last thing you'll notice about ""Small Horror"" is the lyrics, but they're naked, a little naïve, and utterly human. Nothing but droning, treated guitar and Cox's crying, defeated voice, the track is a desperate plea that finds a certain hymn-like exaltation in its own sadness. ""Hold me even though you couldn't care less,"" Cox murmurs slowly. ""I woke up,"" Cox sings on both Cryptograms and Fluorescent Grey. Atlas Sound's debut ends with the protagonist going back to sleep, the dreamer dreaming. As with each of Cox's projects, Let the Blind works best as a swirling, disorienting whole, organizing traditionally abstract styles like graphic-design elements within his unifying vision until they communicate like good pop. If Cryptograms was a puzzle, Cox's latest is a cocoon. Strange as it may seem to admit, how much time you choose to spend in it could depend on how you react to Cox's persona. Those drawn to his lovesick, evolving audio presence have, like Morrissey or Belle & Sebastian obsessives, an entire world to explore. Hell, none of these 14 tracks are even on the blog.","On Deerhunter's Cryptograms and Fluorescent Grey EP, Bradford Cox helped expertly bring together elements of krautrock, psych, shoegaze, ambient, post-punk, and indie rock; on his Atlas Sound full-length debut he turns inward from that band's high-volume squall.

Circular Sounds,Kelley Stoltz,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b47cea9e61561daa6c68/1:1/w_160/747b6161.jpg,2008-02-18 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11137-circular-sounds/,Sub Pop,"Not that anyone's really asking, but the distinction between ""music blogger"" and ""music critic"" seems to fall along the lines of ""Kelley Stoltz."" Circular Sounds is proof of why he's wildly popular amongst the former, since it's a treasure trove for people who divorce mp3s from entire albums. The record seems mindfully considered with proper (if not particularly hip) sonic touchstones in mind, and it's easy to imagine Kelley Stoltz laying down the clip-clop percussion to the loping ballad ""Gardenia"" with a mile-wide grin after his thousandth listen of Pet Sounds. Whether politely rocking out or spinning something pastoral, Circular Sounds manages to come across as casual without seeming tossed-off. If could all sound good on the radio, even if you know that particular station exists in an alternate universe and probably switched over to reggaeton in 2006. You have to wonder why Stoltz insists on the innocuously self-centered act of putting his own name on his records when he's spent so much of his time trying to be someone else, whether it's Jeff Buckley (answering fan mail as one of his interns), Ian McCulloch (covering Crocodiles in its entirety), or a cavalcade of 60s icons (his last LP, Below the Branches). Even the tracks that can remotely be considered contemporary still conjure bands steeped in canon, as in the figure 8s of Elliott Smith guitar work (""Tintinnabulation"") or Spoon's brassy r(y)hthm and soul on the grating character study ""The Birmingham Eccentric"". Stoltz jokingly described the step up in production on Circular Sounds as ""mid-fi,"" about right for someone who sounds like his home studio is overrun with every instrument he's ever come across except a computer. ""Everything Begins"" scampers about with woozy horns and piano, as welcoming as it is disorienting. More than last time, the album's got enough meat and gristle during the midsection to avoid the thing being swallowed whole. The pre-disco string hits of ""Your Reverie"" are his canniest production trick yet and ""When You Forget"" supplements its vocal melodies with ringing guitar lines that avoid becoming flavorless. Yet the sum of Circular Sounds can feel impersonal, especially in how Stoltz hopscotches from voice to voice, some far stronger than others-- he doesn't have near the range to pull off the high notes on the village green waltz of ""Mother Nature"". ""Put My Troubles To Sleep"", a ""what if?"" proposition of Damon Albarn covering Graham Coxon, finds Stoltz trying to cope with an empty bed with everything from tequila to counting sheep. But its impact is dulled by a fussy music hall chord progression that makes everything feel preordained instead of inspired. Even the catchiest numbers derive their impact more from earworm repetition than any sort of pristine melodic architecture. ""To Speak to the Girl"" will wind around your brain in the same manner it's composed, as in a continuous, nagging loop of the title. Waffling on Stoltz begs the question, ""What would happen if he decides to scuff his treasured record collection with some of his own grooves?"" 2007 was a great year for guys who channeled the 60s into a personal vision, but Caribou and Panda Bear did it from the mindframe of electronic music, whereas Stoltz is strictly a singer-songwriter. Desiring a Kelley Stoltz record with no outside artistic guidance is to wish for something that probably doesn't exist, so once again Circular Sounds renders Stoltz a non-entity, subject to your expectations alone.","Whether politely rocking out or spinning something pastoral, Kelley Stoltz and his new album, Circular Sounds, manage to come across as casual without seeming tossed-off.

Anyone who reads his blog knows that the 47-year-old legend spends his days working out, writing music, and enjoying the benefits of being comfortably out in Washington D.C.'s gay community. Though you may prefer to remember him shredding on the First Avenue stage with Hüsker Dü, he looks back on that time without much pleasure. In fact, in commemoration of the 20th anniversary of the band's dissolution, he recently posted his resignation letter, with commentary: ""Freedom, sweet freedom! One of my best decisions ever. The end of one trip, the beginning of an amazing journey."" Though he's resumed playing electric guitar on tour, for five years one of his main gigs has been running a D.C. dance event called Blowoff, which expanded to New York last year. (He recently described it as a ""really sexy party"" to a D.C. gay magazine.) Long reticent to make details of his private life public, Mould has opened up and is finally happy. So, what does this mean for his music? Unfortunately, on District Line he has largely abandoned the snappy, acerbic poetry that characterized the first decades of his catalog in favor of rambling journal entries. ""The shape shifting, weightlifting,"" he sings on the chorus-less ""Who Needs To Dream?"" ""Hope the presentation will catch his eye/ And it did, and then he saw the string/ He grabbed it and leads you on your leash/ You offered it up/ So don't blame anyone but yourself."" Angsty-sounding song titles like ""Return to Dust"" betray Hallmark sentiments: ""True blue star/ Would you stay in my heart/ Or will you fool me once again?"" ""Old Highs, New Lows""'s lyrics seem lifted from a note passed between junior high students: ""We lock the gaze tightly upon each other/ No others come near, no others come between."" That said, Fugazi drummer Brendan Canty is again along for the ride, and District Line hits all the right rock touchstones. The tempered, driving guitar bliss of ""Return to Dust"" sounds like a File Under Easy Listening outtake, while ""Walls In Time""-- the album's six-minute, acoustic, heart-on-sleeve closer-- actually is a Workbook outtake. Meanwhile, ""Stupid Now"" is that head-banging jock-jam Mould's fans have been craving during his poison, er, electronic years. Indeed, much of the club music influence that informed Modulate and Long Playing Grooves has been eliminated here, although there are hints of vocoder and snippets of synth. Like Mould's previous disc, Body of Song, District Line contains one out-and-out dance track, ""Shelter Me"", which could be described as a great club track for people who don't like going to clubs. If only Mould weren't so gosh-dang happy, this might be an essential album. It's not that it lacks tension -- indeed, almost every song touches on relationship strife-- it's just that the squabbles are gentle, the rage subdued. ""Watch me walk the ledge, I am comfortable out here by myself,"" he sings on ""Again and Again"". Sure, he's contemplating suicide, but he's * comfortable* doing it. Sheesh.","The former Hüsker Dü frontman has largely abandoned the snappy, acerbic poetry that characterized the first decades of his catalog in favor of rambling journal entries; still, with Fugazi drummer Brendan Canty again along for the ride, he manages to hit all the right rock touchstones.

This Gift,Sons and Daughters,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b46cea9e61561daa6c4c/1:1/w_160/ad650332.jpg,2008-02-18 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11124-this-gift/,Domino,"On their past two releases, Scotland's Sons & Daughters staked out a unique sound built around tense rhythm, static harmony, hints of Scottish folk, and strong male/female spoken/sung vocal interplay. On This Gift, they give back a bit of that distinctive ground, more frequently adopting a more conventional rock approach, while Adele Bethel moves into more of a frontwoman role, taking nearly every note of lead vocals. Scott Paterson, who once played deadpan foil to Bethel with his dry lead vocals, is now mostly focused on the guitar and backing vocals. This doesn't compromise the band's quality much, though-- it just gives them a somewhat different look that's backed up by slightly brighter production from ex-Suede guitarist Bernard Butler. In fact, I'd say that if anything, re-structuring their approach has given them a bit more songwriting leeway, and this album has bigger choruses and better riffs than its predecessor, 2006's Repulsion Box. One thing it doesn't have, though, is any kind of lower gear-- the band is pretty much all-out the whole way, which can be a little tiring. Even places where they let you think they're dialing back, like the wispy, piano-backed intro to ""Split Lips"", soon give way to fast tempos led by David Gow's aggressive drums. While they've given up some of the folk dual lead elements that were once their calling cards, they have hit on a unique way of adding memorable choruses to their songs, augmenting the chorus lyrics with big, melodic phrases built around simple words like ""yeah"" or non-words like ""oh"" and ""ah."" It sounds simple, but they make some huge hooks harmonizing on ""oohs"" and ""aahs."" These bigger hooks play into the overall streamlining of their sound, and it's not hard to imagine a few of these songs crossing over. ""Darling"" has a bit of a ""Town Called Malice"" feel to it (albeit at a much higher tempo), with Bethel's layered vocals creating the band's poppiest texture yet. The band wraps it up with one of its best songs yet, the fuzzed-out rocker ""Goodbye Service"", which backs Bethel up with little falsetto harmonies and makes the most out of the sour tone of Paterson's guitar-- it's like a harder update on something that could have come out of Boston in 1968, and there's even a psychedelic breakdown. It's a good closer for such a loud and propulsive album, an LP that finds the band no worse for the wear after modifying its sound to go more directly for the jugular. The biggest critique is that as an album, This Gift is perhaps too far in the red too much of the time, but even that complaint is tempered by the fact that the ride is so good.","After building a sound built around tense rhythm, static harmony, hints of Scottish folk, and strong male/female spoken/sung vocal interplay, Sons & Daughters deliver a slightly more traditional record.

Jesus of Cool,Nick Lowe,by: Matt LeMay,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b4b313d197565213ab4c/1:1/w_160/74c9771b.jpg,2008-02-18 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11183-jesus-of-cool/,Yep RocRadarYep RocRadar,"In Jesus of Cool's iconic cover image, Nick Lowe appears decked out in a smorgasbord of over-the-top rockstar getups. These images are perfectly considered, down to the facial hair stylings and thematically appropriate guitars-- but Lowe comes off goofy and unconvincing in every guise. The cover images are apt not for their evocation of ""cool,"" but rather for their combination of impeccable artifice and raw, gawkish charm. Indeed, Jesus of Cool sounds more like the work of a crafty fan than that of a self-serious auteur. Thankfully, Lowe's fandom was quite broad; Jesus of Cool is equal parts shimmering disco and dingy pub, with frequent surprisingly coherent stylistic asides. That this record came out in 1978 is nothing short of a small miracle; while punk rock and disco were battling it out in an all-too-familiar dialogue of authenticity and reactionism, Lowe cut the crap and made a clever, fierce, and far-reaching record. Chalk it up, perhaps, to the degree and nature of Lowe's experience; by the time he set about recording Jesus of Cool, Lowe was already a veteran of the decidedly more populist pub rock scene. Though Jesus of Cool is technically his debut, Lowe was already the elder statesman and in-house producer for the fledgling Stiff Label, positioning himself as the clever and detached pop craftsman to protégé Elvis Costello's angsty, spittle-flecked firebrand. Fans of Costello's early records, or those of the Damned, will find the sonics of Jesus of Cool immediately familiar. Recorded largely on borrowed studio time at a variety of locations, Jesus of Cool covers a lot of ground fidelity-wise, but is aptly produced throughout. The album's more polished cuts are studio-immaculate, and its rockers are gritty and packed full of energy, demonstrating the production style that earned Lowe the nickname ""Basher"". Lowe certainly knew well enough to avoid trying to make a straight-up pandering pop record, and his experience in the record business is written all over Jesus of Cool, in the words of songs like ""Music for Money"" and ""Shake and Pop"", and in the album's overall feel and conceit. These flip-offs at the record industry underscore the album's unerring ease and strength. Perhaps Lowe's deep familiarity with the ins and outs of the business cured him of the something-to-prove overzealousness that kills many records this ambitious. Indeed, Jesus of Cool comes across with little to no agenda; it draws from a wide and diverse pool of influences, but never in a way that seems showy or forced. Backed by an all-star cast of friends and contemporaries, many of whom shared time with Lowe in pub rock legends Brinsley Schwarz, Lowe tries on many different vocal personas on Jesus, cooing the ballad ""Tonight"" and barking the new wave stomper ""Music for Money"". Early singles ""So It Goes"" and ""I Love the Sound of Breaking Glass"" are highlights, remarkable for both their strength and for their disparity. ""So It Goes"" is driving, chiming melodic rock, while ""I Love the Sound of Breaking Glass"" is piano-tickled disco-pop. The diversity of Jesus of Cool helps keep even its weaker tracks sounding unique and interesting; the slightly reggae-toned ""No Reason"" and dark, synthesized ""36 Inches High"" would be distracting detours on a more myopic record, but make perfect sense in this context. Jesus of Cool has been sadly out of print for years, and Yep Roc's reissue is impeccable. The complex digipak fold-out is beautiful, and Will Birch's liner notes do a great job of explaining the record's origins without falling into hyperbole. The bonus tracks here are generally quite good as well, not surprising considering the singles-y feel of the album itself. ""Rollers Show"" and ""They Called It Rock"" (a reworking of ""Shake and Pop"" that lacks the album cut's gritty force) were both included on the U.S. release of Jesus of Cool (retitled Pure Pop for Now People for more sensitive U.S. audiences), and their inclusion here is welcome. Other highlights include an early version of Lowe's sole U.S. hit ""Cruel to be Kind"", the hilarious ""I Love My Label"", and a cover of Martha Sharp's ""Born a Woman"" from 1977's The Bowi EP. As guitar pop music comes back into fashion among indie rockers, more and more albums are sounding like awkward and self-aware approximations of the very thing that Jesus of Cool does so effortlessly. In a sense, Lowe's unpretentious inclusiveness may have stopped Jesus of Cool just short of becoming a huge record in any one world; the album is far too unabashedly admiring of pop music to be seen as a punk rock classic, but too gritty and ramshackle to be considered a seminal new wave pop record. Thankfully, Jesus of Cool is a rarer thing still: a timeless and bullshit-free masterpiece.","Equal parts shimmering disco and dingy pub, with frequent surprisingly coherent stylistic asides, Nick Lowe's clever, fierce, and far-reaching 1978 album is re-released with a handful of well-chosen bonus tracks and some exquisite packaging.

Heretic Pride,The Mountain Goats,by: Zach Baron,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b4b1b1335d7bf169a7ad/1:1/w_160/bfac79cc.jpg,2008-02-18 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11181-heretic-pride/,4AD,"The Mountain Goats' John Darnielle has written songs about speed-freaks, drug-dealing high school running backs, short-time jail inmates, big rabbits, debt collectors, garden-seed salesmen, bootleggers, alcoholics, and attic-dwellers. In the whole lot, the only honest man Darnielle ever bothered writing about was himself. We Shall All Be Healed, The Sunset Tree, and Get Lonely-- his last three albums-- were the autobiographical invocations he'd staved off for over a decade and some 400 songs. Since 2004, he's been his own only subject, after 12 years of avoiding a biography full of sharp objects. ""As you all know,"" Darnielle used to say from stage, ""I don't write songs about myself."" On Heretic Pride, his newest, the ""I"" is once again someone else: hopeless urchins, spies from China, a girl in a Marduk t-shirt, a young father, a kid in a Marcus Allen jersey, H.P. Lovecraft in Brooklyn, a reggae singer with a bullet hole in his chest. The antic, hammering thrum of the Mountain Goats' tape-grind era-- before the finer arrangements, the ornamentation, the orchestration of the band's first four 4AD releases-- returns. As before, John Vanderslice and Scott Solter produce. Old usual suspects Peter Hughes, Franklin Bruno, and the Bright Mountain Choir are re-enlisted. St. Vincent's Annie Clark, Erik Friedlander, and Superchunk's Jon Wurster are sworn in. Darnielle wrote songs in Fairbanks, Seattle, San Franscisco, and Durham; their subjects stray as far as the Xinjiang Province, Spanish Town, East Berlin. Darnielle's characters are back where they know best. They join cults (""New Zion""), huddle together in cars (""So Desperate"") or gather in smoke-filled rooms (""In the Craters of the Moon""). Many do not survive. ""Spoiler Alert!"" reads the characteristically bombastic liner note to ""Heretic Pride"": ""The main character here will not live long after he gets done lauding his imminent demise."" What a difference two years makes. Get Lonely (2006) was a agonizingly introspective dissection of a dissolving relationship, the logical finale to Darnielle's trilogy of self-revelation, the final unburdening. The Mountain Goats-- champions of the low-fi, singer-songwriter-subverters-- had become scrupulously hi-fi, confessional. Gone was the guitar that played its own drums, gone was the tape-hiss, gone were the doctrinaire fans. Only you and Darnielle remained. ""When the villagers come to my door,"" he sang on Get Lonely's ""If You See Light"", ""I will hide underneath the table in the dining room, knees drawn up to my chest."" On Heretic Pride, the villagers return to find their victim no longer afraid. ""They come and pull me from my house, and they drag my body through the streets"" declares Darnielle on ""Heretic Pride"": ""I will feel so proud when the reckoning arrives."" Of all the musicians that have come and gone in the 4AD era, Superchunk's Jon Wurster is-- Peter Hughes aside-- the first to hear, and replicate, the precise, surging, and teeth-chattering headlong rhythm that is Darnielle's stock-in-trade. Behind Wurster's ""high-spirits-on-fire"" (Darnielle's phrase) four-four, ""Heretic Pride"" is the most immediate thing the Mountain Goats have done since ""The Best Ever Death Metal Band in Denton"". Elsewhere, ""Sax Rohmer #1"", ""In the Craters of the Moon"", and ""Lovecraft in Brooklyn"" are seething throwbacks-- taut, propulsive, paranoid, furious. ""Lovecraft"" imagines the writer come to Red Hook, xenophobic, terrified, filled with hate, switchblade in hand. ""Someday, something's coming from way out beyond the stars,"" snarls Darnielle. ""To kill us while we stand here."" ""San Bernadino"": the paranoia relents, the sun rises over the mountains, a young couple with a son on the way checks into a motel; the father runs a bath, scatters rose petals into the water. Composer Erik Friedlander provides the sole instrumentation, a humming cello pluck and a smeared, gorgeous chord progression. Heretic Pride is the first since The Coroner's Gambit to lack a unifying concept, but it has balance: For every furious declaration, there's a moment of uncertainty-- the unresolved lovers and muted chords of ""How to Embrace a Swamp Creature"", the neutral meeting place the two estranged people pick to reconcile in ""So Desperate"". As in most of the post-Tallahassee Mountain Goats material, Darnielle's Heretic Pride writing tends towards themes rather than details, movements rather than moments. But human beings stride through his songs once again; for every broad-stroke metaphor-- ""Autoclave"" heart-as-surgical-purifier, ""Tianchi Lake"" swamp-monster-- there's a ""Marduk Men's Room Incident"" disco-refugee, her head against the sink, trying to cool down. Heretic Pride's title is lifted from an Aura Noir's ""Black Deluge Night""-- ""Soaring demons now swarm the skies/ In awe and heretic pride,"" goes the couplet-- but Darnielle's got his own invasion stories. Sunset Tree outtake ""The Day the Aliens Came"" imagined a smoldering planet, rooftops and sidewalks ""melted like plastic,"" one man still standing: There's Darnielle, wearing Italian shoes and a white tuxedo jacket, a survivor explaining himself for the sake of the rest of us.","After three albums in which he used his songwriting gifts to examine himself, John Darnielle again turns his eye outward, here penning tunes about hopeless urchins, spies from China, a girl in a Marduk t-shirt, a young father, a kid in a Marcus Allen jersey, H.P. Lovecraft in Brooklyn, and a reggae singer with a bullet hole in his chest.

Black Habit,Rings,by: Mike Powell,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b468b1335d7bf169a741/1:1/w_160/2d7805f6.jpg,2008-02-15 06:00:05,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11120-black-habit/,Paw Tracks,"Rings are a band with their own private logic. At least, they seem like one, which constitutes about half their appeal. You could call them an ""outsider"" band, but that's indulging a fetish term-- instead, think of them as ""insider"" music: Intimate to the point of obscurity, so keenly aware of their own self-fashioned world that they ignore everything around it. The three women in the group-- keyboardist Kate Rosko, guitarist Nina Mehta, and drummer Abby Portner (sister to Dave, aka Animal Collective's Avey Tare)-- follow in a tradition of spooky post-punk that eschewed rock for reggae, dub, and folk (the Raincoats' second album, Odyshape, is an obvious touchstone; some Slits songs qualify, too). They affect naiveté because naifs exist unencumbered by their surroundings; they play like the music lies just outside of them, like it's warm and raw-- like it's the first time. Mehta's guitar lines spurt from her fingers with half-random haste and Portner pants behind like she's being dragged by her own drumkit. They all yell and it's shrill as heck. The frustrating truth about Black Habit, however pretty and enchanting and strange, is that Rings' songs sound beyond their grasp. Not because they've created something with a life of its own, but because their implicit ambition-- to make secret-sounding, powerful, hypnotic music-- outweighs their verve. When Mehta flatly yelps ""I want to be free!"" over and over in ""Scape Aside"", the mantra coaxes the band to a frenzy and almost carries them over, but instead of goddesses baying moonward, they sound like irritated girl scouts banging on the ceiling from the top bunk. ""Is He Handsome"", the most bewitching track here, is interrupted by first-take giggles. Rings are always on the tail of a vibrant eco-force, it's just that sometimes it's a monster through uncertain woods, other times it's a kitty in a living room. Black Habit has the makings of a great album, but it isn't one. It's irritating, alluring, brief, and sweetly aloof. The vocals shoot through the din like primary colors over charcoal. The crypto-sexy music clatters and tumbles, a perpetual ruffling of the feathers. There might be great moments, and there are at least half-great ones. Rings' pretense is to freedom, I guess, and it's a warranted one. They're free, and as much as I want to come with them-- an embarrassing amount-- Black Habit resonates like a preacher unconvinced by his or her own sermon; it keeps me at its threshold and stays inside itself.","Following in a tradition of spooky post-punk that eschewed rock for reggae, dub, and folk, Rings are intimate to the point of obscurity, so keenly aware of their own self-fashioned world that they ignore everything around it.

Into Abaddon,Saviours,by: Zach Baron,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b466c0084474cd0c2289/1:1/w_160/361ccb68.jpg,2008-02-15 06:00:04,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11119-into-abaddon/,Kemado,"Saviours are calling their second record Into Abaddon, but partying so hard you think you're going to die ain't exactly like entering the realm of the dead. ""We partied really hard in 2006-- it was the gnarliest time,"" singer/guitarist Austin Barber told Decibel. ""So there are songs about drugs and songs about the end of the world."" This opposed, I guess, to the time Barber and Saviours drummer Scott Batiste made a record called Syncopated Synthetic Laments for Love, in 2001, with their former emo-yelp outfit Yaphet Kotto. Of course, Laments for Love did have a gnarly locked groove that would repeat ""Bush is a dickhead"" until you picked up the stylus-- into abaddon indeed. Today Saviours talk more about ""this burning plane of Earth,"" although ""Firewake Angel""'s ""unearthed beast"" might well be how you'd describe Bush after six more years of acid tabs. Their particular corner of this burning plane remains Oakland, where bassist and Drunk Horse ax-slinger Cyrus Comiskey shares an apartment with High on Fire's Matt Pike. Into Abaddon, like 2006's Crucifire, borrows some from the Pike catalogue, speeding up the unruly weeded-out riffs Pike played in Sleep, setting them to HoF's d-beat pummel. But, like fellow hardcore vets Tragedy, Saviours still retain a kind of careening punk DNA in their sound; Batiste, lurching from one sludgy trapdoor to the next double-bass gallop, is too versed in the dynamic hurdles of his old outfits to spend much time sticking with any one part, no matter how much it might slay. It's that California Swing Kids swing, stretched out to slow motion. Since Crucifire, Barber's shaved a few registers off his voice, tarnishing it with what sounds like the most epic tour-van cold of all time. ""Into Abaddon"" shudders with rolling drum unfurlings, boozy shouts, and bearded backing vocals. ""Mystichasm"" starts out like the band's trying to pin the insufficiently faithful to an opposite wall. Chalk some of the heft here up to Melvins/Tool producer ""Evil"" Joe Barresi, who's got to be the guy responsible for the wicked low-end that bashes along during ""Cavern of Mind""'s wahed-out guitar solo. In almost every song comes that moment of payoff where Saviours clear space around Barber's ravaged throat and plummet into a howling, half-time breakdown. Barber shouts ""UNHOLY SEAL"" just as his band drops through it. Anyone familiar with the teetotaling basement-show grind out of which Saviours emerged should be able to spot how vengefully the pendulum is now swinging back. Saviours retail on Kemado, the same label as the Sword, but their greasy Motörhead appropriations have the messy punk momentum absent from the Sword's mannered, denim-clad reenactments. In Barber and Batiste's pasts are no shortage of straightedge band members and underpowered amplifiers. They're now furiously making up for both.","Oakland metal band's second album, produced by Joe Barresi (Melvins, Tool), shudders with rolling drum unfurlings, boozy shouts, and bearded backing vocals.

Rivers Arms,Balmorhea,by: Grayson Currin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b464c0084474cd0c2285/1:1/w_160/043aaccb.jpg,2008-02-15 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11117-rivers-arms/,Western Vinyl,"The 14 tracks on Rivers Arms, the second album from twenty-something Texas duo Balmorhea, sound much like the band's list of influences probably reads. For that matter, such a strong, select lexicon could be a subset of most 2007 bands making instrumental music with folk, classical, jazz, and 20th-century classical inspirations: There are the swells of Stravinsky, the mercurial keyboard majesty of Debussy, the triad-based romanticism of Arvo Pärt, the clangorous sensuality of Keith Jarrett, the electronics-meet-acoustics approach of Max Richter, and the beaming melodic flashes of the Takoma Records cartel (from John Fahey to George Winston, mind you). If those names don't mean much, think of Balmorhea as a freshman-level seminar in making pretty music that works on multiple levels. Most everyone should make it through class and carry something away, while others may use it as an inlet into deeper lessons: On the surface, Balmorhea's music is gorgeous, dynamic, and emotive, a bit like Sigur Rós with an interest in understatement. Rivers Arms combines piano, acoustic and electric guitars, banjo, strings, and samples into short passes, so that nothing's too consuming or exhausting. Though it lasts just less than an hour, Rivers Arms cycles through motifs without wasting many seconds or losing interest. A closer look, though, reveals accomplished mechanics that allow (perhaps old and familiar) influences to filter into something refreshing. Michael Muller and Rob Lowe (not the 90 Day Man/Singer/Lichen or the sex-tape teen idol/George Stephanopoulos stand-in) are Balmorhea, and they're assisted here by violinist Aisha Burns, cellist Erin Lance, and bassist Jacob Glenn-Levin. Rivers Arms charms so easily because Muller and Lowe separate and integrate so many styles and ideas in small spaces. Several songs based in ivories and bows (""Baleen Morning"", ""Barefoot Pilgrims"") hint at the dramatic climaxes of fuck-all, quiet-loud Texas post-rock. Balmorhea, though, always tug the reins just right, insuring that any incandescence doesn't torch the more journeyman guitar tracks, like the Six Organs-shadowing ""Greyish Tapering Ash"" or the Album Leaf electronics of ""Process"". The pieces fit, and the colors blend. Rivers Arms offers little in terms of technical or compositional innovation, but it does capitalize on a facet of instrumental music that's constantly suggested but rarely accomplished: Despite its often elegiac turns and always graceful maneuvers, the music here leaves itself open to individual interpretation. The songs certainly have their moods, and titles taken from seasons or places suggest inspirations and implications. But these songs never exist in a vacuum, and any dominant air always makes room for the counterpart that's just around the bend. Like ""The Winter"": All twinkling guitars, fleeting sheets of strings, and piano lines that drift downward in diagonal columns, it feels like the season it proclaims. But traces of hope flicker from twinkling guitars, lining the melancholy. The melody is handled meticulously, too, creating stillness and movement in the same space. ""The Summer"", which precedes ""The Winter"", opens with atonal cello sustains. Even though a duet of bucolic acoustic guitars eventually dances above those strings, the foreboding drones hover at the brink, threatening from a distance like a surprise Texas snow cloud. Such is Balmorhea: Texas gets a rough (if deserved) rap for its extremes, from Plano football games and their cinematic scores to obstinate world leaders and their stubborn ideas. But Balmorhea flashes brilliance only to highlight a slow-burning constancy that's at the core of one of the year's early slow wonders.","Texas duo's second album is instrumental music with folk, classical, jazz, and 20th-century classical inspirations, offering a sort of seminar in making pretty music that works on multiple levels.

Live the Storm,Disfear,by: Robbie Mackey,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b492ea9e61561daa6c8f/1:1/w_160/0d57b789.gif,2008-02-15 06:00:02,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11155-live-the-storm/,Relapse,"Some bands have all the luck: In 1998, Swedish D-beaters Disfear replaced original vocalist Jeppe Axelsson with At the Gates frontman and extreme-freelancer Tomas Lindberg. Talk about an upgrade (oldskoolers gasp!), the personnel shift gave the band the proper mouthpiece to keep up with its in-the-red pace, while basically guaranteeing extended ownership of the D-beat crown. So the entrance of Entombed guitarist Uffe Cederlund on this year's Live the Storm is almost unfair. As if anybody playing second fiddle wouldn't stoke the flames just fine, these guys went knocking on the door of the best Swedish death metal band not formed by Lindberg. Result: A death'n'roll supergroup, and one of the best heavy records of this still-young 2008. But surprisingly, the most vital newcomer on Live the Storm is behind the boards. Filling the void left by engineer Mieszko Talarczyk (the Nasum grindcore legend who died in the 2004 Tsunami, and to whom the album is dedicated), Converge guitarist and God City impresario Kurt Ballou turns in some inspiring work. Though they try repeatedly-- on the fire-breathing title track, and the propulsive speed demon ""Maps of War""-- Ballou never lets Disfear swing as low and scuzzy as they did on the dirt-sucking early stuff, or even on the Talarczyk-helmed 2003 grime-fest Misanthropic Generation. Instead, his production offers a clarity and separation that serves this bulkier version of Disfear perfectly, underscoring the band's hardcore/D-beat roots (see: barreling drum sound) without eclipsing their death metal chops (see: hefty guitar tone). But best of all, Ballou is ultra-reverent toward that joyful beer-metal bluster that creeps out whenever Lindberg and co. decide its time for a fist-pumping gang-chant. Cue half-palmed feedback. Cue pick scrapes. Cue full band hollering the lines ""A testament! Born out of desperation!"" You get the picture. Except for the extended intro on album-closing ""Phantom"", the tracks here almost always cut straight to the chase, hurdling straight for the chug. Lead salvo ""Get It Off"" finishes before it even starts, with bare-bones gusto and a nose-punch call-and-response chorus about freedom. Meanwhile, there's no bells or whistles on hulking album-standout ""The Furnace"", whose climax comes with the introduction of a simple riff-following police siren sandwiched between two choruses. And as far as beer-buddy moments go, ""In Exodus"" stands beside ""Testament"" as the album's paramount, peppered with a basement full of ""whoa-oh-oh""'s. Of course, if moments like these don't boil your blood, Live the Storm won't go down easy. It sticks pretty resolutely to the D-beat formula: hardcore drumming set against breakneck riffage and unintelligible howls about anarchy, working-stiffs-as-rats, and banding together to, you know, fight. But for anyone who digs the blue-collar energy of Darkest Hour, the focused assault of From Ashes Rise, the beer-swilling madness of Motörhead (or the fact that metal could actually be this fun), Disfear has written a great rock record-- way long on aggression, way short on bullshit, and boundlessly enjoyable.","Adding Entombed guitarist Uffe Cederlund to a group that already features At the Gates singer Tomas Lindberg has created a death'n'roll supergroup-- and one of the best heavy records of 2008 so far.

Thriller: 25th Anniversary Edition,Michael Jackson,by: Tom Ewing,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b49cea9e61561daa6c9c/1:1/w_160/c0baa36d.jpg,2008-02-15 06:00:01,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11163-thriller-25th-anniversary-edition/,Epic,"Thriller is the biggest-selling album of all time; it says so on the cover of this reissue package. What it doesn’t say is that, on a worldwide scale, it outpaces the Eagles, Pink Floyd, and Celine Dion by more than just a marginal million or so: At 100 million+ copies sold, it’s estimated to have sold more than twice its nearest rival. And so people try to concoct explanations. The album was focus-grouped for broader appeal—but then why haven’t focus groups worked so well since? Jackson made the racial crossover breakthrough on MTV—but once that door was opened, why didn’t the sales crossover work for others? Jackson’s stunning dancing and videos exploded pop’s visual formatting—but the Thriller album, until DVD-era reissues like this one, wasn’t a visual experience. When Thriller opens, those 100 million sales feel just. “Wanna Be Startin’ Somethin’” is pure confused, shocked teenage rush. So there’s another theory: Thriller is the best-selling record ever because it’s the best record ever. That one holds up for six minutes and two seconds, during which Jackson and Quincy Jones mix the tension of rock’n’roll with the rapture of disco and hit perfection. But then you get “Baby Be Mine”—one of the original tracks that wasn’t a single—and the momentum fades: On the heels of “Wanna Be Startin’ Somethin’”, it should maintain the temperature; instead, it goes nowhere, starts nothing. Thriller is inconsistent in style, which gives it something to appeal to everyone, but it’s oddly tough to listen to even the great bits sequentially—its peaks are from different mountain ranges. “Thriller”’s joke-shop horror segues well into Eddie Van Halen’s headbanging guitar on “Beat It.” But to follow that into the paranoid celebrity funk of “Billie Jean,” the meltingly tender “Human Nature,” and the smooth R&B of “P.Y.T.”? These are all brilliant singles, though; Thriller’s greatness lies in its great songs not in it “working like an album.” For this edition Jackson called in some current big guns to provide remixes, and sadly they do provide the consistency the originals gloriously lack. Will.i.am sets the tone: He takes Macca off “The Girl Is Mine” but decides it can’t work without someone sounding like an idiot and steps manfully in himself. There’s a general reluctance to use what these guest stars are good at: will.I.am is a consistently slick, inventive pop producer but nobody wants to hear him rap, whereas on Kanye West’s “Billie Jean” a guest verse might have added dynamics to the mix’s clumsy claustrophobia. Fergie’s gift as a pop star is the way her crassness shifts into oddness—so on “Beat It” her nervous reverence is a waste of time. Only Akon comes off well, flipping the meaning of “startin’ somethin’” and turning the song into a joyful seducer’s groove, and here it’s Jackson’s own mush-mouthed new vocal that spoils things. The remixes aren’t a missed opportunity—they’re an imaginative way to wring bonus material from sessions overseen by a notorious perfectionist. It could be a lot worse. The last time Thriller got reissued it included “Someone in the Dark,” a horror from the E.T. soundtrack showcasing Jackson’s most saccharine side. We’re spared that, and the token MJ rarity here is “For All Time,” recorded during the Thriller sessions (and then later rejected for Dangerous). A glistening, slightly overdressed piano ballad, it might have made a nicely sappy album closer—if we didn’t already have the subtler, understated, and underrated “The Lady in My Life,” possibly Jackson’s most soulful solo performance on the record. The DVD footage, with all the videos you’d expect, is much better. Watching the famous Motown 25th Anniversary performance of “Billie Jean” in particular I’m struck by how angular Jackson’s dancing is, how tense: Knees and elbows spiking out, body freezing into indecipherable alphabets. And then how beautiful, the way he simply flows out of each position, the release that made his music so joyful given kinetic form. The biggest-selling album of all time, then, and you should probably take the “of all time” literally. His highest-clout guest stars here have shifted around one-twentieth the copies Thriller has, and in a dwindling industry it’s hard to imagine anything similar happening again. Fluke it maybe was, but as a unification move it worked—the last time, maybe, one person could incarnate almost all of pop, all the corny and all the awesome in one mind. We live now in the world of the “long tail”—Thriller was the big head.","The biggest-selling album of all time returns on a gold-plated 25th edition that reminds us of its frequent briliance and adds both a DVD and bonus tracks featuring Kanye West, Akon, will.i.am, and Fergie.

The Glendale-based trio embraces history, and occasionally on Catherine Avenue*,* their second album, they sound content to summarize primary sources rather than offer original analysis of these styles. ""L.A. Is Mars"", a meandering locals anthem with Sophtware Slump synths, an unironic guitar solo, and stoner vocals from Jared Flamm, borrows its sound from a variety of lower West Coast sources and its municipal observations (""where the wind blows money and stars"") from so many other depictions of the city-- L.A. Story, ""Welcome to the Jungle"", even Shawn Mullins' ""Lullaby"". But the band does too little with the title's planetary imagery and, despite the landmarks that litter their lyrics, never give us their own personal view of the city. A few tracks later, ""Life in a Box"" plays like a better ode to L.A.; its trippy chorus fuzzes out into a harmonica solo as Flamm namedrops Warren Zevon in the lyrics and the Byrds in the music, but by the time the song reaches its end, Biirdie are trying to be the Flying Burrito Brothers, which doesn't suit them quite as well. Biirdie's reliance on the past doesn't make them a bad band by any means, just one with a flair for period costumery. Often, these songs can be charming. Their cover of the Texas Tornados' ""Who Were You Thinkin' Of"", with its killer organ licks and jubilant harmonies, sounds like the Carrie Nations playing behind chicken wire at an Amarillo roadhouse. Gleefully singing about getting some with someone who's getting some more on the side (""You got more out of it than I put into it""), they make self-deprecation sound pretty far out. It's not too surprising that the best song on Catherine Avenue is the one that pushes the envelope the most, i.e., the title track. Flamm takes us on a walk from Embarcadero to Dennis Lane as he laments lost friends and the other band members ""ooh"" like Fleetwood Mac. Then comes a cosmic guitar solo, followed by an out-of-nowhere spoken-word bridge from bassist Kala Savage that sends the song spiraling into another realm. Savage (who, yes, has an actor brother named Fred) takes vocal duties on ""Petals"", pushing the album away from the needless digressions of the previous track, ""I'm Gonna Tell You Something"", and toward a dusty canyon folk sound that suits her voice. With moments like this scattered throughout Catherine Avenue, the album proves simultaneously ambitious and complacent, which is a strange combination. Biirdie want to give us a walking tour of their city, but they don't realize we've seen all these sights and heard all these sounds before.","On their second album, this Glendale, Calif., band embraces the history of their area, alternately channeling SoCal pop, Laurel Canyon folk, and Sunset Strip rock.

Wayfaring Strangers: Guitar Soli,Various Artists,by: Andrew Gaerig,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b4655e6ef959693225e1/1:1/w_160/830a05b3.jpg,2008-02-14 06:00:04,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11118-wayfaring-strangers-guitar-soli/,Numero Group,"Guitar Soli, the Numero Group's collection of obscure solo acoustic guitar instrumentals, professes to explore the ""private side of the solo guitar movement from 1966-1981"". The public side needs no introduction here, having been documented by Martin Scorsese in his revealing 1983 documentary The Last Raga about the decadent concert blowout for solo guitar's leading lights. Davey Graham did a load of blow off of a Martin D-28 and Bert Jansch nearly choked Sandy Bull with a nickel-wound 46-gauge string. Wait, no, that never happened. The scene's leading lights used 1966-1981 to move into some combination of obscurity, poverty, and cult worship. Solo acoustic guitar is not by definition a private affair but its conventions-- and the personalities that are drawn to those conventions-- are not typically the public type. But I'm being a shit: surely Numero means only to show a side of acoustic composition and performance outside the genre-defining names like John Fahey, Robbie Basho, and Leo Kottke, none of whom were really public figures but all of whom enjoyed (or enjoy) critical acclaim and understanding audiences. Guitar Soli collects fourteen such pieces, focusing neither on technical achievement nor on any coherent historical narrative. Freed of even minor stylistic excesses-- like Fahey's collage or Basho's chant-- Guitar Soli defies categorization as anything but six-string plainsong. So silly miniatures help focus Guitar Soli. Ted Lucas, who turns in the comp's most furiously picked track, ""Raga in 'D'"", was Motown's Indian-music session man, playing sitar for the Temptations and the Supremes. Richard Crandell has found work after learning the mbira while driving Thomas Mapfumo's bus. Daniel Hecht knew Moondog and now writes mystery novels. Best of all, Mark Lang's ""Strawberry Man"" is sunny and weightless in its contemplation of a beachside fruit vendor but it never would've hit the tape if Lang hadn't grown jealous of his brother Peter, who cut an album with Fahey and Kottke. Other tracks require no backstory at all: Stephen Cohen's ""No More School"" is exactly as red-faced and dimpled as its title suggests, while Jim Ohlschmidt's ""The Delta Freeze"" is Guitar Soli's most singular sonic statement, a mess of strangulated slides that grow denser and angrier until the tape saturates. The music only gets so peculiar, though: these are acoustic guitar tracks mostly in the folk mold with occasional Eastern influences. Guitar Soli doesn't even contain a proper blues; its most far-off cut is its last, Dwayne Cannan's ""One Forty Eight"", which features an electric guitar part best described as...Carlos Santana-y? Strange, but it fits: these artists, along with Fahey, Basho etc., were important bridges between the American Primitive style birthed by the 1960s folk movement and the New Age 80s. Guitar Soli is no missing link but its placidity, a product of carefully minded source music and the subtlest of desires to innovate, suggests that the artists of Guitar Soli belong in the discussion, however private and odd their endeavors.","Numero Group's compilation collects guitar instrumentals first issued between 1966 and 1981, showing a solo steel-string world apart from John Fahey, Robbie Basho, and Leo Kottke.

Coloured in Memory,Fairmont,by: Andy Battaglia,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b4639d034d5c69bf4e68/1:1/w_160/98cded3b.jpg,2008-02-14 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11116-coloured-in-memory/,Border Community,"Jake Fairley is one of a few North Americans to figure into the grand narrative of techno over the past few years. He made his name in Toronto before moving to Berlin, where he joined hordes of expatriate DJ/producers-- is there a census yet to track such an epochal migration?-- keen to play routine gigs bigger than what would qualify as career highlights at home. In his transplanted role, Fairley was one of many, another promising player on a deep bench busy making Berlin a story. So what made him special? Not much, at the start. Or, in another fashion: versatility. The ability to wander meaningfully between different styles isn't often valorized within the delirious techno glut, but Fairley is a prime example of the kind of artist who benefits from time on the sidelines. He made solid but less-than-starry singles for good labels (Traum, Sender, Kompakt), and in 2004 he crafted an album, Touch Not the Cat, that failed to win due appreciation even though it ranks now with the best realizations of the late glam-stomp techno style known as ""schaffel."" Then he blew up. Under his guise as Fairmont, at the end of 2005, Fairley made one of those storied dance tracks that introduce a new sound (not a style, but a specific sound) to mark a time and place on techno's long-term trajectory. In the case of ""Gazebo"", it was an ethereal synth bauble thrown into a perpetual falling action over the span of several bars, a protracted melodic idea that suggested the structure of a ""round"" but teasingly refused to coalesce. ""Gazebo"" played as an instant anthem at the time, and its influence remains in a realm where significance is measured in terms of months more often than years. Nothing on Fairmont's Coloured in Memory proves quite as wondrous, but the craft remains. ""Fade and Saturate"" opens in a dramatic mood, with series of reversed-tape smears and ashen synths building over vocals by Fairley himself. Unlike on Touch Not the Cat, which cast him as a bashful singer not quite sure how to hold a microphone, Fairley sounds now like he means it. And his hissy whisper haunts even when he's not there: In similarly keyed highlights like ""Darling's Waltz"" and ""Mobula"", suggestive shadows of songs fall over tracks made up of just washes and beats, all of which hit big but rustle or spray accents to make them register as more holistically musical. A lot of Coloured in Memory sounds like Superpitcher and Michael Mayer, two fellow song-minded producers (and reigning icons of the Kompakt label) whom Fairley clearly reveres. Superpitcher plays out in the matter of moods-- brooding, gray, sensuously in love with sadness and detachment-- while Mayer figures into Fairley's dramatic knack for moving parts in and out of place like a DJ. ""I Need Medicine"", the biggest dance track on the album, showcases the latter with movements arranged around throbs, taps, snaps, and finally a beat that bangs with all the concision of a stamping machine. The final third of Coloured in Memory downshifts into a spell of midtempo meditations and ambient murmurs. It's the kind of direction known to derail techno albums by even the best, but Fairley makes good on the habit for expansiveness he's earned. Coloured in Memory meanders, but never less than meaningfully so.","A Canadian wanderer moves through expansive hinterlands of techno on an album that finds him singing, swaying, and staking a claim to status as a staying power.

03/07 – 09/07,High Places,by: Mike Powell,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b48dea9e61561daa6c85/1:1/w_160/38fcd13a.jpg,2008-02-14 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11150-0307-0907/,eMusic,"The Brooklyn-based duo High Places are most often compared to Beat Happening, a band cherished for their regression-- into musical primitivism, adolescent sexuality, and any other condition that twenty- and thirtysomethings bemoan the loss of in therapy. High Places' indulgence in nursery rhymes aside, the kinship is mostly an ideological one: Like Beat Happening, they exult in the simple. 03/07 - 09/07, a collection of the band's first 7"" and stray compilation tracks (released through the mp3 subscription service eMusic), shows a group whose comfort zone isn't the folky imperative, but heady, hippyish imprecision. The songs here are almost all identical: polyrhythmic miniatures built by small drums and shakers, clouded by blankets of echo and reverb; deliberately basic structures; short, and in their own way, catchy and pretty. Rhythms suggest provinces a step removed from where other white, arty urbanites tend to dwell: There are flashes of soca, reclined bounces that remind me of Indian music, and though ""Sandy Feat""'s swing could be Tom Petty's ""American Girl"" or David Bowie's ""Modern Love"", they inflect it they way Brazilian bands like Os Mutantes did (or Paul Simon on Rhythm of the Saints). High Places' trunk-rattling impulses are juxtaposed with a spacious, almost tranquil atmosphere, with Rob Barber's percussion chiming and floating rather than physically hitting, and Mary Pearson's sweetly flat vocals layered to the point that her lyrics often become indistinguishable. That blur makes High Places' music hypnotic: Pearson chatters away like a light-headed kid on the playground on one song and intones a mantra on the next, and it's only then that you notice how both forms operate on the same principle: repetition induces calm. (Full disclosure: Pearson's sister is a former Pitchfork employee.) Pearson's vocals and the duo's lyrics are charmingly coquettish: She reduces falling in love to ""Oh, you're a pretty boy, a pretty boy"" and writes letters to Martians. ""Jump In"", penned for Pearson's Michigan elementary school, is so full of encouragement that it scans like the transcription of a guidance counselor or junior minister. ""Canary"" apologizes to animals displaced by ecological warfare-- ""we really messed up."" The sentiments are frank, but I out them for three reasons: There's nothing wrong with being positive, the band's confident enough to handle it, and they make me happy. ""Universe""'s lyric makes this clear: ""It takes a lot of guts to be a little baby in this place."" The idea of returning to infancy might resonate as a dippy bohemian nightmare, but in a society where moderate cynicism is considered a higher road to intelligence than acceptance and curiosity, and where sarcasm is considered a social reflex, you'd be hard pressed to argue with them-- it does take guts.",,8.3,
12 Great Remixes For 11 Great Artists 2001 - 2007 / Fabric 38,M.A.N.D.Y.,by: Tim Finney,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b49eea9e61561daa6ca2/1:1/w_160/c856a87f.jpg,2008-02-14 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11658-12-great-remixes-for-11-great-artists-2001-2007fabric-38/,Get Physical,"""Electro-house,"" sceptics complained in a teacher's pet tone, ""is neither electro, nor house."" True enough, and not just because cross-breeds rarely look just like their parents. The point of this ungainly tag was to say ""not-techno"": Electro-house set itself up as both techno's opposite and its substitute, reversing the traditional combination of cold rhythms and warm melodies. If techno is typically restless and fidgety in spite of its four by four kickdrums, the ""house"" in electro-house envisioned a flat landscape of sameness for the synth riffs to spitefully dance over. In their own production work, Get Physical act M.A.N.D.Y.'s capacity to just float at a certain plateau of intensity usually paid enormous dividends. ""Our World (Our Music)"", a 2003 collaboration with the Sunsetpeople, is humbling in its sublime simplicity-- it's little more than minor key chords, insistent bass pulse, and a nourishing strings. ""Body Language"", the duo's official collaboration with Booka Shade and biggest hit, is a similarly perfect example of the virtue of restraint. Given its ubiquitous presence (now even underwriting a Will.I.Am single), the track remains surprising in its refusal to climax, simply coiling and uncoiling with a suave, poised air of unconcern. Very few moments on 12 Great Remixes for 11 Great Artists can rival this sense of perfection. The earliest remixes (for Sugababes, DJ Monique, and Röyksopp) come close at times, concocting a sugary, echo-strewn and stadium-sized electro-house sound well ahead of its time. By comparison, the more recent efforts can feel unnaturally stunted and held in check: You can spot the moments where production partners Booka Shade probably said, ""We can add strings and a big chord change here,"" and M.A.N.D.Y. responded with a ""No, let's cut back to a kickdrum and add some disconnected electronic squiggles and an inscrutable film sample instead."" Perhaps when Booka Shade emerged in their own right as German house's most anthemic duo, M.A.N.D.Y. felt pushed into turning their commitment to restraint into a hardliner stance, determined not to go for the peaktime jugular, tearjerker chord, or obvious hook-- not to be seduced into unabashed prettiness (they made an exception for their wonderfully soppy remix of Chelonis R. Jones' ""Le Bateau Ivre"", shamefully not included here). Of their recent remixes, only their rave-dub take on Rockers Hi-Fi's ""Push Push"", a mix of trembling, bouncing synth chords, is outright irresistible. The impeccable production ensures that these productions sound lovely throughout, but it doesn't always protect them from an air of pointlessness, especially when the duo approach remixes of good songs with the apparent intention of quarantining their hooks. Remixes for Röyksopp's ""49 Percent"", Lindstrøm's ""I Feel Space"", and Rex the Dog's ""Prototype"" all follow the same basic structure: 1) Spend several minutes wandering directionlessly within an atmospheric but Spartan house groove, 2) Effectively splice in a large chunk of the original song, sans climax, 3) Subside back into anorexic pulses, and 4) Fade out. Perhaps there's a good reason for this: M.A.N.D.Y. are DJs first and foremost, and most of these tracks sound structured for long blends with other complementary grooves. The ""I Feel Space"" remix in particular sounds great in a club context, the pre-echoes of the original's anthemic italo march tickling at your brain as they oh-so-gradually coalesce into something recognizable. But there's a built-in lifespan for this ""slight return"" style of remix, even if you love the original songs to death. And I wonder at the sense of releasing an unmixed compilation of these tracks for the home listener, especially when M.A.N.D.Y.'s ethos is compared to a whole host of producers who used electro-house's widescreen sensibility as a template for constructing remixes of extravagant architectural grandeur, rendering the original tracks irrelevant (see Tiefschwarz, Jacques Lu Cont, Ewan Pearson). What can be a liability in M.A.N.D.Y.'s production work is a strength in their DJ mixes: Their anti-linear approach to track selection can make for subtle and hypnotic mixes of compelling laterality. The duo's opening contribution to Get Physical's Body Language series remains their highpoint: at first seeming almost aimless, its slow survey of the breadth of German house ultimately reveals itself as obsessively structured and surprisingly anthemic-- a friend described the mix as revealing ""hidden shallows"" over time. But while their last official DJ mix, 2006's At The Controls, seemed to want to cover every single possible reference point, Fabric 38 finds them unusually focused, carefully navigating the thin space between minimal house and techno (much has changed since the ""not-techno"" of five years ago). In fact, many of the selections strongly reflect the legacy of Derrick May in particular, toning down the ""plip plop"" that made minimal vulnerable to ridicule, but remaining too fitful and fidgety and insectile to rest easily within the bracket of ""house."" In most other senses, though, Fabric 38 sounds like the kind of mix that Loco Dice was making in 2005: melodic but dry, setting layers of percussion and clouds of echo over sandpaper-rough textures. The set doesn't sound out-of-date, but it sits at odds with the prevailing consensus that the ""new"" direction for German house and techno entails a re-engagement with deep house's organicism. For its long but busy middle stretch in particular, the mix is almost defiantly uniform and machinic, light on charisma or memorable hooks, but obsessed with depth-- every track feels like staring into a bubbling swamp. It may just be a personal bias that finds Fabric 38 more engaging at its most gentle and twinkly and, well, house-like, from the whimpering, descending chords of Crowdpleaser's remix of Quarion's ""Karasu"", to the interweaving layers of chimes on Lucio Aquilina's ""My Cube"". But it's also these moments (weighted towards the beginning and the end of the mix) that are the album's most diverse and expansive. The extravagant percussion of Guillame and the Couto Dumont's ""Mederico"" is the set's most exciting and memorable inclusion, not least because its captivating syncopation shines a light on M.A.N.D.Y.'s superlative mixing skills-- the dexterity of which can be obscured by the general succession of like-minded tracks. If Fabric 38 and 12 Great Remixes for 11 Great Artists fall short of their aims for apparently opposite reasons (one too focused, the other not focused enough), the common thread for both is an unnecessary fear of obviousness. Yes, M.A.N.D.Y., subtlety is your thing, but when the strings break on ""Our World (Our Music)"", only a dead-inside cynic would think ""how obvious..."" Anyone else would be too busy thinking ""how could anything possibly sound better?""","Get Physical act M.A.N.D.Y. issue both a collection of remixes (for artists like Röyksopp, Lindstrøm, Rex the Dog, and Sugababes) as well as another solid entry into London club Fabric's mix series.

Les Ondes Silencieuses,Colleen,by: Liz Colville,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b44a9d034d5c69bf4e3c/1:1/w_160/47f9a59c.jpg,2008-02-13 06:00:05,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11096-les-ondes-silencieuses/,Leaf,"After a 2006 EP, Colleen et les Boites à Musique, that featured music boxes, Colleen's third, largely string-based full-length, Les Ondes Silencieuses (""silent waves""), begins with a relative big bang. Opener ""This Place in Time"" kicks off with a panoramic cacophony of viola and cello that quickly fades out to a pretty, filmic harmony of long, drawn-out chords and tension-building silences. Colleen's usual urge to interweave loops of electronics with vocals and strings is absent here; instead, the opening track is so listless and chord-driven that it sounds like an exit-- either to an album or an Ang Lee film. For much of the album, there's no palpable machinery at hand except a microphone. There are subtle effects lent to the classical guitar on ""Le Labyrinthe"", Colleen's seeming homage to Renaissance-era lyre ballads. Precise rhythms and ever-climbing scales between two guitars may suggest ""computer,"" when in fact the song is simply a study of musical dialogue, and of polyphony. It's free of percussion and completely a relic of a distant past. Similarly, ""Blue Sands"" is breezy, inviting, and ancient. Slightly reverbed guitar plucks and windy strums recall Joni Mitchell at the dulcimer or Arthur Russell at the cello. Hollow harmonics on the viola reel and see-saw in the song's gorgeous climax, and the guitar remains in the background, adding a subtle counter-rhythm. ""Echoes and Coral"", with its hints of watery field recordings and gong-inspired melody, sounds more like Mira Calix, to whom it's increasingly easy to compare Colleen since the latter relinquished the laptop in favor of a global range of strings and percussion. The song could easily be bells heard far off during a walk through a Buddhist courtyard, and yet there's a clear, traditional composition behind the seemingly random, relaxed taps of metal. ""Le Bateau"", also suggesting Calix's creeping, melody-free wanderings about strings and keys, knits itself into a cohesive, cognizant melody-- just the thick plucks of a viola shifting from mood to mood, relaxation to urgency. The other star instrument here is the clarinet, which notably appears on ""Sun Against My Eyes"" and makes a pretty, but a little hokey, complement with the guitar. The tempo on this and most of the other tracks is so slow that it can be frustratingly lulling. But I can think of many situations when ""Sun"" could render a scene, a meditation, or a non-automobile TV commercial perfectly sad and memorable, and in fact it's one of few well-paced songs here. It's energetic in places, even urgent, and feels fully fleshed out, while many others here are sheer ruminations. Lovely as they are, many of these songs are little watercolors that might not find the same kind of audience as Colleen's electronics. However, they might find a new audience in those that dug Greenwood's score to There Will Be Blood, classical string fans or players, and anyone with painterly patience to spare on a crisp winter afternoon.","French experimental artist Cécile Schott returns with a third LP of increasingly fewer electronics, here creating beautiful string-and-wind meditations that harken back 400 years, yet seem tailored for today.

Monstre Cosmic,Monade,by: Nate Patrin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b44db1335d7bf169a722/1:1/w_160/88d37145.jpg,2008-02-13 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11098-monstre-cosmic/,Too Pure,"Conventional wisdom says that if you go out of your way to establish a side project, it should sound different enough from your main gig to actually justify its own existence. It's one thing to recommend Monade on the basis that you'll probably like them if you like Stereolab, given the pivotal involvement of singer/lyricist Laetitia Sadier. But after listening to Monade's 2005 album A Few Steps More, it gets a bit perplexing when you hear how much a band containing precisely one member of Stereolab sounds so much like their parent group, right down to the motorik beats and the way the guitars and electric pianos create that familiar harmonic drone. Then again, that's just another sign of how well the members of Monade have come together to work under Sadier's vision, and if you can create even the slightest variation on one of the most distinct sounds in indie rock without losing what makes it work, the question of stylistic redundancy feels a bit like nitpicking. Monstre Cosmic lies somewhere between comfort food for Stereolab fans and a cohesive work that gives Sadier and her group a bit of leeway to stretch. While Monstre Cosmic does what many of Sadier and Tim Gane's compositions have done in the past-- finding pop in the avant, reshaping and extruding weighty concepts into easily graspable doses of simple, riff-heavy rhythms-- it also tends to do so in a slightly more elegant context, trading in the subtle and thoughtful quirk of recent records like Fab Four Suture and Margerine Eclipse for an equally subtle and thoughtful grace. Sadier has stated that Monstre Cosmic is thematically held together by an abstract conceptual notion of how light and shade interact. If it doesn't always come through clearly in the lyrics (which, per usual, are in French half the time), it does seep through in a compositional sense. ""Étoile"" and ""Elle Topo"" use these contrasts to great effect, with the former shifting from post-dusk reverie to summery noontime buoyancy and back like a 72-hour time-lapse photo, the latter ricocheting between delicate country-psych and high-speed Kraut-pop, before letting the two gradually merge. Most of the other songs on the album do so in a less-spectacular fashion-- the transformation of ""Entre Chien et Loup"" from a sleepy Moog-meets-chamber music dirge into a punk-velocity percussive workout is more admirable on a technical sense than an emotional one, and the rhythmic transitions of ""Invitation"" happen just as each groove has just about lost its steam-- but strung together as a unified work, Monstre Cosmic runs a remarkable gamut of tones and moods, even if you have to try and forget over 15 years' worth of Stereolab records to hear its freshness.","Stereolab singer/lyricist Laetitia Sadier here takes a slightly more elegant take on her day job's search to find the pop in the avant-garde.

The Company of Wolves,Hi-Fidel and DJ Crucial,by: Ben Westhoff,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b4605e6ef959693225d9/1:1/w_160/b115830b.jpg,2008-02-13 06:00:03,Jazz,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11114-the-company-of-wolves/,F5,"Besides rapping for a stellar, relatively unknown St. Louis record label, L.A. resident Umar Rashid is a t-shirt designer, painter, and the author of a graphic novel for children, The Hunter and the Teardrop. According to a description, the book is ""a moral tale about an interstellar hunter who kills all the great beasts in the universe, and one day finds he has nothing left to kill."" Rashid's nom de hippity-hop is Hi-Fidel, and his second album is not really what you'd expect from a West Coast renaissance dude. Entitled The Company of Wolves, it tells the tales of sad-sack characters plucked from the swampy muck of his imagination. As he explains on ""Barbara Kruger"": ""These are people that I've never known/ But I'm pretty sure they're out there/ Hope your cover's not blown."" Some are alcoholics, some are crackheads, nearly all are depressed, and the government and big corporations are just making things worse. The anti-hero in ""The Thin Wall"" is headed off to Iraq: ""And he realizes when the man on the TV screen fumbles/ It's just a game/ And in real life everything crumbles."" ""Jimmy""'s title character, meanwhile, may have issues, but he takes solace knowing he's not as bad as ""that crazy president who killed them babies/ Or that prime minister that slaughtered those ladies."" The tone is quite different from Fidel's 2002 debut, Traveling Between St. Louis And Chicago, in which the cynicism was tempered by a hopeful enthusiasm. But it's not just Fidel who has changed; equally responsible for Wolves' death march feel is DJ Crucial, who produced both albums. Traveling's looser, more energetic setting was fitting for one of the Midwest's great acid-rock-sampling DJs, but here Crucial has largely forsaken scratching and sing-alongs in favor of flutes and jazz-influenced noir beats. We're left without a song to rock out to, or even a head-nodder like Traveling's masterpiece, ""Tenth Wonderful"". But there's a Bukowskian beauty in all this pain, and even a few laughs. ""Gordo 3003"" borrows Dr. Octagon's twinkling space-age bleeps and imagery, down to the ""iguana-like reptiles armed with projectiles, criss-crossing the night sky like African textiles."" Fidel is nonetheless better served when he leaves the goofy surrealism to collaborator Serengeti, who raps on ""Party Farmington"" about a cougar who seduces young men while her man is working at a weapons factory in the suburbs. (""We spoke about steroids, and her husband's bed wetting."") Serengeti is joined on the album by other underground ringers including recent Om: Hip Hop signee Black Spade, L.A.'s Pigeon John, and St. Louis' Mathias, the latter two of whom are responsible for the album's single uplifting track, ""Small Victories"". The pair reportedly had a tough time convincing Fidel to record this hopeful song, but it nonetheless inspired him to deliver his most impassioned verse on the album, one which may also offer a clue as to his evolving mindset: ""I know there'll be brighter days ahead but for now/ I gotta stay fit and maintain my style.""","West Coast renaissance man Umar Rashid tells tales of sad-sack characters plucked from the swampy muck of his imagination over flutes and jazz-influenced noir beats.

Falling Off the Lavender Bridge,Lightspeed Champion,by: Joshua Love,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b485b1335d7bf169a76a/1:1/w_160/e60678f9.jpg,2008-02-13 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11144-falling-off-the-lavender-bridge/,Domino,"Comparing bands is pretty much unavoidable when you're trying to classify or keep straight hundreds or even thousands of artists that fall beneath the banner of indie rock. Hence, Vampire Weekend gets likened to Graceland even if the resemblance is slight rather than exact, while thanks to the nasally pipes of Alec Ounsworth, assessors of Clap Your Hands Say Yeah will probably always evoke Talking Heads regardless of where the former group draws its inspiration. Associations with better and more established artists may add pressure to musical up-and-comers, but it also piques the interest of said artists' fans and admirers, and at least put these listeners in a positive frame of mind when putting the record on. Then again, it can work just as easily in opposition when the point of reference leaves you cold. The potential side effects of prejudicing a listener's first impressions is something I've been thinking about since encountering Lightspeed Champion. Lightspeed is the current project of Devonte Hynes, most notably a member of now-defunct dance-punks Test Icicles. A head-spinning 180-degree turn from his previous group's beat-fueled mayhem, the new project finds Hynes assuming the role of a florid troubadour, dewily emoting over well-manicured strings and acoustic guitars. Because Lightspeed Champion has toured with Bright Eyes, and because longtime BE collaborator and go-to Saddle Creek producer Mike Mogis helmed this record, Hynes' latest effort has earned him a slew of misleading comparisons to Conor Oberst's acclaimed-yet-divisive outfit-- an association that not only misrepresents Hynes' positive attributes, but his shortcomings, too. Oberst has an awkward way of shoehorning twang into his unchecked poetic rambling, but on Falling Off the Lavender Bridge, Hynes offers a comfortable (and more interesting) marriage of lush Brit-pop and Omaha-flavored country-rock. On the other hand, Hynes' lyrics aren't quite up to par with his tourmate Oberst. And while Hynes' voice isn't carefully spotlighted as Conor's, you can unfortunately still make out what he's saying. A precocious young man himself, Hynes has an awful predilection towards the kind of ""transgressive"" lyricism that's less shocking than just plain silly. Pick your poison: ""I'm sick in your mouth,"" ""Wake up, smell the semen,"" or something that certainly sounds like ""until they cum down his throat."" Given the way Hynes has transitioned from disco-thrash to roots-pop, I suppose it's possible his next record might be hair metal laced with r&b or punk-rock opera. If he's patient enough to dig deeper into his current terrain, though, he could cultivate a sound distinctive enough for other artists to begin garnering ill-fitting comparisons to him instead.","Transitioning from the dance-punk of his former band Test Icicles, Devonte Hynes ropes in Saddle Creek producer Mike Mogis and recasts himself as florid troubadour, dewily emoting over well-manicured strings and acoustic guitars.

"We Got It for Cheap, Vol. 3",Re-Up Gang,by: Ryan Dombal,Features Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b4995e6ef9596932261e/1:1/w_160/996af368.jpg,2008-02-13 06:00:01,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11161-we-got-it-for-cheap-vol-3/,Re-Up,"""I'm not part of your coke rap genre,"" seethes Clipse's Malice on the third installment of Re-Up Gang's stellar We Got It For Cheap mixtape series. While an estimated 90% of the lyrics on Vol. 3 deal with the illicit exchange of various forms of cocaine, there's some truth to Mal's assertion. Along with Clipse partner Pusha T and cohorts Ab-Liva and Sandman, the threateningly whiny MC isn't part of anyone's convenient hip-hop trend: The Re-Up Gang belong to a genre unto themselves. That intense singularity culminated with the release of 2005's Vol. 2 and 2006's Hell Hath No Fury, two insular triumphs that solidified the group's current cult status: They've sold more than a million albums, chilled with Pharrell, and had 17,000 sun-stroked indie kids rat-a-tatting at last year's Pitchfork Music Festival. Let's see Young Jeezy pull off all that. But while Clipse have operated largely within their own bubble since the fluke-ish explosion of ""Grindin'"" back in 2002, they've always had an enemy to rail against. The We Got It for Cheap series originated as a not-so-subtle ""fuck you"" to the record labels that consigned Hell Hath No Fury to backburner status for years. These mixtapes-- laced with jacked beats and immortal industry put-downs-- were legitimate acts of protest. That indignant anger and uncompromising spirit (combined with their unparalleled way with Pyrex punchlines) turned Vol. 2 and HHNF into two of this decade's most striking rap LPs. But now, graced with blinding critical kudos, a modest-yet-loyal platoon of fans, and a $1.8 million record deal co-signed by hip-hop icon Rick Rubin, the Re-Up Gang don't have much to complain about. Without a clear-cut target, Clipse & co. start to expose the limits of their style on Vol. 3. The beginning of the tape finds Pusha spitting a couple jaw-dropping (albeit inaccurate) Lil Wayne take-downs, but the pseudo beefing comes off half-hearted. (Funny enough, Malice recently admitted, ""I think Lil Wayne gets more burn than the Clipse in my house,"" while talking about his kids' listening habits.) Elsewhere, the crew tries to create drama with references to vague haters, ""tree-hugging-ass bitches"" and disposable pop rappers. At one point, commenting on the state of hip-hop, Pusha claims, ""All that super stupid shit is done""-- a delusional-at-best statement in the Soulja Boy era. Malice eventually comes through with a wrought passage about the strained relationship between his clique and Pharrell while referencing a conversation with Clipse's manipulative former label boss Barry Weiss: ""Barry said P is selfish as hell/ I was like, Stay in place homey, watch yourself/ Now this man could place my life upon the shelf/ And, as for P, he has yet to wish me well."" The tension contained in those lines is more revealing and powerful than a million bullshit call-outs. Compared to Vol. 2, where the Gang snatched beats from Cassidy's ""I'm a Hustla"" and Tony Yayo's ""So Seductive"" to serve as a nearly flawless backdrop, Vol. 3's beats aren't as immediate or rewarding. They convincingly roll over Obie Trice's underrated ""Cry Now"" but can't match the effortless celebration that marks Jay-Z's ""Roc Boys"". Kanye's ""Good Morning"" and Raekwon's ""Rainy Dayz"" are well-chosen introspective picks, but the group's trademark eye-widening bangers are lacking here-- the tape could use a couple more ""1 Thing""-type change ups to lift the sometimes morose vibe. Still, this is a characteristic Re-Up record. The quartet-- especially Clipse-- still turn plenty of phrases that can crack you up while trapped in a rush-hour subway car (two personal favorites from Pusha: ""Under my cuticles proof the pies that I sell/ Guess life in jail's but a manicure away/ Well I don't feel like gettin' my nails done today-- yuchk!"" and ""I pull from the ghost of the dead greats/ Ouija board flow, all you niggas is dead weight""). And though Ab-Liva and Sandman fare better than your typical auxiliary crew dudes, it's becoming increasingly clear they'll never come remotely close to matching the Thornton brothers' talents. On ""Re-Up Gang (Intro)"", Liva raps, ""We on the rise but I'm bothered by this view."" Granted, the quartet haven't reached Kanye levels of Olympus-dom but, in an industry where loyal fandom is becoming an increasingly prized commodity, these niche artists are doing pretty well. Even their label troubles seem safely in the rear view. So who'll be the next object of this group's acid-tongued wrath? Malice offers an intriguing possibility on ""Emotionless"": ""Truth be told, I been feelin' different lately/ Like, fuck money and the dollar is the devil's baby."" Man in the mirror, meet your neighborhood drug dealer.","Clipse, Ab-Liva, and Sandman add a third entry to their We Got It for Cheap mixtape series-- their first since signing a new record deal with Rick Rubin.

Flowers Forever,Flowers Forever,by: Rebecca Raber,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b4579d034d5c69bf4e53/1:1/w_160/b197d098.jpg,2008-02-12 06:00:05,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11105-flowers-forever/,Team Love,"Last year, Tilly and the Wall's Derek Pressnall had what was either a mental breakdown or a hallucinatory case of mono. Feverishly convinced that he could sense the future, the Omaha-based musician was compelled to create, transforming the pressure of those premonitions into his new band: Flowers Forever. Accordingly, the trio's self-titled debut rings with the urgency of newfound creative rejuvenation while also wallowing in painful vulnerability and flickering with anger. With baroque orchestration, often aggressive rhythms, and crunchy, buzzing textures, these songs are an obvious departure from the cheery tap-dancing pop of Tilly. But what they've lost in exuberance and childlike sweetness, they make up for in sober (if a tad heavy-handed) maturity and artistic ambition. Unsurprisingly, given that it's being released by his Team Love imprint, the album's closest relative seems to be early Conor Oberst recordings (albeit without the lo-fi tape hiss). It's nearly impossible to not hear the Bright Eyes frontman's influence when Pressnall's voice cracks and strains with desperation on ""Wet Diamonds"" and ""Black Rosary"". But with a shambolic orchestra of carnival organs, mournful horns, fuzzy guitars, and trembling tambourines, Pressnall (aided by drummer Craig Dee and Baby Walrus multi-instrumentalist Chris Senseney) sidesteps the boy-and-his-ballad traps of other Conor wannabes, embracing the artier, more aggressive sounds of those other Saddle Creekers in Cursive. Unfortunately, Flowers Forever's unchecked cynicism and anger can seem overindulgent-- on the expletive-laden ""Happy New Year"" where Pressnall rages against, what, the holidays?-- but when it is earned, as on the galloping, gypsy-brass re-imagining of Billie Holiday's ""Strange Fruit"", Pressnall's emotive, electrifyingly tuneless shout-singing is incredibly powerful. It is put to its best use on ""Golden Shackles"", when, in one of the album's most affecting moments, he repeatedly screams, ""Change better come/ We're not fucking around no more,"" reminding listeners of the desperation that spurred him to create these tracks in the first place. Standout song ""American Dream"" enlivens his disillusioned lyrics with whirling, celebratory orchestrations of Continental accordions and western-standoff horns then devolves into a dissonant, drowsy vocal outro. Amidst such heightened drama, the album's more buoyant moments-- the delightfully jaunty piano track ""Beach Bum"" (the only clue here to Pressnall's Tilly heritage) and the all-too-brief acid-fried Pavement paean ""Beautiful Tornado""-- are welcome bursts of modulation. Though Flowers Forever's songs aim to be anthems, their disorienting melodies aren't quite accessible enough. And though there is plenty of crashing cacophony, most of the silvery percussive bursts are too jagged to get fists pumping in the air. That's not a criticism. There is something intriguingly off-kilter about these tunes that warrants repeated listens. And after all, for an accidental clairvoyant, Pressnall's songs are surprisingly prescient.","New band from Derek Pressnall of Tilly and the Wall is a shambolic orchestra of carnival organs, mournful horns, fuzzy guitars, and trembling tambourines.

The Busy Signals,The Busy Signals,by: Jason Crock,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b44313d197565213aaa7/1:1/w_160/97cea185.jpg,2008-02-12 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11090-the-busy-signals/,Dirtnap,"The Busy Signals make it look it easy. Their self-titled 2007 debut deserves being mentioned in the same reverent breath as their one-time lablemates, the Exploding Hearts, as it has the same unabashed hero adulation and the same brash attempts at reaching those impregnable heights. Their overall sound never varies, with plentiful hooks and searing guitars that recall plenty of 1970s punk rockers and power-poppers like the Buzzcocks and likely a dozen more obscure acts. There's no hoarse screaming, political posturing, or desperate panting from lead singer Ana McGorty; just a frontwoman who sings and acts like she belongs up front. There are only so many words to relay this record's spot-on reverence, really; the relentless guitars, the harmonies, the treble, the echo, the energy-- they're all here, faithfully delivered and impeccably produced. The Busy Signals is a well-executed stab at punk rock comfort music. But within that tried-and-true formula, the band finds ample room for variation and surprise-- the album is consistent without ever getting homogeneous, and without really reveling in how exacting the songwriting is. ""Plastic Girl"" is a patchwork quilt dizzy from chord changes you'd never notice for its infectiousness and it's devilishly simple chorus, while ""Look the Other Way"" has slick single-note guitar leads and a short cool down with bassist Jeremy Thompson (formerly of Carbonas) raising his voice before, yes, another great chorus. All the songs show that the devil is in the details: a windmilled chord up against a well-timed, economic lead; a sudden unaccompanied bass part that pivots and pushes; an boy/girl baton hand-off vocal in ""Matter of Time""; just an ""Oh"" or ""woah-oh"" at the right moment. Songs like ""Matter of Time"" and ""Patterns"" are the most hero-cribbing, but stand ably on their own with clean, simple guitar lines that sound almost like Western soundtracks in how they wrangle and lead the song. But like many a band of spurned and jilted outcasts before them, the Busy Signals' bratty attitude lifts to reveal a bruised interior: the energy of the record hits first, but more listens reveal the hopeless romanticism of tracks like ""Tell Me"" or ""Kiss and Tell"", doo-wop laments in overdrive. One side of the band shakes out their troubles to instantly-memorable songs like ""Stereo"", the other gives teary-eyed relationship woes a pretty stirring soundtrack in their own right. Both sides are worth checking out and keeping tabs on, and, as McGorty sings ""young, young, young"" over and over in ""Patterns,"" they all sound like their unyielding enthusiasm will never dim.","This impressive Chicago punk/power-pop band shares some qualities with one-time labelmates the Exploding Hearts but still manages to forge its own identity.

Ghetto Extraordinary,Killer Mike,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b440b1335d7bf169a70d/1:1/w_160/59ad09d7.jpg,2008-02-12 06:00:03,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11087-ghetto-extraordinary/,SonySony,"Listening to Ghetto Extraordinary, it's easy to imagine the perpetually cantankerous Killer Mike nodding in agreement with Daniel Plainview's beachfront lament from There Will Be Blood: There are times when he looks at people and sees nothing worth liking. His second LP for Sony is a bracing throwback of sorts to the angry-man hip-hop that got me started in 1991 or so, back when Ice Cube, Treach, Willie D, and Chuck D rewrote the rules of ""conscious rap"" to incorporate the conscious desire to knock some sense into you. And while Ghetto Extraordinary could possibly have been seen as a refinement of 2006's monstrous, trend-chasing I Pledge Allegiance to the Grind mixtape, there's one sad irony that hangs over these volatile narratives; Killer finished recording unaware that he'd have to give it away on the internet almost three years later just to let it see the light of day. As Scott Plagenhoef wrote in his ""Through the Cracks"" column earlier this month, getting the shit end of the stick from a major often results in knee-jerk critical sympathy, but it's not like Sony missed out on a Dixie Hotel Foxtrot here-- Ghetto Extraordinary is all over the place, and while it's not particularly jarring for a record you can download for free, as a major release, it can certainly be seen as a victim of overeager retooling. In the event that it does gain a reputation as a buried treasure, it won't be a result of the bougie Jagged Edge track, ""Niggaz Down South""'s serviceable but reductive trap-hop or David Banner's umpteenth cannibalization of the ""Rubberband Man"" beat (""Aye-O""). What makes the delay of this thing so curious is how it manages to open a time warp into the year it was supposed to drop; considering his debut Monster went gold, it's hard to believe this wouldn't have made sense in a year when the public was enamored with all things Atlanta. Drums go off like mortar rounds on the club-razing ""Get 'Em Shawty"", a reminder that Three 6 Mafia used to produce some of the most frightening music in hip-hop before they limited their palette to Willie Hutch samples (granted, the second half does interpolate their colossal beatdown anthem ""Who Run It""). Meanwhile, ""Gorilla Pimpin'"" is one of the few beats of the 21st century that 8ball & MJG sound comfortable on and even the track featuring estranged partner Big Boi (""My Chrome"") could pass for a budget ""The Way You Move"". But the emotional core of Ghetto Extraordinary can be found in ""Bad Day/Worst Day""'s two and a half minutes of epic negation; less than 60 seconds in, Mike has called out C. Dolores Tucker, Bill O'Reilly, Al Sharpton, Kobe Bryant, BET, MTV, the new hos on ""Soul Train"", and the old hos on ""Soul Train"". It's no mere bitchfest, even if it barely stays on the rails-- his insights on hip-hop go from trenchant (""Q Tip singin', 'dre 3000 actin'/ Goddamn niggaz too good for this rappin'?"") to hopelessly lame (""We went from 'too black, too strong'/ To Sisqo and the goddamn Thong Song'""), before excoriating the church (""I'd rather let Eminem call me 50 niggaz/ Than break bread with a rich nigga readin' scripture"") and making an open-ended claim about sharing the same birthday as Hitler. Mike manages to sell these contradictions, not so much as a manner of charisma, but in the way his authoritative bark bullies his thoughts into line. ""Mama Said"" starts out evoking Biggie's ""Everyday Struggle"" (""I'm sick of waking up fucked up""), but as opposed to being a revelation about his foul lifestyle, his remorse comes from having no product to sell. By the end, his issues with the opposite sex have him espousing Chris Rock-style sympathy for his long-departed father and O.J. Simpson but he closes with pointed words for would-be trappers (""Throw the book at your black ass for cocaine/ I got a partner who ain't coming home til LeBron James in the Hall of Fame""). Not that Ghetto Extraordinary lacks a sense of humor. ""Gonna Go to Ghana"" pump-fakes as bullshit Dead Prez posturing before Mike puns off his atlas over the limber, Zapp-ed out funk of Andre 3000. Even the police brutality dissection of ""Shot Down"" is all the more effective for its caustic one-liners: ""I'm a young black male, that's a deadly profession/ Got more gun questions ask Charlton Heston."" It's one of the many times you can practically hear the classic vitriol of Ice Cube, at least until he shows up for the remix of ""Bad Day/Worst Day"". Cube famously cast himself as a rapper you love to hate, even if anyone who listened to his records couldn't help but love or at least admire him, period. If Killer wants it, he might be the second coming; by nature of its circumstances, Ghetto Extraordinary can't help but feel comparatively minor, but when he's hitting his targets this often, Killer Mike demands you make way for the South's prophet of rage.","Another major-label bungle: Killer Mike's should-be second LP for Sony is now this, a record he gave away on the internet three years after its creation.

HLLLYH,The Mae Shi,by: Jason Crock,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b488b1335d7bf169a76f/1:1/w_160/170d50db.jpg,2008-02-12 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11147-hlllyh/,Moshi MoshiTeam Shi,"Listener beware: If indie affectations such as tides of vocal harmonies, video game MIDI programming and Casio beats, concept albums, religious themes, or concept albums with religious themes give you ulcers, then HLLLYH might sent you running to your nearest message board to brag about how many songs it took you to erase it from your hard drive. But for anyone who's followed the Mae Shi, this has to come as some sort of payoff. The band has quit cramming as many breakneck riffs as possible into each convulsive track, chilled the fuck out, and begun to focus on linear songs. More than that, the L.A. six-piece has finally made an album that matches their grand ambitions, one that weaves most of their songwriting tricks together with some new ideas, and manages to be listenable and cohesive. This is the band who sold ""mixtape"" CD-Rs containing several hundred of their favorite songs at a few seconds each and DVDs with 30-plus videos, built their own synths, called previous albums ""hip-hoperas"" while sounding like the ugly rejected bits of new-wave at 77 RPM, and talked all sorts of shit while reigning spaz-rock terror on any club, supporting slot, or Bar Mitzvah that would have them. No longer; they now walk the walk. Vocalist Ezra Buchla (late of the excellent Gowns) has left the group, and his strangulated squall has been replaced by Jonathan Gray, who's got a slightly calmer yet still excitable voice. The band itself retains a caffeinated anxiousness that can make the hairs on your arm stand up, and Gray's self-harmonizing sounds desperately cheerful and pained to persuade, like the last plea for everyone to take the first sip of spiked Kool-Aid. That's no accident: Many of these songs aim for ""inspirational."" But even with the relentless perk and the seemingly Bible-thumping lyrics, they're still subversive and individualist. ""Run to Your Grave"" is the best summation of the record, and its high-water mark. Here, the lyrics sidle basic can't-take-it-with-you sentiments next to more subtle observations (""Emotion is a simple test to the synapse/ Don't let it fool you into thinking that you've got brains""), while the keyboards are sunny enough to burn flesh. On this track and elsewhere, Gray over-eagerly pushes us towards rapturous surrender, including a maybe-too-excited call for some old fashioned soul-reaving on ""Pwnd"" (""Do it fast! Make it hurt!"") and a lockstep denial of emotion and independent thought on ""Grave"". Likewise, the singer of ""Young Marks"" praises holy war as ""noble and divine"" through enough Autotune to induce laughing fits, and the campfire over-assurances of closer ""Divine Harvest"" (which let us know ""It'll be over when you die,"" with a rousing clamor at the end) are hardly calming. Even without those themes, the Mae Shi run through a gauntlet of gaudy ideas without ever losing steam, like the fleet-fingered riffs of ""Boys in the Attic"" (see what they did there?) or the community-theater shuffle of ""7xx7"", while memories of Nintendo loom large on ""The Melody"" and the ominous closing minutes of ""Leech and Locust"". All the shrill exultation and greasy glisten of hyper-compressed guitars and loping Casios build up to something like an album-length musical for the tweakers in after-school detention by a band that sounds the way Ecto-Cooler tasted. But it wouldn't be the Mae Shi without pushing themselves just beyond the reach of their ability, or letting listeners get too comfortable for too long. To wit: ""Kingdom Come"" is an 11-minute techno megamix of every song on the album, and it sits right in the middle of it. It's awful. But it would have been an enormous cop-out to put it at the end of the record or bury it as a hidden track, which they're probably aware of. Kudos to them for running headlong into their ambitions; they've earned the privilege.","Spaz-rockers the Mae Shi have finally made an album that matches their ambitions, one that manages to be listenable, cohesive, and catchy-- all new territory for the newly reconfigured L.A. six-piece.

Do You Like Rock Music?,British Sea Power,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b48f5e6ef9596932260c/1:1/w_160/a6cb3bce.jpg,2008-02-12 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11152-do-you-like-rock-music/,Rough Trade,"British Sea Power have been an ambitious band from the start. From their first guitar scribbles on 2003 debut, The Decline of British Sea Power, through the more streamlined songwriting on the 2005 follow-up, Open Season, the Brighton band have pushed themselves and their craft beyond simply re-creating rock music: The band perform dressed in vintage military uniforms on stages decorated with foliage, yet they never come off as ironic. Their approach is playful yet cerebral, like a logic puzzle. So, although the title of their third album, Do You Like Rock Music?, might seem overly straightforward for such a elusive group, its inquisitiveness is crucial: British Sea Power would like us to abandon our genres, subgenres, and microgenres. To hell with indie, post-punk, and new wave; for British Sea Power, all of these fall under the rock rubric. To this rock-critical end, the band recorded Do You Like Rock Music? around the world-- in a Czech forest, in a crumbling fort in Cornwall, and most tellingly, in Montreal with the Arcade Fire's Howard Bilerman and Godpseed You Black Emperor's Efrim Menuck. This is a band going for broke by going global. They inflate the plaintive guitar pop of Open Season to monumental proportions, amplifying every element until it sounds enormous and overwhelming. The epic choruses and chiming guitars on ""Waving Flags"" and ""Down on the Ground"" sound immodest, as if the overzealous band wants to convert all you nonbelievers: You don't just like rock music, you love it, you need it, you worship it. Rock music has a wonderful plan for your life. That's a huge undertaking for any artist, and of course British Sea Power come up short. Do You Like Rock Music? doesn't fail miserably-- which at least might have been more interesting-- but disappoints gently. These songs sound big in the usual ways, and that's a genuine shortcoming for a band that's made so much of its eccentricities over the years. Where formerly they made glancing references to bands like the Pixies and the Psychedelic Furs (singer Yan still sounds studiously like Richard Butler), the primary touchstone on Do You Like Rock Music? is U2. And not 1980s U2, 2000s U2. Too often the drama sounds painstakingly deliberate, rising and falling expectedly. ""No Lucifer"" even bullies you into chanting along with its shouted refrain ""Easy! Easy! Easy!"" but offers no cathartic reward or explanation for what will seem to many like an esoteric repetition. (It's actually a reference to a British wrestler.) The recording work by producer Bilerman, along with Menuck and Graham Sutton (of Bark Psychosis), sounds decorous but often impersonal. A quick-moving guitar winds through the first measures of ""Lights Out for Darker Skies"", but the band's wall of sound violently overtakes it. Later, the scrappy guitars on ""A Trip Out"" sustain the song from start to finish before ""Open the Door"" dials it back for a surprisingly tender folk-pop chorus and a strong, short guitar solo. But ""Canvey Island"" weighs down the album's middle section with its hesitant pace and expository lyrics: ""Like Canvey Island, 1953. Where many lives were lost, and the records of a football team."" This type of matter-of-factness forestalls any real wonder at the serendipity of nature and history (the song references a fatal flood), which British Sea Power conveyed so eloquently on previous albums. Despite the implications of the band name, British Sea Power don't work as well at this size and scope. They're in danger of becoming the Alarm to the Arcade Fire's U2. Curiously, these stadium-sized songs channel less passion, anger, or awe than their earlier work. Granted, emotion has never been the band's strong suit, but here, British Sea Power speak the language of big feelings with little to back it up. Do You Like Rock Music? sounds empty at its core, with a rock where its heart should be.","Playful yet cerebral British band unleashes its most ambitious, anthemic record to date.

Human Bell,Human Bell,by: Grayson Currin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b42d13d197565213aa7d/1:1/w_160/83c16716.jpg,2008-02-11 06:00:04,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11072-human-bell/,Thrill Jockey,"Opposites attract. Opposites react. If you've ever taken or even pondered physics or chemistry, you've heard these generalizations. The positive pole of a magnet pulls against another's negative pole, and sodium (a soft metal that can be cut with a butter knife at room temperature) reacts quickly with chlorine (a pale green gas much more dense than air at room temperature) to make table salt. Then Human Bell-- the instrumental two-guitarists-and-whoever collaboration between Arbouretum's David Heumann and Lungfish's Nathan Bell-- is the sound of two substances with like properties entering a room, filling a room, and leaving the room. Their presence is felt, but-- in their separate, simultaneous and similar states-- they affect little. That's not to say Human Bell, the Paul Oldham-tracked debut from the Baltimore-based duo, is noxious or even unpleasant. Rather, it's a collection of seven carefully played instrumentals too monotonous with regard to mood, composition and sound to make much of a lasting impression at all. Human Bell has its wondrous moments, like ""Splendor and Concealment"", which starts slow and spacious, like a rusty two-guitar theme for a field hand moseying along a stretch of barbed wire, looking for gaps in the barrier. It quickens and tightens suddenly, breaking the reverie as the guitars slip into tongue-and-groove, lick-and-complement counterpoint. ""Hanging From the Rafters"" works with similar two-part juxtaposition, opening through an ethereal vamp that moves with the spectral grace of a Loren Connors piece before abruptly shifting into a crusading march. Peter Townsend's circular drumming and Matt Riley's distorted washes of bowed guitar hold the interwoven guitar lines to the flame. It builds and releases, pauses, and finally erupts into the last five minutes. It's a victory march with a deserved denouement. But ""Hanging"" is as close as Human Bell comes to moving its audience or to creating a new atmosphere through its own reactions. The other tracks slowly move to points of high drama only to release suddenly, self-consciously aborting ideas that promise catharsis or conversion. Opener ""A Change in Fortunes"" spends seven minutes climbing to nothing, and ""Outposts of Oblivion"" ebbs like a tide above a tiny sea of quartz singing bowls. It's constantly foreboding, but that sense-- present from the start-- just looms and never delivers. The counterargument, of course, is that these are mood pieces, and that tracks without climaxes are more open to interpretation. Ironically, the track ""Ephaphatha"" (an Aramaic expression meaning ""to be opened"") is most guilty of the tease, Bell surrounding Heumann's guitar in ghastly trumpet tones. Always on the edge of eruption, it's easy to ignore. This give-and-retraction only reinforces monotony: Heumann and Bell compose differently, with Heumann preferring cyclical progressions and sudden arrivals to Bell's narrative logic and steady delivery. But both approaches mean these tracks all drive towards climaxes but grind into tedious halts. This half-commitment comes to a head in the closing 80 seconds, wherein opener ""A Change in Fortunes"" is reprised after the disc's mildly abrasive closer corrodes into a wash of echoes and refracted guitar tones. The glockenspiel's notes again twinkle above the dual crags of guitar, and the whole thing fades into the distance, announcing its own poetic significance through a musical inclusio. Trouble is, it feels neither like redemption nor realization; rather, it's just a reminder that-- for the past 45 minutes-- you've been sitting alone in a room with stable gases.

Yea Big & Kid Static,Yea Big + Kid Static,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b44bb1335d7bf169a720/1:1/w_160/7c9473a7.jpg,2008-02-11 06:00:03,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11097-yea-big-kid-static/,Jib Door,"A colleague of mine from Scotland enamored with the hopelessly vague ""Midwestern rap scene"" wondered whether he could make a hip-hop album in Glasgow and still have it sound like it came from Chicago. Which seemed like a fool's errand to me, since Chicago's native sons seem more united by geographical circumstances than a clutch of easily identifiable sonic signifiers. Judging from the likes of Lupe Fiasco, Kanye West, Common, or even Twista, it could just be a tendency to flip nerd status to a sword from a shield. If that's the case, Second City upstarts Yea Big and Kid Static certainly carry on the tradition. They met as a result of a message-board flame war, the CD insert is fully rendered in comic art, actual pictures have them capering like an interracial Junior Senior, and they unironically open up for Rhymefest. Safe to say they do this for the love. Prefuse 73 is frequently mentioned as a touchstone for Yea Big's production, probably because it's the easiest shorthand for ""hip-hop with glitch influences"" (poor Mush Records!). While Big isn't on some beats, rhymes, and life shit, he's also nowhere as confrontationally jarring as Herren; the way ""Static Leads the Coup"" stitches together new beats every 30 seconds is genuinely thrilling and organic, and yet, nothing feels like leavings from Warp's cutting-room floor. He does share a certain proclivity for exotic instrumentation-via-keyboard patches, but even the roly-poly tablas (""Joining Forces"") and gamelan tappings (""The Final Chapter"") play it four-on-the-floor. Cut out the half-minute interludes, and the exposed-wire ProTooling could pass for a lost Viktor Vaughn album. Yea Big & Kid Static indeed shares the democracy of Doom's records, but it might have scratched the surface of Madvillain or similarly fashioned projects (Foreign Exchange, DM & Jemini, DangerDoom) if it was a more equal partnership. At first blush, Kid Static has to do a lot to win you over with that overeager upper-register spit of his; he gradually eases into a comfort zone that's somewhere in the realm of Fatlip or even Sadat X, though he lacks either one's microphone presence or wordplay. It's mostly his job to keep things moving while Big chops it up, and he rarely strays far from rapping about the fact that he is currently rapping, even if there's supposedly some sci-fi storyline buried in here. Really, it's the sort of thing where you cringe in anticipation of him talking about ""real MC's"" or ""true hip-hop"" or something, but thankfully, that moment never comes. He can ride a beat with decent agility but other than a few lines about Jager shots and beef stew, the vocal parts of this tend to be serviceable, if not interchangeable. Good ideas, bad ideas, it doesn't matter-- they don't stay on anything for very long, and the 16 tracks clock in at a bullet-train velocity. Granted, their press kit has them in the lineage of Digital Underground, De La Soul and Biz Markie as an alternative to all the ""serious"" rap music (there it is), which is giving them too much credit; Sex Packets and 3 Feet High And Rising obviously had far more going for them than a vaguely elucidated aversion to gangsta shit, and even though the duo intends ""get up and dance"" music, the actual result is more liable to put a pep in your step as you take a post-lunch scroll through the internet's finer hip-hop blogs. Nonetheless, * YB&KS* is as much a tribute to the more playful forms of rap as it is a contribution to its survival, and it's hard to argue that the two fail to fulfill their modest ambitions.","Like fellow Chicago hip-hop artists Lupe Fiasco and Kanye West, this duo-- which met as a result of a message board flame war-- have a tendency to flip nerd status to a sword from a shield.

Kontpab,Mahjongg,by: Jason Crock,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b45a5e6ef959693225d2/1:1/w_160/117f7319.jpg,2008-02-11 06:00:02,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11108-kontpab/,K,"For as long as indie drummers have been riding hi-hats, Mahjongg have taken up the noble mission of keeping their home city weird. No one knows exactly what to expect from any given performance of theirs, and they've kept up the struggle of cultivating that spontaneity on record-- which has proven a much more difficult task. On their first EP, Machinegong, they were plastic pop purveyors, afro-poppers, dance-punkers, and whatever else the hell they felt like; scattered as the styles might have been, they struck an incredible balance on that first EP that they've less successfully charted on the records that have followed. But I can't blame them for not readily turning out another ""Aluminum"" or ""Hot Lava"". It must be chafing to be lumped in with the masses of one-trick ponies when Mahjongg were one of the only bands toying with beats from around the globe, not just early-eighties England. Now with the distance of a few years' time, we can hear how far apart Mahjongg are from the trend-- queasier, druggier, far more adventurous, and less likely to edit. Opener ""Pontiac"" plays with polyrhythms to get heads bobbing, starting out sounding like Konono no. 1 before arriving on a thick early 80s syncopated boom-bap. ""Problems"" gets more interesting and more seasick in its wobbling keyboard tones, and by the time the chimes come in near the end, its downtempo bounce sounds like a cousin to LCD Soundsystem's ""Someone Great"", like the early-morning hangover to that track's bittersweet euphoria. But there's plenty of moments where they're staking their own trail, far from what any similar artist might be doing. ""Tell the Police the Truth"" implores honesty in the face of legal confrontation, but you can't help but read sarcasm over its pounding doorknocker beats and myriad laser effects. It's part of Kontpab's strong middle section, bolstered by ""Those Birds Are Bats"", the track that shakes off any of the album's prior restraint as the singer belts out his most melodic turn and the drummer pounds out a 4/4 on the bass drum in heaving release. ""Wipe Out"" is perhaps too stiff and amelodic, reminiscent of some of the aimless experiments that dragged down Raydoncong 2005. The following track ""Teardrops"" is equally stiff, but far more layered and bewildering. Both this and ""Mercury"" seem to toy with modern minimal r&b-- ""Mercury"" more explicitly, as it's led by warbling vocals that follow the nimble two-step of the keyboards while alien chimes hover above it all. But closer ""Rise Rice"", for lack of a better word, is bonkers-- more polyrhthyms, more scary noises, and more drums that sound like the world is ending mark the band's own blazing, singular path. It's clearly the most stunning moment on an album that's stylistically all over the place; but does this make them underachievers, or are they leaving us wanting more? With an album this layered and omnivorous, there's not much to complain about, but if they'd used all the time they've spend on writing quasi-mystical press releases on songs as sophisticated as ""Rise Rice"", they might have more bands being compared to them.","This chaotic and energetic Chicago band returns-- queasier, druggier, far more adventurous, and less likely to edit-- to upstage the one-trick, dance-punk ponies to whom they've sadly been compared.

Wai Notes / Wilding in the West,Will OldhamDawn McCarthy,by: Andrew Gaerig,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b48ac0084474cd0c22bc/1:1/w_160/b8848ae0.jpg,2008-02-11 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11656-wai-notes-wilding-in-the-west/,Moontree Letterpress,"Will Oldham's (thankfully) crowded discography gained a pair of low-key releases in the past few months: Wai Notes, a set of The Letting Go demos and Wilding in the West, a Japanese/Australian-only live album from Oldham's 2007 tour that includes at least one ""remix"" by Royal Trux's Neil Michael Hagerty. On the heels of November's Ask Forgiveness EP, these releases risked giving off a ""Dear Fans: Thanks, also fuck off""-vibe, but since precisely no one's child is going Ivy League off of 10,000 copies of Wai Notes it's probably safe to assume we're being asked to pony up again in the name of Art. Wai Notes comes impeccably wrapped in stamped cardstock, its cover featuring a woman…in a woman suit, the backside boasting a glossy of a hambone Oldham sitting with The Letting Go collaborator Dawn McCarthy. What's not clear is why these 10 demos weren't packaged with their parent album instead of the more useful rarities disc Little Lost Blues, now difficult to obtain itself. The fickle nature of the Oldham cult all but assures that had Wai Notes preceded The Letting Go it would've been hailed as a return to sonically quaint beginnings; on at least two occasions Oldham sings the wrong lyric and immediately mutters a correction into the margin. And it is worth wondering why Oldham no longer makes records like ""The Signifying Wolf"", on which a tiny guitar unravels and exposes horny animal chants. But hell: The Letting Go, driven by Nico Muhly's tempest string arrangements, was the most clearly conceived record of Oldham's career. Airing the dirty laundry of sleepy-dog ballads like ""Then the Letting Go"" or ""I Called You Back"" does them no favors. Hearing Oldham tiptoe his way through ""Wai""-- his fingers hang over chords, as if he's trying to remember the changes-- is thrilling in a voyeuristic sort of way, but Oldham's is a catalog that already contains its share of flubbed notes. Wilding is harder to pin down but seems more useful. Recorded live in ""central coastal California"" (no specific venue or date is named), Wilding is pressed by Oldham distributors P-Vine (Japan) and Spunk (Australia), and it's a bit difficult to sort out: Hagerty's unexplained ""remix"" work includes the random and indecipherable ""Naked Lion"" and, more intriguingly, a cut-up of ""Lost Blues"" and ""God's Small Song"" deft enough to pass as one coherent piece. Ponder also the market that sees ""Little Small Song""'s ""fuck"" intrusively censored but ""Naked Lion""'s looped ""Yeah shit's hard"" given a pass. Wilding's tenuous cohesion still fares better than 2005's cobbled-together Summer in the Southeast. No one does loins-as-rock better than Oldham and he accordingly wrestles a set of quiet older tracks to the ground: ""O Let It Be"" and ""Three Questions"" are pugnacious, and Oldham has never presided over a moment as turgid as this band's teetering ""Master & Everyone"". Keyboardist Azita tenderly augments deep cut ""Weaker Soldier"" with barroom piano ambience. McCarthy shows for the Letting Go material, which sees its strings replaced with haughty electric keys and the burly electric guitar of Emmett Kelly. Then there's ""Magnificent Billy"", which is either a goof on ""Lay and Love"" or a live recording spliced with show banter: between harmonies Oldham and McCarthy alternate ""Just sayin' what's on my mind"" and ""Bonny Billy!…Bonny Billy!"" Right. Everyone is loose, everyone is happy in central coastal California, interjecting and harmonizing and remixing. Clear as mud.",,6.2,
Greatest,Bee Gees,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a14d13d19756521385c6/1:1/w_160/6fc65fff.jpg,2008-02-11 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11153-greatest/,RepriseReprise,"There were two Bee Gees, of course. First, there was the popular late-60s beat combo, who made a few waves in Australia before returning to England, where the three Gibb brothers-- Barry, Maurice, and Robin-- had lived before moving down under as kids. They enjoyed hit singles like ""New York Mining Disaster 1941"" and ""To Love Somebody"" and at least one great album, Odessa. Many of those early songs endured, but the Bee Gees were no longer household names by the time they teamed up with Atlantic Records house producer Arif Mardin to record an album called Main Course, the group's 11th, in 1975. That changed quickly. They cut Main Course in Miami, everyone involved was listening to Philly soul, and Mardin encouraged Barry Gibb to try singing some tunes in falsetto. You know what happened next: Singles ""Jive Talkin'"" and ""Nights on Broadway"" hit #1 and #7 in the U.S., respectively. Ten months later, journalist Nik Cohn would write a New York magazine cover piece called ""Tribal Rites of the New Saturday Night"" (a story later revealed to be completely fabricated) about a young, working-class Italian-American kid finding some kind of existential meaning in the new dance clubs that were popping up everywhere. The article led to a movie-- the soundtrack of which Bee Gees dominated-- and disco was on its way to taking over popular culture in the U.S. at the tail end of the 1970s. To a lot of people at the time, the Bee Gees were disco. They were the sun around which the rest of the not-so-brief fad revolved, the form's most important auteurs, the gold standard. This may come as news to younger music obsessives for whom disco was the underground movement that birthed Italo and house and techno and brought us Larry Levan and Arthur Russell. In this century, disco has undergone an interesting critical rehabilitation, with early figures like, say, the Loft's David Mancuso and the Gallery's Nicky Siano being celebrated for their contributions to underground dance music while the pop stuff has, for the most part, been pushed aside. This shift in emphasis was necessary. Disco needed to be understood in terms of its roots among marginalized subcultures (gay, black, Latino) and reclaimed by the people who made it happen in the first place, away from the glare of the media. Not to mention, the narrative of those years, as told in books like Last Night a DJ Saved My Life and Turn the Beat Around, is fascinating. Still, you can't help but feel that something important is being overlooked: Just how phenomenal some of this stuff was as pop, especially the Greatest of the Bee Gees. Here, on an expanded version of a 2xCD compilation that first appeared in 1979 and covered just five years, are 20 or so arguments. Some of them-- ""Jive Talkin'"", ""Stayin' Alive"", ""You Should Be Dancing"", ""Night Fever"", ""More Than a Woman"", ""Nights on Broadway"", ""Love You Inside Out"", ""How Deep Is Your Love""-- are unassailable. The Gibb brothers were on a dazzling songwriting roll during these years, penning Top 10s for themselves and others almost at will, and they also had a firm grasp on the possibilities of disco as a sonic phenomenon. They understood that it was a culture of records and not bands, so they strove to make the records perfect, polishing the mechanized beat to a blinding sheen. The liner notes to this reissue give this credit: ""Recorded on MCI's JH-556 Console and JH-16 24 Tape Recorders."" Sound mattered then, as it does now-- the mastering on this reissue is excellent. Beyond the overly familiar hits are a number of other good-to-great songs. ""Too Much Heaven"" from 1978 is a ballad with a winding structure Burt Bacharach would admire, though its extra saccharine cast puts it far below ""More Than a Woman"" and ""How Deep Is Your Love"" as far as Bee Gees slow-dance numbers. ""You Stepped Into My Life"" has a tougher, more funk-influenced beat that serves as an interesting contrast to Barry's falsetto, showing a possible road not taken had the ultra-smooth sound not panned out. ""Wind of Change"", from Main Course, with Ray Baretto on congas and Barry belting out the melody in his natural range, transposes the meatier Philly soul aesthetic without the refinement of later hits. ""Rest Your Love On Me"" is a welcome change-up-- a straight country ballad complete with pedal steel, hearkening back to the early Bee Gees' interest in rootsy forms, but doing do now with bright, twinkly production. There are four or five duds among the originals here, but that's still a good ratio for a half-decade. The extras are disappointing. The seven-minute 12"" remix of ""Stayin' Alive"" rules, with subtle edits, a bit more percussion, and a nice inversion of the horns stretching it out to a length that doesn't overstay its welcome. But the newly commissioned remixes are not just mostly dull but also weirdly dated, sounding very late 1990s. The Jason Bentley/Philip Steir remix of ""You Should Be Dancing"" turns it into a generic club fodder, the ""Count Da Money"" remix of ""If I Can't Have You"" by Julien and Raphael Aletti and the Supreme Beings of Leisure remix of ""How Deep Is Your Love"" are sterile neo-trip-hop seemingly designed for a Gap store soundsystem. The outside package doesn't mention the Teddybears remix of ""Stayin' Alive"" that closes the set, suggesting that was added later by someone who thought Greatest needed at least one remix that didn't adhere to a ten-year-old formula. While it's nothing amazing, its gritty, rockified neo-Justice squelch is worth a few plays at least. Weak remixes and a few duff songs aside, Greatest is the definitive statement of the Bee Gees peerless pop-disco prowess during the second phase of their career. The albums, especially Main Course, are worth tracking down; but Greatest is a convincing demonstration of why the Bee Gees mattered.","The Bee Gees are the gold standard for disco-pop.

Reunion Tour,The Weakerthans,by: Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b455b1335d7bf169a72c/1:1/w_160/464b01e8.jpg,2008-02-08 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11103-reunion-tour/,EpitaphAnti-,"Reunion Tour seems like a misnomer for the Weakerthans' fourth album, and not just because the Canadian rockers never really broke up. The band's frontman, ex-Propagandhi bassist John K. Samson, shares the literary storytelling and slightly nasal vocals of such singer/songwriters as the Mountain Goats' John Darnielle, Darnielle collaborator John Vanderslice, and (well, except for the nasal bleat) his own wife, Christine Fellows. As with Darnielle after he ditched the boombox for an actual studio, Samson's biggest challenge has always been coming up with musical accompaniments that live up to his expertly rendered narratives-- a task at which the Weakerthans, even at their best on 2000's Left and Leaving, have only partly succeeded. Like its predecessors, Reunion Tour sets Samson's brainy, sensitive lyrics to direct, melodic post-Built to Spill indie rock, with occasional alt-country twang. But the album still reads better than it sounds, and even on paper only sometimes lives up to past glories. Samson spins his yarns out of intense, intimate details, and when the greater fabric is as vibrant as those densely wrought fibers, Reunion Tour can be almost the match of those other musical storytellers' recent records. Witness the lonely bus driver of opener ""Civil Twilight"", who tries to take his mind off of lost love by reciting ""the names of provinces or Hollywood actors/ Oh, Ontario, oh, Jennifer Jason Leigh."" On ""Relative Surplus Value"", a businessman heads for the airport, his ""heart pumping pure mini-bar""; after he recounts losing his job, the song ends with a roundabout, conversationally phrased plea for help. ""Tournament of Hearts"" borrows its title from former Weakerthans tourmates Constantines' most recent album (which borrowed its name from the Canadian womens' curling championship), for a power-chord propelled vignette of a man shouting his insecurities at the yellowed sports championship banners on the bar wall. On ""Plea From a Cat Named Virtute"", from 2003's Reconstruction Site, Samson challenges another diffident protagonist to overcome his lack of self-confidence-- all from the point of view of a cat. The feline returns on Reunion Tour's ""Virtute the Cat Explains Her Departure"", building from keyboards and shuffling drums to a scraggly, dueling guitar solo on the album's most emotionally charged moment (at least if you like cats). But ""Hymn of the Medical Oddity"" is a midtempo plodder that makes more sense if you know it's about a man who was sexually reassigned at birth and ultimately committed suicide. And ""Elegy for Gump Worsley"", about a late hockey player with a rich punk-rock history, is an overwrought spoken-word piece that exposes how much the entire album has in common with book readings, not just rock tours, reunion or otherwise. ""Got more faults than the state of California/ and the heart is a badly built bridge,"" Samson sings on finale ""Utilities"", over weeping steel guitars. ""Make this something somebody can use,"" he adds. It's to the Weakerthans' credit that their lyric-driven songs can be, in a way, useful, at least by helping reassure the sentimental souls with whom Samson's deftly told stories resonate. Still, they're rarely as striking here as on the groups' previous albums. And even when the tales bear retelling, the staid accompaniment limits Reunion Tour's potential utility in a medium that's-- how did Gary Cherone put it?-- more than words.","Led by ex-Propagandhi bassist John K.

Make It Stop! The Most of Ross Johnson,Ross Johnson,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b447c0084474cd0c225d/1:1/w_160/491f795b.jpg,2008-02-08 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11093-make-it-stop-the-most-of-ross-johnson/,Goner,"Ross Johnson isn't much of a singer. He's a talker, taking the stage to rant and howl and generally hold forth on life, booze, women, music, booze, women, and death. For thirty years he's has been a mainstay on the Memphis roots punk scene, starting as a drummer for the locally famous Panther Burns and as a cohort of post-Big Star Alex Chilton. That's Johnson ranting on ""Baron of Love Pt. I"" on Like Flies on Sherbert. Over the years he has played in groups that could barely be called bands, like the short-lived Our Favorite Band, American Musical Fantasy, and the even-shorter-lived Young Seniors. Make It Stop! The Most of Ross Johnson, from Memphis-based Goner Records, is his first ""career"" retrospective, featuring 24 tracks that include an assortment of sloppy covers, inspired digressions, and gloriously messy rockabilly and garage-band riffs served up like local delicacies. If you were to ask him, Johnson would likely say the comp doesn't warrant your money or your time. ""The main feeling I have when I listen back to these pieces (I won't call them songs) is discomfort,"" he writes in the liners. ""I loved recording them, but I can't listen to them without cringing and feeling ashamed."" The self-denigration continues: ""To be a real musician takes a certain amount of conceit and bravado that I just don't have. Oh, I've got plenty of sociopathic nerve when it comes to performing."" Thank God he's not a real musician. A ""real musician"" wouldn't be able to turn his middle-class autobiography and mental and moral ailments (both real and imagined) into Southern monologues that are simultaneously hilarious, uncomfortable, and tragic. ""So I says to her, 'What part of I have a personality disorder don't you get?'"" Johnson exclaims on the short, stubby live track ""My Mission"", then admonishes the crowd: ""Ya get it? You should be ashamed! Man, I hope I make somebody feel uneasy, 'cause that's my mission."" No critic could put it more succinctly, although Johnson himself lists critic on his c.v. (he wrote for Creem when Lester Bangs was editor). How's this for uneasy? The virtuously obnoxious ""Signify"" begins with this confession: ""Did you ever get drunk at your daughter's birthday? I have. Ah boy. I got caught, too!"" The matter-of-factness of his delivery makes you believe he speaks from personal experience. That Johnson, a self-described ""Southern sissy,"" has managed to eke out what some might call a career from his hysterical ravings is testament to his onstage charisma, his singularly ""sociopathic nerve."" Even when he's talking about being ten and seeing his first naked girl (one of the twelve-year-old twins next door, on ""Nudist Camp""), he's always funny, charming, dignified-- not to mention a little taken aback at his own self-destructive tendencies. This self-realization makes him ultimately sympathetic and in turn earns him the loyalty of local musicians like Jay Reatard (who mastered this comp) and Monsieur Jeffrey Evans (with whom Johnson currently plays) as well as writers like Robert Gordon (author of the indispensable It Came from Memphis) and Andria Lisle, who recounts booking Johnson as an opening act for unsuspecting groups like Smog and Palace Bros. Wish I could have seen that. Currently a librarian at the University of Memphis, Johnson is not acting the rock star part, but simulating and satirizing it. He realizes that between his talents and the rock star ideal lies a vast, unbridgeable schism, and whenever he tries to play down his reputation as an object of notoriety, he does so with such grizzled savoir faire that he only feeds the legend. As a rock antihero, what makes Johnson special is precisely his lack of talent-- which impels him to redefine what it means to be a real musician. He challenges our expectations, parodies our need to know the person behind the song by giving us too much of himself, by going waaaaaaaay too far. These chunks of autobiography are as grossly revealing as GG Allin's shit, Sid Vicious' bloody chest, or Iggy Pop's cock, and yet, Johnson doesn't appear to be exaggerating or gratuitously exposing himself. Instead he's storming the castle through a back entrance, a beer bottle in one hand and a spittle-wet mic in the other. He knows he can't bring the fortress down, but he can be better heard shouting from the turrets. Mission accomplished.","This Memphis original was a one-time associate of Alex Chilton and a former rock critic for Creem; the 24 tracks on this overview include an assortment of sloppy covers, inspired digressions, and gloriously messy rockabilly and garage-band riffs.

All Is Well,Samamidon,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b4869d034d5c69bf4ea1/1:1/w_160/42ff8bcb.jpg,2008-02-08 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11145-all-is-well/,Bedroom Community,"Samamidon (or Sam Amidon, as he sometimes bills himself) hails from Vermont and is the scion of a musical family with roots in Appalachia. A contributor to such indie projects as Doveman and Stars Like Fleas, he recorded five albums with his band Assembly before releasing a debut solo album of traditional Irish tunes performed on solo fiddle. A second full-length, But This Chicken Proved Falsehearted, out last year on Plug Research, might be called his first ""proper"" release, if only because it was the first with a marketing push and a wide availability. Even so, it didn't move too far from what came before: old folk songs translated to new, modern contexts. And a Tears for Fears cover. Amidon's new album, the ominously titled All Is Well (very little is ever well in these songs), again includes new readings of public domain compositions, and yet it feels like a great leap forward, thanks to Amidon's more relaxed approach and the contributions of composer Nico Muhly, himself a Vermonter. Where Chicken was well-meaning but occasionally dry, the trio of artists responsible for the record-- Amidon, Muhly, and Icelandic producer Valgeir Sigurðsson (All Is Well was recorded at Sigurðsson's Greenhouse Studios in Reykjavik and released on his Bedroom Community label)-- create a very specific space with these arrangements, which goes beyond simply setting mood and atmosphere. These songs inhabit their own world, closed off from the rest of humanity. Eschewing the hammy theatrics of indie folkies like Langhorne Slim and Two Gallants, All Is Well is an exceedingly private album, designed to usher you in and shut out everything else around you. It's a headphones album, but not one that relies on studio effects to maintain your interest. It helps that these songs typically traffic in internal monologues with a first-person narrator. In ""Saro"" Amidon sings the part of an immigrant from an unnamed country who describes the vast land around him and takes both grief and solace in missing his true love back home. Later, the singer inhabits the title character of ""Prodigal Son"", matter-of-factly recounting his fateful homecoming. Amidon sells these sentiments with a soft croak, not unpretty but also not expected. Despite his lifelong training, he manages to sound untrained-- a regular soul comforting himself with music before confronting a bleak world again. His voice breaks evocatively when he hits the high notes on Dock Boggs' ""Sugar Baby"", conveying the continual ache of a lost loved one: ""I'll rock the cradle when you're gone,"" Amidon sings, as if mustering the stoicism needed to face the next day. Muhly's arrangements prove decidedly more modern, drawing inspiration from the repetitions of Philip Glass, the drones of Max Richter, and the flutteriness of Sufjan Stevens. ""Little Johnny Brown"", a folk tune popularized by Ella Jenkins in the 1960s, percolates with ambient noise-- fragments of piano, pots and pans percussion, unidentified thumps-- that coalesces into a calamitous drone. Surprisingly, it works. Throughout All Is Well, Amidon, Muhly, and Sigurðsson slow these songs considerably, but the curious instrumentation ensures they never lose momentum. Banjo and spoons generate tension on ""Fall on My Knees"" as a lone fiddle swirls in the background, and ""Wild Bill Jones"" and ""O Death"" are anchored by mournful horn fanfares and sustained piano notes that fade in and out between Amidon's vocals. All Is Well is sequenced so that the uptempo tunes crowd the album's middle section, offsetting the gravity of what comes before and will come afterwards with a pair of celebratory songs. Flickering woodwinds and heavy strings add a sense of theatrical expectancy to the relatively spry ""Wedding Dress"" and ""Little Satchel"", which complement each other nicely and give a hopeful spin to an otherwise grave album. Occasionally, Muhly's score sounds too busy for such modest songs, but mostly the instruments interact so closely with Amidon's understated vocals that the arrangement and the performance become indistinguishable. This quality makes All Is Well a very forward-thinking album, despite its reliance on traditional tunes. With his team of musicians working so closely together, Amidon doesn't just update the old world to the new, but finds the roots of the new world in the old.","A contributor to Doveman and Stars Like Fleas, Samamidon's latest album of indie folk again includes new readings of public domain compositions, and yet it feels like a great leap forward, thanks to Amidon's more relaxed approach.

Because he toured with Sunn O))) and has been releasing albums on Hydra Head the past couple of years, he's often one of the few USBM acts those new to the genre know about, and so his hate-filled one-man post-Burzum (and Graveland) riffing appears particularly central to ""the scene."" But then, there are the countless USBM acts who prefer to remain on much smaller labels than Hydra Head -- labels that only deal in black metal -- and would consider being spoken about in a non-metal rag anathema and counterproductive (believe me, there are dozens of hardliners who've politely declined inclusion in Show No Mercy). Conner pulls distancing moves like refusing to do interviews for his newest record and his press information for 2007's Defective Epitaph made fun of the idea of listing ""selling points"" for a black metal album, but c'mon: Most of the USBM underground doesn't have P.R. guys or one-sheets to even tell you that. It's not that Conner's an outcast-- USBM acts like Texas one-man project Brown Jenkins or Seattle's Krohm, thank Malefic in their liners -- though he's certainly not without his detractors. See, for instance, this sort of rage. Outside of that kind of scene silliness or, conversely, hipster festishization, when Conner's on, his shit's among the best on any continent (stop booing, Norwegians). He has a brilliance for creating suffocating atmospheres that are both beautiful and claustrophobic (sometimes it's impossible to believe his homegrown recordings weren't captured in the basement of a cathedral). On top of production prowess, his unique whispered, dry-rot, bird-like voice is piercing, chilling, and light as air, all at the same time. It's a unique, influential delivery...those who sound like him have usually copped his style. Interestingly, pairing Conner's 2001 A Gate Through Bloodstained Mirrors with 2007's Defective Epitaph feels like entering the crossroads (of someone who's already made his deal with the devil, natch), witnessing the musician wrestling with where to go next with his project. The excellently bleak, pummeling 2006 release Subliminal Genocide continued and deepened the template of Conner's past raw melodic black metal (see, for instance, 2002's Nocturnal Poisoning or 2004's Telepathic With The Deceased). He didn't do anything too radically different than before -- he just mastered his art. A year later on Defective Epitaph, though, he boldly mixes it up some by introducing live drums. That may not sound particularly significant, but those programmed beats provided the steady skeleton for his psychedelic spiraling. Conner still has the snarl in his signature ghostly throat-shredding and the gloomy, phased guitar layers, but he loses much of the propulsion -- like ""Purgatory Spiral"" kinda does feel a tad like Purgatory -- when he picks up sticks. He just isn't that great a drummer. The other weakness here? The guitar sound isn't up to the standards of his past output. There are gorgeous (as well as relatively blistering) moments that overcome his skinsman and production shortcomings. It's not a bad album -- hell, the layers of noise he achieves on something like ""Oration of Ruin"" are truly glorious. Elsewhere, out-of-twang, ethereal treks like ""Dehumanizing Procession"" and the lovely super atmospheric cello scraping of closer ""Unblessed Be..."" collide like the angular weirdness of Blut Aus Nord. ""Cemetery of Shattered Masks"" includes a streaming guitar and synth-y combo that bolsters the percussion. More than ever before, there's a certain natural spaciousness like Drudkh's Anti-Urban EP. So, again, it's a matter of whether you prefer Malefic recorded in a coffin inside a hearse or outside in the cold Cali mountains. For the more whirlwind tracks, like ""A Memorial To The Waste Of Life"" or ""Legacy Of Human Irrelevance"", it's the drums that become irrelevant, disappearing into the feedback, mucking up the bluster instead of increasing its power. His playing works when he's able to plow ahead (like a drum machine), but if he tries to switch it up, it lags. This isn't to say live drums couldn't work on a Xasthur album -- he started out with a drummer, Ritual -- but they'd be more successful, perhaps, with someone else playing them (like, maybe Wrest from Leviathan, who can pound with the best of 'em). For a look at Conner at his best, grab a copy of A Gate Through Bloodstained Mirrors, a massive document that was first released in an edition of 150 CD-R's by in 2001, then remixed and reissued by Total Holocaust in 2004. This 2-CD set is purportedly the definitive edition and it's a melancholic, depressive, atmospheric masterpiece. For those unfamiliar with the collection it also tellingly includes Burzum (""Black Spell Of Destruction"") and Mütiilation (""Eternal Empire Of Majesty Death"") covers. What, no Graveland? Additionally, this reissue comes with a second disc featuring six previously unreleased tracks from the same period-- including, fascinatingly, ""Untitled - Rehearsal June '97"". There really is something about watching Conner's process, because when he's at his peak, what he does feels very much like art. Throughout the proper 15-track album the mix is deep with waxy counterpoint and expressive clean lines. Unlike Defective, the vocals aren't placed so upfront: Wisps of agitation and anger, they're buried more in the mix, occasionally surfacing and piercing the clatter. There are more vocal layers-- almost spectral, albeit homemade choirs. Take the excellent 12-minute ""Suicide In Dark Serenity"". As its drums speed up into a sorta march, it feels like sounds are filling a room from all sides, sucking out the oxygen. And even tiny moments like the closing ""Lost Behind Bloodstained Mirrors"" or the synthesized instrumental ""Storms Of Red Revenge Part 2"" drip with a concrete sadness. You'll also hear the title track, which later showed up in different form on Nocturnal Poisoning and (truly excellently) on To Violate The Oblivious. Throughout, there's a strong sense of narrative and procedural push, exploration than with Defective. The entire album -- though ragtag and numbingly long -- feels more like a whole. Its massiveness is its strength, the obsessive noise of one man careening. Try to find a dull spot.",,6.9,
Here's to Being Here,Jason Collett,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b481ea9e61561daa6c73/1:1/w_160/4f700e09.jpg,2008-02-08 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11141-heres-to-being-here/,Arts & Crafts,"Jason Collett's two prevailing musical interests aren't just different, they're diametrically opposed. He's Humpty Dumpty and the king's men, pushing rock music over a ledge with Broken Social Scene, reassembling the pieces under his own name. And he draws a fairly strict line between these two manifestations of his music-- banjos on one side, distortion on the other-- although occasionally, a fugitive sound slips across the divide, such as the sequenced background twitter that underpins the clicky acoustic rock of ""Roll on Oblivion"", the first track on his new album. But by and large, there's no indication that Collett's two styles are heading for an intersection. His eponymous music is like an abandoned railway line-- an evocative relic from a bygone era-- running parallel to the newer, shinier tracks he's laying with Broken Social Scene. As was the case with Collett's last album, Idols of Exile, his latest is a loving ode to his fellow Americana-obsessed Canadians in the Band. As a singer, charitable ears might hear Collett splitting the difference between Levon Helm's gritty soul and Rick Danko's cartoonish over-enunciation. Less charitable ones will notice that he's pilfered Bob Dylan's vocal tics wholesale, evoking an alternate universe where The Basement Tapes were the beginning of a long unbroken collaboration, not a prelude to divergence. ""Southern gentleman and your Bonaparte ways,"" he keens on ""Roll on Oblivion"", ""no need to get philosophic,"" the last vowel going reedy and nasal. Like Dylan, Collett also likes to periodically let his vocal melodies flatten out into monochromatic smudges, as he does on the opening line of punchy rocker ""Papercut Hearts"". And he has a romantic attachment to highways, slum-dwellers, saints, harmonicas, and roadhouses. But all of this happens at the surface level, while at heart, Dylan and Collett are very different singers. Dylan has a way of feeling out his voice like a cautious swimmer probing uncertain depths: he pushes out into it, decides it feels okay, pushes a little further. Collett, quite simply, can sing, and lacks Dylan's sense of hesitancy and prodigious effort. His voice is naturally expressive and supple, capable of smoothly moving from a dusty wheeze to a weightless falsetto. When he sings, amid the smoky piano chords of ""Henry's Song"", that he's ""drunk on the blood of luuuh-huuuv,"" it sounds more like an aesthetic choice than an impassioned loss of vocal control. This mannered, understated virtuosity permeates Collett's music, just like it did the Band's. The simple hitch and glide of ""Roll on Oblivion"" gets dressed up with reverbed guitar leads, judicious fringes of maraca, and vocal echoes. The blues licks prickling through the lite-groove of ""Sorry Lori"" are downright foppish, and ""Somehow"", with its carefully tended disembodied harmonies, sounds like something Thom Yorke might make were his computer confiscated. Collett's songs seem to begin with emotional and melodic immediacy but end in embellishment. These highly polished exteriors, paired with his superficial similarities to Dylan, make Collett's music seem like an art of pure surface, no matter how sincere his declarations of heartbreak may be. This isn't a strike against him, because the surface is quite fine. It simply reveals a telling inversion: Collett's indie rock-- typically the province of irony and disaffection-- smolders with spontaneous inspiration, while his trad-rock, which is typically the province of direct emotional candor and raw-boned effusion, sounds more academic. Perhaps there's more of a dialogue happening between Collett's two personae than is immediately apparent.","Broken Social Scene member follows his previous solo album, Idols of Exile, with another loving ode to his fellow Americana-obsessed Canadians: the Band.

Transmutations,Yakuza,by: Brandon Stosuy,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b446ea9e61561daa6c13/1:1/w_160/d005ae29.jpg,2008-02-07 06:00:05,Jazz,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11092-transmutations/,Prosthetic,"When Yakuza hits the bulls eye, they bludgeon. ""Meat Curtains"", the opening track on Transmutations, the Chicago progressive metal quartet's follow-up to 2006's Samsara, is one hell of a song. From its opening distorted chords (slow, barely tapped out) and vocalist/saxophonist Bruce Lamont's heart attack-inducing bellow through the nimble but messily clamoring drums, jagged guitars, and sludgy stoner harmonies, it's like a Baroness/Mastodon hybrid slowly flailing for life and moving toward its spastic grindcore-like close. A couple of tracks later, ""Congestive Art-Failure"" finds Lamont doing some underwater gargle before peeling into a heavier slam that reminds me of ""In The Meantime"" when it starts cycling forward, though that's likely weird pesonal residue (it's way crustier than Helmet would've been with their tight-on-the-side cuts and Branca calling cards). The one clean voice/one shredded tongue chorus is also legtimately catchy, like a fucking Neurosis pop song. What happens when they miss? It's not that they whiff...they wander. I've been living with the album for quite some time and whenever I plop it in my expectations are high after ""Meat Curtain""'s seven minutes and ""Congestive Art-Failure""'s quick jabs. Somewhere around the halfway point, though, when one too many songs have meandered or pummeled somewhat generically or felt like not-grand-enough grand finales, I leave disappointed. It's not that I don't enjoy the excursions: ""Meat Curtain""'s followed by the slower, Eastern-tinged ""Egocide"". Lamont plays sax on this one (and on the upcoming Nachtmystium album Assassins). It has an almost cool-jazz vibe, only more psychedelic and downcast, and with lines like ""tear out your eyes/ So you can see."" It works. It's the first of these sorts of pieces on the record. It's almost eight minutes long and it slays. After you've run into the third or fourth of the smokey, waylaying jams...the initital charm turns a bit into tedium. It doesn't help that the tracks always alternate slow, fast, slow, fast. The wax on/wax off ends up feeling calculated-- like things are never allowed to flow naturally. This is an actual order: ""Raus"", Isis-style with doubled echo-y harmonies, is followed by ""Steal the Fire"", which races by in two minutes and change. Then comes ""The Blinding"", slower but with bigger yowls, wicked atmospherics, more Eastern tunings and ""Existence Into Oblivion"", another fast one (with great harmonies this time). The best of the sax-y slow ones, ""Perception Management"", opens with sinewy clean guitars and after the two-minute intro the moody sax develops and attitude-- by the end of the track's seven-plus minutes, it's shredding in some kinda possessed call and response with the rest of the band. The album's plenty intense. It lulls and then attacks-- but it strays too much to nail things into the ground. Conversely, it's expansive, but only teasingly so. Yakuza have been around a long time, are known for their interest in, and interweaving of, various strains of world music and psychedelia into their metal. It can be totallly gorgeous. The percussion, or one, is always varied, interesting-- Hand drums to oil drums. Each player has a lot to offer: They're great musicians with an interesting sense of space. So, what the fuck? Maybe they need an editor type to tell them where to nip and tuck, where to let it out. Each song has so much in it, you're exhausted, but the exhaustion never goes far enough. Neither path's followed far enough. See the issue? All this back and forth and public self-debate and new math is coming from someone who swears by OV, Asunder, Deathspell Omega, Merzbow, and the La Monte Young back catalog in equal parts. Which is why I'm going into such detail. Transmutations has the ingredients and indulgence and eccentricity I normally love. Too much of the time, it just doesn't get the job done.","The Chicago progressive metal quartet's follow-up to 2006's Samsara finds them again weaving various strains of world music and psychedelia into their metal, at times with stunning results.

Blade Runner Trilogy: 25th Anniversary,Vangelis,by: Mike Orme,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b45d5e6ef959693225d4/1:1/w_160/faf91dc9.jpg,2008-02-07 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11110-blade-runner-trilogy-25th-anniversary/,Interscope,"Ridley Scott's future-noir Blade Runner turned 25 last year, and to commemorate the landmark, the director unveiled yet another tweak with Final Cut. Since its 1982 release, the film has gone back to the editing room a number of times-- for separate U.S. and European theatrical releases, as well as an unauthorized Director's Cut. Scott released his own Director's Cut in 1992 that removed the voice-over by protagonist Rick Deckard, and also suggested he was-- gasp-- a replicant. With Final Cut, Scott seems to have settled on the story he wanted to tell: No voice-over, re-inserted footage, scrubbed-up sound, and another possible change regarding Deckard. Greek composer Vangelis's Golden Globe-nominated Blade Runner score has taken a similarly ephemeral path. The first version released of the film's soundtrack wasn't even done by Vangelis, but consisted of adaptations from the New American Orchestra that Scott disparagingly calls ""muzak."" Vangelis himself didn't release his version of the soundtrack until 1994, and his version included a number of ""inspired by"" pieces, but paradoxically left out a big portion of his score. For the 25th Anniversary edition, much of that missing music is finally released. The 1994 version of the soundtrack appears here in its entirety on the first disc, finally getting remaster treatment after the questionable sound quality of the original release. Vangelis's enduring classics like ""Love Theme"" and ""Memories of Green"" have never sounded clearer or more timeless: stunning synthesized counterpoint to the bleak, noirish landscape of Scott's 2019 Los Angeles. Certainly not as iconic as the title theme to Chariots of Fire, and not as busy or sunny as his late-70s sequencer-driven albums like Spiral and China, Vangelis's score nevertheless effortlessly evokes the seamy underbelly of a futuristic megapolis. The unreleased material of the second disc is the second treat offered by this re-issue. The disc includes classic works like the piece accompanying Dr. Tyrell's death and the theme to Deckard and replicant Roy Batty's duel. Vangelis organizes the disc much like his original, setting up loose transitions between works and letting themes wash in and out with little discernable chronology. These pieces are of no less quality than the original soundtrack pieces, but they fit more into the background. These stylized impressions are certainly some of the most ambient works in Vangelis's decidedly ambient score. One of two bonus tracks, ""Desolation Path"", appeared in the unauthorized Director's Cut but is given wide release for the first time, and its stark, cathartic synth may just be the best new material. Given the much-discussed nature of Blade Runner, it's a little confusing that Vangelis tacked on a whole disc of new compositions and didn't just release the entire score. The works on the third disc are certainly fine on their own, a nice return by Vangelis to the synthesized new age that he doesn't compose much anymore. The work on this disc sounds dated at times, and sort-of purposelessly includes muffled spoken-word performances from the likes of Ridley Scott, Oliver Stone, and Roman Polanski. Is it really necessary to include, as Vangelis does on ""No Expectation Boulevard"", actual dialogue of Ridley Scott discussing the Final Cut project? Little details like this are inexplicably slapdash. There are no liner notes from the composer himself, and only a page of exposition from Scott. The greatest surprise is the unedited main title theme wasn't included. Still, it's a major improvement over a soundtrack that has been, like the film, a narrative in flux. We're a little more certain now of Vangelis's desolate near-future vision, rooted in his ambient and new age roots but rarely sounding like a product of its time. Too bad it's not quite The Final Score we all were waiting for.","Much like director Ridley Scott has with the film, composer Vangelis has frequently overseen the tweaking of Blade Runner's score, and here he adds a second disc of unreleased material and again effortlessly evokes the seamy underbelly of a futuristic megapolis.

Sex Death Cassette,Rafter,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b46b13d197565213aae3/1:1/w_160/79be4780.jpg,2008-02-07 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11123-sex-death-cassette/,Asthmatic Kitty,"Rafter Roberts plays in indie pop band Bunky, pals around with Sufjan Stevens, and engineers albums by California bands like Black Heart Procession and Pinback. But ""jingle writer"" is his most salient CV line regarding his new album, Sex Death Cassette. It's an eclectic reel of curios and bagatelles that stick in your head the way good jingles do, though since they aren't selling anything besides Rafter's sensibility, their compositional craftiness is wedded to a lo-fi humility. Some of them are just little jags of inspiration: ""I Love You Most of All"" is a half-minute refrain for spooky falsetto and awkward acoustic guitar, like a lost Shudder to Think interlude. ""Cuddling Raccoons"" is a minute-long burst of handclaps and knob-twiddled garage riffs. And ""Adventures"" is a verse in search of a chorus, with a tripping groove and hearty brass flares making its concise point. While the brief songs are satisfying fun-- they sound more economical than half-cooked-- Rafter does a good job of building more spacious scaffolding around his little lightning flashes when he cares to. The frilly vocal refrain of ""Sleazy Sleepy"" is parroted by horn line that would've made a nice little mini-song in itself. ""Sleazy Sleepy"" also features the kind of staticky, simple groove-- a simple template ready to receive Rafter's judicious embellishments-- that characterizes the album, from ""ZZZPenchant"", a baggy lockstep with snapping brass banners, to ""Love Time Now Please"", a Caribbean cameo with more of Rafter's beloved, jubilant horns. The album's title is two-thirds red herring: It has indie rock's typically circumspect relationship to sex, and good luck finding it on cassette. ""Death"" is the key word here, as the lion's share of these overcast yet stubbornly sunny songs revolve around it, albeit usually in a playful, almost irreverent manner. This is largely because Rafter practices a sort of laughing-to-the-gallows eschatology; he rages against the dying of the light with a smirk. ""They left us here to die,"" he sings on ""Asking"", ""but we're not ready to die!"" The sentiment is exactly opposite to the one prevailing in current big-ticket indie rock, exemplified by the Arcade Fire, where the magnitude of the end of self is tacitly conflated with the magnitude of global apocalypse. Rafter doesn't wallow in, despair of, or mythologize death; he healthily accepts it as a natural and absolutely necessary facet of life, which perhaps explains how such a death-obsessed record can be so innocent of grand statements and undue angst. He celebrates life by acknowledging its brevity. ""Life is good, you can't complain,"" he shrugs during the quicksilver indie-rock of ""Chances"". ""We are the lucky ones."" And on the junkyard indie-blues of ""Slay Me"", he gently chastises musicians who ""throw it all away for a sad melody that you can't even hum."" While everyone needs a sad melody sometimes-- Rafter gets off a few himself, although they're always hummable-- it scans as a subtle dig against the kind of self-serious, dour indie rock that Sex Death Cassette is such a relief from.","Rafter Roberts (Bunky) engineers albums by California bands like Black Heart Procession and Pinback, and here offers an eclectic reel of curios that stick in your head like jingles.

Old Growth,Dead Meadow,by: Tom Breihan,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b46e13d197565213aae7/1:1/w_160/98bb450a.jpg,2008-02-07 06:00:02,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11126-old-growth/,Matador,"I used to know a bunch of indie-rap kids in Baltimore who claimed they didn't listen to any rock music other than the Stooges and Dead Meadow. To them, Dead Meadow made (I'm paraphrasing from hazy memory) ""blunted head-nod shit."" And so, for at least a few, the D.C. band's endlessly languid psyche-rock riffage made them functionally pretty similar to, say, Pete Rock. Like Pete Rock, Dead Meadow have spent years working variations on an introverted thump, switching up their endless-repeat rhythmic ebb and flow just enough to stay interesting. Running out of ideas has never really been a problem for these dudes, since ideas are not their stock and trade. They make a dreamy shoegaze-informed strain of early-1970s blooz-choogle power-trio rock, and that's all they've ever made. But now they're 10 years and five albums into their existence, and at this point, it's hard to stay patient with this stuff. At their live shows, Dead Meadow sound gorgeously heavy for the first 20 minutes or so and then progressively more boring for every minute afterward. By now, their albums are starting to work the same way, and that's sort of a problem. Since the release of 2005's Feathers, the band has relocated from D.C. to L.A. and returned to being a trio after additional guitarist Cory Shane came and went. Listening to Old Growth, though, there's barely any indication that anything has ever changed for this band. They've curbed some of their most indulgent impulses; there's no equivalent here to ""Untitled"", the 14-minute jam that ended Feathers. And they've made a few fruitful inroads into Espers-esque acoustic acid-folk; the vaguely Middle Eastern flourishes of ""Seven Seers"", in particular, stand out from an otherwise indistinguishable set of watery ambling riffage. It's weird how Stephen McCarty's drums seem to bang harder when they sound like they're being played on a phone book rather than on actual drums. For the most part, though, Old Growth is exactly what this band has always done. The guitars lazily sprawl skyward, the bass burbles steadily, the cymbals splash. As autopilot as this band can be, there's always something there: A nice longing vocal melody, a beautifully assured guitar solo, a droning Mellotron that sets everything else off just right. But the record is dominated by nodded-out midtempo chugs like ""I'm Gone"" and ""The Great Deceiver"" and ""Hard People/Hard Times"", the last of which features some awfully incongruously angry protest lyrics even as the music exudes something less than apoplectic rage. Dead Meadow can write songs like these in their sleep, and they probably do. Tidal drift is nothing new to this band. They've never made anything that much resembles metal, mostly because they've always buried their Sabbath-stomp riffs under layer upon layer of sleepy reverb and because Jason Simon's voice is a dead ringer for Jason Pierce of Spiritualized's icy nasal monotone. Inertia's always been there in the music, but it's never made its presence felt quite as much as it does on Old Growth. And so the album's standout moment is the only one where they show some teeth. ""'Till Kingdom Come"" is a slow, woozy jam, and nothing immediately sets it apart from anything else here. But then you notice that the central riff is genuinely heavy, that the band seems locked-in and alive. Drugs and diffusion will always be big parts of Dead Meadow, but those things can exist alongside discipline and purpose. It'd be nice if they just seemed a little more, I don't know, awake.","Despite a few twists, this is mostly what Dead Meadow have given us for a decade: nodded-out midtempo chugs of stoner rock.

Here Come the 123s,They Might Be Giants,by: Douglas Wolk,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b47513d197565213aaf1/1:1/w_160/cebe020e.jpg,2008-02-07 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11132-here-come-the-123s/,IdlewildWalt Disney,"It's easy, in theory, to write educational pop songs for kids-- just set a bunch of facts to a simple tune-- but it's incredibly tough in practice. A good educational record has to make kids want to hear it over and over, until the intended lesson sinks in, but it also has to make their parents not want to stab themselves in the ears on the thirty-seventh play. They Might Be Giants found a new niche for themselves with their second children's album, 2005's Here Come the ABCs: Their goofy-little-tunes engine was on precisely the right setting to hold the attention of goofy little people, and the formal constraints of writing songs about letters and the alphabet spurred the Johns' inventive impulses. There were still too many half-developed throwaways, but they came through with some genuinely funny conceits like ""Can You Find It?"" and ""Alphabet of Nations"", the latter of which actually ended up on their set lists at shows for grown-ups. The video version of ABCs went gold, so they've come through with a sequel-- this time, naturally, it's a set of songs about numbers. The high water mark in that category is still Multiplication Rock, an ingenious set of three-minute tunes written by Bob Dorough for the ""Schoolhouse Rock"" Saturday-morning cartoons in the early 70s: perhaps you've heard De La Soul sampling ""Three Is a Magic Number"" or the Lemonheads' cover of ""My Hero, Zero"". TMBG's number-songs, though, aren't anywhere near as neatly crafted, and the problem comes down to the fact that they simply aren't math guys. They're language guys, and they only really have a use for numbers as linguistic constructs. Dorough's Multiplication Rock songs worked because they were about the mathematical properties of numbers, and the Giants' mostly just incorporate the names of numbers. The lyrics to the John Linnell-sung ""Figure Eight"" cover the same territory as the Dorough song of the same name-- that ""skate"" rhyme is, admittedly, pretty obvious-- but Dorough also managed to throw in its multiplication table all the way up to 96, and TMBG don't get much beyond the shape of the numeral. If there's a song from 123s that the Giants' older fans are likely to embrace, it's probably ""Seven Days of the Week"", a deeply daffy singalong in praise of indolence with the parping, galumphing beat they adopted back in the ""Particle Man"" days. Beyond that, the keepers are ""Eight Hundred and Thirteen Mile Car Trip"", a headlong one-minute rocker, and ""Nine Bowls of Soup"", a deadpan conversation with an icthyosaur that's a conceptual cousin to Ivor Cutler's ""Bicarbonate of Chicken"" and also gives John Linnell the excuse to sing ""icthyosaur"" repeatedly. The rest, though, is a wearying slurry of not-quite-clever-enough lyrics and brightly colored plastic genre pastiches-- Giants by, well, numbers. ""Zeroes"" starts with a cute bossa nova riff but never goes anywhere with it; ""High Five!"" does the same thing with Eurodisco, and throws in a bridge copped from Devo; ""Ooh La! Ooh La!"" is dreadful fake jumprope funk. The title of ""Triops Has Three Eyes"" is almost its entire conceit (near the end, it's replaced by ""tripods have three legs""). ""Ten Mississippi"" might be passable as a bit of ""Sesame Street"" filler-- three funny voices singing ""one Mississippi, two Mississippi, three Mississippi..."" in turn-- but it's hard to bear more than once. To their credit, the Johns perpetually sound enthusiastic. (""I don't even know Spanish! But I'm gonna sing it in Spanish!"" declares John Flansburgh in the middle of ""I Can Add"", before doing just that.) But every bouncy tunelet whose catchiness isn't paired with depth or wit lowers the most crucial number on the album, its Parental Ear-Stabbing Index. There's also a DVD version of the album, featuring cute animated (and felt-puppet) videos for all of the songs. The two-year-old critic in the house sat raptly in front of it, although he lost interest during the two TMBG-written Mickey Mouse jingles tacked on at the end (regrettably, they're also on the CD). Then he asked to hear Multiplication Rock again.","The geek-pop band follows its alphabet-centric children's album with a sequel that, naturally, focuses on numbers.

My basic opinion of the Cake Sale is that it's consistently uninteresting-- it's so stridently middle-of-the-road that there's little to get excited about.

The band is really more of a loose collective, helmed by Brian Crosby of Ireland's Bell X1, and it includes Damien Rice, Nina Persson, Josh Ritter, Rice's former vocalist Lisa Hannigan, the Divine Comedy's Neil Hannon, Snow Patrol's Gary Lightbody, Crowded House bassist Nick Seymour, and members of Frames, the Thrills, and Turn, among others. Fans of some of those bands may have things to latch onto here-- think a softer, plusher Snow Patrol with less memorable songwriting. It was also recorded all over the place, with basic tracks done at one point and vocals tracked in different countries at different times, which could account for some of the lack of energy and sense of interplay that weighs it down. It sounds cohesive because the very refined (one might say sterile) production keeps it that way, but it can't mask the missing group dynamic. For my donation, the best track is the last one, the Neil Hannon-led ""Aliens"". I can't really get behind the chorus lyric, ""I've been speaking with aliens/ They've agreed to abduct everyone but you,"" but the way it's delivered, piped-in choir and all, makes it far and away the record's most dramatic and lasting moment. It's the unselfconscious way it embraces its cheesiness that makes it endearing-- this is something Hannon's always been good at, and he plays it perfectly here. Much of the rest of the record is an adult contemporary smear, with xylophone and violin accents at the edges that don't add much more than texture and a raft of too-subdued vocal performances that allow your mind to wander too easily. Josh Ritter does a better job than most of grabbing the melody at his disposal and giving it some rhythm and personality on ""Vapour Trail"", bringing a sort of country twang to the song that sets it apart-- it's also more sparsely arranged than the rest of the record, which gives the song some room to breathe and just be what it is. Meanwhile, I had to listen to ""Black Winged Bird"", sung by Persson, several times just to remember the refrain, and the Hannigan-led opener ""Last Leaf"" never gets off the ground, dragged down by a leaden melody. ""Good Intentions Rust"" sounds like a rejected Grandaddy B-side. As much as I'd like to, I just can't recommend this-- good intentions aside, it's pleasant but totally non-descript and devoid of energy. In short, it's boring-- if you want to support Fair Trade initiatives, you'd probably just be better off donating straight to Oxfam or buying one of the interesting Think Global comps that have come out in the last few years-- if you're in the UK, you could even hit up one of their used book stores.","Loose collective helmed by Brian Crosby of Ireland's Bell X1 and including Damien Rice, Nina Persson, Josh Ritter, and the Divine Comedy's Neil Hannon records an album to benefit Oxfam's Make Trade Fair program.

The Lost One,Barton Carroll,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b43d13d197565213aa98/1:1/w_160/d20eb53d.jpg,2008-02-06 06:00:04,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11084-the-lost-one/,Skybucket,"Barton Carroll writes like a troubled man. The songs on The Lost One, his second album on Birmingham-based Skybucket Records, are all about downtrodden men nursing dark thoughts like whiskey, ruminating over marriages, sex, children, jobs, friends, life. ""Hair's fallin' out and my back's got a pain,"" he sings on opener ""Pretty Girl's Going to Ruin My Life (Again)"" (that parenthetical aside stings like a punchline). ""I've been drinking my scotch in my truck in the rain/ I think it's a fine way to spend the day."" Like Freedy Johnston, to whom he bears more than a passing resemblance, Carroll writes in character, filling his songs with the kind of everyday people you might pass on the street, with no bigger story than the gradual onset of disappointment and regret. On the elegantly epistolary ""Those Days Are Gone, and My Heart Is Breaking"", which could be a male response to Michelle Shocked's ""Anchorage"", a man writes a letter to an old friend, catching up on the ""years between us,"" including a failed marriage, an estranged son, and a series of go-nowhere jobs. ""I guess the damage is done,"" he sings, ""and there's no way I can fake it."" Like most of The Lost One, the song works because Carroll never inflates his characters' circumstances beyond the mundane and possibly hopeless. ""There's a mean streak in me,"" Carroll sings on ""Those Days Are Gone"", but as dark as these songs may be, Carroll himself sounds like a nice, good-humored guy, maybe someone you'd like to have a beer with. He has a high-pitched voice that recalls Jimmie Dale Gilmore, and he enunciates perfectly with no trace of an accent (the North Carolina native moved to the Pacific Northwest years ago). As such, he doesn't inhabit these characters, but he certainly identifies with their predicaments and their working-class roots. On ""Brooklyn Girl, You're Going to Be My Bride"", the album's funniest track, he comes off like a good-hearted blue-collar suitor trailing a pretty Vampire Weekend fan: ""I know she's drowning in boys and a lot of hipster noise,"" he sings. When Carroll missteps, the cracks become particularly noticeable, as on ""Laurie, Don't Go"", which relies on lyrical clichés to force a clunky rhyme scheme: ""Don't take my boy,"" Carroll sings. ""What is this ploy? He's my only joy."" Carroll claims ""Small Thing"", which appeared on his 2006 album Love & War, is about the Soviet occupation of Berlin, but history makes the song sound completely out of proportion with the rest of this studiously life-size album. Ultimately, the mean streak in his lyrics and the softness of his voice aren't as irreconcilable as you might think. For the most part, he sells these characters as people he's had beers with-- an impression bolstered by his modest, but by no means mild-mannered folk-rock sound. Carroll, who has played with Crooked Fingers, Azure Ray, Dolorean, and Micah P. Hinson, bases all the songs on acoustic guitar, but rustles up harmonica, organ, and trumpet when the mood hits and makes the most of his full band on the organ-heavy ""Ramona"" and the stomping ""Dark Place"". An ominous slide guitar offsets his falsetto vocals on ""Burning Red and Blue"", and a rickety trap set on the traditional folk song ""Her Bright Smile Haunts Me Still"" sounds like the creaking boards of an empty house, as if the owner of that bright smile were literally a ghost. Putting his songwriting at the forefront, the straightforwardness of the arrangements make his character sketches sound believably plainspoken instead of clever. The Lost One is a fine way to spend 42 minutes, and probably best served with scotch.","This Freedy Johnston-alike's second Skybucket album is all about downtrodden men nursing dark thoughts like whiskey, ruminating over marriages, sex, children, jobs, friends, life.

First Night Forever,Burnt Friedman,by: Philip Sherburne,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b4425e6ef959693225af/1:1/w_160/e2f96bbf.jpg,2008-02-06 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11089-first-night-forever/,Nonplace,"Burnt Friedman has a rep for flirting with the funk. Early on, his approach and his output-- intricately polyrhythmic, meticulously crafted ""hypermodern jazz"" tracks full of shimmering vibraphones and cheeky Latin percussion-- often found him branded as an ironist. But his productions, whether solo, with Atom Heart (as the duo Flanger), or alongside a growing cast of collaborators-- like Root 70 saxophonist Hayden Chisholm, improvising/experimental guitarist Joseph Suchy, vocalist Theo Altenberg and, perhaps most importantly, Can drummer Jaki Liebezeit-- have never been reducible to kitsch. Listen to Burnt Friedman & The Nu Dub Players' 2003 album Can't Cool: for all the obvious digital traces (oddly truncated hi-hats, drum patterns physically impossible for a single percussionist to play) there are no winks or nudges. To say that ""Fuck Back"", the record's lead cut, is a postmodern take on Afrobeat is hardly to deny its ferocity: no matter how many steps removed from the source, urgency remains coded in the music's DNA. Indeed, it's in the collaborative work that Friedman has really dug into the groove, particularly on his two records with Liebezeit: both volumes of Secret Rhythms offer an approach to polyrhythm rarely heard in electronic music. By slowing everything down, the two amplify the wiggle room, leaving more space for drum hits to bounce beyond the strictures of quantization, allowing for rhythms that restore liquidity to the idea of pulse. After 2006's sublime Heaps Dub-- in which the jazz quartet Root 70 performed acoustic versions of Friedman and Flanger classics that Friedman, in turn, remixed into 10 tracks of exactly five minutes apiece, a sort of dub of a dub of a dub-- Friedman, aided by an expanded cast of characters, returns with a far more conventional album. Formally, it's probably the most conventional of his career: these aren't krautrock jams or ambient dub meditations or electro-cumbia dustups, they're proper songs fronted by a rotating crew of vocalists. Longtime Friedman collaborator Theo Altenberg lends a Tom Waits-like croak to three songs; Hamburg soul singer Daniel Dodd-Ellis, Berlin's Barbara Panther, Funkstörung collaborator Enik and UK broken-beat veteran Steve Spacek all guest on two apiece. All of them dusky, throaty singers, they give First Night an unmistakably late-night vibe. The closest reference point might be to the acoustic-guitars-and-edits approach to soul practiced by His Name Is Alive on 2001's Someday My Blues Will Cover the Earth, which might not be as surprising as it first seems: Friedman actually covered ""Someday"" on Can't Cool, and he also remixed H.N.I.A.'s ""Nothing Special"" for a set of Someday-derived singles. Timbre and voicing play a central role, because these songs hardly live and die by their chord changes: propelled by scraggly guitar figures and dub's ruminative bass lines, they remain classically minimalist in spirit, splitting the difference between Steve Reich and Roy Ayers' RAMP (or Philip Glass and Tony Allen). What makes even the most static of the songs so engaging is the way they seem to shimmer in place, as diverse lines of winds, strings, guitar, accordion, synthesizers and effects weave porous webs. It's somewhat shocking that only two tracks are credited to a session drummer, Root 70's Jochen Rückert-- the majority of the record's rhythms are presumably Friedman's own programmed creations. If true, it's one hell of a percussive coup; for all their understatement, these are among the most sophisticated beats Friedman's ever come up with. Like virtually everything on the album, they never call attention to their own virtuosity. The whole record, in fact, has been put together so subtly that at first it may fail to stick. For a long time, I thought of First Night Forever as a nice, relaxing mood piece, and bided my time for a new Friedman/Liebezeit collaboration. But somehow I kept coming back to the album; where most records on my review-assignments list find their way back to the shelves, this one crept into regular rotation in those rare slots I listen to music for pleasure: morning coffee, cooking dinner, the bedtime wind-down. Such domestically functionalist music often gets the short end of the critical stick; 30 years after Music for Airports, we still have an innate distrust of music as wallpaper. First Night Forever's trick is that it functions on two levels at once: behind that calming, rippling, jazzy veneer there are strange forces at work, peeling back the wallpaper to reveal a passageway to points unknown.","This could be the most conventional album of the playful German experimentalist's career: these aren't krautrock jams or ambient dub meditations or electro-cumbia dustups, they're proper songs fronted by a rotating crew of vocalists.

The Bedlam in Goliath,The Mars Volta,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b462ea9e61561daa6c35/1:1/w_160/d49abff2.jpg,2008-02-06 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11115-the-bedlam-in-goliath/,Interscope,"The Mars Volta discography carries an astronomical risk/reward potential, and so it is no surprise that the band's latest record, The Bedlam in Goliath, is yet another all-or-nothing entity. Pitchfork has tended to be in the ""nothing"" camp: Their first three studio LPs bombed but did so in entertaining and spectacular fashion, clusterfucks of Cedric Bixler-Zavala's incomprehensible lyrical jabberwocky and Rock Band feats of strength. But every now and again, even we'd catch a glimpse of their undeniable upside. Few bands in popular modern rock share their technical prowess, super-adventurous listening habits, or K2 conquering ambition. If they could somehow manage to channel all of it into something other than a tribute to their own excess, even we believe it would probably be totally fucking awesome. Despite its surface similarities to 2006's Amputechture (decoder ring title, Street Fighter II cover art), it's possible that Mars Volta were finally willing to meet non-converts halfway. First single ""Wax Simulacra"" clocked in shy of three minutes without a single edit, and while they're still using a compact disc's capacity as a starting point, this time it's broken down into a relatively manageable 12 tracks-- most of which begin with a vocal riff of instantaneous impact. Of course, this is still Mars Volta's idea of accessibility; having left the earth's orbit sometime in 2003, they can only go further into the cosmos. If you can commit any of these attention deficit disorders to memory, you're probably in Mars Volta. If you can explain the concept (something about a cursed Israeli ouija board) without having read any of the pre-release materials, you've recently done drugs with Lil' Wayne. The general ""pro"" argument for Mars Volta is that they're a true anachronism of the iPod age, but The Bedlam in Goliath goes great lengths towards actually rewarding short attention spans. Between Bixler's preposterous lyrics (no need to quote them, you've already gotten the idea by now), the fractious time signature switcheroos of ""Metatron"", and Ikey Owens' keyboard globules on ""Agadez"", you'll find plenty of moments worthy of high-fiving, but they lack any sort of meaningful big picture context or contrast. (Oh, excpet for that Israeli ouija board stuff.) It used to be you could rely on them to toss in some aimlessly ambient smoke breaks for variety's sake, but save for the turgid wolf cry of ""Torniquet Man"", Bedlam plays like the true soundtrack to Katamari Damacy, indiscriminate consumption set to a relentless beat. Opener ""Aberinkula"" is typical of the dynamic assault, erupting like it was in a stepped-on firehose for the past year and proceeding to just get fucking louder and louder until the free-time saxophones confirm the scent of apeshit. I swear there's a legit funk-metal groove in ""Ilyena"", but Thomas Pridgen doesn't agree. Ignoring the basic drumming priority of keeping time, Pridgen solos for about six minutes-- or as much you can ""solo"" while the rest of the band does their own thing. ""Goliath"" has an appropriately mountainous riff and lumbering rhythm, but guitarists John Frusciante and Omar Rodriguez-Lopez deface it with rote pentatonic wah-wah soloing in the same manner people use the word ""like"" in conversation. And in the most preposterous production trick you'll (likely not) hear in 2008, 90 seconds into ""Cavalettes"", the mix gets fried and then sounds like it's being sucked down a toilet before spitting back up. And then they squander any WTF impact by repeating it every two minutes. Bixler comes off the best here; not since Chris Cornell on Superunknown has there been a lead man who can do a more convincing job of peddling obvious hokum through sheer force of primal will. He isn't as interested as testing the boundaries of his falsetto this time around, and it results in some of the most melodically satisfying tune fragments the Volta have ever come up with. But he can't leave well enough alone, and whatever restraint he shows on the mic fails to make it to the production board, as Bixler filters his vocals through the last 30 years of voice-manipulating technology. Obviously, recent developments have caused for reassessment of the effect, but once again, it's a matter of context. Whereas the robo-pimping of T-Pain or Snoop Dogg at least is juxtaposed with the smoothness of their backing tracks, here it's just another wanky sound effect from a band that can't get enough of them-- Bixler's most recurring guise has him sounding like an insectoid clone of himself. And I suppose none of this should've been a surprise, but whether it's At the Drive-In's enduring goodwill, a fear of preemptively dismissing the band that could be seen as the premiere 21st century schizoid men, or the brazen conviction with which Mars Volta sell their shtick, they always manage to make you at least second-guess your own instincts. But consider what the similarly constructed virtuoso collective of Battles have accomplished with their chops this past year-- embracing technology, humor, groove, and concision into something that actually sounds like the future as opposed to the refrying of decades-old noodles in dry ice and snake oil. I'm sure defenders of the band will champion Mars Volta as a keeper of the prog-rock flame, but The Bedlam in Goliath renders the term meaningless-- the result couldn't be more averse to actual progress in rock music.","After three all-or-nothing albums full of clusterfucks of Cedric Bixler-Zavala's incomprehensible lyrical jabberwocky and Rock Band feats of strength, Mars Volta return with a records that's broken down into a relatively manageable 12 tracks.

Kitsuné BoomBox / Kitsuné Maison 5,Various Artists,by: Tim Finney,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b47a13d197565213aafb/1:1/w_160/254a0f3b.jpg,2008-02-06 06:00:00,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11654-kitsune-boomboxkitsune-maison-5/,Kitsuné,"Given the preponderance of compilations beginning with the word ""Kitsuné"" over the past few years, it's remarkable that the French dance (not dance) music label is only now getting round to its first DJ mix-- ironically, now that the label is synonymous with ""blog house"", and all the stuttery one-off exclusive remixes of third-grade indie rock anthems that term implies. On the other hand, for a genre so obsessed with the big, messy breakdown, it only makes sense to edit out the perfunctory intros and outros and get straight to the good stuff. Accordingly, Jerry Bouthier's BoomBox mix holds few real surprises, except perhaps in how well it demonstrates the values of the DJ mix format itself: This is by far the most fun full-length the label have released in years, and the one that makes the best argument for the continued viability of rock-flavored electro-house as a going concern. Whereas recent Kitsuné compilations have suffered for their randomness, surgically attaching these tracks to one another can't help but positively emphasize the sheer breadth of the label's aesthetic range, especially when this diversity is united by an efficient bottom-end, never for long losing sight of the throb of the bass drum and the ceaseless whispers of the hi-hats. While BoomBox captures the label's sound at its most club-friendly, I suspect that Kitsuné's ideal medium is neither the club sound system nor (critics' assertions to the contrary notwithstanding) computer speakers, but the car radio. And the notion of this music as one big rowdy radio show places most of its qualities in their most favorable light: The amateurish lo-fi sonics, the regard for proper songs, the taste for sudden, lurching stylistic sideways swerves, the privileging of headbanging impact over hiptugging grooves, and the at times overwhelming swelter of sounds and effects. I like to think this (mostly) new generation of artists have inherited or stolen this vibe from the rougher end of first wave French house, which in its helter skelter radio show form offered the ultimate in disorienting party music. This precarious lineage is more evident on BoomBox than I expected: Most prominently, Revolte's ""Weak Generation"" is the most thrilling piece of stupid-fresh French house since I don't know what. Meanwhile the mix's shift from Simian Mobile Disco's wonky ""Love"" to Headman's hard-riffing ""Catch Me (Dub)"" is precisely the sort of unexpected and thrilling transition that works better in your car than in the club. For much of the mix, the sharp synthesizer arpeggios peg proceedings closer to electro-house orthodoxy, but with a general vibe of unpretentious cheesiness that reminds me positively of prime big beat and, more specifically, Moonbootica's DJ Sounds Good mix from a few years back-- perhaps the last time this kind of music sounded genuinely oblivious to the dictates of fashion. Guns'n'Bombs' remix of Chromeo's ""Fancy Footwork"" fits perfectly here, its sudden drum rolls and chiming cowbells and trance-inflected synths and hype-inducing sirens all deployed with a cheerful obviousness straight from ""Block Rockin' Beats"". The ""tracky"" vibe of BoomBox feels liberating in this sense: There's a mindless efficiency at work here that would probably be considered too straightforward and predictable for one of the label's Maison compilations. But if the Maison series could learn a lot from Bouthier's efforts, it's in no hurry to. With the exception of a few bizarre and occasionally brilliant curios (see the excellent old skool rave remix of M.I.A.'s ""XR2"") Volume 5 remains as committed to exploring wonky pop and rock as any of its predecessors. This isn't a barrier to greatness: The burbling, slightly skanking electro-pop of Fischerspooner's ""The Best Revenge"" demonstrates how well this approach can work, seamlessly triangulating ""Being Boiled"", ""Ghost Town"", and ""(Don't Fear) The Reaper"". It's also by far the most expansive and expensive-sounding production on the disc. ""They belong to a different age"", you might say, but nevertheless the fact that such acts rarely abandon high production values and proper songwriting once they've tasted them should offer Kitsuné's endless ranks of messy young upstarts something to chew on. It's compositional effort rather than any specific sound that defines the compilation's several successes. Pin Me Down's by turns sneering and sighing ""Cryptic"" aims for a midpoint between the Bush Tetras and early Bananarama, and comes out sounding like an ace angry Girls Aloud single. Which should tell us two things: Firstly, that combining rock guitar and beat-heavy electronic production in pop songs isn't so novel that these artists deserve a medal just for turning up, and, conversely, that this very combination can aspire to pop majesty when the participants try hard enough. Too often, however, Kitsuné's artists seem scared of the kind of gleaming architectural dance-pop perfection practiced by, say, Jacques lu Cont, preferring an aesthetic of deliberately wounded and mistake-riddled obscurantism. There's a difference, though, between deploying mistakes strategically and doing so indiscriminately. Van She's gloriously anthemic cut-up of Feist's ""1, 2, 3, 4"" (a centerpiece on BoomBox) works-- as Rex the Dog's take on the Knife's ""Heartbeats"" did before it-- by stretching a compositionally tight and sincerely performed pop song to a confused and fractured breaking point. But too many whiny indie-dance acts make this outcome their starting point, tenuously stringing together a succession of B-grade song cast-offs and hoping that throwing in a stuttery synth-riff breakdown and buzzy kickdrum will retrospectively redeem their efforts. It doesn't, and gruesome songs like Does It Offend You, Yeah?'s ""Let's Make Out"" and Kid's ""I'll Never Know"" only succeed in making this particular stylistic niche sound like the worst of all possible worlds.","French dance (not dance) music label Kitsuné offers its first DJ mix, along with the latest of its Maison compilations. Among the artists featured are Daft Punk, M.I.A., Feist, Chromeo, Digitalism, Alan Braxe, Rex the Dog, and Fischerspooner.

There's been some reciprocity, too-- it's just as nice to hear of Arcade Fire fans saving iPod space for Justin Timberlake as it is to hear Timberlake namedrop David Byrne or appear propping up the Flaming Lips. Out of this collision has come the likes of Junior Boys and Fujiya & Miyagi, indie-rooted but pop-friendly acts whose lack of smug, distancing irony (plus ample hooks, of course) is partly what makes them so enjoyable. There's a potentially so-so album swimming around somewhere in Hey Willpower's P.D.A. It's not impossible to go top 40 without a chance of radio play. Green Gartside isn't the most soulful of dudes, but his pure, honest affection for pop comes through loud and clear with Scritti Politti. At the same time, Junior Senior get such an obvious kick from paying tribute to their funky, freestyling forefathers that their obnoxious pastiches can be downright contagious. But the stylistic affectations and vocal tics of Hey Willpower (Imperial Teen's Will Schwartz and Tussle's Tomo Yasuda) start out irritating and go downhill from there. The thin, squelchy synths of ""Double Fantasy II"" could be an OK stand-alone goof, but no, it's followed by ""Uh-Uh-Uh"", which seems every bit the joke as Babyface's ""Backdoor Lover"" (credited to Du Jour) from the Josie and the Pussycats OST. Minus the joke. ""Retail Heaven"" features a cheeseball spoken word intro and gratuitously breathy MJ/JT it-hurts-to-sing vocals. The unjustified ""Silent Ring"" is even worse, and if ""Hundredaire"" aims for the conjoining of Prince and George Michael, no doubt those two auteurs would politely decline the honor. Hell, that's only the halfway mark. Giving up early, you'd miss the masochistically stupid street-smart turn ""Magic Window"" and the not hot ""Too Hot"". At least a doo-wop foundation gives the final track, a reworking of Architecture in Helsinki's ""Heart It Races"", enough of a novelty vibe that it could probably run inconspicuously over the ending credits of some tween flick, a dubious achievement (assuming you're aiming for more than just a big paycheck): like too much of what's come before it, it's music meant to play when you're filing out and no one's listening. If there's anything Hey Willpower needs, it's maybe a little more winking self-awareness. No doubt it's there, but the pop simulacrum is played so straight you can only take it at face value. Timberlake is one of the acts obviously in the sights of Schwartz and Yasuda, but generously speaking, Hey Willpower's debut P.D.A. would at best play like a parody of JT (or JC, or hell, George Michael), were it the least bit amusing. If it's meant to be a joke, it's not funny. If it's not meant to be funny, it's a joke. Neither here nor there, the funklesss would-be dancefloor fodder of P.D.A. frankly comes off D.O.A.","Imperial Teen's Will Schwartz and Tussle's Tomo Yasuda go pop 'til you drop.

I'll Be Lightning,Liam Finn,by: Joshua Klein,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b43cea9e61561daa6bfe/1:1/w_160/59ad33a4.jpg,2008-02-05 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11083-ill-be-lightning/,Yep Roc,"While similar tastes and inclinations often transfer from one generation to the next, the passage of actual talent from parent to progeny is far from a guaranteed thing. While a famous last name can at least help you fake it, Julian Lennon sure ain't living off royalties from ""Valotte"". Crowded House's Neil Finn is another musician living off the legacy of Lennon, albeit more indirectly. But as the frontman for Crowded House and former pop anchor of Split Enz, Finn is one of only a scant handful of songwriters completely indebted to Lennon and the Beatles as a whole who has successfully placed his own stamp on such a tried and true melodic passport. You can hear the Beatles in nearly everything he does, but first and foremost you hear Neil Finn. That son Liam follows closely in dad's footsteps will surprise no one. The question is, exactly when did Liam realize his talents fell so closely in line with Finn senior? As recently as 2004, Liam and Neil were even covering the Beatles' ""Two of Us"" together on the I Am Sam soundtrack (albeit only as an import-only bonus track). Preceding that (public) collaboration, the younger Finn had been getting his ya-yas out in the forgettable alt-rock act Betchadupa, an aggressive riposte to dad's classy pop. He's since toured as part of Finn's band and, more recently, Crowded House proper, where as an opening act Liam also got to show off his one-man-band skills, as well as songs from his excellent debut I'll Be Lightning. It's uncanny how much Liam Finn recalls Neil Finn not just vocally, but also lyrically and melodically. Yet while Liam may sound a lot like Neil (and the Beatles, for that matter) on songs like ""Energy Spent"" or ""Music Moves My Feet"", he's not exactly aping him. As the tune goes, it's only natural, and besides, Liam's got a few things going for him that even dad doesn't. Production-wise, I'll Be Lightning (recorded in Neil's studio with Liam behind the boards) shows the younger Finn has learned a few tricks from dad's friend Tchad Blake. Odd instrumental touches crop up throughout the album, and there's a welcome layer of grit and murk to even the prettiest songs here, lovely stunners like ""Fire in Your Belly"", ""Lullaby"", and ""Remember When"". When layers of Liam's overdubbed background vocals swell up in the immaculately arranged ""Wise Men"", the result is like discovering a lost chorus setting on a creaky old Chamberlin. Liam's no snotty punk, but there is also a welcome looseness to songs such as ""Better To Be"", ""Lead Balloon"", ""This Place is Killing Me"", and even the lopsided ballad ""Wide Awake On the Voyage Home"" or the wistful ""Second Chance"". These songs are neat but not tidy, coming across a bit bashed out despite the conspicuously perfect placement of all their parts. And that's where Liam's relationship (both literally and figuratively) to his father really comes to the fore. Liam is just 24. At that age, Neil had yet to leave Split Enz and strike out on his own, yet here's his son who already seems to have absorbed a career's worth of musical lessons in half the time. Dad must be pretty proud, but at the same time, one can only imagine he's keeping a close competitive eye on the kid.","Liam Finn, eldest son of Crowded House/Split Enz pop master Neil Finn, strikes out on his own with an excellent solo album so eerily in line with dad's oeuvre it could launch a hundred nature/nurture debates.

The remaining three tracks of Valley of Fire suggest that the music and lyrics within Greenwood's soul are rarely as dynamic and far-reaching as ""Sing"" but surprisingly do aim for the same brand of uncalculating emotion. JOMF unfortunately no longer have an ear for true sonic disruption, and of course it would have been awkward if yelling woman had gone on like ""You are a modestly revered post-rock veteran of some influence! You used to record turntables and construct amateur choirs and pawn off important pieces of American musical history!"" which is probably what Greenwood actually needs to hear. To his credit, he injects Valley with enough subtle idiosyncrasies-- Public Enemy is hilariously credited for its contribution to 20-minute jam/chant closer ""We Are/Channel Zero""-- that it outpaces its predecessor, 2005's almost sycophantically reverent Flags of the Sacred Harp. Valley smartly sandwiches two slowly plucked sub-folk tracks between ""Sing"" and ""We Are/Channel Zero"". On ""The Tree"" Greenwood re-imagines the Beach Boys' static, muddy dirge ""The Day in the Life of a Tree"" as... a static, muddy dirge with acoustic guitars. It's a great fit lyrically, though, as Greenwood contentedly mutters, ""Trees like me/ Weren't meant to live/ If all this world can give/ Is pollution and slow death,"" repeating the last phrase as someone slowly approaches harmony behind him. The Greenwood-penned title track is a pleasant intermission hummed in baritone, sweeter and less substantial than should be allowed of a band with ""motherfucker"" in its handle. Sequenced after these two relaxants, the ""We Are/Channel Zero""'s improvised jam jumps off the plastic, roughed up by spurious snare patterns and smeared by Greenwood and Inca Ore's Eva Salens' sailing voices. Tough to definitively say that it's not a proper meditation on a 1988 hip-hop song about media and vacuity, so give JOMF the benefit of the doubt on one of the best long form piece they've submitted in years. Back to ""Sing"", then, which comes by its religious overtones honestly, the product of Greenwood's collaboration with Salens and Charlottesville preacher/author/poet Uriah J. Fields. Fields operates the Beautiful Living website, which invites you to learn about ""Three important books by Uriah J. Fields"" alternately about race relations and God. This sort of unconscious emotionalism persists throughout Valley, in ""Sing""'s earnest declarations, in Greenwood's po-faced deliveries, in a Beach Boys song about an outwardly depressed tree. Even the free-form jam is given purpose via its title and writing credits, no matter the vagaries of execution. Valley nabs the musical pieces of JOMF's dedicated free-form past and recent fondness for public domain hymns, but its refreshingly embarrassed affectations are its own.","Though the Portland band no longer has an ear for true sonic disruption, their latest has enough subtle idiosyncrasies to outpace its predecessor, 2005's almost sycophantically reverent Flags of the Sacred Harp.

Live at Couleur Cafe,Konono N°1,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b452c0084474cd0c226e/1:1/w_160/5778bda0.jpg,2008-02-05 06:00:02,Global,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11101-live-at-couleur-cafe/,Crammed Discs,"Back in 1978, Konono No. 1-- going under the unabridged name Orchestre Likembé Tout Puissant Konono No. 1 (All-Powerful Likembé Orchestra Konono No. 1)-- was one of four bands recorded for a compilation called Zaire: Musiques Urbaines a Kinshasa. Their contribution, a stunning and absolutely epic 26-minute track called ""Mungua-muanga"" vividly illustrated the sound we associate them with today. Except nobody had a chance to notice-- the compilation didn't come out until 1985 when Ocora finally released it, by which time the music industry had already constructed its world music ghetto. It's intriguing to think about what might have happened had that record been released in 1978-- the conditions were so ripe for something like this to catch on. Punk was giving way to post-punk, many of whose exponents incorporated global sounds into their own; punk also lionized the DIY ethos, and there's no band more DIY than Konono No. 1. How many punk bands have made their own microphones out of carved wood and car parts? As it happened, it took all the way until a few years ago for Vincent Kenis of Belgium's venerable Crammed imprint to find the band still hard at work on the streets of Kinshasa, plying their roughly amplified folkloric trance music for the citizens of Congo's bustling capital. Kenis offered them a chance to record again, and this time, everything happened as it should have the first time: When Western audiences heard the band's whirlwind sound of chanting, scrap-metal percussion, and slightly distorted electric likembé (thumb piano), they were widely embraced as the unique and powerful band they are. Their music, which was never intended to be avant-garde, fit perfectly at the heart of the experimental rock and electronic music scenes without even trying to. Live at Couleur Café captures them at the Belgian festival of the same name and also gets them at their fiery, swirling best. If you're not already familiar with them from their previous two albums, this is as good a place as any to get acquainted. All but three of the songs are new, and the interplay between the musicians is ultra-tight. The three likembés swarm around each other, deftly working off of bouncing rhythms played on a combination on snare drums and scrap metal. Leader Mawangu Mingiedi, now in his 70s, controls the stage, leading call-and-response chants with the dancers. The show's most climactic moment comes when the storming version of ""Mama Liza"" thunders to a close, its outro serving as the intro to ""Mama Na Bana"", an 11-minute flurry of relentless polyrhythms and virtuoso likembé playing. About the only thing better than listening to this record would be to stand a few feet from the band's gigantic megaphone while they played a show. It's fun enough just to look at the Mad Max assemblage of gear they bring to the stage, but to hear the sound they can make with it really knocks you on your ass. They may have found their global audience a couple decades later than they should have, but Konono No. 1 have nonetheless earned it on the merits of their music.","The Congolese band is here captured performing its folkloric trance music at a Belgian festival, and the results find the group-- a recent toast of experimental rock and electronic music scenes-- at its fiery, swirling best.

Made in the Dark,Hot Chip,by: Mark Pytlik,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b47213d197565213aaec/1:1/w_160/3f56a0e8.jpg,2008-02-05 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11129-made-in-the-dark/,AstralwerksDFA,"The received wisdom on London's Hot Chip is that they're equal opportunity funsters who'll pinch from any old genre in the name of a grin. But after the potent combination of ""Over and Over"", ""Boy From School"", and all the attendant remixes increased their festival bill font size by about 20 points, there was good reason to believe that the London quintet's next record might find them rectifying their cartoonish pop into something sleeker and more streamlined. They might have, for instance, decided to expand on the soul and R&B influences that occasionally pepper their music; or to smoothen the undanceable rumples of their creaky, short-circuited pop with a few well-placed blasts of minimal techno; or maybe, to topple their previous output with an even more dazzling pastiche of color, candy, and complexity. Any one of those paths would have served Hot Chip well. But of all of their many virtues, focus isn't one, and instead they took them all. A string of self-conscious interruptions, perfect pop moments, show-offy sonics, and inscrutable non-sequiturs, the lovable but flawed Made in the Dark has moments that come off as almost gluttonous-- and that's even by Hot Chip's standards. And while the majority of the material here ranges somewhere between inoffensive and fantastic, momentarily obnoxious misfires (the funhouse mirror horrorshow ""Bendable Poseable"", the impish ""Don't Dance"", and the weirdly overrated ""Shake a Fist"") underscore why ""all of the above"" is not a tenable long-term formula for the band: That level of consumption can't stay charming forever. Which is to say that Hot Chip have a big record in them and this isn't it. Once you do away with that disappointment, though, there's plenty to appreciate. There might not be anything as definitive or as moment-making as ""Over and Over"" or ""Boy From School"" here, but once you've acclimatized to Made in the Dark's sonic trills and party poppers, some affecting songs emerge. On the pop side, none are as lovable as the tender-hearted electro of ""Ready for the Floor"", in which the band once again finds comfortable middle ground between Alexis Taylor's balladesque vocal and vibrant, electro-pop dressing. Elsewhere, the feelgood ""Touch Too Much"" cruises by on a big chorus and some characteristically clattering percussions, while the infectious ""One Pure Thought"" opens against a backdrop of gnarled guitar chords and keening synths. Unhampered by the otherwise relentless hairpinning subjected to all their uptempo material, Hot Chip's ballads do better service to the band's songwriting skills. With a serpentine vocal melody, a healthy backbeat, and a gently unfolding array of whistles, pinging guitar notes, and reverbed backing vocals, album centrepiece ""We're Looking for a Lot of Love"" is an easy highlight. Meanwhile, with its slow changes and melting analog pads, the two-minute dirge ""Whistle for Will"" provides Low-style gravitas, closer ""In the Privacy of Our Love"" flirts with gospel, and the album's title track is an exercise in lazy, Sunday morning soul. On paper, those individual components read like they might make for a patchy, turbulent record, and to be honest, that's pretty much how Made in the Dark plays. For all the talk about them being genre agnostics, they're just as beholden to everyday rules of pace and structure as anyone else. So: Good record but not a great one. By the time you see them this summer, they'll have it sorted out.","London's Hot Chip follow their breakthrough 2006 LP, The Warning, with the lovable but flawed Made in the Dark.

Like Bees EP,Dirty on Purpose,by: Liz Colville,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b43913d197565213aa92/1:1/w_160/4cf5d226.jpg,2008-02-04 06:00:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11081-like-bees-ep/,North Street,"Brooklyn's Dirty on Purpose returns with a second EP, just as big a reminder of the band's past and potential as Hallelujah Sirens, an LP also on the cusp of something great. ""Back to Sleep"", a standout track here, has been around since about 2005, and it returns, re-produced, a little more precise, deliberate, and a touch slower than the first version. It was always one of the loveliest, most promising of the band's tracks, a long hangover nap that coddles the listener with a languorous guitar pattern dipped in the sweet, echoed flavor that has come to define the band's sound. But like many of their songs, it has its dingy, frazzled moments-- in this case, a chorus, then a whole comedown that launches back into that brief and deep vacation from prettiness, plunging into a murk that's anything but lethargic. No doubt, these are the emotions that the line ""Go back to sleep"" tried to warn you about. An energetic continuation of this atmosphere is ""Send Me an Angel"", a cover of Real Life's 1983 hit. Naturally, it's extraordinarily reminiscent of the hazy disco rock that was reemerging when Dirty on Purpose was emerging-- I Love You But I've Chosen Darkness, Kasabian, et al. It's a fun choice-- sexy, grumpy, and nearly fist-pumping; it's also the closest the EP gets to being instantly accessible. ""Airshow Disaster"", the final mark of this five-song set, is vocal-free and breathtaking, delivering all the grit, desire, and passion of the band's debut. Energetic and static-laden, yet firm and controlled, it has more in common with the band's clear influences (My Bloody Valentine, Sonic Youth), who completely dispersed on ""Angel"" but are otherwise close at hand. The title track, placed second, is the clearest example of this EP's ultra-comfortable production, heavy with bass, creating a firm, enveloping, Tempur-Pedic experience for the ears. It's akin to the muscular and lustful atmosphere that Electrelane created on No Shouts, No Calls, except instead of adding more cheek-close warmth (an organ), Dirty on Purpose just add atmosphere: the gorgeous, diaphanous guitar that winks a couple of times here, and gets in full swing on ""Back to Sleep"", which follows. The group excels at a drowsy, spare songs, heavy with perceptions and moods. Perhaps to wish for something more from this band-- a little more pop, bombast, or rage-- is to wish for its demise. Clearly, the group has more to tell us from the edge, surveying the muck below.","Brooklyn band's latest release features a Real Life cover and a number of exciting dreamscapes that manage to match the most pleasing moments of its last LP.

The Roundhouse Tapes,Opeth,by: Joshua Klein,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b43ac0084474cd0c2249/1:1/w_160/64c94dcf.jpg,2008-02-04 06:00:04,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11082-the-roundhouse-tapes/,Peaceville,"There are worse yokes to bear than ""thinking man's metal."" If anything, Sweden's Opeth is surely proud their efforts at combining the intensity of death metal and the pastoral qualities of prog have gone over so well. But ""thinking man's metal"" or not, it's probably not wise to think too hard about what Opeth is up to. Like 99% of music, close scrutiny reveals the seams, and like too much metal, a close look reveals just how silly the stuff ultimately is. No, better to just give in to the thrill of the playing: the tightrope precision, the velocity, the sheer intensity. Opeth fans have gotten plenty of opportunities to get used to those qualities on the band's Ghost Reveries. The album, originally released in 2005, was re-released with extra stuff the very next year. And in late 2007, fans got yet another taste of the album with a live disc, The Roundhouse Tapes, recorded back in 2006 on the Ghost Reveries tour. Yet to the band's credit, The Roundhouse Tapes includes just a single track from Reveries-- the nearly 11-minute ""Ghost of Perdition""-- with the rest of the setlist serving as career overview, welcome to new drummer Martin Axenrot, and sendoff for longtime guitarist Peter Lindgren, who left amicably at the end of the epic tour. It's also a showcase for Opeth leader Mikael Akerfeldt, an odd contradiction in the world of metal who is not only adept at vacillating between gentle crooning and harsh growling but seems to equally appreciate the two singing styles. He also comes across one of the most genteel, soft-spoken frontmen you'll ever encounter, at a metal show or not. He's no Cronos or Paul Stanley, but Akerfeldt's polite introductions are almost worth the price of the double-disc. ""Do you hear that?"" he asks before launching into a full-barreled ""Ghost of Perdition"". ""That is the sound of a tuned-down guitar...Please enjoy this one."" ""Just listen to the title and enjoy the song,"" he suggests, like a good sommelier, before leading into the classical guitar stylings of ""Under the Weeping Moon"", from 1995's Orchid (the concert begins with the strains of Popol Vuh's ""Through Pain To Heaven"", and a lengthy instrumental passage in the middle of the song nods to those mood-minded German prog pioneers). ""We were quite pretentious in those days,"" Akerfeldt admits, talking about the band's second record, Morningrise-- the reverie interrupted by him politely telling someone in the crowd to ""Shut. The. Fuck. Up.""-- ""I brought a lute to the recording session, thinking I was going to be a minstrel. It was never used, but this song was recorded nevertheless with the thought of the guitars being lutes."" Usually when a band as technically proficient as Opeth hits the road the idea is to replicate the recorded arrangements as closely as possible, if only to show you've done your homework. But the group's first proper live album pushes boundaries further than that, with few of the minor concessions (if they can be called that) that have made their albums more palatable to the casual listener. No track here runs shorter than eight minutes. Five top 10 minutes. ""Blackwater Park"" stretches close to the 20-minute mark. No doubt there are some for whom Opeth's prog side gets in the way, but you've got to love any band so unafraid to embrace its inner nerd. Like pals Porcupine Tree, Opeth seems uninterested in courting any single audience, and knowing that they've done things their way gives the group ample ""fuck you, too"" fodder. A live release could have been a ""fuck you,"" but in this case-- especially arriving via the band's old, pre-Roadrunner label-- it feels more like a modest thank you the stave off the wait for the next studio record.","The kings of Swedish prog-metal coronate themselves with a live album.

Beyond Even (1992-2006),Fripp & Eno,by: Joshua Klein,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b42fc0084474cd0c2239/1:1/w_160/2e48be45.jpg,2008-02-04 06:00:03,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11074-beyond-even-1992-2006/,DGM LiveDGM Live,"In 1975, Brian Eno released his epochal Discreet Music replete with an ambient music manifesto as well as a diagram making explicit the system he used-- a sort of rudimentary analog phase machine-- to create the record. If Discreet Music demonstrated the aural wallpaper aspect of the system of overlapping loops (legend has it hospitals regularly piped in the LP during childbirth), Eno's earlier experiments with guitarist Robert Fripp were somewhat less, well, discreet. In fact, in a lot of ways the equally epochal Fripp/Eno albums No Pussyfooting (1973) and Evening Star (1975) brought ambient music firmly to the foreground. Eno would run Fripp's guitar through his rudimentary synth system, looping the guitarist's increasingly abstract tones into a shimmering cloud of sound, over which Fripp would unspool one of his famed liquid solos in real time. Of course, some 35 years later Fripp and Eno's advances have been boiled down the banality of various effects pedals, bringing their technique into play with just the tap of a foot. Yet no other guitarist sounds like Robert Fripp, and an effects pedal is no substitute for Brian Eno. What Fripp and Eno always emphasized through their collaboration was the human element-- how instincts and input can subtly alter and warp the parameters of a closed system. Needless to say, Fripp and Eno-- both collectively and respectively-- are revered by their flock. Beyond Even (1992-2006) was originally released as The Cotswold Gnomes, a download-only collection released via Fripp's Discipline Global Music Live site winkingly subtitled Unreleased Works of Startling Genius, and posted fan reviews run mostly along the lines of ""this is the most amazing thing I've ever heard."" Save one: ""I must say, you've got some audacity to charge money for this rubbish,"" writes a lone dissenter, and he's got a point, though not exclusively based on the quality of the music. The only difference between Beyond Even and The Cotswold Gnomes (other than the title) is that initial runs of the former come with a second disc, reprising the album in its entirety but as a single flowing piece rather than a collection of tracks. Repackaging a previous release with a new name but no new content is indeed a dubious proposition. For that matter, little effort has been made to document the origins of these outtakes, at least none beyond the new title's stated time span. Some tracks sound akin to Fripp and Eno's digital-era 2004 collaboration The Equatorial Stars (itself pretty but also pretty inessential). Others sound more in line with Eno's sometimes abrasive and fitfully funky ""juju space-jazz"" explorations (indeed, the span of the set stretches back to Eno's Nerve Net). But like Eno's own half-assed and aptly named Curiosities collections (compiled from old work tapes by an assistant), nothing here sounds like more than a minimum of effort went into its composition. That it still sounds occasionally compelling is testament to Fripp and Eno's good taste and talents, and it's easy to appreciate the team's dedication to ambient menace over mere passive mood. In fact, some of the best tracks here, like ""Sneering Loop"", ""The Idea of Decline"", and ""Cross Crisis in Lust Storm"", hint at an aggressiveness neither artist has seemed terribly interested in pursuing as of late. But at the same time the two, even with nothing left to prove, remain capable of so much more than just the occasional chance studio meeting or one-off collaboration might evince. That the Beyond Even sop is just second helpings of leftovers to begin with only rubs it in even more.","Robert Fripp and Brian Eno offer a disc of leftovers and sketches that was originally released as The Cotswold Gnomes, a download-only collection released via Fripp's Discipline Global Music Live site winkingly subtitled Unreleased Works of Startling Genius.

We Brave Bee Stings and All,Thao with the Get Down Stay Down,by: Stephen M.

In fact, it's become something of a cliché even to note that movies and sitcoms typically pit schlumpy, carefree, childlike guys against willful, no-fun, grown-up women. Depending on whom you ask, Knocked Up managed to find some middle ground between the two poles, but it seems to be an exception. Until Hollywood gives us a good portrayal of the adolescent-leaning female, we have Portland-based Thao Nguyen and her backing band the Get Down Stay Down, who specialize in galloping indie pop with sugar-coated hooks, a frosting of horns, and a considerable dark streak. The 23-year-old singer-songwriter, whose expressive voice suggests an earthbound Beth Orton, sings about such youthful concerns as ice cream cones and cannonballs off diving boards, but with unexpected maturity, dignity, and charm. These qualities make her second full-length, We Brave Bee Stings and All, sound so immediately distinguished and spirited. Even that title makes a child's fear sound as epic as 300. At this retrospective time of year, this point of view feels especially fresh and significant. Nguyen isn't merely the old archetype of the female as innocent naïf, but rather one who takes that youthful vision and marries it to a sly and incisive wisdom. Nguyen's is a remembered childhood both personal and universal. Describing herself as ""a small kid at the big kid table,"" Nguyen has a sharp eye for small, telling details, which could form the bedrock of a young adult novel but here inform songs simultaneously life-size and larger-than-life. ""We brave bee stings and all,"" she sings on ""Swimming Pools"", as her banjo pushes the music to a running pace. ""We don't dive, we cannonball."" She beatboxes at the beginning of ""Geography"", whose opening line-- ""Geography is gonna make a mess of me""-- could be about a long-distance relationship or third period. ""Feet Asleep"", which appeared on last year's Kill Rock Stars comp The Sound the Hare Heard, begins unassumingly, with Nguyen singing against a folksy acoustic guitar theme, then the band launches into a brassy Dixieland-style chorus-- one of the album's fullest and most joyful moments-- as Nguyen turns bad circulation into a metaphor for romantic complacency. Those horns pop up again more quietly on ""Violet"", drawing frowns across the song as she bids farewell to a friend. Throughout Bee Stings, the Get Down Stay Down keep the music light and fast-paced, revealing a broad range of styles but never boasting about it, and Tucker Martine's suitably slack production emphasizes the sharpness of her voice and the playfulness of her melodies. On ""Fear and Convenience"", she asks, ""Did he hurt you in a new way?"" Nguyen sounds generally curious, even as the darker implications of her question loom over the song. Bee Stings is, in a sense, a coming-of-age album, as serious themes underscore her jaunty melodies and adult concerns encroach on her summery youthfulness. Nguyen strikes a fine balance between the two, but here's hoping she doesn't grow up too much.","Kill Rock Stars releases the first pleasant surprise of the year courtesy of 23-year-old singer-songwriter Thao Nguyen and her backing band the Get Down Stay Down, who specialize in galloping indie pop with sugar-coated hooks, a frosting of horns, and a considerable dark streak.

Greatest Hits,Morrissey,by: Tom Ewing,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a0c413d1975652138480/1:1/w_160/4612837e.jpg,2008-02-04 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11127-greatest-hits/,Decca,"It's easy to mock acts for rushing out premature best-of collections after a couple of albums. As Morrissey's solo career hits the two-decade mark you'd think he's earned one-- and so he has, but this is by no means the first draft. In fact, his discographical scorecard now reads: Studio Albums 8, Compilations 6. Though some of these collections have been the result of his label changes, Morrissey's always seemed an obsessive curator of his own work: His career is studded with mixtapes made for himself, whether as monumental as The World Won't Listen or as odd as World of Morrissey. The outrageously imbalanced Greatest Hits falls somewhat on the odd side. Eleven of its 15 tracks come from the last three years, the career renaissance kicked off by his You Are the Quarry album. Of the five full-length records he put out in the 1990s, one song survives-- the imperiously creepy ""The More You Ignore Me, The Closer I Get"". It's not for casual fans who want a retrospective; it's not for new listeners who'd like to play catch-up. Who is it for? If nothing else it's an opportunity to check the state of his art. His basic approach no longer varies much: A comfortable modern rock sound, muscular but curiously unshowy, light on instrumental hooks. The number of great Morrissey songs that are great for a reason other than Morrissey is small, and you get the feeling that's how he likes it. The music he uses these days is designed to give him maximum space-- lots of room for his still-stirring vibrato, his meandering melody lines, and the recurring themes which define his career and his public personality. One of those themes is how potential gets used, squandered, or curdled. How do sweet boys turn into criminals, or pampered kids turn into killers? He's been writing about this since 1989's ""Last of the Famous International Playboys""-- something of a touchstone song, it appears on more of his endless compilations than any other. ""These are the ways in which I was raised,"" the song claims. ""I never wanted to kill, I am not naturally evil."" His explorations of the idea have become starker and more powerful as he's shifted from first-person to third-- the best of his recent songs, ""First of the Gang to Die"" and ""The Youngest Was the Most Loved"", have a sinewy economy, getting quickly to the murderous crux of their protagonists' lives. The idea that all this is rooted in a fascination with rough trade has become a cliché of Mozology. Listening to these singles, it seems to be more about kindred spirits: If Morrissey can work out how these destinies became so twisted, he might be able to track his own strange development. This is the other main Morrissey theme-- the singer as a loveless freak of emotional nature, doomed to endless rejection, if not death-- and unlike his lost-boys songs, his explorations of the topic haven't advanced much in 20 years. ""You Have Killed Me"", ""Let Me Kiss You"", ""I Have Forgiven Jesus""-- none of them are bad songs, but they're all more facets of what's become a dulled jewel. ""That's How People Grow Up"", one of two new tracks, proceeds along these familiar lines: ""Let me live before I die-- not me, not I."" To be fair to Morrissey, nobody mines this self-deprecating seam as thoroughly or effectively, but when the song's sudden ending flips into the magnificent ""Everyday Is Like Sunday"", I'm reminded of how much wider and fresher his perspective used to seem. The other new track, ""All You Need Is Me"", is much better-- a venomous glam-rock rumble with his haters, accusing them of being more than critically obsessed with him. ""There's a naked man standing laughing in your dreams/ You know who it is, but you don't like what it means"": Who else would sing that? The paradox of Morrissey is that he's generally the most confident loner around, and Greatest Hits bears this out, presenting his current work as his best ever. Some would agree-- and surely it's not his worst. Anyone who still cared when he slunk into seeming obscurity in 1997 singing songs about window cleaners and raging at long-gone bandmates must be thrilled by his renewed vigor and purpose. But even if you agree with the sentiment, it's a statement best made in interview rather than by this oddly assorted compilation.","11 of the 15 songs on Morrissey's outrageously imbalanced new Greatest Hits-- including two new tracks-- date from the last three years, celebrating the career renaissance kicked off by his You Are the Quarry album.

Slick Dogs and Ponies,Louis XIV,by: Adam Moerder,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b4589d034d5c69bf4e56/1:1/w_160/e02105c3.jpg,2008-02-01 06:00:05,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11106-slick-dogs-and-ponies/,Atlantic,"Psst, I don't know if anyone knows this yet-- it may not even be on Wikipedia-- but Louis XIV love to fuck, and apparently they often do so. Just listen to their music. Or read their lyrics. Or look at their album art, watch their videos, play their records in reverse, expose their press releases to an ultraviolet light source, or-- well, you get the point. Oh yeah, they also occasionally play rock'n'roll, which I hear is this style of music with an accentuated backbeat or whatever, but that's only to receive inspiration to fuck more. So now that that cat's out of the bag, we turn to follow-up Slick Dogs and Ponies, where apparently the sex sometimes goes bad, or at least grew boring enough to force our lotharios into trying new tricks. While I hesitate to call Slick Dogs's night vision sex tape cover ""deep"" or ""poetic,"" following their debut's asscrack-on-bathroom-tile smut, it looks like a freakin' Van Gogh. Fittingly, Louis XIV try pretty hard to pass as artists here, as opposed to distilling classic rock libido into something you can simply inject in your ass. Frontman Jason Hill expresses some pathos here, a tad more profound than the pain of getting an erection while wearing tight jeans, but not far off. For an even crazier conceit, the band decides to actually work for their self-appointed sex symbol status, whether via Electric Six-style stabs at lunkheaded disco or big, dumb, ultra-schmaltzy morning-after ballads. Single ""Air Traffic Control"" gets some sleazy mileage out of the aviation metaphor (""Well you were high when I met you""), but overall the track sounds like an unironic plea for help, especially when Brian Karscig's chirpy vocals kick in: ""Air traffic control/ I've been gone, I've been up away from home/ Now my gear is down, I'm circling round, and I am coming in."" The hushed psychotic thriller ""Stalker"", a surprisingly subtle, clever song, almost encroaches on Gorillaz territory, with Hill doing a pretty spot-on Damon Albarn impression. Of course, the band hasn't been properly neutered, and they're up to their old shenanigans on piss-drunk stompers like ""Misguided Sheep"" or ""Guilt By Association"", the latter announcing, basically, that they're scandalous enough to implicate anyone of breaking the law who's in close proximity to them. Sadly, while Wal-Mart and Christian censor groups will bristle at these obscene sounds and images, there's really nothing uniquely shocking about Louis XIV, just disgusting or, even worse, plain dull. If they really wanted to ruffle feathers, they'd be championing ideas like ""global warming is a myth,"" not graphic but predictable sex romps or even the half-assed Iraq War rants on ""Free Won't Be What It Used to Be"" (""March out, soldier, the bugle calls""). The sentimental dimension of Slick Dogs only further depicts Louis XIV as an embodiment of everything American audiences just never ""got"" about glam rock. They're dazzled by the hedonistic aspects of the genre-- the (heterosexual) sex, the drugs, the big guitars-- but completely overlook the more complicated nuances. There are no sci-fi or fantasy themes explored here, and certainly no gender-bending. Instead, the slightly more dynamic Louis XIV only give you testosterone-fueled rock at its least appealing extremes: heedless lust or, arguably even more repulsive, cheesy balladry.","Oh good, these guys.

Snowbeast,Luke Temple,by: Jessica Suarez,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b45fea9e61561daa6c31/1:1/w_160/9dbf5107.jpg,2008-02-01 06:00:04,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11113-snowbeast/,Mill Pond,"Luke Temple's biography mentions his job at a candy shop in California, a time when he slept in the forest for a year, and painting murals on apartment walls for rich New Yorkers. An artist turned musician, Luke Temple discovered that a four-track layers audio the same way an artist slathers paint, though the former offered him endless chances for reconfiguration. His story, and even this easy equation (""music is painting""), builds the gentle naiveté that runs throughout Temple's second LP. ""Saturday People"" leads off Snowbeast and it's easily Temple's strongest song and showcases everything that's good about the singer/songwriter/multi-instrumentalist. Temple's banjo carries the brisk waltz through dynamic shifts that move him from a easy lope to a section of harmonies straight out of an early CSNY record. In fact the lines ""People/ Looking-glass people/ Saturday people/ Will live one final time,"" when sung in that harmony (and perhaps coupled with the over-the-top ""A mescaline freak-out in an off-Broadway show in the morning"") invoke a variety of romanticized and alienated imagery that's snatched straight from a time when squares were there to be looked at and made strange. In that sense, ""Saturday People"" is a period piece, or maybe a period triptych. Aside from the outro, the song's three parts are miniature gems grouped by time signature and quasi-pyschedelic inflections; they refract and reflect each others' brilliance. ""Saturday People"" is solid through and through, and it's really no surprise that Temple can't keep up the momentum through the rest of the record, the song really is twice as good as anything that follows. Most of the rest of the songs seem to hinge on one melodic idea that comes and goes. Consequently, I spent most of my time waiting for those moments to crop up. In ""Medicine"" an almost-dramatic minor-key melody lends the opening line (""Better take your medicine"") a paternalistic threat that simply peters out as the song progresses, only to revive itself when the hook returns. But it dies away again as it turns out, ""your medicine was love."" Oh. It's always disappointing when a songwriter tries to decode his music for the listener, but when it turns out that the equation is ""x=love,"" there's no hope for redemption. Yet it's no surprise that the ""answer"" to the question ""What is 'medicine'?"" is ""love."" It's a totally conventional answer, and ""Medicine"" is a conventional song by design. Another acoustic slow-poke, ""People Do"", follows similar constraints. Though it showcases Temple's strange, lovely voice and those harmonies again, there is little to listen for besides the sheer pleasure of hearing his vocal turn miraculously from bloodless to soulful with just the slightest application of vibrato. The acoustic tracks are few and far between, though. For the most part Temple favors a melange of tinkling synths and keyboards. When he uses them for their rhythmic qualities, as on ""Family Vacation"", he's on firm footing, threading his melodies through a Timbaland-ish tom beat until the frenetic releases that serve as choruses. ""Family Vacation"" is a fun track, and it's woefully brief. More often, though, Temple uses his keyboards as texturing devices, and he tends to favor sounds somewhere in the range of his voice. This means that a song like ""Serious"", though it's a fine song, suffers from treble overload. The lone bass cannot support the layers and layers of high-end piled upon it. Temple is a relatively young songwriter and this, his second full-length, shows promise. Its unevenness seems like a result of his struggle with ideas, rather than a lack of ideas worth filling out. The fuller the palette he works with, the better the result. Such a frail, pretty voice needs something to support it, and in songs like ""Saturday People"" where it finds itself in a niche carved out especially for it, rather than adrift on a see of aimless synths, Temple's various gifts amplify each other.","An artist turned musician, Temple seemingly discovered that a four-track layers audio the same way an artist slathers paint, though the former offered him endless chances for reconfiguration.

Always Lift Him Up: A Tribute to Blind Alfred Reed,Various Artists,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b45ec0084474cd0c227b/1:1/w_160/ed597e68.jpg,2008-02-01 06:00:03,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11111-always-lift-him-up-a-tribute-to-blind-alfred-reed/,Proper AmericanWest Virginia Music Hal of Fame,"Blind Alfred Reed would have hated the world of today. Hell, he thought the 1920s were loose and immoral, which they probably were if you were born in the 1880s. Armed with a fiddle and a sandpaper voice, the Hinton, West Virginia, native called out the gamblers, fast women, high-falutin' men, hooch runners, high-tech locomotives, and price gougers, and would have been scandalized by a women even running for president and disappointed by the idea of Wal-Mart. For proof, see Always Lift Him Up: A Tribute to Blind Alfred Reed, which is presented by the West Virginia Music Hall of Fame and features exclusively West Virginia singers, pickers, and fiddlers like Little Jimmy Dickens, Tim and Mollie O'Brien, and Kathy Mattea. Instead of sidestepping Reed's staunch moralism, these artists present his lyrics with a straight face (except for performance artist Ann Magnuson) and let his contradictions and convictions explain themselves. Starting the disc with the one-two punch of Dickens' ""Woman's Been After Man Ever Since"" and Mollie O'Brien's ""Beware"" is something close to brilliance, as both songs warn listeners away from the temptations of women (""We can plainly understand woman was made after man/ And she's been after man ever since"") and men (""He smokes, he chews, he wears nice shoes/ Beware, oh take care""), respectively. Both Dickens and O'Brien wring out all the Christian paranoia while keeping the proceedings spry. Reed sang his songs like a preacher preaches sermons: His compositions are full of moral instructions and warnings, yet to ensure his audience listened and remembered, he wrote in a popular vein, drawing from lowly Appalachian ditties to sell a higher power. Only Ann Magnuson takes a tongue-in-cheek approach on ""Why Do You Bob Your Hair, Girls"", in which she introduces herself as Sister Alice Tully Hall (apparently not the Alice Tully Hall, which is a building) and has her children sing the jaunty chorus. It's a bit offputting in the middle of a generally sincere tribute, but it helps that the song is both well performed and genuinely funny. Always Lift Him Up does not focus on Reed's finger-wagging exclusively, but includes many of his hymns to God as well as to the American poor. The Nichols Family, an a cappella gospel choir from the rural community of Swiss, perform a swooning version of ""Walking in the Way with Jesus"", accentuating the song's forthrightness with graceful harmonies. If his heavenly songs sound hopeful, his earthly songs sound grimly pessimistic and extremely suspicious of emerging technologies and staid politics. Charlie McCoy's stoically strummed ""Fate of Chris Lively and Wife"", about a couple run over by a train, drips with dread and grief: ""They were killed/ Engine crushed horse and wagon/ Oh how sad to know they never can come back."" Even if they live, the people in Reed's songs meet a fate worse than a speeding locomotive: poverty. As vehemently as he warned against bathtub gin and flappers, Reed-- who allegedly died of starvation in the 1950s-- stood for the little guy, singing songs like ""How Can a Poor Man Stand Such Times and Live"", here covered mournfully by Tim O'Brien, that tell of such everyday troubles and tribulations as the rising price of dry goods, the dangers of working in the mines, and the general ignorance of politicians. The tribute title derives from the song ""Always Lift Him Up and Never Knock Him Down"", here sung by Dwight Diller and John Morris, who preach to hate the sin and love the sinner. ""When he's sick and tired of life and takes to drinking/ Do not pass him by, do not greet him with a frown,"" Diller sings. ""Do not fail to lend a hand and try to help him/ Always lift him up and never knock him down."" Even if you don't agree with all of Reed's steadfast opinions, Always Lift Him Up presents him with all his contradictions in tact, and lifts up his generous populism and unforgettable tunes as his true legacy.","This tribute to sandpaper-voiced Blind Alfred Reed features exclusively West Virginia singers, pickers, and fiddlers as they present the moralist's staunch lyrics-- the dude hated gamblers, fast women, high-falutin' men, hooch runners, high-tech locomotives, and price gougers-- with a straight face, letting his contradictions and convictions explain themselves.

No Ground Under,Ghislain Poirier,by: Evan McGarvey,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b45c9d034d5c69bf4e5e/1:1/w_160/c4372937.jpg,2008-02-01 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11109-no-ground-under/,Ninja Tune,"Thankfully, five-dollar music crit adjectives don't fit Montreal DJ and producer Ghislain Poirier's style. So we can torch words like ""gossamer,"" ""delicate,"" ""woozy,"" or ""gauzy."" As Peter Macia said in Pitchfork about Poirier's 2005 Breakupown, Poir's at his aesthetic best when ""frivolities have been ground to dust."" No Ground Under, Poirier's sixth album-- and first on Ninja Tune-- has that same commitment to uncluttered, cutting bass while still packing a full range of machine gun beats. It may also be the best entryway into his work. No Ground is taut, alkaline, and-- in its sharpest places-- it lives up to its title. Poirier still hacks and welds and splices, but instead of throwing around cheap, sometimes irritating digital-dust effects, he redlines instruments to their lab-doctored optimum. On ""Hit & Red"", bass kicks flap and flatten and pump like Andre the Giant's iron lung. When the guitar strum on ""No More Blood"" finishes its one-second loop, it cuts like a razor, rendering what should have been a matte into something lacerating. Listeners familiar with Poirier's brassy remixes (of everyone from Lil' Wayne to Lady Sovereign), will recognize his favorite techniques, a sort of wish list for contemporary rap instrumentals: Hard, traditional 4/4 drums with a grab-bag of loops that aren't so much mutated as made superhuman. On ""Exils"", the song's strings loop back as they tune, swarming together and whipped into something that resembling the ESG classic ""UFO"". Poirier's MC selection skews appropriately to the underground (Chicago's Zulu, Français Ambitieux) just as the album's aesthetic goes the way of fellow po-mo deconstructivists (Weezy, Foster Wallace). He touches on all your tropes and lets his MCs grab for intellectual flash points like so many brass rings: He titles a song ""Diaspora"". He has an MC shout: ""Lebanon! Up in England! Over Syria! In Nigeria!"" Yet there's something somethingly deeply vivifing about Poirier's blend of spartan yet far-flung sonic DNA and his naked political ambitions. Maybe it's how fantastic he sounds alongside contemporary American hip-hop and how successful he might be hawking album beats to everyone from MF Doom to Redman. Maybe it's because even with his sloppy, earnest political ambitions, indeed nothing about his execution feels frivilous. Maybe it's simply the drum and bell on ""One Hand Can't Clap"" and a dozen other sounds besides.","The Montreal DJ and producer's sixth album-- and first on Ninja Tune-- has that same commitment to uncluttered, cutting bass while still packing the full range of machine gun beats that his audience craves.
