Live at the Royal Albert Hall,Arctic Monkeys,by: Noah Yoo,Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5fc914630f9ba652bdb991af/1:1/w_160/Live%20at%20the%20Royal%20Albert%20Hall_Arctic%20Monkeys.jpg,2020-12-10 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/arctic-monkeys-live-at-the-royal-albert-hall/,Domino,"Arctic Monkeys’ career can be divided into the periods before and after AM, the smirking after-hours stomp that launched the group to previously unseen international success in 2013. Their boisterous riffs and louche anthems won over a new generation of fans—but in the aftermath, Alex Turner found himself struggling with writer’s block, only overcoming that hurdle by sequestering himself away with a piano. While the loungey follow-up Tranquility Base Hotel & Casino was divisive among fans upon its release, Arctic Monkeys’ new live album shows there’s an enduring throughline between the albums, anchored by Turner’s potent songwriting. Live at the Royal Albert Hall captures a War Child charity gig that took place near the beginning of the Tranquility Base era, just a month after its release in 2018. (Proceeds from the album will also benefit War Child.) Though it leans most heavily on the aforementioned last two albums, the setlist scans like a collection of greatest hits. Across 90 minutes and 20 tracks, the Monkeys review their nearly two-decade career, refreshing old favorites and working out new material. Arctic Monkeys were a compelling enough touring act prior to AM, but it was during their 2013-2014 run behind that album that the band truly came into their full powers. Hits from that period, like “Do I Wanna Know?” and “R U Mine?,” feel totally effortless here, irrespective of the occasional transposed key or vocal stumble to remind us that Turner is no longer the bright-eyed 19-year-old who recorded Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not. He has a more worldly weariness to his vocal timbre now, which makes the older material feel satisfyingly lived-in. Even though Tranquility Base was largely a studio project, built upon demos written by Turner while holed up in his Los Angeles home, the songs benefit from the limitations of the live environment. The acoustic guitar and synth overdubs in the slightly claustrophobic studio version of “Four Out of Five” blend into the background in favor of a far looser sequence, led by snarls of fuzz from guitarist Jamie Cook. And for Arctic Monkeys diehards who found their last studio album to be too severe a departure, Live at the Royal Albert Hall might help bring its strengths into focus. Turner’s breathy delivery on the studio version of “One Point Perspective” might scan as a put-on because his vocals are so isolated from the rest of the band, as he slurs into the slap-back. But his voice is commanding on the live version, sounding like a jaded Elton John. At the time of the performance, Tranquility Base was recent enough that the concert actually marked the debut performance of album opener “Star Treatment,” Turner’s paean to the Strokes and Blade Runner. You wouldn’t know it was a new song from the cheers let loose after the opening chord. The fans might go crazy for Matt Helders’ blistering “Brianstorm” intro and the loping bassline of “Why’d You Only Call Me When You’re High?”, but they’re also right there singing along to newer tracks like “She Looks Like Fun.” Crowd noise can make or break a live album, and with 5,000-some-odd fans acting as de facto backing vocalists, Royal Albert Hall is a great example of the former. (As with any audio-only live document, the cheers can allude to untold stories; in the second verse of “Arabella,” the audience explodes after Turner neatly catches an avid fan’s castoff pair of tights.) Compare Live at the Royal Albert Hall to Arctic Monkeys’ last official live release, 2008’s At the Apollo, and it’s apparent how significantly the band have grown in that time. After starting the decade in pursuit of a “more poppy” sound, they ended it by taking a chance on Turner’s conceptual songs about taco stands on the moon. From here, they’re free to pursue any direction they wish.","Captured in 2018, this live set leans heavily on the band's last two albums but still plays like a greatest hits.

Origin of the Alimonies,Liturgy,by: Grayson Haver Currin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5fc9169f0ba465fcf55a9732/1:1/w_160/Origin%20of%20the%20Alimonies_Liturgy.jpg,2020-12-10 06:00:00,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/liturgy-origin-of-the-alimonies/,YLYLCYN,"Liturgy have never opted for the path of least resistance or readiest acceptance. When they burst from Brooklyn nearly a dozen years ago, they were an exhilarating addition to an already promising U.S. black metal scene, aggressive enough to command and strange enough to captivate. They could have made a fine career in that image; instead, their firebrand inclinations prevailed. Founder Hunter Hunt-Hendrix raised hackles with a high-minded black metal manifesto. Aesthethica burrowed deeper into theology with post-rock muscle, while The Ark Work confounded through mystical chants that recalled Bone Thugs-n-Harmony and Philip Glass. Last year’s H.A.Q.Q., made with a new lineup after an extended hiatus, went wild with symphonic flourishes and brittle electronic edits. Such provocation could sometimes feel glib and hollow, as though the wholly serious Hunt-Hendrix were tickling black metal just to see if it would flinch. Liturgy became troll bait, a punchline. But Origin of the Alimonies, Liturgy’s second album in as many years, is as believable as it is provocative, as obvious as it is obscure. A rapturous synthesis of Hunt-Hendrix’s philosophical pontifications and musical enthusiasms, Origin finds a balance that has long proven elusive for Liturgy. Like Charles Mingus’ The Black Saint and the Sinner Lady almost 60 years earlier, Origin of the Alimonies wrestles with ideas that can seem too grand for music to contain; throughout these seven tracks, it sounds as if Hunt-Hendrix were fighting to hold the reins enough to make the point once and for all. On Liturgy’s most compelling album in a decade, and arguably ever, she does. Liturgy’s black metal core, built around Hunt-Hendrix’s time-stretching “burst beats,” remains intact, thanks to the return of the athletic quartet that debuted on H.A.Q.Q. But a gaggle of marquee New York improvisers—trumpeter Nate Wooley, flautist Eve Essex, bassist James Ilgenfritz, and so on—broaden Liturgy’s textures and techniques. Scraped violin strings chatter with tremolo guitars. Pounded piano figures complicate splenetic rhythms. At one point, during “The Fall of SIHEYMEN,” Liturgy sound like a symphony being led by John Zorn toward the Naked City. This mix may seem off-putting at first. Despite the transgressive audacity of each previous Liturgy release, none has been so full of distinct ideas or different idioms. The record begins and ends with alternately tense or tender chamber-ensemble miniatures, delicate passages that suggest infinite ellipses. Between them, there are spans of yearning black metal, gyrating electroacoustic improvisation, and strutting electronic meters, all splintered, shaved, and spliced into uncanny mosaics. Origin—meticulously arranged, concisely edited for maximum impact—is by far the shortest Liturgy album. This brevity can feel disorienting, like watching a television that shuffles among several channels every few seconds. “Apparition of the Eternal Church,” the record’s 14-minute climax, is an interpretation of Olivier Messiaen’s Apparition de l'eglise eternelle for a black metal band and pulsing piano. Messiaen’s piece is a beautiful but foreboding masterwork about the shock of encountering God for roaring organ. Liturgy’s version is equal parts ecstasy and terror. Hunt-Hendrix and Bernard Gann divide the melody between their guitars and a string section, a combination that foretells a glorious crescendo and a horrible calamity. Neither arrives. Instead, Liturgy collapse, as if falling prostrate before God in an overdue moment of acceptance and release. Musical twists and spasms aside, Origin is the most approachable Liturgy album yet. It is, as billed, an origin story, an allegorical narrative for the mechanisms of our universe. The specifics get arcane, so start with this simplification: Light and dark want to coexist. In its pure form, light overpowers and destroys the dark. When light transforms into “ideas” and dark into “matter,” they not only interact but reproduce, birthing music, drama, and philosophy. In broader terms, it’s a high-stakes drama about wanting something you can’t have until you figure out how to evolve. In May, Hunt-Hendrix announced she was transgender, a fact she had spent a lifetime fighting. “I am a woman. I’ve always been one,” Hunt-Hendrix wrote. “Through a long-developing process, I’ve finally broken free from some kind of compromise.” In the months since, Hunt-Hendrix has started hormone therapy and “watch[-ed] my body evolve into what it is supposed to be.” She has less shame and more empathy, she said in a recent statement, and years of suicidal thoughts have abated. A year ago, while explaining the indulgent H.A.Q.Q., Hunt-Hendrix seemed burdened by the need to make people understand; this year, explaining Origin as an opera, she was occasionally playful, intent for you to know her philosophical framework isn’t intended for everyone. Origin of the Alimonies radiates this sense of liberation, the feeling that Hunt-Hendrix has found the other side. These songs affirm the rebirth pondered in Anohni’s “Another World,” a hymn that acknowledges personal frailty and collective folly while longing for some place more nurturing. Hunt-Hendrix doesn’t stop with a wish: She imagines the process that might produce another world and the promise it holds should we make it together. So long as we’re willing to understand what we can become, Hunt-Hendrix suggests, that other world might not be so far out of reach.","The black metal firebrands achieve a rapturous synthesis of Hunter Hunt-Hendrix’s philosophical pontifications and musical obsessions.

Hardwood Classic,Baby Smoove,by: Alphonse Pierre,Staff Writer ,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5fcfb6331ef00c5e1192ca02/1:1/w_160/Hardwood%20Classic_Baby%20Smoove.jpg,2020-12-10 06:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/baby-smoove-hardwood-classic/,Dha,"A typical Baby Smoove song sounds like he’s having an early-morning, hungover phone conversation and struggling to recap what he did the day before. The Detroit rapper’s vignettes are a never-ending cycle of trips to shopping malls, pit stops at corner stores, sitting in traffic, and weed smoke-filled strolls through his neighborhood. The most exciting moments are when he shows up at Saks Fifth Avenue or gets a package from the Dior store in the mail—which, if you take Smoove’s word for it, occurs at least once a day. But Baby Smoove’s music comes to life in mixtape form, where each track feels like a chapter in the story he’s trying to tell in the backseat of a long car ride. Though this lethargic style has a low margin of error, all it takes is a lackluster beat or an anecdote short on details and it quickly becomes painfully boring. It’s no coincidence Smoove’s best mixtapes—the piano-driven Purple Heart and the G-Funk synth obsessed Baby—are the two with the most consistently vivid production. He flourishes on vibe and feel, and without that, loses his appeal. Baby Smoove’s second full-length mixtape of the year, Hardwood Classic is like a compilation of leftovers. On his strongest projects, the raps and production are complementary, but here they don’t have the same color or flash. Normally when Smoove uses the flow, which sounds like he’s in the recording booth wrapped in a blanket and neck pillow, the energy is made up for by uptempo and lush instrumentals. On “DX,” both Smoove and the brooding beat are lifeless—not even his lines about freely scuffing his Diors or referencing Shawn Michaels and Triple H’s old friendly catchphrase is enough to make it memorable. In Detroit, rappers like Babyface Ray, G.T., Veeze, and the World Tour Mafia crew have made the lane of laidback lifestyle rap highly competitive. Why put up with formulaic production and mailed-in punchlines when there are so many other options? Smoove’s few funny lines about money counters and internet beef on “Swing the Wood” don’t make the routine Michigan-style beat any less forgettable. Similarly, the “Sleepwalking Pt. 3” instrumental is so sluggish it’s hard to even laugh at his guest Veeze calling someone a “jabroni” (“Jabroni” is in between “bozo” and “doofus” on the list of underused rap insults). But even though Hardwood Classic is nowhere near the top of Baby Smoove’s fast-growing catalog, there’s still enough meticulously told tales to justify the experience. On “Load Management,” he raps about going to the store in a $6,000 outfit for absolutely no reason over a pulsing Enrgy beat; on “Prada Me,” he’s annoyed a girl, who is spending the night, keeps getting phone calls from her boyfriend; on “Floyd May,” he counts the number of Amiri Jeans he owns over breezy Mexikodro production. Baby Smoove can make his days of nothing sound as thrilling as Rio Da Yung OG’s borderline action movie set pieces, but only when it’s all clicking.","The Detroit rapper's second mixtape of the year is like a compilation of leftovers, with enough meticulously told tales to justify the experience.

Nightmare Vacation,Rico Nasty,by: Jessica Kariisa,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5fcabfb91aaf388b5b2bba93/1:1/w_160/nightmare%20vacation_rico%20nasty.jpg,2020-12-09 06:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/rico-nasty-nightmare-vacation/,Atlantic,"It was Rico Nasty and Kenny Beats’ first time in the studio together. She asked him for heavy metal. Then she stepped out, took some molly, and came back in. He apparently hadn’t finished the beat yet, but Rico saw something in its half-baked state and insisted on recording. She might’ve been motivated by some rap beef, maybe not. Rico’s hook was simple yet deadly. Kind of like that time Ice Cube rhymed “AK” with “good day,” there was a sense of foreboding in its relief: “Thank God, I ain’t have to smack a bitch today.” The 2018 loosie “Smack a Bitch” laid the foundation for the Maryland rapper’s electrifying screamo rap—jagged guitar riffs, booming trap drums, and an unbridled rage that pushes Rico's vocal cords to the brink, hoarseness be damned. The song reappears with a deliriously chaotic remix on Rico’s official debut album, Nightmare Vacation, recalling the genesis of her punk-rap hybrid sound. The menacing rasp was simmering under the surface on standouts like “Key Lime OG” and “Poppin” from her 2017 mixtape Sugar Trap 2, but it wasn’t until 2018’s Nasty and 2019’s Anger Management that it took shape. Rico has talked of pop ambitions—one of her biggest inspirations is Rihanna—and like the Bajan icon, she finds multiple pit stops between the sweetness and fury of her various personas. In addition to Kenny Beats on “Smack a Bitch,” Rico enlists 16 other producers across 16 tracks, including Dylan Brady from 100 gecs and Take a Daytrip, hitmakers for Sheck Wes and Lil Nas X. There are more than a few moments of brilliance, but as a whole, the album lacks cohesion, feeling less exploratory and unbound than simply unfocused. Where Nasty brought Rico’s hard edges into sharper focus, Nightmare Vacation reshapes them, experimenting with cadence and tone in playful and exciting ways. Rico has mastered aggression but shirks formulas and predictability, stretching out the spectrum of anger and blending it with humor, bravado, and brattiness. The sparse keys and impish vocal contortions of “Check Me Out” recall the dexterity of OG Maco’s flow on the Vine staple “U Guessed It.” On the track, her equally strained and cheerful delivery of “you snooze you lose” is both hilarious and frightening, a polarizing combo that Rico somehow makes work. On the more extreme end, the grinding guitar loop and feverish overdubs of “Let It Out” are expertly engineered to remedy the pent-up frustration and anxiety that have come to characterize not just this calendar year, but every single one before it. Moving beyond rage, “iPhone” yearns for romance and conjures some of Rico’s most tender vocals, a considerable feat considering the maximalist production and extreme vocal effects of Dylan Brady’s production. Elsewhere, the flirty interplay between Aminé and Rico on “Back & Forth” is a welcome water break amidst the harder cuts, while the bubblegum singsong rap of the Don Toliver and Gucci Mane-assisted “Don’t Like Me” is a pleasant-but-forgettable pop number. The second half of the album drags and struggles to match the vigor that preceded it: The pop-leaning “No Debate” is uncharacteristically devoid of emotion, while “Own It” has the kind of groove and vapid soundbites you might hear at a club more interested in bottle service than the mosh pits of Rico’s live shows. Even “Pussy Poppin,” which is structured around a loop that sounds strikingly similar to the Triggaman beat, awkwardly fails to capture the ass-shaking magic of New Orleans bounce despite being built off the genre’s secret sauce. The deficiencies laid bare in the latter portion are almost wiped away by the “Smack a Bitch” remix. Featuring rap newcomers, ppcocaine, Sukihana, and Rubi Rose, the show-stopping posse cut takes the energy of the original, wraps it in explosives, and sets it on fire. Recalling the thrill of Nicki Minaj’s “Monster” verse, each rapper raises the bar set by the previous one, destroying and remaking the track as they go along. By the last verse, ppcocaine can barely be bothered to stay on beat as she threatens to run bitches over in her Tesla truck—it feels like you are riding shotgun with her.  Nightmare Vacation bursts with potential, and while not all of it is realized, the moments that click signal that Rico is an artist with a strong gut, confidently expanding the boundaries of her craft. In a recent interview with Coveteur, Rico discussed wanting to make music that explicitly referenced recent social unrest but stopped because it felt “cheesy” and” forced.” Her catalog has always reflected the time: In an age of immeasurable loss, the power of her raw expression—whether it be screams or angsty croons for affection—lies in its ability to excavate and release those feelings, giving way to something new and hopeful.","On her official debut, the electric rapper-singer is by turns deliriously chaotic, full of ambition, and unfocused as she tries a little of everything that’s made her a star.

Wonder,Shawn Mendes,by: Quinn Moreland,Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5fc9051b0ba465fcf55a972e/1:1/w_160/wonder_shawn%20mendes.jpg,2020-12-09 06:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/shawn-mendes-wonder/,Island,"Shawn Mendes wants the world to know: He is madly in love. As the 22-year-old singer explains in the recent Netflix documentary Shawn Mendes: In Wonder, every song he has ever written is about his pop star peer and girlfriend, Camila Cabello. Like all lovestruck wordsmiths, Mendes finds his true feelings too powerful to fully express. “I think it’s like when you see a moon or stars and you try and take a photo of it with your iPhone and then you just can’t, it just doesn’t look good,” he muses. “It’s not supposed to be captured, it’s just supposed to be for us.” But bless his heart, because Mendes’ fourth record, Wonder, sure does try. Across 14 songs (on the non-deluxe edition), Mendes spends nearly every minute bowled over by the power of love. It’s nice to see his cup overflow so bountifully, but the near-constant awe quickly grows tiresome, especially when conveyed through clichés like, “Your body’s like an ocean, I’m devoted to explore you” and, “You’re my sunlight on a rainy day.” At one point he croons that he “heard that once a wise man said, ‘Only fools go rushing in,’” as if this is supposed to be a seismic revelation. Mendes comes across like your friend who just got into a relationship and won’t shut up about it: You’re happy for them and also tremendously bored. According to In Wonder, Mendes and Cabello have been dating for a little over a year, but first met as teenagers—he was a guitarist who found fame covering pop songs on Vine, she was one-fifth of a girl group (can I make it any more obvious?). Mendes’ elevation of Cabello as his eternal muse is surely meant to be romantic, but it comes across as naive—and vaguely terrifying. It also reflects the biggest problem of Wonder: What’s stacked up to be the love of a lifetime feels a bit empty in presentation. All-consuming passion is reduced to familiar imagery of popping bottles, dancing on rooftops, and fantasizing about marriage; the sex scene is always safely off-screen. Yet Mendes’ desire to satisfy is as steadfast as his falsetto, which puts in the work on Wonder. On the somewhat funky “Teach Me How to Love,” featuring Anderson .Paak on drums, Mendes asks his partner to “draw a map” so he can properly pleasure her. Even if the subject matter is more than a little vanilla, Wonder is Mendes’ most musically adventurous album, touching on hip-thrusting R&B-lite, Beach Boys harmonics, and the occasional Tame Impala synth line. But every song is plagued by the same problem: Production that attempts to compensate for lyrical blandness by forcibly inserting drama. The title track circles around compelling themes like authenticity, the influence of toxic masculinity, and how it would feel to “live inside a world that isn’t black and white,” but Mendes soon brushes these aside in favor of a more pressing quandary: “I wonder what it’s like to be loved by you!” Every time he repeats the line, it’s with startling intensity, like Benjamin Franklin getting struck by a bolt of lightning. Lest you miss the profound stakes of this reflection, the production smacks you in the face with massive drums and soaring choral vocals. Even Mendes’ dreams are scored like IMAX movies. The beginning of “Call My Friends” offers a momentary reprieve from the onslaught: Over a melancholic piano, Mendes longs for the good times that have passed him by, mourning missed birthdays and yearning to put life on pause. Though his voice is undeniably beautiful, it’s quickly swallowed by a vortex of synths as he sings, “I should call my friends and go get hi-i-i-gh.” Wonder’s biggest swing-and-miss might be “Monster,” a duet with Mendes’ childhood inspiration, recovering-bad-boy-turned-wife-guy Justin Bieber. The two Canadian lads lament the psychic toll of fame, singing of pedestals, false confidence, and “sin,” achieving a level of insight so superficial that it’s entirely meaningless. In a sea of wannabe Biebers and sad Brits with guitars, Mendes has always been the nice guy, the boy next door who also could be an Abercrombie model. But he has yet to make a statement that truly sets him apart. Wonder offers a few intriguing hints of something deeper—nods to depression, loneliness, and rejection. All are quickly bypassed in search of a silver lining, but sometimes it’s worth lingering in those heavier feelings, if only to develop perspective. Near the end of Wonder, Mendes refers to “the boy who’s really underneath/all the scars and insecurities.” Who is that?","The pop heartthrob’s lovestruck fourth album comes across like your friend who just got into a relationship and won’t shut up about it: You’re happy for them and also tremendously bored.

Fuubutsushi (風物詩),"Jusell, Prymek, Sage, Shiroishi",by: Marty Sartini Garner,Contributor,"https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5fc6b3f1cecd494847656f1c/1:1/w_160/Fuubutsushi_M%20Sage,%20Lake%20Mary,%20Patrick%20Shiroishi%20&%20Chris%20Jusell.jpg",2020-12-09 06:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/jusell-prymek-sage-shiroishi-fuubutsushi/,Cached,"Seasons change in the mind and the body before they change in the world. Anyone who has felt spring bloom in their hearts on the first false day of sunshine, or been transported to autumns past by the crunch of a stray brown leaf on a late-summer afternoon, knows that climatological reality is not always in sync with our perception of how things should be. The Japanese word “fuubutsushi” refers to this gap, capturing the feeling of longing for a new season at the first signs of its emergence. After months of life looking like one thing, fuubutsushi marks the moment when you believe it may begin to look like something else. That feeling—not the out-of-time displacement of hope, so much, or the rush of anticipation, but the embodied understanding that things are about to change—suffuses this collaboration between violinist Chris Jusell, guitarist Chaz Prymek, percussionist and keyboardist Matthew Sage, and saxophonist Patrick Shiroishi. All four are prolific composers who have hooked up in various configurations in the past, often playing challenging takes on jazz and ambient music. For Fuubutsushi (風物詩), which was recorded remotely with each musician in a different U.S. state, they piece together soothing bits of jazz, ambient, folk, and classical minimalism with the ease and grace of a group of pals working on a jigsaw puzzle over warm cider. Listening to it can feel a little like relaxing in the home you imagine as you unpack your belongings in a new apartment: Everything is expertly placed and arranged with care. Fuubutsushi’s spacious production highlights the performances of the individual players, which in turn makes their interactions ring more clearly. In “Along the Causeway,” Sage’s piano rolls forward like a ball losing momentum uphill, falling back into a figure that recalls both the clipped phrases of Ethiopian classical music and the good cheer of Joe Hisaishi. Shiroishi takes the cue and flits alongside at the same pace, the early-morning hoarseness of his tone matched by Jusell’s violin. This focus on clarity recalls the famed production style of ECM Records, but Fuubutsushi is almost entirely lacking the high-minded stakes that underlie so much of that label’s work. This is less a conscious shot for posterity than a conversation among intimates. Still, that conversation frequently touches on the profound. On album opener “Bolted Orange,” whose kindheartedness recalls Sam Wilkes’ WILKES, they patiently fill space with the softest of interactions, as if they’re passing around a Fabergé egg. Jusell’s melodic sense reaches a peak in “Hayao’s Garden,” bringing to mind the stark drama of Björk, while flickering backmasked samples light up and are gone in a flash of poignance. Even “Watch the Time,” a “Hallogallo”-esque krautrocker that’s easily the album’s most upbeat song, evolves into something like Steve Reich’s Different Trains scaled down to living-room size. True to its title, nostalgia and longing permeate the album, along with a prevailing remembrance of how thin the present moment can be. In the hands of lesser artists, all this focus on the fleeting nature of beauty and the quiet erasure of time could easily drift into the saccharine, carried along on a stream of sentiment like a plastic bag on the wind. Jusell, Prymek, Sage, and Shiroishi seem to know it, and they willingly puncture any potential fragility with good humor, excellent pacing, and reminders of the world outside, an approach that reaches its apotheosis on album centerpiece “Freedom and Crap.” While the quartet tinkers with a miniature, two unidentified people speak about their experiences in some kind of prison. “I was kinda wistful for what was outside of the fence,” a female voice remarks, while a male voice concludes his story by saying, “I can’t imagine anybody liking it or having positive images of being locked up.” While the group treats this material with the reverence it deserves, they never slip into the po-faced. Without being avoidant, they create a soundscape that’s playful and loose; it’s like visiting Ernest Hoods’s Neighborhoods on a drizzly day. Rather than sensationalize the stories, the subdued mood highlights how tragically common they are. At this stage in our year of quarantine, it seems impossible not to empathize with those who are subject to incarceration. The need for true human connection has never been more obvious, and the intimacies we can achieve with one another have rarely felt so precious. Recorded a few months into lockdown, Fuubutsushi glows with this awareness: that even in our present darkness, there’s something beautiful, mysterious, and vital that’s generated when old friends find new ways to come together again, against all odds and as natural as can be.","On violin, guitar, saxophone, percussion, and keys, the quartet pieces together a carefully arranged mixture of jazz, ambient, folk, and classical minimalism.

El Último Tour del Mundo,Bad Bunny,by: Matthew Ismael Ruiz,"Associate Staff Writer, News",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5fc9015ac61c34a7841b1eb3/1:1/w_160/EL%20U%CC%81LTIMO%20TOUR%20DEL%20MUNDO_Bad%20Bunny%20.jpg,2020-12-08 06:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/bad-bunny-el-ultimo-tour-del-mundo/,Rimas,"From the first moments of his latest LP, El Último Tour Del Mundo, Bad Bunny declares the world his. “Yo hago lo que me dé la gana,” he reminds us of his growing influence. “¿Quién dijo que no?” It’s a hard assertion to dispute: During a pandemic that decimated large swaths of the music industry, his star has only risen. YHLQMDLG, released in March, flirted with the top of the pops and dominated the Latin charts; he’s graced awards-show stages and the covers of Western media’s storied publications; he’s evolved into a vocal ally of marginalized communities, with a willingness to acknowledge and rectify his mistakes; and with the release of El Último Tour Del Mundo, he’s made history with the first-ever No. 1 Spanish-language album on Billboard’s album chart. No other artist had more Spotify streams in 2020. For El Último Tour Del Mundo, Bad Bunny transports himself a decade into the future, imagining the music he’d play on his final world tour in 2030. It’s not his best record, but that’s almost beside the point. You’ll still find vestiges of his particular nuevo reggaetón sound on tracks like “Te Mudaste” and “Dákiti,” even if the latter is one of its weakest examples, pummeling the dembow riddim into submission with a thumping four-on-the-floor that’s devoid of any actual flavor. But by track four he takes a sharp left turn from the rap and perreo that defined previous LPs in favor of a morose, introspective vibe that pulls from British post-punk and the rock en español of Central and South America as much as it does the hip-hop and R&B of the American South. For better or worse, El Ultimó Tour Del Mundo’s rock sound leans heavily on producer Marco “MAG” Borrero (and, to a lesser extent, Borrero’s human riff machine Mick Coogan), best known for crafting pop hits for the likes of Flo Rida, Bebe Rexha, and Selena Gomez. The collaboration doesn’t always work; tracks like “Te Deseo Lo Mejor” and “Antes Que Se Acabe” suffer from a saccharine sound that’s generic enough to blend in with Top 40 radio. But when it does, it’s sublime. “Yo Visto Así” and “La Droga” inhabit the same universe of distorted emo rap as the late Lil Peep and Juice WRLD, with grunge guitars ringing out over rumbling trap beats. And “Maldita Pobreza,” a poor man’s lament that effortlessly bounces between buoyant new-wave riffs and booming 808s, evokes Café Tacvba, New Order, and modern-day traperos in equal measure, offering a glimpse of the brilliance that can result from Benito’s experimentation. These rock tendencies don’t come completely out of left field. Bad Bunny has previously dabbled in pop-punk (“Tenemos Que Hablar”) and metalcore (“Hablamos Mañana”), and even recruited Los Enanitos Verdes’ Marciano Cantero for his and J Balvin’s interpolation of the Argentinian rock band’s classic “Lamento Boliviano.” Each record served to expand the boundaries of urbano, Latin America’s catch-all for the myriad genres in “urban” (i.e. Black) music, eventually stretching it so thin as to render it transparently irrelevant. The new urbano—or el movimiento, as some have taken to calling it—is inclusive, a tent big enough for fans of Soda Stereo and strip-club beats, Pisces Iscariot and pro wrestling, Daddy Yankee and drag queens. Plenty of artists have tried to seamlessly integrate an international aesthetic, treating their tracklists like grocery lists and collecting sounds from around the world without a genuine connection to the music. Bad Bunny succeeds where they have failed because those influences come from within. He didn’t pull the Puerto Rican holiday song “Cantares de Navidad” from a spreadsheet of Google trends; it’s the music of his life. When it’s real, you can feel it. In that sense, El Último Tour Del Mundo gets at the core of what makes Bad Bunny so appealing. “Maldita Pobreza” isn’t just a trap-rock fusion experiment, it’s a reminder that Benito is less than half a decade removed from bagging groceries in Arecibo, daydreaming of exotic Italian sports cars. He toes the line between rap braggadocio and vulnerable everyman with relative ease—even while crooning about alien sex. Standing on top of the world, with access to abundant fame, wealth, and critical success, he appears free of any pressure to conform, even to previous versions of himself. He’s a beacon of light in barrios around the world, an example for kids with secret skirts or Smashing Pumpkins CDs of what being yourself can look and sound like. When he says he does whatever he wants, we believe him. Maybe we can, too.","Reggaetón’s biggest star closes a career-making 2020 with an album imagining his music in 2030: It’s morose, introspective, and pulls from post-punk and rock en español as much as it does hip-hop and R&B.

Late Night Tales,Khruangbin,by: Andy Beta,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5fcab7c81ef00c5e1192c91f/1:1/w_160/Late%20Night%20Tales_Khruangbin.jpg,2020-12-08 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/khruangbin-late-night-tales/,Late Night Tales,"Like most of the world, Houston slow-jam trio Khruangbin had big plans for 2020: a collaboration with Leon Bridges, a new album, a worldwide tour with fellow slow-psych purveyors Tame Impala. The pandemic waylaid their globe-trotting (though they still managed to make the cut on a former president’s summer playlist). Mark Speer has said of the enforced downtime that what he missed the most, aside from the live show, was DJing after-parties, where he might fold in cuts that reflected the band’s coordinates that particular night, like Serge Gainsbourg sleaze in Paris or funky molam in Bangkok. Khruangbin’s entry in the esteemed LateNightTales series closes a circle of sorts. It was on Bonobo’s own 2013 mix for the franchise that much of the world was introduced to Khruangbin via their hushed, meditative “A Calf Born in Winter,” the clear standout of the set. That instrumental sowed the seeds for their own global rise, so it’s fitting that a group prone to making eclectic, exploratory radio shows and playlists would finally take the LNT reins themselves. The time-loosening, un-placeable qualities generally associated with the band apply to the mix itself. Spanning from the early 1970s to the past year, the trio’s 15 worldly selections favor a hazy, sun-bleached sound: Every new track conjures the image of a thousand dust motes spilling into the air as the record is pulled off the shelf. Much of the mix is rooted in their hometown, from local artists to a spirit of eclecticism that reflects the diversity of the city itself. They feature the city’s dub-and-vocoder outfit Brilliantes del Vuelo as well as Kelly Doyle and his ponging drum machine and exotica guitar; the spoken-word piece that closes the set comes from another Houstonian, Tierney Malone, paired with a banjo version of Erik Satie’s “Gnossienne.” Another portion nods to their live set. Onstage, Khruangbin have long played a medley that weaves together old funk and hip-hop rhythms, slotting Kool & the Gang’s jazz-funk classic “Summer Madness” alongside tunes like “Nothin’ but a G Thang” and “Electric Relaxation,” and they finally record a studio version of “Summer Madness” here. Fully inhabiting the song’s mellow haze, Speer’s guitar captures the psychedelic soaring of the original’s Arp and Mellotron. Elsewhere, the group ranges far and wide. They open with “Illuminations,” Alice Coltane’s mystical 1974 collaboration with Carlos Santana, the one corner of her catalog that hasn’t experienced a renaissance yet. It’s a baffling entry point on the surface, packing more drama, dissonance, and ornate opulence than anything in the Khruangbin aesthetic. But in Santana’s long, sustained strings, one can hear the careful pacing of Speer’s own guitar work. Playful motifs run across the mix, like the big, chewy bass tones of South Korean trio Sanullim, Ethiopia’s Roha Band, and Nigerian boogie singer Maxwell Udoh (the latter doing an excellent job of repurposing the whispered come-on of Marvin Gaye’s “Sexual Healing” for a more upbeat setting). The detached cool of Nazia Hassan’s Bollywood disco classic “Khushi” echoes in the deadpan disco of Justine & the Victorian Punks’ “Still You,” a delirious cut from downtown composer and Arthur Russell collaborator Peter Gordon. Sensuous, sax-laced, inscrutable, sprawling, and woozy, it’s as mysterious now as it was back in 1979. As to be expected, some of Khruangbin’s digs are ludicrously deep, like the cassette-only Latin pop tune from crooner David Marez or Gerald Lee’s lo-fi soul number from the never-released soundtrack to blaxploitation film Black Shampoo (IMDB keywords: “pubic hair,” “mafia,” “barbecue party”). But after a few times through, smooth yacht rock from Japan and Belarus loses its luster and just sounds like yacht rock. And even though the tempo barely tops 100 bpm, all the far-flung fusions of Asian pop, Nigerian reggae, and Korean boogie leave Khruangbin’s set feeling a little like a busy touring schedule on the international festival circuit: both awe-inspiring and exhausting.","A mixtape from Houston’s worldly psych trio digs deep into funk classics, spiritual jazz, and unusual finds from South Korea, Belarus, and Nigeria.

The Hustle Continues,Juicy J,by: Dylan Green,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5fc92e9c96ab91ca523e2cad/1:1/w_160/Juicy_J_the_hustle_continues_2020.jpg,2020-12-08 06:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/juicy-j-the-hustle-continues/,eOne,"Juicy J opens “Po Up,” the fourth song from his fifth solo album The Hustle Continues, on a nostalgic note. We hear the sound of liquid filling a cup and then the Tennessee rapper-producer lists the names of several icons who recently passed away, from rappers Nipsey Hussle and Juice WRLD to filmmaker John Singleton and basketball star Kobe Bryant. The moment charts a genealogy through Juicy’s long and prosperous career; he first formed his group Three 6 Mafia with Lord Infamous and DJ Paul in 1991, the same year Singleton released his breakout film Boyz n the Hood. The Mafia released their debut album Mystic Stylez in 1995, one year before Bryant became a first-round NBA draft pick for the Los Angeles Lakers. Much like Singleton and Bryant, Juicy J altered the foundation of his chosen field, honoring its roots while blazing a new trail with an irreverent smirk. The Hustle Continues is proof that Juicy’s sound remains unstuck in time almost 30 years later. The ear-shattering low end and hellacious synths and keyboards he’s trafficked in since his start are more popular now than ever, and he knows it. Hustle, then, is Juicy’s attempt at continuing to carry the torch, like the favorite uncle you can always count on to shut down the VIP section at the club. He sounds particularly engaged at his best, ready to occupy familiar roles with ease. He oozes menace on opener “Best Group” and “Memphis to LA,” where he trades tales of guns and death with TDE’s Jay Rock and fellow Three 6 member Project Pat. “Shopping Spree” and “She Gon Pop It” sound like the strip-club standards they’re destined to be once clubs and bars are safe to attend again post-COVID. His voice billows across the skittering drums of weed anthems “Gah Damn High” and “What I Need.” Juicy sounds like he’s still having fun and, most importantly, like he wants listeners to have fun, too. The fun reaches another level when Juicy raps alongside younger artists. “Killa” floats a fierce piano refrain and trunk-rattling 808s down the river Styx and teases an uncharacteristically high-energy verse out of Griselda rapper Conway the Machine. Young Dolph and Megan Thee Stallion bring this same energy out of Juicy on “Shopping Spree” and “She Gon Pop It,” respectively, confirming why both continuously come to Juicy for beats on their albums. Unfortunately, plenty of features that seemed great on paper come across as stale and awkward in execution. A$AP Rocky (“Po Up”) and new Memphis star Key Glock (“That’s The Way It Goes”) sound asleep at the wheel while others, like Jay Rock, sound out of place. Maryland rapper Logic—who’s already omnipresent throughout as the voice behind Juicy’s new beat tag—is given two features, both of which are energetic but rife with bars that crumble like Nature Valley granola  (“Was never one for the Akademiks/But knew the everyday struggle”). The worst of Hustle’s features either feel like padding or derail the album’s meticulously crafted atmosphere. The Hustle Continues isn’t concerned with rewriting the book of Juicy J. There are no risks taken and the stakes aren’t particularly high, but they don’t need to be. At 45 years old, Juicy is a legacy act whose influence can be seen in rappers from Tyler, The Creator to Travis Scott to Rae Sremmurd. He seems content with the privilege of collecting publishing on his vast back catalog and clearly relishes creating alongside his progeny in the process. When the stars align this smoothly, sometimes the best option is to simply stay fly.","On his fifth solo album, the Memphis legend invites guests like Jay Rock and Megan Thee Stallion, splitting the difference between coasting and staying fly.

Lesions of a Different Kind,Undeath,by: Sam Sodomsky,Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5fc6b1fbf8ec840b076093d8/1:1/w_160/Lesions%20of%20a%20Different%20Kind_Undeath.jpg,2020-12-08 06:00:00,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/undeath-lesions-of-a-different-kind/,Prosthetic,"Death is their chief lyrical concern and avowed metal subgenre, but the members of Rochester, New York’s Undeath share a decidedly life-affirming outlook. “I think all of us love death metal so much,” vocalist Alexander Jones explained to Invisible Oranges, “because when it’s done well, it sits right at the intersection of pure musicianship and mindless fun.” There is a specific type of fun he is referring to: the spine-tingling thrill of campy horror movies, of screaming unintelligibly for no reason at all, of song titles like “Kicked in the Protruding Guts” and “Chained to a Reeking Rotted Body.” It is the restless, ridiculous heartbeat underlying their music. After a few well-loved demos, Undeath’s debut album, Lesions of a Different Kind, never leans too far to either side of the death metal pendulum. It is a vicious and nauseating blast: catchy, impenetrable, and masterfully executed. What appeals about a song like “Acidic Twilight Visions” is the immediacy—a pummeling groove, a climactic solo, an honest-to-god chorus. But the closer you listen, the more you hear the virtuosity underlying their chaos, a complex web of interlocking parts that can turn on a dime from jackhammer shredding to guttural dissonance. This old-school death metal, akin to the early work from fellow breakout revivalists like Tomb Mold and Blood Incantation, involves a purposeful lack of dynamics, indecipherable lyrics, and melodies that seem in danger of dissolving into a murky, low-end drone. The strength of the songs largely comes down to the riffs, which are remarkable throughout. Nearly every track opens with a memorable guitar part from Kyle Beam, and he guides his bandmates through an album that brings to mind plenty of the greats (Autopsy, Morbid Angel, Cannibal Corpse, and more are saluted in the liner notes) but coheres into a singular force. This confidence allows Lesions of a Different Kind to stand out in the field of gory death metal worship. It also helps that the band has leveled up on the production, resulting in an album built for repeated listens. On their early demos, part of the excitement was hearing exceptional death metal rising from the fog: their killer interplay buried beneath layers of fuzz and gnarly tones at war with the songcraft. But on Lesions, Undeath give their music a visceral, lived-in clarity. Drummer Matt Browning, who also illustrated the cover art, comes through the speakers sounding particularly vicious: His manic performance in the title track plays like someone tasked with replicating the sound of aerial warfare. If Undeath sound hyper-focused on one style, their commitment to this vision is also part of their appeal. The lyrics, mostly penned by Beam, take delight in exploring death, torture, and general disfigurement from every angle. When the Black Dahlia Murder’s Trevor Strnad accompanies Jones on the title track, their call-and-response helps the subject matter ascend toward something communal, ready to shouted back at them. The message is plain: The human body is disgusting. Man’s capacity for evil knows no limits. The end is near and always looming closer. Undeath excel by soundtracking these thoughts through pitch-perfect metal bursting with energy. For them, death is only the beginning.","The Rochester band’s debut is a vicious and nauseating blast of classic death metal: catchy, impenetrable, and masterfully executed.

Odin’s Raven Magic,Sigur Rós,by: Vanessa Ague,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5fc690ec96ab91ca523e2b4e/1:1/w_160/Odin's%20Raven%20Magic_sigur%20ros.jpg,2020-12-07 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/sigur-ros-odins-raven-magic/,Krunk,"The end of the world looms as Odin, Norse deity of war and death, joins his fellow gods for a banquet. His trusty ravens, Huginn and Muninn, traverse barren fields, gathering the world’s wisdom while the gods feast and watch for omens. This portentous meal is the subject of a poem written in the traditional style of Edda, the collection of Icelandic mythology and prose dating back to the 13th century, and of Sigur Rós’s Odin’s Raven Magic. On the eight-part operatic work, the Icelandic band funnels its serene, immersive style into theatrical storytelling, evoking a lively yet uneasy scene with eerie harmony and cinematic scope that wavers between exuberance and heavy-handed melodrama. Odin’s Raven Magic is something of a myth itself—though Sigur Rós first performed it live 18 years ago, it’s never received a proper recording. Before now, only fragments of the lengthy work hovered around the internet, captured by eager audiences at crowded shows. This uninterrupted rendition was recorded live in 2004 at La Grande Halle de la Villette in Paris; you might forget it’s a live performance until the end, when the music fades away and applause erupts. Trading their signature bowed guitar for bowed orchestral instruments, Sigur Rós approach the long history of operas that borrow from mythology with a sense of tranquility. This music swims through melancholy and euphoria, full of grand melodies fit for a Game of Thrones feature film. The strongest moments come when there’s motion, like on “Prologus,” which highlights the orchestra’s subtle shifts between dissonance and consonance, and “Spár eða spakmál,” where a swooping choir, booming horn, and urgent percussion build a sense of exhilaration. Sigur Rós’ performance is skilled, but their commitment to placidity limits the album’s dramatic capability. Such a menacing tale demands tumultuous color, and opera provides the perfect inspiration for over-the-top storytelling. “Stendur æva” could’ve come as a punch in the gut, but instead a lackluster choir and lilting vocals leave it feeling oversaturated. By illustrating mythology with even-keeled sound rather than diving into its turbulence, Sigur Rós glosses over the magnitude of the catastrophe they’re trying to describe. The star of Odin’s Raven Magic, besides its folklore, is the twinkling marimba that appears throughout. This isn’t a regular marimba: Built by Páll Guðmundsson, it replaces the usual wooden slats with Icelandic stones, swapping an earthy tone for an icy one. The instrument pops in and out with a delicate, pulsating rhythm that provides an exigent backdrop, subtle yet omnipresent, like a ticking doomsday clock. It’s a recurring theme that makes its first appearance on the sing-songy “Dvergmál,” where gradual layering and generous drums create the record’s truest synthesis of post-rock sensibility and minimalist austerity. The marimba anchors the spacious sound, reminding us of the impending peril that lies beneath the serenity. Sigur Rós’s music has always felt panoramic, and Odin’s Raven Magic is no different; its sweeping melodies harken back to landmark albums like Ágætis byrjun, but this time, the music foregrounds orchestra and choir. When the sprawling sound becomes overwhelming, it’s the hidden details that prove most tantalizing, telling the album’s story beneath the wandering melodies. Sigur Rós may be more commonly associated with relaxation, but when they allow elements like Guðmundsson’s anxious marimba to drive their music, the feeling lingers.","The Icelandic post-rockers waver between exuberance and heavy-handed melodrama on the first official recording of an 18-year-old operatic work based on a centuries-old medieval poem.

Force Majeure,Dezron DouglasBrandee Younger,by: Daniel Felsenthal,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5fc7e7ecc61c34a7841b1ea8/1:1/w_160/Force%20Majeure_Dezron%20Douglas%20&%20Brandee%20Younger.jpg,2020-12-07 06:00:00,Jazz,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/dezron-douglas-brandee-younger-force-majeure/,International Anthem,"COVID-19 has put the music world in jeopardy, canceling concerts and threatening the livelihoods of countless people at every end of the business. The virus has also led to the predominance of the livestream, changing the nature of performance itself: Solos and duos are more common, romantic couples collaborate frequently, lamps are the new LEDs. The virtual gig is as intimate as an Instagram feed—to the sorry extent that it’s unlikely to put food on an artist’s table. No album I’ve heard has documented this predicament as directly as Force Majeure. A collaboration between the harpist Brandee Younger and her partner, the bassist Dezron Douglas, the record is named for a clause in contracts that enables venues and promoters across the world to cancel events because of an “act of God,” which became a euphemism for the global pandemic. Marooned together in their East Harlem apartment, and without a foreseeable chance to make income from touring, Douglas and Younger streamed a set each Friday during which they ran through a range of numbers, cracked jokes, commented on the dead-seriousness of now, and offered a strangely personal window into their coupledom against the backdrop of New York City’s lockdown. The couple collected the greatest hits of their quarantine series, which ran from March to June, into Force Majeure, a 51-minute, proudly impromptu record. Aside from one shimmering original, all of the compositions are covers, including jazz mainstays such as John Coltrane’s “Wise One,” hits by pop titans like the Stylistics and Kate Bush, and even a selection from Sesame Street. The result feels like a rediscovery of common ground. Since meeting at the Hartt School of Music, Younger and Douglas have each played bandleader, and they’ve recorded together frequently, but their careers have ridden different highs: Younger established herself as the harpist of choice for A-list pop musicians, appearing on Beyoncé’s Homecoming documentary as well as on releases by Lauryn Hill, John Legend, Common, and Moses Sumney. Douglas has equal facility on the upright and the bass guitar, and he’s followed a more conventional trajectory as a sought-after sideman, performing most notably with Pharoah Sanders. Force Majeure gives the impression of two busy musicians relearning how jazz can be a shared language as well as a weekly balm. On a version of Sanders’ classic “The Creator Has a Master Plan,” Douglas calls out chord changes, like he and his partner haven’t run through the song together before, or at least not in a while: the result, nonetheless, is fluid and assured. The limitations imposed by Coronavirus become strengths. Force Majeure was recorded on a single microphone, and likely for technical reasons, Douglas relies mostly on an acoustic double bass. Younger loses the crutch of the larger ensembles favored by the maestras of her instrument, Dorothy Ashby and Alice Coltrane, forcing her to engage with more pluck and forethought. One of the record’s most beautiful tracks, “Gospel Trane,” transposes Coltrane’s original piano part to the harp, a sly commentary on the depth of Younger’s engagement with her predecessor as well as an ingenious demonstration of the harp’s versatility. Elsewhere, playing the Jackson 5’s “Never Can Say Goodbye,” Younger’s strumming makes the main hook sound like a circular guitar riff. Douglas’ bass work is a similar exercise in resourcefulness and possibility. He slaps when the songs beg for a beat and moves between percussive structure and melody with honed instincts. Sprinkled throughout is Younger and Douglas’ banter—calling these conversations “skits” would be misleading, considering how off-the-cuff their ad-libs are. On the outro, Younger advises listeners, “Don’t go to bars.” Douglas counters, “If you go to the bar, go to the ones where there’s not a lot of people.” A minor, good-natured disagreement plays out, one that is hilariously relatable for anyone who’s navigating COVID safety while living with another person. This improvised speech circles around, a couple of times, to a statement that serves as the album’s theme: “Black music cannot be recreated, it can only be expressed.” Force Majeure never feels like a retread, but a response to the difficult circumstances of its creation—an expression of coupledom, identity, and persevering domesticity that could only exist in the gloom and chaos of 2020. Unadorned with tech or post-production, the bass, harp, and spoken voice offer us the experience of jazz-as-process. We’ve already seen this process unfold, week after week, in front of a webcam. On record, Younger and Douglas show us the extent of the musical path they blazed, which may be narrow, but they cleared it beautifully while the rest of the world was standing still.","Holed up in their East Harlem apartment, the bassist and harpist express the early days of lockdown intimately and beautifully with one mic and a set of mostly covers from John Coltrane to Kate Bush.

Sand Like Stardust,Jordan Reyes,by: Dave Segal,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5fbd8b4896ab91ca523e27c3/1:1/w_160/Sand%20Like%20Stardust_Jordan%20Reyes.jpg,2020-12-07 06:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/jordan-reyes-sand-like-stardust/,American Dreams,"Since 2017, Jordan Reyes has been an important cog in the large Chicago ensemble ONO, whose 2020 album Red Summer is a radical outlier in American music: an industrial-funk opus that excoriates racial, sexual, political, and military oppression from the 1600s to the present with poetry and a maximalist, disorienting sonic attack. By contrast, Reyes’ solo work has skewed more austere and synth-based. On last year’s Close, he quested for post-human feelings in alien synth emissions. Closer, from earlier this year, offered exploratory synthesizer music that resembled some of the more agitated, sinister specimens that dotted the IDM field in the late ’90s and early ’00s. With Sand Like Stardust, Reyes adds acoustic, electric, and lap-steel guitars, trombone, keyboards, and an electronic drum to his palette in order to, he says, “channel the warmth, immediacy, and vulnerability of hand-played instruments and voice.” However, this more organic foray is far from an overfamiliar back-to-roots exercise. Rather, it’s a bold attempt to fuse folk and electronic music without succumbing to the tropes of either. Inspired by the Tejano side of Reyes’s family and a childhood blanket covered in cowboy imagery, Sand Like Stardust chronicles the media-manipulated myth of that American archetype along with the more reality-rooted concept of the nature-oriented cowboy, according to the artist’s notes on Bandcamp. Further, Reyes told online zine Slug, “I felt inclined to imagine the cowboy as an ecosensual outsider, someone scrappy and magical with an amorous love of the land but who is reckoning with their identity’s legacy and ancestry.” As interesting as those points may be, the music stands on its own merits. The album aptly begins with “The Pre-Dawn Light,” which layers polyphonic chants, both guttural and ethereal, as if to herald the launch of a grave and mysterious ritual. It’s a bold, unconventional way to start an album, but it’s riveting. From there, Reyes proceeds through stages of the day with subtle gradations of mood. As their titles suggest, “Drifter,” “High Noon,” and “Dusted” conjure the profound lonesomeness of the peripatetic cowboy. “High Noon” particularly stands out, as Reyes pits blurred guitar twangs that evoke the work of New Zealand’s Roy Montgomery against a trombone drone ominously humming like a distant generator and more sonorous chants that vibrate your skull. Extremely moving in inexplicable ways, these songs send a primal thrum to your pineal gland. At times, Sand Like Stardust takes on the quality of a Goblin horror soundtrack transferred to the dusty American West. For example, “A Grain of Sand” inspires a suspenseful chill with a doomsday riff that suggests a man’s final trudge to the electric chair, as guitar ostinati form cascades of radiance over insistent drum-machine beats. Reyes achieves the extraordinary feat of making hopelessness seem transcendent. Stardust reaches a disturbing peak with “An Unkindness,” featuring dire chants and startling trombone blurts, all counteracted with twinkling guitar mandalas. This strange combination of elements triggers rich yet contradictory feelings. “Centaurus” hymns us to slumber with forlorn, foggy ambience that hints of side two of David Bowie’s Low. Reyes sings the lyrics to the traditional lullaby “Hush, Little Baby” as a keyboard drone swells in elegiac splendor. What could’ve come off as saccharine instead ascends to a state of grace and gravitas. Enveloped in the murk, you suspect Sand Like Stardust may have been yet another mythical American dream after all.","The experimental Chicago musician expands his already broad instrumental palette for a lonesome album that fuses folk and electronic music without succumbing to the tropes of either.

The Fink,Lee Paradise,by: Zach Schonfeld,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5fc69269d0bced25a8ae9839/1:1/w_160/the%20fink_lee%20paradise.jpg,2020-12-07 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/lee-paradise-the-fink/,Telephone Explosion,"A decade ago, Toronto band Hooded Fang specialized in the kind of jovial, sun-kissed indie pop that flourished in the mid-to-late aughts. Their 2010 debut, Album, was full of cheerful garage rock smoothed over with handclaps and horns; an accompanying music video featured colorful shots of a puppet playing the xylophone. Yet by the mid-2010s, the band had left the Sesame Street cosplay behind, dousing their sound in jagged noise-punk aggression on 2016’s Venus on Edge. One missing link in that evolution: Water Palace Kingdom, singer Daniel Lee’s 2014 solo release under the name Lee Paradise, a bleak and underappreciated gem steeped in chilly krautrock precision and Silver Apples minimalism. Six and a half years later, Lee Paradise has finally delivered a follow-up. Yet neither Hooded Fang’s slide into dissonance nor anything Lee has done previously could quite prepare fans for The Fink, an uncommonly funky set of proto-industrial grooves topped with emotionless vocals drained of all discernible human qualities. The album’s sleek dystopian edge may be fortuitously well-timed in 2020, but it’s not by happenstance. Lee’s goal was to summon the sound of “a wasteland where the sun doesn’t shine and humans have long ceased to be relevant beyond contributing to their own self-destruction.” In the tradition of generations of anxious punks before him, he succeeds in making such a grim vision danceable, plunging into staticky dance-punk (“Boogie”), an uneasy approximation of dub (“Maintaining Platitudes”), and queasy synths that shriek like those not-quite-real emergency alarms in disaster movies (“Positive Manifestations”). But Lee’s main interest here is rhythm. His grooves have grown heavier and more sophisticated since Water Palace Kingdom, and with the help of some unlikely influences—the 1970s disco-funk of producer Walter Whisenhunt, early ’80s dub records by Scientist, the hard-hitting rap beats created by the Alchemist—The Fink trembles and quakes with a relentless, trance-like pulse. On “A Present to Ponder,” the musician prophesies a disturbing vision of climate apocalypse (“Oceans filled with bones of machines/All its guts in disarray”) over thick snare crashes and synth screeches worthy of the Psycho score. “Message to the Past” is even funkier; it’s got a taut, slithery bassline and a hypnotic vocal melody that resembles Damo Suzuki at his most disciplined. Clouds of alien noise hover around the fringes of the mix. Lee has described the album as “cyborg-funk,” but owing in large part to its emphasis on kick and snare drum samples, the music isn’t synthetic or stiff. You can imagine it emanating from a group of warm-blooded humans onstage, and in fact these tracks took shape during live performances with Hooded Fang drummer Jonathan Pappo and Toronto electronic artist Michael Butler (aka Beta Frontiers), who squeezes squelchy textures out of a Yamaha CS-5 synthesizer. The analog aesthetic has plenty in common with another recent release from Canada’s Telephone Explosion label, Freak Heat Waves’ Zap the Planet. Only when Lee abandons the guiding funk pulse, as on the muddled, indistinct “Medicinal Magic,” does The Fink start to lose its charm. Yet the album’s buzzing dread never quite lets up. Lee sounds like a grim soothsayer, forecasting a sunless world on “A Present to Ponder” and exhorting his followers to “run, run, run till the blood runs out” on “Maintaining Platitudes.” Play this stuff back-to-back with Hooded Fang’s sunny debut, and it’s like staring at opposite sides of a “me in 2010 vs. me in 2020” meme. On the bright side: Who knew the apocalypse would be this funky?","Toronto musician Daniel Lee’s second solo album delivers a dark and relentlessly funky set of proto-industrial grooves with a sleek dystopian edge.

Bizarre Ride II the Pharcyde,The Pharcyde,by: Ross Scarano,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5fcbf3bf31aac5e8d081776e/1:1/w_160/081227678326.jpg,2020-12-06 06:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/the-pharcyde-bizarre-ride-ii-the-pharcyde/,Delicious Vinyl,"In 1992, legendary stand-up comic Richard Pryor began work on new material in preparation for a tour. Appearing drawn and frail from multiple sclerosis and years of unruly living, Pryor performed sets at Los Angeles’ Comedy Store while sitting in an easy chair. He sometimes relied on the arm of his assistant to guide him to his place under the lights on stage. Like the first heart attack in ’77 or the horrifying freebasing incident in ’80, the trials of his disease became part of the routine, and he joked freely about his body turning on him. How his 51-year-old dick no longer worked how he wanted. How it wasn’t unusual now, to piss himself. The personal moments of weakness and shame became a source of laughter among strangers at the small venue on the Sunset Strip. Nearby, in a graffitied house near the USC campus of South Central L.A., the original members of the Pharcyde absorbed the eye-popping honesty and absurdity of the ribald albums Pryor cut in the ’70s. Holed up at the digs they dubbed the Pharcyde Manor, they worked on their debut album Bizarre Ride II the Pharcyde over the better part of 1992, elaborating on a demo made up of three gems: “Passin’ Me By,” “Officer,” and “Ya Mama.” Pryor’s language, gathered from bits like “White and Black People” and “Black Funerals,” showed up in their lyrics and in the production, sampled from vinyl. He was their spiritual kin. Bizarre Ride II the Pharcyde remains one of the most boisterous and creative acts of adolescent knuckleheadedness and confession in hip-hop history. The album, released in November of 1992, is as much the product of the Black comedic tradition as it is a continuation of the sample-drunk playfulness of De La Soul’s 3 Feet High and Rising, Beastie Boys’ Paul’s Boutique, or the Digital Underground’s Sex Packets. It borrows from the past, delights in the present, and anticipates the future. One song (“Ya Mama”) consists entirely of the Dozens, a dissing game that leaves no mother spared and no friend free from embarrassment. It’s an album of outrageousness, the kind that brings tears squeezing through the creases around your eyes because your friend just said the smartest stupid shit you’ve ever heard. And instead of the moment dissipating like weed smoke, it’s laid down permanently on wax. “I suppose the first thing I was allowed to laugh at without fear of repercussion was myself,” the L.A.-born novelist and poet Paul Beatty wrote in the introduction to Hokum: An Anthology of African-American Humor. Pryor recounts a similar realization in his autobiography, Pryor Convictions: “I sat on a railing of bricks and found that when I fell off on purpose everyone laughed.” A dog walked through the yard to defecate and Pryor improvised: “I got up, ran to my grandmother, and slipped in the dog poop. It made Mama and the rest laugh again. Shit, I was really onto something then. So I did it a second time….That was my first joke. All in shit.” Running counter to the steely-eyed displays of power on Ice-T and N.W.A. records, Bizarre Ride is full of self-deprecation and ego deflation; the group is almost aggressive in their willingness to talk about masturbation and STDs (“If Magic can admit he got AIDS, fuck it: I got herpes”), about the molecular-level hurt of heartbreak, about generally coming off as weirdo punks. Like Pryor, they’d found that “human untidiness” (to use Hilton Als’ apt description) was good fodder, especially when you didn’t take the dripping, nasty stuff very seriously. Before getting into rapping full time, most of the MCs in the Pharcyde entered the revolving door of show business through dance, and none could be accused of taking shit too seriously. Trevant “Slimkid3” Hardson linked with Emandu “Imani” Wilcox at Torrance’s El Camino College in the late 1980s—Tre an Elco student, and Imani still a high school senior. Both made their living as dancers, frequenting local clubs, chasing after young ladies, and scoping other crews. They had some interest in making music, but in a lackadaisical, adolescent fashion; they needed guidance. A local after-school music program for aspiring musicians and entertainers called the South Central Unit (SCU) would provide a new structure and setting for their ambition. Juan Manuel Martinez, a teenage R&B producer known as J-Swift, introduced them to SCU, which occupied three bungalows in Inglewood and housed a mirrored room for dance rehearsals, a recording studio, and various musical equipment. Bankrolled by Reggie Andrews, who had produced and co-written smashes like the Dazz Band’s “Let It Whip,” SCU became the Pharcyde’s home base and incubator. (Thundercat, Kamasi Washington, and Terrace Martin also studied at SCU.) Soon, Romye “Bootie Brown” Robinson, from Pasadena, and Derrick “Fatlip” Stewart, from Fairfax, rounded out the crew. Most of the guys still danced in music videos and at competitions to make money, but with Andrews and J-Swift in the picture, music became the mission. J-Swift would produce (using samples culled from Andrews’ massive record collection); Tre, Imani, Romye, and Fatlip would rap; and Andrews would help navigate the industry side. (Andrews was soon replaced by a younger guy, Paul Stewart, who had managed House of Pain and was more familiar with the rap game.) “We danced for Tone Loc,” Romye told journalist Andrew Barker in his 33 1/3 book on Bizarre Ride. “You know how rappers used to have all these niggas boogying in the background? We were the niggas in the background, boogying.” The dance circuit, with all its auditions, was a grind, even if it did earn them a couple appearances as “Fly Guys” on In Living Color. By the time the crew was ready for record label auditions, they’d started to feel the burnout. “I feel like we performed for every record label that meant anything,” Tre recalled to Barker. “We got fed up.” Maxed out on performing for industry suits, the group put together a different routine for one memorable audition. They bought one-piece mechanic’s coveralls and wore them without anything underneath. “And on our asses we wrote the name of our band, right down to the last ass,” Tre told Barker—one letter per cheek. When the performance was over, they doffed the coveralls and literally showed their asses. Then they walked out. The accounts differ, but at some point in the late ’60s, Richard Pryor reached a breaking point onstage at a Las Vegas club. He couldn’t do the whitewashed, punchline-dependent comedy he’d been told was the only way he would make it, and he abruptly quit at the start of his set. As he recalled in his autobiography, “I asked myself, ‘Who’re they looking at, Rich?’... And in that flash of introspection when I was unable to find an answer, I crashed… I turned and walked off the stage.” After that, he started being Richard Pryor. He released albums with titles like That Nigger’s Crazy and Craps (After Hours). The cover of the latter depicted Pryor among an intergenerational group of Black people, throwing dice on a felt table under cheap yellow light, in casual defiance of the “No Gambling” sign hanging in the background. It’s the kind of grubby and fertile nightlife scene he knew from his childhood in Peoria, Illinois, where he was raised by his grandmother among the network of whorehouses she ran. This is the material the Pharcyde used for inspiration when recording their debut. The first voice heard on Bizarre Ride II the Pharcyde is Pryor’s. Sampled from a bit about Sugar Ray Robinson on Craps, he delivers the project’s mission statement: “Oh shit!” After J-Swift’s brief instrumental intro fades out, Pryor’s exclamation cuts into the dead air. Then the drums come in as the group incredulously repeats the phrase after him, introducing their premier posse cut, “Oh Shit.” Tre jumps in first, beginning his verse by flipping the “Little Sally Walker” nursery rhyme into something dirty, fitting only for the back of the school bus or the loudest table in the lunchroom. Tre’s voice undulates with melodic possibility—he’s on the verge of becoming a singer, if only he’d let a little more vibrato in. (His bittersweet solo cut “Otha Fish” is a perfect song in part because he finally does.) His verse reaches its punchline when, while seemingly alone with a ""brown-eyed bombshell,"" he’s instead caught having sex by his entire school; J-Swift embellishes the moment with another wry Pryor bit: “He came and went at the same time.” Sampling aside, J-Swift’s musicality is one of the most impressive parts of his production. His beats are never simple loops, but almost always complex productions that evolve over the course of the song. Bouncing in like a rubber ball, Imani joyfully squeaks through a verse about sleeping with his friend Greg’s mom, who is eager but also sort of frightening, undercutting the alleged bravado of the act a bit. (Of course, Greg catches them, doggy-style, on the living room couch: “Oh shit!”) Then, after Imani’s verse, a darker piano bit enters the mix to set up Fatlip. Another Pryor sample appears—“son of a bitch”—and Fatlip describes one summer evening on Crenshaw Boulevard with a trans woman. It’s not difficult to imagine the verse devolving into something violent in the hands of a different artist; Fatlip, on the other hand, feels tricked but laughs at his situation. The verse isn’t exactly sensitive—it clumsily distorts transphobia into a punchline—but its ignorance acknowledges his own insecurity. Each verse of “Oh Shit” gestures to the anxiety underneath macho posturing about sex. (Coincidentally, their muse also once spun a bit about guys too afraid to ask if their partners had come.) That soft underbelly is exposed fully on “Passin’ Me By,” the group’s highest-charting single and that rare sort of song that can reasonably take credit for entire careers. (Where would the puppy-dog wistfulness of early Drake have come from if “Passin’ Me By” hadn’t existed?) A miraculous simp anthem, “Passin’ Me By” tells four tales of unrequited love that leaves everyone with their dignity intact. J-Swift’s beat is a marvel of wonky craftsmanship, combining several different samples into a creaky framework for the guys to empty the lowest moments of their young lives into. They share their wisdom too: “I guess a twinkle in her eye is just a twinkle in her eye”—cold comfort to live by. “Passin’ Me By” isn’t the first rap song about wanting love, but it refuses the smooth bravado of LL Cool J or the ridiculousness of Biz Markie. The guys sound sincerely wounded by unrequited desire. It’s the sort of tenderness that was not very hip-hop—or, as Fatlip used to say during the recording of the album: “This shit ain’t bangin’ in the hood.” On their Bizarre Ride, the members of the Pharcyde gleefully run around a cartoonish version of Southern California with pins, popping norms like balloons. Traditional masculinity, being hard, being a player: pop, pop, pop. At a time when Los Angeles hip-hop was typified by gangsta rap as heard on Straight Outta Compton and The Chronic, Bizarre Ride is fearlessly quotidian and relatively low-stakes. Even “Officer,” their irreverent homage to Public Enemy’s “Black Steel in the Hour of Chaos,” turns the real peril of operating a motor vehicle as a Black male into a comic escapade. Though the album is not without its tensions. Immediately after “Oh Shit,” the first skit, “It’s Jigaboo Time,” begins. It’s a queasy number that lists the acts that would earn an artist the titular epithet and was surely inspired by the group’s experience on the dance-and-rap audition track. “You’re rapping for the white man,” Fatlip spits out. At one point, the guys discussed naming themselves the Jigaboos instead of the Pharcyde. “We just felt like no matter what, when you’re up there on stage you’re definitely being exploited, and you’re definitely lining someone else’s pockets,” Imani told Brian Coleman in his book Check the Technique. Musically, the skit shakes itself to pieces, with brutal piano stabs and cymbal crashes before the final line: “But we’re all jigaboos in our way,” delivered sweetly, like a deranged kindergarten teacher. “So might as well just get paid.” Then it’s back to the show. Simply put, every track plays its part; the skits just as necessary as the songs. If De La Soul’s Prince Paul admired the heart-rendering audio journey that concludes Stevie Wonder’s “Living for the City” for its virtuosity and verisimilitude, the skits on Bizarre Ride succeed because they are absolutely what they appear to be: the pure shenanigans of friends fucking around. Recorded during an hours-long jam session arranged by J-Swift and edited into digestible interludes after the fact, the skits find the guys rethinking the U.S. presidency and improvising a blunted Tin Pan Alley ditty about the impending arrival of their beloved weed dealer, Quinton. It’s “Happy Days Are Here Again” for indica enthusiasts, wedged tightly into the sofa cushions. For an album with so many jokes, it may come as a surprise to learn that in the first days of recording Tre stood in the booth at Hollywood Sound and cried. Suddenly overcome by the enormity of creating an album—“This is gonna exist forever,” he thought—Tre broke down. Granted, he was very high, but still, there’s something important to acknowledge here. Being funny is hard work that can be too easily dismissed, especially in hip-hop. Maybe it’s because the genre has fought for artistic credibility for so long, maybe it’s because of rock-critic values, but “serious” work tends to get the accolades. Bizarre Ride II the Pharcyde is the exception that proves the rule. The early work of Kanye West, so willing to make the corny joke or memorialize a mundane experience like wanting to fight the manager at your lousy job, bears Bizarre Ride’s influence (Kanye once named it his favorite album). What is J. Cole’s “Wet Dreamz” if not a Pharcyde song with less slapstick? Is it not possible to draw a direct line from Fatlip’s deranged prank-call verse on “4 Better or 4 Worse” to Eminem’s murderous fantasies to the first releases from Odd Future? After the album’s release, the group spoke with The Source. “Your album didn’t really have a message, right?” the interviewer began. “There’s lots of hidden, secret messages. You can’t hear them?” Romye replied. It was easy to mistake their jokes for a lack of substance. But on Bizarre Ride, humor was a way of processing anxiety and pain; a tool to show self-deprecation isn’t always the inverse of self-aggrandizement. Like their hero Pryor, it was a way to make themselves the larger-than-life center of attention, to give their struggles and fears their due. Get the Sunday Review in your inbox every weekend.

Be,BTS,by: Dani Blum ,Contributor ,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5fc673840b5a203345b05895/1:1/w_160/be%20(deluxe%20edition)_bts.jpg,2020-12-05 06:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/bts-be/,Big Hit,"You have to at least want to root for BTS. The supergroup’s global dominance has been a rare constant in a year of upheaval, a pulse of pure joy through all this muck. There they are on The Late Late Show With James Corden, handing each other presents while crooning into their hand mics. There they are on TikTok, plopping a bouquet in a hand-lettered vase and offering it to their fans. BTS has broken so many records, at such a frantic pace, that any effort to tally them becomes almost instantly obsolete. Their new album, Be, devotes a full three-minute skit to celebrating the rise of “Dynamite,” their first all-English single, to the top of the Billboard charts. (“Don’t you think this is what happiness is like?” RM asks.) By the time the album itself was released, its first track had also reached the top of the U.S. charts, making BTS the first K-pop group ever to hit No. 1 on the Billboard 100. That level of fame has not come without its costs. As a band—and a brand—that prizes authenticity, BTS haven’t shied away from addressing the tolls of megastardom and growing up in general. They’ve trained their pristine pop machine on sweeping philosophical ideas—the Jungian concept of the soul, a Herman Hesse bildungsroman—with varying degrees of success. On Be, the Bangtan Boys fixate instead on life in quarantine. In a year when profundity is woven into the mundane, when the rote tasks of getting through the day have taken on new intensity, BTS soften and shine. “The entire year got stolen,” Jimin croons in Korean on the shimmering “Fly to My Room,” before the group lilts about lying in bed with a bloated stomach, a pile of takeout containers, and the constant blare of a TV. Frustration and grief animate these songs, but it’s their simplicity and specificity that make them compelling. On “Blue & Grey,” Suga wonders if “that hazy shadow that swallows me up” classifies as anxiety or as depression. “I just want to be happier,” the group cries over delicate, bleeding strings, their voices whittled down to pleading rasps. The record’s thematic center is “Life Goes On,” a flickering prayer for pushing past 2020. Artists have struggled with how to construct a record about self-isolation—Charli XCX opted for the glitch and quiver of How I’m Feeling Now, while Drake danced alone through his massive, frigid house. BTS pluck minutiae from the blur of days trapped inside: “On my pillow, on my table,” they sing, “life goes on.” In the past, BTS have used their songs as vehicles for feel-good messages (“I love, I love, I love myself! I know, I know, I know myself!” they shouted on Wings’ “Cypher 4”); here, they build hope in real time. Each gradual glimmer of layered vocals, every lush harmony that streams over the delicate backbeat, stitches together an intimacy. I kept the song on repeat while I churned through my daily tasks—I pruned my inbox, pushed a Swiffer across my floor. By the seventh or eighth play, I realized I’d been crying. That intricate balance of confession and consolation dissipates later in the album. RM, the group’s unofficial leader, worried that “Life Goes On” would sound “bland,” and other parts of the record try to compensate with aggressive sheen. The raps on “Dis-ease” shuffle over a mellow hip-hop beat, breezy and infectious but flimsy compared to the harder-edged juggernauts of past songs like “UGH!” The neon-drenched “Stay” meanders into middling EDM, with twitchy drum kicks and a siren-like blare; the beats sound like they were ripped from Steve Aoki’s hard drive in 2010. “Stay” ends with a flourish of reverb that glides into the gloss and throb of “Dynamite,” a song that, on its own, achieves slick competency: a jumble of funk and handclaps and eminently palatable one-liners. (“Cup of milk, let’s rock and roll!”) Of course, “Dynamite” also functions as a monument to BTS’ global reach, but to the group, it’s more of a gift to fans. “We call this our own recharge project,” RM told NME about the single, “and we hope that it will be able to recharge your own batteries, even if it’s only for a moment.” That’s part of the fun of BTS—you get the sense that they earnestly want to root for you, too.","The K-pop superstars’ second album of new material in 2020 fixates on the frustration and grief of life in quarantine, sifting through the blurry days to construct a new form of intimacy.

Tripping With Nils Frahm,Nils Frahm,by: Philip Sherburne,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5fc65e841ef00c5e1192c5d5/1:1/w_160/Tripping%20with%20Nils%20Frahm_Nils%20Frahm.jpg,2020-12-04 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/nils-frahm-tripping-with-nils-frahm/,Erased Tapes,"Nils Frahm’s dominant mode is the eyes-closed fantasia: immersive, rapturous, sentimental. That goes for his post-classical solo-piano work, which is indebted to both Keith Jarrett and George Winston, as well as his surging electronic pieces, which translate the grammar of classical minimalism into the language of techno. His music favors fluid lines and wistful melodies; even when it throbs, it prizes beauty, lyricism, and elegance. But on stage, the German musician is also a showman. Surrounded by keyboards and machines—grand piano, upright piano, harmonium, Fender Rhodes, Mellotron, toy piano, Roland Juno-60, Moog Taurus, Roland SH 2, analog drum machines, and tape delay units—he is a mad scientist of MIDI/CV converters, a flat-capped conductor of hammers and pan pots and LEDs. Sculpting sine waves into controlled whirlwinds, he straddles his gear, arms akimbo, lunging from station to station: hammering out Rhodes arpeggios with one hand and toggling sequencer parameters with the other, then shifting to the Yamaha grand in the space of a beat, all while finessing his delay chain, triggering pipe-organ samples, and keeping his drum machines in check. There are moments of stillness, too, but at their peaks, his shows are athletic feats as much as they are opportunities to get lost in sound. Frahm’s showmanship was on full display in December 2018, when he set up at Berlin’s historic Funkhaus—a former East German radio headquarters, where he keeps his own recording studio—for four consecutive nights of performances. He played in the round, a castaway on a small island of gear, by turns manic, melancholy, and mild. Tripping With Nils Frahm, which boils down choice moments from those four nights into a 76-minute album, is more polished than his 2013 live album, Spaces, a compendium of two years of live performances. That collection acknowledged both spontaneity (“Improvisation for Coughs and a Cell Phone”) and the constant possibility of failure (“An Aborted Beginning,” an ambient dub sketch that peters out after 94 seconds), but on the new one, he and his passel of gear are a well-oiled machine. The album, split between delicate solo piano pieces and billowing, groove-driven electronic improvisations, is largely drawn from his 2018 album All Melody and its outtakes collection, All Encores. What might be most surprising is how faithful his live renditions are to the original studio recordings. Without seeing it—something possible in an accompanying concert film, which includes 11 minutes’ worth of extra music—it can be hard to imagine how Frahm manages to do so much with just two hands. In “Sunson,” he juggles slow-motion techno with Mellotron counterpoints, cascading pipe organs, and the occasional Rhodes melody; “Fundamental Values” makes room for ambient pulses, Windham Hill-like piano solo, operatic vocal samples, and a heart-in-mouth climax whose double-time percussion is reminiscent of Autechre’s “Lost.” The crowd-pleasing “All Melody” stretches the original’s nine and a half minutes to more than 14, drawing out the tension inherent in his tumbling arpeggios. Sprawl is par for the course. Five of the album’s eight songs are more than 10 minutes long; “Fundamental Values” takes a four-minute album cut and blows it up to more than 14. The sound throughout is gorgeous. Frahm is serious about his gear—he owns 11 Roland RE-501 Chorus Echoes, and uses five of them on stage—and that obsessiveness translates into truly incredible sound: sumptuous, nuanced, enveloping. He favors instruments with striking visceral sonorities, and he knows how to get the most out of the contrast between them. Some of the album’s most electrifying moments happen when he turns the sampled sounds of a pipe organ into an icy cascade of staccato tone bursts. But a nagging sense of sameness nevertheless settles in over the course of the record. “All Melody” and “#2” amount to a 25-minute set of theme and variations; the arpeggios and steady pulse of “Sunson” feel cut from the same cloth, and “Fundamental Values” reprises ideas from all three. The album’s most rewarding stretch is “My Friend the Forest” and “The Dane,” a pair of related solo piano pieces where he strips away the bells and whistles and lets his harmonic sensibilities shine. Even here, though, Frahm’s fondness for ornament occasionally gets the better of him. Where “My Friend the Forest” is spare and patient, his soloing in “The Dane” turns cloying. There’s an occasionally claustrophobic air of deep feeling in his neo-romantic melodies. Pushing forward in needling eighth-note phrases, his solos can be a little too insistent, his cadenzas too lily-gilding. Listeners suspicious of overt emotional cues might find these portions of his music manipulative in their insistence upon feeling just one type of way. The album’s loveliest moment is its simplest: The closing “Ode - Our Own Roof” is spare and delicate, like snowfall under a single streetlamp. Dialing back some of the excess—and the seriousness—might go a long way toward letting Frahm’s music breathe. In a 2016 interview with The Guardian, Frahm cited the influence of Andy Kaufman, the consummate showman, and espoused the musical properties of the $1 Ikea toilet scrubber. In the concert film, there’s a brief interlude where Frahm uses just such a pair of white plastic brushes on the inside of the concert grand: drumming on the struts and the strings, eking out a booming rhythm before a tongue-in-cheek finale of bristles scratchy-scratching against mic heads. To be sure, this is Frahm in peak entertainer mode, but in sonic terms, it’s also a welcome contrast—an acknowledgement that there are sensations beyond reverie; that even rhapsody requires the occasional reprieve.","Recorded at Berlin’s historic Funkhaus in 2018, this live album sounds uniformly gorgeous and features the composer and his passel of gear working dutifully as a well-oiled machine.

AYA,Aya Nakamura,by: Shamira Ibrahim,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5fc6661ee7768c95569906d5/1:1/w_160/aya_aya%20nakamura.jpg,2020-12-04 06:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/aya-nakamura-aya/,Rec.118Warner France,"Since catapulting to the top of the French charts, multi-platinum Malian-born artist Aya Danioko has been given countless labels. In one breath, she is abbreviated as an Afro-pop artist, the next bundled into France’s robust and increasingly populous rap scene, teeming with talent from Paris to Marseille. Her success has frequently been minimized as a novelty act, despite being the most listened-to contemporary French act in the world. Her international smash hit “Djadja”—from her sublime second album, 2018’s Nakamura—placed her on a feminist pedestal she was reluctant to embrace. Her detractors looked at her unflappable demeanor as a tall dark-skinned woman, churning out hit after hit in France’s cis-male dominated music industry, and pegged her as overly cocksure. The clearest signal in the noise, however, lies in the labels she gives herself, indicating her creative essence long before she became a mainstay on Spotify. Her performing surname, Nakamura, comes from the character Hiro Nakamura of the superhero series Heroes; a warrior who, through sheer force of will, can bend space and time, transporting himself to different worlds. This has been Aya’s superpower since the days of her 2017 debut Journal Intime—playing with the universes of not just Afrobeats, but zouk, R&B, and pop to layer in her penetrating musings on life, love, and freedom. Aya has a challenging act to follow; it seems nearly unfathomable to eclipse the cultural phenomenon of “Djadja.” The Aulnay-sous-Bois-raised chanteuse rose to the occasion, however, masterfully employing l’argot, or French slang, as she shifts through her various modalities of defiance, softness, and matters of the heart to create a cohesive, intimate experience. Aya is the sound of a young woman and mother who has found the love she deserves and is embracing it unreservedly. The most explicit Afrobeats flair takes center stage with the tracks “La Machine” and “Doudou” (an kreyòl term for honey/boo). In the former, it is the crisp and commanding lyricism that makes the track so enjoyable, layered over production that harkens back to the spellbinding era early 2010s Wizkid; the latter reunites Aya with Parisian producers Le Side (“Djadja”, “Pookie”) for a sensual and forthright single that seems tailor-made for a Burna Boy remix. The notion of him doing a romantic French verse in response to the enticingly delivered “parle en français, sois clair” would seemingly do wonders for accelerating a bridge to a frequently misunderstood market of the French urban music scene. But as Nakamura has stated repeatedly, anglophone acknowledgment is not her concern. As it stands, the two English features on the album—Stormzy and Ms. Banks—are used sparingly and judiciously, with the latter providing the greater punch on the sweetly delivered “Mon Lossa.” As in her previous projects, Aya flexes her melodic muscle in other genres. “Fly,” while in need of some refinement in execution around the hook, contains the same spirited airiness of a Dangerous Woman-era Ariana Grande ballad; “Plus jamais” (Never Again), despite Stormzy’s muted presence, is an R&B track at its core, the English version of which would find a perfect home in a Kehlani project. She shares the fear and intensity of falling in love, likening the pleasure of succumbing to it to a religious experience in “Nirvana”; the liberal use of Mashallah in a time when France is being challenged on the world stage for Islamophobic and racially heightened social contexts does not go unnoticed. Just two tracks later, she partners with Franco-Malagasy rapper Oboy for the erotic “Préféré”—and therein lies the magic of Aya, or La Nakamurance. She will juxtapose her faith with a sexual liaison, dismiss wastemen while fantasizing about the traditional weddings that she had seen growing up in her West African community, and revive and transform a beloved mid-aughts zouk certified hood classic from a Franco-Comorian songwriter (“Sentiments Grandissants”) without hesitation. The efforts may not always land, but she approaches each layer with sincerity—and the successful conjugations are transcendent experiences, greater than their individual parts. While some members of the French establishment may look askance at her heavy use of argot, she remains dominant, with a cultural penetration that hasn’t emerged from a woman in France since the days of Edith Piaf. Nakamura may be a self-designation, but she is indeed a superhero of sorts; informed by the line of griottes in her maternal Malian heritage, fearlessly genre-bending, shunning the unspoken limitations of genre labels. Like Piaf, Aya “ne regrette rien”—her musical fingerprint is an intimate portrait not just of her life, but the interplay of dominant sounds from the African and West Indian communities in France and how well she can slide between them, both in lingo and melody.  These compositions are what make her music most successful to her longtime fans—a zouk percussion line throbs under refrains that seamlessly flow between R&B and more potent Afropop intonations, as is the case with the deliciously sharp “Tchop” (Whip), and may even inject a classic kompa synth beat for some gouyad (as on the waning moments of “Préféré”). The young woman from 93eme is exposing the world to the France that she knows and hears, in prose and tempo, with every new stream. That is a level of cultural currency that far outweighs a new Times Square billboard—although it would be well served for the rest of the Western musical vanguard to come along for the ride.","On her third album, the French-Malian singer artfully slides between lingo and genres—Afrobeats, zouk, R&B—to create a far-reaching pop experience about life, love, and freedom.

New Vanitas,William Tyler,by: Nathan Smith,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5fc694880aaaf18ca0286f2a/1:1/w_160/New%20Vanitas_William%20Tyler.jpg,2020-12-04 06:00:00,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/william-tyler-new-vanitas/,Merge,"During the late Renaissance period, a style arose among Dutch and Flemish painters called the “vanitas,” a sort of memento mori that foregrounds the inevitability and absurdity of human mortality. Usually still lifes, these paintings sardonically collapse symbols of decadent lives and grim deaths into a single, grotesque image: a skull surrounded by precious jewels and goblets of wine, flowers that will eventually decay among human remains that already have. The idea of life and death, co-existing as one experience, is the defining principle of New Vanitas, a new EP released with minimal fanfare by instrumental guitarist William Tyler in September. Vanitas as a concept speaks directly to 2020, a year defined by the collective whiplash of attempting to process staggering death and unforeseen catastrophe while still being forced to carry on with much of life “as usual.” Though not a quarantine album per se, New Vanitas was shaped by and inevitably reflects the uncertain conditions of the times. The project is the result of Tyler’s return home to his native Nashville during the pandemic, of looking inward, sifting through childhood memories, and stripping back to essentials. The musical vocabulary he pulls from—both stylistically and sometimes literally, with samples of radio monologues broadcast to no one in particular and intense feedback on tracks like “With News From Heaven”—owes more to avant-garde esoterica than his previous records. His inspirations are as much about the materiality and texture of sound as the actual content: He cites “old cassettes, slightly warped records, nature recordings, southern Protestant hymns of childhood, homemade music.” As Tyler’s work complicates and develops, it has moved further away from something resembling instrumental Americana and toward ambient soundscape, closer to the KLF’s Chill Out than the post-country noodlings of Lambchop. Tyler has long been a confident and skilled multi-instrumentalist, but with New Vanitas he comes into his own as a composer and designer of sound. This year’s Music From First Cow was Tyler’s most Spartan effort, a work defined by silence and pauses as much as by notes, and New Vanitas continues to explore sparseness. In Tyler’s hands, it’s not just the guitar that lives and breathes, but every string; his playing imbues each strum on songs like “Big Sky Waltz” with a unique interiority. There are still traces of melody, like the light percussive pattern on “Four Corners” that turns it into a shuffling slow dance, but New Vanitas is Tyler at his most meditative. The EP reaches an apex with “Slow Night’s Static,” a 12-minute tone poem that dissolves sustained notes and snatches of radio chatter into a single, swirling pool of sound. “Pisces Backroads,” the final track, is a purifying, euphoric drone, a ceaseless build of sensation. Static seeps out of the margins of the composition and soon envelops the whole. In a written reflection accompanying the EP’s release, Tyler credits filmmaker Kelly Reichardt as an essential component of his artistic evolution. During their collaboration on the First Cow soundtrack, Tyler writes, “She challenged me to confront some of my own melodic and compositional tendencies towards, as she put it, sentimentality: ‘Don’t tell people how to feel with this. Be open to the moment.’” Though Tyler’s music reaches beyond clear boundaries of genre or traditional songwriting, his music has in the past been undergirded by a sense of sweeping melodrama—an emotional narrative expressed even in the absence of lyrics. The songs on New Vanitas don’t tell stories as much as they mutate and unfold naturally. Vanitas paintings express the impermanence and temporality of human existence, a theme Tyler explores in his turn away from standard melodies: No note is stable, because each fluctuates and abstracts itself the longer you hold it, constantly becoming something new. When life may feel more unsteady than ever, New Vanitas seeks peace in uncertainty, drawing a blurry horizon line by which to anchor yourself.","As the instrumental guitarist’s work develops, it has moved further away from something resembling instrumental Americana and toward ambient soundscape.

Just Dropped In (To See What Condition My Rendition Was In),Sharon Jones and the Dap-Kings,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5fc5442f185e07a43aad7b50/1:1/w_160/Just%20Dropped%20In%20(To%20See%20What%20Condition%20My%20Rendition%20Was%20In)%20(by%20Sharon%20Jones%20&%20The%20Dap-Kings)%20.jpg,2020-12-03 06:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/sharon-jones-and-the-dap-kings-just-dropped-in-to-see-what-condition-my-rendition-was-in/,Daptone,"In 2002, Sharon Jones and Daptone Records co-founder/bandleader Bosco Mann claimed that they were suing Janet Jackson over the song “What Have You Done for Me Lately.” The label issued a press release accusing Jackson of copyright violation and alleging that her 1986 hit single was actually written in 1969 by Jones and Mann: “The original recording, ‘a much raunchier version,’ had been only a regional hit on the soul scene in the early seventies and had fallen into relative obscurity by the time Jackson had recorded her pop version fifteen years later.” It just so happened that Daptone was selling a 7"" single with Jones’ version on the A-side and the Dap-Kings’ instrumental on the B, both of which are convincing in their analog production and gritty groove. Never mind that Mann (aka Gabriel Roth) was born several years after he allegedly co-wrote the song. The name of the law firm—Dewey Cheatham—revealed the whole thing to be a clever hoax engineered to promote the single, taken from Daptone’s first full-length release, Dap-Dippin’ with Sharon Jones & the Dap-Kings. Nearly 20 years later, their cover of Jackson’s hit is less significant for how it sounds than for the way it pitched Jones as an artist removed from time and wronged by the music industry. Which wasn’t too far from the truth: Jones, who died of pancreatic cancer in 2016, had been working day jobs and singing in wedding bands for decades before making her recording debut (singing backup for Lee Fields) in the mid 1990s. She brought to that session, just as she would to Daptone, a stylistic approach and set of techniques from another era, and Jones spent the rest of her life not just defining retro soul for a new generation, but defying the retro part of that label. Covers were always a significant part of Jones’ repertoire, a means of connecting her to the past and also linking the past to the present, and that gives Just Dropped In (To See What Condition My Rendition Was In) the weight of a career retrospective. It might even reveal more about Jones than a greatest-hits collection would, emphasizing her decisions about which songs to sing and how to sing them. She had remarkable range vocally and stylistically. While her take on “What Have You Done for Me Lately” ultimately sounds uncharacteristically tentative, turning Jackson’s icy staccato into a rhythmically limp hook, she had more luck with subsequent covers, navigating established soul classics and usually holding her own against the originals. She conveys a sense of staunch determination on Fontella Bass’s “Rescue Me,” as though she’s not the one who needs saving. And she strips the breathless singing and lush production from the Marvelettes’ “Here I Am Baby,” replacing them with a rawer vocal and a sinewy guitar groove. It sounds like you’re sitting in their practice space with them. But the non-R&B covers—the songs that make her and her band push themselves—are more daring and perhaps more satisfying, in particular “This Land Is Your Land” (included on the digital version but not the vinyl). Originally released as the B-side of her 2004 single “What If We All Stopped Paying Taxes?,” it’s become one of her signature tunes, a work of democratic funk conveying both patriotic pride and civic outrage, especially when she gets to the verses typically omitted from Woody Guthrie’s song. Less popular but just as powerful is her reimagining of the Wailers’ deep cut “It Hurts to Be Alone.” (Often credited to Bob Marley, it was written and originally sung by Junior Braithwaite.) The Dap-Kings wisely downplay the Trenchtown pulse and teen romanticism of the original, giving it a loose, late-night sway to match the adult regret and restraint in Jones’ voice. Just Dropped In similarly reveals much about the business of being in a band and running a label—like how Jones and Daptone supplemented their albums and tours with extracurricular projects. Many of these covers weren’t chosen by the band, but commissioned. The band recorded Stevie Wonder’s “Signed Sealed Delivered I’m Yours” for a bank commercial, and their reading is straightforward right down to the electric sitar. Similarly, they did a note-for-note cover of Gladys Knight & the Pips’ 1964 single “Giving Up” to use as a Dr. Dre sample, although it was ultimately discarded. These songs sound a bit too faithful to the originals, and you wonder what the band could have done with them if they’d been given more freedom to cut loose or open them up to other possibilities. Seven years and innumerable shows after the Janet Jackson hoax, Jones recorded another iconic hit by another idiosyncratic ’80s artist. Punchy and provocative, her cover of “Take Me With U” was a standout on Spin magazine’s 2009 Prince tribute Purplish Rain, showcasing what sounds like a completely different band. They drive it like they stole it, adding a sharp guitar motif to frame the action and a corkscrew baritone sax riff to push the song along at a frenzied clip. There’s nothing tentative about Jones’ performance, which is forceful and agile as she navigates the tricky rhythms, and her delivery of the line “you’re sheer perfection” nearly out-raunches the song’s auteur. It doesn’t have all the baggage of previous covers, but it stands out for the sheer joy they take in upending pop history.","A collection of the late soul singer’s covers of songs by Janet Jackson, Prince, and others reveals her remarkable ability to reinterpret classic sounds while refusing to be relegated to the past.

Strum & Thrum: The American Jangle Underground 1983 - 1987,Various Artists,by: Dave Segal,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5fbd88cf96ab91ca523e27c0/1:1/w_160/Strum%20&%20Thrum-%20The%20American%20Jangle%20Underground%201983%20-%201987.jpg,2020-12-03 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/various-artists-strum-and-thrum-the-american-jangle-underground-1983-1987/,Captured Tracks,"If you spent your formative years reading zines such as The Big Takeover and Puncture, you may experience a Proustian tingle while perusing the tracklist for Strum & Thrum: The American Jangle Underground 1983-1987. It’s the inaugural release in Captured Tracks’ Excavations series, a set of compilations highlighting music from the 1970s through the 1990s that influenced the label’s roster. To give you an idea of the underdog status represented, cerebral Homestead Records stalwarts Salem 66 are probably the comp’s best-known act. At a time when Sonic Youth were imploring people to “Kill Yr Idols,” Strum & Thrum’s musicians were emulating them: They drew sustenance from the Byrds’ radiant Rickerbacker tones; the spare, poignant intro to the Velvet Underground’s “Heroin”; and early R.E.M.’s rambling approximations of Roger McGuinn’s guitar sound. Post-punk and no wave are nowhere to be heard in their orderly compositions. These groups almost uniformly privilege the guitar, and rarely do they disrupt a steady beat—although Start deviate from the prevalent 4/4 and Sex Clark Five dabble with quasi-prog-rock chord progressions and tempo switches. The stylistic niche plowed by most of the 28 acts here is narrow and, culturally and aesthetically, white. Not a scintilla of blues, funk, soul, jazz, or dub exists in these prototypical indie-rock songs. (The main points of Sasha Frere-Jones’s 2007 essay “A Paler Shade of White”—namely, that ’00s indie rock was defined in no small part by its aversion to the rhythmic expressions of mid-20th century, African-American popular music—could apply to Strum & Thrum.) Music historian (and former Matador general manager) Johan Kugelberg regards the era documented here as American indie rock’s “Dark Ages.” Nevertheless, vibrant scenes were sprouting in college towns and small cities. Captured Tracks has dug deep to find gems from those microcosms. Luckily for these artists scorned by major labels and commercial radio, the college-radio infrastructure was burgeoning, connecting their smart, concisely constructed rock with students and zine-readers nationwide. The uninitiated, and those not alive during Reagan’s bleak reign, can learn much from Strum & Thrum about this stratum of sensitive-person rock. The deities to which the majority of the comp’s artists genuflect are the Byrds and R.E.M., with occasional nods to the Smiths and Scottish label Postcard’s roster (Aztec Camera, the Go-Betweens). A substantial chunk of the album sounds like outtakes from Chronic Town and Murmur: For instance, the staccato rock of Holiday’s “Change” is essentially R.E.M.’s “1,000,000,” but with vocals influenced by the vivacious delivery of Kate Pierson, of the B-52’s. Strum & Thrum wholeheartedly champions verse-chorus-verse song structures, with no extravagant solos and few deviations from standard rock instrumentation. With sonic innovation and political commentary off the table, these bands focused on writing catchy melodies, wittily rendering romantic entanglements and youthful musings, and generating those all-important guitar tones—the “jangle” and its close kin, the “chime.” The radiant timbres here generally signify innocent wonder and indomitable joy, despite the chronic threat of nuclear war fostered by American and Soviet leaders. Columbus, Ohio’s Great Plains slaughter doom with “When Do You Say Hello?,” a song so jittery it makes the Modern Lovers’ “Roadrunner” seem like it’s in first gear. The Ferrets mine party-starting gold with “She Was Unkind,” which audaciously fuses riffs from the Byrds’ “Mr. Tambourine Man” and the Kinks’ “She’s Got Everything.” The Springfields’ Sunflower” attains a peak of Rickenbacker bliss via a fey paean to nature that could make Brian Wilson sigh. Some of the more interesting songs here skew darker, including “Seven Steps Down,” by Salem 66, a Boston group, founded by three women, that crafted some of the most alluring hooks of the ’80s underground yet never transcended cult status. You can hear seeds of Helium and Liz Phair in their surprising dynamics and bewitching earworms. The modestly triumphant 28th Day rocker “Pages Turn (Alternate Version)” offers an early example of Barbara Manning’s ingenious songwriting and poignant vocals. On Riff Doctors’ “Say Goodbye,” singer Donna Esposito expresses the bittersweet feeling of liberation after a soured relationship, but the music radiates a restrained elation, a trick also perfected by the Smiths. The most rhythmically robust song here, Absolutely Grey’s “Remorse” is an emotional roller coaster in which Beth Brown sings, “I feel a bit remorseful now that you’re dead/But no more darkness in your head” like a female Gordon Lightfoot, her mossy tone catching with overwhelming emotion. Taking cues from reissue specialist labels such as Numero Group and Soul Jazz, Captured Tracks has unearthed deep cuts from a stratum of rock that’s been swathed in apathy for over three decades and puts them into context. While it might be a stretch to say that Strum & Thrum’s artists influenced many of today’s indie rockers, it nevertheless represents a vault full of potential holy grails for fans of, say, Car Seat Headrest or Cloud Nothings. Captured Tracks owner Mike Sniper wants Strum & Thrum to prove that America’s ’80s underground rock bands merit the same respect as those from their more heralded British and New Zealand counterparts on labels such as Creation and Flying Nun. That’s a tall order, but even if he hasn’t quite succeeded, Strum & Thrum does an admirable job casting some much-needed light on those “Dark Ages” of American indie.","The inaugural release in a new Captured Tracks compilation series surveys a generation of college-rock bands that drew sustenance from the chiming guitars of R.E.M. and the Byrds.

Mamalarky,Mamalarky,by: Jesse Locke,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5fc577ff0c67c3f1e7b1cd95/1:1/w_160/mamalarky_mamalarky.jpg,2020-12-03 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/mamalarky-mamalarky/,Fire Talk,"Mamalarky’s tenderly tangled indie rock has the internal logic of ridiculous jokes shared between band members after spending weeks on the road together. The young Atlanta-based quartet’s touring plans were curtailed like everyone else’s in 2020, but they’ve had more than enough time in each other’s company to develop an idiosyncratic musical language. The sum of friendships and collaborations dating back to their teenage years, the band’s debut album melds flashy instrumental moves with head-sticking hooks and lovesick lyrics welcoming anyone into their private world. Singer/guitarist Livvy Bennett met drummer Dylan Hill on the first day of middle school in their hometown of Austin, and they joined forces with keyboardist Michael Hunter (a member of shaggy rock revivalists White Denim) in 2016, first calling themselves the Wipeout Gang before settling on Mamalarky—a name they have jokingly mocked for its similarities to a Joe Biden catchphrase. The band’s 2018 debut EP, Fundamental Thrive Hive, shows slightly less restraint than their debut album, with Hunter’s synth flourishes veering towards zany, but the foundations of their sound were already in place. During a stint in Los Angeles while Bennett joined alt-rockers Cherry Glazerr, bassist Noor Khan entered Mamalarky’s orbit after they put out a call for musicians on Tinder. Swiping right proved to be the correct decision, as they leveled up into a tightly stitched prog-pop unit. While Mamalarky are ostensibly an indie-pop group, they stand out from the laid-back melancholy moods of contemporaries like Soccer Mommy or (Sandy) Alex G with complex instrumental interplay that inspires lean-forward listening. Whether tearing into the album’s fast-paced songs or swaying through its quiet numbers, Hill is rarely content to play a simple backbeat, punctuating stop-start rhythms with splashy fills like exclamation marks in the middle of a sentence. Basslines bob in lockstep with the guitar’s rapid zigzags, and Hunter paints with splatters of synth in moments like the dazzling conclusion of “Cosine.” On Mamalarky’s most energetic rippers, “Fury” and “Schism Trek,” they sound as frenzied as Deerhoof, while the simple and affecting “You Make Me Smile” recalls the understated arrangements of that band’s former guitarist, Chris Cohen. Bennett’s vocals hold down the melodic structure of Mamalarky’s various approaches, with a sardonic chanted delivery on “Drug Store Model” or a soft lilt through “Hero.” She repeatedly evokes feelings of fleeting romance, from the sweet reminders of “You Make Me Smile” to the sweaty sheets of “Almighty Heat.” This falls apart on “Schism Trek,” when someone’s absence painfully takes over her imagination: “You are my muse, you are my crush/I sit and think of you too much.” With the exception of tossed-off references to “the Hilton and Bill Clinton” midway through “Fury,” her lyrics avoid the world outside her head, and even then sound years removed from current events. With this much creativity, it’s unfortunate that the band falls into predictable patterns on wordless bridges or codas that start to feel samey after 10 songs. The spidery instrumental “Singalong,” on the other hand, is a smart sequencing choice to mix up the album’s flow, while “Big Trouble” has the most notable tweaks to their formula. Its warbling sound matches the look of the group’s charming lo-fi videos as they swap out choruses with affirmative shouts and gleefully messy guitar solos. In unexpected moments like these, Mamamlarky sound like they’re capable of inventing a new musical dialect altogether.","The Atlanta indie-rock quartet’s debut album stands out from their contemporaries’ laid-back melancholy with complex instrumental interplay that inspires lean-forward listening.

Spilligion,Spillage Village,by: Pete Tosiello,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5fc57961d4d3a13a6758a326/1:1/w_160/Spilligion_Spillage%20Village.jpg,2020-12-03 06:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/spillage-village-spilligion/,DreamvilleSinceThe80sInterscope,"Familiarity is both a blessing and a crutch for Spillage Village, a collective of vocalists and producers steeped in the folklore of Atlanta’s most prestigious rap acts. Their latest album Spilligion is a polished record full of rumbling basslines, posse cuts, and gospel interludes, with songs assuming loose themes of love, faith, family, and weed. The rappers spin yarns of fellowship and strife, like wayfarers commiserating around a campfire—a style reminiscent of Goodie Mob, OutKast, and blues stretching back some 200 years. Still, at times, the familiarity functions as shorthand; their success is hinged largely on whether devotees of Aquemini and Still Standing feel like making room in their disc-changers for a crew of next-gen disciples. Spillage Village seems to understand what makes Dungeon Family transcendent, that their essence can’t be condensed to a vibe. But viewed through the prism of a Dreamville Records project, Spilligion can be representative of the label’s reductive homages. J. Cole has bankrolled a slew of underappreciated revival acts, including Spillage members EarthGang and J.I.D—both of whom released strong full-lengths upon signing to the label in 2017. That fall, Charlotte rapper Lute, another adherent of Dungeon Family’s blunted rumination, delivered the excellent West 1996 Pt. 2 to little fanfare. While Spilligion adheres to Dreamville’s reverent aesthetic, Cole’s long-running attempts to compress the most intricate elements of hip-hop’s turn-of-the-century blockbusters are evident in his protégés’ work. Ambiance does most of Spilligion’s heavy lifting. Most of the tracks have multiple production credits, usually a combination of in-house producers Hollywood JB, Christo, Olu, and Benji. Their subterranean rhythms, bright guitar chords, and funky digressions recall Organized Noize not only in the abstract but also in their structural subtleties. On “Mecca,” the high percussion assumes the foreground, the background instrumentals slinking left to right in stereo. The danceable groove of “Cupid” ends with a jazzy keyboard outro, the programmed drums nimbly switched out for a live set. Big Rube, the spoken-word standby of Dungeon Family projects since Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik, appears not once but twice on Spilligion. “PsalmSing” and “Shiva” have hooks that take advantage of Spillage’s varied personnel, who each chime in with enveloping harmonies. Mereba, a prodigious neo-soul singer who also raps with icy precision, is Spilligion’s breakout star, her voice threaded through the soaring choruses. The album’s most jaw-dropping moment—and there are several—is the outro “Jupiter,” on which the assembled believers make merry in spite of an uncertain future: “So hold my hands and dance with me tonight/You know they say we’re all about to die.” It’s a moment of rapturous if fleeting contentment. Still, there’s a tonal indistinctness that dulls the highs on an album that’s nominally about religion. Contrasted with Dungeon Family’s backwoods mysticism, Spilligion’s down-home Christianity limits its depth and thematic heft, and the verses can feel a bit paint-by-numbers when bookended by such sharp hooks. On “Ea’alah (Family),” which advocates interspersing prayer with smoke breaks, J.I.D bursts with gratitude: “Let me look into the sun, ’cause I don’t got no occupation/You can say I came from nothin’ but I found my destination.” Later in the song, Olu tackles the coronavirus pandemic: “I don’t mean to bother you, well yeah, I kinda do/See, we’ve been wrestlin’ with this nasty plague that’s kinda like the flu.” (It isn’t.) The brightness isn’t offputting, but it’s a long way from, say, Soul Food, an album about four young men surveying their earthly lots and invoking a God who didn’t always seem to love them back. Once you’re convinced of your own absolution, you don’t need to wander the desert looking for it. Longtime Spillage member J.I.D is one of rap’s feel-good stories, an industrious veteran who transformed himself into a technical marvel through sheer will. A master of breath control and syllable placement, his erratically pitched vocals embolden his rhyme schemes, and Spilligion shows he’s equally adept at carrying a tune. He’s still coming into his own: his verse on “Baptize” (“She said it’s cold inside, that water made her nipples hard/That’s that liquor talkin’, sippin’ gin and readin’ the book of Genesis just before”) reflects the lustiness and overtaxed semantics of a J. Cole tangent, and at times his inflection is indistinguishable from Kendrick Lamar’s. EarthGang’s Olu and WowGr8, for their part, have worked to avoid the fate of Nappy Roots and Big K.R.I.T.—genre artists who recognized their market position and rapped prolifically about grits and Eldorados over banjos and harmonicas. Rapping in animated fusillades, EarthGang’s deviation between conversational deliveries and idiosyncratic singing evokes Stankonia-era André 3000, and their scope has increased as they’ve refined their mechanics. For all its strengths, though, Spilligion sounds telegraphed in comparison to 2019’s Mirrorland, their elaborate world-building diminished by the big-group setting. When J.I.D and the other Spillagers assume frontman duties, as on “Judas,” the project’s vibrant theatrics and space-age symbolism are most conspicuously absent. If there’s one thing the extended Spillage family shares, it’s an intense devotion to craft, which makes Spilligion an achievement. The absorbing full-length is a testament to the octet’s infectious spirit and remarkable technique. But even if no one expects Spillage to replicate “Inshallah” or “7th Floor/The Serengetti,” the miracle of Dungeon Family lay in their audacity to journey without a map. Like any camp revival, Spilligion offers a raucous, affirming experience that leaves you craving a deliverance you’d already sought.","The octet’s latest group project, full of vibrant theatrics and polished posse cuts, is at times representative of Dreamville Records’ reductive homages.

Plastic Hearts,Miley Cyrus,by: Shaad D’Souza,Contributor ,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5fbd8520dcf8ebd9e69c4004/1:1/w_160/Plastic%20Hearts_Miley%20Cyrus.jpg,2020-12-02 06:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/miley-cyrus-plastic-hearts/,RCA,"For the better part of a decade, Miley Cyrus has been an avatar for entertainment capitalism’s most insidious processes. She is a living embodiment of the child-star-to-tabloid-fixture pipeline, and typifies the music industry’s fondness for adopting the aesthetics of rap music as a way of courting clicks as much as she does its tendency to disavow the genre as “materialist” as a way of virtue-signaling. Her music is inexorable from social media, both in the frenetic, real-time updates of its visual style and its tendency to spark loud, mindless discourse. She has been canceled and revived more than pretty much any other star, save, perhaps, Justin Bieber. Provocative, talented but directionless, passionate but confused in her politics, she is a star for whom headlines have almost always outweighed output. Although Cyrus’ various musical projects have rarely been good, a few have been, at the very least, historically significant. Focus exclusively on the drama and it’d be easy to forget that the three-year period of Cyrus’ output that yielded 2013’s Mike WiLL Made-It-produced Bangerz and 2015’s Flaming Lips collaboration Miley Cyrus and Her Dead Petz was one of the most intriguingly bizarre pop eras of the past decade, throwing a spanner into a fairly staid, Max Martin-run commercial landscape and making discourse around thoughtless co-opting of Black art accessible and understandable to a new generation of pop fans. In the years since, Cyrus has attempted to outrun that glittery, twerk-heavy chapter of her career. In 2017, she pivoted to back-to-basics country-pop with the painfully dull Younger Now, before, with little explanation or contrition, returning to the rap sound that had defined her Bangerz era on the 2019 EP She Is Coming, the first installment of a planned trilogy that replaced the former record’s freewheeling joy with a cursory nod to GothBoiClique-style emo rap and a typically inane guest verse from RuPaul. Both projects were relative commercial failures, attempts at image rehabilitation that instead removed a once-inescapable star from the conversation entirely. Before Cyrus could release the sequels to She Is Coming, her life was upended, the vast majority of her new album destroyed in the Woolsey wildfire, and her decade-long relationship with actor Liam Hemsworth ending in a messy, highly-publicized divorce. In the wake of the split, Cyrus reset, scrapping her two unreleased EPs and pursuing a darker, classic rock-indebted sound. In August of this year, she released “Midnight Sky,” a cocaine-dusted disco track that addressed her divorce and subsequent high-profile flings in a surprisingly mature way. In the months following “Midnight Sky”’s release, Cyrus attempted to back up her newly conjured goodwill not through the release of more singles, but through heartbroken covers of Blondie, the Cranberries, and more. The writing on the wall was clear: Miley’s “rock era” had begun. Plastic Hearts is not without precedent: Cyrus has been playing covers of the Smiths and Bob Dylan for unsuspecting audiences since her Bangerz tour, and, although a little reverential, her recent run of covers was enjoyable and endearing, a transparent attempt at proving her classic rock bona fides. Cyrus’ covers of “Heart of Glass” and “Zombie” are tacked on to the end of some versions of the record, almost like a gesture of goodwill, but there was little need: Plastic Hearts is a genuinely pleasing pop-rock record that, through a handful of canny stylistic and lyrical choices, staves off the awkwardness and missteps that plagued her previous albums. Although the album artwork—shot by famed rock photog Mick Rock—and the “Heart of Glass” cover would seem to point towards a certain strain of classic rock revival, Plastic Hearts is a stylistic grab bag. Running the gamut from modern radio rock to industrial pop to new wave, Plastic Hearts is unified not by Cyrus’ commitment to any particular era, but to her cosplay as a kind of iconic rock siren lost to the annals of time: Were the production a little less clean, you might be able to pass this off as the greatest hits of a Top of the Pops-era rock diva. Cyrus’ voice, lower and more guttural than it had ever sounded, was the focal point of those covers, and Plastic Hearts makes clear why: her sandpapery alto has never sounded more natural. Try as she might, Cyrus can’t really rap, and Younger Now made it abundantly clear that Nashville isn’t her calling. Here, she tries on a handful of different styles, and each one works immaculately: Her rasp induces chills on the stadium ballads “Angels Like You” and “Never Be Me,” out-Billy Idols Billy Idol on the “White Wedding” remake “Night Crawling,” and pays homage to “Edge of Seventeen” without cowering in its shadow on “Midnight Sky.” The bulk of the melodies here are gilded and soaring, and she’s never forced to work her tongue around a clunky, focus-tested quasi-rap lyric like “Hallelujah, I’m a freak/I’m a freak, hallelujah/Every week I’mma do ya.” Lyrically, Plastic Hearts is still vintage Miley, albeit with the edges sharpened: songs about fame and love and being a little too fucked up, whether chemically or emotionally. There’s a thread of unfiltered honesty that positions the album as an emotional twin to Bangerz; that record, beyond the twerking, was largely about Cyrus’ devotion to Hemsworth, opening with what was essentially a marriage proposal and ending with a recitation of Corinthians 13:4, exploring the stresses and caveats of eternal love throughout. A couple of songs here play as if in direct conversation with songs from that record, an older, divorced Cyrus more eloquently echoing realizations she was only beginning to acknowledge seven years ago. Those only dipping into the beginning of the record will be stung by some of the album’s most hamfisted cuts. “WTF Do I Know,” with its confused provocations (“I’m the type to drive a pickup through your mansion”) and clean, propulsive 2000s rock chorus, plays more P!nk than Pink Floyd, while the staccato hook and showtune-y bounce of “Plastic Hearts” unearth repressed memories of Fall Out Boy’s Infinity on High. A lot of these songs sound like the canned, Muzak versions of rock songs thanks to the production by Louis Bell and Watt, hitmakers generally associated with top-tier pop artists like Camila Cabello and Post Malone. Still, the various successes of Plastic Hearts make you wonder what Cyrus would sound like if paired with someone like Jonathan Rado—who has helmed classic-sounding records by the Killers and Tim Heidecker, as well as past albums by Weyes Blood and Whitney—or Ariel Rechtshaid, who produced Haim’s Women In Music, Pt. III with Danielle Haim and Rostam. More than anything, Plastic Hearts raises questions like this, in the process highlighting a potential future career path: What if Miley Cyrus became an actual rock star? When Cyrus reunites with past collaborators Mark Ronson—with whom she made the 2018 country-disco stomper “Nothing Breaks Like a Heart”—and Andrew Wyatt, the results are thoughtful and surprising. The country-adjacent ballad “High,” one of a handful of future karaoke classics on the album, contains some of Cyrus’ most beautiful lyrics: “You, like a rolling stone, always building cities on the hearts you broke,” she sings, the crags in her voice given space to resonate, rather than erased. A line like “I don’t miss you, but I think of you and don’t know why” might seem simple, but it’s honest and heartbreaking. Best of all is “Bad Karma,” a raucous slow-build of a song featuring Joan Jett on vocals and Angel Olsen on guitar. Snot-nosed and silly, it’s a high-camp panto of ’80s hard rock, finding Cyrus and Jett trading one-liners—“I’ve always picked a giver ’cause I’ve always been the taker,” goes the delirious chorus—over one of the record’s few live drum tracks. It’s strange, outsized fun, and a glorious example of what Cyrus can do when she lightly plays with her own self-image. The most interesting, and most complicated moment is saved for last. On “Golden G String” Cyrus attempts to show some kind of contrition for her mid-2010s antics: I was tryin’ to own my power
Still I’m tryin’ to work it out
And at least it gives the paper somethin’ they can write about
And oh, that’s just the world that we’re livin’ in
The old boys hold all the cards, and they ain’t playin’ gin It’s an intriguing idea that doesn’t really land. An “I did it for the patriarchy” apologia doesn’t quite address the layers of privilege and capital that have been involved with Cyrus’ most egregious missteps. Still, there’s a refreshing openness to a simple lyric like “There are layers to this body/Primal sex and primal shame/They told me I should cover it/So I went the other way”, which does more to explain Cyrus’ thought processes than any number of foot-in-mouth interviews. Explanations, though, are beside the point—“Golden G String” is a warm, inviting ballad, one of Cyrus’ most deeply-felt in years. Ultimately, that’s Plastic Hearts’ greatest success: for the first time in a long time, a Miley Cyrus record is music first, headlines second.","Stepping confidently into her “rock era,” Miley offers a genuinely pleasing, though sometimes hamfisted record that staves off the awkwardness and missteps that plagued her previous albums.

Translate,Luke Abbott,by: Ben Cardew,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5fc655db96ab91ca523e2ade/1:1/w_160/Luke%20Abbott%20-%20Translate.jpg,2020-12-02 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/luke-abbott-translate/,Border Community,"If the Ramones had grown up on Tangerine Dream and modular synthesis rather than classic rock and bubblegum, they might have produced something like Translate, the first solo album in six years from Norfolk, England producer Luke Abbott. That’s not to say that Translate shares the Ramones’ brevity, aggression, or wit—quite the opposite, in fact; here, glorious long-windedness is the order of the day. But Abbott shares with the New York punks a singular devotion to a narrowly defined sound, and on Translate he offers 11 versions on the theme of slowly mutating synth lines. Great sweeps of analog synth give Translate its shape, breaking across the spectrum like tentacles of somber-colored paint or waves on a chilly autumn sea. Abbott’s recent work in the  jazz trio Szun Waves has bled into the new album, which he recorded as a series of improvised live performances. Spontaneity and freedom of spirit fuel the album’s 11 tracks, where sounds twist at turn at will, untethered from the functional four-bar grid of much modern electronic music. On “Flux” the synths constantly promise to resolve into elegant melody, only to deviate at the last moment, sending the song lurching off into another slightly queasy left turn. “Ames Window” sounds like mice scurrying round an electronic maze—a scuttling frenzy of semi-irregular movement that seems to make sense only when viewed from a distance. There is something primal about Translate’s rather grubby kinetic repetition. To record the album, Abbott positioned speakers around Border Community label boss James Holden’s London studio in a configuration he compared to the standing slabs of Stonehenge. “Our Scene” is the perfect song for such a setup: Its driving rhythm, climbing walls of synth, and cycling melody trigger a response that feels buried deep in the mammalian brain, suggesting prehistoric humans dancing in circles after a hefty dose of local mushrooms. In the right frame of mind Translate can be highly immersive, as undulating synth patterns and analog sounds choreograph our neural oscillations into a foxtrot of flux. But a sense of sameness soon sets in. Abbott described “Ames Window” as “an indulgent improvised modular synth track,” and that characterization could comfortably fit the majority of the work here; the most immediately apparent difference between most of these songs is their length. Even that distinction feels largely arbitrary: “Kagen Sound” could happily extend to nine minutes and “Ames Window” could easily reduce to three, with no real changes to the album’s vital signs. The problem may be that the Norfolk producer is all alone on Translate. Szun Waves operate as a trio, each member bringing sounds for the others to bounce off. Translate is the work of a one-man band, and the same arpeggiated synth lines and drum-machine rhythms return again and again, with the admirable exception of “Feed Me Shapes,” which brings an unlikely blues guitar to the equation. The Ramones got away with their relentlessly reduced toolkit by writing brilliantly vital pop songs. But the melodies on Translate are rarely more than respectable. As a soundtrack to the listener’s own personal trip into the eye of the almighty—or, more prosaically, a film—Translate might work brilliantly, with the music’s cumulative effect more important than its individual details. As a sit-down listening experience, the album frequently feels too repetitive to remain consistently engaging. Still, taken as a microdosed jolt of electronic psychedelia, a song or two at a time, Translate has the potential to lift you up, out, and beyond, to a better, stranger place.","On his first album in six years, the UK producer spins freeform modular-synth improvisations into shaggily hypnotic psychedelia.

Holy Palm,Flora Yin-Wong,by: Philip Sherburne,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5fbd8320c61c34a7841b1b50/1:1/w_160/Holy%20Palm_Flora%20Yin-Wong.jpg,2020-12-02 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/flora-yin-wong-holy-palm/,Modern Love,"Flora Yin-Wong’s Holy Palm is a travel diary in sound, one where temple bells and voice notes replace passport stamps and ticket stubs. The London-born electronic musician sourced its contents from her frequent peregrinations, gathering abstracted rustling and rumbling from all sorts of exotic and mundane places: a supermarket in Tokyo, an airport in Bali, a street festival in Buenos Aires, weddings in Hackney and Thessaloniki. Buddhist monks chant in Cantonese in Hong Kong’s Po Lin monastery; a Greek Orthodox priest is recorded on a car radio in Crete; whales sing off the coast of Trømso. In many ways, her album is a record of motion itself. Not only do many of its sounds come from the actual act of travel—journeys by plane, train, and automobile; transit via tunnel, aqueduct, and escalator—but it is sequenced in a way that emphasizes forward motion. Sounds tumble together, sometimes layering into complex harmonies, but just as often, shoving and bumping into one another, like restless tourists in line for the Pompidou or the Taj Mahal. But most of those references you might not ever glean with your ears alone; this record of motion takes place largely inside the sonic equivalent of a vehicle with blacked-out windows. In the album’s credits, many of Yin-Wong’s sounds—unlabeled mementos rescued from the depths of her iPhone—are identified only as “unknown.” The organizing principle here is similar to the strategy she used on Ubi Stunt, her 2019 commission for Somerset House Studios, in which a single piece might collage together wind and gravel in the UK, crows in Hokkaido, insects in Bali, and a thunderstorm that has lost its geotag. (Some of those same sounds seem to reappear on Holy Palm, in fact.) Here as there, place and nonplace dissolve into one another; fragments of highly specific environments crumble into a fine, gray dust. Across much of the album, Yin-Wong’s collage consists of gorgeous ambient tones and textures that feel more composed than found. “Tirta Empul” opens the record with pealing gongs and the rattle of wooden percussion; as metallic drones swell in volume, the pace remains agonizingly slow, the mood ritualistic. In “Vale,” an extended foghorn blast is layered and harmonized with itself; gradually, the barest outline of a melody emerges, backlit against a scrim of deep, bassy tumult. Then, with “Martyrr,” a brief blast of noise—electrical static, a broken air conditioner, who knows—gives way to the mournful singing of a Christian monk, who is himself displaced, in “Bitterness,” by the sad, sour tones of plucked strings looped against keening, minor-key melodies. At times like these, Yin-Wong’s use of texture, contrast, and flow gives her arrangements an unmistakably musical, even lyrical character, like a dark-ambient DJ set accompanied by the tin-roof rattling of a Foley artist. Venture deep enough into the labyrinth and you’ll find a few stabs at actual club music: In “Aurochs,” white noise is sculpted into the equivalent of techno’s customary kick/hi-hat/snare patterns, and in “Diyu,” heavy percussive strikes are looped into an ominous industrial march. But much of the time, club music appears only as the index of a specific memory. Captured from the green rooms of nightclubs or the backseats of taxis, snippets of grime, UK garage, and techno are recorded on Yin-Wong’s phone—drenched in hallway echo or tinnily compressed through car speakers—and then scattered through the mix like breadcrumbs leading back to late nights remembered only by those who lived them. On the 15-minute tracks “Loci I” and “Loci II,” Yin-Wong largely abandons the musicality of the rest of the album in favor of a randomized slide reel of places. Layering gives way to simple juxtaposition. Each sound—a snatch of Corona’s Eurodance hit “Rhythm of the Night,” Balinese chanting, a snippet of grime MC—is given a moment’s time, then shunted aside in favor of the next. It is as though she were flipping through files on her phone—perhaps searching for a specific memory, perhaps just scrolling idly. These tracks are less expressive and more cryptic than the rest of the album, and on an aesthetic level, they feel less satisfying, but they also seem crucial to the questions Yin-Wong asks with Holy Palm. In her quest to understand the nature of the relationship between sound, place, and memory, Yin-Wong’s collage resembles the French filmmaker Chris Marker’s 1983 film Sans Soleil, an audiovisual essay stitched together with images from a fictional cameraman’s travels in Japan, Iceland, and Africa—department stores, temples, commuter trains—and overlaid with after-the-fact reflections taken from his letters. “He liked the fragility of those moments suspended in time,” says the narrator. “Those memories whose only function had been to leave behind nothing but memories. He wrote: I've been round the world several times and now only banality still interests me.” Like San Soleil’s protagonist, Lin-Wong is a kind of hunter-gatherer, a collector of moments captured and severed from their original contexts. Fascinated by the banal, the forgettable, and the fleeting, she asks: What happens when a memory is cut loose, and only its echo is left?","The far-reaching sound collage of the electronic musician’s sprawling album consists of gorgeous ambient tones and textures that feel more composed than found.

The Great Dismal,Nothing,by: Arielle Gordon,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5fbc3931856d3e0df1af6458/1:1/w_160/The%20Great%20Dismal_Nothing.jpg,2020-12-02 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/nothing-the-great-dismal/,Relapse,"Domenic Palermo formed Nothing to save himself; four albums in, it seems clear nothing can. The Philadelphia/New York frontman is locked in a perpetual battle with his own self-mythology. Palermo often embraces his abrasive reputation, reclaiming his two-year stint in prison by naming an album after jailhouse jargon and openly discussing his drug and alcohol use in interviews. But as the march of album cycles charged forward, the punk-turned-shoegazer more often expressed exhaustion with facile interpretations of his tortured narrative, the way performing one’s own trauma night after night can lead to complete detachment. Yet, with blind faith, he continues to return to the dark well of his subconscious, turning over the “lingering black cloud” that’s remained past their first three records’ hazy catharsis. The Great Dismal, their fourth record, is an existential commentary on Nothing’s career—a reflection on Palermo’s hometown, his upbringing, and how his music career has brought hope and horror in equal measure. Beneath the poetic remove of Nothing’s lyrics, there’s a leering sense of realism. For those voyeuristically drawn in by the ghosts of Palermo’s violent past, songs like 2018’s “Blue Line Baby” shaded in its darker colors with concrete details, names, locations. There are specifics on The Great Dismal, too, but they largely draw from a more recent past—the disorientation of endless touring, of finding a bar in Shibuya, Tokyo that feels like home. But those challenges, understandably, feel a bit removed. The band instead finds more success when Palermo waxes philosophical: “Existence hurts existence,” he sings over the album’s shiniest riffs on “Famine Asylum.” It’s an aptly dreary take on Sartre—allegedly the first lines Palermo wrote for the album—and it stands in as a thesis statement for the record. There’s a resilience buried in that declaration, too, as if the act of living is itself a victory over death: “It’s a marvel that my shell has kept its shape,” he sings coyly on “Catch a Fade.” After multiple close calls with oblivion, Palermo finds something like awe in the quotidian drudgery of existence. Nothing has toed the line between the sharp melodies of their hardcore roots and more delicate swirls of dream-pop and shoegaze, pivoting between the two as their collaborators see fit. On 2018’s Dance on the Blacktop, they took their cues from the sludge savant John Agnello, layering dense guitars and nestling Palermo’s inner lyrical torment within quiet-loud dynamics. For The Great Dismal, they’ve returned to emo stalwart Will Yip, who produced their glassy and gorgeous 2016 record Tired Of Tomorrow. And while Yip’s presence is evident in the record’s spacious compositions—the echoing snap of the drums on “Bernie Sanders,” the ambient cloud of reverb that lingers over “Blue Mecca”—it’s a more hesitant, claustrophobic record than their previous collaboration. Where Tired of Tomorrow began with a fury of cymbal crashes, opener “A Fabricated Life” casts a dense fog over the record from the outset, driven by a single guitar and Palermo’s whispered vocals, percussion never entering the equation. It’s a symbolic gesture, one that reinforces that Nothing is, at the end of the day, Palermo’s voice alone. As if to drive Palermo’s singular vision home, The Great Dismal sees the biggest lineup change of any Nothing record since the band’s inception. Founding bassist Nick Bassett, of Whirr and Deafheaven, as well as founding vocalist and guitarist Brandon Setta, have both departed the band. In their place, Jesus Piece’s Aaron Heard and Cloakroom’s Doyle Martin step in to fill their respective voids. It’s a subtle but marked shift, lending the dulled weight of Martin’s opiated vocal harmonies to “Catch a Fade” and “Blue Mecca.” And despite Palermo’s recent relocation to New York, Philadelphia makes itself known on the album, with Alex G adding his lilting vocal affectation to “April Ha Ha.” It’s a markedly gentler sound from Nothing, an anesthetized grunge that mirrors their relentless gloom. It’s a logical progression for the band, but it’s hard not to miss their duality, their moments of ragged hardcore intensity; the crisper edges of “Ask the Rusk”’s opening riff are a welcome shot of adrenaline. Though Nothing is cut from the somnambulant swirls of UK groups like the Smiths and Cocteau Twins, they’ve distilled their critiques into a distinctly American frustration. The Great Dismal takes its name from a giant swamp along the southeastern American coast, what Palermo refers to as a “brilliant natural trap” where only the murkiest survive. The album features one sample, a manic ode to shopping taken from a mall infomercial, and its eerie enthusiasm speaks to the capitalistic hedonism Nothing seems unable to escape. Nothing has established their voice by transforming that anxiety into languid, slanted harmonies. The Great Dismal takes stock of their career, finding vaporous beauty in shrugging off their inner demons.","On their fourth record, Dominick Palermo leads his dream-pop shoegaze band in a claustrophobic album about his upbringing, and how his music career has brought hope and horror in equal measure.

CYR,The Smashing Pumpkins,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5fbc3c3af48ed7830bd73c0e/1:1/w_160/cyr_smashing%20pumpkins.jpg,2020-12-01 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/the-smashing-pumpkins-cyr/,Sumerian,"At the peak of his artistic powers, Billy Corgan couldn’t bear the thought of being less popular than Pearl Jam, less revered than Kurt Cobain, and less cute than James Iha. In the mid-’90s, he saw himself as a force of divine talent, and his sociopathic competitiveness, tyrannical perfectionism, and endless personal grievances were unseen in Chicago outside of the Bulls locker room. The most generous interpretation of his current irrelevance is that Corgan has come to accept it. He’s undoubtedly noticed how the indifference towards his new music, embarrassing ticket sales, and bountiful PR gaffes barely affect the brand at this point—“Riot Fest headliner” appears to be their permanent floor. But there’s a glimpse of the old Billy Corgan in Smashing Pumpkins’ new album CYR, backed by an enthusiastic new label that will actually bankroll his dreams of an animated series. A “return to form” can’t happen without a return to proper Smashing Pumpkins optics. The profoundly inessential 2018 album SHINY AND OH SO BRIGHT VOL. 1 has been retroactively written off as tour promo, or at least a prelude to CYR, which can be viewed as the first true reunion of the Corgan/Iha/Jimmy Chamberlin creative core since 1995’s Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness. CYR is likewise being promoted as a double album, nevermind that it’s actually shorter than the 1998’s Adore or 2000’s MACHINA/Machines of God or that it arrives on streaming services as a unified block of 20 tracks. In practice, CYR is already bisected into “singles” and “the other ones”—a whopping 10 singles were portioned out in five pairs over the past three months. The initial “CYR”/“The Colour of Love” drop was at least proof that Corgan’s populist instincts haven’t completely vanished. After a decade of unconvincingly cosplaying as a rootsy singer-songwriter, glam-rock yeoman, Rick Rubin salvage project, and an H&M soundtrack aspirant, Corgan created a role delicious enough to demand attention: corporate synth-pop impresario. Imagine him working with the same raw materials as Adore and swapping out the black cloak for a sleeves-rolled white blazer, hunched over the mixing console, forcing Jimmy Chamberlin to play with a click track, demanding another take from his female session vocalists until they heed his command of “Robert Palmer, but more neon.” “CYR” and “The Colour of Love” are Corgan’s most convincing singles in ages, if only because he believes in their hooks enough to repeat them until they stick. Neither is really a bold new iteration of Smashing Pumpkins, just an alternate history where Corgan’s synth-pop muse is promoted to the big leagues and all the goth stuff is saved for the inevitable B-sides collections. And lest anyone think that Corgan has completely reinvented himself, that’s colour of love, not “color”—the seeming affectation of someone who believes the Queen’s English signifies art or a pledge of allegiance to touchstones Sisters of Mercy and Joy Division. The subsequent singles slowly chipped away at the novelty, but at least demonstrated Corgan’s commitment to the bit—CYR’s lone alt-rock throwback “Wyttch” is a Guitar Center employee’s faded memories of customers fumbling through the “Thunder Kiss ’65” riff. Touring member Katie Cole and longtime collaborator/Black Eyed Peas associate Sierra Swan make the most of a rare Smashing Pumpkins supporting role, adding necessary melodic color and indicating that, indeed, other human beings were involved in the creation of a 72-minute album written and produced entirely by Billy Corgan. Ever the Pumpkins lifer, Chamberlin attributes his dry, mechanical playing to Corgan’s desire for an “early-’70s prog” sound; anyone else will just hear one of the most propulsive drummers in rock history relegated to a human metronome. The input of other members of Smashing Pumpkins has always been intentionally difficult to quantify, and without a single memorable guitar part throughout, Iha and bassist Jeff Schroeder are mere witnesses to Corgan treating CYR as his Logic X tutorial. Corgan admitted he was initially frustrated by the learning curve of self-production until he recognized how technological limitations inspired the distinct sonic character of his formative bands. Some ear-turning elements scattered throughout are new for Smashing Pumpkins—the vaguely tropical sway of “Dulcet in E,” 808 handclaps on “Starrcraft” that could’ve been pulled from an OVO sampler pack—and they are also new to anyone toying with a DAW’s factory presets. But none of Corgan’s definitive qualities as a musician—symphonic grandeur, needling immediacy—translate to his production, which burdens CYR with out-of-the-box anonymity; a Smashing Pumpkins album that sounds like it was handed off to a guy at the Genius Bar. The production’s clinical competency only highlights the assembly-line songwriting of CYR’s back half. Whereas the back half of Smashing Pumpkins albums are typically earmarked for oddball experiments and cult favorites, CYR doles out one three-and-a-half-minute song after another, working within nearly identical vocal cadences, song structures, textures, and even tempos eerily similar to Logic’s default of 120 bpm. Only the most blatant examples of Corganphonics break up the monotony—drawling out “swoon” for two seconds until it sounds like “swan” on the otherwise mesmerizing “Save Your Tears,” the phonetic (and incorrect) pronunciation of “Samhain” on “Wyttch.” Credit where it’s due: CYR has the least amount of filler of any supersized Smashing Pumpkins album because it has the narrowest gap between the singles and the deep cuts. I also can’t imagine anyone who wouldn’t trade any random three-song run for another “Glass and the Ghost Children” just to feel something. CYR ends up being just as immersive as Smashing Pumpkins’ masterworks, just in a modern way. It’s the sort of album that gets accused of trying to game Billboard’s streaming calculations through sheer volume, single after single blending into a curiously ambient experience with Corgan’s voice faintly present in the background like an essential oil spray. But the real failing of CYR is the same one that’s plagued him since MACHINA effectively ended his imperial phase: No matter how much he writes about the nature of true love and magick and our connection to an eternal timeline, it’s impossible to grasp what any of it actually means to Corgan on an emotional level. “Drum and Fife” remains the most resonant song he’s made in the past 20 years and it’s simply an admission that he’s going to keep doing him even if no one gives a shit. Lest anyone doubt that Corgan can’t tell the difference between spinning his wheels and being on a roll, he’s already got nearly 50 songs ready for the next album.","Billy Corgan reenlists the creative core of James Iha and Jimmy Chamberlin for a lengthy synth-pop excursion that is clinically competent and rarely as thrilling—or thrillingly weird—as their previous work.

Dimensional Stardust,Rob MazurekExploding Star Orchestra,by: Marty Sartini Garner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5fbc3d59cd7af7fa472a043e/1:1/w_160/Dimensional%20Stardust_Rob%20Mazurek%20&%20Exploding%20Star%20Orchestra.jpg,2020-12-01 06:00:00,Jazz,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/rob-mazurek-exploding-star-orchestra-dimensional-stardust/,International AnthemNonesuch,"It’s been five years since Rob Mazurek’s last album with Exploding Star Orchestra, and in that brief window, the Chicago jazz and avant-garde scene from which the collective first arose has enjoyed more attention than it has in decades. Dimensional Stardust was composed for a Berlin-based version of the group, but Mazurek recorded it with a lineup heavy on local heroes—longtime members Nicole Mitchell, Jeff Parker, and John Herndon are joined by Tomeka Reid, Damon Locks, and Jaimie Branch, among others. As a result, it comes off as a second coronation for this era of the city, following Makaya McCraven’s Universal Beings from 2018. But where that album highlighted the individual brilliance of Chicago soloists (alongside those from London, New York, and L.A.), Dimensional Stardust is a tightly orchestrated ensemble piece that—like many of the musicians who play on it—uses the gestures of experimental classical music and avant-garde jazz to move into fresh territory. While previous Exploding Star Orchestra albums have made space for improvisation and soloing, everything on Dimensional Stardust was composed by Mazurek. He recorded each musician’s parts separately over the span of seven months then stitched the album together with the patience and precision of a luxury car embroiderer; if there are seams, they’re obscured by the intricate curlicues he pulls from his band. Throughout the album, he strings together long phrases of short tones, forcing his instrumentalists to play lines that, on staff paper, must have looked like a tangled pearl necklace pulled out of a drawer. On opener “Sun Core Tet (Parable 99),” he sends a spree of notes up Reid’s cello and through Macie Stewart’s violin, then back down via Mitchell’s flute. It’s a trick he repeats often, and it manages never to diminish the individuality of the players; when Mitchell, guitarist Parker, and vibraphonist Joel Ross trade lines in “A Wrinkle in Time Sets Concentric Circles Reeling,” it doesn’t feel like they’re stating one long sentence together so much as they’re considering an idea from multiple angles. This sense of interdependence is palpable throughout Dimensional Stardust, and it’s made all the more powerful for its having been manufactured after the fact. Mazurek is a master arranger, and he fits the album’s constituent parts together in a way that defies logic. In one of the album’s most uncanny moments, he sutures a virtuosic run from Mitchell to the three-person percussion team in such a way it’s impossible to tell if Mitchell is playing her flute like a drum kit or if the percussionists are matching her polyrhythms tap-for-tap. Elsewhere, on “Abstract Dark Energy (Parable 9),” Mazurek places a simple square of piano in the distance, giving us a focal point while an anxious bossa nova beat washes through much of the song. Much of the title track sounds as though it’s played in a long, low-ceilinged room with a thin layer of water on the ground, with the resultant compression feeling less like radio-ready loudness and more like the radiating energy of a universe waiting to be born. Fully half of the songs on Dimensional Stardust are either titled or subtitled as parables, and it’s not hard to understand Mazurek’s attraction to the form. Parables are small stories that open up to cosmic truths. They suggest that our daily life and relationships reveal something greater about the universe itself, and that our quotidian reality is supported by untold mysteries that are nevertheless possible to understand. With his careful needlework, Mazurek stitches together an album of big, unanswerable questions and gorgeously orchestrated music, setting aside distinctions between genres, musicians, and points in time and space without losing sight of how each of these components is necessary to the whole. It rises up to gesture toward the cosmos, then returns us to life on Earth, tracing a single great parabolic arc.","The Chicago jazz composer stitches together an album of big, unanswerable questions and gorgeously orchestrated music from a host of local heroes.

III,Lindstrøm & Prins Thomas,by: Megan Buerger,Contributor ,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5fbd873edcf8ebd9e69c4007/1:1/w_160/III_Lindstr%C3%B8m%20&%20Prins%20Thomas.jpg,2020-12-01 06:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/lindstrom-and-prins-thomas-iii/,Smalltown Supersound,"In the decade since Lindstrøm & Prins Thomas released their last album, the revelatory space-disco voyage II, electronic dance music underwent several shape-shifting transformations: the explosion and fizzle of mass-market EDM, a U-turn toward classic house and cerebral techno, and fusions of ambient and jazz with global rhythms. It’s a testament to the Norwegian pair’s steadfast, forward-thinking style that their third album, III, picks up right where II left off and still sounds remarkably current. It’s as if Hans-Peter Lindstrøm and Thomas Moen Hermansen had been waiting for the perfect moment to re-enter the conversation and found it inside 2020’s strange collective pause. A joyride of heady, prog-infused atmospheres and downtempo house music, the album curves, twists, and undulates like a slow-moving river. Drifting through a series of mood-based sketches—French space pop, beach-gazing Balearia, and winding, loungey kosmische—it’s easy to lose yourself in syncopated melodies and swirling polyrhythms that, in another context, could easily have sounded like chaos. Instead, there are moments when III might double as a mood record—soothing, silky, perfectly synthetic—with infectious rhythms and enveloping arrangements that bely its compositional complexity. This is where the duo really shines; in their skilled hands, cosmic disco isn’t so much a gimmick or a goal but a technique, a way to prioritize atmosphere without sacrificing musicality. Their music doesn’t demand close listening, but it sure rewards it. It can take four or five spins to hear everything that’s going on in a song. These tracks are less kaleidoscopic than the duo’s prior joint releases, with fewer improvisational excursions and a stricter adherence to structure and rhythm. But what’s lacking in funky, free-wheeling jamming is made up in concrete, beat-driven vibe. These are grooves you’re meant to lock into. Even “Oranges”—easily the project’s most far-out number, with coiling synths and skewed melodies that whiz and whirl past like space debris—has a steady, laid-back beat that brings it back down to earth. “The tracks that Lindstrøm sent me were almost like standard house tracks,” Prins Thomas has said, alluding to the project’s club roots. “I already had an idea of what I wanted to do, so I forced those tracks into new shoes and dresses.” In the end, nothing about these songs is standard, from their dizzying, kitschy synths to their warped minor-major oscillations. Most of the album’s tracks push the bounds of what is considered dance music, a space that neither producer has ever fully committed to. “Martin 5000” has the most forward momentum—if there’s one track you might someday hear at a smoky after-hours, it’s this one—but retreats into meandering electric guitar and soft, tinkering piano that give it a floaty, aimless feel. “Harmonia” turns a gentle pendulum bassline into a serious, physical groove, but resists the urge to build past the half-way point. Occasionally, this hesitation can feel like a cop-out; you get the sense that there’s a little more to be explored. But there’s something psychedelic about the way these tracks avoid propulsion or release, opting instead to get lost inside themselves. Playful but intense, bite-sized yet jammy, these are inner-expedition songs best absorbed through a pair of thick headphones. As is typical when Lindstrøm and Prins Thomas join forces, some of the project’s most exciting moments are snuck in the back door, laced into a dazzling breakdown or deep, hypnotic groove. The many jazzy layers of “Small Stream” come together so patiently and fluidly that it’s easy to miss the intricately cascading synth arpeggios. On “Birdstrik,” they transform a lighthearted, free-form piano solo into a dense and probing spell with muffled future-garage beats that shuffle underneath. It’s one of the only songs that briefly departs from its core rhythm, as the shuffle suddenly dissolves into chords, arpeggios, and air. When it does, it’s exquisite—a brief, gorgeous inhalation that feels physical and relieving, and that would surely get lost in the action of a dance floor. Seconds later, the synths return and the drumbeat reconnects, and the song spins back into orbit.","A decade after their last album together, the Norwegian space-disco producers pick up where they left off, bringing new emphasis on structure and rhythm to their heady, atmospheric vibes.

Spontaneous Order,Fatima Yamaha,by: Jemima Skala,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5fb7f7707157507b781db93e/1:1/w_160/Spontaneous%20Order_Fatima%20Yamaha.jpg,2020-12-01 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/fatima-yamaha-spontaneous-order/,Magnetron,"In the 11 years after Fatima Yamaha released the 2004 single “What’s A Girl to Do,” the whimsical electro-house tune became a cult club favorite. With its earworm hook and gradual build, the song became a dancefloor staple, particularly in Glasgow, and it was a rare night out that didn’t feature its signature hook floating over a sweaty crowd. Its sneaky catchiness, plus the anonymity of its creators, propelled the mysterious entity to popularity. No one knew who “Fatima Yamaha” was, and the original pressing of the song featured a girl on the cover. Then Fatima Yamaha played a set at Dekmantel 2015, and was revealed to be Dutch producer Bas Bron. With this, the spell broke. His 2015 breakthrough album Imaginary Lines offered more of the same synth-based dreamy electro as “What’s A Girl to Do,” but felt more like pastiche than the genuine article. Follow-up Spontaneous Order was five years in the making, and represents an about-face from the detached cool that brought Fatima Yamaha its slow-burning fame. Instead, the album offers an over-the-top confection of Daft Punk-esque synth keyboards, tight funk beats, and heavily filtered vocals. Spontaneous Order revels in its campiness, and many tracks here feature cheesecake-rich melody lines that take the songs skyward. Opening track “Drops in the Ocean” features life-like water droplet sounds that mark the downbeat, and a synth melody soars over the top before Sofie Winterson’s vocal feature enters, layered thick with effects. It gathers pace before it’s saved from its own silliness by that signature Fatima Yamaha squelchy bass. “Bar-Bodega ‘That’s It!’” opens with a sharp four-on-the-floor beat before zipping into cheerful bouncing chord stabs and an obnoxiously confident synth melody. The slowed-down “We Are Drops” sneaks into power-ballad territory, with its heavy-handed drums the and shamelessly empty lyrical platitudes (“We’re drops, we’re drops/Together alone, we’re drops”) sung in falsetto by Bron before building to an echoing, spacious climax. Elsewhere on the album, Bron is subtler. The breakbeats and juddering melody of “Monderman” are a far cry from the up-beat funk of the rest of the album; its chords are transposed up and down the scale as the track progresses, generating patterns from randomness. “Master Zhuang” begins with a booming bass and squelching drums before a blipping, jaunty synth melody pulls it into the realm of vintage video game soundtracks. The title Spontaneous Order is a nod to the accumulating and random set of circumstances that first brought Bron recognition as Fatima Yamaha. To replicate the alluring mysteriousness of “What’s A Girl to Do” would only be disappointing; instead, Bron has created an album that’s shameless in its poppy sensibilities and that doesn’t try to be cool.","Dutch producer Bas Bron abandons the understated cool of his cult hit “What’s a Girl to Do” for bright ’80s synths and Daft Punk melodrama.

No Panic No Pain,FLOHIO,by: Will Pritchard,Contributor ,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5fbd30260f9ba652bdb98d18/1:1/w_160/no%20panic%20no%20pain_flohio.jpg,2020-11-30 06:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/flohio-no-panic-no-pain/,AlphaTone,"A week before Flohio’s debut mixtape was due for release, the south London rapper was having second thoughts about the title. Unveiled, as it was originally to be known, didn’t feel right. No Panic No Pain, a lyric from the title track, was a better fit, Flohio said, for “a challenging time like this where I feel a little vulnerable.” There’s little sign of this vulnerability on the retitled tape: its 10 mostly brief tracks are cool and aloof, and the sound is more concrete façade than open-armed embrace. Opener “FLOFLO!” begins with Flohio, real name Funmi Ohiosumah, making awkward apologies over the phone for not being more emotionally available—before withdrawing abruptly into her own stresses: “All I know is madness,” she raps tensely, trailing off. Flohio’s journey to this point has been one studded with acclaim. She first turned heads four years ago with a bouncy homage to her hood in “SE16”; fashion mag Dazed named her in its zeitgeisty Dazed100 list a year later. A steady drip of arresting singles led to 2018’s four-track Wild Yout EP and saw her lumped in with a loose grouping of alt-rappers that included the likes of Denzel Curry, slowthai, and Kojey Radical. She covered magazines and was picked out by supermodel Naomi Campbell as one of “10 Rising Female Stars Reimagining Our Future” for a piece of Vogue brandvertorial. The BBC named her in its influential ‘Sound of...’ list for 2019. The belated arrival and pressure of outsize expectations on this debut full-length release might explain Flohio’s last-minute jitters. The result doesn’t quite live up to the hype (it’s difficult to imagine what could), but still offers moments that confirm why everyone has been so excited about this 28-year-old rapper. If you haven’t been to Flohio’s backyard of Bermondsey in south London—with its brick-built factories, warehouses, and disused wharves—then listening to No Panic No Pain is a good way to visit. The beats tend towards distorted kicks, metallic snares, and industrial synths. Flohio’s go-to flow is one that’s clipped and staccato, all straight edges. It’s a sometimes exhausting pairing that contracts and flattens song structures. “Booby Traps” feels stiff and fails to generate much forward momentum from a chanted call to arms; “Flash” gets halfway to a catchy chorus before shrinking back into verses that are difficult to decipher. Touches of US rap gloss offer some relief: on the Take a Daytrip-produced “Unveiled,” Flohio adds a silky sheen to her snippy flow that, contrasted with the natural grit in her voice, sounds vivid and bright. In the past she’s identified Lil Wayne as an influence, and this comes through as a playful lilt in her voice over the flexy swing of “Sweet Flaws”; on “Stuck In A Dance,” she elongates rounded vowels and floats from kick to snapping rimshot with gripping effect. These are real glimmers of brilliance; but No Panic No Pain would be more memorable if it had more of them. Beyond that, it’s hard to identify exactly what’s missing. The appearance of a picked guitar on “Medicine” draws Flohio into sensitive introspection and a looser flow that adds some balance to the mixtape’s otherwise relentless pummel. The melancholy of “Roundtown” (with its chorus of “I’ve been around town, for a second going ham now/See me rolling tryna get my balance right”) puts the brakes on somewhat, but still struggles under its oppressive delivery. Despite its short runtime, No Panic No Pain can sometimes feel like an endurance test, more marathon wall than victory lap. People tend to encounter panic and pain—unpleasant though they are—when the body needs them most. They’re best experienced in small doses. Sadly, it’s hard not to feel the same way about this mixtape.","The long-awaited debut from this hotly tipped South London rapper fails to meet its astronomical expectations but shows glimmers of real brilliance.

Shadow of Fear,Cabaret Voltaire,by: Robert Ham,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5fb7f5d713f03534381018a2/1:1/w_160/Shadow%20of%20Fear_Cabaret%20Voltaire.jpg,2020-11-30 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/cabaret-voltaire-shadow-of-fear/,Mute,"Shadow of Fear, the first new Cabaret Voltaire album in 26 years, finds the UK post-punk/proto-industrial act reduced to just one person: founding member Richard H. Kirk. That has been the case since the project was resurrected in 2014 at Berlin’s Atonal Festival, two decades after the longest-running incarnation of the group (Kirk and fellow multi-instrumentalist Stephen Mallinder) parted ways. Keeping Cabaret Voltaire as a solo act seems to be by design—an insistence on moving the project forward rather than trying to cash in on the past. Kirk apparently turned down a lucrative offer from Coachella to reform the group, and when he finally began to perform live as Cabaret Voltaire, he played nothing but new material. “I always make it really clear that if you think you’re going to come and hear the greatest hits,” he told FACT in 2017, “then don’t come because you’re not. What you might get is the same spirit.” Shadow of Fear falls comfortably under Kirk’s rubric. The eight songs on the new record are all original compositions written and developed over the past six years, yet there’s no mistaking it for anything other than a Cabaret Voltaire album. While not as pulverizing as the group’s early recordings nor as sleek as the techno and house-inspired work found on 1993’s International Language, it blends the various eras of the group into a mostly satisfying whole. Much of the album’s throwback sound is due to simple technology choices. Kirk’s recent Cabaret Voltaire performances didn’t make use of laptops, but rather stuck to his array of older synths and drum machines. According to the press notes for Shadow, when he tried to upgrade his setup for the recording, his computer melted down. Working with older gear lends an invitingly rough-hewn quality to much of the album. The heaving melodic groans and guitar flickers on “The Power (Of Their Knowledge)” are underpinned by a tinny preset beat from a cheap keyboard, and “Microscopic Flesh Fragment” slowly builds from an off-kilter, never resolving drum sample into a dark, soupy dub-inspired tangle. Kirk also makes a direct connection to Cabaret Voltaire’s past on “Papa Nine Zero Delta United” via a wonky drum machine rhythm that is almost a mirror of the one he, Mallinder, and original member Chris Watson used on their 1979 single “Nag Nag Nag.” At the same time, Shadow of Fear belies its creator’s intentions to keep Cabaret Voltaire, as he said in that FACT interview, “breaking new ground and moving forward.” For someone who has clearly kept up with the evolution of electronic music, as proven by his own club-ready releases or the remixes he’s done for Factory Floor and Powell, Kirk doesn’t apply the same contemporary approach to this material. The most current-sounding track on the album, “Universal Energy,” is a squirrely excursion into Chicago-style acid house. The album’s title seems to nod to the gloomy anxiety that seems to be following our every move these days. Cabaret Voltaire, past or present, is the ideal soundtrack to an era of doomscrolling and persistent creeping dread. The group once presaged a dystopian future in tense early tracks like “No Escape” and “Spread The Virus.” That time has come and Kirk is once again a prescient musical messenger. In the hiccupping, strangely groovy final track “What’s Goin’ On,” a sampled voice asks the song’s title, sounding harried and fearful. The answer, according to another sample on the track: “Take a look.”","The post-punk/proto-industrial group is now down to just founding member Richard H. Kirk, who fills the first Cabaret Voltaire album in 26 years with invitingly rough-hewn sounds.

Il Quadro di Troisi,Il Quadro di Troisi,by: Ben Cardew,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5fbc3f06cd7af7fa472a0440/1:1/w_160/Il%20Quadro%20di%20Troisi_Il%20Quadro%20di%20Troisi.jpg,2020-11-30 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/il-quadro-di-troisi-il-quadro-di-troisi/,Raster,"If 2020 had turned out differently, the debut album by Il Quadro di Troisi might have been the perfect soundtrack to the arrival of breathless exchange students in Italy’s ornate university cities, its winsome synth-pop spilling out of the headphones of homesick young people sharing flirtatious guidebook sentences with mysterious, well-dressed locals. In the absence of foreign travel, Il Quadro di Troisi—a collaboration between Italian electronic artists Eva Geist and Donato Dozzy—does the hard work for us, conjuring up the head-spinning beauty of Italy’s architecture and the effortless elegance of its nightlife. Geist (aka Andrea Noce) and Dozzy (Donato Scaramuzzi) are both excellent producers in their own right, behind everything from wobbly psychedelia (Geist’s 2019 Urban Monogamy EP) to body-slamming acid (Dozzy’s 2018 LP Filo Loves the Acid) to heady ambient techno (Scaramuzzi’s mind-bending duo Voices From the Lake). But nothing in their catalogs has suggested they might be capable of producing pop as lush and poised as “Il Giudizio,” a song shot through with an irresistible twinge of melancholy and glamour, like sorrow between silk sheets. Noce’s vocals, in particular, are a revelation. She sings the way Venice must surely look after a late-night heartbreak, all gloriously dusted beauty and elegant sighs. On “Real” her voice soars to the rafters like a startled bird; on “Sfere di Qi” it is shot through with tension; on “Non Ricordi” it drips with erotic charge. Scaramuzzi’s production, meanwhile, draws on Italy’s small but perfectly formed history of Italo disco and synth pop, all dreamy synth lines and discerning machine rhythms; their graceful tick is like an enigmatic stranger’s tantalizing offer to dance, rather than the relentless mechanical pester of contemporary dance music. The shadow of Ennio Morricone’s exquisitely textured soundtrack work haunts Il Quadro di Troisi’s arrangements, adding sumptuous flesh to Scaramuzzi’s electronic skeleton. Pietro Micioni, of Italian indie label Twilight Music, contributes a wonderfully spidery guitar line to “Il Giudizio” that pushes the song into full ecstatic melancholy, like a rural reprise of the Sabres of Paradise’s classic “Smokebelch II (Beatless Mix).” “Sfere di Qi” introduces lilting flute to a synth that coils around Noce’s vocals like a predatory python, suggesting early Kraftwerk if Ralf Hütter and Florian Schneider had grown up on the banks of the Tiber. And Tommaso Cappellato adds the lightest dusting of live drums to “Raggio Verde,” his fine-drawn cymbal strikes upping the song’s organic texture by fractional—but important—degrees. These are pop songs for weary adults, which sacrifice the impulsive neon glare of modern production for a comforting pastel glow, their subtly layered charms emerging on sustained plays like ruins from the Neapolitan dirt. Il Quadro di Troisi’s gloriously evocative touch leaves them in elevated company. If Air represent a guidebook glimpse of France, swapping mundane reality for the ornate grandeur of their native Versailles, then Il Quadro di Troisi do the same for Italy, their florid synth adventures painting pictures of a country so impossibly debonair it could only exist in our dreams. The album was born of a correspondence between Scaramuzzi and Noce about the late actor and director Massimo Troisi, best known for his outsider comedies, but it feels closer to Fellini's vision of Rome in La Dolce Vita: a work of pure creative opulence.","Italian electronic musicians Donato Dozzy and Eva Geist team up on a bewitching album of opulently appointed songs rooted in the country’s disco and synth-pop traditions.

Musick to Play in the Dark,Coil,by: Jesse Dorris,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5fb7fdf4cd7af7fa472a0359/1:1/w_160/Musick%20To%20Play%20In%20the%20Dark_Coil.jpg,2020-11-30 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/coil-musick-to-play-in-the-dark/,Dais,"Balance and Sleazy were one of music’s great romances. In the early 1980s, Geoff Burton, aka John Balance, utilized fan letters and zines to will himself from a troubled childhood of precocious homosexuality and occult aspirations into the arms of Peter “Sleazy” Christopherson. As a photographer whose portraits shocked the Sex Pistols, graphic designer for Peter Gabriel’s early albums, and member of the notorious “Wreckers of Civilization” Throbbing Gristle, Sleazy had already earned a reputation. But in true alchemical fashion, when the two came together they created something much stronger, and stranger, than most life-work partners, amassing dozens of albums and EPs and homages to back-of-the-lab psychedelics and antiquarian gems. Coil devised an uncanny, stained, ever-shifting kaleidoscope of musique concrete, kosmische, techno, drone, cabaret, jazz, and glitch, with guest stars including aliens, the ghosts of ancient kings, and “the accumulation of male sexual energy.” (Hence the stains.) Coil planted seeds. They introduced into their devoted fanbase the effluvia of early queer mystics like Austin Osman Spare and presented them the evidence of modern queer existences fundamentally opposed to assimilation. Their cross-pollination of futuristic tech and ancient texts would sprout various tangles: Björk’s pagan poetry and Sunn O)))’s postverbal omm, the antibody music of Autechre and Dreamcrusher, the probiotic post-goth of FKA twigs and the Knife and even Perfume Genius, all seeking out healing in the abject. Like most romantics, though, they were at their best in the shadows. Musick to Play in the Dark, their magnum opus, released just as the last millennium turned, is part Muzak and part Magick. It’s effective, setting a mood like marital aids Music to Keep Your Husband Happy and the Love Unlimited Orchestra, or Haruomi Hosono’s ’80s music for department-store shopping, or Spotify’s yawning chasms of vibey playlists—yet far more potent, almost domineering. If you give yourself over to it, odd things transpire. (Many moons ago, I spent a year or so falling asleep to it. One night I did not. My house burned down the next morning.) “Are You Shivering” sets the stage with a ferocious roar, like a groaning opening of black rubber curtains; it recedes to reveal a glistening expanse of slippery little noises sliced into dripping tinsel. Balance’s voice hovers among them, first cut and honed into amorphous moans, then clear as an echoing bell: “I lay down and shiver in your silver river/Out drips the last drop of this vital fluid… This is moon music.” Others have twinned male potency and lunacy, perhaps, but no song has made semen so spellbinding. Post-coital from the start, Musick then spaces out with “Red Birds Will Fly Out of the East and Destroy Paris in a Night,” an epic of arpeggios and buzzing analog threads spun largely by synth whiz Thighspaulsandra, who, along with Drew McDowall, are the album’s crucial collaborators. “Red Birds” spirals ever larger before self-immolating in toxic fizz. The little noises return, licks of flames soundtracking a fireside chat—and out stumbles the “Red Queen,” in which Balance recriminates via sped-up chitter chatter and coruscates with crisp, shady intonation. “Is it so awful to be seen to feel and fail?” he asks of those too proud to admit they’ve been fooled by the foolish. The band plays on behind him, the beat an entirely blotto slur of heaving bass and vicious minces of piano. “An unsafe male trait,” Balance calls out, snide in the face of macho vanity. “What are you going to do if they don’t believe you?” Safety’s for the birds. “Strange Birds,” that is, in which clicks and cuts flutter and take flight and presage recordings of their real, feathered brethren. It’s a grounding pause for an album with its head in the stars. But it’s not a relief. In 1999, bird songs often augured the end of an ambient set, and loons sang across jungle tracks; here, they don’t offer a consolation of dawn so much as a warning from the sky. “One day your eggs/Are going to hatch,” Balance whispers. “And some very strange birds/Are going to emerge.” Like so many of music’s great romances—Ike and Tina, Kurt and Courtney—horror attended the astonishing beauty of their creation. Balance, a long-suffering alcoholic, fell from their mansion stairs to his death in 2004; Sleazy died in Bangkok just six years later. The horror was inextricable from the beauty of albums like the AIDS-haunted Horse Rotovator, or the limited-edition records cloaked in white covers streaked with Balance’s own blood, loosed during a lunatic episode. Myths are made from such mayhem. Yet the most profound moments of Musick are somehow the simplest and sweetest. Closer “The Dreamer Is Still Asleep” summons the uncanny power of, say, Portishead remixing Arthur Russell. A rhythm shuffles like a lover’s gentle snore; Balance’s voice, never more gentle than here, and cloaked in reverb thick as warm blankets, duets with a warm organ. Lonely chords swell as Balance ponders the legacy and latency of trauma. “Is that hurt you?” Balance wonders. “We forget, and don’t notice the loss/Crossing into venerable degeneration.” We all return to the soil. At the center of the album, Coil’s finest moment blossoms. “Broccoli” is perhaps the only Balance and Sleazy duet, an astonishing meditation on familial duty, death, etiquette, gardening, and the titular vegetable. “By working the soil we cultivate the sky,” Sleazy sing-songs, and Balance chants over bass as deep as the grave. “We embrace the vegetable kingdom.” Death as vegetative state, death as generation. Coil are dead, but we’re still feasting on their harvest.","Newly reissued, the duo’s 1999 magnum opus queers ambient music in a psychedelic journey through sex, death, and gardening.

The Concert for Bangladesh,George HarrisonRavi Shankar,by: Quinn Moreland,Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5fbc3806f48ed7830bd73c0c/1:1/w_160/the%20concert%20for%20bangla%20desh_george%20harrison.jpg,2020-11-29 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/george-harrison-ravi-shankar-the-concert-for-bangladesh/,Apple,"In the spring of 1965, the Beatles were roped into filming a movie in support of their upcoming album Help! To say its slapstick comic plot has not aged well would be an understatement: a fan gives Ringo Starr a ring belonging to a group of “oriental mystics,” as the DVD box puts it; wacky antics ensue. The band, perpetually stoned out of their minds, did not particularly enjoy making the movie, but for one member, it was transformative in its way. George Harrison was the group’s youngest member, a diligent guitarist who was all knees, elbows, and biting humor. He was deemed the “quiet” Beatle, but a better label might be “the searcher.” While filming a scene set at an Indian restaurant, Harrison began toying around with a sitar belonging to some hired background performers. Fascinated, he purchased his own, and brought it to the studio for Rubber Soul, their next album, to accompany John Lennon’s infidelity lullaby “Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown).” Harrison and the Beatles were not the first Western musicians to find inspiration in Indian classical music—John Coltrane and Philip Glass both studied the tala, its metric cycle; Glass’ fellow minimalist composers Terry Riley and La Monte Young experimented with drones; rock bands like the Yardbirds, the Kinks, and the Byrds used their guitars to emulate the sitar’s distinctive tone. But Beatlemania ensured that anything a member dabbled in became a cultural phenomenon. “Norweigan Wood” helped kick off the popularity of so-called “raga rock,” a brief fad for Western pop that gestured vaguely at Indian musical and spiritual concepts; a raga is the melodic framework of Indian classical music. As critic Sandy Pearlman wrote of raga rock in a 1966 issue of Crawdaddy, “If used only in the interest of exoticism, it can quickly become shopworn and ‘ordinary’ and not particularly justifiable.” Pearlman pointed to “Norwegian Wood” as an example: Since the sitar simply echoes Lennon’s guitar melody, its presence conveys gimmicky Orientalism and not much else. Roughly in tandem with these developments in British and American rock, master sitarist and composer Ravi Shankar experienced his own surge of Western popularity. In the 1940s and ’50s, he had established himself as one of India’s most celebrated musicians, composing for ballets and films, working as the music director of All India Radio, and founding its National Orchestra, Vadya Vrinda. He began touring internationally and releasing recordings with Columbia, EMI, and World Pacific, and by the late ’60s had gained a large following abroad. As a romantic vision of India captured the Western imagination, he floated between superstardom in both the classical and countercultural spheres, performing at both Lincoln Center and Monterey Pop Festival in 1967. He was also unimpressed with “Norwegian Wood,” telling a reporter, “If George Harrison wants to play the sitar, why does he not learn it properly?” Soon enough, the pair met and discovered they were kindred spirits. Shankar began instructing Harrison on melodic structure and playing technique, as well as the underlying spiritual discipline. As Harrison’s interest grew more sincere and less LSD-laced, he became so preoccupied with the sitar that he essentially abandoned the guitar for a period. Suffocated by fame and lost within the power dynamic of the Beatles, Harrison found new meaning in Indian music and philosophy. Times changed—the ’60s ended, the Beatles broke up, Western mainstream interest in Indian music subsided—but Harrison remained. His friendship with Shankar would prove to be one of music’s richest. In the summer of 1971, the pair were in Los Angeles finishing the soundtrack of Raga, a documentary about Shankar’s life that Harrison and Apple, the Beatles’ multimedia conglomerate, were helping finance and distribute. But Shankar’s mind was elsewhere. The Indian subcontinent had been divided into two independent nations in 1947 after decades of British colonialism. Each of them housed a religious majority: Hindu India and Muslim Pakistan. The partition triggered a massive, horrifically violent wave of migration; the division of Pakistan into two non-contiguous territories, one on each side of India, was especially precarious. Although East Pakistan had a slightly larger population, the government was based in West Pakistan, over a thousand miles away, resulting in many political, cultural, and economic disparities. In March 1971, East Pakistan declared independence, adopting the name Bangladesh, and West Pakistan responded with a brutal attempt to quell the movement for autonomy. Over the next nine months, between 300,000 and 3 million Bangladeshi people were killed in a military and militia campaign that has since been recognized as a genocide. Millions of refugees poured into India, straining an already exhausted system. As a Bengali himself, Shankar wanted to plan a benefit concert to raise awareness and funds for the refugees. He hoped that one of his famous friends, perhaps Harrison or actor Peter Sellers, might be willing to introduce the show and help bring in a little money—maybe $25,000 if they were lucky. When Shankar told Harrison about the unfolding humanitarian crisis, the guitarist immediately volunteered his services. With a surge of Beatles-learnt self-confidence, Harrison suggested that they raise the stakes and release an accompanying film and album. “Straightaway I thought of the John Lennon aspect of it, which was: film it, and make a record of it, and, you know, let’s make a million dollars,” he later said. Things moved quickly from there. Harrison spent the following weeks planning the concert and enlisting friends to perform. After he consulted with an astrologer—as one does—it was decided that the Concert for Bangladesh would take place on August 1 at Madison Square Garden. There would be two shows, an afternoon set and an evening set, both of which were recorded for the album and film. Tickets were all $10 or less and sold out in a few hours. At the top of each performance, Harrison emerged to address the audience. With Shankar, he implored them to listen to the performance of Indian music that opened the show with concentration and respect. “Through our music, we would like you to feel the agony and also the pain and lot of sad happenings in Bangladesh and also the refugees who have come to India,” Shankar explained. Their instructions were prescient: After the musicians—Shankar on sitar, Ali Akbar Khan on sarod, Kamala Chakravarty on tambura, and Alla Rakha on tabla—tuned their instruments, the audience burst into applause. “Thank you, if you appreciate the tuning so much, I hope you will enjoy the playing more,” Shankar dryly remarked. With that, Shankar and Ali Akbar Khan launch into “Bangla Dhun,” an emotional instrumental piece that draws on Bengali folk melodies. The duo’s rapport is instinctive and familial, having played together since they were young adults; Khan was both Shankar’s brother-in-law and the son of his guru. The two maestros begin the piece with a brief alap, an improvisational, contemplative exploration of the raga’s melodic possibilities. Chakravarty’s tambura drone and Rakha’s tabla join as the players transition into a medium-tempo gat, the more structured portion of the composition. About halfway through, as the pace increases to a breakneck drut laya, Shankar and Khan’s playing is so heated it seems to erupt into fireworks. Up next was Harrison, who was admittedly nervous to lead the show. “Personally, I prefer to be a part of a band, but...it was just something that we had to do in order to get the money and we had to do it quick so I had to put myself out there and hope I’d get a few friends to come and support me,” he said at a July 27 press conference. When the lights came back on, it was clear how modest he was being: He had recruited a 24-piece band that included Ringo Starr, Eric Clapton, Leon Russell, Billy Preston, Klaus Voormann, the Apple band Badfinger, a horn section, a seven-piece soul choir, and more. All agreed to perform without a fee.  As the concert’s organizer and main attraction, Harrison was faced with a decision: fade respectfully into the background, or own the spotlight and put on a good show. From the opening riff of “Wah-Wah,” Harrison’s fiery declaration that he was done being creatively stifled by his former bandmates, it’s clear that he chose the latter. Looking like a sharp-dressed wizard in a white two-piece suit with the Om symbol embroidered on the lapel, Harrison exudes a radiant maturity; it’s staggering to remember that he was only 28 years old. The Concert for Bangladesh also marked the first time that Harrison performed songs from All Things Must Pass, his triple-album opus from the year prior. Though it was easy to poke fun at Harrison’s spiritual transformation and embrace of Indian philosophy, his earnest belief is undeniable here. During “My Sweet Lord” and “Awaiting on You All,” two of All Things Must Pass’ most overtly religious songs, you can hear his yearning for connection with a higher power reach the rafters of MSG. Both songs espouse the belief of Harrison’s beloved Hare Krishnas, that through “chanting the names of the lord...you’ll be free,” and the gospel choir and Preston’s high-voltage organ playing heighten their joyousness. Harrison’s Beatles hits are unleashed from their studio restraints, expanding into their fullest forms. The acoustic “Here Comes the Sun” is as comforting as a warm soak. “While My Guitar Gently Weeps” sounds like Harrison and Clapton—his dear friend and romantic rival, who was deep in the throes of heroin addiction— exorcising their demons in real time. “Something” is bursting at the seams with passion—for another human, a divine being, or for the all-consuming feeling of devotion itself. Following Harrison’s desire to avoid the center of attention, the concert was arranged like a revue, with performances from the star intermixed with showcases from the backing players. Preston’s rendition of his gospel-rock song “That’s the Way God Planned It” is particularly electrifying, and culminates with the keyboardist leaping to his feet and running to the front of the stage to boogie in exaltation. Aside from whether or not Clapton would make it through the night, the concert’s other big question mark involved one Robert Zimmerman. After his mythic motorcycle accident in 1966, Dylan retreated from his platform as the conscience of a generation, performing live only rarely. “Right up till he came on the stage, I didn’t know if he was going to come,” Harrison later said. His song selection was also surprising. Maybe he was moved by the occasion, or maybe he wanted to do something special on behalf of his pal Harrison, but instead of playing cuts from recent albums like New Morning, he played long-dormant folk classics like “Blowin’ in the Wind” and “A Hard Rain’s a-Gonna Fall.” There’s not a hint of cynicism or ennui in his nasally voice as he sings of forgotten souls and conjures visions of wastelands; it’s the raw intensity of a poet crystallized in amber. In a few years, Dylan would step back into the spotlight and onto the hamster wheel of constant transformation, but the man caught on tape here is luminous in his stillness. The concert closed with a performance of Harrison’s recent charity single “Bangla Desh,” often regarded as the first of its kind. Harrison begins by offering some narrative context: “My friend came to me with sadness in his eye/He told me that he wanted help before his country dies...Now I’m asking all of you to help us save some lives.” Then, with the full emotional weight of his backing band—and, in the film, a jarring montage of starving children—behind him, Harrison starts hollering the one word that he hopes his audience takes away from the performance: “Bangla DESH!” Concise, direct, and with a killer saxophone solo, “Bangla Desh” makes a convincing argument: Yes, the ’60s were done. The Manson murders terrified a nation, Altamont crashed and burned, Joplin and Hendrix were dead, and the Vietnam War raged on. Fear and doubt had poisoned the well of idealism. But right here, right now, Harrison suggests, you can honor some of the decade’s lost promises by lending a hand to help a fellow man. The Concert for Bangladesh was a clear and immediate success. Ticket sales raised around $243,000 for UNICEF, nearly ten times Shankar’s initial expectation. Overnight, the name Bangladesh and its people’s plight became known to the world, which was the sitarist and organizer’s priority. But the celebratory bubble burst quickly. The album was beset by delays and issues with taxes and performance rights; proceeds from its sale were held by the IRS for years. “It was uncharted territory, the scale of it,” Apple employee Jonathan Clyde told The Guardian years later. “The money did eventually reach Bangladesh, although perhaps not in time to help the refugees at that point.” The general public was unconcerned with these issues, however, and The Concert for Bangladesh topped the charts and won a Grammy for Album of the Year. The Concert for Bangladesh’s successes—its camaraderie, humility, and triumphant money-raising—established the framework for large-scale benefit concerts as we know them today. Fundraising magnate Bob Geldof reportedly reached out to Harrison for advice when planning 1985’s multi-continental Live Aid event. (Harrison’s advice: “Do your homework.”) With star-studded lineups that ensure broad news coverage, benefit concerts continue to be an effective (and popular) way for celebrities to raise money and awareness for a cause. At the same time, it’s easy to feel cynical about these occasions: A pop star gets to play philanthropist for a day before returning to their life of privilege. Conceptually and practically, the “benefit concert” is a short-term commitment to long-term, complex problems; and when it comes to raising money for international crises, there’s usually a whiff of white Western saviorism in the mix. And as the Concert for Bangladesh revealed, getting donations to the people who need them is not as simple as it may seem. Still, the Concert for Bangladesh was a musical triumph and a momentous collaborative effort. In 1972, alongside Allen Klein—the late-era Beatles manager who was partially responsible for the concert’s financial disarray—Shankar and Harrison were awarded UNICEF’s “Child Is the Father of Man” award for their fundraising efforts. Shankar, initially so skeptical of “Norwegian Wood,” had come to view his collaborator as family. Harrison, he later said, was “my student, my brother, my son, all combined.” If Harrison’s earliest interest in Indian music had involved some trendy fetishism, The Concert for Bangladesh demonstrated that his commitment—to the music and the people themselves—had blossomed into something deep and profound.

Live in Maui,The Jimi Hendrix Experience,by: Andy Beta,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5fb7f2017157507b781db93a/1:1/w_160/Live%20In%20Maui_The%20Jimi%20Hendrix%20Experience.jpg,2020-11-28 06:00:00,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/the-jimi-hendrix-experience-live-in-maui/,Experience HendrixLegacy,"In early spring of 1970, Jimi Hendrix’s manager Michael Jefferey convinced Warner Bros. executives to dump $1 million into his client’s name. Half of it went to finish Hendrix’s state-of-the-art Electric Lady Studios. And half went to Jefferey himself, intended to kickstart his new career as a film producer with Hendrix providing the soundtrack. That half-million was thrown into the money pit that was Rainbow Bridge, a piece of hippie drivel by Warhol acolyte Chuck Wein that glommed onto surfing and tai chi, casting a bunch of amateurs and Hawaiian locals. As the film production spun out of control, Jefferey pitched an overburdened Hendrix on Hawaii:  two weeks of relaxation and two shows tacked onto the end of his Cry of Love Tour. It would be a ”vibratory color sound experiment,” as Wein spun it, with the audience segmented by astrological sign. Hendrix wanted no part of the debacle, but nevertheless found himself on a stage hastily erected near the Haleakalā volcano on a ranch in Olinda. It made for a stunning tableaux, but gale-force winds left the band struggling to stand upright, much less hear themselves onstage. It would also be Hendrix’s penultimate concert in the United States. Six weeks later, he was dead. While the two concerts were filmed and recorded for Rainbow Bridge, the finished product, so dependent on his presence, only featured a baffling 17 minutes of footage of Hendrix, and the album of the same name featured none of the audio. Thanks to those winds, drummer Mitch Mitchell had to re-record all of his parts in the studio. Live in Maui presents both concerts for the first time, along with an accompanying documentary. For a posthumous discography that has seen numerous recordings from that final tour officially reissued (Berkeley, Atlanta, Isle of Wight), Live in Maui has Hendrix performing the near-miracle of elevating above an earthly debacle to offer a glimpse of transcendence. That last tour—and Maui in particular—captures the myriad forces pulling at the guitar god during what Robert Christgau called “the excited, spiritual, bummed-out sprawl of his final year.” A headlining rock act constantly dealing with slapdash festival sound while also trying to build a studio to his exacting standards and finish a new album, Hendrix was pushing towards weaving in more Black musical strands while bogged down by his primarily white audiences’ expectations. They wanted “Purple Haze,” “Fire,” and “Foxy Lady” for the thousandth time, while Hendrix was seeking beyond those increasingly threadbare numbers towards something funky, if not yet fully formed. The band reflected that divide, a hybrid Experience of longtime English drummer Mitchell and Hendrix’s fellow Chitlin’ Circuit survivor and Band of Gypsys bassist Billy Cox. Together, the trio were working through those not-yet-settled new songs in real time. Incandescent blues numbers and hurried run-throughs of the hits sit alongside very loose jams that stumble about, shuffle, nearly dissolve, and then suddenly shoot skyward. The first set boasts slightly better clarity, the second set coming across more muffled. But the wider canvas of these two sets offers him a freedom he didn’t always have on that tour. Rather than frontload the hits, the trio gets to take their time, folding in a dozen new songs that had yet to appear on any album. Maybe that extended time in Maui eased Hendrix’s mind. So the set opens with “Hey Baby (New Rising Sun),” rather than close with it, as they often had on previous dates. What might have been the title track of the next Jimi Hendrix record blooms with a gorgeous, iridescent guitar tone like a sentient waterfall. Effortless guitar heroics abound, from the chopped “Sunshine of Your Love” chords sprinkled into “Fire” to the “Star Spangled Banner” quote teased in the last moments of “Purple Haze.” When it seems like the rarely performed “Villanova Junction” is about to dissolve into silence, it pivots into a storming take on “Ezy Rider.” Even on the big hits duly rendered here, Hendrix at some point in each song hits a frequency akin to a serotonin release, reminding you why his music is equivocated to the euphoric highs of drugs or sex. Or just go near the two-minute mark of Maui’s version of “Voodoo Child (Slight Return),” when his guitar seems to be shooting down from a mile above the stage. “I kept thinking a spaceship was landing,” remembers one film cast member in the documentary, and it doesn’t sound like stoner hyperbole. The seeds of Afrofuturism reside in this  gravity-defying tone, yet Jimi was equally profound and transcendent burning through a slow blues. “Red House” appears here in a peculiarly short but still potent version. But it’s Hendrix’s lashing of “Hear My Train A-Comin’” that staggers: sorrowful, unbowed, and pissed, his guitar obliterating all in its path. Blame the messiness of his estate in the wake of his tragic death, or confounding number of posthumous compilations and concert recordings, but is there an icon of the boomer era who has been needlessly diminished like Hendrix in the 21st century? “Jimi Hendrix looms large among those lapses in our collective consciousness,” cultural critic Greg Tate writes. “His absence from a general celebration of African American heroes is both absurd and symptomatic of a more widespread problem: cultural and political amnesia...Hendrix [remains] one of the most misunderstood and misapprehended.” A Black genius plying a once wholly Black music before a now peculiarly white world of rock (the footage of a crowd composed primarily of blissed-out blond flower children before the man himself appears seems even more absurd in the present), Hendrix paved the way for every subsequent and successful Black visionary to follow in his wake—think Stevie, George, Marvin, Prince. Live in Maui sees the man pushing beyond the boundaries of rock towards something new and untenable. Maybe it was right to call it “a vibratory color sound experiment.”","Near the end of his life, Jimi Hendrix recorded two concerts in Hawaii for an ill-fated film. A new reissue reveals him elevating above an earthly debacle to offer a glimpse of transcendence.

Copycat Killer EP,Phoebe Bridgers,by: Vrinda Jagota,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5faab74406efd255af1f0bfd/1:1/w_160/Phoebe-Bridgers.jpg,2020-11-27 06:00:00,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/phoebe-bridgers-copycat-killer-ep/,Dead Oceans,"During the hellish week that we waited for the results of the U.S. presidential election, Phoebe Bridgers promised that if Trump lost, she would cover “Iris” by the Goo Goo Dolls. Her pledge felt partly like earnest emotional bargaining and partly like a joke, but when Bridgers, joined by Maggie Rogers, released the cover the following week, it was clear she took the challenge seriously: Bridgers’ “Iris” transformed the alt-rock power anthem into a twangy, hushed plea for belonging. Her cover felt a bit like a teaser for Copycat Killer, a new EP of reworked songs from this summer’s excellent album Punisher. It would have been easy to replicate the plucky folk of her debut, 2017’s Stranger in the Alps, but instead, she and arranger and string player Rob Moose (who has worked with Bon Iver, Taylor Swift, and FKA twigs) reimagine four songs as devastating orchestral arrangements. Like an auditory bokeh effect, Copycat Killer places Bridgers’ voice in dramatic focus, causing the emotional heft of the songs to balloon. Excavated from layers of watery distortion, every lyric lingers in the air as she sings about losing friends, searching for signs of an afterlife, resisting emotional vampires, and managing her savior complex. The strings elevate the vocal drama, swooping and majestic one moment, percussive and anxious the next. Without Punisher’s twinkling production flourishes and array of friends’ voices, there are no distractions. Listening to Copycat Killer all at once feels like waking up from an evening nap or entering a movie theater in daylight and leaving in the dark. You’re nourished but also disoriented, limbs tingling as they recalibrate to the outside world. “Kyoto,” originally written as a ballad, is most beautifully transformed. The Punisher version was propelled by a whimsical trumpet section and synth line, mirroring Bridgers’ restless lyrics about travelling in Japan but missing California. On this version, her gossamer vocals bring other aspects of the song to the forefront: the father who forgets his son’s birthday, the flailing attempts to stop loving someone you know will continue to hurt you. On “Savior Complex,” another highlight, the original string section expands effortlessly, cellos filling the song with foreboding. The final words—“All the bad dreams that you hide/Show me yours”—feel more menacing than empathetic. Bridgers’ songs are so devastating because she plays both hero and villain, creating a Möbius strip of virtues (like selflessness) that twist into flaws (like savior complexes). Rarely is there a feeling of catharsis or righteousness, especially on Copycat Killer, where the paralyzing angst and introspection feels so stark. Yet the EP ends on a quietly hopeful note. After setting a crisis of faith to heart-pounding strings on a new version of “Chinese Satellite,” Bridgers closes with “Punisher,” an ode to her idol, Elliott Smith. Though delivered with the same agonizing intimacy as the rest, at its heart, it’s a song about connection. “What if I told you I feel like I know you/But we never met,” she ventures cautiously, finding reassurance in Smith’s generosity and talent without ever having witnessed it firsthand—the very definition of faith. Meaning doesn’t always come from institutions or scriptures, but from the heroes we pick for ourselves.","The songwriter’s new EP reimagines four tracks from her recent album Punisher with devastating orchestral arrangements that bring her voice into dramatic focus.

Sin Miedo (del Amor y Otros Demonios) ∞,Kali Uchis,by: Jenzia Burgos,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5fb551797e818f7ad25ead3c/1:1/w_160/Sin%20Miedo%20(del%20Amor%20y%20Otros%20Demonios)%20%E2%88%9E_Kali%20Uchis.jpg,2020-11-25 06:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/kali-uchis-sin-miedo-del-amor-y-otros-demonios/,EMIInterscope,"At the end of her second album, Kali Uchis invokes an angel, earthside, having strayed from the sky. This divine being, as she depicts it, is unafraid and unburdened of its duties; “A nadie le debo,” Uchis sings. It owes no one—and neither does she. This epiphany marks Sin Miedo (del Amor y Otros Demonios) ∞, or Without Fear (of Love and Other Demons) ∞, as her most honest work yet. The 26-year-old is a little dreamier, a little bolder, and a lot freer than she was two years ago when she released her genre-roving debut Isolation, a record that cemented her place as pop’s misfit siren. While working on it, though, Uchis felt like she had to “prove” herself to the world, so the polymath corralled a crew of bigwig artists and producers—including Tyler, the Creator, Bootsy Collins, and Gorillaz—to bolster her already singular work. Fittingly, on Sin Miedo, Uchis dares to trust herself more. She pares down the guest list, opting for feature production by Puerto Rican hitmaker Tainy and a smattering of artists. Her voice, still thick and sultry, looms larger in the mix. And her affinity for jukebox jams sees her turning to the past again—but instead of only containing the funky breaks and trippy jazz stylings that Anglo-market listeners have come to recognize her music for, Uchis sharpens the spotlight on her bilingual, binational Latinx repertoire. She’s consigned her tragic Edie Sedgwick avatar to oblivion; this is Uchis in ’90s mami glam, grown as fuck at her Friday night perreo parties and Saturday morning limpiezas, ready to recover reggaetón and boleros for the new age. Some of the sweetest flashbacks on Sin Miedo are actually covers of classic tracks, relaunched with pithy little missives worthy of a telenovela script (for what it’s worth, Uchis has always wanted to be a director). On opener “la luna enamorada,” an update of a 1960s bolero once made popular by the Cuban doo-wop group Los Zafiros, Uchis quips, “¿Y tú qué pensaste, que yo me iba a echar a morir?” (“And what did you think, that I was going to roll over and die?”). Uchis even nails a glimmering tribute to the Queen of Latin Soul, La Lupe, plugging her tour-favorite rendition of “Qué te Pedí” in as an interlude. For just under two minutes, Uchis sings with a gauzy gemido, aching with devotion to a selfish lover whose demands remain impossible to meet. Sometimes, even bad bitches get trapped. But like la gran tirana before her, Uchis remembers the power of a good kiss-off—no matter how heartbreaking it may be. Standout “vaya con dios” evinces this most; the track turns the tender Spanish sendoff “go with God” into a reluctant lover’s exile with all the cinematic grandeur of a 007 theme. “Se que estoy perdiendo,” she admits, “pero el juego no ha concluido.” She knows what she’s losing, but the game isn’t over. When one lover goes, there’s always a better one standing by—and it’s Uchis herself. While she has brought this kind of confidence into her songs before, Sin Miedo boasts her femme supremacy in ways more pining and authoritative. “Si me vas a hablar háblame con respeto” (“If we are going to talk, talk to me with respect”), she purrs on the indomitably hot “te pongo mal (prendelo),” featuring the steamrolling reggaetón duo Jowell & Randy. It’s a sentiment reggaetonera Ivy Queen made famous years ago on her dancefloor-consent anthem “Quiero Bailar,” but clearly bears reminding, like it does again on lead single “¡aquí yo mando!” Over a nasty bass, Uchis confirms she’s the one calling the shots, while fellow DMV renegade Rico Nasty spits Spanish bars that Uchis helped pen. This boss moment wouldn’t be the same if Uchis had doubted her instincts. She held steady, even after assuming that her Spanish-language project might alienate some fans. Upon releasing her penultimate track “la luz (Fín)” featuring Latin trap upstart Jhay Cortez as a single in October, she tweeted her stance: “today i drop another song in spanish which i know means another day of disappointment for my english speaking fans who do not wish to make the attempt to listen to music in languages they can’t understand.” Sin Miedo proves it really is their loss.","On her first Spanish-language LP, the Colombian American singer eclipses crossover appeal with a moody, hopscotch pop take on the boleros, reggaetón, and Latin soul of her youth.

ALIAS EP,Shygirl ,by: Ashley Bardhan,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5fbe75bee7768c9556990624/1:1/w_160/shygirl_alias_album_art.jpg,2020-11-25 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/shygirl-alias-ep/,Because Music,"In the remarkably unsexy year of 2020, you wouldn’t expect an artist to evoke the glowing grime of a club so exactly, but Shygirl manages to do it with her latest EP, ALIAS. Similar to 2018’s Cruel Practice, ALIAS finds Shygirl spitting vulgarities like they’re her typical weekend plans, aided by oily bass lines from producers like longtime collaborator Sega Bodega. This time, though, Shygirl’s voice carries a bit more over the muck; the production is bolder and more focused, like throwing a sharpened knife at a wall rather than a smattering of darts. In general, this EP is about fucking. Shygirl playfully contemplates her parents’ failures in her upbringing as she wonders if you “like what you see,” offers her freakiness “on the bed/on the floor,” and name-drops “your daddy,” who’s calling her on the phone right now. It all might come across as gaudy if it wasn’t so fun. Shygirl’s delivery has a dark-horse quality to it; her voice is buttery soft, but she handles lyrics with venomous precision, knowing when to bite and when to soften. “Bawdy” is a good example of this skill—Shygirl begins with sharp commands—“grind it right/arch back/hand to thigh”—then practically sighs through the chorus, telling you to “come and get it” while a bursting synth line that sounds like a much hotter “Party Up (Up in Here)” loops. She tends to favor murmuring bass and glimmering synth lines, reminiscent of Amnesia Scanner or the bubblegum bass of Slayyyter. But Shygirl’s music skews darker, heavier, and oozes a very specific kind of sexuality, the kind that usually gets scared out of women by seventh-grade health classes and angry men on the internet. It’s self-indulgent, and it revolves around Shygirl—her body, how nasty she is, what she wants you to do—not any particular lover, and least of all, romance. She offers up brief glimpses into a glamorously dirty life, detailing nights spent “arse up, titty out” and riding in a “fast car/past all the city lights.” There’s an understated line in “Slime,” a song that lives up to its name, slippery with a taunting trap loop running through it, that encapsulates the way that Shygirl so perfectly evokes party culture. The 808 bass speeds up, preparing the listener for the moment it drops, and as soon as it does, Shygirl says matter-of-factly from her gut, “She came to fuck.” The line nearly made me laugh the first time I heard it, it’s so blunt yet so vague. We are never given any information as to who “she” is other than the suggestion that she’s “a baddie,” but with Shygirl’s delivery and the track’s grumbling, slithering production, you can’t help but feel like you know exactly what she means. She’s talking about your first night out after a breakup, or when you got dressed up to find a suitable enough ex-frat bro at your local bar, or when you’re in the middle of a sweaty room, you’re dancing with all your friends, and you think you’ll never feel sad again. “She came to fuck” energy defies gender or context—it’s the concept of having a single goal and the gall to believe that you’ll either achieve it or be completely unfazed if you don’t. It contains the driving forces behind a good party: shamelessness and debauchery. In a year of no touching, these euphoric party moments feel far away, but Shygirl’s endearing hedonism brings that sweaty room a bit closer. ALIAS is a glittering light, a portal into the future and everything you might do.","The South East London singer’s latest EP is a glittering portal into the future that offers up brief glimpses into a glamorously dirty life.

Good News,Megan Thee Stallion,by: Mankaprr Conteh,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5fb55b914cb304ce01ca1308/1:1/w_160/Good%20News_Megan%20Thee%20Stallion.jpg,2020-11-24 06:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/megan-thee-stallion-good-news/,1501 Certified 300,"Bullets ravage bodies, and often, the work to mend the injuries they cause are as destructive. Rib cages are cracked open. Victims are sometimes intubated without anesthesia. Limbs are amputated. The instruments surgeons use in the operating room look like they’re made for installing a hardwood floor, not fixing a body. If you’re fortunate enough to survive being shot, your body could be changed forever. You could be paralyzed. You could have to poop into a bag through a hole in your stomach for the rest of your life. One Philadelphia man had to live with a wide-open abdominal cavity, rendering his intestines visible for 11 months. This says nothing of the emotional trauma of being shot, particularly as a 25-year-old Black woman with no parents but millions of people watching her, some of whom believe she lied about or instigated her attack. Considering the range of disabilities survivors can face, it’s a little miraculous that rapper Megan Thee Stallion could twerk through song after song at a live-streamed virtual concert 48 days after being shot in the foot, allegedly by rapper Tory Lanez. So on her latest release Good News, after some scathing record-straightening on “Shots Fired” over the same sample Biggie used in his alleged Tupac taunt “Who Shot Ya?” and more nebulous grievance-airing (fake friends and pesky men) over the New Orleans bounce of “Circles,” Megan turns her attention to more pressing matters. She goes from reducing her assailant’s bullets to mere pellets to ribbing someone who she’s fucked so good he’ll want to wear her hoodie. Once she moves on from this summer’s shooting, she rarely looks back. Her beats are more playful and poppier than ever, but anchored in rap and R&B staples. Her rapping is still razor sharp, littered with punchlines and barbs that make your ears perk and jaw drop. Her disposition is unexpectedly chipper. In a year in which a virus, a man, and a cadre of misogynistic spectators could have killed her, Good News is a celebration of life. When the album ends with the massively successful “Savage Remix,” plus singles “Girls in the Hood,” and “Don’t Stop,” it feels exultant, like confetti falling from the ceiling for an encore at Madison Square Garden. The 14 tracks that precede them are varied—slinky and sexy, dance-routine ready, or throbbing with 808s—which makes sense, given there are more than 14 producers helming Good News, compared to Megan’s usual two, Lil Ju and Juicy J. Here, the pair is joined by high profile beat-makers like Tay Keith and Mustard, as well as Dutch upstart Avedon, who comes out swinging on standout “What’s New.” The producers’ diverse approaches are unified by their optimism, a novel tone for Megan. The pulse of the album is steadily upbeat, which might appeal to the casual hip-hop fans she’s collected through the viral “Savage Remix” more than those from Make It Hot, Tina Snow, and Fever. Smartly smuggled towards the end of the new releases (almost as if not to distract) is “Don’t Rock Me to Sleep,” a bold sing-along experiment with the same Day-Glo airy synths that Dua Lipa and The Weeknd use to evoke ’80s nostalgia. It’s the kind of song that any of today’s pop stars could make, and it’s ill-fitting on Megan. The similarly poppy follow-up “Outside” works better, maybe because it’s tougher, which feels like a more natural pose for her. “I ain’t for the streets, ’cause bitch, I am the street,” she huffs. Even as Megan experiments with sounds that appeal to a wider audience, her hip-hop traditionalism remains undeniable. Webbie, Trina, Adina Howard, Juvenile, Naughty By Nature and Eazy-E are sampled throughout, and she does each one justice with her relentless rapping. Megan’s mythos as daughter of a Texas MC—conditioned for the game, and rising to prominence as a fierce freestyler—is now rap lore. She’s in her prime on Good News. “Freaky bitch, I do this/Suck it like I'm toothless,” she offers on one song. “Bitch, touch them toes/Bitch, get that dough/If you in love with your body, bitch, take off your clothes!” she spits in staccato on “Work That.” It’s not that Megan’s raps are profoundly intimate—on Fever, she reminded us that that’s not why she’s here. (“They wanna know ’bout me/They say, ‘Tell me your story’/Only thing you need to know is I’m in love with the money,” she says). It’s that after four years in the game, she can still make bars about good sex, hot girls, and unwaivering confidence sound new. A handful of hooks scattered across Good News feel insidiously simple but strategic—they’ll stay in your head and roll off your tongue. “Body-ody-ody-ody-ody-ody-ody-ody,” goes one. Her verses though, are like top-shelf spirits, smooth and biting. Whether she’s referencing island-exclusive cognac on a dancehall song with Popcaan (“Intercourse”) or trading disses with City Girls (“Do It on the Tip”), her wit and delivery is nonpareil. This album has the most features of her career and when she gets a rap assist—like on “Movie” with Lil Durk or “Cry Baby” with DaBaby—she does her hardest work, fueled by collaboration (or more likely, competition). In popularity and proficiency, Megan is ahead of her peers across gender. Even with its smattering of stars, Megan Thee Stallion unequivocally decided her debut album would be hers. Two and a half months after the shooting, her alleged assailant dedicated a release bearing his name to slandering hers, his rage swallowing him whole. Good News, however, is about her own agency. “I still ain’t doing nothing I don’t wanna do!” she barks on “Sugar Baby.” “Don’t fuck me like that, fuck me like this!” she commands on “Cry Baby.” Like always, she locates her power in the bedroom, the mirror, and the recording booth. But unlike her previous works, with their dark and fiery undertones, what she has finally cemented as a studio album bears the victory of spars with death. Two years before Megan was born, Lucille Clifton penned a poem for this very triumph: come celebrate
with me that everyday
something has tried to kill me
and has failed.","Amid a pandemic, and while recovering from a gunshot wound, the superstar rapper made an album that purposefully celebrates life. Her beats are playful, and her rapping is as sharp as ever.

My Life,Mary J. Blige,by: Alfred Soto,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5fb55a477e818f7ad25ead41/1:1/w_160/My%20Life_Mary%20J.%20Blige.jpg,2020-11-24 06:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/mary-j-blige-my-life/,GeffenUME,"In 1994, the self-styled Queen of Hip-Hop Soul understood she had competition. TLC melded their bubblegum instincts to post-New Jack Swing beats. En Vogue flirted with rock guitar workouts. Whitney Houston was already a statue in the park admired for her architecture but taken for granted. Yet thanks to persistence and flexibility, Blige remains influential because she never assumed the masochism that became her lodestar requires sad, airless albums. Her work is morose, not numb. No matter how intensely she abases herself before lovers who don’t tire of leaving or underestimating her, Blige’s flinty egoism triumphs. No multi-platinum R&B singer has used the language of self-help as sword and shield better. Sandwiched between the buoyant debut What’s the 411? (1992) and the austere, inevitable divadom of Share My World (1997), My Life positions Blige as heiress to an R&B fortune, thanks in large part to the sampling acumen of Bad Boy’s Hitmen team members Chucky Thompson and Sean “Puffy” Combs. There's Isaac Hayes and Barry White, Roy Ayres and Slick Rick—history as group therapy. These ancestral voices reassure but offer subtle contrasts, too. The title track interpolates the hook and ascending three-note keyboard from Ayers’ 1976 “Everybody Loves the Sunshine,” creating a healthy tension between Blige’s blue mood and the sample’s shafts of light. On the other hand, “Mary Jane (All Night Long)” finds her and the source material in harmony: by brightening Rick James’ original synth-flute line, Thompson and Combs give Blige the chance for some old school scatting over the outro. A ’90s fly girl hearkening back to Ella Fitzgerald over a Reagan-era jam, Blige had learned how to contextualize her melancholy. The anniversary edition confirms the novelty if not radicalism of the Hitmen’s approach: R&B as tradition and living history. Hayes and White, after all, had long stopped scoring pop crossovers; here was a Black woman artist modernizing them as part of glistening triple-platinum product. The presence of Smif-N-Wessun and LL Cool J on the second disc’s remixes attest to her dialogue with hip-hop; Blige had no interest in settling for Anita Baker’s market share. And who knows how many young listeners gave rap a try after Combs and Thompson wove Notorious B.I.G. and Method Man’s “The What” into a transformed “I’m Goin’ Down”? While pairing artists for the sake of consolidating streams is the way the business works in the 21st century, the guest spots expose My Life’s often ho-hum songwriting. Belters like Blige rely on audience submission: Admire the voice, ignore the material. Tensile, brassy, and confident, her mezzo-soprano has little warmth. She’s stingy with shows of compassion. Less gifted predecessors compressed Blige’s whole career into five minutes, as Karyn White did with “Superwoman.” When Blige out-sings on tracks like “Don’t Go,” her technique strands her. Indeed, she has less in common with her soul forebears than with Annie Lennox, also blessed with pipes so formidable that she sings like a lead guitar, bending and stretching notes on material that, fortunately, didn’t stint on tackiness and depended on shows of vocal derring-do. Blige isn’t tacky; she’s incapable of bad taste, which sometimes cuts into her sense of fun. To listen to “I’m Goin’ Down” in sequence after the torpid “I Never Wanna Live Without You” is to wonder how a covers album of classic-R&B deep cuts recast as manifestos of self-reliance might’ve played. On the plus side, Combs hadn’t yet turned sampling into the mechanical Puff-ery of the late-’90 No Way Out era; he lets Blige tiptoe over the vocal melody of “You Bring Me Joy” without the rhythm track from White’s “It’s Ecstasy When You Lay Down Next to Me” overcoming her. After My Life strengthened her commercial appeal, Blige embraced traditional feminine roles on duets. Male artists acted as foils. On the remix of “You’re All I Need to Get By,” she plays Tammi Terrell to Method Man’s Marvin Gaye. She then scored her biggest solo pop hit to date, the Babyface-composed “Not Gon’ Cry” from the Waiting to Exhale soundtrack; while no different from other performances of survivor-hood, the specificity of the songwriting suggested Blige’s capabilities when paired with the right collaborator. Ghostface Killah called her up for “All That I Got Is You,” a grim remembrance of things past. Energized, Blige recorded two of her best albums back-to-back. Mary (1999) perfects My Life’s old-is-new ethos, with Lauryn Hill, Aretha Franklin, and Elton John as collaborators and inspiration. She may have lied when titling its follow-up No More Drama (2001), but, oh, what drama—after 9-11, Blige’s dismissing hateration and holleration on “Family Affair” worked like aspirin. If she could survive, hey, there was hope for the rest of us. My Life, though occasionally tedious, remains a lovable album; its flaws deepen its charms. The album points toward the late 2000s when Blige found simpatico partners in Bryan-Michael Cox for 2005’s The Breakthrough (its megahit “Be Without You” is a sleeker, shattering variant on “I Never Wanna...” ) and Stargate for 2007’s Growing Pains. For her last trick on My Life, she anchors “Be Happy” to Curtis Mayfield’s “You’re So Good to Me,” its slap-bass front and center. “All I really want is to be happy,” she repeats over its seven-minute groove—a prayer, promise, and earned affirmation.","Twenty-six years after its release, the R&B stalwart’s occasionally tedious second album remains a lovable record whose flaws only deepen its charms.

Mt. Marci,Roc Marciano,by: Dylan Green,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5fb56a7909ecad2c0af1dc50/1:1/w_160/mt%20marci_roc%20marciano.jpg,2020-11-24 06:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/roc-marciano-mt-marci/,MarciArt That Kills,"Roc Marciano knows his influence looms large over rap and is tired of waiting for the rest of the world to catch up. He’s said as much in interviews and in bars: “What good is the credit if you can’t get it while you alive?,” he growls on “Tom Chambers,” a song from his last studio album Marcielago. Released in 2019, Marcielago is the closest the New York rapper-producer has come to explicitly staking a claim to his legacy on record. The impact of his minimalist production style and surrealist pimp chronicles was an open secret within the modern hip-hop underground and between power players like JAY-Z and ?uestlove alike for years. His foundational 2010 solo debut Marcberg celebrated its 10th anniversary this past May and, following Marcielago’s chest-thumping, long overdue flowers were delivered. Marciano’s own faith in the value of his art is well-documented. He’s been selling his albums at premium prices through his website since 2017’s Rosebudd’s Revenge, circumventing streaming services for at least two weeks at a time to reap what he sees fit. Mt. Marci, his tenth studio album, is no exception. If Marcielago was the Thanos snap on his decade of underground hip-hop innovation, then Mt. Marci is him celebrating the fruits of his labor the best way he knows how: by putting his head down and continuing to churn out colorful wordplay over finely chopped loops. Many of the album’s beats sound as though they've been ripped from the deleted scenes of a Melvin Van Peebles film, with Marciano as its slant rhyme-spitting antihero. “Where I’m from, hammers ring/Can’t be mishandling things/I’m not a square but yeah, my hands is clean,” he says on “Baby Powder.” On “Pimps Don’t Wear Rabbits,” he manages to take something as simple as putting on jewelry and make it sound superhuman: “My diamond chain’s a climate changer/I’m playin’ with weather.” The worlds he creates are rich with mise en scene. Marciano’s humor is underrated. Rap thrives on hyperbole, and while many rappers sell their otherworldly tales with their chests puffed out, Marciano moves in the exact opposite direction. His deadpan delivery makes his metaphors even funnier, like a mob boss stumbling into an open mic night at a comedy club. He doesn’t just cook cocaine well, he came up “scraping the bowl like an eight-year-old.” His sex is so wild it’s only comparable to the GS Boyz’ Stanky Legg dance. He claims his haters play his music in secret like they’re watching porn. Because he never alters the grain of his voice, his jokes slide by without losing the feel of the ceramic bowl or the glow of a computer screen in the dark. As funny as Marciano can be, his world is still largely a grim one. The close calls and brief flashes of life that dot his songs—images of an addict smoking out of a Country Time lemonade can, glimpses of a father who was “a wino but he was fly tho”—balance his cartoonish eye for detail with pathos. “Two diamond crucifixes I wore for all the times that I’ve been double-crossed,” he remembers over the elegant piano keys of the absurdly titled “Steel Vagina.” Moments like these illuminate the person underneath the white fur and cream-colored suede Yeezys. Whatever mood Marciano is trying to convey across Mt. Marci, the beats help steady his directorial lens. Per usual, Marciano handles the bulk of the album’s production, crafting all but one-and-a-half of the album’s 16 songs (“Downtown 81” was made by Seattle polymath Jake One and the first half of “Baby Powder” was made by Pro Era stalwart Chuck Strangers). Songs like “Wheat 40s” and “Steel Vagina” are vintage Marci, driven by pristine, barely embellished loops that glimmer with chandelier luster. As tight as he is within his comfort zone, Marciano experiments to great results. He’s largely abandoned his trademark lack of percussion, with the majority of the songs featuring drums of some sort. “Covid Cough” turns a guitar wail and off-kilter drum patterning into the wonkiest beat he’s ever created, accented by a fiery ScHoolboy Q verse (“I got nothin’ to prove/I sold 20, made 20, I’m in the shadow of who?”) ""Wicked Days"" is an eerie mass of blips and hums more reflective of Flying Lotus and Death Grips than the grainy mid-’90s aesthetic he usually prefers. Somehow, with little musical direction, Marciano corrals these sounds with nothing but his mid-tempo rasp. Much like genre-defining artists before him such as stylistic forebear (and album guest) Kool Keith, Roc Marciano lives in his own world; we just visit him there.  His claims of mastery over his lane of hip-hop are bolstered by the quality of his songs. His sound is bombastic yet refined, a delicate balancing act inspiring artists both large (Earl Sweatshirt, A$AP Yams) and small (Ka, Stove God Cook$). He’s worked hard over the last decade, and he’s feeling slightly more appreciated for it: “I ran it up without a loan/I guess you could say I’ve come into my own,” he says on the title track. Mt. Marci is a proclamation from a throne of his own creation.","On his latest, the Long Island MC exults in the kingdom he’s created within underground rap.

"A Drill Story: Music, Trial & Trauma",Loski,by: Hubert Adjei-Kontoh,Associate Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5fb57c567e818f7ad25ead7b/1:1/w_160/a%20drill%20story_loski.jpeg,2020-11-24 06:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/loski-a-drill-story-music-trial-and-trauma/,Since 93,"Surveillance is the backbone of drill, and this is doubly true of Loski’s music. His 2018 song “Drill” began with a reporter blaming social media for the rise of gang violence—a ludicrous suggestion that Loski followed with his version of events: “Let me tell you how my animals move/Step in the cut, designer shoes, done it in Canada Goose.” Real Gs move in geese fleece. Loski is hyper-aware of the commentary around drill; his music feels like meta-drill. On his latest, Music, Trial & Trauma: A Drill Story, he tells a common story in a monumental way: You make music about all the bad shit you’ve seen, you get targeted because of the bad shit, and then you go to jail for the bad shit, which leaves you with more trauma. To tell this fairly sprawling tale of the constant loop of Black experience, Loski leaves drill behind in order to give a fuller picture of what he’s gone through. When it goes, there’s no substitute. Loski has never had to prove himself, and he runs laps around the almost unadorned beats on these albums, climbing their skeletal vibrations as if he was on an obstacle course. The verve of a typical drill song is the perfect trampoline for tossed-off lines where he bounces through his disaffection, popping off like he’s just been handed the aux. The hooks can be as simple as, “I got honeys on me/I got hunnies on me, couple hunnid on me,” on “On Me,” where he just swerves. The problem is that he’s taken on too much in trying to make Music, Trial & Trauma be more than just a collection of drill bangers. That’s fine; who said the Croydon rapper couldn’t be versatile? A song like “Forrest Gump” showed that Loski could make a party jam with a hook—no problem. Unfortunately, the album has the feeling of being focus-group-tested to the point of dilution. With the exception of “Flavour,” featuring Stormzy, the party songs seem tossed off, as if Loski knew he had to have a formless Afrobeat number (“Naija Man,” featuring Davido) and a dance track with two stars (Popcaan and Fredo guest on “Avengers”) in order to reach the new audiences some marketer was drooling over. It didn’t have to be this way. The singles Loski put out this year have been flitting around the internet, racking up YouTube views with the force of their realness. The cavernous loosie “Allegedly” threw a middle finger up at all comers while making it clear that what we think we know about Loski is actually very little. “Anglo Saxon” proved that the rapper could be cocky, self-referential, and witty all at once. There are glimpses of that Loski here. He launches himself off the grimacing guitar and demented organ of “Captain Hook” and flies to the outer reaches of shit-talking (“Rap for the hood but we know he’s timid (Timid)/I don't wanna look like them/Whatever I do or say they mimic”). On “Black,” the man gets personal. Here Loski’s sound is muted. The synthetic trumpets seem smaller, wafting through the wind. The looped sub-bass and ticking-clock snare provide the percussive backing for Loski’s tribulations. He talks about the death of his brother, mourning both him and the loss of childhood his passing entailed. Though it may be easy to laugh at a lyric about loving Black women the way he loves black Mercedes, that levity is what allows Loski to delve into the tragedy of his personal life (“Gang signs turn to prayer hands/When you're locked in a cell and can't leave”). The turn from violence to religion occurs with surprising swiftness, but that is the nature of oppression. Losing one’s freedom can turn a sinner to a saint in an instant. Music, Trial & Trauma is several albums at once: drill bangers, party tunes, and a series of reflections on Black tragedy. It doesn’t always cohere, but the effect is still rather startling. Loski illuminates the darkened corners of his mind in order to reveal the society that gives power to the demons inside.","The London drill rapper ventures beyond his chosen style in order to offer a fuller picture of what he’s gone through. At his best, he runs laps around the album’s skeletal beats.

LIVE DRUGS,The War on Drugs,by: Steven Arroyo,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5fb7f4067aaa9860978d7a6a/1:1/w_160/live%20drugs_the%20war%20on%20drugs.jpg,2020-11-23 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/the-war-on-drugs-live-drugs/,Super High Quality,"There’s a phenomenon at the heart of the War on Drugs’ music called the crossover: the point when one moment folds into another. You can hear it in most of their songs. Sometimes it’s evoked in their steady-marching swells, which can sound like the last sliver of rooftop fading out of focus in the U-Haul’s rearview mirror, or the last flicker of candlelight atop a birthday cake. Often it’s more literal: the point when Adam Granduciel sings his last word and the song’s grand, several-minute-long outro begins. The crossover is all over the Philadelphia band’s first-ever live album, which captures them at the end of a metamorphosis. Before releasing their 2014 breakthrough, Lost in the Dream, which sped their graduation from small rooms to huge festivals, the War on Drugs were a four-piece touring group that excelled at making those small rooms feel enormous. Their rise in popularity precipitated their upgrade to a bigger lineup, which now includes baritone sax player Jon Natchez, multi-instrumentalist Anthony LaMarca, and mean-mugging drummer Charlie Hall in addition to Granduciel and longstanding members Dave Hartley on bass and Robbie Bennett on keys. LIVE DRUGS comprises recordings from tours behind Lost in the Dream and its follow-up, 2017’s A Deeper Understanding, as they found their footing as a six-piece between 2014 and 2019, documenting their evolution as a live band and their solidification into a Live Band. The decision by Granduciel and co-producer, guitar tech, and stage manager Dominic East to pick recordings from such a large sample ensures that LIVE DRUGS always sounds immaculate. It has an especially muscular low end—and not just Hartley’s bass. Hearing Natchez’s baritone sax captured so cleanly in such a deep register almost makes it hard to believe that it could be a wind instrument. When Bennett strikes a couple low piano chords to accompany Granduciel’s first words of “Pain”—“Go to bed now I can tell/Pain is on the way out now”—it offsets the storm clouds around him as immediately as a weighted blanket. Granduciel is a much different vocalist in the live setting than he is on record: more punctuated, less delicate, and even a little less melodic. His soloing, meanwhile, consistently sounds more articulated as he rips into these songs on a tailwind of spontaneous inspiration. In the first episode of a podcast made as part of the rollout for LIVE DRUGS called The Super High Quality Podcast, they discuss being open to songs evolving onstage from their recorded forms. They make good on that here, down to a song’s structure in one case: “Eyes to the Wind” goes drum-less for its first verse, the byproduct of the song once collapsing at a performance in Copenhagen. (This one, regrettably, is not that performance, but a later one that replicated and refined the new version.) It’s a nice respite of “small” from the constant “big.” Bennett’s piano plays the high end this time, sprinkling stardust over Granduciel’s words about the before and after of someone entering his life. Drugs heads may be disappointed to find that there are no Slave Ambient cuts here, although “Buenos Aires Beach” from the debut album, Wagonwheel Blues (when the War on Drugs was essentially Granduciel’s loosely defined solo moniker) is given new, fuller life. The only other song not from Dream or Understanding is a cover of Warren Zevon’s “Accidentally Like a Martyr”—hardly a Zevon hit, and probably best known as the song that comes on after “Werewolves of London” on his best-selling album, Excitable Boy. The song choice is a small surprise, but Zevon is anything but: The War on Drugs have always stood proudly and obviously in the heartland rock lineage, and given that many others in there, like Zevon, had less-than-stellar reputations, they’ve also been an option that you could feel less messy about enjoying. It’s a beautiful take, but a less on-the-nose inspiration—they tackled a Bill Fay song and a Pretenders song multiple times in those years, for example—could have been a more interesting cover choice. LIVE DRUGS flows well, too, as if it were all from one show. Which is to say that listening to it feels like being at that show, which is a whole different feeling in late 2020. The live album has always functioned to some degree as a reminder—but more of moments, not of: “What’s a concert?” When Hall slams his toms to ignite the final surge of “Under the Pressure,” easily among their best live cuts, it’s like they heard the question. You can hear the audience, revved-up by the harnessed tension of the previous two minutes, bleed into the mix. They are singing gibberish along to the guitar melody, which maybe you have forgotten is the absolute best genre of rock-concert-singalong, transcending languages and inebriation levels. To have been there at that moment must have been a thrill. To hear it today, at this moment, feels like a gift.","The first live album from the Philadelphia band feels loose and sounds immaculate, cementing their status as one of the premier live bands of their generation.

Hey u x,BENEE,by: Hannah Jocelyn,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5fb4136abf63a38ca88b7812/1:1/w_160/HEYUX_Benee.jpg,2020-11-23 06:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/benee-hey-u-x/,Republic,"The latest Gen Z pop star to emerge from TikTok and Chill Indie playlists into minor stardom, Stella Rose Bennett—aka BENEE—found success early in the COVID-19 pandemic with her Gus Dapperton collaboration “Supalonely” and its ensuing dance challenge. Unlike fellow youth alt-pop Billboard phenomenons like Conan Gray’s “Heather” or Clairo’s “Sofia,” “Supalonely” doesn’t even hint at a deeper meaning: The song depicts an alienated teenager post-breakup, reveling in self-pity with taunting backing vocals and slap bass. Fortunately, “Supalonely” (originally released on 2019’s Stella & Steve EP) is not indicative of BENEE’s debut full-length, Hey u x. Like an album-length version of Mean Girls or Easy A—high-school movies where underdog protagonists briefly become pariahs before realizing they must Be Themselves—Hey u x is at its best when it’s down to Earth, and only stumbles when it lapses into conventional pop. When BENEE’s peers strive for profundity, the results can be as cheesy as any recent pop. Conan Gray’s “The Story” attempts to handle sensitive topics like teen suicide, but winds up exposing a lack of maturity (sample lyric: “They were just 16/When the people were mean”). Instead of trying to be a voice of a generation, BENEE finds depth by focusing on her own feelings and reactions. On “Happen to Me,” she depicts intrusive thoughts and ambivalence around death, but her tone is realistic rather than moralizing: “I understand why people leave/But leaving seems scary to me.” Though the lyrics aren’t especially innovative, there’s an honest, youthful plainspokenness to lines like, “Don’t sell yourself short/There’s something about you/Can’t explain but I can’t live without you,” from “Same Effect,” or “Driving inside your car/You put your hand around my heart/But I’m afraid/You’ll try to control me,” from “A Little While.” Producer Josh Fountain is eager to match BENEE’s energy, whether borrowing a drum groove from Radiohead’s “Weird Fishes” on “Happen to Me” or indulging silliness like “Snail,” which feels primed for another TikTok challenge with nonsensical chants (“I’m like a snail/You’re a guy/Kinda mad/I can’t fly”), 808 cowbells, and vocal manipulations. Ironically for a major-label pop album, the most upbeat excursions are the weakest. “Sheesh” with Grimes (more or less a reprise of melodies from “Kill V. Maim”) aims for upbeat hyperpop but tops out at maybe 50 Gecs. BENEE’s deadpan choruses on “Plain” provide amusing contrast to Lily Allen and Flo Milli’s pettiness, but that pettiness feels at odds with the rest of the record. These songs play like concessions to anyone who wanted an album of “Supalonely” instead of an album of sincerity. Yet “Supalonely” fits better than expected in the context of the record’s more thoughtful songs, to the point where its obnoxiousness feels endearing, even playful. It helps that the rest of the album contains none of the same smarmy aloofness—even if “Kool” sounds slick, it’s really just envious of people who can pull that off. There’s room here for wackiness like “Snail,” but BENEE gets better results by dropping the cutesy affectations. When the pace slows down, Hey u x strikes a balance between whimsy and moodiness, particularly on “A Little While” or the Frankie Valli-alluding ballad “All the Time,” a duet with New Zealand newcomer Muroki. BENEE can wink at the camera when she needs to, but Hey u x is most poignant when she doesn’t.","The 20-year-old New Zealand singer follows up her ironic TikTok smash “Supalonely” with a surprisingly sincere album that only stumbles when it lapses into conventional pop.

While the World Was Burning,SAINt JHN,by: Dani Blum ,Contributor ,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5fb557cb4cb304ce01ca1306/1:1/w_160/While%20The%20World%20Was%20Burning_SAINt%20JHN.jpg,2020-11-23 06:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/saint-jhn-while-the-world-was-burning/,Godd ComplexXHITCO,"SAINt JHN was crooning woozy knock-off Future verses when a 19-year-old in a village in Kazakhstan illegally made him a hit. In 2019, three years after the song was released, a budding DJ named Imanbek Zeikenov uploaded a remix of SAINt JHN’s glowering “Roses.” In Imanbek’s version, SAINt JHN’s voice is pitched up to a bouncy, unrecognizable register amid constantly thwacking bass. Enter TikTok: The remix became inescapable on the app this spring, with its rows of sweatshirted teens (and Jason Derulo) wriggling along to the beat. The track’s success made an intriguing dilemma for a rapper who once created a fake PR company to promote himself — virality without recognition, ubiquity without any sense of identity. SAINt JHN’s new project struggles to build a persona for him from these confusing beginnings. The album is laden with shockingly high-profile features—Kanye, Lil Uzi Vert, Kehlani, Future himself—and amorphous, vapor-like production from f a l l e n, a relatively unknown producer who shares SAINt JHNs proclivity towards aggravating name stylizations. The production is both anonymous and instantly familiar, recalling the hazy crooning and dribbled-out drums of both Travis Scott and Gunna. There is a vague sadness at the record’s core, but SAINt JHN only spells it out occasionally and clumsily. “I’m scared of overdosin’/I’m scared of falling in love,” he moans on “High School Reunion, Prom,” but there’s no emotion in his confession. We get wisps of SAINt JHN’s background: allusions to the poverty line, a lyric about being kicked out of his mother’s home on New Year’s Eve, the words “abandonment issues.” Unfortunately, most of these details are packed into the opener “Sucks to Be You,” which gets bogged down in its grating guilt trip of a chorus. “It sucks to be you, ‘cause I would have loved you,” he wails. “I’d watch the whole world burn to see you dance.” This tendency towards clumsy, cringe-inducing lyrics punctures the album’s better tracks. “I don’t think I even thought twice that I thought it,” he mumbles on “Gorgeous,” one of the sleeker and more propulsive tracks. On “Ransom,” an almost-tender track anchored by Kehlani and 6lack features, SAINt JHN finds a smoother, more assured balance between singing and rapping. But the chorus hinges on a garbled metaphor that compares texting to a hostage negotiation, made more absurd by SAINt JHN gravely proclaiming, “I’m too handsome.” Like much of the album, “Time for Demons” cobbles together a pastiche of rap tropes, blurring them into nonsense. “I’m savage mode, I’m not average, I’m on demon time, just in my cabbage,” he chirps. “Cut from a different cloth, from a different upholstery,” he states on “Pray 4 Me,” fumbling for meaning with soft murmurs and glistens of piano, before Kanye deploys a verse that mentions Israel and centrifugal force like so many MadLibs. While the World Was Burning presents itself as a victory lap for SAINt JHN. Three of the thirteen tracks are old, repurposed songs; two of those are versions of “Roses.” DaBaby remains apparently game as ever to hop on any remix, and he updates the plodding “Monica Lewinsky, Election Year” with a leering verse. (The actual Monica Lewinsky has said she wished she got royalties for the song.) And then there’s the second-most popular version of “Roses,” where Future’s adlibs and dynamic, gravelly rasp are in direct contrast with SAINt JHN’s shuffling verse. It’s a symbolic, full-circle moment, the imitator collaborating with his inspiration, but the gravity Future instinctively brings to any track gets lost here. In SAINt JHNs songs, like so in much of TikTok, sadness becomes aesthetic and anesthetized, until it’s just another vibe.","After an illegal remix made him a TikTok hit, the Brooklyn rapper-singer struggles to create an identity on his new album,  enlisting high-profile guests like Kanye, Lil Uzi Vert, and Future in the effort.

Preyer,Ilsa,by: Kim Kelly,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5fb5563d7e818f7ad25ead3f/1:1/w_160/preyer_ilsa.jpg,2020-11-23 06:00:00,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/ilsa-preyer/,Relapse,"On May 4, 1886, a bomb was thrown into a crowd of workers and their families who had gathered to hear speeches from a handful of prominent anarchists and labor organizers in Chicago’s Haymarket Square. The police, who had arrived moments before to bark out a dispersal order, opened fire; seven of their number were killed in the fracas, and multiple civilians were left injured or dead. As one of most infamous dates in American history, May 4, 1886 has also become a cultural touchstone for many of those on the left, from book publishers to breweries to metal bands. To the latter example, it’s etched into Orion Peter’s knuckles, and is thus on full display whenever the rangy, pierced-up vocalist takes the stage as part of D.C death doom outfit Ilsa. Ilsa is often dropped into the sludge metal camp, and while those doom elements are certainly apparent in their tempo and songwriting, when it comes down to brass tacks, they’re simply one of the best death metal bands going. Their band’s new full-length, Preyer, leans into that trademark bludgeoning rumble. While their approach may be muddied by their allegiance to punk rock, in tone, in tenor, and in lethal potential, Preyer could just as well have come crawling out of Stockholm in the mid-1990s than the D.C. suburbs in 2020. On top of that, the band’s queer, anti-racist, antifascist politics are as front-and-center as Peter’s tattoos—though the finer points of their lyrics are often obscured behind his guttural roar and the band’s three-guitarist attack. Ilsa may be an excellent death metal band, but they are far from typical; garden-variety lyrics about blood, guts, and virgin sacrifices are of no interest here. Rather, one of the album’s standout tracks, “Lady Diamond,” is a beastly reimagining of a medieval ballad—and it’s not even the strangest lyrical turn in this eleven-track compendium of complaints against Christian theocracy. Album opener “Epigraph” announces itself with a monologue from murderer and satanist Sean Sellers, who claimed that demonic possession fueled the 1986 killing of his parents and later converted to Christianity prior to his 1999 execution by the state. According to the band, Sellers’ story was a useful avatar for the “exploitative intersection of religious, media, and state authority,” and provided something of a guiding light for the album’s conception. But despite Ilsa’s deep love for B-movie horror, Preyer is not merely focused on death. Rather, it fixes a gimlet eye directly on the arcane evils of heaven and hell, howling mockery at the cross and the prayerful predators that it has shielded through the centuries. In the album’s most explicitly political and anti-religious song, “Shibboleth”—a triumph of grimy, down-tuned d-beat—Peters rails against the “puritanic scum” and exhorts his own followers, “Raise the Devil’s black flag high! Anti-Christofascism!” Elsewhere, Ilsa takes aim at mass media as a lever of control on the tectonically shifting “The Square Column,” and pays special attention to religious fanaticism, the sins of the church, and blasphemous ritual (as on the exemplary bruiser “Widdershins”). For someone like me, who was both raised Catholic and got into death metal at a rather tender age, Preyer often cuts uncomfortably close to the bone. The lurching title track is a bitter condemnation of Catholic complicity, and comes with a warning: “Pedophile protectors/Reproduce repression/Shame on you/Hell is real/Still to come/In this life.” Preyer is due out on November 20th. Nine days (and 133 years) before, on November 11, 1887, four of those Haymarket martyrs—Albert Parsons, August Spies, George Engel, and Adolph Fischer—had swung from the gallows after a sham trial. Over a century later, the country remains in the grip of right-wing hegemony, and Ilsa’s latest effort offers both a razor-sharp critique of power and a distortion-drenched cry of rebellion. As Spies cried out before he died, “The day will come when our silence will be more powerful than the voices you are throttling today.” Preyer may be an outlier in the often uninspiring American death metal landscape, but its message—and its music—make for a powerful weapon nonetheless.","The sludgy death-metal group draws inspiration from the story of the satanist Sean Sellers on their roaring latest LP.

Confessions,Usher,by: Clover Hope,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5fb5501635fb80fc5c920dd1/1:1/w_160/confessions_usher.jpg,2020-11-22 06:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/usher-confessions/,Arista,"In 2004, Usher wasn’t yet committed to the idea of marriage, a point he made repeatedly during the press cycle for his fourth album, Confessions, marketed as his most personal project to date. In interviews, he told the same story about his breakup with TLC’s Rozonda “Chilli” Thomas, seven years his senior: He’d cheated on her; she’d been pressuring him to settle down; arguments led to fissures, and they eventually split. Chilli hinted at infidelity on the radio but declined to elaborate on the relationship to Vibe or contribute to what she called a “PR move.” Usher said he didn’t view the album as a stunt, even though it was. He described Confessions as autofiction and let the public run with the rumors, which, of course, they did. But the deception worked on multiple levels. In constructing the narrative around Confessions, Usher omitted certain facts. While it was true that he wasn’t entirely sold on marriage, he told Rolling Stone in 2004 that he did once buy Chilli a 10-karat diamond ring and proposed to her in the most R&B way: in the middle of sex. He said he co-wrote the album’s core breakup ballad, “Burn,” while he and Chilli were still together. A decade later, executive producer Jermaine Dupri said the song was indeed about her but admitted Confessions wasn’t just Usher’s experience, rather a compilation of its male creators’ infractions, promoted as one man’s expunging of sins. The album’s most salacious track, “Confessions Pt. II,” a saga about creeping and getting another woman pregnant, was based on Dupri’s life, not Usher’s. “We wanted the media to ask us questions,” the producer told Vibe in 2014, comparing their artistic license to that of Michael Jackson. “Nobody knows who the fuck Billie Jean is. We’re still looking for her.” Usher understood that much of a great pop album is simply telling a good story. He had the catalog, choreography, angelic falsetto, and winning grin necessary to be a star. Everyone in America knew the term “Yeah!” not just as an everyday affirmation but as a club smash. But to be worthy of the Michael Jackson-level prestige he coveted, Usher needed a man-in-the-mirror moment. He played up the cheating angle and the rumors and was seemingly forthright about the subject of his ex; and because it worked, he copied that storytelling formula for his subsequent album releases, albeit with less moving results: For 2008’s Here I Stand, he milked his marriage to Tameka Foster for material, and then he made their divorce fodder for his 2010 album Raymond v. Raymond. The ability to draft a persuasive narrative around a project is a skill music fans both scrutinize and take for granted, but the greatest pop stars—Janet Jackson, Taylor Swift, Drake—know how to master the art of packaging. It’s a craft to turn reality into convenient truth, and it’s special when the material transcends the machine. On Confessions, the stars align in Usher’s favor: He had a breakup to cope with and an album to make, and the dramatic backdrop gave him the most compelling work of his career. And so the truth hardly mattered. Usher spent much of 2004 dethroning himself on the pop chart, earning four No. 1 hits and reaping the benefits of binding his love life to his music. Confessions sold a million copies in its first week at a time when illegal file-sharing had labels frantic over the fate of the industry. Usher thrived between two very different eras of pop—the contemporary R&B rush of 2001 and the hybrid R&B of the 2010s, when Drake unleashed his inner lothario and assumed his role as the charts’ new lover boy. Confessions dropped just three months after Rolling Stone crowned former *NSYNC frontman Justin Timberlake their New King of Pop for siphoning Black music into his solo debut. Though millennial pop had turned swiftly toward boy bands and Britney Spears, one of the top five highest-selling albums of the 2000s is Confessions, a record that sits alongside Boyz II Men and TLC as the only R&B albums to be certified diamond for selling 10 million units. Usher’s coming-of-age story gave R&B the sort of widespread appreciation the genre struggled to recreate in the decades that followed. “So many people are interested in R&B,” he said in 2004, after selling platinum in a week. “I feel like it is the base of everything. I want to make it more prominent.” Up until that year, Usher was a king in training, a heartthrob with washboard abs, a protégé of Antonio “L.A.” Reid and Kenneth “Babyface” Edmonds’ legendary LaFace Records. Usher Raymond IV, a former choir boy, had started out performing in talent shows in his hometown of Chattanooga, Tennessee before his mother moved the family to Atlanta. At 14, he auditioned for L.A. Reid, singing “End of the Road” by Boyz II Men; Reid signed Usher to LaFace that day. The label put him to work recording his debut in a hedonistic environment with Sean “Puffy” Combs (Usher mentioned seeing at least one orgy) and producers like Jodeci’s DeVante Swing. Having launched his career with adult love songs, Usher was ahead of his peers at 15, singing, “Can you get wit’ it/It’s like that/It’s only a sexual thing,” on his 1994 self-titled debut. He had the tender pedigree of a Tevin Campbell, but he was an old soul who embraced a level of showmanship that could veer toward hokey. He skated across stages with the grace of a swan, and he was charming and shameless enough to pull off tricks like dropping his pants mid-pop-lock to reveal his boxers. More important, he was technically gifted and unmatched as a dancer. While the dexterous moves set him up as a natural heir apparent to MJ, Usher modeled his soul music after the likes of Stevie Wonder, Sam Cooke, and Marvin Gaye. “They’re all great emotional singers who used their experiences in life for the music,” Usher said in a 2004 interview. “You live, you learn and you can sing about it.” Confessions is his portrait of a man contemplating his own deceit and trying to sing his way out of it in under an hour and a half. Star producers like Dupri, Bryan-Michael Cox, Just Blaze, and Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis create layers of moonlit soul and slow jams that sound like bodies gliding over satin. Yet Confessions didn’t come across as the type of artificial growth many artists try to muster up to prove the worthiness of a new record. Usher really did have something to say—as in, he was actually confessing; it’s just that there were fifty-leven people in the booth with him. Building on the party-life mood of his third album, 8701, Confessions treats vulnerability as a rite of passage to true partnership and sex as an act linked to lies. The storyline is solidified in “Confessions Pt. II,” a musical telenovela that holds the album’s core thesis about living with a guilty conscience. Usher weighs the options of honesty or silence and talks himself through choosing the former, rationalizing that, “If I’m gonna tell it, then I gotta tell it all.” He cycles through hurt and regret for the love he let go, offering hints of remorse that give the album dimension. The Just Blaze track “Throwback,” which samples Dionne Warwick’s “You’re Gonna Need Me,” finds Usher in a loop of distress over the former love of his life: “Heartbroken when you left my world/Man, I wish I would’ve kept my girl.” But on “Truth Hurts,” he treats a partner like a plaintiff (“I got reason to believe/That you been fooling around…”) and then admits to being driven into suspicion by his own infidelity. Usher established himself as a hitmaker with 1997’s “Nice & Slow,” a ballad of pure libido. He went No. 1 again with 8701’s charismatic lead single “U Remind Me,” which won him his first Grammy, and then “U Got It Bad.” For his fourth album, he wanted another slow-tempo setup, but “Yeah!” was just the explosion Confessions needed leading up to its release. In Atlanta, Lil Jon was signal-boosting crunk by shouting at the same decibel as a drill instructor, and Usher’s new label, Arista, was looking for a club single. “Yeah!”—with Usher’s smooth narration, Lil Jon’s shrill adlibs, and Ludacris playing the inappropriate wingman—spent 12 consecutive weeks at No. 1. Usher was reluctant to even record it. He preferred the sensitive centerpiece “Burn,” a ballad co-produced by Dupri and Cox that opens with a dramatic swoosh, then a cradle of solemn chords. “Let it burn” was the final, indefinite stage of grief: “I know I made a mistake/Now it’s too late,” Usher sings. “I know she ain’t coming back.” His tone is rich with vitality, lust, or dejection as needed. As Dupri told Complex in 2014, “That’s what it feels like to me when I listen to the song, like somebody’s crying.” Of Confessions’ original 17 tracks (the deluxe version adds four new titles, including the doe-eyed Alicia Keys duet “My Boo”), the less celebrated songs aren’t so much filler as they are hidden treats obscured by the album’s most transcendent moments. Few sounds are more disarming than an Usher falsetto, at its most melting on songs like “Can U Handle It?” (which Robin Thicke co-wrote) and “Do It to Me,” among a handful of after-hours cuts that find him trapped between temptation and partnership; “Simple Things” is a syrupy lecture on the value of listening to women’s needs. The album’s latter half propels the narrative, turning Usher’s inner monologue into soulful pep talks. On “That’s What It’s Made For,” he worries about the consequences of having unprotected sex (the baby from “Confessions Pt. II”?) singing, “I slipped up, slipped in.” The track opens with Usher declaring, over stealthy keys, “Listen, I got a story to tell.” In 2020, Usher is still in the business of selling transparency. In a September interview promoting his single “Bad Habits,” a song about being bad at love, he talked about the benefits of therapy and cited Confessions as an inflection point in both his career and personal life. “At the end, can you judge me for being direct with you, the person whom I have to be in this relationship with?” he says, addressing a fictional partner, but maybe also his fans. “I’m gonna let you know who I am. And in the end, you choose to stay or you choose to leave. But you’re gonna know who I am.” For him, honesty ushered in growth and success, and it led to one of the most flawless executions of mythmaking in pop.

Self Help,Badge Époque Ensemble,by: Stuart Berman,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5fb2b72775036015cef9085d/1:1/w_160/self%20help_Badge%20E%CC%81poque%20Ensemble.jpg,2020-11-21 06:00:00,Jazz,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/badge-epoque-ensemble-self-help/,Telephone Explosion,"On their 2019 debut album, Toronto’s Badge Époque Ensemble named one of their instrumentals “You Can Build a Palace, or You Can Please People”—a title that speaks to the ever-fraught tension between capitalism and socialism in the current geopolitical landscape, but also to the aesthetic tug-of-war playing out within the band itself. Founded by Max Turnbull —the avant-rock chameleon formerly known as Slim Twig, and the creative and matrimonial partner of U.S. Girls’ Meg Remy—Badge Époque Ensemble was originally an outlet for him and his fellow Toronto DIY veterans to indulge their love of acid rock, funk, jazz, prog, and other early-’70s record-collector subgenres. At the same time, they’ve shown themselves to be, if not pop-friendly, then at least pop-conscious, whether packing complex compositions into tidy four-minute packages or using classic-rock touchstones as a jumping-off point into the great beyond. But on their third release in just over a year, Badge Époque Ensemble refuse to choose between free-form psychedelic explorations and pop pleasures. With Self Help, they prove they can have it both ways, by allowing their experimental and melodic tendencies to work more in tandem rather than in opposition. Each of the group’s previous records has featured a vocal cameo, but here they’ve assembled a veritable Toronto dream team of lead singers that includes Remy and indie-folk enigma Jennifer Castle alongside returning collaborators Dorothea Paas and James Baley (who also delivered the disco-tinged hook on U.S. Girls’ 2018 single “Pearly Gates”). Collectively, their presence transforms Badge Époque Ensemble from the sort of group that would’ve gotten played on an overnight pirate-radio broadcast in 1971 to one that could’ve conceivably snuck onto an AM station’s Top 40 countdown. And with the singers in tow, Badge Époque tap into the spiritual uplift and righteous activism coursing through popular music at the time. “Sing a Silent Gospel” is a gorgeous swirl of Fender Rhodes chords, Ethio-jazz sax melodies, and conga fury that’s anchored by Remy and Paas’ alternating vocals. And when the song transitions into an elaborate instrumental passage halfway through, it doesn’t so much drift away from its sturdy melodic foundation as fortify it, with the band eventually locking into a climactic circular progression that acquires cyclonic force. Baley’s street-soul empowerment anthem “Unity (It’s Up to You)” slides even more fluidly between formalism and freedom, with guitarist Chris Bezant intuitively using the singer’s extended high note as a launchpad into a wah-wahed solo as if he were finishing his sentence. But where these songs feel like extensions of Badge Époque Ensemble’s sound, centerpiece track “Just Space for Light” is the kind of move that would’ve been hard to imagine this band attempting a year ago. Guided by Alia O’Brien’s elegant flute lines, the song begins as a windchimed, candlelit quiet-storm stunner, with Castle seizing the spotlight as if she were performing on a primetime awards-show telecast. And while the song’s sudden shift into an acid-funk groove feels jarring at first, Castle retains her calming presence throughout, guiding you safely through its twists and turns. Despite the focus on melody, Self Help still affords Badge Époque Ensemble plenty of space to stretch out and freak out. The 10-minute “Birds Fly Through Ancient Ruins” is a creeping exercise in desert-scorched dub that turns downright apocalyptic near its climax, as if the landscape were being covered in ice. In response, the closing instrumental “Extinct Commune” triggers the slow thaw. As a solo-piano showcase for Turnbull, the track is Self Help’s extreme outlier, landing somewhere between an early-‘70s Elton John demo and after-hours jazz-bar improvisation. Yet in its own subtle way, it soundly reaffirms the album’s mission, blurring the line between pop classicism and free exploration until they’re one and the same.","Alongside a roster of guest vocalists including Jennifer Castle and Meg Remy, the psychedelic Toronto outfit allows their exploratory and pop-focused impulses to work in tandem.

Idiot Prayer: Nick Cave Alone at Alexandra Palace,Nick Cave,by: Ben Hewitt,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5fb54e9253b2d2cae561c369/1:1/w_160/Idiot%20Prayer_nick%20cave.jpg,2020-11-20 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/nick-cave-idiot-prayer-nick-cave-alone-at-alexandra-palace/,Bad Seed,"Years ago, people asked Nick Cave questions at their peril. In 1988, one NME hack riled him so badly that Cave started swinging punches, tried to steal the interview tape, and screamed: “You’re nothing but a shite-eater!” Today, though, you can ask him anything—literally—and he’ll answer on his Red Hand Files website. How do I cope with losing someone I love? Should I bring children into this world’s Boschian hellscape? Do you enjoy stage magic? Every warm, generous response makes Cave seem more like a kindly agony uncle instead of the larger-than-life construct of yore. The man who once passed for some crazed netherworld shaman, as unearthly and sinister as the stranger from “Red Right Hand,” usually limits the supernatural grandeur to discussing his beloved dachshund, Nosferatu. Other recent projects have made Cave the flesh-and-blood human more visible, too: chatty Q&A shows, candid documentaries, and a poignant Bad Seeds record, 2019’s Ghosteen, touched by the death of his son, Arthur. But none have been as eerily intimate as Idiot Prayer. A live film and LP recorded at London’s Alexandra Palace after Covid-19 waylaid a Bad Seeds tour, it finds him performing alone in a deserted concert hall, reworking 22 career-spanning songs into haunted piano sermons. The 84 minutes are filled almost entirely by melancholy keys and Cave’s rich croon. On the solitary new track, the longing ballad “Euthanasia,” he sings of spending a desperate evening roaming lonely landscapes, unmoored by grief and seeking salvation. “In looking for you, I lost myself,” he quivers over its elegant arrangement. That contemplative approach means Cave doesn’t so much strip songs down as peel back the flesh and expose their skeletal beauty. “Sad Waters” is recast as a pretty, tumbling lament; “Stranger Than Kindness” is broken down into a ghostly hymn; an otherworldly “Girl in Amber” entrances. Nearly a third of the set is taken from 1997’s The Boatman’s Call, a choice which forges a spiritual link between that record’s stately heartbreak and Ghosteen’s sublime ruminations on grief. In Alexandra Palace’s lavish, uncanny void, the lines between past and present start to blur, and compositions become unstuck in time. Twenty-year-old wounds are as tender as purpling bruises on “Brompton Oratory” and “Far From Me,” while Cave’s choked falsetto on the sparse, sumptuous “Black Hair” suggests the scent that an ex-lover left on his pillow still fills his nostrils. “Waiting For You,” on the other hand, emerged just last year, yet he purges the Ghosteen version’s gauzy electronic sheen until only a brittle prayer remains, and his voice cracks as if he’s spent an eternity in purgatory. Inevitably, the spartan setup favors a certain vein of Cave’s songwriting. For the most part, he snubs the Bad Seeds’ priapic sleaze and fire-and-brimstone filth to embrace his softer side. When he sinks into heartbreak on “Nobody’s Baby Now,” it’s as wistful as the coda to a silver-screen romance; during Grinderman’s “Palaces of Montezuma,” which is reimagined as a jazzy lounge number, his grand pledges waver between bravado and bashfulness. As with many of the deconstructions, the unvarnished treatment allows a greater vulnerability to shine through. And yet some of Idiot Prayer’s finest moments crackle with a more dangerous energy. On a handful of mesmerizing tracks, Cave sounds less like he’s revisiting his songbook than conducting a seance. “Higgs Boson Blues,” a sprawling surrealist odyssey on 2013’s Push the Sky Away, starts out hushed but slowly spirals into a fevered vision. “Driving my car, flame trees on fire,” he keens over its music-box melody; by the song’s end, as he riffs on Miley Cyrus, monkeys, and smallpox-carrying missionaries, his voice has broken into a howl and he’s hammering away at the keys. Old live favorite “The Mercy Seat,” meanwhile, has rarely had the kind of dark intensity that Cave summons here, transformed into a glowing murder ballad. About 30-odd minutes in, just after he’s finished a forlorn “(Are You) The One That I’ve Been Waiting For?,” Cave lets slip a quick, disbelieving chuckle, as if suddenly snapping out of a reverie. Otherwise, there’s no talking, no wisecracking, no concession that anyone else might be listening in as he reckons with his life’s work. The result is a performance that exists in a strange hinterland, an album that’s unnervingly intimate yet flickers with the strange unreality of a dream. Idiot Prayer is as up-close and personal an encounter with Cave as there’s ever been. But a little mystery remains, always.","Cave performed these 22 career-spanning songs alone in a deserted concert hall, reworking them into haunted piano sermons that glow with unnerving intimacy.

Home for Now,Babeheaven,by: Jemima Skala,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5fb54c3c2c244fead4faa8d4/1:1/w_160/Home%20for%20Now_Babeheaven.jpg,2020-11-20 06:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/babeheaven-home-for-now/,AWAL,"Babeheaven first made their name with dreamy bedroom indie pop; their early songs were like teenage confessions whispered into their pillows. After the double whammy of their Suspended Animation mixtape and Circles EP last year, vocalist Nancy Andersen and producer-instrumentalist Jamie Travis are stepping into their grown-up selves, bidding the band’s adolescence goodbye with a gentle kiss on the forehead and readying themselves for a new chapter. On Home for Now they show a more evolved sound, still interior in its focus, but far more self-assured. They’ve included a few of their older songs, nodding to the crowd favorites that have brought them this far. “Friday Sky” is the most notable of these, with reverberant guitar chords that instantly evoke memories of a very specific brand of British bedroom indie—bubblegum, hopeful, head in the clouds. (Travis is the son of Rough Trade founder Geoff Travis; british bedroom indie is, in a sense, in the duo’s blood.) The wistful “November” strikes a balance between Andersen’s tentative vocals and a forceful drum pattern; “Jalisco” melds a kicked-back trip-hop beat with layered, echoing vocals that keep it feeling airy. In their new songs, Babeheaven continue to play with genre, rolling it around in their hands and molding it to fit their own strain of dream pop. “Human Nature” opens on a bassy throb that signals the group’s trip-hop influences, expanding on what they started with “Jalisco”; the wobbly guitars on “Cassette Beat” sound as though they’ve been run through a tape recorder several times over, an example of Travis’ increasingly adventurous studio techniques. “Craziest Thing” is the most out-and-out indie song on the album, but touchingly so. The peppy twang of echoing guitar strings is imbued with a naive hope, in stark contrast to Andersen’s anxious lyrics (“I lie in bed, try not to think/But my head’s on the ceiling”). Sometimes mournful, sometimes pleading, Babeheaven favor a primarily minor-key palette to give voice to vulnerability in a way that’s endearing yet empowering. Throughout Home for Now, Andersen’s voice flows with understated confidence and quiet power. She has spoken of her discomfort on stage; when she finally took singing lessons, just before the UK went into lockdown, her teacher advised her to remember to breathe. Home for Now sounds like Andersen allowing herself one long exhale and settling into her talents as a vocalist. On “In My Arms,” she indulges in subtle R&B trills and pushes so that the chorus hits with a greater intensity. The close harmonies of the all-too-brief interlude “6 Times Round” buoy the woozy drum beat. On the closing “Through the Night,” Andersen takes things at exactly her own pace, singing just off-beat enough to pull the rest of the instrumentation in line with her own rhythm, her rich voice cushioned by soft layers of synths.  Home for Now isn’t necessarily groundbreaking; there are plenty of bands working with similar fusions of indie, pop, and electronic music, but the album shows them clearly moving forward in their abilities and ambitions. What’s most exciting is hearing Andersen discovering her potential as a singer. If she was unsure of herself before, Home for Now sounds like her proof to herself that she’s doing exactly what she needs to do.","On their debut album, the UK duo nudges classic British bedroom indie toward a fuller, richer sound, while singer Nancy Andersen discovers the potential of her understated voice.

Staunch Honey,David Nance,by: Sam Sodomsky,Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5fb56c8409ecad2c0af1dc52/1:1/w_160/Staunch%20Honey_David%20Nance.jpg,2020-11-20 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/david-nance-staunch-honey/,Trouble in Mind,"For music obsessives, there comes a time when, having burnt yourself out on the classics, you immerse yourself in ephemera. You may turn to scratchy bootlegs of live shows, expensive box sets of alternate takes, or unauthorized collections of outtakes, passed down by fellow travellers. While less polished than the music that brought you to an artist’s work in the first place, these hidden gems offer a different and equally important thrill: They feel like your own. Nebraska songwriter David Nance has internalized this behavior like few working artists. He has a habit of covering beloved albums in their entirety, but his own music is where he really puts his fandom to the test. He draws unabashedly from classic rock touchstones like the Allman Brothers and Crazy Horse, the Stones and the Stooges, the Dead and the Basement Tapes. But instead of reaching for their crowd-pleasing heights, he strips his music to its raw, noisy core. At their best, his songs reveal how his favorite records might have sounded when they were still being hammered out in rehearsal. Nance’s latest studio album, Staunch Honey, features the sharpest and most distinctive songwriting of his career, but the sound remains gloriously unrefined. According to a press release, he reworked the material three times before settling on these renditions: recorded at home, directly to tape, with just a few appearances from collaborators like guitarist Jim Schroeder and drummer Kevin Donahue. (Thus it’s billed as a solo album, as opposed to 2018’s Peaced and Slightly Pulverised, released as the David Nance Group.) The homespun feel of the album gives it a psychedelic, outsider charm, like if Ariel Pink’s early work had been inspired by jam bands and Southern rock instead of ’60s novelty songs and jingles. Like Pink, Nance is a deceptively traditional songwriter, banding together clever hooks and catchy riffs that play with an uncanny familiarity. As a self-producer, he complements this gift: “This Side of the Moon” begins with a whispered refrain rising deep within the mix, like he’s cuing the band, while the first chorus of “July Sunrise” trails off with a wordless coda, as if he’s still workshopping the melody. Other highlights, like “Gentle Traitor” and “My Love, the Dark and I,” are warbly studio concoctions, sketches of songs that seem in danger of dissipating into tape hiss. Nance drawls through their fuzzy arrangements in a deep, grungy voice, maintaining the mood rather than expressing any specific emotion. It is partially why his lyrics, when you can make them out, seem primed to sing along with even when you have no idea what he’s talking about: “The worst part about seeing you this evening,” he sings in “Save Me Some Tears,” “is horseflies soaking in my ice tea.” For such a warped, solitary album, Staunch Honey seems designed for open spaces. On a recent live album, recorded for a socially distant iteration of Gonerfest, the music comes alive, played by a band laughing and cracking jokes, extending solos and jamming out, encouraged by a small group of people hearing it all for the first time. “This is making my year,” Nance announces near the end, before admitting, “Not a hard bar to pass.” While the songs on Staunch Honey feel like breakthroughs, it’s living proof that their real journey is just beginning.","The Nebraska guitarist and songwriter strips his music to its raw, noisy core, revealing how his favorite records might have sounded when they were still being hammered out in rehearsal.

Welcome to O’Block,King Von,by: Dean Van Nguyen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5fb2b37d3dd6b0f57138db92/1:1/w_160/Welcome%20to%20O'Block_King%20Von.jpg,2020-11-20 06:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/king-von-welcome-to-oblock/,Only the FamilyEMPIRE,"Dayvon Bennett, known throughout Chicago as rapper King Von, was shot dead outside the Monaco Hookah Lounge, Atlanta in the early hours of November 6 when, according to police, an argument between two groups of men “escalated to gunfire.” He was 26 years old. Von—one of two men killed in the incident—leaves behind two children and a catalog of music that’s stark and uncompromising in its depiction of street violence. Yet at the time of his death, Von appeared motivated to escape the trappings of a troubled past. “I like the people more in Chicago, but it’s just smarter to live at where I am now,” he told Passion of the Weiss earlier this year. Atlanta might have been his adopted home, but Von was Chicago all the way to his bones. The title of Welcome to O’Block—released exactly a week before Von’s death—references the tough 6400 block of South Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Drive on Chicago’s South Side. Dubbed O Block after murder victim Odee Perry, it includes the Parkway Gardens apartments, where Michelle Obama grew up, where Chief Keef used to hang out. Von’s music is heavily indebted to drill pioneers, and bears many of gangster rap’s timeless fundamentals. His verses are unapologetic about the violence that rippled through a life marked with stints in prison, delivered with an unpolished flow distinguished by its sense of tension. Welcome to O’Block has been pitched as Von’s debut album after a series of mixtapes and his “origin story.” The tragedy that has followed its release means the project shoulders more of his legacy than Von could ever have intended. Thankfully, it delivers a concentrated dose of the rapper’s burgeoning style. Von was not Killer Mike, broadly covering America’s social ills, but when he raps about committing burglaries at 13 years old (“I Am What I Am”) and asserts he has “bodies from way back” (“All These N****s”), it comes with not just a captivating belligerency but sobering honesty. The opening lyrics to opening track “Armed & Dangerous” immediately give the album a sense of edginess: “Police steady watching me/Everyday they clockin’ me.” Von’s voice is the sound of tense muscles impossible to unwind. Welcome to O’Block is a more nuanced set than Von’s last tape Levon James, which traded almost totally in hardened gangsterisms. On “Can’t Relate,” Von makes it clear his life can only be viewed through glass, insisting we can never appreciate the gravity of being on the run from authorities or sitting in jail away from your children. The album’s best section is its final three tracks, a painful hint at what Von’s future as a recording artist might have held. “Ride” sees him give thanks for a partner who stuck by his side during a trial. Punctuated by an AutoTune-doused hook, “How It Go” offers a vivid telling of his legal troubles, while closer “Wayne’s Story” depicts a 14-year-old trapped in a cycle of violence. Primarily produced by ChopsquadDJ, the beats are uniform in their presentation: eerie piano keys, humming basslines, skittish drums, a palpable sense of menace. There are occasional divergences from the formula—“I Am What I Am” places Von in the Brooklyn drill scene alongside rising regional artist Fivio Foreign—but by prioritizing heavy atmosphere, the music scores Von’s words with the appropriate sense of gravity. There are moments when an artist notable for his raw style shows a lack of polish. “Mad at You” shows Von somewhat churlishly decrying a woman who left him, with Dreezy playing the role of his ex. The generic “Back Again” features a strangely lackluster appearance from Von’s mentor and label head Lil Durk. Much better is “All These N****s,” a short, energetic shot of drill that showcases the pair’s musical chemistry. (Both Von and Durk’s recent work has been in the backdrop of charges faced in connection with a February 2019 shooting outside of Atlanta restaurant the Varsity. The case is still open.) Becoming laser-focused on flaws perhaps unfairly sidesteps the importance of Welcome to O’Block in the broader Chicago rap narrative. Recontextualised in terrible sadness, it serves as the most complete document of Von’s artistry, tinged with the sting that he was still getting better. King Von wrote about a world that was bleak. His passing just makes it all the more so.","The debut album from the uncompromising rapper was released one week before his untimely death. It delivers a concentrated dose of his tense, menacing take on drill.

"Hill, Flower, Fog",Emily A. Sprague,by: Philip Sherburne,Contributing Editor,"https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5fb2b0bca470daa51dd9e3a5/1:1/w_160/Hill,%20Flower,%20Fog_Emily%20A.%20Sprague.jpg",2020-11-19 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/emily-a-sprague-hill-flower-fog/,RVNG,"In Emily A. Sprague’s indie-folk project Florist—sometimes accompanied by her bandmates, sometimes solo—the Catskill, New York native makes music of startling intimacy. Her last album, the self-explanatory Emily Alone, was as unadorned as a Shaker chair, stripped down to mostly acoustic guitar and voice. “Death will come/Then a cloud of love,” she sang, a philosopher of monosyllables. But on Sprague’s albums under her own name, she trades language for the mercurial sounds of modular synthesizers, her undulating drones as formless as galaxies. If Florist’s music is a pen-and-ink line drawing, an Emily A. Sprague recording is more like a trick of the light captured on fogged film. At these two poles, the opposite sides of her music mirror each other. Recorded in the wake of her mother’s death and a move out West, Emily Alone was about grief and solitude. In sound and materials, the electronic Hill, Flower, Fog is a world away from that album’s hushed, introspective folk, but it is also, in its way, a record of mourning. She recorded its six instrumental tracks in a single week in March, in the early days of the pandemic. “I found myself suddenly a part of that stream which flows now separate from the reality we used to know,” she wrote upon first uploading the album to Bandcamp in March, just four days after she had finished it. (The RVNG Intl. edition has been expanded and resequenced.) “It is meant as a soundtrack to these new days, practices, distances, losses, ends, and beginnings.” Rather than fear or discord, though, she emphasizes a grounding tranquility. Hill, Flower, Fog is cut from similar cloth as its electronic predecessors Water Memory and Mount Vision. Soft and luminous, its cycling patterns trace gentle shapes, generally favoring major over minor keys. They seem targeted largely at the subconscious; once the closing song’s patient andante arpeggios fade to silence, it can be hard to remember many details about the preceding 40 minutes. At the same time, Sprague’s sounds are more sharply defined than before; she has replaced the diffuse pads and gaseous tone clusters of previous albums with cool, woodwind-like leads and bright chimes. Lush as a dewy field, “Moon View” opens the album with what sounds like a duet for music box and pastoral recorder; “Horizon” likewise plays crisp tintinnabulations off reverberant held tones, syncopated delay sending ripples across the song’s placid surface. That palette doesn’t change much; all six tracks play up the contrast between pin-prick details and drawn-out echoes. The mood throughout is wistful but unburdened, as if acknowledging the pain of the present moment but also resigned to it, and determined to persevere. The slow, steady quarter notes of “Rain” capture a quiet sense of wonder. “Woven” is constructed around wavering open fifths that faintly recall the drones of Indian classical music; around them drip all manner of squiggles and accents, soft as melting ice cream. The nine-minute “Mirror” proceeds as though Sprague had simply set the dials on her modular rig and gone to make a cup of tea; it pings and burbles with a mind of its own, its rhythm like the aftermath of a rainfall, when the dripping from the eaves and the trees creates its own aleatory symphony. In a break from the extreme abstraction of Sprague’s previous electronic work, Hill, Flower, Fog is accompanied by Greetings from Hill, Flower, Fog, a limited-edition book of her own photographs, which she says relate “moments of pause, peace, and communion experienced at home.” They are simple images of familiar objects. Bougainvillea bobs against a sunbleached wall; the full moon floats in rose-tinted dusk; shadows fall across a deep green lawn. These small moments are charged with a sense of the ineffable; each one feels like a fleeting record of time’s passing. In its aimless repetition, free of moments of tension or drama, the music of Hill, Flower, Fog conveys a similar sensibility—a kind of serene estrangement from the everyday. The year has presented us with much to rage against; Sprague’s benevolent music gives us reasons to be grateful.","The soft and luminous six instrumental tracks on Sprague’s latest release convey a sort of serene estrangement from the everyday.

Point the Flashlight and Walk,Told Slant,by: Hannah Jocelyn,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5fa0370f06efd255af1f0966/1:1/w_160/PointTheFlashlightAndWalk_ToldSlant.jpg,2020-11-19 06:00:00,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/told-slant-point-the-flashlight-and-walk/,Double Double Whammy,"The last time Felix Walworth released an album as Told Slant, they had company. Walworth was a founding member of the Epoch, an indie-pop musical collective that imploded toward the end of 2016; in the wake of that dissolution, Walworth made Point the Flashlight and Walk, the third Told Slant album, almost entirely alone. Compared to 2012’s Still Water and 2016’s Going By, which took inspiration from the screamed laments of early Modest Mouse, Point the Flashlight and Walk is brighter and more polished—a pop album, by Told Slant’s standards—but its themes are even heavier than usual. Its 12 songs are like a series of anecdotes, if not outright character studies, interrogating loneliness and unrequited emotions, offering a sense of communities lost and a person unsure how to define themselves again. The contrasting sound and subject matter make Point the Flashlight and Walk Told Slant’s most accessible record, but also their most intense. Walworth is one of many queer people to find solace in Bruce Springsteen, and on Point the Flashlight and Walk, they took direct influence from 1982’s Nebraska, the rock icon’s most desolate and solitary album. The songs here are largely about characters who depend on and are devoted to each other, even if it means destruction for everyone involved. Many of the album’s themes are corollaries; the pointlessness of perfunctory relationships, the benefits of solitude, the dread of being stuck in that solitude. On “Flashlight On,” neither party can meet the others’ needs: “I would turn into you and you would turn into me/two empty things exchanging emptiness.” The narrator of “No Backpack” recognizes a similar destructive codependency, but opts to trudge on anyway: “I don’t want to run from you/When there’s no one you’re afraid to lose/You lose.” Walworth’s refrains often involve similar repetitions of terms, resembling intrusive thoughts more than conventional choruses. In tweaking their own formula, Walworth also finds clever new tricks. “Moon and Sea” comes a little too close to early Death Cab for Cutie, but for a listener raised on that sort of bookish indie pop, the song’s uncanny familiarity dovetails neatly with its observations about refusing to leave the comforts of home. “From the Roofbeams” spins an elaborate aural metaphor based on phasing, a concept in audio engineering and music theory involving overlapping patterns that fall out of sync with each other. “Talking out of phase with you,” Walworth sings, followed by an incantation of “I can” that falls out of phase with itself, eventually becoming “Can I,” then “Can I stop loving you?” That sense of playfulness—albeit in the service of serious topics—is new for Told Slant, and a part of the reason why Point the Flashlight and Walk can seem joyful despite its darkness. For an album about codependency and instability, this is sonically the most stable of any Told Slant release. It’s still raw, occasionally out of tune and time, but Walworth is a more confident singer, and the mix sparkles in a way that Told Slant didn’t before. “Bullfrog Choirs” is an outright pop song, its synths and pianos resembling AOR classics like “Solsbury Hill.” But Walworth and mix engineer KT Pipal stop short of full-on ’80s worship, never losing the project’s signature intimacy. Compared to the first two albums, which might as well have been recorded in the white voids of their cover art, these sounds have depth and dimensionality. If the previous records felt like eavesdropping on something private, Point the Flashlight and Walk sees you and invites you in. Told Slant’s music, from the beginning, expressed a yearning for that kind of connection. On “Tsunami,” from Going By, Walworth hoped for anyone to “Tuck my hair behind my ears and say/Isn’t this silly, and aren’t you beautiful?” Various Epoch members grant Walworth’s wish on the recording, repeating the refrain back to them one by one. But intimacy doesn't solve underlying problems in oneself or a relationship. As Walworth put it in a Talkhouse post about Point the Flashlight and Walk, referencing Springsteen: “What happens after Mary takes that long walk? What if nothing changes, and it’s our own fault?” The album's characters are equally alienated together or apart, in stasis or movement. Nothing changes, but they walk on.","Felix Walworth’s third album of skewed indie pop is solitary but inviting, setting songs about the pitfalls of intimacy against the most accessible sonics of their career.

Muvaland EP,Cakes Da KillaProper Villains,by: Madison Bloom,Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5fb41c2b81b0ec8cc2cc6ee0/1:1/w_160/Muvaland%20EP_cakes%20da%20killa.jpg,2020-11-19 06:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/cakes-da-killa-proper-villains-muvaland-ep/,Classic,"Cakes da Killa knows there’s nothing more lethal than a deep cut swiftly dealt. The Brooklyn rapper is a master of unrelenting flows and skewering affronts, made all the more ruthless by his razor’s-edge humor. On the new EP Muvaland, Cakes teams up with New York producer Proper Villains, whose vigorous house beats don’t rival Cakes’ intensity so much as egg him on. The music is pumping, primed for Cakes’ motor-mouthed takedowns. His endless digs—at squares, lesser MCs, and unworthy beaus—are served at top speed, but it’s Cakes’ saucy charm that makes them land just right. Muvaland clocks in at a trim 14 minutes, including two clipped interludes. Cakes’ takes are so spicy that the first song starts with a sizzle, a high hiss that precedes the spitfire sax licks, aluminum high-hats, and circular French touch bassline of “In Da House.” Cakes bounces through, asserting dominance in the art of playful insults. “How you never gettin’ fucked but keep a stick up your butt?” he asks. Forget kicking a man while he’s down—Cakes will dance all over the sucker. “Don Dada” elevates Cakes’ knack for provocation. Easily Muvaland’s best track, it’s a turbocharged banger with the same ecstatic, scrappy energy as “212”-era Azealia Banks. Buoyed by Proper Villains’ crisp hip-house, Cakes growls, snarls, and snaps—and still manages to enunciate every sharpened consonant. He dethrones MCs with “flows softer than marshmallows and goose feathers” and razes skanks with the EP’s most memorable line: “All you dick riders on my body like vultures/You did it for the clout, I did it for the culture.” Filthy, joyful, and fearless, “Don Dada” captures every facet of Cakes’ style. Hercules and Love Affair alum Nomi Ruiz joins for “ICU,” Muvaland’s most blissed-out offering, a late-night club cut that doubles as a mating call. Cakes rattles off dedications and instructions, as if beckoning a boy across the dancefloor. Ruiz plays wingman and jumps in on the insatiable hook: “Ooh baby don’t ya just stand there, I know you like what you see/Paws pressed all over my body.” The final line is a succession of “de dee dees” more satisfying than they have any right to be: In a record packed with syllables, these nonverbal ones communicate the most pleasure. Muvaland came together in the first weeks of lockdown, when Cakes and Proper Villains found themselves in need of creative collaboration. Proper Villains supplied the beats, and Cakes laid down the entire EP in the span of one afternoon—a testament to the speed and precision of all Cakes’ records, as well as his arresting freestyles. Present circumstances are hardly ideal for club music, but Muvaland bangs on with searing beats and scalding verses. Cakes decks himself in pink lace and diamonds, tosses off the haters riding his ass “tighter than True Religions,” and becomes the only rapper to successfully rhyme “quarantine” with “guillotine.” It’s a 14-minute flex parade leading straight to the throne.","With saucy charm and ruthless takedowns, motor-mouthed Brooklyn rapper Cakes Da Killa claims center stage on a collaborative EP of house bangers with producer Proper Villains.

People,TV Freaks,by: Stuart Berman,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5fb2b20975036015cef9085b/1:1/w_160/people_tv%20freaks.jpg,2020-11-19 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/tv-freaks-people/,Schizophrenic,"People, the fourth album by TV Freaks, is dedicated to This Ain’t Hollywood, a recently shuttered venue in the band’s hometown of Hamilton, Ontario. Named after the 1982 album by local first-wave punk legends the Forgotten Rebels, This Ain’t Hollywood was everything you could want in a scuzzy rock’n’roll dive: Seventies B movies showing on a bank of old TV sets behind the bar, piss-stenched bathrooms covered in Sharpie and band stickers, and a psychedelic Johnny Cash painting gazing upon the room like some all-seeing eye. Since forming in 2010, TV Freaks have effectively served as This Aint’s unofficial house band, brandishing a manic style of Stooges-spiked hardcore that embodied both the gritty edge and welcoming, misfit-clubhouse vibe of the space. But while the sight of venues closing has become all too common in the COVID era, the writing was on the wall for This Ain’t Hollywood long before the pandemic hit. The building was initially put up for sale in 2018, a circumstance that speaks to another invisible force affecting urban music scenes: the market-driven transformation of once grungy corners into prime real estate. People is TV Freaks’ first proper album in five years, and while it was made well before This Ain’t Hollywood announced its closure this past spring, it’s a fitting—and necessary—progression for a band that can’t go home again. On the surface, People doesn’t appear to be a concerted effort to break overground; it was recorded live off the floor by frontman Dave O’Connor at a home studio in a single weekend. (Like 2015’s Bad Luck Charms, it was mastered by Aussie DIY demigod Mikey Young, of Eddy Current Suppression Ring and Total Control). But while the opening “Destined for Stardom” seems to mock the very idea of swinging for the fences, the song’s sudden transformation from a staccato stomp to a dance-punk sprint suggests that if TV Freaks aren’t about to conform, they’re at least willing to contort. Growing up within garage punk is often a fool’s errand that requires bands to adopt the very qualities—sing-along melodies, classic-rock conventions, modern production touches—that are antithetical to the genre’s primal essence. But on People, TV Freaks pull off the uncommon trick of making themselves more accessible without sounding any less irascible. In the past, O’Connor often had to bark himself hoarse in order to be heard above guitarist TJ Charlton’s in-the-red riffs, Vivenne Bell Bright’s pugilistic basslines, and drummer Nathan Burger’s double-timed gallop, but the repressed flamboyance and trembling distress in his voice belied his imposing aggression. He has explored those qualities more freely in the new-wave goth-soul serenades of his solo alias, Sweet Dave, but on People, TV Freaks take full advantage of his violent-to-vulnerable range. You can hear the band broaden its horizons even in a two-minute blitz like “Souvenir,” where O’Connor alternates between stoned ’60s-garage melodies and bugged-out, David Byrne-like convulsions. But the results are all the more impressive when he uses his voice to invest the band’s righteous racket with a greater emotional depth and heightened sense of drama. Where “Space” begins as an unsubtle homage to Spacemen 3’s psych-punk rave-up “Revolution,” the song is ultimately less a call for war than a cry for help, capping its panicked chorus with a warning—“This is my last resort”—that, intentional Papa Roach quote or not, sounds like an ominous dispatch from a point of no return. The references are even more overt on “Heart of Gold”—not a cover of the Neil Young classic, but fueled by a similar quest for purity in a world where everything’s “just a different shade of beige.” As its bass-throttled, post-punky urgency gives way to an extended blur of overlapping melodies, the song is elevated from trashy to transcendent. None of this is to suggest that TV Freaks have lost their absurdist sense of humor; it just manifests itself in more abstract, meta fashion. Coming from another band, the opening line of “Saturday Night”—“You want to party on a Saturday night/It’s gonna be, it’s gonna be alright”—might seem like the height of rock cliche. But when O’Connor adopts his finest goth monotone atop a churning “She’s Lost Control” rhythm, you’re thrust into some bizarro-world parallel universe where Joy Division are playing weekend keggers. The tension between TV Freaks’ irreverent and insolent sides hits its fever pitch on “Capital Eye,” a motorik Neu!-wave ripper that reaffirms O’Connor’s eternal outsider status as he declares, “I can’t/Stare at/Anything/Beautiful too long.” But he delivers those words via the album’s most infectious shout-it-out-loud hook—and even as Chartlon launches into a spastic solo, O’Connor continues to repeat the mantra as if locked in a trance. Maybe he’s just marvelling at his band’s newly realized potential: When faced with the rare garage-rock album that’s as tense and tuneful as People, it’s easy to be mesmerized.","On their fourth LP, the Hamilton, Ontario garage punks step up with a more ambitious and accessible sound without sanding down their raw edges.

Songs to Yeet at the Sun EP,SOUL GLO,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5fb2ac4b57dd0d6f34eb4928/1:1/w_160/Songs%20to%20Yeet%20at%20the%20Sun%20EP_Soul%20Glo%20.jpg,2020-11-18 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/soul-glo-songs-to-yeet-at-the-sun-ep/,Secret Voice,"On the week Soul Glo released their new EP Songs to Yeet at the Sun, the outcome of the presidential election was largely seen as resting in the hands of Black Philadelphians such as themselves. After spending a half-decade deftly scrutinizing their tokenization in the DIY hardcore scene and the limitations of white allyship, Soul Glo surely saw the irony of this newly obsessive and granular interest. Songs to Yeet at the Sun arrives after an entire election cycle where the Black vote was delegitimized on one side, taken for granted by the other, and seen as a monolithic body by both. “If that cop had taken a further step than just putting his hand on his gun, and shot us right there, we might never know whose side yr really on,” Pierce Jordan screamed in one of the many instant quotables from 2019’s THE NIGGA IN ME IS ME—an album whose cover commemorated their 2018 arrest in Missouri and the subsequent GoFundMe that exceeded the $15,000 bail requirement, which the band members claimed was three times the amount normally charged. Soul Glo’s music is firmly based in intersectional identity and lived experience, providing an opportunity for many to see themselves represented while challenging any attempt to label or categorize them. Early in September, Soul Glo dropped Songs to Yeet at the Sun’s feral opener “(Quietly) Do the Right Thing” just weeks before the Breonna Taylor verdict inspired new protests in Philadelphia. Soul Glo’s songwriting is generally more in line with the Coup’s absurdist, anarchic humor than Public Enemy’s stoic militance, but the parenthetical isn’t played for laughs here. Here and elsewhere, Jordan fixates on how to operate ethically in an artistic community where clout serves as the primary currency. But as widespread protest reignited interest in Spike Lee’s eternally resonant masterpiece over the summer, it also served as a reminder of the fear-mongering that surrounded its original release. Like Spike Lee, Soul Glo are not interested in solutions. Their music feels like the unignorable act of violence that follows after more socially acceptable forms of communication have failed. Songs to Yeet at the Sun is destructive and abrasive hardcore that nonetheless feels utopian. “(Quietly) Do the Right Thing” functions as Soul Glo’s stylistic syllabus, cross-referencing D.C. hardcore, West Coast thrash, and Midwest screamo while Jordan’s feverish, foaming vocals betray their love for Korn. The end of “29” smuggles “Great Balls of Fire” piano riffs into a post-hardcore Molotov, whereas the production on “2K” finds a common space between industrial grind, pornographic sex raps, and morbid horrorcore. “Don’t get me wrong, but don’t get me fucked up!” Jordan announces at the very top of “(Quietly) Do the Right Thing.” He’s interested in expressing an anger and urgency potent enough to require the lyric sheet posted on their Bandcamp—and even then, the run-on sentence structure, clipped verbiage (“YT,” “yr”), and pile-ups of agitated question marks make them writhe on the screen. A collaboration with the Richmond DJ and trans artist Archangel, “2K” is about the only time where the lyrics are clearly intelligible. Songs to Yeet at the Sun rushes forward as if written in real time, slices of life that give voice to the marginalized—Black, queer, trans, musicians, “non-essential workers”—and make them feel accessible to anyone who doesn’t immediately identify. It’s essentially a concept piece about what it means to be broke as fuck in 2020. “Microbudget all your 20s, not just the bills,” Jordan shrieks on “29,” a painfully detailed account of having to penny-pinch to afford exorbitantly priced SSRIs. Meanwhile, as marijuana becomes legalized and commercialized across the country, Jordan sees only people like Elon Musk and “each and every Punk Goes Crunk white nigga” standing to benefit. “It’s places you can cop legally, but till they drop my nigga’s charges, it don’t mean shit to me” he shouts on “Mathed Up.” “Trump’s going to be great for punk rock!” has served as a running joke for the past four years, but it’s not the assumption of great music that prompted laughs. Rather, it’s the belief that Donald Trump somehow represented a clean break in our supposed arc towards moral rectitude rather than a logical endpoint for the American experiment. “Our era is a marketplace of contained demolitions, pleasant distractions under commercial supervision, and affordable suicidal coping mechanisms,” Jordan cries on the closing track—a sentiment true of the Obama era and the promised return to “normal” when none of Soul Glo’s demands for police reform or debt cancellation get addressed. “Joe Biden’s going to be great for punk rock!” will probably be a running joke too, but the moment Pennsylvania ostensibly tipped the election, the one thing I wanted to hear most of all was the next Soul Glo album. By the end of “I’m on Probation,” the possibilities for Soul Glo appear limitless, leaving Songs to Yeet at the Sun to feel cruelly unfinished after its 12 minutes have passed.","The revolutionary Philadelphia hardcore band expand the genre’s possibilities on their new EP, which feels cruelly short at only 12 minutes.

FlySiifu’s,Pink SiifuFly Anakin,by: Stephen Kearse,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5fa03b1df6b189eaea25b1fe/1:1/w_160/fly%20siifu_pink%20siifu%20fly%20anakin.jpg,2020-11-18 06:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/pink-siifu-fly-anakin-flysiifus/,Lex,"Fly Anakin and Pink Siifu share a commitment to community. Fly Anakin, a member of Richmond, Virginia rap collective Mutant Academy, moves with an official unit. Pink Siifu, a wanderer with roots in Cincinnati, Birmingham, and Los Angeles, lacks a formal affiliation, but he’s a fixture of multiple scenes. On FlySiifu’s, the two toast to their support networks and merge them into a village of music enthusiasts and free spirits. The record has the feel of a summer cookout in the park, joy and fellowship flowing freely, friends coming and going. Set in a record shop that’s named after the rappers but not owned by them, FlySiifu’s follows a day in the life of two languid store clerks. Part Next Friday, part Clerks, the album is stuffed with goofy interludes and skits where customers call the shop and leave angry and yearning voicemails. MadLib, who provides the dusty, hollowed-out beat on “Time Up,” and J Dilla are clear influences. (One customer requests a copy of Welcome 2 Detroit.) There are few choruses, and the pair rarely trade lines or thread their verses together, but their styles have subtle chemistry. Fly Anakin is a showman, streaking through beats with slick, nimble flows, while Pink Siifu is the shaman, his rapping hushed and anxious like prayer. Together they make songs that are heavy yet light, bleak yet resilient.

The production style ranges from dreamy chopped loops with crisp drums to soupy mixes with dollops of texture. Jay Versace’s ghostly piano sample on “Mind Right” leads to verses laced with defiance and dread. Twinkly tracks “Clean” and “Runthafade,” both produced by Lastnamedavid, are breezy and leisurely, yielding full-throated boasts and punchlines. “I’m gold like C-3/Mother fuck a P.O.,” Pink Siifu says, on the former. Fly Anakin follows his lead, repping Richmond: “Divide the James River when I start to practice on the weekend/I hopped the fence and peeked in/My opulence precedes ’em.” The highlights are the moments when they lean into the contrasts between their styles and voices. “Spades’” is split down the middle between flash and shadow, Fly Anakin swishing around internal rhymes and colorful threats with the precision of Cam’ron: “You know you owe us, nigga/Cold fish pushing boulders, nigga/Focus got you open/Now you loc’in/Bitch you bogus,” he raps. When Pink Siifu takes the reins, the song turns existential: “What more can I say?/How much can I say?/Who can I pray for?/So much to pay for/We find a way.” Both verses address betrayal but come to different conclusions, Pink Siifu offering redemption to Fly Anakin’s retribution. It almost feels like a debate. Between the skits, the freeform song structures, and the length, FlySiifu’s is a bit too meandering, rarely tapping into the fusionism the title implies or playing up Pink Siifu and Fly Anakin’s differences. But the bond between the artists is clear, as is the resonance between their communities of rappers, producers, and singers. Though they don’t bridge new worlds or sounds here, they confirm the implicit connections between their formative muses, threading the outré time signatures of J Dilla and Madlib, the spiritualism of Dungeon Family, and the flair of Dipset into a cozy tapestry. It’s not groundbreaking, but it is home.","The two students of J Dilla consolidate their skills to create a free-spirited project around joy and fellowship, with a few meandering moments.

Time Makes Nothing Happen,M. Geddes Gengras,by: Andy Beta,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f99b16441f5fbd885689b9b/1:1/w_160/%20Time%20Makes%20Nothing%20Happen_M.%20Geddes%20Gengras.jpg,2020-11-18 06:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/m-geddes-gengras-time-makes-nothing-happen/,Hausu Mountain,"Roland Barthes’ Mourning Diary—a posthumously published set of fragments written as the French literary critic grieved his mother’s death—is a tumult of disembodied musings, one of which synthesist and producer M. Geddes Gengras repurposed for the title of Time Makes Nothing Happen. Originally self-released on Bandcamp in May, Time Makes Nothing Happen has been reissued six months later on experimental label Hausu Mountain, and the title increasingly reads more like a koan. If the pandemic lockdown in spring seemed to slow life to a crawl, how has our perception of time been further distorted, half a year on? Recorded live by Gengras on modular synthesizer, Moog, and Elektron Machinedrum, the set’s teeming, sputtering morass of blips and squiggles has a mesmerizing effect. If every day since mid-March has felt a bit like Groundhog Day, this might be the soundtrack for it, reveling in the drudgery of quotidian routine. Throughout Time Makes Nothing Happen, Gengras toys with the tropes of electronic dance music (repetition, meter, gridded quantization), only to gradually veer off into unkempt wilderness. The visuals accompanying both releases hint at that opposition: The cover of the Bandcamp release is a pane of glass that replicates a pattern of corrugated metal, while the Hausu Mountain art is a dense collage of video-game foliage. Building up and then erasing each component, the album can feel manicured in one stretch, corroded the next. Gengras’ approach makes his modular setup seem more like a terrarium in which total control is impossible; the would-be world-builder is resigned to patience, careful pruning, and a willingness to live with the outcome. The title track summarizes the cumulative effect of the whole album in five minutes, presenting a seemingly impenetrable surface of bleeps, glassy timbres, and subliminal thumps. Gengras plays with expectations and anticipation as elements go blipping out of earshot and then fall back into place, to the point where you question if they ever actually vanished or were there all along. Rather than build toward release, the track instead dissolves into purgatory, like waiting on a subway platform for a train that scrapes and echoes down the tunnel yet never pulls into the station—and unexpectedly finding yourself standing not on concrete, but dirt. In Gengras’ hands, motion itself becomes illusory. There’s a tingling electronic pulse at the start of “Time Is a Marble in a Bucket,” and the introduction of a deep bass throb conveys a quickening sensation. But just when a breakthrough feels imminent, you’re instead bundled in a staticky wool blanket, all crackle and dark space. Lullaby-like chimes are soon distended and paired with an approximation of a cowbell clonk on “Slip the Tape Through a Corkscrew, Pull and Repeat,” widening into a roomful of cuckoo clocks going haywire as they strike the hour. The final tracks on the album add the Elektron Machinedrum and wind up in slightly more conventional territory; the only real surprise amid the straightforward, club-friendly thumps of “Bend (Edit)” and “Throttle” is that the floor never really drops away. Which feels a bit like an inversion of expectations, if only because after nearly an hour of dizzying befuddlement in the tangle of Geddes Gengras’ machines, when something finally happens on Time Makes Nothing Happen, it winds up feeling a little less interesting.","Originally self-released during lockdown’s first wave, these unpredictable modular-synth pieces toy with rhythmic convention while perpetually throwing time out of joint.

Beautiful Havoc,$NOT,by: Nathan Smith,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5fb2a9a73dd6b0f57138db8e/1:1/w_160/Beautiful%20Havoc_$NOT.jpg,2020-11-18 06:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/dollarnot-beautiful-havoc/,300,"Florida has proven to be a hotbed of innovative rap talent over the past decade. Born in New York but bred in West Palm Beach, new 300 signee $NOT lyrically embodies the cutthroat ruthlessness of many of the Sunshine State’s rappers, but his new album Beautiful Havoc is a far cry from the overcompressed emo of XXXTentacion or the lo-fi experimentalism of Raider Klan. $NOT’s sound is more amorphous and elusive, perhaps less cutting edge but also harder to pin down. Beautiful Havoc presents a spectrum of ever-changing moods, reflecting the binary suggested by its title. The tone is mostly relaxed and casually charismatic, anchored by $NOT’s precise and direct delivery, but there’s a creeping negativity on the margins. Lead single “Revenge” is buoyed by a sing-song chorus and melodic bounce, but as the track goes on, $NOT’s flow shifts into something more like a growl, his voice deepening menacingly as he warns us of his propensity for acting out and the “pistol on his waist.” Like many of his regional peers, $NOT credits Memphis rap as a primary influence, along with the legion of Memphis-influenced cult icons who have emerged online in the last decade, like Xavier Wulf and BONES. But for $NOT the legacy of Memphis manifests more in attitude than actual sound, beyond the Kingpin Skinny Pimp sample that opens Beautiful Havoc on “Watch Out (Intro).” You can hear the South in the frequent moments across the album where the beat pauses and slows to a chopped-and-screwed crawl. $NOT can be assertive, braggadocious, and brash, but he also demonstrates a soft, even romantic side. His debut full-length, this year’s - TRAGEDY +, was considerably lighter in texture and tone than the work of the rappers he lists as inspirations. It could often be almost delightful, filled with chilled-out guitar lines, cooing backup vocals, and bright synths, though his tongue occasionally slipped into the twisted flow of Three 6 Mafia and their imitators. On Beautiful Havoc, in contrast, a sense of darkness lies just beneath the surface, occasionally giving way to depressive moods. “I don’t wanna talk to nobody ’cause I don’t feel fine,” he raps on the weary “Life”; “I just wanna chill by myself ’cause I’m not OK.” Though $NOT’s sound hardly qualifies as emo rap, there’s often a tumultuous cloud hanging nearby: “Six million ways to die, choose one/And I think livin’ on this Earth is one of ’em.” $NOT has said in interviews that he struggles to rap over pop beats, but there is an inherent poppiness to Beautiful Havoc’s production and catchy, frequently gentle melodies. $NOT’s music often sounds like a fusion of indie-pop instrumentation (“Demanding” is complete with ukulele and bells) and trap drum patterns. There’s guitar all over the album, but on tracks like “Havoc” and “Who Do I Trust,” the guitar styling is smooth, almost flamenco in feel, as opposed to the punk-inflected sound so common to contemporary rap. His lyrics may be straightforward—full of familiar rap tropes of trust issues, infidelities, and material gain—but the production often borders on the whimsical. Though the album’s guest appearances can feel like brief cameos, $NOT is confident enough in his own voice not to rely too heavily on any other. On “Mean,” Flo Milli is like a character actor next to $NOT’s smooth leading man. When fellow Floridian Denzel Curry shows up on the flute-driven “Sangria,” it’s like a thunderclap of aggression, a marked contrast to how cool, calm, and collected $NOT comes off. The Denzel Curry feature illustrates what $NOT shares with his region and how he stands apart. What’s come to define so much contemporary Florida rap is its extremity, emotionality, and intensity. $NOT’s music also contains these qualities, but in a more limited quality; his work is sonically polished and immediately accessible, if not always the most aesthetically distinctive.

Pluto x Baby Pluto,FutureLil Uzi Vert,by: Brandon Callender,Contributor ,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5fb29ebea470daa51dd9e3a2/1:1/w_160/Pluto%20x%20Baby%20Pluto_Future%20&%20Lil%20Uzi%20Vert.jpg,2020-11-17 06:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/future-lil-uzi-vert-pluto-x-baby-pluto/,AtlanticEpic,"Future and Lil Uzi Vert might as well be on two different planets right now. Uzi’s still hot off Eternal Atake, one of the year’s best rap albums, and its star-studded B-side, LUV vs. The World 2. On the other hand, Future’s most recent release was High Off Life, a record in which he sounded nearly asleep, as if operating on autopilot. One of the only highlights from High Off Life was the bubbly, Uzi-featuring “All Bad,” a strange yet welcome breath of fresh air that felt like an Eternal Atake cast-off. A collab album from Uzi and the man who inspired his Baby Pluto persona felt inevitable after they appeared on each other’s albums, but the disappointing two-pack of “Patek” and “Over Your Head” from this summer left much to be desired. However, Pluto x Baby Pluto is more than a slight improvement from their earlier missteps—it’s like watching two friends trade lives for a day. They warmly embrace each other’s production choices on here. Future sounds just as comfortable over the cartoony, electronic Working on Dying production as he does on DJ Esco’s racing melodies. The cheery horns and rattling drums of “Bankroll” sound like they were ripped straight from a Stunt Taylor mixtape. The chaotic tracklist puts producers like WOD’s Brandon Finessin and NeilaWorld’s Lukrative, who first rose to prominence on SoundCloud, on the same album as Atlanta veterans like Zaytoven. What Uzi brings to Pluto x Baby Pluto is a revitalizing energy that makes Future wake up for the first time since The WIZRD. On “Marni on Me,” they trade bars over ominous whistles, trying to one-up the other with uncounterable flexes. “I push a button my car need no keys,” Uzi says with a carefree shrug. “I push a button, the car drive by itself,” Future immediately fires back. As the album goes on, their designer lifestyle gets even more animated and expensive. They talk about owing money to Elliot Eliantte and buying out stores in Paris as if these were regular occurrences. But even with all this super-charged energy, it’s hard to ignore the moments where Future lags behind, like his unimaginative hook from “Sleeping on the Floor.” If a project from Future and Lil Uzi didn’t spend some time trying to get their exes to fall back in love with them, it wouldn’t be a project from them at all. On “I Don’t Wanna Break Up,” it’s bizarre hearing someone as self-serious as Future right after Uzi goes full pop-punk on the chorus. “Tryna make better decisions, tryna be more consistent, yeah,” Future dreamily sings. “I’m going through hell just to get to you again.” Despite their newfound chemistry on Pluto x Baby Pluto, Future and Uzi’s best rapping comes when they’re left alone to get lost in their own thoughts on their solo songs. Future raps vividly about betrayal over the prickled keys and piercing strings of “Rockstar Chainz.” Uzi sounds like he’s rapping every bar as soon as he thinks of it on “Lullaby,” not giving himself a chance to forget a clever thought. “I try my best just to hug her with my fingers crossed, cause I know deep down inside, I am really doing wrong,” Uzi painfully exhales. Throughout Pluto x Baby Pluto, it’s hard to escape the feeling that Future is playing catch-up with Uzi. It wouldn’t be the first time Uzi’s out-rapped an Atlanta legend on a collab tape. Regardless, it’s exciting seeing how they’ve learned to play off of each other’s energy. It’d be easy for Uzi to coast and phone in verses after the year he’s had so far, but he’s shown no signs of slowing down.","The two rappers show great chemistry on their collaborative mixtape, even if Future sounds like he’s dragging slightly.

Send Them to Coventry,Pa Salieu,by: Will Pritchard,Contributor ,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5fb2aadec92af906c466c6e8/1:1/w_160/Send%20Them%20To%20Coventry_Pa%20Salieu.jpg,2020-11-17 06:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/pa-salieu-send-them-to-coventry/,AtlanticWarner UK,"To “send someone to Coventry” is to ostracize them, cast them out, and cut them off. The origins of the phrase are unclear: Most date it to the English Civil War of the 1600s; one writer suggests it’s a reference to being “hanged from a covin tree.” Either way, the gist that lingers is of the post-industrial West Midlands city as an unwelcoming, unforgiving place. On his debut mixtape, Pa Salieu draws a more nuanced picture of his hometown—a place of violence, but light and hope also—and takes his stand for a generation of marginalized young people. Last October, the British-Gambian 23-year-old had 20 shotgun pellets picked from the back of his head after a drive-by shooting put him in hospital. Three months later, defiant, he unleashed “Frontline,” a taut, wiry slice of UK rap that detailed his brushes with violence growing up in the Hillfields suburb of Coventry. The track promptly blew up—and the industry cogs spun into motion. Salieu toured the UK’s rap radio shows, laid down freestyles, and saw his name appear on line-up after festival line-up. Send Them to Coventry was originally penciled for early summer, just in time for the live dates. What happened next is, by now, a familiar tale: a delayed release, canceled bookings, and months hunkered down in the studio. The pause, Salieu has since said, was a welcome one. He took the time to develop his craft and to consider new ways of blending his love of Gambian folk music (he frequently cites his auntie, who performs as Chuche Njie and is sampled on “B***K”, as an influence) with his regular teenage rotations of Tupac and Vybz Kartel. Salieu’s Gambian heritage and embrace of the West African inflections in his speech have made for comparisons with J Hus, but the more relevant association would be the way he’s emerged with his own distinct mode of expression. Salieu flows in the space left by scattered drums and is acutely attentive to not only the meaning of his words, but the sound of them, too. On “My Family,” he trades punchlines and plosives with fellow breakout star Backroad Gee; the track pops and fizzes with a menacing, stop-start energy. Seemingly throwaway lines like “Chitty chitty, bang bang, four-door dinger/Ting go ‘clap’ tryna hit them figures,” manage to squeeze cartoonish references, paper-stacking aspirations, and Salieu’s own real-life trauma into a tight handful of rhythmic syllables. It’s in these deft moments, and his broader artistic flourishes, that Salieu releases himself from the UK rap mold that early admirers have squeezed him into. Combining elements of dancehall, Afrobeats, hip-hop, and grime are now par for the course in the UK’s saturated rap scene, which can make it difficult to innovate. Pa Salieu makes it look easy. On “Over There,” he bends the pitch of his voice to inhabit a cast of characters and skips from trap trills to baile breakdowns without missing a beat. “Betty” packs all the lyrical braggadocio of road rap, but the track’s lean, skittish drum rolls, and Salieu’s playful delivery—dancing between a half-sung flow and full-throated proclamation—round off the sharp edges and transform it into something else entirely. On “More Paper,” he mourns the death of his best friend over gentle rimshots and a synth line that could have been lifted from Clint Mansell’s score for Black Mirror’s “San Junipero.” He channels Youssou N’Dour’s rich harmonies on “Flip, Repeat”; the offbeat stabs of “No Warnin’” and picked guitar on “Block Boy” nod to canonical West African pop.  This is an extraordinarily assured first offering from a young artist capable of surprising at every turn. The result is not so much a foreboding portrait of a forgotten, boom-and-bust city, but an invitation to a place and people unduly ignored—and an introduction to an artist who won’t be. Not so much sent to Coventry, then, as visiting voluntarily.","On his debut mixtape, the British-Gambian rising star breaks away from the UK rap mold and establishes himself as a voice for the marginalized.

Monument,Molchat Doma,by: Ashley Bardhan,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f99b02bf6b189eaea25af2e/1:1/w_160/Monument_Molchat%20Doma.jpg,2020-11-17 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/molchat-doma-monument/,Sacred Bones,"It’s impossible to talk about Molchat Doma without mentioning TikTok. This year, the Belarusian new wave band’s shadowy, wriggling “Судно (Sudno),” from their 2018 album Этажи, unpredictably sprouted as a meme and racked up more than 150,000 associated TikToks. Some videos—outfit try-ons, armpit hair dye jobs—are presumably unrelated, but many involve images of Eastern Europeans vibing as Americans yearn for the same vibes in the comments section. The song’s principal association is of a post-Soviet lifestyle that’s vaguely anti-establishment, bare-bones yet filled with techno, a nebulous aesthetic aided by the fact that the majority of Americans don’t understand Russian. Molchat Doma’s newest and third album Monument doesn’t pander to their broadened audience with English-language lyrics or “Судно” copies. Instead, it brings the ’80s gothic dream the band first envisioned on 2017’s understated С Крыш Наших Домов to an anxious, glossy head. The performances sound more confident, the music less muddy. Singer Egor Shkutko’s grumbly baritone is better controlled, packing the intensity of a Russian Ian Curtis. There’s even a bit of maximalist sparkle coming off “Дискотека / Discoteque,” where an eager flurry of keyboard accompanies Shkutko as he sings about dancing fervently at a house party. It’s a bright pop sentiment on a song that sounds like the Cure, or like-minded Russian new wave messengers Buerak, and its earnestness makes for a welcome break from the band’s usual chilliness. But Molchat Doma does despondency well, even with song titles as amusingly explicit as “Ленинградский Блюз / Leningradskiy Blues,” a tinny, sleepy track detailing a doomed love that spans centuries. Shkutko often fixates on ghost stories like these, pleading with someone he has wronged to let him drown peacefully in “Утонуть / Utonut’,” or mythologizing a lover as he reconciles with his own mistakes on “Звезды / Zvezdy.” TikTok has equated Molchat Doma with a more debonair darkness; Monuments makes their solemn intensity clear. As an American with a Bulgarian mom, I recognize the aesthetic appeal of Eastern Europe firsthand. Whenever I visit Bulgaria, I find myself Instagram-ing the crumbly cobblestone or chipped Cyrillic signs, and my baba looks at what I’m photographing and asks why. It has to do with contrast: America builds enough Apple Stores and gentrification condos to convince you that society isn’t crumbling, while Eastern Europe is mostly too poor to keep up pretenses. My fellow members of Gen Z, who’ve grown up surrounded by social media and its warring obsessions with authenticity and artifice, resent that. America is nothing if not inauthentic. And yet, when it comes to international music, young Americans can’t help projecting. A notoriously monolingual crowd may have a hard time accepting Molchat Doma’s music as art with a particular historical and cultural context, not just a vehicle for a romanticized socialist fantasy—something that people on TikTok have already noticed and decried. It’s also hard to say why Molchat Doma is the object of American obsession, especially when Eastern Europe’s coldwave renaissance is filled with bands that sound a lot like them. Maybe it’s the way Shkutko sings like he’s reading his last will, or the grim precision of the drum machine. Molchat Doma’s music is so mystically self-possessed that it’s hard not to wish you were part of the magic, too.","The Belarusian new wave band’s latest album is an austere gothic dream with no interest in pandering to the audience attracted by their improbable TikTok breakthrough.

Stolen Car,Carl Stone,by: Jonathan Williger,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5fb2ae653dd6b0f57138db90/1:1/w_160/Stolen%20Car_Carl%20Stone.jpg,2020-11-17 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/carl-stone-stolen-car/,Unseen Worlds,"For the past 40 years, Carl Stone has been atomizing recordings of ubiquitous and obscure music alike, transforming his source material into kaleidoscopic fantasies. His electronic compositions, stuttering and illusory, repurpose minute sonic elements from a wide variety of different genres, splicing, looping, and contorting them beyond recognition. They are referential but speak entirely with their own vocabulary, liberating Stone’s sounds from the dual constraints of expectation and commodification. Steve Reich’s “Come Out” and Terry Riley’s “You’re No Good” are antecedents, but Stone’s music is less appropriative and more celebratory. When he started experimenting in the 1970s, he was primarily splicing magnetic tape; in the ’80s, he became an early adopter of digital sampling and delay, using early Macintosh computers to manipulate recordings via MIDI. He now uses a laptop and the audio programming language Max/MSP to mince sounds and paste them back together again in shapes that only tangentially reference their original form. Regardless of the technology used, his process of weirding the dominant ways we experience different styles of music remains consistent. After two compilations of pieces from between 1973 and 1993, Stone’s early work has recently reached a wider audience beyond the Los Angeles avant-garde scene that nurtured it. The techniques he pioneered have become increasingly relevant in the music of artists like Angel Marcloid (aka Fire-Toolz and Nonlocal Forecast) and labels like Orange Milk, where disparate stylistic elements are collaged at breakneck speeds, pushing back against the streaming era’s algorithmically derived systems of genre formation. Stolen Car, Stone’s third full-length in two years (a notable acceleration for him), sits easily alongside albums by this new wave of omnivorous experimentalists. While many of his early compositions unfolded over entire album sides, these pieces are closer to pop music in structure and length, and seem mastered to do battle in the loudness war. These are more likely sly references to contemporary pop than a capitulation to accessibility; Stolen Car is a dizzying array of stylistic signifiers virtuosically tied into complex knots. At times it feels like Stone’s music is a secret decoder ring unlocking the infinite possibilities hidden within other recordings. “Figli” and “Ganci” were constructed using the same sample, but listening to each is a radically different experience. “Ganci” is slow and deliberate, an elongated vocal line stretched over an oozing mosaic of shadowy voices and electronic tones. It feels mournful, the repeated wordless phrase a mantra of indecipherable discontent. From there, “Figli” charges forth, frenzied and euphoric. A voice that once seemed pitiful flutters about in miniature snippets at the speed of hummingbird wings, pinging between the left and right channels in euphoric bursts. For over three minutes, its chopped melodies float weightless before a long awaited drop of steady four-on-the-floor kick transforms it into what could be (only semi-ironically) referred to as a “banger.” The track works just as well as a club-ready pop song as it does a thoroughly baffling avant-garde composition. That deft manipulation and recreation of pop music’s emotional impact out of apparent chaos is a substantial part of what makes much of the music on Stolen Car the most fully realized of Stone’s career. On many of his early experiments the focus was on process, and he often let the loops he created unfold according to systems that weren’t necessarily reflective of the sample’s original form. Tracks like “Bojuk,” however, have distinct sections that recur, almost like a song, and the magic is in the melody itself rather than the glitchy cuts that have become his hallmark. In a recent interview with Tone Glow, Stone discussed having until recently “tuned out popular culture” after discovering avant-garde music and other forms from around the world. But even as he revels in the prismatic decimation of his source material, he seems more appreciative of song craft and rhythmic consistency than ever. It’s telling that the album’s least engaging piece, “Saaris,” is also its longest: Lacking the gleeful builds or dynamic structures that define the rest of the record, it consists of a simple muted chord progression looped for over 10 minutes. One of Stone’s major accomplishments with Stolen Car, as in the best of his earlier work, is his ability to highlight unique sonic elements of music from around the world—pop from Asia and the U.S., European classical, folk traditions from pretty much everywhere—while simultaneously unifying them under one aesthetic framework. Listening to his music, it can be nearly impossible to determine where he may have sourced any given sound; the joy comes from abandoning any quest for provenance and listening instead with unbiased ears. Stolen Car celebrates the universality of music while acknowledging the singular attributes that make styles and traditions appealing, bringing us closer to a unified understanding of the power of listening. Better still, it does it not as an academic exercise, but with excitement and reverence.","The veteran avant-garde composer’s third album in two years places him alongside a new generation of collage artists, tying a dizzying array of stylistic signifiers into complex knots.

Because of a Flower,Ana Roxanne,by: Philip Sherburne,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f99b4fae6fc05c7f21c78af/1:1/w_160/Because%20of%20a%20Flower_Ana%20Roxanne.jpg,2020-11-16 06:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/ana-roxanne-because-of-a-flower/,Kranky,"When the California ambient musician Ana Roxanne reinterpreted “I’m Every Woman”—a Chaka Khan disco classic famously covered by Whitney Houston in 1992—as “I’m Every Sparkly Woman” on her debut EP in 2015, there were multiple levels of meaning nestled inside its rippling oscillations. Most immediately, the song nodded to the ’90s R&B that Roxanne’s mother and aunts sang at family karaoke sessions after moving from the Philippines to the U.S. Her selection also suggested something about the way Roxanne hears the world: The swirling textures of Roxanne’s song echoed the atmospheric introduction to Houston’s version, as though Roxanne were finding commonalities between genres seldom mentioned in the same breath. Roxanne had more personal motives, too. When she was writing “I’m Every Sparkly Woman,” she told Bandcamp Daily, “I saw [it] as a testament to my femininity and empowerment as a woman.” But a few years later, after coming out as intersex, the meaning changed for her. “Now, I am not sure how I identify, but at least now I feel confident in that unknown,” she admitted. “When I perform that song now, it feels as though I am calling upon the confidence and beauty of the divas, and exclaiming that I love myself, whatever gender I may be.” Questions of gender, identity, and self-love frame Roxanne’s Because of a Flower, the follow-up to her debut. On a short, untitled spoken-word piece that opens the album, she envisions transcending binaries: “Yin, the female principle, and yang, the male principle… have joined, and out of their junction has come a third: harmony.” Her multi-tracked voice is split and processed into higher and lower registers, and she layers overlapping phrases as though reciting a round. Against this kaleidoscopic backdrop, she offers an elemental truth: “The spirit of harmony, as it condenses, produces all beings.” Drawing upon ambient, new age, dream pop, Medieval European choral music, and Hindustani singing, the album that follows feels like an emanation of that same spirit. As on her debut, Roxanne’s cool, clear soprano provides the centerpiece of most of these songs. Where “I’m Every Sparkly Woman” sketched lines between ambient and R&B, “A Study in Vastness” draws out the ambient quality inherent in choral music. The song is composed entirely of layers of her own voice; over a looping pedal tone that extends from start to finish, she wordlessly sings a descending figure in a minor key, adding soft microtonal counterpoints that slip between the lines of the stave. The resulting drone sounds faintly like the ethereal airs of the 12-century mystic Hildegard von Bingen; it feels like bathing in moonlight. Even when Roxanne adds more elements to her music, it sounds just as pure. In “Suite Pour L’invisible,” she sings wistful, wordless tones over patiently braided guitars before returning to the idea of duality: “Endless sorrow, endless joy, endless sorrow/I’ll hold your joy/I’ll hold your pain.” But lyrics are rarely the focus here; her singing is so slow, the patient arrangement so hypnotic, it’s easy to be swept away by the sound of her voice alone. Her music’s plaintive qualities often evoke Grouper (“Suite Pour L’invisible” sounds like a hi-def cousin to Ruins’ “Holding” or “Call Across Rooms”), and her billowing textures often recall Julianna Barwick. There are also affinities with the goth-adjacent dream pop of Cocteau Twins, This Mortal Coil, and Dead Can Dance, refracted through a new-age lens. “Venus,” a quietly ecstatic hymn to the constancy of the self, pairs radiant vocal harmonies with splashing waves and a reading from an astrological text; it sounds like vintage 4AD reimagined for sound-healing therapy. Roxanne changes gears with “Camille,” whose muted vocal tone and pitter-pat drum machine are reminiscent of Portishead and Everything But the Girl, while the instrumental “- - -,” a sparkling assemblage of DX7 chimes, shows that Roxanne doesn’t need her voice to enchant. She closes the album with another wordless piece, “Take the Thorn, Leave the Rose,” where her voice is close to a sigh. The album’s darkest song, built around brooding electric bass and guitar, it nods both to classic slowcore and also doom metal, while sounding not quite like either—evidence of a remarkable ability to fuse disparate influences into a unique form. Halfway through the song’s six-minute run time, it shifts: The guitars fade out, and in their place we hear Bach’s Prelude in C Major, BWV 846, from the first book of The Well-Tempered Clavier, joined by Roxanne’s voice, sounding ghostly and far away. Swathed in hiss, the piano comes from a slowed-down recording of Alessandro Moreschi—one of the last of the castrati, and the only one known to have been captured on wax—singing Charles Gounod’s “Ave Maria” early in the 20th century, more than 100 years ago. In his day, Moreschi’s heavenly voice supposedly inspired audiences to shout, “Long live the knife!”—a cry of adulation shot through with an intimation of violence. Today, threats of violence are familiar to many intersex people, and Roxanne has spoken of her determination to be an advocate for intersex kids and teens, many of them subject to nonconsensual surgeries in childhood. Inspired by both the trauma of the castrati and the transcendent beauty of their singing, “Take the Thorn, Leave the Rose” ends the album on a note both melancholy and tender—a gorgeous distillation of the empathy that guides Roxanne’s music.","The California ambient musician’s debut LP pulls from new age, dream pop, Medieval choral music, and Hindustani singing for a hypnotic and tender meditation on gender, identity, and self-love.

DISCO,Kylie Minogue,by: Katherine St. Asaph,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5fac746e41f5fbd885689f6a/1:1/w_160/disco_kylie%20minogue.jpg,2020-11-16 06:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/kylie-minogue-disco/,BMG,"Among the many perversities of 2020 is how much disco there’s been for a year without discotheques. From Róisín Murphy to Jessie Ware to Dua Lipa and Lady Gaga, musicians collectively longed for the unattainable dancefloor. Most of it is quite good, and none of it needs to advertise itself, with pay-attention ALL-CAPS, as DISCO. The idea of Kylie Minogue “going disco” is more than a little redundant: She’s made several decades’ worth of the stuff, including several modern classics. She has recorded (excellent) tracks called “Disco Down” and “Your Disco Needs You.” Kylie claimed in a recent interview that she never envisioned the album as “a concept”—dubious, since her next words were about how she imagined the title as DISCO from the start. But she built a home studio, immersed herself in deep cuts, leveled up her production skills, and engineered for the first time, all to prevent the album from becoming “a tribute record.” Whatever the album was that she conceived, the album she recorded is just that: a polyester-thin fabrication that sounds as if she just learned of disco’s existence during quarantine. While making the album, she redirected her producers to Earth, Wind & Fire YouTubes whenever the record started sounding like “electro-pop”—i.e., like herself. The lyrics drop names like Wikipedia: Studio 54, “I Will Survive,” the Electric Slide. Kylie works against her voice, trying to studio-contort her vocal into a dancing-queen diva or multitrack herself into a gospel chorus. If Golden sounded like Kylie LARPing country music, DISCO frequently sounds like Kylie LARPing dance—which shouldn’t happen. No one better expresses the record’s essential uncoolness than Kylie herself: “Gramps is on the dance floor. It makes me picture David Brent busting out his dad moves.” Uncool is not bad, and if anything, DISCO could stand more of it: to evoke actual disco in all its frisson and desperation, rather than the remembered-40-years-later version, full of kitsch and clip-art disco balls. The album, with a couple exceptions, has two modes: overly tasteful cruise-ship programming, and gauche rehashes. Kylie front-loads the weakest material—maybe passable in a set, but fatal in an album, where there’s no club to leave. “Magic” has a fizzy, sparky chorus, the sinuous melody of “Miss a Thing” has a little “Confide in Me” to it, and “Real Groove” pulls Kylie’s voice into rubber and sends it ricocheting, but none of the tracks go anywhere, and lose their energy less than halfway. “Monday Blues” doesn’t bring up energy so much as yank it back, coating its spangles in flop sweat. A “Celebration” remake that’s lawsuit-level blatant, it’s so studied it forgets to celebrate. Not everything is so doomed by comparison. “Last Chance” is also an obvious homage, this time to Donna Summer’s “Last Dance,” but the scenario comes with its own urgency, and while Kylie isn’t quite transcendent, she fills the role well. The album’s requisite appeal-to-deejay song, “Where Does the DJ Go?” is ridiculous (where does the DJ go after last call? Home, usually), but it’s an authentic kind of ridiculous, akin to the urgent, emotionally frantic, and absolutely real crises of raining men or blowing up a building with boogie. The overclocked “Voulez-Vous” arrangement helps; it’s brittle and a little too fast, sounding like stretching the night past its limits. On “Supernova,” Kylie’s voice has more bite and life than all the above tracks combined, even before the ecstatic soprano swoops toward the end. (It’s one of the few places on the album she works with her voice, not against it.) The metallic robo-chassis vocal effects, the intergalactic metaphor collision, and the desperate, high-key lust memorably evoke ’70s space disco novelties like “I Lost My Heart to a Starship Trooper.” The next track, “Say Something,” is the strongest and also the least disco. The track loses its sequencer a third of the way in, and when it comes back it’s left quiet. There’s no real chorus and almost no structure at all. What’s left is a luxuriant amount of space for Kylie to spiral higher, buoyed by rocket-exhaust sighs and airy choirs and zero-irony affirmations: “Love is love,” “Can we all be as one again?” Finishing the track reportedly brought Kylie and longtime cowriter Biff Stannard to tears; they knew they were onto something. Perhaps they got caught up in the moment. Perhaps the lyrics hit a bit different in spring 2020 than fall 2019; Kylie’s said as much. Perhaps they heard the sparkling moment where Kylie stopped being DISCO and resumed being Kylie.","The Australian pop icon has made several decades’ worth of great disco—yet her new album is a polyester-thin fabrication that sounds as if she’d only just heard of it recently.

Código de Barras,A.k.Adrix,by: Megan Buerger,Contributor ,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5fac804dcf46a2648df24913/1:1/w_160/Co%CC%81digo%20De%20Barras_A.k.Adrix.jpg,2020-11-16 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/akadrix-codigo-de-barras/,Príncipe,"Unlike the howling sirens that opened A.k.Adrix’s debut, the chaotic and aggressive Album Desconhecido, the Portugese electronic producer’s second LP begins, instead, with a deep breath: tender “ooh-oohs,” delicate piano trills, and syncopated beats that crackle like static. It’s soothing, and by almost every measure, a surprise. Adrix and the record label Príncipe Discos are closely affiliated with batida, the raucous, electric, turbulent sound that booms throughout nightclubs and block parties in Lisbon’s projects and slums. The style tends to explode with urgency and defiance, but Código de Barras is considerably less extreme, smoothing the sharp edges to an after-hours sheen. It’s a notable albeit curious departure from batida’s thunderous, disruptive core, but such mutations are inevitable in hyper-local strands of dance music. Besides, it’s captivating to hear this sound rendered with such melody and warmth. Adrix, formerly known as P. Adrix, was never a purist anyway. A Lisbon native of Angolan descent, he moved to Manchester, England at the age of 19, in 2015, and soon began incorporating elements of the UK underground into his Afro-Portugese palette. Album Desconhecido, released three years later, connected disparate traditions, intermingling kuduro, kizomba, and zouk with grime, jungle, and drum’n’bass. On Codigo de Barras, which translates to “bar code,” he continues this evolution, bending batida’s feverish rhythms into dense, hypnotic atmospheres. Using sleek synths, sensuous soundscapes, and playful polyrhythms that bubble and shake rather than clang and collide, he reveals a groovier side to batida—one that casual listeners can more easily sink their teeth into. Accessibility was not always the point. Príncipe’s releases are often dizzyingly complex, a signal to outsiders’ ears that this particular Afro-club hybrid is an inherently local sound. Core catalog cuts like Puto Tito’s “Melodia Daquelas” or DJ Marfox’s “2685” harness free-form energies, with spiky synths and spiraling flutes that ricochet aimlessly, while Nídia’s S/T sounds almost militantly percussive. Preserving this dissentient spirit has been important to the label, a way to show respect to the immigrant communities who have cultivated batida in response to Portugal’s racial tensions and colonial past. As Nídia told the New York Times in 2018: “When something comes from the ghetto, it can’t come softly.”  So how do Codigo de Barras’ pastel sketches fit into this bold-type mission? The answer appears to be in the shading. Despite their relative softness, these short, experimental songs are able to stimulate more nuanced emotions than brasher iterations of batida ever could: restlessness, suspicion, mischievousness, delight. Adrix seems curious about aggression’s limitations; what else might you hear, or feel, if you lowered the volume? His heady, inquisitive compositions, each hovering between two and three minutes, feel like attempts to fill in the edges. The balmy “Positividades” evokes an almost beachy atmosphere, melting syncopated rhythms into the surrounding synths. “Ambient Spirituale” and “Espuma Nocturna,” meanwhile, are dusky vignettes that turn inward, conjuring images of the natural world in gusts, ripples, and chirps. The laid-back pulse of “Ritmo Surfista” (“Surfer Rhythm”) finds a companion in “FL Studio, Obrigado,” a tune with flute-like synths and maracas that sounds like something you’d hear in a thatched-hut retreat. In these moments, it’s possible to forget the unbridled tension that typifies Príncipe’s lineup and consider batida in a more relaxed context. The album’s highlights, however, arrive in songs that leverage that unique tension into something exciting and new. “X50” is an irresistible, off-kilter, chopped-up club banger with an energy that belies its rhythmic complexity. And “Desenhos Animados” (“Cartoons”) is a revelation—a minimal symphony of woodwind melodies and asymmetrical beats that sounds at once precise and wholly spontaneous. Occasionally, it’s hard not to feel like something has been lost—bite, rebelliousness, a sense of rage—as Adrix has drifted further from batida’s boisterous center. But even if dissent is no longer his driving creative force, his curiosity is palpable. Innovative, left-field interpretations like this will propel the sound forward.","On his sophomore LP, the Manchester-based electronic producer again pushes batida into hazy new territory with an unusually subdued interpretation of the sound of his native Lisbon.

COA,ericdoa,by: Mano Sundaresan,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5fac7c9aeb2deab0b3f632dd/1:1/w_160/coa_ericdoa.jpg,2020-11-16 06:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/ericdoa-coa/,DOA,"At the core of “likewise,” a standout off ericdoa’s thrilling new album COA, is a massive, messy breakup made messier by stray heart eyes and the tease of celebrity. Singing with a scummy scowl, ericdoa channels all the hubris churning inside him, careening between late-night drives and money dances, bloodshot eyes and wads of cash on the nightstand. It’s what I imagine having your world shattered as an almost-famous teenager feels like. That’s the energy throughout COA, which vaults ericdoa into an unmissable presence in the glitchy, amorphous wave of online rap that Spotify curators want to call hyperpop. Loud, playful, and full of smoldering angst, it feels emblematic of the moods and textures that this scene aspires to capture. Then again, ericdoa himself is representative of what a hefty chunk of this crowd looks and sounds like: He’s 18 years old, deeply online, a disciple of Lil Uzi Vert, Bladee, and Lil Peep, and he lives in Georgia by way of Connecticut. His snarl sounds transplanted from a Hot Topic in 2005. In “movinlikeazombie,” one of his most popular songs to date, his bit-crushed alter ego Dante Red is drunkenly stumbling down store aisles, holding $3,000. That sort of absurd, imagistic writing isn’t entirely lost on COA—Dante makes a return on the delirious “do or die (interlude)”—but it takes a backseat. The record is instead caked with thick slices of melodrama, like the cavernous “self sabotage,” where ericdoa sings of screaming from rooftops about an ex he’s not over yet. Nearly every song on COA is about an ex that he’s not over yet: an ex pulling him in too close (“deep end”), an ex who tried calling him eight times (“2008”), an ex that texted him at 2 p.m. asking if he’s up yet (“thingsudo2me”). This surprisingly works in service of the record, rendering it a brisk, 23-minute gulp of teenage angst. The production, too, feeds into that feeling. COA is constantly twitching, lurching, finding new ways to shape and interact with ericdoa’s voice, which is tuned in different ways, layered, even chopped into tiny pieces. These producers—chief among them glasear and kimj, who contribute to eight of the 11 tracks—share the frantic mindset that no element of the beat is safe after ten seconds. The drums switch up a half dozen times on “mistake,” touching on EDM, drum-and-bass and arena-sized rock. “loose ties” fully unravels from ericdoa’s towering chorus into a soft, synthetic bed for Grandma’s verse. It’s an unhinged, indulgent record that can teeter on being overwhelming. ericdoa gets lost in the noise on “ivy,” where his verse is drowned out by the blaring drums. The opposite isn’t exactly appealing, either. The closing track, “plea,” is a sappy, cheap-sounding acoustic ballad clearly meant to function as some sort of grand turn or unveiling. But the bulk of this album operates in a sharp, controlled chaos that ericdoa thrives within. For a hyperpop scene still finding its footing (and itself) COA may prove to be a foundational work.","Loud, playful, and full of smoldering angst, the hyperpop rapper’s new album feels emblematic of the moods and textures that this scene aspires to capture.

It Serve You Right to Suffer,John Lee Hooker,by: Sam Sodomsky,Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5fac7b6106efd255af1f0cde/1:1/w_160/it%20serve%20you%20right%20to%20suffer_john%20lee%20hooker.jpg,2020-11-15 06:00:00,Jazz,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/john-lee-hooker-it-serve-you-right-to-suffer/,Impulse!,"The sound is solitary, pitch black, endless road. The backing band consists of three decorated jazz sidemen from New York: guitarist Barry Galbraith, bassist Milt Hinton, and drummer Panama Francis. The producer is Bob Thiele, head of the foundational jazz label Impulse! Records. The idea is to keep the tracklist down to just eight songs and let each one inhabit a mood, unencumbered by commercial demands for a single. They booked just one day in the studio. John Lee Hooker arrives on November 23, 1965. He is in his mid-to-late 40s—his official birth records were destroyed in a fire—and he has been playing the blues for most of his life. After spending his formative years travelling, working odd jobs, and performing live, Hooker had his first hit single with “Boogie Chillen” in the late 1940s when producer Bernard Besman recorded him alone at the microphone with an electric guitar. A second microphone was placed in a wooden pallet beneath his feet to capture the sound of his foot stomping to the rhythm. Ever since the release of that song, the avenues of his career seemed wide open as he searched for a way to recapture that spark. He recorded with different labels under pseudonyms to avoid a breach of contract with any of them. He released acoustic and electric albums; he played with small bands, horn sections, and second guitarists. Some of his ’50s work for the label Vee-Jay was among his most influential and inspired legions of rock’n’roll artists to come. Ry Cooder once described his music like cats quietly growling at each other in a cage: “It’s the sound of something disturbing,” he explained, “but you don’t know quite what it is.” Hooker had also tried playing with jazz musicians. In 1960, he released That’s My Story, an elegant set featuring members of Cannonball Adderly’s ensemble on brush-stroked drums, upright bass, and subtle rhythm guitar. “Everybody wanna hear my story,” he sang in the title track, which he recorded acoustic without any accompaniment. He then listed a basic itinerary of places he had called home: Mississippi as a child, then on to Memphis, Cincinnati, and eventually Detroit. “I had a hard time,” he concluded in his low, purring voice. “Now I’m doing alright.” Some more details: Hooker was the youngest of 11 children. His father was a sharecropper and Baptist preacher who had trouble relating to his son, a sensitive kid with little interest in physical labor or clergy work. When his parents separated early in his childhood, he chose to live with his mother, Minnie Ramsey, and her new husband, William Moore, a local blues musician. Inspired by Moore, Hooker left home at age 14 to pursue a career in music. Throughout his life, he cited Moore as his greatest influence, expressing regret that his stepfather didn’t live to see his style catch on. Hooker’s own style of guitar playing has been imitated but never matched. As opposed to the 12-bar blues that became a form of mainstream, post-war party music, Hooker’s blues is often based on just one chord pulled to its limits. With his right hand and foot, he keeps the rhythm: the thumping bedrock for his lyrics, which he delivers in an emphatic speak-sing, shaped by a childhood spent listening to church sermons and local blues singers. Because there is little melodic progression in the songs, Hooker adds the dynamics with his left hand as he navigates the fretboard. These riffs, responding to and anticipating his vocal melodies, become the central element of his work, at its most free-form and traditional. In the latter category is 1962’s “Boom Boom,” Hooker’s signature song that only takes five seconds to lodge into your head. He based the chorus on something a bartender said to him before a show and turned it into a song to play at that venue. When he noticed the instant response, he knew it would be a hit. Hooker’s operating principle is instinct. In the case of songs like “Boom Boom,” it turned him into a pop artist, writing music refined to its most pleasurable, immediate purposes: no tension, all release. You can hear in these songs an attempt at getting the crowd to their feet, banding together and forming a small utopia. One of his enduring nicknames is the “King of the Boogie.” In another sense, Hooker’s music is loneliness embodied, evoking a deep melancholy and longing. In a style that influenced Malian guitarists like Ali Farka Touré and Afel Bocoum, he glides up and down the neck of his instrument, sometimes throwing the whole thing out of tune with the force of playing. It sounds dissonant and chaotic, passionate and uncompromising. “As much as it was a joy to perform with him,” Keith Richards once observed, “you would really have to become him in order to play along."" No band understood this strange self-sufficiency more than the jazz ensemble on It Serve You Right to Suffer, Hooker’s lone album for Impulse!. Much of the material was music that Hooker had recorded before, all presented in new, skeletal renditions, as if he was testing the restraint of these virtuosic musicians. (“Just relax,” he instructed them, “as though you were in an easy chair at home, taking a coffee or something.”) As opposed to the acoustic arrangements on That’s My Story, this group decided to plug in, and they played with a ragged, sputtering electricity, constantly on the edge of darkness. It presents a fascinating challenge. Take “Bottle Up & Go,” one of the more upbeat moments. Drummer Panama Francis and guitarist Barry Galbraith find their rhythm quickly because Hooker sketches it out for them: Francis follows the pulse of Hooker’s right hand, while Galbraith mimics the melodic patterns of his left. On the bass, Milt Hinton has to fend for himself. You occasionally hear him reaching for a chord change that never comes, pivoting forward only to be met with the brick wall of Hooker’s picking and singing. When everything clicks, it is like falling into a trance. “Country Boy” is an eerie story-song whose narrative might take place during the same travelogue from “That’s My Story.” A man trudges between towns, late at night, in the dead of winter. As Hooker accentuates his lyrics with incidental flourishes high up the neck of his guitar, the rhythm section follows steadily like snow from a dark sky. Hooker sings about lying down from exhaustion on the highway; the band seems to know how he feels. The sadder the subject matter, the slower they play. In “Decoration Day,” Hooker sings about grieving while the rest of the world celebrates, oblivious to his pain, “just like the flowers that come in May.” The music is inconsolable, led by Francis’ shadowy brushes on the snare. The isolation in Hooker’s lyrics spans the record and makes even the more riotous moments—the desperate yelps as the band roars into action at the end of “You’re Wrong,” a cover of the Motown hit “Money” with trombonist Dicky Wells—feel slightly unnerving. Unsurprisingly, It Serve You Right to Suffer was not a commercial success, and in the span of Hooker’s vast discography, it never caught on as one of his classics. (The ’90s slowcore band Spain, however, have cited it as an inspiration.) In the late-’80s, Hooker reignited his career with the star-studded comeback album The Healer, and he began to embrace his role as an icon, leaning into the fuller, uplifting side of his work that more directly inspired rock music. The joyful catharsis of his sound, however, does not exist without its rock bottom, and much of Hooker’s career plays as a battle between these poles. There are blues musicians whose darkness defines them, and there are the ones who find the happy ending they deserve. “I believe in paradise,” Hooker said in 1997. “It’s here on earth.” Among his final releases were albums called Mr. Lucky, Chill Out, and Don’t Look Back. He spoke frequently about retiring but never ended up doing it. He owned several homes in California. He became a Jehovah's Witness and died peacefully in his sleep, well into his 80s. Late in life, Hooker still enjoyed performing live, often accompanied by famous devotees like Van Morrison, Carlos Santana, and Bonnie Raitt, who once called Hooker’s music “one of the saddest things I’ve ever heard.” Most setlists included a shapeshifting song he formally referred to as “Serves Me Right to Suffer,” a slow-crawling ballad that seemed to resonate more as time passed. During a ’90s performance with Ry Cooder, Hooker sang about living in a memory while the camera captured tears falling from behind his dark sunglasses. Hooker selected that song as the title track and closer for his 1966 album. But he made one pivotal change. While the version he performed live was a self-lacerating inner monologue, he now delivered it in the second person, directing the message outward: “Serve you right to suffer,” he sings. “Serve you right to be alone.” In the final moments, Galbraith strums his muted strings like an engine failing. The beat is slow, the pauses between Hooker’s words long and pained: “You can’t live on... that way… in the past... Them days is gone.” Then he hums a sad, little melody before the music fades abruptly and unceremoniously. He kept the lights low in the studio. It must have felt dead quiet. But outside, the world was loud and merciless as ever, already moving on. Get the Sunday Review in your inbox every weekend.

Spirit World Field Guide,Aesop Rock,by: Stephen Kearse,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5fa034ed9fb1590f60473f91/1:1/w_160/SpiritWorldFieldGuide_AesopRock.jpg,2020-11-14 06:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/aesop-rock-spirit-world-field-guide/,Rhymesayers,"Aesop Rock loves critters. Since his conscious turn toward storytelling on None Shall Pass, he’s become quite the zoologist, using pigs, crows, and his pet cat, among other animals, as muses. His fixation runs so deep that when he isn’t observing creatures directly, they’re still in his peripheral vision: He partners with Homeboy Sandman as Lice; his second album with longtime collaborator Rob Sonic was titled Beastiary; a Dali-esque dinosaur skeleton graces the cover of Skelethon. On Spirit World Field Guide, this fascination with creatures widens into a cosmology. Animals no longer play bit parts in Aesop Rock’s intricate tapestries; they are the omphalos, a turn that leans into Aesop’s wearied misanthropy and softens it. This is the most joyous album he’s ever made. Presented as a travelogue of the “spirit world,” a realm composed of occult and biological oddities, Spirit World Field Guide flips Aesop’s trademark anxiety on its head. Instead of retreating into his addled, overactive brain, he plunges into the “unwavering otherness” of the spirit world like an intrepid adventurer. His observations from the alternate planes of existence are surreal and psychedelic, from the “billion bats exploding out a mountain cave” on “Sleeper Car” to the loyal tentacles “in every corner of heck” on “Holy Waterfall.” Rapped with verve, every detail is delivered with a lysergic pop or an eldritch crackle, animals and action verbs smashed together like chimeras. Aesop has always been a vivid and imagistic rapper, but here his writing brims with wonder. “I leave an awkward conversation like a cow to the saucer/Inspire a thousand Our Fathers, people start calling their priests/ “We’ve never seen a man so vehemently drawn to the beast!” he says with a wink on “Crystal Sword.” One of his favorite life forms is himself, whom he renders with morbid clarity. Alongside Ishmael Butler and Kool Keith, Aesop is one of the few veteran rappers for whom aging is an experience and not a challenge. Instead of fighting his mortality, he dissects it. “1 to 10,” an ode to his ailing back, features the darkly humorous and human bar, “Rate your pain level on a scale from 1 to 10/I said “‘Well, doc I tell ya, it feel like I lost a friend.’” If you can't relate to that line now, you will. “Dog at the Door” is a tug-o-war between paranoia and composure, both emotions making his imagination run wild as he tries to identify an unexpected noise outside his house. “Maybe it’s a trap,” he repeats as his lineup of suspects grows more elaborate. He sounds like the spooked geezer he knows himself to be. Sometimes the pain doesn’t warrant a punchline. “Faking normal has worn me down,” he raps with weariness on “Boot Soup,” one of many moments where he lifts the curtain. “I shouldn’t even be here,” he assesses on “Kodokushi,” the Japanese word for the grim phenomenon of dead people being discovered long after their time of death. These blips of candor lack the emotional punch of similar moments on The Impossible Kid, where Aesop would build to and wind into his disclosures rather than shunt them into one-liners and asides. But even in passing, these confessions convey the heavy undertow of Aesop’s vision quest. His survey of the spirit world is clearly in service of enduring the flesh. In animals he seems to spy an undaunted sense of purpose. “A rat’s a rat/It scatters/That’s like it’s magic power,” he says with admiration on “Salt.” Producing has recently become Aesop’s second magic power. He’s been a producer as long as he’s been a rapper, contributing beats to all his records, and producing his last two records in full. Although aesthetically Spirit World Field Guide draws on his standard mix of electric guitar, laser synths, and crisp drums, he’s never before been such a commanding presence behind the boards. The beats here are the best of his career, full of torque and life. “Attaboy” flickers between squelchy boom bap and leisurely funk. The scuzzy guitar chords on “Gauze” rev up Aesop’s flows. The goofy, percolating wub-wub on “Crystal Sword” accents his RPG-inspired misadventures. These zany backdrops amplify his writing, selling the complete otherness of the spirit world. Spirit World Field Guide wears its concept loosely. As seen on Miss Anthropocene, Visions of Bodies Being Burned, and There is No Year, music about death and oblivion is often macroscopic, zooming out into a birds-eye view. Aesop does the inverse, sticking his head into the soil like an ostrich and conversing with the bugs and roots. His bizarro yarns are certainly eccentric and meticulous, but they’re always anchored by his fascination with the material and tactile: old, decaying bodies; gross smells; odd aches. By presenting the great beyond as a marvel rather than a horror, he makes it less unwieldy, and perhaps even appealing. “Why am I here if it isn’t effectively cutting the hellions out of me, huh?” he asks on “Gauze.” He’s talking about the real world.","On his new album, the verbose rapper’s fascination with creatures widens into a cosmology, resulting in the most joyous album he’s ever made.

The Angel You Don’t Know,Amaarae,by: Owen Myers ,Contributor ,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5fad954d920966129408ec61/1:1/w_160/Amaarae_The_Angel_You_Dont_Know_artwork.jpg,2020-11-13 06:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/amaarae-the-angel-you-dont-know/,Platoon,"Amaarae has a voice like a cracked-open chestnut shell; it can be as silky as its interior, as unforgiving as its spines. On “Hellz Angel,” a highlight from the Ghanaian-American artist’s omnivorous debut album The Angel You Don’t Know, she lattices smoke-wisp intonations before sharpening them into rapped barbs. In a spectacular flip into double-time, she raps over busted fairground synths, “I don’t make songs/Bitch I make memories.” She can’t resist following up with a gag: “I don’t like thongs/Cuz they ride up in jeans.” She is a nonchalant kind of auteur. Yet The Angel You Don’t Know crackles with innovation, a pacesetter at a time when industry bigwigs are waking up to the long-held truth that Africa is setting the global tempo for pop music. Amaarae’s music bears the Afro-fusion influences of Nigeria’s free-spirited alté scene, as well as Western genres from mall-rock to Southern rap, sultry R&B, and glossy Top 40: disparate musical styles that soundtrack Amaarae’s own life. Born Ama Serwah Genfi, she is based in Accra but has lived in the Bronx, Atlanta, and suburban New Jersey, where Britney Spears’ eccentric masterpiece Blackout blew her mind as a teen. While Ghanaian friends once advised her to stick to Afrobeats or hiplife to succeed in the country, she was firm that diasporic living enriched her art and, smartly, resisted narrowing its scope. In lesser hands, The Angel You Don’t Know’s wide embrace of genre could feel like a mash-up, or a crafty amalgam of trending styles. Yet with her distinctive arid singing voice and close work with producers like KZ and Rvdical the Kid, Amaarae’s freewheeling confidence and singular point of view allows her to swoop through sounds, light as air. She embraces character with enthusiasm, gliding between subjectivities with the same ease that she flips between American English and Ghanian and Nigerian dialect. On “Trust Fund Baby”—which sounds like Miguel’s slinky “How Many Drinks?” stripped to its skeleton—Amaarae plays a spoiled brat taunting a pathetic lover who needs the “privilege” of WAP like an addict craves their next hit. The Afropop-leaning “Jumping Ship” is an occasion for some righteous male objectification. “Hottie, you’re an item I wanna pay for,” she sings in a murmured falsetto, as picked guitars hit like sun through slotted blinds. You can hear the lusty twinkle in her eye. Amaarae describes The Angel You Don’t Know as “non stop affirmations and incantations 4 bad bitches.” Her tongue-in-cheek side brings dazzle to the record’s light-hearted moments, particularly on Afropop anthem “Sad Girlz Luv Money” (featuring Moliy), a waist-winding anthem about securing the “mooh-la-la” that’s far more joyous than its title suggests. More imaginative still is “Dazed and Abused in Beverly Hills,” 68 seconds of indie soul that enjoyably parodies (and one-ups) the SZA knockoffs making Shazam-bait for cable-TV syncs. Another track is punctuated by a ringtone and a scream, and the album is bookended by thrilling snippets of hardcore punk, with shredding by L.A. artist Gothic Tropic. Amaarae is private about her sexuality, but she dropped hints to her romantic life on the 2017 single “Fluid,” from that year’s R&B-leaning Passionfruit Summers EP, and featured drag queen pole dancers in another of her videos. These days she’s even more upfront, and rightfully heedless of gender norms. “I like it when you call me zaddy,” she purrs over 808s on “Fancy,” sounding like a soft butch poster girl looking for fresh meat. The video is a collagist tribute to seductive hits and her punk favorites, from JLo’s proto-OnlyFans camming to a Dream Wife body horror to the bright wigs and office furniture of City Girls’ “Pussy Talk.” It’s the rare moment in Amaarae’s world that doesn’t feel wholly self-created; even then, her authorial voice is clear. In one set-up referencing Missy Elliot’s “She’s a Bitch,” Amaarae wears a black leather bodysuit dotted with cowrie shells, the pre-colonial West African currency that is central to Yoruba rituals, pairing pop imagery with a touch of the divine. But even bad bitches get the blues. On the purple-hued album closer “Party Sad Face,” she’s stuck at a predictable party and fed up. “Whole lotta gang shit/Peng tings looking out of sight,” she whisper-sings, sounding helpless and sad. She fucks to fill the void, with alté star Odunsi (The Engine) breaking his usual charmer routine for an unsettling turn as an abusive hook-up. “I’m down,” she sings numbly, ambiguously. “Down for the night.” Amaarae said that she left the darkest songs off this album, but—unless she went full Diamanda Galás elsewhere—it’s hard to imagine a more vivid descent into emotional oblivion. Beyond her chameleonic roleplay, Amaarae’s humble roots are obvious—she dreams of the day she can buy her mom a Bentley. On the dancehall-leaning “Leave Me Alone,” she affirms her own worth with the calm of a zen master, singing, among bright and balmy guitars, “All the diamonds in the world don’t outshine me.” Her polyphonic approach to experimental pop brings to mind author and DJ Jace Clayton’s description of pan-global music in the digital age as a “memory palace with room for everybody inside.” Amaarae puts metabolized sounds through a distinctive prism, hitting on an insight: There’s room in the palace for her.

Share the Wealth,The Nels Cline Singers,by: Evan Rytlewski,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5fac6c58eb2deab0b3f632d9/1:1/w_160/Share%20The%20Wealth_nels%20cline.jpg,2020-11-13 06:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/the-nels-cline-singers-share-the-wealth/,Blue Note,"Although the veteran jazz and rock guitarist has long been celebrated for his fearless exploration, Nels Cline has a traditionalist streak, too. Perhaps it was the weight of the label’s history, but his first two records for Blue Note were two of the most conventional of his long career. His take on a romantic standards album, 2016’s Lovers, found him channeling his inner Bill Evans and Jim Hall, while 2018’s Currents, Constellations, with his dual-guitar quartet Nels Cline 4, offered more freeform improvisations yet eased off on the pedals and electronics that enable Cline’s more hallucinatory vamps. Both were skillful records, the work of a prodigy living up to his reputation. But depending on what you seek out a Nels Cline record for, they were also both a little tame. For his third album for Blue Note, Share the Wealth, Cline offers a more comprehensive summation of his tastes, with renewed emphasis on the atonal and edgy. Cline has always saved some of his wildest fusions for the Nels Cline Singers, an ensemble he’s led since before he joined Wilco and earned the adoration of a wider pool of indie rock fans, and for these sessions he doubled the size of that trio, welcoming keyboardist Brian Marsella, percussionist Cyro Baptista and saxophonist Skerik — all assertive players who aren’t shy about redirecting these pieces. Cline’s reverence for Blue Note’s history remains, and at its most lyrical, the set conjures echoes of the label’s ’60s post-bop releases, thanks in good part to the addition of Skerik’s tenor sax. But mostly the ensemble is interested in coloring outside the lines, and they play for impact as often as they do for grace. “Spiral” opens the record with a heady raga, bruised purple by Skerik’s convulsive sax. Cline’s coppery guitars take on a tinge of post-rock on “Beam/Spiral,” and that piece crescendos like a post-rock song, too, breaking open to reveal the album’s most jubilant refrain. “Princess Phone” and “The Pleather Patrol” recall the thick, shambolic grooves of Cline’s sometimes collaborators Medeski, Martin and Wood. Cline had never gigged with this six-piece iteration of the Singers before, and his original plans for these sessions were to splice them into an experimental collage. It turns out there was no need: The players built in so many dramatic pivots, twists and breaks that they didn’t have to pipe them in after the fact. The 17-minute centerpiece “Stump The Panel” plays out as a series of skronky, off-balance movements that approximate the kind of sharp edits that Teo Macero patched into On the Corner. It peaks halfway through with a spacey, trip-hop drum breakdown, then closes with a naked metal riff, a jagged edge at odds with Cline’s usually meticulously tuned guitars. Even for a Cline record, Share the Wealth’s scope is astonishing. Like many of his albums, it’s a big work, running 80 minutes, but it’s long because it needs to be—packed any tighter, these songs would be too busy, the flood of ideas too harried. For all their audacity and hunger to dazzle and surprise, Cline’s ensemble never forgets to let even the album’s showiest pieces breathe.","After two relatively tame records for Blue Note, the fearless guitar innovator renews his focus on the atonal and edgy with an ambitious, astonishing work.

People on Sunday,Domenique Dumont,by: Jemima Skala,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5fac6f7ee6fc05c7f21c7e36/1:1/w_160/People%20On%20Sunday_Domenique%20Dumont%20.jpg,2020-11-13 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/domenique-dumont-people-on-sunday/,The Leaf Label,"Domenique Dumont’s music has traditionally entailed a game of hide-and-seek, concealing vocals behind layers of reverb and placing the drums right up at the front of the mix, daring the listener to dig to get to the center of it all. The artist is no less forthcoming about his, or their, own identity. The project was previously said to be a collaboration between the Latvian duo of Arturs Liepins and Anete Stuce and an unnamed (and possibly fictitious) French artist. Five years after their 2015 debut EP, Comme Ça, Dumont returns as a solo act, though not much more is known about him. The duo made its name with the underground hit “L’Esprit de L’Escalier,” a chirpy song that was just center-left of outright pop, and their debut album on France’s Antinote label, Miniatures de Auto Rhythm, continued in the same vein of Balearic pop songs made to be enjoyed in the sunshine. By contrast, People on Sunday takes a more subdued—and more conceptual—tack. The album was conceived as an original soundtrack to a 1930 German silent film of the same name. Part documentary, part fiction, the film follows its characters, played by amateur actors, around a normal Sunday in Weimar Berlin, unwittingly capturing a snapshot of a city on the verge of cataclysmic changes. Accordingly, Dumont’s melodies are also like characters—soft and gentle, and often fairly sparse, yet imbued with all the sweetness, complexity, and intensity of the people they soundtrack. The album’s title track opens on a motif that loops like a stuck record, suggesting the unchanging rhythms of everyday routine, but new sounds—flutes, harps, chimes—are constantly coming and going, as though testaments to the little changes that interrupt that monotony. Album closer “Everyday Life” has a plodding cadence; it’s upheld by an arpeggiated pattern that bumbles its way through the song, embellished by other elements along the way. In their tweeness, these ornaments resemble the work of Mort Garson, the synth pioneer who composed his landmark 1976 album Mother Earth’s Plantasia to be played to houseplants. The return of the main theme after a significant breather, followed by a final metronome-like beep, recalls life’s ceaseless motion, ever forward, past the present moment and into the next. Dumont’s palette of vintage synthesizers imbues these vignettes with a quiet sense of wonder. “Gone for a Wander” is contemplative and placid, embodying the aimless pleasure of the song’s title. Dumont’s short flourishes adorn the slow, steady rhythm with moments of delight, like a wanderer stopping in a clearing to observe light bouncing off puddles. “Merry-Go-Round” is one of the busiest tracks on the album, populated with lots of different elements and held together by a single arpeggiated melody. Eventually, the smaller motifs blend into one colourful blur, just as the world does from the viewpoint of the center of a carousel. In little moments like these, the joy that People on Sunday radiates is self-evident, even when untethered from the film that inspired it. Like the film, Dumont’s soundtrack is about taking stock of the ordinary. It also imparts a valuable lesson, one that could equally apply to the events of this year: Savor the quotidian wherever possible, because who knows what tomorrow will be like.","The mysterious electronic musician, now a solo artist, scores a whimsical soundtrack to a 90-year-old German silent film.

Gone Glimmering,Chavez,by: Steve Kandell,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5fa2db7d4f418af766fd283d/1:1/w_160/GoneGlimmering_Chavez.jpg,2020-11-13 06:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/chavez-gone-glimmering/,Matador,"Chavez were a perfect comet of a band: At the height of the mid-’90s indie boom in New York, they made two filler-free albums in two years that sounded like each other but not like anything else, then didn’t break up so much as quietly stop existing. They never made a Difficult Third Album; they didn’t fade away because there wasn’t really anything to fade from. They were great and then they were gone. Their 1995 full-length debut Gone Glimmering and 1996’s Ride the Fader feature interstitial snippets of people gawping in delight at fireworks displays and roller coasters, and the songs that surround them aspire to that mood and that level of entertainment—primal thrills that are simple to understand but complicated to deliver. Chavez were Coney Island’s rickety, beloved Cyclone; you can hear the parts grinding and the danger of collapse is part of the fun. Chavez began life as a supergroup of sorts, at least by an extremely 1995 metric. Lead singer and guitarist Matt Sweeney had been in Skunk, who put out two albums on Twin/Tone that sounded like New Jersey’s answer to old Twin/Tone Soul Asylum. (This is a compliment.) Guitarist Clay Tarver had been in Boston’s Bullet LaVolta, which put out a couple of albums of East Coast grunge before breaking up in 1992. Chavez was (significantly) greater than the sum of these parts. Reveling in deeply unfashionable, doomy ’70s prog and proto-metal—titles like “Wakeman’s Air” and “The Flaming Gong” are signposts even if the dressed-down Lower East Side vibe isn’t—the nine songs on Gone Glimmering, built around Sweeney and Tarver’s call-and-response guitars and getaway-car squeals, all feel of a piece. You could listen to this album steadily over the course of 25 years and still not clock the exact moment when opener “Nailed to the Blank Spot” turns into “Break Up Your Band.” “Laugh Track” and “Ghost By the Sea” might be the perfect distillation of the band’s innate, almost symphonic sense of quiet-loud-quiet drama, and jittery closer “Relaxed Fit” bakes the ethos right into the title. Meanwhile “Pentagram Ring” is what happens when they trade that dynamic for an actual groove. They were tagged with the quixotic “math rock” label, signifying a bookish intent that the band’s influences and underlying hesher vibe couldn’t quite support. They were highly skilled musicians—drummer James Lo in particular—which almost seemed beside the point. An exhaustive, charmingly geeky video interview between Tarver, Sweeney, and Sadie Dupuis of Speedy Ortiz and Sad13 pegged to the Gone Glimmering 25th anniversary reissue goes deep into the weeds about tunings and approach, ultimately exposing the band’s signature assault as a series of happy accidents, a point Sweeney is adamant about. “I cannot play a single guitar part that Clay does in Chavez and he doesn’t know what I’m doing,” he told FRONTRUNNER in May 2020. “But those two guitar parts would work together well.” Compared to other recent Class of ‘95 reissues like Yo La Tengo’s Electr-O-Pura, Pavement’s Wowee Zowee, and Guided By Voices’ Alien Lanes, Matador’s anniversary reissue feels less about nostalgia or a valedictory salute than a re-introduction. The 1995 Pentagram Ring EP fills out this deluxe edition, with four tracks that feel in turns sludgier and more rudimentary than what wound up on the album proper. “The Nerve” is a heaping slab of “Custard Pie,” and “You Faded” is as straightforward and tuneful as they get. Once Chavez wound down, owing mainly to members getting grown-up jobs and a general lack of popular deterrent from doing so, Sweeney began his rise as alt-rock’s own Waddy Wachtel, playing with everyone from Billy Corgan, Guided by Voices, and Will Oldham to Neil Diamond, Adele, and posthumously, Johnny Cash. Tarver was an executive producer on Silicon Valley while bassist Scott Marshall (son of Garry, nephew of Penny) dove into the family business. Chavez regrouped for a handful of shows and a three-song EP in 2017, and while all this has helped burnish the band’s legacy, it hasn’t added any artificial weight or import to Gone Glimmering. The album hasn’t retroactively become a touchstone for a new generation of rock bands nor does it feel tied to its era as some indie artifact. But it may stand as a model of how to present a fully realized vision from moment one and then get out before anyone has a chance to fuck it up. Break up your band.","The indie rock band made two filler-free albums full of primal thrills and then disappeared. This reissue feels more like a reintroduction than a reassessment.

Lamentations,William Basinski,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f99acb0eb2deab0b3f62ecc/1:1/w_160/Lamentations_William%20Basinski.jpg,2020-11-12 06:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/william-basinski-lamentations/,Temporary Residence,"Though he deals in abstract sound, William Basinski in many ways resembles a visual artist. It was a picture—the diagram of Brian Eno and Robert Fripp’s tape-delay system on the cover of Discreet Music—that catalyzed his interest in that style of composition. His most famous creation, The Disintegration Loops, is as strongly associated with an image—the smoldering New York skyline after the 9/11 attacks—as it is with magnetic tape shedding its last oxides. And there is something sculptor-like about his intimacy with plastic loops, more attuned to the transient truth of the medium than the immortal dream of recorded sound. All of this fits with his great theme of mortal decline. The best description of Basinski’s music, including his latest album, Lamentations, is found in art rather than music theory. Mise en abyme, which literally means “put into the abyss,” describes an infinite sequence nested in different levels of reality: a story within a story, a picture within a picture, a reflection trapped between mirrors. By playing with loops as vivid as human lives—a wisp of piano, a speck of opera, a ripple of radio static—against one another, Basinski produces feedback loops that repeat until they become vanishingly small, not so much ending as slipping beyond our ken. Last year, Basinski released On Time Out of Time, for which he worked with scientists to capture the sound of two black holes merging more than a billion years ago. He called it a love story. While the high-tech collaboration was unusual for him, the personal touch wasn’t, and on Lamentations, he’s back to raiding his decades-deep personal archives for vintage tape to revive with new perspective and fresh feeling. If the beauty and dread of Lamentations plays out on a less dwarfing scale, the galactic rumble of the first song, “For Whom the Bell Tolls,” sounds as much like a black hole as anything on Time did, and the album’s theme has a sort of self-swallowing gravity. Lamentations shares a title with the biblical poem of exile and loss (“How deserted lies the city, once so full of people!”) and, to drive the point home, adds a whiff of Miltonic damnation with a track called “Paradise Lost.” “O, My Daughter, O, My Sorrow,” a study Basinski made for Robert Wilson’s opera The Life and Death of Marina Abramovic, is a haunting centerpiece. It integrates a passage of Svetlana Spajic singing an old Balkan song, a mother-daughter dialogue that doubles as one’s lament and the other’s celebration of the so-called loss of innocence. Focusing on a line that translates as “Out of joy, I could not fall asleep,” the track is exhilarating, and choked human emotion somehow rises through the mechanical phrasings of the loops. Other operatic samples appear in “All These Too, I, I Love”—chopped into mellifluous vowels for a moment of brilliant simplicity recalling Gas’s Pop—and “Please, This Shit Has Got to Stop.” That frank colloquial title breaks the elevated register, but there’s room for all in Basinski’s quiet threnody for one. If “Fin” is a doomsaying ending, where remnants of life flicker through vast, buzzing machinery, his great sorrow also allows kinder prophecies glint through, as on “Transfiguration,” which sounds like a string quartet casting a hesitant, hopeful theme into the abyss of the unknown. Paradise may forever be lost, but this elegant elegy is worth many returns.","The ambient composer goes back to raiding his decades-deep personal archives for vintage tape to revive with new perspective and fresh feeling.

Stock Child Wonder,Knox Fortune,by: Pete Tosiello,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5fab08f241f5fbd885689f2a/1:1/w_160/StockChildWonder_KnoxFortune.jpg,2020-11-12 06:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/knox-fortune-stock-child-wonder/,Nice Work,"There’s an opacity baked into the technicolor fever dreams of Knox Fortune’s solo work, euphoric washes of largely synthetic instrumentation—all of which begs to be played outdoors. His vocal inflection, usually multi-tracked in fuzzy layers, is at once ageless and genderless; his arrangements embrace industrialism (the featured instrument on “Strange Days,” the mesmeric standout from 2017’s Paradise, is a clattering spray can) as often as they hearken upon well-worn new wave acts. His music is so enveloping and bright that at times it leaves you waiting for the other shoe to drop—for the warm hooks to swerve offkey and for Fortune’s flower-child bliss to turn sour. That moment never arrives on his sophomore effort Stock Child Wonder, a record so expansive that its high isn’t dulled by mood stabilizers. Fortune’s absorbing melodies are subtler than they first appear: he rarely employs the same verse structure twice, and he frequently places instrumental breaks where you expect a chorus to be. The drum-based tracks “Static” and “Shirtless” are embellished with double-time vocal passages; and the offbeat synth on “Sincerity” allows Fortune to play loose with the time signature. If Paradise’s seeming effortlessness was its most charming quality, Stock Child Wonder’s unassuming formal complexities are an even greater testament to Fortune’s strength as a songwriter. Yet the melodies are only half the equation—as a producer, Fortune is equally devoted to presentation. The gauzy engineering, which might have been used as a crutch, instead provides leeway for his more eccentric impulses. “Shirtless” kicks off with a campfire guitar and closes with a delicate violin arrangement, whereas “Gemini” juxtaposes disco strings with Caribbean-sounding drums. The Elliott Skinner duet “Morning Light” is sequenced as the album’s centerpiece, a nearly six-minute percussion-less suite highlighted by an austere trumpet solo. Its sincerity isn’t entirely discordant, but it’s enough of an anomaly to seem slightly out of place on Stock Child Wonder, its ponderousness never revisited. Fortune got in on the ground floor of Chicago’s 2010s rap renaissance, producing for Joey Purp and Vic Mensa (who bestowed Fortune with his stage name) and notching a Grammy for his work on Chance the Rapper’s Coloring Book. Although Fortune’s solo records are more reminiscent of Beck than Do or Die, there are intuitive callbacks to Chance and the Social Experiment’s creative milestones and the frenzied idealism with which they stare down addiction and trauma. Given the overtly Christian tones of Chance’s subsequent music, Stock Child Wonder offers welcome reminders of the low-stakes innocence and exuberant spontaneity that made Acid Rap and Surf irresistible. On the energetic “Hideout,” Fortune sings, “We used to hide out in back of our house/Lay in the garden and cover our mouths.” It’s the same brand of first-person-plural snapshot found in Chance’s coming-of-age diaries and roller-rink reminiscences, but where Chance hinted at the despair lurking behind his drugs and faith, Fortune mostly eschews remorse: on “Come Over,” getting high and growing up are just things to do, preferably with a nice woman at your side. Stock Child Wonder pulls from a broader sonic palette than Paradise, yet feels surefooted even at its most discursive. Its disparate threads are held together by Fortune himself, who, for all his restraint as a performer, is at once earnest and undramatic. While his unvarnished lyricism yields a few bricks (“I couldn’t run unless I ran with you,” he croons on “Morning Light”), his best writing bears a visual alacrity, which brings to mind Evan Dando’s moony nostalgia. “Shirtless” finds its narrator and a companion riding around aimlessly in a sticky-seated Volvo. The narrative doesn’t really go anywhere, which is beside the point; in the final verse, Fortune sets the scene: “My skin stuck to the leather, on the couch in your apartment/In a heatwave in October, back when phones were Motorolas.” Even the ostensible breakup songs, “Change Up” and “Sincerity,” are so unflaggingly optimistic as to feel aspirational. Fortune doesn’t radiate naivete so much as he does unflappability. The final track, “Always,” a rapturous love song, breaks through Stock Child Wonder’s pleasant haze. The three-chord piano melody is the simplest on the album, and while its placement doesn’t undermine the rest of the record (as a finale, it recalls Mac Miller’s “Youforia,” the uncharacteristically ardent windup of Watching Movies with the Sound Off), it’s the only song that might accurately be labeled a ballad. Fortune stretches his vocal range, straddling countertenor and falsetto, and belts the swelling chorus. As a coda, it’s a tantalizing suggestion that he’s still only providing us with a glimpse.","The agile singer-songwriter smoothly transitions from the effortlessness of his 2017 debut to a sophomore record rich with complexities.

Didn’t You Hear? // Lucifer: Black Mass // Ataraxia: The Unexplained // Music From Patch Cord Productions,Mort GarsonLuciferAtaraxia,by: Brian Coney,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5fac487b014550c79b8d0c58/1:1/w_160/didn't%20you%20hear_mort%20garson.jpg,2020-11-12 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/mort-garson-lucifer-ataraxia-didnt-you-hear-lucifer-black-mass-ataraxia-the-unexplained-music-from-patch-cord-productions/,Sacred Bones,"On July 20, 1969, Mort Garson began his 45th year on Earth hunkered around a television set with family and friends. It was, after all, the day of the Apollo 11 moon landing, but for Garson, the moment held special significance. Having been asked by CBS to compose a six-and-a-half-minute piece to accompany their coverage of the moonwalk, he spent his birthday soundtracking magnificent desolation. “The only sounds that go along with space travel are electronic ones,” Garson opined on the eve of the event, watched by 600 million people globally. “I used a big, symphonic sound for the blastoff and a pretty melody for the moon.” Garson, who composed until his death in 2008, hadn’t always specialized in scoring feats of human endeavor. A classically trained Juilliard School graduate, the Canadian composer’s bread and butter was turning out jingles, TV themes, and the occasional hit like Ruby & the Romantics’ “Our Day Will Come.” Encountering the then-new Moog synthesizer—and its inventor Bob Moog—at a convention in early 1967 flipped the script entirely. A smitten Garson forked out $15,000 for one of the first models ever made and turned his Laurel Canyon home studio into his personal mission control center. Reflecting on the state of electronic music at the time, musician and author Thom Holmes said, “No one really knew what direction to go in. The Moog did not come with an operator’s manual, literally.” As the ’60s fell out of view, and with no handbook to rip up, Garson could only be impeded by a lack of imagination. Luckily, he was a futurist invested in the radical potential of electronic sound. His modular explorations—fine-tuned on the cozy pocket symphonies of his 1976 opus Mother’s Earth Plantasia—conjured up a synthetic sphere where far-out filters and raw electricity went light-years beyond any lunar surface. “He was really fascinated by the newness and what this machine could do and how it sparked his creativity,” his daughter Day Darmet recalled. “I think it woke him up from a world of commercialism.” Originally only available at screenings in Seattle, Garson’s soundtrack to 1970 oddity Didn’t You Hear? doubled as one of the first all-electronic film scores. Without context, vocalist Tom Muncrief's histrionics on the title track are jarring. But they are just a blip. “Death Talk and Jeep Approach” and “Sail! Sail!”—which foreshadows the corroded synth doom of Iggy Pop’s “Mass Production”—more than make amends. On the former, Garson summons an eerie tundra of panned whooshes and pitch-shifted bells the likes of which would have made the BBC Radiophonic Workshop proud. On a gentler note, the cutesy arpeggios of “Walk to the Other Side of the Island” is a hint of wholesome themes to come. Owing in part to the box-office success of movies like Rosemary’s Baby and Witchfinder General, the occult crept into pop-culture consciousness in the late ’60s. Majors like Capitol and Warner Bros. capitalized by releasing schlocky, spoken-word LPs like Witchcraft – Magic: An Adventure in Demonology. By 1971, Garson offered up some credibility. Marketed as a feature-length interpretation of esoteric phenomena, Black Mass saw him adopt the moniker Lucifer for an experiment in supernatural electronics. Titles like “ESP” and “Witch Trial” leave nothing to the imagination, but, like peaks “Solomon’s Ring” and “Exorcism,” they furnish the mind’s eye with imagined visuals, pairing rich melodies with white-noise bursts and contorted clangs. Though listeners are assured Black Mass “takes its subject matter seriously,” there’s a classic Garsonian comfort to the screwy spirit underpinning it all. It’s a niche Garson resumed when he became a tour guide to the paranormal for a second time in 1975. His sole release under the name Ataraxia, The Unexplained (Electronic Musical Impressions of the Occult) is a trove of dark ambience (“Sorcerer”) and a nostalgia bath of bubbling basslines (“I Ching”). Influence-wise, it’s a textbook case of give and take: The unearthly, new-age skulk of “Deja Vu” is essentially “Tubular Bells” 2.0. Opener “Tarot,” meanwhile, has the kind of driving 32nd-note pulse that John Carpenter would wield on his Halloween theme three years later. But the crowning glory is the first-time issue of Music From Patch Cord Productions. Raiding the archives, it spans subtly alternate takes of Plantasia tracks (a thrilling, extra-syncopated “Ode to an African Violet”) and hallucinatory sci-fi tunes like “Son of Blob Theme.” The album’s stylistic outliers are also their best. The disco funk of “Dragonfly,” which plays like a dreamworld duet between Pac-Man composer Toshio Kai and Yellow Magic Orchestra, exists whole planes apart from “Cathedral of Pleasure.” A paean to physical empowerment, the latter calls to mind Jenny Hval musing over Pino Donaggio’s wistful main title from Carrie. Looking back, it’s obvious Mort Garson was a jack of many trades and a master of one. At the dials and keys of his beloved Moog modular, his marriage of the fantastical with the everyday eluded comparison. Whether for outer space, or the quiet domesticity of home, he zoomed out to places unseen, or honed in on the familiar, bringing it to levels unconsidered. And just like he did on that momentous day back in 1969, Garson, Lucifer—whatever you want to call him—still guides his listener to not simply see the future, but look beyond it.","These reissued electronic works by the ’70s Moog pioneer marry the fantastical and the everyday, the whimsical and the occult.

FICTION EP,Suuns,by: Will Ainsley,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f985671e6fc05c7f21c786f/1:1/w_160/FICTION%20EP_SUUNS.jpg,2020-11-12 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/suuns-fiction-ep/,Joyful Noise,"Suuns’ music sounds so twisted and squashed because it is usually the product of several competing influences. Guitars repeat like arpeggiated keyboards, crisp percussion jostles for space with drum machines, and vocals snarl and quaver like synthesizers. The frontman for the Montreal four-piece, Ben Shemie, once said, “I like this idea of pressure,” which is evident on their latest EP. Hyper-compressed lead vocals and instrumentation repel each other, with each element blooming and reducing like blobs of oil in water. Fiction is clearly a direct descendent of Felt, Suuns’ 2018 studio album; “Death” even reuses part of “Moonbeams,” Felt’s penultimate song. However, the EP deepens and develops the band’s themes of dissociated helplessness introduced back in 2018. The songs here are underlaid with nervy, roiling sheets of babbling feedback. Austere arrangements are overlaid with warped electronics and distorted vocals, like if Gustav Klimt’s “Golden Phase” paintings were able to manufacture a car. Clearly defined, geometric images foreground muted backdrops in a way that gives a strange sense of physical perspective. Suuns tap into a specific mood: It’s not hazy, but faded. With all but one song clocking in at around three minutes, the EP is, naturally, brief. However, it never feels insubstantial because the sound of the whole thing is so spectacular. The digitized vocal treatment is one of the most striking elements here. Though present on Felt, it’s now inescapable. Shemie’s melodies can feel improvisational to the point of being atonal, but occasionally a gorgeous pop cadence plops out. There’s such a focus on distorting the voice that the effects seem to direct Shemie’s voice rather than the other way round. It gives the feeling as if it has a life of its own. Although the noisy, avant-rock EP feels dislocated from reality in a musical sense, Suuns end on a note of political anxiety. “Trouble Every Day” is a spoken-word piece lifted from a Frank Zappa lyric, backed by crashing jazz drums and a squalling guitar line. Originally written in 1965, the lyrics “I’m not Black but there’s a whole lots of times I wish I could say I’m not white” and references to “cops out on the street” are eerily prescient. In the past, Suuns’ world has felt insular and meticulous. They make cold, brutal music with song titles like “Paralyser” and “Control.” Fiction disturbs this categorization. Of course, it’s tempting to want more, more clearly-defined songs, more beats, more aggression, more of that sublime bweebeebewboo guitar line; there are only two straight-up-and-down songs here while the rest feel like sketches. The abstract seethe of “Breathe” is barely more than one looped refrain, all ticker-tape snares and slack metallic string sounds. However, Fiction is still a marker for the noise-rock stalwarts: a foray into something more instinctive and assured.","Even in its brevity, the Montreal four-piece art-rock band stage a foray into something more instinctive and assured.

Book of Curses,Adulkt Life,by: Arielle Gordon,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f9c2aa206efd255af1f088e/1:1/w_160/book%20of%20curses_adulkt%20life.jpg,2020-11-11 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/adulkt-life-book-of-curses/,What's Your Rupture?,"Chris Rowley is an unlikely mouthpiece for adulthood. As a vocalist in the bombastic Brighton riot grrrl group Huggy Bear, he balanced the sardonic sneers of Niki Elliot and the harmonic cheers of Jo Johnson with his dry delivery, a spoken-word spitfire of resentment and frustration. “Kids get in, pulled out by parent-core in a gravy of envy they're descending,” he barked menacingly on their 1993 record Taking The Rough With The Smooch, a self-aware portrait of teenage rage. But in the 26 years since the band’s predetermined 1994 disbandment (the group, ever principled, allegedly decided their three-year lifespan before they began the band), Rowley has experienced the inevitable yet unthinkable for a one-time punk: middle age. The 55-year-old is now a father with a day job at a non-profit, who until recently had left his days of “boy-girl revolutions” in the past. If Book of Curses, his blistering debut as the frontman of Adulkt Life, is any indication, Rowley’s taut temper has only grown more gnarled in the intervening years. The only thing more infuriating than societal expectations of adolescence, it suggests, is the paralyzing ennui of growing old. Adulkt Life (“no need to pronounce the ‘K’,” they insist) largely functions as a vehicle for Rowley’s lyrics, a focus that reflects the band’s inception. He connected with John Arthur Webb, who went on to found the British noise rock group Male Bonding, while shopping for records at Rough Trade in the early ’00s. Webb, upon discovering Rowley’s punk past, suggested that they record together. Their then-teenaged drummer and fellow Rough Trade regular, Sonny Barrett, was similarly sold after watching one of the sole live videos of Huggy Bear available on YouTube. With Male Bonding bassist Kevin Hendrick rounding out their sound, the band reimagines the intensity of riot grrrl within the brooding soundscape of post-punk and the thematic lens of fatherhood. There’s still plenty of Huggy Bear’s “sex and confusion” abound on Book of Curses, but the former is couched in more Freudian, fraught terms: “In your hand a ticking cock,” Rowley shouts repeatedly on “Clean (But Itchy),” rushed as if the phrase were a subconscious tic or an all-possessing hex. And where Huggy Bear once sang of schoolyard sexuality, Rowley surveys the youth with suspicion on “New Curfew,” his rage building with each pass of the song’s winding, bluesy guitars. “What are these kids, 9 or 10?” he asks, before swallowing existential threats of climate change delivered by his daughter: “She said dad one day this will be gone.” Where Huggy Bear once sang of robbing cops, Adulkt Life mines the inner conflict of seeing your child’s generation take up the fight against state violence: “I don't know what I feel when I hear sirens outside anymore,” he yells, an eerily prescient summation of the deepening generational divide on law and order. There’s an anxiety that pulsates through Book of Curses, from the squealing horns that pierce the opening track to the rumbling feedback that echoes throughout “Room Context,” like a storm brewing on a distant horizon. Rowley’s lyrical brevity darts between the equally sparse instrumentation—”Ha ha!” he taunts on “Whistle Country,” playing the counterpart to Webb’s blunt, dense guitar. “Whistle Country” channels the thrashing noise of Male Bonding into its barest possible sketches; each note lands with the intensity of their fiery debut, but with an added swagger. These are slow songs, but their rhythm crawls with stiffness rather than patience, played through hunched shoulders and bleary, bag-laden eyes. This is the measured, staggering punk of exhaustion, the tense lurch of a band that has internalized the cruel pacing of life itself—Book of Curses, much like adulthood, advances glacially until its building tension suddenly implodes. Adulkt Life delivers urgent music for evergreen unease. Rather than shouting for revolution, it screams into the void. It seeks to fill the emptiness left by endless PTA meetings, the ceaselessness of work, the unending charge of new, befuddling technologies. Their debut pummels with a confidence borne from nihilism, an acceptance that comes with the realization that history has no natural arc, and that life only grows more vexing after the high-minded certainty of youthful indignance has passed. It’s rock made by a man who refuses to buy a cellphone; it’s poetry written through gritted teeth and the forced parental facade of calmness in the face of chaos. But it’s also crafted with an insatiable verve, an almost triumphant fury. Book of Curses reaps the discontentment sowed through years of simmering anger, finding joy in perhaps the only reliable constant: the catharsis of punk rock.","This blistering punk-rock debut from a 55-year-old veteran of the scene delivers urgent music for evergreen unease. These are weary, angry songs, crafted with an insatiable verve and an almost triumphant fury.

Alive in the Hot Zone,Austin Lucas,by: Kim Kelly,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f99a851362a0a17e78b805e/1:1/w_160/Alive%20In%20the%20Hot%20Zone_Austin%20Lucas.jpg,2020-11-11 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/austin-lucas-alive-in-the-hot-zone/,Cornelius Chapel,"Every artist unlucky enough to release an album in 2020 has faced an unenviable choice about whether or not to address a certain elephant in the room, whether or not they consider themselves to be a “political” outfit. They can either try to ignore the horrors of the current administration and chance coming off as out-of-touch or ignorant, or choose to tackle the Trump era head-on, and risk feeling dated after the next geopolitical shift (remember all those Rock Against Bush compilations? Me neither, and I was their target audience). For heartland folk-punk singer-songwriter Austin Lucas, though, it was never even a question. He even went a step further by choosing to document a specific section of a specific year—namely, the late spring and early summer months of 2020, when the initial burst of the coronavirus pandemic and the Black Lives Matter uprising spurred by the killing of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor captivated the nation. It was a move that felt entirely in character for Lucas, whose sound occupies a sweet spot at the intersection of folk, punk, country, and Americana. The Bloomington, Indiana-born artist has long sported a “This machine kills zombies” sticker on his guitar in a clear reference to Woody Guthrie’s warning to fascists, and is open about his own anti-fascist politics, as well as his background in the DIY punk scene. The punk delegation has historically tended to excel at this particular task ever since the Reagan era ushered in a generation of vital hardcore (Anti-Flag’s rollicking, venomous 20/20 Vision is an excellent contemporary example), and Lucas released an anti-fascist anthem of his own with “Already Dead,” the first single off his new album, Alive in the Hot Zone. It has a poppy, anthemic feel that belies its sobering lyrical content. In just over three minutes, Lucas storyboards out the frustrating trajectory of slowly losing a loved one to the lure of fascist rhetoric, opening with the weary entreaty “Let’s talk, though we have nothing to say.” There are shades of Bruce Springsteen’s hangdog working-class malaise (as well as his stadium-filling sensibilities) tucked amidst the peppy chords, and Lucas nails the exasperated futility of a familiar conversation that was never going to go anywhere anyway. “Already Dead” is one of ten songs that offer direct commentary from the troubadour’s perch in Mainz, Germany (where he unexpectedly found himself weathering the pandemic after a trip abroad turned into an extended lockdown). While most of the album keeps to an even keel, the dystopian “American Pyre” comes barreling in with a woozy surf-rock vibe, and the twangy, nostalgic “Shaking” was made for playing in a busted-up van on a trip through big sky country. In other tracks, he slows it down, as on “The Truth Is Supposed to Hurt,” a poignant slice of Rust Belt gothic Americana, or the sweet, lonesome dirge of  “Anyone.” Lucas’ voice reaches unexpected heights on the delicate album closer “Holy Sparrow,” showcasing the upper reaches of an elastic vocal range that serves him well throughout but shines extra bright when he pushes it outside of his grittier comfort zone. (There must be something special about sparrows, because country icon Dolly Parton has been known to exhibit the same tendency). Though it was made in the midst of a deadly pandemic while its creator was stranded far from home and worrying about the fascist creep at home, Alive in the Hot Zone is more than just a diary of the plague year. It’s an emotional plea for empathy from someone who’s weathered more than a few runs of bad luck and heartbreak himself, as well as a call for political action. Lucas has been in this particular game for over two decades, and has used that time wisely in honing his sound and carving out a unique niche. Americana, punk, and folk all attract their fair share of misfits, but there’s no one quite like him.","On his latest album, the singer-songwriter documents the tumultuous months of late spring and early summer 2020, occupying a sweet spot at the intersection of folk, punk, country, and Americana.

Ephemera,Jim-E Stack,by: Eric Torres,Editorial Producer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5fa0316725aab0a1757fb911/1:1/w_160/EPHEMERA_Jim-E%20Stack.jpg,2020-11-11 06:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/jim-e-stack-ephemera/,AWAL,"Jim-E Stack has hovered around the fringes of electronic indie-pop music for a while now, first crafting homespun hybrids of club and dance music on 2014’s Tell Me I Belong. He’s worked with left-of-center pop artists as a producer and songwriter since, providing reverb-heavy synths and shuffling, distorted kick drums to songs by Charli XCX, Empress Of, and Caroline Polachek. On his second solo LP, EPHEMERA, Stack moves past the sample-happy instrumentals of his debut and instead teams up with several former collaborators for an upbeat 20-minute set emphasizing funk and synthpop arrangements that feel charmingly loose and lived-in. Stack pieced together EPHEMERA over the past few years from sessions with artists working on their own projects, but despite the title, the album doesn’t feel like a total hard-drive dump. Empress Of is laid-back and in high spirits on “Note to Self,” a chugging synthpop track with pitch-shifted vocal accents and shimmering piano. The song barely feints at a chorus, but the fractured details add up to a jubilant shot of self-confidence. Stack keeps the breeziness going on “Sweet Summer Sweat,” propped up by a hazy guitar loop and honeyed vocals from L.A. artist Dijon. Midway through, a lean club break packed with echoing sirens and cycling drums adds a euphoric kick of momentum. As EPHEMERA bends from blissful songs to more melancholy interludes, Stack builds on moods rather than memorable hooks. Bon Iver’s Justin Vernon lumbers over “Jeanie,” a scuffed R&B track submerged in guitars that resemble Jai Paul’s watery electro-funk (see also: the yearning, ruptured instrumental “Be Long 2”). The garbled “Lost Man” fares better, with an assist from London rapper Octavian over a snapping backdrop that calls back to Tell Me I Belong’s mid-tempo highlights. Stack doesn’t linger in the downcast headspace for long. On “Can We,” a gauzy pop song featuring Kacy Hill, he offers more solid structural and rhythmic ground. Stack produced the bulk of Hill’s airy second album this year, and the pair’s alchemy together feels weightless; here, Hill’s voice is slightly pitched up, dancing over rolling drums, whizzing synths, and funky guitar licks. EPHEMERA doesn’t make much of an effort to break new ground, but on “Can We,” Stack dials into his sweet spot, melding a dulcet vocal delivery with his own understated, soothing flourishes.","The Los Angeles producer’ upbeat second LP is a short, feature-heavy collection that emphasizes his charmingly loose funk and synth-pop arrangements.

Philadelphia,"Shabason, Krgovich & Harris",by: Stuart Berman,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5fa31b76eb2deab0b3f630b0/1:1/w_160/Philadelphia_SbanasonKrgovichHarris.jpg,2020-11-11 06:00:00,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/shabason-krgovich-and-harris-philadelphia/,Idée Fixe,"Joseph Shabason, Nicholas Krgovich, and Chris Harris’ Philadelphia owes less to the American metropolis than to a song about it. To complement the ethereal soft rock they recorded together over three days in Toronto last fall, the Canadian trio opted to cover Neil Young’s 1993 hymn “Philadelphia,” which originally appeared on the soundtrack for Jonathan Demme’s namesake AIDS-themed drama, but was largely overshadowed by Bruce Springsteen’s Grammy-winning “Streets of Philadelphia” single from the same film. The song is a classic Neil alone-at-the-microphone tearjerker, a private prayer for the City of Brotherly Love to live up to its nickname during a moment of weakness and loneliness. That plea for community struck a deep chord with the trio, who decided to make their “Philadelphia” cover the title track on a record rooted in familial bonhomie and mutual support. In one sense, Shabason, Krgovich & Harris’ Philadelphia is a faded snapshot of a pre-COVID world. But if the project’s origin story seems blissfully removed from the world of political tumult, pandemic anxiety, and endless doomscrolling that we inhabit today, the record is also uncannily timely; you’d be hard-pressed to find an album that more vividly conjures the equally disorienting and liberating effects of putting your life on pause. This is the sound of your brain on lockdown: You’re languishing in your apartment for days on end and losing all sense of time and place, yet you’re noticing wondrous new details in things you’ve stared at a million times before, and finding pride and purpose in the most menial of daily routines. Shabason is no stranger to exploring these sorts of Zen states. As a guest saxophonist for Destroyer and the War on Drugs (and prolific composer in his own right), he has helped steer indie rock into smoother waters over the past decade, blurring the lines between adult-contemporary pop and avant-garde experimentation. On Philadelphia, Shabason, Krgovich & Harris arrive at their own singular style of shipwrecked yacht-rock, retaining all the shimmering surfaces but trading any wave-crashing forward motion for free floatation. They let these songs drift wherever they need to go, as the glassy synth tones, wandering piano lines, and fluttering flutes accumulate around the melodies like so much water-logged debris. Like their compatriot Sandro Perri, Shabason, Krgovich & Harris understand the fine art of unhurried busyness, maintaining a calm sense of stasis even as their surroundings change considerably. While Philadelphia is of a piece with Shabason’s past work, it’s somewhat uncharted territory for Vancouver singer/songwriter Krgovich, who over the past two decades has cultivated a reputation as a wry romantic in the Stephin Merritt/Jens Lekman mold. (Harris—who plays guitar, synth, and percussion here—has occasionally served as his sideman over the years, dating back to Krgovich’s late-2000s outfit, No Kids.) Philadelphia provides an especially stark point of contrast to Krgovich’s most recent solo release, “Ouch”, which chronicled a real-life breakup in discomfiting detail. But on Philadelphia, he relishes the opportunity to free himself from traditional verse/chorus/verse songwriting; he also redirects the gaze away from his personal life to the world around him, delivering his lyrics with all the patient poeticism of Bill Callahan returning from a yoga retreat. Over the wind-chime synths of “Osouji,” Krgovich gradually unfurls a song that’s both as mundane and profound as the annual Japanese house-cleaning ritual for which it’s named: “Moving furniture, wiping baseboards, the radio on,” he details; “I’m seeing things that have been here/And considering them.” From there, he talks us through the rest of his day, right up to his pre-bedtime rituals, until he actually drifts off before completing the song’s final verse (“Falling asleep at night, falling ahhhhh…”). It’s a reminder that even the most uneventful days are a gift. But if “Osouji” is a day-in-the-life chronicle, then the epic “I Don’t See the Moon” is pure dreamtime wonderment, harnessing the glacial pace, open space, and jazzy informality of late-period Talk Talk into an eight-minute swoon. Philadelphia abounds with these moments of intense contemplation and quiet rapture, and their celestial, sax-sweetened version of Neil’s namesake track fits snugly into its meditative milieu. But the album finds its clearest philosophical articulation in “Friday Afternoon,” an ambient serenade that’s part ’80s lite-FM ballad, part pedal-steeled Lynchian torch song. Stuck in a traffic jam caused by “a dusty mini-van with the hood flipped up,” Krgovich redirects his attention from this “frazzled moment” to gaze at the “pretty sunset” before introducing the song’s oft-repeated motivational mantra: “Wrap your loving arms around it!” As relaxed as it sounds, Philadelphia is also a useful tool for confronting the drama of modern life. Embracing the world with loving arms might also mean grappling with its chaos, but it’s all a means of better appreciating everything that’s still beautiful about it.","In drifting arrangements for saxophone, keyboards, and contemplative vocals, the trio invents a singular style of shipwrecked yacht rock that’s well suited to the strange pace of 2020.

Pylon Box,Pylon,by: Marc Masters,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5fa033bd4f418af766fd26c4/1:1/w_160/Pylon%20Box_Pylon.jpg,2020-11-10 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/pylon-pylon-box/,New West,"Pylon didn’t really want to be a rock band. When art-school classmates Michael Lachowski and Randy Bewley started banging on cheap instruments in their Athens, Georgia, apartment in the late 1970s, they were more into performance art than music. “We are not musicians, we do not like to ‘jam’ or even practice,” Lachowski wrote to his art professor at the University of Georgia. “We only want to perform—we only care about the product, not the process.” Adding fellow UGA alum Vanessa Briscoe Hay on vocals and drummer Curtis Crowe (their landlord and neighbor, who heard their noise from a floor above), they called themselves Pylon and stuck to their art attack. They had one explicit goal: play a single show in New York, get written up in New York Rocker, and then immediately break up. The first two goals were achieved so quickly that Pylon delayed the final one. But they only lasted five years, releasing just a handful of singles and two albums before dissolving. Pylon Box, a new 4xLP collection of those recordings and previously unreleased material, shows that their influence has survived much longer. In an accompanying book, musicians from all over testify to the example they set, while a biographical essay by Pitchfork contributor Stephen Deusner details the local remifications of their legacy. Though the B-52’s put Athens on the map (their success in NYC made Pylon want to play there), it was Pylon who built the town’s music community, through parties, concerts, and their own still-surviving show space, the 40 Watt. “If the B-52’s proved that good, original, compelling music could be made in Athens,” writes Deusner, “then Pylon proved that the town could sustain a scene.” That wouldn’t have happened if Pylon’s music wasn’t so original. “We’d never learned how to play music,” said Crowe. “That was the secret to whatever success we had—the fact that we never had any idea what we were not supposed to do.” Bewley developed his own guitar language by starting with an alternate tuning, simply because he didn’t know any standard ones. He and Lachowski took turns playing repetitive grooves and unfettered improvisations; as Grace Elizabeth Hale points out in her recent history of Athens, Cool Town, this “gave birth to a remarkable independence between the bass and the guitar parts.” That became a chemical reaction once Crowe added nimble drumming and Briscoe Hay provided yelps, growls, and chants, taking her cues from Yoko Ono and Patti Smith. It all added up to something raw but sharp, minimal but unrestrained, brainy but swinging—a sound that was hard to predict but easy to dance to. Their sound gelled with lightning speed. In the summer of 1979, just months after they began, Pylon got their dreamed-of New York gig—opening for Gang of Four—and a rave in Interview magazine from tastemaker Glenn O’Brien. That fall, they made their first recordings in Lachowski and Bewley’s apartment, taped by local record-store owner Chris Razz. As heard in Pylon Box, on an LP dubbed Razz Tape, this session spills out energy, with complex songs that slam hard and flow with ease. Take “Functionality,” a marvel of clipped angles, racing rhythm, and Briscoe Hay’s sneaky voice darting through criss-crossing lines. As the band whips up an evolving, syncopated loop, it seems they could giddily grind out variations on this jerky groove forever. Razz Tape also includes the first recorded versions of two iconic Pylon songs: the rushing “Cool,” marked by an urgent Briscoe Hay slogan (“Everything is cool!”), and the contorted howler “Dub.” In his review of their NYC show, O’Brien guessed that “these kids eat dub for breakfast.” In reality, the quartet had never even heard of dub, but they were happy to use O’Brien’s claim as material. “I don't know what you're talking about,” snarls Briscoe Hay before chanting, “We eat dub for breakfast!” This kind of pop-art repurposing typified Pylon’s aesthetics, which were more down to earth than ivory towered. Some of the members had jobs at a local factory, where ubiquitous safety cones inspired their band name and a pragmatic work atmosphere spurred their straightforward approach. They called their music “feasible rock,” espoused ideas like “form follows function,” and favored one-word song titles and taut lyrics. Sometimes they took this brutalist minimalism to extremes: One early flyer showed just a picture of the band and the letters “FRI,” barely enough information to indicate their next show was happening on Friday. As Pylon played, wrote, and recorded more, their functional minimalism persisted, keeping their music both accessible and exciting. In many songs, you can hear the building blocks come together as they play, while more complex tunes eventually reveal their sturdy structures with subsequent listens. Pylon’s first full-length album, Gyrate, was recorded in 1980 in three days, and the mix of elementary hooks and dizzying figures remains exhilarating. The third track, “Precaution,” has a clean punk beat but Bewley’s spiraling guitar line immediately turns hectic. The instrumental “Weather Radio” boasts a clucking swing, quickly rushes into a rave-up chorus, then settles back into a mesmerizing stomp. Recorded in a professional studio, Gyrate doesn’t sound primitive, but it sticks pretty closely to what you might hear at a sweaty, dance-filled Pylon show. Three years later, after a few singles—compiled here on an LP called Extra—Pylon sought to use the studio more like a tool, and they ventured to North Carolina to record with Mitch Easter, who had recently produced Chronic Town, the debut EP by Athens comrades R.E.M. On the resulting second album, Chomp, the songs sparkle a bit more as the band mold their shapes to wider sonic dimensions. This helps their energy shine even brighter, from the ESG-style punk/funk of “Yo-Yo” to the shimmering guitars of “No Clocks” to the gothic jangle of “Crazy” (later covered by R.E.M. on their outtakes collection Dead Letter Office). Not long after Chomp came out in 1983, Pylon were offered gigs with an up-and-coming band called U2. Dreading the drudgery of a long tour, they broke up instead. “I never planned on being a musician,” said Briscoe Hay in the 1987 documentary Athens GA Inside/Out, “so it’s not like any big loss in my life that I’m not in a band anymore.” A few short reunions came later; Bewley passed away in 2009. But Pylon’s legacy survives, through musician namechecks, archival releases (their final 1983 show came out a few years ago as Pylon Live), and Briscoe Hay’s semi-tribute act Pylon Reenactment Society. Their lasting influence comes from a simple idea: Anyone can make music—and maybe, in passing, start a scene, or even become a legend. “You don’t need training or authority or legitimacy,” Lachowski said. “Just figure it out.”","A 4xLP box set pays tribute to the influential Athens band, who in the early ’80s pioneered a stripped-down post-punk sound that was raw, minimalist, brainy, and danceable.

Don’t Shy Away,Loma,by: Allison Hussey,"Associate Staff Writer, News",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f972d5feb2deab0b3f62e19/1:1/w_160/DontShyAway_Loma.jpg,2020-11-10 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/loma-dont-shy-away/,Sub Pop,"It can be hard to know when you’re done with a creative pursuit. There are endless ways to fuss over the details of an audio mix, the timing of a film cut, the right choice of word; more broadly, it can be just as challenging to know when to call it quits on a project. A sense of unfinished business—and a particularly flattering compliment—drew Cross Record’s Emily Cross and Dan Duszynski and Shearwater’s Jonathan Meiburg back together as Loma. On their 2018 self-titled debut, the band frayed the edges of indie-rock conventions, balancing stately electronic flourishes within familiar keys-and-guitars structures. The new Don’t Shy Away expands on their capability for total absorption, reaching for a more varied palette of textures and plunging deeper into synthesizers and the human psyche. Some of Loma’s renewed momentum came from the unexpectedly enthusiastic endorsement of Brian Eno, who said in 2018 that he’d been playing Loma’s serpentine “Black Willow” on repeat. At the band’s request, Eno produced and developed synth programming on Don’t Shy Away’s final song, “Homing,” completing the track from stems sent via email. His appearance scans as a footnote, an unobtrusive assist that primarily plays to Loma’s own biome-building strengths. Don’t Shy Away skates between rhythmic, mechanical churn and abstracted instrumental sweeps, framing the naturalistic imagery of the band’s lyrics alongside ambient elements. Bird calls peek through the final minute of “Blue Rainbow” before synthetic buzzes edge them out; the short instrumental piece “Jenny” drifts a rippling guitar part over deep percussion and bonfire crackles before ceding to the slowly restless title track. The whole transmission feels less like a battle of human bravado against the wilderness than an attempt to suss out the boundaries between natural, artificial, and supernatural. Much of the album is shadowed by ominous clouds, blares of horns and low peals of synths that seep across the record like ink into thick paper. “Ocotillo” lurches forward over a foghorn trombone as keys glimmer beneath squalls of brass. From a pulsating beat that presses forth with the insistence of a club track, “Given a Sign” concludes with a wall of synths that underscore its sense of urgency. Don’t Shy Away quickly sounds darker and richer than Loma, and its instrumental obfuscations are as enchanting as they are challenging to unravel. Below these surfaces, however, the band builds out dazzling instrumental environments like dense, dynamic undergrowth. Synths and guitars intertwine, coiling into a labyrinthine backdrop as their edges blur. Moments of lightness arrive in the jittery opening synth swipes of “Elliptical Days,” which transforms into a stately, swooping number that winks at some sort of futuristic forest cotillion. “Breaking Waves Like a Stone” flits with bright melodic dapples, while its bassline (supplied by Wye Oak’s Jenn Wasner) provides a calming counterpoint. Cross’ airy voice is the album’s guiding light, slipping in and out of each song with the unassuming insistence of sunlight leaking through a canopy. By capturing the space between the ache of yearning and the warm glow of memory, “Homing” exemplifies Loma’s talent for bottling convoluted feelings. The intangible potency of Don’t Shy Away comes from its latent sense of spirituality; in “Homing,” it’s a reminder that geographical distance can’t keep someone from being, in a sense, right here. Humane intimacy prevails within Loma’s landscapes, magnified by Cross’ spoken-word narration and bobbing background harmonies. Though it’s phrased in the negative, Don’t Shy Away is an invitation. It honors the sacred space of uncertainty, acknowledging lingering darkness while trusting in the possibility that brighter, more brilliant worlds lie within reach.","The group’s second album skates between rhythmic, mechanical churn and abstracted instrumental sweeps, seeking the boundaries between natural, artificial, and supernatural.

Everything U Need EP,Overmono,by: Chal Ravens,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f982b0be6fc05c7f21c7866/1:1/w_160/EverythingUNeedEP_Overmono.jpg,2020-11-10 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/overmono-everything-u-need-ep/,XL,"Eight months into pandemic-adjusted reality and the netherworld of dance music has reached a critical point. Disco lights are gathering dust. All new techno releases have surely been completed with the present situation in mind: a home-listening scenario which favors melody over repetition, intricacy over seismic subs. On their latest EP, Overmono respond to the new normal by amping up their latent melancholy and luxuriating in a rather British strain of pastoral electronica. Brothers Ed and Tom Russell, also known as Tessela and Truss, have grafted their way into the UK dance A-list with a rave-indebted sound that has one foot in Room 1 (pumping, ecstatic) and the other in Room 2 (disjointed, dicey). Older by 10 years, Tom brings the blood and guts, with a back catalogue of industrial-edged material as Truss, MPIA3, and one half of bug-eyed techno trolls Blacknecks. Kid brother Tessela is the drum machine, able to slice an Amen break 50 ways. You’d think a hybrid of these impulses would be tough as a bouncer’s boot, but their releases as Overmono, mainly for the rave-rooted XL Recordings, are vivid and accessible, keeping ruffneck drums in check with smiley-face signifiers and notes of ’90s euphoria. Everything U Need goes brighter still, highlighting their way with a melody—a skill they may have honed through years of classical instruction at the behest of their orchestra-conductor father. So where Overmono’s earlier records hopped between contradictory moods and sketches, these four tracks unfurl as a continuous suite, more like the first side of an album than a club-targeted EP. Their sharp edges have been sanded down, their shiny bits polished up. It’s bijou enough to bring to mind a record like Boards of Canada’s In a Beautiful Place Out in the Country. Take the soft chimes that interrupt “Clipper (Another 5 Years)”—just the sort of saucer-eyed whimsy you’d associate with the classic Warp duo, along with the faux-mysterious snippets of speech. Similarly, the title track is a bedroom anthem built on itchy minimal drums, a smear of waterlogged pads and a distinctive detuned synth lead: three ingredients that together reboot the kind of tear-stained techno that James Holden and Luke Abbott were perfecting in the late ’00s. With its yin-and-yang combo of creepy-crawly percussion and toy-box melodies, “Clipper” is a dead ringer for early Nathan Fake too, which points us towards an older lineage, a pastoral slant on techno that you can trace back to Aphex Twin—though in his hands, more like folk-horror than a caravan holiday. It’s a sound we haven’t heard much of lately; the mid-’00s revival is gathering pace. The outer edges of the EP point to another ouroboros of influence, as the opening revs of “Aero” mimic Skee Mask’s “Dial 274” before accelerating into the wide-open sky, leaving trancey chemtrails in their path. “Verbosa” completes the record with a further nod to the cloistered breaks of Compro, as a rack of weary-sounding drum machines chatter under warm drones. Skee Mask is behind some of the only essential records of the breaks revival that Tessela and Overmono helped foment, and their shared genealogy can be traced back to the haunted terrain of Burial and, beyond that, Aphex Twin again. In these blue remembered hills are emotions that run deeper than nostalgia: this is where British ravers buried our collective joy and catharsis, allegedly in some forgotten field off the M4. It’s a powerful collective memory which expands to include each new generation of those who weren’t there. Unlike the records it most resembles, Everything U Need is fundamentally straightforward—no strange time signatures here, no bait-and-switch drops, no glitchy stunts. In one sense, that feels like a cop-out given current conditions of prolonged boredom and insular listening. But if we’re doomed to stay in our corona bubbles for a whole winter, any record that revives the MDMA-zing after-party techno-glow of the mid-’00s might as well be labelled “functional.” No one can stop us staying up to watch the sunrise, anyway.","On their latest EP, the UK dance duo amp up their latent melancholy, luxuriating in a rather British strain of pastoral electronica.

Pegasus,Trippie Redd,by: Dylan Green,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5fa02fffeb2deab0b3f6303a/1:1/w_160/pegasus_trippie%20red.jpg,2020-11-10 06:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/trippie-redd-pegasus/,10K ProjectsCaroline,"Trippie Redd still wants us to believe he can do it all. Since the start of his career, the Ohio rapper has embraced a passion for rap of every possible variety. He likes to glide on top of cloud-rap beats, kick rhymes over hard-nosed boom-bap drums, skip over trap hi-hats, and wail and thrash over crunchy emo-rap fusion and booming EDM drops. He doesn’t just wear multiple hats; he stacks them on top of each other like he’s trying to start a TikTok challenge. Trippie’s musical wanderlust sounds great on paper and works decently in short bursts, but in practice, and particularly on his latest album Pegasus, he sounds like a randomly generated playlist: tons of options, very little soul. Trippie has cited Prince as an influence on the album, but many of these songs lack one of the core tenants of the Purple One’s music: personality. Passion isn’t a replacement for voice, and Trippie has burrowed further into the bad habits that plagued his bland 2019 sophomore album !. His musical ambitions are still scattershot, bouncing between different poles of rap from song to song, but he does attempt to branch out lyrically. Pegasus features more love songs than usual, a marked evolution for a rapper who once couldn’t be bothered to chase the feeling on the first “Love Scars” from 2014. It may be a change of pace, but it doesn’t boost his writing, which is as nondescript as a PornHub comment. “Transmission went out/Transitions, my house/New positions to try out,” he belts on “Love Scars 4.” Whether he’s talking about revealing new love (“Let It Out”) or navigating charged emotions (“Mood”), the songs feel anonymous, like any of his immediate peers could’ve written them. The lack of a personal touch follows Trippie across Pegasus’ more amped-up sections as well. When he tries to inject more personality into a song, he often comes out sounding like someone else entirely. His flows and inflections on “The Nether” sound like Wiz Khalifa circa 2012. He channels Roddy Ricch’s nasal tone on the title track and Pi’erre Bourne’s bouncy melodies on “Good Morning.” When he does manage to stand out, his punchlines are jokes that wouldn’t pass muster in a middle-school cafeteria cipher. “Them hollows hit your chinny-chin, I’m like the Crimson Chin,” he growls on the hook for “Kid That Didd,” draining all momentum from the track. Casting such a wide stylistic net yields a few successes across the album. Trippie settles into a nice rhythm on “No Honorable Mention,” outpacing guests Quavo and Lil Mosey with a fast-paced verse about flexing through trauma. The second entry in his “Oomp’s Revenge” series, dedicated to his late brother, provides a steady beat for Trippie to continue eulogizing his fallen soldier. Other highlights across Pegasus come from its many guests. There are scene-stealing features from PARTYNEXTDOOR, Young Thug, and Future. The most bizarre song on the album is “I Got You,” where Trippie swaps verses with Busta Rhymes while interpolating the chorus to Busta and Mariah Carey’s 2003 song “I Know What You Want.” Somehow, it’s also the most effortless collaboration on the entire project. The scope of Pegasus — 26 songs stretched across 74 minutes, not including an extra six songs worth of “Spooky Sounds” — is staggering. It’s double the length of ! while retaining many of the same problems. Trippie would benefit from selecting a few of the several styles he insists on sampling on every project and focusing his energy instead of trying to be all things to all people. Until he’s ready to reel it in, he won’t be fit to claim mastery over any of them.","The Ohio rapper’s new album sounds like a randomly generated playlist: tons of options, very little soul.

LIVE,Angel Bat DawidTha Brothahood,by: Andy Cush,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5fa02e3a3b818af5891ca36d/1:1/w_160/Live_Angel%20Bat%20Dawid%20&%20Tha%20Brothahood.jpg,2020-11-09 06:00:00,Jazz,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/angel-bat-dawid-tha-brothahood-live/,International Anthem,"It first sounds like a straightforward request for the soundman, but soon becomes more like a plea for salvation. “Turn brother Julian up. That bass gotta hit,” urges Angel Bat Dawid early in her new album LIVE, a document of a concert she and her band Tha Brothahood gave during JazzFest Berlin in November 2019. “Turn it up! Turn that shit up!” she continues, her voice quickly reaching the edge of frenzy, as if she is a wanderer in the desert and the prospect of more low end is an oasis on the horizon. Her cries join the rhythmic stream of syllables she’s been using to introduce the tune, a radical reimagining of “Black Family,” from her 2019 debut album The Oracle. “Black, Black,” she repeats, sometimes truncating the word to emphasize its percussive quality, sometimes letting it flow like palilalia, sometimes adding a long rolled “r,” like a rapper imitating the sound of automatic gunfire. When she begins adding “Up, up,”—as in “Turn up the bass,” and maybe also “up with Black families”—her apparent outburst takes on a different color, as another element in a melange that posits togetherness and music as salves for Black pain. You might wonder: was the mix really off, or was the whole episode intentional, somehow a part of the composition? Could both things be true? A clarinetist, vocalist, composer, and keyboardist rooted in Chicago’s jazz scene, Dawid introduced herself on The Oracle as an idiosyncratic auteur. She composed, performed, recorded, and mixed the album almost entirely by herself, layering instruments and voices on a multitracking smartphone app. The Oracle’s hermetic quality was a part of its appeal, but Dawid’s vision was always more communal and participatory. In a 2019 interview with the Chicago Reader, she said she’d originally considered the solo tracks to be something like demos for the Brothahood to learn and perform with her, “But the recordings actually sounded kinda good,” so she released them that way. LIVE is something like a manifestation of that initial vision, using her compositions as vehicles for ecstatic group improvisation, featuring a sundry ensemble of multi-instrumentalists and singers. It features plenty of the bracing instrumental work you might expect from a free jazz album, but also seems intent on capturing the full expressive range of the human voice. Dawid and Brothahood members Deacon Otis Cooke and Viktor Le Givens deliver gorgeous and fractured singing, chilly sci-fi vocoder chants, impassioned monologues, playful free associations. Often, a tune begins with a phrase repeated like a mantra, which they gradually break down and rebuild into dazzling new rhythms, the way an instrumentalist might construct a solo by twisting and reshaping small fragments of the written melody. On “The Wicked Shall Not Prevail,” all three improvise vocals in tandem across a polyrhythmic bed of percussion and electronics, which Dawid occasionally augments with pointillistic clarinet melody and shards of dissonant electric piano. It is an overwhelming display of musical and verbal invention. Across LIVE, Dawid explodes the boundaries of her role as jazz bandleader, turning it into a suggestive and multivalent kind of performance art. She frequently implicates her audience along the way—sometimes as co-conspirators, other times as antagonists. The studio version of “Black Family” is almost mechanistic, with looped drums and throbbing sub-bass; on LIVE, it is lithe and funky, with exuberant soloing over an ominous two-chord vamp. In its stunning final minutes, Dawid entreats her listeners to join her in delivering the refrain: “The Black family is the strongest institution in the world.” The rhythm section gathers force, but the German crowd evidently declines to oblige Dawid. Again, a cliche of live concerts and recordings—the cathartic audience singalong—is suddenly fraught with racial and political implication, conflicts Dawid makes inextricable from the music itself. She shouts, admonishes, demands, preaches, begs, even seems to weep: “It will really help my people. It’s so simple, y’all. Can you just say it with me?” Two minutes later, she sounds drained of all energy as the band churns on behind her: “What’s wrong with me? You don’t love me. You don’t love my family. We need you to affirm us.” At moments like these, Dawid seems to take the unchained improvisation of free jazz as a guide for all aspects of her performance, turning seemingly extraneous details—like stage banter, or instructions for the soundman—into vital components of her art. (One thing LIVE doesn’t capture is the visual element: witness an incendiary early 2020 performance of “Black Family,” captured on video, in which Dawid slams her electric piano keyboard with open palms, gets up and headbangs, and crouches on the floor in front of audience members, clarinet held high in her raised fist.) In her conception of a jazz concert as a vividly multisensory experience, her ensemble’s ragtag instrumental eclecticism, her defiance of stylistic orthodoxies, and her emphasis on the group dynamic over individual solos, Dawid is clearly in the lineage of Sun Ra, as well as the Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians, the seminal out-jazz organization formed in her hometown in the 1960s. (She pays tribute to both with “We Hearby Declare The African Look,” an Afrofuturstic mashup of quotes from Ra and AACM affiliate Phil Cohran; Adam Zanolini, who plays bass and several other instruments in the Brothahood, is the AACM’s current treasurer.) Her multi-instrumental excursions and streams of dialogue with the audience can recall Rashaan Roland Kirk, and her use of her voice as a free improvisational instrument sometimes reminds me of Linda Sharrock. But her particular alchemy of these elements, and her ability to transmute everything that happens onstage into music, are blazingly original. Dawid frames LIVE with two arresting field recordings taken in Berlin before the concert. The intro documents a confrontation between the artist and a hotel employee who’d told her to stop playing a piano that was on display in the lobby. The final track is a collage of remarks Dawid made on a JazzFest panel on the afternoon of the concert, in which she expounds on anti-Black racism in the world of European jazz festivals and more generally. In a note accompanying the album on Bandcamp, Dawid writes of several racist incidents she experienced while in the city, and the pain and exhaustion in her voice in these recordings are viscerally palpable. She has said that she was “protesting” the festival and the audience during the concert, and the music of LIVE is often densely confrontational. But it is also tender, and full of solidarity. A 14-minute rendition of the Oracle highlight “We Are Starzz” accompanies its elegiac melody with sampled birdsong and exploratory leads from Dawid’s clarinet and Xristian Espinoza’s tenor sax. As it winds down, Dawid again addresses the crowd, sounding more conciliatory than she did during “Black Family,” but no less urgent: “Hold on to this memory right now. Seal it in your heart. We have an agreement, alright? This is called unity. This is what it feels like to be unified.” “I’m a black woman—there’s no turning that off,” Dawid told a Guardian interviewer last year. “I look at the totality of the black experience. I don’t see my sister who has a crack addiction for 40 years as not being successful. Because of the lineage she’s coming from, this is the best she can do. When you’re black, being alive is a success.” Dawid’s use of the stage as a pulpit on LIVE makes it difficult by design for a white listener to simply lose themselves in the music, forcing us to confront racism and its effects in every note. To Black listeners, perhaps, Dawid offers another message, embedded in the title, not as a descriptor but an imperative: live.","This revelatory and confrontational live album centers around Angel Bat Dawid’s prowess as a bandleader. With her eclectic band, it is a brilliant document of how free jazz functions as both exploration and exorcism.

Long Hot Summers: The Story of The Style Council,The Style Council,by: Stephen Thomas Erlewine,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f9733e3e6fc05c7f21c77bc/1:1/w_160/LongHotSummersTheStoryOfTheStyleCouncil_TheSTyleCouncil.jpg,2020-11-09 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/the-style-council-long-hot-summers-the-story-of-the-style-council/,Polydor,"Think of the Style Council’s career as the pop equivalent of a semester abroad: Paul Weller embarked on this journey with the explicit intent of broadening his horizons. He had grown tired of the Jam, the trio that he had led since he was 14, ushering them through the frenzied days of punk and leading them to the top of the UK charts. The Gift, the trio’s last album, was sitting at No. 1 when he decided to pull the plug in 1982, believing there was nothing left for them to conquer. He chose to put childish things away and act like an adult for the Style Council. Weller enlisted Mick Talbot, a keyboardist who previously played with Jam disciples the Merton Parkas, as his lieutenant, but it was clear from the outset who was in charge. In the video for 1983’s “Long Hot Summer”—their third single and the song that lends its title to this new anthology—Talbot spends his time rowing a bare-chested Weller to a riverside picnic; later, Tabot would literally carry Weller’s bags in the clip for “Boy Who Cried Wolf.” Absurd as the images may be, there’s an endearing playfulness to the videos that’s telling. Weller scowled through most of the Jam, adopting the look intense young men wear when they’re seriously making serious music. Here, he’s cavorting shirtless, so carefree he’s nearly camp, embracing the hint of sexual ambiguity with the same gusto with which he has a beatnik bongo player join their party. Signifiers were a big deal for the Style Council. The group’s first single, “Speak Like a Child,” shared a title with a 1968 Blue Note LP by Herbie Hancock; they designed the album cover of 1985’s Our Favourite Shop so that it spilled over with the books, fashion, music, and film they cherished most. They swapped punk and mod for jazz and soul as musical touchstones, and the group expanded this obsession through the ’80s, incorporating house and garage to an extent that their record label rejected their final album for veering too far into the dance-music realm. The mysterious, uncredited Cappuccino Kid—widely believed to be Paolo Hewitt, a confidant and biographer of Weller’s until they had a falling out in the 2000s—penned righteous manifestos for the band’s liner notes. They embraced political activism, fighting against prime minister Margaret Thatcher with such enthusiasm it nearly consumed them. Members of the Style Council—Weller and Talbot officially constituted the group’s lineup, but they retained a fairly stable set of players through the years—later blamed the band’s prominent position on the anti-Thatcher Red Wedge tour in 1986 as halting their momentum. But Long Hot Summers: The Story of the Style Council underscores that they were a band born of the moment who lived for the moment, and that moment had passed by the time the ’80s were half finished. Long Hot Summers differs from the many, many Style Council compilations released over the years by being co-compiled by Weller as part of a Style Council reclamation project that also includes a documentary film for Sky Arts (the movie is rumored to be headed Stateside sometime next year). In one sense, assembling a Style Council collection isn’t all that hard, since the high points often occurred on singles. During their peak early years, the band gravitated toward singles and EPs over LPs, so their most vibrant music happened here, while the scattershot later albums usually are well represented by their hits. What happens in the margins of Long Hot Summers makes a difference, though. At two CDs (or two LPs), it has room to cover adventures a single-disc hits collection doesn’t, and it has a concise narrative punch lacking in the thorough 1998 box The Complete Adventures Of The Style Council. The extra space here affords the opportunity to underscore how the band directly tackled big societal and political issues: They wrote a swinging jazz number called “Dropping Bombs on the Whitehouse” and delicately urged that the “Ghosts of Dachau” not be forgotten, a sentiment that may hit harder in the authoritarian climate of 2020 than it did in 1985. Unlike so many of their British post-punk peers, the group also didn’t hesitate to absorb the changes brought by ’80s R&B, adapting elastic synth bass and drum machines for their own ends and gamely covering Joe Smooth’s house classic “Promised Land."" At this generous length, the inherent earnest gangliness of the Style Council is readily apparent. Often, the band came across like they had raided their big brother’s closet, trying on suits that didn’t quite fit their frame. Their funk can be stiff, the jazz drifts toward cocktail hour, and they dive into dance without quite knowing whether they can pull off the new sounds. But all this awkwardness is endearing, not alienating. It’s done in the service of self-edification, for one and for another. Weller really did learn several new tricks during this period. He wound up absorbing the impassioned smooth soul of Curtis Mayfield, a progression evident on “Walls Come Tumbling Down!” and “Shout to the Top!”; he learned how to write with a lyrical lightness, a quality that still makes “Long Hot Summer” and “My Ever-Changing Moods” incandescent. He’d retain this nuance as he headed out on his solo career, but the Style Council stands as its own distinctive thing, the crystallization of a moment when the possibilities pop culture offered to a curious and attentive artist seemed endless.","Collecting both hits and tangents, this double-disc anthology of Paul Weller’s post-Jam project has a concise narrative punch lacking in 1998’s more thorough box set.

the hum of your veiled voice,Jake Muir,by: Esme Bennett,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f97366e6df0d936176b6b5b/1:1/w_160/the%20hum%20of%20your%20veiled%20voice_jake%20muir.jpg,2020-11-09 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/jake-muir-the-hum-of-your-veiled-voice/,sferic,"Jake Muir’s sonic collages, made from vinyl samples and field recordings, pair pristine detail with a shadowy, secretive pulse. His 2018 album Lady’s Mantle was a foray into surf-pop plunderphonics, incorporating aquatic field recordings taken from expeditions in Iceland and California, but the hum of your veiled voice marks a shift in scenery. On his second release on Manchester’s sferic label, home also to experimental and lo-fi ambient from Space Afrika and Perila, Muir’s soundscapes channel the murmurs, whispers, and distant glimmers of the restless city night. They are an ode, he has said, to “gay bathhouses and spas, club back rooms and decadent boudoirs.” Warping and layering his source material into fluid new shapes, Muir suggests fleeting glances and furtive encounters. His warm, fuzzy textures are both nostalgic and sensually inviting; they seem to open up a new space in the subconscious. The melting arcs in “fleeting touches” have a narcotic effect; the music falls in upon itself in droning loops and waves. Subtle hints of jazz piano on “reservoir of memory” are barely audible, yet the washed-out melodies seem to grow louder on a second listen. On “red as the print of a kiss” he marries dubbed-out synths with the sounds of nature, lovingly and carefully extended and manipulated. Muir composed the hypnotic sounds on the hum of your veiled voice after relocating from Los Angeles to Berlin, and the effects of that move are perceptible in his drifting compositions. The fluid character of Muir’s collages emphasizes spatial shifts and transitory states of being; the unidentifiable crackles in “silent sailing” lead past the limits of perception. On Muir’s 2016 debut, Muara, his obsession with environmental found sounds led to a mood similar to the psychedelic forest scenes of GAS’s Pop. But here, his glimmering loops are infused with the decadence of a midnight cityscape. Elusive twinkling textures in “on occasions of this kind” mimic a kaleidoscope of street lights, while distant footsteps signal unidentified waltzes in the restless night. A powerful evocation of an imaginary nonplace, the hum of your veiled voice lies somewhere between the hum of the city and a faint memory, gently slipping beneath the surface of the conscious mind.","The Berlin-based electronic musician collages vinyl samples and field recordings into sensually inviting soundscapes infused with a powerful sense of mystery.

Sam Amidon,Sam Amidon,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f99873f362a0a17e78b805a/1:1/w_160/sam%20amidon_sam%20amidon.jpg,2020-11-09 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/sam-amidon-sam-amidon/,Nonesuch,"“Revival” is a funny term for “mass commercialization,” but that’s just one of the paradoxes of the 20th-century folk music revival. Another is that it minted a production line for new folk songs, which once was an oxymoron. Sure, someone had written the old traditional tunes, but often they had been passed down regional and familial generations for so long that no one remembered who. They existed outside of copyright law, and they were played on acoustic instruments because that’s what people had around. None of this can be said for, say, Peter, Paul and Mary’s “Puff, the Magic Dragon,” but still, we tend to call that one a “folk song,” too. It’s become conventional to brand any lightly dressed acoustic song as folk without regard for the former essence of the term—that it had been shaped by many voices over time. This isn’t to say that mass media automatically taints folk music; it can also just provide a larger vessel through which it can travel. Sam Amidon is living proof. There’s hardly an original to be found on the six LPs—two on Bedroom Community and four on Nonesuch—that make up his main discography, though there are many daringly original arrangements, and The Following Mountain mixed original lyrics in the traditional. Amidon stages a polyglot conversation among folk, classical and jazz, re-dreaming traditional tunes as contemporary conservatory music with minimalist grit. Few artists have drawn as strong a personal statement from the public domain. Amidon reportedly regards his new, self-titled album as the fullest realization of his vision, and indeed, it’s a digestible nine-song omnibus of his modes and moods. Amidon was drawn into the modern classical world of Iceland’s Bedroom Community by Nico Muhly; the icy, crackling ambience of many of the label’s acts and the composer’s lissome orchestrations still influence his work. Regular collaborators such as Shahzad Ismaily and Sam Gendel bathe his guitar and banjo in a high-contrast palette, from flute and saxophone to Moog bass. It can shift as needed from dark coloration (“Spanish Merchant’s Daughter”) to springy rhythms, which peak in a sort of rainforest hoedown on “Cuckoo.” “Cuckoo” emphasizes Amidon’s habit of pulling folk taut to the edge of dance, befitting its origins as social music with a wide range of practical uses. Likewise, “Maggie” begins with a house-music feint that lingers subliminally in the coldly fiery funk that emerges. But these are balanced by moments of piercing simplicity, where the arrangements melt away from the pure pleasure of Amidon’s voice. All its buoyant softness is revealed on “Hallelujah,” a 19th-century shape note song, and “Time Has Made a Change,” a hymn by Harkins Frye that Amidon’s parents sang around the house when he was young. Such personal threads are shot through the album. “Pretty Polly,” an oft-covered English murder ballad that Dock Boggs stamped almost a century ago, appears not because it’s novel, but because it was one of the first trad tunes Amidon learned to play. Perhaps it’s telling that he omits just one aspect of his prior albums: the pop cover, whether it was Mariah Carey’s “Shake It Off” or (gulp) R. Kelly’s “Relief” in 2010. In context, these inclusions suggested that these songs had shaped Amidon as much as Appalachian folk. The closest he comes to a pop cover is a version of Taj Mahal’s “Light Rain Blues.” But he doesn’t need to shoehorn in a modern pop song to underscore that this old music is utterly modern, which is demonstrated most vividly in its cool, commanding vitality—a revival in the truest sense.","Amidon’s self-titled record continues his polyglot blending of folk, classical, and jazz, drawing a resounding personal statement out of songs in the public domain.

"O Brother, Where Art Thou? (Original Soundtrack)",Various Artists,by: Allison Hussey,"Associate Staff Writer, News",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f973e571cc2de8c7d61a997/1:1/w_160/o%20brother%20where%20art%20thou%20ost.jpg,2020-11-08 06:00:00,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/various-artists-o-brother-where-art-thou-original-soundtrack/,Mercury,"In February 2002, as Americans were still recovering from the aftermath of 9/11, the Grammys insisted the show must go on. The contenders for Album of the Year were a varied bunch that included Bob Dylan’s Love and Theft, India.Arie’s Acoustic Soul, and U2’s All That You Can’t Leave Behind. The final two candidates stood as especially intriguing foils, each presenting a unique perspective on life in the American South: OutKast’s celebrated fourth album Stankonia, and the soundtrack to Joel and Ethan Coen’s unexpected hit adventure-comedy, O Brother, Where Art Thou? By the arrival of the new millennium, the Minnesota-born filmmakers had sealed their reputations as high-minded auteurs on the consecutive successes of Fargo and The Big Lebowski. With O Brother, Where Art Thou?, released in December of 2000, they knitted the lurking everyman terror of the former with the absurd and twisting humor of the latter, approximating the arc of Homer’s epic, the Odyssey. The rural Depression-era Mississippi setting of the film was accompanied by a diegetic slate of gospel, bluegrass, pre-war blues, and string-band music, and its soundtrack became an improbable but massive hit, selling more than eight million copies and snagging the Album of the Year. It’s no real surprise that the Recording Academy, never the vanguard of taste or talent, favored an album that spoke to white Americans’ nostalgic follies over one by two Black men from Atlanta daring to turn a critical eye toward the future. But the win was a watershed moment for an album that would define a significant part of the music-industry landscape of the next two decades. Beyond the immediate impact of the soundtrack—minting major careers for some and giving a late-in-life boost to others—O Brother, Where Art Thou? primed a generation for a modern folk revival, establishing a new Americana industrial complex along the way. The Coen brothers took the old saws of folk songs—death, sex, disaster, the highwire act between piety and damnation—and peppered them into their own folkloric adaptation. In press cycles around the film, the Coens spoke about how the music shaped the narrative and the overall tone of the movie. Though the film’s main protagonists are not musicians by trade, music is the backbone of their story and the vehicle for their salvation. And ultimately, the crux of O Brother, Where Art Thou? follows another theme in folk: the homecoming. On the lam from a chain gang and in search of a vast fortune, three men—played by George Clooney, Tim Blake Nelson, and John Turturro—pull a short grift cutting a record at a radio station, accompanied by a Black guitarist they picked up at a rural crossroads. Their recording of the well-worn folk number “Man of Constant Sorrow” explodes as a local hit, but their hand-to-mouth pursuit of a treasure keeps them out of the loop of their much more concrete commercial popularity. The Coens cast Clooney as ringleader Ulysses Everett McGill, a speedy talker and phony barrister who thinks just fast enough to keep leaping from one frying pan into increasingly hotter fires. Dragged along for the ride are Turturro’s Pete and Nelson’s Delmar, alternately cynical and dim-wittedly optimistic fellow cons. The film’s centerpiece is Clooney’s nervy, bug-eyed performance of “Man of Constant Sorrow,” with Turturro and Nelson hamming it up as backup vocalists. The Coens had a mind to let Clooney sing it himself, but they found that unlike his aunt Rosemary, Clooney couldn’t carry a tune. Instead, producer T Bone Burnett called in the ringer Dan Tyminski, a guitarist and vocalist who had established himself as a formidable talent with bluegrass singer Alison Krauss and the all-star group Union Station. Burnett had summoned Krauss, Tyminski, and their Union Station bandmates from the deep pool of bluegrass talent concentrated around Nashville at the time. By the end of the ‘90s, the country charts were dominated by high-gloss stars who packed arenas with heavy pop-crossover appeal: Garth Brooks, Tim McGraw, Shania Twain. But the music of O Brother, Where Art Thou? forewent bombastic pyrotechnics and headset mics. Instead, the Coens wanted to ensure that the film’s music was period appropriate, if not dating back to the Depression itself. They dove headfirst into their own research of folklorists’ field recordings and other long-neglected tunes. Burnett applied his expertise, drawing from his own deep well of historical understanding and recruiting the sharp singer-songwriter Gillian Welch as associate producer. His commitment to authenticity was so great that he arranged ribbon microphones by the Decca tree method of the 1930s and ’40s to more faithfully capture a vintage feeling. The production even hired a forensic musicologist, Sandy Wilbur, to determine whether “traditional” songs like “I’ll Fly Away” and “O Death” were, in fact, traditional (no and yes, respectively). The results of the production’s many pains are, at times, stunning. Krauss takes the lead alongside the First Baptist Church Choir of White House, Tennessee on “Down to the River to Pray,” a gospel hymn that swells in a plea for communion. She joins Welch and Emmylou Harris, ever the nimble and generous collaborator, on the siren song “Didn’t Leave Nobody But the Baby.” Welch and Burnett had expanded the lullaby from a recording of Sidney Lee Carter by folklorist Alan Lomax. It drips with suggestion without once approaching a naughty word, proving how well-aligned vocal harmonies can overpower a song with subtext to knee-knocking ends. The music of O Brother, Where Art Thou? roots the story in reality even as the story romps around in fiction, down to how Black artists fit—and are subsequently diminished—within the narrative. The origin of the story’s crossroads guitarist, Tommy Johnson, mirrors that of the real-life bluesman Robert Johnson, who, apocryphally, sold his soul to the devil in exchange for an inimitable guitar talent. Played by New Orleans blues guitarist Chris Thomas King, Tommy is essential to the crew’s survival: his lead on the radio station rescues them in the short and long term. King’s performance of Skip James’ “Hard Time Killing Floor Blues” is a balm in one of the film’s rare moments of quiet, but the movie otherwise rarely allows him to speak about his own view of the world. Beyond its role as the story’s emotional engine, music is essential to the central fiction in O Brother’s climax. The Soggy Bottom Boys’ schemes collide and come unspooled at a political fundraiser, where a bigoted gubernatorial candidate takes umbrage at the band being “integrated.” Outraged at the disruption to their good time, the townsfolk ride him out on a rail, cheering on the lovable scamps of the interracial ensemble. The film’s biggest improbability isn’t in a brush with a bank robber, a one-eyed Bible-selling Klansman, or a fortuitously timed flood, but in the notion that one good-enough song could move a room full of white people to collectively disavow racism and punish the offending party with passionate haste. The rapid success of the soundtrack led to some career-changing quirks for almost all of its personnel. It created a surprising windfall for James Carter, whom Lomax had recorded singing “Po’ Lazarus” while Carter was imprisoned at the Mississippi State Penitentiary in 1959. The Coens used the recording in O Brother’s opening credits, and as the soundtrack began to boom, Burnett worked with an investigative reporter and Lomax-affiliated licensing personnel to track Carter down and give him the check he’d earned. Carter got a $20,000 lump sum and a trip to the Grammys with his family, who continued to receive the royalties that arrived after his death in late 2003. The soundtrack also turned a spotlight back toward Ralph Stanley, who’d been a preeminent figure in bluegrass with his brother Carter. Ralph Stanley’s unaccompanied vocal performance of the ballad “O Death” scores one of O Brother’s most chilling scenes, and though Carter Stanley died in 1966, Ralph continued performing the song as a setlist centerpiece until his own earthly departure in 2016. Welch, Tyminski, and members of Union Station all enjoyed on-screen cameos, as did members of the Fairfield Four, who sing the haunting “Lonesome Valley” as Everett, Pete, Delmar, and Tommy seem to face certain doom. A concert film released in 2001, Down from the Mountain, helped put names and faces to the soundtrack’s not-quite-celebrity players as well as family-band contributors like the Whites and the Cox Family. All of a sudden, people who thought they didn’t like “folk music” found themselves enjoying it. The old songs pressed on the reminiscences of some of its audience while acting as a new portal to the past for others. Maybe some had heard the tunes in church as children; others perhaps discovered that Deliverance and Hee Haw did not paint a complete picture of the banjo. Aligned with the upper-middle-class appeal of the Coens’ endorsement, the soundtrack wooed listeners who might’ve previously written off the genre as the stuff of uneducated hicks. Regardless, it’s hard to build any argument against the warm encouragement of “Keep on the Sunny Side” or the teetering charm of “Big Rock Candy Mountain.” The songs have stuck around because they’re good. More long-term, the door had opened for a roster of powerhouse modern players. Already a highly respected presence in the bluegrass and country worlds, Krauss earned her laurels as an outright star, returning to work with Burnett on the soundtrack to Cold Mountain and a 2007 album with Robert Plant. She has 27 Grammys, the most held by any woman or singer—Quincy Jones is the only American with more, having 28. Welch released her lodestar Time (The Revelator) in 2001, which reeled with prescient weariness and an empathetic eye for lonely outcasts. Barely out of their teens, Nickel Creek had already proven themselves a prodigious set with their self-titled record in 2000. Krauss produced their next record, 2002’s This Side, which won a Grammy for Best Contemporary Folk Album. The affable trio of siblings Sara and Sean Watkins with Chris Thile made Nickel Creek an appealing crossover among boomers keeping up with the kids, Gen Xers who’d heard about their Pavement cover, and millennials connecting with modern folk idioms on their own terms. The Nashville-based string band Old Crow Medicine Show were also well-primed to ride the wave, having wrapped themselves in an enviable mythology at their outset. Their big break came after the daughter of Doc Watson—the blind grace èminence of Appalachian acoustic guitar whose playing shaped the understanding of the instrument’s melodic capabilities—heard the band busking on a corner in Boone, North Carolina. The group punched up some Bob Dylan scraps into “Wagon Wheel,” which made it to their 2004 self-titled album and became a potent regional favorite for its marriage of barroom bluster and homesick sentimentality. Old Crow had been playing “Wagon Wheel” for a decade by the time Darius Rucker, of South Carolina’s Hootie and the Blowfish, made a No. 1 hit out of it with Lady A (then still operating under their Antebellum auspices) in 2013. Elsewhere in North Carolina, two hot-blooded young men sharing the Avett surname had begun trading their grunge-inspired electric guitar licks for emotive acoustic yawps. They went from a string of raw, searching records (2004’s Mignonette, 2006’s Four Thieves Gone, 2007’s Emotionalism) to working with Rick Rubin by the end of the decade. The Carolina Chocolate Drops coalesced in 2005, arriving as a necessary corrective and testimony to the presence of Black Americans in the history of country, bluegrass, blues, and more. Mumford & Sons, from the other side of the Atlantic, eventually hitched a ride with purported English charm. Since O Brother, the Coens have returned to nearby wells, but none have bottled lightning like O Brother. Inside Llewyn Davis felt like a genealogical successor as it followed a young musician struggling to catch a break in the Greenwich Village folk-revival scene of the early 1960s. Burnett’s soundtrack likewise felt like O Brother’s spiritual offspring, with actor Oscar Isaac singing his own parts alongside old-guard favorites (Bob Dylan, Dave Van Ronk) and members of the younger set who’d been hoisted up by the previous wave (Marcus Mumford and the Punch Brothers—a group led by Chris Thile, by then also a MacArthur “genius” grant winner). Tim Blake Nelson reunited with the Coens as the titular sharpshooter in 2018’s The Ballad of Buster Scruggs opposite a cowboy played by former Old Crow Medicine Show fiddler (and co-founder) Willie Watson. They conclude their vignette singing a duet written by Welch and David Rawlings, which was nominated for a Best Original Song Academy Award. Keeping with Coen tradition, the dynamic emotional heft of O Brother, Where Art Thou? comes from ordinary people going to great lengths and battling unrepentant chaos just to get home. The story’s flawed heroes are good folks messily trying to make a better way for themselves in this life or the next—a spirit underlined with a soundtrack that spoke exclusively to the same sentiments. The film laundered the reputation of “hillbilly music” to more widespread appeal, signaling to the music industry an appetite for twangy tunes packaged with aw-shucks humility. It broadened the platform available to generational talents like Welch, Thile, and plenty of their peers, while inadvertently securing a slot for “Wagon Wheel” on the setlist of countless dive-bar bands across the country. The impact of O Brother, Where Art Thou? coincided with a cultural moment that left millions of Americans reaching for reassurances about their values. The music spoke to ideas of gentle, earnest goodness, which seemed an increasingly difficult comfort to come by. In subsequent years, boundaries between bluegrass, country, alt-country, blues, Southern rock, old-time, and folk music have been dissolved and re-negotiated under the umbrella of “Americana,” which has itself become a convenient marketing label for just about anything else. But fortunately for folk songs, the good ones have a way of enduring because they speak to moments in ways that Mason jar glassware and Anthropologie prairie dresses never could. They tell the truth about the trying weariness, the sorrowful lows, and the preposterous delight of staying alive. Get the Sunday Review in your inbox every weekend.

Made In Lagos,WizKid,by: Joey Akan,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5fa6fce323b17a901fd1ec65/1:1/w_160/Wizkid.jpg,2020-11-07 06:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/wizkid-made-in-lagos/,StarboySony Music InternationalRCA,"It’s been 10 years since WizKid first debuted in Lagos, becoming synonymous with all that is good in Afrobeats. Four years ago, Drake’s “One Dance” introduced the Nigerian pop star internationally, broadening his audience and spotlighting a genre on the verge of becoming a global powerhouse. The 30-year-old singer has picked up the skills to dualize his music, making art with one foot planted firmly at home while the other seeks success in new markets. From making dance records designed to conquer Lagos, he’s expanded into other territories, by leaning heavily on Caribbean influences. It hasn’t been an easy task, and in the time since WizKid gained international recognition, his crossover credentials have been in question back in Africa. His stateside debut, Sounds From the Other Side, struggled to make a dent commercially. His contract with Sony demands that he continues to play for a global audience, making music that would not work connect locally back home. To work around contractual restrictions, he’s paired with producers and DJs, appearing on their records as an invested guest, to start records in the Nigerian market. More complex still is the ever-changing scene in Lagos, where a new guard of musicians including Omah Lay, Fireboy, and Joeboy are expanding the borders of genre and redefining the local sound. WizKid’s legacy is secure, but in 2020, he’s a king under threat of deposition. Made in Lagos dispels those doubts over 14 tracks. Here, he’s finally balanced the formula to unite home and abroad with big pop songs that can compete across cultures and an underlying theme that embraces his roots. The project is dedicated to Lagos, Nigeria’s bubbling creative hub, historically the beating heart of Africa’s art community. It’s home for WizKid, the place where he was born, raised, and first accepted. It isn’t his first love letter to his hometown: His previous ode to the city’s popular Ojuelegba neighborhood brought Drake into his life and launched his crossover campaign. He continues to embrace his people in art and in action: As young Nigerians around the world participated in the recent #EndSARS protests against police brutality, WizKid delayed his album release and joined in, marching alongside fans in London and becoming a vocal advocate on social media. Made in Lagos is narrow in its sonic approach, but for good reason. Where previous projects were outsized cocktails of club bangers and experimental pursuits, WizKid’s measured take on his fourth album betrays refined maturity. His sounds are familiar, his delivery sure. And the sincerity bleeds through the songwriting. “Inna inna inna, I know say dey go pray on my downfall/I’m still a winner winner,” he asserts early on, as horns travel through the winding melodies of “Reckless.” Wizkid’s delivery of patois and pidgin English interpolating with lush saxophone instantly set this apart. He has refined his approach, finding comfort in exploring the intersection of two sound cultures: Lagos exuberance meets Jamaican rhythms. For a project dedicated to the Nigerian city and its country, the core of Made in Lagos highlights the cultural exchange between Africa and the Caribbean. For many generations, the music of Lagos has enjoyed a healthy Island influence. From reggae to dancehall, to soca, local creatives in Lagos chop and mix music along a wide spectrum of Island sound cultures. Lagos might have birthed WizKid, but Kingston provides the inspiration. True cross-cultural explosion happens within the bounce and deep drumming of “Mighty Wine.” You are instantly transported into a late night in a small club in Victoria Island, bodies gyrating from joy. Damian Marley’s gratitude and introspective verse elevate “Blessed” into an anthem fit for those windy sunsets driving through the incessant honking cars of Lagos Island. On the ground, Lagos might be a city of struggle and shadows, but its very heart is aspirational, and to survive its horrors is to be blessed. WizKid captures the feeling of escapism on the hook: “Say tonight man no go stress o/Say tonight, me and my guys we go jam gbedu.” Other collaborators elevate their records, playing on their strengths in a diverse fashion. H.E.R. redirects flowing positivity into romance on fan-favorite, “Smile.” The mid-tempo reggae production attracted local criticism for its cultural detachment and simplicity when it was released in July. A poignant music video might have softened that stance, but within the full project, its familiarity feels like home. Ella Mai’s openness makes for the perfect duet, bringing a slow burn to the R&B standout “Piece of Me.” “Meet me for lobby o, I know nobody can satisfy ya,” WizKid brags. Alternative Nigerian vocalist Tay Iwar’s sunny infusion of tropical fun over lush instrumentals on “True Love” provides a highlight, while rising singer Tems continues her steady ascension with a sultry performance on “Essence.” Despite a pedestrian chorus, Burna Boy still rings in the party on “Ginger” amid rolling drums and exaggerated promises to a lover. Skepta relives his “Bad Energy” success on “Longtime,” and even though the new collaboration drags uncomfortably, a little déjà vu can be excused. Made in Lagos doesn’t pretend to dig deeper than escapism and a bit of symbolism. Love and gratitude drive the affair forward, with rich approaches to its mid-tempo production. With 10 years of African success under his belt, WizKid’s play for increased global reach is transforming his artistry. The beauty and novelty within Made in Lagos is a consequence of that metamorphosis. For African artists pushing for crossover success, a full Afrobeats takeover of the Hot 100 remains the Holy Grail. WizKid’s latest is a fine addition to make that a reality.","The Afrobeats star balances the formula to unite home and abroad with big pop songs that can compete across cultures and an underlying theme that embraces his roots.

Summerteeth (Deluxe Edition),Wilco,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f99aa36f623ef4101139c9d/1:1/w_160/summerteeth%20deluxe_wilco.jpg,2020-11-06 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/wilco-summerteeth-deluxe-edition/,Rhino,"The late ’90s saw a widespread mutiny in the alt-country scene, as several mainstay acts dropped the twang to explore new sounds and styles, but no band went quite as far as Wilco did to shed their association with that movement. On Summerteeth, their third album, they embraced the Beach Boys, the Zombies, the Kinks, and Van Dyke Parks. Not just those sounds, but those ideas: They experimented in multiple studios, building the songs up with timpani and chimes, the ersatz strings of Jay Bennett’s Mellotron, the bleeps of ancient keyboards, even some back-masked vocals. It was another in a series of impressive transformations, after the band had already managed to grow out of alt-country also-ran status with 1996’s Being There. On Summerteeth Jeff Tweedy and Wilco sound jumpier and nervier than they’d ever sounded before, as though they’ve been struck by lightning. There’s a sense of buoyancy and joy in the music, a sense of renewed mission in their engagement with a new set of influences and references—none of which has dimmed in the ensuing two decades. In fact, if Being There pondered the folly of playing in a midlevel rock and roll band, their follow-up is full of love songs to love songs. It’s not too wild a theory to suggest that the “you” Tweedy keeps singing to might actually be the music of the bands who influenced this record. “It’s for you I swoon,” he declares on “I’m Always in Love,” sounding like a man whose favorite song is whichever one is playing at the moment. Music is his shot in the arm. It’s what tells him every little thing’s gonna be alright. It’s the reason you undertake this foolish enterprise. Music is the other woman, the third point in a love triangle, and on some level that’s not even figurative: Tweedy knows he’s sacrificing time with his family—and security and stability and love and direction—to take these songs out on the road and show them off to people. As exuberant as Summerteeth often sounds, it’s a dark and dire album—a missive from a man teetering on the edge of addiction and estrangement. After years on the road, Tweedy was trying to kick painkillers and largely failing, while Bennett was moving in the opposite direction and nurturing a new set of bad habits. That’s all compounded by Tweedy’s alienation from his wife and young sons; he describes a “fragile family tree” on “She’s a Jar” and laments his detachment from those he loves so much. “Watch me floating inches above the people under me.” To convey his disconnection, Tweedy took a new approach to songwriting, schooling himself in the works of experimental writers like Henry Miller and William H. Gass and tinkering with exquisite corpses and cut-and-paste techniques. Summerteeth is somehow both opaque and almost uncomfortably revealing: a tragically fragmented self-portrait. After so many years and so many albums, that defining tension between the joy of music and the misery of the music business has only grown more poignant, perhaps because we’ve seen the committed dad rocker Tweedy has become, we’ve heard the music he’s made with his sons and their friends, and we’ve watched as he has established what you might call a family business. Summerteeth looms ominously in Wilco’s catalog, marking a point where he knows it all could have gone wrong. He now sounds like a man who understands pop music will save his life. That quality makes the bonus material on this drinking-age-anniversary all the more potent. Let’s start with the scratchy demos, which could be Tweedy’s lost ‘90s lo-fi album, as though he was listening to nothing but Sebadoh and One Foot in the Grave. He sounds weirdly compelling in this stark setting, especially considering the direction these songs would take over time. There’s an unexpected loneliness to these songs in this state, as these same lyrics mean very different things without their billowing pop orchestrations. “All I Need” is a cough of a song, its delicate melody nearly ripped apart by his hoarse vocals, and this version of “I’ll Sing It” sounds intensely despairing even before you remember that he re-recorded the demo with his son Spencer Tweedy for 2014’s Sukierae. That makes the small flourishes more affecting, especially on “I’m Always in Love,” when someone—presumably his wife—sings dreamily along with him, perhaps offering comfort or just a reminder that he’s not alone in his musical madness. It’s clear from these rough sketches that Wilco could have taken these songs in any direction—well, any direction but alt-country. The handful of early run-throughs and weird takes are all over the place, gesturing toward the large well of music from which they were drawing. With its breezily shifting keyboard chord and lazy snare tap, the “Slow Rhodes Version” of “Summer Teeth” sounds like ’70s yacht-soul, as Tweedy punctuates his vocals with a few shaky falsetto woo-hoo’s. One alternate take of “Nothing’severgonnastandinmyway (again)” recalls the unabashedly bouncy choruses of Tommy James & the Shondells, while the other sounds like their stab at a ’90s alt-pop radio hit. There’s also a strain of fuzzy punk running throughout these tracks, with the soundcheck recording of “We’re Just Friends” evoking a Midwestern Undertones and the non-album track “Viking Dan” sounding frayed and feral—more like the messy migraine noise rock of A Ghost Is Born than the tidy pop confections of Summerteeth. Wilco sound like yet another completely different band on the live discs, which document a show in Boulder, Colorado, from November 1999. Away from the studio and up on the stage, Wilco are further refracted: sunny and light at one moment, heavy and crunchy at another. There’s an uncomfortable divide between the new songs and the old; Bennett’s Mellotron stands out even more than usual on the Summerteeth tracks, but it’s mostly absent on the older numbers. In fact, Wilco reverts back to familiar form as the show progresses, which is a shame, as it’d be fascinating to hear a song like “Casino Queen” or “Kingpin” dolled up in summer psychedelia. The standouts, oddly enough, might be the handful of tunes from Mermaid Avenue, released the year before. Tweedy did surprisingly well conveying Woody Guthrie’s warm sentimentality and goofy humor, and those virtues are even more pronounced in this setting. Wilco play “Hesitating Beauty” and “Hoodoo Voodoo” like they’re making them up on the spot, and they sound free and casual—refreshingly far from any dark thought. When the crowd applauds a boisterous version of “Passenger Side,” Tweedy remarks, “If I wasn’t so heavily sedated, I would have been really aroused.” He’s going for a laugh, but it’s not even a joke. He makes several drug references, which he apparently intended to be charming, but his disorientation is alarming, especially when they invade the songs. On “Can’t Stand It,” he rewrites the lyrics so that “Our prayers will never be answered again” becomes “I swear, I’ll never eat acid again.” Such moments cast a pallor on an otherwise fine set, although that may be more representative of Wilco at this particular moment than anyone would like to admit. At the same time, it’s refreshing to get such a warts-and-all portrayal of a band hitting their stride even as they trip over their own shoelaces. In that regard, this reissue stays true to the spirit of the album, giving equal time to the delight as well as the despair.","This reissue stays true to the darkness and exuberance that defined the band’s revelatory 1999 album.

May Our Chambers Be Full,Emma Ruth RundleThou,by: Grayson Haver Currin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f9854b7b42652c21f25aea3/1:1/w_160/May%20Our%20Chambers%20Be%20Full_Emma%20Ruth%20Rundle%20&%20Thou.jpg,2020-11-06 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/emma-ruth-rundle-thou-may-our-chambers-be-full/,Sacred Bones,"Thou want to make a new world. Sure, the Louisiana sludge militants sound obliterating—Bryan Funck screeches with anguish, as if a scab were being repeatedly ripped from the surface of the band’s music. But Thou have long hopscotched among labels, collaborators, and split-mates, creating a non-hierarchical network of partners. They do what they want, whether covering Nirvana in quasi-exhaustive fashion or weaving an exhausting web of side-projects. Even their New Orleans hub, Sisters in Christ, feels as much like some communal anarcho-outpost as a record store. In Kentucky, songwriter, painter, and bandleader Emma Ruth Rundle occupies a related role. She works in multiple groups while making her own transfixing chiaroscuro folk-rock, too. Together, Rundle and Thou shape a grand world of their own. On their seven-track collaborative debut, May Our Chambers Be Full, gothic majesty and charred metal curl into moments of unlikely wonder. At their best, these songs pair the power of a rock-radio anthem with the gnarled eccentricity of their respective DIY roots. Chambers suggests a mutual-aid network: Rundle, an evocative singer with a kind of priestly command, supplies Thou with a central melodic ballast. Thou, one of the most dependably mighty bands to emerge from the South this century, add intensity and muscle. Funck’s serrated screams cut across Rundle’s resplendent tone like a hacksaw grinding against a diamond. These bits are enthralling. Rundle and Funck volley verses back and forth, for instance, during “Out of Existence.” She initially gives in to the band’s relentless rush, allowing herself to be swept inside, while he climbs atop it, sneering from above like a gargoyle. But the guitars, interwoven like a cat’s cradle, swell beneath Rundle during the climax. The effect is transcendent, lifting you from your own gloom for 30 seconds, too. On “Magickal Cost,” Rundle rejoins Funck after the black metal tirade at song’s center, the superhero and arch-villain suddenly joining teams and making your hairs stand on end. But Chambers as a whole feels much longer than its 36-minute runtime, even to the point of tedium. Wayward psychedelic blues solos and self-indulgent sections interrupt the momentum. “Into Being” spends two minutes searching for its finale through lysergic guitars or arcing harmonies. Aimless passages like these often make the songs feel like a mélange of moments that lose strength as parts pile on. After “Out of Existence” hits its pinnacle with Rundle, Funck takes another unnecessary verse. You’ve forgotten her blissful sting by song’s end. This fatigue and vertigo stem from the glut of tools at their disposal—and, it seems, their lack of restraint with them. Everyone feels a little like Chekhov’s proverbial gun: If they’re here, they’d better get used. By album’s end, Rundle and Funck build a seesaw of sorts, too often vying for space within the same line or song. They almost crowd KC Stafford out of the otherwise spectacular “Monolith,” a neo-grunge blast that suggests new avenues for Thou. There are four guitars on every song here, reinforcing the sense that everyone must have something significant to say or play. However exhilarating its discrete peaks, May Our Chambers Be Full is one of those common collaborations that’s more notable for what it says about those who made it than for the new material itself. You witness Rundle’s ability to command a formidable band. You sense Thou’s willingness to expose their melodic heart. Most important, though, you hear two acts committed to considering other ways of existing, or to outstripping our expectations not as an act of public evasion but as one of private exploration. Maybe that’s the essence of building a new world—the most inspiring aspect of May Our Chambers Be Full, even at its almighty heights.","On their collaborative debut, the Louisiana sludge band and the Kentucky songwriter funnel gothic majesty and charred metal into moments of unlikely wonder.

The Edge of Everything,Krust,by: Ben Cardew,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f99ab9306efd255af1f073a/1:1/w_160/The%20Edge%20of%20Everything_Krust.jpg,2020-11-06 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/krust-the-edge-of-everything/,Crosstown Rebels,"An astronaut, a filmmaker, and a drum’n’bass producer. It sounds like the setup to a joke, but these unlikely bedfellows were among the base ingredients of The Edge of Everything, the first new album in 14 years from Bristolian jungle/drum’n’bass legend Krust (perhaps best known as a member of Roni Size & Reprazent). As returns go, it is a suitably ostentatious one: Determined to create music that might reach beyond the confines of a Friday night out, Krust spent four years making the album amid a maelstrom of mood boards and meditation, pondering topics from space travel to Damian Hirst’s diamond-encrusted skull. For listeners whose experience of drum’n’bass stretches little further than the industrial sturm und drang of the contemporary dancefloor, this might sound like an unnecessarily convoluted path for a genre that too often sacrifices innovation for sheer sonic oomph. But Krust has long been one of the style’s vanguardists, introducing jazz to jungle on 1994’s dreamy “Jazz Note” and pioneering the industrial-strength bassline stepper in 1997’s “Warhead,” which remains a sacred dancefloor text. Confounding expectations and breaking boundaries are key to Krust’s work. At times The Edge of Everything feels like a massive game of bait and switch that plays merry havoc with our expectations of what drum’n’bass should be. A handful of songs—notably the excellent “Constructive Ambiguity” and “Deep Fields of Liars”—flirt with genre convention, thanks to their accelerated breaks and compulsive sub-bass. But Krust teases the listener with agonising pauses and don’t-look-in-that-cupboard! style dramatic silences, holding back the beat in a relentless orgy of suspense. Other songs, like “Negative Returns” and “Space Oddity” (very much not that one), initially bear the hallmarks of a 170 BPM roller, their charred synth lines barrelling along at a promising clip, only for Krust to upend our expectations with beats that sit closer to the distressed electro of early Autechre than jungle’s classic breaks. Closing with a sampled testament to the transformative power of cinema, the outro to “Negative Returns” highlights one of the album’s key themes. Krust says that he was inspired by filmmakers such as Christopher Nolan and Martin Scorsese, and he created “Antigravity Love,” which follows “Negative Returns,” with help from director Michael Williams, who wrote a rambling monologue for the producer to build a track around. That this underwhelming collaboration adds up to less than the sum of its parts is symptomatic of an album that shoots for the fictive universe of film without quite landing. Krust’s intended narrative arc relies too heavily on the listener’s interpretation of song titles and the spoken-word passages scattered throughout the album’s 11 tracks. But if The Edge of Everything isn’t quite cinema, it’s certainly cinematic, thanks to Krust’s masterful sonic design and a musical palette that nods to everything from 1930s horror flicks (the gothic organ drone on “Hegel Dialectic”) to the THX woosh of “Constructive Ambiguity.” If Michael Bay wasn’t so unimaginative, you could imagine the latter soundtracking a particularly stirring Transformers fight scene, liquid metal beats dancing a electric pasodoble as two robots pound the mechanical hell out of each other under expensively rendered nuclear rain. There is a real elegance to Krust’s musical manipulations, a sort of gentle heaviness that weighs the steely tonnage of heavily processed synth against eerie ambience. And, if you won’t find yourself humming along to the melodies on The Edge of Everything, you will almost certainly discover a favourite sound. (I’ll take the strangled trumpet on “Hegel Dialectic.”) In this masterful precision, The Edge of Everything resembles the radically expansive work of cerebral drum’n’bass producers like Photek and 4Hero while nodding to Detroit techno in its dystopian sci-fi feel. The Edge of Everything arrives at a moment where drum’n’bass is perched between two stools: hugely popular in its own rather inward-looking niche, and being cautiously revived by a new breed of music producers, from MoMA READY to India Jordan, who dabble at the edges of a junglist revival without jumping in headfirst. The Edge of Everything is perhaps too esoteric for either camp—a 5D rendering of the genre rather than a simple homage. But in calling back to concept-driven works like Goldie’s divisive Saturnz Return or the Japanese swordsmanship references of Photek’s Ni - Ten - Ichi - Ryu EP, The Edge of Everything proves that drum’n’bass can still wield an awesome experimental power as it enters its fifth decade.","On his first album in 14 years, the drum’n’bass innovator blurs the edges of the genre, putting masterful sound design and playful pacing in the service of cinematic aims.

Hot Wet & Sassy,TOBACCO,by: Stuart Berman,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f99858736da6b38965c1ccb/1:1/w_160/Hot%20Wet%20&%20Sassy_TOBACCO.jpg,2020-11-06 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/tobacco-hot-wet-and-sassy/,Ghostly,"Since introducing his Tobacco alias in 2008 in the shadow of his more cosmically inclined electro-psych act, Black Moth Super Rainbow, Thomas Fec has been engaged in a prolonged game of, as a track from his debut record put it, “Gross Majick,” reveling in the tension between technical precision and human deviancy. Like his signature melting logo, Tobacco’s synth-funk pastiches are positively dripping with blood, sweat, spit, and other bodily fluids; even when you can’t tell what his corroded voice is saying half the time, his lecherous delivery—sounding like some heavy-breathing prank caller—broadcasts his intentions loud and clear. And on his fifth Tobacco album, Fec doubles down on both the most alluring and unsettling aspects of the project. Hot, Wet, & Sassy arrives four years after the previous Tobacco album, Sweatbox Dynasty, though Fec’s gear settings were seemingly left untouched in the interim. He continues to build tracks from his toolkit of gritty beats, fuzz-slathered synths, and chiming glockenspiel-like refrains that periodically cut through the crud. But if Tobacco’s past records bore the blurry patina of a VHS cassette that’s been languishing for decades in a milkcrate, Hot, Wet, & Sassy is more like a first-gen DVD, bringing a sharper focus to his melodies while rendering his synth grotesqueries in a more horrifying fidelity. And if Fec’s voice sounds as haunted and horny as ever, Hot, Wet, & Sassy ultimately expands Tobacco’s emotional vocabulary from creepy all the way to weepy. The opening “Centaur Skin” serves as the showroom model for the reformulated Tobacco. Though its Moroderized Knight Rider pulse reaffirms Fec’s love for ’80s flash’n’trash, Fec issues his ominous admissions—“I’m a bad friend/I got bad ideas/But always sincere”—with a sympathy-for-the-devil pathos. Throughout Hot, Wet, & Sassy, Fec takes delight in toying with your perception, treating each song as a Rorschach test to diagnose your state of mind: “Headless to Headless” alternates between a chainsawed buzz and Kraftwerkian shimmer on a verse-by-verse basis, until you’re unsure of whether its climactic mantra—“It’s going to feel like shit forever!”—is meant to sound like resignation or celebration. At his most monstrous—like on “Stabbed by a Knight”—Fec lets the song’s teeth-grinding metallic riff play call-and-response with disarming R&B breaks and twinkling keyboard frippery, instantly transforming the album’s scariest song into its most playful. Hot Wet & Sassy is a less intriguing proposition when its enigmatic qualities give way to campy pranksterism and blown-out sonics—like when Fec invites Trent Reznor in for a cameo and renders him as musical mulch to throw into the cauldron. Their collaboration, “Babysitter,” is less a song than a two-minute stutter-funk trailer for some straight-to-video slasher flick, with Fec repeating the line “I’m the new babysitter” as if the flesh was melting off his face, while Reznor hides behind the sort of obfuscating falsetto he’s rarely indulged in since “Heresy.” If anything, Reznor’s presence is more strongly felt on a spiritual level on tracks like “Motherfuckers 64,” which more closely aligns Tobacco’s M.O. with the original Nine Inch Nails mission of making ’80s Depeche Mode sound more demonic. But Fec also spends a great deal of Hot, Wet, & Sassy trying to make his proverbial hate machine look prettier, by exploring how his discomfiting voice adapts to more serene surroundings. Alas, the results can leave him sounding awkwardly exposed: on “ASS-TO-TRUTH” and “Perfect Shadow,” the contrast between Fec’s mutant vocals and the songs’ slow-jam vibes can leave him looking like a guy who shows up for work November 1st still dressed in his Halloween costume. However, on “Jinmenken,” his breathy delivery fogs up the windows on an intimate ballad, turning the ghostly qualities of his voice into an effective complement to lyrics that ruminate over post-breakup absence and unanswered phone calls. And coming out of the ambient interstitial “Poisonous Horses,” the gently glitching “Mythemim” emerges as Hot, Wet, & Sassy’s greatest revelation, the point where Fec keeps his subversive tendencies in check long enough to fully surrender to beauty. Fec inhabits the song as a benevolent apparition, coasting atop its analog synth clusters and pinballing breakbeats into the sunset. But the song’s blur yields the album’s most profound moment of clarity—because even if you can’t make out what Fec is saying, you can certainly see his smile.","On his fifth Tobacco album, Thomas Fec doubles down on both the most alluring and unsettling aspects of the project.

Love Goes,Sam Smith,by: Jackson Howard,Contributor ,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f9734dc362a0a17e78b7f3a/1:1/w_160/love%20goes_sam%20smith.jpg,2020-11-05 06:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/sam-smith-love-goes/,Capitol,"In the music video for their surprisingly vibrant single “How Do You Sleep?” Sam Smith, usually the purveyor of masochistic melodrama and sexless shmaltz, blossoms into someone new. Surrounded by half-naked dancers, the British superstar writhes, snarls, and moves their body with coquettish sensuality. It culminates in a hypnotizing choreography sequence where Smith and their dancers mime sleep while, staring deep into the camera, they slowly rock their hips. It’s uncanny, playful, and sexy. Moments later, Smith lets a smile loose, running their hands over their head in what looks like utter ecstasy. “How Do You Sleep?” was a revelatory moment for a pop star who, save for their breakout song, had relied on a stale combination of mopey piano, campy gospel choir, and self-flagellating heartbreak; it’s a formula that made them famous, but the songs increasingly blended together. The video gave hope that Smith, who came out as nonbinary and changed their pronouns a few months after the single’s release, was proud to embrace their queerness and was finally moving past their typical, buttoned-up schlock. Love Goes, Smith’s third album, unfortunately fails to deliver on the promise of “How Do You Sleep?” The album is clumsily split in two, with no regard to sequencing; it begins with a collection of bubbling, at times electric songs spanning melodic funk, pulsing deep-house, and mid-tempo pop, before abruptly veering to five messy ballads that would be better delivered via Hallmark card. As bonus tracks, if the album wasn’t unbalanced enough, Love Goes tacks on six promotional singles after the ballads, like the hugely successful, Normani-assisted “Dancing with a Stranger,” the theatrical Demi Lovato team-up “I’m Ready,” and the Calvin Harris-produced club hit “Promises.” Replacing these songs, which would have fit well on Love Goes, with boilerplate Smith ballads with titles like “For the Lover That I Lost” and “Breaking Hearts” feels like a calculated, and ultimately ineffectual, attempt to keep the fans of Smith’s earlier records engaged despite Smith’s attempts at exploring new sounds. The result is an unbalanced and frustrating album, one that is at times freer, queerer, and more enlivening than anything Smith’s done before, and yet too cautious to make what could’ve been a career-defining leap. The Smith we meet on Love Goes’s first half is, thankfully, missing much of the self-pity that made In the Lonely Hour and The Thrill of It All so difficult to empathize with (perhaps because Love Goes was based on the disintegration of Smith’s first real relationship, instead of on the heartbreak of unrequited love; their songwriting has improved as a result). Single “Diamonds” is an absolute smash—melodic and morose, but pulsing with resistance and joy, it’s a dancefloor-filling breakup anthem that is actually believable. It’s remarkable how much better Smith sounds over quality pop production; their voice, with its ridiculously elastic range, is an instant gut-punch, a wrecking ball of emotional devastation that conveys feeling all on its own. On “Another One,” a deliciously petty yet disarming message to an ex who moved on, Smith reunites with Disclosure’s Guy Lawrence over pulsing 808 drums and twinkling synths that echo Robyn. The best, cheekiest writing comes on the infectious “So Serious,” which finds Smith acknowledging their addiction to emotional theatrics. “The second that I’m happy and I’m fine,” they sigh, “Suddenly there’s violins and movie scenes and/Crying rivers in the streets and/God I don’t know why, I get so serious sometimes.” “Dance (’Til You Love Someone Else),” also produced by Lawrence, is Smith’s attempt at a ’90s house song. Lawrence and co-producer Two Inch Punch nail the reverberating melodrama of classic heartbreak-on-the-dancefloor epics, while Smith, sidestepping mere imitation, uses the force of the instrumental to howl, wounded and brazen and determined. It’s no “Show Me Love,” but the track nonetheless captures the intangible experience of losing yourself on a sweaty dancefloor at a gay club, where dancing, for a moment, is enough to get over an ex. “Dance” is the final highlight; Love Goes sputters right after. The next four songs all begin with somber piano, as if Smith, and their label, suddenly remembered the commercial tidal wave that was “Stay With Me.” Thankfully, Smith and their collaborators have rid themselves of their uncomfortable reliance on the sound of Black choirs, but the result is just as cringeworthy. Two songs after laughing at their own predisposition for melodrama, Smith laments how “while you were busy breaking hearts/I was busy breaking,” on the nearly unlistenable “Breaking Hearts.” Any hope of artistic evolution implodes on “Love Goes,” an overstuffed collaboration with the British singer/producer Labrinth that is one part Sam Smith karaoke and two parts amateur GarageBand clusterfuck, with competing instrumental layers fighting it out for supreme, headache-inducing dominance. It builds without consequence until a sudden explosion of timpani drums and horns; the BPM accelerates and a faux-hip-hop beat drops, as if Flume drank two bottles of Chenin blanc and tried to produce the rest. Listening to Smith fresh out of high school, it was as if a vortex had swallowed the pain of my coming out, rejection, and self-discovery, and spit it back in my face. Yet its impact dulled with each listen. The loneliness and self-pity of Smith’s music has never evolved beyond generalized mushiness, and as a result fails to truly capture the nuance and complication of adulthood and queerness, heartbreak and redemption. It’s one-size-fits-all musical masochism that, in attempting to touch the masses, really touches no one. It works spectacularly to sell records. But when put up against the stuff of real life, or the wrenching emotional artistry of stars like Adele or Frank Ocean—musicians who construct entire worlds out of their experience and feeling—it quickly disintegrates. For a brief moment last summer, swaying their hips and reaching for the sky, Smith seemed ready to leave the formula behind, to reveal something new about themselves, to maybe, even, show us a way to look at our own pain.

BLP 2020 “King of the Night” EP,dj blackpower,by: Brandon Callender,Contributor ,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f9c644a06efd255af1f08c6/1:1/w_160/dj-blackpower.png,2020-11-05 06:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/dj-blackpower-blp-2020-king-of-the-night-ep/,10k,"MIKE’s music is centered around grief and the healing that comes after. His rich voice, captivating and full of emotion, has become one of his greatest assets as a rapper, keeping you attuned to his even most gut-wrenching songs. BLP 2020 “king of the night” is the first project to be released under his producer alias dj blackpower. In a follow-up to the excellent Weight of the World, the Bronx rapper’s beats grow colder and his lyrics become more heartfelt as he continues to grieve the loss of his mother. It’s no secret that MIKE is a talented producer. Outside of his own projects, he’s supported AKAI SOLO and Mavi with his soulful loops as well. MIKE whittles samples down to only their most essential bits; original songs and speeches are nearly unrecognizable in their new pitch-warped and chopped-up forms. BLP 2020 is entirely self-produced, aside from “Marge Simpson” and “rootin4?,” which feature BSTFRND and keiyaA, respectively, as co-producers. When MIKE’s words begin to press down on you, the beats start to feel heavier. When he asks “All that hoping ain’t ya hands tired/What’s the culprit, is it angst, pride,” on “bad News,” the pitched-down vocal loop and drums crackle beneath his gravelly baritone. With a runtime of 16 minutes, BLP 2020 is one of MIKE’s shortest projects to date, but that’s by design. MIKE’s work is meant to be replayed. You’re rewarded for listening closely and trying to unpack his most complex bars. But nothing stings quite like the times he makes it all too clear. “My armor ain’t fit for mourning, the wind make my face ache,” MIKE defeatedly says on “Piercing thru the Night.” It sounds like he’s choking up, trying to hold back tears. MIKE’s control of tone is remarkable: His groggy delivery on “Marge Simpson” and the clear-headed, even tone of “Mhm!” feels like two completely different rappers. Even when it seems like MIKE’s barely keeping his head above water, he always finds his way back to the surface. “My papa think he know the stress I give him hollow truth/The sorrow beatin’ on your head, you drink the sorrel juice,” he confidently raps over the cheery strings of “Sorrel Juice,” one of the few moments on the EP that approaches an emotional breakthrough. That feeling is abruptly cut short in the transition to “STAY HUNTING,” which represents an immediate return to a bleakness that matches the rest of the project. The EP closes with the somber “haha-haHAAA!,” which shares a sample with “fortune teller,” a loosie from earlier this year. It’s the kind of self-referencing nod only an obsessive fan would catch. Even as the production on BLP 2020 ventures into darker territory, MIKE’s powerful expressions of joy and growth shine bright. In the years since his breakthrough mixtape, May God Bless Your Hustle, MIKE’s songwriting has only gotten tighter, while the world described in his music seems grimmer. BLP 2020 seems like it might only be a short rest stop for MIKE as he works through his most distressing thoughts — it isn’t meant to stand next to a fully fleshed-out project like Tears of Joy. But MIKE shows that he can still find new ways to express his vulnerability as he grows older. There’s nothing in his way anymore.","On his first project under his DJ Blackpower alias, the Bronx rapper’s beats grow colder and his lyrics become more heartfelt as he continues to grieve the loss of his mother.

A Japanese Horror Film,Chester Watson,by: Evan Rytlewski,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f99c118eb2deab0b3f62ed0/1:1/w_160/AJapaneseHorrorFilm_ChesterWatson.jpg,2020-11-05 06:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/chester-watson-a-japanese-horror-film/,POW,"Is Liquid Swords a concept album? It probably isn’t, but part of the mystique of GZA’s defining statement is it feels like it could be one. From the meticulously structured verses to the skits and extensive dialogue excerpts from Shogun Assassin, the entire record works in the service of a dense mythology that’s all the more alluring because it never coalesces into a clean narrative. It’s a masterpiece not of storytelling, but of world-building. Chester Watson’s A Japanese Horror Film is that kind of album, too. The Los Angeles rapper is part of a long lineage of monotone spitters who pride themselves more on their pen than their presence, combining the rap-as-chess intricacy of GZA (whose samurai fascination he also shares) with the absurdist splatter of MF Doom and the philosophical free-associations of R.A.P. Ferreira. Watson credits Earl Sweatshirt for making him start rapping as a teen, and on his earliest releases there was no mistaking that debt, but the two artists’ visions have diverged as they’ve entered their twenties. Where Earl's introspective raps have continued to retreat ever inward, Watson uses his to build something more fantastical and conceptual. He raps like a dorm kid who sees messages on dollar bills. On opener “Life Wrote Itself,” he tells of wisdom handed down from gods and aliens and conveyed by shamans and pyramids, and that’s just a warm-up for the tracks that follow about spirit worlds, inter-dimensional travel, and reincarnation. “Got a lotta grim tales leaking from my stem cells,” he grumbles on “Yokai,” “Catching up on folklore, lying on the cold floor/My only regret in life is that I don’t know more.” While Watson isn’t above stacking syllables just because they sound great together, he also knows when to simplify his rhymes for added punch, which he often does when his bars turn to his frayed mental state. “Remember Biggie telling me something dark in a dream/I get no answer when I’m singing my prayers, they must be outta key,” he intones over the dank, creaky beat of “Fog,” part of a stark final stretch that closes out the record. Like Liquid Swords, A Japanese Horror Film evades a linear reading, and yet it teases the possibility that with enough effort you might unlock a unifying theory that brings an entire story into focus. In spoken stretches between verses, Watson dialogues with celestial voices who inform him of his past lives and grand destiny, like NPCs guiding the hero of a video game. It's an effective, low-commitment framing device, creating an illusion of exposition while leaving Watson’s songs free to chase whatever whims they’d like. Their injections about Atlantis or the ins and outs of astral projection may not pay off narratively, yet they create a sense of momentum anyway. Watson’s lane may be narrow, but it’s crowded; there will never be a shortage of rappers with big vocabularies and blasé deliveries rhyming over bare beats. Yet few have translated that style into a statement album that’s quite as substantial as entertaining as A Japanese Horror Film, a record that’s committed to the fantasy it builds yet tactful enough not to give away too much about it. As a lyricist, Watson understands the importance of specificity. But as a creator, he knows it’s the open ends that keep you coming back.","The introspective St. Louis rapper builds a self-contained world with his magnetic monotone and intricate, evocative raps.

Fading,Pole,by: Jesse Dorris,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f973d1df623ef410113996a/1:1/w_160/fading_pole.jpg,2020-11-05 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/pole-fading/,Mute,"In his shattering memoir Stammered Songbook: A Mother’s Book of Hours, Erwin Mortier charts his family’s struggles to care for his mother (and each other, and themselves) as Alzheimer’s takes her from them. “I can no longer hear the music of her soul,” he writes, “that whole vibrating fabric of symbols with which she wove herself into the world—or conversely, the world into her.” Over the last few years, a number of electronic musicians have tried to hear that music—and begun making it themselves. In 2016, Hannah Peel made a glittering electro-pop album, Awake but Always Dreaming, as a way to cope with her grandmother’s Alzheimer’s. That same year, Leyland James Kirby announced that his long-running ambient project the Caretaker would itself contract (metaphorical) dementia, resulting in a series of harrowing invocations of neurological decline that terminated in the epic decay of 2019’s Everywhere at the End of Time; enduring its six-plus hours has recently become a TikTok fad. According to the World Health Organization, some 10 million people in Europe have dementia. Tragically, one of them was Stefan Betke’s mother. Betke, who as Pole redefined ambient dub for a generation over the course of three classic albums (recently reissued by Mute in an essential box), has followed up 2015’s crisp Wald with an album inspired by his mother’s memory loss, and his loss of her. It is masterfully melancholy, full of extended autumnal sighs like “Erinnerung” (the German word for memory) in which bright melodies stay on the tip of the tongue, never quite congealing into patterns. Fading is also unsettling, and anxious. “Drifting” welcomes listeners with a beatific cloudbank that shadows a landscape of rustles and scrapes; it burns off with pained breath. “Tangente” swings without swagger, the skittering beat as indebted to the click of knitting needles as to boom-bap. You might expect a track named for the glossy, gothy carrion crow would make the heart flutter, and “Nebelkrähe” does, but it’s more arrhythmia than heartbreak, a murder of blasted-out hiss and brittle kicks. Hovering doom. “Töpel” has a lighter touch, replicating the awkward shuffle of the sea birds it takes its name from—but then crashes set in, a reminder that, in German, the word is also slang for a fool. Dementia has a way of tricking everyone in its orbit: It makes the familiar foreign, the habitual impossible, until all must be forgiven for bumbling around as they just do their best. In the dream landscape of “Traum,” Betke builds a tottering structure, with shrill flares in tangles above gurgling bass; to me, it sounds like self-recrimination, but we’ve all got our baggage. There are moments of reprieve: “Röschen” is a bit fiddly, but eventually blooms as spatters of high-end fall upon deep furrows of funk. And closer “Fading” is positively baptismal, with pads like viaducts funneling Betke’s warm dub to wash away the sorrow. Throughout, Betke employs his own version of Mortier’s “vibrating fabric of symbols.” The signature pops of static still crackle; his bass remains vertiginous. Over 20 years spent cutting discs at his scape mastering studio, he’s honed a tonal expertise that allows him to create uncanny dimensions, dropping delays in stereo fields that feel impossibly wide. His foreground sometimes seems to slide under your skin, and the horizon can appear infinite. Reticence does sometimes get the best of him: Fading feints from Hannah Peel’s empathy and refuses to devastate (or stunt) like the Caretaker. Yet it’s full of Betke’s own version of love. If older Pole was a weighted blanket, these are throws to toss and turn under, offering temporary comfort but no escape.","Inspired by his mother’s Alzheimer’s, the German ambient-dub musician crafts a masterfully melancholy lament that takes his signature crackle and pop into unsettling new terrain.

Fires in Heaven,Salem,by: Colin Joyce,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f97313eabd2bebdda47576b/1:1/w_160/fires%20in%20heaven_salem.jpg,2020-11-04 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/salem-fires-in-heaven/,self-released,"When the trio of Midwest malcontents in SALEM released their first EPs over a decade ago, they, like many young people in America, were staring down a dead end. As the critic Larry Fitzmaurice pointed out last year in an essay reflecting on the legacy of chillwave, much of the music that arrived in the early ’10s was implicitly engaged with the turbulence of the era. Still dealing with the hangover of two interminable wars, and with economic prospects decimated by the long wake of the 2008 financial crisis, it was hard for many to feel hopeful. Part of the appeal of SALEM at the time was in how their early EPs and their 2010 album King Night reflected this societal despondency. Largely composed of oozy, unsettling electronic music that burbled in the middle-ground between shoegaze and DJ Screw tapes, their songs were desperate, longing, and lonely. SALEM stared dispassionately into the eyes of a dying world and then, suddenly, they went dark. Over the ten years since King Night, the band has been quiet. They released a companion EP the following year, but since then they’ve only emerged for a handful of remixes and one member’s unexpected production credit on Kanye West’s Yeezus. Now a duo after the departure of founding vocalist Heather Marlatt, principal members Jack Donoghue and John Holland haven’t said much about the timing of their return, but it seems no accident that their second full-length Fires in Heaven arrives as the world is yet again in turmoil, facing down ecological disasters and social unrest, not to mention the economic uncertainty and the global health crisis brought on by the mismanagement of an unprecedented pandemic. Unfortunately, the world hasn’t changed for the better in the last decade, which seems to be the mindset with which that SALEM approach this record. Everything is still pretty depressing, and so is their music. On the morose opening track “Capulets,” they nod to the fact that they’re emotionally in more or less the same place they were ten years ago. Sighing over a twisted sample from the Prokofiev ballet Romeo and Juliet, Donoghue murmurs about the mundanity of existence: “Ask me what i’m doing with my life / Ain’t shit to tell y’all.” It’s the same kind of stretched-out, dejected song they’ve made since their inception. Some of Fires in Heaven takes this mentality to extreme places. “DieWithMe,” for example, is grayscale and gothic, dreaming of the release of the afterlife underneath an instrumental that sounds like an ’80s 4AD release tape at half-speed. The record’s closer “Not Much of a Life” is one of the more hopeful sounding moments, looping a dreamy vocal effect and snowblind synths in a disorienting swirl that feels a little like Slowdive’s electronic experiments. But even that track is gloomy at its heart, its title echoing menacingly like the intrusive internal monologue that greets you on sleepless nights: “It’s not much of a life you’re living.” This sort of bleakness is familiar territory for the duo, but Fires in Heaven shows a newfound clarity in their expression. Mixed by Shlohmo—a fellow traveler in downcast beatwork—and mastered by frequent Kanye collaborator Mike Dean, this record finds SALEM excising a lot of the murk and mire from their previous compositions. They still occasionally bury vocals in a haze of effects, but their instrumentals are crushing now by design, their synth lines starker, the distortion more piercing. They’ve always been capable of expressing harsh feelings, but they seem now more able than ever to echo such sentiments in their music. Fires in Heaven is a more alluring invitation than ever to join them down in the depths.","On their second full-length in a decade, the despondent witch house pioneers return with an alluring invitation to join them in the depths.

Hey Clockface,Elvis Costello,by: Daniel Felsenthal,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f96fc2fe6fc05c7f21c7781/1:1/w_160/HeyClockface_ElvisCostello.jpg,2020-11-04 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/elvis-costello-hey-clockface/,Concord,"Whoever said that rock’n’roll is a young person’s game was waiting to be proven wrong. Few know this better than Elvis Costello. Since he was a twenty-something in black-rimmed glasses, Costello’s talent for arrangement and pastiche pointed toward fruitful twilight years, particularly as he strayed from meat-and-potatoes rock and began to dabble in musical styles less invested in the cult of youth. Now 66, the British icon has only continued to diversify his interests over the decades, collaborating with the Roots and writing for the London Symphony Orchestra. Yet he’s shown himself to be at his best in two modes: making driving, surprisingly ageless rock and exploring the conventions of the American Songbook, as he did on his sublime 1998 Burt Bacharach collaboration, Painted From Memory. Costello’s latest, Hey Clockface, merges these potentially divergent sensibilities in an adventurous set of songs about time’s ceaseless march. Costello no longer sounds quite so ageless. On the Fats Waller-quoting “Hey Clockface / How Can You Face Me,” Costello’s voice strains against gravelly limitations, complementing his elegiac lyricism. Always a wide-ranging writer, he’s managed to preserve his breadth while allowing a sense of mournful retrospection to give the record structure and focus. Affairs are related almost uniformly in the past tense, appearing far enough in the rearview mirror that Costello often substitutes wistful affection for his customary bitterness. Even sex seems more like a memory than a present reality; his “magic powers have drained,” he tells us on one song, quoting a lover who left him. He muses on his reflection throughout, wondering how others bear to look at him: Sure, faces age, but the thought that they might be windows to the soul is frightening in Costello’s world, where everyone’s past is checkered. Musically, the album alternates between loud, sumptuously produced rock’n’roll and softer, Tin Pan Alley-inspired tracks, reflecting two disparate recording sessions. In Helsnki’s Suomenlinnan Studio, Costello played all the instruments, from the Fender Jazzmaster to the Rhythm Ace, buffing his pop-rock songwriting with a maximalist studio sheen that sounds more like St. Vincent than the Imposters. Costello even beatboxes on the curveball “Hetty O’Hara Confidential,” about a once-towering gossip columnist whose work has become outdated in an age when “everyone has a megaphone.” In Paris, Costello linked up with jazz players, including a cellist and a brass section, who improvised much of their performance. The Paris sessions yielded the record’s most powerful songs, such as “They’re Not Laughing at Me Now,” with its poignant flügelhorn trills, and “What Is It That I Need That I Don’t Already Have?,” a masterfully evocative exploration of the 32-bar form. The dueling approaches of the two recording sessions enrich each other, providing Hey Clockface with its yin and yang. Alone, either style might have seemed like predictable genre play for Costello at this stage in its career, but together, they make for an album that’s energetic and consistently surprising. America’s rich musical history and ubiquitous cultural sway have long factored heavily into Costello’s work. Accordingly, to finish Hey Clockface he turned to a group of New York musicians who contributed their parts remotely. Bill Frisell, one of Americana’s great experimenters, layered guitar loops, as did versatile improviser Nels Cline. The present state of the country is all over the record, like a wraith haunting the American Songbook. After the fractured warmth of the Paris-recorded “I Do (Zula’s Song)” we get the sumptuous “We Are All Cowards Now,” its lyrics dipping into the voice of someone who’s scared of a government taking away their guns, while “No Flag” plays like a national anthem entangling nihilism and narrow-mindedness. “No sign for the dark place that I live/No God for the damn that I don’t give,” Costello sings; “We want everything and we don’t want to share/Outer space for the faces we fear.” Hey Clockface’s Tin Pan Alley-bred schmaltz is self-conscious and even gleefully deliberate, yet there are moments when it can be overpowering. The speech that begins “Radio Is Everything” employs a dizzying series of internal rhymes (“screams,” “regimes,” “seems”; “that trivial, sniveling rosary, that ring-a-ding rosemary”) that are distracting in their florid excess. Yet by combining such mannered lyrical tropes with music that sounds alternately nostalgic and dystopian, Costello’s noirish atmospheres suggest another populist American tradition: the pulp mystery. His killer, of course, is time. On an album that has him narrating the decline of so many characters, Costello finally seems aware that the clock has it in for him, too.","Alternating between loud, sumptuously produced rock and softer, Tin Pan Alley-inspired songs, the British singer-songwriter delivers a brooding set of songs about time’s ceaseless march.

Closer Than They Appear,Lyric Jones,by: Dylan Green,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f970997abd2bebdda475769/1:1/w_160/CloserThanTheyAppear_LyricJones.jpg,2020-11-04 06:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/lyric-jones-closer-than-they-appear/,self-released,"California-via-Boston rapper Lyric Jones’ latest album Closer Than They Appear begins with a crisis of conscience. After spending the last eight years honing her skills, she devotes the early moments of her biggest album to date to reflecting on the deaths of Breonna Taylor and Sandra Bland and wondering if her career was worth the blood, sweat, and tears. “Survivor’s guilt cause many ain’t beating the odds/Often faced with ‘That could’ve been me’; fuck the facade,” she says on “Face to Face.” Jones uses her art as a balm to soothe the sting of systemic oppression and finds confidence in her ability to rap anyone under the table. On Appear, her sincerity and musical range are her greatest weapons. In many ways, Jones is a formalist, a craft-first MC and a classically trained musician who’s released music professionally since 2012. Appear feels like a breakthrough, amplifying her rapping and singing voice on a scale several steps beyond her similarly varied 2014 EP Love’s Trail Mix. The album is executive produced by Phonte, a fellow rap/R&B polymath whose experience in groups like Little Brother and The Foreign Exchange undoubtedly helped pinpoint Jones as a kindred spirit. She doesn’t coast on the co-sign. On standout track “Cruisin,” Jones and Little Brother, including Rapper Big Pooh, kick bars while riding their respective state highways—I-405 in California, I-85 in Virginia, and I-95 in North Carolina—and she holds her own over Focus…’s crisp breakbeat: “At times it often takes removing caution tape/To let the right ones cross it safe/And pretty soon I’ll be in awesome shape.” Rap is clearly a healing element for Jones, and her energy reflects the good vibes. She brings just as much energy to rapping without pretense and simply wearing her love for classic hip-hop on her sleeve. “2020 feels heavy, singing D scales/Lyte as a rock, this audio too detailed,” she spits on the Nottz-produced “Rock On,” shouting out Heavy D, MC Lyte, and Audio Two in two easy-to-digest passes. Her bars are battle-tested and referential, hitting with the snap you’d expect from someone who can rap and play drums at the same time. While there are plenty of showcases sure to make backpackers of all ages smile, Appear has more in store than straightforward bar-fests. Jones regularly jumps between rapping and singing in a light and airy voice contrasting with her mid-register rap tone. The beats shift and morph accordingly, taking on elements of flamenco, disco, and the more adventurous side of modern R&B occupied by artists like Kaytranada. Whether flirting with Vic Mensa over H0wdy’s roller-rink-ready beat on “Show You How” or weaving through Phil Beaudreau’s guitar strums on “Angelina,” Jones’ transitions are effortless. She credits Phonte with Appear’s mostly stellar sequencing, which brings cohesion to the project’s various sounds. It shines brightest in the album’s first quarter where the first three full songs all flow seamlessly into one another. The effect works so well it draws attention to the more jagged transitions elsewhere. Opening track “Objects In The Mirror” is a pretty but unnecessary introduction, sapping momentum from the thundering drums on “Face to Face.” The short interlude between “Cruisin’” and “Show You How,” where Jones interrupts her own desires to shoot her shot with a new love interest, feels more like a random voice memo than a fully fleshed-out thought. In an Instagram post celebrating the album’s release, Jones recalls meeting Phonte at Atlanta’s A3C Festival in 2019 after a decade of keeping her dream collaborator on her vision board. “I saw an example of individuality, versatility, and I was so inspired at how Tigallo was RESPECTED in various side music scenes,” she explained. These were all qualities she possessed before meeting her idol, and they’ve been supercharged on Closer Than They Appear. Standing on her largest platform yet, Jones’ dreams are finally within reach.","On her breakthrough project, executive produced by Phonte, the polymath rapper-singer displays her love of classic hip-hop and tries to soothe the sting of survivor’s guilt.

Seven Storey Mountain VI,Nate Wooley,by: Daniel Felsenthal,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f97406341f5fbd885689977/1:1/w_160/TheSevenStoreyMountainVI_NateWooley.jpg,2020-11-04 06:00:00,Jazz,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/nate-wooley-seven-storey-mountain-vi/,Pyroclastic,"On an ordinary Saturday evening, back when ordinary meant large rooms full of strangers, I attended the premiere of Nate Wooley’s Seven Storey Mountain VI in Manhattan. It was November 2019, and perhaps appropriately for the latest entry in a song cycle named after the autobiography of a priest, monk, and philosopher, the venue was a church, St. Peter’s Episcopal in Chelsea. Beneath the vaulted ceiling, the crowd hummed with an energy between the echoey hush of a religious space and the anticipatory buzz of a see-and-be-seen cultural event. The Bibles positioned in each pew looked less like texts of an active parish and more like decorations in a hip, aestheticized club. Ira Kaplan from Yo La Tengo sat a few rows in front of me, I was almost certain. An actual hum began around us, shadowy and doleful. Singers inserted into the audience belted out a choral work from the neighboring benches. “Didn’t they do this when Steve Reich and Arvo Pärt were at The Shed?” I muttered. But the choral music was ideal for the acoustics of a 19th-century cathedral, rising like heat over the Spuyten Duyvil blue stone. Musicians, seated on the pulpit surrounding Wooley’s trumpet like stoics, started to play. Susan Alcorn’s pedal steel accented the vocals. Brushes swirled on a snare drum. The piece that followed was hardly ordinary, and it didn’t aspire to the divine, either. An ecstatic, communal experience in a city seemingly built for them, the debut roused and moved us as our night bled into the wee hours of Sunday. When my partner and I woke at home the next morning, we could still feel the music, even as its immediate sensory imprint faded. Meanwhile, Wooley and an edited version of his ensemble—which, even in slimmed-down form, consists of 14 musicians, among them contemporary downtown fixtures C. Spencer Yeh, Chris Corsano, and Ava Mendoza—headed to Oktaven Audio in the suburb of Mount Vernon and recorded the previous night’s composition in a single day. The result loses the setting of the sanctuary, but none of the polyphonic fullness that the sacred proportions of a cathedral allow. The proximity of the musicians to the show—the way the church must have continued to ripple through them—makes St. Peter’s Chelsea a player on the incantatory Seven Storey Mountain VI. On record, Wooley balances the immediacy of his live set with the clarity of a studio session. The keyboard loops that detail the piece’s woozy middle section are audible underneath crash cymbals. Readings from John Berryman’s 77 Dream Songs mumble below droning violin. Lyrics from “Reclaim the Night,” a 1979 Peggy Seeger song that censures sexual violence, conclude the 45-minute, one-track album. At last year’s opening, the references to Adam and Eve sounded ecclesiastical, but Wooley writes in the album booklet, “Religious dogma holds little interest for me.” Instead, the aesthetics and fellowship of Christianity become a vessel for condemning patriarchy’s treatment of women, one of the many fascinating knots in his composition’s skein. Wooley started the Seven Storey Mountain series in 2007, and each chapter takes the same general shape: Beginning with a spare musical line, the works build into a dissonant freak-out before they flatten again into a gentle melody, drone, or percussion pattern, often mirroring the initial motif. Wooley’s alchemic mix of jazz, minimalism, choral music, indeterminacy, and musique concrète depends on the varied, individual creative processes he implements to guide his musicians: Some read written scores, others follow jazz chord changes, others aleatoric prompts. Stems from previous installments of SSM reappear as time markers and cues. To mesh their playing styles in a single work, the players explore their incompatibilities. Making decisions collectively becomes its own brand of spontaneity, and failure is welcome. “Virtuosity,” Wooley tells us, “is the possibility of total collapse.” He collapses these diverse methodologies into a philosophy that celebrates writing as a kind of artistic cooperative, which he calls “Mutual Aid Music.” If its components aren’t inherently original, Wooley’s blend of sensibilities is. He dashes his Cageian, improvisatory brew with old-school, pre-modern concerns, treating the acoustics of rooms as active participants in a piece’s creation. Previous entries in SSM were recorded live at Manhattan’s Abrons Art Center and Brooklyn’s Issue Project Room—the former a traditional, balconied theater, the latter a marble-floored, cubic hall designed by legendary architectural firm McKim, Mead & White. Each of these albums is powerful, yet they come with all of the sonic diminishment and experiential FOMO that can attenuate a concert recording. VI is the first installment of Seven Storey Mountain to be recorded in a studio. It’s more beautiful than its predecessors, and somehow the most convincing document of the cycle’s in-person grandeur, too. Today, live shows increasingly feel like relics of an old social order, and religious congregations, including St. Peter’s Chelsea, are assembling for services digitally. Yet Seven Storey Mountain VI never alludes to communality as something that exists in the outside world. It expresses communality, with all of its potential for the profound and the spiritual. What we search for in crowds of people is complicated, but at the album’s end, Wooley’s chorus of women tells us, “You can’t scare me,” the strength of their numbers turning a “me” into a “we.” Gathering once gave us courage. Wooley’s latest shows us that, even in the isolation of our homes, the glowing residue of a past togetherness can make us feel more resolute than afraid.","The first installment of the trumpeter’s ecstatic series to be recorded in a studio is its most beautiful, and somehow the most convincing document of the cycle’s in-person grandeur, too.

The image was from a scan, and it showed regions of her mind lit up from the effects of PTSD, the disorder revealed in clear, screenshot-able form. “That’s why her hair’s so big,” she joked, referencing a line from Mean Girls, “it’s full of trauma.” The grace with which Grande has navigated horrors—the ability to name their impact and steer towards healing, to make a top-charting song about a panic attack—has become fundamental to her music.

Positions, her third album in two years, searches for peace. It traces the quiet work of piecing yourself together, the terror of re-learning how to trust. “All them demons help me see shit differently,” she sings 20 seconds into the album, “so don’t be sad for me.” That statement clears the way for some of the record’s goofier moments; it also functions as a kind of thesis. The giddiness that propels the album also heightens its tension. She’s both in love and scared of it, and the frenzy of new romance animates the contrast. “Just give me them babies!” she yelps on “34+35,” a track constructed around an almost-subtle joke until the final seconds. (“That means I’m trying to 69 with you,” she hums. “No shit.”) A slew of slinky sex jams—the title track, “my hair,” “nasty”—drape her harmonies over hazy synths. On “just like magic,” she ticks off her calendar: meetings, meditations, “read a fucking book,” ardent manifesting. The song is both winking and not, a sequel to sweetener’s “successful” that shimmers from behind volleys of drums. But then she sings about writing “love letters to heaven,” and the instruments dissolve. The song quiets for a moment, and the gravity of what she’s said sinks in. Grief sneaks up on you, and on Positions, it’s woven into Grande’s attempt to process love. Musically and spiritually, much of the album builds off of “ghostin,” a delicate, pulsing track from thank u, next about navigating a lost love with a new partner. “Though I wish he were here instead/Don’t want that living in your head,” she sang then, before diving into the mantra-like refrain: “We’ll get through this, we’ll get past this.” On the new record, the hopeful conclusion is less immediate. You hear her wrestling for control, asking instead of answering. The stunning Ty Dolla $ign-assisted “safety net” interrogates and negotiates with fear: “Don’t know if I should fight or fly,” she sings, the physiological language set over constant, murky sighs. “Will I ever love the same way again?” she cries on “off the table,” a syrupy ballad with The Weeknd. “Do I just sit this one out and wait for the next life?” The song blooms over wisps of strings and heavy, heady drums, like an artifact from his Trilogy mixtapes. “I’ll wait for you,” he sings, “Even though it feels like I’ll always be number two to someone you can’t hold anymore.” On “six thirty,” Grande’s silky harmonies glide in over and over to ask, “Are you down? What’s up?”, but the lyrics framing it reveal the weight of the question. “I know this shit kinda heavy,” she murmurs, wondering if her lover’s equipped to support her, and if she’s even ready to ask. Many of these songs stem from hesitancy, from rejecting risks or articulating their costs, and their production is largely sleek and muted. The flourishes live in the transitions between tracks—the Broadway-eque orchestral burst at the end of “shut up,” the burbling synths that close “obvious.” Grande’s voice remains nestled in a breathy sway, occasionally stretching into a rap-adjacent cadence. If these songs lack the sticking power of her stadium power ballads, there’s still dimension to their glazed reveries. (“west side” in particular is an understated, simmering highlight.) In any other year, “motive” might have been written as an internet-breaking banger (Murda Beatz! Doja Cat!), but here it’s twinkling and hushed. Positions suffers a bit from its sanitized precision, the way slippery harmonies wind around trap-drum exoskeletons; you wonder what the title track would sound like if London on da Track’s presence were actually felt, instead of a fun fact for the credits. But maybe this isn’t the place for that. Positions doesn’t broaden Grande’s sound the way her past few albums have, and it isn’t buoyed by a heroic anthem, like “no tears left to cry,” or guided by a specific mission, like how “thank u, next” honored her relationship history. The record resonates partly because it doesn’t weld grand statements out of living with trauma; it narrows in on the wobbly path of pleading with yourself, the begging and bargaining of healing. “I want to trust me the way that you trust me,” Grande belts on “pov,” her voice throbbing and raw. This is the root of every love song on Positions, the ache at the album’s core. It’s the urge to take tangible pain and make something from it, to feel safe—again, at last—in your own head.","Her third album in two years searches for peace, tracing the quiet work of piecing yourself together and delighting in giddy new romance at the same time.

De Chamaquito Siempre Cabezu,Chucky73,by: Isabelia Herrera,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f9c115aeb2deab0b3f62ff9/1:1/w_160/Chuck73.jpg,2020-11-02 06:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/chucky73-de-chamaquito-siempre-cabezu/,Sie7tr3 the LabelCaroline,"Every rap crew needs a cocky ringleader, and Chucky73 gleefully stepped up to the challenge for Sie7etr3. Over two years, the Bronx label and collective has flourished thanks to its Uptown twist on New York drill. The crew racked up YouTube views and Instagram followers, dropped loosies and EPs; meanwhile, Chucky charmed us with his unflappable flow and toothy smile, emerging as the group’s cherub-cheeked playboy. It’s fitting that the first full-length project from Sie7etr3, the just-released De Chamaquito Siempre Cabezu, comes from the collective’s loveable lothario. On his debut album, the New York rapper confronts some familiar challenges for newly crowned regional rap royalty: the pressure to expand an already buzzy profile and reach new fans without abandoning the beloved local style that made him blow up in the first place. Luckily, Chucky mostly avoids that fate. Rather than trend-hopping and watering himself down, he chooses organic collaborations in the broader Latin trap landscape, flaunting his elastic, agile flows and artful delivery over minimal but effective beats. The crew’s penchant for simple, sturdy productions shepherd the album, as does their fondness for onomatopoeic, four-letter track titles. Robust horns on “Fiti (lili part3)” and “Chassy” recall the maximalism that made Dipset New York legends. On “Zili,” Chucky rides the lurching bass and skittish violin hook, dropping playful but hard-edged bars in short, pummeling bursts. Sparse production accumulated in the low end is an ideal setting for Chucky’s songs of triumph; his polysyllabic bars feel muscular, making his presence known with straight-talking tigueraje. Sie7etr3 member Fetti031 and Puerto Rican lyricist Myke Towers also lend vocals to “Zili”; Towers drops a breathless verse that serves as a reprieve from the more melodic fare he typically showcases on mainstream pop-reggaetón records. Throughout the album, Chucky sets the tone for his guests, many of whom are Latin trap or reggaetón artists. Guests like Chilean trapero Pablo Chill-E, Dominican emcee El Pollito Trapper, and reggaetón legend Ñengo Flow are compelled to get on Chucky’s level and actually rap—or admit embarrassing failure, like Jon Z’s sophomoric attempt at a drill flow on “Tutu,” a track that otherwise sounds like an homage to Pop Smoke. It’s a shrewd choice; Chucky invites his guests into his world while reminding them that the bland reggaetón- and trap-lite that currently dominates the Latin pop charts just won’t do here. Tracks like “Dominicana” show off Sie7etr3’s irresistibility; the addictive, clanging beat demands some ass-shaking in the mirror, preferably with a Henny colada in hand. Chucky drops a handful of deadpan, laugh-out-loud couplets that capture the goofiness he’s beloved for, and though the Mr. Freire production almost too closely resembles the synthetic horns and bells on Sie7etr3 EP’s “Brazilera” and “Colombiana,” the track still harnesses the jocular sensibility that makes the Bronx crew stand out from their peers in other boroughs. It’s a reminder of how they’ve resuscitated the Latin trap scene and embraced a sense of vivacity in the otherwise ominous New York drill movement. De Chamaquito Siempre Cabezu has its valleys. Chucky has faced criticism for repetitive flows, which he dismisses with cheeky wordplay on “Palos”; changing up his style would be like telling El Alfa to abandon dembow, or asking notoriously incendiary radio host Alofoke to cut the drama, he says. His laid-back flows are a central part of his magnetism and something he’s not willing to sacrifice so easily. But he does harbor some writing crutches, and when Chucky crafts punchy lyrics, he tends to fall back on them. “Wigi’”s chorus includes a line about packing a 40 in Dora the Explorer’s backpack, but it’s repeated so many times the joke deflates when the song comes to a close. Those seeking respite from all the flexing and sex talk might tap in to “Rosario” or “Desahogo,” but these trap baladas suffer from trite lyrics about the come-up and clichéd voicemail samples from Chucky’s mom. Yet even Chucky’s most uncomplicated songs are made interesting, either through minimal, potent productions or sticky Dominican palabreo–a language of survival that revels in improvisation and orality, always refusing the colonial imposition of proper Spanish. Dominican Spanish has long been dismissed as low-class or too culturally specific; today, white, non-Caribbean Latin American artists frequently don accents or pepper their songs with island slang, cashing in on the cultural and racial currency of Afro-Caribbean speech and performance. Chucky doesn’t have to posture as something he’s not; the songs on De Chamaquito Siempre Cabezu announce his arrival with fearless opacity, and he couldn’t care less whether you understand. He may have traded his low-budget videos for flashy hotels and high-profile collabs with Rich the Kid and Fivio Foreign, but De Chamaquito Siempre Cabezu suggests he’s set on remaining the movement’s irreverent, self-assured torchbearer.","The first full-length project from the Bronx’s Sie7etr3 collective showcases its leader’s elastic flows and artful delivery over minimal but effective beats.

E3 AF,Dizzee Rascal,by: Will Pritchard,Contributor ,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f97053a9e9de33e18587cb7/1:1/w_160/E3AF_DizzeeRascal.jpg,2020-11-02 06:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/dizzee-rascal-e3-af/,Dirtee Stank,"Three years ago, Dizzee Rascal announced he was going back to his roots. While he’d been chasing pop hits in L.A. and Miami with will.i.am and Robbie Williams, the sound he’d birthed at the turn of the millennium had found a new elder statesman in Skepta, a crown prince in Stormzy, and a more lucrative benchmark for success. Grime was not only cool, it was charting. Politicians shamelessly cashed in cultural capital with claims that this fine British export was soundtracking their ministerial drives. So Dizzee revived his teenage nickname and came to collect his dues from the scene. The resulting album, 2017’s Raskit, was well timed and had its moments; critics, seduced by its familiarity, lapped it up. But Dizzee, sounding tired and frustrated, was mostly phoning it in: He rose to the Wiley bait, recounted old pirate-radio tales, protested too much. By contrast, E3 AF sounds like Dizzee making the album he wants to make, rather than the one he thinks people want to hear. The album’s name nods to Dizzee’s status as a born-and-raised Londoner and grime original (E3 being the east London postcode that both he and grime grew up in), as well as his Ghanaian and Nigerian heritage—“Aff” is an archaic slur that Dizzee has reclaimed, proudly referring to himself as the “E3 African.” And while the acronymic “as fuck” of the title will no doubt stir a well-worn row—that he’s far from “E3 as fuck” and more like “far from E3” most of the time—it’s not one that Dizzee entertains here. Recorded entirely in London over the last three years, the album is grounded in the capital’s rich Black musical history. “God Knows” is Dizzee at his abrasive, urgent best: a rattle of jungle snares, skittish drill hats, ten-ton kicks, and rudeboy basslines. He spars on the track with P Money­—a bullish South London MC defined by his steadfast dedication to the grime sound—and distances himself from his more persistent critics with bars like “Trying hard but you ain’t maintaining/Everybody, bar you, that you’re blaming.” As if buffing his credentials, he continues to trade verses with grime Hall of Famers throughout the album: A first studio-minted collaboration with Kano and Ghetts may have been long overdue, but it immediately sounds crisp on “Eastside”; Boy Better Know member Frisco, steadfast as his unwavering hairline, is yet to deliver a bad verse and continues that run on “That’s Too Much” (with D Double E throwing in a few of his iconic ad-libs for good measure). Brief and assured at 10 tracks, E3 AF is the first time since 2007’s Maths + English that Dizzee has managed to tread the extremes of both his underground and mainstream iterations convincingly on a single album—helped, of course, by the interim injection of grime, garage, and drum’n’bass into the pop canon. He’s able to eschew hit-factory producers for scene insiders, as well as getting back behind the boards himself for a number of tracks. Deekline adds impeccable 2-step swing and euphoric yearning to “You Don’t Know”; proto-grime pioneer Platinum 45 provides “Eastside” with its menacing bassline and whip-snap snares; Splurgeboys employ the kind of throwback sampling that’s catnip to old-school ravers on “Body Loose.” When the veteran grime MC wants to try his hand at UK drill, on “Act Like You Know,” he brings in the Brigade’s MK the Plug and Vader. Within these familiar environs, Dizzee’s performances soar. If he takes a breath on the rapid-fire rap confessional “Energies + Powers,” you wouldn’t know it; his effortless garage flow on “You Don’t Know” adds panache to shallow boasts about bottles, cars, and Instagram clout. The album isn’t without its dull moments. Forced choruses remain a habit that Dizzee finds hard to throw off: “Love Life Live Large” is about as stirring as the “Live Love Laugh” decor that litters the homes of middle England; the nauseating, Chris Martin-esque hook of “Be Incredible”—with its inspiro-quote reel of “The time is now to make it right, and be incredible” (etc. ad nauseam)—does nothing but puncture what might otherwise have been the album’s introspective “Stay Positive” moment. It may have taken him another three years to get there, but Dizzee has finally bedded down at home again, rediscovering himself in the process. E3 AF caps a period in which he’s seen more mainstream success than he could have imagined, all while being harried by a grime scene with abandonment issues. This could be the album that pleases both sides equally—no small feat in such fractious times.","Three years after making an ostensible but half-hearted return to his roots, the grime icon more convincingly reconciles underground instincts with pop ambitions.

America the Beautiful,Kahil El’Zabar,by: Marty Sartini Garner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f9737fe6df0d936176b6b5d/1:1/w_160/America%20the%20Beautiful_Kahil%20El'Zabar.jpg,2020-11-02 06:00:00,Jazz,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/kahil-elzabar-america-the-beautiful/,Spiritmuse,"Russian composer Igor Stravinsky was an American when he rearranged the “Star-Spangled Banner.” He had left Paris in 1939 and was in the process of establishing residency in the U.S. when he decided to put his spin on the national anthem of his new country, where he would end up living for the rest of his life. His 1941 arrangement of the “Star-Spangled Banner”—which landed him in mild trouble with the Boston police—premiered in the early days of World War II. It keeps the melody intact, but he shades it with subtle blue harmonies that tweak the song’s strident sense of empowerment, rounding into a finale that, while still triumphant, is somewhat cracked. America, in Stravinsky’s telling, is weaker than it insists, but it still has the capacity for good. It takes less than 15 seconds with Kahil El’Zabar’s America the Beautiful to understand that he feels the exact same way. The Chicago percussionist, bandleader, and composer came up through the influential Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians, serving as its chairman from 1975 to 1983, and he would go on to play with everyone from Pharoah Sanders and Archie Shepp to Dizzy Gillespie and Cannonball Adderley. America the Beautiful, his second album of 2020—following June’s excellent Spirit Groove—is built around his rearrangement of the hallowed title track. It’s a moving, frequently ebullient album that doesn’t shy away from the terrors of America’s past and present while managing, somewhat incredibly, to find hope in the country’s future. For El’Zabar, “America” begins with the drum. Specifically, the hand-pounded pulse of an African drum that sets the pace for his ensemble, which includes trumpeter Corey Wilkes, cellist Tomeka Reid, and the late baritone saxophonist Hamiet Bluiett, who makes his final recorded appearance here. They set the familiar melody into place, but they immediately saw holes in its bright optimism with uneven, uncomfortable harmonies. The symbolism is obvious, but no less moving for it: the notion of America’s beauty has been wounded, but crucially, it’s still afloat. Like John Coltrane’s quartet expanding the boundaries of Rodgers and Hammerstein’s “My Favorite Things,” the ensemble takes us far away from the song’s founding idea, only to return to it with a refreshed vision. That the melody is muddier and more difficult to make out when the group states it again near the end of the song is only part of the point; one gets the sense that, for El’Zabar, what matters most is that it persists. “America the Beautiful” isn’t the only standard El’Zabar reconstructs. Mongo Santamaria’s “Afro Blue,” here titled “Sketches of an Afro Blue,” is heralded by the string section, who recite the melody as if they’re making a dire announcement. The percussion nearly goes out of sync, wobbling on the edge of phasing out and keeping things from getting too comfortable, while Reid flies all over her cello’s fingerboard, spraying notes and nearly gasping into harmonics. There’s a relentless emotional heaviness to El’Zabar’s composition that’s virtually invisible in the original. Their take on Charles Wright and the Watts 103rd Street Rhythm Band’s canonical “Express Yourself,” however, explodes like a box of compressed sunshine. While Bluiett’s baritone puckers and shouts, Reid and violinist Samuel Williams saw at the rhythm like they’re playing with a string band, connecting a timeless anthem of Black joy to music being made by Black people in this country over a hundred years ago. But El’Zabar’s intermixing of brightness and lamentation is at its best in the original “Freedom March.” An eight-minute showcase for Bluiett, it unwinds slowly, sounding like both halves of a jazz funeral happening at the same time, the dirge and the celebration coexisting in a way that’s coherent, but not easy. Bluiett struts alongside the ensemble as they make their way through the tune, punching out deep runs with a chortle and pinching into a high scream. He’s all over the place: He beckons from an adjacent alleyway, then falls into place and plays alongside his bandmates for a few moments before growing restless and popping back out again. Taken together, it all suggests that the titular freedom means not only the freedom of expression, but the freedom to keep marching, to keep pushing, to find within confusion and anger—and joy and beauty—the raw materials needed to build something new. Which makes the drum that kicks off the album feel even more auspicious. Throughout America the Beautiful’s frenetic explorations, it’s the percussion that keeps the ensemble grounded. El’Zabar, who performs most of it, plays in a way that’s intricate and complex, lacing together a number of interwoven sounds sourced from African music, Latin jazz, and funk. At times it feels like an argument for Black culture as both a consistent force in this country and a rebuke to the chaotic excesses of white supremacy’s most demonstrative displays of power. If we understand the word “politics” to mean the way we organize our mutual action, this is explicitly political music: “Now’s the time for us to collectively invoke a confluence of trust and imagination that will enlighten a future path towards ethical humanity,” El’Zabar writes in the album’s statement of purpose. It seems strange, in the waning months of 2020, to hear someone express hope for our country’s future—to suggest that anything like “ethical humanity” is still possible on a societal level. But then again, Americans have been guiding their country toward the light since the days of its broken birth. Most just weren’t called “American” at the time.","The Chicago percussionist, bandleader, and composer offers a moving, frequently ebullient album that doesn’t shy away from the terrors of America’s past and present while managing, somewhat incredibly, to find hope in the country’s future.

Tigermilk,Belle and Sebastian,by: Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f9725d1b42652c21f25adbd/1:1/w_160/tigermilk_belle%20and%20sebastien.jpg,2020-11-01 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/belle-and-sebastian-tigermilk/,Electric Honey,"In March 2020, when the world went into lockdown, Belle and Sebastian asked fans to share their self-isolation experiences. These responses became the lyrics to an audio-visual piece featuring aerial footage of an empty Glasgow and partly narrated by the Scottish band’s chief songwriter, Stuart Murdoch. The result is understated, serene, and heart-ripping: At one point, a father says goodbye to his high-risk son, who was already hospitalized before the COVID-19 pandemic. “If this is God’s experiment,” recites a friend of the band Alessandra Lupo, who co-narrates, “aren’t the good guys supposed to come through this?” Although a departure in form, the project was a welcome reminder of qualities and themes that have helped define Belle and Sebastian for almost 25 years. From mailing lists, club nights, and a shock victory in an online popularity contest to that viral moment when they forgot their drummer in his pajamas outside a North Dakota Walmart, participatory culture has always been a big part of the band’s story. Their songs are often quiet and serious, their characters full of life yet cast out by a cruel and rapacious human society, their presentation fragile yet unafraid of old-fashioned beauty. The tale of the band’s rise is so unusual that it’s difficult to separate the music from the myth, like a used book you treasure as much for the smell of the paper and the scrawls in the margins as the words on the page. And it starts with Belle and Sebastian’s immaculate oddball of a debut album, 1996’s Tigermilk. One of the most important myths about the group involves Murdoch’s own period of unwanted isolation. The second of three children born to a merchant navy officer and a midwife, Murdoch grew up in a home in coastal Ayr that still had an outhouse; he did well at school, played soccer, and gravitated toward loud rock bands like AC/DC, Thin Lizzy, and Yes. By his third year studying physics at the University of Glasgow, he’d run a marathon, tried amateur boxing, and amassed an alternate musical knowledge of northern Britain’s robust indie guitar-pop legacy while working as a DJ, roadie, and record store employee. Then, in his early 20s, he was diagnosed with myalgic encephalomyelitis, or chronic fatigue syndrome. “It came along and took seven years out of my life,” he told a biographer. Murdoch quit school, stopped working, and moved back in with his parents, bedridden. Severe fatigue, muscle aches, and unrefreshing sleep would trouble him for decades. “It’s never abated,” he told an interviewer in 2018. But while trapped alone with his thoughts, he began dreaming up snippets of melody. “I started writing songs because I had to,” he has said. As Murdoch felt better, he tried and failed to resume university, then stayed in Glasgow, supported by government disability aid. He sang at occasional open mic nights, hoping to follow in the footsteps of his cult heroes, like Lawrence of the ingeniously askew ’80s band Felt. Murdoch also spent a great deal of time on public transportation, observing and imagining the lives of all the “normal” people. Improbably enough, the band and album were born out of two educational programs. One was a Scottish welfare initiative called Beatbox, a course for out-of-work musicians where Murdoch met founding Belle and Sebastian bassist Stuart David—who’d only enrolled to hold onto his unemployment assistance. The other was a music business class at what is now Glasgow Kelvin College, where one of David’s flatmates, Richard Colburn—the drummer who would, years later, spend hours stranded in a parking lot between U.S. gigs—had enrolled. A four-song demo recorded at the Beatbox by Murdoch, David, and others built a steady local buzz and soon caught Colburn’s attention. Every year, the music course at Colburn’s college picked a single to record, release, and promote. In 1996, it was an album: Tigermilk. Except that Belle and Sebastian didn’t exist yet. The band name on the demo tape was Rhode Island, and their lineup was in flux. Along with David and Colburn, Murdoch was soon able to enlist guitarist Stevie Jackson, a seasoned ’60s-style rhythm-and-blues player who periodically hosted a Glasgow open mic night. One of the songs from the Beatbox demo was “Belle and Sebastian”; in late 1995, when Murdoch showed David a short story he’d written about a “boy” named Sebastian teaching guitar to a younger “girl” who was still in school, the band had a new name. At a New Year’s party, when Murdoch met cellist, singer, and songwriter Isobel Campbell—a local university student, “Bel” to her friends—their boozy introduction must’ve felt like stars aligning. With the addition of another younger member, keyboardist Chris Geddes, Belle and Sebastian’s Tigermilk-era roster was complete. The full six-piece played only a couple of shaky live shows before recording. Tigermilk is one-in-a-million in part because of these one-in-a-million circumstances. Tracked in three long days at a proper studio, CaVa Sound, under the expert guidance of in-house engineer Gregor Reid, the album is a vibrant snapshot of a band coming into existence while the tape was rolling. “It was like the first flushes of romance,” Campbell has said. Without even so much as an indie label boss to answer to—Electronic Honey, which originally released Tigermilk, was affiliated with the university course—the album was also an unusual opportunity for Murdoch to realize the musical vision that had been floating through his brain since his years of solitary illness. Inspired by ’60s chamber-pop like the Left Banke, the Zombies, and Love, the sound was lush and loose: Murdoch insisted on recording his acoustic guitar and scratch vocal first, leaving his newbie group to catch up with his racing tempos. Lyrically, Murdoch’s songs were like great short stories, fast-moving and richly detailed, often about school-age characters (a school setting was universally relatable, he argued, and besides, school was the 27-year-old’s last major source of memories before getting sick) and yet there were usually darker currents beneath the superficial lightness. He delivered all of this nonchalantly, in a wispy yet commanding lilt, with rippling melodic runs and soaring choruses: The tunes were as catchy as his meanings were enigmatic. Tigermilk’s first track, “The State I Am In,” can be heard as a salvo of artistic intent that carries across Belle and Sebastian’s entire career. The title suggests an earnest confession, the unaccompanied vocal that opens the song furthers that impression. But as the full band gallops in, the song becomes something else, almost like a Trainspotting-era Glaswegian’s “Like a Rolling Stone,” a statement of self that seeks to encapsulate the human condition. Singing about 1975 and 1995, his brother’s coming-out and his sister’s simultaneous wedding day, Murdoch collapses past and present, fictional and personal—“Riding around city buses as a hobby is sad,” opines the fatigue-hobbled bus-riding hobbyist—from the perspective of a witty raconteur who ricochets around all sides of morality. He’s self-obsessed yet fitfully altruistic, variously rescuing and mistreating his “child bride” and, in quasi-biblical parlance, “crippled friend.” The coup de grâce: All of these tangled tales become grist for a priest who turns his parishioner’s confidences into a trashy novel, also titled The State I Am In. When Murdoch gives himself to God, the Almighty hesitates. It all ends with an “oh yeah,” the way a prayer might with an “amen”; the only higher power worth surrendering to, it seems, is song. The rest of the 10-track, 42-minute album colors in and around the ideas presented in the opening track, like delving into J.D. Salinger’s short stories after reading The Catcher in the Rye. “I Could Be Dreaming” is similarly abundant, as upbeat surf-rock gives way to broader paranoia about workaday life (“They’ve got a knife for every time you take the same train into work”). Before the song is over, the dream Murdoch sings about seems to become a fantasy about murdering a female friend’s abusive lover; he dismisses the violence with the pop fan’s “la la la,” and then Campbell twists the narrative blade with a cleverly selected reading from Rip Van Winkle. The subjects of Murdoch’s songs, usually women, are as complex and compelling as his first-person narrators. “Expectations” follows a lower-income student whose life-size models of the Velvet Underground earn her a schoolyard rep as a weirdo (although in a 2006 NPR interview, Murdoch described her as “someone I would have thought was pretty hip at the time”). Harassed in the lunchroom, she suffers a teacher looking up her skirt, and her mother remembers having little choice but to endure groping at her department store job. The cycle of aggression continues when our heroine finds someone apparently even lower in the social pecking order, Veronica—“a fat girl with a lisp”—who’ll take the heat for her. Despite all of this, there’s a hook so dainty, so optimistic—“You’re on top of the world ag-aih-ehn”—that it hints at a way of transcending the world’s brutality. Similarly, “She’s Losing It,” a meditation on a couple, Lisa and Chelsea, who are haunted by past abuse, has a jaunty chorus that sounds like a Folgers coffee jingle. Delicate finale “Mary Jo,” with tender backing vocals from Campbell, focuses on a lonesome character who always reminds me of Eleanor Rigby—though in how she comes fully alive in her dreams, she could be a stand-in for Murdoch. The book she reads: The State I Am In. It fails to satisfy. By this time, Murdoch was working as a live-in janitor at the Protestant church he had been attending, but the softness of these songs shouldn’t be misread as puritanical. “Drop a pill and then say hello,” Murdoch proposes on “Electronic Renaissance,” a synth-pop reclamation as skin-tingling as the Magnetic Fields’ “Take Ecstasy With Me” a couple of years earlier. “You’re playing with something/You’re playing with yourself,” Murdoch teases over the chugging power-pop of “I Don’t Love Anyone.” He’s always a bit funny, but sometimes he’s funny haha. Tigermilk also leaves room for a bit of self-mythologizing. Murdoch wrote “My Wandering Days Are Over” after meeting Campbell, and the lyrics contain direct references to Campbell’s job serving drinks to tired businessmen at a piano bar, as well as “the story of Sebastian and Belle the singer.” The moment when Murdoch sings, “I said, ‘My one-man band is over/I hit the drum for the final time and I walked away,’” it’s as if Belle and Sebastian becomes no longer his solo project but a true unit. After two days of mixing, all that was left to decide was an album title and artwork. Murdoch settled on a photo he had taken of a then-girlfriend, Joanne Kenney, naked in a bathtub pretending to nurse a stuffed tiger. Claiming inspiration from venerable jazz label Blue Note but more often compared to their melancholic UK poet-laureate predecessors the Smiths, Murdoch presented the image in monochrome, a tradition that, with a few exceptions, has carried across Belle and Sebastian’s discography. With its mix of sensuality and childlike whimsy, the shot could hardly have been more strikingly appropriate, and the title, Tigermilk, naturally followed. Electric Honey manufactured only 1,000 vinyl copies. At Tigermilk’s release party, attendees threw the records like Frisbees. At least one was spotted at a shop the next day. Murdoch continued his job at the church; Campbell’s bartending days weren’t over. The album received just a single review on its initial release, with Scottish arts magazine The List favorably opining, “Let’s hope Belle and Sebastian reach the size of audience they have the potential to seduce.” But the students at the music business course remembered to send the record to BBC DJs John Peel and Mark Radcliffe, who began to champion the group. The mystique of Tigermilk spread when Belle and Sebastian released their masterpiece If You’re Feeling Sinister later in 1996 via London indie Jeepster, with U.S. distribution via now-defunct imprint The Enclave. They dropped three more EPs, including the demo with the original “The State I Am In,” and a third album, The Boy With the Arab Strap, which brought Campbell and Jackson to the fore on vocals for the first time, before Tigermilk finally received its first widespread release, in 1999. By then, copies of the original vinyl were selling for as much as £850; cassette dubs circulated, but few people could’ve heard the album. From the beginning, in January 1996, Murdoch had written in response to an offer from Jeepster of his desire to “draw in my audience, instead of bombasting them.” Because the band was averse to interviews, traditional publicity photos, or touring, it’s appealing to think that fans had to find out about Belle and Sebastian for themselves, through word of mouth, hearing them on the radio, or in my case, downloading “The State I Am In” in my first week of college after hearing a classmate name-check them as her favorite band. No music exists in a vacuum, of course—purposefully mysterious 21st-century acts from Burial to Jungle can attest how a lack of information can sometimes be a media angle in its own right—but Belle and Sebastian left space for the already-formidable songs on Tigermilk to grow into listeners’ lives. When it was made, the album was a pointedly melodic, anti-machismo rejoinder to Britpop’s increasingly lunkheaded swagger and the post-grunge bluster of American alt-rock radio. “There’s no sex in your violence,” Gavin Rossdale grunted on Bush’s “Everything Zen”; “There must be a reason for all the looks we gave/And all the things we never said before,” Murdoch chirps atop a hand-clappy T. Rex stomp on “You’re Just a Baby.” Tigermilk was also a worthy successor to the “oppose all rock’n’roll” ethos of early UK punks Subway Sect, the droll yearning of Glasgow indie pioneers Orange Juice, and the confrontational tenderness of Kurt Cobain’s beloved K Records. By the time of Tigermilk’s 1999 re-release, critics either sneered or swooned accordingly. “Do you want to know how much I hate them? Even their name raises my blood pressure,” a mid-tier Scottish pop singer told The Guardian, amid juvenile complaints about “wussiness.” In those lad-mag, anti-“P.C.” years, it was still acceptable for an otherwise-approving Rolling Stone review to use the disparaging slang term “swish” (Pitchfork’s gonzo original assessment was also positive). These days, Tigermilk’s radicalism may be harder to perceive, but it’s no less essential. In recent decades, as Belle and Sebastian have became reluctant elder statesmen of a twee movement in music and film, the early caricatures of them have also spread—a 2015 review on this website cast them as “the most sensitive band in indie rock, patron saints for daydreaming boys and girls”—but to buy into that overlooks the depth in these songs. As keyboardist Chris Geddes felt forced to complain to the NME as far back as 1997, “We’re human beings, not sensitivity machines.” And while the notion of male un-macho-ness has been hijacked by a basket of deplorables I’d rather not talk about here, you need look no further than the White House to know what type of man is still truly in power in 2020. Tigermilk might not preach revolution; with its low-key insistence on the notion of art as a source of personal epiphany, it feels revolutionary nevertheless. In the 2007 book on If You’re Feeling Sinister, former Pitchfork editor-in-chief Scott Plagenhoef suggested that Belle and Sebastian were the last band of their kind. The iPod age, as he saw it, had encouraged indie acts with more adult-contemporary sheen, and the intimacy of early online fandom had been overtaken by breathlessness and trolling. Never again could artists reveal themselves so slowly and deliberately without the public losing interest. Now, with music streaming like water, the idea of one or two people gathering to listen, attentively, to a full-length by an obscure group just because an acquaintance recommended it seems ever more distant. The social safety nets that allowed Belle and Sebastian to form have been cut, the economic model of record sales upended. But for all the trauma on Tigermilk, what I walk away with is its hopefulness. Technology always changes, and the good old days were seldom really so good. At its best, Tigermilk is proof that pop can foster a community without catering to elitism or attempting to be one-size-fits-all—an off-kilter signpost that “unfashionable, vulnerable music,” as Uncut’s 1999 review put it, can mean “everything” to people who get it, nothing to those who don’t. Side B piano ballad “We Rule the School,” which contemplates the nature of graffiti like Holden Caulfield if he were a character in A Charlie Brown Christmas, contains a lyric seized upon by the band’s fans and adversaries alike: “Do something pretty while you can.” In a vast and indifferent universe, this sounds like as good a gospel as any.

American Beauty / The Angel’s Share,Grateful Dead,by: Andy Cush,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f97232df623ef4101139965/1:1/w_160/american%20beauty_grateful%20dead.jpg,2020-10-31 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/grateful-dead-american-beauty-the-angels-share/,Rhino,"To an outsider, Grateful Dead fandom can look like a religious calling. Consider the hours spent in contemplation of their famously lengthy jams, the lexicon of shibboleths and symbols that are inscrutable to the uninitiated, the seemingly prescribed style of dress, the reluctant messiah figure in Jerry Garcia. Actual religious groups even attached themselves to the endless tours that provided this community with its gathering places. If you attended one of the Dead’s carnivalesque stadium shows in the late 1980s—when hippie nostalgia, spectacle-driven TV news coverage, and a bona fide MTV hit converged to make their crowds much larger than they’d ever been in the hippie era—you might have encountered the Peacemaker bus. Filled with longhaired evangelicals who followed the band in hopes of drawing its listeners into a cultish Christian sect known as the 12 Tribes, the Peacemaker had two floors, a groovy paint job, and a faintly eerie slogan emblazoned on the back: “We know the way, we’ll bring you home.” That line comes from “Ripple,” the sixth song on American Beauty, Grateful Dead’s fifth and greatest studio album. But as Pitchfork contributor Jesse Jarnow notes in Heads, his wonderful history of American psychedelia, the Peacemaker’s motto was a perversion of the original. The musicians of the Dead, as well as Robert Hunter, the eremitic poet who wrote many of their lyrics, were temperamentally averse to dogma of any kind. On “Ripple,” a crystalline acoustic ballad with a hymnlike melody, they don’t profess to have the answers. “You who choose to lead must follow,” Garcia sings in his plainspoken tenor atop a cascading mandolin, then finishes with the line the 12 Tribes appropriated: “If I knew the way, I would take you home.” Were the Dead a religion, this would be one of its core tenets. Devotion and uncertainty are inseparable; no one knows the way, but we can try to get there together. Released in November 1970 and reissued for its 50th anniversary this month, American Beauty is a pure and potent representation of Dead-ness as a philosophical outlook. Earlier in the year, with Workingman’s Dead, the band made an abrupt about-face from the murk and discord of previous albums toward the bluegrass and folk that had captivated Garcia in his early days as a musician, with some Buck Owens and Merle Haggard thrown in for good measure. American Beauty, which came just five months later, uses a similarly earthy palette, but its concerns are quite different. The songs of Workingman’s Dead, filled with archetypal characters of the American West, involve a fair amount of rambling and gambling. American Beauty is more like a guided meditation, or a solitary swim in a cool, clear lake. Bassist Phil Lesh earned a rare songwriting credit for “Box of Rain,” the heartbreaking opener, whose melodies he wrote to sing to his father as he died of prostate cancer. Hunter’s dreamlike titular image might stand for the ephemerality of the present moment, or of life itself. Again, the band goes out of its way to avoid presenting its wisdom as something certain or compulsory: “Just a box of rain/Wind and water/Believe it if you need it/If you don’t, just pass it on.” Hunter conjures similar impossibilities across the album: lights that no eyes can see, tunes that play on harps unstrung, ripples emerging in water without pebbles to cause them. Decades before mindfulness became a corporate buzzword, the Dead were devoted to being here now. According to Garcia, an acid-fried visit to the Watts Towers a few years before the American Beauty sessions informed this approach, albeit in an inverted way. The guitarist was inspired not to toil in solitude for his legacy, like Simon Rodia building his folk-art monuments in southern Los Angeles, but to live in the world as it unfolded. “If you work really hard as an artist, you may be able to build something they can’t tear down, you know, after you’re gone,” he said later. “But hey, what the fuck? I want it here. I want it now, in this lifetime...I also don’t want to be isolated. I don’t want to be an artist suffering in a garrett somewhere, you know what I mean? I want to work with other people.” This commitment to coming together and being present manifested most clearly in the Dead’s live performances, communal explorations of the moment that only survived for posterity because of bootleg tapers, the sect of Deadheads who documented the band’s fleeting magic, like catching rain in a box. But they also show up on American Beauty, in subtler ways. “Friend of the Devil,” a narrative told from the perspective of an outlaw on the run, might have been a straightforward piece of Americana if not for the way the band played it. Joined by bluegrass-jazz mandolin virtuoso David Grisman, they refuse to sit still and simply strum the chords. Instead, each player pursues his own melodic path through the changes, which emerge in crystalline polyphony. Each line wanders freely, but complements the others; none could support Garcia’s lead vocal alone, but their latticework holds him high. Across American Beauty, the band accomplishes such feats without straying from the bounds of country-folk songcraft, encoding their collective interplay within verses and choruses rather than jamming, per se. The album’s simplicity and campfire warmth make it approachable to newcomers even as it embodies the spiritual yearning that turns people into lifelong followers. It is an ideal gateway drug. The reissue comes packaged with a 1971 concert recording, and arrives in tandem with American Beauty: The Angel’s Share, a collection of demos and outtakes that will hardcore fans will lap up, but newcomers to the album should probably ignore. For anyone in between, The Angel’s Share is a useful reminder of the work that goes into sounding so free. Garcia, Lesh, and rhythm guitarist Bob Weir struggle hard with their vocal harmonies in the “Brokedown Palace” demo, an uncomfortably intimate window on their process, which hardly anyone needs to hear more than once. Drummer Bill Kreutzman stumbles over a flashy drum fill to start “‘Til the Morning Comes,” an intro the band abandoned at some point between the demo and the final version. The Angel’s Share comes in an album-length edition with one demo for every song, as well as a 56-track version containing 20 different takes on “Friend of the Devil” alone. For all their emphasis on spontaneity, these songs didn’t actually emerge from thin air. American Beauty contains the final studio performances of keyboardist and singer Ron “Pigpen” McKernan. His bluesy shout and rough-hewn charisma made him the Dead’s de facto frontman in their earliest years, but his role in the band receded in the late ‘60s and early ‘70s, as he grew dissatisfied with their drift toward experimentation and away from the driving rock’n’roll that was his forte. In 1973, months before the Dead started work on American Beauty’s studio followup Wake of the Flood, he died at 27 from complications related to his heavy drinking, leaving his bandmates devastated. The twangy and good-natured “Operator,” his lone lead vocal and songwriting credit on American Beauty, is the album’s outlier, content on Earth without reaching for anything resembling the divine. Though American Beauty is undoubtedly the Dead’s most beloved studio album, by fans and skeptics alike, most of its songs were never major staples of their live sets, making it something like an island in the stream of their larger canon. One exception is “Truckin’,” the album closer, an easygoing ode to the open highway that became an anthem for Deadheads and for freaks and hippies more generally. It can be difficult to apprehend how the Chuck Berry pastiche of “Truckin’”’s verses relates to American Beauty’s zen worldview, until you get to the song’s spacious bridge, which spawned one of those catchphrases so ubiquitous as to seem without origin: Sometimes, the light’s all shining on me
Other times, I can barely see
Lately it occurs to me
What a long, strange trip it’s been In the scheme of things, Grateful Dead were only just getting started in 1970; the trip would get much longer and stranger still, and Pigpen was not the last member they’d lose along the way. The “Truckin’” bridge offers a brief pit stop for reflection on the past, but the point is to keep going, city to city, moment to moment. In concert, “Truckin’” regularly stretched past 10 minutes; on record, it is a modest 5:07. It ends with a fade, a tantalizing glimpse at a jam that might go on forever—six brothers truckin’ down the road together toward home, whichever way that is.","Reissued for its 50th anniversary, American Beauty is undoubtedly the Dead’s most beloved studio album, a pure and potent representation of their style and philosophical outlook.

Maya,John Frusciante,by: Will Pritchard,Contributor ,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f930c42043ba2867b8ec276/1:1/w_160/Maya_John%20Frusciante.jpg,2020-10-31 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/john-frusciante-maya/,Timesig,"On paper, the on-again, off-again, on-again guitarist for the Red Hot Chili Peppers writing a tribute to the UK’s mid-’90s hardcore rave and jungle scenes might seem like an odd proposition, but John Frusciante has plenty of experience in this domain. Along with more than a dozen strummed-and-sung albums under his own name, he’s released electronic music with his Trickfinger alias at a steady clip since debuting the acid-house-inspired project in 2015. In fact, this isn’t even the first electronic album he’s put out this year: An EP and third album as Trickfinger arrived in March and June, respectively. Maya, though, marks the first time he’ll release an instrumental electronic album as John Frusciante. The album arrives via Planet Mu offshoot Timesig, established by breakcore mainstay Venetian Snares—with whom Frusciante made one of his earliest electronic excursions, collaborating as Speed Dealer Moms in 2010. It’s named after and dedicated to Frusciante’s cat, who was until her death a steadfast studio companion. Frusciante gives this intimate dedication as the reason for releasing the record under his own name; however, his own personal affinity for the rave sounds he emulates and extrapolates here surely has had some influence too. He’s said previously that while playing guitar with the Chili Peppers he yearned to be making electronic music. In the early 2000s he would frequent jungle raves in L.A., attempting to get a taste of a scene he felt had passed him by in the ’90s as he was writing multi-platinum funk rock with Keidis and co. This album certainly carries the sweat of those formative nightclub experiences. Where his Trickfinger productions are defined by an almost clinical cleanliness (despite the considerable array of sounds they clump together), he roughs the edges on Maya. The album decays as it progresses, from gently undulating breakbeats and a luxe acid bassline on opener “Brand E” to elastic breakcore on “Zillion” and the disintegrating synths and squall of shattered drum kits of closer “Anja Motherless.” Frusciante’s beloved Roland TB-303—the squelchy synthesizer synonymous with acid house and rave, and a linchpin of those Trickfinger records—plays a supporting role while he throws himself into florid sampling and dramatic exchanges of control and release. “Reach Out” drenches a ’00s R&B staple in a hailstorm of breaks that shift between half-time lulls and double-dropped adrenaline shots. “Amethblowl”—the album’s lead single and a cinematic standout—encapsulates the fractious tension at the heart of the record, drawing out two minutes of glitchy snares and an imposing, repetitive bassline, before a mangled cry for relief sends the whole thing crashing down under a thunderous rolling breakbeat and cavernous bass. Having honed electronic music’s fiddlier, more technical aspects over the past half decade, here Frusciante relishes a new expressive freedom. Melodic flourishes—like the hypnotic scrambled scales of “Usbrup Pensul”, or the playful melee of basslines on “Blind Aim”—give the album an unblemished glee that propels it forward with infectious abandon. Perhaps more importantly, these touches also move Maya beyond the realm of admiring pastiche and into more rewarding territory. The album has all the hallmarks of the era that Frusciante apes, but offers thoughtful, intriguing embellishments at every turn: A sudden retreat from the dancefloor to the chillout room halfway through “Flying”; the mutation of g-funk and sci-fi soundtracks on “Pleasure Explanation.” As tributes go, this is as fine an homage as any feline companion could hope for. The UK’s rose-tinted ravers should be honored too.","The longtime Red Hot Chili Peppers guitarist swaps the acid-house influences of his Trickfinger project for a loving tribute to ’90s jungle and drill’n’bass.

Magic Oneohtrix Point Never,Oneohtrix Point Never,by: Philip Sherburne,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f930b0af623ef4101139838/1:1/w_160/Magic%20Oneohtrix%20Point%20Never_Oneohtrix%20Point%20Never.jpg,2020-10-30 05:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/oneohtrix-point-never-magic-oneohtrix-point-never/,Warp,"Like any handover of power, a radio-station format change—from country to classic rock, say, or Top 40 to oldies—follows a loose script. A farewell from the outgoing station manager, a second or two of dead air, and then the benediction from the victorious new regime. No wax seals memorialize these fleeting events; no toppled statues litter the ground. But they are charged moments nonetheless, admissions of failure and also statements of continuity: The king is dead, long live the king. Brief snippets of such format flips are threaded throughout Magic Oneohtrix Point Never, Daniel Lopatin’s first album since his Uncut Gems soundtrack. Gathered from an online archive, they’ve been manipulated and sequenced to sound like a kind of cartoonish Greek chorus. These “eulogies,” as he has called them—for outmoded styles, written-off market segments, abandoned listeners—are nonetheless, in the manner of commercial radio, relentlessly upbeat; they seem to proclaim that American lives are nothing but second acts, perpetually being erased and reset. “Somehow the music we grew up listening to doesn’t relate to our adult reality and our new dreams,” says a disk jockey in one of a handful of format-flip interludes, surrounded by murky, atonal flourishes. His garbled voice rises in pitch as easy-listening piano blossoms in the background. “The main question to mind is, Have you changed? And the answer is, uh, yes.” At this stage in his career, “I’ve changed” would not be a terribly revelatory statement from Oneohtrix Point Never. In recent years, Lopatin has become a skilled choreographer of wrongfooting listeners’ expectations, trading the vaporous textures of his early work for the overdriven “hypergrunge” of Garden of Delete and then the almost incomprehensible world building and dizzyingly recombinant styles of Age Of. It’s tempting to look for an autobiographical subtext in Magic Oneohtrix Point Never; recall that Lopatin took his moniker from Boston’s Magic 106.7, which provided the gauzy soft-rock backdrop of his youth. But Magic, which was created largely during the pandemic, is not so much a format change in Lopatin’s discography as an inflection point or perhaps simply an overlook: an opportunity to take stock of where he’s been and where he might go next. In sound and feel, Magic frequently dwells on familiar sounds and tropes, many of which return to Replica and R Plus Seven. The album is thick with sounds that blur the line between the fake and the real, like plucked and bowed strings, reed, harpsichord, hammered dulcimer, and marimba. Whether sampled, synthesized, or acoustic, they are rich with implicit physicality, evocative of stretching and striking; processed voices are carved into curved, glistening shapes, uncanny as ice sculptures. It’s a ridiculously opulent palette. The thrumming strings of “Long Road Home,” a sort of Mike Oldfield-esque ballad featuring a largely unrecognizable Caroline Polachek, could easily be repurposed for an Audi commercial, while the slicing bows and THX-grade sound effects of “Shifting” evoke big-budget Hollywood blockbusters. “Every song is an opportunity to freak somebody out,” Lopatin has said; the most audacious thing about Magic Oneohtrix Point Never is probably a co-executive producer credit for Abel Tesfaye, aka notorious R&B rapscallion the Weeknd, who reached out to Lopatin after hearing his score for Josh and Benny Safdie’s 2017 film Good Time. After both worked on the Safdies’ Uncut Gems, Lopatin ended up working on a few tracks for the Weeknd’s After Hours. Tesfaye appears only once here—on “No Nightmares,” an ’80s-inspired power ballad reminiscent of Berlin’s “Take My Breath Away”—but Lopatin credits Tesfaye’s feedback in helping to shape the album. (“I needed someone to give me perspective on what I was doing as a music fan because he’s got unbelievable taste,” Lopatin told The Guardian. “He was like: ‘Burn it down! This is an OPN record!’ I was like: ‘Oh yeah, I forgot!’ He was really in my corner as a friend.”) Still, Tesfaye’s fingerprints are not obvious; even on “No Nightmares,” which also features Polachek, his customary falsetto is vocodered beyond recognition, and the lyrics are free of his signature tales of sex, drugs, and self-loathing. One of a handful of pop-adjacent songs on Magic, “No Nightmares” is probably the album’s nadir. It could be that the world simply doesn’t need another “Take My Breath Away,” no matter how ambiguously tongue in cheek; it could be that Lopatin’s principal talent is not in writing pop songs. The really moving parts of Magic happen in its more abstracted tracks, which fortunately comprise the bulk of the album. Following Lopatin’s movements can feel like watching a tornado tear through a fabric mill, ribbons of color spilling out in every direction. In “Bow Ecco,” shoals of harpsichord swirl around plangent woodwinds, directionless yet somehow compelling; “The Whether Channel” (surely one of his best titles yet) arrays sweetly blippy synths over cascading dulcimer and dissonant drones in a way that makes chaos feel somehow lyrical. Lopatin has a remarkable talent for giving shape and movement to an indistinct mass of sonic matter, setting it in motion like a baton-wielding maestro conducting a murmuration of starlings. “Tales From the Trash Stratum” is as beautiful and incomprehensible a piece of music as Lopatin has written. Out of a fog of radio-dial swirl emerge first a blast of noise and then delicate mallet percussion; it soon sounds like Oval taking his Sharpie to a Steve Reich CD against a backdrop of synthetic birdsong, running water, Ren Faire flutes, spaceship whirr, and what might be the startup chime of a vintage Mac hybridized with Cocteau Twins and Harold Budd’s The Moon and the Melodies. Except you barely notice any of these things as discrete sounds; taken together, it all simply sounds like Oneohtrix Point Never. What is so moving about these radically abstracted pieces is their instability and their impermanence; they are always in the process of becoming or disintegrating, and the listener accustomed to OPN’s way of working soon comes to understand that no moment of beauty will last for long; that even the most gorgeous passage will soon crumble to noise—or, worse, become something tacky and distasteful, a song you can’t change the radio dial fast enough to turn off. In this sense, there’s something poignant even in the album’s ugliest bits. Magic Oneohtrix Point Never touches upon all Lopatin’s usual themes: memory and forgetting, nostalgia, the mystery of taste. But where his treatment of those ideas can sometimes seem academic, the album is shot through with a powerful and pervasive sense of melancholy. He told GQ, “I put all of these dead air moments throughout the record—eulogies—to make them say something that felt personal to me as far as my own career, as well as what was happening to the country.” Seen in that light, his sample flips are signs not just of impermanence but also division, of a body politic cleaved in two. It’s a disheartening thought. Toward the end of the album, a disk jockey chirps, “There’ll only be a memory of the music you heard over the years, but the country will not die—it exists at a new home, and I’m sure that home’ll give it the space to grow.” Another announcer’s voice is spliced in: “This has been—this. And this dream is the sound. And this dream will self-destruct in 3… 2…” Drowned out by churning loops of tone, he never gets to finish his sentence. Like other albums created during the pandemic, Magic Oneohtrix Point Never is steeped in the loneliness and disorientation of the present moment. What sets it apart is Lopatin’s willingness to face—with tenderness but little sentimentality—the uncertainty of what might await us on the other side.","Daniel Lopatin’s latest doesn't swerve in a new direction but instead serves as an overlook for his career, highlighting his skill at splicing the old and the new in continually fascinating ways.

Forgotten Days,Pallbearer,by: Grayson Haver Currin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f930843abd2bebdda47558a/1:1/w_160/Forgotten%20Days_Pallbearer.jpg,2020-10-30 05:00:00,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/pallbearer-forgotten-days/,Nuclear Blast,"Doom metal creeps. Half a century since Black Sabbath released Paranoid, arguably the form’s ark of the covenant, most doom bands still sound somewhat like the original, each with assorted refinements. Yes, doom has occasionally splintered into smaller and slower sects, like the lugubrious “funeral doom” and glacial “drone metal.” But consider the progress of hip-hop in roughly the same time frame: While hip-hop has created its own global ecosystem, teeming forever with wild new mutations, doom is a solitary old oak, steadily growing at its own oblivious clip. A decade ago, Pallbearer emerged from Arkansas as promising apostles of doom and purveyors of this stubborn beauty. On their first two LPs, especially 2014’s magisterial Foundations of Burden, they paired the kind of compulsory hooks that made Sabbath stars with the seeming belief that every song could be a 10-minute hypnotic wash. Pallbearer synthesized doom’s best elements into a refulgent melancholy, sparkling as it sulked. They wobbled, though, on Heartless, their 2017 parting shot for longtime label Profound Lore. As though trying to prove how much they’d grown during their tenure there, Pallbearer did too much too fast, flitting from would-be hits that missed to panoramic psych-rock that bored. But on their international debut for Nuclear Blast, a fabled clearinghouse for some of the world’s most popular metal bands, Pallbearer—smarter, sharper, and ostensibly sadder now—again plod doom’s time-worn grooves. Their fourth album, Forgotten Days, is both a return to mighty form and a new way forward for a band perpetually poised at the edge of wider success. Forgotten Days hinges on “Silver Wings,” the 12-minute saga at its center. A quintessential throwback, it is an encapsulation of most everything Pallbearer have done well, like the tangled solos that animate the middle or the crawling tempos that thrill as they build. During the song’s back half, Pallbearer harmonize over kaleidoscopic synthesizers, perfectly fusing their love of Pink Floyd with the intricate singalongs of AOR. “Silver Wings” ponders human frailty and impermanence—or how time grinds “even the greatest of triumphs/To nothing,” as they sing in unison during the last verse—by creating a formidable monument to that very notion. More important than this epic, though, are its bookends. Aside from a twinkling curio on Foundations of Burden, “Stasis” and “The Quicksand of Existence” are the two shortest songs in Pallbearer’s catalogue, clocking in at four minutes each. It’s as if producer Randall Dunn challenged them to squeeze their grandeur onto a seven-inch single. The brevity works. Pallbearer fit a magnetic riff, a compelling hook, and at least one curious instrumental section into each song. Nothing is missing; instead, you gain a sense of how catchy and immediate Pallbearer have always hoped to be, beneath the monolithic solos and militant repetition. How would an entire Pallbearer album so pithy work? The rest of Forgotten Days actually trends that way. Pallbearer never allow indulgence to stand in the way of a song’s urgency here, digging into these grooves without getting stuck there. The title track moves like a mudslide, viscous at the core but relentless as it plows downhill. Brett Campbell’s refrain about the instability of self-doubt—“Is this insanity? Will they come to take me?”—clings to the riff as though it were the only solid ground in sight. The irrepressible “Vengeance & Ruination” is a reminder that the Allman Brothers’ Georgia and Eyehategod’s New Orleans are only a day’s drive from Pallbearer’s home of Little Rock. Finale “Caledonia,” a farewell to youth’s innocence, is a languorous beauty, with keyboards seeping from the cracks between the pensive guitars. When Pallbearer lift into the chorus, you picture them grinning despite the song’s emotional weight, marveling at how good it can feel to share these blues. Campbell and Joseph Rowland wrote Forgotten Days about family loss. Rowland is finally reckoning with the death of his mother nearly a decade ago, just before Pallbearer became a breakthrough band, and the self-medication that followed. Campbell has recently watched his grandmother succumb to the cruelty of Alzheimer’s. These eight songs grapple candidly with these woes, but, like the music itself, the words don’t wallow. Instead, Pallbearer use these tragedies to revel in being alive, or to answer the “gnawing doubts that I ever learned to live.” That is a longtime hallmark of the best doom, too, from Sabbath through Candlemass and now to Pallbearer—staring directly into the dark and squinting to find the light. Forgotten Days convinces you to do the same.","After fumbling slightly on their last record, the doom apostles recover their grave, soaring majesty on an album that find a new way forward by refining their past.

Lift It Down,Jeremiah Sand,by: Will Gottsegen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f973b2e06efd255af1f05f3/1:1/w_160/LiftItDown_JeremiahSand.jpg,2020-10-30 05:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/jeremiah-sand-lift-it-down/,Sacred Bones,"“There's a great spiritual awakening in America,” opined Ronald Reagan in 1983, during an address to the National Association of Evangelicals. “A renewal of the traditional values that have been the bedrock of America’s goodness and greatness.” Among the first shots in the 2018 film Mandy, a psychedelic revenge thriller set in 1983, is a slow pan over Nicolas Cage—a hardened lumberjack, in plaid—listening to a radio broadcast of Reagan’s speech on a dusky drive home from work. Cage lets him prattle on for a few more seconds before switching it off—a gesture that’s quick and measured, but that absolutely screams “shut the fuck up.” That impulse is deeply embedded in Mandy, which pits Cage’s righteous chainsaw-swinger, Red Miller, against a traveling cult called the Children of the New Dawn. Their leader is Jeremiah Sand: a grotesque hybrid of Charles Manson and Bodhi from Point Break, and Miller’s opposite in nearly every respect. His philosophy is a kind of bargain-brand messianism, which he couches in clumsy pronouncements about universal love, though the act is painfully transparent; he’s essentially bad at what he does. He’s also, as it turns out, a musician—in one crucial scene, Sand kidnaps and drugs Miller’s wife, the titular Mandy, and forces her to listen to his terrible single, “Amulet of the Weeping Maze,” which Lakeshore Records actually sold as a promotional tie-in. Now, a full two years after Mandy’s theatrical run, Sacred Bones have taken it a step further and released what they’re calling a newly “unearthed” album from the Jeremiah Sand character, complete with 1600 words of liner notes and fictional backstory from the late experimental musician Genesis P-Orridge. The label is fully playing the part: they haven’t said who really wrote and performed these songs (though the singer sounds a lot like Linus Roache, the actor who plays Sand in the movie), and they’ve neglected to mention that Sand isn’t a real person. Lift It Down blends cheesy psych-folk and chant-like spoken word into music that’s at once grating and platitudinous, silly and sinister. It’s profoundly annoying, which is to say it’s an extremely effective gag, and an implicit commentary on how we engage with our idiot preachers, our snake oil peddlers. The idea, writes P-Orridge, is that Sand recorded this album in a state of “divine mania” during the mid-70s, at a recording studio turned religious outpost in Northern California, and that the tapes were hidden away in a lockbox for the next 40 years. According to a description on Sacred Bones’ website, the record’s “negative psychic energies” had even pioneering reissue label Light in the Attic running scared. It’s intentionally unpleasant stuff: the last utopian dreams of the ’60s curdling into self-parody. The menacing title track sums up Sand’s m.o.: “In the void that surrounds you, you scream like a child/No one can hear you/No one can see you,” he incants, before pointing to a way out: “I’ll love and caress you, and force you to reckon with all that’s impure in your soul.” This is more or less how these songs operate—over garish, sun-soaked instrumentals, Sand plays God in an attempt to get laid. “Golden Desert” is cluttered with pseudo-spiritual bromides and half-baked aphorisms (“Fly with me through the dawning sky,” “Escape the maze”), none of which distract from the obvious charade. And while there are some interesting musical ideas smuggled in throughout (strained, mounting yelps on “Love Is,” the bad-trip Prince pastiche of “Taste the Whip”), the sound of the record is as ridiculous as the concept. When Mandy hears “Amulet of the Weeping Maze,” in the movie, she bursts out laughing. The filmmakers are practically begging you to hate this music. And listening to Lift It Down for the first time, I wanted nothing more than to stem the flow of awkward sex metaphors and chaotic Sgt. Pepper homage. But there’s an unmistakable appeal in how the album straddles the real, involving you in its own psychology, and exposing a particularly American hypocrisy. The ruse is surface-level; it’s honest, in a way, about its lies. If Jeremiah Sand is a gloss on self-interest masquerading as truth, then Lift It Down fully commits to the bit. This album isn’t a call to action, or to reexamine our own relationships with spirituality—it’s just a reminder to tune out the noise. Without a chainsaw, the album suggests, it’s maybe the best you can do.","The 2018 Nicolas Cage vehicle Mandy featured a bargain-brand messiah figure named Jeremiah Sand. Now, Sacred Bones is releasing an “unearthed album,” supposedly recorded in the  mid-’70s by the fictional cult leader.

Lovey,The Lemonheads,by: Charley Ruddell,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f96e01bd938236119fcf00b/1:1/w_160/lovey_the%20lemonheads.jpg,2020-10-30 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/the-lemonheads-lovey/,Fire,"Just as Evan Dando’s long relationship with substance abuse began in earnest, the Lemonheads were swept up in the major-label slog to distill and globalize grunge music en masse. Atlantic Records took a chance signing the frenetic Boston punk band with 1990’s Lovey, a risk predicated on some local buzz and the beguiling allure of Dando’s cleft chin. The album set the mold for the group’s jangly, hard-edged sound through the 1990s and beyond, but when weighed against the blitzed hardcore of their three preceding LPs, Lovey feels tentative, like a prototype alt-rock aggregate targeted at drunk BU kids unhip to the burgeoning sound of Seattle. Lovey arrived at the precipice of Dando’s celebrity bullshit, preceding his entanglements with Kate Moss and Johnny Depp and a well-documented drug habit. For that reason, it occupies a unique position in the Lemonheads’ catalog as their most notable pivot. Falling at the crossroads of rowdy college rock and commercial slacker rock, the album is a vapid vessel null of concept or premise, the tempered segue between the rabid chaos of their first three releases and the polished radio rock yet to come. When you look at the tracklist and see a song called “Stove,” guess what? It’s about a stove. Dig into the album’s Bleach-esque opener, “Ballarat,” and you’ll find a teenager’s fascination with Charles Manson. The wah-pedal grunge of “Lil Seed” is a callow ode to weed. There’s no greater point to be gleaned from these songs, but their indifference is familiar and endearing, a testament to alternative rock at its most blithely inconsequential. Fire Records’ 30th anniversary 2xLP/CD reissue supplements the remastered album with a collection of interviews, unseen photos, and an additional disc with a scrappy live performance from Live at the Wireless, recorded in Sydney and broadcast by Triple J in July 1991. The accompanying book weaves an oral history documenting the Lemonheads’ gradual emergence in Boston through the late ’80s and includes accounts from ex-bandmates Jesse Peretz, drummer David Ryan, guitarist Corey “Loog” Brennan, and producer Paul Q. Kolderie. Spliced with Dando’s press-circuit interviews, these insights offer a strikingly candid look into his ascent to fame: the lost chapters of an irresistibly problematic man ambling down a path of reckless abandon. There are only two unifying themes, the more pungent of which is the olfactory nuance of Budweiser and half-smoked Marlboro Reds; the second is the gruff, unadulterated presence of its author, his gravelly croon at his most melodic yet. The absence of co-songwriter and second lead singer Ben Deily following 1989’s Lick permitted Dando the space to diversify, which he does by name-checking Jesus on the crawling “Ride With Me,” a master template for every post-grunge band sniffing out a slot on Buzz Ballads. Even with a hammy guitar-hero performance on the protracted album closer “[The] Door,” the band feels closer to the Pacific Northwest melodrama of Dirt than to fellow Boston scensters Bullet LaVolta and Big Dipper. As gleaned from the book’s narrative, Dando’s split influences present themselves unadorned. Back-end songs like “Left for Dead”' and “Come Downstairs” stem from the Bob Mould school of three-minute songs with 50 chord changes. He showcases his reverence for California drug guys with an amiable cover of Gram Parsons’ “Brass Buttons”; Live at the Wireless yields a similarly warmhearted performance of Big Star’s “Nighttime.” Most people don’t know this, but Boston was the best city to start a rock band in the 1980s, back before its soaring real estate market relegated punk rock to the catacombs of Jamaica Plain and Allston, a time when the dissolution of Mission of Burma inspired a generation of kids to fill the gaping void. As is true with many of their contemporaries at that time, the Lemonheads were a guileless snapshot of rock regionalism on its last legs. At heart, the deluxe reissue of Lovey is a spiffy vestige of a bygone era, and if Dando managed to make any sort of statement with it, it’s how beneficial it can be to fuck around in your hometown before selling out.","Thirty years after alt rock reshaped the mainstream, Evan Dando and co.’s major-label debut feels like the product of a bygone era—a snapshot of rock regionalism on its last legs.

III,Fuzz,by: Stuart Berman,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f93035aeb2deab0b3f62cd3/1:1/w_160/III_fuzz.jpg,2020-10-29 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/fuzz-iii/,In the Red,"Barring any late-season surprises, 2020 will pass without a new Ty Segall album, something that’s only happened in one other year since his 2008 debut. Of course, even an off year for the industrious California rocker still requires periodic updates of his Discogs page: Segall kicked off 2020 by unveiling a new noise project, Wasted Shirt, with Lightning Bolt’s Brian Chippendale, and he killed some quarantine time by recording an EP of skewed Harry Nilsson covers. Now, in lieu of a proper Segall record, we have the next best thing: a new album from Fuzz, the psych-metal power trio he formed in 2011 with longtime accomplice Charles Moothart. After dropping two albums in quick succession mid-decade, Fuzz seemed to go the way of so many Segall side projects, in that it took the backseat to yet more side projects, like GØGGS and the C.I.A. But Fuzz’s return after a half-decade hiatus is fortuitously timed: After Segall swore off making guitar-based music with 2019’s bouzouki ’n’ koto-speckled First Taste, Fuzz marks his return to raw, guitar-powered rock music (technically, anyway—in Fuzz, he plays the drums while Moothart does the heavy six-string lifting). With III, Fuzz hit the reset button. On their 2015 double album II, Segall, Moothart, and bassist Chad Ubovich stretched the parameters of their proto-metal sound in all directions like a game of Cat’s Cradle played with a rubber band, but on III, everything snaps back into its original shape. There are no Eastern psychedelic flourishes, no string arrangements, no extended space-jazz odysseys, and no lead-vocal turns from Moothart or Ubovich. The focus is squarely on the trio’s elemental strengths: brontosaurus-sized riffs, maximal choogle, and Segall’s acidic melodies, which suggest John Lennon if he had spent the early ’70s hanging with Tony Iommi and Bobby Liebling instead of Elton John and Harry Nilsson. Essentially, what you get here is a Ty Segall album with a beefier bottom end, as the grungy Big Star strut of “Spit” and Thin Lizzied fuzz-punk blitz of “Mirror” snugly sidle up alongside recent Segall rippers like “Break a Guitar” and “She” at the unrulier end of his catalog. As such, III feels more like a sequel to Segall’s sludgetastic 2019 live set Deforming Lobes than Fuzz’s II. And as Deforming Lobes proved, when it comes to documenting a band in its most natural, primal state, there’s no one better to have on hand than Steve Albini, who captures the action here in a crisp audio-verité style that brings this group’s insolent personality to the fore. Even though Fuzz revel in amped-up aggression and bone-crushing heft, their energy is ultimately less macho than mischievous: The marauding opener “Returning” is both as comforting as a wood-paneled rec room and as complicated as a calculus quiz, frequently locking into a stuttering break as if the song were being tazed. On “Nothing People,” the trio send a propulsive Can rhythm crashing headlong into an oncoming Grand Funk boogie, but drop in an uncanny “oooh oooh oooh” hook to soothe the impact. And even when Fuzz veer perilously close to lapsing into blues-rock convention—as in the noodly opening tract of the two-part “Time Collapse”—the musicians seem hyper-aware of their transgression, and deploy everything in their arsenal (be it Segall’s glammy vocal exultations, Ubovich’s restless rhythms, or Moothart’s increasingly outré noise textures) to shake it off. Albini’s live-off-the-floor, overdub-resistant recordings really bring a visceral punch to III’s jammier passages, ensuring that the moments where Moothart peels off for a solo are just as much a showcase for the rhythm section rumbling underneath. And where II’s 13-minute title-track closer saw Fuzz drifting aimlessly out into the unknown, III rallies for a satisfying full-circle finale with “End Returning,” which, over its seven-minute span, cycles through doomy Sabbath lurches, fleet-fingered proggy convulsions, and explosive hardcore outbursts, before climaxing with a triumphant bookending quote of the opening “Returning.” Rather than serve some grand conceptual function, the reprise feels like the sort of callback that a band might drop during an encore medley to cap its live show. But in this case, the most salient sentiment of “Returning” is worth repeating: “There is no sum greater than one,” Segall exclaims, a blood-pact reaffirmation from a long-dormant band whose whole remains greater than its parts.","On their first record in five years, Ty Segall’s proto-metal power trio dig into the fundamentals of their sound, captured in crisp audio-verité style by Steve Albini.

Nirvana,Bktherula,by: Alphonse Pierre,Staff Writer ,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f930498205edae879c033bc/1:1/w_160/nirvana_bktherula.jpg,2020-10-29 05:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/bktherula-nirvana/,Warner,"Bktherula’s 2019 breakout single “Tweakin’ Together” is like a fairy tale made to backdrop a day in the life of the most Instagrammable couples you can imagine. (Maybe the ones who film each other doing tricks at the skatepark. Maybe the ones where both are so fashionable, it physically makes you sick. Or the ones who seem so inseparable that they must have never had a disagreement.) Her music can range from fluttery and lovestruck to songs delivered with the angst of someone who would stomp on the human body that fell to the ground during a mosh pit. “Tweakin’ Together” is so good because it’s a mix of both. “I know these niggas mad as fuck,” she raps on the opening line, so softly it’s like she’s flipping off her critics with a smile on her face. Yes, it’s an unrealistically cool love song. There's no tears, indecisiveness, or paranoia. This mythical perfection is the track’s flaw, but also part of the appeal. Though the absence of more subtle emotions didn’t affect “Tweakin’ Together,” it is a glaring issue on the 18-year-old’s debut mixtape, Love Santana. The project feels like unfinished and shallow scatterbrained sketches were rushed out to help extend the life of her breakthrough single. Admirably, though, the record has plenty of ideas; she attempts to package her punk spirit with an endless bag of Atlanta-rooted melodies, the loose improvisation of punched-in PG County, Maryland rap, and the whimsy of SoundCloud’s melodic crooners. A couple more months of allowing the concepts to bake would have helped, as it does on her newest mixtape, Nirvana. Prior to Nirvana, the most memorable Bktherula songs were the ones where her vocals were as light and airy as hotel pillows. That’s not true anymore; on the tape, Bk is most captivating when she sounds ready to stuff trifling dudes in lockers for not reciprocating her feelings. “All these fuck niggas is fake!/Say they love you to your face!/Really they just playing games!/Bitch, I hope you say your grace!” she screams on “Mind Fuck,” prepared to headbang, and maybe even set a car on fire like Angela Bassett in Waiting to Exhale. “Welcome” is just as good, too. Bk chants as if she’s leading a seance, and the noisy Digital Nas beat will resonate with anyone who has spent too much time listening to the Pro Skater soundtrack. When Bk slightly reels in the JNCO jeans energy, it’s still successful but less striking. On “Admit It,” the spacey instrumental is reminiscent of the far-out C4 and Dun Deal beats you could find on early Young Thug mixtapes, and Bk’s soft-served melody makes the words sound sweet leaving her mouth—despite how aggressive they are: “Yo’ nigga wanna fight, better tell him, ‘Come with it,’” she raps. Similar to Carti and Uzi, Bk is a rapper who always chooses swag over substance. To pull that off across an entire project, the production has to be so tight and imaginative that you hardly notice or care about punchlines that are duds. Nirvana’s defects are because the executive producer Digital Nas—best known for his early work with Lil Yachty—can’t quite build worlds like more fantastical beatmakers such as Pi’erre Bourne, Richie Souf, and Oogie Mane. Sometimes Digital Nas’ celestial sounds leave Bk out to dry, specifically on “More” and “okok/depressing,” both of which feel like off-brand versions of the beats on recent Carti leaks. When it’s all clicking, Bktherula and Digital Nas make fun records together. Notably, “ILoveUBack<3,” is a dreamy love song with a gentle flow and feathery Bk vocals. Unlike the great but unrelatable “Tweakin’ Together,” Bk’s emotions are complex here. She goes through unease and a fear of commitment, as well as joy and euphoria at seemingly inconsequential moments like a late-night back rub. It’s vulnerable in a way that seemed to be hard for her just 10 months ago. But Bktherula is blooming fast, and her music is coming along with it.","After a shaky debut project, the 18-year-old Atlanta rapper gives her punk spirit more space to breathe on her latest mixtape.

acts of rebellion,Ela Minus,by: Madison Bloom,Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f91ff9f2f4c267d613fda4c/1:1/w_160/acts%20of%20rebellion_ela%20minus.jpg,2020-10-29 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/ela-minus-acts-of-rebellion/,Domino,"The underlying theme of Ela Minus’ music is the idea that resistance grows from everyday practices. There are whispers of this across her meticulously crafted debut full-length acts of rebellion, but it’s Minus’ intricate production that commands the most attention. She is both a skilled craftsman and a learned composer: After years of playing in an emo band in her native Colombia, she trained as a jazz drummer at Berklee, where she also learned to design and build synthesizers. Though Minus wrote, produced, engineered, and recorded acts of rebellion at her Brooklyn home, these songs were made for the dark corners of a coldwave disco. Minus alternates between club cuts and wordless, tranquil interludes, front-loading her most aerobic tracks and leaving more contemplative music for the cooldown. Her technical knowledge is especially evident in the album’s lush instrumentals: Opener “N19 5NF” is glittery and dizzying, like staring at the stars while spinning around too fast; “let them have the internet” stretches out like mechanized whale song through a sea of static. In these nonverbal passages, Minus produces canvases more rich and emotive than some of the realities she sings of. The album’s most propsulive entries come in the three-song suite of “they told us it was hard, but they were wrong,” “el cielo no es de nadie,” and “megapunk,” which embroider four-on-the-floor beats with clattering percussion, distant breaths, and buzzing synthesizers. “they told us” and “megapunk” are overtly tied to her mission statement: “I want people to feel like they have the power to change the world,” she recently told Pitchfork, suggesting that such change often starts from small acts. Minus has also said that she writes her lyrics (which are sung in English and Spanish) after the music is completed, often relying on unedited improvisation. This process may account for some of the ambiguity in “megapunk” and “they told us,” which approach the topic of dissent in broad, pared-back vocabulary. From “megapunk”: We can’t seem to find A reason to stay quiet We’re afraid we’ll run out of time To stand up for our rights We can’t seem to find Any peace of mind As much as we try There’s no way out, but fight Minus is well-intended, but it’s hard to peek through these platitudes to find what she’s passionate about. The music is layered and driving and a little bit frosty, and the words don’t stoke a particularly visceral or emotional reaction. The kinetic reaction is undeniable—Minus is more than adept at crafting dance music. But is dancing to this music rebellion enough, or is there more to discuss? On the album’s second half, Minus looks inward, and when she draws from life’s everyday scenes her songs become far more nuanced. On “dominique,” she describes a haze of nocturnal living: spending too much time alone, sleeping well into the evening, and surviving on coffee and liquor. Her voice is breathy and light—a timbre she maintains throughout the album, but one particularly suited to the lone narrator wandering through the wee hours. “The world is made for those who sleep at night,” she speculates over a bittersweet melody that sounds like New Order noir. It’s dance music interested in the loneliness of late-night partying, and Minus tends to the subject with a subtle hand. acts of rebellion examines the quiet, intimate moments of life as well as concepts that are vast and difficult to convey. Minus approaches both with rich and sophisticated electronic music; it may not be outwardly provocative, but it serves as a place to process initial visions of resistance, those that existed in her private space as she wrote these songs. Perhaps that is a kind of everyday change—acts of rebellion are sometimes dreamt up in your room, but they’re rarely completed there.","The Brooklyn-based producer, vocalist, and drummer underlines her frosty club cuts and wordless, tranquil interludes with a message of dissent.

Getting Into Knives,The Mountain Goats,by: Evan Rytlewski,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f9309eb043ba2867b8ec274/1:1/w_160/Getting%20Into%20Knives_The%20Mountain%20Goats.jpg,2020-10-29 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/the-mountain-goats-getting-into-knives/,Merge,"The Mountain Goats used to be an acquired taste. Even by the standards of turn-of-the-century indie rock, they were too esoteric for most, the vocals too sharp, the emotions too raw. But that edge has dulled naturally over the years, as songwriter John Darnielle retired his old boombox for a full band. It was a surprise, then, when Darnielle made a return to his home-recording roots earlier this year with his quarantine album Songs for Pierre Chuvin. Yet where that record captured The Mountain Goats as they’ll always exist in the popular imagination—an unadorned songwriter baring his soul—the second Mountain Goats album of 2020, Getting Into Knives, documents them as they really are: a tasteful ensemble that plays with the kind of easy grace that can only come from years of seasoning on the road. As they’ve dialed down their eccentricities, their sound has grown more approachable. Darnielle, a musician once indifferent to the notion of fidelity, has gradually become a master of it, and even his frayed vocals have been smoothed out. He’s still got a voice like Miracle Whip, with a tang that’s always going to turn some people off, but he’s learned how to sub it into just about any recipe. And over the last several years in particular, he’s relished the freedom that’s given him to branch out. Getting Into Knives is the full-on Memphis record the group’s increasingly lavish albums have been foreshadowing for some time now. Recorded just weeks before March’s lockdown at Memphis’s Sam Phillips Recording, an old Elvis hangout that’s hosted Bob Dylan, Johnny Cash and Roy Orbison, it’s the band’s loosest LP by some distance. Opener “Corsican Mastiff Stride” nods to the studio’s heritage with a rockabilly jaunt, full of brushed drums and shimmying guitars, while bluesy horns punch up “Get Famous.” Session players deftly color every track, most notably Hi Records organist Charles Hodges, so instrumental to Al Green’s heyday records, whose swooping Hammond organ tops “Tidal Wave” and “Harbor Me” like pats of melting butter. Unlike previous Mountain Goats albums about underground wrestlers, aging goths or fantasy worlds, Knives doesn’t have a high concept, but it’s loosely bound by Darnielle’s stories about the pursuit of personal fulfillment, whatever form it may take. On “Corsican Mastiff Stride,” it’s an adventure-seeker courting death at sea, comforted by the companionship of his loyal dog. On the rocker “Rat Queen,” it's the image of vermin scoring big in a fast-food dumpster. And on “Picture of My Dress,” a story spun from a tweet by poet Maggie Smith, it's a liberated bride basking in the open road. In typical Darnielleian detail, she pauses in a truck-stop Burger King bathroom to take notice of an Aerosmith song (“Mr. Steven Tyler is on the overhead speakers/He doesn’t want to miss a thing.”) Even Getting Into Knives’ title track, while ostensibly a revenge story, is framed as an account of someone discovering a new hobby. “I sought wisdom from the sages,” Darnielle sings, “Consulted with master tacticians/Met up with some guys who wouldn’t tell me their last names/They specialized in non-conventional munitions.” As a songwriter, Darnielle’s key rule is never to judge, only to sympathize. That title track caps offs a mellow, low-key final stretch that closes the record not with a bang but a contented sigh. Darnielle’s best songs stick like parables, leaving behind lasting images both poetic and mundane. Most of these songs don’t quite land like that; for all its craft, Getting Into Knives is too casual of a collection to sit alongside The Mountain Goats’ statement albums. But while these may not be Darnielle’s meatiest songs, the rich instrumentation turns them into one of his most welcoming records.","Recorded in Memphis before lockdown, the Mountain Goats’ second album of 2020 is lush and loose, full of stories about personal fulfillment, in whatever form it takes.

Featuring Ty Dolla $ign,Ty Dolla $ign,by: Dani Blum ,Contributor ,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f9300426cde00eab13ed160/1:1/w_160/Featuring%20Ty%20Dolla%20$ign_Ty%20Dolla%20$ign.jpg,2020-10-28 05:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/ty-dolla-sign-featuring-ty-dolla-sign/,Atlantic,"In the time since Ty Dolla $ign’s last solo album, his gritty vibrato has been everywhere. The summer Kanye West’s G.O.O.D. Music dropped five albums, Ty was a staple in their credits. There he was on Scorpion, his falsetto undulating beside Drake’s. He warbled over a tepid Chainsmokers beat, resuscitated a limp Post Malone track, released a gleaming, absurdly horny album of duets with Jeremih, found his way onto the chorus of “Hot Girl Summer” and, most recently, harnessed energy from crystals to croon the hook on SZA’s return single. His range is obvious and impressive; he likes to remind us of it. “You really doing them a favor, blessing them with your talent,” his brother Big TC says in the new album’s opening seconds, recorded from the prison where TC is serving a life sentence for a murder Ty has said he didn’t commit. “You can sing, rap, write, produce, engineer, mix, and master.” It’s a callback to the skit at the start of “Bring it Out of Me,” a thumping electro-flecked standout from Ty’s debut album. “You know how to do everything,” Big TC said then, his voice crackling through the phone. Featuring asserts that mastery over 25 lush, intricate tracks. Every synth and guest verse and snarl of bass glides into place. This is a capital-A Album, designed to be consumed in an hour-long gulp. Some of its most salient moments come in the transitions between songs—the woozy drums in “Temptations” collapse into serpentwithfeet’s elegiac interlude; the screeched adlibs in “Dr. Sebi” drift into the shimmering Gunna collab “Powder Blue.” There are myriad moving parts here: lilting interludes, more guitar than Ty has ever used in a record, an array of high-profile features (including two tracks with Kanye). Ty is less of a curator than a conductor. These songs are intentionally, achingly stitched together, and even the weaker singles shine when played in context. That’s part of the mystery, and the sheen, of Ty’s craft: moments that objectively should not work somehow do. “Damn, that pussy fuego!” he yelps on “Time Will Tell,” but the gentle thrum of guitar and the gooey harmonies wash away that line’s inanity. “I can’t lie, it’s obvious/ Ain’t nobody sexing good as us,” he murmurs in his honeyed flow on “Slow It Down,” and the statement sounds tender amid an immaculate sweep of strings. The more lackluster of these tracks are still slickly competent, with wobbling hooks primed for TikTok dances; the best are spectral and stunning. “Track 6” is particularly elegant, a panoramic swirl that melds Thundercat’s wriggling, ricocheting bass with Anderson .Paak’s best feature in years. Ty has said that he knows, instinctively, who would pair best with him on a beat as soon as he hears it. That intuition has mesmerizing results. Drill rapper Lil Durk writhes over “Double R”’s pulsing drum pattern. Kehlani’s plush harmonies are a perfect complement to Ty’s rasp on “Universe.” “Lift Me Up” turns Future’s burbles about “codeine in a Hi-C” and Young Thug’s wish for an IV filled with molly into a disarmingly lovely prayer. “Your Turn” is the most stirring of these collaborations, a mesh of Musiq Soulchild and Tish Hyman’s velvet vocals and a soft 6LACK verse. It’s the longest track by far, with what Ty has said are his favorite lyrics on the album. They anchor the record in a delicate, nuanced hope. “Nobody’s truly yours,” Tish belts in the chorus, not sounding despondent but genuinely awed at the discovery. “I fell in love at sixteen, in love at 20, fell in love at 22,” Soulchild wails. “Now what the hell does it all mean?” In Ty’s previous albums, this prodding may have led him to get drunk and FaceTime his exes; here, he wishes them well and sounds at peace. The bar for maturity may be pretty low for a guy who’s referred to women as “horses in the stable” and cobbled a breakout hit out of cramming them into a cabana. After a slew of slinky hits about juggling multiple lovers, though, “Temptations” seems like a meditation on fidelity—a sequel to Ty’s club anthem “Paranoid” that sounds actually distressed. “So it’s fuck your feelings, girl, I’m single for the night,” Ty cries, then walks it back later: “My love for you won’t go anywhere,” he breathes, his voice mingling with Kid Cudi’s haunted drone. It’s a more convincing display than the sunny “By Yourself,” a Jhené Aiko-assisted ode to single mothers. Ty’s at his best when he’s wrestling with growth, not proclaiming it. “Many people have said that when you see a song that says, ‘featuring Ty Dolla $ign,’ you know it’s going to be fire,” Ty wrote on Instagram to announce the album. The title is both joking and not, and the weight of what Ty wants to prove hangs over the record. “I told Ye to run for president,” he raps on “Status.”  “He said, ‘Dolla, you too good to put your voice on that generic shit.’” It’s both a flex and a condemnation, a sign that Ty is maybe embarrassed of how he’s spent the last few years. Featuring cements his legacy as a singular, eminent artist — a point he has made again and again and again, but he still sounds so good proving it.","On his latest, Ty asserts his mastery over 25 lush, intricate tracks. With a wide-ranging guest roster including serpentwithfeet and Thundercat, Featuring is a capital-A Album, designed to be consumed in an hour-long gulp.

JP4,Junglepussy,by: Eric Torres,Editorial Producer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f7780d3f861d7460f5a8bb1/1:1/w_160/Junglepussy-Jp4.jpg,2020-10-28 05:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/junglepussy-jp4/,Friends OfJagjaguwar,"Over three brash, gut-busting albums, Junglepussy (aka Shayna McHayle) has established herself as one of New York’s funniest and most unpredictable rappers. Her music fizzes with outlandish, sex-positive lines delivered in a rollicking flow and bolstered by her endless self-reliance in the face of shitty men. There’s very little she won’t try musically or otherwise, even making a stellar acting debut opposite Regina Hall in the 2018 dramedy Support the Girls. Junglepussy follows up that performance with her fourth album, JP4, an eclectic blend of narcotized trip-hop and uplifting R&B that expands on both her sound and themes of self-sufficiency by leading listeners deeper into her psyche than ever. Junglepussy’s vervy punchlines are still her strongest asset, and her bars delight and divulge in equal measure. She’s obsessive to a fault on “Telepathy,” with a monotone delivery that contrasts her single-minded lust: “No more drunk sex in your Porsche/I’m my own snack, why you brought me to the store?” she asks over knocking drums and a squawking synth from producer Dave Sitek—before clarifying that her friends think she should dump this guy. “What a waste of toothpaste/Brushing my teeth only to smile in yo face,” she seethes later on the bouncy “Morning Rock,” accompanied by the sound of scrubbing and spitting into the sink. “Brushing my teeth but the regret donʼt erase.” The back-and-forth between her authoritative declarations and admissions of inner turmoil tee up Junglepussy’s comedic lines for head-spinning effect. JP4 slips through many mercurial moods, yet solid production choices enable all of them to resonate as distinctly Junglepussy. Trip-hop is the main touchstone here—on the taunting “Spiders,” lurching drums and a distant bassline from Nick Hook recall Massive Attack, while the spooky laughter and ad-libs echoing in the background intensify the uneasiness. Sporting Life (formerly of Ratking) submerges late-album highlight “Arugula” in an amniotic glow, with a looped, pitch-shifted horn sample that recurs like the fog of breath on glass. Junglepussy adopts an affecting mumble that magnifies her lyrics, which sound on the verge of a crack-up: “Congratulations, maybe Iʼm jaded/I couldʼve sworn I seen you loving things you said you hated/Wasnʼt I the one to make you love the shit you hated?” Junglepussy is more in her head than usual throughout JP4, but she transforms all traces of self-doubt into a source of power and independence. Over a ruptured backdrop and roiling synths on “What You Want,” another Sitek production that evokes his more agitated songs with TV on the Radio, she broods on making an exit from the music industry: “I canʼt afford to mingle it cost me my sanity/I be happy out the industry like Iʼm Kelis/Rock stars is Black farmers peep the harvest.” But she always finds a way through. On “Out My Window,” a feel-good centerpiece that’s close in spirit to 2018’s buoyant JP3, she recruits Brooklyn gospel/R&B singer Ian Isiah for a sunny chorus that builds to the funk-inflected bridge where she sing-songs her boasts: “When youʼre poppinʼ you confuse them/Make them pay for the amusement.” JP4 embodies that sure-footed confidence, creating another lane for Junglepussy to mold in her own image.","Against a blend of narcotized trip-hop and uplifting R&B, the New York rapper’s fourth LP flips all traces of self-doubt into a source of power and independence.

Three States: Rarities 1997-2007,Dear Nora,by: Quinn Moreland,Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f846c0f05f2c0fd712c1a40/1:1/w_160/three%20states_dear%20nora.jpg,2020-10-28 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/dear-nora-three-states-rarities-1997-2007/,Orindal,"Katy Davidson was in a rut. It was 2008, and after releasing three full-lengths and several EPs under the name Dear Nora, Davidson had retired the indie pop project and grown disenchanted with music. As they recall, their then-label, Portland’s Magic Marker, encouraged them to gather all their stray one-offs, covers, and song drafts into one collection, which was to be named Three States: Rarities 1997-2007. As Dear Nora waited in hibernation, the anthology of 60-ish simple and heartfelt songs became a fan favorite. Twelve years after its original release, Three States: Rarities 1997-2007 is now receiving the reissue treatment from Orindal. Featuring a slightly expanded tracklist, the triple LP box set essentially tells the story of Dear Nora, which Davidson began in 1999 while studying at Portland’s Lewis & Clark College. As they write in the reissue’s liner notes, the project was initially less inspired by their K Records peers than by hook-heavy, kinda dweeby indie rockers like Weezer, Guided by Voices, and They Might Be Giants. Full of bouncy melodies and scrappy energy, Dear Nora’s first efforts channel the pure exhilaration of making music with your friends. But even these early sketches reveal the thoughtfulness that would define Dear Nora. On “Second Hand,” Davidson expresses astonishment at the neverending passage of time and uses the double meaning of the title to convey uncertainty. “Make You Smile” struggles with confrontation while “Up on the Roof” announces a plan to escape to a better life. While Dear Nora features an evolving troupe of players, Davidson has always been the primary songwriter and sole permanent member, so their location and general state of being guides the project. In mid-1999, Davidson moved into a house alongside some Magic Marker labelmates. From an upstairs bedroom overlooking a cherry tree and a public park filled with squirrels, Davidson wrote and recorded eight short songs that would become 2000’s Dreaming Out Loud 7-inch. Featuring just Davidson, an acoustic guitar, and overdubs, these songs may be elementary, but they capture Dear Nora’s capacity to let a thought unravel into a miniature dissertation about their place in the world. Take “My Guitar,” which begins as an index of material objects and transforms into a philosophical mission statement: “’Cause how I want to live is effortless/And all I want to feel is not distressed/’Cause all I ever need is less and less every day.” And much like the Beach Boys song of the same name, “In My Room” pays tribute to solitude. As Davidson describes how the moonlight pouring in through a window pulls them into dreamland, “In My Room” feels comforting like a well-loved stuffed animal. Beyond the bedroom were ample opportunities for inspiration, and as Davidson toured more, the scope of their observations expanded. The barely-there “Fargo” (written during a 2002 tour with Mates of State) envisions the titular city as a beacon of warmth amidst Midwestern sprawl and desolation. “Cheap liquor and cigarettes/Neon signs and off-track bets/Old Grand-Dad in the supermarket aisle/And all the kids in old Cadillacs,” Davidson sings, pulling a page from Springsteen. Meanwhile, a cover of “Girl From the North Country” transforms Dylan’s classic into a queer anthem of longing and nostalgia. But even as songs stretched their legs and experimented with lusher compositions, the themes remained familiar: transience, an appreciation for the natural world, and sincere awe at the world around them. In 2004, Dear Nora released their opus, Mountain Rock. For that record, Davidson decamped to a geodesic dome in their home state of Arizona and recorded a series of windswept songs about the pleasures and pains of the sublime. Around the same time, Davidson, Jake Longstreth and Marianna Ritchey convened in a San Francisco basement to work on a series of songs that came to be part of what they referred to as “The Lost Album.” Several moments are siblings to songs that appeared on Mountain Rock, like “The Lonesome Border, Pt. 2.” In the Three States: Rarities 1997-2007 liner notes, Longstreth describes this as “a very Abbey Road kind of jam,” which is spot-on, from the familiar piano intro to the multi-tracked vocal harmonies. Though it features the same coyotes and jackrabbits as the understated version that made it onto the album, “The Original Mountain Rock” goes further in its search for meaning in the desert. “Down under clouds of thunder/My mind begins to wonder/If this night/Is a symbol or an end,” Davidson asks. In 2017, after making music under other names, Davidson resurrected Dear Nora for a reissue of Mountain Rock. The reception to the record and tour was so positive that Davidson was inspired to release an album of new Dear Nora material, 2018’s Skulls Example. Though Davidson’s influence on a new generation has been well-documented, the reissue of Three States: Rarities 1997-2007 further cements Davidson’s role as a prolific and profound songwriter.","The indie pop band's reissue of loosies and cover songs captures their story in thoughtful strokes and further cements Katy Davidson’s role as an influential songwriter.

Wachito Rico,Boy Pablo ,by: Adlan Jackson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f889f6246ede078a4647488/1:1/w_160/wachito%20rico_boy%20pablo.jpg,2020-10-28 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/boy-pablo-wachito-rico/,U OK?,"If social media is good for one thing, it’s making people famous very quickly. No longer must artists claw their way through arenas of authenticity and endure demands that they conform to the tastes of the powerful. No more do they need the co-signs of a thousand petty tyrants at record labels here and nightclubs there. Musicians in the age of social media need only engage with raw consumer demand, and in that freedom they’ll find something real, and share it with us listeners. Or so we’d hope. Boy Pablo's video for “Everytime” went crazy on Youtube, and it's easy to see why: skater boys smirking in streetwear on the banks of a drifting river in Norwegian twilight. At the end, there’s a dog on a boat. It's a vibe; people, young people especially, go nuts for that sort of thing. When Nicolas Muñoz, the Chilean-Norwegian 21-year-old behind Boy Pablo, released the Soy Pablo EP tens of millions of views later in 2018, it was full of more songs like “Everytime.” The mopey, dopey lyrics retained their winking melodrama, but the novelty wore off. In Boy Pablo’s debut full-length, Wachito Rico, Muñoz dips back into the same rapidly-depleting well: Stratocasters jangle, synth pads yawn, major seventh chords are tossed out with abandon. The album is filled with nearly indistinguishable third-hand indie-pop songs, with titles like “i hope she loves me back,” “hey girl” and “leave me alone!” Sadboys should at least be able to convincingly sound sad, but Wachito Rico can’t transcend the emotional blankness lurking beneath its zeitgeisty sound. Boy Pablo’s previous discography revolved around unrequited pining, and on this record, he finally gets the girl. But Muñoz can’t seem to come up with anything more interesting to say about the object of his affection than that she’s hot (“Honey”) and he likes hanging out with her (“Nowadays”). Muñoz’s big brothers in the indie-pop frat house have their respective charms. Alongside the irony and bawdiness, Mac DeMarco offers thoughtfulness and fun; there is a beating heart beneath Real Estate’s wistfulness, and their lush guitar sounds are crafted with care. Even Two Door Cinema Club sound like they sincerely want something. Boy Pablo, meanwhile, seem to have transmuted DeMarco’s mischief into pure condescension for their young audience, and sonically copied Real Estate’s whole fucking flow, word-for-word, bar-for-bar. In the times he attempts to prove he has more to offer than mere virality, Muñoz manages to disrupt the monotony only briefly, mostly by pushing new Latin-American influences to the fore. “Te Vas / Don’t Leave” builds from Spanish guitar and voice to a production of synths and artificial strings, and Muñoz finally pushes himself, approaching something like conviction. How much is fair to expect from a young indie-pop band? Who should really be blamed for an album like Wachito Rico? Mr. Muñoz, who is frankly too young to sound this jaded? The YouTube algorithm? Mac Demarco, for not raising his failsons strictly enough? Maybe it’s all of us who have humored this type of indie for too long. Social media has truncated the path from the bedroom to the festival stage. We can continue to hope that the absence of the stodgy, gatekept spaces that used to lie between will allow for shocking, unruly artistry. Wachito Rico, though, is a warning against complacency: Bored boys, with a few synth presets, can still stumble their way to stardom.","Three years after a brush with the YouTube algorithm turned him unexpectedly into a minor indie-pop star, Nicolas Muñoz still sounds unsure about what to do next.

This Place Sucks Ass EP,PUP,by: Peyton Thomas,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f91994ac974cbd231e483bf/1:1/w_160/This%20Place%20Sucks%20Ass%20EP_PUP.jpg,2020-10-27 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/pup-this-place-sucks-ass-ep/,Little DipperRise,"This virus has taken so much from us, not least of all my right to break my nose in the pit at a PUP show. Way back in February, when COVID-19 was still just a scary headline to scroll past, I wanted, desperately, to hit their set in Peterborough, a small town outside of Toronto. (All the members of PUP hail from Hogtown, as do I.) But the last Greyhound back to the city would leave the station long before the show’s conclusion: a one-two punch, usually, of “If This Tour Doesn’t Kill You, I Will” and “DVP;” unmissable. Because I couldn’t afford an Airbnb, and because my efforts to arrange a carpool via r/puptheband proved fruitless, in the end, I threw up my hands. “Oh, well,” I said, “I’m sure they’ll play more hometown shows this year.” Eight months on, as I write this review, perched at my kitchen table in the apartment I’ve not left in seven months, I wish I’d made Peterborough work. This is the very intentional irony in the title of This Place Sucks Ass, a six-track follow-up to last year’s excellent Morbid Stuff, composed largely of outtakes from PUP’s recording sessions for that album. “This place sucks ass” was something the band used to say “as a joke a million times on tour,” says frontman Stefan Babcock, whether they were performing in “Lethbridge, Alberta or New York City.” Like many of you, I’ve been yearning this year for any show, anywhere, no matter how much the place sucks ass. I especially miss pits. I miss tossing my body into a sweat-slick crowd of other bodies, inviting harm instead of hiding all year from it. On these new songs, PUP emphasize the ways pain demands to be felt. In the past, the band offered a simple solution to the agony caused by drugs and alcohol: more drugs and alcohol. This time around, there’s no such numbing. On opening ragers “Rot” and “Anaphylaxis,” Babcock confronts his body in vivid, tangible terms: blood spilling, hives swelling, tissue turning green. There are no chemical solutions in these songs, whether licit (“I took the medicine, it wasn’t working”) or otherwise. Hell, in the chorus of “Anaphylaxis,” Babcock sings “way too stoned” like it’s a bad thing. These songs are acutely aware of physical pain. They invite listeners to sit with pain of their own, to study it, and, of course, to scream through it. It’s a remarkable shift for a band whose previous therapeutic suggestions involved going “numb, and losing feeling” before barreling ramsquaddled down the Don Valley Parkway at 180 kilometers per hour. Drunk and disorderly conduct still pops up on This Place Sucks Ass, but it’s tempered now by a newfound conscience and a commitment to recovery. Reeling from a break-up on “Nothing Changes,” Babcock requests “a quiet lull, some books, and alcohol,” before promising to “begin again” in the morning. Though the weary chorus complains that “nothing changes, no, nothing ever changes,” echoing the sentiment of 2016’s “Familiar Patterns,” it’s very evident that something has changed. Four years ago, an average evening looked like “knocking back Jell-O shooters till I puked in the kitchen;” these days, he makes do with a glass of wine and a good book. The stunning closer “Edmonton” does see our hero returning to old, bad habits—hunched drunk over a urinal, awash in guilt over missing friends’ birthdays “and a couple of funerals.” Here, though, the regret feels useful. The song flies by, a “Full Blown Meltdown”-esque rager condensed to a mere seventy seconds, but it has the quality of a man stepping outside of himself and floating through a moment frozen in time. He looks at his bandmates on the stage, feels searing guilt for “singing songs about killing them,” and mourns a friend whose “body… is still warm in the ground.” PUP is beloved for diaristic songs about venting anger in unhealthy, dangerous, and even violent ways. These struggles have not disappeared now that they’ve earned a couple of Polaris nods and dived off some big stages and played the hits for adorable head-banging puppets on Canadian children’s television. Babcock sings movingly, in “Rot,” of his ongoing struggle with self-loathing, despite all the listeners who look up to him, who sing his lyrics back to him at shows. He rehearses an acceptance speech, delivering a superb, sneering, “I wanna thank the Academy,” but wonders privately whether he even deserves recognition, whether he’s not just full of shit. If the record feels like PUP’s most forward-looking, optimistic music ever, it may be an attempt to reckon with this new role-model status. There is an honest wish, in their cover of Grandaddy’s “A.M. 180,” to imagine a future where “something good happens.” The weak nihilism of “Nothing Changes” doesn’t even survive to the end of its chorus: “Even if the wait is long, and all the words are wrong/Put the recorder on, and I’ll begin again.” They sound like they’re about five seconds from hollering about orcas. If The Dream is Over dramatized the one-step-forward-five-steps-back reality of recovery, and Morbid Stuff rejected the practice of reveling in sadness, This Place Sucks Ass is a dispatch from beyond the moment of catharsis, after the floodgates have closed, sucking down shitty instant coffee in the back row of your 20th or 30th AA meeting. Really, though, all of this is a continuation of the familiar PUP ethos: standing up and screaming about what ails thee is vastly preferable to standing still and shutting up about it. Before the term was bastardized by roommates who never fill up the fucking Brita, “emotional labor” described the work of managing emotion in the low-wage service sector. There is something truly soul-killing about earning five bucks an hour to grin into the face of a shrieking Karen, to not even wince as the spittle flies out of her mouth and paints your face. Conversely, there is freedom in being forthright about your feelings, ridding yourself of any requirement to slap on a smile while your whole world crumbles. If you can rise to your feet and declare proudly that this place sucks ass, you’ve taken the first step toward creating a place that sucks less ass.","The pop-punk band’s six-track follow-up to last year’s Morbid Stuff invites listeners to sit with pain of their own, to study it, and, of course, to scream through it.

Moveys,Slow Pulp,by: Julia Gray,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f91957b61407d7c7077765d/1:1/w_160/moveys_slow%20pulp.jpg,2020-10-27 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/slow-pulp-moveys/,Winspear,"Moveys, the self-produced debut LP from the Wisconsin-bred, Chicago-based band Slow Pulp, is a soundtrack for aimless afternoon walks and light existential crises, as the temperature drops and our hours spent outdoors shorten. It arrives into an uncertain autumn, half a year through a pandemic with no end in sight, on the precipice of an unknowable winter. Both cathartic and restrained, the album feels like a prelude to seasonal depression, fueled by internal battles and external tensions. There’s strength to be derived from Emily Massey’s cool moan as it pierces the warm acoustics, a magnetic resilience that comes through with each word: “If I could treat myself better/I know I’m still getting better.” She sings about the exhausting task of being alive—the load is particularly heavy on the topic of relationships, tracing the longing, the pursuit, the letdown, and the recovery. She’s “holding out for the downside” on “Idaho” and seeing through that self-fulfilled prophecy on the punk-tinged “At It Again.” Slow Pulp worked on Moveys while on tour with Alex G last year, and his influence is evident. The album is marked by down-tuned guitars and lyrics that don’t paint a picture as much as they set a mood. “Track” is led by a spiraling riff that recalls some of Alex G’s more recent, polished material mixed with cadences reminiscent of Soccer Mommy. “Falling Apart” internalizes the familiar feeling of failure: “Why don’t you go back/To falling apart/You were so good at that...Feeling like a deadbeat / Everything is incomplete.” Violins spin defeat into something vaguely comforting. For the most part, Moveys is a well-structured album. The tracklist reflects the monotony and fatigue of depression, with alternating textures that keep things engaging, a grungy crooner alongside a triumphant piano interlude. But the final bonus track calls these choices into question. The titular ""Movey"" is a goofy dance tune—complete with vinyl scratching, bass grooving, and someone yelling “Scram!”—an abrupt follow-up to a song that laments, “I’m a loner with no plans.” While the closer may not immediately resonate with a listener coming down from 25 minutes of introspection, it succeeds in ejecting you from the album, almost as if Slow Pulp is rolling the credits and yelling, “show’s over, folks.” It puts the preceding melancholia into perspective, no longer dire. There’s hope on the other side.","The self-produced debut from the Chicago-based band recalls the downcast, hazy vibe of Alex G and Soccer Mommy.

Under the Spell of Joy,Death Valley Girls,by: Stuart Berman,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f905966043ba2867b8ec18a/1:1/w_160/under%20the%20spell%20of%20joy_death%20valley%20girls.jpg,2020-10-27 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/death-valley-girls-under-the-spell-of-joy/,Suicide Squeeze,"Death Valley Girls ringleader Bonnie Bloomgarden has said that her band’s initial bucket-list goal was to meet Iggy Pop. On their first two albums—2016’s Glow in the Dark and 2018’s Darkness Rains—they set the bait, in the form of sassy, saxy garage rock that hit the sweet spot between the Stooges and Shangri-Las. The gambit worked: Not only has Iggy given the group his blessing (calling them “a gift to the world”), he starred in the video for their 2018 single “Disaster (Is What We’re After),” spending its entire four-minute runtime chowing down on a cheeseburger with pure Warholian ambivalence. But now that they’ve fulfilled their dream of meeting Iggy in the physical world, Death Valley Girls are challenging themselves to commune with him in the metaphysical one, by channelling the animalistic abandon and sax-blasted ferocity of the Stooges at their Fun House freakiest. Under the Spell of Joy is not a soundtrack for eating cheeseburgers—it’s music for barfing up the poison in your soul. Death Valley Girls have always dabbled in the language and iconography of the occult—the title Under the Spell of Joy isn’t much of a thematic stretch for a group whose repertoire already includes “Love Spell”—but this time they dial down the camp to harness its sinister allure and ceremonial grandeur. They’ve also grown their flock of parishioners, adding Delta 72 frontman/Cat Power sideman Gregg Foreman on keyboards, album MVP Gabe Flores on sax, and a small cast of singing children to enhance the commune vibe. And yet, for all its black-mass organ drones, apocalyptic sax squeals, and demonic girl-group chants, Under the Spell of Joy is an album that radiates positivity, a psych-punk self-help manual that suggests finding happiness in a world of shit requires some black-magick intervention. Recently, Bloomgarden has spent less time name-dropping musical heroes than philosophical ones, like psychedelic oracle Terence McKenna and occult historian Mitch Horowitz, and their liberation philosophies permeate her lyric sheet. She spends most of this record floating—up in clouds, through dreams, into alternate realms—as a means to free herself from the demands of everyday life and realize her true potential. “Highlight what you see, this is the dream,” she shouts atop the hypnotic bass throb and scrambled sax frequencies of “Hypnagogia,” before enshrining her self-affirmations as a daily ritual: “Rise, shine, and repeat!” The winsome Ronettes-via-“Sister Ray” romp “Bliss Out” is even more explicit in its live-for-the-moment directives: “Be here right now, ’cause we’re all gonna die,” Bloomgarden sings, leaving us with the reassurance that “we’re just traveling time/we’re all in the sky/so bliss out.” But even as it revels in new-age proselytizing, Under the Spell of Joy never treats inner peace as a given—it’s something achieved by going on the offensive, by engaging in continual struggle. The title track’s heavy soul-punk stomp transforms its circular mantra—“under the spell of joy/under the spell of love”—into a war cry, while the “10 Day Miracle Challenge” reframes Horowitz’s namesake motivational strategy as a blistering garage-punk attack on complacency and insecurity. Under the Spell of Joy’s most effective advice arrives in the form of its mesmerizing centerpiece “The Universe,” where Death Valley Girls not only offer a design for life, but immediately put it into action. “Live freer than the freedom that you trust/Dream bigger than the things that lift you up,” Bloomgarden preaches, as the band break free from their garage-punk roots and ascend to the realm of spiritual psych-jazz rockestra atop a cloudbed of misty organ drones and saxophone smog. It’s quite the dramatic turn of events for a band whose concept of joy used to involve watching horror movies on TV and going to the disco. But Death Valley Girls are ready to forgo simple pleasures in pursuit of eternal ecstasy.","Harnessing the allure of the occult and the power of self-help, the Los Angeles garage rockers break free from their roots and ascend to the realm of spiritual psych-jazz rockestra.

Monarch Season,Jennifer Castle,by: Sam Sodomsky,Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f91fc3e043ba2867b8ec230/1:1/w_160/monarch%20season_jennifer%20castle.jpg,2020-10-27 05:00:00,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/jennifer-castle-monarch-season/,Paradise of Bachelors,"There is nowhere to hide on Monarch Season. The latest album from Canadian songwriter Jennifer Castle is as open-ended and unfurnished as folk music can get. Each of its songs was recorded at Castle’s Ontario home, the windows open to let in sounds from Lake Erie just outside. The lyrics are bound by a focus on the moon, but you would be hard-pressed to find anything resembling a narrative in her writing. “I see the wings in everything,” Castle sings in the title track, offering a key into the imagistic worldview that spans her music. In an interview with Kreative Kontrol, Castle described the recording process for this album, a solitary exercise featuring just a few appearances from long-time collaborator Jeff McMurrich, as being somewhat improvised. Instead of complete thoughts, she favored the feeling of uncertainty. When she takes a long pause between her words, as she does throughout the slow-motion highlight “Moonbeam or Ray,” she lets you linger in that space with her. The goal is to present her songs like fireflies in a jar: glowing, alive, and waiting to be released back into the night. The quiet of this record is particularly effective in response to 2018’s Angels of Death, a lush full-band album that accompanied Castle’s writing on grief with the most sweeping music of her career: One of its best songs, “Rose Waterfalls,” sounded like the theme to an imaginary ’70s film about a country singer living on a commune. It was a record that framed her voice, a distinctive instrument pitched between the melodic depth of Emmylou Harris and the outsider charm of Kath Bloom, as a leading force: a vessel for storytelling, high drama, and big questions. On Monarch Season, she subverts this authority, blending into the atmosphere of her piano and acoustic guitar. Sometimes, her voice disappears completely. Castle bookends the record with the wordless acoustic opener, “Theory Rest,” and a coda of field recordings, giving it the aura of a live set broadcast from her home (although it was completed before lockdown this year). She aids this intuitive structure by including “Veins,” a song she first recorded for her 2006 debut. Accompanying herself on acoustic guitar, she punctuates her words with a wheezy motif on harmonica that comes out slightly glitched, like the recording had been warped by the time that’s passed. These psychedelic effects are a way for Castle to toy with the mechanics of her songwriting, to keep her music from resembling anything that feels traditional or reverent to the past. The most old-school sounding moment is “I’ll Never Walk Alone,” with melodic fingerpicking that seems transported from an old British folk song. But instead of singing along, Castle uses her warbling, hushed voice to play against its catharsis. In the lyrics, she alludes to the draining quality of performing live, trying to please an audience of more than just herself: “I birthed from the mouth of a cave/And I walked to the front of the stage,” she sings. “I labored all night for them/Labored all day.” In these words, Castle implies a distance between the two poles of her career—the solitary spark of creation and the presentation of her completed work to the world. The thrill of Monarch Season is in how she collapses these roles, offering her music as something both thoughtful and unfinished. (The physical edition of the record comes with a songbook, allowing listeners to recreate her process and rebuild these songs from scratch.) The result is an inventive and subtly visceral record. On any given listen, we are invited to travel its distance along with her: to quiet our thoughts, take a deep breath, and linger in the strange, uneasy space between where we started and where we’re going next.","The Canadian songwriter blends into the atmosphere of her piano and acoustic guitar, presenting her exceedingly intimate music as an inventive and subtly visceral experience.

Love Is the King,Jeff Tweedy,by: Stephen Thomas Erlewine,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f905029b42652c21f25aab8/1:1/w_160/love%20is%20the%20king_jeff%20tweedy.jpg,2020-10-26 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/jeff-tweedy-love-is-the-king/,dBpm,"It’s conceivable that Jeff Tweedy was in a better position than most musicians to thrive creatively while sheltering in place. Locked down with his family, he could call upon his sons Spencer and Sammy for musical support, and they all could head over to the Loft, the private studio that Tweedy and Wilco built over 20 years ago and maintain to this day. In addition to having access to gear and supporting musicians, the singer-songwriter also benefited greatly from a regular, reliable writing method, one that he documents in How to Write One Song, a book published concurrently with the release of Love Is the King. Separating Love Is the King from How to Write One Song may be impossible. Tweedy began composing songs for the album while at work on his songwriting handbook, using some of his freshly minted tunes to illuminate particular points of his process. Real-time insight into the writing and recording of a new rock album is rare enough to make this book unique, but How to Write One Song is decidedly not a set of liner notes to Love Is the King. It’s a manifesto advocating the power of everyday creativity, imploring the reader to look at songwriting not as divine inspiration but rather as a practical craft: Assemble the parts, learn how to use the tools at your disposal, toil away for a set amount of time on a daily basis, and it becomes feasible to finish one song; after that, perhaps one more. Love Is the King is a testament to the virtues of this creative approach. Tweedy’s method is designed to sustain a songwriter through dry spells while also doubling as a journal of the moment; such a technique is surely beneficial when grappling with the existential stresses generated by a global pandemic. Love Is the King contains no attempts at grand pronouncements on the state of the world in lockdown. Rather, it’s a series of vignettes, secular hymns, and snapshots, all loosely arranged around the notion of human connection. Nothing moves too fast here. “Gwendolyn” ambles along to a groove that’s just a shade soulful, “Opaline” moseys ahead with a slight grin, and “Natural Disaster” is a shambling bit of country-rock that stands out not only for its rhythm but also for how its sardonic view of love cuts against the warm sentiments that flow through the record. Warmth doesn’t preclude the presence of loneliness or worry. The gravity of isolation weighs down the narrator of “Bad Day Lately” and self-doubt nags at the heart of “Troubled,” but there’s a recurring theme of the solace and sustenance to be found within lasting love. It surfaces on the hushed “Even I Can See,” whose pivotal verse hinges on finally being able to view the presence of a god through the love of his wife, and in the murmured devotions floating throughout the semi-narcotic thrum of “Half-Asleep.” None of these songs demand much attention from the listener, but that mellowness is part of the record’s charm. It’s music sprung from the yearning desire for comfort and connection in a difficult time, music whose meaning lies in the act of the creation itself. Since it was made during a time of seclusion, not just for Tweedy but also his audience, the imagery and emotions threaded through Love Is the King can’t help but contain empathetic echoes for listeners still struggling with a year spent apart from loved ones. The reason the record provides some measure of consolation is due to its modesty. Rather than a concept album about quarantine, it’s a snapshot of a moment in time, one that captures the confusion, longing, and loneliness of a world set back on its heels.","Released in conjunction with his book How to Write One Song, the Wilco frontman’s response to the pandemic is a mellow, easygoing collection of songs stressing the importance of human connection.

The Menswe@r Collection,Menswe@r,by: Ben Cardew,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f9057bcabd2bebdda4753fe/1:1/w_160/menswear%20collection_menswear.jpg,2020-10-26 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/menswear-the-menswear-collection/,Demon,"Pop music’s history is best written not by the winners or the losers, but by the bands who fall in between: the latecomers, coattail riders, and almost-made-its whose relatable success gives the closest insight into what a musical scene was really like after the outliers and innovators had blazed their trail. In this sense it is Menswe@r—well-connected London scenesters whose moment in the sun was as brief as their rise was meteoric—who, more than Pulp, Blur, or Oasis, epitomised Britpop in all its plasticky glory. Formed in 1994, the year of Our Lord Parklife, Menswe@r signed a v@st record de@l after a handful of gigs, appeared on Top of the Pops before their first single was released, and scored a Top 20 hit with their debut album, Nuisance, before heading into sharp decline. A flagship single flopped, the band parted company with their label, and a second album, the Camden country-flavored ¡Hay Tiempo!, was only released in Japan. In 1998 Menswe@r called it a day, their name a lingering reminder of the worst excesses of Britpop, as British music fans en masse tried to pretend they had actually always been more into Radiohead. Menswe@r’s persistent infamy, while perhaps inevitable in the UK’s fast-moving music scene, was not entirely deserved. The Menswe@r Collection, a 4xCD box set that rounds up almost everything the band recorded, does unwittingly highlight a number of Britpop’s glaring faults, packed as it is with retro obsessions, dry production, and a lingering feeling of trying far too hard. “Daydreamer,” the band’s best-known song, sounds so loaded with naked commercial ambition that it is hard to imagine it was born out of actual human emotion. At the same time, the song is a telling example of Menswe@r’s Wire-meets-Roxy Music pop peacocking, with enough sultry hooks, glam strut, and suggestion of sexual misadventure beneath the radio-friendly sheen to make it an acceptable bedfellow to Suede’s poppier moments. If you were a major-label A&R in London during the Britpop era, you would have bid big money for them too. Nuisance, remastered for disc one of this set, is essentially more of the same Britpop bombast: acute pop hits, angular attitude, and one-paced gloss; music for trying out cheap copies of expensive shoes. That the band eked three Top 20 hits out of the album is a sign of both how dominant Britpop came to be and Menswe@r’s infectious commercial confidence; the hooks on “Sleeping In” and “Stardust” are as sharp as the band’s mod suits and twice as well worn. Disc two, A Sides and B Sides, while considerably more varied, largely proves that the British music industry’s taste for endless new chart-eligible formats in the 1990s was tinged with delirium—would any sane record company executive have greenlit Menswe@r’s drum’n’bass-driven cover of PIL’s “Public Image”? Menswe@r evidently picked their best songs for their first album, although the spaghetti Western boogie of “26 Years,” a B-side on Sleeping In, shows that the band could be considerably more interesting when they rolled up their shirt sleeves and let down their hair. The disc is also home to the deeply unloveable “We Love You,” the song that sunk Menswe@r’s career by stalling at a then-unacceptable 22 in the UK charts. It’s the kind paper-thin faux epic British bands were so keen on at the time, a song that strains every artless sinew in an attempt to be anthemic. The feeling of fruitful relaxation that runs through “26 Years” continues toward the back end of disc four (Rarities and Demos) as we see the band reach beyond the Sta-Prest glam punk of their debut album on their way to ¡Hay Tiempo! A promising set of songs from the second album’s sessions shows the band dabbling in Small Faces-style blues psychedelia (“She Makes Him”), the baroque pop of the Zombies (“Is This the Way”) and Valium-era Beach Boys (“Pick Me up on Your Way Down”). It’s sweet, unoriginal, and rather intimate—a drunken bearhug to Nuisance’s cocaine stare—although the band’s light-fingered approach to melody once again lets them down on “Something for Nothing,” which is like Radiohead’s “Planet Telex,” telexed. ¡Hay Tiempo!, in solitary majesty on disc three, isn’t quite the abrupt left turn the band would like it to be. Menswe@r singer Johnny Dean recently described ¡Hay Tiempo! as “a punk/indie band, suddenly making five-minute acid-tinged country-rock pieces.” But, as ever when a British band shoots for country, the results end up closer to the Rolling Stones’ rootsy dalliances than to country music itself, while the acidic touch of ¡Hay Tiempo! is more the citric suckle of home-pressed lemonade than a full-on psychedelic freak out. You can understand why a conservative record company got spooked. ¡Hay Tiempo! often feels like Menswe@r trying on other bands’ clothing, rather than finding themselves: “Lower Loveday” is Menswe@r does Spiritualized; “Holding Tight” is a second-hand Sweetheart of the Rodeo; “Shine” is Menswe@r on potent early Verve—and so on. It’s a rather faceless release for a band who once traded on image. But ¡Hay Tiempo!’s gilded grooves are far more listenable in 2020 than the band’s overly brittle debut album, thanks to some emotive songwriting (“Silver Tongue” especially) and reassuringly expensive production, including contributions from Pee Wee Ellis (once of James Brown’s band) and the High Llamas’ Sean O’Hagan. ¡Hay Tiempo! isn’t a lost classic, then, and The Menswe@r Collection won’t propel Menswe@r to the top—or even the top two—shelves of British indie rock. But it should help musical history look more kindly on a band whose vaguely androgynous charm and sharp edges have aged a lot better than the Oasis-lite and bedwetting indie that came along in Britpop’s wake to hold the UK charts in a relentlessly beige headlock.","This 4xCD retrospective of a group synonymous with Britpop’s worst excesses captures their pop peacocking and genuine charm, accompanied by a lingering feeling of trying too hard.

Every Mouth Teeth Missing,Call Super,by: Andy Beta,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f91975e362a0a17e78b7cd8/1:1/w_160/Every%20Mouth%20Teeth%20Missing_Call%20Super%20.jpg,2020-10-26 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/call-super-every-mouth-teeth-missing/,Incienso,"For fans mapping the output British-born, Berlin-based producer Joe Seaton, his Call Super handle was slotted for his pummeling house and techno output, while the Ondo Fudd alias was reserved for his weirder excursions into electro or ambient. But the club-ready Eyes Glide Through The Oxide 2x12"" from last year as Ondo Fudd found that legend now inverted, his Call Super releases now more on the low-key end of the spectrum. His third album (and first for Anthony Naples’ Incienso label), Every Mouth Teeth Missing continues along a trajectory first laid out in a Red Bull Music Academy chat where Seaton envisioned “making stuff that is less to do with clubs” and it feels more casual, introverted, and low-stakes than previous efforts. Truth in advertising, “An Unstable Music” opens with a jumble of disconnected sounds that jostle around with no attempt at coherence: distorted guitar, jackhammering noise, hushed piano, ponging electronics, and a sound like rummaging through a drawer of costume jewelry. Even when the sound palette is more coherent, a sense of restless skittering remains. The title track builds its rhythmic foundation from ever-shifting, rather dissimilar, elements: closed hi-hats, squelching electronics, crisp snares, a shutting door, chimes, distant rustling. The rhythm never quite coheres into something sure-footed or tactile, but something slippery as quicksilver, the commingled sounds closer to a mosaic, disparate yet all of a piece. Zooming in, the craftsmanship is nuanced and highly detailed, but when you pull back, some of Missing’s tracks flow by without commanding too much attention or notice. On 2017’s Arpo, Seaton was already favoring twinkling sounds over bombast, drums that sound the size of contact lenses rather than oil barrels. But on Missing, he retreads similar ground to diminishing returns. His father, painter and Dixieland player David Seaton, again contributes clarinet and oboe. These woodwinds have become an earmark of many of Seaton’s productions –either as Call Super, Ondo Fudd, or in collaboration with Beatrice Dillon– the clarinet making a track like “Pay As U Glow” feel whimsical and light. But charming as it is to have father and son collaborating in the studio, it’s become such a common feature of his tracks that one wonders about Seaton casting a slightly larger net. What would Call Super’s circuitry sound like in dialogue with cello, harp, or saxophone (as when Joy Orbison grappled with reedman Ben Vince on a Hessle Audio 12"")? A glimpse of dramatic strings comes in on “Mouth Bank Bed,” a track that finds Call Super turning over new stones and taking a few risks. A garbled, disjointed voice emerges and recedes, with bits of electronics slithering around the edges. If Robert Ashley’s Automatic Writing was just two minutes long, it might sound something like this. “Sleep All Night With Open Eye” draws from a similar sonic palette, the mood tipping towards the brooding and anxious, full of fidgeting little sounds. Even with the appearance of handclaps, they feel less celebratory and more like nervously picking at your cuticles. For as often as Missing teems with a dizzying array of little glints of sound, the most effective track is also the simplest. “Welcome New People” is centered by little more than a slow arpeggiation lazily rising and falling, with flickering, ghostly chords hovering around the edges. There’s no obvious peak to it, no discernible melodic figure, but Seaton gives its atmosphere just enough of a charge. At a time when there’s no hope of safely entering into a claustrophobic, stale-air warehouse space, it makes sense that Seaton instead crafted something strange and insular, with nothing whatsoever to do with the clubs.","On his third album as Call Super, Joe Seaton’s compositions feel more casual, introverted, and low-stakes than previous efforts.

Visions of Bodies Being Burned,clipping.,by: Stephen Kearse,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f90520ee5d11d82fc5b5a1a/1:1/w_160/visions%20of%20bodies%20being%20burned_clipping.jpg,2020-10-26 05:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/clipping-visions-of-bodies-being-burned/,Sub Pop,"Do you like scary movies? clipping. likes them so much that while recording 2019’s There Existed an Addiction to Blood, the group amassed enough songs to fill a second album. Built from the same blueprint of bristly noise and gory horrorcore rap, Visions of Bodies Being Burned continues where its predecessor left off, again indulging the trio’s love of horror. The sequel suffers from the same dryness as its predecessor, but clipping.’s collages remain richly textured and packed with slick allusions to film, rap, and politics. The album’s title is lifted from “Mind Playing Tricks on Me,” expanding Scarface’s anguished recap of a nightmare—“candlesticks in the dark, visions of bodies being burned”—into a cinematic universe of horrors. Single “Say the Name” uses the line as the centerpiece for a house ode to Candyman, rapper Daveed Diggs’ voice screwing into a demonic growl as dark synths strobe in the background. “’96 Neve Campbell” reimagines the Scream star as a slasher’s worst nightmare, guests Cam & China the foils to Billy and Stu. clipping. digs through the rap and horror archives with unrestrained delight. Diggs is especially giddy. “Say the Name” nods to “What Da Hook Gon Be,” “Shimmy Shimmy Ya,” and “Still Not a Player,” songs only a fan could link. “Check the Lock” nods to “Sleepin’ in My Nikes” by late Oakland rapper Seagram; the apocalyptica of “Something Underneath” channels sci-fi author N.K. Jemisin’s The Fifth Season and shouts out OutKast’s “Hey Ya.” Diggs isn’t as enamored with his influences as, say, JPEGMAFIA, but he’s clearly having fun. The album falters when these hints of personality get snuffed out. Though Diggs is an animated performer, he isn’t a strong orator; his verses lose color when he raps in triple-time, which is his go-to mode when producers Jonathan Snipes and William Hutson dial up the intensity. That detachment is intentional, of course. One of clipping.’s foundational rules is the avoidance of first-person perspectives, a restriction they believe frees them from authenticity. “Our beats are more aggressive and scarier than Daveed’s actual personality,” Hutson has said. “And the way that the band works, we couldn’t have him pretending to be someone he’s not.” Sure. But third-person perspectives are not inherently impersonal and distant. DOOM’s whole career is rapped in third-person. Open Mike Eagle has rapped from the perspective of a building and community. Aesop Rock has used a dog and a gopher as muses. clipping.’s self-erasure rubs up against the self-indulgence of their project. Though there’s plenty of stagecraft to their compositions—the echoing jungle breaks and EFX on “Pain Everyday”;  the scratchy percussion and whispers of harp on “Eaten Alive”; the “200 years of rust” on a witch’s gate on “She Bad”—no matter how much detail Diggs, Hutson, Snipes pour into their elaborate hellscapes, their frights feel vacant. There’s plenty of mood to clipping.’s horrorcore, but no theater, no ham, no cheese. Acts like Geto Boys, Gravediggaz, Three 6 Mafia, Kool Keith, and Eminem paired the occult with sex jokes, action sequences, and boasts. Visions of Bodies Being Burned, like There Existed an Addiction to Blood, is a clear homage to the horrorcore canon, so it’s necessarily a pastiche. But it’s disappointing how academic the record’s sense of terror is. Horrorcore isn’t some ancestral custom lost to history. It flows through the bully raps of 21 Savage and ShooterGang Kony; the crime sagas of Maxo Kream; the cartoonish villainy of Sada Baby; Ronny J’s caustic low-ends. clipping. never present themselves as resurrectors of horrorcore, and Visions’ songs are livelier than those on TEEATB, but the way the group embraces the style feels archaeological. Put differently: What would Vision of Bodies Being Burned sound like if clipping. made scary movies rather than just liked them?","The sequel to There Existed an Addiction to Blood extends the trio’s bristly noise and gory horrorcore rap with a sense of terror that’s more academic than frightening.

Songs the Lord Taught Us,The Cramps,by: Anna Gaca,Associate Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f8daba106efd255af1f00d8/1:1/w_160/songs%20the%20lord%20taught%20us_the%20cramps.jpg,2020-10-25 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/the-cramps-songs-the-lord-taught-us/,IRS,"Even the Cramps’ covers were original. In August 1980, in a performance filmed at the Santa Monica Civic Auditorium for the documentary Urgh! A Music War, they played “Tear It Up,” a cover and a classic from their recent debut, Songs the Lord Taught Us. The first “Tear It Up” is a twangy staple of Memphis rockabilly, recorded by Johnny Burnette and his Rock’n Roll Trio in 1956. The Cramps’ version comes from a different planet: It’s loud, fast, raw, so distorted as to be almost psychedelic. There’s no bass, but it feels like there is. Six-and-a-half feet tall in heels, Lux Interior looms over the crowd, twitching and thrashing. He doesn’t sing so much as shriek, leaning on the original lyric—“C’mon little baby, let’s tear the dancefloor up”—until it becomes “let’s tear this damn place up.” Poison Ivy Rorschach stands stage left, mirthless, possibly chewing gum, and bends the central guitar riff through the song’s moods: fast to start, slower, fast again, then slower still as Lux sucks the head of the microphone into his mouth, gasping rhythmically and sliding his hands over his latexed crotch. Normal people can’t do this; couldn’t make it look hot; are too chickenshit to try. If you can, well, welcome to the Cramps: They made sexy music for people who didn’t buy mainstream sex appeal, peering back at ’50s rockabilly and R&B through a big, dirty punk magnifying glass. Even Ivy’s name for the band has a sneer to it, a whiff of “female trouble,” sexual frustration, and constraint. She and Lux were obsessed with early rock’n’roll and all the contemporaneous artifacts of lowbrow culture: B-movie sexpoloitation flicks, serial killers, pin-up girls, the type of comic books that represent a contributing factor to juvenile delinquency. The things they left to the imagination—werewolves, UFOs, man-sized insects—were more fantastic still. And like John Waters or the Rocky Horror Picture Show, the Cramps attracted a cult following. Their work, Lux once said, was “a rallying point for certain kinds of people to come together and for certain kinds of people to stay out.” Songs the Lord Taught Us is the point of no return: the foundational document of psychobilly, a loud, theatrical, noticeably unpolished album with the tongue-in-cheek sense of the macabre that became the band’s signature. There were always four members of the Cramps, but Lux and Ivy’s bond made everything possible. The couple met in California, where a young Erick Purkhiser claimed he’d picked up Kristy Wallace hitchhiking. They hit on a shared love of the New York Dolls, moved in together, and started collecting records, combing junk stores for ’50s doo-wop, R&B, and the sped-up, country-fried sound of white Southern rockabilly bands. “I’ve just always liked obscure things, strange names—and once I found rockabilly I just couldn’t listen to anything else,” Lux told NME. To Lux and Ivy, early rock’n’roll held mystic power. It was visceral, erotic, almost transcendental. “Rockabilly should have inspired something to happen that was so great, so passionate, so sexual that it should have taken us to another place,” argued Lux. That it had instead faded out, been rendered obsolete by the likes of Pink Floyd and the Eagles, seemed unjustifiable. Lux could sing deep and smooth, garnering comparisons to the similarly shirtless Iggy Pop, but he studied the judders and hiccups of ’50s singers like Carl Perkins, who wrote “Blue Suede Shoes,” and Charlie Feathers, who wrote “Can’t Hardly Stand It,” another song the Cramps would claim for their own. On Songs the Lord Taught Us, he’s wired and fried, hoodling and howling his way through come-ons that sound like threats. “I use your eyeballs for dials on my TV set,” he smirks on the opener, one of the album’s actual originals. Ivy, a self-taught guitarist, modeled her playing on rockabilly icons Link Wray and Duane Eddy, but her tastes ran deeper. “What I think of as the really raunchy rockabilly most people didn’t hear,” she explained to the Los Angeles Times. “It was underground music. The real wild stuff was either obscene or messy-sounding. I mean it’s beautiful, but I don’t see how anyone could have heard it unless they were in the town where that record came out or where that nut lived. The real filth, that’s what we listen to.” For Lux and Ivy, rock’n’roll peaked at the moment when the word itself connoted sex, vulgarity, and moral panic. They wanted the Cramps’ blend of rockabilly, garage rock, and blues to inspire the same, and they hit on “psychobilly,” the word Johnny Cash used to describe a crazy-looking mismatched Cadillac on 1976’s “One Piece at a Time.” It was intended as a slogan, not the genre tag it became; as Ivy would point out, “There’s nothing new about combining horror with rockabilly.” Much like the Cramps, early rock’n’rollers gobbled up the babes-and-monsters aesthetic, and for every famous song, like Link Wray’s “The Shadow Knows” or Bobby Pickett’s “Monster Mash,” there were dozens more obscure: Terry Teene’s bone-chilling rendition of “Curse of the Hearse” (B-side: “Pussy Galore”), or Ronnie Cook’s flesh-eating fantasy “The Goo Goo Muck”—better known for a Cramps cover that swaps out the words “looking for a head” in favor of “looking for some head.” Not that the sexual possibilities were a big leap, exactly. “I think that all rockabilly was psychobilly anyway,” surmised Ivy. The salacious content and crude production of their favorite music convinced Lux and Ivy they could play it, too. The couple were living in Lux’s home state of Ohio when they read about CBGB in a rock magazine and figured they’d found their calling. They moved to New York and started rehearsing cover songs, classics and deep cuts, in the basement of a record store on Manhattan’s Upper East Side, where Lux recruited his coworker Bryan Gregory as second guitarist. Gregory had never played in a band before, but his gaunt, skull-like visage ensured he looked the part. “Lux sent me an autographed photo of the Cramps—just the three of them—before there actually even was a band,” remembered record producer Miriam Linna, who briefly served as their drummer before she was replaced by Nick Knox of Cleveland protopunks electric eels. The Cramps arrived later to the scene than the more famous Ramones and Talking Heads, and New York’s rock cognoscenti viewed them with skepticism more appropriate to a weirdo novelty act with a hillbilly fetish. The band happily returned the favor: In their opinion, rockabilly was misunderstood and under-appreciated, and so, by extension, were they. In any case, after a few years of gigging, they still couldn’t seem to land a record deal. One of the few people to take an interest was power-pop icon Alex Chilton, recently of Big Star, who invited the band to his hometown of Memphis to record. Chilton was more familiar with the Cramps’ tastes and, crucially, less interested in influencing them. When the band returned from its first UK tour with an album deal backed by Police manager Miles Copeland’s Illegal Records, they enlisted Chilton as producer and headed to the studio of Memphis’ legendary Sun Records. The album sessions were difficult. “We didn’t get any respect by the studio. They’d look at us like we weren’t a serious recording act,” Ivy complained. “The mixing was a problem too ’cos we couldn’t get any engineers that could stand to listen to this music. They’d sit there and say ‘How can you listen to this distortion all day?’ And any time Alex wanted to put his hands on the board to move the faders, it was ‘How dare you?’” In defense of Sun’s engineers, Chilton often appeared intoxicated, demanding multiple retakes and agonizing over the mixes for months after. Meanwhile, Bryan Gregory was growing increasingly dissatisfied with his bandmates and struggling with a heroin addiction; he’d soon vanish from their California tour. In the end, the Cramps were unhappy with some of Chilton’s track selections, and Ivy pronounced the final mixes “too muddy,” though even she had to admit that “it definitely had a creepy atmosphere, and that has a certain kind of appeal to it.” The night before the album was set to be mastered, Chilton called up and suggested they re-record the whole thing; Lux and Ivy turned him down. The Cramps’ music was familiar, elemental: Nick’s pounding toms, Bryan’s bleating rhythm guitar, Ivy’s prickly rockabilly attack, Lux’s impassioned moan. Their references were clear on purpose, a breadcrumb trail for fellow record fanatics to follow: “The Mad Daddy” (a tribute to Lux’s childhood hero, madcap Cleveland radio jockey Pete “Mad Daddy” Myers) was reminscent of their cover of “Surfin’ Bird,” the unhinged garage-rock classic by the Trashmen, who nicked it from doo-wop quartet the Rivingtons, whom the Cramps also covered. Even the band’s new compositions often adapted a lyric or a saxophone part from a film or a classic 45 record—sometimes three or four at a time. Yet to critics, Songs the Lord Taught Us sounded like nothing else. “It unleashes a noise so loud, so uncontrolled, so jittering and shivering with the nightmares of a thousand-and-one restless nights, that one may be moved to run in panic, switch on the lights, and cower in the nearest closet,” wrote Robot A. Hull for Creem. “These guys play all this trash so deadpan you feel like an anthropologist who’s found an otherworldly culture that’s been developing rock & roll along parallel musical lines but utterly divergent social ones,” quipped Dave Marsh in Rolling Stone. There are more covers on Songs: Jimmy Stewart’s “Rock on the Moon,” Dwight Pullen’s “Sunglasses After Dark,” the Sonics’ “Strychnine,” Little Willie John’s “Fever,” and a generous quote of Dale Hawkins’ “Tornado” on “What’s Behind the Mask?”—but the other best parts of the Cramps were made-up. “I was a teenage werewolf/Braces on my fangs,” shudders Lux in the opening lines of “I Was a Teenage Werewolf,” reveling in the tawdry, self-evidently ridiculous premise of a 1957 B-movie horror film. Ivy’s surfy melody is sharp enough to sting; Gregory’s second guitar buzzes like a downed wire. The whole band kicks up at the bridge, growling and Link-Wray-rumbling through a distorted blues that’s almost loud enough to conceal the howls. As in the movie, the lupine affliction is a simple metaphor for puberty, but the message arrives with real outsider pathos—which Lux, then in his mid-30s, still plays up for maximum outrageousness: “All my teachers thought/It was growing pain, oh no no/Somebody stop this pain!” On the frantic highlight “Zombie Dance,” Lux’s arch, clipped vocal sounds a little like David Byrne (the latter co-wrote “Psycho Killer,” the former wrote John Wayne Gacy directly). A song called “Zombie Dance” feels like a gag, same as the “Monster Mash,” and it is, except zombies can’t dance: “They do the swim face-down/Down at the zombie pool!” But Cramps songs are hardly ever just jokes, and these stiff-bodied buzzkills aren’t just a send-up of humorless New York hipsters either. Consider another pun, the one that sounds oddly like a moral judgement: “The kind of life they choose/Ain’t life at all.” It’s language more often used to condemn drug fiends or sexual deviants; here in Zombieland, the Cramps flip it on its head. The zombie dance is the whole wide straight world, the uptight moralizers who don’t know how to let loose, the tragedy of a life lived like you’re already undead. With the Cramps, it’s less about the shock value than the thrill of discovery, less about the pruriency of the interests than the joy of pursuing them. It’s all there in “Garbageman,” the album’s rudest and sludgiest song and maybe its best. With the sly, bluesy innuendo of Muddy Waters’ “Garbage Man,” a shout-out to “Louie Louie,” and a gnarly sounding toilet flush, the Cramps simultaneously declare allegiance to rock’n’roll and lay out a manifesto for mutant music. “Do you want the real thing or are you just talkin’?” Lux jeers. Against two grinding guitars and Nick Knox’s relentless pounding, his breathless, fourth-wall-breaking verse captures the heart of its own appeal: Yeah, it’s just what you need
When you’re down in the dumps
One half hillbilly
And one half punk
Eight long legs and one big mouth
The hottest thing from the North
To come out of the South
Do you understand? Do you understand? Garbage is the best stuff we’ve got. “To us it isn’t garbage,” Lux would insist. “To us it’s the center of what life’s all about.” By now, the Cramps’ take on vintage rock’n’roll is vintage in its own right, but it’s still electrifying, still outré, still underground. It’s the reason their legacy lives in both directions: backwards with the shine they brought to obscure ’50s artists collected on fan compilations like Songs the Cramps Taught Us, and forwards in the prolific career of Bryan Gregory’s eventual replacement Kid Congo Powers and the many psychobilly-styled bands in the U.S., Britain, and all around the world, particularly Mexico and Latin America. Their influence feels present, too, in other power duos whose music only touches on psychobilly yet still hits the same notes: the Raveonettes’ rainy, reverb-slicked bubblegum; the White Stripes’ professionally refurbished, bass-less electric blues; Quintron and Miss Pussycat’s wild-eyed swamp kitsch. The most important thing about the Cramps: They didn’t play the sideshow. When Songs the Lord Taught Us is campy, exaggerated, and lewd, it’s in the spirit of carnival, the realm of real freaks. It’s a perfect album for Halloween, but it’s true all year: You can gather up the detritus of this rotten culture and invert it, turn it into something that’s both endlessly familiar and terrifyingly new.

Cuttin’ Grass Vol. 1: The Butcher Shoppe Sessions,Sturgill Simpson,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f8da936e6fc05c7f21c73ca/1:1/w_160/cuttin%20grass%20vol%201_sturgill%20simpson.jpg,2020-10-24 05:00:00,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/sturgill-simpson-cuttin-grass-vol-1-the-butcher-shoppe-sessions/,High Top MountainThirty Tigers,"Back in June 2020, Sturgill Simpson confessed his bluegrass dreams to an empty Ryman Auditorium. “I decided after climbing the ropes of country-music stardom and then completely destroying that career to make a rock’n’roll record. Now I have great ambitions of a life of gravel parking lots and Porta Potties,” he joked during the livestream concert, flanked by a small band featuring some of the greatest talents in bluegrass. His jab was affectionate: Simpson says he was a fan long before he moved to Nashville and became one of the biggest country stars ever to insist that he wasn’t really country. His new album Cuttin’ Grass Vol. 1: The Butcher Shoppe Sessions, a collection of bluegrass versions of songs from Simpson’s own back catalog, grew out of a fundraising challenge with his fans, but you get the sense Simpson eventually would have gotten around to recording a bluegrass record anyway, if only because the genre’s emphasis on acoustic instrumentation and technical chops flies in the face of what many perceive to be Nashville’s reliance on slick production and cookie-cutter stars—qualities that, fairly or not, he has repeatedly lambasted. In that Ryman Auditorium livestream, Simpson stressed the influence of bluegrass on his own playing and songwriting. Whether he was revving them up for his early punk-country group Sunday Valley or exploding them on Metamodern Sounds in Country Music, Simpson was heavily influenced by the rhythms, melodies, and sentiments of the Stanley Brothers, Bill Monroe, and others. But he’s also a master of concision, often refusing to repeat some of his catchiest passages and typically eschewing the verse-chorus-verse format. There’s a military precision to his songs—fitting for a guy who spent three years in the Navy and then used that experience as the thematic foundation for his breakout album, 2016’s A Sailor’s Guide to Earth. So his tunes slide easily into bluegrass, a style that prizes individual precision within a larger group dynamic. Simpson has recruited a band of barnstormers for Cuttin’ Grass, which he recorded at the Butcher Shoppe Recording Studio with friend and producer David Ferguson. Almost every player on the album was up onstage at his Opry and Ryman shows, and they’re all among the best at their respective instruments. Guitarists Tim O’Brien and Mark Howard toggle fluidly between lead and rhythm to ensure everything moves at a steady clip. Banjo player Scott Vestal and fiddler Stuart Duncan treat “All the Pretty Colors” like a Cubist canvas, finding new angles in the central melody and slyly reinterpreting Simpson’s metaphor about heartache washing all the color out of his world. If anyone dominates these arrangements, it might be Sierra Hull, a mandolin prodigy whose picking is as sensitive as her backing vocals, especially on a tender, soulful version of “Breaker’s Roar”—arguably the most transformed song on the album. The best bluegrass players balance blazing technique with close attention to the song and deep knowledge of the canon. Even when the picking is deft, it’s rarely showy; instead, there’s a modest ostentation to Cuttin’ Grass, which simultaneously plays up the cosmic quality of Simpson’s songwriting but also grounds it in earthy arrangements. Dreams are constantly intruding on reality in his songs; God infuses everything, light constantly battles darkness, and death just takes us to another plane. “Gonna transmigrate to my destination far beyond time in an eternal dream,” he sings on “Just Let Go,” right before the band joins him on the chorus: “Am I dreaming or am I dying?” It’s a murder ballad where the ego gets the knife. Cuttin’ Grass at times plays like a covers album, with the artist and the subject both the same, but overall it’s a de facto greatest hits, surveying nearly the full breadth of Simpson’s career. Granted, his success should have put the lie to “Life Ain’t Fair and the World Is Mean,” which sounds like sour grapes from an artist who can convince a major label to fund the anime film that accompanied his lackluster 2019 rock’n’roll record SOUND & FURY. Otherwise, his choices are compelling, especially the three songs from Sunday Valley, which only released one album and one EP before Simpson went solo. He and his bluegrass band transform them from rowdy, rusty alt-country numbers into this collection’s biggest revelations. The best of the lot, “I Don’t Mind,” takes the conventions of country music and subtly inverts them. Against Miles Miller’s two-step drum pattern, he describes heartache as an existential conundrum, striking a bittersweet balance between defeat and desire. “If you think you can ever love me again, please go ahead, I don’t mind,” he sings, as the players offer their consolations. The appeal of Cuttin’ Grass goes beyond the novelty of hearing familiar songs in a new setting. This isn’t Pickin’ On Sturgill Simpson. Rather, these performances emphasize the cosmic and the sentimental in Simpson’s catalog. What’s missing, however, is the sense of possibility that defines his other albums, even the lackluster SOUND & FURY. As a country artist, Simpson is determinedly subversive; as a bluegrass artist, he’s incredibly conservative. There are none of the abrupt stylistic changes that made Sailor’s Guide sound as big as the world and none of the sonic experiments that made Metamodern Sounds such a trip. Simpson can’t quite sustain a double album in this style, and Cuttin’ Grass loses some steam toward the end. However, there are more than enough bracing moments here to make you wonder what Volume 2 will sound like, especially if it’s all those ’80s covers he promised his wife.","Accompanied by some of the best players in the scene, the country maverick performs bluegrass versions of highlights from his back catalog, revealing the hidden roots of his idiosyncratic songwriting.

Floral Prince,Field Medic,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f8da2c306efd255af1f00d4/1:1/w_160/floral%20prince_field%20medic.jpg,2020-10-24 05:00:00,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/field-medic-floral-prince/,Run for Cover,"About three months ago, Kevin Patrick Sullivan posted two songs to SoundCloud under the name Paper Rose Haiku—a Kratom-influenced alter ego that he described as “a cowboy [crying] through AutoTune over a trap beat.” Newly sober, Sullivan considers Paper Rose Haiku an anomaly, a demon that emerged during an unfortunate relapse, existing only to be exorcised. In truth, it’s more of an inversion of what he’s been doing for years under his more well-known moniker of Field Medic. Frequently shirtless, flamboyantly mulleted, and aligned with emo-rappers like Bladee and Wicca Phase Springs Eternal, Sullivan often sings of the acute sadness that follows when pills and sex fail to keep his baseline sadness at bay. He just does these things in an astringent, high-lonesome wail over fingerpicked, open-tuned acoustics, captured on hissing 4-tracks—a clash of both the authenticities and affectations of purist folk and SoundCloud rap. Floral Prince is the first Field Medic release Sullivan attributes to the “full-time freestyle” approach encouraged by his therapist—and like Paper Rose Haiku, “full-time freestyle” isn’t so much of a break with his past, just a cooler way to describe what he’s been doing all along. A patchwork of unreleased material, previously available singles, and his YouTube “field medic show,” Floral Prince is functionally similar to 2017’s Songs From the Sunroom, a compilation that marked his signing to Run For Cover and included self-explanatory songs like “do a little dope (live)” and “fuck these foolz that are making valencia street unchill.” Despite Sullivan wanting to sidestep the pressure of making the follow-up to his proper debut, 2019’s fade into the dawn, Floral Prince isn’t noticeably different in its content or fidelity. Horns seep into the mix of opener “-h-o-u-s-e-k-e-y-z-” like ink into water, maintaining fade into the dawn’s pleasing mix of orchestral frill and lo-fi ingenuity, while the live percussion of “HEADCASE” is produced to sound like the drum machine pitter-pat of “henna tattoo.” Floral Prince’s immediacy comes from a nexus of improvisation and strict ground rules—minimal rewrites, recorded to 4-track or a phone, usually with a limit of three takes. But Sullivan’s too much of a formalist for Floral Prince to ever go fully “based.” The songs that would seem like the result of his first-thought best-thought policy—i.e., the ones where he talks in very plain terms about his bodily functions, drinking habits, and sex life—are the ones where Sullivan’s writing fits into more of a structural grid. “i want you so bad it hurts” and “it’s so lonely being sober” might be litmus tests for new listeners, even though “I even started doing pushups/And my dick’s harder than ever” is the sort of unvarnished truth that should be heard more often if earnest folk music is meant to be a quotidian artform. And yet, if Floral Prince has any flaw, it’s that reducing the overall “field medic show” to a collection of songs inherently restricts Sullivan’s personality from fully coming across. About half of the album consists of gorgeous, off-the-cuff strummers that feature Sullivan’s most poetic writing; they’re also the songs that sound like they could be written by other people. Conversely, “talkin johnny and june (your arms around me)” deftly holds space for Field Medic’s tendencies towards twee and debauchery, a rare instance of a song that taps into Johnny Cash’s life story without resorting to hagiography or caricature. “it’s so lonely being sober” likewise reflects on the assumptions that arise when hard-living artists write about getting clean. People usually expect a newfound clarity and gratitude, not the self-pity that arises when the inspiration doesn’t come immediately and your friends are still out partying because they’re on the same timeline. Immediately after, “better way” makes the case that he’s moved onto accepting whatever comes next; it feels just as real despite its more universal lyricism, as the best Field Medic songs strive to live in the present, rather than trying to build a universe. “We do whatever we want because we have nothing better to do,” Sullivan jokes to Great Grandpa’s Alex Menne (credited as Pickleboy) before debuting “talkin johnny and june (your arms around me)” on the “field medic show.” As with Songs from the Sunroom and fade into the dawn, Floral Prince doesn’t question whether Field Medic can be done justice by the album format, just whether he needs to in the first place.","Kevin Patrick Sullivan’s latest is a patchwork of new and old material with some gorgeously off-the-cuff strummers and unvarnished folk songs that start to detail his curious shape as a singer-songwriter.

songs / instrumentals,Adrianne Lenker,by: Philip Sherburne,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f889e01b1e2d332600bed46/1:1/w_160/songs_adrianne%20lenker.jpg,2020-10-23 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/adrianne-lenker-songs-and-instrumentals/,4AD,"When Big Thief pick up their instruments, they like to face inward, standing in a circle. That is how they rehearse, and how they have recorded all of their albums: eye to eye and practically elbow to elbow. Even when they perform, they face each other as much as possible. Much has been said of Big Thief as a family, an organism, a self-sustaining ecosystem. But what happens when the circle narrows to a single point? On the two-part songs and instrumentals—billed as a pair of standalone albums but really two inextricable parts of a whole—Adrianne Lenker, the group’s singer and emotional fulcrum, stands alone, a solitary figure learning to shoulder a burden of fresh absence. Here, inside a “circle of pine and red oak/Circle of moss and fire smoke,” she strips her music down to just an acoustic guitar and voice with minimal overdubs, all recorded straight to tape. She wrote nine of the first half’s 11 songs right there on the spot. The second half is purely instrumental; the final side is mostly windchimes. Lenker made the record in a one-room cabin in the woods of Western Massachusetts where she holed up in spring, waiting out the early days of the pandemic and reeling from a broken heart. The simple pinewood planks of the shack’s interior reminded her, she said, of “the inside of an acoustic guitar,” which is to say it felt like home. Her friend Philip Weinrobe, a recording engineer, was summoned with a truckload of gear: half-inch tape machines, XLR cables, a binaural mic. They spent a couple weeks setting up and another three weeks recording, and the sense of presence they captured—in two cases, recording directly to Weinrobe’s Walkman—is almost overwhelming. The guitar sounds so close that you can hear the ridges of Lenker’s fingertips rubbing against coiled steel. Occasionally, her chair creaks or her foot brushes against the floor. Some songs wear a halo of birdsong or rainfall. Fragments from the sessions—orphaned chords strummed in the silence before a take begins, the thunk of what might be fingers pressing down on the keys of the tape machine—litter the final mixdown like leaves strewn across the cabin floor. Given its modest origins, this album could have been just a detour. (“I really admire Joni Mitchell, Neil Young, Leonard Cohen—how they have such a breadth of material throughout the years, into old age,” Lenker told The Ringer last year. “They seemed to follow their own thread of curiosity and creativity, even through some weird phases when people were like, ‘I don’t know what they’re doing.’”) Instead, it sounds like the essence of her music distilled, steeped in grief. In addition to the pain of Lenker’s own breakup, Weinrobe’s grandmother was dying; he was saying his farewells to her over Zoom. Big Thief’s tour had been cut short by the pandemic. And no matter how far you went into the woods, there was no ignoring the ambient ache in the nation’s bones, all that death and neglect and malevolence. Colored by all these overlapping shades of pain, songs and instrumentals are about leave-taking, solitude, and self-reliance; about memory, longing, and regret; about the “mystery of lack.” None of these are new themes for Lenker, but she has never explored them quite like this. Where Two Hands looked outward, songs tends to dwell in the space between Lenker and her absent lover. She begins the album with a plea: “Lay me down so to let you leave/Tell me lies/Wanna see your eyes/Is it a crime to say I still need you?” This naked second-person form of address is all over these songs, like “I’m not afraid of you now” and “You are changing me/You are changing.” They sound like private thoughts tested on the tongue, the sorts of solitary ruminations shared with the four walls of an empty space—the room tone of loss. It is an invitation to move through pain, to disappear into sound alongside her. Some of these songs are as lovely as any Lenker has ever written: lush and verdant, chords fanning out like ferns, their major-key tonalities at odds with the heartbreak at the album’s core. On “anything,” she trades the cosmic sweep of U.F.O.F. for the microscopic detail of a moment of stillness: “I wanna listen to the sound of you blinking.” The wounds of her breakup are still raw, peppered with the buckshot of memory. She sketches the arc of a doomed affair in a series of disconnected images: wet skin and dripping mango, a Christmas Eve argument, dog’s teeth biting through flesh, “unchecked calls and messages.” But the chorus is sweet and unburdened, and toward the song’s end, Lenker lets out a soft little “Whoo!” as though carried away by the music. It’s a remarkable moment: In the midst of an unshakable sadness, the beauty of this thing she has created elicits a whoop of joy, a tiny fist pump of affirmation. Solace arrives in the form of a momentary adrenaline rush. Lenker’s writing has never been as vivid as it is here. In “ingydar,” she sings of a horse lying naked in the barn while flies “draw sugar from its head,” her voice tumbling over itself in a rush of sticky-sweet detail. It is an image of decrepitude so richly rendered that, rather than suggesting decay, the impression is one of extraordinary fullness, like a meadow exploding into bloom: His eyes are blueberries, video screens,
Minneapolis schemes and the dried flowers
From books half-read
The juice of dark cherries cover his chin
The dog walks in and the crow lies in his
Jaw like lead
Everything eats and is eaten
Time is fed Throughout songs, life and death are locked in an embrace, as opposites collide and subsume one another. Violence is never far from the life force. Several times she sings, ambiguously, of motherhood. Her partner’s “dearest fantasy/Is to grow a baby in me.” Yet in “ingydar,” as she picks her way carefully over the bright-red carcass of memory, she pauses and sighs, “Six years in, no baby.” In the almost unbearably beautiful “not a lot, just forever,” she sings, “I want to be your wife/So I hold you to my knife,” her voice growing thin like the air leaving a body. Her voice becomes even more diaphanous in “half return,” which seems to be a story about revisiting her childhood home. Images drift across the listener’s vision, unmoored from their origins, until she arrives at the chorus: “Standing in the yard/Dressed like a kid/The house is white and/The lawn is dead the lawn is dead the lawn is dead.” The sing-song melody and repeated words sound almost like a playground chant; the way she sings, “The lawn is dead”—her voice multiplied on the tape, harmonies rippling like cirrus clouds above the broad, flat Midwestern landscape—it sounds almost ecstatic. Unlike the A-side, the B-side is devoid of overdubs, giving the songs a more intimate, stripped-down character. The crux of the record, “zombie girl,” begins as she awakens from a dream about her absent lover, but it turns into a conversation with absence itself. “Oh emptiness/Tell me ’bout your nature/Maybe I’ve been getting you wrong.” Her guitar sounds almost like a music box, and the recording is wreathed in chirps and chiming metal. “What’s on your mind?” she asks, repeatedly, and you can hear her gasp for air between the lines; the longer she holds each note, it is as though she were emptying out, becoming emptiness. As her voice trails off, a buzzing fly enters the frame, and the ambient sound swells to fill what is left. It is a song about emptiness but also fullness, about the way the self can disappear into what surrounds it. Lenker began and ended each day’s session with an extended improvisation on her guitar. A collage of these recordings comprises instrumentals’ two songs, “music for indigo” and “mostly chimes,” which together run more than 37 minutes. They are not showy pieces, but the depth of her relationship with her instrument is clear. Channeling folk and bluegrass, she mulls over series of notes, sounding out melodic ideas, nudging forward and then doubling back; it feels less like composing than dowsing, like she is responding to the smallest variations of the weight of the wood in her hands. “She gives a lot of significance to that moment where she’s holding her guitar,” Big Thief’s Max Oleartchik told the New Yorker. “I never really think of her, like, fucking around and playing riffs or something. It’s always this instrument of witchcraft. It’s always holy.” That glimmer of something sacred shines through here: Set against the sounds of nature, her playing has a devotional quality. Toward the end of “music for indigo”—composed, she says, as something for her ex-girlfriend to fall asleep to—she murmurs, “I’m starting over,” and it is unclear whether she is talking about the song, or her life. If “music for indigo” is spacious, “mostly chimes” is mostly just space. It begins with tentative playing, but after four minutes, her guitar gets quieter and quieter, and then drops off to silence. What is left is just the swirl of chimes and birdsong, 11 minutes of pure dreamspeak. That might seem inadvisably precious or indulgent, but Lenker’s atmospheric coda has a purpose: It completes the process of disappearing that has taken place across the course of the record. On side A, there may be as many as three guitar parts, plus overdubbed vocals, in play at any moment. Side B loses the overdubs but retains the vocals. Side C is just guitar and chimes. Side D, on the other hand, is just a suggestion of what will be left when Lenker packs up and leaves. It is the wind in the trees, the sun through the branches, the robin’s egg lying cracked and hollow on the ground, a half-moon of sky blue nestled against black loam. The barely-there conclusion of this remarkable pair of records is a memory frozen in tone, absence given form. “Oh, emptiness/Tell me ’bout your nature,” Lenker asks in “zombie girl.” Taken together, songs and instrumentals provide an answer.","Spread across two albums that function as one stunning piece of music, the Big Thief singer approaches familiar themes of loss, solitude, memory, and regret in some of the most vivid songwriting of her career.

2020,Magik Markers,by: Grayson Haver Currin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f8899a5b1ec0862a4bceb71/1:1/w_160/2020_magik%20markers.jpg,2020-10-23 05:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/magik-markers-2020/,Drag City,"Just after the start of this century, Magik Markers felt like a spectacular explosion that would soon burn through all available fuel. A noise-rock trio that earned the back half of that hyphenate chiefly by virtue of playing drums, guitars, and bass, the Markers were famously belligerent, ripping into audiences that appeared apathetic while ripping riffs and rhythms into shards. It was exhilarating and exhausting, the kind of spectacle that never seemed to account for sustainability. But for the last dozen years, the Markers—once maniacally prolific—have slowed their schedule and softened their attack, seesawing between the pastoral wallop of Crazy Horse and the fragmented beauty of Kim Gordon. Though most people continue to associate Magik Markers with that early racket, they’ve now been getting weird on the other side of the hyphenate for most of their career. If the nine-song 2020, the Markers’ first album in seven years, doesn’t finally recast their primordial reputation, it’s hard to imagine anything will. They mostly tuck the dissonance and bedlam beneath the surface of these tunes, like a weapon hidden between hem and skin. That restraint highlights the band’s surprising breadth on their most diverse set of songs yet. “That Dream (Shitty Beach)” is the kind of blast from the garage Ty Segall might howl; its chaser, “Born Dead,” is a tender Mellotron-and-guitar waltz detailing cosmic loneliness and salvation. The opener is a guitar anti-hero epic, its elliptical solo gathering direction and distortion across the song’s exhilarating second half. The finale, however, is a woozy pop lullaby for the dispossessed, like Julee Cruise coming back to earth. None of this is to say that Magik Markers now sound “normal.” In July, they released a four-track preamble to 2020, stretching Elisa Ambrogio’s spectral voice across smeared guitars and refracted meters. Those pieces felt wonderfully surreal, like hymns spirited from a distant galaxy. The centerpiece of 2020 is “Hymn for 2020,” an eerie collage of long phosphorescent tones, sporadic drum thuds, and vocals that conjure ghouls and angels. It’s like huddling inside a tornado shelter as a twister races by outside—a momentarily safe space, burdened by knowledge of what’s on the other side of the door. Ambrogio intones the brittle “CDROM,” a seven-minute tone poem about astrology, psychedelics, and extreme existential angst, with a coolness that suggests she’s succumbed to these worries. Her dazed voice and acidic guitar, along with Pete Nolan’s roiling drums, recall the dread that precedes a panic attack. But by and large, Magik Markers’ longtime touchstones, abrasion and arrhythmia, add depth to these songs without dominating them. “Born Dead” never gets too pretty or plain, since the country licks sometimes sour and Ambrogio occasionally loops her voice like she’s her own shadow. “That Dream (Shitty Beach)” might be the Markers’ most thundering rock song ever. It’s an open-road, windows-down jam in a very unexpected and literal sense—whipped by static and a sense of vertigo, the song sounds as if it were recorded in a convertible careening down the highway, wind lashing the microphones. “You Can Find Me” is a perfect power-pop song about adolescent frustration; you may wonder, though, if it were bashed out inside a crinkled aluminum can and captured with dying recording gear. Amid the lurid excess of their beginnings, Magik Markers bucked against any expectations they encountered, from songform to the understanding of where the stage ended and the crowd began. They punished their instruments as often as they played them and avoided any semblance of a straightforward catalogue by releasing whatever whenever. The thrills were sudden and pure. But it’s been even more satisfying to watch the Markers—partners, parents, adults with solo or side-projects and day-jobs—mature into a singular rock trio, funneling all their ire and wonder and doubt and humor into enduring songs. At its best, 2020 is as probing as those early paroxysms, asking similar questions with similar instruments in more developed ways. These songs plunder modern unease and desire, whether pining for deeper connections or wanting to escape an increasingly hostile planet. Against most odds, Magik Markers have become long-term reminders that settling down doesn’t mean settling, shutting, or stiffening up, even when you’re making less racket.","Once a famously fractious noise band, the trio continues its slow transformation into an unpredictable and surprisingly tender rock group.

"Anime, Trauma and Divorce",Open Mike Eagle,by: Matthew Ismael Ruiz,"Associate Staff Writer, News","https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f875532cd85cd1e18b56621/1:1/w_160/Anime,%20Trauma%20and%20Divorce_Open%20Mike%20Eagle.jpg",2020-10-23 05:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/open-mike-eagle-anime-trauma-and-divorce/,Autoreverse,"Open Mike Eagle has spent much of the last decade developing support networks that have enabled his modest success as an independent rapper. In 2019, it all fell apart. Hellfyre Club, the collaborative group featuring Eagle, Busdriver, milo, and Nocando, disintegrated amid business disputes. Comedy Central declined to renew The New Negroes, the show Eagle launched with comedian Baron Vaughn. And Eagle and his wife ended their marriage of 14 years, disrupting his identity as a husband and father. Eagle isn’t cagey about the inspiration for his latest LP Anime, Trauma, and Divorce—it’s right there in the title. Before Eagle’s traumatic 2019, he’d already planned an anime-focused LP that would explore the role of fictional power fantasies in the lives of marginalized people. His theory that Black people, inheritors of generational trauma, need anime the most, suggests its fanciful depictions of power and heroism provide an escape from Black America’s grim realities. After his own series of defeats, the theory became practice: he needed the escape, too. While his raps are often set in fantastical universes sprung from his imagination, the subject matter here is chillingly mundane and relatable. He finds himself single and middle-aged, questioning the fly “art rap” aesthetic he spent much of his adult life crafting, in a deteriorating dad bod that just doesn’t seem that funny anymore. Eagle’s fantasies are heavily influenced by two anime in particular: Neon Genesis Evangelion, a morose mecha-anime set in a post-apocalyptic society that forces trauma upon children in order to save the world, and JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure, a multi-generational saga featuring a fashion-forward family that uses super-powered manifestations of energy called Stands to fight evil beings. “I’m a Joestar (Black Power Fantasy)” posits Eagle as a member of the series’ aforementioned family, imagining his Stand with a “glow like Sho’nuff in The Last Dragon.” On “Headass (Idiot Shinji),” he identifies with Evangelion’s teen protagonist, whose epically awful timing often endangers humanity. “Sweatpants Spiderman” nods to the alternate-universe Peter Parker that mentors Miles Morales in Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse. That Spider-Man lost Mary Jane and fell into a depressive spiral, packing pizza slices onto his waistline and crying alone in the shower before being transported across the multiverse to teach Morales how to be Spider-Man. The song frankly assesses Eagle’s post-divorce status, re-evaluating his diet, art, and finances—and feeling every one of his 39 years. Eagle’s ability to twist his pain into knee-slapping jokes is remarkable. “I'm in a spa, got on a sweet robe, tryin’a hold onto a tree pose/It’s like seeing what my body needs, maybe that's a lot of weed,” he raps on “WTF is Self-Care,” a rundown of various wellness practices meant to cure depression. “Everything Ends Last Year,” the result of his therapist’s suggestion to “write your feelings,” is his summation of the no-good very bad year, neither fun nor funny, and absent of the verbal gymnastics of which he’s capable. Laid over a somber piano melody and a minimal orchestral arrangement, his words are sparse and concise. “It’s October and I’m tired,” he raps, one of the most relatable bars in rap history. With a few notable exceptions, the production on Anime, Trauma, and Divorce is more somber than angry, reflecting an overall sentiment of contrition rather than resentment. Executive producer Jacknife Lee assembled beats from the likes of Caleb Stone, Gold Panda, Black Milk, and Frank Leone that ooze moodiness, with prominent synth-bass melodies and laid-back tempos. It’s dark without being punishing, unafraid of naked self-reflection but devoid of self-pity. Eagle would be forgiven for retreating into lethargy after the year he had; instead, he made an album as bleak—and funny—as anything he’s ever done, digging deep into his sense of self with the same sardonic wit that made his breakout LP Dark Comedy so impressive. It helps that he’s not entirely alone. Alt Peter Parker found purpose counseling Miles Morales, teaching him how to use his powers and guiding him through the inevitable trauma of being a superhero. Eagle’s son Asa will undoubtedly need guidance of his own: someone to share the wisdom of their own mistakes, to lead him down a brighter path. And for the first time in his career, Eagle put him on a record, with features for Lil A$e on both “Asa’s Bop” and “Fifteen Twenty Feet Ocean Nah,” the album’s lo-fi live-recorded closer. On the latter, Asa joins his dad in a self-deprecating rap about a near-death snorkeling experience. It’s goofy, absurd, and might have been recorded with a cell phone mic. It also sounds like the most fun he’s had on record in years. ","On his bleakly comic new album, Open Mike Eagle surveys the damage of one terrible year, using anime mythology as a lens for examining real-life pain.

Sen Morimoto,Sen Morimoto,by: Steven Arroyo,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f889c13b1e2d332600bed43/1:1/w_160/sen%20morimoto_sen%20morimoto.jpg,2020-10-23 05:00:00,Jazz,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/sen-morimoto-sen-morimoto/,Sooper,"Sen Morimoto’s music is an open book. Diaristic, fragmented lyrics and layers upon layers of harmonies pile into his kinetic jazz rap. It’s a heavy book—an encyclopedia, probably. A jazz saxophonist since childhood, Morimoto gobbled up other instruments and disciplines along the way from his birthplace of Kyoto to small-town Massachusetts, where he grew up and began gravitating towards hip-hop, and then to his current home in Chicago. Or maybe it’s a phone book: In just the past couple of years, Morimoto has collaborated in an impressive range of circles, playing on albums by jazz ensemble Resavoir, pop singer KAINA, rappers Ric Wilson and Joseph Chilliams, and indie bands Lala Lala and Vagabon. In July, Morimoto took his openness to a new level. When the City of Chicago invited him to appear on the “Millennium Park at Home” virtual series, Morimoto took the chance to call out his mayor—and was promptly removed from the bill. “I would like to add my extreme disappointment in the lack of action that has been taken by Mayor Lightfoot and our elected officials here in response to over 100,000 protesters here in Chicago demanding the police be defunded and CPAC [the Civilian Police Accountability Council] be enacted,” he said in his submitted video. The city gave him a chance to recant; he declined, and his colleague Tasha followed him out the door. Disappointment permeates the lyrics of Morimoto’s self-titled second album, too. He imagines a future where everyone has left for Jupiter; he raps about being too tired to feign happiness and crying so loudly it upsets his dog. But you might not notice any of that, because musically, the dominant mood is blissful and relentlessly hyperactive—more suggestive of happy daydreams than the flat, grey slog of this year’s bad-news parade. The album’s sound is downright optimistic; if you knew nothing else of him, you might wonder if he has been living on Jupiter for the past several months. Morimoto turns his imagination loose, filling up a double album that bursts with vivid color and gnarly chord structures, as well as a laundry list of guest features—some of which serve his love of working with friends a little more than they serve the song. Where his debut album, Cannonball!, was built by subtraction (as he explained, he wrote by overcrowding his songs with parts, then stripping them away one by one), Sen Morimoto lets it all fly. Bigger drums and lavish beats take over for the less adorned boom-bap propulsion of his last effort, and songs are washed, but not often drowned, in rainfalls of keys and blips. One of the biggest surprises here is that Morimoto mostly leaves his sax at home, with the exception of the album’s bookends—he blares it loud enough to set off a car alarm on the opener, spins a few upward-spiraling phrases on the closer, and that’s pretty much it. Instead he  branches out with other tools, playing around with different guitars, synths, and production techniques, manning everything himself except for the live drums. But the album’s riskiest, and often best, moments come when he sings. He tries his hand, respectably, at being a full-on crooner on “Wrecked” and casually ascends a tower of harmonies on the breezy highlight “Symbols, Tokens,” taking two or three extra steps up that build into one glorious payoff note. “Everything reminds me of you,” he sings; the whole song feels like a warped, digital “God Only Knows” sung from a convertible. With each sharp twist, Morimoto racks up originality points—whether they land or not, they are certifiably, uncompromisingly out there. And while his progressions and arrangements can be breathtakingly kaleidoscopic, they’re also occasionally coupled with the sense that he’s trying too many things at once. You can’t help but wonder what his instrumental album would sound like, or one where he stretches his voice beyond perpetual chillness, or where he narrows and focuses his words. Sen Morimoto’s hindrances arise from the same place as its distinguishing qualities: an atmosphere of infinite possibility.","The Chicago multi-instrumentalist and jazz-rap artist’s self-titled double album conceals a reflective sorrow within its blissful swirl of beats and blips.

Letter to You,Bruce Springsteen,by: Sam Sodomsky,Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f886bf57ab9268eeb010702/1:1/w_160/letter%20to%20you_bruce%20springsteen.jpg,2020-10-22 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/bruce-springsteen-letter-to-you/,Columbia,"When the world first met him in the mid-’70s, Bruce Springsteen might have seemed like a throwback. He sang about first loves and teenage runaways; he dressed like a greaser and worshipped at the altar of jukeboxes and summer nights on the boardwalk. Many of his influences—Elvis Presley, Roy Orbison, Phil Spector—were at least a decade past the peak of their cultural impact. A glowing early review by Jon Landau claiming to have witnessed “rock and roll future” at a Springsteen concert helped define his mythology, but the opening words of the next sentence were just as crucial: “On a night when I needed to feel young....” Springsteen has spent much of his career wrestling with this penchant for nostalgia. (“I hope when I get old I don’t sit around thinking about it—but I probably will,” he sang in “Glory Days,” 36 years ago.) Some artists evolve through reinvention and others through refinement, but Springsteen has often compared the span of his career to a long conversation: He can revisit certain themes, even repeat himself, but the idea is to keep it moving. Springsteen turned 71 last month, and his 20th studio album, Letter to You, indulges in his past like never before. Following the autobiographical thread of his memoir and Broadway show, it seems to feature Springsteen himself as the narrator, observing the ways that music can sustain us, with a tone pitched between deep reverence and loss. That simple but elusive power forms the thematic heart of the record, and it also informs the sound. Last fall, Springsteen enlisted his longtime accompanists in the E Street Band to record the whole thing live in the studio during a snowy week in New Jersey. The goal was to approximate the untappable energy of their concerts and classic albums like Darkness on the Edge of Town. Working again with his 2010s collaborator Ron Aniello, the plan might have also been to avoid the obsessive tinkering that has distracted from his straightforward, earnest songwriting on recent records. Flourished with organ and saxophone, music box piano and glockenspiel, surf guitar licks and driving rhythm, Letter to You is bold and self-referential, using the sound of Springsteen’s own catalog the way he once treated the entirety of rock history. The songs are occasionally great—“Ghosts” and “Burnin’ Train,” in particular—and sometimes they feel remarkable just due to their old-school presentation. It is a welcome return after two decades of E Street records that, even at their best, tended to downplay the band’s strengths. Ironically, some of the strongest moments come from a time before Springsteen settled on those trademarks. A trio of original songs written in the early ’70s, while he was still an unsigned solo act, are given their first official studio outings, all enlivened with full-band arrangements that stretch out past the six-minute mark. My favorite is “Janey Needs a Shooter,” with a stunning coda and a Stevie Van Zandt-accompanied chorus, like a sea of fist pumps rising from a sweaty crowd. The other two songs—“If I Was the Priest” and “Song for Orphans”—aren’t quite as seamless, but it is fascinating hearing the band find their place behind Springsteen’s feverish word-association, a challenge that results in joyful chaos. The lyrics to these older songs are filled with skepticism toward salvation and sentimentality, an undercurrent to the record’s more romantic moments. (“Forget about the old friends and the old times,” he shouts in “If I Was the Priest.”) He approaches the idea again in “Rainmaker,” a gravelly outlier about desperate people in dire times, putting their faith in false prophets. “Sometimes folks need to believe in something so bad,” he sings, his voice full of fire and empathy. He claims to have written the song with political intent during the Bush years, but it gains resonance coming from an artist who has commanded so much loyalty and devotion on his own. Surrounded by songs about the life-affirming power of music, it poses a question: What happens if the people we turn to for answers, transcendence, and hope have none to offer? What happens when the show is over? This darkness and self-doubt is the other side of his story: the bandleader in “Last Man Standing” leaving the stage alone, with “just the ringing in [his] ears.” These lyrics are frequently offset by the E Street Band’s cozy presence, like sonic pep talks, adding a new purpose to their familiar roles. The album begins quietly with “One Minute You’re Here,” a gorgeous fragment featuring Springsteen on acoustic guitar, singing in a low, helpless drawl over faint brushes of piano and twinkling synth. When it segues into the wistful, mid-tempo title track, he introduces his bandmates less as a triumphant return than a man fighting back tears before collapsing into a group hug. In a black-and-white documentary accompanying the album, Springsteen’s home studio appears as a kind of interactive museum, filled with old guitars and faded pictures of past collaborators, including the Castiles, his teenage rock band. The 2018 death of George Theiss, the Castiles’ frontman, inspired Springsteen to start writing these songs. In “Ghosts,” he describes a welcome haunting—old friends passing through by surprise, in a world that can otherwise feel sad and empty. The best moments on the album have a similar effect. The closing track is called “I’ll See You in My Dreams,” and the verse melody shares a striking resemblance to the guitar riff from “Born to Run.” “We’ll meet and live and laugh again,” he sings hopefully. “For death is not the end.” The future has never been more uncertain; the past has never seemed further away. But as long as the band is playing, the dream is alive.","Riding the E Street Band’s familiar uplift, Springsteen grapples with the complexities of nostalgia, a tension that animates his writing and manifests in the sound of the music itself.

The L.I.B.R.A. (The Legend Is Back Running Atlanta),T.I.,by: Trey Alston,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f8d9e6378b33ac17930895c/1:1/w_160/the%20libra_ti.jpg,2020-10-22 05:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/ti-the-libra-the-legend-is-back-running-atlanta/,Grand Hustle,"On 2018’s “Ye vs. the People,” T.I. gave Kanye West an earful about publicly supporting Donald Trump. He played devil’s advocate to West’s MAGA-hat musings, and in the process, found a way to bring his characteristically thoughtful, loud, and direct public commentary to music. T.I. dropped his tenth album, Dime Trap, soon after, picking up where “Ye vs. the People” left off with a loving sendoff to the trap music subgenre he’d ushered into existence 15 years earlier. Dime Trap positioned T.I. as a veteran on the cusp of a major career turn—ready to tackle the tensions that his politics bring to his music. Two years later, T.I.’s eleventh studio album The L.I.B.R.A. (The Legend Is Back Running Atlanta) represents the first taste of what promised to be a new era. But though it arrives during the world’s worst modern pandemic and widespread social unrest (topics that T.I. has engaged publicly), it has nearly nothing to say about the moment at hand. The L.I.B.R.A. is more concerned with sprinting alongside Atlanta’s new generation than with cementing his legacy or exploring his politics. In 2020, T.I. has seemingly tried harder than ever to become the spokesperson of Black America. The L.I.B.R.A. looks past this, leaving his passionate speeches on the internet. Opening track “The L.I.B.R.A. Introduction” sets the tone with a mythologization of the rapper’s story, courtesy of comedian Ms. Pat. “Do you know how hard it is to have to flip the script and odds into your favor?” she asks, calling the rapper the “baddest motherfucker in Atlanta” and noting that, 20 years in, he still doesn’t have any grey hair in his beard. That seemingly meaningless observation sticks in your brain as The L.I.B.R.A. goes on, a reminder of what the album is really focused on: proving that T.I. is just as capable of being rap’s “it” guy as anyone half his age. Plenty of rappers pine for the attention of younger generations, but it’s especially grating given T.I.’s propensity to speak about topics that actually define our times. “Pardon,” with its use-once-and-toss instrumental, is primarily a means of attempting to rap like guest star Lil Baby. “Hit Dogs Holla,” an ominous, bass-knocking brag fest featuring Florida rapper and Grand Hustle signee Tokyo Jetz, is the kind of high-energy missile that any current Atlanta rapper would sound at home over. These songs introduce nothing new to T.I.’s story or sound, but they’re exactly what you’d expect to find 13 tracks deep into a curated rap playlist on a streaming service. L.I.B.R.A. leaves the heavy thematic lifting to interludes featuring Black women, but even those are a mixed bag because half of them are focused on T.I. Ms. Pat’s adoring opening is nearly identical to Rapsody’s “Air & Water Interlude,” a wasted opportunity for one of hip-hop’s most talented women, who uses her wondrous poetic dexterity to explain that “Without T.I.P., the world might tip.” By the time a message of substance arrives, the album’s already halfway complete. On “Fire & Earth Interlude,” actress Ernestine Johnson Morrison delivers a poignant spoken-word piece about the Black community. But, weirdly, it features a hypocritical moment where Johnson says, “I dare you to rap about anything but your pussy/Or how good you suck his—/How good you look and how tight your Fashion Nova fit/I remember when rap queens really used to spit.” You want to cringe at the audacity, then roll your eyes when you realize that nearly the entire album up until that point is about how good T.I. looks and acts. The most memorable moments on L.I.B.R.A. come when T.I. introduces the real young people he keeps up with: his children. On standout “Family Connect,” T.I. brings in his son Domani Harris to express how it feels to live in his father’s shadow. Domani handles the topic with dexterity: “I’m most definitely my daddy’s son, it’s no denyin’/I used to run from my last name/I was mortified of being that nigga that live off a nigga at 25.” T.I. feigns curiosity in his response, but you can tell he’s a little hurt. “Ridin’ round in a Vanquish, tryna stop for complainants/’Cause my kids won’t let me help ’em and I just can’t ascertain it,” he says. The closer, which features T.I.’s daughter Deyjah Harris speaking about her Black experience, doesn’t make up for the album’s lack of a political voice, but it offers a bit of soul—something there should have been more of altogether. For the duration of his career, T.I. has been obsessed with respect, to the point of proclaiming that he would die to have it put on his name. With that in mind, The L.I.B.R.A. looks like death by a thousand cuts—an album so obsessed with claiming respect, and with fitting in, that it doesn’t truly need to exist. In searching for the respect that he’s already earned over the course of his career, T.I. suddenly appears to occupy a position where people might fail to acknowledge it at all.","T.I.’s eleventh album is more concerned with sprinting alongside Atlanta’s new generation than with cementing his legacy or exploring his politics.

Burden of Proof,Benny the Butcher,by: Dylan Green,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f8da052b42652c21f25a99b/1:1/w_160/burden%20of%20proof_benny%20the%20butcher%20:%20hit-boy.jpg,2020-10-22 05:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/benny-the-butcher-burden-of-proof/,GriseldaEMPIRE,"Benny the Butcher’s story, like the rest of his Griselda Records cohorts, is one of endurance. There are 14 years between his debut Tana Talk and 2018’s Tana Talk 3, the Buffalo rapper’s formal introduction on the same label as his cousins Westside Gunn and Conway the Machine. During that time, he sharpened his style and emerged fully formed, rapping about dope needles and broken bottles. Benny’s gruff voice, hard-earned lessons, and punchlines quickly earned him a reputation as a feature killer on the rap circuit. More than just a textbook bruiser, though, he’s the rap game’s answer to Jason Voorhees: unrelenting, focused, stoic to the point of menace. Benny’s latest project Burden of Proof is as much a reflection on his old life as it is a celebration of his new one. Tours have sold out and Rolex watches gleam on his wrist, but old ghosts and lost friends still haunt him. Benny’s music has never shied away from the grisly nature of drug dealing, but now he’s more closely examining the consequences of early spoils. He remembers nights spent in the hospital due to asthma attacks (“Where Would I Go”) and conversations with his girlfriend over bringing his gun on the road (“New Streets”). Every diamond in his bezel was earned through strife, and Benny reveals more aspects of his journey on Burden than ever before. Even with the battle scars, Burden never becomes dour or overbearing. Unlike Westside Gunn, who's released three albums in 2020, Burden is Benny's first solo project since 2019’s The Plugs I Met. That's an eternity in Griselda time, and Benny's best raps across the album are more potent as a result of the breather. In fact, everything about Burden’s construction is maximal, scanning as the Next Big Career Step it clearly aspires to be. The album was produced entirely by California super producer Hit-Boy and was mixed and mastered by Young Guru, rap’s engineer to the stars. Hit-Boy has spent 2020 in rap chameleon mode, crafting entire albums to suit the likes of Nas, Dom Kennedy, and Big Sean. He attempts to do the same for Benny, outfitting Burden with a sound that closes the gap between the lush grandeur of early-2000s Roc-A-Fella and early-2010s Maybach Music Group. When the duo clicks, it feels monumental. “Famous” straps throbbing drums and cymbals to a wailing vocal sample and pulls the ripcord, placing Benny’s braggadocio (“Three Rollies, two cribs, six figures/And I still don’t feel famous”) on a proper pedestal. Closing track “Legend” bounces hi-hats and shining synths off of Benny’s amped-up mythmaking to create what sounds like superhero theme music. Hit-Boy chops chipmunk soul loops and even offers his spin on the minimalist aesthetic that put Griselda on the map. At its best, the sample work across Burden is stunning. For all its bells and whistles, there are times where Hit-Boy’s beats sound too clean, even sterile. “Over the Limit” shoots for stadium rap and lands somewhere in an NBA2K commercial featuring the latest in a seemingly never-ending stream of mediocre Dom Kennedy features. “Where Would I Go” feels tailored more to Rick Ross’ sensibilities than to Benny’s, especially considering Ross’ hefty 90-second verse on the backend. The beat sounds like it was originally meant for Ross’ Port of Miami 2 but was retrofitted here instead. It’s hard to blame Benny for wanting to branch out from the gutter-soaked boom-bap that first brought him attention. He has every right to experiment and try on sounds as he sees fit. Hit-Boy attempts to balance this out by heading in the opposite direction so fully that it occasionally overwhelms Benny’s personality. There’s a thin line between making songs that evoke the feeling of Jay-Z’s The Blueprint 2 or Ross’ own Mastermind and songs doing Roc-A-Fella and MMG cosplay. Still, Benny is in rare lyrical form. “What’s more important: the flower or the soil that grow it?” he raps on “One Way Flight,” mixing stories of drug felonies and life advice to dizzying effect. His energy and wordplay help him rip through the album’s lesser beats like Porky Pig, transcending them entirely. He’s been rechristened as one of Buffalo’s first rap stars and you can hear the confidence in his voice. Burden of Proof is undoubtedly the next step in Benny’s evolution, even if the music doesn’t always match the vision.","On his latest project, the Griselda Records rapper reflects on old battle scars and new riches over luxury beats helmed by Hit-Boy. Though he occasionally steps into cosplay, the result is ambitious.

First Fire • At Dawn,John Kolodij,by: Colin Joyce,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f8866731efa8e109cd45189/1:1/w_160/First%20Fire%20%E2%80%A2%20At%20Dawn_John%20Kolodij.jpg,2020-10-22 05:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/john-kolodij-first-fire-at-dawn/,Astral Editions,"John Kolodij saw the slowly unraveling instrumentals he made for nearly a decade as High Aura’d as the soundtrack to spaces he barely knew. In 2017, he told Tiny Mix Tapes that as he sat at home working on his music, he’d often imagine himself in far-off lands—“in a desert, at the edge of an ocean, nighttime in Sonoma, crossing a footbridge in Miami”—and try to make pieces that fit those landscapes. It was his way, he says, of trying to “score everyday life,” and his years of recording with that idea as a guidepost resulted in an evocative, strikingly visual body of work. High Aura’d’s pieces were minimal, but there were always suggestions of memory, adventure, and kaleidoscopic imagery woven into the gentle drones. For First Fire • At Dawn, Kolodij left the High Aura’d banner behind in favor of his given name, but his instrumentals still follow in the transportive tradition of his earlier pieces. As with a lot of amorphous music, there’s certainly joy in just drifting along to the slow-panning movements of the record’s two side-long pieces, following the arc from noise to melody and back again. But First Fire • At Dawn is special, even among Kolodij’s accomplished catalog, because of the delight it seems to take in small, transitory details, the shimmery liminal spaces that naturally emerge as its tracks build and boil. “First Fire” is the more austere of the two pieces, opening with the stark wheeze of a grayscale drone that slowly grows in scale and momentum throughout its nearly 18-minute runtime. By the time it peaks, around the 13-minute mark, the music resembles something more like a snowblind black-metal riff than the ominous rumble that started the song. The instrumental accumulation is glacial, but if you pay close attention there’s beauty to be found in the growing maelstrom. The nimbus-like billowing of Kolodij’s guitar work often creases and coalesces into striking shapes, revealing complex harmonies and churning melodies in the depths of the drone. These moments appear for just a second, then pass, a tactic that makes these pieces feel illusory but engaging: You lean closer to hear what other secrets might be lurking in the murk. The record’s other side, “At Dawn,” is gentler. Built around the mantra-like repetition of a simple banjo melody and some placid guitar work, it’s a stretched-out, twisted-up sort of Americana, similar to Charalambides’ distressed blues or the Appalachian fog of the composer Ross Gentry’s music as Villages. But even though its form is more recognizable at first, “At Dawn” is just as focused on the shape-shifting details that give “First Fire” color. The track begins with the twittering of field recordings of birds, which then make little appearances throughout, adding micro-melodies and a sense of real-world groundedness to the loping instrumental. As the piece unfolds, Kolodij’s contributions are joined by some gasping fiddle work from Anna RG of the experimental folk duo Anna & Elizabeth and glittering mallet percussion from the composer Sarah Hennies. If, as the song’s title suggests, it’s meant to be a companion to early morning quietude, these contributions from Kolodij’s friends are the ornamentation that lends that time of day its strange magic: The string flourishes hang delicately like fog on a lake, a vibraphone glinting like dew on the grass in the half light. As soon as these moments of bliss appear, they vanish, blending into the blustery ambiance and the sound of rushing water. First Fire • At Dawn relishes in these moments, in the ways their details can appear then evaporate, almost as quickly as you can perceive them. He has said his music has always been about astral trips to far-away lands, but First Fire • At Dawn is less about the destination than the journey itself. You stare outside as the landscape changes—every moment you’re somewhere new.","Trading his High Aura’d alias for his own name, the Providence experimental musician finds evocative depths in the small, transitory details of slowly evolving drone pieces.

Apolonio,Omar Apollo ,by: Jackson Howard,Contributor ,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f8756dc46ede078a4647445/1:1/w_160/Apolonio_omar%20apollo.jpg,2020-10-21 05:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/omar-apollo-apolonio/,Warner,"For music that drips with adolescent, hormone-fueled infatuation, Omar Apollo’s songs are notably free of the melodrama of teenagehood. “And you said I was your soulmate, but that was just a lie,” he bemoans on “Useless”—a highlight from his latest project Apolonio—before pivoting with a shrug: “It’s alright, we’re too young to be giving out advice.” Playful yet self-aware, Apollo, 23, knows how to navigate the peaks and valleys of youthful angst, lust, and carefree fun without ever taking himself too seriously. Apollo’s triple-threat potential has always been part of the conversation surrounding his music: handsome and stylish, equipped with a malleable, multi-octave vocal range that scrapes Miguel-level heights, he’s nearly as talented a producer as he is a singer-songwriter. Apolonio’s sound, like that of 2018’s Stereo and 2019’s Friends, bridges the vulnerable funk of Daniel Caesar, the seductive atmosphere of Kali Uchis (who steals the show on Apolonio’s “Hey Boy”), and the warm solitude of Nostalgia, Ultra-era Frank Ocean. It’s not a new sound, nor is it particularly balanced, but across these nine songs, aided by Apollo’s undeniable charisma, Apolonio melts into something perfectly suited for the butterflies of a long-awaited kiss or the nostalgia of an old yearbook. Like much of Apollo’s music, Apolonio pulses with yearning; what’s different here is Apollo’s comfort in directing it to men as well as women. His songwriting has opened up as a result. “Drive through Georgia 19 hours on vacation/I ain’t never left the state, man, I been waiting/and that pretty boy still hit me up on strange occasions,” he sings on “Kamikaze,” a piercing reflection on teenage heartbreak. But then the humor peeks through. “I ain’t really know you was freaky, though,” he sings moments later, his voice poking out of its monotone. “Ass round like Cheerios.” Apollo’s take on queerness has always been sly and understated; there’s no doubt that questions about his sexuality, which he’s avoided addressing directly since he broke out, have made him more beguiling. But there’s no right way for a queer person to be queer—and hearing Apollo, on “Kamikaze,” remembering being hurt by a boy who moved on, or singing about boys, girls, and a crush on a boy who’s with a girl now on the bouncy bilingual opener “I’m Amazing,” it all feels honest and vulnerable, like moments of self-actualization that reduce the exhausting public obsession with other people’s sexuality to dust. This isn’t to say he has it all figured out. Apolonio feels more like a collection of disparate sketches than a cohesive vision—jumping from Parliament-style funk and muted pop to rapping and Mexican corrido (on the exuberant origin story “Dos Uno Nueve,” sung in Spanish), it’s a reflection of Apollo’s own unbound energy, both giddy and unsure. He’s most in his comfort zone when he deepens an already established sound, like on lead single “Stayback,” a wet and sticky slow jam that has Apollo reaching for a Curtis Mayfield falsetto, over-enunciating and dramatically scrunching his voice up like George Clinton (the knockout remix even features Bootsy Collins). He strikes gold on “Useless,” which features guitar and songwriting from Strokes guitarist Albert Hammond Jr.; Apollo does his best Julian Casablancas impression on the verses before flooding the chorus with thwacking bass and flawless harmonies. It’s a clear homage to the Strokes that nonetheless feels distinctly new, and it works. Apollo and his occasional co-producers (including Frank Ocean collaborator Michael Uzowuru, 21-year-old wunderkind Teo Halm, and hip-hop iconoclast DJ Dahi) sometimes struggle to keep that same level of focus throughout the project. “Want U Around,” featuring singer Ruel, is the type of flat funk imitation that “Stayback” manages to avoid. One of two tracks not at least co-produced by Apollo himself, “Bi Fren” forces Apollo into sounding like a groaning clone of Post Malone and Khalid over an anonymous beat, stripping him of his trademark quirk and taking the punch out of his wrenching vulnerability. The more you listen to Apolonio, the more its unevenness comes to feel like an extension of Apollo himself, still growing, still curious. Yet for the first time in Apollo’s brief career, it’s not his potential that feels most thrilling, but rather the glimpses we’re getting of what’s already there; Apolonio undoubtedly stands on its own as his most fully realized work. Apollo’s music celebrates what was and what is, not what could be, and in a moment when the future feels catastrophic at best, there’s comfort in knowing that a few years ago, in a different reality, a teenaged Omar Apollo drove 19 hours to Georgia to see his crush for the last time.","For the first time in his brief career, the triple-threat singer is running on more than just potential. On his latest project, he brings youthful charm, optimism, and curiosity to his most fully realized work yet.

Shiver,Jónsi,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f8dcdbf78b33ac179308985/1:1/w_160/shiver_jonsi.jpg,2020-10-21 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/jonsi-shiver/,Krunk,"The first words that swim up from the dark, supple electronic void of “Exhale,” which opens Shiver, Sigur Rós visionary Jónsi’s striving but muddled attempt at a pop album: “Breathe in, breathe out.” They’re followed by a consoling mantra of assurances: Everyone’s alright and it’s just the way it is. It isn’t your fault and you can just let it go. It’s as if Bruce Horsby had been hired to write lyrics for Frozen. It would be unfair to suggest that Jónsi is addressing these complacent platitudes to anything more specific than the solipsistic affirmation proven to forge positive associations with car commercials. But the disconnection of his words from our times is conspicuous, and it characterizes an album that appears cordoned off from any world beyond the self. Shiver is a cathedral of feelings without referents, almost without qualities beyond their enormous size. Its spasms of idiosyncrasy can’t entirely conceal what is basically an artsier, hookless Imagine Dragons—beautiful, boring, generically uplifting, and deliberately meaningless. Of course, substance was never Sigur Rós’s strength, either; sweeping scale and emotional texture were. The popular Icelandic post-rock group dispersed orchestras into romantic mists and meaning into its own “Hopelandic” gibberish; on Shiver, Icelandic-language lyrics sometimes relieve the numbing banality of the English. Frequent Charli XCX producer A. G. Cook’s hectic Max Martin style is far from a natural fit for the dramatic, drawn-out singing Jónsi prefers, and without the dynamic presence or indestructible hooks of a pop artist, most of the alchemy he discovers with Cook is spinning gossamer into lead. Jónsi still has a lovely voice capable of large-scale expressive effects, computerized or otherwise, but his monotonously slow and solemn register clashes with this busy, nervously worked-over production. The songs alternate between passages deconstructed to the point of formlessness and passages swarming with overcompensating activity, liberally dashed with pop clichés. Big tumbling ’80s drum hits, singalong nonsense earworms, and lustrous EDM plug-ins burst in and out, but a lugubrious mood steals back over all. Almost every song has a good part mired somewhere in the longueurs and affectations. If the rest of “Wildeye” had more to do with its anthemic third minute, it might be a banger, but this moment of clarity is cramped by long ranks of noisy drums and a pitiful woo-woo hook that feels like a stem from another song. “Kórall” has a beating heart, though it’s hectored by IDM test patterns and balloon squeaks. “Sumarið sem aldrei kom” is a welcome choral respite, “Hold” shows signs of cohesion, and “Swill” is solid, forgiving some grating dubstep gestures. But by then, the record may have already worn out all but the most dedicated listeners. Cocteau Twins’ Elizabeth Fraser is wasted on the interminable “Cannibal,” which has a nice little climax that can’t quite shake off the preceding dream-pop slog. In “Salt Licorice,” poor Robyn has to grit her way through a sandstorm of bitcrushed synths before a warm Europop throb finally clears the air and gives her some room to maneuver. The parts of Shiver that strain to be fun and fresh can’t seem to break orbit from the grandiose mass of Sigur Rós, and the album leaves a sense of oppressive profundity in its bulky wake.","The Sigur Rós frontman’s muddled attempt at a pop album is a cathedral of feelings without referents: beautiful, boring, generically uplifting, and deliberately meaningless.

Roped In,North Americans,by: Allison Hussey,"Associate Staff Writer, News",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f8864a75ca75431fcdec919/1:1/w_160/Roped%20In_North%20Americans.jpg,2020-10-21 05:00:00,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/north-americans-roped-in/,Third Man,"One joy of ambient music: the space it gives a listener to just be. Departing from prescriptivist emotional cues and binary thought, the genre rewards patience without demanding a verdict. A country-indebted subgenre has emerged within that universe thanks to the pedal steel guitar, a notoriously fussy and expensive instrument that delivers heavenly tones for all the trouble it demands, as suited for conjuring mystical desert landscapes as it is for adding elasticity to country classics. Following leads from Susan Alcorn and Daniel Lanois, acts like SUSS, Chuck Johnson, Mute Duo, and now North Americans have all recently gamboled in that realm. The project began as a vehicle for Los Angeles-based acoustic guitarist Patrick McDermott, who is joined by Portland pedal steel player Barry Walker on Roped In, a rich and languid addition to the country-ambient canon. Roped In bears some of the hazy float of Walker’s 2018 album, Diaspora Urkontinent, but a softer, more melodic focus sets it apart from both Walker’s more free-ranging solo work and McDermott’s earlier material. On Going Steady, the previous North Americans album, the guitarist occasionally tucked his fingerpicking under sheets of fuzz, but he allows himself more breathing room here, drawing out melodies between Walker’s resonant curls. “Good Doer” is the album’s closest thing to a downer, with an anxious guitar line and fuzzy pedal steel, but even it can’t sour the album’s sanguine mood. Whatever you need to feel, Roped In gives you space to feel it. The album’s nine pieces are all fairly short, none of them lasting for more than four and a half minutes. Rather than prioritizing complete sensory immersion, Roped In focuses on the tension of form and formlessness between the acoustic and pedal steel guitars, emphasizing the former’s agility and the latter’s unbound contours. On “Rivers That You Cannot See,” Walker curves sustained notes over McDermott’s short cycles of strumming, then layers his own picking into a dense peak. The pair slow to a molasses-like slide on “Run Down,” with low reverb forming a droning foundation to their interplay. They’re at their strongest with “American Dipper,” where their tumbling instrumental lines become almost inextricable. While Walker and McDermott make a capable team, guest appearances from guitarist William Tyler and harpist Mary Lattimore bring more nuance to their efforts. Tyler’s contributions bookend the record—opener “Memory of Lunch,” plus the album’s final two tracks—and his own lithe fingerpicking style is well-matched to McDermott’s without upstaging it. Meanwhile, “Run Down” and “Furniture in the Valley” show Lattimore’s knack for bringing extra sparkle to everything she touches. The soft edges of Roped In make it both a sublime record in its own right as well as a pleasant, inviting portal into a wider world of simpatico artists. The album feels like the aural equivalent of gazing into a massive and well-appointed aquarium, a vessel for color and movement that quietly soothes as it shuttles along.","The instrumental duo of guitarist Patrick McDermott and pedal steel player Barry Walker meld country-folk composition with ambient sonics, creating a languid and colorful world.

Someone New,Helena Deland,by: Sophie Kemp ,Contributor ,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f87538329dd317c0d51932d/1:1/w_160/Someone%20New_Helena%20Deland.jpg,2020-10-21 05:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/helena-deland-someone-new/,Luminelle,"Helena Deland writes songs about love from the vantage point of a dream state. The Montreal-based songwriter’s music channels feelings of derealization and disconnect: those moments when your body no longer feels like your own, or your words seem to hang like language suspended, illuminated in midair. Deland writes in fragments: On her last release, a strange series of EPs later packaged as an album titled From the Series of Songs “Altogether Unaccompanied”, she told cryptic and poetic stories tinged by psychedelic drugs and loneliness and longing. She spoke in hushed couplets paired with swollen bass and guitars that felt sympatico with early Elliott Smith albums. Deland’s stunning, intricate debut album, Someone New, a record about the complexities of new relationships, is a more cohesive, full-color version of those early sketches, with the sharp angles and harsh lighting of a Dutch vanitas painting. Despite its frequent darkness and sullen mood, Someone New shudders with a digital glow. Deland often takes the structure to what might otherwise be a simple indie-rock song and imbues it with guitar processing, looping, and stormy, low-end frequencies. The textures she favors come from the ’90s, landing somewhere between the breathy, honey-coated vocals of Hope Sandoval and the heady, fermented eroticism of Portishead. Opener “Someone New” is cut from the same cloth as Portishead’s “The Rip,” with its glassy kick drums, looped vocals, and unexpected key changes at the song’s midpoint. Deland evokes the torrent of complicated emotions that come from kissing someone new for the first time: “I’ll be covered head to toe/In the faded flower patterns of/Memories/Of nights like these,” she sings as the song softens and warms, like a body lowered into a steaming bath. Then, there’s a deep exhale, and the music’s prettiness gets bruised a bit. Deland sighs a promise to give herself a “fucking break,” in the way that one might in a moment of uncertainty, when a new person’s face is hovering in front of your own and the noise inside your head drowns out everything else. Someone New replicates the push and pull of a complicated relationship, one that Deland often seems to feel ambivalent about. “Dog” is decadent like roses resting on a velvet blanket: Muffled loops of lo-fi guitars and distorted drums seem to emit from a jewelry box while Deland’s voice is coolly removed, as if dissociated from the situation at hand. She sings about a potentially unhealthy relationship, wryly likening herself to a dog on a leash. “Truth Nugget” zeroes in on the feeling of being unknowable in the eyes of another. “I am another solid mystery when it comes to you/Michael, I’m the puzzle in the other room,” she sings, her eye contact unwavering. Meanwhile, “Smoking at the Gas Station,” underscores the volatility of Deland’s situation. She sings placidly about the risk of losing oneself in another person: “Trace the outline of my hand/So I’m reminded where I end.” Disembodiment and derealization, as conditions inextricable from the nascent stages of love, reach their apotheosis on the bloodshot “Pale,” where the bass gets so noisy it gives the sensation of having your ears duct-taped to a subwoofer. “Spending this time/In my naked body’s/Not making it familiar to me,” Deland sings in a tone that is unnervingly calm and chill, as if the feeling of corporeal alienation that accompanies standing naked in front of a new lover were as anodyne as buying orange juice. “Mid-Practice” is the record’s most understated song, so subtle you wouldn’t be faulted for missing its brilliance on first listen. Percussion clicks like beads on an abacus, and guitar swims in a reverberant haze. Deland sings of waiting and loneliness, of “rehearsing love ’til it’s real.” “What I find worse/Than a love that hurts when it’s captive/Is a love that thrives/On being the hunter,” she sings in a daze, in conversation with herself. “Off I go again,” she continues—yet for a hunter, she sounds remarkably placid. You can almost imagine her smiling as she sings the line. It’s jarring. As a songwriter, Deland has a gift for creating extreme juxtapositions as bewildering as palm trees on Mount Everest, always managing to sound extraordinarily at ease while tackling complex thoughts about human existence. Her songs are like islands: self-contained, gorgeous little worlds where nothing is obvious—especially the genesis of love and its unsteady first steps.","The Montreal singer-songwriter’s debut album addresses the strangeness of nascent love, channeling feelings of derealization and disconnect in intricately detailed electronic pop miniatures.

Serpentine Prison,Matt Berninger,by: Hannah Jocelyn,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f874c4db6198d0e55910e41/1:1/w_160/serpentine%20prison_matt%20berninger.jpg,2020-10-20 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/matt-berninger-serpentine-prison/,BookConcord,"Matt Berninger has not been the “average person out in the American heartland” for some time, but that’s not a bad thing. His main band, the National, has continued to release compelling, challenging albums long after they became a worldwide success. Much like his bandmates in underappreciated (and horribly named) experimental supergroups LNZNDRF and Pfarmers, Berninger has used the time between National records to blow off steam and explore new paths. With Brent Knopf collaboration EL VY, he sent up his own rock-star image with eccentric, upbeat new wave. The origins of Serpentine Prison are more sentimental: Berninger initially partnered with producer Booker T. Jones to pay tribute to his childhood love of Willie Nelson’s Jones-produced covers record, Stardust. Jones encouraged Berninger to flesh out some demos written with friends, including Walter Martin of the Walkmen and singer-songwriter Harrison Whitford, a member of Phoebe Bridgers’ touring band. These songs don’t have the nervous energy of Berninger’s main project, instead opting for something even quieter and more laid-back. That leaves Berninger to tie everything together—but his performances and lyrics feel nondescript. With Jones and frequent National collaborator Sean O’Brien co-producing, Serpentine Prison is technically accomplished, but Berninger’s looseness clashes with the record’s professionalism. In his memoir Time Is Tight, Jones writes that the outside producer must “find and make a place” in a group’s pecking order, something he learned when he found himself lost in the pot smoke of Nelson’s Stardust sessions. (His defense, which sounds like a Berningerism: “I never correctly judged the potency of the grass.”) He certainly finds his place here; like Stardust, Serpentine Prison sounds gorgeous and unfussy. Most of the session musicians have played on National records, but under Jones’ direction they adapt to a jazzier, more organic sound, and Knopf sneaks some EL VY goofiness into “One More Second.” Even the more National-esque songs, like standouts “All for Nothing” and “Take Me Out of Town,” feel part of the new record’s world. “Distant Axis” stands out for its more conventional AOR trappings, but the polish favorably recalls early-2000s U2. Early on with the National, Berninger’s lyrics often felt like honest sentiments filtered through layers of masculine repression until they came out mangled and esoteric. (See this Trouble Will Find Me-era Tumblr post, which documented normal phrases vs. their Berninger equivalents.) His lyrics became more direct, even lovelorn, by 2019’s I Am Easy to Find, but he still found creative ways to contrast his band members’ complexity; here, he and his band might as well be on different records. Opener “My Eyes Are T-Shirts” and Gail Ann Dorsey duet “Silver Springs” try to build something sultry, but Berninger’s lyrics lean so heavily into self-pastiche that they don’t connect the same way. Berninger can stretch himself: His morally ambiguous lyrics on “Loved So Little” (“It’s only God/Or the devil when you’re in it/I’m always getting caught in the middle”) and smoky delivery match the complexity of the other players. Berninger’s sentimentality usually pushes back against the National’s reputation for self-serious art rock, but it doesn’t hold up as well on its own. “One More Second” was conceived as a response to “I Will Always Love You,” but the lyrics are so boilerplate (“The way we talked last night/It felt like a different kind of fight”) that it could be a response to just about anything. When Berninger ambles about, barely stringing together melodies on “Oh Dearie” as Andrew Bird’s violin soars and Mickey Raphael’s bass harmonica drones, he feels like the least talented person on his own album. He’s most at home revisiting familiar themes of intimacy and projection on the title track: “I feel like an impersonation of you/Or am I doing another version of you doing me?” It’s not that the emperor has no clothes, it’s that these don’t fit. The fun of Berninger’s non-National projects is in seeing his quirks emerge in other guises: Is he really mumbling a Lauren Mayberry melody on a CHVRCHES album? Did he really reference Depeche Mode in a musical adaptation of Cyrano de Bergerac? Even when he covered “Stardust” with Jones producing, he brought his mannerisms to an otherwise faithful rendition. But aside from the occasional sneaky homage to Kristin Hersh or Big Star, Serpentine Prison lacks that novelty; it sounds like he’s actively trying to write the kind of modern standards that “Bloodbuzz Ohio” and “I Need My Girl” improbably became. Jones and O’Brien’s production is engaging, but their work begs for something that isn’t so perfunctory and slight. Instead of the modern Stardust, Serpentine Prison is merely a prolific musician’s stopgap.","The National frontman’s solo debut unwinds the nervous energy in favor of something more laid-back. The music is gorgeous and unfussy, but his performances and lyrics feel nondescript.

skins n slime,Oliver Coates,by: Jazz Monroe,Associate Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f874fd81efa8e109cd450e5/1:1/w_160/skins%20n%20slime_oliver%20coates.jpg,2020-10-20 05:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/oliver-coates-skins-n-slime/,Rvng Intl.,"Oliver Coates was anointed a prodigy in the mid 2000s after notching up preposterous exam scores at London’s Royal Academy of Music. He has since shouldered the burden of excellence—embedding in lofty orchestras, accompanying Terry Riley and Steve Reich, scheming with fellow maverick Mica Levi—while hatching plans to vanquish the “Catholic-style guilt” that frightens virtuosos into musical obedience. In this spirit, the cellist occasionally spritzes out some outré dance music to dispel the musty air of academia. His 2018 album, Shelley’s on Zenn-La, did just that, drizzling puckish beats with heavily manipulated cello and lysergic synth globules. On the records preceding skins n slime, Coates moved easily between genres yet tended to keep his superhero costumes—the classical virtuoso and the electronics whiz—on separate hangers. Any mix-and-matching occurred primarily in the arena of live solo performance. (Thanks to support slots with Radiohead and Thom Yorke, his arena of solo performance now includes actual arenas.) On stage, he plants a cello between his legs, feeds it through effects units and loopers, and summons currents of mourning and ecstasy. Skins n slime bottles the shows’ volcanic intensity by galvanizing raucous shoegaze, minimalist classical, macabre drone, and lashings of plutonic metal, despite rarely reaching for more than a few instrumental elements. To promote the album, Coates playfully coined a “pastoral metal” hashtag, which feels about right: On songs like “Butoh Baby,” wing-beating melodies soar over scorched-earth synth that channels both wraithlike black metal and the low-end abrasion of sludge and drone. While Coates favors simple, stately toplines, the record’s underbelly suggests fathomless depths; instead of sprawling outward, like Shelley’s on Zenn-La, the songs pirouette before plunging into the abyss. The album’s splicing of beauty and horror invokes the morbid logic of Greek mythology, where stirrings of triumph tend to foreshadow nasty surprises. The “slime” of the album title is another Coates neologism, describing what he calls “a viscous and melting approach to live sound” employed on three songs. The base ingredient is a slow, improvised melody on overdriven cello. At predetermined intervals, automated loops and reversals crash back in waves, washing the song into harmonic flux. The flirtation with chance may sound suspiciously academic—like a sort of anti-virtuosity flex—but Coates pulls it off: Doused in chorus and distortion, the slime of “Caregiver part 2 (4am),” “Caregiver part 5 (money),” and the Fenneszian “Reunification” adds a celestial sheen to the album’s peaks. Coates takes almost sadistic pleasure in contorting, abrading, vaporizing, ensliming, and otherwise transmogrifying the instrument he has played since childhood. One moment, the primordial howl of “Caregiver part 5 (money)” evokes a bagpipe elegy bending through Highland winds; the next, it could be a shoegaze fragment wondrously magnified, as if you were peering down a microscope at autopsied My Bloody Valentine spangle. On “Butoh Baby” and “Caregiver part 1 (breathing),” one or two beatific melodies circle the brink of a crescendo, only for the would-be finale to snag and loop. Like an opera director mercilessly drilling a climax, Coates perpetually re-enacts these flashes of joy until, after a while, they feel like one long expression of melancholy. Coates wrapped the album last Christmas in Glasgow, working in those graveyard hours when, he says, “caregiver” cleaners would materialize to sweep away the night’s excess. Something in the album’s contrasts—its synthesis of infinite drone and infinitesimal melodies—evokes the grandeur of those small acts. Healing overtones ring clearest on “Honey,” a blaze of cello in six parts, reminiscent of the palliative techno popular at European dance festivals. In the hands of crowd-pleasing DJs, this brand of endorphin-balancing ambience sends hectic ravers peacefully into the night. Coates, by contrast, omits the rousing beats and renders his strings as beams of distortion that radiate an angelic glow. The song’s gentle repetition does not leave you content, but rather as a visitation might: stunned, faintly spooked, yet convinced, in the way you can feel a sneeze coming, that profound change is imminent.","Running his instrument through a bevy of effects, the virtuoso cellist summons a powerful, mesmerizing sound variously evoking shoegaze, classical minimalism, drone, and doom metal.

Fake It Flowers,beabadoobee,by: Arielle Gordon,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f87523986e497a31b6cefb0/1:1/w_160/Fake%20It%20Flowers_beabadoobee.jpg,2020-10-20 05:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/beabadoobee-fake-it-flowers/,Dirty Hit,"Bea Kristi writes songs for the movies of her dreams. Though her music gained traction on the comparatively small screens of TikTok and YouTube, the 20-year-old guitarist and singer fantasizes through a cinematic lens: Tom Hanks is her hero; the Juno soundtrack introduced her to the folksy side of indie rock. The Hollywood sensibility carries through to her music, which she releases as beabadoobee, a moniker invented as an Instagram handle. And rather than discuss musical or lyrical themes, she describes her work in visual terms: The songs on her full-length debut, Fake It Flowers, have self-described “end of ’90s movie vibes” and remind her of a “2000s chick flick.” In case her floral motifs and rose-hued music videos don’t state it plainly enough, Kristi steps in to shade the finer details of her Nora Ephron-esque vision: “The girl finally gets with the boy at the end.” As a troublemaking teenager in London, Kristi found solace in a guitar her father gave her, teaching herself to play from YouTube videos and channeling rom-com inspirations and her parents’ love for ’90s alt-rock into grainy recordings. The first song she wrote, “Coffee,” was loosely based off the first song she learned on guitar, Sixpence None the Richer’s “Kiss Me.” In a fittingly cinematic escalation, “Coffee” found minor success on YouTube before the Canadian rapper Powfu interpolated it into a lo-fi hip-hop track. His remix exploded on TikTok, eventually landing Kristi’s gentle strumming in a Dunkin’ commercial. With just two chords and a shoddy amateur recording, Beabadoobee had begun soundtracking the lives of her peers. Her viral success attracted the attention of Dirty Hit, the British power-pop label behind the 1975 and Wolf Alice. With their backing, Kristi released 2018’s Patched Up and 2019’s Loveworm and Space Cadet EPs, each straying further from the sheepish melancholy of bedroom pop. By the latter, she had perfected a combination of grunge’s quiet-loud dynamics and the faux disaffection of pop-punk. Like a well-curated For You page or the soundtrack to a Fox Searchlight film, Kristi’s music is adorned in pop culture references: “I wish I was Stephen Malkmus,” she cried out on her eponymous 2019 single. Fake It Flowers builds on the ambitions of those releases, pairing her knack for knock-out choruses with violins, handclaps, and Slumberland-worthy reverb. But rather than attempting mimicry, Kristi cherry-picks the most potent elements of her broader ’90s palette for maximum impact. For young millennials and Gen X spawn who, like her, grew up on an eclectic diet of Avril Lavigne and the Cranberries, the melodies are immediately comforting. With the aid of producer Pete Robertson (formerly of British punk revivalists the Vaccines), the album is relentless in its pursuit of a massive hook. “Worth It” refashions the lush strings of Britpop into a climactic motif that builds with each arena-sized refrain; “Charlie Brown” pairs subdued verses with simple, shout-along chorus, practically built for Kristi’s imaginary big screen getaway-car syncs. And where “Coffee” and other early singles relied on predictable chord progressions, Kristi reaches for open tunings and sly tempo changes on “Dye It Red” and “Care,” achieving an intuitive approach to pop that still scans as left-of-center. But like a good soundtrack in a CW drama, her music still operates best in the background. Despite her love for ’90s alt-rock poets, a closer listen reveals her writing to be disappointingly prosaic. Her lyrics seem designed for shape, rather than color, rising to the level of math class margin notes and locker graffiti: “Kiss my ass/You don’t know jack,” she sings on “Dye It Red,” with almost comically sentimental delivery. The album is broadly about the trials and tribulations of young love, specifically with boyfriend Soren Harrison, but it rarely escapes the most straightforward expression of those thoughts—“It’s hard cause it sucks,” she moans on “Further Away”; “I think I want to marry him,” she sings blissfully on “Yoshimi, Forest, Magdalene.” “Horen Sarrison” (get it?) leans more heavily on figures of speech, offering a glimpse of poetic potential in the doe-eyed metaphors of its verses: “You are the smell of pavement after the rain/You are the last empty seat on a train,” Kristi sings, a welcome moment of intimacy in a record made up of tossed-off generalizations. In the editing room, it would be easy to cut to her outsized choruses, but in real time, her greenness is harder to ignore. Fake It Flowers is an album of vibes: It uses the slanted melodies and flannel-loving aesthetics of alternative rock in service of pop hooks that are almost impressively simplistic and repetitive. The hope, as Kristi tells it, is that you sing these songs into your mirror, blast them in your car, and scribble them into a diary post-breakup. Too often, she jumps to John Hughes-ian climaxes without laying the foundation that would grant them the proper emotional heft. But Kristi shines as a guitarist and a composer; even the sternest skeptics might be forced to headbang once the power chords crash in on a particularly distorted chorus. Beabadoobee needs to punch up her script, but the set is perfectly lit.","Inspired by rom-coms and Kimya Dawson, Gen Z songwriter Bea Kristi uses the slanted melodies and flannel-loving aesthetics of ’90s alternative rock in service of massive pop hooks.

Stay Alive,Laura Jane Grace,by: Evan Rytlewski,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f88698286e497a31b6cefbd/1:1/w_160/stay%20alive_laura%20jane%20grace.jpg,2020-10-20 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/laura-jane-grace-stay-alive/,Polyvinyl,"Is there a producer better cut out for the pandemic than Steve Albini? The famously hands-off engineer has been keeping a safe distance from bands in his studio since well before the CDC was advising it, and the coronavirus hasn't changed his process much. As Laura Jane Grace tells it, masks aside, the recording sessions for her first solo album Stay Alive weren't all that different from the usual Albini productions: no computers, no overdubs, no wasted time or niceties. They tracked the album in just two days. “I could kind of tell that if I did more than two takes, he got annoyed,” Grace told Rolling Stone. Stay Alive is not the album Grace hoped to record this year. She intended these songs for Against Me!'s first album since 2016's Shape Shift With Me, but the pandemic uprooted those plans, stranding her band in separate parts of the country. Rather than let her songs grow cold, she committed them to this largely acoustic set, an austere shadow of the electric Against Me! record that might have been. Save for an occasional primitive drum machine or amplifier, it's largely just Grace's graveled voice and her six-string guitar—her rawest recording since the very earliest years of Against Me!, when the band was essentially a folk-punk solo project. Despite the spartan setup, Stay Alive doesn't shy from volume. Grace pitches her voice somewhere between a bark and a roar, intermittently channeling the uninhibited wail of The Mountain Goats' John Darnielle. At its best the session has the intimacy and power of a living room concert; at other times it's more like a subway busker performing too loud for passersby who won't make eye contact. Although these songs were written before Covid-19, Grace uses them to process the shock of our new normal, conjuring the helplessness of those first few weeks of lockdown in particular. “This only feels like the death of everything,” she snarls on the hard-strummed opener “Swimming Pool Song.” On “The Calendar Song,” she longs for travel, fantasizing about the tropical warmth of Portugal or the vibrant green pastures of Glasgow. Cabin fever hangs over the entire album. “There's always someone dying to leave where you're dying to get to,” she sings on “Shelter in Place,” yet another song that somehow predates the pandemic, despite lyrics like “my own private paradise quarantine is very nice.” Generally the ferocity of the performances make more of an impression than the songs themselves. Though it doesn't mince words about Donald Trump's flirtations with white supremacy, “Hanging Tree” once again lays to waste the idea that his election was somehow going to usher in a golden age of protest music. “You're tweet-tweet-tweeting from a golden tower/Ain't got no soul to sell and that's your power,” Grace sneers. She's got the conviction, but it's hard for even the boldest songwriters to lobby a critique of this guy that isn't already expressed hundreds of times an hour online. COVID-19 has taught us to settle for poor substitutes, because they're all we have—birthday parties with three people, live streams instead of concerts, Zoom happy hours instead of real ones. So perhaps it's in the spirit of the times that, like almost everything in our lives right now, Grace's solo debut feels like an unceremonious consolation. Once the allure of hearing Grace so stripped down wears off, the record begins to sound like what it is: glorified demos for an Against Me! album we'll never get to hear. Even at its most vital, Stay Alive never escapes the sense that the pandemic has one again cheated us out of something better.","The Against Me! frontwoman intended to record these bracing songs with her main band before the pandemic sidelined that plan. Her austere solo version feels like a pale shadow of the real thing.

Sundowner,Kevin Morby,by: Sophie Kemp ,Contributor ,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f8497e286e497a31b6cedf7/1:1/w_160/sundowner_kevin%20morby.jpg,2020-10-19 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/kevin-morby-sundowner/,Dead Oceans,"Kevin Morby writes love songs about places. On Singing Saw, it was California. On Harlem River and City Music, it was New York City. On his latest record, Sundowner, it’s Kansas, with its endless stretches of highway and shocking pink sunsets. Morby grew up in Kansas City, and recently returned there after a multi-year stint on the West Coast. Sundowner is his homecoming, an indie folk record with tinges of country rock that feels like looking at an old postcard. At times, it’s so dedicated to late-’60s pastiche that it becomes too precious, like little more than a study of influences. Mostly, though, it is a perfect afternoon under a big blue sky, a vision of the Midwest that feels mythical and enormous. Sundowner corrects the course after 2019’s Oh My God, which seesawed from huge, pinwheeling Sticky Fingers arrangements to half-baked Transformer karaoke. Morby sounded lost, unsure of what kind of music he wanted to make. Sundowner is sharper, more in sync with his previous records. It’s certainly referential, but it’s hardly completely retro. On opener “Valley,” an estuary of Mellotron pours into a crystal sea of guitar. Morby sings of the stars above him, and the valley beneath. His voice sounds weary and reedy as ever, and then it cuts out, allowing a guitar to split the night sky in two. “Campfire,” with hushed vocals from Katie Crutchfield and field recordings from an actual campfire, feels like a constellation of three songs wrapped up in one. The Mellotron takes the lead for the ending, the album’s prettiest, quivering as the song shifts into a waltz that feels like crossing dewy grass with a blanket draped over your shoulders. The more uneven moments threaten to undermine Morby’s strongest songs. “Brother, Sister” belongs in a tacky old Western movie, with drums that boom like thunderclaps and a goofy yelp at the end. Much of the song involves Morby singing “bum buh duh bum,” or, “Oh brother/They killed you dead,” like a small-town sheriff with a handlebar mustache. While his penchant for all things retro is usually compelling, here it’s so painstakingly recreated that it’s a little ridiculous. “Velvet Highway,” a fully instrumental track, runs into a similar problem. It starts off with languid, dreamy keys, then disintegrates into weird percussion and what sounds like someone jabbing the highest notes on an old piano. This is where Morby runs into trouble: by leaning too heavily on tropes from the past, he misses the opportunity to bricolage with the present. He’s at his best when he writes the character studies that have become almost a signature of his career. Often they are called by their first names: On Sundowner, we meet Jamie, who died when he was 25; Desi, who became a mermaid; and Jessi, the one with the beautiful voice. Morby loves them all; you can see them flash in front of your eyes like old Super 8 footage. The record’s most vivid and potent moment comes on the melodramatic, seven-minute-long “A Night at the Little Los Angeles.” Morby imagines a girl smoking cigarettes on Mulholland, beaches of sugar, the soft sound of people having sex in the next room. He notices things that are hard to catch: a tightness in his chest; background conversations with a hotel clerk; the infinite stretch of Kansas. His observations require perception—perhaps Morby’s greatest skill as a musician. Plenty of what he sees is mundane, but it’s Morby’s gift that the quotidian never feels boring.","An indie folk record with tinges of country rock, the songwriter’s latest album pays tribute to his Kansas City home with a vision of the Midwest that feels mythical and enormous.

"Streams of Thought, Vol. 3: Cane & Able EP",Black Thought ,by: Stephen Kearse,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f43c860094969ebce91b3d7/1:1/w_160/streams%20of%20thought%20vol%203_black%20thought.jpg,2020-10-19 05:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/black-thought-streams-of-thought-vol-3-cane-and-abel-ep/,Republic,"One of the most hair-raising moments in the Roots’ extensive catalog is “75 Bars (Black’s Reconstruction),” a muscular showcase for Black Thought. His feverish extended verse hits like a crash landing, every word a plume of flame. In the six years since the last Roots album, Black Thought has turned the intensity of “75 Bars” into his calling card, transforming freestyles and guest spots into athletic events. Streams of Thought Vol. 3: Cane and Able both continues that tradition and attempts to depart from it. The record largely stays true to the format established by volumes one and two, privileging formless energy over structure. Roughly half the songs here are composed of one dense, winding verse. The EP also continues the convention of Thought working with one main producer. After 9th Wonder and Salaam Remi, here he teams with storied Bad Boy producer Sean C of the Hitmen, who provides a textured but unobtrusive canvas on which Black Thought can think out loud. He’s got a lot on his mind. Personal relationships, his legacy, and race are frequent subjects, mostly in quick flashes. His writing has become showy lately, sometimes undermining its sharpness. Too often, that tendency leads him toward filler, as on “State Prisoner” where he goes full Rap God: “In conclusion, I wanna clear the confusion/Any rumors the artist you’re currently hearing is human.” Likewise, “Thought vs Everybody” begins with him on a throne (which has become a recurring image of him lately) and runs the theme of greatness into the ground. “Am I a journal or journalist? Herbal eternalist/Olympic tournament level genius author, affirmative,” he raps. He sounds more stoned than omnipotent. The record is more interesting when the Herculean feats of lyricism take a back seat to introspection. “We Could Be Good (United)” places his marriage under a microscope, acknowledging the strain that the Roots’ grueling schedule can place on a relationship. “Magnificent” is an origin story of sorts, establishing a slope for Black Thought’s ascent from mortal to deity. Through hip-hop, he recounts, he went from drug addiction and self-harm to pride, a transformation he likens to Detroit Red and LeRoi Jones becoming Malik el-Shabazz and Amiri Baraka. “Nature Of the Beast,” a somber collaboration with Portugal The Man and The Last Artful, Dodgr, features him delicately singing of alienation and stage fright, a rare moment of vulnerability. 
The record’s highlight is “Fuel,” another team-up with Portugal The Man and The Last Artful, Dodgr, that finds Black Thought seeking penitence. The lush, gospel-inflected production stretches out his cadences, making his performance less streamlined and mechanical. He remains guarded, but you can feel the weariness in his voice, the hesitance in his word choices. That ability to use words as textures as much as tools has always been a hallmark of his style; without that internal balance, a hip-hop band never could have worked. Ultimately, it’s that ingrained instinct that saves from Vol 3. from falling prey to the same monotony and excess as an Eminem or Royce album. Though “75 Bars (Black’s Reconstruction)” is powered by Black Thought’s exquisite prowess, it still moves like a Roots song. Catch up every Saturday with 10 of our best-reviewed albums of the week.

lil kiiwi,Kiiara,by: Larisha Paul,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f848d9b46ede078a46472e8/1:1/w_160/lil%20kiiwi_Kiiara.jpg,2020-10-19 05:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/kiiara-lil-kiiwi/,Atlantic,"In June 2015, a 20-year-old singer named Kiara Saulters uploaded the song “Gold” to SoundCloud under the moniker Kiiara. Its chorus had a trance-like pull, chopping up vocals and splicing them into an indecipherable hyperpop concoction. Within a year, Kiiara had landed a deal with Atlantic, and “Gold” was climbing the Billboard Hot 100 chart, where she found herself in the company of once-rising contemporaries Olivia O’Brien and Halsey. The popularity of “Gold” threatened to define her career, though she already considered it to be old before it had even reached its peak. In the age of viral hits, artists like Kiiara are often forced to milk the moment or risk becoming one-hit wonders, with little room to grow into their sound. Lil Kiiwi is a promising reintroduction to Kiiara, who, at 25, is now making pop music that grapples with the impulsiveness of her early 20s. Having spent three years releasing one-off singles that experimented with hyperpop, alternative R&B, and rock, she now ditches the chopped vocals in favor of whispered admissions over lo-fi beats and plucky electro-pop. Lil Kiiwi carves out a sustainable space for Kiiara in the modern pop canon, so long as she doesn’t fall victim to low-hanging, predictable clichés. Kiiara can be a captivating storyteller when she fully commits to the song. Across the album, she takes on the role of a vengeful ex, cuts down the egos of men, and escapes into drugs to avoid confronting her own feelings. Her music is most effective when she reflects on past relationships—the ones that failed, those that could have been, and others that never should have happened. On “Accidental,” she owns up to sabotaging a potential relationship by being dismissive and manipulative, but ultimately deflects and fumbles her attempted apology: “The drugs fucked my head up/Why did you let me?/Why didn’t you come and get me?” She sings about wanting to resist an attraction to danger. But when her lyrics consider the possibility of what could have been had she chosen differently in various scenarios, they’re heavy with remorse and angst. When Kiiara blames her actions on being intoxicated or emotionally unavailable, her impulsivity is chalked up to her being young and overwhelmed with life; but the haze dissipates as she analyzes these moments and past relationships with maturity. A sense of loneliness echoes throughout “Never Let You” as she yearns for a do-over of her career, relationships, and college. Defeat piles up with each line of the ballad “Empty,” where she resents sacrificing so much of herself for a love that left her drained, and she wonders, “Where were you on my darkest day?” Rather than bringing the same intensity of these unshielded emotions to her rousing hyperpop performances, Kiiara hides behind the pervasive clichés of influencer culture and the digital age. “So Sick” recruits blackbear to complain about the toxicity of using Instagram to keep tabs on an ex. Elsewhere, Felix Snow haunts the album on the 2017 leftover “Whippin’,” which attempts to replicate “Gold” but sounds stale more than five years later. Kiiara does better in the company of collaborators who play to her charm instead of watering it down. On “I Still Do,” electro-pop drops bounce as she sings about still loving someone who betrayed her trust. Kiiara could have easily built an album out of the one-off singles released in recent years, but on Lil Kiiwi, she makes a true effort at encapsulating the past five years of her life, how they changed her, and what she learned in the process.","The pop singer’s debut is a promising reintroduction that shows her emotional and melodic strengths if she can avoid the clichés of influencer culture and the digital age.

TOCSIN,Patrick Higgins,by: Jonathan Williger,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f85f27a29dd317c0d5192b7/1:1/w_160/tocsin_patrick%20higgins.jpg,2020-10-19 05:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/patrick-higgins-tocsin/,Telegraph Harp,"Patrick Higgins composes with a scholar’s historical perspective and a punk’s sense of abandon. While many avant-garde musicians strive for originality by incorporating elements from outside Western tradition—or scrapping tradition altogether—Higgins melds the elegance of baroque chamber music, the colorful dissonance of Krystof Penderecki and Edgard Varèse, and the unrestrained discord of contemporary noise music, bending stylistic tropes from each era towards a central aesthetic meeting point. One of his most fascinating releases, Early Music, is a collaboration with violinist Josh Modney in which the duo fuses Renaissance forms with digital processing and the serrated edge of electric guitar. There are moments on Bachanalia, his album of radical reinterpretations for guitar from across Bach’s oeuvre, where the addition of delay and other electronic effects contorts the well-worn compositions into something resembling 20th century minimalism. Higgins’ influences are canonical, but he approaches them with as much skepticism as reverence. Bach again provides the jumping-off point for TOCSIN, Higgins’ most ambitious and wide-reaching collection of original compositions. The album contains three distinct multi-movement pieces, but it begins with an arrangement of Contrapunctus XIV, an unfinished fugue written at the end of Bach’s life, performed by Mivos Quartet. The piece ends abruptly in the middle of a phrase, alluding to the alternate meaning of “fugue”: a sudden dissociation or break in the normative perception of reality. In the album’s liner notes Higgins asserts that his own compositions take that bruised silence and use it as a mandate to explore “the question of death, the task of ritual, and the crisis of representation in our contemporary world.” The album’s title, meanwhile, invokes the act of ringing an alarm bell, although the urgency it suggests is dampened slightly by the quartet’s somewhat leaden performance of this fragmentary opening piece. As a conceptual hinge, however, Higgins’ framing of the piece is inspired. Higgins’ own compositions are turbulent and insistent. “SQ3,” performed again (and more persuasively) by Mivos Quartet, is filled with uncomfortable stillnesses and bursts of agitated frenzy emerging from that initial crack of silence galvanized by Bach’s death. The suite is divided into four movements, each retaining the same eerie atmosphere but varying in structure and tumult. Higgins pushes the players to cacophonic extremes only to pull them back into a shadowy quiet, the strings groaning to life like a ferocious animal struggling to overcome the effects of a sedative. In the second movement, dissonant, droning crescendos dissolve into fits of pizzicato that then crumple back into silence. It is only with the piece’s final movement, allusively titled “Fugue (Burial),” that Higgins turns to more structured notions of harmonic and melodic development; even then the framework dissolves in the piece’s final minutes, returning to powerful thuds of clustered tones and screeching wails. “Tocsin,” the album’s double-movement centerpiece for two cellos and piano, benefits from the spotlight on prodigious pianist Vicky Chow, whose exactitude and expressive instincts transform what might otherwise be obtuse into a riveting thrill ride. Her instrument is prepared with objects that transform specific keys into gamelan-like plinks, which come into play in the quietest and most chaotic moments, adding a surrealist bent. Higgins is a technically virtuosic guitarist, and his propensity for disorienting complexity shines in moments when the instruments coalesce into pulsing patterns of indeterminate beats that dance about wildly before collapsing in on themselves. Compared to “SQ3,” the chaos in “Tocsin” feels controlled. Rather than diminish its impact, that precision offers a more approachable entry into the clamorous world that Higgins has built. Higgins composed and premiered these pieces in 2015 and 2016—a period when, in the U.S., an old way of being was snapped in half, and a new period of turmoil was intensifying. The music on TOCSIN, charged with brutality and unease, feels like an acknowledgement of the cycles of crisis and change confronting us in the new decade. Alarm bells ring and ring and ring, over and over, but there is force in Higgins’ portrayal of both moments of rupture and the determination to continue on.","With a title invoking alarm bells, this ambitious collection of the New York composer’s work is turbulent and disorienting, suggesting cycles of crisis and change.

Listen Like Thieves,INXS,by: Steve Kandell,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f85e8ed46ede078a46473a0/1:1/w_160/listen%20like%20thieves_INXS.jpg,2020-10-18 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/inxs-listen-like-thieves/,WEAAtlantic,"At the 1996 BRIT Awards, INXS lead singer Michael Hutchence gave an amiable fist-pump as he announced the winner for Best Video, Oasis’ “Wonderwall.” Moments later, Noel Gallagher, clutching the BRIT and smiling cocainely, sneered, “Has-beens shouldn’t present fuckin’ awards to gonna-bes.” At the time, the slag was simply on-brand petulance, all part of the Gallagher brothers’ calculated and successful anti-charm offensive, yet it hit a nerve. INXS’ most recent album, the grunge-bandwagoning Full Moon, Dirty Hearts, had come out in 1993, marking their longest period of dormancy amid no small amount of personal turmoil; in a year and a half, Hutchence would be dead. Nearly 22 years later—and 11 since Oasis were gonna be anything but broken up—the insult is still a cheap shot, but it also feels in league with a broader cultural dismissal of a band whose legacy feels more complicated than a mere 15-year run of singles. From 1980 to 1984, INXS were a likeable, unassuming Australian pub band turned New Romantic synth-pop strivers with a handful of good songs and one perfect one. From 1987 to 1997, they minted hits seemingly at will behind a swaggering, came-with-the-frame picture of a louche rock star, filling stadiums before riding diminishing returns to a tragic end. In between, they made one pivotal album that mined the hookiest qualities of the former iteration while laying the groundwork for the latter. Stacked with eminently catchy songs from top to bottom that sound evergreen in ways that evaded so much pop music from the same era, Listen Like Thieves is a classic “verge album”—think Fleetwood Mac, Soundgarden’s Badmotorfinger, R.E.M.’s Green, or U2’s The Unforgettable Fire—a mid-career highlight where a fully formed, fully confident band finds its footing at the precipice of something much bigger and maybe just beyond their control. By their fifth album, INXS were known entities, products of and grist for the nascent MTV juggernaut thanks in large part to frontman Michael Hutchence’s basic-cable charisma and moves like Jagger. Shabooh Shoobah, from 1982, introduced the band via the video for “The One Thing,” in which a black-tie banquet erupts into a bacchanalian food fight, replete with shots of Hutchence eye-fucking the camera and a woman defiling a fig. Their following album, 1984’s The Swing, went double platinum in Australia, thanks in no small part to marquee assists from fellow blue-eyed soul purveyor Daryl Hall and, more crucially, Nile Rodgers’ production on “Original Sin.” The album was a conscious effort to further blend rock and funk and at least indirectly channel Talking Heads’ Remain in Light. The Farriss brothers—guitarist Tim, keyboardist and songwriter Andrew, and drummer Jon—along with multi-instrumentalist Kirk Pengilly and incredibly named bassist Garry Gary Beers, had spent years grinding in bars and clubs across Australia, but the producer enlisted for the follow-up to The Swing didn’t hear any of that grit, or Hutchence’s obvious sex appeal, in those records. A couple hit singles aside, the album didn’t do huge numbers in the U.S. or the UK. “To me, The Swing had nothing to do with what the band was doing live,” famed producer Chris Thomas said in the band’s 2005 memoir. “That album doesn’t sound like a rock’n’roll show at all. The gig I saw at the Hollywood Bowl was a dangerous concert—grown women were throwing themselves at the stage. I hadn’t seen a gig that exciting or a band having that kind of effect on people in years.” Thomas worked on the White Album and Abbey Road and Dark Side of the Moon, then went on to produce four Roxy Music albums and Never Mind the Bollocks, as well as all three Pretenders albums, culminating in 1984’s crossover Learning to Crawl—a dream CV to take on a band navigating the moat between mannered new wave and swing-for-the-fences rock, and he held that spot for the three-album run that definitively reinvented INXS. What Thomas was implicitly advocating for over the course of three months in Sydney’s Rhinoceros Studio was an album built out of “Don’t Change.” The final track on Shabooh Shoobah and the band’s usual set-closer, it’s the kind of feel-good, brawny U2 anthem that U2 have spent decades trying to write. Still driven by Andrew’s keyboards, “Don’t Change” felt leaner and less fussed over, destined to be covered by, among many, many others, Bruce Springsteen, a man who also spent a lot of time in 1984 and 1985 thinking about what rock songs for the masses should look like. The song’s DNA is evident in “This Time,” about as uplifting a breakup song as anyone will ever require, from the isolated-riff intro to the slow but cathartic build. “Kiss the Dirt (Falling Down the Mountain)” and the title track follow similar scripts; they don’t necessarily sound like “Don’t Change,” or like one another, but they share a penchant for climactic escalation tricks—a head-fake key change here, an extra-soaring chorus there—that pulled off the even neater trick of not sounding like tricks and not being overly laminated in studio polish. There was an ease to the songs that belied their ambition. Even the songs that managed to not be huge hits were as catchy as the ones that were. The smoldering “Same Direction” and “Shine Like It Does,” the brassy “One X One,” and ripping closer “Red Red Sun” were stripped of the kind of studio gloss that might have been applied on past records, and have aged better because of it. Pengilly’s saxophone flourishes nearly save the instrument from punk-rock punchline status. While The Swing’s “Original Sin” and “Dancing on the Jetty” broadly gestured at social issues (institutional racism and war and strife, respectively), Listen Like Thieves had no particular flag to wave or message to send beyond the one that would propel them for the rest of their career: Michael Hutchence fucks. As much as INXS operated and presented as a proper tight-knit and deeply skilled band, with shared songwriting credits and half its members literal kin, they thrived once they figured out how to nudge Hutchence even further front and center without disrupting the balance, and once he fully embraced it. (“I really am a great fucking rock star,” he told Q in 1993.) But before he shacked up in a French villa with Helena Christensen or corrupted Kylie Minogue or took a guy on tour with him for the express purpose of supplying ecstasy, Hutchence had to shed the last of his new wave chrysalis, grow out his mullet, embrace tank tops, and lean into the whole disco-Morrison thing. “What You Need” was that nudge. The first song on Listen Like Thieves was the last one recorded for the album, a quick cure for what was diagnosed as I-don’t-hear-a-single-itis that wound up changing the band’s lives forever. Thomas had Andrew dust off a demo labeled “Funk Song No. 13,” which contained the slinky two-chord guitar riff to what would very quickly become “What You Need”—an eminently danceable no-brainer that landed in the Top 5 in America, cast Hutchence’s casual lustfulness as a halo around the band, and cemented Hutchence and Andrew Farriss as the band’s principal songwriters. Of all the members of INXS, Andrew was the one who seemed the least like Hutchence, and the least likely to be the driving force behind a libidinous multi-platinum rock band; his brothers were naturally hammier and looked the part, while he seemed content to be the introvert tucked behind stacks of expensive-looking keyboards. (His floppy safari hat in the “Don’t Change” video should go down in the annals of Why Didn’t Anyone Say No to This?) But the duo’s chemistry was recognized and elevated as the band’s secret weapon. Thomas returned to produce 1987’s Kick, which, not all that implicitly, was built out of “What You Need,” particularly in regard to blockbuster lead singles with crystalline, ambiently funky guitar riffs and the word “need” in the title. (Rather than leave anything to chance, 1990’s X featured basically a third iteration of this rollout plan with “Suicide Blonde.”) Doubling down on the use of Hutchence’s face as the band’s identity, Kick sold tens of millions of copies and established the visual aesthetic that would define INXS until Hutchence’s death. Kick wears some of the sonic pockmarks of its era in a way that Listen Like Thieves doesn’t, and made INXS both a bigger success and a bigger target. If anyone wanted for any reason to scoff at the spectacle of a tousle-haired rock god whose shirts all appeared cursed with non-functioning buttons lounging in the south of France with supermodel girlfriends, INXS provided. Hutchence’s charm, however, lay in the fact that he seemed in on the gag; excess was baked into the band’s name. And he was just vexingly likeable. If anyone used that spectacle as an excuse to dismiss the workmanlike ease with which they churned out hit after hit, that is understandable, but a shame. Though they didn’t have the impact of the three they made with Chris Thomas, the band’s final albums with Hutchence yielded songs that outlast the legacies of the albums themselves. “Heaven Sent,” from 1992’s Welcome to Wherever You Are, is as good a pop song as any made in the past 30 years, and yet it somehow feels like an afterthought in their own estimable discography. INXS’ rise to massive global financial concern wasn’t without its collateral damage: At the height of American Idol mania in 2004, the surviving members recruited a new singer via network TV reality show; 2005’s Switch, with JD Fortune, mostly just furthers the argument that Hutchence’s chemistry and charisma can’t be recruited. Which is why Listen Like Thieves feels like a moment worth preserving—a snapshot of a band finding its voice and its lane in real time and figuring out how to do something that seems nearly beyond comprehension 35 years later. There are no heirs apparent. The 1975 have the big-tent ambition and certainly the look, but are complicated and navel gaze-y in a way INXS never seemed interested in. The Killers have the chart success but a decidedly Mormon interpretation of sex appeal. Coldplay have to work too hard to convince you that they’re any fun. Spoon have the songs and the hooks and the decades of consistency that make them easy to overlook, but not the actual hits. (Oh god, is it Maroon 5?) But the notion of sex, drugs, and dance-oriented, innocuous, hugely popular rock’n’roll as a formula for a decades-long career in some ways died with Hutchence. This almost sounds like a backhanded compliment now but it should be a badge of honor: INXS were a very good band that was very good at their job and that no longer really exists.

Wildflowers & All the Rest (Deluxe Edition),Tom Petty,by: Sam Sodomsky,Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f84d3f346ede078a46472fb/1:1/w_160/wildflowers%20&%20all%20the%20rest_tom%20petty.jpg,2020-10-17 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/tom-petty-wildflowers-and-all-the-rest-deluxe-edition/,Warner,"Imagine the scene: It’s 1994 and Tom Petty is presenting his new solo album Wildflowers to the suits at Warner Bros. He’s been working on this music for two years with a new collaborator, producer Rick Rubin, and he is excited. He presses play. The first thing you hear is the title track, which sounds like a folk standard. Next, you hear “You Don’t Know How It Feels,” with its booming drums and wrecking ball of a chorus; it sounds like a hit single. Then you hear 23 more songs. It’s amazing, the label says, but it’s too long. Somehow, the artist sitting across the table—43 years old; a friend and collaborator of Roy Orbison, Bob Dylan, George Harrison, and Johnny Cash; an artist who has spent his decades-long career demanding control over everything with his name on it, right down to the price of his albums—agrees. Wildflowers is released that fall; 15 tracks, 63 minutes. It goes triple platinum and many considered it his masterpiece. The further that Tom Petty got from Wildflowers, the more admiration he felt for it, and the less he understood it. In later conversations with Rubin, he admitted to feeling slightly intimidated: not sure he could ever top it, uncertain where it came from. In the last years of Petty’s life, he spoke optimistically about revisiting the material for a box set and maybe a tour. It was the next thing on his list. Three years after his death, we have Wildflowers & All the Rest, the immersive collection Petty had in mind, curated by his family and bandmates. It includes, along with the album itself, finally back on vinyl, All the Rest: a 10-song set of outtakes, forming a solid studio album that Petty considered releasing under the name Wildflowers 2. Then there’s Home Recordings, which compiles Petty’s intimate solo demos from the era. Next is Live Wildflowers, a thrilling collection that shows how audiences around the world received this material on stage over the span of two decades. And finally, there’s Alternative Versions (Finding Wallflowers), where you hear Petty and his bandmates experiment with the songs in the studio: a set of performances notable for their minor variations in lyrics and arrangement (and, in one instance, because Ringo Starr is playing drums). It is a lot to take in. Of course, even before this collection, Wildflowers was overwhelming by design. There are classic albums that feel carved in stone, where every note seems purposeful in communicating a point: your Born to Run’s or Blue’s or Petty’s own Damn the Torpedoes. And then there are albums like this, where the messiness is the point: you come to hear an artist indulge in whatever spirit strikes them in the studio that day. It’s the type of album where one song might be a hopeless acoustic ballad inspired by John Fahey, but the song directly before it might involve goofy non sequiturs about sex while someone rips a guitar solo. It’s a sprawling quality inherent to the album that makes this box set feel less like a curio for obsessives than a deep interrogation into its success. Like the album itself, these recordings are fascinating, fun, and sometimes unsettlingly intimate. “Don’t Fade on Me,” the aforementioned Fahey-inspired ballad, is presented in an early solo rendition where you learn that Petty’s lyrics about a failing romantic relationship actually started as a desperate intervention from a guitarist to a bassist. (It is particularly unnerving considering Howie Epstein, the bassist in Petty’s own band, the Heartbreakers, was struggling with heroin addiction that would take his life less than 10 years later.) More than any of Petty’s albums, Wildflowers is driven with autobiographical intensity. It’s telling that even in the earliest forms of these songs, he accompanied himself with harmony vocals and 12-string guitar and piano, as if he wanted to make sure even these versions would sound good blasting from a car radio. And yet, the music is filled with details about addiction and divorce (Petty and his first wife Jane separated a year after the album’s release). An outtake called “Harry Green” is a hushed acoustic song about a high school outcast who befriended Petty back in Florida and died by suicide. He is one of many ghosts who haunts this music, even if the song itself may have felt too confessional to include. The other outtakes are less revealing but often remarkable: “Leave Virginia Alone” has a chorus so romantic and sugar-sweet that Petty ended up lending the song to Rod Stewart. “There Goes Angela (Dream Away)” is present only on the Home Recordings set, and it’s a fine addition to Petty’s legacy of gorgeous, stoned lullabies. In the liner notes, bandmate Benmont Tench notes that this release marks his first time hearing the song; he confirms this by noting that, had he heard it earlier, he would have demanded they record it. Because each component of the set feels like its own carefully constructed album, it avoids the historical aura of something like Dylan’s Cutting Edge set—where entire studio sessions were presented with incomplete takes and banter. Despite the length (70 songs across 5 hours, in its longest version), it feels designed to be played from front-to-back. For casual fans, all you need is the standard set, which pairs Wildflowers with the 10 outtakes on All the Rest. But there’s no element that feels superfluous, and the very essence of the album is palpable through each part. On the live set, two outtakes find definitive versions: the riotous “Drivin’ Down to Georgia,” where the Heartbreakers explode in the way they only could with an audience cheering them on. And then there’s “Girl on LSD,” a goofy B-side that Petty can barely get through without cracking himself up. “I’m sorry about that,” he deadpans as the audience roars. “I don’t know what happened to me there.” This lightness sustains the set. Take the Home Recordings version of “You Don’t Know How It Feels,” a moodier take on a road trip classic, complete with several discarded lines. “Most things that I worry ’bout/Never happen anyway,“ he sings in a whisper, drawling the syllables through its now-familiar, seesawing melody. Listening to all the bonus discs, it’s a lyric you will hear him try to work into multiple songs. It becomes a kind of mantra, a way to check his anxiety and turn it into something lighter, something you can sing along with. For those of us who have always listened to Tom Petty for this reason, there is comfort in knowing you can turn to Wildflowers. And now, you can live in it.","The new reissue of Tom Petty’s benchmark 1994 solo album has a sprawling quality inherent to the album that makes it feel less like a curio for obsessives than a deep interrogation into its success.

SIGN,Autechre,by: Philip Sherburne,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f85f5bbb1ec0862a4bceaf5/1:1/w_160/sign_autechre.jpg,2020-10-16 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/autechre-sign/,Warp,"Machines don’t care. Self-driving cars, data-harvesting algorithms, Boston Dynamics’ hideous quadrupeds—all these things unnerve us in part because we know that they can’t be trusted. They are indifferent to us by design. Autechre have long played to this unease, channeling the unfathomable depth of machine intelligence into forbiddingly complex music that appears to be the product of pure data, intractable and untamed. Using an inscrutable array of home-brewed software and jury-rigged hardware devices that they refer to simply as “the system,” Sean Booth and Rob Brown put the onomatopoeia back into number-crunching. What is daunting about their work is less the mystery in how it’s made and more the specter of supreme disregard that lurks in the margins of their compositions. Their music can suggest machines running blithely amok, unfazed by the presence of humans, disinclined to kowtow to the human desire for, you know, melody and rhythm. In brief moments of pathos or humor—the apparition of a plaintive synthesizer tone, the momentary outbreak of a groove—the duo’s hands become visible behind the thickets of circuitry. But as their work has grown denser and darker, those moments have become uncommon; it was easy to wonder if Booth and Brown had themselves calcified into silicon. But from the sound of SIGN, something has changed. It’s not just that their music became gradually more byzantine over the last decade, as though their already fractal beats were further splintering, granulated patterns branching into gardens of forking paths. The dimensions of their work sprawled. They quickly followed 2010’s Oversteps with Move of Ten, a 10-track EP as long as many albums. The 4xLP Exai, in 2013, ran two hours long, a feat doubled by the five-part elseq series in 2016, whose running time doubled again with 2018’s absurd, eight-hour NTS Sessions. SIGN, in contrast, is remarkably compact. Breezing through 11 tracks in just over an hour, it is roughly the same length as the last track on the final volume of the NTS Sessions. More importantly, SIGN is surprisingly direct: lean, intermittently sedate, frequently quite pretty. The album begins intimidatingly, with a synthetic growl that might be the heptapods in Arrival discovering the ills of gluten. But then, after a minute and a half of rumbling and clanking, what sounds like a submarine crumpling beneath sea pressure, they unleash a single chord that stands among the most beautiful sounds they have created in 29 years. Out of the groaning of twisted metal bursts an explosion of color, like a cloud of powdered pigment hanging briefly in the air before it dissipates, announcing the tonal palette for the entire album. Across the course of the record, this “basic tonal vocabulary,” as Brown called it in a recent interview (possibly borrowing the term from the UK avant-techno legend Surgeon) boils down to a handful of uncannily vivid textures and sensations: sheet metal, soapstone, and pumice; lozenges growing smaller and smaller; renegade foghorns; the taste of copper. Chaos quickly reasserts itself in the opening track, but that is the only place where the duo’s violent tendencies hold sway; even then, it is as if the beats have been sheared away and sanded down, leaving only the suggestion of great force in the striations left behind. Most of the album is all but beatless. “F7” is a synthesizer etude whose fanfare might not sound out of place in a Michael Mann film, were it not for the perilous detuning and the hollow, buzzing tone, flickering like fluorescent tubes. “si00” chirps and chimes over a muted pulse, like early ’90s ambient techno grown sour; “esc desc” is slow and stately, layered synths slipping between consonance and dissonance like multiple copies of New Order’s “Elegia” being played out of sync. It takes five tracks for Autechre to drop their first real beat, but even here, on “au14,” in which Drexciyan tones bubble to the surface over a rapid-fire 4/4 kick, they seem determined to keep their squirreliest tendencies in check. Every component is perpetually shape-shifting; good luck enumerating all the discrete elements in play, much less tracking their millisecond-by-millisecond mutations. Yet the music flows intuitively. It’s not difficult, simply alive. Something almost like nostalgia occasionally rears its head, a rarity for this duo. The sullen synths of “psin AM” call back to Boards of Canada’s Hi Scores EP, which is unexpected, if only because the Sandison brothers often seemed like Autechre’s docile younger cousins, out daydreaming in fields while Booth and Brown were soldering shortwave radios in the garage. The serene tones of the album’s many beatless tracks spring from the same well as 2008’s contemplative Quaristice and even 1994’s wistful Amber. “Metaz form8,” the album’s gorgeous ambient centerpiece, might be the first Autechre composition you could conceivably play on piano. But that outward simplicity is deceptive. Every repeat play of even the most restrained tracks here turns up new details and new shades. The melodies tend to flock in close formation around narrow bands of tones; the whole album feels like a swarm of insects attempting to carry a tune. Even the softest material on SIGN isn’t all that different from the most austere or amelodic material on NTS Sessions; it’s just been smoothed into a form that catches the light differently, emphasizing continuity over disjunction. They have found new ways to make their favorite materials sing. The album’s shortest track is its most affecting. “gr4” is the most lyrical piece of music Autechre have written in years, with neat contrapuntal motions reminiscent of Baroque music—all buried beneath layers of effects that corrode the orchestral tones into dust. The longer it goes on, the more it feels almost like an actual song. Then, after three minutes, it simply fades away, without ever quite revealing itself. The ending feels sudden and unplanned; you wonder why they chose to cut it here, what happened in the recording of it that they couldn’t have extended it further. But after the last few years’ maximalist bonanza, to be left wanting more is a novel, welcome feeling with Autechre.

Shades,Good Sad Happy Bad,by: Ben Cardew,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f85f435b1e2d332600beb9d/1:1/w_160/shades_good%20sad%20happy%20bad.jpg,2020-10-16 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/good-sad-happy-bad-shades/,Textile,"Some artists make being in a band sound like absolutely the worst thing in the world, but not Good Sad Happy Bad (the new name for a rejiggered Micachu and the Shapes), who make you want to dive, headfirst and blinking, into their grottily inviting world of avant-retro pop. Shades may be the fifth album for Mica Levi and co., but it has the enticing naivety of a debut—a result, perhaps, of structural changes within the band, as keyboardist Raisa Khan moves to lead vocals and CJ Calderwood comes in on saxophone, recorder, and electronics. The key to this youthful buoyancy is a certain embrace of imperfection. Micachu and the Shapes were never exactly the slickest of acts, but Shades is a particularly unselfconscious record, wobbly and wonderful, home to the kind of eccentric ideas, unsteady rhythms, and touches of discordance that more anxious musicians lop off in Pro Tools. “Believe It,” all misshapen ideas and sprightly urgency, could be the first demo of a promising young band before they become embarrassed by their weird edges. It starts with loose cymbal hits, sloppy guitar riffs, and disjointed saxophone skronk before cutting into a melody that sounds—in the very best way—like it was knocked up in 10 minutes on a battered acoustic guitar. The band stumbles through the song like four debutants furtively eyeing each other for chord changes. This scruffy musical charm, mixed with Khan’s rather prim vocals, lends Shades the air of late-’80s/early-’90s guitar music, sitting somewhere between the jangling indie pop of the C86 bands, early shoegaze, and grunge, as seen through the winsome eyes of Graham Coxon’s noisier solo albums. It’s yet another new look for a band that has explored everything from chopped and screwed symphonics to lo-fi hip-hop beats since debuting in 2009, and they wear it extremely well. The continental guitar shelves of “Reaching” are kissing cousins to the somnambulant psychedelia that Kevin Shields and his sleep-crazed crew dreamed up on Isn’t Anything, while “Honey” has the same deliciously polite suggestion of the Velvet Underground that pre-internet favorites like the Darling Buds and the Shop Assistants used to press up on flexi-disc. If Shades was just an indie knockoff it would be fun, untaxing, and ultimately unnecessary—a well-written, retro-fitted guilty pleasure for dreaming of better times. Dig into Shades’ apparent spontaneity, however, and a world of detail emerges. “Blessed” dresses its sweetly insouciant melody in a patchwork quilt of disjointed vocal clips, aquatic effects, and ghostly electronic whoosh, while “Taking” sets a grunge guitar line against a twinkling starscape. Best of all is opener “Do It,” whose detuned chords sparkle against tiny, half-submerged melodies played out on what sounds like synth, flute, and recorder. It helps that Levi is an excellent guitarist, capable of wringing transcendent riffs, dinosaur drones, and detuned sludge out of the instrument; Calderwood’s Fun House saxophone rasp brilliantly offsets Levi’s unpredictable playing. The result is a kind of precise imprecision, as if the band had captured the abandon of their early recordings and then pored over the detail with manic industriousness—tweaking rather than polishing, the better to accentuate the unevenness. Shades is lightning captured in a meticulously painted bottle, and a hell of a good time, to boot.","Mica Levi’s band, formerly known as Micachu and the Shapes, embraces imperfection, evoking late-’80s indie pop in whimsical ideas, unsteady rhythms, and meticulous detailing.

Projections EP,Tomberlin ,by: Dani Blum ,Contributor ,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f85e5e746ede078a464739d/1:1/w_160/projections_tomberlin.jpg,2020-10-16 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/tomberlin-projections-ep/,Saddle Creek,"Sarah Beth Tomberlin wrote hushed, trembling songs about leaving behind faith while working 45 hours a week at a Verizon store and living with her parents in rural Illinois; now, she’s been on Kimmel. She quarantined with Busy Phillips. She toured with the revered indie-rock singer-songwriter Alex G, then asked him to co-produce her new project, Projections, which she recorded in his Philadelphia apartment. It’s not quite fame that Tomberlin’s reached, but Projections arrives at a point where she has more exposure than before, when the stakes are higher. This EP feels like a gift: a package of intricate, mesmerizing tracks, so intimate they sound like secrets. Like her debut At Weddings, the EP finds Tomberlin struggling with abandoning the Baptist church she grew up in.  The most striking song from her past album showed her accepting that hurt was inevitable, that she wanted to stop fearing what she couldn’t control — “To be a woman is to be in pain,” she sang. Tomberlin is often a blunt writer, and Projections is very clear in its premise: she tries to reconcile queerness with her religious past, and to navigate relationships around a sense of impending loss. “It’s all sacrifice and violence/The history of love,” she coos on the opening track, “Hours.” “But remember when we stayed up/And took turns playing songs?”  That mix of profundity — or attempted profundity — with the sweet, banal details of new love is woven throughout the project, and varies in its effectiveness. “When you go you take the sun/And all my flowers die,” she intones awkwardly on “Sin,” redeeming the melodrama with the cutting simplicity of the next line: “So I wait by the window and write some shit and hope that you reply.” Projections gleams when it zooms in like that, unraveling Tomberlin’s internal monologue. She overthinks through much of these songs. Every rush of an instinct must be processed; every lurch towards love, examined. “The night you asked me to hold your keys/ I felt like you wanted me to leave,” she breathes at the start of “Floor.” She watches her lover sleep as the song continues, but can’t allow herself to enjoy the private comfort of the moment: “I felt the quiet/I tried to try it,” she sings, “But my mind was always running crazy loud.” She juxtaposes every passing tenderness with the religious condemnation she’s internalized.  “I never felt ashamed in your embrace,” she sings on “Hours,” and you understand the negative space around that statement. The production helps convey that sense that something sinister is looming, tangled in the background of every intimacy. Alex G’s hallmarks are here: the fuzz that swaddles each song, bandmate Molly Germer’s steady, loping violin. Each track is so richly textured that it blossoms beyond—or despite—Tomberlin’s stark writing. There is always a string plucked somewhere in the background, a bass wriggling under a chorus. Percussive flourishes help telegraph the triumph in the EP’s most upbeat moments—“I don’t mind sinning if it’s with you,” Tomberlin sings, and the ricochet of a drum pattern underscores the accomplishment in that statement. “Wasted”  is a soundtrack for mutely punching a fist above your head when your phone glows with a text back from a crush. There are only five songs on the EP, one of which is a cover of the lo-fi rock band Casiotone for the Painfully Alone. Maybe because of that brevity, Projections offers fewer conclusions than at At Weddings. These tracks cut off just as Tomberlin’s decided she’ll try: to show a lover that she’s stronger now, to not require affirmations of affection. “I just wanna be clean,” she moans, six times in a row at the end of “Sin,” and we don’t learn whether she’s found that through her relationships, or if she’s rejected the yearning for purity altogether. But that’s the beauty in these songs, and the growth that gives them momentum — the shards of clarity that come just with accepting love, the power that comes with naming it.","Like her debut, Sarah Beth Tomberlin’s Alex G-produced new EP finds her struggling with abandoning the Baptist church she grew up in.

Nobody Lives Here Anymore,Cut Worms ,by: Jayson Greene,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f8494911efa8e109cd44f97/1:1/w_160/Nobody%20Lives%20Here%20Anymore_cut%20worms.jpg,2020-10-16 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/cut-worms-nobody-lives-here-anymore/,Jagjaguwar,"The world that Brooklyn-based singer-songwriter Max Clarke builds as Cut Worms is a comforting and familiar one. His nasal, pure-hearted tenor evokes Buddy Holly as surely as a pair of black frame glasses pushed up the bridge of the nose, and the alpine chill, cavernous reverb, and placid stillness of his folk rock instantly recall solo George Harrison. Clarke belongs to a specific lineage of classic-rock devotees—Cass McCombs, Kevin Morby, Whitney—and his records are full of nice, homey, furniture-store qualities: lived-in, grainy, hand-crafted. His music smells like yellowing record sleeves and pleasantly mildewed cellars; you can hear the warmth and spaciousness of the studio he’s strumming his guitar in. Records that sound like this are nearly impossible to dislike, and there is never any shortage of them. There’s always a pocket of singer-songwriters evoking some combination of these 1970s singer-songwriter influences, from the aforementioned George Harrison to Neil Young to Harry Nilsson. Practitioners are usually bearded and, generally speaking, male, and there is a high rate of turnover. Nonetheless, Clarke stands pretty tall in this field. His new record, Nobody Lives Here Anymore, is a double album, that ultimate symbol of classic-rock ambition, and Clarke traveled to fabled territory—Memphis, Tennessee—to record it. You can certainly trek hundreds of miles and record a middling album, but Clarke did not, and his pilgrimage feels like a larger gesture of commitment that contains dozens of smaller similar ones inside it. When you’re trying to sink into an era, your success rate depends largely on your attention to important details, and Clarke’s is impeccable, perhaps attributable in part to his day job as an illustrator. Every element of these songs, whether it’s the perfectly tuned clip-clop of drum sticks and bass evoking Sun Records on “The Heat Is On,” or the early-Beatles backup vocals on “Always on My Mind,” wanders onstage with immaculate timing. Records this handsomely appointed and inviting ask you to settle in. But inside this pleasant atmosphere, and among all these well-worn signifiers, Clarke has passion and vision to burn, and over the course of 17 songs, he seems to hold nothing back. Nobody Lives Here Anymore is an exceptional document of a songwriter and performer allowing all of their instincts and impulses to line up neatly with each other. It’s hard to imagine Clarke making a better or more complete record than this one: The longer it goes on, the richer and deeper it feels, and the more resonant and real Clarke’s imagined world becomes. His strongest point is his ear for melodies. They spill out of him like loose change from turned-out pockets. Some of his songs have two or three of them that feel like whole songs themselves. “All the Roads” is a good example. The verse, which Clarke sings in an appealingly low, silky register over acoustic guitar, feels sinuous enough to hold a three-minute song. But he has a lot more to give us: There are two pre-choruses, each of them soulful enough to serve as real ones, and then a doo-wop-shoo-wop actual chorus that tops the whole thing like caramel drizzle. This easy generosity keeps the album from ever feeling slack or overstuffed, despite its runtime occupying an intimidating slab of your afternoon. It’s a testament to the strength of Clarke’s compositional gifts and his command of mood that even 14 or 15 tracks in, in an album pitched at a consistent campfire glow and midtempo stroll, songs like “The Golden Sky” sound just as fresh as the record’s first notes. Clarke has Cass McCombs’ haunted way with Americana signifiers; in his hands, even a sound as recognizable as a pedal-steel guitar feels dreamlike. His songwriting gift is unforced, probably the greatest compliment you can give to a record like this, which measures its success by how long you want to spend with it without focusing on it too closely. Clarke’s lyrics trade in homilies, and while there are notes of trouble in them that vaguely suggest young people surveying the world in 2020—“Oh my love, what more can we do?/I feel so helpless, don’t you/This whole place began to self-destruct/Long before we ever showed up”—they are couched in phrasing that could just have easily come from a Neil Young record in the ’70s. “Every once in a while, everything comes together/Every once in a while, everything comes out right,” he croons just one song later. On the chorus to “Veteran’s Day,” which could have come from Living in the Material World, Clarke hits the upper reaches of his register, telling us “You don’t know/What this life can do to a fool like me.” A simple sentiment—the simplest—but as Clarke delivers it, it feels as profound, and as resistant to analysis, as a sunset.","The Brooklyn singer-songwriter belongs to a contemporary lineage of classic-rock devotees; his melodic gifts make this double album, recorded in Memphis, exceptionally warm and inviting.

Pleased to Meet Me (Deluxe Edition),The Replacements,by: Elizabeth Nelson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f8493213882634b72e5e117/1:1/w_160/Pleased%20to%20Meet%20Me_the%20replacements.jpg,2020-10-15 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/the-replacements-pleased-to-meet-me-deluxe-edition/,Rhino,"Following a decade of epic reissues, a fraught-but-celebrated reunion tour, and even a planned biopic based on Bob Mehr’s monumentally entertaining and deeply depressing 2016 band history Trouble Boys, the robust lore around the Replacements has, at long last, finally threatened to overwhelm the music itself. Rock’s most melodramatic American act never failed to devalue their achievements with enough bad behavior and shenanigans to all but guarantee that the massive success which should have been theirs would never materialize. More than four decades after their formation, the mythology keeps on expanding, with an ever-growing cottage industry surrounding it. The latest in the band’s series of expanded and repackaged editions comes in the form of the group's 1987 fifth LP, Pleased To Meet Me, the moment in which Paul Westerberg’s punk impulses, pop instincts, and poetic soul came into focus as never before. Every Replacements record is extraordinary in its way, but none exemplifies their garbage-to-grandeur alchemy like Pleased To Meet Me, which rocks like early Kinks, swaggers like T. Rex, and pays tribute to their spiritual godfather Alex Chilton. Recorded by hard-scrabble music lifer Jim Dickinson at Ardent Studios in Memphis, the album was a conscious attempt to attach the band’s legacy to the wellspring city that lay 800 miles down the Mississippi River from their hometown of Minneapolis. As with Dusty Springfield before them, the pilgrimage was an act of communion with the music that had shaped their identity. By 1986, the group’s quixotic determination to both ironically comment upon and simultaneously up the ante on every rock-star-excess cliché had created its first victims. Founding member and lead guitarist Bob Stinson—a musical wildcard with debilitating psychological and addiction issues—was summarily fired from a group that included his younger brother Tommy on bass. This followed the dismissal of longtime manager Peter Jesperson, who carefully nurtured a young Westerberg’s evolving gifts. Such were the emotional contours for the Replacements’ second major-label record, and the one that Warner Brothers badly hoped would break them into the mainstream the way that the band’s friends R.E.M. had done in the previous year. The great, Faces-set-on-fire opener “I.O.U.” simmers with sublimated guilt and explicit anger: “Want it in writing/I owe you nothing.” A lyrical and engaging player long drowned out by Bob Stinson, Paul Westerberg handles the majority of the guitars on Pleased To Meet Me. He offers a killer Johnny Thunders-style solo on the powertrash-classic “Red Red Wine” (decidedly not the Neil Diamond song), chimes away like Roger McGuinn on “Never Mind,”. Some fans lamented the absence of Stinson’s anarchic playing, and future Replacements releases would indeed suffer from a lack of spontaneity. But on Pleased To Meet Me the cleaner playing does nothing to derail the manic energy. Dickinson turned out to be a perfect choice as a producer—unmoved by their antics, perceptive of their strengths, and imbued with vision and patience. Having helmed the hectic sessions for Big Star’s Third and played tack piano on the Stones’ “Wild Horses,” he knew a thing or two about wringing the best out of self-destructive geniuses. After an episode in which Westerberg’s vomit supposedly hit the wall, Dickinson kept the tapes rolling. There was no fresh hell that they could show him, although they certainly tried. The net result of his stewardship is a best-practices onslaught of hooks and aphorisms which arrived in time to inspire Nirvana and Green Day but too soon to capitalize on the mainstream’s growing appetite for aggressive, melodic rock. Highlights abound: “I Don’t Know,” abetted by Steve Douglas’ honking baritone sax, evokes the degenerate strut of Iggy Pop’s The Idiot while hitting upon the unofficial band mantra: “One foot in the door/The other foot in the gutter.” Mood pieces like the endearingly self-effacing barfly vignette “Nightclub Jitters” and the ominous teen-suicide narrative “The Ledge” demonstrate Westerberg pushing himself out of his comfort zone to excellent effect. Meanwhile the album’s two explicit Big Star tributes—the beautifully self-explanatory power-pop confection “Alex Chilton” and the stunning twelve-string ballad “Skyway”—both rank amongst his greatest songs. The expanded edition provides further evidence of the kind of songwriting roll that Westerberg was on in the mid-1980s, a hot streak to rival Bob Dylan in the ’60s or Joni Mitchell in the ’70s. The Replacements’ two previous LPs—1984’s Let It Be and 1985’s Tim—were tour-de-forces that would leave many an artist’s creative coffers barren. The new Pleased To Meet Me set makes it evident that the band arrived in Memphis with inspiration to spare. The unused outtakes are a riot. There are horny burlesque gems like “Lift Your Skirt” and “‘Til We’re Nude,” Slade-style party anthems with names like “Beer for Breakfast” and “Trouble on the Way,” and a polka tune called “All He Wants To Do Is Fish.” On the quieter side, the closely drawn character study “Birthday Gal” and the ruminative “Run for the Country” are Westerberg at his most compellingly tranquil and sentimental. He even conjures the Smiths on the haltingly gorgeous “Learn How To Fail.” Best of all might be the early Tommy Stinson original “Hey Shadow,” on which Westerberg’s understudy lays bare the rock-star-in-his-own-right talents that would later emerge on his solo records. The album’s irresistible closer and coulda-shoulda-been hit single “Can’t Hardly Wait” is a lonely hotel letter sent to a desperately desired lover, set to an ebullient riff which missed the charts at the time but has aged into something like a bona-fide standard. But in 1987, no one had the key to unlocking commercial viability. No less an industry titan than longtime blockbuster producer Jimmy Iovine took a stab at remixing the tune. It was a letter never sent. Everyone at Sire tried. The band added crackerjack guitarist Bob “Slim” Dunlap and toured relentlessly, a weird comet-sighting for everyone who witnessed it, but not enough did. None of the four singles released gained meaningful traction. Pleased To Meet Me sold roughly 300,000 copies, well short of expectations. Warner Brothers didn’t have the platinum hit they had hoped for. But they did have an instant classic. And maybe, in their Russian Roulette way, the Replacements were always playing the long game. As any number of their more commercially successful peers slide ever more into the gaping maw of cultural obsolescence, now it’s all Replacements all the time. Against all odds, they’ve got both feet in the door.","The latest in the band’s series of expanded editions focuses on their second major-label record, the moment in which Paul Westerberg’s punk impulses, pop instincts, and poetic soul came into focus as never before.

Dark Hearts,Annie,by: Katherine St. Asaph,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f7c93983bf5d47643a70d03/1:1/w_160/dark%20hearts_annie.jpg,2020-10-15 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/annie-dark-hearts/,self-released,"More than a few of us, these days, have been keeping an unusual, deliberate focus on our memories as they form: which ones we'd keep, which ones we’d prefer to destroy, whether any were worth keeping at all, and how they’ll come out decades later. What we might be left with, the research suggests, are “smudged reproductions”: memories recalled through a fogged-over lens, hazier than life. Dark Hearts, Annie’s first album in about a decade, is formed entirely of these smudged reproductions. The Norwegian singer is best known for crafting pop at an arch, ironic remove, but her new album recalls the song that, until now, was her outlier: “Anthonio,” a song conceived as an imagined perfume commercial. Dark Hearts, written with The Sound of Arrows’ Stefan Storm and recorded in a haunted house, is a whole album of this: fever-dream pop. Opener “In Heaven” sets the mood: a slow-dance ballad heard through a funeral shroud. The low strobing synths and processing on Annie’s voice melt away as the complications disappear from the lyrics, leaving a swooning chorus. It’s ’80s cheese, but it’s cheese with the finest presentation: the ABBA-esque melodies of “Corridors of Time,” the Burt Bacharach sway of “It’s Finally Over,” the last-prom-dance synths throughout, and at the Gouda apex, the entirety of “The Streets Where I Belong.” Over an “Every Breath You Take” guitar chug, Annie recalls an affair, then sweeps away the fourth wall for her dream lover to play guitar hero: “Take it away, Johnny!” Almost every song finds Annie reminiscing about the past, or more precisely, casting her past self in a movie that she can soundtrack. The hometown she recalls isn’t beachy Norwegian Kristiansand but Hollywood at its most seedy-glam. The bad boys she courts are recalled in the softest focus. She recalls hearing songs often—never just a song, but their song. Decades collapse into an evocative blur. Annie and Storm’s two most cited inspirations are Twin Peaks in 1990 and David Cronenberg’s car-fetish flick Crash in 1996; in between lies the ’92 of “Forever ’92,” a year, Annie’s said, that has stayed with her. Also hanging around are the nuclear fears that preoccupied the 1950s and 1960s, themselves interpreted through the ’80s. The LA-pocalyptic 1988 film Miracle Mile is all over Dark Hearts: it provides the name of one song, the source of another song’s samples, and acts as the spiritual precursor, thanks to its moody soundtrack by Tangerine Dream. There’s also a meta nostalgia at work: taken together, these inspirations sound a lot like the last decade, via the apocalypse-pop of the early 2010s, then via Random Access Memories, Italians Do It Better, and other synthwave soundalikes. Dark Hearts is best at its most artificial. The moments that aim for “realness” seem less so: the dusty acoustic Americana (Annie-mericana?) outro to “Miracle Mile,” or the title track’s jagged arrangement and stabs at seriousness (“an inquiry into family relations,” she said, stretching just a bit).  Far better is “American Cars,” which has no resemblance to the rugged real things but does recall American car commercials, if scored by Badalamenti and Moroder. In a different song “break free and then never look back” might come off badass, but as delivered in Annie’s sotto voce and surrounded by Storm’s sighing backing vocals, it’s a pure mood. “Mermaid Dreams” is half spoken word and all melancholy. “The Untold Story” is so heavy with “Live to Tell” synths that the production almost fully clouds over Annie's voice telling that story—which, perhaps, is the point. Toward the end comes the apocalyptica that’s almost expected in 2020: a Skeeter Davis riff in “Countdown to the End of the World,” then that end of the world delivered via “The Bomb,” the closest thing on Dark Hearts to a full-on dance song. But both tracks are less dramatic than hazy; the former clarifies that doomsday is really just “an ordinary day,” and the latter, while full of air horns and trance synths and sampled cries about nuclear war, is more sedate groove than banger. It’s the end of the world, and everyone’s only kinda feeling it. The most telling lyric on Dark Hearts is one of the Miracle Mile samples: “Forget everything you heard, and go back to sleep.” Who among us doesn't prefer dreamland lately?","Annie’s first album in about a decade, written and recorded in a haunted house, collapses decades into an evocative blur.

UPRIZE!,SPAZA,by: Andy Beta,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f8495ea86e497a31b6cedf5/1:1/w_160/UPRIZE!_SPAZA.jpg,2020-10-15 05:00:00,Jazz,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/spaza-uprize/,Mushroom Hour Half Hour,"“I ran away from the scene,” photographer Sam Nzima recalled to Time magazine. Then, after recovering himself, he doubled back to capture one of the most powerful photographs of the 20th century. It was June 16, 1976, and several thousand Soweto students had begun protesting the imposition of mandatory Afrikaans-language instruction in township schools. When a student protest turned violent, Nzima captured the still-shocking image of 13-year-old student Hector Pieterson, gunned down by police. South African apartheid wasn’t well known outside of the country up until that point, but its brutality was undeniable after that. Director Sifiso Khanyile’s 2017 documentary UPRIZE! focused on these student protests and foregrounded their struggle against the Bantu Education Act, a repressive policy aimed at disenfranchising Black South Africans. Enacted in 1953, the law set up mandatory government-run schools where Black children were trained for lives of manual labor and menial work, creating an uneducated, unskilled underclass, and indoctrinated to believe that they were subservient to the country’s white minority. “They were putting our minds in a box,” playwright Fatima Dike says in the film. Accompanying the film is an improvised soundtrack by the South African group SPAZA, created as they watched a rough cut of the film projected on a living-room wall in 2016. On last year’s heady debut album, which captured a one-off live performance from 2015, the group—an open-ended collective with rotating members—created a decidedly loose and spacey iteration of South African jazz, favoring slowly unspooling improvisations and woozy electronics. Stripped back to a quartet (only bassist Ariel Zamonsky and percussionist Gontse Makhene are held over), the smaller ensemble tightens up its sound while keeping that expansive sense of space. Zamonsky, who also serves as bassist for Shabaka and the Ancestors, provides a scraping, growling figure at the start that suggests deep unease and serves as a recurring theme throughout. “Bantu Education,” named for the repressive law, joins Zamonsky’s visceral low end with the echoing ululations of newcomer Nonku Phiri to create eerie, hackle-raising atmospheres. Folded into the spacious music are voices from the film describing apartheid’s attempts to divorce children from their heritage. “The South African history would get thinner and thinner and thinner,” says one woman. “And all you were taught was that your ancestors sold their land to the white people for a mirror or a knife.” Spontaneous though the album’s compositions may be, several tracks stun with a spare, disarming beauty. On “Sizwile,” led by pattering hand drums and the gently spaced piano chords of Malcolm Jiyane (whose style brings to mind Bill Evans and South African jazz legend Abdullah Ibrahim ), Phiri’s aching vocals take center stage, by turns mournful and soaring, electronically doubled at key junctures to create a weightless atmosphere. Unhurried and disarming across its eight gossamer minutes, it serves as the spiritual kin to another piece of hushed, reverent South African jazz from earlier this year, Asher Gamedze’s “siyabulela.” Built on a one-note pulse from Zamonsky, “Banna Ba Batsumi” is another highlight, moving ever so slowly from turmoil to transformative release. But through most of the album, the dread and unease of the apartheid era infuse the music. Fear and darkness encroach on pieces like “Mangaliso Sobukwe” and “The Black Consciousness Movement.” On the latter, Phiri’s vocals are processed in such a way that they resemble a spirit roaming the earth, unable to rest. Restraint and reserve inform most of the music up to that point, as if conveying resilience in the face of oppression and injustice. Only on “Bayasiphazamisa” do SPAZA finally let their sound boil over. Agitated keys and shrieks emulate the tipping point of the film, wherein the student demonstrations begin to spread into widespread workers’ protests and strikes across South Africa. On the closing “We Got a Lot of Work to Do,” the recurring bass motif returns, now in a higher register. The title is potent, suggesting that such protests are not the end, but the beginning of a much longer struggle. The Soweto student uprising and dissemination of Nzima’s photograph were but the first step; it would be another 14 years before Nelson Mandela, who had been sentenced to life imprisonment in 1964, was released. It’s erroneous to say that SPAZA’s performance captures the energy of our present moment, given that they recorded four years before the current upheavals. Yet they expertly distill in sound a sense of outrage, injustice, and hope similar to the one felt throughout the world now. As singer/actor Abigail Kubeka says in the film, “The only way we could find of dealing with the trauma was to perform.”","The South African jazz ensemble’s improvised soundtrack to a 2017 documentary about the 1976 Soweto Uprising captures a mixture of outrage, injustice, and hope that resonates powerfully today.

Gulfer,Gulfer,by: Nina Corcoran,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f85e4711e113518240c6bdf/1:1/w_160/gulfer_gulfer.jpg,2020-10-15 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/gulfer-gulfer/,Topshelf,"When lead singer and guitarist Vincent Ford swore, “I'll stay the same old man,” on Gulfer’s 2018 album Dog Bless, it sounded like a tongue-in-cheek salve for being anti-social. He’s making good on that promise. Instead of clinging onto their youth—the oft-chosen path for emo-adjacent guitar bands of their ilk—the Montreal quartet face the realities of entering your late-20s on their new self-titled album, from the dissolution of underwhelming friendships to the comfortable cadence of self-doubt. There’s no listing off of complaints or self-pitying displays of narcissism. In its place, Gulfer use the album as a sounding board for the quotidian fears of adulthood while grounding themselves in musical and lyrical maturity. Ford, singer-guitarist Joe Therriault, singer-bassist David Mitchell, and drummer Julien Daoust collaborate in a way that makes the moral quandaries on Gulfer sound communal. There’s the omnipresent weight of a college-dropout inferiority complex, generational disagreements about the effects of climate change, and nostalgia for the naivety of childhood. In “Heat Wave,” Therriault recounts the uptick in performative conversations with friends that turn prosaic, as if prevaricating due to ego as opposed to masking imposter syndrome. “Biking home I wonder why/You say you’re working class when it feels right,” he repeats, his deadpan lilt verging on dejection. Scattered throughout are the type of declarative statements that increasingly ring true throughout adulthood: “You go out of your way to stay the same,” “It’s easy to say it should have been better in the end,” and, most bleak of all, “I belong in my house.” Gulfer raise a bunch of these questions across the album but never really offer an answer. It’s refreshing, particularly because that humility prevents their “issues” from being blown out of proportion, like on“Forget (Friendly),” when Therriault develops a crush on someone while in a monogamous relationship. Wracked by guilt, he ping-pongs ideas about how to ethically support both people while riff after riff crashes into the downbeat. These are the moments that define Gulfer; when the melodrama of teenagerdom and the pessimism of young adulthood subside, and resignation guides the long run ahead. To really draw that emotion out, Gulfer turn to their most impressive skill: dexterous finger-tapping and complex drum shuffles. Something as simple as a stringy guitar melody on “Flashing” or syncopated rhythms on “Trips and Falls” distill math-rock elements into digestible pop hooks that punch up their stories. On “Letters,” a restless sugar-rush of a song, the four-piece nod to fellow Canadians the Most Serene Republic with indie-rock-indebted drum rolls, a musical mirror of its lyrics about the temptation to upend your life altogether. Gulfer’s maturity shines in the album’s mixing, too, in part thanks to Great Grandpa’s Dylan Hanwright manning the boards. It recreates a dialed-in basement show, a fitting stereo setup for a genre that’s best experienced when you can hear kids screaming along over the vocalist. Across the album, the band is more certain of their uncertainty, and consequently more bummed out than ever before in their eight-year career. They’ve entered adulthood, and they’re already more level-headed about what that means than most of emo’s forebearers were.","The Montreal band grows up on their third album, crafting well-made, emo-adjacent songs all while trying to summon enough energy to stare down looming adulthood.

As Long As You Are,Future Islands,by: Sophie Kemp ,Contributor ,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f7e50e31efa8e109cd44dcc/1:1/w_160/as%20long%20as%20you%20are_future%20islands.jpg,2020-10-14 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/future-islands-as-long-as-you-are/,4AD,"Since Future Islands entered the national spotlight on live television in 2014 while promoting their fourth album, Singles, frontman Samuel T. Herring has made an entire career out of obsessive, deliberate public vulnerability. In past iterations of Future Islands, Herring’s exploration of heartbreak felt like a bombastic release, a cut umbilical cord. People still talk about it: Singles, released over a decade into their career, was a revelation, one that launched an indie-pop band in their second act into the kind of viral stardom they could never quite follow up. In many ways, it felt like a zenith for indie rock at its most hopeful and naive. Six years and two records later, Future Islands’ latest album, As Long As You Are, is not so different thematically or even musically from anything they’ve released in the past six years. But it’s not nearly as compelling. That one perfect moment on Letterman’s show feels impossible to repeat; a reminder of how things were. The band’s bare-it-all earnestness no longer evokes such strong emotions. The feelings here are static, rendering the booming new-wave synths and crystalline bass somehow lifeless. What happened? It’s not that Future Islands lost the ability to write songs so fully realized they make your heart bloom and break. The dreamy “Moonlight” smolders with synthesizers that glisten like violets at night, and the bass is searching and soft. Herring’s baritone is expressive; he sings about putting his whole heart on the table in the hopes that his lover won’t break it. The production is cavernous as ever, plucked from the depths of OMD B-sides and the most blue-eyed of New Order singles. But it sounds like any other Future Islands record from the past decade: The scaffolding is the same, just slightly more polished and streamlined. Even the way Herring delivers these sentiments feels strangely anesthetic. Instead of inviting a moment of quiet introspection as Future Islands songs have in the past, it makes you want to check your email. All of the parts are there on all of these songs, but when you piece them together something feels amiss. On the twilight ballad “City’s Face,” looking out at a skyline is all it takes to recall someone you’ve lost and the memories you once shared. The sentiment is deeply saccharine, which isn’t necessarily bad, but the song is so gratingly slow and monotonous that it is hard to focus on anything else. The textures feel hollow, lost in the retro-fetishism of a wide-eyed version of the ’80s that made more sense at the beginning of the far more optimistic last decade but now just feels dated. The lyrical content of “For Sure,” is maudlin at best and it plays as disorientingly anthemic. “Carving the wind/Dawn of your eyes/Dust off your smile,” sings Herring over crisp guitars and a barrage of synthesizers that belong in a trailer for a rom-com you’ll never watch. There is nothing wrong with sticking to a sound. Beach House, like Future Islands, comes from a parallel legacy of Baltimore-based indie-pop bands more interested in refining a signature style than reinventing it. They make essentially the same album every few years, finding subtle ways to challenge themselves, creating music that feels comfortable, consistent, yet still melodramatic. As Long As You Are lacks those subtle—but noticeable—tweaks. The record feels like standing water, Herring is so entrenched in the past it’s hard to tell who he really is on so much of this record. There are, however, moments when the light shines in with the vibrancy of stained glass. On the lovely “Waking,” Herring demands to know his purpose is as synthesizers burn up the sky. The song is a photo from a disposable camera: ephemeral, nostalgic, perfectly tender. There’s a moment when a synthesizer is delicately arpeggiated—you want to live there. It feels like home. But “Waking” is a rare moment on a record that doesn’t say anything new about Future Islands, or about anything else.","The Baltimore band goes back to the well for another record of languorous, heart-on-the-sleeve synth-pop that hits all its marks but smacks of diminishing returns.

Circuit City,Moor Mother,by: Andy Beta,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f8468fb5ca75431fcdec85c/1:1/w_160/circuit%20city_moor%20mother.jpg,2020-10-14 05:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/moor-mother-circuit-city/,Don Giovanni,"Across three days in June 2019, Camae Ayewa, better known as Moor Mother, presented her first theatrical creation, Circuit City, at Philadelphia’s FringeArts. That Ayewa should stage such an ambitious multimedia work—part musical, part choreographed poem, part play—while also preparing Zonal’s Wrecked and her solo album Analog Fluids of Sonic Black Holes speaks to the Philadelphia poet and experimental musician’s work ethic. She has a good reason to be so prolific: Ayewa’s work is dedicated to the struggle against a system of oppression that spans generations. As she says early in the piece, “There’s been so much trauma, I don’t even know where to start…. I don’t even know what year/I got my momma’s years, my daddy’s years all mixed up inside of me.” Staring down “the cold way of life’s limitations,” her work is an acknowledgement that the fight against oppression must be as tireless as the inhumane systems that perpetuate such trauma. Set in the living room of a corporate-owned housing complex, Circuit City may well be the first theater production ever to feature an essay written by an attorney from the Housing Unit of Philadelphia’s Community Legal Services. Like the production itself, the music addresses decades of neglect in low-income public housing, police brutality, redlining, and the fear of eviction—bleak topics that might not promise the most engaging listen. But such is Ayewa’s presence and steely delivery that the four extended pieces nevertheless lodge you inside the mind of someone who lives with such daily indignities. Paranoid, claustrophobic, yet determined to “circuit break,” the album forges ahead in a style similar to that of Who Sent You?, the smoldering free-jazz album she released last year as a part of Irreversible Entanglements. That band supports her here, providing a roiling backdrop of horns, drums, keys, and standup bass augmented by visceral electronics from Ada Adhiyatma and Steve Montenegro and backing vocals from Elon Battle. On Who Sent You?, Ayewa’s voice fit neatly into Irreversible Entanglements’ pocket, glinting with wit and candor. She is more forceful and didactic here, pushing into the red when the music starts to boil. Amid the frenzy of frequencies and crashing cymbals on “Act 2 - Circuit Break,” Ayewa worries at the word “breaking” as Keir Neuringer’s alto and Aquiles Navarro’s trumpet shriek around her, sounding breathless, then frenetic. In the album’s cathartic final act of UFO bleeps and droning horns, she shouts, “You can’t time travel/Seek inner and outer dimensions/Without free jazz!” But while she blends visceral electronics with jazz, Moor Mother steadily moves beyond the confines of any one sound or discipline. The album might not be an ideal entry into her oeuvre, but it reveals Ayewa to be one of the most uncompromising artists in any field. The most disarming voice on the album belongs to Elon Battle, who assumes the spotlight in “Act 3 - Time of No Time.” Against a backdrop of simmering electronics, echoing horns, and clattering percussion, Battle sings an alien torch song whose trembling falsetto brings to mind ANOHNI—a refreshing change of pace before Ayewa’s voice returns to the fold. As the tension builds, she reels off snatches of numbers and figures that feel disjointed at first (“20 million,” “70 thousand”) but build to a striking command: “Say my name/So my children will know where to find me/Once they take away our homes.” When Circuit City ran last year, the accompanying notes referenced the 22,000 eviction filings recorded annually in Philadelphia, along with an unknown number of illegal evictions—a burden that primarily falls upon women of color. In the wake of the global pandemic, devastated city budgets, and widespread economic free fall, low-income housing is in even worse shape now. Even if COVID-19 were to vanish from the earth tomorrow, the urban housing crisis would remain unresolved. It will take a concerted, communal effort to even begin to clearly see, much less address, this issue that strikes at the very core of our humanity. Moor Mother’s Circuit City intently illuminates the threats facing poor people of color in their very homes. Putting avant-garde tactics to humanist ends, her album is a powerful indictment of a vicious, racist cycle that needs to be broken. As she reminds us at the album’s finale, “You can’t go to war without a drum.”","In her debut theatrical work, the Philadelphia poet and experimental musician rails against the racist underpinnings of the housing crisis against a backdrop of free jazz.

AUNTIE,Ian Isiah,by: Cameron Cook,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f8491a946ede078a46472ea/1:1/w_160/AUNTIE_Ian%20Isiah.jpg,2020-10-14 05:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/ian-isiah-auntie/,Juliet,"In Black culture, the title of “auntie” holds specific, almost folkloric meaning. So much more than an aunt (merely the sister of a parent), aunties may or may not be blood relatives but always serve as a vector for an extravagant, all-encompassing feminine force, not as nurturing and direct as motherhood but still having a hand in shaping a young child’s perceptions. They are the women whose Sunday outfits are the most glamorous, whose nails are always freshly done, whose presence is the most anticipated at Thanksgiving like a midpoint between Anita Baker and Mary Poppins. The fact that Ian Isiah, the multi-faceted, unapologetically freaky singer-songwriter, has named his new project Auntie isn’t a coincidence, and it’s not just a nod to his Black lineage. To anyone in the know, it positions him as the benevolent diva, the fun-loving, streetwise pastor preaching to the neighborhood kids. It says that his ever-changing hairstyles, his half-shaved eyebrows, and his bejeweled grill are not “alternative” by Black standards, but rather firmly anchored in his heritage. This is abundantly clear as soon as Auntie takes off, with “N.U.T.S” (which, amazingly, stands for “Nigga U the Shit”), a velvety mid-tempo funk number built around plaintive saxophones, a slack and supple bassline, and twinkling electric keys. However, a dark current runs through the groove—the opening and closing sample of the track is a woman screaming homophobic slurs in the middle of a busy street (“He’s a man, he’s a woman? That’s a disgrace! An abomination!”). It’s ugly and unsettling, but Isiah’s lush falsetto completely embraces you by the time the chorus kicks in: “You gotta make some room for the people that wanna love ya.” You can hear the carefree smile in his voice, and like that, the tone of Auntie is set—one of self-love, self-acceptance, and self-assurance. On his two previous mixtapes (2013’s The Love Champion and 2018’s Shugga Sextape Vol. 1) , Isiah explored a more contemporary side of neo-R&B, melding hip-hop, electro, experimental, and trap into his funk and gospel background. Auntie, however, is produced as a collaborative project with Canadian duo Chromeo, who have spent nearly two decades perfecting their own retro-’80s signature. The marriage of these two sounds—Isiah’s futurism and Chromeo’s nostalgia—sets a mood that’s less envelope-pushing than what we’re used to hearing from Isiah, but still marks a definite evolution in music and vision. This is far from a bad thing. Sleek, hi-fi production choices make Auntie’s message of exuberance all the more explicit. Isiah, raised Pentecostal, is blessed with the kind of voice that only an upbringing in the church can produce—deeply soulful, grippingly melodic, downright heavenly. While a dancefloor-ready track like “Lady Bug” sees Isiah delivering sexed-up vocal runs to rival Rick James at his slinkiest, it’s on “Loose Truth,” the project’s tender closer, that he truly soars. “This is my truth,” he repeats, elevating the lyric to a mantra, his voice taking on a different flavor at every turn: soul, gospel, funk, R&B. The harmonies are impeccable, like a choir beamed directly into your skull. He’s harking back to summer block parties where open fire hydrants sprayed the street with rainbows, where a Holy Trinity of Patti LaBelle, Luther Vandross, and Chaka Khan blasted from cars parked on the corner. On a record so sure of itself, “Loose Truth” stands out for its vulnerability, embodying Isiah’s own experiences and sense of community. Like its namesakes, Auntie revels in being larger than life while retaining a sweetness that only amplifies its sass.","The Brooklyn-based funk singer’s latest project strikes a balance between sweet and larger than life, aided by Chromeo’s sleek production.

The Killing of Eugene Peeps,Bastien Keb,by: Zach Schonfeld,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f848f9529dd317c0d51923f/1:1/w_160/The%20Killing%20of%20Eugene%20Peeps_Bastien%20Keb.jpg,2020-10-14 05:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/bastien-keb-the-killing-of-eugene-peeps/,Gearbox,"Consider the tradition of the imaginary movie soundtrack. From Brian Eno’s ambient collection Music for Films to the Olivia Tremor Control’s kaleidoscopic opus Dusk at Cubist Castle (not to mention lesser-known specimens, such as Barry Adamson’s remarkably creepy Moss Side Story), songwriters have been crafting soundtracks to movies that exist only in their minds for more than 40 years. Sure, scoring an actual film is more lucrative for a working musician, but scoring a nonexistent one may be the more fulfilling creative endeavor: You don’t have to cater to anyone’s vision but your own, and your work will never be tainted by association with a mediocre film. The Killing of Eugene Peeps, the third album from the London multi-instrumentalist known as Bastien Keb (born Sebastien Jones), is a fascinating new entry in the imaginary-soundtrack category. Keb is a lifelong cinephile—a former video store clerk who spent long, customerless shifts immersing himself in movies—and a composer who knows a thing or two about scoring, having crafted music for TV commercials and documentaries. But no commercial sounds like The Killing of Eugene Peeps, a gloomy, dreamlike suite that summons the vintage sounds of 1970s giallo films and 1960s French New Wave with remarkable specificity. Keb’s previous albums, 2015’s Dinking in the Shadows of Zizou and 2017’s 22.02.85, gravitated towards a genre-fluid style of jazzy trip-hop with a skewed aesthetic, and even drew some raves from U.K.-based music press. But Eugene Peeps swaps out the beat-driven sound for creaky analog intimacy. There’s an eclectic array of borrowed or found instrumentation: trumpet, bass, flute—even a singing saw floats into the mix on the standout “Young Ponies.” Like a sprawling narrative arc, the music shifts from rickety jazz (“Israel Ate His Own Mind”) to funk (“Street Clams”) to brooding, meditative passages with relative ease. Recurring motifs percolate throughout, and as if the cinematic theme needs further underscoring, the album cover looks like a poster for the kind of fictitious film-within-a-film that might crop up in a Tarantino screenplay. The most engrossing cinematic flourish, however, is the recurring narration by Keb’s friend Kenneth Viota, who takes the lead on a series of spoken-word passages adapted from Keb’s own journals. In an interview with Bandcamp Daily, Keb described creating the record while coping with the misery of a night-shift warehouse job: “I was a zombie for a year,” he said, “piecing the album together while I was working.” Viota’s coarse growl, and his darkly funny mutterings of desolation and depression (“They’ll be better times ahead—I hear hell’s nice this time of year,” he deadpans in “The World Creaks”), reflect that mind state and recall the seedier spoken-word tracks from Rain Dogs-era Tom Waits. (Keb’s own voice couldn’t be more different; his layered falsetto on songs like “Rabbit Hole” bears a curious resemblance to Justin Vernon.) If the resulting record sounds like an obscure ’70s soundtrack culled from a dollar bin, that’s by design. Keb commits to the bit, and his fluency with the vocabulary of film scoring means that he is capable of summoning the expressive eccentricity of Ennio Morricone (“Can’t Sleep”) or the roiling, low brass intensity of Bernard Herrmann’s Taxi Driver score (“Bookie”). By contrast, the rap cut “Paprika,” featuring a freewheeling verse by Nottingham rapper Cappo, feels conspicuously out of place—it’s the one moment where the film-score illusion shatters. At 18 tracks, The Killing of Eugene Peeps is undeniably ambitious and occasionally scattershot, but never tedious. It helps that the music is constantly shifting, mutating between styles and tones—often within the realm of a single song—like an anthology film caught between genres. Take “Theme for an Old Man,” for example: In less than four minutes, the track unfolds from doomy brass squalls that evoke a specter of violence to a warped trip-hop groove befitting a DJ Shadow production. From there, the beat drops out and a miniature symphony of descending strings lingers in the air like cigarette smoke, pointing the way to the mournful timbre of “Can’t Sleep.” You may not know much about the characters or storyline, but with music like this, there’s a film in your head, too.","The third album from London composer Bastien Keb is a soundtrack to a nonexistent film: a gloomy, dreamlike suite that summons the vintage sounds of 1970s giallo films and French New Wave.

Act II: The Patents of Nobility (The Turn),Jay Electronica,by: Matthew Ismael Ruiz,"Associate Staff Writer, News",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f80fed3b1ec0862a4bce8fb/1:1/w_160/act%202_jay%20electronica.jpg,2020-10-13 05:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/jay-electronica-act-ii-the-patents-of-nobility-the-turn/,Equity,"In a 2010 interview with Jeff “Chairman” Mao, Jay Electronica admitted that the mystique around him was confounding. “I don’t get why people say that,” he said. “I be on Twitter, I be on Facebook. The people that know me, I’m open with them. I don’t know where the mystique thing is coming from. I’m a pretty open person.” And indeed, 10 years later, he never really went away—his tweets became infrequent, and the album never materialized, but he never went too long without appearing on a guest feature or dropping a loose single, often a highlight from the announced but unreleased Act II: The Patents of Nobility. In reality, the only thing mysterious about Jay Electronica was why, having been anointed as rap’s second coming in the wake of “Exhibit C,” he would sit on what was by all accounts the next hip-hop classic. Fans and critics alike struggled to understand why someone with his considerable gifts would resist the industry’s beaten path to stardom, why a rapper with a critical mass of accumulated hype would decamp to London and hole up with an heiress, his magnum opus languishing on a hard drive, collecting dust. Now that Act II is here, the answers to those questions have come into sharper focus. But Jay did not release it willingly. Almost 11 years after its originally announced release date, it leaked online late last week after an unnamed group allegedly raised about $9,000 to purchase it from hackers. He admitted to attempting to block its release, but in the wake of March’s A Written Testimony, the critically acclaimed LP that served as his “official” debut, he seems somewhat at peace with its release to the public, even in its unfinished form. Perhaps he’s matured; perhaps the weight of expectation no longer burdens him, having shed the albatross he’s worn in public for the past 10 years. Whatever the reason, within days of the leak, the samples had been cleared and the album officially released, with Jay expressing gratitude for the immediate response. The track list arrives almost exactly the same as it was announced in 2012, with the sole exception being the Charlotte Gainsbourg-featuring “Dinner at Tiffany’s,” now spun off from the original “Shiny Suit Theory.” It very much feels like the sequel to his 2007 breakthrough Act I: Eternal Sunshine (The Pledge), a 15-minute suite that abandoned conventional form and structure, built atop Jon Brion’s score for the film Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. Act II opens with “Real Magic,” a sparse production featuring a plaintive piano melody and bass line that offers a glimpse into the structure of his intended trilogy. A magic trick—as Michael Caine so helpfully explains in the 2006 film The Prestige—consists of three parts. The Pledge, in which the illusionist displays something ordinary; the Turn, in which they do something amazing with that ordinary object; and the Prestige, in which they deliver the seemingly impossible. “This is the Turn/they ain’t ready for the Prestige yet” he raps, laying out his intent for what follows. He largely delivers. Though the album is clearly unfinished, many of its songs sound complete, and it only peters out in the final quarter with rough-hewn demo-quality beats and reference vocals. It’s easy to see why he wouldn’t want songs like “Rough Love” and “Night of the Roundtable” to see the light of day; in their current form, they blunt the impact of the album’s climax somewhat. Still, it’s not hard to imagine a finished version of Act II with no real misses. And it features some of the strongest work of his career, official or otherwise. “Better in Tune,” originally released as the single “Better in Tune With the Infinite,” is more evidence that his mystique is mostly the manifestation of an image projected onto him by others. A masterstroke of his signature style, laying quotes from Elijah Muhammad and The Wizard of Oz atop a Ryuichi Sakamoto sample, the lyrics in its single verse are at once poignant and revealing, almost directly answering questions surrounding Act II’s delayed release: “It’s frustrating when you just can’t express yourself/And it’s hard to trust enough to undress yourself/To stand exposed and naked, in a world full of hatred/Where the sick thoughts of mankind control all the sacred.” It’s a place familiar to any writer staring down a deadline: with each passing day, you change, the world changes, and the increasing volume of your internal dialogue can be paralyzing. Who is this for? Do others need to hear this? Should they? The longer the paralysis, the further the moment recedes into the rearview, dulling its potential impact. To that end, it’s a minor miracle that we get to hear this record at all, because the style he’s honed and crafted on Act II feels unique. A Written Testimony remains essential and representative of his lyrical talent, but compared to Act II, it’s relatively conventional. Jay’s use of his source material is reverent and intimate. He will often insert his voice into existing songs as if he were in the room collaborating with the artist when it was recorded, rather than digging in a crate to find a long-lost melody or break. There’s an intense dissonance at play in “Bonnie and Clyde” for anyone already familiar with the original ’60s cut by Serge Gainsbourg and Brigitte Bardot; were it not for his signature applause sample, one might temporarily forget they’re listening to a Jay Electronica record. But three minutes in, and it feels like Serge wrote the song for him with 50 years of foresight—the percussion buried in the mix, the string melody swirling around his voice. Even when he samples Ronald Reagan—on “Real Magic” and “Road to Perdition”—he seems to twist the late actor and American president’s words to suit his own needs, as if they were spoken in service of his art. The album’s leak and forced release will likely leave fans wondering what could have been. Consuming it in 2020 after having lived with many of the songs for years, we’ve been robbed of the experience of newly hearing them all for the first time, instead forced to revisit familiar puzzle pieces assembled in their new context. There’s a lesson to be learned here about procrastination, self-doubt, and the common writer’s pitfall of getting in one’s own way, of self-examination devolving into self-destruction. Act II is nearly an all-time classic LP, the kind of record that celebrates an art form while simultaneously pushing it forward. In its current form, with much of the LP’s strongest material floating around for years before its release, and sequencing that builds to a climax that never arrives, it remains a nearly completed draft that was filed away, abandoned to the archives while the world moved on. Yet it remains an artwork that no one else could have created, let alone finished.","Long-delayed and eventually shelved, Jay Electronica’s near-mythical “lost” album finally sees official release after it was leaked. Even slightly unfinished, it is nearly an all-time classic, the kind of record that celebrates an art form while simultaneously pushing it forward.

Silver Ladders,Mary Lattimore,by: Jemima Skala,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f81003db1e2d332600bea7c/1:1/w_160/silver%20ladders_mary%20lattimore.jpg,2020-10-13 05:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/mary-lattimore-silver-ladders/,Ghostly,"What makes Mary Lattimore’s work so entrancing is its interiority. With just a harp and loop pedals, the Los Angeles musician creates dreamscapes from the patterns behind her own eyelids and sweeps her audience up in them. She expanded her arsenal on 2018’s Hundreds of Days, adding theremin, electric guitar, and her own voice. On her new album Silver Ladders, she has teamed up with Slowdive’s Neil Halstead, swelling her gentle ambience with a more strident sound. The two were introduced by a mutual friend at a festival, and although Halstead had never recorded a harp, Lattimore asked him to produce her next album, which she ended up recording at Halstead’s studio in Newquay, on the north coast of Cornwall. Silver Ladders is imbued with a mixture of nostalgia and fresh inspiration—the product, perhaps, of shifting to a small rural town with few distractions and ample opportunities to reflect. Halstead’s touch is perceptible throughout the album as a subtle bolster to Mary Lattimore’s ideas. His influence comes through strongest on “Til a Mermaid Drags You Under,” where his reverb-soaked guitar dances around the steady harp melody. His dissonant, razor-sharp tones cut through the solemn, meditative bass line, and the guitar follows Lattimore’s lead as the song rises out of the melodic depths and takes a redemptive turn. Halstead’s thrumming guitar also enters halfway through “Sometimes He’s in My Dreams,” gradually introducing a secondary voice to Lattimore’s layered harp. A restless track, it feels like a vivid dream; Halstead’s guitar speaks as if for the title’s “he,” a mirror for the subconscious. Drenched in memory, Silver Ladders concerns itself with the sublimity of small moments. The album’s title track is inspired by an experience Lattimore had swimming in the sea on the Croatian island of Hvar; the opening harp melody is disjointed and uncertain until it falls into a bassy lull, recalling the experience of being held in the water’s bobbing restlessness. Album opener “Pine Trees” evokes walking through a pine forest: It exudes light, like rays of sun breaking through the forest canopy, while also suggesting a sense of thickness and depth. “Chop on the Climbout” originated from Lattimore mishearing a pilot during takeoff; the pulsing drones that open the track synthesize the feeling of an airplane’s engine, while Lattimore’s layered harp chimes create a bubbling sense of mystery, like being the first in a crowd to spot a minute detail. Lattimore uses her music like a teleportation device, transporting her listeners to places and times that are both imagined and real. Silver Ladders is energetic yet also deeply calming. Lattimore’s virtuosity goes beyond technical ability: She has the uncanny ability to pluck a string in a way that will instantly make someone remember the taste of their fifth birthday cake. On Silver Ladders, Mary Lattimore brings the world to her level gently and without force, but always compellingly.","With Slowdive’s Neil Halstead in the producer’s chair, the Los Angeles harpist swells her gentle ambience with a more strident sound but remains as transporting as ever.

Sleepless Night EP,Yo La Tengo,by: Zach Schonfeld,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f810195b1e2d332600bea80/1:1/w_160/sleepless%20night_yo%20la%20tengo.jpg,2020-10-13 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/yo-la-tengo-sleepless-night-ep/,Matador,"How many Yo La Tengo deep cuts did you enjoy for years before realizing they were covers? If you’ve been a fan for long enough, chances are it’s a few. The trio’s ability to morph into a kind of living covers jukebox is nearly as legendary as their propensity for making non-Jews care about Hanukkah, and if you always thought “You Can Have It All” was an original, you’re not the only one—it’s a testament to the band’s knack for taking any unsung gem and rearranging it until it’s unmistakably a Yo La Tengo song. Sleepless Night, the band’s second standalone EP of 2020, finds them resuming this curatorial role, weaving together covers as unlikely as a 1940s blues oddity and as recognizable as a Bob Dylan classic alongside one stray original. Unlike the recent ambient workout We Have Amnesia Sometimes, which felt like a time capsule from quarantine, this one is more of an odds-and-sods collection, with recordings stretching back 10 or even 20 years. (The tracks were originally chosen in collaboration with Japanese visual artist Yoshitomo Nara, and previously appeared as part of a limited-edition catalog for his Los Angeles County Museum of Art exhibit.) Yet it never feels patchwork: The tone is reliably lovely and hushed, reflective of Yo La Tengo’s recent instinct for responding to outer turmoil with a heightened commitment to dreamy tranquility. A little nostalgia, too, is warranted during such destabilizing times; much of Sleepless Night’s tracklist reflects Ira Kaplan and Georgia Hubley’s 1960s–’70s youth, well before the indie-rock explosion. Guest guitarist (and YLT alum) Dave Schramm nails the jingle-jangle Rickenbacker sound on a surprisingly faithful cover of the Byrds’ “Wasn’t Born to Follow,” a song Kaplan first encountered when his mom took him to see Easy Rider in 1969, while Hubley takes the lead on a sighing, leisurely cover of Ronnie Lane’s 1974 gem ""Roll on Babe,” first written by forgotten folk legend Derroll Adams. Meanwhile, the trio’s three-part harmony is the star on “Blues Stay Away,” an excavation of a 1949 Delmore Brothers standard made electric by NRBQ in 1972. Yo La Tengo’s take, recorded in 2011, is more aligned with the song’s downbeat blues origin. The main attraction, though, is a blissful dream-pop recalibration of Bob Dylan’s “It Takes a Lot to Laugh, It Takes a Train to Cry.” Recorded for a John Peel radio show, this version is a newly unearthed recording from the And Then Nothing Turned Itself Inside-Out era and it shares that album’s gorgeous nocturnal ambience. Hubley replaces Dylan’s straining wheeze with an understated murmur, and her bandmates swap out the “thin, wild mercury sound” of mid-’60s Dylan for a warm, droney hum. It’s a worthy addition to the band’s recurring Dylan obsession, which dates back to 1989’s President Yo La Tengo. For the most part, though, Sleepless Night feels like an extension of a different record: namely, the band’s 2015 covers-etc. album Stuff Like That There, which itself was a loose sequel to 1990’s similarly spirited Fakebook. As on those releases, the selections are eclectic, the tone is subdued, and there’s not a squalling whammy bar in sight. Only the obligatory new original—a fuzzy and indistinct mood piece called “Bleeding”—feels a bit slight. As for the rest of this 19-minute release, there’s nothing here that particularly surprises or reveals a new side of Yo La Tengo, but there’s nothing that could conceivably disappoint a fan of the group’s jukebox side, either. For most of us, it’s probably the closest we’ll get to a Hanukkah show this year.","Yo La Tengo’s second EP in recent months finds them resuming their covers jukebox niche, weaving together selections as unlikely as a 1940s blues oddity and as recognizable as a Bob Dylan classic.

Atlas Vending,Metz,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f8102e529dd317c0d51920d/1:1/w_160/atlas%20vending_metz.jpg,2020-10-13 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/metz-atlas-vending/,Sub Pop,"METZ isn’t hooky in the traditional sense of the word, but their appeal is immediate as that of any pop band. Years before Shellac and Hot Snakes broke their hiatuses, the Toronto trio’s Sub Pop debut proudly kept the bad vibes going for antisocialites who didn’t care to pledge full allegiance to hardcore, punk, noise, or indie rock. If Steve Albini producing their 2017 album Strange Peace didn’t move the needle much, it’s only because you might’ve assumed he did the other ones too. And yet, Strange Peace started to renege on the promises Alex Edkins made two years earlier on II: that METZ would never hire a big producer, clean up their sound, or make anything accessible enough for radio. Three years later, Atlas Vending verges even closer to “accessible” and “expansive.” For better or worse, the snare tone is still their best hook. But what a snare tone. It’s about the first thing heard on the opening “Pulse,” a form of “grimy, airless 200-cap venue” vérité so antithetical to a typical studio-produced sound that it comes off like CGI—as if Hayden Menzies is banging oil drums inside a meat locker, which itself in inside a well, which itself is inside a cave. Getting on METZ’s wavelength has always required a miserabilist bent, and the insistent beat is self-explanatory: It’s the pulse of a man whose heart pumps coffee sludge, steel shavings, and malevolence, soldiering on in the hopes that tolerance for pain might amount to something useful. It’s an apt state of existence for Atlas Vending, as METZ’s music skews more political by default in 2020. We’re told that Edkins addresses “crushing social anxiety, addiction, isolation, media-induced paranoia and the restless urge to leave everything behind,” and really, what else is an aggrieved noise-rock band supposed to write about? “A Boat to Drown In” and “Hail Taxi” avoid restating the obvious, but would benefit from a less oblique approach. Edkins attacks every lyric with the same unyielding, agitated bark, making it hard to grasp any heightened sense of stakes or outrage. Is he newly infuriated by three years of doomscrolling since Strange Peace or is this the inevitable outcome of matching his band’s unyielding, agitated music? The cerebral aspect of METZ’s music is always secondary to its concussive power, and on Atlas Vending they take great care to get the sound and associations in place. Co-producer Ben Greenberg’s stint with The Men coincided with their creative zenith before he pivoted back to the industrial, urban assault vehicle of Uniform. The mixing comes courtesy of Seth Manchester, who guided the mainstream breakthrough of Daughters’ You Won’t Get What You Want, recreating their prior sonic snuff with a prestigious, filmic scope that roped in Nick Cave fans. METZ doesn’t lack those acts’ extremist convictions; Atlas Vending is among the most pummeling music released by a big-league indie label in 2020. Nearly every track has something to offer the pedalboard gawkers—the guitars of “Parasite” replicate a dentist’s drill on chattering teeth, the harmonies of “Blind Youth Industrial Park” imagines Alice in Chains’ Facelift as part of Sub Pop’s back catalog, and Chris Slorach’s bass tone ought to require oversight from OSHA. Each of these things happens within the first 30 seconds or so, and METZ struggle to find ways to take their songs somewhere more interesting than they started. The choruses of “Blind Youth Industrial Park” or “Hail Taxi” are clean enough to pass for anthemic, but their impact diminishes with repetition, Edkins’ melodic austerity and rigid intonation ensuring they’re anthemic only relative to other METZ songs. “The Mirror” kicks off with an intriguing post-hardcore rendering of the Bo Diddley beat and cycles in place for about five minutes. Lead single “A Boat to Drown In” does this intentionally, a seven-minute motorik meant to signify a bold new direction rather a low-risk pivot, the result of incrementally widening their influences over the past decade. There’s no denying METZ’s ability to summon a white-knuckled, visceral disgust where tension and release are indistinguishable. It slaps, but it doesn’t leave much of a mark.","The Toronto band’s pummeling sound still evokes white-knuckled, visceral disgust, but they struggle to take these songs somewhere more interesting than they started.

Lament,Touché Amoré,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f8089375ca75431fcdec734/1:1/w_160/lament_touche%20amore.jpg,2020-10-12 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/touche-amore-lament/,Epitaph,"Jeremy Bolm has spent the past decade striving to live up to the example set by his own words. The music he makes with his band, Touché Amoré, compels guys with neck tattoos to spend a half hour irresponsibly slamming into fellow fans before they corner Bolm after the show and reveal how they felt truly seen by “And Now It’s Happening In Mine.” He’ll be the first to tell you about the ways he falls short: 2013’s Is Survived By explored Bolm’s struggles with the pressures of being in a profoundly impactful (but not famous) hardcore band, which brought even greater success and demands. Bolm missed his mother’s dying day because he was “on stage living the dream” at Fest in Florida. He atoned by making an entire album about her passing from stage 4 breast cancer. This entire history is summarized on “I’ll Be Your Host,” the second single from their phenomenal fifth album Lament, wherein Bolm recognizes the privilege of his platform and the common misconception that he can singlehandedly walk people through their grieving process because he made a great hardcore record about not knowing how to grieve. It’s a long overdue revelation that he alone can’t be there for everyone at all times, which makes Lament their capstone—a Touché Amoré album that can reach the most people as possible from the greatest distance. To hear Touché Amoré tell it, they had no choice but to work with famed heavy metal producer Ross Robinson if they were going to make this kind of record. Infamously intense and hands-on, Robinson’s anti-Rick Rubin approach irrevocably changed the course of popular metal by enabling chaotic and highly unconventional acts like Korn, Slipknot, and Limp Bizkit to focus their live intensity without compromising to reach suburban adolescents like Bolm—“I saw the ‘Blind’ music video on a local music video channel,” he recently recalled. “And my fucking brain fell out of my head.” More germane to Touché Amoré, Robinson was also behind the boards for Blood Brothers’ Burn, Piano Island, Burn, Glassjaw’s Worship and Tribute, and the motherlode, Relationship of Command, all wildly ambitious records that pushed already revered post-hardcore bands dangerously close to mainstream success and shortly thereafter, their demise. “Ross is known for two things, getting a drummer replaced or kicked out and making the singer cry,” Bolm joked. Opener “Come Heroine” does a lot of things that are familiar to Touché Amoré—Bolm begins screaming off-mic; the band launches into a bucking, double-time thrash; they pull back during the verse and rev up the circle pit again. Every single second of “Come Heroine” does these things more emphatically than previous Touché Amoré songs, the intended result of a band with enough time, enough confidence, and enough resources to push everything by 10-20 percent more. The tempo slows noticeably between the verse and the bridge; the time signature shifts subtly; the guitars are newly textured to variously evoke shoegaze and Morricone. As an instrumental alone, “Come Heroine” would feel like a song about interrogating familiar patterns and being open to unexpected inspiration, but then Bolm’s lyrics confirm it’s definitely about that—“When I thought I saw everything,” he intones before returning to his howl, “I SAW YOU!” Touché Amoré albums usually reserve one or two songs that push their reliably cathartic and anthemic melodic post-hardcore towards something as outright accessible as, say, the National. Lament asks, why not make that every song? “A Broadcast” lingers in a Leonard Cohen afterworld, averting a typically bellowing chorus for an ’00-indie chorale. On album closer “A Forecast,” Bolm sings bravely and rhymes bluntly over twinkling piano chords, which isn’t even the most shocking part of the song. “The funniest Touché Amoré song” doesn’t evoke a lot of competition, but “the most uncomfortably revealing Touché Amoré song” does, and “A Forecast” somehow manages to be both as Bolm airs out resentments over the way he felt abandoned by family, friends, bandmates and even Epitaph Records after Stage Four—“It’s not like I wrote some lyrics/Detailing the exact events/Some profit off the album/Most I just consider friends”; “I’ve lost more family members/Not to cancer but the GOP/What’s the difference I’m not for certain/They all end up dead to me.” If Lament had come out in 2000, “Reminders” could have been their “One Armed Scissor” or “Pretty Lush,” a Trojan horse of a single that landed them on MTV2 and late-night shows. There’s no Touché Amoré song quite like it, a straight-up pop-punk singalong that’s just as goofy enough to be convincing and lyrically devastating enough to be what it really is: an otherwise prototypical Touché Amoré song about trying to find simple pleasures in friendship (human or otherwise) when nihilism feels far more appealing. Touché Amoré’s influences on Lament are not obscure—they made a “What’s Inspiring Album Five” Spotify playlist that included the softest Deftones song, the heaviest Real Estate one, and soft-rock staples from Orleans and Mike and the Mechanics. None of these reference points are illogical—country music shares hardcore’s proclivity for lyrical directness, while contemplative indie rock adds some silver accents to their blackened bleakness. Lament even makes a sensible kinship with Counting Crows, another metropolitan, California band whose existential yearning can pass for humble heartland rock. “Suffering has no purpose, ‘Round Here’ is an almost perfect song,” Bolm yells on “Exit Row,” and we’re all poorer for missing out on the opportunity to hear a crowd repeat “ALMOST!” like Bolm does a second later. In the midst of all of this atypical Touché Amoré music, the very atypical lead single “Limelight” now feels at home. At 5:03, it’s by far the longest song they’ve ever made—over the previous 12 years, exactly one Touché Amoré song has surpassed four minutes. The handclaps and backup shouts on the chorus sound like they’re being pumped from a Jumbotron. At a point where most Touché Amoré songs would stop cold, Manchester Orchestra’s Andy Hull comes in with his instantly recognizable twang, an apt segue to a coda showing off Nick Steinhardt’s newly acquired pedal steel skills. It’s a sequel of sorts to Is Survived By’s “To Write Content,” where Bolm recalled a conversation he had with Hull about whether their personal happiness would eventually become a liability for their bands. Seven years later, Hull’s music pops up in Hollywood films and Whole Foods, his commercial breakthrough coming on an album inspired by the birth of his first child. Touché Amoré have played Coachella, they created custom guitar pedals, and got signed to Roc Nation. Maybe the ceiling isn’t that much higher for a post-hardcore band in 2020. Bolm takes a hard look at everything he once romanticized on “Limelight”—“saying no just for the thrill,” public adulation—mourns his recently deceased dogs, and reflects on nights that go by without him and his partner sharing a kiss. But rather than being a self-pitying dirge for washed hardcore guys, it’s empowerment for anyone who’s feeling a little burnt out by anything that used to mean everything. A call to find new fires that will blaze slower and longer. For a band spooked by their status as role models, Touché Amoré still can’t help but lead by example.","On their phenomenal fifth album, the post-hardcore band work with famed producer Ross Robinson and come away with their most affecting and resonant music yet.

Soundkeeper,Gunn-Truscinski Duo,by: Sam Sodomsky,Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f7e4ff046ede078a464700a/1:1/w_160/Soundkeeper_gunn-truscinski%20duo.jpg,2020-10-12 05:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/gunn-truscinski-duo-soundkeeper/,Three Lobed,"When Steve Gunn was in his early twenties and living in Philadelphia, he learned a valuable lesson from solo guitar legend Jack Rose. During his shift at a coffee shop, Rose refused a free drink to a police officer and was fired—an opportunity he took to devote himself fully to his craft. Gunn, an aspiring musician at the time, looked up to Rose as a kind of hero, emblematic of the ways you can navigate the world without compromising your values. “I was always picking his brains,” he told The Guardian of their friendship. Now deep into his own career, Gunn has found several outlets for his vision. There’s his traditional singer-songwriter fare: the jammy, easygoing solo records under his own name, where he sings about memory and mortality, wandering and keepin’ on. And there’s the instrumental music where he blends these thoughts into a headier philosophy, following more closely in Rose’s lineage. With drummer John Truscinski, he formed an improv duo whose music is purposefully stark but remains deeply challenging and personal. When Gunn began devoting himself more closely to songwriting in the mid-2010s, he referred to his work in the Gunn-Truscinski Duo as a kind of meditation, a way to summon his most instinctive voice. But just as his singer-songwriter records have grown more accomplished, the Gunn-Truscinski Duo has developed its own evolving sound: a stirring blend of drone and folk music, occasionally softened with a late night hum recalling Yo La Tengo. Their songs often consist of a repetitive, ragged motif from Gunn’s guitar, paired with a lyrical pattern from Truscinski’s kit. It is slow-burn mood music, remarkable for how much it is able to conjure with so few parts. On Soundkeeper, their fourth and most ambitious album, the duo expands the boundaries of their sound while still holding back as much as they can. After two opening tracks where Gunn’s guitar work feels like scene-setting—chord progressions that resist the very idea of progression—the first riff emerges four tracks in, about 15 minute into the record. And the first thing that resembles an actual solo appears one song later, in “Pyramid Merchandise,” a ten-minute jam recorded live at Brooklyn’s Union Pool. Watching the video of their performance is a fitting complement to the patient sprawl of the record: Gunn tucked away on one side of the stage, pivoting forward, and Truscinski in the back, eyes fixed toward the ceiling. The live setting suits the duo, whose work has always felt more focused on the spark of creation than the immersive sound design of experimental artists in recording studios. The 16-minute title track, another highlight, was also recorded during a live set, and it serves as the centerpiece of the record: the explosion from which everything builds and fades. In the rest of the songs, Gunn and Truscinski experiment with new textures: Gunn dabbles with piano and 12-string guitar, while Truscinski abandons the drums completely for one song, accompanying Gunn’s slide guitar in “Northwest” with a deep, resonant drone. My favorite moments on the record arrive at the very end. “Windows” is a quiet, acoustic-based performance: the kind of laid back Americana that Gunn gravitates toward as a vocalist. To complement the music, Truscinski’s drum part follows the cadence of speech over rhythm; it feels spontaneous, intimate in a new way for the duo. A more direct conversation closes the record. Titled “For Eddie Hazel,” the seven-minute track pays tribute to the Parliament-Funkadelic guitarist whose playing spoke to a similar set of values as their own—virtuosic and refined, cosmic but grounded. Gunn’s electric guitar pulses and echoes, while Truscinski locks into a steady trance. It is the sound of two people with a rare gift for converging into one, or conjuring so many more, at their will.","In his improv duo with drummer John Truscinski, guitarist Steve Gunn makes purposefully stark instrumental music that remains as challenging and personal as his singer-songwriter records.

Nothing EP,Loraine James,by: Philip Sherburne,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f7e4ed0b1e2d332600be8d7/1:1/w_160/nothing%20ep_loraine%20james.jpg,2020-10-12 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/loraine-james-nothing-ep/,Hyperdub,"Loraine James’ music often feels like it’s on the verge of tipping into chaos. Competing rhythms run out of sync, throwing sparks as they scrape. Straight lines bend without warning, and smooth surfaces splinter. Rather than conform to a flawlessly efficient rhythmic grid, the London electronic musician’s beats twitch and hiccup, as though driven by a MIDI clock gone haywire. That’s as true of James’ quiet moments as her noisy ones: Even the most dulcet passages tend to jitter and glitch. A similar sort of unpredictability plays out across the breadth of her catalog. James has been putting out music for a while now; in addition to her debut album, last year’s thrilling For You & I, she has a string of Bandcamp-only releases going back to 2015, comprising brightly colored electronica, contorted club edits, and even ambient-adjacent atmospheres. No two records encompass quite the same style; neither do any two songs. Every track feels like the product of a blank slate. Her music is exhilarating in the fashion of a gamble that pays off against long odds, or a gambit that shouldn’t work yet somehow, miraculously, does. The four-track Nothing EP breaks new ground in four different directions. It is darker, on the whole, than For You & I; that album’s dreaminess has curdled, and its industrial punch—like the noise-rap beats of “London Ting // Dark as Fuck,” a song so concussive it could send clipping. running for cover—feels further corroded here, one fried circuit away from total breakdown. The most obvious change is the incorporation of vocalists, something James hasn’t done much of in the past. Early in 2020, she made an open call for singers on Twitter, and three of Nothing’s four tracks feature the fruits of those collaborations. Rather than spotlighting her featured vocalists, however, James tends to fold them deeply into the mix, where their voices turn murky, communicating more with texture than language. In the opening “Nothing,” the Uruguayan singer-producer Lila Tirando a Violeta moans, “I don’t feel nothing,” dolefully and almost indecipherably, her voice clouded by reverb, while rapid-fire arpeggios zigzag between vintage trance, the ice-castle maximalism of Rustie, and the jittery dissonance of early-’80s synth pop. The lurching kick/snare sequence balances the knitting-needle bounce of trap hi-hats with clanking metal and what might be a brief snippet of jackhammer. It makes for a jarring take on numbness—not a deadening blanket of sound, but an anxious, needling feeling, like the tingling of a limb that’s fallen asleep. She goes darker still on “Marg,” featuring the Iranian-born, Liverpool-based rapper Tardast, who grew up in Tehran and came to the UK in 2014. The title is Farsi for “death”; his lyrics, also rapped in Farsi, address the refugee experience in images of slippery ice and clipped wings. Occasionally, he cuts to the chase, as if no metaphor could contain his abjection: “Life’s getting worse every day.” His voice is mixed low, an unsteady burble of mutters and whispers surrounded by splotchy synths and heavy, distorted drums that crumple on impact. Layers of percussion—handclaps, hi-hats, tambourines, laser zaps—fall in uneven volleys, landing just shy of their mark, like shots clustered around a bullseye. Anxious and unsteady, the song feels like a harbinger of things coming apart, its joylessness an indictment of systemic failure. The tenor of the EP shifts in the second half. “Don’t You See It?” gets its melancholy tone from stately minor-key piano chords; HTRK’s Jonnine Standish sings wistfully of loss and yearning, with a resigned tone that recalls Bodily Functions-era Dani Siciliano. James’ production contrasts forcefully; the beat sounds like it’s been made from a lossy YouTube rip of crunching metal or breaking glass. Standish’s singing is the clearest on the album, and while her writing seems purposefully vague she lands a few truly memorable lines—“Summer is a traitor, ’cause summer’s moving on.” Even so, her voice serves mainly as the foil to James’ jagged beats, the soft underbelly of a hard-angled exoskeleton. At the song’s finale, following a climax powered by the record’s heaviest bass, James runs Standish’s voice through some kind of granular effect, crumbling her syllables like flakes of mica. The closing “The Starting Point,” the EP’s only instrumental, offers a stripped-down contrast to what has preceded it. The one-note bassline nags at the midrange; the brittle beat has the spikiness of early instrumental grime, while snapping syncopations flash back to UK garage at its rowdiest. Drawing on vintage IDM, what used to be called “abstract” electronica, and the example set by her Hyperdub labelmates, James’ productions have typically been part of a lineage of experimental dance music that doesn’t necessarily cater to the dancefloor, but “The Starting Point,” lean and muscular, proves James’ club mettle. It’s an exciting capstone to an EP that refuses to play by anyone else’s rules.","With corroded sounds and anxious, wistful guest features, the London producer’s new four-track EP breaks new ground in four different directions.

Love Touched Time and Time Began to Sweat,Pool Holograph,by: Steven Arroyo,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f7e4cf886e497a31b6ceba9/1:1/w_160/Love%20Touched%20Time%20and%20Time%20Began%20to%20Sweat_pool%20holograph.jpg,2020-10-12 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/pool-holograph-love-touched-time-and-time-began-to-sweat/,Sunroom,"In 2015, Wyatt Grant decided to upgrade Pool Holograph from a solo bedroom project to a proper band, adding three members including the brothers Jacob and Paul Stolz, a duo who help cultivate silky, vintage hooks for the indie-pop band VARSITY. The Stolzes are a cornerstone of VARSITY’s sound, but on Pool Holograph’s three LPs and one EP as a group, few melodies, if any, should be described as “hooks.” The band seems more challenged and rewarded by teetering on the edge of catchiness, constantly teasing and dodging the logical next note. Their latest, Love Touched Time and Time Began to Sweat, rides that line better than any before it. On their prior releases, Pool Holograph kept a dose of whirlwind aggression in their back pocket, succumbing to occasional rock-out urges as a way to break up their loping art rock. Here, they cut out the thrashing and growling in favor of  negative space. That openness draws extra attention to those melodies, which have a tendency to trip over themselves and still sound in control. A disclaimer: Pool Holograph recall Deerhunter c. ‘07-’10 pretty clearly, to the point that any Deerhunter fan will probably notice the similarities within seconds, whether in Grant’s extremely Bradford Cox-like voice or in the band’s movements between sheets of haze and punctuated clangs. Given this, Love Touched Time doesn’t always feel fresh, exactly—its strength lies instead in its light touch. Pool Holograph have refined a natural sense of balance between pristine and peculiar, dangling nice, simple phrases, then corrupting them slightly with odd steps that pique the ear. That’s clear in moments like the outro to “Medieval Heart,” Love Touched Time’s best song, when they squeeze in a stray high note at the very end of the repeating guitar line that’s almost an octave higher than any note before it, like an involuntary twitch that they anticipated and somehow finessed into their regular gait. It’s there when they feed a sample of ambient nature sounds into the background of the half-speed, 3 a.m. stargazer “Harbor Lights,” but faintly enough that it’s not heavy handed or distracting from the song’s plain beauty. At times, it’s there in a phrase from Grant’s choppy lyrics (“your hand in her bracelet” is a particularly alluring double-taker). Pool Holograph found their zone from a route of left turns and controlled collisions. With Love Touched Time, they give themselves some breathing room to explore it.","The rock group evokes Deerhunter while perfecting their own unpredictable way with melody, teetering on the edge of catchiness and constantly teasing and dodging the logical next note.

Innercity Griots,Freestyle Fellowship,by: Rollie Pemberton,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f7cb2d9fb870885c06b72d4/1:1/w_160/innercity%20griots_freestyle%20fellowship.jpg,2020-10-11 05:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/freestyle-fellowship-innercity-griots/,4th & Broadway,"A couple decades before Kendrick Lamar galvanized the Black Lives Matter movement with the rallying cry “we gon’ be alright,” a different group of Los Angeles rappers were saying something similar. The year was 1993 and the words rang out on “Everything’s Everything,” a song from Freestyle Fellowship’s Innercity Griots. The album was released on April 28, one day shy of the one-year anniversary of the Los Angeles riots. “Unhh! Unhh! It’s alright y’all!” the group chants over a rollicking funk track. Rather than steeling their community against an unsympathetic future, their words felt like a much-needed reassurance, a James Brown chorus line assuaging themselves and no one else: “Everything is gonna be alright!” Freestyle Fellowship were some of the first technically dazzling rappers to come out of California, paving the way for a number of artists who would soon change the national perception of West Coast hip-hop. When it comes to the history of flows, it can be tempting to jump directly from Rakim to Wu-Tang Clan without making a detour through Los Angeles. But the frenetic interplay between Clan members on Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers) is reminiscent of the Fellowship. Their fast, melodic “chopping” double-time raps were an evolutionary step for lyricism, one that influenced chart-toppers like Busta Rhymes and Bone Thugs-N-Harmony. Denzel Curry is a fan. You can even hear echoes of the four rappers today in the triplet flows and freewheeling strangeness of Future and Young Thug. But in 1993, Myka 9, Aceyalone, P.E.A.C.E., and Self Jupiter were just trying to put out their major-label debut. They hailed from Leimert Park, a South Los Angeles neighborhood known as “the creative center of Black Los Angeles,” home to several performing arts centers and a thriving music community. 1991’s To Whom It May Concern... was a staggeringly inventive and restless burst of offbeat conscious hip-hop—the first run was only 300 vinyls and 500 cassettes. After signing with Island Records subsidiary 4th & B’way and parting ways with founding members J. Sumbi and M.D. Himself, the group were primed and ready to make a grand statement. Produced primarily by the Earthquake Brothers with additional beats by Bambawar, Daddy-O, and Edman, the Fellowship’s new tracks tiptoed between organic and programmed music, largely forgoing sampling for live instrumentation. Innercity Griots was a pioneering example of this hybrid production style, helping to set the stage for later albums by groups like UGK and OutKast. Several songs used jazz tunes like Freddie Hubbard’s “Red Clay” and Miles Davis’s “Black Comedy” as templates but spiraled off into different directions as the house band, the Underground Railroad, jammed together. Though turntablist DJ Kiilu made sure the production didn’t stray too far from hip-hop, the tracks feature a cornucopia of instruments rarely present on a rap album in 1993: saxophone, trumpet, timpani, flute, trombone, vibraphone, upright bass. Compared to the muddy, traditional beats of their first album, the sound was substantially richer and more detailed. A Tribe Called Quest breathed new life into their parents’ jazz records. The Roots were a live jazz band that made hip-hop music. But Freestyle Fellowship were the only rap group in the ’90s that seemed to embody the style and spirit of jazz on a molecular level. They shared the effortless cool and tough countenance of the great bebop players from the ’50s without verging into jazz-rap parody. Their innate jazziness felt tangible and hard-earned. Days after the release of Innercity Griots, the Fellowship chose to perform live with jazz legends Horace Tapscott and Don Cherry, as well as proto-rap spoken-word ensemble the Watts Prophets, at Hollywood’s Ivar Theatre instead of sharing the stage with other contemporary rappers. Rather than sounding like a group of emcees rapping over jazz records, they more closely resembled a free jazz horn quartet taking turns soloing. “My rhymes take the direction of a jazz trumpet or sax solo, like Miles or Trane,” Myka 9 told L.A. Weekly in 2000. “If I was to rhyme in the same meter as those notes... that’s my concept.” Their A&R at 4th & B’way liked the album’s musical direction but wanted them to re-record the vocals. JMD from Earthquake Brothers disagreed: “No, it’s jazz. They’re reacting. Everybody’s reacting to one another.” Writing about rap and the L.A. riots for the Los Angeles Review of Books, critic Jeff Chang noted that many welcomed Innercity Griots as “rap’s equivalent to [Ornette] Coleman’s The Shape of Jazz to Come.” When he was born, Self Jupiter’s parents named him after Ornette. The jazz was in them. Freestyle Fellowship found emancipation through jazz, but they found their styling within the confines of the Good Life Cafe. Founded in Leimert Park in December 1989, the Good Life was an earthy health-food restaurant with open mic nights every Thursday that became an incubator for groups like the Pharcyde and Jurassic 5. In the early ’90s, these events attracted big-name attendees like Ice Cube, Snoop Dogg, Ice-T, Pharrell, and John Singleton. The Good Life served as a predecessor to the Project Blowed scene, and inspiration for influential club nights like Low End Theory and rappers such as Busdriver and Open Mike Eagle (Ava DuVernay, herself a Good Life emcee, directed a documentary about the venue called This Is the Life in 2008.) The cafe’s commitment to health went beyond just the food they were selling: profanity, xenophobia, and misogyny were strictly prohibited. If you swore, the crowd would boo you. (It famously happened to Fat Joe.) It wasn’t puritanical—it was intended to promote a professional artistic environment. Experimentation was welcomed, and the tough, discerning audience helped separate the wheat from the chaff. If you were wack, the crowd would yell “please pass the mic!” in unison as a form of “constructive criticism.” Freestyle Fellowship were the most respected group in the Good Life scene, and their music became a prime example of the freedom that can come from imposing limitations. Their whimsically funky single “Inner City Boundaries,” featuring stylistic forebear Daddy-O of Stetsasonic, received a tastefully minimalist black-and-white promo video of the group performing in the studio with a full jazz band, intercut with shots of people holding up cue cards like Bob Dylan in “Subterranean Homesick Blues.” Myka 9 scats and plays an imaginary trumpet as he raps. Compared to the playful Hollywood largesse of other videos from the same year, like Snoop Dogg’s “Who Am I (What’s My Name)?” and 2Pac’s “I Get Around,” it looks like a Truffaut film. The Fellowship weren’t all that concerned with following industry trends or being commercially viable. Another video, for “Hot Potato,” featured an alternate version of the song with different lyrics and performances than the one on the album. It was their way of recreating the atmosphere of the Good Life open mic nights, and of saying that rapping was like a beloved schoolyard game to them. But a bunch of guys angrily rhyming about root vegetables didn’t exactly set the charts on fire, and 4th & B’way struggled to market the group and get their songs on the radio. Other jazz-rap acts such as Digable Planets and Arrested Development enjoyed more mainstream success, but Freestyle Fellowship lacked those groups’ familiar samples and clear pop sensibilities. Instead, the label commissioned ads for the album featuring magazine quotes that focused on how good the group was at rapping. An interview in an April 1993 issue of The Source describes the group as having a reputation for being “rapper’s rappers.” When asked how they fit into the world of hip-hop, P.E.A.C.E. responded, “I see us in the doorway, but nobody’s offered us seats to sit down and lounge in the hip-hop arena yet, so we kinda in the middle.” They earned a 3-and-a-half mic review that praised them as “style junkies.” In an era when few rappers straddled both sides of hip-hop’s ideological divide, Freestyle Fellowship’s image was somewhat ambiguous. “People may say that we should talk more about what the gangsta rappers talk about,” Myka 9 told The Los Angeles Times in 1993, “but we’ll leave that to those rappers. We’d rather broaden our musical horizons than complain.” He saw his group as “liberators, liberating rap from its R&B/funk structures—that 4/4 (time) prison.” For Freestyle Fellowship, process was more important than politics. Listening to the album, it’s not hard to see which way their moral compass points. “I gotta be righteous, I gotta be me/I gotta be conscious, I gotta be free” could’ve been a slogan for the conscious rap movement that would be in full bloom by the turn of the millennium. “I am a Black man, I’ma survive!” Myka 9 repeats on “Bullies of the Block” with delirious, almost bemused anger, as if he were trying to convince himself that it’s true. But the next lines quickly shifted the sentiment from Martin to Malcolm: “Yesterday I had a fight in a nightclub/But I had my gat and I bust alive!” In the song’s video, an American flag burns. As much as the press tried to flatten their vibrant personas, Freestyle Fellowship complemented each other perfectly in the music. P.E.A.C.E., who struggled with paranoid schizophrenia, never sticks to a distinct rhyme structure or a particular voice for long, shifting restlessly from track to track and moment to moment. Aceyalone tethers the group to earth with his erudite personality, spinning a world-weary collection of Black fables sprinkled with elements of the Funkadelic, Run-DMC, and Egyptian Lover tracks that inspired him as a youth. On “Everything’s Everything,” Self Jupiter compares his recorded performances to competitive gymnastics. His verses occasionally take on a haunted affect, as if Vincent Price could rap. (Jupiter went to jail for armed robbery not long after the release of Innercity Griots, derailing the group until they resurfaced after his release with 2001’s Temptations and 2002’s Shockadoom.) But Myka 9, the group’s spiritual leader, is the kind of rapper whose exploits other emcees speak of with wide eyes and hushed tones. Daddy-O once introduced him to Afrika Bambaataa as “the best MC I’ve ever heard in my life.” His mellifluous, twisting flow skitters over beats like stones skipping across a pond. He never repeats himself stylistically but is nonetheless unmistakable on any track he appears on. Unpredictably free-associative, he scats, hums, roars, whimpers, and howls, opening up new galaxies of possibility with every verse. Among other influences—John Coltrane, the Last Poets, Miles Davis—Myka 9 also claims to be inspired by birds, his verses an attempt at replicating their songs with his human voice. Together, the four emcees luxuriated in their own creativity, rapping for the sake of rapping, a practice of pure technique where what was said wasn’t entirely the point. Even when they occasionally resorted to rap cliché, there was always something off-kilter about their approach that set it apart. The obligatory songs about weed (“Mary”) and women (“Shammy’s”) were way too bugged out for the masses. The vividly foreboding P.E.A.C.E. solo cut “Six Tray” details a twisted drive-by shooting where the aftermath of murder takes on macabre specificity not typically found in gangsta fare from the same time period: “Split second too late, brown hearse/Right door second, left door first.” On “Bullies of the Block,” Aceyalone raps about “making the kind of music that will outlast you all.” To me, that sounds like the ultimate goal of the griot, the African storyteller referenced in the album’s title. The griot’s purpose is to share wisdom from generation to generation by setting words to music. Over the years, this record has been passed from rapper to rapper and from fan to fan as a rite of passage, a lodestar that unlocks new potential in whoever hears it. The album’s verses are oral histories that have yet to lose any of their potency. In a 1993 interview with Rap Sheet, Myka refers to “the spirit of the die-hard rapper” as the essence of what keeps the Fellowship together. Through the music and legacy of Innercity Griots, that spirit seems destined to live on forever. Get the Sunday Review in your inbox every weekend.

Hybrid Theory (20th Anniversary Edition),Linkin Park,by: Gabriel Szatan,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f7ca0e61e6ce526f5eb94d3/1:1/w_160/hybrid%20theory%2020th_linkin%20park.jpg,2020-10-10 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/linkin-park-hybrid-theory-20th-anniversary-edition/,Warner,"Chester Bennington was 41 years old when he lost the battle he spent life urging people to overcome. The defining characteristic of Linkin Park’s music was how accessible it made the tools to deal with trauma, an offering intended both for their fans and Bennington himself. His death in 2017 was by all accounts a shock: to the band, to his family, and to the legions across the world who treated him as an inspiration, not just for his power as a singer, but for his dignity in recovery and honesty in relapses. He worked through years of sexual abuse and drug addiction on stage, on record, and through community outreach. For those who witnessed Bennington buoyant and free on stage just weeks before he died, the burden of presence is hard to shake. All of this weighs heavily on 2000’s Hybrid Theory, already the most popular heavy music of the 21st century. With global sales of 32 million—including 12 million in the U.S., a million of which has come in the past three years—Hybrid Theory is the highest-selling debut in any genre since 1988’s Appetite for Destruction. You’d assume being the only diamond-tinted rock album this side of the millennium might afford a smidgen of clout. Yet on lists of the best metal, hard rock, emo or straight-up rock, Hybrid Theory is often conspicuously absent, as if no axe-worshipping subtribe is willing to adopt it as their own. Nu-metal would seem the obvious category, but even though Linkin Park were saddled with the tag at the time, it was an awkward fit. They knew the nu- was loaded: Their blend of rapping, screaming, and circuit-bending rendered them suspect to the double-denim dinosaurs of rock crit, so they built a street team on chatrooms and trained in on untapped admissions of despondency and failure. They sang about being filled with tension, feeling betrayed by the light, wishing for a way to disappear. In making themselves small, they became colossal. Rather than re-re-evaluate the era in which they found fame, the 20th anniversary reissue of Hybrid Theory—featuring over 50 unreleased tracks, B-sides, remixes, live performances and rarities—encourages a closer examination of why this band went supernova. Today, it’s hard to look past the buddy act of Bennington and Mike Shinoda as the skeleton key that unlocked Linkin Park’s appeal for a wider spectrum of listeners. It almost didn’t happen. The group had been active for three years before the departure in 1999 of original singer Mark Wakefield (who went on to both manage Taproot and design the cover for System of a Down’s Toxicity). Even after Bennington was installed, Hybrid Theory’s demos show just how far they had to travel before arriving at anything resembling synergy. On early versions of “A Place for My Head” and “Points of Authority,” it seems as if Bennington and Shinoda are reading from different sheets entirely. Once they found a comfortable nook within vein-popping catharsis, this duality became the heart of Linkin Park’s music. Bennington and Shinoda were clear-eyed in facing down topics of duplicity, control, psychological and physical abuse, and suicidal ideation at a time when few ventured that far. To anyone tucked under a duvet running their portable CD player hot, this was a revelation. The pair switched perspectives and laced verses through one another with guile, playing out a bracing dialogue between id and superego. Bennington was particularly adept at self-analysis, explaining how the tide of anxiety inside of him could retreat only to return as a crushing wave of depression, or watching the last remnants of serotonin circle his mind’s drain like black tap water. Linkin Park were committed to making sure you knew their tastes lay beyond just riff-o-rama. The album was called Hybrid Theory for a reason (it would have been the group’s name too, if someone else hadn’t beaten them to it). Drummer Rob Bourdon grew up idolizing the limitless groove of funk and R&B musicians. Guitarist Brad Delson and turntablist Joe Hahn shared a love of glitch, boom-bap and trip-hop, which is why “Cure for the Itch” only ever feels one crab-scratch away from dropping into DJ Shadow’s “Organ Donor.” When a friend’s dad chaperoned the 15-year-old Shinoda to see a joint Anthrax/Public Enemy bill, his mind was blown. Across Hybrid Theory’s sprawl of extra material, you can hear numerous attempts to recreate that nuclear fusion—be it 1999’s “Step Up”; the hit it later was sampled on, the X-Ecutioners’ “It’s Goin’ Down”; or Linkin Park’s 2002 remix album Reanimation, a spirited-if-clunky attempt to bring the vibe of RJD2 and Rage Against the Machine under one roof. Few of the assembled extras eclipse Hybrid Theory’s strongest material—which is to say, everything up until the album’s final three songs. There are some winners on the box set, though. “She Couldn’t,” long withheld from public release due to an uncleared Mos Def sample, removes the band’s spiked exoskeleton to reveal the tenderness within. “Rhinestone,” which dates back to 1997, fares better than its evolved form “Forgotten,” the only track on Hybrid Theory that truly carries the septic taint of nu-metal. “Krwlng” rouses hidden emotion from “Crawling,” bassist Dave Farrell patiently winding cello and violin around a slower take on the original’s intro, the notes as icy as stalactites arrowing down into the mud. Trent Reznor might spit feathers at the comparison, but you could comfortably sub out “A Warm Place” on The Downward Spiral for the opening minutes of “Krwlng” and no one would blink. Like Reznor, Bennington paid the price for leaning so far into tortuous subject matter. “Crawling,” a presumed description of his teenage addiction to meth, often proved too upsetting to perform live without the help of the crowd. Celebrating the 20th anniversary of Deftones’ White Pony earlier this year, Shinoda signalled how Hybrid Theory came to sound both lacerating and palatable enough for mainstream audiences: “Even though [Deftones’] guitars were super heavy, oftentimes they felt smooth like a keyboard, as if the distortion had flattened it so much it was just a wash of chords.” A proper recording process brought out the best in Linkin Park. Collaborating with the Dust Brothers resulted in the low-toned loops of “With You,” though it’s the dynamic shifts which are most striking on playback, the track’s center of gravity lurching so fast it feels like getting socked in the jaw. Skyscraping hooks on songs like “Runaway” and “Papercut” were a by-product of confrontational producer Don Gilmore, who told the group plainly that their cluttered, primitive tunes would be also-rans if they didn’t cough up some melodies for alternative radio. Sufficiently rattled, they retaliated by penning “One Step Closer,” though they probably didn’t envision that Gilmour would react to being told to “shut up” by leaping for joy. One shoot of synchronized headbanging later and the band were on their way to a level of MTV perma-rotation that didn’t abate for years. And then there’s the crown jewel, “In the End.” Initially titled “Untitled” until D’Angelo’s version rocketed up the video charts, it is the clearest exposition of how the band’s songcraft set them apart from the pack. The glitched drum shuffle and moody piano that lead it off are as immediately recognizable as the nosebleed thrashing which announces “Master of Puppets.” For a song that telegraphs every move so obviously it starts with “it starts with,” “In the End” retains a rare capacity to thrill, even after 10,000 breakdowns-into-bellowed choruses and more late-night karaoke renditions than you might care to admit. Neither Shinoda’s low-risk, mid-reward flow, nor what Bennington would self-critique as “poor, poor me” bawling, would be nearly as captivating without the other one there to flank and fill the space. Following the emergence of every Stroke, Stripe, and louche derivative, a convenient narrative set in. Indie rock had come down from on high and blasted away the musty dregs of post-grunge and nu-metal, just as grunge once vaporized the cartoonish shredders of hair metal. Linkin Park kept up their hit streak on 2003’s Meteora, particularly with the opening MPC hits of “Numb”—and, by extension, the monoculture moon shoot of JAY-Z team-up “Numb/Encore”—piercing through countless bar mitzvahs, graduation parties, and grocery store speakers. They flashed stadium-sized ambitions by taking one step closer to The Edge on “What I’ve Done,” and came full circle by soundtracking a Transformers film that felt blatantly indebted to the CGI battle fantasies Hahn directed as promo. Four albums in the 2010s treated their internal chemistry as something to be distilled and apportioned: industrial one cycle, electronica the next, synthpop the next. Yet it is the five-single, international blockbuster Hybrid Theory that people return to time and again. It is here where all the band’s sharpest tendencies meshed and their less attractive aesthetic impulses were suppressed. Open discussion of mental health within pop, rock, rap, and every genre along the heavy axis has been normalized to a level unthinkable 20 years ago, for which Linkin Park—absent a frontman but now endeavoring to make new music together—deserve a significant amount of credit. On Hybrid Theory, Bennington stood tall for as long as possible until that wave washed over him.","The California band’s blend of rapping, screaming, and circuit-bending defied easy categorization. Their sharpest tendencies meshed on Hybrid Theory, the most popular rock music of the 21st century.

The Seeds of Love (Super Deluxe Edition),Tears for Fears,by: Alfred Soto,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f7caa447e7d1e8a8d6dfce6/1:1/w_160/the%20seeds%20of%20love_tears%20for%20fears.jpg,2020-10-10 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/tears-for-fears-the-seeds-of-love-super-deluxe-edition/,UMEVirgin,"To transform from a bedsit synth-pop outfit with a thing for prim diction to a global phenomenon projecting miserabilist pensées at arena scale must have ground Tears for Fears into a fine powder. Relaxing in a Kansas City hotel bar while promoting 1985’s quintuple-platinum Songs from the Big Chair, singer-guitarist-songwriter Roland Orzabal and singer-bassist Curt Smith were entranced by Oleta Adams, the Seattle-born R&B singer at the piano. Something went off in Orzabal’s mind. A couple years later, deep into recording their third album, he contacted Adams with a request: would she join their sessions? What became The Seeds of Love resulted from hundreds of hours of peripatetic experimentation, and, when the sessions stretched almost four years, probably just seemed pathetic to their dismayed label. By this time even Phil Collins and fretless bass wonder Pino Palladino had been enlisted alongside Adams. Released in 1989 to cautious reviews, The Seeds of Love dropped at a time when formerly obscure acts like The Cure and Depeche Mode were earning Top 10 singles. “Sowing the Seeds of Love” peaked at No. 2 on the Billboard Hot 100 in October, and, for the sake of Fontana/Mercury’s promo department, it better have. But The Seeds of Love had trouble keeping its audience. UMe’s fulsome box set, packed with jam sessions, discarded mixes, okay B-sides, and a remaster of the original, hopes to find a new one. The Seeds of Love remains a not-great album, but Orzabal finding the Little Feat in Songs from the Big Chair’s bombast has a seductive pull. The Seeds of Love marks the culmination of the neo-psychedelic soul hybrid that Orzabal had not stopped Rubik’s Cubing well into the summer of 1989. The allusive, Thatcher-baiting “Sowing the Seeds of Love” (“Kick out the style, bring back the Jam,” indeed) still thunders like the most tuneful of anomalies. Several sections grafted together, stitches showing, unfurl in Orzabal and Smith’s Beatles revue: trumpet solos, the lilting callback to “I Am the Walrus,” the love-power ridiculousness of the thing. It still sounds fabulous—the next chapter in Songs From the Big Chair’s “The Working Hour.” The other singles are better, if that’s possible. Skip the radio mixes of “Woman in Chains,” and “Advice for the Young at Heart”; luxuriate in the longer album versions, on which Orzabal, Smith (on occasion), and their players make silence as loud as six guitar solos. Neither Talk Talk nor Peter Gabriel could have come up with “Woman in Chains,” impressive in the specificity (and prescience) with which Orzabal examines his masculinity. It also plays like a gospel song interrogating itself, notably when the full band joins them for a “Hey, Jude” singalong finale whose prayer (“So free her!”) forgets God and looks Man straight in the eye. Earlier, as Adams takes over for the second verse, her plummy contralto hovers in its own space, somewhere between Palladino’s discreet plucks, Collins’ superhumanly steady rimshots, and an eerie sampled flute from Orzabal’s Fairlight; unlike the title character, who “calls her man the great white hope,” she’s asserted herself. The creamy, assured “Advice for the Young at Heart” boasts Smith’s only lead vocal; his falsetto suits what is in essence Tears for Fears’ sophisti-pop track, in which bongos and Nicky Holland’s piano add the lightest of jazz colorings. The album tracks don’t proffer such immediate pleasures; the band must have agreed, for the set includes no less than five versions of “Badman’s Song,” a boogie track fussy and ungainly in its original form but crisp in the so-called Townhouse jam sessions in which Tears for Fears rehearsed the material. Although the organ line perilously evokes Steve Winwood, Adams and Orzabal duet with such congruity that the discrete parts meld. (On the other hand, a version from discarded sessions with Alan Langer and Clive Winstanley has horn parts so zealous that the rhythm section sounds pinned against the wall.) “Year of the Knife,” which Tears for Fears never got quite right either (seven versions here, not counting remasters), lurches from a “Head Over Heels/Broken”-styled raver to a mix for Canadian radio that features a programmed dance rhythm with Madchester overtones. After debuting at No. 1 in the UK, once “Sowing the Seeds of Love” failed to dethrone Janet Jackson’s “Miss You Much” in America, The Seeds of Love sank, a victim of record company jitters. They wanted another “Shout,” another “Head Over Heels”—they might even have settled for another “Mother’s Talk.” In a year when baby boomer musical icons turned persistence into platinum—the year of Lou Reed and Neil Young comebacks, sure, but also Donny Osmond and the Doobie Brothers—Tears for Fears could’ve exploited pop culture’s obsession with the ’60s, reified and reformatted into Richard Marx readymades. Study the busy album sleeve: Sgt. Pepper with hints of a Benetton ad. Hell, months earlier XTC released Oranges and Lemons, a college radio hit awash in received 1968-isms. The stretch from 1989 to 1990 turned out to be the year of the knife for Tears for Fears. Tired and sidelined, Smith jumped ship after the tour. Orzabal, a devotee of their brand, released two enervated follow-ups under the band’s name. But the seeds he’d planted for Adams didn’t lie fallow: Her decent Orzabal-produced debut Circle of One included Brenda Russell’s “Get Here,” a Top 5 smash in 1991 and reality TV mainstay for years, and “Rhythm of Life,” found here in its Tears for Fears demo. At a friend’s funeral last March, her version of “Everything Must Change” devastated my fellow mourners. Smith rejoined Orzabal for 2004’s Everybody Loves a Happy Ending. To absorb The Seeds of Love box set is to admire it anew as a culmination, not an aberration. Thanks to this set, we can hear Orzabal assembling “Sowing the Seeds of Love” from blocks into its unwieldy, epic final form. In the call-and-response moments of the Townhouse sessions we can appreciate why Adams entranced two Arthur Janov-influenced Englishmen; noting how well Orzabal and Adams harmonized is a delightful surprise. And the still, sparkling “Famous Last Words” remains a forest pond of sound. “As the day hits the night/We will sit by candlelight/We will laugh/We will sing/When the saints go marching in,” Orzabal sings in the voice of a comforting pal. Four years of tumult to end here, from the mouth of the guy who sang, “Time to eat all your words.”","A 4xCD/Blu-ray box set unpacks the bombast behind the UK band’s sprawling 1989 hybrid of soul and neo-psychedelia, recorded over four years and hundreds of hours of experimentation.

Diamond Life,Sade,by: Clover Hope,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f7b60c15bf2768247125008/1:1/w_160/diamond%20life_sade.jpg,2020-10-09 05:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/sade-diamond-life/,Epic,"In 1984, while British new romantics like Duran Duran and Spandau Ballet filled arenas with enormous synth-pop, Sade became the minimalists, crafting quiet, vintage soul out of basic components. Their end product, Diamond Life, values brevity. The band had a weapon in lead singer Helen Folasade Adu—Sade for short—a modest contralto who wore hoops with a classic red lip and moved in silence like Carmen Sandiego. Despite early comparisons to the likes of Billie Holiday and Nina Simone, Sade, then 25, saw not jazz but Black American soul as her band’s core influence. “I’m frightened of anyone for one minute thinking that we’re trying to be a jazz band, because if we were, we could do it a lot better than we’re doing now,” Sade said in 1985. “Our music is clearly pop, because it’s easy to understand.” More precisely, their sound liquified soul and jazz into new-school pop. They were executors of spaciousness. With Diamond Life, Sade produced feeling music that became a prototype for a generation of singers who favored naked elegance: D’Angelo, Jill Scott, Alicia Keys. Maxwell later borrowed guitarist, saxophonist, and co-writer Stuart Matthewman for his own immaculate 1996 debut Urban Hang Suite; and Drake once equated the “dark sexy feel” of Sade’s records to those on his mixtape So Far Gone. The seductive undertones of artists like Tinashe and Yuna are similarly tethered to Sade, whose fierce dashes of sensuality originated here. Over nine tracks, Sade sings of unwanted separation and missed connections under the banner of “quiet storm” music, the nickname for mood-setting, after-hours R&B that powered adult contemporary radio. Washington’s WHUR-FM is said to have originated the format in 1976 in response to radio programming that featured predominantly white easy listening acts. Quiet storm was, in contrast, a platform for balladeers like Anita Baker and Luther Vandross and their mellow grade of soul. For Sade, a band that conveyed turbulence even in their subtlety, the label fit. The swagger of “Smooth Operator,” their breakout U.S. single, almost overshadows the fact that the subject’s task is to travel across state lines breaking hearts. Their album, for the most part, seeks out and cherishes serenity and stability in partnerships while acknowledging the rocky parts. Lead U.S. single “Hang On to Your Love,” a stylish, midtempo number, views commitment as a courageous act, and on “Your Love Is King,” Sade drags out her prose, praising ordinary love between the exhales of a sax. The song has all the romance of a shimmering sunset gondola ride. Born in Ibadan, Nigeria, Sade moved to England at 4 with her mother and brother. As early as 14, she began hitting nightclubs, and by the mid-’80s, the former art student turned menswear designer was casually experimenting as a backup vocalist in the seven-piece funk band Pride. Sade and Matthewman then morphed into a slicker breakout known collectively as Sade (a band name suggested by the singer herself), with Sade as their lead singer, keyboardist Andrew Hale, and bassist Paul S. Denman. At the time, Sade was living in a deserted fire station, where she and Matthewman would listen to her collection of soul records, from Curtis Mayfield to Nina Simone. When band manager Lee Barrett began shopping a demo featuring “Smooth Operator” and “Your Love Is King”—material they’d been performing in clubs across England—producer Robin Millar said label execs dismissed their songs as “too slow, jazzy, and too long.” Next to the electro-pop of that era, Sade read as desperately tender, which proved to be an asset. The band eventually landed a deal with Epic in 1983 and issued Diamond Life the following year. As with other idols whose enigma was part of their appeal, Sade practically invented the artist hiatus, taking years-long breaks between records, trading celebrity for freedom and longevity. She was, by all accounts, the coolest in everyone’s orbit. Tom Hanks, who appeared with Sade on Saturday Night Live in 1985, told The New York Times, “Calling her elusive or mysterious might color her as unkind or remote. She was not that. She was, rather, just very comfortable in the command of her art, as well as her presence.” Sade communicated gravity, often amid a cascade of keys and gentle sax riffs suspended in the air. Her voice entered the room like a chill. But her strength was in her ability to render truth and desire concisely. In relaying the sensation of a physical rush on “Your Love Is King,” she sings, “You’re making me dance…” and pauses before settling the emotion: “…Inside,” stretching its syllables into eternity. The tracks on Diamond Life play in the arena of blues because Sade sought inspiration in the love stories of soul music that centered everyday people. On Diamond Life, she’s still refining her narrative voice, so the allegory in a cut like “Sally,” a sauntering tour through “one angry day in New York,” about the Salvation Army, has good intentions, but it’s the rare Sade song that offers the pretense of sentimentality in lieu of the real thing. The working-class anxieties that became a thread in their music materialize on “When Am I Going to Make a Living,” a song Sade wrote on the back of a receipt from the cleaners one night during a downpour. Even when the lounginess is laid on thick, the album’s tones are subdued enough to be affecting. The damp ambiance of songs like “Frankie’s First Affair” and the six-plus-minute “Cherry Pie” burn like the type of molten soul expected to backdrop a film noir. While the track billows and tapers, becoming more atmospheric than dynamic by the end, Sade’s debut is a strong compilation of stories that bristle with simplicity.","Today on Pitchfork, we are taking a critical look at the UK band Sade—from quiet storm mainstays to defining a generational vibe—with new reviews of four of their records.

Promise,Sade,by: Naima Cochrane,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f7b5f5be545afd098e367b2/1:1/w_160/promise_sade.jpg,2020-10-09 05:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/sade-promise/,Epic,"High gloss, high glam, and high production-value defined the majority of pop music coming out of the UK in the mid-’80s. Synth and technopop traveled across the pond to take over U.S. airwaves and MTV programming blocks, while Michael Jackson, Prince, Lionel Richie, and Tina Turner were redefining the idea of Black pop-stardom. Through the excess, the London band Sade swerved outside the lane with their anti-pop debut, 1984’s Diamond Life. The cosmopolitan collection of sounds and tales from a life far sexier and more interesting than the listener’s changed music across genres, both ushering in sophisti-pop and pushing urban radio’s quiet storm format to a peak rivaling adult contemporary. Promise, from 1985, is the ideal second album, firmly establishing the Sade template without retreading the same material of the band’s debut. The album feels like a volume in a series, as does each subsequent addition to Sade’s catalog. I was nine years old when the album dropped, and my parents, part of the young Black middle-class sophisticate set that helped break Sade stateside, kept Promise and Diamond Life in rotation together as though the two were one long extended play. I’ve grown into the music—over the years, Sade has soundtracked my falling in love, recovering from love, and remembering lost love. When my friends became fans with 1992’s Love Deluxe, I was already a deep devotee. To date, Promise is the album that most resonates with me top to bottom. Promise is lush and unhurried, reclining somewhere between jazz, Brazilian pop, and soul. Multiple articles and reviews from the time of release leaned on the same descriptor for the singer, the band, and the music: “cool.” It’s mood music, at the purest definition: Stuart Matthewman’s sax, Andrew Hale’s keys, and Paul Spencer Denman’s masterful bass envelope listeners, transport them. The live recordings were a departure from the heavily programmed production of the era, and the sparse elegance that some found—and still find—too loungy is one of the primary factors in Sade’s sound and catalog aging beautifully. The lead single, “The Sweetest Taboo,” was a quick hit. It was likely chosen to kick off the project because it’s the most radio-friendly offering—it could have been tailor-made just for the late-night “quiet storm” radio format. The sexy midtempo was infectious to me even when I was 9 years old doodling the lyrics in English class—lyrics I didn’t completely understand in context—after hearing the song on repeat around the house and in my parents’ car. The percussion loop, Adu’s breathy vocals, the horn showcase in the bridge; “The Sweetest Taboo” is an accessible and efficient sample of all the best elements of Sade. But Promise’s opener, “Is It a Crime,” is Sweetback’s (the name Matthewman, Hale, and Denman perform under as a trio) showcase. This, for me, is the definitive Sade song; for six minutes and 21 seconds, we’re on a ride with Hammond organs and djembes with Adu pleading over big band-style crescendos. She describes her love as one that “dives and jumps and ripples like the deepest ocean,” and that’s what the song does, waves of sax and piano cresting and breaking over Adu’s insistent declaration of love. “Is It a Crime” is reason enough in itself to laud Promise as a masterwork, but the LP boasts a tighter and more confident Sade unit than Diamond Life, with more intentional story-telling and longer compositions. It’s a choose-your-own-adventure of sorts: You can wrap yourself up in the music and Adu’s soft-touch tone, recall or lament life and love through the lyrics, or fully immerse yourself with both. Lyrically, Promise is a collection of short stories exploring the varied stages of love and relationships; some autobiographical to Adu, who co-wrote every song on the album but one. While Promise—and Sade’s music in general—is often categorized as sexy or relaxing, the smooth ease of Adu’s vocals over the mellow instrumentation belies the melancholy in most of the album cuts. “War of the Hearts” frames the end of a relationship as a standoff; two people exhausted from hurting each other, but too stubborn to call the cease-fire that would end it. There’s “Jezebel,” the deceptively simple story of a sex worker, told in innuendos, “Jezebel, what a belle/Looks like a princess in her new dress/How did you get that?/Do you really want to know? she said.” Even though the lyrics are about Jezebel’s projected determination and control, the track is an example of Adu’s almost halting vocals conveying the emotion and backstory typically attributed to bigger voices. “Tar Baby,” one of the final tracks on the album and seemingly inspired by her own biracial background, feels under-examined now. Adu has apparently never talked about this song—it’s title heavy with suggestion, not yet considered a slur, but still problematic enough to be intentional during its release in 1985. It starts tentatively—the story of a shameful, unexpected pregnancy. But then it turns in tempo and lyric to a celebration of the undeniable love and joy of a child. The album ends with a sad smile, “Maureen,” an uptempo tribute to a friend Adu lost a few years before recording. Sade remains cheerful even in its refrain: “Never gonna see you again/And you’ll never meet my new friends.” Promise was the chaser to Diamond Life’s shot; one that positioned Sade for the elusive legend status she and the band have achieved today. They didn’t record Diamond Life with U.S. stardom in mind; that was a trial run. Promise was the commitment—a declaration of voice, sound, and style that was then unlike anything else in the mainstream sphere. Rather than a departure or different direction from the first album, Promise simply executes on a higher level, and the repeated success provided the leverage for the group to continue to follow their own formula, in their own time. The quiet storm era encompassed everything from straight down the middle R&B (Luther Vandross), to classic soul, to jazzy soul (Anita Baker), to British imports (along with Sade, soul band Simply Red and synth-pop group Art of Noise were popular with the after-dark format). It wouldn’t have been unusual for “The Sweetest Taboo” to follow gospel-bred singer Shirley Murdock’s powerfully delivered “As We Lay,” or precede newcomer Whitney Houston’s glossy and gorgeous “Saving All My Love for You.” But I never needed Sade, the singer, to give me more vocally; I didn’t need the lyrics to go deeper. “It’s all simple and unpretentious, and that’s what music is to me,” Adu shared with Rolling Stone in a rare interview in 1985. “It should take you somewhere and move you in some way, and that’s what I want our songs to do.”","Today on Pitchfork, we are taking a critical look at the UK band Sade—from quiet storm mainstays to defining a generational vibe—with new reviews of four of their records.

Lovers Rock,Sade,by: Rawiya Kameir,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f7b44d374118e08ad14f2a9/1:1/w_160/lovers%20rock_sade.jpg,2020-10-09 05:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/sade-lovers-rock/,Epic,"Even on Sade’s official website, you have to dig around to properly see the woman herself. The lead image presents Sade Adu on stage and in silhouette, shot from somewhere below. The bright, disembodied heads of her bandmates—Stuart Matthewman, Andrew Hale, and Paul Denman—float behind her, a rich supporting cast. More light lands on the bodypack hanging at Adu’s hip than on her face itself. And what a face it is; for the first half of the band’s nearly 40-year career, the dancing, almond eyes and wide, perpetually rouged mouth of its frontwoman marshaled multi-platinum after multi-platinum album. By 2010, though, Adu had famously turned away; for the cover of Soldier of Love, Sade’s most recent release, she offered the camera her back. But that retreat had begun in earnest on Lovers Rock, a decade earlier. The band’s fifth album was the first whose cover didn’t spotlight Adu’s full face. Instead, it’s her side profile, eyes looking down and away, that form its impression. Its 11 tracks share that understated energy, trading Sade’s signature luxuriance for a sparser, knottier sound, landing beautifully between the pastiched, jazzy pop of fellow ’80s UK breakouts like the Style Council and Everything But the Girl and the growing neo-soul bloc giving an edge to R&B in the late ’90s. Across Lovers Rock, Adu’s vocals, thick and low as always, recede into a breezy landscape of acoustic guitar, reggae bass, and simple percussion. “It’s less about the surface and more about the roots,” she said at the time. Of course, the roots had always been there, in the form of Adu’s unusual melodies, razor-sharp lyrics, and the band’s lush grooves. But on Lovers Rock, Sade gives them space, wisely surrendering Matthewman’s velveteen saxophone, the signature instrumentation that threatened to calcify them as a relic of the ’80s easy listening cohort. Instead of the sumptuous boudoir Sade had unintentionally helped turn into a cliche with the ubiquity of songs like “Smooth Operator” and “Your Love Is King,” they turn up the natural sensuality of a winding breeze and a low, gibbous moon. Adu’s instinct for sexiness carries across Lovers Rock, this time her lower register hinting at the kind of intimacy that comes from gentle restraint and sustained eye contact. Sade’s prolonged hiatuses now function as a social contract between the band and its fans, the gap steadily growing between each album. But the eight years between Love Deluxe and Lovers Rock was unusually long, even for the market demands of the pre-streaming era. In Sade’s case, the ’90s equivalent of “drop the album” memes manifested as gossip: that Adu had deep psychological or addiction issues, that only something dark and catastrophic could explain a desire for privacy. The rumors were so persistent, and so vague, that even in 2020, YouTubers can draw in hundreds of thousands of views to videos promising to explain Adu’s sabbaticals. In fact, Adu says, she was simply living, collecting personal life experiences to use as the source material for Lovers Rock. Slivers of those years are evident across the album: in the electricity of new love on “Flow,” the transformative joy of motherhood on “The Sweetest Gift,” and the torturous anticipation of heartbreak on “Somebody Already Broke My Heart.” The abandoned literary ambitions of Adu’s youth found a home in her songwriting, which eschews conventions such as rhyme and verse-chorus-verse structure and yet manages to translate and illuminate swathes of the human emotional landscape. In her hands, love is an outstretched hand: “When you’re on my outside baby, and you can’t get in, I will show you, you’re so much better than you know,” she promises on lead single “By Your Side.” Despair is almost noble, as on “King of Sorrow,” and pain is an accomplishment. “It’s down a rugged road you’ve come/Though you had every reason, you didn’t come undone,” she sings on “It’s Only Love That Gets You Through,” summing up the Capicornesque nurturing and Earth mother-sagacity that exemplifies Adu in the public’s imagination. As Sade had done before, like on the famine-referencing “Pearls” and the racial story of “Tar Baby,” Lovers Rock further expands the conventional understanding of love in pop music. Adu places social, humanist love right alongside romantic and interpersonal love. “Slave Song” and “Immigrant” are among the most moving of the band’s oeuvre: “Teach my beloved children, who have been enslaved, to reach for the light continually,” Adu prays on the former. “Isn’t it just enough how hard it is to live? Isn’t it hard enough just to make it through a day,” she begs on the latter. The cultural influence of Caribbean Britishness had long shaped Sade, but here it’s literalized. The album’s title and the sounds throughout point to the specific style of romantic reggae that shaped much of London youth culture in the 1970s. Lovers Rock was also, for Adu, who was then approaching middle age, a full circle meaning: She was spiritually indebted to the genre, as her career in music had accidentally been kickstarted by a chance run-in at a lovers rock concert. And the relationship that underscored much of it had led her to spend years in Jamaica during that sabbatical. I’ve always been compelled by the absence of a possessive in a noun (Lovers) that often requires it. The album stood out all the more in 2000, as pop became a shiny, slick vision of some imagined, tech-mitigated Jetsons-style future. Unlike other ’80s acts desperately seeking reinvention in the trends of the day, Sade avoided obvious dialogue with the charts. There are nods to hip-hop in the drums on “Flow” and digital experimenting in the synths on “By Your Side,” but for the most part, the band opted out. And yet Lovers Rock proved to be predictive. Echos of its style, the kind of mellow, vibey pop that could very well be described as Sade-core, have been palpable throughout the past decade, from the rhythmic R&B of Jessie Ware and Rhye to an entire generation of rappers. Among the most obviously indebted to Sade is Drake, whose grotesque registry of commemorative tattoos includes two of Adu’s face. The “dark, sexy” sound he introduced early in his career are direct reflections of the band’s influence. “I’ll call them ‘Sade moments,’ where you hear it, it hits you, and you feel something,” he told MTV in 2010. Though Adu never quite had a punk phase, she told the writer Michael A. Gonzales in 1992 that her proximity to the community and its ethos encouraged her to seek out an alternate career model and a non-traditional rubric for success. She landed on one that has been driven by artistic intuition and creative whims, not financial motivators. It helped that her model included negotiating an unusually large royalty share of what would be tens of millions of albums sold and the accompanying freedom to pursue a self-directed career, long and unhurried.","Today on Pitchfork, we are taking a critical look at the UK band Sade—from quiet storm mainstays to defining a generational vibe—with new reviews of four of their records

Stronger Than Pride,Sade,by: Stephen Kearse,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f7b3dfd4bab8e5825268e62/1:1/w_160/stronger%20than%20pride%20sade.jpg,2020-10-09 05:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/sade-stronger-than-pride/,Epic,"Sade’s discography has no sharp pivots or seismic reinventions, but there are plenty of slight tweaks and shifts. On Stronger Than Pride, self-produced after collaborator Robin Millar went blind during the recording of Promise, the English band began to whittle down their sound. Dispensing with the nightclub swing and louche, haunted characters of Diamond Life and Promise, Sade’s third album turned the band’s elegant, composed music into meditation, exploring romance as an interior experience. After releasing and touring their first two records in quick succession, the band took a breather for Stronger Than Pride. Written in Spain and London and then recorded in France and the Bahamas over the course of a year, the album took shape casually. Guitarist and saxophonist Stuart Matthewman recalled it as the first time the band composed songs piecemeal rather than as a collective, an approach perceptible in the looseness of the compositions. The album is a breezy, unrushed affair, where songs loop back in on themselves, sway in place, and fizzle out. Sade doesn’t do outright jams, but “Keep Looking” and “Give It Up” come close, locking into grooves and letting the melodies leisurely unfurl. The latter even features some horn blasts—practically an indulgence, given the band’s tendency toward restraint and poise. While Sade doesn’t reinvent itself on Stronger Than Pride, it does unwind. The music on Stronger Than Pride is reduced on all fronts: softer rhythms, lighter melodies, fleeter verses. “I wanted it to be more basic and less embellished, with the quiet songs quieter and the harder songs harder,” band leader Sade Adu said at the time. The record isn’t as minimal as that quote suggests (especially when compared to the ethereal, hollowed-out mood music of Love Deluxe), but it is certainly sparse. The arrangement on lithe title track “Love Is Stronger Than Pride” is open like a cloudless sky, carried by a patter of keys, percussion, and pan flute that drift around Sade’s airy voice. As she sings of a love that endures a betrayal, the weightlessness of the arrangements sells her candor. “I still really, really love you,” she croons. Adu maintains the directness and simplicity of the title track throughout the record. Her writing is noticeably less scenic and moody, treating love as more of a concept than an embodied experience. “To turn my back on you/Now would I turn my back on me?” she asks on the dubby “Turn My Back on You,” perhaps the only Sade song that could be described as hard. “Give it up, give it all” on “Give It Up” is delivered less like a steamy bedroom command and more like a call to prayer. Compared to the glitz and melodrama of  hits like “Smooth Operator,” “Is It a Crime?”and “Jezebel,” these songs don’t have much sizzle or flair. But there is an emotional clarity to these spare lyrics—a cleanness almost, as if Adu has rinsed them in cold water. The writing takes on a mantric bent as Adu reuses phrases and words from previous verses and repeats them by herself or alongside background singer (and secret weapon) Leroy Osbourne, whose rich voice adds warmth to her cool melodies. “Wanna share my life/Wanna share my life with you,” they duet on the upbeat “Paradise.” “Nothing can come/Nothing can come/Nothing can come/Between us,” they incant on “Nothing Can Come Between Us.” These chants aren’t particularly catchy, but their repetition imbues the record with a quiet anguish. Despite their outward mellowness, these songs always have a faint darkness at the edges. Matthewman, Paul Denman (bass), and Andrew Hale (keyboard) play up the loneliness and fear lurking behind all the affirmation. On the drumless “Haunt Me,” which is replete with lush riffs and fills, the production wafts around Sade’s pining whispers like a perfume cloud. “Haunt me/In my dreams/If you please,” she beckons nervously. Where most pop ballads center the voice, “Haunt Me” allows it to sink into the abyss. On “I Never Thought I’d See the Day,” another breakup tale, the voice is the focal point, Adu hitting the top of her range as Denman’s restrained strums and Hale’s hushed chords fuse into a fluid void. “I wish you could shelter me,” she nearly belts, her voice streaking through the amorphous mix like a lightning bolt. She sounds utterly alone. Stronger Than Pride is buoyed by Sade’s ability to coalesce around Sade Adu’s directions, fleshing her ideas out or ceding them space to bloom. The band, especially Adu, is sometimes mocked for being risk-averse and even-keeled—never breaking stride or cutting loose like the divas, heartthrobs, and pop rockers they adjoined on the charts—but in a way, their faith in each other is their gamble. Matthewman once described his bandmates as conduits, saying, “Sade doesn’t play guitar, but she plays it through me...we all kinda play each other that way.” Stronger Than Pride is the sound of Sade calibrating that affinity and establishing—for listeners and for themselves—that they are a unit.","Today on Pitchfork, we are taking a critical look at the UK band Sade—from quiet storm mainstays to defining a generational vibe—with new reviews of four of their records.

Shamir,Shamir,by: Eric Torres,Editorial Producer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f7b38d9d4d1a57aacd40cd3/1:1/w_160/shamir_shamir.jpg,2020-10-08 05:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/shamir-shamir/,self-released,"Shamir’s music has undergone a few striking overhauls in the past five years. The Las Vegas native abandoned the glossy dance-pop of his debut, Ratchet, after creative differences prompted a split with indie label XL, and spent six follow-up albums as an “anti-career artist.” That meant forgoing the pop-star trajectory and returning to the lo-fi, bare-bones folk and country music he first loved as a youth, taking detours through grunge and indie rock along the way. His uniquely self-reliant catalog represented an effort to divorce the industry and recontextualize himself and his music, mapping out a DIY route to his self-titled seventh album. Here, Shamir’s esoteric musical impulses meet Ratchet’s more conventional songwriting style without forsaking his carefully built artistry. An upbeat and vibrant album, Shamir spans alt-rock, folk, synthpop, and country, heightening the drama of each unpredictable genre shift with agile songwriting and steely confidence. Often Shamir feels like a pep talk to himself, with lyrics that offer self-assured counters to anxiety, intrusive thoughts, and difficult relationships. “I refuse to fucking suffer/Just to feel whole now,” he trills over jagged guitar riffs and blown-out drums on the standout breakup anthem “On My Own.” The song recalls the guitar pop highlights on 2017’s Revelations and this year’s intimate, fuzzed-out Cataclysm, reveling in a sugar-rush chorus that sounds beamed in from ’90s MTV. Shamir’s dexterous, featherlight voice remains his most powerful tool, able to bend from an offhand whisper to a high-pitched singsong and back down to a growl. “Paranoia seems to be my very best friend,” he quivers softly against a tense, feedback-loaded guitar on “Paranoia”; the clashing elements sound like we’re experiencing a sleepless night in his overactive mind right along with him. Shamir’s flexible voice imparts joy, yearning, or loss depending on what the moment requires, but the songwriting on Shamir feels newly deft and expressive as well. He worked with several collaborators to help bear out his vision, including indie rock producer Kyle Pulley, who appears on nearly half of the album’s songs. The teamup works especially well on “Running,” where a breezy echo of shoegaze guitar backs up lyrics that wrestle with the conundrum of wanting to be by yourself and in a relationship, too: “I prefer to be alone, but you can join if you like/I’ll stay strong for you ’cause I don’t want to be seen when I cry.” The sticky hooks frame a writerly self-reckoning, turning introversion into armor in a prescient, urgent thematic throughline. Shamir delights in pivoting from one mood to another, never getting too comfortable with one style for long. On “Pretty When I’m Sad,” a quick drum beat and multi-tracked backing vocals add a delicacy that belies the song’s depiction of a mutually destructive relationship: “Mess with me and face impending doom,” he sings sweetly over a jangling guitar. “Other Side” carries on the album’s contradictory nature, building a country-fried lament that scans as an outlier until its moody lap steel gives way to a sturdy pop chorus about reuniting with a loved one in the afterlife. The genre exercises only falter on the stark closing ballad, “In This Hole,” where a crackling vocal is set against heavy, plaintive strings. The mournful tone is sparse and effective, but the heaviness feels at odds with the rest of the album. Over a lone, echoing guitar on “I Wonder,” Shamir’s sense of grandeur comes into focus. “I wonder if you’ll be the death of me,” he ponders, stretching out the final three words in anguish. The song builds over a minute and a half until it crests in a blur of synths and drums, scraping up against the piercing emotion of his voice. It’s a raw performance and a gleaming example of the album’s ethos: There’s no element Shamir isn’t willing to try on. By collapsing genre boundaries and molding them into his own homespun image, he’s made an unconventional pop album entirely on his own terms.","The singer-songwriter’s vibrant, self-titled seventh album bridges the gap between his lo-fi impulses and the more conventional pop sound of his debut, without compromising his artistry.

Personal History,Ailbhe Reddy,by: Aimee Cliff,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f7ca5b8591b50e77ebe3620/1:1/w_160/Personal%20History_ailbhe%20reddy.jpg,2020-10-08 05:00:00,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/ailbhe-reddy-personal-history/,Friends of the Family,"Whether it’s a first therapy appointment or a first date, downloading an abridged version of yourself can feel like the most perfunctory of intimate experiences. For Dublin-based singer-songwriter Ailbhe Reddy, it’s far more interesting to think about what remains unsaid. On the title track of her debut album, Personal History, Reddy pines tentatively for her ex and “the romance of watching TV,” before the drums crash in to underscore her frustrated howl: “I don’t wanna go on dates/And hear personal histories.” Playing with the clinical undertones of the title, which is taken from the term for medical records, it’s simultaneously scathing and vulnerable. Compared to the softness of a lived-in relationship, Reddy seems to say, night after night spent sharing life stories with strangers feels procedural. Fresh off a year of psychotherapy study, Reddy consciously deploys therapeutic language throughout the album. “I protect my ego,” she sings of a fight with her partner on “Between Your Teeth.” The result is a lyrical voice that flits between clinical detachment and startling closeness, combined with a sound that is gutsier and grungier than the brooding folk songs of her 2016 and 2017 EPs. Personal History feels more aligned with inspirations Reddy has named in the past, like Phoebe Bridgers, Big Thief, and Fiona Apple. While her songwriting might not be quite on par, Reddy similarly mixes streaks of anger and catharsis with biting, self-deprecating humor. Previous EPs hinted at the emotional range of Reddy’s voice—as on 2017’s fragile “Relent”—but Personal History expands it hugely. Saving her powerful belt for only the most visceral moments, she shows a more restrained side on the somber, wintry piano ballad “Walk Away,” and evokes the light touch of Laura Marling on the gentle “Loyal.”  Not everything on the record is so inventive. “Time Difference” brings a fresh, upbeat feel to the tracklist, but its central concept—a long-distance relationship—feels under-developed. It operates on one level, but Reddy is capable of much more when she adds a layer of self-awareness to her angst. In the opening bars of “Self Improvement,” jangly guitar and harmonies set an uplifting tone as she sweetly sings: “I’m off the meds again...Until I can’t cope again.” It’s these jarring details that elevate Personal History: the knife-edge of Reddy’s voice when she tells someone they “talk like a historian,” or the cold, anxious synth stabs on “Looking Happy,” a track about watching your ex live their best life on Instagram (“Just turn it off!” she pleads with herself on the chorus). Reddy easily inhabits an aloof, deadpan character—see the “Looking Happy” video, in which she holds a Wednesday Addams-style staring contest with camera—but the richness and openness of her voice removes the record from cynicism. Instead, Personal History constantly confronts us with emotional honesty, pressing on bruises that feel all too familiar. Correction: A previous version of this review included mention of a song that was mistakenly included on an advanced copy of the album. That mention has been removed.","Balancing a gutsier sound against the restrained emotion of her voice, the Irish singer-songwriter’s debut flits between clinical detachment and startling closeness.

Bobby Bare Sings Shel Silverstein Plus,Bobby Bare,by: Stephen Thomas Erlewine,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f7dde0429dd317c0d518fc4/1:1/w_160/bobby%20bare%20plays%20shel%20silverstein.jpg,2020-10-08 05:00:00,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/bobby-bare-bobby-bare-sings-shel-silverstein-plus/,Bear Family,"Buried within the book for the hefty box set Bobby Bare Sings Shel Silverstein Plus lays a disclaimer by liner notes author Dave Samuelson: “Newcomers to the Bare/Silverstein catalog should note several of these recordings contain language that may surprise if not shock more sensitive ears. Always the iconoclast, Silverstein generally directed his ribald, often dark humor to a predominantly male audience. His world straddled both the ‘Playboy’ philosophy and the bohemian Beat Generation of the 1950s. Anyone offended by his depiction of women should remember his work mirrors the attitudes, sensibilities and humor of an earlier era.” A content warning may be necessary for listeners who are only familiar with Shel Silverstein as the author of children’s books, blissfully unaware of the existence of such gleefully pornographic records as 1972’s Freakin’ at the Freakers Ball. Much of Silverstein’s reputation rests upon the enduring popularity of The Giving Tree, Where the Sidewalk Ends, and A Light in the Attic, children’s books published between 1964 and 1981, years where he also worked as a cartoonist, a Playboy satirist, and a folk singer, a vocation he pursued despite the inconvenient fact that he couldn’t sing, he shrieked. He might not have been able to carry a tune, but he could write one, a talent recognized by Johnny Cash, who was drawn to the literal gallows humor of Silverstein’s “25 Minutes to Go” and put it on his 1965 LP Johnny Cash Sings the Ballads of the True West. Four years later came “A Boy Named Sue,” a near-novelty written by Silverstein and delivered with thundering menace by Cash—a combination that gave the Man In Black his biggest hit and opened up Nashville for its songwriter. Silverstein found some kindred spirits in Nashville—he wrote Waylon Jennings’ 1970 hit “The Taker” with Kris Kristofferson and authored Loretta Lynn’s 1971 “One’s on the Way” on his own—but he discovered his muse in Bobby Bare, a towering progressive country singer who had been kicking around Nashville for over a decade. Bare had a hit straight out of the gate in 1958 with “The All American Boy,” a loving parody of Elvis Presley, then scored a pair of career-making singles in 1963 with the lonesome “Detroit City” and “500 Miles Away from Home.” The country Top 10 was no stranger to Bare throughout the 1960s, a period where he demonstrated an ear for distinctive songwriters, helping bring Tom T. Hall, Mel Tillis, and Tompall Glaser into the spotlight. Before he met Silverstein, Bare cut “Sylvia’s Mother,” the number-five hit for Dr. Hook & The Medicine Show. “Sylvia’s Mother” was one of the last hits Bare had at Mercury Records before he returned to his old home of RCA, lured back to the label by then-president Chet Atkins’ promise that he could produce his own records. Ever since he heard Joe South’s Introspect on the radio in LA, he wanted to make a concept album, asking all of his songwriter friends to write him a song cycle, but they all demurred. Then, Bare met Silverstein at a Country Radio Seminar party one Saturday night in early 1973. The singer told the songwriter about his hard luck. That next Monday, he got a call from Silverstein saying he had an album’s worth of songs ready to go. The resulting Lullabys, Legends and Lies kicked off a lifelong collaboration between the pair. Until Silverstein’s death in 1999, Silverstein wrote country songs with Bare in mind, while Bare turned to Silverstein whenever he needed a new project, as he did for his 1998 supergroup Old Dogs. That record isn’t featured on Bear Family’s hefty new box set Bobby Bare Sings Shel Silverstein Plus, as the box set focuses on recordings made between 1972 and 1983, a period where Bare released three full albums devoted to Silverstein songs, recorded another complete set that sat in the vaults for decades, released another two where Shel dominated all other songwriters, and then regularly fit a Silverstein song or two onto his other LPs, leaving a handful of other tracks unreleased. All told, Bare recorded well over 100 Silverstein compositions during this period, and that sheer number is proof of their symbiotic partnership: the singer found his songwriter, the spinner of yarns found his storyteller. Their potent chemistry was palpable on Lullabys, Legends and Lies, the concept album Bare longed to make. Silverstein gathered some old tunes of his, wrote a few new ones, then handed Bare a bunch of songs hanging off the very loose notion conveyed in the title. Acting as his own producer, the singer kept things cheap and lean, creating the impression that he and his band were singing and picking at home. The immediacy of this intimacy was striking but Silverstein came up with an ingenious notion: record an in-studio audience’s reaction to the playback of the album, then add their whoops, laughter, and off-key singalongs to the finished product, giving the illusion of a concert album. Their gamble paid off. “Marie Laveau” gave Bare his first number one country hit and “Daddy, What If,” his sticky-sweet duet with his young son Bobby Jr., almost cracked the Top 40, sending the album into Billboard’s Country Top 10, its success paving the way for other self-produced mavericks like and Willie Nelson’s Red Headed Stranger. If Lullabys, Legends and Lies didn’t prove to be as enduring as what followed in its wake, chalk it up to the album’s contrived charm working a little bit too well: Some of Silverstein’s stories are a bit too cutesy, as is the framing device of the crowd. Still, the record is powerful, particularly in how Bare’s casual authority undercuts Silverstein’s impish tendencies, a quality evident in the still, plaintive “In The Hills of Shiloh” and, especially, how the singer keeps the winding story-song “The Winner” compelling, delivering each successive punchline with an widening smile. “The Winner” would wind up as the template for much of the work Bare and Silverstein would do together, but first they had to attempt to replicate the success of Lullabys, Legends and Lies. Inspired by Studs Terkel’s oral history Working, Silverstein decided to address the plight of those downtrodden by the recession of 1973 through Hard Time Hungrys, but it took a long time to weave his stories with man-on-the-street interviews, so the pair decided to bash out Singing in the Kitchen first. Billed equally to Bare and his family, Singing in the Kitchen built off the success of “Daddy What If,” finding the amiable patriarch singing kid-friendly songs with his children. Listening to it is like viewing snapshots of another family, one you might not know particularly well: their affection is evident, but not quite contagious. Still, Singing in the Kitchen bought Bare time to complete Hard Time Hungrys, the most ambitious record he ever made. The attempt to cross-pollinate Silverstein’s storytelling with audio vérité is admirable but also exhausting. Every time the music gains momentum, like when the tongue-in-cheek blues “Alimony” rambles into view, the interviews cut in and derail the record. These three albums may have flaws, but they’re flaws born of ambition, and that adventurousness helped place Bare in the vanguard of the burgeoning outlaw country movement. He also was scoring just enough hits to gain the attention of other labels, so he decided to jump ship for Columbia in 1978, a move that coincided with a brief ill-fated association with rock manager Bill Graham. RCA, particularly its Nashville president Jerry Bradley, didn’t take well to this news. Bradley never agreed with Atkins’s decision to let Bare produce his own records, so when the singer decided to leave the label, RCA buried Great American Saturday Night, a Silverstein-written concept album capturing all the different kinds of debauchery and despair on a random weekend night. Originally planned for 1977, the version on this box is longer than the BFD release from earlier in 2020 and, in this narrative-filled edition, it’s the clear bridge between the duo’s earlier records and Bare’s sleazy, Silverstein-heavy 1980 records Down & Dirty and Drunk & Crazy; it tempers its cinematic scope with earthy lasciviousness. Bare recorded songs by other writers during the latter half of the 1970s—1977 brought Me And McDill, a salute to Bob McDill—but he still found a way to fit Silverstein songs onto his other concept albums (1975’s Cowboys and Daddys) and kept him by his side when he took a stab at crossover success with Bare, his 1978 debut for Columbia. This box collects these tunes, as well as several unreleased cuts, as a pair of “Stray Bare Tracks” discs, collections that have more in common with the middle-aged crazies of Down & Dirty and Drunk & Crazy than the redneck hippie dreamer of Lullabys, Legends and Lies. The contrast between these two phases is startling. The first three records are intimate and sweet, sometimes hinting at earthier concerns, but their good intentions triumph over their devilish instincts. That’s not the case with the rest of the material on the box. Once Bare and Silverstein grew comfortable with each other, they indulged in each other’s strengths and excesses as only a pair of close friends can. Appropriately, as the pair’s familiarity increased, the music turned bolder, even burly, with the productions accumulating some slick period flair. Bare’s records wound up pitched halfway between swaggering outlaw and smooth Urban Cowboy country-pop crossover, a transition that suited Silverstein’s narrowing of vision. Where he once devoted himself to myths and finding the mysteries in everyday lives, he now busied himself with mundanities of modern life: telling dirty jokes, sucking on a glass of wine at TGIFridays, and cursing diets. He still could summon some genuine pathos—as late as 1983, Bare cut the hard barroom weeper “Drinkin’ from the Bottle”—but these Stray Tracks also show how Silverstein sometimes like to push Bare right up to the edge and the singer happily went along. With its chorus of “does anybody here want to fuck or fight,” the title track of Great American Saturday Night itself is testament to this fact, but “They Held Me Down”—an unreleased Bare track Silverstein recorded for his 1978 LP Songs and Stories—is a veritable index of immoralities, delivered with a sideways grin. Bare channeled some of this cheerful perversion onto Drunk & Crazy, an album where he laments his hard-rocking band and celebrates the sloth of “Drinkin’ and Druggin’ and Watchin’ TV.” Drunk & Crazy is also home to “If That Ain’t Love,” a song that could have earned the box set’s disclaimer all on its own. With his tongue firmly in cheek, Silverstein’s narrator chronicles a list of domestic terrors, and while the abuser is clearly the one the songwriter is targeting as the butt of the joke, the intensity of the imagery (“""Baby I’m sorry I done you like that/I called you a name and I gave you a whack/I spit in your eye and gave your wrist a twist/And if that ain’t love, what is”) is as jarring as the rowdiness of the performance. That seediness illustrates that it was a long road from the genial tall tales of Lullabys, Legends and Lies and the dive-bar soundtrack of Drunk & Crazy. Hearing Bare and Silverstein make that journey over the course of these eight CDs leaves you with a new appreciation for their funky, off-color chemistry.","Shel Silverstein’s reputation rests on his children’s books, but he also had a long, illustrious songwriting career in Nashville. No one performed his ribald, irreverent songs more than the progressive country singer Bobby Bare, and this box set collects their work.

Phoenix: Flames Are Dew Upon My Skin,Eartheater,by: Chal Ravens,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f721a37b721798c1a9de152/1:1/w_160/Pheonix-%20Flames%20Are%20Dew%20Upon%20My%20Skin_eartheater.jpg,2020-10-08 05:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/eartheater-phoenix-flames-are-dew-upon-my-skin/,Pan,"The most jarring moment of Eartheater’s fifth album comes during “Volcano,” a sunken lament for misguided love. Alexandra Drewchin’s voice—her most versatile resource, often pushed to ethereal or guttural extremes—cuts through to declare: “I’m obsessed with this grain of salt/I’m fixated on a grain of sand.” With her voice unaffected, grounded in the alto section of her three-octave range, Drewchin, who often appears otherworldly in her music, almost sounds like a woman you might know. Firmly bound to themes of renewal and rebirth, Phoenix: Flames Are Dew Upon My Skin is a winning experiment in economy and earthiness from an artist previously known for ornament and excess. The Queens-based artist’s first two albums were a snug fit on freaky electronics label Hausu Mountain. In 2015, both Metalepsis and RIP Chrysalis emerged out of enchanted thickets of wyrd folk, fingerpicked guitar, softly throbbing synths, and Drewchin’s infinite cast of voices, from sighing banshee to vocal-fried mumble rapper. Coupled with an alluring backstory—a home-schooled musical prodigy raised on a horse farm, now ensconced in New York’s avant-garde art and dance scene—the whole package appeared sprinkled with psychoactive fairy dust. That version of Eartheater might have ended up making cerebral sideways pop for a label like 4AD or Sacred Bones, but three years later she joined Berlin’s PAN for the cold and prickly IRISIRI, a dissociative mix of techno, cloud rap, illbient beats, operatic wails, and post-Young Thug ad libs. In 2019 she strayed even further from the sylvan path as techno producers including New York’s AceMo pumped a dark electronic pulse through the self-released mixtape Trinity. Each of those records extended Drewchin’s cinematic universe, her voice embodying an ever multiplying dramatis personae, her jump-cut arrangements catering to her infinite influences—a strategy that occasionally collapsed under its own ambition. On Phoenix, though, Drewchin forces the rainbow back in the prism, concentrating her vast range of identities and impulses into a unified beam. The songwriting is sharp and spare, and her lyrics are easier to decipher, less tangled in delirious wordplay. Acoustic guitar returns to the fore, sometimes fingerpicked in ripples, like an old Leonard Cohen ballad. Simple chord progressions are gilded by celestial strings from Spanish conservatory group Ensemble De Cámara, and harp and violin from Marilu Donovan and Adam Markiewicz of New York duo LEYA. Some of the material was recorded last year for a theatrical collaboration with Brighton duo Semiconductor, whose audiovisual spectacle included stop-motion images of luminous crystals. Drewchin soundtracked the clips with shivering strings, heavy-metal bass blasts, the ching of an ice pick, and swings squeaking in the park; these turbulent sound collages act as interludes between the vocal-led songs on the album. The album itself came together during a 10-week stint at FUGA, an artist residency program in Zaragoza, Spain. The region’s rugged terrain finds its way into the strata of songs like “Volcano” and the logorrheic “Diamond in the Bedrock,” where Drewchin’s dense poetry is interrupted by Migos-ian syncopation (“Cut through the graves/Cut through the graves”), a technique she also employed on IRISIRI. But for the most part she eschews the proggy density of her earlier records in order to dig down to her core, open to whatever strange truths might be uncovered. “The meaning hasn’t come up yet,” she squeaks on “Below The Clavicle” over swelling strings; “​it’s still under the surface.” The phoenix is an ancient and familiar symbol of rebirth, a mythical creature born out of its own destruction. Drewchin adopts her new avatar with enthusiasm: She gets into character on the album’s sleeve with bony wings sprouting from her back and golden sparks shooting up to her ass cheeks—half thirst trap, half LARPer fantasy. The album’s opening lines, repeated on the final track, illuminate the theme: “The only way out of this is through/Cross my heart and hope to die beyond hope/I’ve seen the phoenix rise out of my ashes.” What turmoil has spurred this renewal? Drewchin’s last few years have been dramatic: on top of the albums, tours, and commissions there’s been stolen gear, a hard drive failure, and the end of a long relationship. Moving on from the past is standard stuff for an album concept, but in her telling it sounds like she has cut the cord in order to commit herself totally to her art, happily self-partnered with her interior alter egos. Several songs seem to take place during a final tryst: “You and I don’t need to be more than just right now/But just right now could steal a lifetime/So I’m inclined to break away,” she warns. When she “falls into bed with you again” on “Fantasy Collision,” she likens the experience to a car crash–ouch–before “rising from the wreckage.” Drewchin recently admitted to The Face that she thinks the album “teeters on corny,” acknowledging that getting too close to those delicate heartstrings tends to turn off the chin-stroking set: too simple, too emotional, too feminine, eww. But, she added, “I do also think that corny is adjacent to iconic.” The oldest, most elemental myths are often the most powerful, and the force of Phoenix, like its fiery namesake, stems from its simplicity.","After 2018’s prickly IRISIRI, the Queens experimental musician narrates a personal and artistic rebirth in spare songwriting fleshed out with acoustic guitar, strings, and turbulent sound collages.

Savage Mode 2,21 SavageMetro Boomin,by: Alphonse Pierre,Staff Writer ,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f7b3ba12dd72c64377cf95b/1:1/w_160/savage%20mode%202_21%20savage%20metro%20boomin.jpg,2020-10-07 05:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21-savage-metro-boomin-savage-mode-2/,Epic,"Savage Mode 2 wants to be a moment, at a time when the only moments that seem to matter are life-and-death. It’s the sequel to the mixtape immortalized in the Atlanta hip-hop canon, the one that made 21 Savage a star and cemented Metro Boomin as the signature rap producer of the 2010s. It’s Metro’s official return after almost two years of near silence, and most notably, 21’s first release since he was unjustly detained and threatened with deportation by ICE. It’s packaged with a cover made by the historic Pen and Pixel company and it features Drake and Young Thug guest appearances, along with Morgan Freeman, who gives a Big Rube-style monologue about “Snitches and Rats.” Sequels are supposed to be bigger, louder, and more expansive. Throughout Savage Mode 2 it’s obvious that this duty is weighing on their shoulders. Savage Mode was a straightforward collection of nine good-to-great songs, while the sequel is intended to be a legacy-defining stamp. You can tell that every piano chord, 808, and sample chop was endlessly stressed over; Metro’s production is not as effortless as it once was. At their worst, Metro and 21 try too hard. On “Said N Done,” Metro’s flip of Stephanie Mills’ “Touch Me Now” is smooth, but given to 21, it feels like it’s only purpose is to capitalize on the modestly viral Instagram videos of the rapper singing along to R&B hits. When the Atlanta rapper unleashes the in-his-feelings side of his personality it’s gimmicky, which is most clear on the Drake-assisted “Mr. Right Now.” “Slip and slide like a waterfall/You need some TLC, we can creep if you want,” raps 21, squeezing in the most surface-level ’90s R&B references imaginable. But Metro is up to the task, despite some overthinking. The St. Louis-raised beatmaker does more than simply lay the foundation for 21 Savage, who at his best sounds like the rare villain in a slasher movie that you root for. Metro completely controls the brooding atmosphere, with beats that lay drum patterns rooted in Atlanta trap and Memphis crunk over an unpredictable mix of melodies and samples. “Glock in My Lap” is arguably the most cinematic beat Metro’s ever made. Produced alongside Honorable C.N.O.T.E. and Southside, their three consecutive producer tags add tension like the consecutive footsteps on a creaky floor in a horror movie. All 21 has to do is follow Metro’s lead. Similarly, the busy “Rich Nigga Shit” instrumental madly weaves together a hypnotic string section with a breezy West Coast vibe (and lots of cowbell). It shouldn’t work but does, like a french fry dipped in a milkshake. 21 comes off slightly unnatural on the song, ultimately overshadowed by a Young Thug guest verse memorable enough to reignite Metro Thuggin pipedreams. 21 Savage is only comfortable when Metro is slightly more reserved. “Slidin” could fit on any Metro project released in the last half decade, and 21 is naturally rapping about violence as if he gets a kick out of it like O-Dog in Menace II Society: “I just made an opp do the running man,” he raps. His punchlines have been better, but he makes up for it by sounding like he’s skipping through a wasteland. “Steppin On Niggas” is the one Metro risk where 21 holds his own; he flows like he spent time studying Eazy-E. Nevertheless it’s hard to be swept up by the aura of Savage Mode 2 when it’s just fine. The first Savage Mode didn’t become an ATL classic because of celebrity cameos or Billboard numbers; it was because Metro and 21 were at the peak of their powers, and only the producer is close here. 21 Savage is just along for the ride.","The sequel to the canonical Atlanta mixtape is meant to be a legacy-defining stamp, but despite all its glossy guest stars (Morgan Freeman!), it never rises above “just fine.”

"Speed, Sound, Lonely KV EP",Kurt Vile,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,"https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f7b39f76afbd0e34638f635/1:1/w_160/Speed,%20Sound,%20Lonely%20KV%20EP_kurt%20vile.jpg",2020-10-07 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/kurt-vile-speed-sound-lonely-kv-ep/,Matador,"Kurt Vile and John Prine were natural collaborators. In addition to their  knack for using observational humor to magnify pathos and pathos to magnify humor, both have talents that have been largely overlooked. Prine is such a remarkable and idiosyncratic songwriter that his lyrics often overshadow his innovative guitar playing, which involves a two- instead of three-finger picking style. Vile is such an ingenious guitarist that his playing often overshadows his equally imaginative songwriting. In recent years they’ve shared stages together in Philadelphia and Nashville (including the Grand Ole Opry), and earlier this year, just months before Prine’s death, they even recorded a song together. Vile calls himself a fanboy; Prine called him a “mellow rock and roller in a stroller.” I have no idea what that means, but it sounds true. The song they recorded during their joint session, a cover of Prine’s “How Lucky,” off 1979’s Pink Cadillac, anchors Vile’s new EP, which serves as a loose tribute to his hero. There’s also a solo cover of the 1986 tune “Speed of the Sound of Loneliness,” which Vile covered with Prine on Prine’s final tour, and Prine’s spirit lingers in the two new originals. But speed, sound, lonely (kv) is also an ode to the city of Nashville, to all the amazing musicians there, and to the spirit of collaboration that still thrives in the city after so many revolutions within the music industry. Vile booked sessions at the Butcher Shoppe, the studio and hangout owned by producer David Ferguson, known for his work with Prine, Sturgill Simpson, and Johnny Cash. In addition to Matt Sweeney and Dan Auerbach, his backing band was stocked with some of the finest musicians in the city, representing generations of country artists: keyboardist Bobby Wood, bassist Dave Roe, mandolin virtuoso Pat McLaughlin, and drummer Kenny Malone. Recorded over several years during several visits to Nashville, the EP could easily have turned out like vacation photos: interesting to those who were there and a snooze to everybody else. But these songs not only sound great—mostly acoustic in their arrangements, crisp and warm in their production, and lively in their performances—but that sense of camaraderie draws out something essential in Vile’s singing and playing. As a guitarist, he’s fine at monologues, but he’s a better conversationalist. On these songs, he reacts to these veterans and lets their ideas swim around in his head for a little bit. That comes through on “Gone Girl,” his cover of a deep Cowboy Jack Clement cut. Vile savors the eccentricity of the melody, but he seems fascinated by the parallax overlay of instruments, how they snap together tightly but loosely, especially during the long sing-along outro. This is an EP full of lengthy outros, where the band just keeps on playing. Closer “Pearls” even includes a false stop; the music kicks up again almost of its own accord. There’s no purpose to it other than simply enjoying the sound. Vile loves small moments like these, everyday joys that might go unnoticed. He even gets a full song out of a simple dandelion: “You can blow on ‘em or you can just hold ‘em,” he sings, finding beauty in the fleeting moment as McLaughlin’s mandolin trills like those little white tufts caught in the breeze. Vile’s music can be reassuring and, at its best, transporting. Featuring both men singing and picking together, “How Lucky” considers all the glorious details in the world that greet us every day, but acknowledges there are infinitely too many for our brains to catalog and archive. The point is, you’ll never run out. “There was all these things that I don't think I remember,” they sing together on the final verse, before realizing, “Hey, how lucky can one man get.” It doesn’t feel quite as momentous as you’d expect from a meeting of these two mellow rock and rollers, and that’s okay. It’s sweetly minor, much like the other songs on here. That might not be enough to sustain a full album, but it’s lovely for an EP.","Recorded at Nashville’s famed Butcher Shoppe, Vile’s lovely and bittersweet new EP mixes covers and originals, including a duet with the late John Prine.

May You Be Held,Sumac,by: Grayson Haver Currin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f7c92f87e7d1e8a8d6dfcaf/1:1/w_160/Sumac%20-%20May%20You%20Be%20Held.jpg,2020-10-07 05:00:00,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/sumac-may-you-be-held/,Thrill Jockey,"Few bands clad a soft heart in tensile steel quite like Sumac. All of the abstruse metal trio’s four albums over the last five years have been ever more imposing, like self-perpetuating obstacle courses in hell. Ricocheting between formidable doom and barbed improvisation, Sumac sound preternaturally belligerent. But the group’s core is the spiritual yearning of Aaron Turner, who since his later days in Isis has often attempted to repurpose metal’s malevolent mechanics for personal transcendence. Sumac’s May You Be Held might be the closest he has ever come. For a vertiginous hour, Sumac pirouette around riffs and collapse into bedlam, hurtle through feedback and snap back into lockstep. As violent as they may sometimes seem, these songs are timely psalms of perseverance and rebirth, weaponized for whatever comes next. Three years ago, Sumac traveled to Tokyo to work with Japanese experimental godhead Keiji Haino. That experience not only led to two intriguing collaborative LPs but also challenged Sumac to stretch their parameters; their subsequent full-length, 2018’s colossal Love in Shadow, disrupted their formerly relentless force with unmoored instrumental explorations and extreme dynamics. May You Be Held indulges this tension like a favorite new habit. The metal sections are mightier, tightened with pneumatic precision. The improvisations, meanwhile, are more adventurous, pushing harder against the boundaries of the songs themselves. The uncanny hybrid suggests something Peter Brötzmann’s Machine Gun band might have made in a different setting, or something his son, Caspar, might have eventually found with his own Massaker. Where those splenetic groups decried our failures, Sumac’s tirades ponder fixing them, too. Sumac are at their most compelling on tracks that occupy an LP’s entire side, where disparate elements can clash at length. They race, for instance, into the 20-minute title track like a power trio of agile all-stars, moving in perfect lockstep through a rhythm and riff that recall Touch & Go’s best toughies. It begins with a bleak picture of a warming world, scarred by fires and floods and droughts. But in the second half, after an impasse of noise that curdles until it crumbles, Turner shifts into a prayer—perhaps for the next generation (he is a new father, after all), perhaps for the world at large. “May the light dance in your eyes,” he shouts as the song flirts with anthem status, like “Forever Young” for metal-loving parents. “May your limbs move through gleaming waves.” Sumac’s jarring sounds emphasize the long odds of such well wishes. “Consumed,” likewise, is a hard-won paean to resilience—and perhaps the pinnacle of Sumac’s first six years. For most of these 16 minutes, Sumac seesaw between churning sections so muscular they’d make Mastodon flinch and stark atmospheric spans that feel like walking into the mouth of some haunted cavern. Turner scowls at a world of ruin, a place of acrid smoke and desiccated bodies. The band slams into a wall of feedback only to return twice as heavy, twice as fast, and exponentially more exhilarating. Turner sings of a hero born to save the world, or at least believe that it might be saved. It’s an evangelical moment, enough to make you momentarily trust in deliverance. May You Be Held works a lot like a church service—tales of tribulation and evil meted out alongside words of encouragement, delivered with the high volume of utter conviction. The album begins with a gorgeous but ghostly invocation in which Nick Yacyshyn’s bowed vibraphone drones wrap around Turner’s meticulous feedback and Brian Cook’s rumbling bass like lace. An hour later, the record ends with a furtively optimistic benediction: A stunted guitar riff and faint percussion crawl from the morass of a church organ played by Turner’s collaborator and wife Faith Coloccia. “Metal has always been for me an affirmation of life, one of the only ways I’ve felt spiritual ecstasy,” Turner recently told me. “Sumac is almost this ritualistic practice of tapping into that energy.” Both Turner’s stentorian bark and Sumac’s bellicose sound can be off-putting; this is not passive or polite music. But this kind of sermon feels especially galvanizing right now, in a moment where a steady tide of endless dread suggests at least the possibility of actual insurgency. May You Be Held reckons with how bad it may truly get—“Vomit and ash/Spilled across the floor,” Turner grunts at the album’s center—and tries to fight to the other side.","Returning with mightier riffs and wilder improvisations than ever, the trio offers a spiritual vision of metal, one well timed to a moment of crisis.

For Broken Ears EP,Tems,by: Mankaprr Conteh,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f7b371fd4d1a57aacd40caa/1:1/w_160/for%20broken%20ears%20ep_tems.jpg,2020-10-07 05:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/tems-for-broken-ears-ep/,Leading Vibe,"After barely surviving secondary school in Lagos, Nigeria, Temilade Openiyi did everything she could to avoid going to college, purposely missing enrollment deadlines for the schools her mother would submit applications to. With few friends, a stubborn depression, and an impeccable singing voice—one thick and smooth like cold butter—music felt like her only calling. Her mother, however, wasn’t having it, and sent Temilade to a university in South Africa that offered her late registration. While studying economics there in 2016, she began working on a song called “Try Me.” Freestyling at first, she sang painstakingly of a destructive love, and crafted the song’s skeleton of organs, pads, and synths after teaching herself how to produce music on YouTube. Back in Lagos, Tems tested the song at a few events, but felt pressured to put music on hold once more and take an office job. It crushed her, as office jobs are wont to do. Finally, in early 2018, she decided she would sing, even if it meant she would starve. Her first single as Tems, the moody “Mr Rebel,” earned her a small but captivated fan base that she fed a second single (“Looku Looku”) to six months later. Then, in 2019, with co-production from Nigerian artist Remy Baggins, she finally released “Try Me.” Her most successful single to date, it’s earned around 12 million plays across multiple streaming platforms, with nearly 7 million between YouTube and Spotify alone. Now, a year after “Try Me,” she injects the dynamism of the hit into her debut EP, For Broken Ears. Crafting songs that feel wholly new and deeply satisfying as the EP’s only songwriter and lead producer, she maintains the passion of her early singles but abandons the melancholy that defines them. Throughout the record, Tems contemplates her access to people, freedom, and ease, ultimately settling into her place and power in the new vanguard of Afropop.  In the weeds of her lyrics, her ideas are patchy, as if all born from freestyles, but they never feel disjointed. Her stark voice melds them together, pulling them across subtle rhythmic backdrops that feel minimal compared to her striking singing. Similarly to the output of her contemporaries in this new Afropop vanguard like Cruel Santino, Amaarae, and Odunsi (The Engine), Tems’ music expands the genre with a melange of American, African and Caribbean influences. The echo and organ on album opener “Interference” sound like Tems is singing gospel in a candlelit chapel, but her fervent flow-switching on “Ice T” and “Higher” is more rap cypher than church. Predominantly, For Broken Ears is an R&B record, with swirly synths and airy harmonies, and Tems could be mistaken for an American or British artist if not for her colorful drops of pidgin and her African intonation. At one point, Tems was uninspired by standard Afrobeats production, but here, she finds a way to incorporate it without losing her unique edge. Lead single “Damages” is an Afro-dancehall ballad. “The Key” sounds like Afrobeats meets quiet storm. Tems’ avoidance of traditional Afrobeats makes sense considering the upbeat, uptempo nature of the genre. The singer seems in touch with the darkness that shrouded her adolescence—the stress, the heartbreak, the feeling that she does not belong. She sings of these things more than the jovial pursuit of lust and love that characterizes popular Afrobeats. She starts the album with an assertion of her state of mind: “If you thought I was disturbed before, baby boy, I’m gon’ disturb you now.” Yet, in the EP’s powerful opening, she’s not crazed or vengeful, she’s conciliatory; it’s her newfound sense of serenity that may irk her adversaries. “Give me shame—I give you peace” she adds, sounding tranquil. In less than twenty minutes of music, Tems dips in and out of autonomy and captivity seamlessly. On “Free Mind,” the EP’s most compelling track, she’s pining for the very peace she finds in “Interference.” She’s steeped in a life of 5 a.m. alarms and pretending to be okay, as if written in the throes of her office job. “Set me free...Farther than eyes can handle, freer than ocean,” she bellows, her voice rich with longing. As she ends the record with “The Key,” where she proclaims, “their chains, they cannot hold me,” you believe her.","The Nigerian singer-songwriter follows up her dynamic hit “Try Me” with a stark and voluble EP that blends the warmth of R&B with contemporary Afrobeats.

Live Forever,Bartees Strange,by: Brian Josephs,Contributor ,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f7b2a5b4bab8e5825268e5d/1:1/w_160/live%20forever_bartees%20strange.jpg,2020-10-06 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/bartees-strange-live-forever/,Memory Music,"Mustang, Oklahoma is about 85 percent white and was only slightly less so a couple of decades ago, when, as a young child, Bartees Cox Jr. traveled around the state with his family, singing in operas and churches. On his debut album, Live Forever, Bartees Strange pays slight homage to his past with “Mustang,” with that feeling of needing to flee your hometown—cosmic synths, a hook yelped with scrunched eyelids, an outro that drives like a Charger on a clear highway. It’s a paradox that Bartees can’t escape whiteness in the music he creates as a Black man. It’s already part of whatever artistic turn Bartees makes, whether it’s the erasure of Black artists' contributions to indie rock, or the existential crisis Black rappers face when they must entertain largely white crowds. It’s a lot to work through on a 35-minute album, which is just a part of what makes this one of the most fascinating and affecting debuts of the year. Most of Live Forever’s magic, however, is in how it doesn't seek to explicitly subvert whiteness. Bartees is not necessarily a boundary-breaker: He presents every bit of sound he collects as a natural part of his experience. From a childhood spent bouncing from base to base as an Army brat or shying away from becoming the frontman in the bands he shuffled through as an adult, the struggle to root his voice is a running theme. Yet every influence he pulls from—TV on the Radio’s world-weary poetry, Hot 100 hip-hop cadence, industrial punk—is marked by his personable, intimate presence. “Mustang” flexes its biceps, but doesn’t lose its humanity (“Last night I got so fucked up, near lost my job/It’s nice to think that folks are near, waking up was hard this year”). For all its arena-sized gesturing, the song is really a heart-to-heart. Bartees’ introduction to the wider public was directly informed by his otherness. His breakthrough—March’s Say Goodbye to Pretty Boy, an EP of National covers—was inspired by being the only person of color at one of the band’s concerts in Washington D.C. Bartees’ interpretation of “Lemonworld”—which flips singer Matt Berninger’s sullen brokenness to a world-beating howl—speaks to the cathartic mode he sticks to for much of the album’s first half. The run is a pristine technicolor whir, where the seasick horns of “In a Cab” swing briskly into “Stone Meadows,” whose harmonic guitar interplay and bleak melodrama (“If I died in a meadow/If I died I don’t think they’d ever find me at all”) recall Silent Alarm-era Bloc Party. But the thrills mainly sprout from Bartees’ powerfully layered vocal performances. “Boomer,” centered on Bartees’ formative years after he moved from Oklahoma to Brooklyn, has your basic ’00s pop-punk formula, let-’em-say-what-they-wanna-say-because-we’re-gonna-do-us-and-it’s-time-to-dance hook included. Bartees serves us Young Thug-meets-Fall Out Boy, rapping with vocal tics that accent his small joys (“We on track, woo!/I’ve relapsed, woo!/I told my girl that I was working, that’s a lie I’m in the trap”) and express the bliss of self-actualization. The cerebral drum patterns of highlight “Flagey God” create a dewy club sweat on the hook, and Bartees rides it with a bounce that carries the ghosts of gospel and house music. He’s spoken about struggling to find cohorts who knew what to do with his Black voice. But alongside mixing engineer/bassist Brian DiMeglio and mastering engineer/emo-whisperer Will Yip, Bartees places himself at the center of nearly every element in Live Forever. Regardless of how disparate its shifts may seem, his voice is the connective force. Bartees reserves his lone screed against the compartmentalization of Black voices for “Mossblerd.” There are plenty of musicians who resist the industry gatekeepers who pigeonhole them into being a certain “type” of artist. But Bartees is specific in how this is not just an artistic frustration but something that jails you inside your own body. In a sharp piece of songwriting, he describes the way it spoils his Brooklyn paradise: “Pull up on these white folks, Park Slope abandoned/Used to hate my body, they tried to kill my spirit.” It lays bare what drives the album’s urgency: a generations-old form of strife. The idea of Black mobility—from Oklahoma to Brooklyn, from punk to folk—that threads through Live Forever never feels like it’s about escaping yourself, but about staking out an identity in unfamiliar places. The album’s final minutes begin with “Far” and “Fallen for You,” sparser, campfire-ready love songs that lean on Bartees’ falsetto at its most quavering. Then, in the final moments, Bartees feigns transcendence. Amid the ascending synths of “Ghostly,” our protagonist finds himself yearning and alone. Instead of pointing outward, the narrative circles in on itself, calling back to the existential frustration of “Mustang:” “Most folks would say that I seem fine/But each morning I don’t feel worth it/Pull up to my job almost on time.” Live Forever argues that life is not some march toward a peak, but a closed loop—one that’s tighter if you’re Black. The brilliance of Bartees’ debut is in how it carves out an expansive space within that loop. Why escape when you can create a new place entirely?","On his fascinating debut album, the D.C.-based musician moves freely through many different styles—arena-rock, folk, rap—creating an album about that freedom as a Black artist and so much more.

File Under UK Metaplasm,Rian Treanor,by: Chal Ravens,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f75a7021976ccb8ea07a004/1:1/w_160/Rian%20Treanor%20-%20File%20Under%20UK%20Metaplasm.jpg,2020-10-06 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/rian-treanor-file-under-uk-metaplasm/,Planet Mu,"In 1962, an American ad man named Martin Speckter proposed a new punctuation mark. The sublimely named “interrobang” combined question and exclamation into a single expression of quizzical incredulity: “What are those‽‽‽” This space-age innovation sadly didn’t catch on, but the spirit of the interrobang is close at hand. If you’ve ever found yourself laughing out loud in the middle of an especially audacious guitar solo, or shaking your head at the brazen WTF‽-ness of a track being mixed into a DJ set, then you’ve felt it move through you. Rotherham, England’s Rian Treanor knows how to punctuate his hyper-rave tracks with such bold-faced moments, and his second album strings dozens of them together into an astonishing suite of interrobangers. Treanor’s signature is readily apparent in all the music he has released since his first EP in 2015: pointillist impressions of the rave continuum wrought from maddening modulations, airless spaces, and nano-shards of footwork, garage, and bleep techno. Danceable yet distinctly academic, his output resembles the contemporary hypno-worlds of Don’t DJ or Barker, as well as a grand lineage of extreme computer music led by fellow Northerners like Autechre and Mark Fell (who happens to be Treanor’s dad). Over time this sound has warmed up a bit, shedding its technical outerwear and moseying towards the center of the dancefloor. On 2018’s RAVEDITS, Treanor fired Whigfield’s ’90s Eurodance smash “Saturday Night” through a splatter gun to hilarious and bruising effect; last year’s debut album, Ataxia, featuring a clutch of stuttering vocal edits, took its name from a condition that leads to uncontrolled bodily movements. Shortly after the release of RAVEDITS, Treanor traveled to Uganda to play at Nyege Nyege Festival, an offshoot of Kampala-based label Nyege Nyege Tapes. In its four years in operation, this small imprint has had an outsized effect on dancefloors at home and abroad, and the trip was by all accounts revelatory for Treanor. After the festival he spent a few weeks in the Nyege Nyege studio in Kampala, further attuning himself to the speedy vernacular of East African singeli. That influence is unignorable on the opening track of File Under UK Metaplasm, “Hypnic Jerks”—the first of many moments that come stamped with a huge, inky interrobang. What, and indeed, the fuck: A track that starts at 180BPM and still sees fit to accelerate the rubbery kicks into a quadruple-time assault? The recollections of a rappelling window cleaner forced into battle with a swarm of mbira-playing drones? A washing machine filled with rubble and Lego about to combust on its final spin? Words, words, words; the feeling would be more succinctly expressed with a single, unequivocal glyph. After passing through the molecule-separating centrifuge of “Hypnic Jerks,” the album takes many forms: tough-nut acid footwork on “Metrogazer”; strange dancehall on “Opponent Process,” his sputtering tribute to Equiknoxx; breathless grime’n’breaks on “Debouncing”; and an expedition into an abandoned power station on “Closed Curve.” Treanor’s gyroscopic pattern modulations generate curious conversational phrases, like birds mimicking robots mimicking humans. Surfaces are squeaky, atmospheres arid. The melodic and textural elements resemble the lab-coated curiosity of studio wonks like Errorsmith, Beatrice Dillon, or Gábor Lázár, whose recent albums float upward like helium airships. Underfoot, meanwhile, lurk jackhammer kicks, ricocheting percussion, and sub-bass pulsations—movements from the mind of a DJ, closely aligned with recent gabber revivalism and the binding branches of footwork and jungle. In the spirit of the interrobang, there are laugh-out-loud moments too: On “Vacuum Angle” he twists old-school hoovers into the whoosssht of a CDJ spinback, a time-travelling rave vortex that’s further confused by tabla hits and what sounds like the buzzer from oldies TV game show Catchphrase. Not pulling a screwface to this would be like scoffing a doughnut without licking your lips. Treanor’s intention is to push “functional” music to the edge, “using all those formulaic dance structures but just slightly mangled or messed up,” he has said. “I’m really interested in how far you push that before it's just like—no.” In his somatic understanding, the body is the locus of the listening act: functionally calibrated for dancing, but ready to be rendered jelly-limbed by the music’s dysfunction. He nails this on “Metaplasm,” the album’s outrageous apotheosis, a just-about-danceable maelstrom of riddim, bass, and toxic squarewaves that leaves no joint unsprained. File Under UK Metaplasm is the grand synthesis of a long investigation, a record that sounds unmistakably contemporary and, it’s not unreasonable to suggest, immediately classic.","Descended from Yorkshire’s lineage of extreme computer music, the UK producer’s astonishing second album fuses jungle, singeli, acid, dancehall, and more into audacious yet danceable hybrids.

mama’s boy,LANY,by: Ashley Bardhan,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f7b343a8f04c7f360666cae/1:1/w_160/mama's%20boy_LANY.jpg,2020-10-06 05:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/lany-mamas-boy/,Polydor,"Their obscure band name or moody group photos might convey some mystery, but “LANY” simply means “Los Angeles New York,” and frontman Paul Jason Klein is just a 32-year-old babyface whose heart was very publicly torn out by Dua Lipa. Malibu Nights, the band’s sophomore album, documented the breakup in excruciating detail, solidifying LANY as a group of attractive, sensitive boys who know their way around a synth pad. This is still true on their latest album mama’s boy, which is occasionally monotonous and—in a development only partially related to said monotony—vaguely Jesus-centric. The inclusion of contemporary Christian music conventions is half surprise and half natural extension of LANY’s asexual, boyband-adjacent appeal. If the neon cowboy on the album cover wasn’t enough to tip you off, there’s a pretty clear attempt on mama’s boy to reroute LANY from a quirky coastal band to a “traditional values”-based southern one. This version of LANY is a bit closer to the truth — the band formed in Nashville, and Klein was born and raised in Oklahoma. On some songs, he slips somewhat amusingly into a southern accent that doesn’t appear in his speaking voice. Nestled between the expected tracks about complicated love and heartache, Klein assures us that although he has a “past more stained than glass,” he still “[talks] to Jesus,” and is just a “cowboy in L.A.” Along with the hamfistedly titled, gospel choir-featuring “i still talk to jesus,” “you!” is probably the song on this album with the most explicitly contemporary Christian feel, and also acts as a case study on what makes this album so disappointingly dull. It’s just too clean—too uninventive, too insistent on generalized emotion without committing to a particular one. The guitars are crisp but lack passion, the drums are restrained, and Klein sings in anodyne, youth-group-leader metaphors: “You’re the sun to the moon/You’re my ocean painted blue,” and so on. The love songs, however, are much better, full of sugary synth lines and even a little steel guitar. “bad news” has a level of sex appeal comparable to going apple picking with your high school crush, but it still inspires very specific butterfly feelings. Klein’s voice warms and softens with his fake southern accent, lamenting that he’s not “good for you/baby, I’m bad news,” and boom—suddenly you’re you’re 16, you have pimples, and popular kid Paul Jason Klein just told you that he likes you. Such is the transformative power of emotional hot boys. As bizarre as LANY’s pivot to country pop is, they still manage to infuse it with enough charm where it doesn’t fall flat. Most exciting are the moments where Klein tweaks the image of the stereotypical southern gentleman he’s imitating. On the album, Klein is nonchalant about going to hell, and in the music video for “you!,” he’s wearing a dress with his dirty blonde hair long, holding hands with his bandmates as they walk into a blue desert night. Admittedly, as Klein is a cis white man, this image isn’t necessarily the most groundbreaking or transgressive, but like his music, it doesn’t have to be. Sometimes a little earnest mediocrity is enough.","The synth-pop group aches with boy-band sincerity over sugary arrangements and even a little pedal steel on their anodyne new album.

Giver Taker,Anjimile,by: Nina Corcoran,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f7b2d7a8cb33b384e5503c2/1:1/w_160/giver%20taker_anjimile.jpg,2020-10-06 05:00:00,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/anjimile-giver-taker/,Father/Daughter,"Boston-based singer-songwriter Anjimile Chithambo’s life changed when they realized they could rebuild themself. Born in a Dallas suburb to conservative, Presbyterian immigrants from Malawi, the 27-year-old indie-folk artist, who records mononymously as Anjimile, spent the past decade whittling away at music as a hobby-turned-coping method. The experience of coming out to their parents as queer eventually inspired “Maker,” a song that compares a redefinition of gender to one of faith—and paved the way for Giver Taker, their first album on Father/Daughter. Written during the throes of a personal decline and recorded after reaching safety on the other side, Giver Taker recounts a difficult climb to sobriety, the loss of loved ones, and the gradual understanding of their identity as a nonbinary trans person. It’s not the struggles that define the album, but rather the joy and resilience that permeates it. A grant from a local arts group gave Anjimile the budget to create Giver Taker the way they envisioned: by hiring longtime bandmate Justine Bowe of synthpop group Photocomfort and New York-based artist and producer Gabe Goodman. Together, Bowe and Goodman add layered depth to Anjimile’s compositions: Sunlight peeks through piano chords on the title track, strings and bass clarinet shimmer throughout “In Your Eyes,” and vocal harmonies enliven “Baby No More.” Childhood favorites like Madonna and Zimbabwean musician Oliver Mtukudzi surface in Anjimile’s pop refrains and African polyrhythms, while their teenage appreciation for Iron & Wine influences their approach to finger-picked guitar. Though the album was primarily written while in rehab and experiencing a quiet identity crisis, Giver Taker proceeds with the radiant happiness and pride that come with securing a sense of stability in life. Even when they quote Shakespeare in the heartfelt ballad “Ndimakukonda” (the title means “I love you” in Chichewa, their parents’ native language), Anjimile emphasizes gratitude by reworking the love song to address friends instead of an ex-partner. It’s hard not to compare Anjimile to a young Sufjan Stevens, both because of their warbling vocal deliveries and their ambiguously religious lyrics. While the songs on Giver Taker center around life experiences with family, grief, and love, a thread of faith weaves through each: the calls for help in “Not Another Word,” the stubborn refusal of death in “Your Tree,” the reckoning with hereditary traits in “1978.” Like Sufjan, Anjimile subverts the platitudes of Christian music by softly treading along the metaphoric ridge where spirituality adjoins hope. “I’ll walk the line to meet you there,” they promise at the album’s end, singing just above a whisper. Tucked throughout are soft piano, stirring banjo, and frail falsettos—the result of Anjimile’s first year taking testosterone—that recall the holistic intimacy of albums like Michigan and Seven Swans. Though they’ve released several records over the past six years, Anjimile has declared Giver Taker to be their debut full-length. It’s a choice that reflects their significant growth in style and sound: Whereas their earlier material veered towards melodic art-rock, the music on Giver Taker sounds radically gentle and confident, as if made by someone who’s experienced a rebirth. Even the stripped-back reworkings of songs from 2018’s Colors and 2019’s Maker Mixtape feel revitalized. It’s most evident in “Maker,” a song that unfolds like a mantra of self-actualization: “I’m not just a boy, I’m a man/I’m not just a man, I’m a god/I’m not just a god, I’m a maker.” A transcendental evolution from gender identity to spiritual calling and, finally, to creative purpose, it’s the centerpiece of Giver Taker, the album where Anjimile takes pride in their voice and the person they’ve become.","Though written during the throes of identity crisis and recovery, the official debut from Boston-based indie-folk artist Anjimile Chithambo radiates the happiness and pride that come with stability.

Róisín Machine,Róisín Murphy,by: Jesse Dorris,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f7201753d8019e558786bfd/1:1/w_160/Ro%CC%81isi%CC%81n%20Machine_Ro%CC%81isi%CC%81n%20murphy.jpg,2020-10-05 05:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/roisin-murphy-roisin-machine/,SkintBMG,"Over the course of the last 30 years, Róisín Murphy has made enough classics to fill up the Top 40 of a more fabulous world. To paraphrase the one-time announcer of this awful world’s pop countdown, Murphy has kept her couture-shod feet on the ground and kept reaching for the stars—though her idea of a star is more Cosey Fanni Tutti dancing to Sylvester than your average pop idol. The Irish singer-songwriter’s fifth solo album, Róisín Machine, might seem in some ways like the same old song and dance. But it’s done with such impeccable elan that she has turned the old nightlife songbook into a book of revelations. In Moloko, Murphy’s turn-of-the-century duo of bedroom fiddlers who ended up filling arenas, Murphy distilled awkward hedonism into intoxicants like “Sing It Back” and “Forever More.” Her subsequent solo albums, brilliant as they often were, sometimes felt more like mere representations of charisma, or deployments of charm, than, say, a confession on a dancefloor or finding love in a hopeless place or something you can’t get out of your head. In proper dance-music style, her best tracks often existed only on 12""s, like her 2014 collaboration with Freeform Five, “Leviathan,” a fierce and forthright anthem which should be played instead whenever someone requests “Titanium.” Or the series she made with boompty savant Maurice Fulton, which often sounded like house classics overheard while trapped in an adjacent rubber room. Machine fills out a recent clutch of 12""s with new tracks, all made with Sheffield legend Parrot, whose work as Sweet Exorcist (with Cabaret Voltaire’s Richard H. Kirk) helped form the character of early Warp records. Here, he raises the electro-industrial psychedelia of Throbbing Gristle and the deeply considered thump of Larrys Levan and Heard into impeccable feats of sonic engineering that wisely never dare to upstage the star of the show. After a brief prologue to set the stakes—“I will make my own happy ending,” she announces over an opening curtain of strings—the album moves psychogeographically through various dance terrains. It begins, with “Simulation,” at the beginning: the breath (layers of Murphy’s exhalations, pluming like a fog machine) and the beat. (For club kids, a heartbeat isn’t a double thump, it’s a kick and a hi-hat.) “This is a simulation,” she lilts. “This is a lonely illusion/This is my only delusion.” Disco, invented by people whose existence was uncertain, was a way to turn fantasy into fact. Here, Murphy is part Oscar Wilde, praising the artificial as a mask that tells the truth, and part Willy Wonka, all conflicted beckoning. Part riot grrrl, too: “If it’s all on my veins/It’s all in my mind/You don’t get to be unkind!” she declares, like a clarion cry of “Girls to the front!” The dancefloor is a body, Murphy’s own, and she’s too busy blissing to entertain male notions of authenticity, or the dangers their egos might engender. “Simulation” ends with one of the album’s great builds, which on a good pair of headphones sounds like liftoff and on a behemoth of a soundsystem—at, let’s say, a busy moment of a particularly adult’s-only corner of a queer dancefloor—feels like poppers. Murphy has talked about sequencing Machine as a kind of DJ mix; a traditional one would take off even further from here. Perversely, “Kingdom of Ends” follows, a beatless heater with stacked funk-operatic vocals calling back to The ArchAndroid and P-Funk before it. The chants amass above an ooze of trance, putting to shame the thousands of so-called “deconstructed club” blobs currently clogging up Bandcamp. “This is easier than I expected,” Murphy sneers. Only then, with an absolute stormer of a disco strut called “Something More,” is the Machine up and running at full steam. “Maybe this could be the last time I feel the strain/Of what it’s like to own everyone and everything/Life just keeps me wanting,” she announces, as if reading out loud, for the first time, a diagnosis of her own condition. The song is a masterclass of ambivalence, with a yearning bridge that settles into the chorus, once aching and now resigned. The baggy “We Got Together” ricochets Murphy’s hoots and hollers across booming fields, a simple celebration of how tough it can be to maintain a connection. With “Game Changer,” she loosens her grip. It’s a humid pulse, that moment in a DJ set designed for a quick trip to the bar. This is Roísín Murphy, though, so it’s not that easy. The track is somehow in freefall and motionless. Her voice flashes through the air like tableaus caught in mid-strobe: “I thought I knew the way…”; “This is about to get realer….” Words smear. Just as with a slightly inappropriate outfit, or a too-intimate (or intoxicated) conversation, what holds it all together is wit. “Incapable” is brittle, its Eurodisco rhythm sharpened into snaps and claps. Murphy unloads a history of emotional distance. She knows all about that warm Moroder/Summer swoon: “I get that there’s a sensation/Though I don’t know what it means.” She can’t feel love. “I should try and play my part,” she reproves herself, but alas, all she’s ever felt is a feverish chill. And this is what it sounds like, percussion prickling like goosebumps, when your damage hardens into a visage. She falls through a trapdoor into full disco fever. “Narcissus” marries Greek myth and a dance beat better than Xanadu ever did: Its pools of rippling strings evaporate into prance music for chatterbox Echo and selfie-obsessed Narcissus, characters familiar to anyone who’s ever waited in line for a nightclub powder room. Disco fuels another gem: “Murphy’s Law,” a shimmering ode to a lack of self-control that she sings in a register as deep as the groove. The song is not a cover of Cheri’s insouciant 1982 boogie standard of the same name, and it is also not “Bad Girls,” though it definitely shares some DNA, but it is as good as either of them. The nerve! And one more: “Jealousy,” shorn of more than half its original 12"" length, starts in thrall to that destructive emotion and stays there. “Jealousy!” she chants, as if demanding her own humanity, while the track surmounts a second great buildup, bookending “Simulation” as if to say the real drama is always human. After all the triumphs and tragedies of trying to connect to herself and other people in the dark, she finds a role she was born to play: succinct dancefloor truth-teller, a character smart enough to see the worst about herself and clever enough to make it irresistible. Róisín Murphy aims her tracks at the stars. With Róisín Machine, she’s become one.","On her fifth solo album, the Irish singer finds a new role as a dancefloor truth-teller, infusing house and disco epics with thrilling expressions of desire, regret, and self-knowledge.

Agüita,Gabriel Garzón-Montano,by: Matthew Ismael Ruiz,"Associate Staff Writer, News",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f720d1a295f7fb02b7264c4/1:1/w_160/Agu%CC%88ita_Gabriel%20Garzo%CC%81n-Montano.jpg,2020-10-05 05:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/gabriel-garzon-montano-aguita/,Jagjaguwar,"Some electronic musicians use a handful of aliases, recognizing that their fans—and the industry at large—can have difficulty reconciling new sounds coming from familiar names. Jazz artists form fresh ensembles to explore different lanes. Punks start new bands. None of those options seem to suit Gabriel Garzón-Montano. Instead he’s populated his latest album, Agüita, with three characters, each a different facet of a three-dimensional self-portrait that examines the origins of his sense of self. The son of a Colombian father and French mother, born and raised in Brooklyn, he’s at once of Europe and Latin America, of New York and the United States. The first two characters, the “wistful impressionist” rooted in European theatre and fashion and the “leading man” studied in American soul and R&B, will be familiar to those who’ve heard his first two records, the 2014 EP Bishouné: Alma del Huila and the 2017 LP Jardín. But the third, an “urbano hitmaker” with the contemporary swagger of a reggaetonero, is something new, an illuminating view into how GGM constructs his own id. Debuted in a stunning medley for the Colors video performance series, the character feels like connective tissue between the others, slithering across the sexual spectrum as he tries on urbano’s egocentric hypermasculinity, minus the misogyny. These are also his first songs in Spanish; the challenge of writing in another language is amplified by the fact that he’s not just singing, but rapping, and the flow en español comes with its own unique challenges of diction and cadence. His fractured sense of self serves him well here, as he uses second-generation Spanglish to connect troublesome bars. Still, it doesn’t always work. The “look like a book/stack like books” line on “Mira My Look” reaches Travis Scott levels of goofy. But the experimentation is admirable, even if the transition from romance to raunch can feel awkward at times, like when the “soaking wet” metaphor in “Agüita” manifests as a literal firehose in the video. From a production standpoint, the new direction is promising. For the Sly & Robbie-sampling “Muñeca,” Garzón-Montano studied plugins and compression techniques in an attempt to match the frequencies of J Balvin’s “Reggaeton,” itself an homage to OGs Tego Calderón and Daddy Yankee; the result is a thumping bassline in lockstep with the classic riddim’s drums and a horn melody that’s somehow both blaring and subdued. The most successful contemporary reggaetón finds ways to breathe new life into the classic riddim, but reverse-engineering the formula is a good start. The rest of Agüita feels more in line with the aesthetic Garzón-Montano has spent much of the past decade crafting. A multi-instrumentalist with an ear for sound design, his aesthetic is that of a deviant with a touch of sweetness, like a freak in the sheets who still sends your mom flowers on her birthday. His analog instruments have distinct textures, from dampened drums to willowy strings and carefully placed negative space. They complement the album’s most tender moments, like the despair of his mother’s passing on “Moonless,” or the juxtaposition of his cracking voice and the gorgeous, meticulously arranged strings on “Fields.” And “Someone,” with its depiction of a one-sided tryst, pairs sexual generosity and emotional vulnerability in a way not often seen from a “leading man.” Separately, the songs on Agüita don’t seem to fit together. But Garzón-Montano’s touch as a producer is deft, and his masterful track sequencing produces fluidity. It’s how a song like “Bloom,” a sparse, lyric-driven track in which he toys with homonyms at the beginning and ending of each verse, can precede the swinging-dick vibes of “Agüita.” He likes to refer to the album as “anti-genre,” but really, the genre is Garzón-Montano. Even as he reaches for disparate sources of influence, his gaze is still directed inward, his songs an examination of the various elements of his own artistic identity. The album credits, which feature guest vocals from Nick Hakim (“With a Smile”), Ana Tijoux (“Muñeca”), and a coterie of guest musicians, are evidence of frequent collaborations. But much of the production was solitary, and Garzón-Montano’s vocal tracks were recorded in near isolation on the family farm in the foothills of the Andes, deep in Colombian coffee country. At a glance, Garzón-Montano’s work would seem incompatible with the hyperspeed of the contemporary music industry and its constricting metrics of success. His embrace of Colombia’s language ironically pushes him further to the margins; though Agüita’s reggaetón songs warrant inclusion on the Latin charts, the album doesn’t have enough Spanish lyrics to qualify for Latin Grammys. Yet with each release, it’s clear he is wholly unconcerned with playing that game. Instead, his music radiates self-reflection—each song carefully considered and delivered with intention.","Spanning tender acoustic ballads, silky R&B performance, and contemporary urbano swagger, the singer-songwriter and multi-instrumentalist’s second LP unites the facets of his own artistic identity.

True Romantic,Ziemba,by: Cat Zhang,Executive Editorial Assistant,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f7625bdfa467b41aa983933/1:1/w_160/True%20Romantic_ziemba.jpg,2020-10-05 05:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/ziemba-true-romantic/,Sister Polygon,"While writing his gorgeous defense of gay marriage in the 2012 the Obergefell v. Hodges decision, Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy might have gotten too lost in rhapsodic praise. Without marriage, he proclaimed, same-sex pairs would be “condemned to live in loneliness”; the age-old institution wards off a “universal fear” that you might cry out for company and find no one there. Despite the radical intimacies of spinsters and communal families, those who opt out of legally recognized coupledom are presumed incomplete. Century after century, the ideal of the monogamous pair looms over our cultural imagination: The ancient Greeks believed that Zeus split humans into two, dooming them to roam eternally in search of their other half. The feeling of love may be transcendent, yet our concept of it seems conservative and timid under scrutiny. Still, there’s something shamefully seductive about the illusion of a singular love—the soft-focus pining and windblown mystery, the bliss of collapsing yourself into someone else. Even its most syrupy manifestations lodge themselves in our memory. In Céline Dion’s breathless “The Power of Love” video, love looks like lounging in bed or smizing in a ridiculously comfy sweater—and who doesn’t want that? On True Romantic, the performance artist, musician, and perfumer René Kladzyk, aka Ziemba, considers how stale archetypes of romance have seeped into her psyche. But the pleasure of big feelings proves irresistible. “I must be a true romantic (or a fool!),” she exclaims on the title track, a song so buoyant and rejuvenated that she might’ve recorded it upon exiting the spa. True Romantic is as gauzy and enveloping as a fragrance ad. “Feelings Are Real” conjures the chiming, soporific dreamscapes of Enya, like what you’d hear after drinking a potion in an enchanted forest. Ziemba intones the song’s three lines like a spell. From there, she leaps into the sunset heaven of “You Feel Like Paradise,” a moony, glam-rock-inspired song about taking flight into someone else. “Just take a step out of time,” she urges her paramour, advice that doubles as a meta-commentary on her retro sound and grand declarations. In the digital era, we are all semioticians, scrupulously aware of how minor shifts in punctuation can tip speech towards new meanings. Ziemba bypasses all this interpretation, intent on plastering her feelings on billboards. “I will love you until the end of time,” she belts on “Power of Love,” an obvious homage to Dion. True Romantic is simultaneously a reminder of the allure and the ridiculousness of popular romance. Watch enough power-ballad music videos, and at some point, you’ll hit your capacity for candlelight, linen sheets, and fan-blown hair. Ziemba leans into the absurdity. “Mama” flirts with an archetype one might call “Woman Somberly Playing Solo Piano,” in which musical theatre types like Sara Bareilles confide their most tender feelings while gliding through simple chord progressions. Gaudy wind chimes flutter in the opening, then a pan flute beams in. Oh, come on, you groan delightedly. “Bad Love” poaches twee metaphors from Christmas classics: “A fish can love a turtledove,” Ziemba croons as strings swell in the background. The twirling, 1950s-style pop song could slot into the closing credits of a Meg Ryan comedy. Midway through her version of Ary Barroso’s “Brazil” comes a saxophone passage so cheesy that it could soundtrack a Tommy Wiseau sex scene. “I regard romantic comedies as a subgenre of sci-fi,” the actress and comedy writer Mindy Kaling once wrote—a world where the governing principles are as foreign as any alien planet’s. Despite Ziemba’s stated intention to process this romantic conditioning, True Romantic is more inclined to frolic in Disney tropes than to prod at their underlying ideology. The most apparent attempt to deflate love’s mythology is found at the outset: “If I’m Being Honest” nods to the destructiveness of constantly chasing beginnings, as well as the irrationality of projecting your hopes onto someone you’ve barely met. Elsewhere, the lyrics devolve into sensory mumbo jumbo: “The word chrysanthemum so warm inside/Suffering sounds divorce voluptuous delight,” Ziemba sings on “Casket and Cradle,” which recalls the sunny pop of the Carpenters. Without more trenchant, sarcastic observations to undercut its dreamy vintage sound, True Romantic can’t offer a truly contemporary spin on romance. The album’s nostalgia and tenderness are enchanting. But floaty, heternormative ideas of love have consequences beyond personal disappointment.","The El Paso, Texas-based performance artist and musician stages an exploration of popular romance with an album that’s as gauzy and enveloping as a fragrance ad.

Free Humans,Hen Ogledd,by: Jazz Monroe,Associate Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f761ea63e0f344a0ad58ee7/1:1/w_160/free%20humans_hen%20ogledd.jpg,2020-10-05 05:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/hen-ogledd-free-humans/,Weird WorldDomino,"In one sense, Hen Ogledd’s third album is just what you’d expect from a low-key clan of indie-pop darlings: It has shabby guitars, crafty hooks, and sing-songy campfire melodies, all warmly interwoven like a winter cardigan. Should you wish, you could listen to Free Humans on those terms alone, filing it among the dainty troves of labels like K Records. But in another sense—the one in which Free Humans is not only a catalog of heartbreak and minutiae, but also a sci-fi odyssey warning of political isolationism and climate apocalypse—it starts to feel quite unorthodox. Hidden in its lullabies are bouts of galactic anxiety and wry jabs at spacejet-setting one-percenters. A song called “Space Golf” berates the elites as they blast off to gentrify Jupiter; “Time Party” rallies us to “Bomb the banks! Shrink the economy!” Free Humans makes a pitch to those unsure whether to fret over civilizational decline or their own minor burdens, and the advice is emphatic: Why not both! The record’s multitudes should surprise nobody familiar with the ever unpredictable Richard Dawson. Before Hen Ogledd, the Newcastle bard was known for mythic solo masterworks that his devotees could chew over for years. By contrast, the band he assembled with outré harpist Rhodri Davies, multi-instrumentalist Sally Pilkington, and art curator Dawn Bothwell has now released two bite-size albums in as many years, while Dawson’s homegrown project with Pilkington, Bulbis, spawned some 49 ambient and kosmische EPs in lockdown. Despite sometimes having the air of a kitschy sideshow, Hen Ogledd is now its own thriving community: Each member illustrates some corner of Free Humans’ doomed dystopia before passing along the mic, like class nerds presenting a meticulous school project. The loose end-of-days theme gives rise to interstellar dance soirees (“Time Party”), ancient rumblings of extinction (“Feral”), and—in an improbably romantic finale of pumping drum machines and prog-folk fireworks—a mass exodus into a “very big ball of light” (“Skinny Dippers”). Nothing about this silly-serious concept is as wonderful as the band’s delight in it. Take a simple couplet from “Space Golf,” which envisages the lives of the rich after they steal away from Earth for good: “Infinity pool on Ganymede/You took so much more than you need.” You can practically see the lightbulb flashing as that ludicrous rhyme pops into Pilkington’s head, presumably while she peruses a list of Jupiter’s moons. Likewise, from “Crimson Star”: Those were the best days of my life
I was a singer in a band
Aboard the first of the big cruise ships
Touring the seven planets and their moons
Circling TRAPPIST-1 This is Dawson leaning precariously into his Douglas Adams caper, synths swooping beneath him like a magic carpet. As with much else here, it’s a perilous leap of faith performed in a tone of utter humility, in this case while channelling the textures and emotional beats of lavish ’80s sophistipop. The band’s kids-in-a-candy-store approach to modulators and electronics leads to some questionable indulgence (the gear credits read like components of a Flaming Lips song-title generator: Bassman, Orbit, the Depths, Bubbletron, Randy’s Revenge...), but in good twee-pop fashion, the unit shambles along with a camaraderie that brings us in on the antics. Songs like “Farewell” are the backbone, crammed with dense and rousing songcraft; other highlights, such as “Bwganod” and “Skinny Dippers,” are more like gas giants, vast and nebulous enough for funk, offbeat synthpop, and sweary Scotch poetry to swarm around their rocky core. For all its knotty themes and interludes, Free Humans is guided by a childlike innocence: the betrayal of a planet condemned and abandoned by its rich, and the unexpected relief of its liberation. Our intuition of a climate catastrophe has fuelled many such visions of a beautiful apocalypse, as the culture writer Al Horner notes; they can manifest in everything from stories of post-pandemic biodiversity to verdant video games like The Last of Us. It’s easy to see why these apocalyptic fantasies might appeal to an anarchic bunch like Hen Ogledd (not least Dawson, who loves both gaming and UFO conspiracies), but at its heart, Free Humans is a passionate rebuke to both fatalism and futurism. It’s the sound of four cosmic souls resolutely staying put—not wanderers but wonderers, still in love with their own bizarre planet, and baffled by the senselessness of leaving it behind.","The Newcastle band’s oddball indie pop makes a pitch to those unsure whether to fret over civilizational decline or their own minor burdens: Why not both!

Irons in the Fire,Teena Marie,by: Eric Torres,Editorial Producer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f75e6a5c37693e19746e73a/1:1/w_160/irons%20in%20the%20fire_teena%20marie.jpg,2020-10-04 05:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/teena-marie-irons-in-the-fire/,Gordy,"The year is 1980, and Teena Marie is breaking a sweat on national television. It’s the singer’s second appearance on Soul Train, and she’s well-versed in the show’s electric, stylish theater, wearing a belted yellow turtleneck and high-waisted bell-bottoms. A corona of curly hair bounces along as she gyrates across the stage, performing the slinky R&B hit “I Need Your Lovin’,” the opening track from that year’s Irons in the Fire. She resembles an infinitely cooler version of Jennifer Grey in Dirty Dancing: Marie is always on the move, two-stepping across the stage between verses before hitting the sustained, sky-high note at song’s end with the gusto of an opera queen. When she bounces over to chat with Don Cornelius afterward, he chuckles, obviously impressed. “You tired?” “No,” she answers. “Want me to do it again?” That performance—plus the next “nine, ten, eleven” times she appeared on Soul Train over the course of her career, as she remembered it—is testament to many facts about Teena Marie: her tireless brio onstage; her robust and layered vocal talents; her infectious, easygoing personality. Marie’s music was steeped in the gospel, R&B, and soul traditions she heard growing up in “Venice Harlem,” a melting-pot, working-class neighborhood in west Los Angeles. It was a street cred she carried through her entire life, even name-checking the locale by name on the title track to Irons in the Fire. By the time she made the album, her third, and the first over which she had full creative control, the singer had secured a rarified place that no white entertainer in R&B had ever reached, before or since. “My skin is white, but I’m not looked at like that,” she said in a posthumous 2012 documentary on her life. “I’m a Black entertainer, and I always have been.” Before all of the success that led to Soul Train, however, Teena Marie was simply Mary Christine Brockert. At 8, she began singing in church and at local functions, growing up with parents who played jazz staples like Frank Sinatra and Sarah Vaughan at home. They encouraged her hobby early on, and as a youth in Venice her love for soul and R&B ran deep. She would haul her battery-powered turntable and Smokey Robinson 45s outside to play and sing along while she and her friends ran track, earning her the nickname Lil’ Smokey for how closely she could mimic the timbre of his voice. Marie knew even then that she wanted to write love songs modeled after her favorites from Smokey, the Dells, and Al Green, whose lush, heartbroken “Tired of Being Alone” stopped her in her tracks as a sophomore in high school. You can hear the seeds of Marie’s swooning music in Green’s vocals especially, the way he holds his breath for a beat before letting loose a maelstrom of emotion. Marie attended Santa Monica College and wrote music on the side with friends, eventually landing her first break with Motown, which had expanded from Detroit to Hollywood. Despite earning Berry Gordy's approval, she worked with an assortment of songwriters over nearly three years with no luck. While rehearsing at the label’s L.A. studio one day, Marie finally got the right person’s attention: Rick James, fresh off 1978’s Come Get It!, his debut Top-10 R&B album that would launch his outrageous, sequin-studded “Super Freak” era. The funk-rock svengali took an instant shine to Marie. “I expected to see a writer-producer,"" James told People years later. “And instead I found this short, tiny white body sitting at the piano, singing like the gods had come into her spirit.” Marie wasn’t Motown’s only white artist, but she was the first at the label to write music that was undeniably made for Black listeners, especially once James stepped in. He produced her debut, 1979’s Wild & Peaceful, a set of silky R&B punctuated with James’ signature horns and percussive guitars. The album art featured a drippy, pastel painting of the sea, a marketing bet by Motown brass to mask Marie’s race that paid off: the album netted her first top-ten R&B hit, the buoyant, call-and-response James duet “I’m a Sucker for Your Love.” On Lady T, her follow-up a year later, Richard Rudolph stepped in on production duty. Marie dedicated it to Rudolph’s late wife Minnie Riperton, one of her idols, and the album resembles some of Riperton’s most nimble music as driven by a disco polish and Marie’s vibrant enthusiasm. Released on Valentine’s Day 1980 and emblazoned with regal cover art that put Marie’s face front and center, Lady T was the first time many people had seen the woman behind the music. “I tell them I’m white but they think I’m Black and I’m trying to pass for white,” she said in an interview that year. “This is white skin. I’m not trying to fool anybody.” Lady T’s swinging glamor set the stage for the passionate Irons in the Fire, recorded immediately afterward and released within the year. Having closely studied both James and Rudolph at work, Marie was now prepared to take total control over hiring, arrangements, and production, with the full support of Gordy and Motown label head Hal Davis behind her (“Mr. Gordy just gave me a shot at producing and turned me loose,” she said). She recruited fellow Motown groups Ozone and Rick James’ Stone City Band to provide the rhythm and horn section, allowing for her sturdy, bottom-heavy arrangements to flourish. Marie played keyboards and recorded most of the album’s backing vocals herself. “Being a woman or being a young woman doesn’t matter if you can do the job,” she told The Los Angeles Times around the album’s release, her confidence on full, fabulous display. “People ask me, ‘How do you handle men in the studio and tell them what to do?’ That’s not a problem. Being in charge is natural for me and I do it well.” The proof is spread all across the album. Irons in the Fire is an exercise in sleek early-’80s excess, but it feels completely natural in Marie’s hands. The album’s come-ons and recriminations are bound in synthy R&B songs (“First Class Love”) that sit comfortably beside straight jazz standards (“Tune in Tomorrow”). On the irrepressible “I Need Your Lovin’,” small details come together like a tapestry: the rubbery bassline guides Marie’s ascending backing vocals, which melt into a robust, double-tracked chorus as Ray Woodard’s saxophone flit in and out for solos. The effusive “whoo!” that opens the song became something like her equivalent of a producer tag, reoccurring most famously on her successful 1981 rap single “Square Biz.” Every bespoke choice turns Irons in the Fire into a decadent listening experience, but the smoldering title track, with plucked harp and gentle percussion, is Marie’s most moving performance. Where “I Need Your Lovin’” and the bounding “You Make Love Like Springtime” rely on over-the-top exuberance, here she sounds utterly relaxed, tearing through high vocal runs and then back down with olympic agility. The song presages some of her stormier ballads and collaborations, especially “Fire & Desire,” her 1981 Rick James duet that stands as one of the most heart-rending, soulful collaborations of all time. Irons in the Fire was Marie’s first record to break into the R&B Top 10, which is inextricable from her involvement with every aspect of the record. Her production and songwriting prowess has been instructive for generations of musicians Marie has influenced over the years: Faith Evans, who collaborated with Marie on her 2009 album Congo Square, recalled admiring seeing her name listed as a producer and writer in the liner notes when she would look through her mother’s LPs as a child. Marie’s reach extended to hip-hop, too: Missy Elliott adopted Marie’s “Square Biz” flow for her guest feature on Ciara’s “1,2 Step,” and the Fugees sampled 1988’s “Ooo La La La” for The Score’s “Fu-Gee-La,” the group’s highest-selling single. Mary J. Blige, another powerhouse of R&B, cites her as a formative influence constantly. “It bugs me out that only 1 out of 20 people knows about Teena Marie,” she protested to Entertainment Weekly in 2004. After one more album for Motown, 1981’s It Must Be Magic, Marie split from the label, disclosing that they were holding her to her contract while simultaneously withholding her from releasing music. When she signed with Epic, Motown sued, so her legal team countersued citing a state law that required record companies to pay their artists a $6,000 minimum per year. She won the case, resulting in a legal statute that gave artists more power when negotiating contracts with labels known as “the Brockert Initiative.” Artists like Luther Vandross and Mary Jane Girls cited the statute to get out of their contracts afterward; by standing up for herself, Marie had changed the entire landscape for recording artists going forward. Marie’s career places a singular emphasis on authenticity that fortified her both personally and with audiences. She earned respect because of her pure dedication and respect for the craft, which simply can’t be faked. Irons in the Fire captured the singer at a moment that still feels rare and unprecedented today: a woman in her early 20s taking full control in the studio to establish her personal vision of soul and R&B music. “I think people have embraced me because they really can feel that I’m real,” she said in an interview in 2004. “And that I’m who I am and I play the music that I love.” Get the Sunday Review in your inbox every weekend.

Sign o’ the Times (Super Deluxe),Prince,by: Brad Nelson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f7b3f5f9c825546d1cea488/1:1/w_160/SOTT_DLXCover-FINAL.jpg,2020-10-03 05:05:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/sign-o-the-times-super-deluxe/,Warner,"Sign o’ the Times is probably the most complete exhibition of Prince’s talent. Almost every style he’d attempted up to that point in his career is presented in its most clarified and uninhibited form. It’s also one of the leanest-seeming double albums of all time—not a note across its four sides registers as indulgent or out of place. But the very notion of “place” is a complicated one on Prince’s masterwork; the sessions that produced the record lasted over a full year and were intended for multiple unrealized projects and albums. The songs themselves sometimes hail from even further back in time, closer to the beginnings of Prince’s career, when he was still exploring the slender shadow-space between funk and new wave. Which is why it might be helpful to think of the original 1987 release of Sign o’ the Times as more of a network than an album—a small reservoir of music filled from many disparate sources. No wonder listening to it has always sort of felt like walking through the rooms of a house inside of Prince’s dream. And with the release of the new eight-disc, Super Deluxe edition of Sign o’ the Times, one can finally zoom out and glimpse the totality of its scale. Entire new floors and wings have been unlocked in the structure, revealing songs removed from the album’s original sequence, as well as tracks he intended for his forebears Joni Mitchell and Miles Davis, free-flowing studio jams, and the tentative beginnings of a stage musical about roving gangs of musicians. It’s an overwhelming amount of material. (There’s even a song called “Love and Sex” on the new set that’s completely distinct from the other Prince song called “Love and Sex” on the 2017 Purple Rain reissue.) Throughout 1986 and leading up to the release of Sign o’ the Times, concepts bloomed in Prince’s vision, only to shrink away when his attention drifted elsewhere. This didn’t mean he was unfocused. His burgeoning creative relationship with Revolution bandmates Wendy Melvoin and Lisa Coleman produced complete gardens of songs, such that he could hardly keep them confined to one album; he sequenced both single and double-LP versions of a project called Dream Factory, a living archive of all the songs they made together that didn’t work on more focused album projects like the just-released Parade. The Dream Factory songs unearthed from the vault are staggering. Wendy and Lisa added such lightness and complexity to Prince’s music, they made the ground disappear beneath its heels. “All of My Dreams” exemplifies this; from its first choral blossomings to its sophistipop chorus to Prince’s pitched-down vocal moving through the song like a lowered cloud; we hear him recount a sex dream where, for the umpteenth time in his work, the sensual grows indistinguishable from the surreal. It’s the platonic ideal of a lost Revolution track, a beguiling long-form experiment that is also undeniably pop, the strange, unbound invention of three true genre agnostics. Also slated for Dream Factory was “The Ballad of Dorothy Parker,” the first song Prince recorded in his freshly-built home studio just a few hours after waking from a dream. A flaw in the installation of the studio console made the drum machine sound watery and distant, like a thumping beneath the hull of a ship, and the synths echoed like they were being bounced off sheet metal. Engineer Susan Rogers panicked, but Prince continued recording, impatient to get the idea down. The song ended up sounding half-asleep as he was, a trip through the unconscious world before waking. After finishing it, he asked one of the horn players in his band, Eric Leeds, to paste a horn arrangement on top of it. So many of Sign o’ the Times pleasures lie in Prince’s incorporation of horns—they blink like new sequins in the fabric of his music—but it’s mostly uncanny to hear the blear of “Dorothy Parker” suddenly studded with in-focus saxophone harmonies. “Power Fantastic,” recorded live with the Revolution playing in Prince’s house, opens with Prince giving studio direction to the rest of the band from the control room. He’s in a relaxed, dreamy-sounding mood. “Just trip,” he says, “There are no mistakes this track. This is the fun track.” The instruments drift into each other in slow motion, gradually building to a free interplay between horns and piano and brushed drums that’s like waves crashing and foaming on rocks, before receding back into silence. Out of that quiet, Lisa plays the melancholy piano figure that begins the real song, the bones of which she wrote with Wendy, and Prince starts singing his vocal from the corner of the control room, only pausing to guide the band through the changes by saying “bridge” or “chorus,” the musicians pouring into each new part like water. It’s a gorgeous document of the chemistry the Revolution had at their peak, even as they were beginning to fall apart. “Strange Relationship,” among Prince’s cruelest songs, had been around since 1983, but he decided to rework it with Wendy and Lisa for inclusion in Dream Factory. Their contributions to the original performance make it almost psychedelically deep. Sampled sitar buzzes swirl around the groove and make its borders fuzzier; Wendy and Lisa’s voices appear like hazy auras around Prince’s, which sounds wounded and grave, seemingly adrift between the song’s vectors of resentment and desire. When he sings “Baby I just can’t stand to see you happy/but more than that I hate to see you sad,” he sounds genuinely tortured about it. It makes for a more desperate and sad song than what appeared on the record; when Prince fired Wendy and Lisa from his band, he scrubbed most of their presence from the recording, and re-recorded his vocal, presumably so it would match the new lightness of the instrumentation. With Wendy and Lisa gone, and the Revolution and Dream Factory both functionally over, Prince, tired of his own voice, fed it into a sampler and adjusted its pitch until it twisted itself into a high, androgynous peal. He named the voice Camille, credited his vocals to her, and planned to release a new solo album of pitch-shifted funk jams under the name. It was the apotheosis of all the gender play he’d worked into his visual appearance and his ambiguous and boundless sexuality on record, except Prince had erased himself from the picture: All that was left was the voice, this unknowable shriek exploding through the speaker. Originally designated as the opener for the Camille album, it’s remarkable to hear “Rebirth of the Flesh” in good quality (one of the distinct pleasures of these vault excavations is no longer having to decipher some of these songs through blown-out distortion or puddles of tape hiss). It’s like a lost statement of purpose for Sign o’ the Times, and it makes sense why Prince, after abandoning the Camille project, would retain it as the opening track for a triple-album concept that absorbed both Camille and Dream Factory into it, the different concepts now consuming each other like successively bigger fish. He called this new configuration Crystal Ball, and it contained almost every song that would end up on Sign O’ The Times, plus a few others. What’s frustrating is that it’s impossible to rebuild Crystal Ball or Dream Factory just from the materials included in this box set. This is partly owed to the fact that Prince released several Crystal Ball songs when he was alive, on the confusingly-titled archival release, 1998’s Crystal Ball. But the segues and edits Prince had planned for each record are presumably still unavailable, and the albums themselves remain inaudible abstractions, something beloved in a form that’s just different enough to seem mysteriously new. When Warner Bros. asked Prince to edit Crystal Ball down into two LPs, it became the Sign o’ the Times we recognize today, and it’s a stronger album for that, even if it’s a compromised artistic vision. As Prince finalized versions of each of these projects, more and more recording occurred around them; Prince practically seemed to live in the studio during this period. Tracks like “Adonis and Bathsheba” emerged, a fascinating and strange ballad poured out at a diagonal angle, and one of several vault tracks from this era that ends with a firework of a guitar solo. There’s a brief suggestion of Prince flirting with gospel on rave-ups like “When the Dawn of the Morning Comes” and “Walkin’ in Glory,” the grooves of which bring to mind an image of Prince strutting on high-heels through a congregation.  The most legendary, whispered-about lost song here is “Wally,” which Prince wrote for Wally Stafford, one of his bodyguards and dancers, who comforted Prince after his breakup with fiancée Susannah Melvoin. Prince reportedly thought the song was too personal to keep and asked Susan Rogers to delete the original track, despite her protests. He recorded it in a new arrangement a few days later, but this recording too went unheard. All of the sudden, here it is. It’s a Prince piano ballad that stops and starts like a conversation, pianos and horns lurching back and forth like their attention’s drifting toward each speaker, though we only hear one side: a playful question (“Wally/Where’d you get those glasses?/Those are the freakiest glasses I’ve ever seen”) that spirals out into Prince’s all-consuming loneliness without ever shedding the sense of humor that regulates their back-and-forth. Every other line is at least a joke or a confession; most of them are both. In the order of theatrically heartbroken Prince songs it feels posed somewhere between “Another Lonely Christmas” and “Purple Rain,” and there is yet another phenomenal guitar solo that coils and sparks through the final minutes of the track. By the time Sign o’ the Times came out, Prince had replaced the Revolution with a band that responded to every flicker of his fingers. (They’re in great form in the Utrecht show and the New Year’s Eve performance at Paisley Park documented in this set.) He wasn’t a band member or a co-writer anymore. He was a conductor, a bandleader, like his hero James Brown. The music bent to his pressure, and the music was never quite the same. The grooves tightened up to the point where they could feel airless and mechanical, like pistons mindlessly hammering beneath a car hood. Even when the songs were good—and they often were—they started reacting to and absorbing popular sounds instead of dictating them. Sign o’ the Times is the strange, cracked compass that took him to this place, containing both everything he once had (his band, his relationship with Susannah Melvoin) and its dissolution. The path forked where it did. The album cover depicts him as a blur walking away from an unmanned drumset and an empty piano bench on a stage strewn with flowers. He wouldn’t look back, if he even could.","With 63 previously unreleased tracks, this newly remastered version of Prince’s groundbreaking 1987 album is a trove of lost songs and dramatic lore, a jaw-dropping look into one of the most creatively fertile times in his career.

Floor Seats II,A$AP Ferg,by: Dylan Green,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f75e03556ea3d82fbe784b3/1:1/w_160/floor%202%20seats_asap%20ferg.jpg,2020-10-03 05:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/asap-ferg-floor-seats-ii/,A$AP WORLDWIDEPolo GroundsRCA,"On his 2013 mixtape-turned-debut-album Trap Lord, A$AP Ferg was ahead of his time. Even among the region-defying ranks of his (apparently former) A$AP Mob affiliates, Ferg’s debut stood out as truly weird. His voice and bravado were unmistakably New York, but singles “Shabba” and “Work” pulled as much from Lex Luger’s maximalist aesthetic as they did from Dipset’s uptown swagger, forecasting the stranglehold Atlanta trap would have on rap for the rest of the 2010s. Seven years later, on his latest project Floor Seats II, Ferg’s music no longer sounds avant-garde. In his defense, Ferg has settled into a comfortable rhythm since 2017’s lively but low-stakes Still Striving mixtape. His insistence on familiarity tracks within our current cultural climate. The coronavirus is still raging across the world, with the United States in particular still struggling with its first wave. Ferg recently told Complex that Floor Seats II is “music to take people’s minds elsewhere, and off what’s happening in the state of the world right now.” The project’s loose concept is geared around sitting courtside at a basketball game, with its loaded tracklist representing the celebrities you might see at a game The Knicks would currently be losing at The Garden if it were open. If anything, it makes me miss the scent of beer and rage that floats from The Garden into Penn Station below every game night. The concept doesn’t really suit the boisterous nature of Ferg’s music, which can make you feel like you’re milly-rocking at the top of the George Washington Bridge at its best. If there’s one thing Floor Seats II doesn’t lack, it’s energy. You can feel the velocity of songs like “Dennis Rodman” and “In It,” with Ferg’s flows lighting him up like the Human Torch; even his trademark barking and cooing adlibs happen faster. On “Move Ya Hips,” he feeds off of Nicki Minaj and MadeinTYO’s energy, building on his established chemistry with Minaj without recreating their 2017 hit “Plain Jane.” Ferg takes a few risks on Floor Seats II, and some pan out better than others. The penultimate song “Hectic,” co-produced by TGUT and Ferg himself, opens with a glitchy electronic beat before a mid-song switch reveals a tribal stomp that sounds like Clipse’s “Grindin’” in a wind tunnel. Ferg transitions effortlessly into a verse calling American racism to task: “I lost battles for my peace/Take those shackles off our feet/And we got diamonds in our teeth/But we’re still a nigga to the police.” Ferg’s passionate story of his come up and his claim to the A$AP legacy on closing song “Big A$AP” is softened by a posh piano run almost as silly as the one on Kendrick Lamar and Mary J. Blige’s infamous duet “Now Or Never.” Both “No Ceilings” and “Aussie Freaks” are anchored by Brooklyn drill beats, and while Ferg gives it his all, it would be a stretch to say he sounds natural over this skittering production. It’s one of the few times Ferg has chased a trend instead of trying to set one. Even with the added variety, Floor Seats II often cedes too much time to its guests. Tyga dominates the first half of “Dennis Rodman” with a forgettable verse before Ferg blows him out of the water on the back half. The flex of inviting Diddy to monologue over “Hectic” isn’t worth listening to his motivational-meme posturing in between verses. Ferg works well with guests, which is why this project exists, but not when they start eating into the runtime. On the hook for “Value,” Ferg briefly resurrects his Trap Lord persona. It briefly provokes nostalgia for the moment when invisible chains and random merch giveaways on Twitter were the height of cool, when putting Waka Flocka Flame and B-Real on the same album was considered fresh and forward-thinking. This is not that time. Floor Seats II is a fun but familiar distraction where Ferg seems content to ride the wave, for better and for worse.","With his trailblazing Trap Lord days behind him, the brash former A$AP affiliate returns with a fun, familiar album that is content to chase trends instead of set them.

Who Made the Sunshine,Westside Gunn,by: Alphonse Pierre,Staff Writer ,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f7216deb721798c1a9de150/1:1/w_160/who%20made%20the%20sunshine_westside%20gunn.jpg,2020-10-02 05:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/westside-gunn-who-made-the-sunshine/,Shady,"No Westside Gunn project stands alone. Each release is like a Marvel movie, made to raise the profile of his Griselda Records brand and introduce new rappers into his tight-knit community of collaborators. If it happens to be really good, that’s a bonus. A Westside Gunn project has both a floor and a ceiling: The worst are not so bad, and the best are exciting, but just a notch below great. Most importantly though, they’re reliable, like a Toyota that’s good on gas and only has to go to the shop once a year. Westside Gunn’s new album, Who Made the Sunshine, is exactly what you would expect: glamorous beat loops and gaudy raps delivered with the confidence of someone who believes that all of their thoughts belong in the MoMA. His standout solo moment is “Big Basha’s,” where Gunn weaves between grimy and swanky bars. “Glock next to my nuts, Balenciagas oversized,” he says, on Daringer and Beat Butcha production that would suit dinner on a yacht. But outside of “Big Basha’s” the album is less a showcase for Westside Gunn, than for his favorite rising emcees, underground stalwarts, and hip-hop legends. If you were to rank the top five verses on Who Made the Sunshine, I’m not sure any of them would belong to Westside Gunn. On the eight-minute posse cut “Frank Murphy,” for instance, five guests leave their mark on a soothing Conductor Williams beat. Most notably, the Syracuse native Stove God Cooks mentions that his plug resembles Razor Ramon, compares an act of violence to the Rocky training montage, and offers possibly the first Bruce Bowen name-drop in at least a decade, all in one unforgettable minute. Similarly, “All Praises” overcomes unnecessary Westside Gunn crooning through mellow Alchemist production, a radiant Boldy James verse, and Jadakiss, who never fails to be timely: “Everybody woke now, they want us to vote now/COVID-19 is the stamp on the dope now.” But Westside Gunn deserves credit for his Kanye-like ability to seamlessly work anyone into his world. The best example of this is a pair of Slick Rick features, which Gunn treats carefully. Each verse is slotted at the end of their respective tracks, for maximum reverence. On “Ocean Prime,” following an overly intense Busta Rhymes, the beat becomes slightly less busy and draws you in, as if Gunn’s afraid you’ll miss a word of Rick’s verse.  On both songs, Rick sounds ageless and sly; “Goodnight” is like the moment when a wrestling forefather makes their long-awaited return to Monday Night Raw. Yet, as far as Westside Gunn projects go, the loops here are less memorable and consistent than his better records (see: Pray for Paris and Flygod). Tracks like Daringer and Beat Butcha’s “The Butcher and the Blade” and “Ishkabibble’s” are fine, but they sound like leftovers from Kool G Rap’s 4,5,6 that have been cleaned up and polished—they could use some mud. Daringer and Beat Butcha are responsible for seven of the 11 tracks, and they make up for the few misfires with splashes of greatness, like “Lessie,” which includes a nostalgia-invoking sample resembling an ice-cream truck jingle. But it’s these slight inconsistencies that separate the more successful Westside Gunn projects from the forgettable ones.

EP1,Isola,by: Philip Sherburne,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f7213b27cb59ed22755c4d2/1:1/w_160/ep1_isola.jpg,2020-10-02 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/isola-ep1/,Godmode,"The Las Vegas-born musician Ivana Carrescia’s voice flits about the edges of her club tracks like a benevolent ghost. She sings in a downy falsetto that rarely rises above lullaby levels, and she whispers as often as she sings. Her lyrics are mostly just scraps of snapshots, pieces torn from a larger whole and tossed to the wind: the taste of salt, the color blue, flowers in the rain. Much of her time behind the mic yields only wordless expressions—coos, sighs, wisps of tinted air. The first time we hear her voice, 30 seconds into her debut EP’s lead track, “Ischia,” it takes the form of a single reversed syllable, glinting like an apparition before it disappears into velvety dub delay: the echo of a shadow of a specter that haunts a decades-old memory of the dancefloor. Carrescia used to record under the aliases Ivana XL and Eddi Front, writing wistful, reverb-laden songs for acoustic guitar and piano. Singing of angels, bad breakups, and the Lone Star State, she evoked the watery melancholy of Cat Power and the retro fantasies of Lana Del Rey, her voice faint as a sun-bleached photograph, her upright sounding like it had been through a hurricane or two. She reappeared in 2016 as Gioia with a strikingly different proposition, wrapping breathy singing in abstracted atmospheres and electronic throb—a homegrown style not too far from what Kelly Lee Owens was doing around the same time. But Carrescia’s debut outing as Isola marks an even bigger shift, embracing the rich, moody sound of turn-of-the-millennium deep house. As she did on Gioia’s lone EP, Carrescia wrote and recorded her Isola debut in collaboration with Godmode head Nick Sylvester (a former Pitchfork contributor). Working remotely between Vegas and Los Angeles, the two exchanged ideas, condensing and arranging their sprawling raw materials—improvised synth jams, homemade soundbanks, tape manipulations, ad-hoc vocals—into streamlined forms. Like Godmode releases from Shamir, Yaeji, and Channel Tres, EP1 stakes out a middle ground between pop and dance music, pairing the melodies of the former with the enveloping flow of the latter. But Isola’s music might be the most unreservedly club-focused of her labelmates’ output—or at the very least, the most narrowly focused on a specific set of references. She lays it all out on the table with “Ischia,” in which virtually every element is a fine-tuned tribute to Luomo’s 2000 album Vocalcity, from the dubby chords to the snub-nosed bassline to snippets of breath that drift like confetti. This brand of smooth, sophisticated deep house used to be a minor cottage industry, epitomized in tunes like Tom Middleton’s Cosmos remix of Kylie Minogue’s “Chocolate”; it’s been out of favor for so long, it’s a treat to hear it revived. But “Ischia” isn’t merely a good imitation. Hypnotic yet constantly evolving, it strikes the perfect balance of propulsive groove and heady atmosphere—the kind of thing that makes you feel like you’re dancing and floating in space all at once. “Two Birds” sets its sights on trip-hop, while “La Notte” and “Canis Major” are largely amorphous sketches for voice and piano, but the bulk of the EP is dedicated to recreating late-’90s house and techno at their most immersive. “Ricorda – Tell Me” takes the deadweight bass thump and dub-techno chords of classic Rhythm & Sound and spins them into an eight-minute journey in which, despite the fundamentally repetitive form, no two bars sound alike. “Any Day” is structured around cascading chords that suggest a “Good Life”-type anthem is about to kick off at any moment; instead, the duo plays with expectations, building toward a climax and then pulling back, leaving Carrescia’s voice twisting in the wind just when you expect the drumbeat to drop. As laborious as the writing process may have been, the results feel fluid and spontaneous—linear but perpetually shifting, moving with the gyroscopic surety of a dancer weaving her way through a shoulder-to-shoulder crowd. The EP reaches its own climax midway through with “Said It Again.” Following the drop-less “Any Day” and then the vaporous “Canis Major,” the song’s chest-caressing sub-bass and crisp, tick-tocking house beat come as an almost physical relief. Pastel chords add depth; Carrescia’s wistful vocal (“And in the nothing night, I cried for you/And in the morning time, I flew the field”) is her most emotionally direct performance on the record. The mix of elements faintly recalls Bodily Functions-era Herbert, another deep-house staple of the new millennium. The whole thing exudes a kind of weary glamor: The synths and voice have the texture of rumpled silk; muted horns shimmer like reflected sunlight on the skyline. I’m transported back to Sunday-morning taxi rides home from the club, ears still ringing. Isola’s music is alive with these moments; at once nostalgic and visceral, it feels populated by the spirits of life-changing nights on the dancefloor.","Ivana Carrescia’s latest project blends pop melodies with rich, moody, turn-of-the-millennium deep house. It’s the kind of music that makes you feel like you’re both dancing and floating in space.

Clam Day,Otto,by: Noah Yoo,Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f720f7c9c52ebb23ff6654f/1:1/w_160/clam%20day_otto.jpg,2020-10-02 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/otto-clam-day/,PLZ Make It Ruins,"At the turn of the century, around the same time as the rise of the Shibuya-kei movement, Japanese producer Nobukazu Takemura was spearheading the development of a style that writer and musician Nick Currie (Momus) would later dub “cute formalism:” an aesthetic that adheres to the prescribed notions of a subgenre while imbuing it with a sense of lightness and playfulness. Clam Day, the debut album from Brooklyn native Otto Benson a.k.a. OTTO, fits neatly into this lineage, offering a chipper take on electronica that is exhilarating and disquieting all at once. Clam Day’s palette is well-defined: Digital filters garble voices while vintage drum machines push up against bright squiggles and chirps to provide a pulse. There’s a distinct “island of misfit toys” approach to the way Benson flings around samples. The cheekily titled “Sprained My Ankle in Gristedes Juice Aisle” feels like Aphex Twin’s manic “Afx237 v.7” on mood stabilizers, while early highlight “Crystal Hole” imagines Animal Collective’s Sung Tongs as digested by a lo-fi house producer. In addition to Benson, two friends—credited only as Max B and Ronnie P—sang and co-wrote songs for the album. Each of the vocal tracks were inspired by “corporate sprites,” Benson’s term for the colorful cartoon mascots deployed by big brands to interface with consumers. As he brings their world to life, he imbues his songs with a subtle unease. “Waiting to pay all the medical bills for you and me and everyone we know,” Max B sings on the chorus of “Guess My Crush,” his voice made child-like with pitch-shifting. The result is something akin to the wickedly funny web series Don’t Hug Me I’m Scared, with its brightly colored cloth puppets pondering the myriad horrors of existence under the guise of children’s television programming. Benson’s arrangements flip back and forth between minimalism and maximalism—simple pads and shuffling drums in one moment, blown-out percussion sequences the next. By the end of the record, he’s dreaming up music for fictional characters (“Kwop Kwop Theme”) and dabbling with murky ambient synth textures (“Microplastics In My Bloodstream”). Still, some of the tracks run out of ideas after establishing an initial vibe; the aptly named “Forest Ritual” would make great incidental music for a video game, but quickly becomes set dressing in an album context. The most memorable songs on Clam Day take advantage of genre tropes to subvert your expectations and laugh in your face. “Valentino Couture Crusty Crayon” turns indie rock jangles and Boards of Canada synths into a cacophony of tape distortion. It’s immediately followed by “Wash Your Hands,” which is both a public health announcement and a heartfelt song about being peed on. This punch-drunk atmosphere is the most endearing charm of OTTO’s debut; it evokes an uncanny other world, where simple melodies and unrefined sounds can collide with the intricacy of IDM with reckless abandon.","The Brooklyn electronic musician’s punch-drunk and disquieting debut subverts genre tropes to laugh in your face.

Men on the Verge of Nothing,Seth Bogart,by: Jesse Dorris,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f76242bc37693e19746e7a8/1:1/w_160/Men%20on%20the%20Verge%20of%20Nothing_Seth%20Bogart.jpg,2020-10-02 05:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/seth-bogart-men-on-the-verge-of-nothing/,Wacky Wacko,"In 1987, the sexologist and psychiatrist Richard Green published The Sissy Boy Syndrome, a sympathetic but, you know, problematic document of his search to find links between adult homosexuality and, as The New York Times then described it, “extreme cases of boyhood effeminacy.” Leaving aside the why of homosexuality—why not?—the twinned notions that gender-nonconforming boys are more likely to grow up gay and in need of medical help is retro in an ugly way. Seth Bogart has been offering extreme cases of boyish effeminacy since his days in the fabulous mess that was Gravy Train!!!!, the electroclash outfit also featuring current Younger Lovers honcho and literary darling Brontez Purnell. As the Hunx in Hunx and His Punx, Bogart made retro, horned-up garage rock in such a beautiful way. Bogart’s world went Day-Glo for a slicked-up, self-titled solo album in 2016; since then, he’s launched a clothing line, the influential Wacky Wacko, staged art shows at NYC’s Participant Inc. and MoCA and MOCAD, and lately offered ceramic reproductions of queer classics like Cookie Mueller’s Garden of Ashes. Men on the Verge of Nothing arrives at a time when much of California is in ashes and the rest of the world feels like it’s on the verge of collapse. But like many of us, Bogart has put his trust in the community of women, both real and imagined, assembling a band of sisters including Bikini Kill’s Tobi Vail and Kathleen Hanna, Kate Nash, ex-Punx Erin Emslie and Alana Amram (who also plays in the terrific psych-rock band Habibi)—and, most prominently, Roxanne Clifford of Patience and the shoulda-been-huge Veronica Falls. Men takes a note from Veronica Falls’ fuzz-pop, and another from the sound of the late Patrick Doyle, the much-missed Veronica Falls drummer who made his own kind of queer noise-pop as Basic Plumbing. Seth and friends have made an album of bummer jams that sound like hugs from a pal who’s bummed out about boys. It’s got jangle, two tons of reverb, and that Sunday-morning-stroll-through-a-cemetery-with-coffee pep. “Professionals” deconstructs the current use of “queerness” as currency among straight men in academia and the art world. “They love to breed us,” Bogart sings, both winking and rolling his eye. “You smell like an amateur.” Experienced allies of all sorts get a look over in “Brainwashers,” a spry little ode to how the political left eats itself alive. “Everybody wants to tell you/what you already know…I’m desperate, I’m a dog/Who’s the attention hog?” Queer guys don’t get off much easier. “Lavender Heights” minces like vintage Magnetic Fields, and Bogart’s voice is closer to Stephen Merritt’s dolorous Eeyore than his usual bratty self, but his reminiscences of mushrooms and merriment in San Francisco’s gay enclave sour with the realization of how privileged they all were. “Sunday Boy” is similarly distrustful of losing yourself in the comfort of a lover: “We used to talk almost every day/You had so much to say/But now you feel like a waste of time…Every Sunday you hang with your Sunday Guy.” As it happens, a friend of Bogart’s was sent as a boy for “treatment” from Richard Green. “Boys Who Don’t Want to Be Boys” is an ode to him, a surf-rock beast which drips with scorn for those who seek to strip the sissiness out of young men and replace it with—what? The clenched menace of Mike Pence? The forces that make men warp them. “Mr. Know-It-All is always right/And I think the only way out of this, is somehow they lose all their power,” Bogart sneers before sing-songing the title of the title track along with Clifford and an insouciant tambourine. One reason there aren’t a lot of grown men to look up to is that so many died in the AIDS pandemic. “Sometimes I wonder where are all the older guys,” Bogart murmurs in “The Other Siders.” “I find it hard to imagine a world where they are still alive.” One could say, join SAGE; look to what that generation achieved rather than swoon at their absence; fight for your life to extend past what theirs could. Unless we throw the category of men right out the window, we need to envision male possibilities. Until then, like Pedro Almodóvar, the director whose masterwork Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown Bogart almost-inverts as his own, we’ll just have to follow the lead of women. Men’s tracks venerate a certain kind of gay guy’s icons: X-Ray Spex’s Poly Styrene, whose classic “Oh Bondage! Up Yours” becomes, in Bogart’s hands, less enraged than engorged. And “Dawn’s Lips” doubles-up on the hero-worship, transposing the Vaselines’ perennial “Molly’s Lips” into a love letter to Welcome to the Dollhouse’s Dawn Wiener. Let the boys sissy out and shimmy like Dawn danced to her garage rock crush. The alternative is sick.","The storied career of the glammy singer-songwriter continues with a jangly, fuzzy, noisy album of bummer jams that sound like hugs from a pal who’s bummed out about boys.

Ohms,Deftones,by: Andy Cush,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f7208b29c52ebb23ff66518/1:1/w_160/ohms_deftones.jpg,2020-10-01 05:00:00,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/deftones-ohms/,Warner,"For Deftones fans, the relationship between frontman Chino Moreno and guitarist Stephen Carpenter carries mythological importance: two opposing gravitational pulls that keep the band’s beautiful and bludgeoning music hovering precariously in between. Carpenter is the proudly unreconstructed metalhead, delivering slabs of distorted low end on 7- and 8-string guitars and publicly airing grievances about songs that aren’t heavy enough. Moreno is the sonic experimenter and starry romantic, with a voice that sounds misty and ethereal even when it breaks into a scream—the man whose band gave a generation of angry young rock radio listeners their first exposure to the Cocteau Twins. Moreno and Carpenter’s personal relationship is surely more nuanced than that, and Moreno is clearly a metal fan, too. But the push-pull between musical elements is real, and the reason why Deftones albums continue to feel exciting and alive while nearly every other band once labeled nu-metal now looks like self-parodic kitsch. The Deftones catalog is full of moments that illustrate this fundamental tension, but none satisfies in quite the same way as “Urantia,” the third song from their ninth album Ohms. It begins with a jagged one-one riff played with disorienting power, gearing you up for a sustained assault. Instead of attacking, the song veers hard in the other direction: spacious and tender, riding a variation of the lithe, hip-hop-influenced hi-hat groove drummer Abe Cunningham developed around the time of 2000’s high-water mark White Pony and has been refining ever since. It’s a satisfying reversal, and becomes something greater than that when the riff comes back—as big and loud as it was the first time, but newly seductive and agile, guiding Moreno’s airy vocal through a series of pop chord changes toward a chorus that floods the room with light. Suddenly, the band’s two driving instincts are no longer in tension at all, but perfectly natural complements, each lifting and twirling the other like partners in the world’s most brutal figure skating routine. For the first time—after years of strife and a hard-fought comeback in 2016’s Gore—Deftones are making it look easy. Moreno signaled in a recent Uproxx interview that Ohms would satisfy fans of Deftones’ most intense material, while also giving himself some plausible deniability: “‘Heavy’ is kind of subjective, you know? The last thing I ever want to do is be quoted saying, ‘This is our heaviest record!’” He’s right that “heaviest” isn’t quite the proper distinction for an album that never wields the unrelenting sledgehammer force of “Elite” or “When Girls Telephone Boys.” But it also forgoes the crystalline hush that seems to bother Carpenter so much, never offering respite for more than a minute or two before slamming you again. Instead, Ohms reaches for a plane beyond the simple loud vs. quiet dichotomy, where the band is free to indulge its harshest and most gentle impulses all at once. On “The Spell of Mathematics,” an eerie high synthesizer line softens the sludge metal guitars that churn beneath it; against the grinding feedback and noise of “Error,” Moreno purrs lovelorn free associations instead of adding his own howls to the fray. In the three decades since their origins as Sacramento skate rats, Deftones have struggled with addiction, lost bassist Chi Cheng to a coma and eventual death from heart failure, and repeatedly appeared on the verge of implosion over Moreno and Carpenter’s musical differences. At some point amid the turmoil, they became elder statesmen—and not just in the commercial hard rock world, but to younger, hipper bands like Nothing and Deafheaven that proudly wear their influence. They’ve earned the right to relax, and they’re not attempting to radically shift your notion of what their music can be. For those of us who have stuck around, that’s just fine; a Deftones album that effortlessly twists their familiar components into a few genuinely new shapes is plenty exciting. On Ohms, they keep their most adventurous sounds to the margins. “Pompeji” dissolves into a wash of ominous synth drone, lulling you into complacency before the hydraulic rhythms of “This Link Is Dead” arrive to shake you awake; “The Spell of Mathematics” spends half its runtime on a gorgeous instrumental coda, with placid guitar chords draped like a security blanket over anxiously shuffling drums. At times, I wish the band would integrate moments like these more wholly into the songs themselves, but perhaps doing so would upset the delicate equilibrium they seem to have reached. Still, Deftones thrive on tension; there’s a reason none of Moreno and Carpenter’s side projects, where each is free of the other’s constricting influence, has produced anything as resonant as their main band’s best work. If they’ve reached a détente, don’t expect it to last for long. In April, Moreno live streamed a DJ set that paired extreme metal like Blut Aus Nord with left-field electronic music like Suicideyear; in August, Carpenter announced he’d added a ninth string to his guitar.","Deftones’ ninth album reaches for a plane beyond loud and quiet, where the band is free to indulge its harshest and most gentle impulses at once.

Rilo Kiley,Rilo Kiley,by: Quinn Moreland,Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f74d5a9d2d1ace40173a24c/1:1/w_160/rilo%20kiley_rilo%20kiley.jpg,2020-10-01 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/rilo-kiley-rilo-kiley/,Little Record Company,"Before she was one of the most beloved singer-songwriters of her era, Jenny Lewis was best known for her role as redhead girl scout Hannah Nefler in the 1989 film Troop Beverly Hills. While she was able to indulge in some of the trappings of child stardom, Lewis’ youth was anything but glamorous: She carried an immense pressure as her family’s breadwinner, which was made all the more difficult by her mother’s struggles with addiction. In the mid-’90s, when a teenage Lewis met Blake Sennett, a fellow young actor with credits on Salute Your Shorts and Boy Meets World, they recognized each other as kindred spirits, both disillusioned with showbiz and its associated pressures. “I was incredibly depressed, having grown up doing one thing and suddenly finding myself not interested in that,” Lewis told Spin in 2007. “I really had no idea what I was going to do with my life.” For both Lewis and Sennett, music was an opportunity to explore creative autonomy; for the first time, they were pursuing their own visions rather than acting out someone else's dreams. (As Lewis’ sister recently told Pitchfork, “I think she didn’t want to be saying other people’s words anymore.”) Lewis and Sennett sat down to write songs together and soon were playing casual shows in their friends’ living rooms; later, they started dating. Somewhere along the way, the band formalized under the name Rilo Kiley. Sennett recruited his high school buddy Pierre “Duke” de Reeder to play bass and Dave Rock to play drums, a role that Jason Boesel later settled into. In January 1998, Rilo Kiley played their first show at a Silverlake nightclub called Spaceland. If they were nervous, it didn’t show. “Between songs they were charming, smart and funny,” recalls The Kids in the Hall comedian Dave Foley, who happened to catch the set. “During songs they were brilliant.” Smitten, he offered to pay for a demo recording, which the band accepted. Many of the songs from the Foley-funded session would go on to form Rilo Kiley’s self-titled 1999 debut (later released with a slightly altered tracklist as The Initial Friend EP). For two songwriters who grew up surrounded by Hollywood fakery, Sennett and Lewis’ songwriting is immediately, remarkably unselfconscious. Their twangy indie rock songs avoid flowery language in favor of conversational observations and winking wordplay. “I should’ve known/With a boy like you/Your middle name is always/I’d always love you,” Lewis swoons on a synth-pop ditty called—obviously—“Always.” Same deal with “I’ll be in your car/I locked the keys in your car/I’ll be in your car for now” off “85.” Perhaps there are more poetic ways of expressing these sentiments—of fateful infatuation, of resolve—but the directness of Rilo Kiley’s storytelling aims straight for the heart. Lewis’ emotional candor, along with the band’s association with Conor Oberst and Omaha label Saddle Creek, have led some to describe Rilo Kiley as emo, a genre most commonly linked to whiny, vaguely ill-looking white boys. There are arguments to be made for both sides of the emo-or-aren’t-they question, but it is incontestable that Lewis’ capacity for vulnerability spoke to countless young women. Her expressions of sadness could take many shapes—wry, morbid, exhausted—but were always excruciatingly self-aware and sharp. “I’ve been a mess for some time now/I get what I deserve,” Lewis sings on “85.” “For someone who leaves a lot behind/I can do better.” On the pop-punk-lite “Glendora,” Lewis describes her own exploitation at the hands of a cruel boy who uses her for sex and a distraction from suburban malaise. “You know I always like to play the victim,” she sings plainly. “And would you fuck me? Because I’d fuck me.” It’s a disarming line, and “Glendora” lays the contradictions of womanhood out on the table, a whole bundle of flaws and strengths tied up in one complicated package. “When I sit down to write a song, there is no filter,” Lewis told ELLE years later. “I’m not trying to write for anyone or anything specifically. It’s just trying to capture a little piece of your soul—even if it’s a really ugly part.” Though Rilo Kiley is rooted in indie rock, it’s clear that the band had not yet found their sound. The Sennett-led cut “Asshole” is broken up by turntable scratching and samples while Lewis straight-up yodels on “Gravity.” On “Teenage Love Song,” an aching Patsy Cline-indebted ballad, Lewis two-steps her way towards the tortured melodrama of a broken heart. “Oh Davey, why did you leave me/All alone when we went all the way?” she belts like a gale-force wind roaring through Nashville. “But maybe someday Davey/We’ll be together for more than a day.” And then there’s “The Frug.” Despite the fact that they were unsigned, Rilo Kiley’s music made its way into the hands of director Morgan J. Freeman, who included two of the band’s songs in his 1998 film Desert Blue. Freeman’s video for “The Frug” landed the band on MTV’s alternative program 120 Minutes. It was a bit weird for everyone. As Sennett recalled in 2001, “It’s pretty random to see the most independent of independent bands on MTV.” Filled with handclaps and doo-wop harmonies, “The Frug” is one of Rilo Kiley’s sugariest songs and is unlike anything else on Rilo Kiley. As the song patiently explains, Lewis can do the Frug. She can also do the Robocop and the Freddie. She cannot do the Smurf. But this groovy laundry list gives way to a declaration of strength and empowerment: “I can take my clothes off/I cannot fall in love/You will never see my eyes/I will not call you back.” After the release of Rilo Kiley—sold exclusively at their shows—the band spent the next few years searching for a label before signing with Seattle’s Barsuk and releasing their proper debut, 2001’s Take Offs and Landings. That same year, Lewis and Sennett split and songwriting responsibilities started to shift over to Lewis. Rilo Kiley’s final record and major-label debut, the sleek and divisive Under the Blacklight, came out in 2007. By that point, Lewis and Sennett were both branching out with side projects (Lewis’ solo work, Sennett’s band the Elected) and interviews with the group from that time suggest that Lewis’ independent success drove something of a wedge between the pair. When asked about the status of Rilo Kiley in 2011, Sennett said that if the band were a human, “he’s probably laying on his back in a morgue with a tag on his toe.” A few years later, Lewis drove the final nail into the coffin and confirmed that Rilo Kiley was no more. Since then, with only a 2013 rarities set to tide fans over, the band has existed as a treasured manifesto on how to live a truthful, if imperfect, life. If the breakup was a song, Lewis would probably point out that it was better that way.","On their remarkably self-assured 1999 debut, the indie rock band were already in possession of the wry, morbid sensibility that would define them.

Transmissions: The Music of Beverly Glenn-Copeland,Beverly Glenn-Copeland,by: Gabriel Szatan,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f720a376731b9d23eac359d/1:1/w_160/transmissions_beverly-glenn%20copeland.jpg,2020-10-01 05:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/beverly-glenn-copeland-transmissions-the-music-of-beverly-glenn-copeland/,Transgressive,"For almost the entirety of Beverly Glenn-Copeland’s life, the music was there but listeners were not. Then, one day in 2016, an intervention wholesome enough to feel scripted arrived: one spam-bound email from a record collector inquiring about back stock. Now audiences come to gather in the company of an artist who has spent three-quarters of a century revolving around the sun with one soul and two selves. The openly queer Black artist once shunned by peers and forced to flee sexual reprogramming has arrived at a moment where everybody wants to be his friend. A palm-reader’s premonition in the 1970s that Glenn-Copeland would attain success in winter years was fulfilled when two reissues of his masterwork Keyboard Fantasies turned a trickle of interest into a surge. Look to pick up a copy online and you’ll be met with recommendations for Midori Takada and William Onyeabor––other brilliant musicians of the 1980s who became hot commodities on the market after decades of quiescence. If you were to walk into a listening bar either side of the globe in the last few years, chances are you’d catch the dinky, DX7-rendered electric piano on Keyboard Fantasies’ “Sunset Village” gliding out of a set of ludicrously expensive speakers. Hidden from view for so long, Glenn-Copeland was reborn as the North Star of new age. That’s where the tale might have ended, were it not for the artist’s keenness to be actively involved, rather than just regarded as a dusty curio. A lifetime of withheld yeses poured forth from Glenn-Copeland: to lectures, to podcasts, even a segment on Canadian television where he flew to Tokyo and thanked his benefactor in person. Having appeared in concert just once between 1980 and 2018––a period in which Beverly transitioned, moved to the water’s edge in New Brunswick and found long-sought stability with his current wife, Elizabeth––he embarked on tour, delivering lieder-indebted torch songs and age-old spirituals that stretched well beyond Keyboard Fantasies’ synth miniatures, in performances as stately and dignified as the stained-glass murals that adorn his record sleeves and stage production. Following a crowd-sourced documentary in 2019 which took his story wider still, Transmissions is the first formal attempt to gather works from across Beverly Glenn-Copeland’s career in one place. The physical copy spans just nine tracks and 47 minutes (although the digital edition extends past the hour mark), which appears slight for an artist who could easily command double the runtime. Given the wide variety of styles and moods across the compilation, as well as the potential for emotional overload, a gentle introduction might be an act of mercy. At numerous points, it can seem as if you’ve flipped over to a different record entirely. The white-knuckle, fluent jamming of the Toronto jazz ensemble who feature on “Erzili”––which closed out 1971’s Beverly Glenn-Copeland––feels impossibly separate from the plangent synthesizer tones and steady tug of double-bass on the newest solo song here, 2018’s “River Dreams.” Three tracks from 2004’s little-known Primal Prayer make it the most represented of all Glenn-Copeland’s albums, another twist. Recorded under the alias Phynix, it captured Glenn-Copeland as he rebounded from a health scare with gaiety in abundance. The jaunty, cruise-ready instrumentals that lead them off only really make sense when Glenn-Copeland swoops down on deck and begins to warble. Transmissions opens with one of these: “La Vita” surges forth in Italian with operatic flair, a sharp rejoinder if you came expecting to be soothed, before melting into what most listeners would recognize as the conventional A1 of Glenn-Copeland’s oeuvre, Keyboard Fantasies’ “Ever New.” Across Glenn-Copeland’s songbook are pearls of wisdom about grace, forgiveness and spiritual ablution; given what we know of the artist’s history, it’s easy to find yourself shrinking in your seat. Two haunting numbers from 1970’s Beverly Copeland reflect the climate he grew up in: “Sometimes,” Beverly beckons on “Durocher,” “I get to thinking what’s the use of going on? What’s the use of loving when hatred is so strong?” Solace lies in “Don’t Despair”: “Tomorrow may bring roses...tomorrow may bring love.” Glenn-Copeland’s voice anchors it all, a rich contralto capable of zooming up octaves and hushing a crowd from fifty paces. This is most evident in a rendition of “Deep River,” captured during Utrecht arts festival Le Guess Who?, where Glenn-Copeland performed in 2018 at the invitation of Devendra Banhart and Moor Mother. In between that enrapturing flutter, he breaks into a speaking voice somewhere between compère and camp leader, inviting the assembled throng to chant with him and his band, Indigo Rising. The audience, hesitant to encroach at first, slowly creeps into the recording before finding full voice at the climax. The effect is riveting. While the sequencing on Transmissions does fortify a greater understanding about Beverly Glenn-Copeland’s gift, the comp essentially ties a bow atop an established feel-good story. The same themes recur with every review, interview, and radio special: joy, acceptance, redemption, magic. What does it say about us that we’re all lusting after hope?

Palo Alto,Thelonious Monk,by: Marty Sartini Garner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f7203953d8019e558786bff/1:1/w_160/palo%20alto_thelonious%20monk.jpg,2020-10-01 05:00:00,Jazz,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/thelonious-monk-palo-alto/,Impulse!,"Thelonious Monk once said: “Weird means something you never heard before. It’s weird until people get around to it. Then it ceases to be weird.” By the time Monk and his quartet strode into the auditorium at Palo Alto High School on October 27, 1968, people hadn’t just gotten around to his oblong, minimalist take on jazz—they’d left it behind. After decades of toiling in New York’s clubs to little outside recognition, Monk had briefly tasted superstardom, culminating in a 1964 Time magazine cover. Less than half a decade later, he’d slipped to No. 6 on DownBeat’s International Critics Poll ranking jazz’s best pianists, and writers routinely dismissed his playing as stale and uninspired. Still, he was Thelonious Sphere Monk: If he was no longer weird, and no longer a superstar, he was still a legend. A legend who couldn’t afford to miss a $500 payday at a high school. The live album Palo Alto is a grainy snapshot of Monk and his classic quartet taking a break from their two-week stand at San Francisco’s Jazz Workshop to cut loose and get paid. But just as Monk’s music was characterized by the power of its empty spaces—he’s the person who said, “It’s not the notes you play, it’s those you leave out,” a chestnut as well-worn as any of his songs—Palo Alto’s thrills are made poignant by what was happening in his life unbeknownst to the audience, and what was happening in their life unbeknownst to Monk. This is exuberant, abundant music, made by and performed for people whose lives often felt anything but. Monk was in debt to the IRS. His wife, Nellie, took ill, then Monk did, too. A seizure in May of 1968 put him in a coma that caused him to miss several recording dates; his label, Columbia, charged him for the studio time. He needed every dollar he could earn, and Columbia’s lack of faith in his artistic vision wasn’t helping. At the time of the Palo Alto concert, his most recent album was Underground, which the label had tried to sell to the hippie crowd with a cover photo that portrayed Monk as a French liberation fighter hiding out in a Paris attic, where he could bang away at his keyboard and kick some Nazi ass in private. This did not work. While they were admittedly disinterested in the electric soundscapes labelmate Miles Davis would begin exploring by year’s end, Monk’s quartet showed up to Paly ready to boogie. They run roughshod through “Well, You Needn’t,” a Monk composition from 1944 that was by then a standard of his sets. Though it was typically a vehicle for some of his most wobbly improvisations, here it’s played with the heavy hip-shaking shuffle of an early R&B song. The quartet takes it at a dead sprint, lapping the version they’d laid down a few years earlier on Misterioso. Monk pushes saxophonist Charlie Rouse throughout the latter’s solo, jabbing with two-note chords like he’s testing for Rouse’s most vulnerable spots; the tenor responds with a rippling line that he staples to the piano’s bumpy contours. When it’s time for Monk to take the spotlight, he dissolves the song’s theme and goes to work moving around its component parts, his fluid runs set against a supremely funky bassline from Larry Gales, who later upstages his boss with a bowed-bass solo that sketches circles around the hard core of Monk’s playing. By the time they pounce on “Blue Monk,” they’re practically splitting the difference between Fats Waller and Fats Domino. Not hip references for 1968, sure, but the thumping power of these songs suggests that the quartet was fully capable of matching the pulse and drive of the era’s heaviest groups without sacrificing the musical complexity around which Monk built his songs. Even the quieter numbers demonstrate the physicality of Monk’s playing as much as its intricacy. The recording captures the persistent squeak of his chair as he navigates a subtly cubist rendition of the standard “Don’t Blame Me.” One of the school’s janitors recorded the concert, asking only that he be allowed to tune Monk’s piano in exchange, and his rudimentary recording captures incredible details: Gales cheerfully singing along to his own solo in “Well, You Needn’t,” Monk’s foot tapping out the beat in “Don’t Blame Me.” The tape gathered dust in the 50-plus years it spent in the private collection of Danny Scher, the Paly student who booked the concert despite being all of 16 years old, and the fidelity is understandably low. Crucially, the tape captures the response of a rapt crowd. Scher had promoted the concert heavily in East Palo Alto, a largely Black community located just across the Bayshore Freeway from tony Palo Alto. An unincorporated area with no means for self-governance, East Palo Alto was gutted when nearly half of its small businesses were razed to make way for the freeway in 1955, while land grabs by neighboring Menlo Park and Palo Alto itself robbed it of crucial property taxes. Still, the citizens of East Palo Alto resolutely pursued Black empowerment. The town played host to a national Black Power conference featuring Stokely Carmichael and Eldridge Cleaver in September of 1968, and ads for Monk’s show at Paly hung near posters promoting an initiative to rename the town Nairobi (the vote would be held mere days after the concert, failing by a two-to-one margin). East Palo Altans were understandably suspicious when a white teenager came around promising an appearance by a titan of bebop. Many didn’t buy their tickets until they saw Monk and the band roll into the school’s parking lot in Scher’s brother’s car. Monk was a supporter of the civil rights movement, and his biographer Robin D.G. Kelley suspects that he may have worried that simply playing benefits for CORE and SNCC wasn’t doing enough for the cause. In 1963, he told a French reporter that, while he viewed himself primarily as an American, that didn’t “prevent me from being aware of all the progress that still needs to be made,” adding, “I know my music can help bring people together, and that’s what is important.” That afternoon in Palo Alto, Monk did precisely that. As Kelley writes in his definitive biography, “[Black] and white kids from both Palo Altos” showed up at the gig, and they made their voices heard. They cheer as the band winds its way into the ending of “Blue Monk” and the quartet launches into a set-closing “Epistrophy.” “We used to talk about how the birds can do these extraordinary maneuvers where they’ll all change the formation, something that even airline pilots couldn’t do,” French horn player David Amram once recalled of his time with Monk, and in the final moments of the song, the band takes to the sky, weaving around one another in double-time staccato bursts, Ben Riley’s cymbals glowing like a California sunset. This is not the graceful latticework and tempo-shifting they displayed at the Jazz Workshop; it’s a strafing. When Monk finally sets the song down, the crowd whistles its delight. It seems unlikely that Monk and his quartet would have known about what was happening in East Palo Alto, but they’ve clearly been buoyed by the crowd’s youthful energy, and they deliver some of the fiercest, most spirited versions of their core repertoire in response. The notion that a great concert can end racism—or affect any kind of meaningful social change—is a convenient myth. Monk’s concert at Palo Alto High School didn’t change the fortune of East Palo Alto any more definitively than the $500 changed Monk’s own financial situation. But by offering a temporary escape from their respective grinds, it gave the artist and his audience a chance to catch their breath, shake themselves free, and revel in the sound of one of jazz’s greatest-ever combos simply enjoying themselves. As the applause rains down following “I Love You (Sweetheart of All My Dreams),” Monk speaks for the first time all afternoon. “We got to hurry back to get to work,” he says. “You dig?” For him, it’s an explanation; for the crowd, it’s an exhortation.","The legendary jazz pianist’s 1968 concert at Palo Alto High School, recorded by a janitor and shelved for decades, captures some of the fiercest, most spirited versions of his quartet’s core repertoire.

Only For Dolphins,Action Bronson,by: Dean Van Nguyen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f71ff16b721798c1a9de116/1:1/w_160/only%20for%20dolphins_action%20bronson.jpg,2020-09-30 05:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/action-bronson-only-for-dolphins/,Loma Vista,"When Action Bronson emerged a decade ago, he was hailed as a paragon of formalist East Coast hip-hop: a buddha-sized trash-talker who kicked loquacious rhymes, toked on breakbeats, and paid tribute to New York tacos. But recent years have seen Bronson embrace something akin to Dame Dash’s octopus business strategy: keep eight revenue streams open at all times. These days, he moonlights as an author, has his own cooking show on Vice, pops up in movies like The Irishman, and dabbles in art. Beneath his growing celebrity remains a rapper, albeit one whose dedication to the form may be diluting as he spreads himself across multiple interests. Given Bronson’s expanding outlook, it seems suitable that Only For Dolphins is his most eclectic album yet. Once infatuated by the eternal truths of boom-bap, he now boasts a more diversified palette that includes 1960s Brazilian pop, Latin funk, lounge jazz, and reggae. If nothing else, the album is a triumph of Bronson’s omnivorous musical taste, starting with the self-produced opener “Capoeira”—one of the best instrumentals he has ever spit over. Sampling the intro to I.N.D.’s obscure 1981 sophisti-pop number “Into New Dimensions,” the beat evokes memories of Operation: Doomsday-era DOOM, tempting Bronson to detail various adventures: sniffing coke off mirrors, jumping in a Jacuzzi with “12 freaks,” and cruising around in his beamer listening to Gerald Levert. Conversely, closer “Hard Target” places Bronson on stage in an underground jazz club, delivering a monologue on his achievements in the publishing industry and the diminishing effects of weed on his brain. A pianist tinkles in the background as the percussionist sprinkles in some natty little drum fills. Then there is a song like “Shredder,” a two-minute potboiler draped in the midnight noir sounds of somber saxophone lines, a prominent bassline, and shimmering keys. Perhaps taking influence from the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles’ arch-nemesis Oroku Saki, Bronson describes a night in the life of a villain. When in form, his worldbuilding remains sharp and vivid. It’s when you peer in closer that the cracks start to appear. There’s evidence that Bronson’s rapping has lost significant velocity, even compared to his relatively well-rapped last album White Bronco. Yes, the man who was moved to apologize to Ghostface Killah for claiming, “He’s not rapping like this no more” just ain’t rapping like that no more. This reduced emphasis on cannonade bars is why many of the better songs are the slower jams—“Hard Target,” “Shredder,” the swooning strings of “Vega”—but such is the lack of urgency on tracks like “Cliff Hanger”—you can picture Bronson studiously reading from his book of rhymes in the booth. It’s enticing to accept Bronson’s slowing flow as design rather than fading skills. Yet “C12H16N2” hints at a world-weariness that perhaps is evident in his voice: “I got older and I realized there was no heroes/Don’t even talk to me unless you’re talking more zeroes.” This lethargy is present in the writing throughout. Bronson can still be more imaginative than almost every other rapper, but here his idiosyncratic humor, kaleidoscopic use of pop culture references, and culinary fantasies aren’t as consistently gripping or eccentric as they once were. The hook from “Latin Grammys,” for instance, sees Bronson feebly brag about his promiscuity, something he’s done many times before with more inspiration. He still raps about food, but bars like, “Me and my brother go together just like lamb and rice” (“Mongolia”) feel static from a star who once claimed that ginger ale and hot sauce were the two things he lived by. Despite these flaws, Bronson is a captivating personality. Only For Dolphins may not be vintage Bronsolino, but it’s still a display of why so many entities outside of music want a piece of him. Where the artist goes from here is not an unusual question to pose after the release of an album, but in Bronson’s case, it’s reasonable to query whether the recording studio is a destination in the short-to-medium term or whether he’ll instead find that his other interests offer a warmer embrace.","Over a 10-year recording career, the Queens rapper has diversified his bonds and spread himself thin musically. Still, he remains a captivating figure on his most eclectic album yet.

Wuddaji,Theo Parrish,by: Piotr Orlov,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f71f732860c31a7582ca1ea/1:1/w_160/Wuddaji_Theo%20Parrish.png,2020-09-30 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/theo-parrish-wuddaji/,Sound Signature,"There are hard truths to be gained from burst myths. So it was in 2017, when I interviewed the respected Chicago DJ/producer Ron Trent about the birth of “deep house,” a dance-music genre often reduced to a palette of muted rhythms and moody chords. Trent, regarded as one of the sound’s 1990s architects, and one of Theo Parrish’s childhood friends, dismissed deep house’s genre attributes. It was, he told me, “a phrase we used back in the day to describe music that [Chicago house originators] Frankie [Knuckles] and Ronnie [Hardy] were playing. People had this perspective that house music was electronic shit, but that was considered eccentric. The stuff that Ronnie and Frankie were playing was disco and jazz and underground stuff. So we called that deep house.” Trent’s insight unpacks the real-life cultural meaning of a phrase that dance music’s (mostly white) terminologists have diluted with their own projections, accentuating stylistic differences rather than celebrating the related virtues of house, jazz, disco, funk, techno, and other Black musical forms. His factual, broader definition of deep house also serves as an important point of reference for Parrish’s Wuddaji, the Detroit producer’s sixth solo album, on which he updates this original notion of “underground stuff” for 2020. If one of the through lines of Theo’s career has been in setting the record straight—often christened deep-house royalty, he is likely to disregard the epithet as one more example of music-business glad-handing—the other has been to remain true to the spirit of dance music’s origins, even as he steers down rivers of his own choosing. Yet as much as Wuddaji’s dominant aesthetic of Rhodes piano, synths, and percussion may sound familiar, the results plunge into a whole new tributary of club rhythm. Much of Wuddaji feels improvised, as though it had been made up (or at least mixed) on the spot. It’s foolhardy to call these meticulously layered hues “jazz,” even if the interplay between the keys and the mutating swing moves like a kaleidoscopic funk duo session. Yet this “live” energy, in which minimal elements are constantly in conversation with one another—in handcrafted rather than digitally synched detail—is this music’s distinguishing feature. “Radar Detector,” for instance, is built around bass synth and a skittish broken beat; low-end echo ghosts the mix, and a shaker occasionally destabilizes the cadence further. Meanwhile, Rhodes and a right-handed keyboard line sing out short phrases before one begins to squeal deliriously. The mood is forceful, mirroring the forward drive of the title; the track’s internal logic emanates the pure id of Parrish at the controls. “Purple Angry Birds” and “All Your Boys Are Biters” are almost wholly percussive affairs, with every element focused on rhythm. The former features an insistent kick camouflaged by the faintest residue of a snare hit and is pockmarked with electronic tones that might represent the title’s subjects; an elegiac piano arrives about 90 seconds before its 10-plus minutes expire. The latter is simpler yet, a drum-programming flex that could easily be a live, one-take MPC masterpiece. They are Wuddaji’s most “techno” moments, but techno as performed by a drumline. This on-the-fly quality is in keeping with a lot of the recordings Parrish has been involved in since the release of 2014’s exultant American Intelligence. It was there on his four “Gentrified Love” EPs, which featured collaborations with Detroit players who move fluidly and expertly through Black rhythm and improvisation, including trumpeter John Douglas, keyboardist Amp Fiddler and the producer Waajeed, and on his production for a Melbourne soul-jazz quintet featuring keyboardist Silent Jay and the Hiatus Kaiyote rhythm section. Jazz has also been a central element of Parrish’s legendary DJ marathons throughout his career, whether as content (spinning records by everyone from Gil-Scott Heron and Brian Jackson to Incognito to the Black Jazz label) or as form (treating the mixer as his improvisational tool as skillfully as anybody in the game). In lieu of bringing together musicians in a shared space in real time, Wuddaji practices solo improvisations learned partially from those DJ sets—gathering sounds from a long memory, fitting them into a new context. There are times when the interlocking rhythms—programmed drums, percussion samples, percussive audio fabrications—speak in language patterns as though across time. Two notable deviations reinforce Parrish’s commitment to musical representations of Black joy and resilience. From its name on down, “HennyWeed BuckDance” is the set’s most populist party tune, dicing and looping bluesy electric guitar against vamping electric piano and chugging, bass-heavy drums; slinking along at 106 BPM, it is a groove by any other name and a worthy candidate for every history of soul. “This Is for You,” with vocals by co-writer Maurissa Rose, is something else entirely, one of those instantly classic anthems of simultaneous uplift and strength, melancholy and loss, aligning itself not with the actions of exceptionalists but with everyday heroic toil. Its four-chord melody reinforces the repetition of daily struggle, the beat building and building, and Rose’s voice, at times pleading, at others full of graceful fortitude, balances all the ideas embedded inside a life. A single originally released in 2019, “This Is for You” could have easily been a record created for the summer of 2020. But it only seems like Wuddaji was made with our immediate times in mind; Parrish’s vision of Black music exists on a much longer timeline. “I do feel that music coming from the diasporic community, it needs to carry weight,” he said in an interview last year. “Whether that weight is a reflection on the experience. Whether that’s weight in terms of it freeing you from what you have to deal with. Or weight that’s talking about direct lessons about how to survive this shit.” That weight was in the records that Frankie and Ronnie played, and it is here as well. I don’t think you can get any deeper.","As much as the Detroit dance producer’s aesthetic may feel familiar, the improvisatory results plunge into a whole new tributary of club rhythm.

Tickets to My Downfall,Machine Gun Kelly,by: Pete Tosiello,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f71fb776f8c318c82177942/1:1/w_160/tickets%20to%20my%20downfall_machine%20gun%20kelly.jpg,2020-09-30 05:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/machine-gun-kelly-tickets-to-my-downfall/,Interscope,"With his roguish blue-collar image and Hot Topic wardrobe, Machine Gun Kelly always seemed more lightweight than his self-serious rap music suggested. Over the course of four full-lengths and two EPs on Sean Combs’s Bad Boy Records, his audience didn’t grow up with him so much as shuffle listlessly alongside him, waiting for something interesting to happen. Despite flirtations with a more pop-driven sound, he always reverted to moody persecution narratives; he seemed neither aware of nor particularly interested in his place as a white rap star, save for the opportunity it afforded him to squabble with Eminem and make eyes at the elder rapper’s then-teenaged daughter. The motor-mouthed flow which once made Kelly a fixture at Apollo showcases was never in question, but—save for isolated guilty pleasures on 2015’s overblown General Admission and 2017’s schlocky bloom—he never had much to show for it. Turns out, all he ever needed was Travis Barker in his corner. Tickets to My Downfall reboots MGK as an heir to the early-’00s pop-punk canon, with Barker producing and playing drums. Barker’s fingerprints are everywhere: most of the songs clock in under three minutes, replete with three-chord melodies, big hooks, and breakdown bridges, nestled within the same 85-to-110 bpm sweet spot as blink-182’s singles catalog. “concert for aliens” is the most faithful Enema of the State homage, with its extraterrestrial theme, pulsing Hoppus-ian bass track, and four-note guitar solo. MGK’s singing voice, which tended toward reedy when it wasn’t slathered in bloom’s vocal effects, brandishes a snarl that faintly recalls Deryck Whibley’s SoCal-by-way-of-MTV lilt. Even the sugariest pop-punk confections occupy a lineage, one which can’t be donned as easily as a studded belt. But the authenticity equation on a record shaped by turn-of-the-century suburban mall soundtracks is different than the one Kelly’s used to as a rapper. In the way that blink’s smirking skate-punk insolence perfectly captured Clinton-era insouciance, Kelly’s mopier navel-gazing is suggestive of a generational attitude—had he arrived a few years later, it’s easy to imagine him finding his footing in the emo-rap explosion on Soundcloud. Unlike blink’s most recent effort NINE, which tried on a modern, synthetic sound in largely halfhearted fashion, Tickets to My Downfall embraces its source material without hedging its bets. “drunk face” chronicles the same cycle of drugs and heartbreak MGK’s been singing about for years, but in the context of a downtempo earworm it echoes American Hi-Fi more than Hopsin. To his everlasting credit, Kelly finally found both a genre and a producer as brazenly allergic to subtlety as he is. Tickets to My Downfall is a genuine throwback to the post-9/11 gauze of TRL countdowns and Tony Hawk multiplayer. Halsey’s vocals soar on the angsty breakup jam “forget me too,” which might work as a show tune if it didn’t rock so hard. “bloody valentine” is a winningly bittersweet ballad anchored by a sober bassline, whereas the title track is practically operatic—following a dramatic acoustic intro, Barker’s drums lurch between a blistering pre-chorus and a half-time hook. The Iann Dior and blackbear collaborations are laced with light trap drums, making for minor deviations from the template. The blackbear track “my ex’s best friend” is particularly instructive in terms of the fate MGK avoided with his well-timed pivot. A similarly brooding, tattooed Instagram ex-boyfriend, blackbear writes wallowing R&B from the perspective of the perpetually jilted lover; his vengefulness (“Look at this damage you did to me!” he wails on “my ex’s best friend”) makes him a deeply unsympathetic narrator. As recently as last summer’s “FLOOR 13,” Kelly elicited a comparable you’ll-miss-me-when-I’m-gone spite, taunting “Don’t cry at my funeral” like a sophomore who just coughed up his lunch money. Tickets to My Downfall’s finale “play this when i’m gone” shows the same fatalism, but MGK’s concern—crucially—lies with prospective survivors instead of his rivals. “You’re gonna cry, and baby, that’s all right,” Kelly sings over melancholic guitar strums. It’s more theatrical and more compassionate than his barbed journey-into-the-mind rap records: a win-win. In a certain sense, Kelly’s rebirth as a pop-punk revivalist might be the ultimate form of fan service—the aesthetic is far more suitable for his diaristic instincts and Warped Tour following. Thematically, Tickets to My Downfall is hardly a departure from MGK’s past work, but the new surroundings lightens his music up considerably even amidst the hormones and histrionics. With Travis Barker on his side, he might win over skeptics accusing him of trend-hopping, but the best part of Downfall is that he doesn’t take the whole endeavor too seriously.","The motor-mouthed rapper’s latest album reboots him as an heir to the early-’00s pop-punk canon, with Travis Barker producing and playing drums.

Stateless,Tashi Dorji,by: Philip Sherburne,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f72055fffb0eebbb428d085/1:1/w_160/Stateless_Tashi%20Dorji.jpg,2020-09-30 05:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/tashi-dorji-stateless/,Drag City,"Beyond the principle of “first thought, best thought” comes no thought at all. This is the source of improvising guitarist Tashi Dorji’s playing: the realm of pure instinct, a zone of unpremeditated action in which the fingers outpace the brain. “I generally have a theme or form or simple idea and I work from there,” he told The Wire. But that foundation, he said, “changes the moment I start playing.” When Dorji picks up a guitar, it can sometimes feel like everything and nothing is happening at once: A player in the questing, occasionally contrarian mold of guitarists like Derek Bailey and Bill Orcutt, the Bhutanese musician is capable of spiky intensity and lyrical finesse, and the two moods frequently slip back and forth without warning. Any given note might be a trapdoor to the inverse of what has immediately preceded it. Melodies flash out and disintegrate in the space of a few plucks; patterns repeat until they don’t, and everything in the rearview turns to rubble. Dorji’s pursuit of the melodic line resembles a maze-like garden of forking paths, each choice oscillating between possibility and negation. “Improvisation as a practice is always shifting, becoming and disappearing,” he recently wrote. Stateless, his first album for Drag City—his highest-profile release in an 11-year discography that numbers dozens of albums, tapes, collaborations, live recordings, and digital releases—is a fractal firehose of these transformative moments, in which nascence turns to oblivion and vice versa, over and over again. Dorji is a committed disciple of spontaneity. He estimates that he recorded the 54-minute-long Stateless in about an hour and a half, and the only reason it took him that long is that he likes to alter his guitar’s tuning in between takes—a process that is itself as unplanned as his compositions. Born into a musical family—his mother is a flutist, her father was an influential lute player, and his cousin is a famous folk singer—Dorji grew up in the Himalayan Kingdom of Bhutan, where he taught himself to play guitar, soaking up classic rock and heavy metal via shortwave radio and bootleg tapes from India. When he moved to Asheville, North Carolina, for college, he discovered hardcore punk and free improvisation. “Listening to [Derek] Bailey literally changed everything,” he has said. It’s tempting to seek traces of all those experiences in his playing, and it’s true that ghosts of recognizable sounds sometimes flare up—a scrap of flamenco-like strumming, a neatly woven web of American primitive, the arid melancholy of Saharan desert blues or Kenyan “dry” guitar—like a scanning radio dial briefly alighting on a long-forgotten tune. But most often, it seems, what you are hearing is the sound of his mind trying to forget what it knows. Recorded on steel-stringed acoustic guitar, Stateless might not be Dorji’s most dissonant album—that would probably be a 2013 self-titled cassette played on a prepared instrument modified with bits of metal, chopsticks, and Scotch tape, yielding a flinty, buzzing tone—but it’s close. The mood is a long way from 2015’s reverent Appa or 2016’s meditative VDSQ Solo Acoustic Vol. 13: Dorji attacks his strings as though searching for something he dropped in the dirt, by turns agitated and focused. From the very first two notes, the record bristles with tritones—that sharp, stabbing pair of notes that Renaissance scholars once dubbed “the devil’s interval” for its supposedly demonic properties. Stateless isn’t evil, exactly, but it’s unsettling in its restlessness. Where there is repetition, there is seldom consonance; where there is consonance, there is seldom repetition. Dorji worries away at jarring tone clusters as though trying to work out the kinks in a knotted cord; he treats dulcet passages almost apologetically, as though the pretty bits were indulgences to be left in the dust as fast as possible. Dorji professes not to be a technically adept player, a patently ridiculous claim. He has speed, muscle, and grace, as well as the all-important sense of when not to play. Trying to chart the course of these pieces can be like chasing butterflies; recapping them is as futile as recounting the twists and turns of a dream. But moments stand out. “The Swelling Fruit About to Shatter the Husk of the Old World” is a gentle, plainspoken highlight of major sevenths and Fahey-esque fingerpicking, clanging accidentals sticking out like burrs in spun silk, and there’s a similarly gorgeous passage of classical guitar in “Statues Crumble, Heroes Fall,” where stately bass melody moves against a shimmering mist of blurred notes. Early on, “End of State (Pt. 1)” erupts into sour-tuned “La Cucaracha” riffs, evoking car horns in gridlock before turning contemplative halfway through. Dorji typically retunes his guitar in between the various movements of his multi-part pieces, and “End of State (Pt. 2)” coaxes unusual frequencies from its altered tuning, while the opening of “End of State (Pt. 3)” glows and skips like a scratched Sonic Youth record. The final two and a half minutes of “Now (Pt. 1)” he spends hammering at a single open fifth, stretching the edges of the notes with every downstroke; the effect resembles doom metal, though there’s also a hint of Tibetan monks’ throat singing in its ragged overtones. Dorji chose the album’s title, he told Aquarium Drunkard, while thinking about social structures that lie beyond the boundaries of the traditional nation-state. “I’m looking at it more from an anarchist’s perspective,” he said. This notion of statelessness—what he calls “a fluid, horizontal idea”—is a vision of freedom, one akin to his idea of improvisation as a non-hierarchical value system, an unfettered way of being in the world. Among the album’s inspirations, Dorji cites the anarchist text As Black as Resistance: Finding the Conditions for Liberation, the anti-imperialist 1966 documentary The Battle of Algiers, and Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak’s classic work of postcolonialist theory, “Can the Subaltern Speak?” In the wake of the Black Lives Matter protests of the spring and summer, the title “Statues Crumble, Heroes Fall” appears remarkably prescient; even without lyrics, it is clear that Stateless is a kind of protest record. I keep thinking about all those tritones, the rickety pillars propping up the album’s canopy. Subtle as fire alarms, tritones have the effect that they do because they strike a tension that refuses to resolve. They are neither major, minor, nor a perfect fifth. Tritones disconcert because they signal rootlessness, restlessness, instability; they represent a state of affairs that cannot hold. Dorji recorded Stateless before the various upheavals of 2020, but the album anticipates the year’s mood: restive, anxious, sometimes antagonistic, and above all, searching. Beneath its rockslides of wrong notes lies the conviction that a different kind of order is possible. Dorji’s other albums may be more soothing or more conventionally beautiful, but none feel better suited to the exigencies of the present moment than this one.","The improvising guitarist’s first album for Drag City is restless and unsettling. Building on his idea of improvisation as a non-hierarchical value system, it is also a kind of protest record.

Whether with her noise duo Body/Head or the stylized future-punk of last year’s No Home Record, Kim Gordon has eagerly played the experimental jet-setter, while Lee Ranaldo has embraced his standing as Sonic Youth’s resident beatnik on his wistfully melodic and psychedelic solo outings. But for those fans who just want the jams to run free forevermore, we have an impressive string of albums from Thurston Moore that essentially amount to Sonic Youth on steroids, reimagining the group as the sort of fearsome, festival-rockin’ workhorse that could theoretically lay waste to crowds at both Bonnaroo and Unsound with equal aplomb. Moore’s new record, By the Fire, features the same core engine (guitarist James Sedwards and My Bloody Valentine bassist Debbie Googe) that powered his previous rock-oriented releases, 2014’s The Best Day and 2017’s Rock n Roll Consciousness. It also brings back two contributors (Negativland electronics expert Jon Leidecker and drummer Jem Doulton) that helped produce the mammoth, 63-minute “Alice Moki Jayne” movement from last year’s 3xLP collection of improvised instrumentals, Spirit Counsel. But where Moore typically files his avant-garde excursions outside his official discography, By the Fire mirrors the typography and spartan cover design of Spirit Counsel, suggesting a renewed dialogue between Moore’s experimental and accessible sides. The relationship between the two releases is analogous to that of Sonic Youth’s 1998 epic A Thousand Leaves and the concurrent series of free-form EPs they released on their SYR imprint, elements of which were refined into proper songs on the former. (In fact, By the Fire’s opener, “Hashish,” is essentially a more sinewy revamp of A Thousand Leaves’ “Sunday.”) While By the Fire doesn’t explicitly reference Spirit Counsel in the same way, it provides a more concise distillation of the same methodology—i.e., using apocalyptic noise to achieve an ecstatic peace, while reminding us that the punks and the hippies were always on the same side. Of course, in this case, “concise” is a relative term—By the Fire still runs as long as most feature films, hovering just below the 90-minute mark. But it’s a record that justifies and even demands the extra space to explore; Moore and co. take their sweet time to sculpt squalls into riffs and lure extended meditations into melodic focus, like a roving crosshair that finally locks on its target. Moore’s first verse on “Siren” doesn’t surface until we’re three-quarters of the way into its 12-minute runtime, but the song’s gorgeous circular guitar pattern, which imagines Television transplanted from the East Village to the West Coast, makes it easy to sit back and savor the journey. “Locomotives” is even longer—and a much more forbidding prospect, with its extended death-cult procession of dissonance—but it too blossoms into something wondrous. “We are here, we come in peace,” Moore gushes as the song hits its strut, confirming that noise isn’t a mere aesthetic device on By the Fire but a narrative one too, representing the dark forces in the world that can be extinguished by the radiance of positive energy. Like its song-focused predecessors, By the Fire once again features lyrical contributions credited to Radieux Radio, a mysterious London-based poet whose online presence just so happens to be limited to name-drops in Moore-related press. But whether Radieux Radio is an actual muse or elaborate ruse (or both), their partnership has invested Moore’s work with a more passionate perspective that gives his shape-shifting songs a clear ideological throughline. Where Moore spent his preceding records drifting between the personal and the spiritual, By the Fire is more firmly rooted in the political, though not in an obvious, “Yeah the president sucks/He’s a war-pig fuck,” kinda way. Rather, its songs suggest that peace is not passivity, and love is not sentimentality—they’re powerful yet perpetually under-siege forces that must be defended at all times, especially now. Moore and his group bring heavy artillery to the battlefield. Though he has made plenty of psychedelic music, “Cantaloupe” is the closest he’s ever gotten to the sludge of pure stoner rock, as he rewrites the Book of Genesis into a call to arms for electric warriors everywhere: “On the second day/We drew streaks/Of lightning on your Tele.” Where Moore and Sedwards’ lacerating squall provides the frontline offensive on “Breath,” the rhythm section drives the armada forward with motorik propulsion, with Googe keeping her bass set to “You Made Me Realise” levels of griminess. Even when Moore strips back to just guitar and bass on “Calligraphy,” the album’s energy level doesn’t waver; his tense, tactile strums judder with Velvets-esque verve. By the Fire is evenly divided between double-digit excursions and more compact rock songs, but its emotional climax, “They Believe in Love (When They Look at You)” hovers somewhere in the middle, rendering the eternal struggle between good and evil as a seven-minute cage match. As Moore writes in the liners, it’s “obviously a love song,” but one that announces itself with a menacing backbeat, needling guitar pricks, and nauseating ray-gun squeals. Dressing up its terms of endearment in ominous clamor, the song evokes the classic Sonic Youth chiller “I Love Her All the Time,” updating its “she’s on my side” refrain for more perilous times: “Where do we go after long goodbyes/Heart torn up when we’re not side by side.” Rather than surrender to doom, Moore keeps fighting for the light, transforming the track into a love song for love itself: “It's a profound wonder,” he sings, “a revolution, a truth!” At a time when the politics of hate sometimes feel like they are pushing the world to its breaking point, By the Fire posits that love constitutes its own act of radicalism.","Refining the sound of last year’s sprawling Spirit Counsel into more focused riffs and songs, By the Fire suggests a renewed dialogue between Moore’s experimental instincts and his desire to rock.

Sundry Rock Song Stock,Yves Jarvis,by: Andy Cush,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f71f3299c52ebb23ff66513/1:1/w_160/Sundry%20Rock%20Song%20Stock_yves%20jarvis.jpg,2020-09-29 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/yves-jarvis-sundry-rock-song-stock/,Anti-Flemish Eye,"Across Sundry Rock Song Stock, Yves Jarvis’ voice rarely if ever appears alone. The 23-year-old psych-pop auteur almost always layers his vocal takes, appearing in double, triple, sextuple, nonuple, it’s hard to say. These are not immaculate choir-of-one harmonies in the mold of Brian Wilson, but slurry, unpredictable masses, drifting in and out of verbal intelligibility and strict meter, clinging like kudzu to the trunks and branches of the songs they populate. Despite their multifarious abundance and the breezy amiability of the musical settings, these voices do not give Sundry Rock Song Stock the feeling of a communal affair. Instead, they suggest that Jarvis—who performed every instrument on the album, mixed it, and painted the fractured self-portrait on the cover—is expressing something deeply solitary, an overgrown world of the mind that we are invited to visit for the length of 10 brief songs before moving on. Sundry Rock Song Stock is presented as Jarvis’ third album, but the truth is a bit more complicated. Born Jean-Sebastian Audet and raised between Montreal and Calgary, he began street busking in his pre-teens, and releasing self-recorded albums under the name Un Blonde a few years later. On 2014’s Tenet, the first Un Blonde album, Audet sometimes channeled the icy post-punk guitar work of Calgary hometown heroes Women; by 2016’s Good Will Come to You, the last one, he’d arrived at a version of the sensibility he continues to explore today. (Judging by the positioning of Sundry Rock Song Stock as the third Yves Jarvis album, Audet now seems to view Good Will Come to You as the project’s debut.) The album applied post-punk’s deconstructive impulse to the warmhearted sounds of 1970s R&B, folk-rock, and gospel; one 30-second song consists of a single lyric—“I’ve been on my grind so long, it’s hard to know just who I am anymore”—delivered via the rich and mournful sound of a Black church choir, while a lo-fi recording of children playing runs in the background. Naturally, Jarvis sang all the parts himself. Sundry Rock Song Stock packs a remarkable variety of sounds into its 33 minutes, opening with the percolating cymbals and chime-like Rhodes patterns of Miles Davis circa In a Silent Way and closing with a whispery doo-wop devotional, always dissolving into a pool of bioluminescent synth ambiance or erupting into a racket of clattering samples just as you expect it to gear up for the next chorus. Still, the album retains a sense of holism, refining the collagelike quality of Good Will Come to You and its somber follow-up, last year’s The Same but by Different Means, by foregrounding Jarvis’s softly strummed acoustic guitar and committing thoroughly to his singular vocal approach. At times, Sundry Rock Song Stock recalls the hallucinatory hymns of David Crosby’s If I Could Only Remember My Name or Animal Collective’s Sung Tongs, with the freewheeling ensemble nature of those albums replaced by Jarvis’ painterly top-down vision. In Jarvis’ vocal arrangements, one version of a particular word or note might slightly outlast another that happens at essentially the same time, creating an uncanny sense of permeability at the borders of the whole. Occasionally, a line emerges with piercing clarity for a few words before plunging back into the tangled vines, as when Jarvis describes himself as “A victim of/the same old stuff/my father was” on “Victim.” His delivery is striking in its languor and offhandedness, a casual reminder of the cold reality that lies just beyond the daydream. “Notch in Your Belt” and “For Props” both seem to address people who align themselves with struggles against oppression for superficial reasons. “Your earned fortune makes you depraved/You can’t empathize or reciprocate/I’m sure your heart’s in the right place/But that’s the way it comes across, like you’re pandering for props,” he sings on the latter, the album’s biggest and brightest song. Plenty of albums are described as dreamy for the way they drape otherwise conventional songs in pillowy textures and arrangements; Jarvis is the rare songwriter who also follows the logic of dreams within the structures of his compositions. “Epitome,” Sundry Rock Song Stock’s opening track, collapses on itself soon after Jarvis delivers one of the album’s most rousing melodies, never to be repeated. “In Every Mountain,” the following track, builds patiently toward a majestic windswept vista, then falls almost immediately back to the bottom of the hill, and begins the process again, and again, and then it’s over. “Emerald” subjects its own sweetly ascending melody to disorienting reharmonizations as it fades out, like viewing the tune through a kaleidoscope. The effect of these misdirections is often wondrous, but they can also give the sense of the album retreating from its own pleasures. Jarvis has said that he sees himself as a producer primarily, and cited the influence of prog rock bands like Yes and King Crimson on Sundry Rock Song Stock, for the way their music is “not really songwriting,” but more like “a room that you can walk into and then out of.” If Sundry Rock Song Stock falls just short of being a masterwork, it’s because Jarvis occasionally seems to undermine his own songwriting ability—evident in the quiet compositional heft of “For Props,” “Victim,” and “Semula”—avoiding traditional development in favor of tugging you from one hallucinatory tableau to the next. But such a critique feels practically beside the point for an album so profusely inventive, so alive to the possibilities of sound itself.","On his latest album, the Canadian psych-pop auteur expresses something deeply solitary in his music, a textured and overgrown world of the mind.

Full Wack No Brakes,Bad Boy Chiller Crew,by: Will Pritchard,Contributor ,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f71ef1e9c52ebb23ff6650f/1:1/w_160/full%20wack%20no%20brakes_bad%20boy%20chiller%20crew.jpg,2020-09-29 05:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/bad-boy-chiller-crew-full-wack-no-brakes/,House Anxiety,"You get about 15 seconds to do some deep breathing exercises (or huff a thick line) before Full Wack No Brakes launches into full force. Opener “450 - 2020 Mix” is a high-octane ode to dirtbikes, petty robberies, and living large, and it sets the tone for what’s to come: a blistering dose of big grins, bassline, and organ house. It’s dance music at its most juiced and jacked up. And it’s amazing. BBCC comprises MCs Kane, Clive, and GK, along with a loose raft of regular collaborators that includes S-Dog, PC Bill Bacon, and the group’s manager Dr. Google. They hail from Bradford, a city in the north of England, and have risen to hyper-local fame off the back of viral videos that include chaotic comedy sketches and downing inhuman amounts of booze through traffic cones. They’ve soundtracked ads for diners and car washes. Promo for the second single from Full Wack No Brakes, a thumping club anthem titled “Guns Up,” involved seeing which of the crew could endure the most pops from a paintball gun. Earlier this month, they caught the ear of the UK’s original pop-star bad boy, Robbie Williams. Dr. Google says he’s lining up a collab. The crew exist on the fringes of an overlooked bassline scene that, since emerging from northern hotspots in Sheffield, Leeds, Huddersfield, and Bradford in the early ’00s, has wobbled along on its own steady path. While celebrating occasional forays into the charts—T2’s “Heartbroken” in 2007, or DJ Q’s “You Wot!” the following year—the sound has largely been left to develop alone. Bills stacked with acts like Notion, Deadbeat, Skepsis, Holy Goof, Bassboy, and Mr V would, pre-COVID, regularly pack out raves under the nose of the UK’s music media. BBCC’s first mixtape, titled Git Up Mush, was sold direct to fans and stocked in vape shops and convenience stores. But while bassline’s most recent iterations have been typified by an aggressive, crunchy mid-range sound that’s closer to jump-up dubstep and drum ‘n’ bass, BBCC’s up-tempo blend of rumbling low-end and silky, pitched-up female vocals has more in common with the canonical MC-led sounds that once incubated in Sheffield’s Niche nightclub or Sheridan’s in Dewsbury. The beats here are lean and precision-engineered, like the Ducatis and Husqvarnas that pepper the lyrics. The group’s comic edge and old-school styling have brought comparisons to People Just Do Nothing’s hapless Kurupt FM crew. But the likeness is a shallow one. While Kurupt FM score laughs skewering the characters that typify aging underground scenes in the UK, BBCC are no parody act. As ambassadors for their own northern working-class culture, they’re strikingly authentic. They make bangers, too. “Active” is bouncy xylophone 2-step; “New Machine” goes four-to-the-floor with a fairground ride riff; “Loco” is a purist organ house pumper. They switch flows and wrap syllables around the catchiest choruses this side of the pop charts. It’s a tonic to the po-faced tendencies of Business Techno, or the chin-stroke posturing of artsy metropolitan club scenes. A reminder that raving is, ultimately, about getting loaded and letting loose. Like the best nights out, Full Wack No Brakes passes by in a blur. The next day you piece it together from hazy recollections and suspect video clips—before pulling out the traffic cone and cracking a fresh six-pack, ready to go again.","The northern England crew specializes in dance music at its most juiced and jacked up.

Daughter,Lydia Loveless,by: Alfred Soto,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f71f12bae13ed5d50f90f64/1:1/w_160/daughter_lydia%20loveless.jpg,2020-09-29 05:00:00,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/lydia-loveless-daughter/,"Honey, You're Gonna Be Late","Ambition sharpens Lydia Loveless’s songwriting. When she boasts, “I am on the verge of brilliance,” on “Don’t Bother Mountain,” she follows it with, “or on the verge of death.” On her fifth and best full-length album, Daughter, the Ohio singer-songwriter masters a music that follows the contours of her electric guitar playing: rangy and gnarled. It’s tempting to think of Jason Isbell and Patty Loveless (no relation) as confreres, but the scrappy rock’n’roll of her earlier albums and the absence of self-pity moves her closer to Scarecrow-era John Mellencamp or mid-period Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers. Falling out of love with jerks, hitting the bottle hoping it doesn’t hit back, Loveless positions herself not as a survivor but a fighter. She expects tough times and no breaks, not even from herself. Loveless’s instrumental commitment makes the difference on Daughter, urging the material onward with her piano and synth. She also plays bass on a few tracks, filling in for Ben Lamb, whom she divorced around the time she released 2016’s Real. She and guitarist Todd May merge into the kind of unit whose filigrees tickle and surprise. The jangle of “Love Is Not Enough” complements a lyric about accepting romantic devastation; she pulls one way and the cheerful arrangement goes another. Even better is “Wringer,” an exercise in finding delightful rhymes for the title that seems to take a cue from Loveless and May’s call-and-response riffing. Switching to bass, May and drummer George Hondroulis work up a lissome groove for “Never,” home of the bumper sticker manifesto, “I’m not a liberated woman/Just a country bumpkin dilettante.” Had a country singer tackled “Never,” the wink would be seen from here to Appalachia. Loveless, though, rarely kids. Blessed with a high, seared, unpretty voice that suggests hard living, Loveless inhabits these characters free of the affect that, say, Lucinda Williams leans on for her truth. If Daughter is her best album, then the title track is her best song. With Hondroulis punching each verse, Loveless asks her lover, “If I gave you a daughter, would you open up?” And: “Why can’t I show you another side of me?” They’re trenchant questions, not because she doesn’t know the answer, but because she knows too well and prefers interrogation to admissions. Connecting self-worth to the health of a relationship, and to success as a mother, is a phenomenon no less grim than when Loretta Lynn described an exhausted Kansas housewife in “One’s on the Way” almost 50 years ago. Perhaps grimmer—songwriting, like therapy, has its limits. Loveless understands. With a sober approach to its less-than-sober characters, Daughter takes life one song at a time. She can’t do more but prepare to accept less.","On her fifth and best full-length album, the Ohio singer-songwriter follows the rangy contours of her electric guitar playing with heartbreak stories and searching questions.

Ultra Mono,IDLES,by: Jazz Monroe,Associate Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f6ce8e1ffb0eebbb428ceff/1:1/w_160/ultra%20mono_idles.jpg,2020-09-28 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/idles-ultra-mono/,Partisan,"At the onset of lockdown, as busy lives drained away only to be refilled with ennui and baking, Zadie Smith wrote this adage: “The people sometimes demand change. They almost never demand art.” Before the pandemic, society offered a tacit contract whereby artists, and few others, could essentially act like children: painting flowers, blowing into flutes, storyboarding plots where lurid men meet their comeuppance, yelling “A heathen! From Eton! On a bag of Michael Keaton!” into microphones—anything that might elicit joy or clarity in the general populace. Some art, Smith conceded, has political potential, but artistic urgency is nearly always a metaphor, borrowed from “the urgency of the guerilla’s demands, or the activist’s protests.” Essential workers are necessary. Art is more like baking a sourdough loaf: something to do with our long days. Smith articulates a common misgiving about Necessary Art—one that bodes poorly for Ultra Mono, wherein Idles stage a risky foray into the form. The Bristol post-punks’ 2017 debut, Brutalism, and follow-up Joy as an Act of Resistance flirted with necessity but preferred irreverence, populating songs of Brexit Britain with cocaine connoisseurs and the far-right ghouls haunting Westminster halls. Any necessity in the music seemed, as it should, to occur by accident. With Ultra Mono, Idles trump up the social values while continuing to occupy a peculiar British tradition: ornery blokes from outside the capital charismatically proclaiming moral truths in a tone that suggests they could also annihilate you in a bar fight. (This thing goes over particularly well at festivals.) Such groups embody the infinite promise of working-class rage—never mind their actual background—which can feel refreshing, since British class commentary rarely rises above vague talk of metropolitan elites and “ordinary voters.” In a war of subtext, we appreciate those brave or stupid enough to carry a megaphone. The thrills and perils of flouting this social contract play out on Ultra Mono centerpiece “Model Village,” where shouter-songwriter Joe Talbot rails against a fictional village’s latent fascism, provincialist racism, tabloid-fuelled alarmism, and other moronic English values. In the process, he characterizes his villagers as “half-pint thugs” and “nine-fingered boys,” which inevitably feels a bit patronizing. Still, his willingness to slip into class stereotypes clarifies Idles’ political position: charitably as a conduit for proletarian anger, but primarily as a vent for the sort of leftists who can’t decide whether to valorize the working class or furiously condemn it for the calamities of Brexit and Boris Johnson. Ultra Mono oscillates between the spry minimalism of “Model Village”—which bridges macho punk and, say, the Hives—and brawnier screeds aping Mclusky, albeit without the Welsh greats’ absurdism. The Jesus Lizard’s David Yow, Bad Seed Warren Ellis, and, improbably, Kenny Beats all make fairly anonymous contributions, presumably brought in to jolt the band from a creative rut. Throughout the record, promising flickers of invention—jittery electronics here, an elephantine squeal there—invariably leak into choruses built on mechanical, double-time strumming, with Talbot roaring indignantly over the top. For a man wracked with moral outrage, Talbot sounds strangely unfocused, his characters now hollow composites and his lyrics stalled in an interzone between winking cliché and gibberish. “Clack clack clack-a-clang-clang/That’s the sound of a gun going bang bang,” he barks on “War,” with none of the astronomical flamboyance that might redeem such a line. Side B’s duskier sounds demand at least a moderately unhinged vocal presence, but Talbot is ruthless only in his efficiency. On the shoutalong “Carcinogenic,” he drones through a policy checklist—austerity, food banks, military spending, climate crisis—as if cramming for a job interview in the civil service. “Ne Touche Pas Moi” almost works as riot grrrl pastiche, until the appearance of Savages’ Jehnny Beth reminds us her own group would sooner dance the Macarena than serve threats as feeble as “This is a pistol/For the wolf whistle.” Just as Talbot’s jabs at haters feel whiny, his declarations of solidarity, while sincere, often sound braggy. “[You’re] saying my race and class ain’t suitable,” he hollers on “Grounds.” “So I raise my pink fist and say, ‘Black is beautiful.’” Where to begin? Well, unlike civil rights matters, which demand allyship, the “Black is beautiful” movement does not seek white validation—in fact, the white gaze is exactly what it resists. To weaponize the term in this way is not a grave misstep, but it’s the sort of clumsiness that makes Idles’ good intentions feel squeamish. Rather than plucking pretty mantras from a hat, authentic provocateurs mine injustice until they strike unpalatable truths. These may, through some magic hatch, lead to Necessary Art. Either way, I’m not sure Idles have the patience for it. “Model Village” is the one genuine provocation on a record that could otherwise have outsourced its politics to a woke publicity firm. On “The Lover,” Talbot defends Idles’ “sloganeering,” but instead of heeding the social media-era’s abundance of edifying slogans (“The system cannot reform itself”; “Every billionaire is a policy failure”), Ultra Mono charges into the discourse like a hobbyist at a rally. It’s not listening, just shouting. Not radical but restless. Not bad, just unnecessary.","The Bristol punk band’s third album goes for fist-in-the-air righteousness but stumbles over itself at nearly every turn, resulting in a broad and unfocused attempt to speak to the moment.

ACR Loco,A Certain Ratio,by: Robert Ham,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f6cd758860c31a7582ca09c/1:1/w_160/a%20certain%20ratio_acr%20loco.jpg,2020-09-28 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/a-certain-ratio-acr-loco/,Mute,"Since releasing their ninth studio album Mind Made Up in 2008, Manchester mainstays A Certain Ratio have been taking stock of their history and settling themselves comfortably in the present. Last year’s ACR: BOX tracked their evolution from the icy post-punk of their 1979 debut 7"" to a rhythmically expansive sound informed by R&B, go-go, and acid house; meanwhile, a series of commissions from artists like Maps and ShadowParty had them reworking contemporary songs according to their own funky, minimalistic vision.  Apparently fired up by their archival and studio work, the band recorded ACR Loco, their first collection of new songs in 12 years. The album distills A Certain Ratio’s 40-year legacy, potently if imperfectly, while also bending modern beat-heavy music to their collective will. ACR Loco is built on the taut yet fluid rhythms of A Certain Ratio’s core trio—drummer Donald Johnson, bassist/vocalist Jez Kerr, and multi-instrumentalist Martin Moscrop—and spins off variously into motorik disco (“Berlin”), clattering samba-meets-electro (“Taxi Guy”), and gooey jazz-funk (“Get A Grip”). The otherwise tranquil opener “Friends Around Us” slides into a drum’n’bass breakdown for its final minutes, and the low vocal tones and disco bridge of “Supafreak” sound like the band has spent time with Hot Chip’s catalog.  ACR Loco’s embrace of both modern and present is exemplified on its guest list, which features old Mancunian friends like Smiths drummer Mike Joyce as well as current names like Gabe Gurnsey of Factory Floor. Each of them makes adjustments to assimilate into ACR’s essential chemistry. When Maria Uzor of the synth-pop duo Sink Ya Teeth appears on “Get a Grip,” she eschews the cool remove of her own work for a more combustible approach, in keeping with the music’s roiling energy.  Singer and ACR touring member Denise Johnson is the only contributor who exerts her own gravitational pull on the trio—as she has since her first appearance on 1990’s acr:mcr, bursting through the baggy funk of “Be What You Wanna Be” with a towering melody. Her earthy tones sell the rather lightweight message of unity on “Family” (“Brothers and sisters/We are family/One world united/Love, peace, harmony”) and provide human counterweight to a robotic vocoder on the silly “Bouncy Bouncy.” Sadly, ACR Loco was the band’s final collaboration with Johnson before her death at 56 in July. She appears on only four tracks on ACR Loco, and makes a deep impression each time. Several songs seem to address the state of post-Brexit England, the album’s only modern preoccupation that feels awkward or strained. A Certain Ratio have never been the strongest lyricists, but ACR Loco’s calls for togetherness and resistance are especially flimsy. The punky bluntness of a line like “We all need to come together to fight/Fight greed/They’re inventing pain/For short term gain” loses its efficacy when paired with the limber go-go (and goofy title) of “Bouncy Bouncy.” Opener “Friends Around Us” centers on an unsteady proclamation: “We have no idea our meaning without friends around us.” ACR fare better when Kerr is singing to a loved one or, on “Get A Grip,” giving something like a dispatch from a psychedelic trip. The occasional clumsiness of ACR Loco is easy to forgive in light of the album’s musical pleasures. After a deep dive into their back pages, A Certain Ratio found a powerful formula: paying heed to where they came from while keeping the door open for more all night parties in their future. ","On their first new album in over a decade, Manchester’s funkiest post-punk band offer an imperfect distillation of their 40-year legacy, updating their classic sound with nods to contemporary beat-driven music and political strife.

Hyper Romance,Jadu Heart,by: Aimee Cliff,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f6ce4750b3ce3287e37a7d2/1:1/w_160/hyper%20romance_jadu%20heart.jpg,2020-09-28 05:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/jadu-heart-hyper-romance/,VLF,"We’ve met Jadu Heart before, but in a sense, their second album is a chance to meet them anew. On their 2016 EP Wanderflower and 2019 debut Melt Away, the duo of Diva Jeffrey and Alex Headford wore 3D-printed masks, adopted elaborate mythologised characters named Dina and Faro, and couched their electronic pop experiments in a fantastical backstory. Like their identities, their sound was polymorphous, shifting between ukelele folk and choppy electronics in the vein of Maggie Rogers or Mura Masa (with whom they share a manager). One year on, follow-up Hyper Romance feels like a re-introduction to the band, who have ditched the masks and settled into a steadier groove. The newfound simplicity suits them. Jeffrey and Headford made Hyper Romance after moving away from the bustle of London to the port city of Bristol. Holed up in a basement studio, they used distortion pedals and cheap amps to create the layer of atmospheric grunge that hangs over the record (which was later co-produced by Guy Sigsworth, noted for his work with Björk and Madonna). “Suddenly I Know Who You Are” is built around a swaggering Britpop riff, while the ghost of Tame Impala appears in the faintly psychedelic rush of “Metal Violets,” and the blurred edges of “Dead, Again” feel an homage to The Bends-era Radiohead. On each of these songs, Jeffrey and Headford’s vocals intertwine seamlessly, the contours of their voices fitting into one another so well that it’s sometimes hard to tell where one ends and the other begins. It’s these more spectral and sensitive moments, the ones hiding behind the crunching guitars, that are the record’s most powerful. The dusky ballad “Caroline” is tailor-made for the montage that comes three-quarters of the way through an indie rom-com, when the protagonist’s life has fallen apart. Nothing on the album quite tops “Burning Hour,” a smoky blend of live drums, tentative falsetto vocals, guitar shimmers, and—piercing through the haze, before things get too comfortable—samples of screams. It’s a refinement of the laid-back yet eerie electronic sound that flickered through the more disjointed Melt Away, with a pining chorus that sticks. On Hyper Romance, Jadu Heart sound like they’ve found their voice—if not yet something significant to say. The points of reference for their songwriting shine so brightly that at times it threatens to overwhelm them, as with the Thom Yorke moment at the end of “Day by Day,” and their lyrics exhibit the same problems as on their first LP, which often relied heavily on rhyme and cliché. Despite the occasional striking line or memorable hook—like the disarming honesty of “I heard your friend call me a pig” on the prickly romantic duet “Walk the Line”—many images in these songs are ones you’ve seen before. Take this uninspiring couplet from “Caroline”: “A rolling stone, whose moss has grown and grown/A broken home, no love lives here no more.” Towards the end of the record, on the title track, the band sample Streetwise, the 1984 documentary about homeless youth living in Seattle. While the emotive snippets work well within the whorl of warm synth notes and metallic found sound, the overall effect is one of nostalgia for its own sake. The film is a familiar sample, used by bands including the Avalanches and How to Dress Well in the past, and the question of how its tragic mutterings pertain to this record from a Bristol-based psych-pop duo goes unanswered. Though they’ve removed their literal masks, there’s still a sense that Jadu Heart are trying on different costumes, trying to figure out which one captures who they really are.","As they shed their masks and streamline their sound, the UK psych-pop duo sound like they’ve found their voice but not yet something significant to say.

All Thoughts Fly,Anna von Hausswolff,by: Chris O'Connell,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f6cd8e83d8019e558786ab3/1:1/w_160/all%20thoughts%20fly_anna%20von%20hausswolf.jpg,2020-09-28 05:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/anna-von-hausswolff-all-thoughts-fly/,Southern Lord,"In the 16th century, the Italian arts patron Pier Francesco Orsini commissioned a statuary park in the town of Bomarzo as he was mourning the death of his wife. Sacro Bosco, dedicated in her memory, features a collection of stone monsters, including the Roman underworld god Orcus, his eyes wide and mouth open in terror. The park’s haunting beauty captivated the Swedish musician Anna von Hausswolff, whose fifth album, All Thoughts Fly, is titled after an inscription on the Orcus statue’s mouth. Unlike her song-based previous albums, All Thoughts Fly is instrumental, performed entirely on pipe organ. Its lush soundscapes find transcendence in the eerie and the sorrowful, much like Sacro Bosco itself.  The pipe organ has been an important element in von Hausswolff’s gothic pop across four previous albums, which sometimes sounded like the fantasy all-star band Kate Bush and the Bad Seeds. “The Marble Eye,” a lone solo organ piece from 2018’s Dead Magic, now sounds like a test run for All Thoughts Fly, which surrounds the listener with the organ’s funereal tone. Von Hausswolff recorded it in a church in her Gothenburg hometown, on a painstaking replica of a baroque-era instrument. Her dissonant drones, flurrying melodies, and uncanny, almost electronic-sounding effects guide listeners on a bleak ambient journey through an abandoned castle at dusk.  Von Hausswolff uses the organ’s full expressive range, exploring new sides of the instrument on each song without ever disrupting All Thoughts Fly’s essential solemnity. “Persefone,” a simple dirge, sounds like Stars of the Lid performing at a funeral procession. The title track allows some light to come in, using repeated overlapping rhythmic figures to create a dreamlike land akin to Terry Riley’s minimalist classic A Rainbow in Curved Air. When it finally ends, 12-plus minutes in, it feels like coming out on the other side of a crying fit: pure release. On “Sacro Bosco,” von Hausswolff recreates Orsini’s garden with her instrument. High notes wail of impending doom, while a low growl seems to signify Orcus’ voice, outlasting the song’s ornate textures just as the statue has endured through centuries. It’s the heaviest moment on an undeniably heavy album—one that that fits right in with the metal-oriented catalog of Southern Lord Records, despite little resemblance to labelmates like Power Trip and Sleep.  The voiceless hymns of All Thoughts Fly don’t leave you longing for the singing of von Hausswolff’s previous albums. No turn of phrase could match the tension she creates with the call-and-response buildup of “Theatre of Nature,” as her melodies converse heatedly with each other. She allows the organ to sing for itself: songs of love and loss, decay and eternal life.","The Swedish composer sidelines the gothic pop of previous releases in favor of lush and sorrowful wordless soundscapes, performed entirely on the pipe organ of a local church.

21,Adele,by: Dani Blum ,Contributor ,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f68eefe537682947f0938d8/1:1/w_160/21_adele.jpg,2020-09-27 05:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/adele-21/,XLColumbia,"The green room was full of Adeles, nails all long and painted, hairdos puffed into the singer’s signature beehive. The BBC had corralled a cluster of impersonators into an experiment; they thought they were at an audition. But the real Adele was among them, disguised, plastered in a fake nose and chin, joining in on their jokes about how long it was taking her to release a new album. It was 2015, and for years, Adele had been everywhere. Signed to the British label XL at age 18, after a track her friend uploaded to MySpace gained attention, she released her debut album, 19, two years after graduating from the lauded BRIT School. It went triple platinum in the U.S. and catalyzed an almost feverish mass adoration. She pouted on the cover of Vogue, she belted on SNL, she swept the Grammys, she soundtracked James Bond. Adele never seemed to cast herself as an archetypal pop star—in interviews, she was giggly and crass, and often deployed what critics and fans called a “cackle.” In one of the few declarations of her pop supremacy, she held out on releasing her 2015 album, 25, to streaming services, a move then only wielded by artists like Beyoncé and Taylor Swift. The gamble worked: People bought her physical records in droves, with such a fervor that some thought maybe Adele had single-handedly saved the industry. While her first album garnered Adele international attention, her 2011 follow-up, 21 catapulted her into the Guinness Book of World Records—21 is reportedly the longest-running No. 1 album by a female solo artist in the history of U.S. and UK charts. The album cemented her legacy as an artist who could make once-in-a-generation milestones out of her music. 21 is filled with colossal songs, elegant and glistening, bending but never breaking under the heft of Adele’s voice, which sounds like Amy Winehouse mashed with opera. (Adele said that she owed “90%” of her career to Amy Winehouse, before a concert on what would have been Winehouse’s 33rd birthday.) Beyond the similarities to Winehouse, though—the gritty, growled vocals that could stretch into big belted notes, often over jazzy piano—Adele seemed like a pop star flung out of social or temporal context. She swirled together soul and pop and jazz; Adele said she turned to country while writing the record. She revered Etta James as a kid. The first concert she went to was the Cure, with her mom, and her cover of “Lovesong” on 21 quivers and crawls, hovers above a scratch, one of the more subdued tracks on the album. “She takes you to places other artists don’t go to anymore—the way they did in the 70s,” Beyoncé said about her. Adele crafted her songs intentionally to be timeless—“I want to sing these songs when I’m 70 fuckin’ years old,” she told Vanity Fair. Maybe too much credit has been given to Adele for ushering in a resurgence of the ballad—Bruno Mars’ grating “Grenade” had been climbing the charts around the same time—but there was something baffling about hearing her on the radio slotted between the hyperactive neon rush of the Black Eyed Peas and Katy Perry. A year before 21, Kesha released her glitter torpedo of an album full of breakups, blackouts, and tirades over texts. The trope of slickly calibrated female self-destruction, almost always conveyed through performative partying, would radiate throughout pop over the next decade, but never breach Adele’s songs. This is also what differentiated her from Winehouse: on 21 especially, she is desperate to tear down so much, but always protects herself. 21 isn’t exactly a concept album, but it collects the songs Adele wrote at that age, centering around the dissolution of what she would call a “rubbish relationship.” She wrote 21 over a three month period, usually when she was wasted— “I was completely off my face writing that album,” she told Vanity Fair, “and a drunk tongue is an honest one.” She would go through two bottles of wine and chain-smoke while writing the lyrics, then look back at what she’d scrawled down in the morning. The emotional intensity scarred her. “How I felt when I wrote 21, I wouldn’t want to feel again,” she told The New York Times a few years later “I was miserable, I was lonely, I was sad, I was angry, I was bitter. I thought I was going to be single for the rest of my life. I thought I was never going to love again.” If there’s an inflection of melodrama in these songs, it’s because of those high stakes. She sings in absolutes, then rushes to fill in the nuance. Adele wrote “Set Fire to the Rain” to be a camp anthem for a queer audience, but its sonic surcharge and all-or-nothing lyrics (“I was over/Until you kissed my lips, and you saved me”) are at home on the album, nestled between titanic high notes that roar over cinematic piano and pleas about love dying. Listening to the album in one go can feel a bit draining, the weight of all these grandiose melodies slumped atop each other. Adele aims to disarm; you’re left clutching at the wisps of synths that sometimes close out a ballad. But the maudlin elements of the album also feel essential: they enable Adele to capture the specific sinusoidal hell of being 21, the emotional velocity that follows a first, serious love. There are refractions of her across the album—Adele Enraged, Adele In Love, Adele Avenging—as she tries to articulate identity through the shape of a lover’s absence. “I’ll be somebody different,” she begs on “I’ll Be Waiting,” “I’ll be better to you.” Much of the album shows Adele calibrating a relationship she’s experiencing with an inherited ideal of what love means. “If this ain’t love, then what is?” she moans on “He Won’t Go,” the question genuine, the prodding laid bare. She wrote “One and Only” as a fictional exercise, trying to imagine the conversation she’d want to have with a lover down the line, and it radiates with hope and expectation. “You’ll never know if you never try/To forget your past and simply be mine,” she belts. To some critics, 21 was a “bitter” album, a “vengeful” one. What I hear more pressingly is a woman trying to form agency out of the murk of devastation.”I won't let you close enough to hurt me,” she sings on “Turning Tables.” Adele said that she wrote the haunting “Someone Like You'” “because I was exhausted from being such a bitch” with other songs on the record—but while “Someone Like You” is beautiful and clear and stirring, Adele’s at her most fun when she lashes out. The winkingly vindictive “Rumour Has It” shimmies and shivers under the smoke in her voice. I’d heard “Rolling in the Deep” maybe forty times over the years before it came on shuffle one day and cut me, the sting and curdled rage. “Go ahead and sell me out, and I’ll lay your shit bare,” she murmurs. The ferocity of these songs isn’t dulled or disguised or smuggled in through tidy pop formulas. She continuously wrestles for control and reaches for a vision of herself across time—before she waded into her lover’s life, or decades later when they’re old—and that device is less about her trying on someone’s vantage point and more about her trying to narrow down who she actually is. On 21, she constantly moves between phases of a relationship, between dimensions of grief. “Only yesterday was the time of our lives,” she breathes in “Someone Like You,” a song about reaching out to an ex years after the end of their relationship and finding that he’s now married and content without her. “I lose myself in time just thinking of your face,” she sighs on “One and Only,” what she called the first happy track she wrote for the record. Her portraits of despair also involve surging between the past and present. “When was the last time you thought of me, or have you completely erased me from memory?” she demands on “Don’t You Remember.” Throughout the song, she struggles to cast herself as someone worthy of recollection, the last remaining way she can become a permanent fixture of her ex’s mind and life. Love is hitched to precarity in Adele’s world, always needing to be stated or defended or mourned. Part of this, perhaps, stems from the broad narratives in Adele’s songs. The other forces of breakup tracks at the time, Drake and Taylor Swift, filled their songs with details: a red scarf left at an ex’s sister’s house, an apology for having sex four times in one week. Adele’s writing is allusive. She sings in generalities — hearts melting, last goodbyes, pleas to forgive unnamed sins. 21 asks for your participation. You’re meant to summon your mottled heartbreak to fill in some of the blanks, and tap into the sorrow and rage and remorse that quakes through these songs. “21 isn’t even my record,” Adele told Zane Lowe in 2015. “It belongs to people.” Adele knew 21 would loom over her for the rest of her career. “My thing was, how do I follow up 21?” she said. “But I can’t, because it was so big, so many people took it into their lives. I can never live up to that again.” In the video of the BBC experiment, she watches as person after person tries on the character of Adele. She feigns nervousness—“I’m going to be sick,” she murmurs at one point, maybe a nod to her history of stage fright. But when it’s her turn to sing, it’s only an instant before the row of impersonators realize who she is. Their mouths flop open, cartoonish, and they touch each other’s arms. They join in and sing her words back to her, some starting to cry. Adele beams at them from behind the mic and stares at all these refractions of herself. She keeps watching them, transfixed.

New York: Deluxe Edition,Lou Reed,by: Daniel Felsenthal,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f68edaafa63d0a85b6c8b4e/1:1/w_160/new%20york_lou%20reed.jpg,2020-09-26 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/lou-reed-new-york-deluxe-edition/,Rhino,"Lou Reed was unusually hard to pin down in the 1980s. After the gay-rights-rallying cry of Transformer in 1972, he spent a decade mating queerness with rockn’roll and flirting with his own homosexuality in public statements, an identity that seemed to culminate in 1979, when he came out to Creem Magazine. Hardly a year later, he was celebrating married love on Growing Up in Public and, by 1982, heterosexuality in more general terms on the nonetheless excellent The Blue Mask. Reed’s subject matter changed because his life did—he got married in 1980—yet his newfound pop persona as a successful heterosexual capitalist coincided with the rise of Ronald Reagan, who was murdering gay people with his refusal to acknowledge the AIDS epidemic while helping to make greed and white-collar success culturally ubiquitous. Reed never supported Reagan’s policies, but he gave the impression of a star wearing the garb of his own era, scrawling an ode to his New Jersey country home as easily as he once caked on glam rock make-up. And then he made New York, a record of unmistakable conviction, one so direct and literary, erudite and rageful that it resembles no protest music written before or since.  Released in January of 1989, days before George H.W. Bush’s inauguration, New York treats straightforward hard rock and clean-toned, mesmeric guitar as blank pages on which to lay down a series of news stories, urban setpieces, and liberal-minded principles. Donald Trump and Rudy Giuliani appear in its hyperdense lyrics—gleefully, Reed subjects both to horrific calamities. He once stated that he wanted to write “the Great American Novel” using “the rock’n’roll song as a vehicle,"" and on New York, the directive feels apt rather than pretentious. The city of his birth becomes his Yoknapatawpha County, a location for synecdoches that encompass large swatches of experience. Like much great fiction, Reed’s handling of his themes—a depleted environment, indigenous persecution, pro-lifers, police killings, racial violence—has aged into greater relevance today. Though Reagan is never named, New York is nonetheless a dispatch from the fear-ridden two terms of our 40th president, an album that touches on aspects of the ‘80s ignored by the era’s major-label music. Prince, Cyndi Lauper, and Reed himself worked HIV/AIDS into earlier songs, yet those few instances shied away from connecting the epidemic to the gay community. “Halloween Parade” uses the eponymous West Village tradition to show the hole that AIDS left in queer life: There’s a downtown fairy singing out “Proud Mary”
As she cruises Christopher Street
And some Southern Queen is acting loud and mean
Where the docks and the Badlands meet
This Halloween is something to be sure
Especially to be here without you Reed’s songwriting always shined when he wrote about subjects other than himself, and New York is structured around characters: the Romeo Rodriguez of the thrilling opener “Romeo Had Juliette,” its turns of phrase packed as tightly as Dylan’s in the mid-’60s; the abused young Pedro on the three-chord single “Dirty Blvd.;” the proverbial whale—which might be a novel, or might be an endangered species—on the VU-esque highlight “Last Great American Whale.” We have references to Michael Stewart, a black graffiti artist murdered by the police, and Bernard Goetz, an NRA-embraced vigilante who shot four black teenagers on a subway train. Over 57 minutes, New York transforms from a collection of diffuse character studies into a concept album about the futility of the individual to be a meaningful agent of political change. On the penultimate track, “Strawman,” Reed provides his album with a thesis in reverse: “Does anyone need another self-righteous rock singer?” The danger of this kind of music is the ravaging that time does to proper nouns and political stances. Shockingly, Reed’s liberalism still feels progressive. The one exception is on the taut, distorted “Good Evening Mr. Waldheim,” about Jesse Jackson’s 1988 presidential campaign, and an incident in which he referred to Jews using the ethnic slur “hymies.” Reed was understandably offended, but he peppers his song with ripostes that have aged poorly, notably interrogating Jackson’s belief that U.S. leaders should meet with the Palestinian Liberation Organization. Contextualized by the multiperspective New York, though, the song fits: it evokes someone agitated at home, arguing with the evening news while the city rumbles by outside. The new deluxe edition of New York contains live versions of every track, glizted-up arrangements of the Reed standards “Sweet Jane” and “Walk on the Wild Side,” one non-album instrumental, a long-out-of-print concert film, and a number of demos and rough mixes. These works in progress largely serve to show that Reed got it right with the album’s final version. When New York was released, Reed was 46 and seemingly done trying lifestyles on for size. He’d made something that echoes James Baldwin’s Another Country in its depiction of a city tensely cohabitated by gay and straight, black and white, Latinx and Jewish—one that nonetheless holds a candle for the possibility of utopia. New York also introduced a loose trilogy of works (including 1990’s Songs for Drella, about Andy Warhol’s death, and 1992’s Magic and Loss) that animated middle-age from a point-of-view that was not explicitly gay but also glaringly non-straight. AIDS is never mentioned outright, but the records are undoubtedly products of the epidemic: They focus on the inadequacy of saying farewell, avoiding “Family values” as well as family relationships to consider the anguish of losing friends to disease.  There’ll be no Halloween Parade in the Village in 2020. In a year of virus, election, publicized police abuses, and natural disasters, it’s a minor yet sorrowful loss. We don’t need a self-righteous rock singer now—probably, we never did—but on New York, we got a worried and determined one. After dressing up in so many different costumes, Lou Reed revealed himself to be like the rest of his city: reasonable and resilient in a crisis, staring grimly at authorities too big to wrap a song around.","A new reissue highlights the ongoing relevance of Lou Reed’s opus about his hometown in the era of AIDS and Reaganism, a protest album unlike any other

Finds You Well,Khotin,by: Rob Arcand,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f6cc7e693fc9c741723eaa4/1:1/w_160/Khotin%20-%20Finds%20You%20Well.jpg,2020-09-26 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/khotin-finds-you-well/,Ghostly International,"For Dylan Khotin-Foote, house music has long been a vehicle for careful studies of ambient tone and texture. On his 2014 debut album, Hello World, the Canadian producer used hardware synths and drum machines to craft muted compositions that traded the bleary-eyed psychedelia of the Orb and the KLF for a playful impressionism with little interest in historical continuity. The album became a touchstone for a generation of lo-fi house producers who slathered their recordings with reverb and tape hiss. Unlike many of his peers, Khotin mostly abandoned the kick drum, honing his focus on vivid soundscapes with albums like New Tab and Beautiful You. Finds You Well, his first album under the alias in two years, pairs his skill as an ambient musician with a newfound interest in spacious downtempo production, expanding the scope of the project without compromising what made his earlier work so special. Like his early experiments with house music, Khotin’s use of warped and pitch-shifted breakbeats serves mostly to complement his foundation in ambient composition. Tracks like “Ivory Tower” and “Heavyball” feature breezy melodies and coarse drums loops in equal parts, building intricate collages that feel intentional in new ways. With its dial-tone arpeggios and warbling tape-deck stutter, “WEM Lagoon Jump” invites comparisons to ’90s IDM icons Boards of Canada, finding a soothing equanimity in the rolling current of its effect-ridden snares. Beyond their immediate rhythmic similarities, the two acts share an affinity for wistful samples and field recordings; “Groove 32” explores the percussive potential of short vocal clips doused in radio static, while “Outside in the Light” turns distant voicemails from family members into something warm and dreamlike. As much as the album benefits from a renewed interest in rhythm, many of its strongest moments skew toward the softer side of the producer’s palette, with slight arrangements that meditate on a single mood. On “Lucky Egg,” a steady loop of pitched toms and synth pads blooms into a poignant snapshot of a snowy landscape, as a single crystalline keyboard floats like lens flare across its surface. The shortest track on the album, as well as one of its sparsest, it sets the tone for a stretch of delicate compositions that wring heartbreak from the upright piano. “Your Favorite Building” calls to mind the rosy miniatures of Blithe Field and Ricky Eat Acid at their most affecting; like these contemporaries, Khotin seems content to set a few well-placed elements in motion, stepping back to watch their smoldering glow from a distance instead of fidgeting with any single detail up close. In its final moments, the album recedes even further into heartfelt solitude. With little more than a few skeletal piano chords struck at distant intervals, “Shopping List” finds a sublime beauty in the near-silent space between tones, sculpting excess reverb into a wintery jetstream that might otherwise be categorized as background noise. Less about the sound itself than the strategic use of its absence, it’s a moment that might go unnoticed on another record, but one that feels like a transformative reset in Khotin’s hands. What might sound ordinary in isolation can feel transcendent with the right frame of reference, and as Finds You Well shows, sometimes it’s the smallest details that can reshape your entire perspective.","On an album blending downtempo beats and ambient textures, many of the strongest moments skew toward the Canadian producer’s softer side, with slight arrangements that meditate on a single mood.

The Ascension,Sufjan Stevens,by: Sam Sodomsky,Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f68e75e354df1f61a0186ea/1:1/w_160/the%20ascension_sufjan%20stevens.jpg,2020-09-25 05:00:00,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/sufjan-stevens-the-ascension/,Asthmatic Kitty,"The title track on The Ascension is one of the best songs Sufjan Stevens has ever written. Accompanying himself on keyboard with a sad, pulsing melody, Stevens uses precise and empathetic language to address faith and hopelessness, regret and revelations. He shouts out a character from King Lear. He rhymes “confess” with “confess.” He declares life to be meaningless—and he sounds like he means it. “To think I was acting like a believer,” he sings in his feathery, heartbroken way, “when I was just angry and depressed.” It is the only song on the album that fits squarely into his comfort zone, where questions of life and death feel as intimate as the words to a love song. Also worth noting: It takes more than an hour to get here. Along the way, there are slow jams and dancefloor singalongs, a panic attack set to creeping industrial music and what sounds like Stevens’ score for a campy ’80s horror movie. It is exhaustive and dense and detailed—which, of course, is nothing new. From his 2005 breakthrough Illinois to his last proper solo album, 2015’s grief-stricken Carrie & Lowell, Stevens has always worked best when he immerses himself in his subjects, encouraging the same devotion from listeners. And while The Ascension lacks the direct throughline of these high-water marks, it is another huge leap, an attempt at rebuilding his sound from the ground up. The majority of the album was recorded with a drum machine and several Prophet synthesizers while Stevens’ more characteristic equipment—acoustic guitars and banjos—were in storage during a move. Leaving his longtime Brooklyn home for a more scenic and remote spot in the Catskills, the 45-year-old songwriter found new hobbies, like getting off the internet and buying a tractor. Consciously or not, these songs follow a similarly picturesque voyage, zooming out from the daily grind toward the kinds of refrains that have become pop music clichés, largely because of how good they feel to say and hear: I wanna love you. Run away with me. Tell me you love me. It’s one of the first things that strikes you about this blocky, electronic music—the pared-down language and echoed refrains from radio hits and pop culture. The cerebral, ambitious songwriter—whose tracklists once looked like stage directions to a quirky play—now seems intent on speaking directly, sweeping you away with him. It leads to seductions (“Make love to me/Surrender your spirit/Sing my eulogy”), threats (“Go on wipe that look off your face”), and bare confessions. At one point, he sings in a breathy whisper, “I shit my pants and wet the bed”—a hard thing to imagine coming from a performer who has worn enormous angel wings on stage. Stevens attempted something similar on another major pivot, 2010’s The Age of Adz. In those songs, he sang over buzzing synths and clattering rhythms, gravitated toward conversational language, and steered away from the nuanced storytelling and character studies of his past. At the same time, the compositions on Adz were a continuation of his more symphonic work, surrounding his voice with countermelodies and choirs, building to flute-accompanied crescendos and multi-part epics. It felt new for him but still played to his strengths: heartfelt, ecstatic, too much. The Ascension, in comparison, is spare and sad, purposefully repetitive and almost entirely down-tempo. Many of its arrangements evoke steep, neon-lit half-pipes that Stevens glides up and down, sometimes shouting along the way and other times muttering anxiously to himself. A song called “Die Happy” features just one lyric—“I want to die happy”—which he sings over and over, relying on the twists and layers of synths to add new dimensions to his mantra. The whole thing works best when you approach it like a big-budget IMAX movie set in space with a great leading actor: Don’t get too hung up on the plot—just tilt back your head and watch him float. Once in a while, Stevens lands on something magical and his writing transcends. This happens in the final 70 seconds of the otherwise dirge-like “Tell Me You Love Me,” and it happens again in “Landslide,” when he wails the title in a desperate warble, incorporating his own vocals into the arrangement like a sample. In these moments, the steady slow-burn pays off. He lets you in on the feeling of breaking free from something heavy and monotonous pulling you under. Stevens has spoken about feeling emotionally depleted after making Carrie & Lowell, a quiet album that uncovered childhood trauma with vivid memories and hushed, acoustic arrangements. It makes sense that he would follow it with something less revealing, more open to interpretation. Multiple songs discuss crises of faith and coming apocalypses, and they employ their pop choruses to offset the gravity, to place his stories in the present tense, to give us something to dance to. “I also think this record, because it is political and bossy and bitchy,” Stevens told The Atlantic, “needed to be somewhat fun, sonically.” But despite its allusions to pop music escapism, The Ascension is, by design, kind of a drag: a dark and emotionally distant mood piece whose lyrics rarely touch on the specifics necessary to anchor the music, and whose music is rarely exciting enough to elevate his words. “Every song title on the album is a cliche,” he admitted to The Quietus. “...I’m desperate for some kind of platitude that tells me where to go, and how to go about my business in a way that’s healthy and sustainable.” It’s a relatable anxiety, although, purposefully or not, he mostly sounds stuck in place. Not to mention, he’s been here before, and too few of these thoughts approach the prayer-like resonance of, say, “All things go,” or “I want to be well,” or “We’re all gonna die.” In its search for direction, The Ascension fares best when Stevens looks inward. He finds momentum in the bittersweet “Goodbye to All That,” returning to one his most familiar settings: on the road, despondent, “hopelessness incorporated.” And just before the sweeping curtain call of “America,” there’s the title track—the point when Stevens accepts his strengths and speaks to the moment. “But now,” he sings in the most heart-tugging reaches of his falsetto, “it strikes me far too late again/That I was asking far too much of everyone around me.” Whatever perspective he may be singing from, he sounds tapped into something elemental, filled with purpose and clarity, following wherever his vision leads. He sounds like himself.","Exhaustive, dense, and detailed, Sufjan Stevens’ electro-opus is another huge artistic leap that speaks plainly to complicated emotions and attempts to rebuild his sound from the ground up.

Renegade Breakdown,Marie Davidson & L’Œil Nu,by: Anna Gaca,Associate Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f33e9125c7679ff1e19ba93/1:1/w_160/Marie-Davidson.jpg,2020-09-25 05:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/marie-davidson-and-loeil-nu-renegade-breakdown/,Ninja Tune,"Always ahead of a trend, Montreal musician and producer Marie Davidson quit touring in September 2019, six months before everyone else did. Years of vigorous, largely solo travel behind 2016’s Adieux au Dancefloor and 2018’s Working Class Woman left her depleted and addicted to the sleeping pills she used to cope with insomnia, she told the CBC. Plus, she was tired of club music. “I want to make chansons, you know?” she said. “I want to tell stories and sing.” Marie Davidson & L’Œil Nu, Davidson’s first project since stepping back, features her vocals and synth against backdrops she constructed with two close collaborators: Pierre Guerineau, her husband and partner in the synth-pop duo Essaie Pas, and Asaël Robitaille, who helped to produce songs on Working Class Woman and Essaie Pas’s 2018 album New Path. Renegade Breakdown, their debut release, is a self-consciously odd and varied collection of classical pop songwriting, lounge music, ’80s-inspired synth-funk, and moody chanson. Not that you’d know it from the opener, where a heavy four-on-the-floor beat animates one of Davidson’s signature, biting, voiceover-like spoken performances. “By the way, there are no money makers on this record/This time I’m exploring the loser’s point of view,” she quips. “The uglier I feel, the better my lyrics get.” Think of this as the “old” Marie Davidson—the one we’re used to—introducing a new version, who rejects aesthetic posturing and thinks the dance music industry can keep it, all of it: “Your science is a poison I can no longer ingest/Take your prescription and shove it up your ass…Your party sucks anyway.” Guerineau and Robitaille match her commitment to being unfashionable. They fill the album with rhythms and textures that feel dated and chintzy to contemporary ears, like the digital MIDI-funk and cheaply gated drums of “C’est parce que j’m’en fous,” or else dated and spooky, as on “La Ronde,” where a tuneful, saccharine chanson is overtaken by screeches and tolling bells. As Renegade Breakdown cycles through styles, the only constant lies in lyrical nods to the anxiety and dislocation of solo travel and the effort required to steady oneself. “I keep my fingers crossed as the plane is taking off/I’m feeling kind of lost/Today I’m back to rock,” Davidson intones on “Back to Rock,” the album’s second track: seven and a half dirge-like minutes of AC/DC guitars and “Mad World” interpolation beneath thick synthetic smog. While the title and placement imply a formal disavowal of electronic music, the sheer unearned indulgence presents its own critique. “Drive me somewhere nice/Give me loads of ice/I love my drink real cool,” Davidson demands in the intro, as if riffing on a tour rider. In classic Marie Davidson style, the outright criticism of one thing is also a silent, tacit criticism of everything not mentioned. Renegade Breakdown isn’t the sound of solitary days and nights on the road; it’s the noises and voices filling the empty space, a reckoning with the ironies and tragedies of life as a musician. “Just in My Head” confronts the dissociative feeling of showing up to the club and hating every minute: “Sitting in a corner waiting for the show to be over … Is it that something is changed? Why the music feels lame? Why do I feel so blue?/Or am I going strange?” The song itself sounds more like the forlorn jazz of a vacant hotel lounge, or Angelo Baldamenti’s skulking “Audrey’s Dance” from the Twin Peaks score. On “Lead Sister,” Davidson laments Karen Carpenter’s fatal struggle with anorexia, singing ominously in French about an “angel voice” who becomes “overexposed” and then consumed by the “somber idea of perfection.” As a downcast lounge performer with an edge of sing-talk in her voice, Davidson is remarkably convincing, and as a series of experiments, Renegade Breakdown never fails to be interesting. What it lacks is the urgency and stylishness of Davidson’s past albums, which is almost certainly the point. Not every fan of her dedicated club output will appreciate a song like “Sentiment,” the twinkling French-language closer that evokes the overture to a ’60s art film, complete with the gentle whirr of a projector. Nor, I suspect, does she want them to. Even as its musical forms and source material remain familiar, Renegade Breakdown is a work of knowing misdirection, a way of staking out new creative territory that’s challenging, idiosyncratic, and proudly uncool.","In self-imposed exile from the international club scene, Marie Davidson teams with two close collaborators for a self-consciously odd collection of Lynchian lounge music and digitized funk.

Haunted Painting,Sad13,by: Chris O'Connell,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f68e317fa63d0a85b6c8b4c/1:1/w_160/haunted%20painting_sad13.jpg,2020-09-25 05:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/sad13-haunted-painting/,Wax Nine,"A few years ago at Seattle’s Frye Museum, Sadie Dupuis locked eyes with Saharet, painted by Franz von Stuck in a 1902 portrait. The famous vaudeville dancer is pictured in a green gown, a red rose in her hair, her lips slightly parted in a smile; upon first glance, she appears content. But dark shadows encircle Saharet’s eyes and her cheeks are ghostly white, a stark contrast. Drawn to Saharet’s enigmatic face, the Speedy Ortiz leader began thinking about haunted paintings, and then writing new music. In works like The Picture of Dorian Gray and Ghostbusters II, possessed artworks are often avatars for age-old themes like the mutability of the self and the thirst for eternal youth. Dupuis explores these sweeping ideas about art and existence throughout Haunted Painting, the fantastic, frenetic second solo album from her solo project Sad13. Whereas Sad13 was previously Dupuis’ bucket for poppier Speedy Ortiz songs, Haunted Painting marks a clean break, a bifurcation of her musical personality. It’s Sad13 reckoning with her past, one she doesn’t quite recognize anymore. Recording at five different studios with five female engineers, Dupuis plays 18 instruments, including guitar, theremin, lap steel, glockenspiel, electric sitar, and “toys, trash, ephemera.” If that sounds exhausting, it sometimes is. Most songs are stuffed with diverging melodies and dense instrumentation. But Dupuis is such an adept songwriter and accomplished singer that the excesses are part of the appeal. Take “Ghost (of a Good Time),” an anthem to aging out of the afterhours. Reaching the other side of 30, Dupuis looks back on nightlife as a “heavy fog, mistook for aura.” But sonically the song evokes exactly what Dupuis claims to abhor: Synthesizers soar, buzz, and twinkle over a jittery, syncopated drumbeat from Zöe Brecher, melding dance music and math rock. A good time in its own right, it’s a party song about being fed up with partying, in which the keyboards throb like an ice-cream headache—the consequence, perhaps, of too much of a good thing. That incongruity is a neat trick, a bit of sleight of hand that Dupuis pulls across much of the album. As she lyrically paints vivid pictures of mental-health diagnoses, indie-rock misogyny, and disappearing from existence, she fills each canvas with endless layers of glossy, bouncy pop music, juxtaposing weary eyes with a smile. Dupuis also knows exactly when to pull her foot off the gas. On “Market Hotel,” a comparatively straightforward rock song about confronting both the patriarchy and her self-perception as an adult, Dupuis sings, “I’m working three fucking jobs, I’m too embarrassed to die.” At that moment, most of the noise fades to make way for a heartbreaking moment of honesty, one of many on Haunted Painting. “What a dream when you float out of sight/Dragging the haze that cloaks the morning to decimate my life,” she sings in the final chorus of “Oops...!” as the herky-jerky drums, fuzz guitars, and plonking organ melt away. For a few seconds, it’s just Dupuis, her multi-tracked background vocals, and a sparse acoustic guitar. The New York City native even twangs the word “morning,” stretching into a third syllable and opening the door for a country-pop album when synthesizers go out of vogue. The opener, “Into the Catacombs,” and the penultimate song, “Take Care,” are windows into an alternate universe in which Haunted Painting is a chamber-pop album, mostly unencumbered by her neon universe of electric instruments. Backed by a classical octet and joined by pair of male vocalists—Helado Negro’s Roberto Carlos Lange on the former, Pile frontman Rick Maguire on the latter—Dupuis’s voice is the centerpiece. It’s just two words floating with a pair of flutes, but Dupuis stretching “I care,” across the chorus is affecting enough to make you wish for more songs like this. These moments offer brief, beautiful peeks at one version of Sad13—a hidden world within Haunted Painting. They’re alluring in their own right, but in the end they’re merely parts of the larger self-portrait: the sad eyes to her sly smile, rounding out the complexity that makes her music so appealing in the first place.","On the second album under her solo alias, the Speedy Ortiz frontwoman uses maximalist electronic pop to explore youth, self-perception, and a reckoning with the past.

The Reinvention of Romance,Sarah Hennies,by: Jonathan Williger,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f6c4aa06fc208866f3622b0/1:1/w_160/Sarah%20Hennies%20-%20The%20Reinvention%20of%20Romance.jpg,2020-09-25 05:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/sarah-hennies-the-reinvention-of-romance/,Astral Spirits,"Love can be overpowering. That’s the side of it we most frequently hear in song—less so the slow process of building trust, or the gentle practice of persistent gratitude. Grand statements supersede the steady work of maintenance, with its more intricate drama. Percussionist Sarah Hennies offers a different perspective on The Reinvention of Romance, a new composition for cello and percussion that elegantly represents the give and take of two individuals in a relationship. The players cyclically find each other and drift apart over the course of the piece’s 87 minutes, moving through passages of sweetness, awkwardness, and unity. Hennies’ music is intimate, immersive, and often unusually empathetic. One of her most impactful works, Contralto, features trans women speaking and singing in lower registers. It is a moving account of dysphoria, making connections between sound and experiences of gender and self. Often Hennies’ recordings feature instruments and other sound sources captured at extremely close range, placing the listener next to or inside of them in the sonic landscape. The Reinvention of Romance does this to powerful effect; you can hear the granularity of the bow on cello strings, the clarity of a mallet hitting the xylophone. The crispness of the recording has the effect of personifying the instrumental parts, turning them into characters in Hennies’ carefully plotted drama. Listening to The Reinvention of Romance requires a great amount of patience. Its narrative arc is slow to unfold; the tonal palette is limited to plucked or bowed cello, rounded mallet tones, the screech of bowed metal, and a smattering of percussive clatter. The musicians trade off playing drones and pulses across a series of repetitive patterns, each lasting between 15 to 20 minutes, separated by stretches of silence. At times metallic percussive tones dance nimbly around stretches of grinding cello, and at others the thrum of sporadic low-end cello pizzicato punctuates the biting ring of horse hair on steel. Some configurations cause strife, yet even in the piece’s most disorienting moments, the instruments seem to be closely attuned to one another, playful and mimetic. Seeing the contours of an intimate relationship in the way these unadorned sounds push and pull against each other requires an imaginative leap, and a fair amount of trust in the composer, but Hennies has a talent for making the abstract approachable. Once the romantic frame is in place, it becomes easy to see the core tenets of the piece—patience, the inexorable meshing of difficulty and beauty, the power of circumstance and change—as commentary on the daily experience of intimacy. Hennies utilizes space and silence to conjure a sense of intensity; it’s as if the two voices are drawn together instinctively, returning to one another again and again after periods of separation, searching for common ground. She draws the ear to the dynamic between the two players by emphasizing minute differences in tone. When those two voices are the only sonic elements for an hour and a half, each change in how they relate to one another becomes monumental. In the final 15 minutes of the composition, the cello and mallet percussion finally meet, ringing out simultaneous long tones. They are not in unison, however, or even in consonant harmony, and just as the passage seems to reach a climax, they begin to fade very slowly. There is no satisfying ending, and no real resolution. As the final, lonely silence sets in after the piece’s conclusion, we’re left with the poignancy of the struggle to find one another and the inherent value in that journey.","In an engrossing 87-minute piece in which cello and percussion circle each other through passages of sweetness and strife, the American composer explores the daily experience of intimacy.

Apple,A. G. Cook,by: Claire Lobenfeld,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f63e178291a3fedd683eb5f/1:1/w_160/apple_a%20g%20cook.jpg,2020-09-24 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/ag-cook-apple/,PC Music,"PC Music founder A. G. Cook settled on Apple as an album title, he says, because the word evokes so many things: the eponymous tech company (which, historically, has been regarded as the opposite of the Windows-based personal computer, or “PC”); the Beatles’ record label, where the group could stretch their legs and play with genre; the forbidden fruit in the Garden of Eden. Eve’s indulgence from the tree of knowledge is an apt metaphor for Cook’s output. Like most things with Cook’s name on it, Apple—his second album this year, following last month’s 7G, a seven-disc collection of sketches and experiments—is a staggering and potent amalgamation of numerous genre influences, but it also has moments of information overload, where its boundarylessness becomes too much. The crunchy slow jam “Lifeline” makes a strong case for Cook’s alchemical formula. He imbues pop-punk earnestness with the sweeping scope of an ’80s power ballad, an elemental pairing that could easily be saccharine or cloying, and then offsets them with static and mutating vocals, idiosyncratic touches that keep Cook straddling the fence between full-on pop and genre-agnostic experimentalism. “Beautiful Superstar” similarly displays a kind of softness that, on an intuitive level, is almost nauseating. Yet it is so devoid of irony, sincere in its performance, and tight in its production that it becomes irresistible. Cook’s cerebral schmaltz comes into sharp relief on the album’s brassier songs. “Xxoplex” has harsh Eurodance elements and PC Music’s signature chipmunk whoops, while the maudlin “Animals” sounds like it could have come from Kanye’s Yeezus moodboard. The polarity apparent at each turn on Apple shows how deftly Cook sees the underlying kinships between disparate sounds and makes them work harmoniously together. “Haunted” is probably the best example: Restrained acoustic guitar morphs into synthy Siren calls that sound almost like emergency sirens by the end. But if these formal tricks are meant to be thought-provoking, some of those thoughts boil down to, Wait, why is this happening? This could also just be PC Music’s curse. Long pegged as the future of pop, they’ve been around for almost a decade, yet their work still urges deconstruction, which raises the question: Are we there yet? But Cook and PC Music have long banked on pop’s ineffability. The style has no dependable definition, Cook recently told the New York Times, beyond “packaging it to be approachable or consumable.” Today, the form is more amorphous than ever: Late rappers like Lil Peep and Juice WRLD were more avid students of pop-punk than your average 2005 high-school garage band, and artists like Deb Never and Billie Eilish embrace a singer-songwriter ethos while traversing in contemporary rap themes and melodies. Genrelessness abounds, but Cook’s music has nothing to do with restoring the monoculture. His work is confounding and sometimes irritating, but totally singular to his mind. This can’t be the future of pop; no one else could do what he does, even if they tried.","One month after releasing 7G, the PC Music founder refines his synthesis of futurist pop and experimental electronic music, flirting with cerebral schmaltz and information overload.

Find the Sun,Deradoorian,by: Shawn Reynaldo,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f68be06fa63d0a85b6c8b15/1:1/w_160/find%20the%20sun_deradoorian.jpg,2020-09-24 05:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/deradoorian-find-the-sun/,Anti-,"Finding oneself is never easy, but Angel Deradoorian seems determined to try. In recent years, the nomadic singer-songwriter cultivated self-awareness while actively embracing solitude, decamping to the woods of upstate New York for long stretches. In 2019, however, she found herself craving communion (and the company of other musicians), and brought that feeling into the studio. Find the Sun, her second full-length, is the unexpected result. Boomy and soaked in reverb, the record occasionally sounds like someone set up a single mic in the corner and left the room. It’s darker, less polished, and more openly meditative than anything she’s done before, miles away from the psychedelic sheen of her debut, 2015’s Expanding Flower Planet, and its more subdued follow-up, 2017 mini-album Eternal Recurrence. But the new LP’s fuzzy, almost lo-fi aesthetic gives her music an earthier, more grounded feel, even in its most psychedelic moments. Find the Sun was recorded at the Panoramic House, a scenic analog studio in Marin County, California. On previous releases, Deradoorian largely worked alone, only involving others when she needed an instrument that she couldn’t play herself. This time, she recruited percussionist Samer Ghadry and guitarist Dave Harrington (of Darkside), granting them license to not just play along, but to improvise and help flesh out the sketches she’d already written. Setting up shop in Panoramic House’s spacious live room, they refused to overwork the material, running through each song only a few times before selecting the best take and moving on to the next one. Their breezy approach shines on “Corsican Shores,” a peppy tune that sits somewhere between ’60s garage rock, fuzzy Phil Spector-produced pop, and the jangly groups that populated the K Records roster during the ’90s. The LP’s guitar-centric approach is a bit of a surprise, but Deradoorian isn’t a stranger to big riffs. She’s done stints in bands like Dirty Projectors and Avey Tare’s Slasher Flicks; more recently, she’s been ripping it up as the vocalist of BSCBR (aka Black Sabbath Cover Band Rehearsals), filling Ozzy Osborne’s shoes alongside artists like Yeah Yeah Yeahs guitarist Nick Zinner and drumming virtuoso Greg Fox. Find the Sun never reaches Paranoid levels of bombast, but it’s easily her brawniest solo record to date. Songs like “Saturnine Night” and closer “Sun” channel the psychedelic swagger of ’70s giants like the Doors and Led Zeppelin, while the rubbery bassline and surging guitar chords of album highlight “It Was Me” bring to mind the likes of Nirvana and Hole—or at least the times when those bands emulated indie pop groups like the Vaselines and Young Marble Giants. But Find the Sun shouldn’t be mistaken for an exercise in rock worship. The influence of Can looms large, and Deradoorian’s music is still psychedelic, weird, and seemingly primed for a hallucinogenic trip to the outer recesses of the human psyche. With its motorik groove and dramatic talk-singing, “The Illuminator” sounds like a freaky, nine-minute-long outtake from Andy Warhol’s Factory, while the slinky “Devil’s Market” recalls the space-age lounge music once championed by bands like Stereolab. “Saturnine Night” does feature growling guitars, but they’re paired with an unkempt Krautrock rhythm that could have been pulled from Neu! 2, along with a dramatic, PJ Harvey-esque vocal turn from Deradoorian, who belts out brooding lines like “Innocence/In my death” and, simply, “I die.” Thematically, Find the Sun is rooted in the idea of self-exploration. Deradoorian has a fervent passion for psychology, neuroscience, and astrology, and in the months before she hit the studio, she attended an intense, 10-day Vipassana meditation retreat in rural Massachusetts that further shaped the album’s introspective tilt. While there, she meditated 10 hours a day and could not touch or even acknowledge fellow practitioners, but Deradoorian—who describes the retreat as life-changing—seems to have come out of the experience with a deeper understanding of herself, her body, her fears and anxieties, and her capabilities. Find the Sun can’t necessarily be described as a confident album, but its creator’s willingness to document her spiritual growth and present herself as vulnerable feels uniquely brave and honest. The gentle “Waterlily” and the somber “Mask of Yesterday” offer some of the album’s quietest, most emotionally naked moments, but Find the Sun reaches a whimsical zenith on “Monk’s Robes,” a folksy, largely acoustic number whose twirling melodies wouldn’t be out of place at the local Renaissance Faire. It sounds escapist, but according to Deradoorian, “it’s a song about accepting the futility of attempting to escape your reality, finding peace in acceptance and working with what you have to make something beautiful.” It’s an approach she’s applied to all of Find the Sun, which feels like a snapshot of a single moment along a much longer path. Like most of us, Deradoorian doesn’t know where she’ll ultimately end up—but she’s embraced that uncertainty. Even with its dense clouds of reverb, Find the Sun might be the album that provides the clearest window into who she is.","Angel Deradoorian’s second LP is darker, less polished, and openly meditative. Even in its most psychedelic moments, the fuzzy aesthetic gives her music an earthy, grounded feel.

Risking Illness,Ian Wayne,by: Allison Hussey,"Associate Staff Writer, News",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f63dad455ddabcd3eea14bc/1:1/w_160/risking%20illness_ian%20wayne.jpg,2020-09-24 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/ian-wayne-risking-illness/,Whatever's Clever,"Grief is a shapeshifter. It looks different to everybody: a lingering ache, a temporary scrape, a heavy phantom limb. The Brooklyn-based singer-songwriter Ian Wayne encountered a form of grief he’d never known before after the death of his 3-year-old nephew from leukemia in 2017. He learned about his nephew’s illness while on his very first tour, and, within two weeks, his nephew had died. Now, three years later, as the world tries to synthesize new forms of grief every day, Wayne has released Risking Illness, a sensitive and gentle record that navigates the aftermath of a loss sharpened by Wayne’s sense of forward momentum and humility. The album’s melancholic, close-knit arrangements of acoustic guitar, piano, and light percussion soften its devastation. Wayne’s level voice and sober pacing allow the record to unfold carefully, prioritizing deeper emotional understanding over split-second eruptions. Though Wayne doesn’t hold himself to all of the Kübler-Ross stages of grief, themes of bargaining, depression, and acceptance form most of the album’s foundation. How is it possible to return to a “normal” life after it’s been suddenly cratered by forces beyond your control? Wayne asks questions that simply have no answers. Mid-tempo jog “Gimme Something” is Wayne’s most hurried track, coasting over layered guitars and a pattering rhythm. He leans the titular request more toward a plea than a demand. Having reached a new low, Wayne introduces a vein of humility on “Gimme Something” that runs through the record. He addresses it directly in the soft, better-days aspirations of “Now Is Was” and promises to “own [his] problems” on opener “Coyote.” Wayne’s admissions of vulnerability sometimes bring an energetic edge to his despair, as if he’s still trying to wheel and deal his way into a better outcome. And when he’s exploring the duller pains of a relationship (“Baby,” “People”), he re-adjusts the commonplace bruises of disagreements and missed connections within his widened perspective. Above the warm undercurrent of Risking Illness, Wayne uses strategic pauses to highlight the most impactful moments. In “Baby,” he leaves a moment of space between an instrumental break, explicitly declaring the start of a new chapter, relying on a hair’s-breadth of room to make his point land. As he sings, “Baby, I will always love you/In between the times that I do not,” he honors how tender affection can still linger long after the lights have gone out in a relationship. On “Winter’s,” however, moments of silence feel like daggers, the album’s strongest and most affecting track by far. Singing alone with an acoustic guitar, Wayne fumbles with the loss of his nephew and its circumstances, guilt lacing his voice. He fidgets as if he’s trying to get the math—or any of it—to make sense by looking at it from another angle. An electric guitar slips in before Wayne completes the final line, “Twenty-seven on the day that he died,” and the full-band flourish that seals the track mirrors the busy preventative measures of turning thoughts in another direction before they get too dark. Some grief doesn’t ever go away; it makes room for itself at any size. Risking Illness acknowledges the heartfelt futility of trying to get over it.","The Brooklyn singer-songwriter navigates the aftermath of grief on his gentle new record.

Shore,Fleet Foxes,by: Matthew Strauss,News Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f66908a537682947f093866/1:1/w_160/Fleet%20Foxes%20-%20Shore%20-%20Art.jpg,2020-09-23 05:00:00,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/fleet-foxes-shore/,Anti-,"For Robin Pecknold, the music of Fleet Foxes has been a coming-of-age story. Pecknold founded the band in Seattle with childhood friend Skyler Skjelset when they were just about 20 years old, making unpretentious yet studied folk music and quickly signing with Sub Pop, who released the band’s pair of landmark 2008 releases, Sun Giant EP and their self-titled debut. Fleet Foxes hid their youth in plain sight, singing fables and channeling musical influences—like Judee Sill and the Byrds—that signaled nous and maturity. By 2011, a 25-year-old Pecknold began to show his age with the existential Helplessness Blues before disappearing and returning, at 31, with the more confrontational Crack-Up. Over the course of just a few releases, you could trace the arc of a songwriter shedding his past, finding his voice, and making more personal, complex, and, often, brooding music. Shore, the fourth album from Fleet Foxes, brings gratitude back into the fold as Pecknold ascends to a graceful new plateau. The record’s mood is born largely from existential worries and the shadow of death, common concerns of Pecknold, who, now 34, has spent his career transforming anxiety into euphoria with towering, wall-of-sound choruses that belie the unease that inspires them. Career-making songs like the barnstorming “Helplessness Blues” were strengthened by a sense of overcoming despair, the feeling that we could all stare down obsolescence and say, That’s OK, I’m OK. Distress does not disappear entirely on Shore; it’s just accepted and worn, making for an album that is musically adventurous and spiritually forgiving, like it’s constantly breathing in fresh air. On Shore, being grateful also means staying true to yourself and expressing what comes naturally. The album is bright and open, recalling, at times, the sunniness of their early songs, as well as the lighter moments of 2017’s Crack-Up, like “Fool’s Errand.” Instead of turning away from major-key melodies and blissful vocal harmonies, Pecknold leans into musical happiness on songs like “Sunblind” and “Young Man’s Game,” among the most jubilant entries in the band’s catalog. On the latter, Pecknold acknowledges the futility of faking it, singing: “I could worry through each night/Find something unique to say/I could pass as erudite/But it’s a young man’s game.” Reinvention, he implies, is deceitful; refinement and reflection, instead, are the paths to progress. The idea of refinement is crucial to Fleet Foxes because, on the surface, the band sounds remarkably similar to how it did 12 years ago—without feeling like it’s retreading past sounds or themes. The resurgent Crack-Up demonstrated Pecknold’s evolution as a lyricist and songwriter, someone who could write stirring couplets while commanding extended metaphors and maintaining a degree of writerly distance. The album also contained more intricate arrangements, something that Pecknold has carried onto Shore, where the compositions are even more textured and buoyant. The new album, which Pecknold performs almost entirely by himself, is lively, as if he has broken open previous albums’ ambitious centerpieces (namely “The Shrine / An Argument” and “Third of May / Ōdaigahara”) and spread bits of those proggy endeavors across the whole record. “A Long Way Past the Past,” for instance, layers horns and a shifting guitar line beneath Pecknold’s harmonies and words about letting go of regrets. The crisp production details give Shore a natural feel, as if the guitars, drums, and horns warble and float in the breeze alongside the birds, whose chirps lead “Maestranza.” Elsewhere, there are explicit nods to contemporary classical music, as on “Jara,” which features hocketing by Meara O’Reilly, and “Cradling Mother, Cradling Woman,” which pairs O’Reilly with a snippet of Brian Wilson counting to resemble Philip Glass’ Einstein on the Beach and, in its sampling, also recalls the early work of Steve Reich. These moments don’t last long, serving as intros to their respective tracks, but they do signal Fleet Foxes’ continued willingness to experiment and venture beyond the confines of their reputation as a folk band whose music sounds as accessible and pleasant coming out of the speakers at Whole Foods as it does to Post Malone. In composing some of the most vibrant music of his career, Pecknold also opens up as a writer, returning a bit to the nature imagery of his early work while turning his poeticisms into actual reflections of his thoughts. On the striking “Sunblind,” Pecknold shares his love for late songwriter heroes, including Richard Swift, John Prine, Bill Withers, Judee Sill, Elliott Smith, David Berman, and Arthur Russell. He mourns their loss and thanks them for leaving behind the gifts of their music, while also connecting their art with a life lived fully. “I’m gonna swim for a week in/Warm American water with dear friends,” Pecknold sings, alluding to Silver Jews’ 1998 opus and juxtaposing the jagged brilliance of Berman’s songs with the physical act of “swimming high on a lea in an eden.” “Sunblind” is made all the more exhilarating by how Pecknold arrays the darkness of American Water and the ocean’s vast beauty, acknowledging the former and embracing the latter. He returns to Berman on the sedate closer “Shore,” specifically recalling the day of the songwriter’s death. At the song’s end, Pecknold repeats, “Now the quarter moon is out,” again turning to the landscape in mourning. Pecknold’s appreciation for life, his joy in spite or because of death, continues throughout Shore. Dark figures creep into the edges of the songs—e.g., “These last days/Con men controlled my fate” from “Maestranza”—as if their invitations to give into self-pity or hate are necessary to propel Pecknold toward music that’s rich and fulfilling without becoming overly sentimental. Every moment feels earned. The album’s climax arrives on the back half of the propulsive “Quiet Air / Gioia,” where Pecknold exalts, “Oh devil walk by/I never want to die.” It’s a consciously excessive declaration that does nothing to obscure our greatest fear, earnest and vulnerable in its very willingness to make the admission. Fleet Foxes’ music has never been overly heavy, but each release brings expectations. Pecknold said that he wrote some of Helplessness Blues to have new material to play on tour with Joanna Newsom. And the tangled, prog-folk of Crack-Up, of course, came after a six-year hiatus, landing like a great unburdening of every idea gathered during Pecknold’s time as a student at Columbia University. Shore may be the first Fleet Foxes album without such a burdensome weight, arriving somewhat by surprise, without a long layoff, and into a cultural landscape that no longer foregrounds indie rock at the center of the musical universe. There’s a freedom to it that shows in the lithesome “For a Week or Two” and “Thymia,” or at the beginning of the record with the singing of Oxford student Uwade Akhere, suggesting that Pecknold does not feel the need to lead the way or come back immediately with some massive statement.

The Times EP,Neil Young,by: Jesse Jarnow,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f68c31b291a3fedd683ed82/1:1/w_160/the%20times_neil%20young.jpg,2020-09-23 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/neil-young-the-times-ep/,Reprise,"Neil Young’s live audiences this year have included a cat, several dogs, a barnyard of disinterested poultry, and Daryl Hannah. The actor, Young’s wife and quarantine partner, is also the in-house cinematographer for the Fireside Sessions, an endearingly homemade series of performance videos shot on an iPad in and around their Colorado home. These brief sets, uploaded to Neil Young Archives, Young’s personal website and idiosyncratic high-resolution streaming platform, effectively constitute his touring for the year. That makes The Times, which documents a July Fireside Sessions performance of topical and socially conscious songs from across Young’s vast catalog, something like his newest live release.  The iPad’s rudimentary digital recording capabilities give The Times a lo-fi but distinctly modern starkness that stands in contrast to Young’s longstanding fixation on sound quality and love of vintage (and expensive) analog gear. The raw sound, mixed and mastered to the fullest extent possible, carries a certain populist immediacy, capturing Young’s voice through the same consumer-level technology available to everybody else. After Young’s 50-plus years making records, The Times is a new kind of homegrown. Listening to The Times feels a bit like checking in on a cool older relative’s social media feed to affirm they haven’t gone QAnon-level bananas during quarantine. Young mercifully has not. The collection’s two songs that he hasn’t previously released are “Lookin’ for a Leader 2020,” which updates 2006’s “Lookin’ for a Leader” with lyrics about Black Lives Matter, and a cover of Bob Dylan’s “The Times They Are A-Changin’.” Though both affirm Young’s commitment to righteousness, neither hit particularly hard as music. “The Times” feels too vague, and “Lookin’ For A Leader 2020” too specific. Both are easier to appreciate as emotional windows into Young than statements unto themselves.  “Ohio,” Young’s 1970 protest song about the National Guard’s murder of four Kent State students that year, hits harder. A half-century later, as it becomes increasingly clear that “four dead in Ohio” is a tiny sliver of unceasing state-enacted violence on American citizenry, the song is as painful and real as ever. “Alabama,” originally released on 1972’s Harvest, is nearly as powerful. Young’s solo acoustic version plays like a black-and-white photograph next to the full-color harmonies by Stephen Stills and David Crosby on the original. Unlike the more aggressive “Southern Man,” also included here, “Alabama” is more imagistic than prescriptive, with “banjos playing through the broken/glass windows down in Alabama” before the white robes of the Klan flash by—a haunting open-ended quality that lends itself to the stripped-down treatment. The Times’ version of “Southern Man,” merely a smaller-sounding take on an otherwise powerful classic rock song, doesn’t transform itself in quite the same way. Young is releasing The Times through his longtime label Reprise, and via an exclusive streaming deal with Amazon Music. Still, the EP's ramshackle documentary spirit is in line with the Neil Young Archives project, where the performance was first broadcast, and it feels most genuinely political when considered in that context. What began as a quest for high-resolution audio via the much-punchlined Pono player eventually resulted in Young’s own independent, self-updated platform, a full-service site for his music, writing, and videos. And if he loosened his anti-corporate stance by partnering with Amazon on The Times, he holds it strongly at the Archives. He recently announced he would be removing the option for users to log in via Facebook and Google (“Facebook is screwing with our election,” he wrote), further cutting off his corner of the internet from its dominant navigation platforms. Young has said he chose to release The Times via Amazon “because no one delivers better sound to the masses,” and it’s possible to read some willful perversity into his decision to give them an EP he recorded on an iPad in less than an hour. Whether a sellout move, an ironic statement, or just another example of Young’s decades-long zig-zag through pop music, The Times feels genuine and unforced—an organic expression of whatever he was feeling at the time, in all its weirdness and contradiction. In other words, it’s prime Neil Young.","The iconic songwriter offers a selection of tunes from across his catalog, performed live in his house and recorded with an iPad. It sounds as starkly homemade as you’d expect.

The Liz Tape,Armani Caesar,by: Evan Rytlewski,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f63b4ddf0d7e171f003b054/1:1/w_160/Armani-Caesar-The-Liz-Tape-Griselda.jpg,2020-09-23 05:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/armani-caesar-the-liz-tape/,Griselda,"Following a long hot streak that cemented the label’s hallowed standing in the most traditionally minded corners of hip-hop fandom, Griselda has entered the thorniest phase for any rap imprint: expansion. Hitherto a tight circle of brothers Conway the Machine and Westside Gunn and cousin Benny the Butcher, this summer the Buffalo, New York collective branched out with releases from Detroit signee Boldy James and Benny’s Black Soprano Family crew, neither of which threatened their reputation for quality control. Now comes the Griselda debut from Armani Caesar, the label’s self-billed “First Lady,” whose album The Liz Tape alternatingly embraces and cuts against Griselda’s throwback Mafioso rap with gusto. Armani may not share the blood ties of Griselda’s founding trio, but her biography overlaps. She’s from Buffalo, and she was discovered by Griselda’s late producer DJ Shay, who signed her in 2009, so like Conway and company, she logged plenty of time in obscurity before finding her break. And since she’s on Griselda, it goes without saying that she’s got bars. “Hundred grand flow, chillin’ in the Lambo/Eight bands for the bag, two more on the sandals,” she spits on “Gucci Casket,” with a precision that recalls early Nicki Minaj, without the cartoonish embellishments that eventually turned Minaj’s pressure-cooker flow into shtick. The Liz Tape spends its opening stretch proving just how well Armani belongs on the label, casting her crime tales against bruising loops and terse, Mobb Deep pianos—“Countdown” even throws in a Redman sample, old-head catnip in its most concentrated form. It also gives her plenty of chances to spar with Conway, Westside, and Benny, and she has a natural rapport with each of them. She’s the Sharon Stone in Casino to the label’s assorted De Niros and Pescis, the new arrival who fits in so naturally you could be convinced she was always part of the ensemble. And yet, unlike her new labelmates, Armani isn’t a born outsider. As hard as The Liz Tape works to cast her as the Foxy Brown/Lil’ Kim of their crew, the lone woman who punches as hard as her male cohorts, her flows are too flashy and contemporary to be boxed in by Griselda’s East Coast classicism. Her wanderlust sets in on the record’s second half, where she begins to sound less like a Griselda lifer than a talented ringer who saw an opportunity. There’s a sense that, left to her own devices, she’d rather play in 21 Savage and Megan Thee Stallion’s sandbox than Roc Marciano’s, especially on “Yum Yum,” the first ever straight-up strip-club track on a Griselda release. The Liz Tape stacks its best songs back to back, and they show off her dueling sides. The DJ Premier-produced “Simply Done” is a golden-age fever dream, a frenzy of hard bars, kinetic loops, samples, and scratches—it’s thrilling, in that perfectly predictable way that every first new DJ Premier track you’ve heard in a while is thrilling. “Drill a RaMa,” on the other hand, disposes with ’93-era New York in favor of Atlanta circa now, with Armani and Benny firing off twisty triplet flows and clearly relishing the breather from Griselda’s usual boom-bap. It’s a rare rapper who’s equally equipped to crush both tracks. By now, Griselda is so established as a trio that some fans may be inclined to write off a newcomer like Armani as a second-tier member. But it’s her willingness to shake things up that makes her such a valuable addition to a crew that, despite its impressive track record, can sometimes be blinded by its reverence for rap’s past. A little modernity looks good on them.","Griselda’s newest signee alternatingly embraces and cuts against the Buffalo collective’s throwback Mafioso rap.

The Studio Albums 1978-1991,Dire Straits,by: Stephen Thomas Erlewine,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f6a641f295f7fb02b72635e/1:1/w_160/51y95A-IBBL._SL1425_.jpg,2020-09-23 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/dire-straits-the-studio-albums-1978-1991/,RhinoWarnerRhinoWarner,"Stats don’t lie, but the tales they tell can be misleading. Take Dire Straits, who were by any measure one of the biggest rock bands of the 1980s. Their 1985 LP Brothers in Arms was a blockbuster on par with Thriller, Born in the USA, and Purple Rain; for nearly a decade, it held the title as the best-selling British album ever, before being dethroned by Oasis’ (What’s the Story) Morning Glory?. Yet singer and guitarist Mark Knopfler’s fame quickly eclipsed the rest of the band, including bassist John Illsley, the only member who stood alongside him in every one of the group’s incarnations. Musicians came and went with regularity during the group’s heyday, the cast changing as Knopfler and Ilsley refined their silvery, slithery hybrid of British progressive rock and American country—a curious, improbable fusion that Dire Straits made seem logical, perhaps even inevitable. In doing so, the group acted as the bridge between the ’70s AOR and ’80s MTV, shepherding a transition from faceless arena rockers to flashy video stars. Brothers in Arms benefited greatly from MTV. The network placed the computer-animated video for “Money for Nothing” into heavy rotation, sending the album into the upper reaches of the charts, a place it would call home for the better part of a year. The video’s success could be called a fluke, but the album appealed to legions of sophisticates who couldn’t be bothered with MTV. Its novel production—a DDD affair, in the parlance of the times, meaning it was recorded, mixed, and mastered digitally—appealed to audiophiles, and its reputation for sumptuous sound helped make it the first million-selling compact disc. But beneath the digital gleam, Dire Straits’ debt to roots rock was evident, particularly in Knopfler’s mellow growl and clean, deft guitar solos. A tension between polish and grit was evident from the start, as the 2020 box set The Studio Albums 1978-1991 illustrates. Containing nothing but straight reissues of the six studio albums the group released during its lifetime, the set contains nary a frill. (Regrettably, the 1983 EP Extendedance Play, with its giddy new-wave single “Twisting by the Pool,” isn’t here, nor 1984 live 2xLP Alchemy.) But that modesty helps draw connections between records, tracing the band’s growth while underscoring its constant attention to detail. Heard collectively, these albums suggest that Dire Straits were a far artier band than their reputation suggests, with a subdued sense of adventure that propelled the group throughout its career. Artiness was not a quality associated with Dire Straits back in 1978, when the band released its eponymous debut; the UK was in the thick of punk rock, yet Dire Straits were tagged a pub-rock band. There was some truth to that label. Knopfler and drummer Pick Withers both played in the regrettably named Brewers Droop, who managed to go not much further than their hometown of London during their brief lifetime in the early ’70s. And Charlie Gillett, a renowned London DJ whose Honky Tonk show was one of the pub-rock scene’s epicenters, gave early airtime to Dire Straits’ “Sultans of Swing” demo, an act of generosity that quickly led to a record contract for the band. “Sultans of Swing” certainly had a tinge of country rock; Knopfler skated up and down his fretboard with ease as he growled half-spoken lyrics about a group playing Dixieland jazz and Creole music in South London. “Sultans of Swing” is their self-titled debut’s snappiest number by some margin—its only rival in hooks is “Setting Me Up,” the record’s tightest cut and also the one song that could be comfortably be called country—but it also contains much of what makes the album beguiling: Knopfler sketches scenes, setting his ambiguous, evocative scenarios to vamps that hint at both melody and groove without quite coalescing into either. Ghosts of an imagined American West float through Dire Straits, but despite the imagery, rhythms, and instrumentation, the album keeps drifting towards an amorphous atmosphere that betrays the group’s British roots. It hints at other styles and sounds without quite committing to either earthiness or mind-expansion. The elusiveness is one of its pleasures: the band’s identity lies within these margins. Once “Sultans of Swing” turned into an unexpected smash on both sides of the Atlantic, Dire Straits rushed out Communique, tentatively expanding their reach while Knopfler honed his songwriting and co-producers Jerry Wexler and Barry Beckett stripped away some of the slipperiness producer Muff Winwood had brought to the debut. Their rhythmic evolution is immediately apparent as the album bounces into focus with the reggae lilt of “Once Upon a Time in the West.” The band’s dreaminess is less apparent here, but it surfaces on “Portobello Belle,” a lovely, relaxed character sketch that shows Knopfler’s growth as a songwriter, as does “Lady Writer,” a “Sultans” rewrite that’s sharper than it should be. Knopfler wasn’t the only one so enamored with “Sultans of Swing” that he wanted to recapture its magic. Bob Dylan enlisted the guitarist and Withers for support on his 1979 gospel makeover Slow Train Coming, and Steely Dan hired Knopfler to play on “Time out of Mind,” a highlight of their 1980 magnum opus Gaucho. Dire Straits were now operating in the big leagues, and they chose a correspondingly big-league producer for 1980’s Making Movies: Jimmy Iovine, the producer behind big hits by both Bruce Springsteen and Tom Petty. Working with Knopfler at his side and AOR airwaves in his sights, Iovine gave Making Movies considerable muscle. The album reaches its apex with “Sold Rock,” a macho bit of hard rock that leans into its rock’n’roll puns, but the record’s heart lies within its first side, where the triptych of “Tunnel of Love,” “Romeo and Juliet,” and “Skateaway” realizes Dire Straits’ most romantic, cinematic tendencies. None of the three are love songs in the traditional sense; they’re songs of longing, songs whose bittersweet nature suggests better times. The sentiment runs throughout Dire Straits’ catalog, and Iovine’s canny production gave it definition and direction. The closing “Les Boys” muddies their rose-tinted glance at the past, however: A jaunty bit of after-hours vaudeville, the song is meant asa sideways salute to post-war Germany’s gay cabarets, yet the lyrics’ stream of stereotypes and Knopfler’s audible sneer undercut any claims of affection for his subject. It’s a sour note on an album that otherwise finds Dire Straits hitting their stride. Instead of pursuing the AOR direction of Making Movies, Dire Straits took a leftward detour with 1982’s Love Over Gold. Apart from the lively “Industrial Disease,” Love Over Gold abandons any lingering pub-rock vestiges for a full immersion into prog rock. Frontloading the album with the 14-minute “Telegraph Road”—the remaining four songs are all shorter, but usually only by an order of half—the band positions itself way out in space, a journey assisted by the addition of keyboardist Alan Clark and rhythm guitarist Hal Lindes. The additional musicians allow Knopfler and Ilsley to drift, pushing texture into the foreground and underscoring the group’s often unspoken debt to Pink Floyd—an inevitable comparison, thanks to the crawling keyboards and dextrous single-note guitar solos. In places, Dire Straits sound almost like they were working toward a rock-oriented spin on new-age music, one where the sonics overwhelmed the songwriting. Songs came crashing back into the spotlight on Brothers in Arms. Stripping away the excesses of Love Over Gold, Dire Straits distilled a shimmering, atmospheric sound that could withstand industrial-strength rock’n’roll, cowboy laments, and heartache alike. That delicate balance between songcraft and austere atmosphere is key to the album’s phenomenal success: It could appeal to traditionalists and modernists alike. Some of Knopfler’s sturdiest songs are here, such as the pining “So Far Away” and “Why Worry,” a tune so lovely the Everly Brothers covered it soon after its release. Listening to Brothers in Arms decades later, its moodiness is striking, particularly when Knopfler’s guitar glides atop Clark’s keyboards; this is the sound modern acolytes like the War on Drugs and Jason Isbell have adopted as their own. Brothers in Arms is also home to “Money for Nothing” and “Walk of Life,” a pair of smash singles that helped sustain Dire Straits’ popularity into the 1990s. Like “Industrial Disease” before it, “Walk of Life” is the rockin’ anomaly on Brothers in Arms, but its cheerful, old-time rock’n’roll became a standard on screen and in sports arenas alike. As popular as it was, “Walk of Life” was overshadowed by “Money for Nothing,” a screed against music videos cannily given a cutting-edge video that made it a staple on MTV. Sung from the gruff perspective of a blue-collar appliance installer who can’t believe musicians draw a paycheck, the song theoretically gives the songwriter license to portray his character’s homophobia in the third person, but the song’s verse about the “little faggot with the earring and the makeup” is jarring and distasteful. Heard in close proximity to “Les Boys,” it’s hard to hear it as simply Knopfler singing in character, the way his idol Randy Newman did on “Rednecks."" Some critics did call out Knopfler about this “Money for Nothing” verse back in 1985—Robert Christgau noted the singer-songwriter somehow got the word on the radio “with no static from the PMRC”—and Canadian radio ultimately banned the song in 2011. The controversy may dog Dire Straits, but it’s never quite tarnished the group, possibly because Brothers in Arms was simply too big: It was certified platinum 14 times in the UK, nine times in the U.S. The record’s success afforded the group the opportunity to take an extended hiatus, allowing Mark Knopfler to pursue his country-rock busman’s holiday the Notting Hillbillies and cut a duet album with his hero Chet Atkins in 1990. A year later, Dire Straits lurched back into action for On Every Street. The archetype of a ’90s mega-album, On Every Street was bigger than its predecessor in every way: longer, louder, slicker, steelier. Outwardly, it announced itself as a big deal, but its pleasures were modest. Dire Straits seemed to come to life when Vince Gill picked up his guitar on the rollicking novelty “The Bug,” and they took full advantage of George Martin’s arrangements on the knowingly nostalgic slow-dance number “Ticket to Heaven,” but when they attempted to conjure a bit of “Money for Nothing” swagger on “Heavy Fuel,” they sounded listless. This sense of fatigue runs throughout On Every Street, its enervation accentuated by the album’s CD bloat; where earlier Dire Straits albums wrapped things up at an efficient five or seven songs, this rambled through 12, overstaying its welcome. Somehow, Knopfler sensed Dire Straits had overstayed their welcome, too. He pulled the plug on the group in the mid ’90s, pursuing a decidedly understated solo career and never once getting lured back for a reunion, despite the prospect of larger paychecks. When the band was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 2018, he never acknowledged the honor publicly. His brother David, who played with the band at the outset, also sat out the festivities, as did Withers: instead, Illsley accepted on behalf of the group, with Clark and Guy Fletcher in tow. Knopfler’s absence carried the message that Dire Straits belonged to the past, a band to be relegated to anthologies like this one. Beyond the box set’s nostalgic charm, what’s interesting about the group’s collected catalog is what it says about their genre and era. Over the course of six studio albums, Dire Straits evolved from eccentric oddities into smooth commodities, neatly encapsulating classic rock’s own journey from the fringes to the center of the establishment.","As heard on this 6xLP box set, the UK classic rockers were artier than their reputation suggests, with a subdued sense of adventure that propelled the group throughout its career.

Host,Cults,by: Arielle Gordon,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f63dff4f317a0935d1a0c06/1:1/w_160/host_cults.jpg,2020-09-22 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/cults-host/,Sinderlyn,"The indie-pop world has completed several rotations around the sun since Cults first released their Day-Glo earworm “Go Outside.” The New York duo’s synthesis of girl-group harmonies and Jonestown imagery was praised, at the time, for Trojan horsing a conceptual record about anxiety into soundbites ready for an iTunes commercial. Along with Sleigh Bells’ menacing cheerleader blasts and Foster the People’s bluesy hooks about Columbine, they unwittingly became part of a small trend that took the tragedies of American nihilism and washed them out in comparatively mellow, 1960s-inspired tones. But while the axis of small indie labels has tilted towards synth pop and simplicity in the intervening decade, Cults’ very darkness has been mainstreamed: Billie Eilish’s horrorcore music videos and Lorde’s bummer ballads all embody a “doomer” mentality that set in from the very first notes of Cults’ MIDI glockenspiel. The major-label shift to melancholia offers plenty of room for overt displays of depression and high-concept music videos set in psych wards, but it left Cults’ cheeky creepiness out of step. On 2017’s Offering, they attempted to carve out a lighter sound with breezy guitars and wispy falsettos, displaying a carefree attitude that felt immediately dated. On Host, Cults find solipsistic charm in retreading the shadowy pastures of their past, bolstering the dream pop of their earlier work with the tactile verve of live instruments. The cymbal crashes, horn blasts, and piano strokes of “8th Avenue” feel like hearing Cults in Technicolor after years of black-and-white, digitally rendered instrumentation. Working with classically trained violinist Tess Scott-Suhrstedt, along with a rotating cast of cellists, percussionists, and a trombonist, core duo Brian Oblivion and Madeline Follin dig deeper into the roots of their sound. The strings and drum blasts that open “Trials” recall the lush retro flourishes of Phil Spector’s work with groups like the Ronettes and the Crystals; the thin, plucky acoustic guitar on “Shoulders to My Feet” conjures the slanted folk of George Harrison’s self-titled record. Even when Cults reach for synths, as on “Like I Do,” the snap of live drums lends weight and permanence to Follin’s cool croon, which too often faded into Offering’s layers of artifice. Host also marks the first time Follin brought her own music and lyrics to the recording studio, and her vocals, occasionally cloying and strained on their previous record, feel appropriately at home in the mix. Her two main modes, a sugary falsetto and a sharp deadpan, work best when they provide texture to the surrounding instrumentation, rather than attempting to overpower it. The simple repetitions of “A Low” and “Like I Do” exemplify this: Her voice echoes the former’s sliding strings and highlights the low bass of the latter’s synth line. The simplicity also faithfully renders the album’s concept, which loosely tracks the toxicity of a parasitic romantic relationship on its “host.” With few details about the emotional leech, “Trials” fills in the gaps: “I know you,” Follin intones, her minor triplets suggesting wariness rather than familiarity. But the relative verbosity of “Working It Over” loses its footing as Follin competes for airtime, the reverberating piano lost behind awkward rhyming structures and crowded verses. Ten years in, Cults find their power in returning to their origins, if somewhat reluctantly. “We can’t escape ourselves!” Oblivion bemoaned in a recent interview. Host proves the duo can reinvent themselves within a static framework; by revisiting the sounds of their ambitious, albeit thinly produced debut with bigger and bolder instrumentation, they’ve emerged from the afterglow of 2010s virality as a more robust and rooted ensemble. The mainstream pop industry has come to inhabit the darkness they pioneered, but Cults finally feel above the fray.","Ten years after “Go Outside,” the New York duo find solipsistic charm in revisiting their past, bolstering their classic sound with the tactile verve of live instruments.

BC,Bwoy Coyote,by: Hubert Adjei-Kontoh,Associate Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f63ddfefa63d0a85b6c8997/1:1/w_160/bc_bwoy%20coyote.jpg,2020-09-22 05:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/bwoy-coyote-bc/,self-released,"Not much information is readily available on Bwoy Coyote. All that can be gleaned from his Bandcamp page is that he is a producer and artist who lives in Houston. A sense of mystery also animates his music, which utilizes elements of contemporary trap as a jumping-off point for R&B at its most abstract. It’s easy to get lost in his maze of minimal production and meandering thoughts. On BC, his most recent EP, Coyote distinguishes himself by only gesturing at what he feels, providing the briefest glimpses of his inner world. Coyote frames his complex lines with the most rudimentary trap essentials. Mirroring the rocket hinted at in its lyrics (“I go takeoff James Harden/Houston Rocket, how I’m balling, takeoff”), “Starpower” launches upward on hi-hats and blinking swells of synth. Coyote trails along behind, establishing a singular statement of purpose in his cryptic lines: “I don’t need no starpower/Just cut me my check.” He speaks these lines first, and then he sings them, doubling for emphasis. His melancholic determination is reflected both by the sparse production and his plaintive vocals. The muted trumpets on “From Here” don’t signal triumph as much as they do resignation, and the song’s slurred, slowed-down percussion sounds mired in the muck of the chorus: “Where do we go from here, baby/Said, where do we go from here.” Coyote hides his inner conflicts in these cavernous, deceptively simple productions. On EP opener and trunk-rattler “Page” (jointly produced by Bwoy Coyote and Cubeatz), Coyote ruminates over a recently ended relationship. The cluttered hi-hats and reversed synth melodies reverberate with Coyote’s urgent warbling, a discordant mixture that matches the ambivalence of the recollection. Across the release, Coyote sounds like he’s looking back at a past event, determined not to carry the same mistakes with him to the present. He makes his resolve clear on “Spirit=Free” when he hums a halting affirmation to himself over the song’s ticking clock snare and toy-like melody: “Your spirit is free/Be all you want/Be all you can be.” Coyote finds freedom within the self-imposed limits of his productions, luxuriating in their bounds. Over the whistles and noodling synth pads of “Ben” (co-produced with VVS Chris),  Coyote transitions seamlessly from singing to rapping, moving from mocking posers to mourning Nipsey Hussle in the span of a few moments. When he mutters the chorus, “We might be coming up fast/We might be coming up slow,” he’s not embracing apathy as much as he’s narrating a moment in progress. His blurry portraits offer uncanny clarity. He doesn’t provide specifics; instead he allows his impressions to generate a logic of their own. The almost-ballad “Make U Understand” starts with what seems like a chorus (“I can’t make you understand/You just gotta know”), but Coyote quickly tires of it, preferring to list a series of non sequiturs instead: “Cream Russian/Fees coming/Feel like Pharrell/They frontin’.” In Coyote’s telling, love feels as transient and random as the words that get stuck in your head. Coyote maintains a Drake-tier distance between himself and his emotions, and Lil Uzi Vert’s shadow looms over his mournful melodic choices, but his form, or rather his formlessness, is unique. His drum patterns and sedate melodies stand out because of their stark simplicity; they flash in the dark, drawing you, moth-like, toward them. His lyrics point at images and emotions, leaving any sort of final observation up to the viewer. It’s the nighttime music your mind makes before you drift off into sleep.","The low-profile Houston producer and singer utilizes elements of contemporary trap music as a jumping-off point for R&B at its most abstract.

BREACH,Fenne Lily,by: Cat Zhang,Executive Editorial Assistant,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f68b862fa63d0a85b6c8b11/1:1/w_160/breach_fenne%20lily.jpg,2020-09-22 05:00:00,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/fenne-lily-breach/,Dead Oceans,"There comes a time in a disenchanted young man’s life when, unbearably stifled by the bourgeois-ness of his bourgeois surroundings—the competitive schools, supportive parents, constant supply of refrigerated whole milk—he pours himself into the collected works of Friedrich Nietzsche. Ask him to pass the salt, and instead you’ll receive a long-winded sermon on morality and eternal recurrence. “I get sick on second best/You get off to God is dead,” the Bristol singer Fenne Lily sings softly to one such sage on “I, Nietzsche,” nailing the dynamic of so many grim exchanges immortalized on the Instagram account Beam Me Up Softboi. Forget sex; the boy just wants to read. Lily’s 2018 debut, On Hold, was a breakup album that she hesitated to label a breakup album, lest the narrative be reduced to “girl sad about boy.” It was predisposed toward trembling, somber indie folk in the vein of Daughter, music for wordlessly watching rain collect on a windowsill. Like so many young artists whose work is interchangeably praised as “intimate,” “raw,” and “vulnerable”—elevated under the belief that catharsis equals profundity—Lily wrote pretty, sincere songs lacking specificity and verve. Nearly as cliché as philosophy bros are songwriters with hushed vocals and spare guitar inspired by For Emma, Forever Ago. BREACH, Lily’s first album for Dead Oceans, is a scruffier, more far-ranging record about developing a self in your twenties. Its version of early adulthood fits within the liberal-arts ethos of a show like High Maintenance: Subjects include self-medicating with weed (“Alapathy”), worrying about social media’s impact on your self-perception (“Solipsism”), and reaching new self-understandings in Western Europe (“Berlin”). Lily wrote “Berlin” after rereading Patti Smith’s Just Kids and embarking on a lone odyssey to the nightclub Berghain, that infamous colosseum of sin and techno. The result is a lulling slowcore ballad that resembles an old Taylor Swift gem and features Lucy Dacus on backing vocals. At its center is a tentative assertion of self-sufficiency: “It’s not hard to be alone anymore.” For Lily, writing this record meant learning to distinguish between being lonely and being alone. In the absence of a relationship, you cannot flee yourself; you detect unresolved insecurities as if they’re stray hairs on the sofa. The jangling wind chimes at the opening of “Elliot” hint at a new beginning; the innocent baby babbles on “98” offer perspective on just how much she’s grown. There are a few recollections about relationships, too. “Laundry and Jet Lag” deploys a predictable metaphor that compares leaving an ex to quitting cigarettes (“I’m left with the scars/Of you”), although its muted strings are lovely. A song like “Birthday” is wiser. Sprinkled with wry, macabre imagery—“You sent me a head on my birthday/You said it was made with love”—it reveals the retrospective humor to a wobbly relationship, the strangeness of contorting yourself for someone else. Little on BREACH compares to “I Used to Hate My Body But Now I Just Hate You,” a slow burner that sketches a shitty relationship with impressive economy. “I read all of the books you recommended/I listen to your friend’s band all the time,” Lily recalls, painting crushing as a sad combination of masochism and striving. Each verse is like a work of flash fiction. She fell for this person quickly; they performed intimacy as if for an elevator of strangers; and he moved on before she could play it cool. By the end, the person is long gone, sequestered at his parents’ home. But we still assign meanings to relics. The closer—“I still see you as some kind of reassurance that someday I’ll be understood”—discloses how our identity forms in the push and pull with others.

A Day in a Yellow Beat,Yellow Days,by: Ashley Bardhan,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f297aa24c501e303372e895/1:1/w_160/A%20Day%20In%20Yellow%20Beat_yellow%20days.jpg,2020-09-22 05:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/yellow-days-a-day-in-a-yellow-beat/,SonyRCA,"Since age 17, George van den Broek has performed goofy bedroom pop as Yellow Days. Now a 21-year-old Surrey resident with an endearingly discomfiting rattail-esque hairdo, van den Broek exudes self-assured, weird-band-teacher energy. “What I say goes, because that’s how it should work. I’m the artist, man,” he told Vice in 2018. A Day in a Yellow Beat, his third album and first for Sony/RCA in North America, is the tonal equivalent of those wooden “This Way to the Beach” signs that a certain kind of mom hangs in her kitchen: sunny but a bit contrived. “Intro/Be Free” makes the album’s funky, ’70s aspirations explicit, placing a sample of Yellow Days’ hero, Ray Charles, lamenting the sameness of modern pop musicians over a wry-but-rosy synth line. It’s a sweet introduction, and a good example of what makes Yellow Days appealing—he’s self-aware and doesn’t seem to take himself too seriously, a classically charming combination. But charm alone isn’t enough to make good music, and too often on A Day in a Yellow Beat, Yellow Days sounds caught in a bland impersonation act of his own making. Although his sensitivity to mental health and commitment to creating “upbeat existential millennial crisis music” lands him in the contemporary bedroom-pop category, Yellow Days pays clear homage to Black R&B and funk icons. There’s a little Marvin Gaye in his vocal delivery, some sense that his production is what you might hear if you ran Funkadelic through Google Translate. He’s quick to credit his references, but A Day in a Yellow Beat lacks the corresponding vision and feeling. These songs gesture at depression in a broad way, occasionally urging you to be free, carry on, and believe in the good of the world. At some points, the lyrics are so one-dimensional that it’s difficult to distinguish them from the most saccharine radio pop. “I want you to stay/Please don’t go,” Yellow Days croons over and over amid the celestial reverberations of “You,” a song too uninteresting to justify lazy writing. Still, there are some satisfying, earworm-y moments. On “Who’s There,” guest vocals by Shirley Jones of the R&B trio the Jones Girls create a smooth surface that contrasts the sultry inkinesss of Yellow Days’ musings. “Keep Yourself Alive” has a nice whine to it, like a sputtering pickup truck persevering towards the sunset—it’s happy and honeyed, urging you to enjoy yourself and “keep it alive.” Yellow Days is at his best in his most joyous moments, like on “The Curse” or “Be Free,” where a clear love for performance reverberates off of confident, emotive vocals. But it’s not enough to tip the balance of the album from imitation to innovation. There’s no question that van den Broek is an energetic and capable musician, but those qualities feel irrelevant when they show up in songs that might appear on a bad Shuggie Otis covers album.

&&&&&,Arca,by: Emilie Friedlander,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f63d96c291a3fedd683eb5d/1:1/w_160/&&&&&_arca.jpg,2020-09-21 05:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/arca-andandandandand/,Pan,"It sounds strange to say it now, but when Arca’s &&&&& dropped out of the blue in the summer of 2013, it felt like we’d finally arrived in the future. The 25-minute mixtape sounded like a celebration of speed, of the infinity of musical information that the internet puts at our fingertips, of the wild emotional contrasts of a night spent staring down the barrel of one’s feed. And to top it all off, it played like one continuous track. Though the Venezuelan producer’s source materials (grime, trap, glitch, dub) derived largely from club culture, &&&&& seemed to take a mischievous pleasure in disrupting the metric grid that dance music was built on—reveling in a sonic rubberiness that her previous two EPs, Stretch 1 and Stretch 2, had hinted at in name. Even the image that accompanied it—a bird-like creature with distended legs and translucent skin, courtesy of artist Jesse Kanda—seemed to suggest the birth of something new, quivering inside an amniotic sack of digital slime. In truth, &&&&& was probably less the dawn of a novel genre of electronic music than the crystallization of a perspectival shift that had already been in the works for some time—and not just in the foggy rooms of GHE20G0TH1K, the joyfully irreverent LGBTQ and POC-focused dance party where Arca interned as a college student at NYU, though it probably started there. Where the cool kids of the late ’00s had met the rising tide of technology with a retreat to the obsolete sounds and formats of the past (think: the vinyl collector culture driving the global techno scene, the cassette tape fetish of the chillwave generation), a new generation of producers and DJs at the turn of the ’10s—armed with CDJs and sample packs and vape pens—seemed to see a new revolutionary potential. It wasn’t just that the tools of electronic music production were becoming more widely accessible, or that the internet seemed to be having a democratizing effect on music, catapulting unknown artists to overnight fame; it felt like the old distinctions between high and low, underground and mainstream, club culture and pop culture, were finally on the verge of collapsing once and for all—and rattling the foundations of the culture industry in the process. Arca had given only one formal interview to date, but what we did know about her seemed to situate her in the cultural crosshairs of that moment: Hood By Air, the avant-garde fashion brand co-founded by GHE20G0TH1K’s Shayne Oliver—and for which Arca would compose the occasional runway soundtrack—was galvanizing the worlds of streetwear and couture with its vision of a gender-fluid, multicultural future. Auteurist experimentalists like Mykki Blanco and FKA twigs, who’d also tapped Arca for her lurching, ballooning sound design, seemed poised to become crossover stars. Just a month before she unveiled &&&&& to the world, Kanye West had dropped the era-defining Yeezus, an album with enough crunchy synth strobes, expressively deformed samples, and blood-curdling screams to sound right at home at a semi-legal warehouse party at peak time. In what critics roundly heralded, somewhat paradoxically, as a sign that underground music had finally entered the big leagues, he’d enlisted Arca’s own services for the production, alongside fellow eclectic beatmakers like Evian Christ and Hudson Mohawke. Even with so much in flux, it is hard to overstate how novel &&&&& felt when she uploaded it to SoundCloud. Though it was technically “released” by the label Hippos in Tanks, a home for brain-bending sounds that seemed to emblematize this “Wild West” moment in music, it didn’t actually seem to be for sale anywhere; and though Arca was billing it as a digital “mixtape,” a format that derived from hip-hop but that was becoming increasingly popular as a promotional vehicle in SoundCloud producer circles, it didn’t exactly seem to be teasing a more finished work to come (though Arca did self-release a small vinyl run of &&&&& in 2014). Unfolding as one long musical utterance—by turns hyper-caffeinated and mournful, brutal and full of open-eyed wonder—&&&&& was a complete work unto itself, an unfathomably skillful and multi-layered piece of music that is perhaps only possible to describe as the sum of its own contradictions. Here was music that was at once decidedly challenging and overflowing with hooks. And it was so aggressively synthetic, so plastic in its conception of sound and rhythm, that it somehow evoked the unchained emotionalism of the romantic composers she played as a young piano student (Schumann and Mendelssohn) more than it did actual dance music. Mostly, it felt like the first clear articulation of a feeling that was already in the air, and that arguably continues to drive the musical conversation to this day: In the post-internet world, music didn’t have to be one thing or another. It could be abrasive & melodic & synthetic & organic & prickly & sweet and frankly, whatever felt right in the moment. At least, that’s one possible explanation for mixtape’s enigmatic title—even though &&&&& always sounded too free-associative to feel like the mere illustration of a concept. Listening to it now, on the occasion of a new reissue and remaster from Berlin record label PAN—one that, for the first time, will make the record available on streaming services in the form of individual tracks—it’s the record’s rolling tides of feeling, its combined technical dexterity and emotional specificity, that stands out. Whether she’s splicing a pitched vocal sample into the aural equivalent of a strut, flooding the room in a cold ocean of synthetic voices, or dropping down the energy with a distended, melodic sigh, this symbiosis of woman and machine feels life-affirming. Seen from the vantage of 2020, of course, &&&&& feels like it was heralding a bright new future that never came to be; it’s hard to remain optimistic about technology when our politics are descending into Twitter-addled madness and the platforms we might have expected to sustain our creative economies in a time of crisis seem incapable of compensating our artists more than a fraction of a penny per stream.  Over the past seven years, Arca has continued to drill down into the complexities of power, gender, and the economics of the music industry itself, using each successive project to reveal another side of her person, to question why we do things the way we do, to reach out to her people through the pixelated ether. But there’s something a bit melancholy about listening to &&&&& now—the feeling that instead of freeing us from the past, technology has left us stuck in a loop, endlessly refreshing in search of a better world that never arrives, but that we can still dream of in our art. And while &&&&&’s genre-splicing, additive approach to sound arguably continues to set the blueprint for much of youth music today—from the post-club artists and collectives across the world pushing sound into mutant new shapes, to stadium pop—it’s hard to say whether there has been any giant, qualitative leap forward in music ever since.","A new reissue of Arca’s 25-minute mixtape from 2013 highlights its prophetic, trailblazing qualities. It remains an unfathomably skillful and multi-layered piece of music.

Orca,Gus Dapperton,by: Julia Gray,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f5ff756291a3fedd683e931/1:1/w_160/orca_gus%20dapperton.jpg,2020-09-21 05:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/gus-dapperton-orca/,AWAL,"Gus Dapperton: e-boy archetype, Porches lookalike, bedroom pop artist, post-Tumblr aesthete, TikTok native. He is a mood board, Gen Z culture personified. Over the past few years, the Brooklyn-based 23-year-old and his class of fellow online alterna-pop artists with colorful hair have developed an aesthetic: light, hazy synth tunes that blur into fans’ lives and Spotify algorithms. His smooth, sunny pop songs address modern anxieties in ways that feel direct and relatable, simple to the point of monotony. Dapperton’s two EPs and 2019 debut full-length garnered a young cult following that grew with his feature on BENEE’s “Supalonely,” a 2020 TikTok hit that climbed the Billboard charts. But musical identity was secondary to Dapperton’s rise, which seemed to hinge on easy listening and a trendy persona. Dapperton looks like Brooklyn to people who’ve never been to Brooklyn. He looks like a rock star to fashion insiders. He looks cool to teenagers. And he sounds like anybody. Orca, his self-produced second LP, is an introduction to the psyche beneath the quirky bowl cut. Unfortunately, it fails to answer some key questions—namely, who is Gus Dapperton and what is he trying to be? A newfound honesty and ease runs through Orca’s reflections on depression. You can hear him becoming more comfortable with his voice, stretching it beyond a nasally croon. Still, his personality remains hidden, and it’s hard to discern what he’s going for. “Bluebird”’s swaggering bassline feels goofy and forced against Dapperton’s bratty drone: “I’m young and I’m never getting old/That’s my human right.” “My Say So” lands somewhere between Top 40 hit, schoolyard chant, and fictional Disney Channel band as Dapperton and Australian singer Chela bop along to xylophone scales: “My say so still says the same/So I say so in different ways.” His most successful lines either appeal to a quick-pulsed adolescent nihilism, or are made to sound significant by attention-grabbing production choices. “I’m too atheist to pray for my life,” Dapperton moans on “First Aid,” arguably the best track on Orca. A phrase as inane as “I love it when you cuss” ignites when it’s pummeled by drums on “Grim.” But the album’s emptier arrangements expose contrived poetics. “Though books of Dawkins seem to think that we are through,” he pronounces on “Swan Song,” apparently having just finished The God Delusion. Dapperton tries on words like “apostacize” and metaphors about broken cameras, speaking as “the product of a crowded youth...strictly cavalier inside.” The flowery language doesn’t fit his mild pop flavor, and the shots at intellectual depth hardly register. Bedroom pop lends itself to a solitary environment, while anthemic radio pop usually requires more people in the room. Dapperton writes, records, and produces all of his own music; aside from some mixing, mastering, and guest vocalists’ harmonizing, Orca is a one-man production. And as he attempts to polish and sharpen the genre, his source material gets lost in translation. Dapperton sacrifices grainy intimacy in favor of a more accessible singer-songwriter style, settling closer to the adult contemporary umbrella that stretches over artists like Ed Sheeran and Khalid. Flashes of gauzy Mac DeMarco guitars and emo cadences read like not-so-subtle reminders of unearned indie street cred. It’s all very calculated, but it doesn’t quite add up. Dapperton’s potential shines when he pushes himself, when it sounds like he’s making music for self-expression and fun, expanding his vocal range and messing around with reverb. He loses it inside of self-imposed pop formulas and strained symbolism. Certain beats just work better in a seconds-long TikTok dance routine than on headphones. Like many young artists today, Dapperton is under pressure to strike the mood of the moment and achieve virality—to sustain a feedback loop of recommended content. Pop music worked this way long before social media, but as musicians and audiences bend to the will of the feed, the overemphasis on aesthetics feels increasingly pervasive. According to a recent interview, Dapperton’s most treasured albums include the Smiths compilation Hatful of Hollow, Oasis’s (What’s the Story) Morning Glory? and Bon Iver’s For Emma, Forever Ago. This collection makes sense on the surface: three classics of sad-boy rock that look great on a gallery wall. But beyond their covers, each is an example of artists experimenting with sound and vulnerability early in their discography. Maybe, if Dapperton spent more time absorbing and workshopping the ideas that turned his inspirations into phenomenons, he would unlock what sets him apart.","The Brooklyn songwriter’s self-produced second LP is an introduction to the psyche beneath the quirky bowl cut. But its self-imposed pop formulas and strained symbolism reveal little.

Down to the Lowest Terms: The Soul Sessions,Steve Arrington,by: Noah Yoo,Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f5fffa8fa63d0a85b6c883e/1:1/w_160/Down%20to%20the%20Lowest%20Terms-%20The%20Soul%20Sessions_steve%20arrington.jpg,2020-09-21 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/steve-arrington-down-to-the-lowest-terms-the-soul-sessions/,Stones Throw,"Steve Arrington is a true funk legend. At age 64, the singer-songwriter and producer is now on his third go-round in the music industry. Following a star-making stint as the lead vocalist and drummer in Slave, Arrington produced ‘80s hits like “Feel So Real” and “Weak at the Knees” as a solo artist before he left music altogether to become a minister. Though he technically returned at the beginning of the 2010s, Arrington’s new album Down to the Lowest Terms: The Soul Sessions is his first proper solo comeback. Don’t let the retro cover artwork fool you—there are no “soul revival” or fake-funk tracks here. In fact, the polished, modern production flourishes throughout the album serve to highlight how unmatched Arrington’s voice and vitality remain. Recorded entirely at the Stones Throw studio in Los Angeles, Down to the Lowest Terms also doubles as a who’s who of the city’s notable beat scene producers. Label boss Peanut Butter Wolf brought together established figures from the roster (Knxwledge, Mndsgn) and rising talent like versatile bedroom producer Shibo to contribute to the album. Arrington’s voice becomes the banner under which these various musicians ride. They bring a remarkable sonic cohesion to the record, and Arrington rarely contorts himself to fit into these tracks, even though they run the gamut from R&B ballads to crushed lo-fi beats. The best songs give Arrington the room to sprawl out and flex those ever-charismatic vocals, nearly untarnished by the sands of time. Just listen to the cascading background parts on the gleaming slow-burner “Keep Dreamin’” or the tightly-knit scatting passages near the end of “Lord Knows,” one of two tracks that Arrington recorded drums on. Down to the Lowest Terms, especially its first half, is peppered with these kinds of awe-inspiring vocal moments. Hearing him is like watching a veteran tightrope walker take to the slackline for the first time in years and breeze their way through a complex routine. Arrington’s songwriting also remains refreshingly free of cynicism. It doesn’t matter that the stakes are so low on “Good Mood,” once he drops into a wavering, theatrical timbre just to describe how merely thinking of the sun can put a smile on his face first thing in the morning, you’re hooked in. By contrast, the ruminative “Make a Difference” carries on a lineage of political funk by touching upon the legacy of racial oppression in America. “My great-great-grandmama was a slave,” he murmurs at the start. Not every song is so compelling—the dissonant house number “You’re Not Ready” feels like a cutting room floor loosie—but Arrington’s performances have enough swagger to them to carry him through. Elsewhere, the two Knxwledge contributions—“Love is Gone” and “Make Ya Say Yie”—envelop Arrington in crunchy slo-mo soul textures à la NxWorries, and the latter’s loping horn melody lets the soul singer commit to some stellar falsetto runs. The mid-album cut “My Favorite Swing” taps into a style of frenetic jazz similar to that of Thundercat, who Arrington worked with on “Black Qualls.” In the same way Prince cultivated and collaborated with up-and-coming talent throughout his career, Arrington’s willingness to garner inspiration from a younger generation that considers him a formative influence creates a powerful feedback loop of creativity. The songs themselves mostly cover well-trodden ground, but the chemistry and musical dialogue between the funk forefather and his collaborators make Down to the Lowest Terms feel wholly new.","On his first proper comeback album, the funk legend displays his unmatched vocal chops over polished, modern production.

So Glossy and So Thin,Jackson / Baker / Kirshner,by: Marty Sartini Garner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f63d63e50b6e57b54878dc0/1:1/w_160/so%20glossy%20and%20so%20thin_jackson:baker:kirshner.jpg,2020-09-21 05:00:00,Jazz,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/jackson-baker-kirshner-so-glossy-and-so-thin/,Astral Spirits,"Keefe Jackson, Jim Baker, and Julian Kirshner are all lesser-known musicians in Chicago’s perennially rich jazz and free-improv scene, a trio of role players whose innovations have yet to receive their proper appreciation outside of the Windy City. So Glossy and So Thin, their second trio release following 2016’s The Noisy Miner, should change all of that. Taken from a pair of performances at Roscoe Village venue The Hungry Brain in 2018 and 2019, the album’s two 20-minute tracks are a showcase not only for their talents as individuals, but also for the depth of their connection. The ease with which they handle this music makes even their farthest-out moments feel accessible. The joyful spirit behind Jackson, Baker, and Kirshner’s explorations makes So Glossy and So Thin the rare free-jazz album that goes down easy. Part of its charm has to do with how clearly these three enjoy playing with one another. They come off like they’re racing to an agreed-upon location by separate routes. Jackson’s sax and Baker’s piano tease and tickle in the opening moments of “Then,” rolling around like a pair of dogs in a yard. They shift in and out of time with one another, with the rapidly assembled patterns of Kirshner’s drumming providing a kind of mosaic-tiled ground for the other two to race over. At times they pump like a New Orleans funk band, full of footloose swagger and goofy gestures. At others, they bang out stormy pulses and thick, dissonant chords that would be at home on the experimental series of a major symphony orchestra. What links these moments together and keeps So Glossy and So Thin from feeling disconnected is how smoothly they transition from section to section. Once they’ve exhausted “Then”’s opening, the trio deftly glides from all-out clatter to low-volume tinker with the grace of a pelican skimming the ocean, setting the stage for a gorgeous off-blue solo from Jackson. They make it work in reverse, too, raising “and again” from a simmer so slowly you don’t notice how hot things have become until they turn it back down again. That low section in “and again” is one of the album’s most effective moments. It’s built around a long solo from Kirshner, who takes a note from Rashied Ali and treats his cymbals like hanging sound bowls; he keeps them at a steady ring while attending to a nervous pulse out of the kick drum, with a few strokes of tom providing the color. The motion is constant, but Kirshner’s playing is so deft —he taps the bell of the cymbal like he’s testing an egg — it feels like an ASMR recording, or the distant buzz and thump of a highly pitched synthesizer. As if to not be outdone, Baker brings out an actual synthesizer in “and again.” While Sun Ra was incorporating electronics into his music by the early 1960s, and Patrick Gleeson’s modular synths were crucial to the success of Herbie Hancock’s wildest mid-’70s experiments, Baker has over his many years working with the ARP 2600 developed a mode of playing that gives the synth an expressive range as wide as any wind instrument. Stacked against the cough and yawp of Jackson’s sopranino sax, the ARP comes alive. Baker almost seems to be breathing through the machine, making it howl and groan, and teetering between tonality and atonality. Jackson picks around the ARP’s edges, goading Baker deeper and deeper, before breaking off and joining Kirshner’s rattling toms to create a pattern that itself feels like the product of a modular synth. They play in this free space — lines between sax, synth, and drums obliterated — for a few moments, then move on. At its core, So Glossy and So Thin is nothing more than three musicians creating an environment where they can test out some of their best ideas. Remarkably, every single one of them pays off. While the music isn’t simple, it’s always convincing, like watching a movie in a foreign language: Even if you can’t follow the plot, the emotional contours are plain as day.","This Chicago trio makes the rare free-jazz album that goes down easy, playing with a grace that makes even the farthest-out moments feel accessible.

Keyboard Fantasies,Beverly Glenn-Copeland,by: Mina Tavakoli,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f60020cb2d5b619cfead3ea/1:1/w_160/keyboard%20fantasies_beverly%20glenn-copeland.jpg,2020-09-20 05:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/beverly-glenn-copeland-keyboard-fantasies/,self-released,"Just off of U.S. Highway 37 in Sylvania, Ohio, lies a small, butter-colored hamlet of retirees. Its name, “Sunset Village,” suggests that you or your loved ones will enjoy a warm, bucolic, well-reckoned end, should you choose to settle there. Like all retirement centers, Sunset Village comes with a lot of practical provisions: The age for admittance is strictly greater than 55, the majority of properties are for rent, rather than purchase (for obvious reasons), and, based on your need and price point, staff can cater a menu of care options under heartbreaking titles like “memory support.” What comes free and without caveat, however, is the tacit understanding among its people that colonies like these will very likely serve as their last earthly stop before deboarding this mortal coil. Not unlike all-inclusive resorts or monasteries, senior communities are among the most meaningful attempts we’ve got in the sustained pursuit of pinning and freezing time. These are societies interested in life existential, not life chronological. They acknowledge the end at their outset, make peace with the idea of transience, and build entire ecosystems designed to strip life of its formal trappings. Seeing them from this angle might clarify why the often-used, flourishy euphemism “active living community” can feel so bizarre and science-fictional—it throws into relief what sort of living the rest of us do in the meantime. In a satisfying and totally arbitrary coincidence, there exists another sunset village at the end of an equally strange and otherworldly cassette released in 1986. Like the album that houses it—and very much like the Ohioan villa of the same name—“Sunset Village” (side B, final track) also happens to be an arcadian resting place that holds the question of time, and its movement, at its center. The song is fundamentally just a short poem paired alongside a simple synthesized piano melody—not very far from something you would use to hush a baby. Each time I find myself replaying it, I’m freshly amazed by how accurately it manages to recreate the wooziness so inherent to bliss, heartache, or finality, how it definitely holds some spiritual dominion with the fish of the sea and birds of the air, and, with just 11 words, how it teaches the intricate idea that wisdom is just another word for knowing what to accept. It will also bring your pulse rate down to about 40. The artist responsible is Beverly Glenn-Copeland, a man endowed with such rare fortune that he remained more or less a non-entity to the music-curious public until the age of 72 when a particularly influential record collector from Japan sent him a life-altering email asking for any remaining physical copies of his early music. Deep into a peaceful, years-long toil in the Canadian hinterlands with his wife, Copeland was suddenly faced with the task of living his way out of a placid, relatively private existence, and into one in which documentarians tour his home like a museum and take seriously his thoughts on the intersection between science and the divine. Newfangled global interest for Copeland, as you might imagine, is unimaginable. Under the rough and ridiculous circumstances of any life, the fate of late-bloomed fame holds unique surprises. Watching artists like these confront contemporary milestones of success, like good streaming metrics or outpourings of online support, seems to give them an expression permanently set to stupefied. The sizeable hill of praise that’s been furnished onto him across the last two years—mostly from a growing sect of left-field record collectors, a gaggle of celebrities, and those lucky enough to have been gifted URLs to his music by wise friends or lovers—carries a uniformly grateful, even devotional air of protectiveness. “Mostly, I’m eating my Wheaties and all my vitamins so I can perhaps live long enough to finish what it is I’m supposed to be doing here,” he admitted during a lecture two springtimes ago in Montréal. Chalk Copeland’s recent boom up to the inscrutable forces of destiny that slowly pull upon a person over the course of their life. Chalk it up to the easy digestibility, maternal swaddle, and mental asylum so inherent to the sort of music that we now call new age. Chalk it in no small part up to Copeland’s own journey of self-discovery as a transgender man that now aligns neatly with the triumphant contemporary attitude toward publicly articulating one’s complicated identity. Regardless of what exactly set off the recent Copeland rumble, his is a coming-of-age story probably most due to his dreamy, boundless frontierism that sees no encroachment, no fear, and no distinction between anything resembling a beginning or an end. In some ways, it’s a story of inevitability. It may be because his life seems to be governed by, and has always been governed by, a sunset village from the outset. Despite an especially twisty and sometimes glum biography, Copeland appears as serene and composed as a friendly monk. In lieu of robes, his daily uniform includes a button-down shirt, a pair of puffy, pleated chinos, and a scrub of chin fuzz the tint of a long-boiled egg. As seen and heard in the groundswell of videos and interviews with him across the last two years, as well as in harder-to-find footage from more than two decades ago, his voice leaves his mouth with a pleasant moisture—like he is somehow always on the end of a spoon of peanut butter—and is elastic, as prone to characters and impressions as a puppeteer’s. Age and circumstance have made his tone slightly darker, richer, and honeyed the cooler vibrato he had in his 20s, but the thermostat of his manner seems to have always been set to warm. “Father was a brilliant European classical player,” gargles Copeland at the top of his 2019 biopic, also titled Keyboard Fantasies, throwing his head back on a chair and treating the word like mouthwash. Since “cradlehood” (his own charming term), Copeland seems to have been equipped with the twin gifts of promise and idiosyncrasy. His mother, Georgie Willis, who was a formidable pianist and an even more formidable academic, bears the honor of being the first Black woman to complete a graduate program at Penn State University. The pathetic pace of American integration in the 1940s, however, meant that though she could legally attend classes, she was denied the right to live on campus. Fate would install a generous Quaker woman in Mrs. Copeland’s path, who she would go on to live with—thereby allowing her to continue attending Penn State—but the very friendly neighbor would also go on to spiritually move Georgie with the pacific doctrines and credos of Quakerism. It’s why the Copelands joined a Quaker congregation in Philadelphia shortly thereafter, and why Glenn found himself reared in the safety of a community that gave him the clearance to exist in an alternate, sheltered dimension distinct from the more fraught realities that stained so much of Black childhood in late Jim Crow-era America. Georgie held hope that, upon entering a large and foreign city away from the security of their Quaker eden, her child would be seen by the public as both normal and non-threatening. Copeland immediately torpedoed this idea upon entering McGill University in Montréal by becoming the ultimate disaster: He wore his hair afroed, entered into a same-sex relationship, and was introverted to a degree of hermitude. It also probably didn’t help that he was studying European classical music with a penchant for a particular German style called lieder, which sounds a little bit like opera sung by loud, sad angels. To be out, Black, bizarre, and 17 in 1961 was an open invitation to get one’s ass kicked not only literally, but legally: It would be eight more years until Canadian Justice Minister Pierre Trudeau would decriminalize consenting homosexual partnerships (34 years before every state in America would do the same). “At one point,” Copeland says, with the comfortable, breezy tone of someone who has a high capacity for empathy and a near non-existent one for resentment, “my family ganged up on me and forced me into a car and took me to a physician who was going to have me interred in a hospital.” The plan was to give Copeland the then-fashionable electroconvulsive therapy in an attempt to zap the gay out of his head and heart. Others might have treated this episode like a hostage situation, a mortal betrayal, or both, but Copeland, in a flush of grace toward himself and his family, quietly rose from the bed, gathered his stuff, and jogged out the front door before anyone could notice. Once Copeland returned to Montréal, he got serious about getting serious with music, and decided he had had enough of McGill. He dropped his classes and descended upon Toronto, settling luckily alongside a manager and league of total strangers who, he was delighted to figure out in studio sessions later on, made up a small league of Canadian jazz heavyweights. Alongside men like bassist Dough Bush, electric guitarist Don Thompson, drummer Terry Clark, and principal guitarist Lenny Breau, Copeland committed his first noodlings to permanence. Though the two albums he made in the early ’70s were commercial catastrophes, his eponymous 1970 work is a piece that leaves me fundamentally confused by its exclusion from most modern canons. The folk is freaky. The riffs are seraphic. With all the leider residue in his arias and tremolos, these albums feel like songbooks of spirituals for the unspiritual. There have been obvious parallels made to Joni Mitchell in the music’s blueness and timbre—especially in how Copeland warbles like god has just asked him a difficult favor—but a more fitting comparison would be to Judee Sill, an artist who shares with him an alloy of Christian folklore, Bach-indebted chord progressions, and a sense of servitude to a quiet, inarticulable secret. “By and large, the early music was looking at death, love and the difficulty of love,” he once indifferently summed, though I would argue that a track like “Untitled (Make the Answer Yes),” is the sort of song that one could sensibly choose to be buried to. Blindness toward negativity, unfounded optimism, and curious guilelessness are traits not often blent in the same adult in 2020, but at the center of this Venn diagram lives the broad idea of being “childlike.” Copeland is definitely childlike—strange, virtuous, glib, and peaceful—in myriad and impressive ways. The documentary devotes one longish scene to his ritual of enjoying a cup of apple juice before each performance, and it seems, per the frequency of its use in nearly every one of his interviews, that his favorite word is “magic.” It only seems natural that Copeland would have had a career as a sort of jester with a synthesizer on a few children’s television shows while between albums. Young Canadians in 1973 might recognize him costumed in polyester alongside straw-haired, rosy-cheeked, anemic little puppets on Mr. Dressup, a show analogous to (and in fact hosted by the understudy of) the American Mister Rogers. But his work on Dressup meant that he was somewhat in the public eye—and at the time, he performed and lived as female “Beverly,” which made it doubly difficult to reconcile the unplaceable and unsolvable dissatisfaction he carried around. “How would you do that?” he asked of a journalist in 2005. “Walk in one day as Beverly Glenn-Copeland and come back two weeks later as a changed being? I just couldn’t figure out how to do it.” It’s not that Copeland didn’t understand that his body was at odds with his brain at that point, but it wasn’t until 15 years after his initial work on Dressup that he found the language and the wherewithal necessary to give expression to an idea he knew was true since infancy. He was laying on the sand, reading a book, “and I just kind of sat up and went, ‘I am transgender.’ And I had never put those words to it.” In 2002, long departed from Dressup and armed with the fortitude to answer his private riddle, Copeland publicly transitioned to male. The author Andrea Long Chu—a writer, who, in the past few years, has become exceedingly good at substantiating the quandaries of trans personhood for mainstream audiences—puts the amorphous feeling of dysphoria into lucidity by calling the lifelong sensation a “vague but maddening sense that something is off about the world.” In other words, gender incongruence is a slippery yearning, a “hunger without appetite,” a strange, evanescent idea of an achievable but permanently just-out-of-reach reality. It should make a lot of sense that the successful juncture between what seemed like fact, and what seemed like fantasy, would form the central thrust of Copeland’s masterwork, Keyboard Fantasies. In 1983, he traveled to a small cabin in a sleepy village three hours north of Toronto. Ordained by his manager to go off and write something good, he bought and hauled along an Atari computer and two synthesizers—the Roland TR-707 and the Yamaha DX7—eagerly awaiting the prospect of holing up, shoveling snow, and playing with his new machines. Copeland views computers with appropriate humility (“I would walk around and go, ohhh, because I couldn’t do anything with them,” he once said) but feels tantalized, paralyzed by the alternate realities unlockable within them. It’s difficult to overstate how aggressively synthesizers in the ’80s were marketed as portholes to the future—ad copy for incoming makes and models would spend paragraphs positioning them as “Products of the Space Age,” alongside taglines like “Science Fiction? No: Science Fact!” Deep inside the machines were near-to-life versions of the instruments Copeland had studied and honored for so long, but at a supernatural slant. “There were sounds that were acoustic, sounds that only a computer could make, and sounds that could come from a violin,” he explained, but only “if you used a lot of imagination, or squinted your ears.” To Copeland, his machines represented the impossible made perfectly possible. When he first laid eyes on an Atari, he says, “it was like, ‘Oh, so this is the beginning.’” If we emerged from the primordial soup with keytars in hand, Keyboard Fantasies is what our tribal lullabies would sound like. After weeks of sleepless tinkering with his toys, the album was born as a sextet of chuggy, spare, somnambulant pieces built by some of the most basic preset tones from the DX7. The DX7 offers a unique, and, at the time, enthrallingly new alphabet of programmable sounds—so much so that the instrument would go on to feature in most conceivable pop in the ’80s, from the Beverly Hills Cop soundtrack to work by Whitney Houston—but here, the galactic, plummy, and utterly standard “electric piano” setting was put to work across Fantasies’ six tracks, each of which sound like ancient, foundational plainsongs from a dimension not far off from our own. Keyboard Fantasies seems to pureé wisps of cultural sounds into a new Pangea. “Ever New,” the opener, has vibratos as operatic as a lovesick Persian ode, lyrics as if from a self-help pamphlet found in a Bolinas co-op, and pentatonic scales with ascending intervals as spare as Japanese Shōmyō folk. “Winter Astral”—a totally voiceless Rothko of a song—reminds me of Buddhist breathwork in the intervals between Copeland’s lingering pressure on the keyboard. “Old Melody,” a piece that carries the joke of its sheer existence as false indigenous music in its title, is as lucid dream-inducing as alien cradlesong. Like a project under the long-celebrated and well-documented “Fourth World” music umbrella described by frequent Eno collaborator Jon Hassell, Fantasies is filled with “unknown and imaginary regions,” each one helmed by its peaceful and sole inhabitant, Glenn. It’s curious that Copeland has been referred to as an “outsider” artist in recent reviews and breathless press releases. On the one hand, it does seem like a natural, knee-jerk description: the characterization of some art as “outsider” is a term usually ladled onto work that’s seen as unknowing of its own power, either through the artist’s lack of formal training, or a by the nature of its unpretentious existence outside of hoary art-historical canons. More often, however, it’s a title given to those who work in isolation, who have no profit motive, or, in many cases, are marginalized out the gate by their own identities (poor, Black, queer, et cetera). Though Copeland has said that Fantasies carries the “innocence that was part of [his] experience at the time,” there is nothing untrained or undisciplined about it. Classically educated and formally fluent, I suspect it is more a shorthand used because we lack the language to identify something that seems like it accidentally dropped onto Earth. “Sunset Village,” the album’s denouement, is so extraterrestrial, it might single-handedly explain the confusion. The ballad is less a song as it is a viewpoint—a lot like the vertiginous sensation you might feel when looking out of an airplane window onto a quilt of land thousands of feet below. Strangely comforting, sidereal, and on the thin tightrope between alienating and familiar, it’s the strongest unconscious paean to Copeland’s fascination with science fiction. He’s spoken about finding particular calm in the works of David Brin and Isaac Asimov, but not exactly in the mass-market editions interested in slime apocalyptos or glowing squids from Saturn. Instead, Copeland prefers a notion of sci-fi that’s treated more as a defined, earthbound school of thought—one Asimov would clarify in a preface to Octavia Butler’s short story collection, Speech Sounds, the same year Copeland created Keyboard Fantasies. “Science fiction,” Asimov wrote, “is committed neither to marvels nor to disasters. It deals with possible situations.” For as strange and faraway they sound, “Sunset Village” and Keyboard Fantasies writ large present a quiet desire not exactly for escape from this world, but to imagined likelihoods on the most alien planet of all—this one. The idea of elderhood is of enormous significance to Copeland. He mentions it frequently in the documentary, and it crops up reliably across interviews. On several occasions, he salutes “the elders” of the community in Huntsville, Ontario—where his snowy studio was housed—that ""took care of [him]” in the hours of his most vigorous synthesizer mania. The second-most affecting scene of his documentary comes during what looks like a casual Q&A, when a young devotee takes a microphone and thanks Copeland for the honor to share the floor with—gesturing toward Glenn—“our trans elder.” “Ahhh,” intones Copeland, nodding softly, visibly experiencing some sort of apotheosis. “Mmmm.” He takes a beat that feels like a decade. “You think in ways that it’s taken years for me to come to,” he says. “It’s about knowing things I don’t know.” At the far end of several generational gaps to his fanbase, Copeland is aware that there is much more he is unaware about, but there are at least a few things that come with surety. In the documentary’s most unforgettable sequence, Copeland sits peacefully in a metal chair and sobs. It’s moving for a number of reasons, but largely because it seems cruel to have Copeland cry on camera. “I’ve figured out what I’m supposed to do,” he says. “I’m supposed to support these young people.” It firms an idea he once directed to a room full of wide-eyed, hungover fans in an interview released earlier the same year. “Do not fail to give your hearts. Do not fail,” he intoned, nodding toward the crowd. “I’m going to be watching you all from another dimension.” That exact image happens to live on the album art for Keyboard Fantasies. On it, there’s a photo of a stained glass window in wedges of lemon, blue, and plum, framing a silhouette that looks a lot like the back of Copeland’s head facing out onto a shore. It’s too perfect—if nothing else, sight and solace have always been Copeland’s anima. In a life steered by the trying-on of new and strange vantage points, the cover works like a skylight to the clarity of his vision: one unburdened by any system, any path, any idea beyond inhabiting himself most accurately.
 
Stare at that window long enough and you can start to imagine everything—the sea, the sky, the sand, even Copeland—in a state of total suspension, deepened by the light of a sun that seems like it takes forever to set. He has never really needed much to grant him fullness.

Mandinga Times,Rita Indiana,by: Stefanie Fernández,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f64f67945751a4c3a828c2d/1:1/w_160/mandinga%20times_rita%20indiana.jpg,2020-09-19 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/rita-indiana-mandinga-times/,self-released,"In her decade away from music, Rita Indiana returned to writing novels. Her prose, when dealing in speculative and science fiction, often operates at the end of worlds large and small in the wake of personal and political destruction. Her latest album, Mandinga Times, follows suit. Produced by Eduardo Cabra (formerly of the Puerto Rican band Calle 13), Mandinga Times hangs heavier than the flash of 2010’s El Juidero, this time with inflections of the metal scenes and horror movies that gave her a language for queer identity. And every horror movie has its monster. The dembow-meets-metal friction of “Como un Dragón” introduces the album’s protagonist, Mandinga, the soothsayer of an apocalypse atrocious and banal unfolding in real time. (As Pitchfork editor Isabelia Herrera also noted, the word “mandinga” is derived from the name of the Mandinka ethnic group of West Africa, a word whose Caribbean history began in the transatlantic slave trade and still carries racist overtones.) With a face painted in black and white, Mandinga shapeshifts in subterfuge against colonial frameworks of power, spirituality, and storytelling with traditional Afro-Caribbean genres woven in with Indiana’s metal instincts. But it’s on “Mandinga Times” that Mandinga looks outward with apocalyptic clarity: impending climate disaster, the progression of consumerism and late capitalism, violence, persecution, and children in cages. “Tick-tock,” she counts down over a rapid alí-babá beat used in regional Dominican carnavales. She’s joined by an unlikely collaborator, the incredibly popular Dominican dembow artist Kiko El Crazy, whose echoes of the axiom “no te dejes” and “la pámpara” float over the track like a Vincent Price narration in a haunted house. “Power is like a horror movie,” Indiana recently told Pitchfork. It corrupts the body, it feeds on fear. Throughout the record, Mandinga observes this tension from a precarious ledge. “Miedo” is a reggaeton romántico about the intimacy of intense passion and the inseparable threat of violence that targets queer love around the world. On “El Zahir,” named after the 1947 Jorge Luis Borges short story and its titular coin, Indiana illustrates the power on one side of capital and the death on the other. A post-punk riff churns over gagá, an Afro-Dominican rhythm descended from Haiti’s rara, with a deathly interlude from Norwegian musician Sakari Jäntti. In her writing and music, Indiana has scrutinized the Dominican Republic’s legacies of anti-Black and anti-Haitian violence and government corruption, the ways that these hegemonies exert power across the Caribbean and Latin America, and how marginalized peoples resist violence throughout history. Mandinga witnesses the lasting fallout. On Mandinga Times, she frequently references Puerto Rico—where she’s lived for the last decade—and its legacy of anti-colonial resistance. On “The Heist,” Indiana partners with boricua singer MIMA in a Western tale that recounts the $7 million robbery of a Wells Fargo in Hartford, Connecticut in 1983 by Los Macheteros in the name of the movement for Puerto Rican independence. “El Flaco de la Mancha” subverts the quixotic hero’s delusions of grandeur and chivalry, guided instead by art, beauty, and the watch of the Afro-Cuban orisha Yemayá. And on the penultimate track, “Pa’ Ayotzinapa,” Indiana departs musically and geographically from the Caribbean for a rock-en-español bolero with Café Tacvba’s Rubén Albarrán, a story of a pilgrimage to Ayotzinapa, Mexico to honor the 43 disappeared teaching student activists that went missing in Iguala in 2014. Mandinga Times closes on an atypical end for monsters with “Claroscuro”; Mandinga isn’t destroyed and doesn’t evolve out of their monstrosity. By contrast, the reality Mandinga observes is grotesque, a system run by those in power who drape oppression in the myth of normalcy and order. Nothing and no one in Mandinga’s time are free of the responsibility to dismantle systems of oppression. She does not automatically absolve Mandinga either, but she allows them to change, offering something of a final consolation: “Rosas y espinas son parte de una deslumbrante criatura,” or, “Roses and thorns are part of a dazzling creature.”","On her first album in a decade, the Dominican iconoclast delivers an explosive comeback full of horror scenes, metal sounds, and post-colonial politics.

Harvest Vol. 1,Various Artists,by: Nyshka Chandran,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f5ff5b99975341af5435471/1:1/w_160/harvest%20vol%201.jpg,2020-09-19 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/various-artists-harvest-vol-1/,More Rice,"Over the past decade, underground club circuits around East and Southeast Asia have grown from a collection of fragmented markets to an integrated community that’s dedicated to supporting local talents. Projects such as bilateral DJ exchanges and regionally-focused record labels such as More Rice, based in Bangkok, have gone a long way in building cross-border relations and generating a larger Asian fanbase. Some of the fruits of this labor are presented on a new compilation from More Rice, 14 tracks of chugging dancefloor weaponry from South Korea, the Philippines, Thailand and beyond. Harvest Vol.1 isn’t lacking energy, but most tracks are complex slow-burners that make for ideal transitions in a DJ set or deep listening sessions. Take the stand-out “Mirarboles” from up-and-coming Seoul producer Mogwaa, a classically-trained musician whose latest EP dropped earlier this year on More Rice. Mogwaa finds a sweet spot on the synth-funk hook with escalating chords that add a sense of drama, but he also plays around with it, laying the melody with warped effects and hints of squelching acid towards the end. Equally fluid are the lopsided peals of “At The End of Time,” a joint effort by producer Lustbass and drum duo The Hernandez Brothers, both of whom hail from the Philippines. The song is hypnotic, mirroring the meditative energy of Javanese gamelan, a departure from the Hernandez Brothers’ usual funkadelic maneuvers. An effortlessly steady pace is perhaps Harvest’s biggest strength. Introspective house cuts are interspersed with syncopated beats and bassy rollers to produce a harmonious listening experience from start to finish. The first half of Harvest is generally easy listening but that quickly changes when the prolific artist known as Similiarobjects, a heavy-hitter in Manila’s electronic scene, goes down a twisting rabbit hole on “Analogmigraine.” The track gives off a sense of calm despite flurries of tightly-packaged beats and it’s the perfect primer for Karachi-based Rudoh’s “Mo Money,” a breaks-heavy mid-tempo joint that gracefully incorporates snippets of UKG and sudden tempo changes. Despite these highlights, Harvest has pockets of weakness that make it drag on a bit longer than it should. “Still Life” by Filipino artist Saint Guel and “Bang Sue Junction” from Bangkok’s Sarayu, one of the More Rice co-founders, both fall prey to repetitive basslines that sound like fillers to hide gaps in composition. Meanwhile, other tracks such as Snad’s “Put It In My Parenthesis” and “Ham” by Tokyo producer Spanglemann start off compelling but lack sufficient dynamism to justify their six-minute stay. If Harvest seeks to represent a wide spectrum of pan-Asian club music, it could benefit from more stylistic boldness. Genre hybrids are emanating left-and-right in electronic hotspots such as Indonesia and India amid a rising ratio of producers to DJs so there’s no shortage of fresh four-to-the-floor patterns. Still, the fact that Harvest connects the dots between multiple countries makes it stand out from other geographically-oriented compilations across East, South and Southeast Asia that aren’t as wide-ranging. Examples of the latter include the India-centric Kaala Khatta - Flavours Of The East, the all-Indonesian Moda Equator, and the Shenzhen-specific Dragon Bass EP1: Made in Shenzhen. More labels in the region should follow Harvest’s ambitious scope, paving the way for emerging Asian talents to reach wider audiences.","The first compilation from electronic Bangkok label More Rice is a solid collection of chugging dancefloor weaponry from South Korea, the Philippines, Thailand and beyond.

"Cantus, Descant",Sarah Davachi,by: Will Gottsegen,Contributor,"https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f5ff985291a3fedd683e933/1:1/w_160/cantus,%20descant_sarah%20devachi.jpg",2020-09-18 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/sarah-davachi-cantus-descant/,Late Music,"In the December 1960 issue of Arts and Architecture, the critic Dore Ashton described the peculiar experience of encountering Ad Reinhardt’s “black paintings”—a series of 60 x 60” canvases that appear monochrome, but that reveal subtle, multicolored geometries upon close inspection. She suggested that they actively slowed the process of interpretation; you have to stare, hard, to find hints of color in the black. “How singular color can be when so proposed!” wrote Ashton. “How much more inexplicably moving the hue when it is magically coaxed out after long contemplation.” The same could be said for the minimal drones of Sarah Davachi’s new album Cantus, Descant, which, on first blush, scans as her most imposing work to date. Clocking in at 81 minutes and 17 tracks, it’s the first release from Davachi’s new label, Late Music (a partner of Warp), and features recordings from no less than six different organs scattered across North America and Europe. These are long, sinewy pieces, carved from just a few components. They favor slow chord changes and arcane tonalities, and unlike Reinhardt’s paintings, they’re fundamentally durational; like it or not, they demand a fixed amount of time. But there are also secrets lurking just under the surface, and a degree of complexity that’s part and parcel of the music’s stark appearance, like colors coaxed from the black. The entry points shift across the album, but there’s always a way in. The chug of the reed organ on tracks like “Oldgrowth” and “Badlands” generates a persistent background rumble, evoking gentle motion, and the wispy “Passing Bell” folds in faint bells; “Ruminant,” one of the album’s most plainly inviting pieces, puts swells of violin at the fore, which offer an early reprieve. The pipe organ played on the “Stations” series uses meantone temperament, a tuning system typically associated with Renaissance music, lending it a veneer of familiarity, and conjuring images of sprawling, imagined cathedrals. “I like to think of sounds as these worlds that you enter into,” said Davachi in a 2015 interview. “Not as a form of escapism, but rather as an act of emotional or aesthetic disclosure.” Her brand of slow-moving minimalism is still mostly inscrutable, but these sorts of textural variations can feel like a form of disclosure—the vaguest suggestions, guiding us through—and make Cantus, Descant a deceptively generous project. Davachi opens up even further on “Play The Ghost” and “Canyon Walls,” both of which feature her own vocals. In their delicate constitution and emphasis on individual syllables (they can feel like ASMR, at times), they’re reminiscent of Julia Holter, another LA-based composer with a soft spot for Renaissance music. And though her lyrics aren’t quite as finely wrought as Holter’s, Davachi has a knack for simple evocative language. There’s a lovely line on “Canyon Walls” about “a longing to keep those birds/in their deep ruin green”; the meaning is elusive, but the undertones reverberate. Davachi has been putting out music in this vein for the past few years, insisting on slowness and careful rumination across a range of instruments and electroacoustic modes. She’s scarily prolific (she’s released three EPs already this year), but with Cantus, Descant, Davachi has arrived at maybe her purest distillation of those ideals. The attention to detail is itself a kind of time warp; in its patient hold, the music becomes something entirely new.","The minimalist composer-performer’s slow, patient works demand and reward close attention; give them time, and their secrets will rise slowly to the surface.

DJ-Kicks,Avalon Emerson,by: Andy Beta,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f638072e02f93220b672069/1:1/w_160/Avalon%20Emerson%20-%20DJ-Kicks.jpg,2020-09-18 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/avalon-emerson-dj-kicks/,!K7,"When Avalon Emerson and her girlfriend made a cross-country road trip from Los Angeles to New York this summer, they shot a set of impromptu videos that neatly encapsulate Emerson's musical choices and mixing style: kinetic, evocative, and deeply personal. The terrain is both ever changing and continuous; speed is its own reward. Rarely veering away from 132 BPM, Emerson constantly blurs the line between the ecstatic and the anxious. In recent years, Emerson has been more active as a DJ than a producer, but her DJ-Kicks set slots in four new tracks from her (as well as a remix of Austra), swiftly roving between breakbeats, abstract techno, electro, and leftfield pop, and even detouring into sweaty dance punk. For those familiar with her run of breathtaking techno tracks, the opening selection is the equivalent of screeching brakes. “I’m not a vibeman,” Emerson has said about her DJ style, and the startlingly faithful cover of the Magnetic Fields’ “Long Forgotten Fairytale” that she kicks off with dares to infuriate techno purists while speaking to Emerson’s ear and sense of craft. No matter how wild and abstract her productions can get, there’s always a melodic thread that holds it all together. Those diametrically opposed yet sympathetic elements are evident as the arpeggios of “Long Forgotten Fairytale” morph into the anthemic swirls and stretched putty of another new production, “Wastelands & Oases.” The chopped blips and snares of Waveforms’ “Breakers in Space” recall classic breakcore, but with a dreamy synth line undulating just beneath the hectic surface. So when the mix opens into the broad vistas of Emerson’s own “Rotting Hills,” the effect is especially lush, like clouds breaking to reveal a sunny day. Throughout, Emerson gravitates toward synth textures that can feel crystalline and lucid one moment, barbed and abrasive the next, as when a glassy background turns gnarled as the Knife member Olof Dreijer’s techno side project Oni Ayhun lurches to life. Distorted, dark, and jumbled, it just as quickly veers right back into the sleek, SOPHIE-like pop of Oklou’s “Just Level 5 Cause It’s Cute.” Pulled from the artist’s Soundcloud page, it’s a giddy early highlight; Emerson reaches this plateau without any kick, her ascent powered by delirious arpeggios alone. Sweet little lyrical snatches give off a feeling of contentment, as when the sped-up vocal lifted from S.O.S. Band’s “The Finest” hammers home the admission: “Time flies when you’re with me.” But just as often, what would otherwise sound heart-quickening intensifies into something anxious: The distorted disco strings of Smith & Hack and Soundstream are ratcheted up until their high frequencies trigger bouts of vertigo. Release comes in the form of the two scruffy dance-punk cuts that pay tribute to two crucial dance-music scenes. Considered one of the founding tracks of Detroit techno, A Number of Names’ “Sharevari” gets a loving, sweaty, spot-on cover from the Dirtbombs, right down to Mick Collins’ European-by-way-of-Dracula delivery. Emerson blends that into !!!’s psychedelic “Hello? Is This Thing On?” A song by the Sacramento band remixed by a former member of San Francisco’s Wicked crew (though dating from when both parties had decamped for early-’00s NYC), it’s a claustrophobic highlight that gives way to another Emerson original. Burbling and bright, “Poodle Power” suggests she may have been spending time with Mort Garson’s early synthesizer experiments like Plantasia. Emerson’s remix of Austra’s “Anywayz” winds down the set. Much like the Oklou track at the mix’s midway point, it favors a nearless beatless atmosphere, giving way to Katie Stelmanis’s Enya-like vocals and the ambient sound of rain. Though the set rarely lets up, Emerson finally takes her foot off the gas at the end, giving us a moment to breathe deep and take in the landscape. Only then can you see how far and fast her DJ-Kicks set has really traveled.","The American DJ, known for her breathtaking, hyperkinetic club anthems, delivers a wide-ranging, shape-shifting set of techno, breakbeats, and leftfield pop.

Apparition Paintings,David Toop,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f5ffc580706068286300f36/1:1/w_160/apparition%20paintings_david%20toop.jpg,2020-09-18 05:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/david-toop-apparition-paintings/,Room40,"“Music is a memory machine,” David Toop wrote in The Quietus in May. The British composer, improviser, author, and scholar was talking about the COVID-19-related deaths of fellow experimental-music elders, but that declaration has the ring of a time-honored maxim, and it’s about as close as one could come to summarizing a 50-year career that ranges from the esoteric pages of The Wire to a pioneering book on rap, from Brian Eno’s Obscure Records to Top of the Pops. The line echoes Roger Ebert’s famous aphorism about movies and empathy, and it shows why Toop is as distinguished in his recondite sphere as Ebert was in his popular one: They both believe their chosen art form has a specific, morally weighted, urgently human function. A veteran global field recorder, Toop is as much a conservationist as an ethnomusicologist, and the thousands of baroque intellectual inquiries he has raised might be said to rest on one burningly clear, almost instinctive question: How much of this world can be perceived and saved? Apparition Paintings, a new album that’s great both for newcomers to Toop and to sound collage in general, is more than just canning audio preserves for the long winter. For that, turn to Field Recording and Fox Spirits, also new, from the same label. The illustrated book features dozens of pages of dizzying Toop talk with Room40 label head Lawrence English; an accompanying CD amounts to a sonic biography comprising unvarnished recordings (a Beijing street in 2005, a certain wasp in 1971), improvisations on the kinds of sculptural instruments people are always inviting Toop to play, and other raw materials that form his compositions. There are also conversations with subjects as diverse as Ornette Coleman and Toop’s grandfather, who said, as the cassette tape rolled in 1979, “My memory is not what it used to be, David,” succinctly stating the impetus behind Toop’s prodigious recording life. If the phrase “sound collage” makes you despair of listening to someone untangling a mess of wire hangers while a kettle whistles in the next room, that’s fair. There is a lot of sound collage like that, which counts on the listener’s imaginative labor, the idea of boredom as a kind of medal, or the fear of not getting something other people claim to get. But while layer upon layer of arcane knowledge encrusts these songs—“‘Apparition painting’ is the term used to describe a certain type of ancient Chinese painting of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries,” a typical Toop sentence might begin—the album is strangely accessible and well rounded, full of rich, tactile environments that evoke vivid spaces and nothing unfinished or haphazard. Throughout Apparition Paintings, which features contributions from Elaine Mitchener, Keiko Yamamoto, Rie Nakajima, and others, Toop gathers live instrumentation, field recordings, percussive sounds, and non-English vocalizations, then pries them from their frames of reference and fuses them into mercurial, dreamlike unities. Their surfaces are scored with the eclectic elements of Toop’s background, which includes recording shamans in rainforests, cracking the U.S. and UK charts in the Flying Lizards with a skronky no-wave cover of Barrett Strong’s “Money,” releasing pioneering ambient albums on Brian Eno’s label, and writing books that trace the genre all the way back to Debussy. The genuinely poetic titles Toop plucks from classic books and films speak of relatable emotional contents, though it’s easy to read too much or too little into them: “Maybe these titles, torn as they are from cinema screens and the pages of literature and philosophy, give a feeling of romantic or sexual love or some dark pool of nostalgia but that’s not it,” Toop ponders, unwinding the sentence for almost 300 words before coming to the heart of the matter: “All I desire is what already exists or once existed, now falling asleep outside the world.” As for those teeming contents, where to begin? There are lustrous waves of bass and high-desert guitars in “You could touch him but he wasn’t there,” dubby warps and wobbles in “Tiny human figurines made from sand. If you held these to your ear, you heard soft sweet music,” and tuned filter snaps pelting bells on “A ghost traveling half a mile from its own shape.” There are stereo pops on eerie clouds, glimmering jazz chords, and sprays of vocal fricatives. There are bamboo flutes and snail-shell whistles, all manner of shoes and ships and sealing wax, and moments of clarifying force: Huge power chords divulge drones in “She fell asleep somewhere outside the world,” and “All I desire” is a big, glossy chillwave number that would do Toro y Moi proud. It figures that the record’s starkest pop moment would evoke a genre chiefly concerned with memory—its sweetness, its pain, its lies, its decay. Like human minds, Toop’s music is profoundly antilinear, and the academic façade conceals a decidedly visceral impulse: “Time moving brings us closer to death and a lot of music is time moving,” Toop tells English in the book. “I love that feeling but I also love to work with temporalities of suspension and scattering, circularity and stillness.” Apparition Paintings is evidence of a journey in sound beyond the technical, theoretical, or even spiritual realm, where many a seeker fetches up, onto a rarified but primal perch where everything that falls asleep outside the world awakes. It would take too many lifetimes to figure out what it all means, but listening and remembering is meaning enough.","The veteran British composer, improviser, author, and scholar assembles a dreamlike, mercurial album of sonic collage that doubles as a philosophical treatise on sound and memory.

Fly Moon Die Soon,Takuya Kuroda,by: Dean Van Nguyen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f5ff2119975341af543543a/1:1/w_160/fly%20moon%20die%20soon_takuya%20kuroda.jpg,2020-09-18 05:00:00,Jazz,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/takuya-kuroda-fly-moon-die-soon/,First World,"Takuya Kuroda hails from Kobe, Japan, a nation that to a dedicated strand of Western jazz obsessive serves as a sacred tomb of rare riches. You can place the trumpeter next to 20th-century Japanese virtuosos such as Toshiko Akiyoshi, Masabumi Kikuchi, Ryo Fukui, and Koichi Matsukaze, and he looks extremely comfortable in the lineage: All respected the core tenets of jazz while offering their own unique interpretations. Kuroda, after all, is a guy who has name-dropped Lee Morgan as an inspiration while playing in DJ Premier’s touring outfit, the Badder band. Having relocated to New York to study jazz and contemporary music at The New School in the mid-2000s, Kuroda has since traversed the city as a recording artist—he notably spent some time on Blue Note Records—and musician for hire. Sixth album Fly Moon Die Soon is the work of a man who has undertaken his own musical Gulliver’s Travels. The album’s nine cuts are united by Kuroda’s determination to branch out from jazz and into hip-hop, funk, Afrobeat, electronica, and neo soul. But Kuroda isn’t simply quoting corners of his own record collection; he skillfully synthesizes his influences, hitting sweet spots that feel purely of his own creation. Most apparent is the music of 1970s West Africa (Kuroda has previously collaborated with a group of similar interest in New York’s Akoya Afrobeat). The horns, guitar stabs, and rattling percussion of “ABC” gesture heavily toward Fela Kuti, while the driving rhythms of “Moody” recalls 1970s Afro-funk bands like the Funkees and Monomono. The brass instruments throughout Fly Moon Die Soon are often used to deploy catchy riffs, Kuroda’s trumpet frequently amalgamating with Corey King’s trombone. The title track shows a more experimental side, with programmed beats and a Moog bassline that swirls like a Thundercat jam. It’s the kind of dense and cosmic jazz hybrid that would blow minds over at Brainfeeder. Kuroda allows his collaborators significant space. King’s singing voice comes in and out of the album with mixed results—his textured tones skip satisfyingly through opener “Fade,” but “Change,” the least impressive tune on the album, features a hiccuping melody that goes nowhere in a hurry. Much better is the cover of the Ohio Players’ “Sweet Sticky Thing,” featuring Russia-born singer Alina Engibaryan. Retaining the sensual melody and cranking up the heat until it’s balmy, it’s the kind of track you can put on a playlist that might grab a non-jazz fan’s attention. Then there’s the Herbie Hancock composition “Tell Me a Bedtime Story,” which pushes Hiroshima pianist Takeshi Ohbayashi front and center as he plays over the softly bumping backdrop. Kuroda, meanwhile, unleashes a flugelhorn solo that evokes some vintage urban-noir vision of Manhattan. Coming late on Fly Moon Die Soon, it returns the ever-journeying artist to the city that has proved his fulcrum, and asserts that Kuroda’s skill is not drawing influence from so many different forms, it’s radiating joy in doing so.","The Japanese trumpeter’s dense and cosmic sixth album blends jazz with Afrobeat, hip-hop, neo-soul, and funk.

How Ill Thy World Is Ordered,Daniel Romano,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f5b8f2624167c1baabf7be9/1:1/w_160/how%20ill%20thy%20world%20is%20ordered_daniel%20romano's%20outfit.jpg,2020-09-17 05:00:00,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/daniel-romano-how-ill-thy-world-is-ordered/,You've Changed,"Already this year, Daniel Romano has released nine records, possibly with more on the way. Technology has made prolificity less impressive, but what distinguishes this Ontario firebrand’s flooding of the market isn’t the quantity of new music, but the quality. Everything he’s done this year—including a book of love poetry—is reasonably good to pretty great, and at best a compelling document of a musician working at the height of his imaginative powers. More than that, there’s the dizzying range of sounds and styles on those nine releases, none of which even dig into the neo-trad country on which he staked his reputation in the 2010s. On Forever Love’s Fool, a single, 20-minute song featuring Tool’s Danny Carey, Romano wears prog rock like an oversize foam cowboy hat. His Super Pollen EP is a power-pop extravaganza recorded with members of Fucked Up and Jade Hairpins, while Spider Bite is a one-off punk explosion featuring the Constantines’ Steve Lambke (his You’ve Changed co-founder). How Ill Thy World Is Ordered is the culmination of this hodgepodge of side hustles, mostly because Romano manages to integrate so many disparate genres into one rip-roaring rock record. He’s not always successful in his syntheses—the whimsy sometimes feels shoehorned in—but a seamless integration of styles isn’t what he’s after. Romano wants you to hear these songs as high-wire acts, feats of derring-do with real stakes. The album leaps jubilantly between the styles covered on his previous nine releases, and just for kicks he adds a few more. One minute he’s Gram Parsons reciting Shakespearean sonnets; the next Romano and his backing band the Outfit sound like the Raspberries protesting in front of the White House. “Joys Too Often Hollow” begins as roadtrip folk-rock, with Ian Romano’s drum counting the highway lines and Mark Lalama’s organ evoking the sunset they’re driving into. The song fades out, then fades in again when you flip the record: The guitar fuzz on side two opener “Joys Too Often Hollow Pt. Two” suggests they’re now traversing rockier terrain. These are deeply, and in some cases overly, familiar sounds, yet through sheer force of will Romano and his Outfit put them across as fresh, often exciting, occasionally subversive. When he and his backing band met in the studio, they decided to record the album live and in order of sequencing. More dauntingly, they gave themselves only three takes to get it right and denied themselves any overdubs. The seat-of-pants strategy feeds the album’s sense of urgency, speeding from one riff, melody, and idea to the next. The pace can be dizzying. It’s as though the band can’t wait to finish a song, and once they do, they don’t pause for breath before jumping into the next one. They’ve barely had a chance to hit the final note of “Green Eye-Shade” before the blustery horns of “First Yoke” burst in. Even before “Drugged Vinegar” breaks down into a round of rapturous applause, How Ill has already succumbed to and recovered from its own cleverness many times. But the album is never just clever. Romano might write in knotty syntax (check the album title) with archaic words (check the album title again), but the power he’s speaking truth to feels current and real. His anger and his worry sound genuine. And while there’s always risk in reading an album in light of current events—especially particularly dire ones—it’s not hard to hear Romano’s songs about perseverance and confusion as pandemic consolations, a warm hand on your shoulder from a guy kick-jumping off a drum riser. By the time the second-to-last song rolls around, a barbed and wounded tune called “No More Disheartened by the Dawn,” he manages to summon a bit of hard-won hope, which bleeds into the gentle closer “Amaretto and Coke.” “No matter what the days provoke, amaretto and Coke,” Romano sings over the band’s sloshed sway. It’s a fitting end to an album about doing whatever it takes to get by, whether that’s a cocktail or another weirdo record.","The Ontario musician caps a prolific year with his tenth album of 2020: a rip-roaring rock record that draws on a hodgepodge of styles and sounds, from blustery horns to roadtrip folk-rock.

Sunday Painter,Spencer Zahn,by: Marty Sartini Garner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f5ff02df0d7e171f003aec5/1:1/w_160/sunday%20painter_spencer%20zahn.jpg,2020-09-17 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/spencer-zahn-sunday-painter/,Cascine,"On his first two albums, Spencer Zahn was alone with a synthesizer. For his latest, he got together some friends. Sunday Painter, the bassist’s first album as a bandleader, features contributions from a range of artists, including Brazilian percussionist Mauro Refosco (David Byrne, Dirty Projectors, Atoms for Peace) and guitarist Dave Harrington (Darkside). Taking inspiration from the luminary ECM Records, Zahn’s explicit goal was to put together an ensemble nimble enough to turn the recording space itself into a collaborator. But where the whitewashed gallery walls of classic ECM spotlit individual players’ poise and precision, Sunday Painter has the exhausted living-room energy of a group of college buds determined to stay up ’til sunrise: It’s a little sleepy, a little on edge, but more than anything content simply to be in the same place as good people. As a bandleader, Zahn is far from pushy. Like fellow bassist Sam Wilkes, he seems to take the concept of the rhythm section seriously: His role here is to create stable environments for his collaborators to play around with. This is something they frequently elect not to do, instead working to augment these settings further; there aren’t solos so much as shifts of emphasis. When this works, it can be breathtaking. “Key Biscayne” is as humid as its South Florida namesake, with raindrops of piano tapping away at a looping pattern as distant thunderclaps from Refosco dot the landscape. Everything takes its time decaying. Cymbal crashes, hoarse notes from Spencer Ludwig’s trumpet, casually offered asides from a piano—it all hangs in the room for so long that even the simplest phrases start to carry the weight of maxims. But the emphasis on world-building, as opposed to soloing or more melodic pursuits, can keep the stakes low in a way that occasionally makes these songs feel stale. “The Mist” is spiked with a splash of organ that comes off like Miles Davis’ “Shhh/Peaceful” moving at a speed-walk pace as the group feels its way along a rocky coastline with only Refosco’s wayfinding bells to guide them. Once the scene is established, Ludwig and Harrington both step into the spotlight, but neither has much to say; with the band having assembled the mood so expertly, their leads both feel like they’re simply reiterating a point that’s already been made. Throughout, Zahn’s bass resembles a lightning rod, the one tall and sturdy thing that’s always standing, even when the rest of the band bends as low to the ground as they can. His playing is accomplished—he’s toured as a sideman with Empress Of, Twin Shadow, and Half Waif, in addition to Harrington—but never showy, and it’s always in service of the song. He allows himself a bit of indulgence in “Empathy Duet,” where his solo is shrouded in threadbare electronics, and he provides the emotional backing to “Roya,” a song that blooms from a dusky strut into a slow-motion heartbreaker that wouldn’t sound out of place on Broken Social Scene’s self-titled record. With an emphasis on intimacy, interplay, and enclosed space, this group excels at low-slung love songs, the kind of thing you’d put on to laze away the afternoon with your beloved. On “To the One You Love,” Zahn’s bass takes big gulps of air while the band brews up a pillowy ether. It’s one of Sunday Painter’s most effective tracks, moving from sweet charm to internal dissonance to mature intimacy—a nice mirror of love’s evolution, all unfolding at a gauzy crawl. Even “Promises,” Ludwig’s brief duet with saxophonist Michael McGarril, is little more than a dance between the two horns, each tracing lines around the other. If Zahn’s goal was to make a record that takes on the characteristics of its environment, he’s succeeded. Sunday Painter never stops feeling like exactly what it is, which is the sound of a group of supremely talented musicians just happy to be in a room together. Zahn has a compelling vision as an arranger and composer, and he’s assembled a group that’s more than capable of carrying it out. Still, the collective playing here can be so entrancing you can’t help but wonder where they might have gone if they’d ventured outside.","Joined by players including percussionist Mauro Refosco and guitarist Dave Harrington, the New York bassist takes atmospheric cues from classic ECM productions while evoking relaxed, low-key vibes.

voyage au soleil,numün,by: Dave Segal,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f639bbea27145b1853803b0/1:1/w_160/numun_voyage_au_soleil_album_cover.jpg,2020-09-17 05:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/numun-voyage-au-soleil/,Musique Impossible,"Numün’s first album, voyage au soleil, works in a stealthy, unobtrusive way. The band’s use of lowercase letters in their name and titles isn’t mere affectation; it’s a reflection of their introverted, sly methodology. Bassist Bob Holmes of the cosmic country band SUSS and guitarist Joel Mellin and percussionist Chris Romero of Gamelan Dharma Swara have arrived at a rarefied strain of instrumental music that has the air of a purifying ritual, blending the opiated psychedelia of Brightblack Morning Light with a loose-limbed minimalism that privileges subtle effects and incremental chord progressions. They achieve these results through instruments traditionally alien to rock, such as dholak, Theremin, gongs, and gender wayang. Album-opener “tranceport” epitomizes this approach; it fades in with a feather-light drone, taking Brian Eno’s Apollo to church and to an even deeper quadrant of space. (The LP’s title translates as “trip to the sun.”) With its reverberant, two-chord bass plucks criss-crossed with the squawks of a cümbüş (a fretless Turkish banjo), Mellotron whorls, and tambourine-enhanced beats, “tranceport” morphs into a beatific psych-rock procession redolent of Chocolate Watch Band’s “Voyage of the Trieste.” By the time the second track, “first steps”—a radiant slice of East-West psychedelia devoid of the tired tropes typically associated with this gambit—you realize that numün’s innate peacefulness guides their every move. Augmented by a snippet of astronauts conversing with President Nixon during the first moon landing (it’s jarring to hear the latter’s voice in such a blissful setting), “tranquility base” achieves liftoff through shimmering tones created by a synth version of a celeste and methodical bass riffs that add a riveting contrast and ballast to the track’s delicately beautiful atmospheres. On their debut album, numün have created a suite of becalming songs that move at a tempo slower than a resting pulse while seemingly striving for a sacred quality. Much music in this vein has a tendency to lull you to sleep or to cloy, but voyage au soleil reveals numün as savvy navigators of paths less traveled.","The debut from this instrumental trio has the air of a purifying ritual, blending psychedelia with a loose-limbed minimalism.

Hard Luck Stories (1972-1982),Richard and Linda Thompson,by: Stephen Thomas Erlewine,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f5fa9f6e02f93220b671e70/1:1/w_160/hard%20luck%20stories_richard%20and%20linda%20thompson.jpg,2020-09-17 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/richard-and-linda-thompson-hard-luck-stories-1972-1983/,UMCUniversal,"Hard-luck stories are one of Richard Thompson’s specialties. He honed the skill in the 1970s, writing songs with the knowledge that his wife Linda would provide the sugar to sweeten his salt. From a certain perspective, the tale of Richard and Linda Thompson—a partnership that intertwined romance and creativity—is itself a hard-luck story, one plagued by missed opportunities and bad breaks, and culminating in a public divorce. The eight-disc box set Hard Luck Stories (1972-1982) tells this tale in full, adding a host of rarities to the six studio albums the duo released during their decade as collaborators. It’s the rare box set where the rarities feel integral to the compilation’s impact, tying up loose ends and illuminating areas previously shrouded in darkness. During their time together, the Thompsons always seemed to be on the verge of greater recognition, yet success eluded them. Some of this can be blamed on circumstances beyond their control: Their debut, I Want to See the Bright Lights Tonight, was held back from the marketplace during the oil shortage of the early 1970s, not appearing in the UK until 1974; it wouldn’t surface in the U.S. until 1976, when it was added as a bonus LP on the since deleted Live (More or Less). Their attempts at bolder, brighter music—1978’s First Light and the following year’s Sunnyvista—satisfied neither the curious nor the dedicated. Once they finally started to gain a wider audience with 1982’s Shoot Out the Lights, the couple’s partnership fell apart; they promoted the album with an American tour even though it was clear that they were long past the end. All these unlucky turns have tended to cast a pall over the entirety of the duo’s career, as if they were fated to a miserable ending. Certainly, this impression is strengthened by Richard’s proclivity for sad songs and gloom, but Thompson was too guarded and flinty to traffic in open autobiography—even though his music was so unadorned, it was easy to conflate the two. Linda Thompson helped draw distinctions between the writer and the singer, with a clear, keening voice that stood as a counterpoint to Richard’s gruffness. The first disc of Hard Luck Stories shows a chemistry that was evident at the start, collecting scraps and strays from 1972, the year Richard Thompson left his groundbreaking British folk-rock group Fairport Convention. As he bided his time with the Bunch, a folk-rock supergroup masterminded by Fotheringay’s Trevor Lucas, he was accompanied by Linda Peters, his romantic partner since the end of the 1960s. Somewhere between the Bunch, sessions for Richard’s first solo album, and a series of live performances (some captured here), the couple found time to marry. Once Henry the Human Fly proved to be an ignominious beginning to his career—legend has it that it was the poorest seller at Reprise Records at that point—the Thompsons formalized their collaboration, touring British folk clubs as a pair and cutting an album together. The resulting I Want to See the Bright Lights Tonight is exquisite, balancing the black depths of “Withered and Died” with the spiritual deliverance of “When I Get to the Border.” Omens and misfortune give the record a heavy, foreboding heart, yet the music never quite descends into grimness. Hope lingers on the edges of the title track; the entire affair benefits from the way the Thompsons, surrounded by a sympathetic collection of supporting players, let this otherwise fatalistic, earthbound music breathe. Some of the gloom lifted on the subsequent Hokey Pokey, in which tempos can be jaunty and the songs often play like gimlet-eyed character sketches. Much of the album feels steeped in old British folk traditions—“Smiffy’s Glass Eye” sways like a sea shanty—yet where I Want to See the Bright Lights Tonight appears to float outside of time, Hokey Pokey carries scant evidence of its era. “Georgie on a Spree” lopes along on rounded edges, “The Egypt Room” gets considerable mileage out of its desert trappings, and there’s a slight hippie haze to the ballads, particularly the spiritually settled “A Heart Needs a Home."" By the time Hokey Pokey hit stores in 1975, the Thompsons had converted to Sufism, a sect of Islam that renounced materialism in favor of introspection. Fittingly, Pour Down Like Silver, the album the duo recorded prior to an extended retreat in a Sufi community, is an inward affair. So slow and stately that the rhythm section often provides as much texture as momentum, Pour Down Like Silver wears its austerity with pride. Unlike previous Richard Thompson compositions, songs don’t dwell upon dark twists of fate; sadness is felt deeply but then let go. Soon, Richard and Linda Thompson let music itself go. Upon the encouragement of Richard’s religious mentor, the duo abandoned the stage and the studio to pursue a monastic life within the confines of their chosen community (which, as both Thompsons have stressed over the years, was not a commune). Linda grew impatient with this lifestyle first, but it wasn’t until Richard decided to return to music that they left their community behind to resume their career. A clutch of unreleased live versions of otherwise unrecorded songs from their 1977 comeback tour are featured on the fifth disc of Hard Luck Stories. They tell a fascinating tale in which the duo pursues a shaggy hybrid of folk, funk, jazz, and Middle Eastern music. Thompson later dismissed these tunes, claiming, “some songs deserve to fall off the radar,” yet these performances, however unwieldy, are a vital transition between the stillness of Pour Down Like Silver and its burnished successor, 1978’s First Light. On First Light, the two abandoned their ragged fusion in favor of a streamlined folk rock so polished it could almost be classified as soft rock. Spirituality remained a paramount concern in Richard’s songwriting, but his intent could be hard to discern beneath the layers of studio varnish. Still, these gleaming surfaces help highlight the underlying sweetness of Linda’s voice, and some songs cut through the gloss, such as the wistful “Pavanne” and “Layla,” which is so loose, it’s nearly funky. “Layla”—not a cover of Eric Clapton’s song of the same name—pointed toward the lively Sunnyvista, the 1979 LP that closed out their ill-fated stint at Chrysalis Records. Bright and brash, Sunnyvista plays like a breezy riposte to the duo’s heavy-hearted masterworks; even the slow-crawling “Sisters” skirts the pain that lies at its core. It’s the rare Richard and Linda Thompson record that engages with contemporary sounds and ideas. When Sunnyvista didn’t snag a new audience for the Thompsons, Chrysalis dropped the duo. Fellow British folk rocker Gerry Rafferty offered to bankroll a new album, but Richard bristled at the “Baker Street” hitmaker pushing his duo too far into the middle of the road. The experience still seems to sting the Thompsons: Only a few songs from the scrapped album, dubbed Rafferty’s Folly by fans, appear on Hard Luck Stories, all of which are familiar from other CD reissues. Scrounge up some of the rejected cuts floating around on the internet, such as the original take on the tense, propulsive “Don’t Renege on Our Love,” and it’s easy to hear why they didn’t make the cut: They’re stiff and lifeless in a way Richard and Linda Thompson never were again. Once every label passed on Rafferty’s project, the Thompsons reunited with Joe Boyd, the original producer of Fairport Convention, to re-record the songs for the album that became Shoot Out the Lights. Shoot Out the Lights hangs heavy in the legacy of Richard and Linda Thompson: It was their first album to garner a significant audience in America and the last they recorded together. The divorce followed so swiftly after the album’s release that the record is sometimes said to have been made as the couple separated, which isn’t quite true. Certainly, it doesn’t take a close listen to determine these are songs written by a man whose restlessness is overtaking his spirit. If Thompson winds up pitying himself a bit too much on “A Man in Need,” “Did She Jump or Was She Pushed?”—one of only two songs in their catalog co-written by both musicians—acts as its soulful counterbalance, placing blame for a decaying relationship squarely at the feet of the man beset by wanderlust. Richard and Linda Thompson closed Shoot Out the Lights—and their joint career—with “Wall of Death,” a song whose central metaphor compares romance to an amusement park ride. The song opens with the refrain, “Let me ride on the Wall of Death one more time”; the line could be interpreted as a desire to give romance another shot, or to run out and find new love. Richard chose the latter route, but his relationship with Linda persists to this day. She invited him to play on her 2002 comeback Fashionably Late, and in 2014 the pair formed the band Family with their son Teddy and daughter Kami, along with various extended relatives. The latter-day mending of fences somewhat tempers the myth of turmoil that hangs over Shoot Out the Lights, and it’s to Hard Luck Stories’ credit that there’s a hint of that reconciliation in the box’s conclusion, in which the duo can be heard tearing through a rendition of Jerry Lee Lewis’s “High School Confidential” taken from their final tour from 1982. The selection neatly dovetails with another rock’n’roll oldie that opens the set (a barreling version of Chuck Berry’s “Sweet Little Rock & Roller” by the Bunch), but it’s more than a nifty trick of sequencing. “High School Confidential” illustrates how Richard and Linda Thompson could conjure joy even during their darkest hour, underscoring Hard Luck Stories’s greatest lesson: No matter how high the peak nor how low the valley, the two musicians never lost their incandescent chemistry.","An eight-disc box set tells the complete story of the talented yet star-crossed UK folk-rock duo, tying up loose ends and illuminating areas previously shrouded in darkness.

Goats Head Soup,The Rolling Stones,by: Stuart Berman,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f5fabfbf0d7e171f003aec3/1:1/w_160/goats%20head%20soup_rolling%20stones.jpg,2020-09-16 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/the-rolling-stones-goats-head-soup/,Interscope,"In the period spanning 1968’s Beggars Banquet to 1972’s Exile on Main Street, the Rolling Stones’ title of “World’s Greatest Rock‘n’Roll Band” was less a boastful marketing slogan and more of a plainly self-evident job description. If the Stones started out as rambunctious kids with a press-hyped bad-boy image, by the turn of the ‘70s, the band had acquired a truly sinister aura, the kind of malevolence that had amassed rap sheets, body counts, and iconoclastic admirers eager to feed off their black magic. Not only had the Stones outlasted their rivals in The Beatles, they had become a band that could seemingly do no wrong, even when they were doing things that were very wrong. But if Exile on Main Street represented a seance-like communion with their most sacred old-school influences (blues, gospel, country), Goats Head Soup was where the spell was broken and the Stones had to contend with the fact that they were a veteran band entering their second decade amid a rapidly changing musical landscape. Glam rock was setting new standards for provocation and transgression, while the fiercest, grittiest street music was coming from the world of funk. So on Goats Head Soup, the Stones landed somewhere between the New York Dolls and Isaac Hayes, straining to push themselves to new heights of campy outrageousness while seriously engaging with the contemporary Black music of the day in a way that would have a lasting effect on their rhythmic DNA. Even though work on Goats Head Soup began with producer Jimmy Miller mere months after Exile wrapped up, the conditions of their creations couldn’t have been more different. Exile may have been famously been recorded in the humid, moldy basement of Keith Richards’ French villa, but those extreme conditions created a sense of freewheeling, all-in camaraderie that—for all its heroin-hazy atmosphere—exuded a genuine sense of joy, an all-night bender where everyone’s wine glasses are overflowing and so are the toilets. Goats Head Soup was a far more disjointed experience, its recording locations—Kingston, London, Los Angeles—indicative of a band that was starting to drift apart. Following his marriage to Bianca Pérez-Mora Macías, Mick Jagger was becoming the toast of the society pages and firming up his place in the A-list celebrity establishment; Keith Richards, by contrast, was holing himself up in a Swiss rehab clinic to put the brakes on a worsening heroin habit. As a result, the once-telepathic songwriting team of Jagger-Richards was becoming more like Jagger-or-Richards. “I think Mick and I were a little dried up after Exile,” Richards wrote in his memoir, Life. “After Exile, such a beautifully set up list of songs that all seemed to go together, it was difficult for us to get that tightness again.” So, true to its title, Goats Head Soup became something of a potluck where each threw their random ideas into the cauldron in the hope they’d blend into something palatable. As Jagger recently quipped to Rolling Stone, Goats Heads Soup may be the first album recorded in Jamaica to include “not the slightest influence of reggae on any of the tracks.” But while that may be true on a superficial level, the record is definitely running on island time, as the band casually wade through the piano-blues romp “Hide Your Love” and the Funkadelic-style swamp-soul chant “Can You Hear the Music” with a palpable lack of urgency. And coming off Exile’s rip-this-joint energy, the rave-ups on Goats Heads Soup can’t help but feel a little staid: “Silver Train” steadily rolls on the same track as Exile’s superior “All Down the Line,” while the X-rated lyrics of “Star Star” (a.k.a. “Starfucker,” a.k.a. the Stones’ raunchiest song this side of “Some Girls”) seem to be overcompensating for its basic “Roll Over Beethoven” backbeat. On tracks like these, we hear The World’s Greatest Rock‘n’Roll Band settling for just being a pretty good one, the menacing shit-kickers of old curdling into good-timey toe-tappers. Even when Jagger summons his old friend Lucifer via the deliciously evil voodoo riff of “Dancing With Mr. D,” he ends up closer to “Monster Mash” than “Sympathy for the Devil,” trading in that song’s politicized fury for puerile B-movie graveyard hijinks. However, Goats Head Soup’s best tracks are so good, they not only carry the album, they make it sound like nothing else in the Stones’ catalog. While the lurid urban-crime narratives of “Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo (Heartbreaker)” read more like TV Guide cop-show synopses than probing social commentary, the combination of Jagger’s raging vocal, Billy Preston’s apocalyptic clavinet riff, and a hair-raising brass refrain give the song an unmatched intensity among Stones singles of the era. (The obvious influence of blaxploitation funk would also loosen up the group for their oncoming disco years.) And if the mid-’70s may not have been a peak for the Stones as a rock band, it was a golden period for Stones ballads, as heralded by the still-sumptuous “Angie,” which is arguably both the most genteel and desperate song in their canon, and the mold from which future tearjerkers like “If You Really Want to Be My Friend,” “Memory Motel,” and “Fool to Cry” would be cast. But it’s a pair of album cuts, each tucked into the No. 3 position on their respective sides, that makes Goats Head Soup worthy of classic status, despite the album’s flaws. Richards’ countrified reverie “Coming Down Again” is the sobering counterpoint to Exile’s saloon-door swinger “Torn & Frayed,” as if he were surveying the scene of that album’s basement bacchanalia the morning after, wondering, “Where are all my friends?” Even better is the exquisite “Winter,” a dazed daydream of a song where Jagger’s uncannily Van Morrison-esque vocal is left to float atop Mick Taylor’s snowdrift guitars and swirls of regal orchestration. For all their stylistic fluidity, the Stones have always been a verse/chorus/verse kinda band, but “Winter” is a rare moment where they put feeling over form, letting themselves unravel in elegantly wasted fashion. When you think of the many bands who’ve channeled the disheveled spirit of ‘70s Stones—Primal Scream, The Replacements, early Wilco—the target was usually Exile on Main Street, but in their own beautifully damaged ways, they wound up a lot closer to Goats Head Soup. This record features another excellent ballad that has thus far gone unmentioned here—because, on the album proper, it’s trapped inside a rambling, clavinet-powered arrangement that tries to pass it off as a soul-funk workout. But “100 Years Ago” always seemed like a song that deserved a better fate, and the outtakes disc in this deluxe reissue does it justice through a raw, utterly compelling piano demo that anticipates the stark, ivory-pounding punk romanticism of Patti Smith. It’s no overstatement to say that, had the song been originally released in this form, it’d be considered a classic of the period. But its inclusion here highlights just how much tinkering and second-guessing went into Goats Heads Soup, as does a looser alternate take of “Dancing With Mr. D” that sounds like it was cut by Neil Young and the Stray Gators. The Goats Head sessions famously yielded songs that wouldn’t surface until 1981’s Tattoo You; those demos aren’t featured here, but we do get three previously unreleased tracks that suggest the record could’ve gone in an entirely different, more party-hearty direction. While the jolly “All the Rage” verges on cruise-ship-commercial frivolity, “Criss Cross” is the sort of cowbell-clanging boogie that Royal Trux spent half of their existence chasing, and the Jimmy Page-assisted “Scarlet” poses a question—what if the Stones decided to groove more like Zeppelin?—that would go unanswered until the second Black Crowes album. If these Goats Heads Soup rarities betray the album’s indecisive, scatterbrained origins, the reissue’s third disc—an oft-bootlegged but greatly enhanced recording of a Brussels show from October ’73—finds the Stones still very much at the top of their game as a live act. In sharp contrast to the rough ‘n’ tough 1970 live set, Get Yer Ya-Ya’s Out!, the Brussels concert sounds like it could’ve been recorded earlier this year—and that says as much about the pristine remastering job as how well it captures the Stones’ mid-’70s transformation into the crowd-pleasing, showbiz-savvy revue that would top Forbes music-biz listicles for decades to come. The extended sax solo on “You Can’t Always Get What You Want,” the call-and-response crowd participation on “Midnight Rambler,” the breakneck, scribble-outside-the-lines jamming on “Street Fighting Man”—this is a document of the Stones’ arena-rock playbook being written in real time. Tellingly, the Stones sequester the selections from Goats Head Soup together into a four-song mini-set, as if they needed protection from seasoned warhorses like “Gimme Shelter” and “Jumpin’ Jack Flash.” By the end of their 1975 tour, only one (“Star Star”) remained, and by the time of their 1981 stadium jaunt, practically any trace of Goats Head Soup had been erased from the setlist. This would suggest Goats Head Soup’s true significance is that it marked the moment where a new Rolling Stones record ceased to be a game-changing cultural event, and more like a fresh pile of coal shoveled into the engine room to keep the show on the road. But if Goats Head Soup revealed the first real chinks in the Stones’ armor, its eternally wounded ballads turned that fallibility into a virtue. Ultimately, Goats Head Soup remains fascinating for how it makes the Stones seem a little less mythical and a lot more real.","In 1973, Goats Head Soup marked the end of the Stones’ imperial era, capturing them as they transitioned from the World’s Greatest Rock‘n’Roll Band to just a really good one.

"GMTO, Vol. 1 (Get Money Take Over)",Bizzy Banks,by: Alphonse Pierre,Staff Writer ,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f5fef360706068286300f30/1:1/w_160/bizzy%20banks_gmto.jpg,2020-09-16 05:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/bizzy-banks-gmto-vol-1-get-money-take-over/,Atlantic,"Brooklyn drill rapper Bizzy Banks comes from a Trinidadian-American family in East New York, a prideful neighborhood at the outskirts of the borough. A short drive or train ride from East New York and things quickly change, as money gets pumped into Brooklyn, but the low-income areas remain the same. It’s like living behind a glass wall in your own hometown, with wealth and good fortune shoved in your face but no way to access it. In the best Brooklyn drill music, you can feel that tension in the rappers’ voices. Why shouldn’t they be able to have nice things and live good, too? It’s right there. And if, nobody is going to help them, they’ll figure it out, by any means necessary. Since his 2019 breakout single “Don’t Start,” the 21-year-old Bizzy Banks has been capturing this inner battle. Days spent getting fly and tipsy and scoring quick cash will hopefully make up for the violence, trauma, and struggle that haunts him. On his debut project GMTO Vol. 1, he never outright comments on a changing Brooklyn, but you feel it. “Look, serving these fiends for what?/So I can have J’s when I step in the club,” he says on “Top 5,” maybe the best song of his young career. Earlier on the track he raps, “I was raised by the block/I was nine when my father got knocked/I was twelve when my brother got knocked/I was thirteen when I let off that shot,” and it feels like he’s trapped in a world where prosperity is around the corner for everyone except him. This tone is the mixtape’s through line. On “Heartfroze,” weak crooning doesn’t take away from heavy reflections on the paranoia and the pressure he feels on a day-t0-day basis. Similar to Pop Smoke, the underlying weight of Bizzy Banks’ music doesn’t stop the party. On “Extra Sturdy,” an upbeat Bizzy glides over a beat from A Lau—a Harry Fraud collaborator who has helped diversify the sound of Brooklyn drill production—that sounds like you’re stuck in a funhouse at the circus. Then, there’s “Neo,” where, dated The Matrix references aside, Bizzy’s sharp flow lands somewhere between the rapid-fire G Herbo delivery he grew up on and the stop-start swagger of some of Brooklyn drill’s signature hits (see: “Big Drip”). And, “Cool Off” is ready to ring off at the end-of-the-summer backyard parties throughout New York; he balances a high-intensity verse with a calm and catchy hook. Though, Bizzy Banks runs into the same problems nearly every Brooklyn drill rapper—except Pop—has faced on their debut mixtapes. Despite the fact that he has one of the better ears in the subgenre for production, there are still some duds: “Quarantine Freestyle” and “Quarantine Freestyle, Pt. 2,” feature the type of routine drill production that can be found any day on the Raps and Hustles YouTube page. Then, he gets poisoned by the common, misguided belief that drill rappers have to learn how to make music other than drill. Which leads to “Hold You,” an unbearable attempt at a J.I the Prince of NY-type club record, and “Beautiful,” a bizarre interpolation of Jesse McCartney’s “Beautiful Soul” and one of 2020’s most unsettling love songs. But the peaks of GMTO Vol. 1 are high enough to overlook the parts that don’t work. On, “Don’t Start Pt. 2,” the sequel to his breakout song, Bizzy raps empathically “These niggas must think it’s really just music,” feelings he’s been holding in for years are being poured into a single verse. It’s this urgency that unites all the drill scenes, from Chicago to the UK to Brooklyn. Bizzy Banks is going to have all of the fun of a 21-year-old, even as the system works against him.","On his debut mixtape, the Brooklyn drill rapper performs with hungry urgency, as if prosperity is around the corner for everyone except him.

Angelheaded Hipster: The Songs of Marc Bolan & T. Rex ,Various Artists,by: Andy Beta,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f5fecb9fa63d0a85b6c8835/1:1/w_160/Angelheaded%20Hipster-%20The%20Songs%20of%20Marc%20Bolan%20&%20T.%20Rex%20.jpg,2020-09-16 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/various-artists-angelheaded-hipster-the-songs-of-marc-bolan-and-t-rexandnbsp/,BMG,"During his brief, glorious early ’70s peak, it seemed that Marc Bolan could send seismic tremors through the universe with delectable nonchalance. He switched from Tolkien-esque freak folk to Chuck Berry boogie in the span of an album. On a whim, he dabbed some glitter on his cheekbones before a Top of the Pops performance that was—per Simon Reynolds’ Shock and Awe: Glam Rock and Its Legacy—“the spark that ignited the glam explosion.” His greatest singles feel tossed off with all the deliberation of a shake of his curly locks. By comparison, the long fermenting Angelheaded Hipster: The Songs of Marc Bolan & T. Rex feels far more studied, pondered, and brooded over. Even with big names like Kesha, U2, Elton John, Father John Misty, Joan Jett, and Nick Cave swelling out this two-disc set, it sounds oddly anonymous. Overseen by pop music’s great magpie, the late Hal Willner, it follows in the producer’s style of pulling together an eclectic roster of talents to highlight nearly forgotten artists like Nino Rota, Kurt Weill, and Harold Arlen, proffering a gateway drug to curious listeners. He could dig deep for talent: A 1988 tribute to the music of vintage Disney films featured Tom Waits, the Replacements, and Sun Ra offering unorthodox takes on those intimately familiar songs. A Hal Willner compilation was, in the words of one estimation, “a place of scary, monumental meetings [that] Willner... made a career of turning into art.” The “monumental meetings” underpinning Angelheaded Hipster had been underway for some time. Arriving almost five months after his death from COVID-19 complications, the set was first mentioned in a 2017 Times profile of Willner, with him in the studio with Marc Almond and Foetus’ J.G. Thirwell. The story finds Almond “worried” about the end results, but the former Soft Cell singer delivers a dramatic reading set against a backdrop of beatnik walking bassline, quivering strings, and outbursts of tango. Risk-taking, insouciant in its mashing of genre, this version of “Teenage Dream” is a classic Willner soundclash. That daredevil spirit is in short order elsewhere. Hoping for “TiK ToK”-era Kesha to nail a frothy couplet like “I drive a Rolls-Royce/’Cuz it's good for my voice,” we instead get heavy-metal karaoke Kesha on the plodding and overwrought “Children of the Revolution.” Despite the teaming of two of the biggest dynasties in pop and rock, U2 and Sir Elton John (a pal of Bolan and early glam apostle) give a flaccid read of “Bang a Gong (Get It On).” Between Bono’s low-energy vocal and John’s piano serving as mere backdrop, they turn one of glam rock’s crunchiest singles into solemn porridge. The less said about Todd Rundgren and David Johansen’s contributions, the better. The most intriguing wrinkle of the set is the influx of country, as on Lucinda Williams’ twangy take on “Life’s a Gas.” Joan Jett does “Jeepster” as a full-on honky-tonk number, with Jett delivering all the sexual menace of the kicker “I’m gonna suck ya!,” and King Khan keeps “I Love to Boogie” firmly in the roadhouse. Gentle interpretations like Devendra Banhart’s dreamy “Scenescof” and Gabby Moreno’s exotica-tinged “Beltane Walk” also add nuance to the man’s music. Emily Haines delivers a haunted “Ballrooms of Mars,” but the version is derailed by a baffling intrusion of Gustav Holst’s “Mars, the Bringer of War,” from The Planets. But the oddest development of Angelheaded Hipster is that most of the 20-plus participants opt to inject angst and torpor into Bolan rather than revel in his pomp and frivolity. Beth Orton sings each syllable of “Hippy Gumbo” like she’s wringing out laundry. Nick Cave is well suited for the poignant ballad “Cosmic Dancer,” but where Bolan grows increasingly lithe and light as the song takes flight, Cave remains leaden in his delivery, singing the word “balloon” as if attaching an anvil to one. And how did Father John Misty pass up the chance to refer to himself in the third person? Instead he stays true to “Bolan likes to rock now” on a version of “Main Man” that’s more Jackson Browne than Bolan. In the same Willner profile, he admits: “I don’t know what inspires people now. Do these last two generations have heroes? I’m not sure they do.” The packed roster shows that Bolan remains a hero to musicians and a tragic icon, dead before the age of 30. Sadly, Willner’s last great tribute album tells us little about its subject. Angelheaded Hipster suggests that digging into Bolan’s depths might ultimately be a fool's errand; the singer’s genius was in laying everything out on a coy, glittery surface, making it all sound so effortless.","An all-star cast pays tribute to the glam-rock icon, but their interpretations too often read angst and torpor in place of the singer’s pomp and frivolity.

Proboscidea EP,Grip,by: Dylan Green,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f5fa71e8cf936a0b924a442/1:1/w_160/proboscidea_grip.jpg,2020-09-16 05:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/grip-proboscidea-ep/,Stray Society,"In October of 2019, Atlanta rapper Grip released the album Snubnose, a concept record exploring the vicious cycles of poverty and gentrification associated with gun violence in the United States, told partially from the perspective of a handgun. As weighty as the subject is, Grip’s energetic flows and ear for kinetic beats ensured the album didn’t devolve into a TED Talk. Just under a year removed from his breakout project, Grip remains interested in the art of rapping without being shackled to a narrative. “I wanted to break the stigma that I’m just a great storyteller. That’s cool and all, but nigga, I rap,” he told DJBooth earlier this year. On PROBOSCIDEA, the second in a series of self-released EPs, Grip creates his own cocoon in which to hone his craft. Even without an overarching story, the EP’s title shoehorns a loose theme in between the songs. The Proboscidea is a once-massive order of mammals that now has only one living representative: elephants. By taking the name, Grip marks himself as one-of-a-kind in a sea of rappers: “Proboscidea, yeah the route that we chose is similar, but my flow is sillier/Plus I hit the ground running so hard, if you tried this you’d probably explode your fibula,” he gloats on “Grip 3:16.” His nasal delivery and slant rhyme-heavy rapping style aren’t exactly novel, but his energy is magnetic. Listening to Grip rap in this environment is like watching a rising basketball star during the preseason; the stakes are lower but a good maneuver or jump shot can still turn an audience’s heads. Grip uses the freedom of PROBOSCIDEA to vent some professional frustrations, chin-check his competition, and continue the autobiographical streak his raps have taken on since his last EP, HALO. He writes off labels who take meetings with him only to turn him down and reminiscences on nights crashing on his friend’s couches. On “LET EM KNOW,” he compares himself to Kevin Durant and scolds recording booth gangsters fronting for streams. For all the biographical details scattered across PROBOSCIDEA, Grip is at his most compelling when he’s crushing his opponent’s jugular with his microphone. “Grip 3:16” is the EP’s undeniable highlight. Frequent collaborator Tu!, who produces the entire project, laces Grip and fellow Atlantans Kenny Mason and J.I.D with a fast-paced piano loop and drum track the trio proceeds to tear to shreds. All three rap in double-time, rattling personal tales and boasts at breakneck speeds like Super Saiyans zipping across the skyline. It’s almost enough to make you wish the three would release an EP together. Grip’s energy is infectious, but not every bar lands. There’s a line about raping the rap game near the end of “LET ‘EM KNOW,” a metaphor that feels tacky and distasteful even by braggadocio standards. It’s the one moment on the project where Grip’s command of language leads him to the lowest common denominator, one that’s been played out since Pharoahe Monch dedicated an entire song to it at the turn of the millennium. On a project this short, the flaws stick out more. Like HALO before it, PROBOSCIDEA is a feat of rap calisthenics. There are no grand statements or attempts to turn well-worn concepts on their heads. It’s a COVID-mandated stopgap on the path to Grip’s next major project. Either way, any rapper should hope to be as limber as Grip in their warm-up phase.","On the latest in a series of EPs, the unique Atlanta rapper creates his own cocoon in which to hone his craft.

No era sólida,Lucrecia Dalt,by: Jonathan Williger,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f52b29217e72b331b0e33f0/1:1/w_160/No%20era%20so%CC%81lida_Lucrecia%20Dalt.jpg,2020-09-15 05:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/lucrecia-dalt-no-era-solida/,Rvng Intl.,"Creative practice is a form of mediumship. Artists pull from the ether, from the great cultural unconscious, pawing at the veiled ideas found there until they begin to reveal form and structure. Colombian musician Lucrecia Dalt’s new album No era sólida (She Wasn’t Solid) is set in this liminal space, using arrhythmic loops of electronic sound to conjure a mysterious, ruminative atmosphere. The album’s protagonist is a character named Lia who is stretching her metaphysical legs for the first time, speaking through Dalt largely in strings of nonsensical syllables as she cycles through initial reactions to different emotions and sensations. An uneasy album of twisted innocence, it centers on the discomforting process of moving between a space of pure imagination and the reality shared by conscious human beings. This type of ponderous, character-driven concept is increasingly common in experimental-leaning electronic music (Oneohtrix Point Never’s imaginary alien Ezra, or Oracle, the disembodied voice on Amnesia Scanner’s Another Life), but Dalt’s rendering of Lia resists cliché by letting the caricature frame, rather than dominate, the sounds themselves. Dalt’s use of glossolalia, the invented quasi-language in which she gives voice to Lia, points to religious adherents speaking in tongues, but does so with great subtlety. Her vocals are largely enmeshed with eerie synthesized sounds and further abstracted by delay. The pleasures of No era sólida come not so much from following Lia’s perspective as she goes through the process of becoming as from experiencing the complicated feelings the music evokes as Dalt explores this persona: her tender curiosity, her tentative antagonism, the delicious nausea of high-pitched tones swinging back and forth. Spacious and quiet, No era sólida’s songs sometimes lock into a kind of stilted groove, but more often they forward with two left feet. Dalt uses loops in a similar way as her collaborator Aaron Dilloway, formerly of Wolf Eyes; both apply repetition as a way to build tension rather than hypnotize, employing a minimal palette that mimics incidental sounds from everyday life and blending them with alien electronics to make the familiar seem inscrutable. The effect is thoroughly psychedelic, and can be experienced as a kind of disorienting naiveté, recasting the commonplace as the unknown. The uneven gait of the electronics, like the perpetually surprising pop of synthesizer on “Di” and the mismatched gulping and clattering sounds on “Espesa,” divorces her sounds from any obviously mechanical process. It isn’t a leap to imagine these soundworlds as representations of a mind just beginning to bring its surroundings into focus, reveling in both glory and grit. The title track, the album’s final song, acts as a mission statement. It is the only track with words, which are spoken in Spanish, and it surveys the world from the point of view of Dalt’s muse as she emerges into full consciousness. Though the text is at times searching and uncertain (“I can only hear myself in the repeated echo because my voice initially gets confused with myself”), Dalt’s delivery is pointed and confident. It offers a peculiar climax, a moment of certainty following the ambiguity of what came before. It is as if the music, as an entity, is speaking directly to us, its observer. Dalt is a storyteller, but unlike traditional storytellers, she leaves her character where it came from, in that undulating space between abstraction and realization. Despite its heavy conceptual burden, No era sólida never crumples under its own weight. It shows rather than tells, guiding you through its prickly, unstable moods with a mystical sort of grace.","As though channeling supernatural energies, the Colombian experimental musician uses eerie electronics and vocal treatments to imbue unsettling world-building with a mystical sort of grace.

Spell My Name,Toni Braxton,by: Dean Van Nguyen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f5b9f66ac68e7d6962766f6/1:1/w_160/spell%20my%20name_toni%20braxton.jpg,2020-09-15 05:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/toni-braxton-spell-my-name/,Island,"Toni Braxton could have had more. That seems like a crazy assertion to make about an artist whose first two albums went 8x platinum in the U.S., but Braxton’s career has been marked with health issues, lawsuits, and industry setbacks—most famously, plans to release the 2pac-sampling “Me & My Boyfriend” as a single were scrapped when JAY-Z and Beyoncé put out “‘03 Bonnie & Clyde,” suppressing the reach of Braxton’s 2002 record More Than a Woman. On her new album, Spell My Name, the 52-year-old wants more; she wants her name carved in stone so her legacy is never in question. “I’ve been in this business for a long time and I’ve been blessed, so put some respect on my name a little bit,” Braxton told iHeartRadio last month. With Spell My Name, Braxton upholds her position as an originator of the sound of 1990s R&B. Though long-time collaborators Babyface and Antonio Dixon once again assist in production, Braxton asserts more agency than her previous album, 2018’s Sex & Cigarettes, by writing and producing a significant amount of the record. It adds up to a short collection that shows the familiar voice, style, and swagger of Braxton to be well preserved, even though things get off to an inauspicious start with “Dance.” It’s a track that aspires to the great tradition of danceable hits about dancing—Jessie Ware made an album of these recently—as Braxton tries to groove the pain of a break-up away. On a record that trades in retro sounds, this gooey disco jam it’s one of the few moments that sounds dated and stale. The album’s best moments move with a sleek sophistication that defines some of her greatest hits. On the excellent “Gotta Move On,” Braxton analyzes post-breakup life over an immaculately crafted musical backdrop and backing vocals courtesy of H.E.R. The title track features a back-and-forth between Braxton and an unbilled male vocalist in the role of a younger beau. “I’m a little older and I really kinda like it that way,” she declares. “I’ll get you straight up fiendin’,” he later retorts like a guy who has heard “He Wasn’t Man Enough” and is trying very hard. Braxton’s voice—with all its brilliant depth—suitably overpowers her co-stars' presence, hinting at the chasm in their maturity and experience. Missy Elliott appears on and co-produces “Do It,” throwing back to her more understated work with the ’90s soul group 702 that ran counter to her more futurist solo catalogue. The best song, though, is “O.V.E.Rr.,” a tale of two lovers who keep coming back to each other. There have been a million songs that cover similar terrain but Braxton boasts not just the voice to carry the drama, but the specificity as a writer to depict the emotion. Over a swooning instrumental, her voice gasps and gyrates. When she hits that extra “r” in spelling out the title—the relationship is more “overer” than before—you want to believe her but can’t. Less impressive are the ballads that appear down the stretch. There’s a touch of musical theatre to “Happy Without Me.” It’s alright, but it’s not exactly “Un-Break My Heart.” And the album is probably missing that one banger to put a button on the set that perhaps a Darkchild or Pharrell—two of Braxton’s iPhone contacts—could have helped provide. Still, Braxton has evoked the spirit of ’90s R&B without ever sounding like she’s simply throwing out nostalgia bait. Into her fourth decade as a recording artist, she’s refusing to accept that her best is in the rearview mirror.","The masterful R&B singer returns with more creative control on a project where her voice, style, and swagger are well preserved.

The Fifth Season,Lafawndah,by: Jemima Skala,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f5f7813b6db121d1a596bff/1:1/w_160/the%20fifth%20season_lafawndah.jpg,2020-09-15 05:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/lafawndah-the-fifth-season/,Latency ,"Lafawndah’s debut LP Ancestor Boy announced her on a wider stage as someone willing to take risks and run with them. A brash mix of experimental dance and globally minded pop, the album was as exciting as it was confounding. In that same spirit, The Fifth Season, her first release of original material since then, is another sharp left turn. She’s lost none of her experimentalism, but this time, she’s channeling it into a more live-feeling body of work. The Fifth Season is minimalist, full of space and light, like a development of her 2018 EP, Le Renard Bleu, with the Japanese composer Midori Takada, and their one-off performance of their piece “Ceremonial Blue” at London’s Barbican Hall. Album closer “Le Malentendu” is a rare example of Lafawndah sharing vocal duties, this time with French rapper Lala &ce. Rather than cluttering the mix, the contrast between the two vocal timbres—Lafawndah light and airy, &ce rich and grounded—opens the track up further, allowing Lafawndah to feel her own limits. It’s a welcome reminder of the sparse magnetism of her live shows, a touchstone in a time of distant connection. With The Fifth Season, she slows everything down, stripping back the harsh, abstract instrumental productions of Ancestor Boy, affording her the time and space to explore other genres. “You, at the End” is built around a horn motif that subtly grows and adapts while anchoring the track, taking it in a jazzier direction. “The Stillness” is anything but still; it’s a slowly expanding web of drones and polyrhythms, carefully coordinated and vibrating with anxious energy, the feeling that anything could happen. In all of her work, Lafawndah has centered her voice as an instrument. On The Fifth Season, however, she treats it with the same gravity, care, and potential for variability as a violin. On opener “Old Prayer,” she goes from a quiet plaintive lament to a cry that reverberates, giving the impression that the higher powers she invokes are sung into being through her. Her voice on “L’Imposteur” is layered with a Vocoder-like effect that’s an uncanny mimic of Lafawndah’s own occasional and subtle vibrato; with it, she dresses up as herself, trying on different aspects of her own personality to see which fits. On album single “Don’t Despair,” she sings as close as she can to a whisper without losing her stringent sense of melody, delivering a discordant message of tentative hope. The Fifth Season is imbued with the tension and power of a live instrumental performance, at once intriguing and nerve-wracking. Throughout the album, Lafawndah embodies a purposeful fluidity of genre and role that makes her difficult to pin down, someone completely comfortable walking in their path no matter how it might appear to an outside observer. With this latest release, she complicates the labels of “dance music artist,” “composer,” and “performer” by synthesizing them, embodying all three at once and allowing herself to get lost in the boundless possibilities of each.","Following her brash and confounding debut, the singer-producer slows everything down, recreating the sparse magnetism of her live show.

Lessons,MC Eiht,by: Pete Tosiello,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f5fa43cb2d5b619cfead3df/1:1/w_160/lessons_mc%20eiht.jpg,2020-09-15 05:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/mc-eiht-lessons/,Blue Stamp,"Two weeks after the 1992 L.A. uprising concluded with 63 dead and 12,000 arrested, Compton’s Most Wanted returned to the studio to cut their third full-length fronted by then-20-year-old Aaron “MC Eiht” Tyler. That the resultant album, the visceral Music to Driveby, didn’t incite the same moral panic as Death Certificate, O.G. Original Gangster, or The Chronic wasn’t a reflection of its quality relative to those records so much as its zoomed-in worldview. Eiht’s bloody tales of blacktop warfare weren’t, at first glance, political in the mode of his neighbors wit’ attitudes. Instead, they charted the insular dynamics of his hometown with nihilistic affect. A mostly unrepentant antagonist prone to flashes of lucid reflection, Eiht approached the carceral state, militarized police, and Southern California redlining with sorrow rather than revolutionary rage. On Driveby’s vibrant follow-ups We Come Strapped and Death Threatz, he leaned into the chaos, flaunting territorial pettiness like a pro-wrestling heel. If he was, as he often claimed, a menace to society, it’s because society was, well, a menace. It’s testament both to Eiht’s consistency and the sputtering American experiment that his music still resonates three decades on. By the mid-’90s, C.M.W.’s best work had been adapted by lesser descendants like Watts Gangstas and South Central Cartel, but Eiht’s ability to convey his environs in a succinct, visual manner kept him afloat in a crowded market. Lessons is a worthy late addition to the MC Eiht Cinematic Universe, its scenery familiar in a way that doesn’t invoke cheap nostalgia; there’s nothing to be reclaimed or recaptured because, for better or worse, Eiht’s music never strayed beyond these settings in the first place. When he deadpans, “Rollin’ up trees on a magazine/Another n***a died, sippin’ lean” on the smooth highlight “Things We Go Through,” you can hear the disquiet in his grizzled voice. Eiht always made shootouts and drug deals sound like nine-to-five drudgery, and on Lessons they’re relayed with a survivor’s wariness. The solid guest roster on Lessons adds color to a template of hard snares and sturdy hooks. On the sinister “Get Money Man,” B-Real makes for a perfect vocal foil, his jittery opening verse paving way for Eiht’s dour world-building. Mitchy Slick’s excellent appearance on “Stand Up” is buried a bit within the album’s 20 tracks, but the effect is similar—his eager flow veers around the drum pattern before Eiht steers back to center. Dave East and Conway the Machine appear as emissaries from the new school, but in practice they’re the same breed of glowering quick wit as Eiht. If rappers had coaching trees, Eiht would be Rick Pitino. The beats, supplied by Ferhan C, Hermanata, D-Ace, and C.M.W. comrade Tha Chill, are clean in a clinical, post-2001 way, sun and palm trees with whiffs of gunsmoke and diesel exhaust. They settle into their grooves and stay there. To say that these tracks would’ve sounded at home in 2005 or 2015 isn’t really a critique, but it does underscore how deliciously weird Eiht’s classic compositions were—while his peers mined the P-Funk catalog for any samples Dr. Dre might have neglected, Eiht enlisted SOLAR Records session player Willie Zimmerman to help build orchestral arrangements and long, rolling “Endoludes” comprised entirely of ad-libs. Lessons offers some adequate chipmunk soul on “That’s Perfect,” a bright horn fanfare on “Ambition.” It’s all professionally competent, if not particularly distinctive. Eiht’s timeless narratives on “Hood Took Me Under” and “All for the Money” were kinetic and claustrophobic, sweeping cause-and-effect arcs which encompassed decades in the course of individual verses; when he wasn’t scaling fences and fleeing S.W.A.T. teams, he was training his own infrared beams on whichever saps were unlucky enough to be wearing the wrong color. Lessons is comparably static and, it must be said, recounted largely in the past tense. (“I know the theme of this song is familiar,” Young Noble admits on “Magic.” Well, yes.) It’s an unlikely trajectory for the Compton Cyco, but Eiht plays the elder statesman admirably. “Whut U Really On” and the title track do nice jobs dispensing hard-earned wisdom without resorting to soapbox proselytizing. There’s a real chance Eiht wouldn’t have lived to see 30 if he’d kept making records like Death Threatz. But having listened to his last few projects, I still don’t know much about what middle age looks like for MC Eiht, and frankly I’d like to—he’s a clever writer and a perceptive, charismatic narrator who’s lived a remarkable life. His famous cameos on “m.A.A.d city” and “One Life to Live” were such show-stoppers because they served as reminders of what singular presence he has. If he could manage to land a few weeks with a Rick Rubin or a Madlib, I’d love to see what happens when Eiht’s genius gets loose and deconstructed.","The underrated titan of West Coast gangsta rap stays true to his classic formula on an LP featuring guest verses from spiritual descendants Conway the Machine and Dave East.

Electr-O-Pura,Yo La Tengo,by: Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f57bad87eefad57b1837168/1:1/w_160/electr-o-pura_yo%20la%20tengo.jpg,2020-09-14 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/yo-la-tengo-electr-o-pura/,Matador,"In the fall of 1994, Yo La Tengo spent three nights opening for Johnny Cash, then at the cusp of a resurgence with his Rick Rubin-produced American Recordings. The Hoboken, New Jersey trio have been characteristically self-deprecating about the experience: Guitarist Ira Kaplan—who shares vocal duties with his wife, drummer Georgia Hubley, and the bassist, James McNew—remembers accidentally insulting the audience, who were none too taken with the band’s understated noise-pop. A star-struck McNew, spotting Johnny and June Cash Carter at the side of the stage, almost dropped his instrument mid-song. “Everything’s gotta be rebooted these days,” Kaplan said from his and Hubley’s home in a recent retrospective, discussing a 25-year-old music video that enacts a similar juxtaposition. Directed by Yo La Tengo’s then-roadie Phil Morrison, who went on to helm the breakout 2005 indie movie Junebug, the 1995 clip for “Tom Courtenay” imagines the band being asked to open for a fantastical reunion of the Beatles. It’s no spoiler to say that the gig doesn’t quite pan out as hoped. The song and the video are each funny and heartfelt, referential and personal, grandiose and unassuming. Both tell you a lot about who Yo La Tengo are, and where they were as the ’90s alt-rock boom fizzled. Electr-o-pura, currently being given a reboot of sorts by longtime label Matador, occupies a place in Yo La Tengo’s discography that was rarefied before and seems almost impossible now. Released in May 1995, about 11 years after the band formed, Electr-o-pura was their seventh album. So it was a long time coming, maybe unthinkably long, given their modest popularity, in this era of streaming’s short-attention-span economies of scale. But Electr-o-pura was also the second in a nearly impeccable four-album run that began with 1993’s noise-pop gauntlet Painful, peaked with 1997’s expansively intimate I Can Hear the Heart Beating as One, and then slipped away into the moonlit hush of 2000’s And Then Nothing Turned Itself Inside-Out. And it still sounds low-key monumental, like the work of a group that might share a bill at the Mercury Lounge with a reanimated Fab Four. Unlike the albums immediately before and after it, Electr-o-pura doesn’t represent a gigantic leap, just a great band lurching headlong into its own. It was Yo La Tengo’s second album on the upstart label Matador, and second album with producer Roger Moutenot, who would go on to oversee all of the group’s following albums until 2013’s Fade. And it was their second album with the official membership of McNew, who’d originally stepped in to stop a revolving door of temporary bassists on 1992’s inchoate May I Sing With Me. Emboldened by all this familiarity, the band tore into their emerging signature style—woozy folk-pop ballads, feedback-streaked guitar jams, organ swells, plenty of ba-ba-bas—with shrugging audacity. Fittingly, it’s the first Yo La Tengo album with all three members identified as co-songwriters. “Tom Courtenay,” again, illustrates why Electr-o-pura and Yo La Tengo have stood the test of time. At the most superficial level, this beloved live-show staple is one of the band’s uptempo fuzz-pop songs, like Painful’s “From a Motel 6” or I Can Hear the Heart Beating as One’s “Sugarcube,” and probably their catchiest. The name-dropping of British Invasion-era movie stars also fits into the concept of this band of dedicated fans (Kaplan, as is often noted, was formerly a music critic for New York Rocker and Village Voice) cosplaying their way into the big show. Most importantly, though, Kaplan himself didn’t actually know much about these old movies—Hubley, the daughter of two professional animators, was the film obsessive. “It was another way of writing about and to Georgia,” Kaplan has said. This was a private world for two. Opened up to an audience, the couple’s shared secrets and inside jokes could signal not exclusivity, but personal connection, ultimately fostering a community of fellow fans. The rest of Electr-o-pura doesn’t always stick in your head as quickly, but it’s often as rewarding. The opening “Decora,” where Hubley begins with a nonchalant murmur of, “I see you crawling across the floor,” picks up from the flickering dream-pop of Painful; the way that Hubley bends syllables and moans the title phrase on the chorus recalls My Bloody Valentine’s wavy “glide guitar” technique. “It’s not the first time you’ll take a fall,” Hubley warns, memorably adding, “Act like you’ve never seen double before.” The closing “Blue Line Swinger,” also sung by Hubley, is one of Yo La Tengo’s very best songs. No strangers to lengthy instrumental passages, here they stretch out for nine-plus drum-heavy minutes of whammy-bar mangling and organ rushes, as Hubley seems to address a lover gnawed by depression and self-doubt. “Out of the darkness you will come around,” she assures, “and I’ll find you there.” The song is proof. It’s indie rock at its most epically beautiful. In between, the songs engage in a dialogue with other music that’s like an intimate conversation by other means. After “Tom Courtenay” fades out, “False Ending” fades in, with a raucous clamor akin to the infamous “I buried Paul” section tacked on as the fake-out conclusion of “Strawberry Fields Forever.” A couple of tracks later, though, “Paul Is Dead” recalls not so much the Beatles as the subway strut of the Velvet Underground and the sunshine harmonies of the Beach Boys, while Kaplan deadpans about a guy who’s singing along to the Rolling Stones song blasting in his headphones (“Sympathy for the Devil,” judging by the “woo, woo!”). The second verse shifts dramatically toward the personal, as Kaplan describes a drunken first meeting that grows into something more, then recognizes the impossibility of ever fully understanding another human being, even those we know best. “I try not to hide what is true,” Kaplan sings, and it’s like an artist’s statement. The lessons from cult records could also be used to convey behind-closed-doors desires. A year after Electr-o-pura, Yo La Tengo appeared, as the Velvet Underground, in the film I Shot Andy Warhol (they have self-deprecating stories about that, too). On “My Heart’s Reflection,” simmering with barely suppressed tension, Kaplan repurposes the central conceit of “I’ll Be Your Mirror” as he suggests, with disarming vulnerability, that he and a lover dress up as each other, locking the room and throwing away the key. There’s even a thrill of danger in his voice as he blurts, “Let’s jump the ship/Let’s cut out.” Why not? The best reason for being intensely protective about privacy is to enjoy it. A similar tinge of downtown disquiet runs through the guitar workout of “Flying Lesson (Hot Chicken #1)” and the clanging, organ-blasted “False Alarm” . But there’s self-aware humor, too. The former is the first of two songs on the album, that pun simultaneously on Flying Burrito Brothers song titles and the prime culinary offering of Prince’s Hot Chicken Shack in Nashville, where Yo La Tengo were recording for the first time. On “False Alarm,” Kaplan refers to McNew by name and mentions the title of a song tucked away deeper on the album, “(Straight Down to the) Bitter End.” That one is Hubley-led fuzz-pop, a caustic character study that features the evocative line, “The stars that shine but don’t belong to you.” Yo La Tengo shone while walking among us. In the video looking back at “Tom Courtenay,” Kaplan, who is wearing a black band T-shirt, jokes about how he still dresses the same all these years later. Yo La Tengo’s vision of a welcoming, everyday bohemianism has gone in and out of fashion, but it was never exactly trendy. Electr-o-pura attracted the group’s normal glowing reviews, but it sold less than Painful. Yo La Tengo wouldn’t crack the Billboard 200 album charts until the 2000s. Back then, they were just moderately successful enough to lose to Pavement at ping-pong on the Lollapalooza tour, headlined by Hole and Sonic Youth. While the beverage museum that prompted the album’s title (Electropura was a brand of purified water) was eventually donated to Goodwill), Yo La Tengo have continued to put out several mostly strong albums, along with film scores and other instrumentals. If the pre-reboot High Fidelity, originally published the same year as Electr-o-pura’s release, exhibited toxic masculinity and the misbegotten belief that what you like matters more than what you are like, Yo La Tengo offer the possibility of a more coequal relationship between romantic partners—and one where what you like matters because you, generally, like each other. For this reissue—part of Matador’s Revisionist History series, which also includes Mary Timony’s Mountains, Pavement’s Wowee Zowee, and Guided By Voices’ Alien Lanes—Yo La Tengo labelmate Lucy Dacus reminisced fondly about discovering Electr-o-pura, with its CD packaging that intentionally messed up the track times (purportedly because reviewers kept singling out the longest songs on the band’s albums as the worst!). Dacus’ stark “Tom Courtenay” cover brings to mind Yo La Tengo’s acoustic, Hubley-led rendition from a 1995 B-side, which sounds like Camera Obscura and might be better than the album version. The reissue rightfully concentrates on the proper LP only, now pressed for the first time across two vinyl records. But part of the Yo La Tengo experience, driven home in their free-wheeling concerts, is the notion that their songs are never finished. Electr-o-pura lives up to that standard, whether in alternate takes or subsequent re-recordings. The song on Electr-o-pura with the most quintessentially Yo La Tengo-esque story is the serene ballad “The Hour Grows Late.” A whispery Kaplan paints a scene not too distant from some that Yo La Tengo must’ve experienced in their earlier years. A musician packs up his drum machine and, gradually, his guitar, peeking out at empty seats, clock ticking. Kaplan sings that he wants to send this song out to someone called Richie Van “in his thrift store corner of the world.” It’s a nod toward an amazingly obscure singer, whose equally obscure record—a thrift-store score for Kaplan—inspired Yo La Tengo to cover the future Gilmore Girls soundtrack highlight “My Little Corner of the World” a couple of years later. On Electr-o-pura, Yo La Tengo were poised in between finding themselves and going their own way, and the end result is still exhilarating. Johnny Cash’s American Recordings-era audiences may have been irritated, but after Electr-o-pura hit shelves, Yo La Tengo started covering Grand Funk Railroad’s “We’re an American Band” during encores. They’d learned from the best, and they knew that even though they might only be a triumvirate of hapless Richie Vans, they belonged on the same stages.","In 1995, the indie rock trio lurched headlong into its own sound with Electr-O-Pura. Now, newly reissued on vinyl, the pop-focused and densely referential album remains a monument in the band’s catalog.

The Universal Want,Doves,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f57c2827eefad57b183716a/1:1/w_160/the%20universal%20want_doves.jpg,2020-09-14 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/doves-the-universal-want/,Imperial,"The transformative power of sound has served as the subtext for basically every song Doves have ever written. On “Cathedrals of the Mind,” it’s the entire text. The band’s Jimi Goodwin describes the third single from The Universal Want as “a prayer to sonics,” a recollection of ravers “going insane” in an open field as soundsystems blast at ego-crushing volumes. When the trio behind erstwhile dance project Sub Sub reinvented themselves as a vaguely mysterious and very grandiose Y2K Britrock band on their 2000 debut Lost Souls, there’s no way they  would’ve allowed themselves to be so literal. That they can now is proof of concept for the band’s first album in 11 years: men in their 50s channeling the memories of their teens through the music of their 30s. Merely by sounding much like other Doves albums, Universal Want is nostalgic. Though their first single was a booming, nearly eight-minute statement of intent, Doves’ debut made for a notable break from the Glastonbury giants then being felled by various forms of ego and bloat. And while Lost Souls and its follow-up The Last Broadcast topped the UK charts, the British press, “desperate for something to kick us out of the stupor of the previous two or three years,” quickly flocked towards the more tabloid-friendly Strokes and Libertines. For a time, Doves were at least perceived as being cooler or less crassly commercial than Coldplay—praise that eventually seemed shortsighted when comparing the technicolor splendor of the Brian Eno-produced Viva La Vida to 2009’s Kingdom of Rust. As most of their peers have either shuttered or grown into the middle-age MOR tag, Doves seem to see their own continued existence as a form of defiance. “If you gotta believe in someone, don’t make that person me,” Goodwin sniffs on “Prisoners,” which seemingly advocates for rioting within the cell walls of your own life. It’s an unusually bristling sentiment, especially within the swirling, string-laced strums. Doves aren’t just picking up where they left off, but actively invoking their two earliest and most beloved albums. Both Lost Souls and Last Broadcast announced themselves with a portentous intro leading into a bracing, percussive mission statement; The Universal Want does the same. A cracking Tony Allen breakbeat serves as the selling point of “Carousels,” though Doves aren’t really riding the rhythm or working within a pocket. The sample dominates an already crowded mix, but maximalism is the point: “Carousels” works as a recreation of the competing nostalgias in Goodwin’s lyrics. It’s not meant to sound like the future, more, “they don’t make ’em like this anymore.” The same could’ve been said in 2005 or 2009, when Some Cities and Kingdom of Rust arrived to increasingly muted receptions. Some of the critiques still hold true: As always, the midsection gets a bit soggy, one guitar overdub is never enough, and while Godwin’s vocals have an appealing, worn grain, they’re also incapable of modulation. But The Universal Want troubleshoots wisely—keep the tempos at a brisk jog, dabble in Afrobeat, Motown, and cinematic soul rather than prog, and watch the clock. Whereas Kingdom of Rust felt like twice its hourlong runtime, Universal Want is Doves’ first filler-free album, floating by like a warm breeze. It also leaves about the same impression: In the moment, Doves’ candor and lyrical clarity on the title track are a welcome shift for a band whose personality is mostly divined from its production choices. Yet it’s the punched-in, drum-machine bounce of “I Will Not Hide” that lingers more than its hook; the mere attempt at making “Mother Silverlake” the grooviest Doves song is more memorable than the melody. The twinkling icicle lights of guitar that twist around the chorus of “Carousels” render its lyrics redundant at best. Despite their rep as throwback, album-oriented studio geeks, 2010’s The Places Between proved that Doves are a frequently transcendent singles band. The Universal Want lacks the take-on-the-world bullishness of “There Goes the Fear,” the cinematic sweep of “The Man Who Told Everything” or “Caught By the River,” or a chorus that could translate as easily to a jazz-pop cover as “Catch the Sun.” These are the kind of songs that might have driven Doves fans to the same ecstatic highs that Goodwin describes on “Cathedrals of the Mind,” but The Universal Want understands that those same people probably can’t experience that sensation anew, just fondly remember it.","The Britrock survivors’ first album in 11 years is the sound of men in their 50s channeling the memories of their teens through the music of their 30s.

From King to a GOD,Conway the Machine,by: Matthew Ismael Ruiz,"Associate Staff Writer, News",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f5ba18bcd07dc33233504cb/1:1/w_160/from%20king%20to%20a%20god_conway%20the%20machine.jpg,2020-09-14 05:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/conway-the-machine-from-king-to-a-god/,DrumworkGriseldaEMPIRE,"Buffalo’s Griselda Records has built a fiefdom in western New York through prolific output with a very specific aesthetic, characterized by deep-seated grime draped in muted elegance. It’s the sound of long nights and cold winters, art made by hustlers toiling in relative obscurity, unable to garner support even from local institutions. As one of its founding MCs, Conway the Machine has come to embody Buffalo’s identity as a forgotten city, carrying a chip on his shoulder big enough to block out the sun. But on his latest LP From King to a God, Conway looks to shed his earthly confines for something more heavenly. A rapper’s voice is their instrument, and few have one as distinct as Conway. His Bell’s Palsy (the result of several gunshot wounds) splits his diction right down the middle of his face, somewhere in between sharp and slurring. He’s a poignant lyricist with a penchant for storytelling, and his words are always intelligible, even if they sometimes sound strained through gritted teeth. His flow can turn an average track into something memorable, and serves as the perfect foil to his brother Westside Gunn’s nasal delivery. The lyrics that unique instrument delivers on From King to a God are often vivid—albeit somewhat rehashed—street tales told with clever wordplay and a knack for scene-setting. He carries himself with the confidence of someone who knows they’re hard, and therefore isn’t afraid to be vulnerable, threatening violence and shedding tears in the same breath on “Juvenile Hell” (“I cried when Country Mike died, my heart broke/On the yard, get your jaw broke, as far as the bars go/Not only did I raise the bar, the bar broke”). From King to a God’s production credits are star-studded, spanning several decades of hip-hop royalty, including EPMD’s Erick Sermon, Gang Starr’s DJ Premier, Mobb Deep’s Havoc, and the reigning maestro of mafioso rap, the Alchemist. The bulk of the production is handled by UK producer Beat Butcha and Griselda’s in-house producer Daringer, who are reverent enough towards the aforementioned OGs that the aesthetic across From King to a God is relatively seamless. The lone exceptions come from two modern-era production gurus, Hit-Boy and Murda Beatz. Murda Beatz’s “Anza” floats a Double Dragon-esque chiptune melody atop a buoyant beat, and sounds like nothing else on the album. But the Hit-Boy helmed “Fear of GOD” is the album’s most compelling track, with a twinkling beat that teasingly withholds a sinister bassline in service of calculated drops. The inclusion of a perfectly serviceable Dej Loaf verse is curious, to say the least—her candy-coated AutoTune delivery sticks out like a sore thumb against the muted mahogany flows that typically populate Griselda records. And the vibe vanishes as abruptly as it arrived, shifting back into the tortured strings of the Method Man collab “Lemon.” It’s the strongest verse from Mr. Meth in years (“We creamin' em with pockets of dirty money, I'm clean again/Ain't gotta tell you I'm dope, just stick the needle in”), but the sequencing does it no favors. From King to a God would be considered a solid effort from most MCs, but it's clear Conway has his aim set higher. Having conquered his hometown, Conway now seeks adulation from the world at large. And largely, it’s a world that has moved on from the New York sound of the ’90s. There are forays into potential new directions, but much of From King to a God finds Conway treading water. And the late additions to the tracklist—including the three interludes that essentially eulogize his homie DJ Shay (the recently deceased Griselda production mainstay) and tracks produced by DJ Premier and Khrysis—seem to look more backward than forward. Conway admits that this LP is meant to be somewhat of an appetizer for his forthcoming Shady records debut, God Don’t Make Mistakes, the record that would mark a sea change for both himself and Griselda as a whole. And if he wants to shed the genre-rapper tag and graduate to the next level of stardom, he’ll need a record that elevates the Griselda sound beyond the limits of Buffalo’s icy streets.","On his latest album, the Buffalo rapper and member of the tough-talking trio Griselda makes his first bid for a bigger audience.

PHONE PHREAKER$ PHREAK BACK,Loretta Aberdeen,by: Hubert Adjei-Kontoh,Associate Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f5bbfe635ccfc2935431b45/1:1/w_160/PHONE%20PHREAKER$%20PHREAK%20BACK_loretta%20aberdeen.jpg,2020-09-14 05:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/loretta-aberdeen-phone-phreakerdollar-phreak-back/,Off Center,"Like anyone who spends quite a bit of time staring at inanimate objects attempting to figure them out, Loretta Aberdeen (aka Bryant Canelo) seems slightly suspicious of technology. As Lampgod, Canelo makes abstract, hip-hop productions, stitched together with played-to-death soul tapes and drum machine loops that seem to disintegrate as you listen to them. But under his Loretta Aberdeen alias, he makes work that is noisy and repetitious; he dares you turn it off, and freely admits that some songs “can also be too long for your enjoyment.” The terrain of his latest album, PHONE PHREAKER$ PHREAK BACK, is made up of ambient memories, distorted house skeletons, and spoken-word rants. It’s not so much exhausting as it is exhaustive, allowing Aberdeen to examine both his vulnerability and his distance from it. Aberdeen obscures himself in clouds of beeps and minimal drum hits, clearing the air only to startle you with sudden declarations. Album opener “LUXCORE” is an icy landscape formed of otherworldly material; it’s digital firmament. As the song progresses, Aberdeen keeps hyping the track by saying, “Check it out, now.” It’s eerily disembodied, yet strangely immersive. His repetitions begin to have the effect of mantras, and the blistering, almost orchestral peals of distorted guitar that compete for your attention provide the track with a quasi-mystical character. It’s like looking at the human trapped in the machine. Aberdeen ensconces you deep inside this sprawling consciousness-warping device, measuring your perception by messing with it. “MOLLYMAN” begins with Aberdeen humming, “Didn’t know I could love somebody/Didn’t know I could love someone like this” to a series of squeaks. This earnest proclamation leads into club-ready drum patterns, and the next set of lyrics fit this new setting: “You make me dance/Bring me up/Play it sweet/Make me move just like a freak/Mr. Mollyman, Mr. Mollyman hold up.” Here, dancing is only hinted at; it’s a track that feels closer to walking outside of a club than being inside one. Or to put it another way, it feels more like being in the head of someone preparing to meet a new lover at the club, the soundtrack to their imagined future made more abstract due to its distance from concrete reality. Like in “extra,” a song about fighting outside the club, Aberdeen is focused on manipulating the outside world’s sound so that it sounds both real and unreal, an inescapable hallucination. By bringing in the bass drum at odd intervals and looping together hollow-sounding reeds on “MOLLYMAN,” Aberdeen shows he is more interested in skewing with what you perceive than making you move. This fixation with the mechanics of listening gives the album a hypnotic power. “BOOK,” flickers with electricity buffeted by static and scattered hi-hats. It sits somewhere on the scale between progressive electronic and noisy improv, and it evokes images of disintegrating cities with desolated architecture. The jittery “cinerama” feels playful and enervating in equal measure; it’s intriguing even if it never becomes immersive. The floating “STARR” sits right in the middle of that scale. At first, it’s easy to get lost in its warm, heady progressions, but the addition of a propulsive beat somehow turns what was once an engaging walk into an aimless hike. In the liner notes for PHONE PHREAKER$ PHREAK BACK, Aberdeen says that when he was young, he got good at computer hacking, but what he was really interested was phone hacking or “phreaking.” He says that “a toy whistle that came in a captain crunch box” produced “a certain frequency that [could] be picked up by payphones to make free calls.” The founders of Apple were also avid phreakers, and received cash to create “blue boxes” that would allow the user to make free phone calls. Steve Jobs actually credits blue boxes for Apple’s existence. What was once a harmless bit of computer fun led to the creation of a multinational conglomerate that not only has the power to evade any sort of regulation, but also the ability to surveil many users of its products. Perhaps Aberdeen is right to distrust the digital. Technology manipulates memory the way it manipulates our data; we may think we are getting a deal because we can shitpost or send messages to faraway friends, but the forms we occupy are as limited as the protections we have over the content we send. Is there another way? Through his music, Aberdeen refuses to format himself in a way that can be easy to consume. If you hack his phone line, you’ll only hear static.","Producer Bryant Canelo’s latest album is filled with ambient memories, distorted house skeletons, and spoken-word rants.

Pod,The Breeders,by: Judy Berman,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f57bfaa7b657428acd200e4/1:1/w_160/pod_the%20breeders.jpg,2020-09-13 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/the-breeders-pod/,4AD,"Sex may be the engine of pop music, but what of breeding? Nothing looks less cool (to those for whom the appearance of coolness is of prime importance) than changing diapers, starting a college fund, and being optimistic enough to believe in the long-term survival of the human species. More than that, though, even the word breeding carries the humiliating connotation of intimate acts performed in captivity, under surveillance. It makes the Breeders kind of a gross band name, as Kim Deal was well aware. “Back in the late ’80s, there was so much shit given to gay people,” she has said, “but at the same time gay people thought heterosexuality was disgusting, and I loved that.” Although it dates back to Deal’s pre-Pixies teenage duo with twin sister Kelley, the moniker is eerily well-suited to the band’s debut album. Released amid the bursting buds of May 1990, Pod is vividly sensual and sexual without being sexy in an alluring sense, like the music of the era’s biggest pop stars: Madonna, Janet Jackson, Prince. It is also, in its close atmosphere as well as its lyrics, a little disgusting. Deal has described the record as a collection of “ugly, stinking gross songs.” One of the best of the bunch, “When I Was a Painter,” captures the record’s tension between intimacy and revulsion, describing a room thick with “bad sex and bad TV.” Maybe it was this hermetic, almost fermented quality that kept the collaboration between Deal and Throwing Muses co-frontwoman Tanya Donelly from attracting nearly as much attention as they were getting in their more extroverted main gigs. In the 16 months between 1989’s Doolittle and 1990’s Bossanova, Black Francis barely needed to cough to have NME and Spin asking for a quote. But Pod was mostly dispatched with faint praise by that same rock press whose support was so critical to independent artists at the time. Just a few years later, by which time Donelly had left and Kelley had rejoined the lineup to replace her, alt-rock had become an unlikely music-industry gold rush. The Breeders’ sunnier, airier second album, 1993’s Last Splash, rode the “Cannonball” wave to platinum certification and relegated their earlier releases to footnotes. Only in retrospect did it become apparent how crucial Pod was in creating the necessary conditions for the Breeders—and so many other bands—to thrive. Like so many underground bands that prominently featured women (the Raincoats, the Vaselines, Shonen Knife), the Breeders got a boost in visibility during the early ’90s through the effusive support of Kurt Cobain. Speaking to Melody Maker in 1992, the world’s biggest rock star explained: “The main reason I like them is for their songs, for the way they structure them, which is totally unique, very atmospheric. I wish Kim was allowed to write more songs for the Pixies, because ‘Gigantic’ is the best Pixies song and Kim wrote it.” The same year, Nirvana would take the Breeders on tour and Cobain would later admit to Deal, in a joint interview with UK ambassador to grunge Everett True, “I loved Pod so much that I was really freaked out to meet you.” Much has been made of Cobain’s characteristically self-deprecating insistence that “Smells Like Teen Spirit” was really just a Pixies rip-off, appropriating a dynamic that was “soft and quiet and then loud and hard.” But the influence of Pod seems to run even deeper in his music. Its sensibility is palpable not just in the song structures on Nirvana’s two major-label studio albums, or in their decision to hire Pod’s producer, Steve Albini, to record In Utero. (Though Albini also produced the Pixies’ debut album, Surfer Rosa, he has often expressed his preference for the Breeders. On Marc Maron’s WTF podcast in 2015, he opined that Deal was a “genius,” but “the Pixies, as a band, they were fine. Whatever.”) There is also a striking similarity between Cobain’s preoccupations and the themes of the Breeders’ debut: loneliness, disgust, trauma, sex, childhood, introspection, anatomy, intoxication, psychosis. The songs evoke isolation but never feel desolate, swaddled as they are, almost to the point of suffocation, in the warm, druggy, dissociative fog that the Cobain of In Utero would name “your magnet tar-pit trap” and “the comfort in being sad” and “a Leonard Cohen afterworld.” Nothing could’ve been farther from the kind of music Deal and Donelly started out trying to make, the night they left a Sugarcubes show in 1989 determined to get rich off a dance hit. Unfortunately for their bank accounts, neither had a “Regina” in her. “We started it and figured out we couldn’t do it for beans,” Donelly told the L.A. Times in 1990. “We had no idea what to do.” They also realized that their existing record deals would prohibit them—both impressive songwriters whose contributions to their original bands were being minimized or overshadowed by bigger personalities—from sharing primary writing credits on any Breeders album. So they decided to take turns. Pod turned out to be a half-hour of brooding sketches Deal had already written. Donelly was supposed to be next, but her material got kicked far enough down the road that she wound up extricating herself from the Breeders and Throwing Muses’ fragile visionary Kristin Hersh to found Belly. Deal recounted the often grotesque backstory behind each track in early interviews. “Glorious” opens the album with playful, preverbal babble, as the dual guitars wind around each other, Pixies style. Deal repeats the minimal chorus—“It’s glorious”—as if in a reverie, stretching the final syllable like she’s desperate to hold onto the word. This, apparently, is a song about being molested by an aunt; the tea she mentions in one verse is made of psychedelic mushrooms. Built on a skeletal bassline from Josephine Wiggs, formerly the bassist for onetime Pixies openers the Perfect Disaster, and fleshed out with meaty arena-rock riffs, “Hellbound” is the cartoonishly gory tale of a fetus that survives an abortion. In a less literal sense, Deal told Option, it’s “about creating stupid stuff, creating messes. Sometimes we all do dumb things and say, ‘Oh look, I've created an abortion and it lives.’” “Oh!” shares its languid, alt-country vibe with Mazzy Star, whose first album came out the same month as Pod. But what sounds like a delicate love song, softened by gentle backing vocals from Michael Allen of the Wolfgang Press and plaintive violin from Ed’s Redeeming Qualities co-founder Carrie Bradley, is allegedly about what it’s like to be an insect. But this is information you can only really get from reading about the album. Though the lyrics are technically in English, it might as well have been recorded in a private language. When you’re actually listening to Pod, what resonates, more than any specific narrative, is the mood. Each line of Deal’s songwriting is a discreet smear of paint, legible in isolation or as part of the composite whole, but rarely as part of its immediate surroundings. “Fortunately Gone,” a concise little sock-hop jam that bounces atop drum beats from Slint’s Britt Walford (a last-minute addition to the group, on the advice of Albini), makes its torch-song wistfulness felt in Deal and Donelly’s sweetly overlapping vocals and in images like the one that opens the track: “I wait for you in heaven/On this perfect string of love.” Try to follow that train of thought through the next few lines—“And drink your soup of magpies in a/Pottery bowl that looks/As I am now, brown, round and warm”—and you’re lost. At the same time, “brown, round and warm” makes its own kind of sense; it describes the song’s sensory effect completely. Pod can be so intensely physical as to test the line between exhilaration and obliteration. “Hour by hour!” Deal howls over and over as cymbals clang and guitars scratch on “Iris”—a track whose snarl contains the DNA of Hole’s blistering 1991 debut, Pretty on the Inside—and you’re imprisoned with her, watching the hands of the clock crawl. “Limehouse” is tactile in the extreme; so vivid it’s almost sticky, Deal’s description of how “warm black tar forms balls” cements the title’s reference to East London’s 19th-century opium district. Then she hands us the pipe as the interplay between verses creates a narcotic tunnel vision on one or two instruments between maximal choruses that whip the band into an ecstatic frenzy. “I’m in a lime house!” Deal keeps screaming, building up to sensory overload. There are plenty of charming hooks on Pod, but it’s most powerful at moments like this, with its lurid imagery amplified to the max and churned up by repetition into an annihilating force. The Breeders’ shoegaze contemporaries also lived to overwhelm, but they required so much studio embellishment to get there. Albini, in his usual self-demoted capacity as engineer, did the opposite. After Deal and Donelly’s considerably bouncier demo tape convinced 4AD head Ivo Watts-Russell to invest $11,000 in the project, the band spent a couple weeks at Edinburgh’s Palladium Studios with Albini, who wrapped up the sessions early and sent them home with recordings that were slower, rougher and sludgier than the material they’d brought him. The isolation and darkness and physicality and rot had always been present in Deal’s songs. Just as he’d go on to do with many other classic alternative albums, from PJ Harvey’s Rid of Me to In Utero, Albini simply kept the Breeders from tempering the weirdness and abjection in what they’d created. Yet Pod turned out to be every bit as inviting as it was creepy. As Albini understands it, “The two elements always at war in Kim’s music are prettiness and decadence, the deb and the dirtbag each holding a ladder for the other.” For all its rawness, his production also establishes intimacy. By weaving in snippets of casual studio conversation and abruptly halting tracks before they have a chance to get boring, he recreates the messy energy of a DIY show in the listener’s headphones. The album’s comforting aspects may have also reflected how pleasant the recording process was. Deal told stories about the band’s time in Scotland, rhapsodizing over “sheep walking along the front lawn of the house we were recording in,” and summing up the experience as “cozy, like going to winter camp, or being in a pajama party."" Whatever alchemy was at work, it made Pod the kind of record that feels like the listener’s own secret no matter how popular it gets. The Raincoats’ self-titled debut, the Shaggs’ Philosophy of the World or Young Marble Giants’ Colossal Youth—all Cobain favorites—have the same quality. With the partial exception of Nevermind, Nirvana albums are just the same: intimate, sensory, and psychological rather than cerebral or distanced. Deal articulated the difference between her music and the Pixies’ in 1990: “Do I write the same kind of songs as Charles? No! Get outta here! I don’t care about the Bible! I don’t care about UFOs!” You can imagine Cobain, who wrote about bodies and babies and heroin and feeling alone, heartily agreeing. If he shaped grunge, then the Breeders helped shape him. And he returned the favor, unintentionally, by creating a captive audience for their future releases. I wish Deal got more credit for her impact on Cobain. It seems like a small thing, but Nirvana marked the convergence of mainstream and underground rock, catalyzing a permanent shift that only accelerated in the 21st century. And they’re usually placed in a lineage that begins with the Beatles, touches on punk and winds down with a list of mostly male ’80s indie acts: Mudhoney, R.E.M., the Meat Puppets, Pixies. Even as pop culture grows ever more eager to vanquish the appearance of sexism, we hear so little about how female musicians—or female artists in any medium—influence their male peers. It’s as though such a relationship would violate some natural hierarchy of creativity. And that’s one way pioneering women get written out of the history of their art form (see: Hilma af Klint, Clarice Lispector, Sister Rosetta Tharpe). It took Last Splash for the Breeders to win a place in the alt-rock canon, land of sold-out reunion tours and fat licensing checks. But without Pod, that canon might have looked very different.

Comma,Sam Prekop,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f57d7877b657428acd200e7/1:1/w_160/comma_sam%20prekop.jpg,2020-09-12 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/sam-prekop-comma/,Thrill Jockey,"The best thing about Sam Prekop’s solo electronic music is the way that it leaves space for the listener. Across three albums—2010’s Old Punch Card, 2015’s The Republic, and now Comma—the Sea and Cake frontman has used modular synthesizers to make pieces that don’t fit neatly into any one category; nor do they tell you how to feel or suggest what the music might be good for. Prekop gives you a handful of carefully chosen sounds and then bends, stretches, and arranges them into beguiling shapes until they sink back into nothingness. Seemingly by design, the particular “meaning” of a given track—not just in terms of genre, but the emotional content—is entirely up to you. By listening to Prekop’s creations—taking in the array of sounds, noting placements and proportions, and mapping the result onto our own memories and associations—we also complete them. Compared to its two predecessors, Comma has rhythms and melodies that suggest pop, if never quite embracing the verse/chorus form. In a recent interview with Chicago Magazine, Prekop admitted he allowed the music to drift in a more song-oriented direction when assembling this record, and he also mentioned adding new hardware alongside his modular synth rig, including a Roland SH-101 (a favorite of Boards of Canada) and a drum machine. The continuous pulse, marking the passage of time, is one of the record’s core elements, but there’s nothing like a dance beat here. We often equate “space” with silence, and there’s not a lot of it on Comma—Prekop fills the sound field at all times, which is partly why Comma demands attention, even though it’s occasionally quiet. This isn’t background music. The synth textures, generally clean and clear, so that your ear can pry one layer apart from another if you wish, evoke the last few decades of the 20th century, when it was still possible for electronic technology to convey hope. The drifting “September Remember,” which begins with a gentle drone and a steady click that’s bathed in dubby artificial reverb, is as close as the record comes to ambient music proper, and there’s something uncanny about it. It’s not especially “warm” in the way we think of modular synth music by, say, Emily Sprague or Cool Maritime, nor does it have the chilly distance of digital, more overtly ’80s-flavored synth music. It hangs between these poles, floating back and forth, a chime pushed by the wind. Elsewhere, Comma embraces beauty unreservedly, though still with characteristic subtlety. “Approaching” is particularly gorgeous, with its throbs of static and hiss, metallic shimmer of percussion, and a music-box synth melody. It offers the kind of tech-aided path to the sublime that Kraftwerk sometimes laid out in their earliest work, though Prekop goes easy on the drama. “Wax Wing” begins with the sort of eerie synth Brian Eno favored on Apollo, and then Prekop subjects it to weird processing, turning it into a high-pitched squiggle that allows you to picture what happens when one harnesses electricity but just barely controls it. Comma is an unusually immersive record, with evident foregrounds and backgrounds, and sometimes you can feel the music moving past you as it unfolds. At one point during “Never Met,” an acid-inflected synth pattern seems to appear in the distance, gradually inch closer, and then brush by you before proceeding on to somewhere else. Prekop makes choices, placing elements in the stereo field according to his sense of design, but the individual affective response to his choices could go any number of ways. Once again, it’s possible to imagine the music as open-ended, a series of intriguing possibilities not pointing anywhere in particular. We, the audience, do half the work, simply by being engaged as the music unfolds. It’s tricky to praise music so clearly based on form and balance. Comma isn’t filled with a mind-warping atmosphere you’ve heard nowhere else, it’s not an invitation to meditate or do yoga, and it probably won’t make you cry. It offers something ineffable that I can best call a “presence,” and its ability to center you in the here and now is, in its own low-key and meticulous way, overwhelming.","On his third album created primarily with modular synthesizers, the longtime Sea and Cake frontman makes fascinatingly abstracted music about the act of listening itself.

All That Emotion,Hannah Georgas,by: Hannah Jocelyn,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f57b54f7eefad57b1837166/1:1/w_160/all%20that%20emotion_hannah%20georgas.jpg,2020-09-12 05:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/hannah-georgas-all-that-emotion/,Arts & CraftsBrassland,"In 2009, Hannah Georgas wrote a song about hoping to run into an ex at a National concert. Like most of Georgas’s music, “The National” is both an internal monologue and an address, the things she thinks but would not say: “The other day someone mentioned your name/It brought back hurt and all your pain.” As the National became arena-rock stars, and the band’s Aaron Dessner a celebrated producer in his own right, Georgas found success in her home country of Canada, garnering multiple Juno Award nominations across three albums. In 2018, after a year spent recording demos alone, she and Dessner began to collaborate on a fourth. While the Dessner-ification erodes some of Georgas’s own artistic identity, All That Emotions is stately and well-made. Dessner still produces with the intimacy of someone making music in their garage—it’s just that the garage is now an upstate New York barn whose exterior covers a Grammy-winning album, and the sound is usually recognizable as National-adjacent. Where Georgas’ lightly chaotic music previously matched her quirky lyrics about emotionless robots and naked beaches, Dessner submerges her words in soft drum machines and felt pianos, and Georgas tones down her performances to match. On “Just a Phase,” her melodies often anticipate or echo the guitar lines, content to blend into the sound. On opener “That Emotion,” the melodies are drawn-out and laconic, the delivery laid-back and unobtrusive. The stylistic balance of the album tilts in Dessner’s favor, which can mean that All That Emotion sounds like Taylor Swift’s folklore sounds like Eve Owen’s Don’t Let the Ink Dry sounds like Trouble Will Find Me. The one-size-fits-all approach leads to the occasional clash, as on “Easy,” where Georgas’s modest soft-rock chorus sits awkwardly over fussy Dessner crescendos. Even then, Dessner and engineer Jonathan Low keep the production immersive enough that the discrepancies are easy to ignore. Georgas and Dessner’s most successful synthesis is tucked away at the end: “Habits” soars in a way that the rest of the album actively avoids. It’s still a classic slow build, but the harmonies and guitar squeals create the same feeling of intoxication that powers Dessner’s most lavish productions. With Dessner handling the music, Georgas defines herself through her internal monologues. “I don’t want to hold on to you,” she sings on “Change,” positing that because “love is change,” there’s no reason to stay if a relationship becomes fraught. “Someone I Don’t Know” deepens the expected sentiment, willing an ex to become unrecognizable: “Someday I’ll get over you... You’ll become something I forgot.” “Punching Bag,” a song that somehow mixes the dread of Radiohead’s “Idioteque” with Alanis Morrissette’s garrulous “Front Row,” takes the tension to a logical extreme. Though Georgas sings about needing to “save” someone, the background lyrics reveal her ambivalence: “I take you for a walk to a place that means so much to me/And go for your hand to hold you and you pull away immediately.” It’s the only moment on the album that truly feels surprising. By insisting on quiet loveliness in all aspects of its production, All That Emotion misses out on the weirder and more fascinating elements of Georgas’ older music. The Casio SK-1 Homestar Runner drums of “Bang Bang You’re Dead” or the distortion of “Enemies” would be welcome on this record. Though Emotion is refined, it also isn’t different from Dessner’s other production work—it’s still musically reticent, covered in fog. Its clarity originates in Georgas’ ability to process what she’s feeling, and spending 40 minutes in her head as she figures things out doesn’t feel suffocating. There’s always just enough reason, an poignant insight or an intricate guitar line, to stay.","Produced with the National’s Aaron Dessner, the introspective Canadian singer-songwriter’s stately fourth album evokes an atmosphere of quiet loveliness.

American Head,The Flaming Lips,by: Stuart Berman,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f57af9af5e6f1d3e7d3d559/1:1/w_160/american%20head_the%20flaming%20lips.jpg,2020-09-11 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/the-flaming-lips-american-head/,Warner,"Thirty years ago this month, the Flaming Lips released their first game-changing album: 1990’s In a Priest Driven Ambulance. After spending the ‘80s trying to figure out if they wanted to be a prog Replacements or a punk Floyd, the Lips outfitted Priest with an interstellar noise-pop sound that nonetheless retained a distinctly Oklahoman flavor, complete with fairground noises, field recordings of crickets, and strange songs about Jesus. In a Priest Driven Ambulance was also the first installment in what would become a Lips tradition: releasing pace-setting albums at each turn of the decade. Nine years later, their orchestral opus The Soft Bulletin ushered in the band’s imperial phase, while 2009’s Embryonic portended an extended period of wild, anti-pop experimentation. The band’s first album of the 2020s likewise marks another significant change in course; in this case, however, it feels less like the start of a new journey than a homecoming. In sharp contrast to the Lips’ recent adventures in fairytale fantasias, American Head finds its inspiration in an arcane piece of Oklahoma musical lore. After revisiting the Tom Petty documentary Runnin’ Down A Dream following the rock legend’s 2017 death, Lips ringleader Wayne Coyne became fixated with the story of Petty’s pre-Heartbreakers band, Mudcrutch, with whom Petty spent time in Tulsa in the early-’70s en route to L.A. From that anecdote, Coyne and multi-instrumentalist Steven Drozd envisioned American Head as a work of speculative fiction, reimagining the Lips as the sort of drugged-out local Oklahoman rock band that might’ve hung out and jammed with a pre-fame Petty while he was passing through town. As it turns out, that mythical ‘70s scenario is really just a roundabout way of getting the Lips back to where they were in the ‘90s. American Head retains some of the symphonic sweep of the Soft Bulletin era and the freaky futurism of their post-Embryonic state, but, at its core, we find the band rekindling their past romance with Neil Young’s piano ballads, the Beatles’ psychedelic guitar tones, and Bowie’s stargazing anthems. Likewise, Coyne approaches his favorite topics—love, drugs, and death—from a less existential, more personal vantage, grounding his narratives in more naturalistic settings. Instead of tunes about killer robots and unicorns with purple eyes, we get songs about people working in slaughterhouses and slinging coke on the side to get by, fond teenage memories of taking quaaludes and frightening recollections of trying LSD, and dramatizations of actual traumatic incidents from Coyne’s early years. In the 2005 band documentary The Fearless Freaks, we see old home-movie footage of Coyne and his brothers enjoying a typical ’70s all-American adolescence, playing pick-up football with the local longhairs, before a darker narrative emerges—specifically of the drug habit that would land his brother Tommy in and out of prison. American Head feels like it was born from this moment of innocence lost. Though not a narrative concept album per se, each song feels like a vignette from some tragic sequel to Dazed and Confused, where carefree teenage kicks have given way to the unforgiving realities of young adulthood. (And while it’s not an explicitly autobiographical work, tellingly, one of its doomed characters is also named Tommy.) “What went wrong?/Now all your friends are gone,” Coyne sings on the album’s majestically melancholy opener, “Will You Return/When You Come Down,” and as American Head plays out, that absence takes many forms. On the equally crestfallen “Flowers of Neptune 6,” his old acid-eating pals are getting shipped off to war or thrown in jail; on the moving orchestral centerpiece “Mother I’ve Taken LSD,” his youthful naivete turns to sorrow as he sings of an addict friend taken off to a psych ward and another on life support after a motorcycle crash. But as the album’s title suggests, these sorts of crises are endemic to the American psyche and perpetuate themselves for generations. While these songs may be loosely based on incidents in Coyne’s past, they speak soundly to the country’s current condition, where working-class teens are still often forced to choose between the army, addiction, prison, or death. “Now, I see the sadness in the world,” Coyne sings on the latter track as the strings come in, “I’m sorry I didn’t see it before.” It’s a line that hits especially hard in 2020, when much of the world is both pining to go back to the way things were pre-COVID while having their eyes pried open to the social ills and inequalities that have been festering all along. But American Head handles this heavy subject matter with a light touch, framing its stories in a magic-realist sunset atmosphere that lends even its gravest songs an earthbound charm. The barnyard sound effects and countrified breakdown of “You n Me Sellin’ Weed”—a folksy ode to young dealers in love—nod to the group’s more playful mid-’90s catalog, as do the dixie-glam guitar slides throughout the record that summon the spirit of the group’s former string-bender Ronald Jones. And for added authentic southern flavor, three tracks feature vocals from Kacey Musgraves, the latest pop star to get roped into the Lips’ supersonic circus. However, in contrast to their previous match-ups with Kesha and Miley, Musgraves serves more as a textural enhancement to the album’s fading-summer milieu, lending her dreamy wordless sighs to the instrumental “Watching the Lightbugs Glow” like someone familiar with the sight, and floating in the background of its companion track “Flowers of Neptune 6” as if beaming in harmonies from the afterlife. Even on their proper duet “God and the Policeman,” she isn’t so much seizing the spotlight from Coyne as playing the angel on his shoulder in a moment of crisis. American Head hits its emotional peak with the plaintive ballad “Mother Please Don’t Be Sad,” a fictionalized account of Coyne’s real-life experience getting robbed at gunpoint while working at a Long John Silver’s back in the ‘80s; here, he imagines himself getting fatally shot and bidding his mom adieu with “Bohemian Rhapsody”-worthy gravitas, before the song’s hypnotic psych-jazz sequel “When We Die When We’re High” thrusts him toward the white light. But American Head arrives at a calming full-circle conclusion with “My Religion Is You,” which provides a handy yardstick for just how much the Lips have changed in the past 30 years—and how much they haven’t. On In a Priest Driven Ambulance, the Lips capped off a set of sacreligious psychedelia with a ramshackle yet earnest cover of Louis Armstrong’s “What a Wonderful World”—an early indication of Coyne’s future role as alt-rock’s leading motivational speaker. “My Religion Is You” is an infinitely more elegant performance, yet Coyne’s affinity for simple, optimistic sentiment remains. On the surface, it’s a song of devotion expressed in the language of heretics—”I don’t need no religion,” Coyne sings, “all I need is you.” But, coming at the end of a record that’s largely about grappling with loss and change, “My Religion Is You” is an open invitation for you to hold onto whatever it is—whether it’s Jesus, Buddha, or, in Coyne’s case, family—that can help make this scary world feel a little more wonderful.","At the top of their fifth decade, the Lips rekindle their past romance with Neil Young’s piano ballads, the Beatles’ psychedelic guitar tones, and Bowie’s stargazing anthems on a deeply personal album.

pop songs 2020 EP,BUMPER,by: Quinn Moreland,Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f57a9638dc0aec7be566a1b/1:1/w_160/pop%20songs%202020%20ep_bumper.jpg,2020-09-11 05:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/bumper-pop-songs-2020-ep/,self-released,"Recently, a few critics have classified the year 2013 as a pivotal moment for mainstream music. Remember those days of yore, back when Vampire Weekend reigned supreme, Chance the Rapper felt groundbreaking, and Sky Ferreira actually released music? But 2013 was also a big time for the little guys. That summer, Michelle Zauner, then a member of the rock band Little Big League, shared her first project as Japanese Breakfast, an experimental song-a-day collection titled june. A few months later, Crying, an indie rock by way of chiptune trio out of SUNY Purchase, released their bubbly debut, Get Olde. Now, Zauner and Crying guitarist Ryan Galloway have collaborated under the name BUMPER. Though Galloway and Zauner live in the same Brooklyn neighborhood, due to COVID-19 quarantine restrictions, BUMPER’s debut EP, pop songs 2020, was constructed over email. These four songs benefit from the ease of its creation; the stakes feel low, just two friends passing drafts back and forth like pen pals. pop songs 2020 fully indulges the grandiose flourishes that wind through Zauner and Galloway’s respective projects. Opening track “You Can Get It!” is a jolt of pop effervescence that begins with whimsical Lullatone-like electronica and blooms into wistful ’80s sparkle; the impromptu guitar solo that rips through the ending is just icing on the cake. “Red Brick” is similarly pleasant: “Day by day, you give and take/On and on until there’s something,” Zauner sings as the boom of a timpani crashes through her veil of uncertainty. The track is full of other eccentric embellishments—swelling strings, corkscrewing synths—but never becomes bogged down by its jam-packed arrangement. Lyrically, pop songs 2020 leans towards the gauzy. There’s a general sentiment of chasing something just out of reach, but the verses are hardly specific. “Black Light” approaches an emotional arc as the song’s narrator gazes at a night-owl neighbor devoted to his beats. “First light flits shy in the distance/Your techno jam is through,” a double-tracked Zauner breathily murmurs. “I close my eyes but my heart’s still thumping/And in my dreams your loops.” As a whole, the EP offers a much-needed dopamine rush, but it ends on a melancholic moment. The aptly-titled closer “Ballad O” is a gentle piano and synth reverie that soundtracks the recollection of various mistakes and regrets. “I never knew I’d wind up here, to take up arms/At men at bars,” Zauner concludes forlornly. Since the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic, some have fretted about whether or not upbeat pop music has a place during an international time of mourning and upheaval. But pop songs 2020 is a reminder that euphoric music will always be a balm, a temporary escape from reality.","Michelle Zauner (a.k.a. Japanese Breakfast) and Ryan Galloway of Crying form a socially distanced, easy-going pop duo whose music offers a brief respite from the times.

The Fire Still Burns,Alan Braufman,by: Marc Masters,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f57b1757b657428acd200e0/1:1/w_160/the%20fire%20still%20burns_alan%20braufman.jpg,2020-09-11 05:00:00,Jazz,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/alan-braufman-the-fire-still-burns/,Valley of Search,"For crate-digging devotees of underground jazz, the 2018 rediscovery of saxophonist Alan Braufman’s 1975 album Valley of Search was an exciting development. Sparked by Braufman’s nephew (and Pitchfork contributor) Nabil Ayers, the reissue—originally recorded in the Tribeca loft Braufman shared with other musicians—added a small but vital piece to the puzzle of ’70s New York jazz. Braufman’s energetic quartet, including pianist and loftmate Gene Ashton, now known as Cooper-Moore, produced high-octane music, firing out each track in a single take. But it turns out the Valley of Search reissue wasn’t the most exciting result of Ayers’ uncle-prodding. Not long after its release, Braufman, who moved to Utah in the ’90s, played with Cooper-Moore for the first time in decades, and Ayers suggested they make a new album. Braufman had spent the intervening years touring with other groups (including stints with Philip Glass and Psychedelic Furs) and recording as Alan Michael, but this would be just his second record under his own name. Brainstorming during commutes to his teaching gig at Utah State University, he quickly concocted a set of songs and assembled a quintet with Cooper-Moore’s help. They recorded The Fire Still Burns in a single day last September, at an upstate New York studio owned by the National. As good as Valley of Search is, The Fire Still Burns is bigger and better. While Braufman and Cooper-Moore’s first album hinted at different modes, it dealt mostly in outward-bound free jazz. But here they weave many stylistic strands into a whirlwind performance. Brain-sticking hooks skid into impulsive sprints; moments of abandon build to straight-up swing. At times the group rockets away completely, only to hurtle back into grounded rhythms and repetitive vamps. The result is a sturdy suite that nods vigorously toward jazz history while sounding as fresh and immediate as a concert happening right in front of you. That combination is captured best in “Home,” which Braufman wrote on a piano in just 20 minutes. It’s an instant classic centered on a huge hook that feels ripped from a lost ’60’s Impulse or Blue Note long-player. Opening with that riff over bassist Ken Filiano’s bowed strings, Braufman and tenor saxophonist James Brandon Lewis quickly ignite; when Andrew Drury’s insistent drumming lifts it, the group takes full flight. Along the way, Cooper-Moore’s piano chords flit around the rising horn figure, making “Home” feel both dizzyingly overwhelming and fundamentally reassuring. It blows you away, then catches your fall. “Home” would be a big achievement on its own, but on The Fire Still Burns, no single tune exists in its own vacuum. Impeccably sequenced, with subtle fade-outs and hardly any pause between tracks, it plays like an eight-part suite (an effect inspired by Brafuman’s favorite Don Cherry albums, which he notes featured “tunes [that] didn’t stop, they evolve”). The thematic consistency comes mostly from group’s enthusiastic energy, allowing them to flow from the ceremonial piano strains of “Morning Bazaar” into the Ornette Coleman-like twists of “No Floor No Ceiling,” and from the loose, wandering title track into the syncopated funk of “City Nights.” Their vigor is so strong, it even turns the nearly saccharine ballad “Alone Again” into a sort of howling prayer, due purely to the collective heat of their tireless playing. Perhaps that heat is what Braufman means when he says The Fire Still Burns. If so, it’s a convincing claim: He and Cooper-Moore haven’t lost any intensity in five decades, and their quintet sparks from the first note and never dampens. As flames engulf America in many ways, the title has added significance; like the ’60s jazz it echoes, Braufman’s music reflects turbulent times and impassioned resistance. But even with its many reference points, The Fire Still Burns shines a light all its own, fueled by unbowed creative minds.","Following the recent rediscovery of his 1975 album Valley of Search, the saxophonist releases a quintet set of all-new compositions that nod to jazz history while rocketing off to points unknown.

Re-Animator,Everything Everything,by: Hannah Jocelyn,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f57a39f8dc0aec7be566a18/1:1/w_160/re-animator_everything%20everything.jpg,2020-09-11 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/everything-everything-re-animator/,Infinity Industries,"As their peers in Foals and alt-J found international success, Manchester eccentrics Everything Everything kept refining and distilling their paranoid, hyperactive pop. Lead singer Jonathan Higgs became a British Cassandra, observing rising anti-immigrant sentiments and worldwide tension on Get to Heaven well before the Brexit referendum and the 2016 American election. The band became a cult favorite instead of a crossover success story, disguising anthems about ISIS recruitment and suicide bombers in glossy pop production. On Re-Animator, Higgs has found inspiration in the idea of the bicameral mind, an esoteric (give or take a mention on Westworld) psychological theory positning that before the emergence of consciousness, humans interpreted their own thoughts as auditory hallucinations. If this wasn’t a band who made a soaring anthem out of the line “It’s alright to feel like a fat child in a pushchair...old enough to fire a gun,” this would be too heady, and as is, it’s out-there, even for this band. As if to mitigate the dense subject matter, they knocked the record out in two weeks with John Congleton, focusing on simplicity. As a result, Re-Animator lacks the overwhelming chaos of their best music, but it’s their most thoughtful work yet. As a consequence of the quick recording, they’ve never sounded less like their name. There are fewer genres hopped than usual—there’s some dub on “Lost Powers,” some decadent No Shape vibes on “In Birdsong,” but the turn towards conventional indie rock is a canny move for a band heading into their second decade. The surprise is the lack of surprise, the focus on craft and mood over stimulating detail. There are no vocal chops like early single “Kemosabe,” no freeform tangents like those on A Fever Dream’s centerpiece “Put Me Together.” There are occasional quirks, like when Higgs amusingly alludes to Jay-Z’s infamous “Monster” verse on “It Was a Monstering,” but even that’s tacked on to an otherwise straightforward Radiohead homage. This sparseness leads to some uncharacteristically weak studio recordings: “Planets” features all the components of captivating prog-pop, but the insistence on space flattens the song, and a groove change winds up anticlimactic instead of invigorating. The motorik beat of “Violent Sun” veers too close to alternative radio stalwarts like Blue October and the Killers for comfort, and there’s something intrinsically underwhelming about the way the pre-chorus and the chorus hinge on the same chord, like magnets repelling one another. Higgs nearly makes up for the album’s deficiencies with his lyrics, which are more direct than ever. “Sun” is an urgent “last chance before the night ends”-type song, and their most romantic ever. It’s thrilling to hear Higgs apply his odd-but-visceral writing style to a love song: “You can barely make a silhouette out/And you open your ventriloquist mouth/And the words are wrong but in the right order.” The bicameral-mind concept pops up in several songs, most notably in “The Actor,” where Higgs’ narrator comes to terms with the other voice in their head (“if we look the same/then I don’t mind”). There’s the typical fascination with the grotesque—“Arch Enemy” follows a protagonist associating the other voice in their head with a sentient fatberg, the latter hilariously depicted in the song’s music video. When it stumbles, like the flimsy verses of “Black Hyena,” it’s less a matter of underwriting than a stylistic risk that doesn’t always pay off. The album hits hardest when Higgs’ lyrics collide with the band’s penchant for bombast. “Big Climb” is a furious screed against a world failing to properly deal with its crises until the inhabitants are “dancing on the ocean floor.” It features some of Higgs’ best imagery—the “curved glass in a desert full of sun,” the “gas crawling like the ghost of the sea.” All this is set to outright stadium rock, a genre so fitting to Everything Everything’s extroversion that it’s a wonder they don’t go for broke like that more often. “Big Climb” is so exciting that it’s a shame most of the album is so reserved. Re-Animator still holds its own against their other music; at their most traditional, they remain smart songwriters, and even their weaker lyrical moments are more thought-provoking than their peers. They’re likely not going back to the doomsaying of Man Alive any time soon—Higgs acknowledges he’s “too old to be crying out” on “Violent Sun.” But even at this slower pace, in this quieter register, one of the world’s most restless bands finds more uncharted territory.","The latest from the Manchester cult favorites lacks the overwhelming chaos of their best music, but it’s their most thoughtful work yet.

Detroit 2,Big Sean,by: Drew Millard,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f52b53c13228581eaf281b9/1:1/w_160/detroit%202_big%20sean.jpg,2020-09-10 05:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/big-sean-detroit-2/,GoodDef Jam,"In the late 2000s and early 2010s, Big Sean was like a streetwear Tumblr come to life, able to rap like Gucci Mane’s kid brother in one song, only to shift gears and drop a pretty serviceable Consequence impression in the next. The Detroit rapper’s manic energy and corny punchlines recalled Quagmire from Family Guy, a comparison that Sean himself stoked on his 2011 track “I Do It,” when he spent a few lines rhyming things with “giggity-giggity” and then rapped, “I’m Quagmire.” His “Marvin & Chardonnay” fit like a glove within the dizzying heights of Rustie’s transcendent 2012 Essential Mix, while the Nicki Minaj collaboration “Dance (A$$)” yielded both a pitch-perfect homage to the ghettotech of his hometown as well as perhaps the decade’s finest song about butts. Before too long, he’d carved out a niche for himself as a squeaky-voiced goofball, a fast-rapping Fabolous soundalike who was a welcome addition to any posse cut, able to parachute into songs provide some high-energy levity, and tastefully bow out before you had a chance to think too hard about what the hell an ass-state is. The problem, though, is what happens when you’re stuck with a whole album’s worth of Big Sean. He doesn’t make bad records per se—this is a guy who releases music under the imprimatur of Kanye West, so there’s a certain level of grim competence to each of his full-lengths—it’s just that every time Big Sean attempts to reveal a deeper side of himself, he can’t help but come across as a woefully unpleasant person. On Detroit 2, the rapper’s fifth solo album and the ostensible sequel to his 2012 mixtape, Big Sean positions himself as an enlightened despot. He rules over a kingdom in which wisdom is gained by woo-woo self-help books, relationships are transactional (“I can’t waste the sex on you and give you everything you can’t give me back”), and cancel culture is an existential threat to your brand (“It only takes one time to fuck up your whole Wikipedia.”) Between that stuff, the multiple judgments he renders on people’s “vibes,” and the ayahuasca reference on “FEED,” it seems like Big Sean has spent the past few years internalizing the hyper-capitalism of the early-’70s New Age movement. Sure, at least it’s an ethos, but the places it takes Big Sean to feel incongruous with our current moment. Take “Lucky Me,” the album’s second track. Over a shaggy soul beat from Hit-Boy and DJ Dahi, Sean reflects on the fact that he has dated numerous famous women, building up to the line, “It’s a living nightmare when your dream girl has to get canceled.” It’s a sentiment that feels vapid on its face, and becomes borderline sociopathic when you recall that earlier this summer, Big Sean’s ex-girlfriend, the actress Naya Rivera, died in a boating accident while saving her son’s life. Even if the line is meant to be about another woman, Big Sean’s insistence that someone’s personal struggles might specifically be a problem for him is, well, jarring. Things take a turn for the even more bizarre just moments later in “Lucky Me,” when Sean starts rapping about how he was diagnosed with a heart condition at 19, only for a naturopath to cure it with magnesium. “That’s how I know that Western medicine weak,” he concludes, the rare hint of bass in his voice. Which, fine, but also, we are currently experiencing the biggest public health crisis in a hundred years. He doesn’t have a moral duty or anything to not rap stuff like this—or, for that matter, “No sir, I don’t even do flu shots” from the otherwise pretty-great “Harder Than My Demons”—but it does make listening to Big Sean during a pandemic feel more pointless than it usually does. Unfortunately, on many of the songs where Big Sean leaves his personal feelings about Western medicine to the side, he falls into the trap of assuming the style of a particular trend or artist but never quite selling the pose. Instead, he remains almost entirely anonymous. He sounds kinda like Young Thug on the song that Young Thug is on, kinda like Travis Scott on the song that Travis Scott is on, kinda like Wale on the song that Wale is on, and kinda like Lil Wayne on the song that Lil Wayne is on. And whenever he’s not employing a double-time flow, he gives the listener enough time to consider the absolute vapidity of lyrics like, “Laser focus, AOL, been had AIM,” or, “Full circle like exactly what the fuck karma is,” or, “My third eye and fourth eye open… damn.” There are moments on Detroit 2 that feel special, but Big Sean himself rarely has anything to do with them. Dave Chappelle, Erykah Badu, and Stevie Wonder each pop up on interludes to tell delightful little stories that don’t necessarily involve Big Sean himself. (Chappelle’s, for instance, is about smoking weed with Danny Brown and then meeting Big Sean’s dad.) Eight of the record’s beats were handled by Hit-Boy, who transposes his stadium-sized sensibilities onto even the most sedate instrumentals in ways that are never not thrilling. On “The Baddest,” No I.D. takes a crack at flipping the same Godzilla-theme sample from Pharoahe Monch’s “Simon Says,” ends up recreating the track he’s paying homage to but with skittering trap drums, and it sounds so good that not even Big Sean can fuck it up. Lil Wayne absolutely tears into the loop of Michael Jackson’s “Human Nature” that undergirds “Don Life,” blowing his host out of the water and momentarily sketching out an alternate universe where the best beats on the album found their way into Wayne’s hands. By far the best and most ambitious track on the album is “Friday Night Cypher,” which stitches together the past, present, and future of Detroit’s hip-hop scene. Over the course of nine and a half minutes, Sean invites a cast ranging from Tee Grizzley to Payroll Giovanni to Kash Doll to Boldy James to Eminem himself to showcase what makes them great, with ambient cheering and a contiguous, constantly shifting beat helping recreate the hazy vibe of a late-evening cut-up session in the studio. Sean’s tucked into the middle of the track and is absolutely in his element, touching on the Based God’s Curse(s), Meek Mill’s “Tony Story” story-raps, and browsing Zillow for kicks and giggles. It’s fun, effortless nonsense—in other words, the Platonic ideal of a Big Sean verse. And the best part? When his verse is over, Big Sean simply fades into the background, having made his mark and, for once on Detroit 2, not overstaying his welcome.","On his fifth solo album, Big Sean gets personal, leans on a slate of high-profile guests to provide most of the entertainment, and struggles to deliver anything that isn’t fundamentally embarrassing.

Autogenesis,N to The Power,by: Larry Blumenfeld,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f52b0081d29e200f244cba2/1:1/w_160/autogenesis_n%20to%20the%20power.jpg,2020-09-10 05:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/n-to-the-power-autogenesis/,Xenotone,"New York City teems with creative instrumentalists on the run—toward one another, and away from stylistic constraints. They seek tighter connections and a looser environment in which instruments don’t play assigned roles, electric and acoustic are not opposing factions, and “composition” means whatever ends up in the mix. This ideal is neither new (Miles Davis epitomized it a half-century ago) nor uncommon. Still, when realized with elegance and wit, as on Autogenesis, the debut release from N to the Power, it leads to fresh and distinct sounds that straddle our usual categories. This music embraces a global vision, conveying both the edge of experimental music and the buzz of electronica, all the while infused with jazz’s searching spirit. This creative process began with informal jam sessions between multi-instrumentalists Blake Leyh and Tony Jarvis, who are Harlem neighbors. Leyh, who grew up in England, is best known as a film composer and sound designer working with the likes of John Waters and Jonathan Demme; as music supervisor for David Simon’s HBO shows, he was responsible for the lovingly curated live-music sequences in Treme. Jarvis was born and raised in Madison, Wis., where he studied early on with the Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians co-founder Roscoe Mitchell. His professional experience spans enlightened punk (Tar Babies), updated funk (Sharon Jones and the Dap Kings), and straight-up Afrobeat (the Broadway musical Fela!). Maybe there’s too direct a hit of Fela’s infectious, laid-back beats on the “Marrakesh Memosphere,” yet that track achieves the propulsion and buoyancy of the Moroccan Gnawa music that inspired it. This group shares Mitchell’s collectivist vision. Here, as foregrounds and backgrounds shift like savvy cinematography, the community comes off like an indie film’s ensemble cast, with Jarvis’ bass clarinet as the character we’re all rooting for. Rarely does one instrument steal the scene. “Supertonic” assembles a master shot sequence. Flurries of notes from Bruno Coon’s trumpet and Jarvis’ bass clarinet are processed into reverberant halos. Next, Coon, on guitar, sounds out rhythm more than melody, much like a djembe would. Patterns coalesce, lent shape and texture by terse figures from Leyh’s electric cello and glowing long tones from Yusuke Yamamoto’s vibes. Sonic murmurs and suggestive echoes frame the action, their sources manipulated beyond identification. The effect is simultaneously alluring and disorienting. If that track’s overlapping cycles initially suggest minimalism (Steve Reich’s Different Trains), they also shimmy well enough to shake off comparisons. Setting aside the force and grace of cellist Yves Dharamraj’s playing, and of Jarvis’ (primarily on bass clarinet, sax and flute), this music doesn’t stress technique: Many of these parts could be played with just rudimentary skills. The focus is on establishing and disrupting persuasive moods and inviting grooves through instrumental figures played in real time, then chopped and sculpted into charming, oddly shaped forms. Guitars and compelling rhythms abound, yet there’s hardly a chord heard, and no trap set in sight (beats come mostly from hand percussion, cymbals, and plucked strings). This music relies on energy flows, sometimes suggesting rapid motion and other times repose. “The God Particle” starts with a simple flute gesture and grows into something like a New Orleans second-line parade in outer space, its beats heavy but its feel weightless. A 12-and-a-half-minute version of “Peace Piece,” which jazz pianist Bill Evans composed mostly upon a simple ostinato, is elevated by Dharamraj’s expressiveness on acoustic cello and Leyh’s tender touch on a fretted electric one. Its loops reinforce the circular nature of Evans’ concept. In 1962, Evans told a Time magazine reporter that, after playing it at a club, a teenage fan rushed up and said that “when he heard it he felt like he was standing all alone in New York.” This version, offered in the midst of forced social distancing, has the opposite effect: It suggests much-needed communion.","Covering Bill Evans and riffing on Moroccan gnawa and classical minimalism, the 10-piece Harlem band embraces a global vision infused with jazz’s searching spirit.

Western Swing & Waltzes and Other Punchy Songs,Colter Wall,by: Amanda Wicks,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f579b89ab26cfccea68e57a/1:1/w_160/Western%20Swing%20&%20Waltzes%20and%20Other%20Punchy%20Songs_colter%20wall.jpg,2020-09-10 05:00:00,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/colter-wall-western-swing-and-waltzes-and-other-punchy-songs/,La Honda,"Canadian singer-songwriter Colter Wall hasn’t needed much more than his singular voice—a charred, whiskey-soaked baritone that belies his years—to tell colorful tales of the western frontier and the folk heroes who populate it. Across 2017’s self-titled debut and 2018’s follow-up Songs of the Plains, he kept the arrangements sparse, letting his voice pull focus. There was no pressing need for a full backing band when his primary instrument filled a space so completely. With his new album Western Swing & Waltzes and Other Punchy Songs, Wall trades that solitary fare for a new set of stories—and a new way to tell them. Recorded with a full band, Western Swing moves away from Wall’s unvarnished veneration of the Wild West and swings wide the barn doors. This here’s a party. While Dave Cobb produced Songs of the Plains, here Wall takes the reins. Cobb honed Wall’s instincts, stripping his songs down so that they felt like campfire tales traded after a long and lonesome ride. But Wall doesn’t press in quite so tight. His penchant for “atmospheric feel” sounds different: He leaves ample space, layering and texturing each track so the band never overshadows his voice—instead, they cut in and out like dance partners. Odd squeaks bleed through at times, as on “Talkin’ Prairie Boy,” when it sounds as though someone inadvertently opens the studio door. Wall leaves that sound in, as well as his resolute chuckle at the end. Those choices bring Western Swing & Waltzes closer to a live album, further reflecting the hoedown charm the backing band adds. On Song of the Plains, Wall focused his songwriting on wide Canadian vistas and the time—and solitude—it takes to traverse them. But Western Swing & Waltzes gets closer to embodying that capacious sensation. The title track unfurls like a map, an ode to Wall’s native Saskatchewan. “East of beautiful Alberta/North of old Montan’,” he sings about the province, situating it not just physically but spiritually—as a descendent of traditional folk and country’s storied lineage. Wall has regularly sung of the rugged prairie landscape that reared him, but on “Western Swings & Waltzes,” he seems more satisfied to nod to it rather than keep it in sight. It’s a framing song, setting the milieu of the following tracks and their resplendent “punch”: “It’s Western swing and waltzes in Saskatchewan tonight,” he sings, while the band line dances around his voice with fiddle, pedal steel, DeFord Bailey-esque harmonica, and piano. The scuffs and scratches lacing their imaginary dancefloor feel palpable. Western Swing & Waltzes includes only a handful of original songs from Wall, who covers Marty Robbins’s “Big Iron,” Stan Jones’s “Cowpoke,” and Lewis Martin Pederson’s “High & Mighty,” as well as two traditional songs, “I Ride an Old Paint” and “Diamond Joe.” Wall keeps the locomotive pace of “Big Iron,” but eschews the original’s polish and backing harmonies, giving his voice new land to roam. Under his thumb, Jones’s “Cowpoke” sheds its upbeat tempo and technicolor flare. Wall’s voice works in tandem with the song’s harmonica and pedal steel to elevate the high lonesome yodel of the original into something scorched and reverent. Having showcased his distinctive voice in ways sparse and spare, he now fills out the room.","The Canadian country singer trades his solitary fare for a new set of stories, and a backing band that cuts in and out like a dance partner.

C’mon Les’ Go EP,AceMoLes Sins,by: Philip Sherburne,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f57d32f24167c1baabf7a8b/1:1/w_160/cmon%20les%20go%20ep_les%20sins%20acemo.jpg,2020-09-10 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/acemo-les-sins-cmon-les-go-ep/,Sonic Messengers,"For Chaz Bear and Adrian Mojica, rhythm is a bridge capable of spanning geography, styles, and even generations. Oakland’s Bear, an indie veteran and chillwave pioneer best known as Toro y Moi, has been making music since the mid ’00s; club aesthetics play a crucial role in his music (particularly in the dancefloor-oriented cuts of his alias Les Sins), but he has never been known as a club producer per se. New York’s Mojica, aka AceMo, came along roughly a decade later (in fact, the year of AceMo’s debut release, 2014, was also the year of Les Sins’ last recording until now); his raw, hardware-driven house, techno, and jungle productions throb with an upstart’s determination. Fun, spirited, and spontaneous, their debut EP together plays to their shared strengths. Where Bear’s music is often woozy and a little bit whimsical, Mojica’s productions typically favor overdriven sonics and hard-charging rhythms. But on these five tracks, they seek a middle path, wrapping quick-stepping drum programming in heady, ruminative tones. The opening track, “C’Mon Les’ Go,” is the deepest of the bunch, punctuating an aquamarine swirl of synths with bare-bones drum machine, mostly just rimshots and hi-hats, and whispered come-ons. But the smoothness of the groove is offset by bursts of boisterous energy, and a layer of sampled hoots and yelps rides roughshod over the top of it all. That sense of tension defines all the EP’s tracks. At its core, “Can’t Take It Anymore” is a psychedelic party cut that invites dancers to get lost in the play of textures like glassy synth tones and silvery electronic squiggles. Despite the innumerable little details at play, it doesn’t feel busy; it moves with a frictionless glide. But that sleekness is the foil for the artists’ nonstop stream of off-the-cuff vocals, the kind of energy-stoking rhymes a house-party DJ might shout through headphones plugged into the mixer’s mic jack (“Yo, I can’t take it anymore/Can you take me out on the floor”; “Dance, dance, dance, dance/Do the resistance”). “Holy Cow” slips between moments of barely controlled chaos and effortless cool, bouncing pitch-shifted variations of the titular phrase over a TR-909 groove splashed with staccato organ chords. With a bumptious, ’90s-inspired sense of swing, it marks the record’s most extroverted moment. (“Hello?” is essentially a remix of “Holy Cow,” doubling down on the gonzo elements and throwing extra ad-libbed vocals into the pot.) That playful spirit is a big part of the EP’s charm. Though the two musicians produced the bulk of the record remotely, they laid down its foundations when Mojica traveled to the Bay Area to DJ one of Bear’s Snap to Grid parties last fall, and all those whoops and hollers bear the unmistakable trace of real, in-person connection, of shared laughs in a shared space. The inaugural record on Mojica’s new Sonic Messengers label, a co-release with Bear’s own Company, the EP is a tribute to connections forged in dance music, as well as to the spontaneity that happens outside the actual club—a celebration of happy accidents and new creative directions. That might be why this bumping EP, split between heads-down energy and hands-up thrills, is tempered in places by a distinctly wistful air. The pandemic has been hell on dance music, and with C’mon Les’Go, it’s clear that Bear and Mojica can’t wait to get back out on the floor.","Chaz Bear (of Toro y Moi) teams up with New York club producer AceMo for a fun, spirited, spontaneous debut EP.

Muthaland,bbymutha,by: Dylan Green,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f5260201d29e200f244cafe/1:1/w_160/muthaland_bbymutha.jpg,2020-09-09 05:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/bbymutha-muthaland/,self-released,"bbymutha believes in the power of reclamation. Originally performing under the name Cindyy Kushh, the Chattanooga rapper has flipped her current name, usually a pejorative, into a term of endearment. “It’s not an insult to me,” she told The Fader in 2018. Women in rap—particularly Black women—face constant pressure to repress their sexuality, but bbymutha is having none of that. Her previous projects balance her outward sexual bravado with the public and private turmoil bubbling beneath the surface. On Muthaland, her debut (and apparently final) album, she expands her ideas to feature-length. The double album’s framing device involves skits depicting a game show, live “from the fiery depths of hell,” where a contestant named Bootyholeisha spends 24 hours with bbymutha. It’s a loose concept that telegraphs the levity sprinkled throughout the album. Opening song “Roaches Don’t Die” showcases her knack for balancing laughs with confessions. She’s dressing men down for trying too hard one minute (“Niggas tuck they tees/Tryna sell a fantasy/That buckle bigger than your dick, huh?”) and reliving memories of being jumped in her high-school gym the next. By its end, the song’s title becomes a battle cry; she’s clawed her way out of the pits. The hallmarks of bbymutha’s lyrics are fairly straightforward: kiss-offs to ain’t-shit dudes, flexing on other women, reflecting on trauma, and a plethora of sex talk. Her style borrows from the blueprint laid by fellow raunchy Tennessee rap titan Gangsta Boo, but bbymutha is no carbon copy. Her rhyme schemes are elastic, her thick Chattanooga drawl stretching rhymes like taffy across entire songs. The run of songs from ”Holographic” to “Cocaine Catwalk,” in particular, is deliriously entertaining, with bbymutha constantly topping her own braggadocio (“Rock a nigga’s semen like a ski mask” from “Either Way” is a personal favorite). Her unrestrained freedom is a tonic in a world where conservative pundit Ben Shapiro can go viral for asking his “doctor wife” about the scientific accuracy of Cardi B and Megan Thee Stallion’s “WAP.” The narrative focus allows her room to experiment with flows and music. Rock Floyd, who co-executive produced Muthaland alongside bbymutha, is responsible for more than half of the album’s beats. Some songs crunch menacingly (“Spooky Mutha Mansion,” “Cocaine Catwalk”) while others sail by on jagged house rhythms (“Nice Guy,” “Heavy Metal”), but all are united by a booming low end, affording bbymutha’s words considerable heft. The handful of songs produced by others, including Detroit sound masher Black Noi$e—who recently featured bbymutha on his electric new record OBLIVION—mesh nicely with Floyd and bbymutha’s vision. She sounds just as comfortable keeping pace with Yung Baby Tate over the metallic clangs of “Nice Guy” as she does singing over the plucky synths on “Dream Sequence.” Her versatility is even more impressive considering the album’s length. At 25 tracks—20 songs and five skits—there’s remarkably little fat on Muthaland. It’s the second album of the year, following Blu & Exile’s excellent comeback project Miles: From An Interlude Called Life, to justify such a loaded tracklist. Across Muthaland, bbymutha reclaims several words used to jab at her pride: “baby mama,” “slut,” “hoodrat.” She says them with her chest and siphons the negative energy in order to lift herself above the competition. It’s exhilarating, which makes the prospect of her early retirement all the sadder. Rap could use several more voices like hers. If Muthaland really is the last album bbymutha plans on releasing to the public, she’s brought us into her twisted world at its creative peak.","On her debut album, the Chattanooga rapper balances raunchy sex talk with reflections on trauma. It’s a deliriously entertaining, ambitious project from an artist operating at her peak.

Zeros,Declan McKenna,by: Peyton Thomas,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f3ff2b042e07aad86ac909a/1:1/w_160/zeros_declan%20mckenna.jpg,2020-09-09 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/declan-mckenna-zeros/,Tomplicated,"“What do you think about the rocket I built?” howls Declan McKenna on the first track of Zeros. It’s a cheeky nod at the gap between his uneven 2017 debut album, What Do You Think About the Car?, and this one: not a natural progression, but a staggering improvement. McKenna, a 21-year-old British singer-songwriter once hailed as a teen prodigy, has shed his boy-wonder baby fat. Zeros is an ambitious attempt at his own Tommy, a sprawling concept album about scrappy survivors spiraling through space and searching for meaning at the end of the world. Its characters war with one another across a musical palette that spans Sgt. Pepper to “Space Oddity.” The record’s standout track, “Daniel, You’re Still a Child,” is its Rosetta Stone—not to mention the best U2 song in about 15 years. The character of Daniel recurs throughout the album, but McKenna leaves his role ambiguous, a narrative Rorschach test. He seems to me a boozing absentee father, but he could also be a lousy boyfriend or a troublemaking prodigal son. The video for “The Key to Life on Earth” suggests a spookier storyline: Daniel as sinister doppelganger, played by actor Alex Lawther, invading McKenna’s home and eating his food before bludgeoning him to death. The video could easily double as an episode of Black Mirror; fans will recognize Lawther as the blackmailed sex criminal of Season 3’s “Shut Up and Dance.” But McKenna relegates science fiction to the album’s opening tracks. The elaborate musical nods to Bowie and the Beatles on “You Better Believe!!!” and “Be an Astronaut” place space exploration squarely in the 1960s, when it was still a democratic pursuit, not a hobby for union-busting billionaires. “You were born to be an astronaut,” McKenna sings of Daniel, “and you’ll do it or die trying.” Daniel settles, sadly, for the latter. The Space Age comes to an end. A chilly Bono-in-Berlin vibe sweeps through the album as Daniel degenerates, giving way to Blurry Britrock as modern forms of villainy—online radicalization (“Twice Your Size”), climate change (“Sagittarius A*”), surveillance capitalism (“Beautiful Faces”)—rear their ugly heads. This approach occasionally makes the album feel like a collage of 40 years’ worth of MOJO covers. But McKenna isn’t in the business of imitation or idolatry. He deploys these references carefully, in chronological order, drawing a clean arc through history to root his own political critique in the rich tradition of British protest rock. Take “Rapture,” where, with absolute confidence, he mispronounces “the laws of nature” to force a rhyme with “Mrs. Thatcher.” At first, it may seem a bit retrograde—a Margaret Thatcher takedown in 2020? But the song makes an elegant argument: The witch isn’t dead at all, but risen again; the stench of her corpse lingers in modern Britain. There is a straight line from the Sex Pistols’ grievances to McKenna’s own. McKenna’s strongest work, prior to Zeros, was the blunt FIFA protest anthem “Brazil,” written when he was just 15 and stunning in its maturity and moral clarity. Those qualities return in the defiant eco-feminist arc of Zeroes. He begins the album on a rocket in outer space, screaming, “We’re going to get ourselves killed!”, and ends on a “marvelous beach,” accepting the impermanence of life on Earth: “Everybody leaves eventually, darling.” By making peace with his own mortality, McKenna underscores the urgency of ensuring our planet outlives us. “Sagittarius A*” condemns industrialists for their delusions of escaping climate emergency by colonizing Mars: “You think your money’s gonna stop you getting wet? … Noah, you best start building.” There is a subtly Luddite bent to the political demands of Zeros, which are threefold: Disconnect your phone, burn your money, and commence your walk eastward into the rising sun. With Zeros, McKenna expands his conceptual scope and introduces more shades of grey in his storytelling. Not all of his creative risks pay off, though. The best concept albums carefully offset their arena-rock assaults with moments for the mosh pit to catch its breath. Zeros would benefit from another down-tempo “Emily” or two, as well as more connective tissue and clarity in its narrative. But despite the wobbly sequencing and foggy structure, the album is a bright flare from a promising talent. McKenna doesn’t simply pay homage to his musical heroes; he jerry-rigs the history of British rock to ask how we got ourselves into this mess, and how the hell we might get out.

Before the pandemic shuttered nightclubs around the world, the Austrian-born DJ, producer, and visual artist was living a nomadic lifestyle with her partner and collaborator Sinjin Hawke, with whom she runs the audiovisual platform and label Fractal Fantasy. Like many touring electronic musicians, Jones writes tracks on her laptop while out on the road, taking advantage of downtime in between parties. Unlike many of her peers, however, Jones is notoriously strict about quality control. After first beginning to produce in 2010, she set herself the task of creating 100 original tracks before ever releasing one. This led to her debut EP, 100 Ladies, in 2015; five years (and a smattering of collaborative releases) later, those 100 ladies have evolved into Ten Billion Angels. Ten Billion Angels builds on themes that Jones has been meticulously sculpting throughout those years—in particular, the combination of human emotion with futuristic, sci-fi stylings. This cyborg tenderness is reflected not only in pitch-shifted melodies and gut-punch kick drums but also in the LP’s accompanying artwork, which was inspired by CGI tentacle porn. Jones claims she was first drawn to 3D tentacle erotica because of “how obsessive the creators were”—perhaps she saw reflected in them a kind of perfectionism that she also applies to her music. But in addition to its intricate detail, the artwork mirrors the music in other ways: its glossy surfaces, its fluidity, and its seamless combination of the primal and the otherworldly. Jones’ own voice forms the backbone of the record, spliced and contorted in a way she notes was inspired by AraabMuzik’s 2011 opus Electronic Dream. Jones is a master of wringing ten billion inflections out of a single sound (notably on her recent bootleg of Selena Gomez’ “Look at Her Now,” which amplifies the heartache of the original while erasing almost every lyric other than the word “down”). On lead single “Paranoid,” Jones repeats the titular refrain—“Paranoid, think I’m paranoid”—inside synth flourishes and tightly coiled drums that circle her like vultures, while on the vast “Sister’s Blade,” a single line of melody is repeated over and over, starting out as defiant and silky over scattergun synths before sinking slowly into a lower, more elegiac register. That emotional double entendre is the strength of this LP, where numerous synonyms for “woman” pepper the tracklist: A “sister” on one track becomes a “bitch” on another and a “princess” on the next. While “Sister’s Blade” teeters ambiguously between aggressive and mournful, “Revenge of the Bitch” is Jones’ most explicit do-not-fuck-with-me moment, all sparse and serious drums. Elsewhere, the fearsome “Low Orbit Ion Cannon”—named for a kind of cyber attack—draws most explicitly on Jones’ love of footwork (she learned from the late, great DJ Rashad and has collaborated with Gary, Ind., experimentalist Jlin), building into a stream of controlled chaos at 160 beats per minute. While these powerful outbursts are the most high-adrenaline moments, they’re in the minority on this record. Some tracks feel like alien ballads: “Come Home,” the Björk-adjacent closer, is a spectral chorus of voices, and “I Wanna Lose You” twists a would-be R&B hook into a ghostly smokescreen of SFX. Some of these sleepier compositions, particularly towards the end of the record, lose their impact, but others are so richly embodied that they feel like pop hits from a parallel universe. “Melancholy Princess” is a kind of duet between Jones and a bassline, her voice tremulous and sweet as she croons, “I want to feel you,” over the muscular instrumental. There’s a power play between her pitched-up vocal and the brutality of the track, just as there is within the bait-and-switch lyrics (“I’ll make you mine/ Have your way with me”) and even on the cover, where it’s hard to tell whether the female form is dominating or being dominated by the shapeshifting metallic liquid engulfing her. A similar dynamic echoes across the whole LP, as delicate melodies wrestle against chaotic production. The beauty of Ten Billion Angels lies in its embrace of liminality and refusal to conform to one idea. This double sidedness fits into the broader context of Jones and Hawke’s self-described “post-genre” work together under the Fractal Fantasy banner, where dystopias can be utopian and club music can exist and expand far beyond the physical club. They recently debuted Virtua, their virtual reimagining of a club space which you can “tour” online. It’s an immersive, empty space with 3D projections beaming from every wall, built with no bar, the better to “foster potent communal experiences.” Walking virtually through it feels poignant, as the rooms seem to wait for the sweaty, messy reality of a dancing crowd. There’s both a sadness and a hopefulness in its vacancy. In Virtua as in Ten Billion Angels, even the darkest moment contains the potential for optimism—and there are endless new possibilities dancing on every elaborate, lovingly crafted surface.","Channeling an eerily affecting cyborg tenderness, the Austrian producer and digital nomad writes post-club anthems that sound like pop hits from a parallel universe.

Renaissance,Aluna,by: Katherine St. Asaph,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f4e5a5313228581eaf280e8/1:1/w_160/Renaissance_aluna.jpg,2020-09-09 05:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/aluna-renaissance/,Mad Decent,"AlunaGeorge, the British duo of vocalist Aluna Francis and producer George Reid, never quite got massive, but they did get everywhere. British audiences may know the group best from “White Noise”—Disclosure’s biggest UK hit. Others might remember the glitchy Timbaland homages on 2013’s Body Music, an early revival of now-ubiquitous Y2K pop. If all this genre-shifting made AlunaGeorge a little amorphous as a group, it did mean they got plenty of work. “You could give us one week and we’d do 10 songs,” Francis told Vulture. “Any genre—we’ll just knock them out.” Between the knockouts, though, brewed increasing frustration with the dance music industry, coming to a head with a bracing manifesto on Francis’s Instagram. Sometimes there’s blatant exploitation; last year, Francis accused a producer outside the group of sexual assault. But it’s often subtler. Dance producers, disproportionately men, often become mega-paid stars, while dance singer-songwriters, disproportionately women, get second billing—or none, made into modern-day Martha Washes. Wash, of course, is Black, and that dynamic also persists: The most successful dance stars tend to be white, with Black artists showing up in interpolations, uncredited samples, pastiches, or plagiarism, but less often in person or pay. Francis knows it well; though many AlunaGeorge features were basically solo Aluna features, and though Reid was often offstage at AlunaGeorge sets, for years she hesitated to go officially solo. “I knew that, as a Black woman alone, I was going to get chewed up,” she said. On Renaissance, Francis aims to disprove that. The album showcases her curatorial skills—honed from years of DJ sets, streaming playlists, and recently virtual shows as Aluna’s Room—and her range. Maybe as a challenge, Renaissance neither starts nor ends with dance music. The opener, “I’ve Been Starting to Love All the Things I Hate,” is less a product of the club queue than the away message; slow jam “Whistle” unspools a drowsy vocal and sumptuous synth-violin solo. In between is proper dance in many forms: pop-house, dancehall, funk, Caribbean and African dance, and only occasionally R&B, in TLC homage “Sneak.” She’s an excellent curator of features, too: On Mr. Vegas-interpolating “Get Paid,” Aluna cedes the floor to rapper Princess Nokia and Jamaican songwriter Jada Kingdom in assured form, and “The Recipe” pairs Aluna’s ability to channel earnestness with a small fluting note with Kaytranada’s ability to wring wistfulness out of a small chord change. Francis describes Aluna’s Room as “an introvert’s palace of escape,” and likewise, Renaissance was written for the inner headspace as much as the dancefloor—convenient in a year where those are empty. “Don’t Hit My Line” hammers exes back into the woodwork to a four-to-the-floor beat, but complicates itself: percussion interludes and Francis’s staccato vocal turn the beat polyrhythmic, and the melody leans hard into “I think of you,” like a “New Rules” by someone not totally ready to let go of the old. And lead single “Body Pump,” written with Josh Lloyd-Watson of Jungle, is built like a house-diva showcase, from the torchy first verse to the drop to the triumphant close. But there’s a scrappiness to it, in the froth of handclaps on the bridge—a studio accident, left in—and the way Aluna pushes her voice into the red, frayed and vulnerable. It’s decidedly human, just the thing to play in a “palace of escape”—or at least in one of its many vibrant rooms. Catch up every Saturday with 10 of our best-reviewed albums of the week.

Hannah,Lomelda,by: Will Gottsegen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f52486313228581eaf2817b/1:1/w_160/hannah_lomelda.jpg,2020-09-08 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/lomelda-hannah/,Double Double Whammy,"Just over halfway through Hannah, the stunning, open-hearted new album from Lomelda, there’s a crucial moment of affirmation. Nothing is working—singer-songwriter Hannah Read’s body refuses to cooperate; her hands aren’t opening, her limbs are weakening.  A security guard finds her splayed out on all fours. Singing about the moment over somber piano, Read’s voice cracks: “She asked me what’s your name/Are you ok?” The magic of Lomelda’s music is in that exchange, an infusion of strength and care from one person to another, no matter how small or ordinary. It has anchored Read’s songwriting from the beginning, and it is threaded throughout Hannah, which is warm and enveloping, like a hug. More than ever, Read’s writing grapples with identity—how we see ourselves, how we’re seen—and the songs on Hannah render personal crises with a deft and delicate touch. “So confused who I have been, who I haven’t” sings Read on “Reach,” before looking outward: “How’d you know?” She’s never alone, even at her most desperately isolated; friends are always orbiting, in person and in memory, and they always seem to know best. The wistful and meticulous “Hannah Happiest” reflects a similar uncertainty. “Asked you if you knew/Who/I was,” Read admits. “You said Hannah.” These aren’t just casual observations. The album oscillates between emotional registers, balancing profound quiet with strummy, emphatic pleas about how we might better comport ourselves in the world; there’s a sense that even at their most gentle, these songs are transmitting something deeply earnest and hard-won. This is as true of Read’s lyrics as of her arrangements, which are newly rich and rewarding. The noisy riffs of “Wonder” channel Alex G at his scrappiest, while “It’s Infinite” conjures a meditative sensibility with plush, finger-picked guitar. “Give it your all,” Read sings on the former track, nearly hollering, as if willing herself to take her own advice. On the latter, wrangling the family dog becomes a poignant metaphor for Read’s own dream-chasing. Though they’re stylistically distinct, the songs share a commitment to perseverance as a guiding ethos; they’re about resolving to press on, in spite of it all. Together, they suggest that the work of self-discovery is bound up in connection. It makes sense, then, that the saddest moments on Hannah have to do with disconnection, and the breakdown of communication—half-heard conversations (“Hannah Happiest”), a reckoning with a painful memory (“Polyurethane”), the drop to all fours (“Stranger Sat By Me”). “Hannah Sun” is quintessential late-summer music, a travelogue steeped in regret: “Glad you held her/Glad you held him/Glad you held me, too/Though I didn’t know how to/Be closer to you.” She wavers before building herself back up, but she gets there: “Shadowed by a blue/Am I shining? / I am trying to shine.” It’s an image that captures how feelings can intensify even as they lose shape, leaving a lingering ”blue” in place of something more specific; even in sadness, Read finds a glow. Read’s music has come to be associated with Silsbee, Texas, where she grew up, and Hannah was recorded in the studio her brother built there. But she’s been based in Los Angeles for the past few years (she cites the sunshine as a major factor in her decision to relocate), and it’s lent the music a more universal feel. The long drives of 2017’s Thx are less prominent here, but Read is still engaged in a kind of mapmaking, charting more explicitly psychological territory. The result is a cosmic “I’ve got you,” a link between worlds, bridging the individual and the communal. By the end, you’ll start to wonder about that distinction—where the boundary lies, or whether it’s there at all.","The stunning, open-hearted new album from indie rock singer-songwriter Hannah Read renders personal crises with a deft and delicate touch.

Solo / Solo II,Michael Rother,by: Dave Segal,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f524cffeef58307be966835/1:1/w_160/Michael%20Rother%20SOlo.jpg,2020-09-08 05:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/michael-rother-solo-solo-ii/,Groenland,"Before he’d turned 25, Michael Rother had played in three innovative groups—Kraftwerk, Neu!, and Harmonia. The guitarist became an avatar of what’s become known as krautrock, inspiring bands as disparate as Stereolab, Chrome, and Negativland with sounds ranging from beatific pastoralism to industrial clangor. Rother’s solo recordings from 1977 onward, which are enshrined in the Solo and Solo II boxed sets, haven’t been as world-shaking as those earlier forays into avant rock, but they reveal his ability to wring maximal emotion from minimal gestures in ways that seem quintessentially Northern European. It’s fair to say that Rother discharged most of his best ideas with Neu! and Harmonia. In “Hallogallo,” the lead-off track from Neu!’s 1972 debut album, Rother and drummer Klaus Dinger drafted perhaps the most emulated krautrock blueprint: Dinger’s “Apache beat” chugging swiftly beneath Rother’s plaintive guitar wails and Dinger’s curt rhythm-guitar quacks, all contoured by producer Conny Plank for optimal aerodynamic glide. This was ultimate driving musik for the Autobahn of your imagination. You can hear the seeds of much of what’s collected on Solo in Neu! 75’s “Isi.” Its melody suggests grand vistas and tempered hope, its beats advancing with purposeful propulsion. But when an artist has dreamed up ideas as significant as those, falling short of them is no disgrace. On Solo’s collected recordings—Flammende Herzen, Sterntaler, Katzenmusik, Fernwärme, two previously unreleased soundtracks (Die Räuber and Houston), and a smattering of live recordings and remixes from the 21st century—Rother hones his trademark riff mesmerism, emphasizing beauty and placidity. Flammende Herzen (1977)—featuring Can’s Jaki Liebezeit on drums and Plank on the console and Yamaha synth—reiterates Rother’s predilection for expansive song structures, cruise-control rhythms, and guitar tones that signify anguish and ecstasy. “Zyklodrom” and “Karussell” are exemplary; the latter’s melody is perhaps Rother’s most grandiose. No wonder it’s been covered by William Tyler, another master of big-sky guitarscapes. Another key track, “Feuerland,” was redone by Kompakt Records’ Justus Köhncke; you can hear the roots of ’90s German techno’s streamlined efficiency in the original’s purring sonorities and clipped 4/4 gait. Sterntaler (1978), with Liebezeit and Plank again in tow, follows in the vein of Flammende Herzen. “Stromlinien” exemplifies Rother’s m.o. during this phase: majestic melodiousness propelled by fleet, locomotive beats. It becomes clearer on Sterntaler that Rother—as he’d shown in Harmonia, where his parts smoothly blended with Dieter Moebius and Hans-Joachim Roedelius’ synths—may be one of the least extravagant guitar heroes in rock, favoring artfully modulated squalls and muted spangles that exude modesty, even as they’re blanketing the firmament. A 12-song love letter to felines, 1979’s Katzenmusik purveys a more interior sound, with faintly precious melodies and less emphasis on rhythm, although Liebezeit remains. Rother introduces eBow to his repertoire, which enables him to generate infinite sustain and evoke cat-like cries. Rother’s own cats recently had given birth to more kittens than he could handle, forcing him to give them away; any downhearted moments on the album might be traced to that feeling of loss. With Plank gone, Rother takes a slightly darker tone on 1982’s Fernwärme (the title means “warmth from a distance”). “Elfenbein,” written after the death of his uncle, detours into a mournful, gothic meditation that verges upon Bohren & der Club of Gore territory. Liebezeit’s ever steady beats undergird the guitarist’s pleasantly undulating peregrinations, the legends working with nonchalant precision. Fernwärme also contains Jim O’Rourke’s favorite Rother song, “Klangkörper,” which bears hints of the minimal, gaseous techno for which many Germans would become revered nearly two decades later. Rother’s evocative instrumentals enabled him to make a natural transition to film scoring, as 2013’s The Robbers and 2012’s Houston prove. From the former, “Part 1” is an ideal specimen of panicky, vehicle-chase soundtracking. When not in quicksilver-propulsion mode, Robbers settles into an ice-blue orb of beautiful tentativeness, as exemplified by “Part 4.” The zenith of Houston occurs on “Part 5”; over a foundation of emotive static, Rother unleashes Doppler-effected guitar sighs, conjuring a sense of hope receding toward the vanishing point. One of the principal through lines of Solo is Rother’s ability to express overwhelming emotions with as few gestures as possible, and “Part 5” captures it beautifully, with a mesmerizing repetition of rigorously honed motifs. Solo II collects Rother’s output from 1983’s Lust to 2020’s Dreaming, with additional bonus tracks from the ’90s. He mostly goes the one-man-band route, and the presence of his guitar gradually diminishes. This material bears only the faintest traces of Rother’s peak-’70s sound, which leads to a dilemma. On the one hand, we admire artists who avoid repeating themselves. On the other, we wish musicians wouldn’t abandon the qualities that endeared us to their work in the first place. But the main problem with Solo II? His ideas aren’t as galvanizing within this 37-year stretch. On Lust the dominance of the Fairlight CMI synth lends the songs a candied timbre. Couple that with melodies redolent of movie-of-the-week schmaltz, and the result hews closer to OMD at their cutest than to the paradigm-shifting rock and electronic music that marked Neu! and Harmonia. “Palmengarten” epitomizes this approach with its meringue-light synth and pastel, pointillistic guitar pirouetting over pitter-pat drums. Lust’s anomalous standout is “Pulsar,” a polar meditation reminiscent of Michael Hoenig’s 1977 album Departure From the Northern Wasteland. The pensive guitar intro to “Süssherz,” Süssherz und Tiefenschärfe’s opener, may make it hard to believe that this is the same musician who scorched earth with “Negativland.” Here, Rother is more interested in tugging your heartstrings than in blowing your mind. Thankfully, things improve with “Tiefenschärfe,” whose glittering keyboard fantasia foreshadows Spiritualized’s organ-drone symphonies, before shifting into a motorik rhythm that implies purposeful glide to an important rendezvous. Think of “Tiefenschärfe” as an update of Kraftwerk’s “Autobahn.” At 13 minutes, it’s one of the grandest works in Rother’s ’80s canon. “Blaues Licht” ends the album with a frosty tone poem of exquisite poignancy—like Brian Eno’s Apollo at the North Pole. The title of Traumreisen translates as “dream trips”; if only these weren’t such tepid journeys. While “Reiselust” barges in with the aggressive, thunky beats of a new-wave club hit, the tune bears a tinny urgency. Rother’s guitar tone has lost its edge, dissolving into anodyne sheen and modest prettiness, with outsized demonstrations of melodrama marring several tracks. Redemption comes on “Schwarze Augen,” a percolating, Tangerine Dream-esque efflorescence of majestic synth swells, and the heroic, Neu!-like rock of “Lucky Stars.” On 1996’s Esperanza, Rother abandons rock and lights out for various strains of middlebrow electronic music, and enlists a vocalist for the first time. He also calls on Joachim Rudolph to program ProTools and DD-1000 computer software, making this the most digital-sounding record in Rother’s discography. On “Silver Sands,” a forlorn panpipe melody and prim boom-bap lifted from the trip-hop playbook alert you to his new paradigm. At 17 tracks, Esperanza could have benefited from editing, but Rother does generate some engrossing ideas. “Weil Schnee Und Eis” (which features vocals and lyrics by Jens Harke) proffers sluggish trip-hop that could almost be mistaken for a release by WordSound artist Spectre, its low end far dirtier than typical for Rother, who’s notoriously averse to bass frequencies. The gently psychedelic “Wolkenwelt” is odd enough to segue into an ambient-dub excursion by the Orb and proves that Rother may have had an ear cocked toward the outdoor-rave circuit. Esperanza’s peak cosmic effort, “Gleitflug,” is as hypnotic as Harald Grosskopf’s best material. If Esperanza proved that Rother could adeptly adapt to the zeitgeist, for 2004’s Remember (The Great Adventure) he relied more heavily on singers, outside producers (including Asmus Tietchens and Jake Mandell), danceable rhythms, and conventional song structures. The chant-intensive “Energy It Up (Part 1)”—featuring Herbert Grönemeyer’s vocals and easy-going beats by Mouse on Mars’ Andi Toma—resembles the Beta Band. Perhaps even more surprising are the songs that recall the Wire offshoot A.C. Marias: “Sweet Sweat,” with singer Sophie Joiner adding a frosty swirl of sensuality, and the slow-burning churner “Energy It Up (Part 2),” which is cross-hatched with strange FX. But the maudlin, widescreen ballad “Morning After (Loneliness),” the humdrum electronic brooder “Nostalgia,” and the stodgily depressing “Remember” are so ill considered, they almost negate the album’s highlights. This year’s Dreaming continues Rother’s drift away from rock and toward song-based electronic music. Rather than boldly deviating from previous works, he instead nudges the music’s minimalist elements into slightly altered forms. So although “Bitter Tang” echoes the slow-motion disco of Lindstrøm, a first for Rother, it retains his plangent guitar tone and those trademark wistful chord progressions that suggest awe of natural beauty. Dreaming is at its worst when it slips into the saccharine sentimentality of“Fierce Wind Blowing,” “Gravitas,” and “Quiet Dancing.” More often, though, Rother seems suited for his role as an elder hero transitioning into a late-career metamorphosis. The soaring minimalist techno of “Wopp Wopp” isn’t a million kilometers from Kraftwerk’s late-period work, with its synthesized vocals blurring into a serene drone over the sproingy metallic percolations. At once majestic and dulcet, the dub funk of “Hey Hey” splits the difference between the Orb and Enya. Recorded from 1988 to 1994, Bonustracks yields a few extraordinary cuts from Rother’s hiatus between 1987’s Traumreisen and 1996’s Esperanza, but the majority of the collection traffics in Weather Channel tapestries. Typical is “The Doppelgänger,” a pellucid, mellow guitar study with faint echoes of his pastoral Neu! magic augmented by wispy choral drones and the occasional cymbal crescendo. “Silencio,” a majestic meander of ambivalent beauty, represents Rother’s default mode of this era: a wan resignation that nonetheless contains depth and breadth. But it’s “Unterwasserwolken” that reminds us of Rother’s forte: forging aquatic ambience pregnant with pathos through long delays on his guitar, and then shifting into a smooth motorik jam with the élan of a bicyclist leaning into a downhill swerve. These two boxed sets prove that Rother’s music has changed subtly and at his own pace, sporadically capturing the thrill of his peak feats in Neu! and Harmonia. They also reveal that Rother’s talents flourish best in group settings.

12th House Rock,Narrow Head,by: Arielle Gordon,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f5249de35497cffe4a32d29/1:1/w_160/12th%20house%20rock_narrow%20head.jpg,2020-09-08 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/narrow-head-12th-house-rock/,Run for Cover,"They may only have a debut under their belt, but the sepia-toned sludge rockers in Narrow Head have perfected the disaffected pull quote. “I don’t even think I like shoegaze,” frontman Jacob Duarte told the Dallas Observer in July. “I need aggressiveness.” As any passing observer of the grunge genre wars knows, the surest way to pin a label to your band is to vehemently deny affiliation. But even without the half-hearted attempts to reject categorization, the Houston group is practically built from ’90s pastiche—it’s in the bleached hair, the Smashing Pumpkins T-shirts, the passing references to Hum. At first blush, it can seem like Narrow Head are providing a paint-by-numbers guide to their references for the uninitiated; your appreciation of their music will likely correlate with your tolerance for faux film grain and song titles like “Emmadazey.” But the band’s Run for Cover debut, 12th House Rock, manages to surpass the trappings of a Chapterhouse cover record, cobbling impressive hooks and earnest earworms out of Creation Records nostalgia. Narrow Head manifests the listless ennui of those bygone Brits in a different tenor; where Ride and Slowdive reached for glassy delay and shimmering cymbal hits, guitarist William Menjivar traffics in dense, scorched-earth reverb. The title track opens with a chord progression so heavily processed that it becomes almost indistinguishable from the wailing feedback; “Hard to Swallow” matches that pugnacity with blunt blasts from drummer Carson Wilcox. The screeching, echoing amplifier gain exudes a thick layer of grime that lingers throughout the record, forming a pointed introduction to the slow-burning rhythms of “Crankcase” and a cleanse between the circuitous hypnotism of “Yer’ Song” and the twinkling counter-melodies of “Ponderosa Sun Club.” More than anything, the sounds of plugging in and warming up are an anti-status symbol, a gesture to the band’s slouching nihilism. Despite the album’s brighter moments, like the triumphant guitar solos that open “Stuttering Stanley,” a pervasive darkness seeps through. Then there’s Duarte’s voice, a wispy whine that bends and molds to the record’s variously downtrodden moods, revealing a surprising range. His opening words on the bridge of “Yer’ Song” are stretched and slowed to a leaden pace, as if tracked underwater. But elsewhere, as on the meandering “Nodding Off” and the comparatively sparse “Wastrel,” his voice can take on an unexpectedly romantic tenor, reaching for gentle, whispered falsettos. Despite the band’s best efforts to affect a sense of disinterested malaise, his default mode—a pitched, nasally resonance—betrays a forthright and vulnerable emotional core. Carried by Duarte’s moody, elongated vowels, tossed-off lyrical cynicism is reinvigorated. It’s one thing to shrug off the meaningless of everyday existence and adopt an outcast mentality; Narrow Head lean into that pessimism with purpose. “Wake me up when you leave,” he sings flatly on “Hard to Swallow,” a line that might otherwise come across as huffy teenage exasperation if not matched with the anxious, shredded screams of its bridge, which imply a despair deeper than passing tedium. Behind the overt shoegaze and grunge revivalism of 12th House Rock, Narrow Head find a balance of form and function. For every predictably dense riff over lyrics about getting high, there’s a carefully constructed guitar melody, a particularly sensitive vocal delivery, a bright and buoyant bassline. “Evangeline Dream,” the album’s gently warbling closer, exemplifies these reinventions on a classic form. Written about Duarte’s late sister, the song builds layers of guitar noodling and muted drums, its progressions resolving naturally in a minor key evocative of Chris Bell’s melancholic melodies. Duarte’s breathy croon reflects his lyrical fantasies—“Evangeline, she’s a dream/I’m always dreaming so she’s never alone,” he sings, his voice winsome and starry-eyed. It’s a heartfelt moment of earnestness that puts the preceding disillusionment in stark relief. Peeling back the surface-level nostalgia, 12th House Rock, captures a wistfulness that surpasses mere mimicry. Catch up every Saturday with 10 of our best-reviewed albums of the week.

Awake in the Brain Chamber,Secret Machines,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f4e6f6dd6662479de2d7b18/1:1/w_160/awake%20in%20the%20brain%20chamber_secret%20machines.jpg,2020-09-08 05:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/secret-machines-awake-in-the-brain-chamber/,TSM,"Secret Machines began their 2004 debut Now Here is Nowhere with six seconds of silence,  and when the kick drum hit, years of buzz became reality: a Next Big Thing band unafraid of all the Led Zeppelin and Pink Floyd Laser Spectacular comparisons winging their way. 16 years later, Awake in the Brain Chamber begins much in a similar way, albeit only similar enough to bring the difference between 2004 and 2020 into sharp relief. “First Wave Intact” boomed like “When the Levee Breaks” out of the Darrell K. Royal jumbotron, and Awake in the Brain Chamber’s opening moments thud like two kids smacking a tetherball in a deserted schoolyard—a sound that absorbed every deflating circumstance of the past decade-plus, which were marked by artistic stalemates, fading commercial fortunes, and unthinkable tragedy. But if “3,4,5 Let’s Stay Alive” is the opposite of a Big Comeback from a former Big Thing, that’s kind of the entire point—Secret Machines just sound relieved that Awake in the Brain Chamber actually exists. It’s a wise management of expectations for a version of Secret Machines that’s downsized in all ways. Original guitarist Benjamin Curtis died of lymphoma in 2013 at the age of 35, and his imprint is still noticeable on the remaining duo of brother Brandon and drummer Josh Garza; his electro-pop project School of Seven Bells is referenced in “3,4,5 Let’s Stay Alive.” Awake in the Brain Chamber clocks in at just a bit over a half hour, sucking out the dry ice and fog that filled the air as past songs stretched out past five minutes. What remains is an album built in the image of “Nowhere Again” or “Lightning Blue Eyes,” propulsive, streamlined, and feasibly pop—the kind of songs that once put Secret Machines alongside Arcade Fire as David Bowie’s favorite rock bands of 2004, or at least ones that pointed towards a brighter future at that moment than U2. If the concept of “krautrock, but with choruses” is no longer novel in 2020, it’s at least fresh on Awake in the Brain Chamber—even as their vision of planetarium-ready rock receded almost entirely from the public imagination, Now Here is Nowhere maintained its cult appeal in large part because there really hasn’t been anything remotely like it since. Though Secret Machines don’t have the same sense of scope or scale today, the economized production and sleek song structures become an unexpected asset. Awake in the Brain Chamber shifts towards a more stately, synth-heavy sound. The sweeping and silvery “Talos’ Corpse” and “Angel Come” reimagine Secret Machines as logical forerunners and peers of British “The Big Music” revivalists like Foals or the Horrors, studio nerds who developed into a reliable late-afternoon festival act, rather than a band at the top of the American Landfill Indie heap, as their Spotify’s “Fans Also Like” page suggests. But Awake in the Brain Chamber has the modest charm of fan service, intended for an audience that’s actively rooting for Secret Machines to succeed. The back story is indispensable to project a sense of stakes onto a record that takes the straightest path in cruising to the finish line, never once swerving or stepping on the gas. While certainly the tightest Secret Machines LP, much like Brandon Curtis’ side gig Interpol, the band’s power is directly proportional to an unshakeable belief in its inherent profundity. As longtime fans know, Awake in the Brain Chamber stands in the place of an even more troubled predecessor: The Moth, The Lizard and the Secret Machines was completed in 2010 and scrapped at the mixing stage, deemed “too depressing.” The duo plans to release it at some point, and hopefully it does come to light, if only to reveal what “depressing Secret Machines” might actually sound like. They’ve never been particularly forthcoming with their emotions, with Ten Silver Drops standout “Alone, Jealous and Stoned” standing as the rule-proving exception. Awake in the Brain Chamber is best when Curtis is at his most vulnerable—giving himself a pep talk in the call-and-response chorus of “Everything Starts,” muttering “I want to give up” all too believably throughout the chorus of “Talos’ Corpse,” before amending himself—“I want to give up, but don’t.” They sound like they have much more to give.

Diva,Ivy Queen,by: Isabelia Herrera,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f5294a7da5fc908914ac575/1:1/w_160/diva_ivy_queen.jpg,2020-09-06 05:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/ivy-queen-diva/,Real Music,"Long before she’d earned the honorifics of La Diva, La Caballota, or La Potra, Puerto Rican rapper Ivy Queen was a pigtailed newcomer whose panties rose above her baggy pants. This was Martha Ivelisse Pesante Rodríguez’s look when she infamously auditioned for The Noise, the Puerto Rican collective and nightclub that became pivotal to the evolution of reggaetón in the ’90s. Back then, Ivy Queen was a shy girl from around the way, a young emcee and songwriter from the small town of Añasco eager to cut her teeth in an emerging movement. She’d arrived at the home of now-legendary DJ Negro, ready to drop a verse for some buzzy rappers (and soon-to-be pioneers) who had assembled that day. She was so overwhelmed by nerves that she grabbed the mic and turned her back to DJ Negro during the performance. “Muchos Quieren Tumbarme,” a vicious and self-assured proclamation of femme autonomy, flowed out of her, securing her spot in the crew. Ivy Queen’s audition was a bellwether for the gender expectations she would navigate—and challenge—throughout her career: the fine lines between assertiveness and confrontation, confidence and arrogance, weakness and vulnerability. In an industry often driven by the objectification of women and the reinforcement of male control over our pleasure, Ivy Queen was tasked with destabilizing the dominance of male desire in reggaetón, while also pushing against monolithic critiques of the genre as inherently misogynistic. She was responsible for making space for all those who are marginalized in the movement—a role too often demanded of women in music, and even more so when they are heralded as the queen, the sole figure carrying the weight of liberation for others. And as deferential as it is, the title “Queen of Reggaetón,” as she’s commonly referred to, isn’t enough to capture all of Ivy’s complexities, to reveal everything she has to offer us. No project embodies this better than Diva, Ivy Queen’s third studio album. Ivy Queen teamed with independent label Real Music in 2003 for the release; in 2004, the project was licensed and distributed as Diva: Platinum Edition under Universal Music, now with a handful of bonus tracks and remixes. The album is a snapshot of reggaetón in a crucial moment of transition; the genre was in the midst of commercial ascent and sonic transformation for the masses, and although others like La Sista and Glory made their mark, Ivy Queen remained the most visible woman in a boys’ club. With its deep dancehall and reggae en español influences, along with its themes of revenge, sexual freedom, and the politics of the dancefloor, Diva evinced the elasticity of reggaetón—its intrinsic capacity to soundtrack the carnal and the political. Ivy Queen’s arrival did not come without obstacles. Pesante Rodríguez attended high school in New York, but dropped out in the late ’80s and eventually moved to Puerto Rico. She fell in love with hip-hop en español while watching Vico C on television, mesmerized by his ability to blend incisive raps with sticky dancehall riddims. But she was equally enamored of the salsas and boleros of powerhouse vocalists like Celia Cruz and La Lupe; she started writing her own music after watching the former during a 1974 Fania All-Stars concert on TV. After a stint in The Noise, Ivy Queen went solo, releasing her first two albums, En Mi Imperio and The Original Rude Girl in 1997 and 1998, respectively. Sony Music signed her for the latter album, which featured a highly publicized collaboration with Wyclef Jean, an early sign of the commercial maneuvers reggaetón would embrace in the new millennium. The Original Rude Girl unfortunately never reached its anticipated commercial heights, and Ivy Queen was dropped from Sony. La Caballota issued singles on compilation albums and mixtapes like The Majestic and Kilates, before releasing Diva on the independent Miami-based label Real Music Group in 2003. At the time Diva was released, Ivy Queen was as reverent of her roots as she was focused on imagining an artistic future for reggaetón. The album firmly honors Ivy’s love of lyricism and movement, but it also tells stories of sexual liberation for and by women. The year before Diva’s release, sexual and racial anxieties about reggaetón exploded in Puerto Rico. Senator Velda González launched an “Anti-Pornography Campaign” calling for the removal of all “pornographic” material from reggaetón music videos and lyrics, which she claimed degraded women, were vulgar and sexually indecent, and presented an affront to family values (read: white, middle-class norms). The campaign reflected deep-seated racist fears about hypersexuality and respectability in Caribbean music. Of course, there are plenty of examples of women’s bodies being exploited in reggaetón. But predictably, much of the discourse was facile, failing to make sense of the ways the entertainment industry commodifies women, only to later punish them for expressing their own sexuality. Diva disrupted many of these simplistic narratives. Rather than relegating women to spaces of spectatorship or sexual service, the album explores the freedom of independence, the euphoria of dance, and the satisfaction of revenge. It allows us to enjoy a perreo sucio and remind men that we can be the masters of our own desire. Ivy Queen discards any sense of genre determinism, and instead creates moments of joy and authority—even if they remain within the boundaries of fantasy and commerce. Diva begins with Ivy Queen laying it all on the floor. Using the language of a boxing match, she recounts her years of rap battles in The Noise, the obstacles she has faced, and the poet and prophet she’s become in spite of an uneven playing field. Many of the tracks signal Ivy’s profound love of dancehall, rap en español, and her eminence in the movement before it was dubbed reggaetón. “Papi Te Quiero” employs the “Buy Out” riddim made most famous by Notch’s “Nuttin’ Nuh Go So,” while “Money Making” enlists legendary Panamanian rapper Japanese, who lends his deep baritone and old-school flow to the production alongside a verse from Ivy’s now ex-husband Gran Omar. Meanwhile, “Sangre” and “Tú No Puedes” are reminders that Ivy Queen is first and foremost a rapper; both revel in hypnotic, early ’00s bombast, and you can almost feel Ivy Queen’s ornate, acrylic talons gripping the mic as she smugly announces her arrival: “Llegó la perra” (“The bitch has arrived”). But it’s when the album heads to the dancefloor that Diva excels; this is where La Potra most convincingly asserts her power, where she invites us to lay siege to hypermasculine posturing, to revel in sex and refuse the conquest of our bodies. With its playground handclaps and blazoning horns, “Alerta” is at once an affirmation of tenacity and an explosive warning for any and all men intent on interrupting your grinding. “Quiero Saber,” which appeared on the platinum edition of Diva, is an invitation to a dancefloor entanglement with plinking synth stabs that sound like they were lifted straight out of a 2003 FruityLoops drum kit. You can practically feel the humidity in the basement perreo air with the song’s “bellaqueo tra-tra-tra-tra” outro. Of course, even the dance tracks on Diva reflect complex cultural prejudices; “Súbelo” invokes the all-too-common racist epithet “pelo malo” (“bad hair”) levied at Black Latinas who style their curls naturally. It’s “Quiero Bailar” that will live on as Ivy Queen’s most memorable dancefloor anthem, a reprieve from any reggaetón night dominated by cishet men’s voices and sexual cravings. The baroque harpsichord preamble will go down as one of reggaetón’s most unforgettable intros, turning an antiquated flourish into a vehement assertion of consent. Ivy Queen rides the beat, a version of producer Jeremy Harding’s “Liquid” riddim, and reminds her man that expecting sex after a perreo-fueled tryst is just plain dumb. The song affirms that women in reggaetón are more than just nightclub accessories. The gruff bars of “Quiero Bailar” and many other Ivy Queen songs are a central element of her magnetism. She’s part of a long lineage of throaty women vocalists in Latin America, like the influential Cuban singer La Lupe. Scholar Alexandra Vazquez aptly describes this genealogy as “the kind of hoarseness that sounds like having to constantly speak above things”—especially men. This quality of Ivy’s voice has also long cast a shadow on her work, sparking misogynistic and homophobic insults that characterize it as overly masculine or too butch. La Diva shrugs off these slights; she embraces her vocal style as a “blessing” that allowed her to stand out, perhaps most clearly in her songs of betrayal, like Diva’s “Tuya Soy” and “Venganza.” As scholar Petra Rivera-Rideau writes, when Ivy Queen spits venom about a partner’s infidelity in her signature baritone, she presents herself as a woman who longs to be seen and loved in her suffering, signaling many of the same themes of abandonment, anguish, and humanity La Lupe explored in her work. But Ivy Queen assures us that her agony won’t be in vain; both “Tuya Soy” and “Venganza” threaten violence for all the deception, even promising she’ll force her man to his knees if he tries it. For those of us who grew up in the midst of reggaetón’s commercial rise, Ivy Queen soundtracked hundreds of preteen parties de marquesina and femme sexual adventures. The rapper has said her career wouldn’t have blossomed without the LGBTQ community, who granted her the nickname “La Diva” in the first place (the term of endearment was first bestowed upon her at the drag shows she attended with her late friend, makeup artist Willy Rosado). She’s won over queer fans for her support on issues like gay marriage, while also challenging homophobic claims that queerness is a “virus” and defending Ricky Martin when he came out in 2010; in 2014, she toured gay clubs in the U.S. Alongside Daddy Yankee and Tego Calderón, Ivy Queen has been lauded for ushering in reggaetón’s commercial rise—in 2004, Diva: Platinum Edition hit No. 1 on Billboard’s Tropical Albums chart. But once again, Ivy was tasked with representing all those who were marginalized at the peak of the sound’s mainstream surge. Women in reggaetón were mostly known as chorus girls or side chicks; Ivy Queen became the exception to the rule. The whispered hooks and breathless moans of artists like Jenny La Sexy Voz were key to reggaetón, but often went uncredited (a tradition of silencing that continues to this day, as evidenced by the controversy around Puerto Rican singer Nesi’s unnamed appearance on Bad Bunny’s “Yo Perreo Sola” and the few Black Latinas who are currently visible in the genre’s mainstream today). Ivy Queen has described the responsibility of speaking for all women as a “challenge” and a “status that is difficult to maintain,” and in a 2014 Houston Chronicle article, she succinctly recalled the immediacy of her fame: “All of a sudden, I was the voice of many women.” Ivy Queen indisputably stepped up to the challenge, but she was forced to navigate the contours of a sexist industry. Sometimes, she had to affirm her skills in masculine or binaristic terms; at others, she had to soften herself for fear of appearing too pushy. The examples are endless: In 2008, she dismissed rumors that she was a lesbian in an interview with the Dominican newspaper Hoy, reaffirming her previous heterosexual marriage and current relationship and saying she “raps like a man.” After Diva’s release, she revealed she originally wanted to title the album La potra, but Universal Music Latino considered the title “too threatening” and “would not sign off” on it. Four years later, she told Puerto Rican newspaper El Nuevo Día about the ways she was forced to use the rhetoric of masculinity to prove herself in the industry. “For a woman to exist in this genre, no one knows what we have to go through,” she said. “Sometimes you have to show a masculine side for them to pay attention to you. I didn’t earn this spot because of a pair of boobies—it’s because of my voice, my character, and the respect I’ve had that others treat me equally.” Finally, in 2010, she echoed this sentiment, telling the El Paso Times, “In this industry, I have to be one of the guys.” All of these experiences expose the burden that women musicians face in the confines of the patriarchy. Ivy was not afraid to rap about being a woman who was confident but still plagued by heartache; nor was she afraid to celebrate her sexuality while rocking a pair of baggy pants. A new generation of artists has attempted to follow in Ivy Queen’s footsteps and cited her as an influence—among them Cardi B, Melii, and Melymel, as well as dozens of others who grew up as outsiders to the movement, like Karol G and Rosalía. Ultimately, La Caballota has remained a singular presence in mainstream reggaetón: an ardent lyricist and vocalist, a forceful defender of women and queer communities, and a torchbearer for the genre’s subversive—and commercial—promise.

Fall to Pieces,Tricky,by: Ben Cardew,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f4e8b21b28ee3b1b5f7be62/1:1/w_160/fall%20to%20pieces_tricky.jpg,2020-09-05 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/tricky-fall-to-pieces/,False Idols,"Tricky has always worn his bruised heart on his sleeve. His brilliantly desolate debut album, Maxinquaye, was inspired by his mother, who died when he was four years old, and a song like “Strugglin’” laid bare in excruciating detail his experiences of pain, darkness, and toil. Fall to Pieces, which contains some of the most darkly moving music that Tricky has produced since that debut album, was produced in the shadow of tragedy. Tricky’s daughter Mazy died in 2019 as he was beginning work on a new record. Here, on his 14th studio album, he translates that unimaginable loss into moments of nauseatingly raw emotion. “Hate This Pain,” one of the first songs Tricky worked on after his daughter’s death, channels the sickening depth of his loss into music of visceral simplicity. Tricky’s production, particularly in his early years, was enveloped in a dank, psychedelic murk that seemed to ooze out of the grooves. “Hate This Pain,” however, is unusually and agonizingly clean, its surfaces exposed like a fresh wound, a pristine MTV Unplugged in New York to Maxinquaye’s Nevermind. The song centers on a blues piano trill and tiny dabs of cello, trumpet, and slide guitar, over which Tricky and new vocal partner Marta Złakowska trade lyrics of deepest despair. It’s his best song in decades but almost exhaustingly moving, with unvarnished lines like “What a fucking game/I hate this fucking pain” delivered with agonising intensity. “Vietnam,” in which Tricky and Złakowska share a whispered duet over a detuned guitar riff, and “Take Me Shopping” have a similarly barren simplicity, reminiscent of the bleakly beautiful English West Country blues that PJ Harvey pulled from the stone on Dry. However personal the burden of Tricky’s grief, his collaborators have played a significant role in shaping the sound and feel of the album. Marta Złakowska, who Tricky discovered in a Krakow bar after a singer dropped out of his Polish tour, has the perfect voice for a Tricky vocal foil, her spectral tones the wisp of smoke to his cigarette-end mutter, while Marie-Claire Schlameus’s cello and Kristof Hahn’s slide guitar creep around the arrangements with the finesse of art thieves. It’s a shame that some of the album’s electronic touches—the minimal drum pattern on “Thinking Of” or the cheap-sounding bassline on “I’m in the Doorway”—feel rudimentary in comparison to the band’s graceful touch. But electronic experimentation does play a major role in two of the record’s most intriguingly unorthodox productions. ‘‘Running Off,” with a prominent sample from Croatian musician Đuka Čaić, is a kind of Eastern European electro blues, while “Fall Please,” with its stuttering synth riff and percussive nods to D.C. go-go , is almost upbeat in its outlook. Tricky calls “Fall Please” “the closest I’ve got to making pop,” which may overlook the pop nous of songs like Maxinquaye’s “Black Steel” (and overestimate mainstream taste for skeletal go-go production). But “Fall Please”—like Fall to Pieces as a whole—does share the laser-sharp emotional focus and melodic efficiency of the best pop music. Bar the rare moments of clunky electronics, almost every sound, touch, and shade on Fall to Pieces feels like it had to be there, in blessed contrast to the rambling dead ends, failed experiments, and misjudged covers of Tricky’s recent records. Fall to Pieces is an audacious cri de coeur that ultimately finds strength in adversity where others might fall apart. Catch up every Saturday with 10 of our best-reviewed albums of the week.

The Quiet City,Library Tapes,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f4e78aa24167c1baabf7822/1:1/w_160/the%20quiet%20city_library%20tapes.jpg,2020-09-05 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/library-tapes-the-quiet-city/,1631,"The Swedish pianist, violinist, and composer David Wenngren seems to regard minimalism less as a classical tradition than as an ascetic dare. In Library Tapes, which has been his solo project with a host of revolving collaborators since the early 2000s, Wenngren paces up to the minimum threshold where groups of tones pass into music, and not a step farther. His compositions hover and linger, straitened but far from severe, wrenching maximum feeling from one idea at a time. Once a melody has been stated in full, it’s gone. Across dozens of releases, Wenngren’s miniatures have gained depth but not mass, from the solo piano and field recordings of his earlier work to his collaborations with cellist Danny Norbury, multi-instrumentalist Peter Broderick, and ambient musician Christopher Bissonette. Wenngren doesn’t shy from titles likeSketches, Fragment, and Patterns (Repeat); he seems leery of hanging conceptual baggage on his music. If the modestly evocative title The Quiet City gives the impression of something a bit heftier, it’s apt. Wenngren is deconstructing the piano trio—a form consisting of piano, violin, and cello—and strewing its parts into musical haiku. But these are still sketches, fragments and patterns, and Wenngren still declines to elaborate on anything once it’s been said. Often, the songs fall short of two minutes, and almost never cross three, as if they were fortuitous weather that could hold for just so long. This, as the naturalistic titles suggest, is more or less what they are—10 walks in the woods, largely but never exactly the same, each already settling into irretrievable stillness. But it’s rare for Wenngren to have this many musicians on one album. His usual piano tone is offset by pianist Olivia Belli, who plays on bookends “Entering” and “Leaving.” The latter, with Julia Kent’s roving cello, is the highlight, a bright and propulsive take on Library Tapes’ sleepy drift. And pianist Akira Kosemura’s consummately innocent voice is right at home on “Brighter Lights.” As the cast grows, the material they play remains exceedingly stark and simple. Some of it would be fit for a baby’s mobile if not for the sustain and processing, a Library Tapes hallmark, that extends each touch of a string or a key into clouds of ambiguous chords and drones. In “The First Signs,” Kent and violinist Hoshiko Yamane play keening lines that leave pulsing afterimages on the silence that follows, and it’s here, between each moment and its reverberation into memory, where Wenngren cultivates his poignant sense of weightless time.

Gold Record,Bill Callahan,by: Mike Powell,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f4e75bdb67612ae41199ed2/1:1/w_160/gold%20record_bill%20callahan.jpg,2020-09-04 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/bill-callahan-gold-record/,Drag City,"A man goes to the driveway to try and start his car. The engine keeps turning over but it won’t catch. An older man runs out from across the street and tells the younger one that cranking it more will only make things worse. He invites the younger man in for a beer, which turns into dinner with the older man and his wife. Despite living across the street from each other, the two men had never met, the younger one being “the type of guy who sees a neighbor outside/And stays inside to hide.” After dinner, the older man’s wife shows the younger man a room to rest, which, judging by the pictures on the wall and the things arranged just so, belonged to the couple’s now-dead son. The young man peers through the blinds and remembers that his own children will be home soon. Where had he been going? We never find out. The young man falls asleep and wakes up in the dark to the older couple standing in the doorway. “Son, it’s OK,” they say. “It’s OK. Son. We’re OK. We’re OK.” Like a lot of Bill Callahan songs, especially the ones he started writing around the time of his 2005 album A River Ain’t Too Much to Love under his old performing name, Smog, “The Mackenzies,” from Gold Record, handles concrete events with the texture and ambiguity of dreams. Callahan’s voice is low—lower every album, it feels like—and his arrangements, while thoughtful and quietly surprising, are almost always anchored by a lone acoustic guitar. Listen at a distance and you might just hear another man in chambray doing his earnest American thing. But listen closer—the funny asides, the way the narratives ramble and unfold like a new idea explored in real time—and you can hear someone exploring how a supposedly ordinary life is often anything but. His last album, 2019’s Shepherd in a Sheepskin Vest, focused on marriage and parenthood. As the father of two boys under five, I’d never heard music that better captured the wonder and trials of domestic life from a man’s perspective—a comfort, especially, at a time when the culture was investigating what, exactly, made a good man in the first place. In the past, his characters’ attitudes toward women and children had been coyly misanthropic: They fantasized about kidnapping kids from the grocery store, made blowup dolls out of their ex-girlfriend’s clothes, and found their moral vocation in cunnilingus. One song, 1999’s “Let’s Move to the Country,” teased commitment, ending on the line, “Let’s start a… / Let’s have a…,” but left off the words—“family,” “baby”—the man couldn’t—or wouldn’t—say. If Shepherd’s man was settling down, Gold Record imagines the sweet old codger he may one day become. He chauffeurs two newlyweds through the desert and feels stupid for giving them advice, even though they asked (“Pigeons”); he grumbles at the pop singer comforting his audience with hollow bromides (“Protest Song”) and reconciles himself to marriage with a woman who hates watching him eat but hates seeing him go hungry, too (“Breakfast”). Reality has borne down on him, but he remains available to wonder: for art (“Another Song,” “As I Wander”), for the babies “with eyes like honey-drunk bees,” for the ways “the moon can make a false love feel true” (“35”). And as though to close the existential loop opened 21 years earlier, he revisits “Let’s Move to the Country,” filling in the words—“family,” “baby”—he’d left off before. In 1999, the song played like the daydream of nervous young lovers getting ahead of themselves; on Gold Record, it plays like nostalgia: Remember when we had plans? Yeah. That was good. For all its masculine cosplay, the heart of Gold Record is spontaneous, intuitive and feminine, a flock of little dreams loose in the Milky Way. You never sense him straining to make a point or steer the story. If anything, Callahan often seems like he’s following his songs instead of leading them, carefully and open to all paths, the way a birder follows the call from wherever it comes. (He is a meditator, no surprise.) Even ”Ry Cooder,” a tribute to the roots-rock musician and possibly the dumbest song Callahan has written in 27 years, is alive with punchlines, zig-zags, and little surprises a stricter sort of attention would miss. Like all supposedly simple men, Callahan makes a show of putting one foot steadily in front of the other. Then, suddenly, he leaps. The advice to the newlyweds in “Pigeons,” by the way, is this: When you are dating, you only see each other
And the rest of us can go to hell
But when you are married, you are married to the whole wide world
The rich, the poor
The sick and the well
The straights and gays
And the people that say, ‘We don’t use those terms these days.’ Callahan is in his mid-50s now, and has been making records for more than half his life. Listening to them in sequence, you can hear a songwriter moving slowly from skepticism and alienation toward gratitude and warmth. Like a lot of artists on Drag City—a label Callahan has now been on for almost 30 years, longer than any other artist on their roster—Callahan comes to his folk music from a place both post-punk and post-hippie, with the individualism and reticence of the former and the utopian intimacy of the latter. He is cranky, but generous, the kind of performer who brings you inside a secret, and who, even in jest, seems to treat his circumstances as a gift. In a bit of poetic consonance, Callahan became a father just a few years before losing his mother to cancer: The child becomes the parent, the parent moves on to make room for the new child. “I didn’t ever feel like she was being honest or expressing her feelings my whole life,” he said in an interview with Pitchfork in 2019. “As she was getting older, I begged her: Show your children who you are, because we want to know before you die. She couldn’t do it.” It’s a stark quote, harsh and soft at the same time. But in its wholeness, there’s a truth. Gold Record captures both sides: The yen to collapse the spaces between people, and the acknowledgment that some spaces are too cold to cross.

Zap the Planet,Freak Heat Waves,by: Zach Schonfeld,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f4fc4707b657428acd1ff42/1:1/w_160/zap%20the%20planet_freak%20heat%20waves.jpg,2020-09-04 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/freak-heat-waves-zap-the-planet/,Telephone Explosion,"Steven Lind, the singer for the Canadian trio Freak Heat Waves, has the kind of voice you might expect to hear from a talking turtle in a children’s movie. He drawls his words in a cartoonishly low monotone, elongating the last syllable of each line beyond reason (“prove it’s good,” in the song “Let It Go,” becomes “Prooove/It’s gooooood-uh”). In a normal band, a voice like this might seem to be a liability. But on their fourth album, Zap the Planet, Freak Heat Waves dispense with any illusions of the ordinary, concocting a suite of warped synth-pop grooves coated in Lind’s slow-talking sleaze. It’s their best album to date, if not exactly the sound Freak Heat Waves first became known for. The trio emerged from the Midwestern Canadian prairies a decade ago, amassing a small following in Canada’s art-punk scene and soon performing alongside better-known peers like Preoccupations (then Viet Cong) and Odonis Odonis, with whom they share a label. Following some well-received cassettes, the band’s self-titled debut arrived in 2012, co-produced by the late Christopher Reimer of Women and sharing more than a passing likeness with that band’s serrated post-punk temperament. On more recent albums, particularly 2018’s Beyond XXXL, Freak Heat Waves veered in the direction of goth rock and synth-heavy industrial. But the songs were often sludgy and a bit muddled, as though the band sought to mimic the texture of their singer’s vocals. Zap the Planet succeeds because of the odd tension between Lind’s dour delivery and the brightest, most exuberant grooves of the band’s career—a trick of contrast that their fellow countryman Leonard Cohen perfected on I’m Your Man. Tellingly, the least compelling tracks here are the two instrumentals, including opener “Off Axis,” a pleasant but perfunctory soundcheck of assorted synth textures. It’s not bad, but sounds like a mere warm-up for what’s to come. The album apparently owes its vintage electro sound to the band’s increasing interest in analog synths and early MIDI technology. The result is an uncommonly funky and hypnotic album. Fizzy, dueling layers of synths lead the way on highlights like “Busted” and “I’m Zapped”; the tempos are crisper and the production clearer than before, all the better to foreground Lind’s devilish croon. On the album’s centerpiece, “Dripping Visions,” he’s at his best, brooding over an unsettling encounter as the band stacks drum machines and live percussion on top of each other to maximize the pulsating groove. The group sought an arrangement that would be “as groovy as it was off-putting,” and surely succeeded. Freak Heat Waves’ affinity for sci-fi futurism has been a recurring element—the band routinely cites dystopian films like Robocop and A Clockwork Orange as influences and once described their 2015 song “Design of Success” (which is briefly sampled on Zap the Planet’s “Let It Go”) as a “strange and sexy look into an alien nightclub.” That aesthetic takes over on “I’m Zapped,” in which Lind narrates his descent into some peculiar, perhaps supernatural addiction: “It’s messing with my head/Zapped on my mattress/Zapped on my toilet.” Lyrically, it’s the kind of cheekily paranoid punk song you might expect to find on an early Cramps album. Yet the record’s title flips it into an active verb—Zap the Planet. It’s a small gesture that crystalizes this band’s implicit mission of making the world a little freakier. Freak Heat Waves remain largely unknown to American audiences, but this album makes a convincing case for making their acquaintance.","The funky and hypnotic fourth album from the Canadian trio coats a suite of warped synth-pop grooves in the lead singer’s slow-talking sleaze.

Born Again,YLZoomo,by: Alphonse Pierre,Staff Writer ,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f4fc95735497cffe4a32c08/1:1/w_160/born%20again_yl%20and%20zoomo.jpg,2020-09-04 05:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/yl-zoomo-born-again/,RRR,"YL’s personal, stream-of-consciousness raps are composed of the small and inconsequential moments that make life in New York City special: eating at the Dominican spot on the corner with the good breakfast, subway rides from Broadway to Bushwick, the little feeling of relief as the NYPD van doesn’t notice the smoke that you just exhaled. Born Again, the NYC rapper’s second collaborative album with the producer Zoomo, feels like you’re aimlessly drifting through the city by his side, seeing what he sees. It’s easy to tell that YL has spent much of his life absorbing all of the hip-hop the five boroughs have to offer: colorful, post-Illmatic Queens rap like Capone-N-Noreaga, Tragedy Khadafi, and most specifically, Mobb Deep; the superficial swagger perfected by Cam’ron and Dipset in Harlem; the cinematic Wu-Tang classics. Each song on Born Again feels like a slice of life. You won’t experience YL’s New York through the romanticization on a NYU student’s Instagram feed or the pages of a high-brow newspaper or the episodes of a television series that might as well be a fairytale. Whether he’s “Smoking eighths to The Purple Tape” on “It’s Gonna Hurt,” or reflecting on the “Nike SBs, pre-hypebeast era” on “Mike Bibby,” YL manages to capture the feel of New York, where anything might be possible but most days feel mundane and basic. There are moments when YL’s songs are too humdrum. Occasionally it’s because his bars are unmemorable, like on “Stop Bag Splitting,” which could use a splash of hyperbole. Other times Zoomo’s production can sound overfamiliar—the beat on “All Change Isn’t Growth” brings to mind the smoky production on Pink Siifu’s ensley, but not as cozy. Fortunately, over the course of the album’s 10 tracks (not including two bonus cuts), the chemistry YL and Zoomo have built since Sunday Holiday, their 2019 album, is apparent. On “Price Tag,” Zoomo’s mellow loop is the good kind of familiar, like a home-cooked meal from your grandparents, and it lays the foundation for YL’s frivolous reflections: the time he was posted up on 125th street in Harlem, or the time his friend pulled up in the cleanest Polo outfit. For the most part, YL is able to capture the intimacy of the New York hip-hop he grew up on. His imagery is invaluable, on “Youuu” and “Ragatoni,” a pair of cuts assisted by fellow New York rapper Starker, we’re aware of what he’s wearing, smoking, and drinking at all times. And on “Memory Bank,” it’s like you’re shadowing the emcee; there’s always a rough idea of his whereabouts on the New York City map. Listening to these tracks my mind constantly shifts between three reactions: I’ve been there; I’ve done that; I’ve felt that, too. But chances are, even if you grew up outside the city, you’ll still hear a piece of yourself, a moment you recognize. Born Again might be grounded in the five boroughs, but aimless youth is universal.","The NYC rapper YL’s music is full of slice-of-life details that capture the feel of aimless youth.

Plum,Widowspeak,by: Julia Gray,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f4e579c24167c1baabf781a/1:1/w_160/plum_windowspeak.jpg,2020-09-04 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/widowspeak-plum/,Captured Tracks,"Molly Hamilton and Robert Earl Thomas’s first few albums as Widowspeak had a darkness running through them. The Brooklyn duo released their 2011 self-titled debut on Captured Tracks, home of like-minded bedroom jangle bands like Wild Nothing and Beach Fossils. Widowspeak and their counterparts cast a vintage haze to match the sepia-toned filters of early Instagram. Their skillful, moody interpretations of ’70s psychedelia and sad ’90s rock evoked a dreamy sense of yearning, like nostalgia for nothing in particular. Plum, Widowspeak’s fifth LP, is resigned to more modern anxieties. It’s a tastefully small album, breezy and immediate, written and recorded before the pandemic. The band focus less on collaging retro influences and more on introducing new elements into their palette. Plum is a memento mori painted in rich hues: Fruit ripens and shrivels. Our jobs sustain us and kill us. Time is our most valuable asset and we waste it away. Glowing synth notes and guitars give “Breadwinner” the hypnotic coziness of Mazzy Star as Hamilton describes a lover’s daily slog, working late hours and longing for pure, uncomplicated romance. Acknowledgments of the past appear as faint, cloudy memories. “Amy” simmers like a desert mirage, a pulsating bass backing Hamilton’s breathy coo as she sings about a silhouette, maybe a girl she once knew: “Summer fruit, cherry tattoo/So easy-going, like your mom was there for you.” But Widowspeak’s musings on envy and exhaustion aren’t complaints. They don’t bemoan our lives’ impermanence. Plum wavers between calm acceptance and a bright downward spiral, chasing fires before they fizzle. Hamilton swaddles reflections on labor and death in honeyed tones. “Try not to see it as a curse/You think that things are getting worse/The only body I was given/The only life that you’re living,” she whispers. “Even true love; you can’t take it with you.” Existential panic has the hum of meditation. Widowspeak flirt with a certain strain of retail indie rock, the kind that plays softly over racks of bohemian-inspired tunics and overpriced candles—the equivalent of a stylishly distressed Fleetwood Mac T-shirt. But instead of feeling trapped in vague approximations of ’60s and ’70s aesthetics, Widowspeak’s vibes come with a sharp vision. Among the inspirations for Plum, the band cite YouTube playlists of pop songs remixed to sound like they’re playing in abandoned malls, David Byrne’s kooky 1986 film True Stories, and the celebrated 20th-century food writer M.F.K. Fisher. But you can also hear subtle flickers of the duo’s contemporaries: Big Thief’s heavy emotional undertow and deft guitar work echo through Thomas’s fingerpicked melodies, and “Even True Love” offers a shadier take on Real Estate’s sunny acoustics. Plum stretches far beyond a boutique clothing store, but it doesn’t take enough risks to really widen Widowspeak’s scope. Some riffs nag when they intend to mesmerize, and not all the clichés land. Perhaps the familiar refrain of “Money”—it “doesn’t grow on trees”—could’ve worked if the spindly guitar had a stronger driving rhythm, or maybe the strums would’ve been more effective beneath a more novel quip about living to work. By the time Hamilton suggests that we “tune out platitudes like these” in the last verse, her advice falls flat. The sleepy arrangements of the final two tracks, “Jeannie” and “Y2K,” fade into the background. But loud isn’t their aim, and Plum’s special, big moments stand out against the quiet. Widowspeak’s  capitalist critique becomes a mirror of the chaos that permeates our daily rhythm—buying, selling, making, doing.

"Mama, You Can Bet!",Jyoti,by: Shannon J. Effinger,Contributor,"https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f4e5f8224167c1baabf781d/1:1/w_160/Mama,%20You%20Can%20Bet!_jyoti.jpg",2020-09-03 05:00:00,Jazz,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/jyoti-mama-you-can-bet/,eOneSomeOthaShip,"During a radio interview in 1961, James Baldwin famously said that to be Black living in America, “and to be relatively conscious is to be in a state of rage almost, almost all of the time.” Nearly six decades later, that “rage” has yet to be quelled, from Civil Rights to Black Lives Matter. From Birmingham to Minneapolis to Kenosha. From Emmett Till to George Floyd to Breonna Taylor, and a countless list of black and brown names, eulogized and immortalized only by the senseless violence waged against them, not by the promise of their lives fulfilled. Thankfully, the ineradicable ache of Odetta and Nina Simone’s powerful and resonant calls has given rise to a newer generation of artists like Georgia Anne Muldrow, whose ever-expanding canvas of soul and jazz continues to reimagine, and even reproach the many winding bends of Black life. With Mama, You Can Bet!, the West Coast-based singer-producer-multi-instrumentalist navigates these unprecedented times, utilizing a keen yet multidirectional lens. The third “Jyoti” installment of her solo jazz series draws from several different sources for inspiration, including the late Alice Coltrane, who gave Muldrow her chosen name, Jyoti, employed as a pseudonym for the series. Set against the backdrop of rampant vilifying and killings of unarmed Black people, her latest album plays as an impassioned, welcoming love letter to the countless musical forebears who crossed her path in her artistic development. As she now summons these predecessors for guidance, Muldrow renders a cosmic hybrid of soul, hip-hop, and call-and-response between herself and her jazz lineage, finding solace, beauty, and deliverance from utter confusion and turmoil. On the title track, Muldrow sets a sanguine tone for the album’s opening. Layered with looping West African drums, double bass, and choral backing vocals—all courtesy of Muldrow—the arrangement evokes a live hush harbor meeting, where enslaved Blacks once gathered in secret to vent and worship. While this is largely a joyful tribute to her mother, spiritual and jazz singer-songwriter Rickie Byars, who often contributed lead vocals to Pharoah Sanders and the late pianist Roland Hanna, a few sparse, dissonant chord strikes on the piano denotes Muldrow acknowledging the many sacrifices Byars likely had to endure in her lifetime. As praise shouts of “Hey, Mama” reverberate, it soon transitions from personal homage to a declarative mantra, imploring all women to still “believe” that requited love is possible: “Mama, you can bet, there’s many a man, who’d love your hand.”. Countervailing the title track, as the album’s focus shifts more inward, the mood becomes stark and deeply personal. On the pulsating “This Walk,” Muldrow offers a harrowing glimpse of how violence can both “ignite and snuff out” one’s voice. She does the same on the foreboding “Orgone,” which opens with a few ominous chords that soon are repeated in tandem with a refrain of displacement: “Maladjusted in this land/The powers just can’t end the plan.” Though the most stripped-down of all the tracks, the heft of “Orgone” grows searing and resonant with every listen. Evocative of Gil Scott-Heron and Brian Jackson’s “River of My Fathers,” with just a few simple words and scant piano accompaniment, Muldrow elicits vulnerability and introspection, and in turn finds commonality in her own abandonment, a flagrant exclusion from her country’s promise and potential. Much like earlier releases, notably 2019’s Black Love & War, she outstretches both arms, crying out for refuge from an “Africa” that appears within reach. The silence is deafening. Muldrow also explores the planetary realms of Sun Ra and Charles Mingus, reinterpreting their works in a modern-day context. On “Bemoanable Lady Geemix” and “Fabus Foo Geemix”—remixes of Mingus’ “Bemoanable Lady” and “Fables of Faubus” respectively—Muldrow places greater emphasis on the melodic lines. Serving mainly as interludes for the album’s socially-charged throughline, the addition of these two tracks not only demonstrates the deep roots of racism but also acknowledges how jazz artists led the charge in addressing it—whether they wanted to or not. “Ra’s Noise (Thukumbado)” invites the only other guest musician on the entire album, saxophonist Lakecia Benjamin, Muldrow’s longtime friend and collaborator. Together, they envision a genderless and raceless dominion, one that is perhaps only reachable among Sun Ra’s many orbits, just not here on Earth. “If you believe the ‘Negro’ has a soul,” as borrowed from Marcus Garvey’s “Back to Africa” speech, then why are we continuously refused the rights we have earned, fought for, even bled for. Why burden us with insurmountable odds and disproportionate circumstances, a gross disparity made only more apparent by the ravages of a global pandemic, widespread poverty, and an unending open season on Black people. Mama, You Can Bet! is a splendidly audacious attempt at not only elucidating these societal ills, but also finding resolve in assuming a Pan-Africanist identity, firmly grounded in jazz and spirituality. From the driving blues line in “The Cowrie Waltz,” the lush soundscapes heard on “Ancestral Duckets” and “Bop for Aneho,” and the celestial soul claps that emanate from “Zane, The Scribe,” Georgia Anne Muldrow, once again, engenders her own Afrofuturistic realm, one that is heard, seen, and felt in the here and now.

Got to Be Tough,Toots and the Maytals,by: Evan Rytlewski,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f49670d7b657428acd1fce9/1:1/w_160/got%20to%20be%20tough_toots%20&%20the%20maytals.jpg,2020-09-03 05:00:00,Global,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/toots-and-the-maytals-got-to-be-tough/,Trojan JamaicaBMG,"Reggae legend Toots Hibbert’s decades-long streak of sweaty, impressively athletic live shows came to a halt in 2013, after he was struck in the head by a vodka bottle during one of them. Hibbert filed a $21 million lawsuit against the 19-year-old who threw the bottle, but in a letter to a judge he pleaded that the man be sentenced to no jail time. “He is a young man, and I have heard what happens to young men in jail,” Hibbert wrote—a pointed understatement. Hibbert famously did prison time as a young man himself for marijuana possession, and his signature song “54-46 (That's My Number)” burned with the cruelty he experienced there. On some level, Hibbert has spent the rest of his career trying to reconcile the fundamental injustice of that incarceration, the way freedom could be taken away so arbitrarily. Hibbert’s injury took the wind out of what had been a pretty remarkable late-career run. It sidelined him from the road for three years, and left him with depression, mood swings, and headaches. He was later diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder. But the injury also set him up for the kind of comeback narrative that must be irresistible for Hibbert, a fighter who still thinks of himself as the boxer he was as a teen. A recent Rolling Stone profile paints a portrait for a legend who continues to work harder than might be ideal for his age, spending seven days a week in the studio. He air-boxes enthusiastically and still spars with a trainer, so it only makes sense that on the cover of Got To Be Tough, his first Toots and the Maytals record in 10 years, he's illustrated in his default pose: throwing a punch. There's a Rocky analogy for every occasion, and at this point in his career, Hibbert is Balboa circa the 2006 installment of the franchise. In that movie, Rocky was slowed by bad knees and stiffened by arthritis and calcium build-ups in his joints, leaving him with just one move: hitting for blunt force. Even though he was a shadow of his former glory, there was still a certain power in watching a diminished titan work around the limitations of age. And so it is with a 77-year-old Hibbert, whose once almost supernaturally resilient voice is now showing real signs of wear. He's lost some considerable range since 2010’s Flip and Twist, but he's switched up his attack accordingly, learning into the grit. His voice is hoarse on the soul scorcher “Just Brutal,” but his commitment sells the song”—he doesn't let the frog in his throat stop him from commanding the call-and-response like a one-man Sam and Dave. And although it may be low on the list of songs anybody needed to hear covered again, Hibbert’s reworking of Bob Marley's “Three Little Birds,” featuring Ziggy Marley on vocals and Ringo Starr on percussion, similarly delivers real heat, energizing Marley's standard with an urgent tempo and feverish horns. Hibbert has always shined during these hard, soul workouts, and it's admirable that he hasn’t let age keep them away from him. Got To Be Tough’s mid-tempo rocksteady numbers, including its title track, don’t make nearly the same impression, but even on the album’s mellowest songs, Hibbert’s commitment is clear. In his Rolling Stone profile, Hibbert resists talking about retirement, but acknowledges his career is winding down. It may not rival his classic albums—and it never deludes itself into thinking it does—but Got To Be Tough captures Hibbert as committed as always, still giving it all he’s got.

Greenhouse,Caitlin Pasko,by: Olivia Horn ,Contributor ,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f4e73d727a5d1b3b6bdcac2/1:1/w_160/greenhouse_caitlin%20pasko.jpg,2020-09-03 05:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/caitlin-pasko-greenhouse/,Whatever's Clever,"Any digital native worth their salt knows that the most effective tool for checking up on one’s ex is not Facebook or Insta or even finsta. It’s Venmo, where unguarded users drop emoji-riddled breadcrumb trails to who they’re spending time with. On “Horrible Person,” a highlight of her new record, Greenhouse, the 32-year-old Brooklynite Caitlin Pasko finds herself on the receiving end of such unwanted scrutiny. “Please stop texting me...When you see that I’ve moved on/After looking me up on Venmo,” she sings. There is a certain grim humor in the idea of human relationships being distilled to a string of mundane transactions, but if this lyric sounds like a droll punch line, it’s one delivered with an exceptionally straight face. So is the blunt assertion that gives the song its title: “You know you are a horrible person/I shouldn’t have to explain it to you.” Across Greenhouse, Pasko rejects and moves on from the emotional labor demanded by a manipulative partner—the sort of person who prefers digging up painful memories to being forgotten, who feigns innocence when confronted with their faults. Pasko’s delivery minimizes her words’ humorous potential; rather than make a quick joke of someone else’s awfulness, she holds space for a more vulnerable response, letting her words linger without disrupting their tension. “Walking is hard/When you have to lift your legs, your quadriceps,” she sings on “Unwell,” a song about fighting to meet a baseline of human functionality. Songwriting is also hard. Pasko’s lyrics call attention to the procedure of taking a step; meanwhile, her sparse arrangement invites us to consider the mechanics of every chord change. Right foot, left foot, right foot. A major, E minor, D major. Measured and effortful, with minimal instrumentation—piano chords and drones, largely—Greenhouse is a record that rewards patience and focus. Pasko tends to interrupt herself by breathing mid-phrase, to let her sentiments balloon out across many measures, requiring listeners to lock in for extended periods of time in order to derive meaning from her words. But in spite of their slow speed—and sometimes even because of it—her sharpest lines can induce whiplash. On “Quiet Weather,” she sings, “When I think of you, I take a sho–,” drawing out the vowel. Your brain might autofill a “t” to finish the protracted word, thinking she’s reaching for a liquid cure for heartache. But the real lyric is much more gruesome, and startling when she gets to it: “I take a sho–vel to my chest, and dig as deep as I can get.” There’s much talk about diaristic songwriters who self-excavate; usually, they aren’t quite so literal about it. The shovel is a fitting tool for Pasko. Greenhouse is named for a structure that preserves plant life; on “To the Leaves,” she imagines one erected inside her body to protect her mind. Pasko’s affinity for the natural world is laced into the imagery she often reaches for: A peach in the leaves, a lake, the sun, snowfall. But even more than nature’s symbols, she invokes its processes of recovery and replenishment. “Today I thought about how it must feel to give birth/And to look in the eyes of yourself,” she muses, her own voice twinning itself, drawing out the idea of regeneration. Elsewhere, she realizes that “that growth and letting go are so complexly intertwined.” As any gardener knows, you have to prune away dead leaves to make room for new buds. This emphasis on growth is particularly pronounced on the back half of Greenhouse, giving it a narrative arc even while many of the specifics remain out of focus. “Ooo Happy,” a brief interlude on which Pasko’s light soprano bobs like a kite catching a breeze, proves pivotal in this respect: It serves as a bridge between the record’s more somber opening and more generative conclusions. Remember Pasko’s struggle with her legs? On the second half of the album, a version of the same scene recurs. “Today I spent my time/Walking around a neighborhood that's not mine,” she sings in the earlier iteration; “Today I remembered/What it feels like to go walking/… In a city that's not my city,” in the later one. Feeling separates the second instance from the first; it signals an opening up to the possibility of sensation and discovery, where before she was just miserably marking minutes. It’s a quiet sort of progress that doesn’t call attention to itself—but meaningful, all the same. Catch up every Saturday with 10 of our best-reviewed albums of the week.

The Baby,Samia ,by: Ashley Bardhan,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f4e7232b28ee3b1b5f7be26/1:1/w_160/the%20baby_samia.jpg,2020-09-03 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/samia-the-baby/,Grand Jury,"Everyone and no one is “baby.” You call people “baby” when you love them, or when you’re infantilizing yourself via internet meme. For Gen Z, cutesy self-identification as “baby” softens a harsh reality of coming of age in a time where everything is too much or too little—too much pollution, too few jobs, too much debt. Twenty-three-year-old Samia Finnerty’s debut album The Baby deals with “too much” in elegant ways, navigating the trappings of young adulthood with subtle, reflective songwriting and poetic lyrical beauty. The Baby is technically Samia’s first full-length project, but she’s been entrenched in the entertainment industry for a while. Her parents are the actors Kathy Najimy and Dan Finnerty, and Samia has been acting and pursuing music for most of her life. When she was 17 and living in New York, she made a fake manager’s email address to help her book shows. On the painful “Is There Something in the Movies?,” she observes the industry as if she’s somewhat removed from it, sing-shrieking “Everyone dies/But they shouldn’t die young/Anyway, you’re invited to set” over a plaintive acoustic guitar. Like Grand Jury labelmates Hippo Campus and Twin Peaks, Samia favors a sardonically sunny indie rock sound, good for driving in circles around your old high school and thinking about how different you look now. But she sets herself apart with her voice, which is where the truly exciting things happen. It’s dark and smooth like a melted caramel, and she sets it at the forefront of her songs, which are sparse aside from a guitar, a drum set, and occasional airy synth or keyboard. The flexibility of her tone allows her to explore a wide range of feelings, from anger to sarcasm to wry optimism. Her intimate lyrics often conjure bad feelings—betrayal, powerlessness, the gross human need to impress others. On the album’s first verse, Samia sings, “I said loving you is bigger than my head/And then you dove in/And then I said, ‘I’m afraid that I need men’/ You said, ‘Need me, then.’” It sounds overwhelming, giving yourself to someone like that, being taunted into it, and the conversational tone makes the verses feel both personal and perverse. She offers crystal clear images, like on “Does Not Heal,” where she recounts cutting her thigh after climbing a fence, remembering being “so scared I had tetanus/I checked on it every night/Purple and yellow/The pregnable skin was so coarse and tight.” The images she produces range from realistic to metaphysical, but they’re always evocative and sensory. Samia often forgoes the practice of burying uncomfortable personal emotions with obscure lyrics, opting for diaristic clarity and precision. It’s unclear who the “baby” of her album title is, but still, the intimacy of the term speaks to the weird in-between space that Samia’s generation is occupying right now. As many people like to say of the Class of 2020, we were college freshmen when Trump was elected and graduated in a pandemic. With few job prospects and usually no health insurance, a lot of us have turned to living with our parents. It’s hard to become an adult at a time where everything is so dangerous, to stop seeing yourself as a baby when you’re still so vulnerable. But life still happens and it still hurts in all the typical ways—heartbreak, bad friends, confusion. Songwriters like Samia are still trying to make sense of it.

Club Future Nostalgia,Dua LipaThe Blessed Madonna,by: Owen Myers ,Contributor ,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f4e54a113228581eaf280e6/1:1/w_160/Club%20Future%20Nostalgia-%20The%20Remix%20Album_dua%20lipa.jpg,2020-09-02 05:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/dua-lipa-the-blessed-madonna-club-future-nostalgia/,Warner,"A pop diva is poorer without her remixes. Madonna’s dance remixes span Shep Pettibone’s kinetic “Express Yourself” rework to Stuart Price’s revitalizing overhaul of her discography on ’00s tours. Whitney Houston’s club versions brought extra oomph to a joyous NYC Pride performance in 1999. (“If your music’s banging in the clubs, you’re doing okay,” Houston noted.) And the hip-hop and dance remixes of Mariah Carey, pop’s queen of the remix, lower drawbridges between genres and become playgrounds for innovation. Not all of these icons descended from the pop pantheon to party with the people. But Dua Lipa, who made True Blue for the 2020s with this year’s Future Nostalgia, is a raver. At last year’s Glastonbury festival, she wore sunglasses, a red wig, and adopted the alter-ego “Valentina Vicious” so that she could party in peace. Lipa met The Blessed Madonna that weekend, and linked up with the Kentucky-born producer earlier this year to create Club Future Nostalgia, a fun but overstuffed mix that hopscotches between piano house, Baltimore club, and the kind of dance remixes that power Chelsea gay bars like so many cheap well drinks. A stacked lineup includes Masters at Work, Mr. Fingers, Mark Ronson, Yaeji, and Moodymann, with seamless transitions from The Blessed Madonna. But heavy-handed editing can make Club Future Nostalgia feel oddly uneven. Yaeji whittles and rebuilds “Don’t Start Now” into bouncy minimal disco, chopping her own murmured vocals into the beat like ASMR with somewhere to be. The previously unreleased “Love Is Religion,” remixed by The Blessed Madonna, sounds like a Lip Sync for Your Life song from RuPaul’s Drag Race in the best way. Mr. Fingers’ skeletal version of “Hallucinate” lifts just “I’ma love you like a fool/Breathe you in till I hallucinate” from Lipa’s original. In his edit, “fool” sounds like “fucker,” a soundtrack for any darkroom sex god to lay out their agenda to a willing partner. But the Mr. Fingers track is abbreviated—The Blessed Madonna adds a superfluous sample of Gwen Stefani’s “Hollaback Girl,” which takes up nearly a third of its runtime. Similarly, Jacques Lu Cont’s Balearic rework of the previously-unreleased “That Kind of Woman” is sublime, but getting only three minutes of it feels like a tease; Lu Cont, aka Stuart Price, can make every second of a seven-minute remix feel essential. DJ drops from Lipa punctuate the record, a trick Vince Staples also used on his 2018 album FM!, which was styled as a radio show. Club Future Nostalgia feels less like London pirate radio than a show from one of BBC Radio 1’s most inquisitive DJs. That accessibility isn’t a bad thing. Jayda G’s amped-up version of “Cool” is exactly what you want to hear in a warehouse at 3 AM, football whistles and all, and Horse Meat Disco’s euphoric “Love Again” seems to be made for the moment when the sun starts to peek through a club’s shutters. But Club Future Nostalgia’s starriest moments are some of its weakest. Mark Ronson’s depressingly loungey remix of “Physical,” with a disappointing verse from Stefani, manages to make one of the year’s most vivid pop songs feel like background music. And the irresistible “Levitating” is deflated by phoned-in features from Madonna and Missy Elliott, who were more charismatic when they teamed up for a Gap commercial. Great DJ sets are built around tension and release, but whipping through 15 producers in 50 minutes, Club Future Nostalgia struggles to build the anticipation to earn a payoff. The most dazzling exception comes at the end of the album: Moodymann’s remix of “Break My Heart” is by far the best track. Built around a bass lick, cowbells, and weird ambiance—clinking bottles, a menacing laugh—it feels terrifying and beautiful. A more left-field approach to Lipa’s music—as seen elsewhere, on Hyperdub artist Loraine James’ dark experimental rework of “Don’t Start Now,” and Erika de Casier’s neo-noir take on “Physical”—would have enriched the mix. As it is, Club Future Nostalgia is a bit like a round of exquisite corpse: fun while it lasts, but somehow less than the sum of its parts.

The Room,Ricky Reed,by: Vrinda Jagota,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f15c2ac1b754f09221c0580/1:1/w_160/the%20room_ricky%20reed.jpg,2020-09-02 05:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/ricky-reed-the-room/,Nice Life,"Ricky Reed, the producer behind Lizzo’s “Truth Hurts,” describes the song’s ascent as the biggest thing that’s ever happened to him. Lizzo brings a singular charisma to the song, an ability to make you feel like the main character when you listen to it. There’s a reason it’s been plastered on countless post-breakup Instagram posts and drunkenly belted at every karaoke night. When discussing the process behind creating the song, his response was more visceral than technical: “My natural inclination on this song, or any song, is gonna be to have the bass knock.” That unbridled exuberance is what makes so many of the other songs he’s produced, from Jason Derulo’s “Dirty Talk” to Fifth Harmony’s “Bo$$,” so undeniably fun. But despite the success of the countless pop hits he produced or co-written, he hadn’t released much of his own music, except for a few singles, until The Room. His debut album features an array of rising artists like duendita and Lido Pimienta, as well as pop-soul acts like Leon Bridges and A-list indie bands like Dirty Projectors. It sets an entirely different pace and tone from his earlier work, one that is much more exploratory and subdued. These are songs for soundtracking solitary, balmy night drives, not for kitchen dance parties with your friends. The album promotion leans heavily on the narrative surrounding its creation. Most of these songs were written live during his NICE LIVE! YouTube sessions, which Reed saw as a way of staying connected with friends and collaborators during the pandemic. When “Real Magic,” the album’s first single, brought Reed to tears in the middle of the livestream, he felt he had to turn these ephemeral moments into a more permanent project. Certainly, there’s an improvisational looseness to this album compared to the pristine sheen of the pop music he has worked on. But beyond that, none of the backstory that Reed relays is evident in the music. Generally, there’s a vagueness to The Room, a hazy melancholy that ties the project together without much lyrical cohesion. It’s hard to parse what this album is about beyond the narrative surrounding its creation. Ultimately, most of the songs on The Room just aren’t that affecting, which is disappointing given the star power here. “Real Magic” might have brought Reed to tears, but the rest of us remain unmoved. The lyrics are unobjectionable, if a little saccharine. But as a whole, it doesn’t showcase St. Panther’s frenetic flow as a rapper or her skill as a vocalist the way her own tracks like “Infrastructure” or “Playa” do. The hi-hats are distracting, and the vocal distortion and watery synth subdue her usual vibrancy. And it’s a disappointment to hear duendita’s tremendous voice largely buried in the mix on “Us (How Sweet It Was).” Elsewhere, the lyrics can be painfully corny. “Fav Boy”’s refrain of “I want to be your favorite boy/I want to be your favorite toy” has the all-too-familiar syntax of Tinder messages from men who are “just looking for someone to go on adventures with.” Especially following a heavy verse about feeling apathy at a relative’s funeral, the line feels like a bizarre non-sequitur. Godfather666’s laments on “No Future,” which address loneliness in the most direct terms, are similarly unrelatable. It’s hard to feel too much sympathy for someone singing, “Who could ever love me?/I’m only nice when I want something.” There are a few shining moments here, though. “Catch You” lacks the complex instrumentation—brass and electronic flourishes, rich orchestration—that brought Lido Pimienta’s latest album, Miss Colombia, to life. Still, the flute winds beautifully around her gossamer falsetto. The elusive lyricism—“Wait for me/I’ll be with you though/Trust/And the leaves will fall”—is some of the most evocative on the album. “We’ll Be Home Soon,” which quivers like a serpentwithfeet track, is beguiling too. You’re left wondering what the song could have evolved into if it lasted longer than 40 seconds. As a means of community building, and as a document of Ricky Reed exploring a new sound, The Room is impressive. It’s nice to see him slow down and reach out. But as a project that stands on its own, there’s not much to keep you coming back. In the dreary, hot days of a lonely COVID summer, these watery songs seem to dissipate into the air.

Agora,Bebel Gilberto,by: Dean Van Nguyen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f4d1b4d45d2f3eda6f74652/1:1/w_160/Agora_bebel%20gilberto.jpg,2020-09-02 05:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/bebel-gilberto-agora/,PIAS,"Bebel Gilberto made Agora over three years of tragedy. In that time the singer lost her best friend, who suffered a fatal heart attack as Gilberto spoke with him over the phone, and her mother, the samba star Miúcha, who died of lung cancer. Then Gilberto’s father, Brazilian music legend João Gilberto, passed away in 2019. All the while she was at work on Agora, an album that raises the question: How might personal turmoil  have reshaped an artist whose music has been defined by its tranquility? Since emerging as a solo artist in the mid 1980s, Gilberto’s music has been calming on the ear yet emotionally resonant. The 54-year-old’s smoky vocals and bossa-nova arrangements are the sound of stirred feelings; she can move the soul with the faintest brushstrokes. (When Nip/Tuck used the ghostly, gorgeous “Lonely” as its pilot episode’s theme song in 2003, it hinted at the wicked underside of beauty that the cosmetic surgery-themed show aspired to probe). Still, unlike Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds’ Ghosteen, Agora does not pontificate on grief, nor does it trade in voyeuristic detail. Perhaps the most personal track is the moving “O Que Não Foi Dito” (“What Wasn’t Said”), a song Gilberto wrote for her father. Yet the words (sung, like the majority of the album, in Portuguese) are oblique, tender, and not overly explicit, with Bebel singing of the bond father and daughter shared: “I know you trust in me.” Despite its unhappy origins, Agora mostly shares the polished feel typical of Gilberto’s albums, albeit with a few distinct flourishes from producer Thomas Bartlett, who helps color in the edges with understated electronic touches. The title track’s clattering beat nods to Fiona Apple’s penchant for unusual percussion, with a quirky feel complemented by Gilberto’s spoken-word delivery. On “Essence,” Gilberto’s soft touch is matched with twinking synth pop. Most striking might be “Na Cara,” a duet with fellow veteran Brazilian performer Mart’nália, where the singers playfully bob and swagger over a creeping double bass. As ever, Gilberto’s delicate melodies feel like they might not withstand a strong breeze. This elegance helps carry the goofy but charming “Yet Another Love Song,” which walks the same path as Wings’ “Silly Love Songs.” Here, Gilberto looks at her beau and immediately feels inspired to write a romance tune—acknowledging, like Paul and Linda McCartney before her, that this is well-trodden ground:  “Now the world makes room for yet another love song.” she sings. Gilberto also toys with eternal songwriting truisms on “Cliché,” addressing her listeners directly: “For those who do not know/I’m singing this melody for you.” Unfortunately, her voice takes on an exaggerated wispiness here, bordering on frailty. There are a few other moments throughout the record when Gilberto and Bartlett’s instincts seem off: The lagging beat and wordless refrain of “Raio” feel half-hearted and out of step with the rest of the set. But for the most part, Gilberto’s voice finds the pocket, and when she’s front and center, the arrangements expertly draped around her, Agora is a rapturous listen. It’s not the star’s finest work—for newcomers, 2000’s Tanto Tempo remains her most engaging set—but in a time of personal distress, Gilberto embraces the familiar comforts of her graceful sound.

All These Perfect Crosses,Craig Finn,by: Arielle Gordon,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5ef255797bb7acb328d56f0a/1:1/w_160/All%20These%20Perfect%20Crosses_Craig%20Finn.png,2020-09-02 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/craig-finn-all-these-perfect-crosses/,Partisan,"The universe of Craig Finn meshes together imperfectly, like multiple exposures overlaid in the same frame. Its signposts take the form of proper nouns: names, cities, bars, car brands. Occasionally these recur, but in Finn’s recent work they’re more often blurred vignettes—a dancer with a penchant for violence, a troubled former child star, a drug dealer with a vengeance. Finn seems keenly aware of the character details; as the frontman of the Hold Steady, he’s built a career on codifying rambunctious personas in his band’s shout-along choruses. The more intimate lyrics in his solo work extend those characters’ narratives, building on existing frameworks without crafting wholly new stories. “I guess I felt...that visiting them for a song at a time might be more interesting than putting them through a number of phases,” he said after the release of 2019’s I Need a New War. On All These Perfect Crosses, a Record Store Day collection of outtakes, demos, and acoustic reworkings from his three previous solo records, he returns to the small towns and smaller relationships he’s built over the past five years, carving notches in the edge of the puzzle where he can affix new pieces. But the shift from the Hold Steady—with whom Finn has continued to release rowdy, closing-time anthems—to his solo work was not always so natural. The sparsely recorded songs on 2015’s Faith in the Future almost felt like unfinished demos, the room tone in “Going to a Show” almost loud enough to swallow his guitars. He wanted to write small stories, but his meekness suggested he didn’t know how to recede gracefully. By 2017’s We All Want the Same Things, he’d refined his approach, adding harmonies from Annie Nero and Cassandra Jenkins and the occasional wind instrument to create an appropriately bluesy atmosphere for his already dispirited lyrics. The retakes and outtakes on All These Perfect Crosses bring his past three records together into more perfect harmony. The parenthetical “Horn Version” of 2017’s “God in Chicago” casts the striking spoken-word journey in elegiac sepia tones. The somber, scorched piano-and-guitar ballad “They Know Where I Live,” originally offered in an EP accompanying Faith in the Future, draws a straight line between that record’s stripped-back approach and the bolder instrumentation of We All Want the Same Things. But on a record with only one brand-new entry, it’s the acoustic versions of songs from Finn’s previous two albums that feel most revitalized. “Magic Marker,” a sauntering blues crooner complete with tambourine hits and brassy horns, is reimagined as coffeehouse folk, the finger-picked guitar a fittingly pensive accompaniment for reminiscences on late nights and wasted youths. On I Need a New War, Finn wrote about the life of Ulysses S. Grant and the ennui that follows triumph. When the big war, the new album, the cross-country tour is over, what’s left except to rehash the glory days? Judging by “All These Perfect Crosses,” the only new song on the album, solo Finn continues to be, as he sang on I Need A New War, “Grant at Galena,” taking stock of his life over a stiff drink in western Illinois. Backed by the minor piano chords that have become a familiar palette, he sings haltingly about a dead-end romance between two old friends, a pair who are empathetic but mismatched. “It’s hard to force yourself to fall in love with friends,” he sings, voice ticking up a bit mid-sentence, as if struck by its depressing irony. It’s another new relationship in Finn’s grand narrative patchwork, but its pieces match—the lover’s name is Cindy, who we’ve previously met as a name scrawled in a bathroom stall on We All Want the Same Things. Even as he revisits old wounds, Finn’s world-weary explorations continue to reveal new vantage points.","With a collection of outtakes, demos, and acoustic reworkings from his three previous solo records, the Hold Steady frontman re-examines familiar characters from new angles.

Whole New Mess,Angel Olsen,by: Jenn Pelly,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f469af10bce6addc0e64799/1:1/w_160/whole%20new%20mess_angel%20olsen.jpg,2020-09-01 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/angel-olsen-whole-new-mess/,Jagjaguwar,"Before opening her songs to other people, Angel Olsen collaborated with loneliness. Whole New Mess was her blistering original vision for 2019’s epic All Mirrors: a stark acoustic album that she recorded the previous fall at church studio The Unknown in Anacortes, Washington, while still processing the wounds of a breakup. It was months later that the second version—All Mirrors—began to emerge, recreating the emotional catastrophe with dazzling strings and synthesizers, a baroque pop maelstrom. And yet, despite the ornate arrangements of All Mirrors, swarming and towering into the red, Olsen’s colossal voice always played the starring role. The sweep of the MGM strings matched it. With Olsen’s many-hued warble at the center—at times sounding like a Joan of Arc for crackling emotional resilience—the raw Whole New Mess recordings embody their theme of inner strength. It’s tempting to say that Whole New Mess calls back to Olsen’s other more minimal works, like her exquisitely distant first EP, 2010’s Strange Cacti (“Your thoughts exist in someone else’s head,” she assured us); or the fevered eloquence of 2012’s Half Way Home; or the cassette where she once covered Dolly Parton and Skeeter Davis. But Whole New Mess has a singular power. The songs are spare but still feel electric, and despite their lower volume compared to All Mirrors, you couldn’t necessarily call them quiet. Their slow-strummed chords and finger-picked patterns are at times deliberately brittle and blown out. Whole New Mess amplifies a different source of loudness. These unvarnished songs sound in harmony with the elements of their atmosphere: the vapor in the air, the dew at twilight. If the sun’s radiance can enter the frame of a piece of music then “Waving, Smiling” is proof. If the night itself could be a component of a song then you might sense it on “Tonight (Without You).” Whole New Mess makes the experience of solitude sound metaphysical: Olsen sings of stretching her bones out on the floor, waving her hand at no one, watching the thoughts inside her head come clear, like an introvert’s prayer. “I like the life I lead without you,” she sings on “Tonight,” as it glows. This is the lonesome sound, where in lieu of studio-made fireworks you simply hear everything, as orchestrated by one person. “It’s every season, where it is I’m going,” Olsen croons on the title track, a new song and among her best ever, about weathering the storm of really changing, of recalibrating the heart by way of the body and mind. She sings with the depth and candor of Patsy Cline, but her guitar chords are choppy, unpolished, underscoring the point: Life requires messes. Whole New Mess cycles through these phases and shows their seams. “Too Easy (Bigger Than Us)” is the sound of love beginning, of obsession incarnate, and while the All Mirrors cut exists in a soft hallucinatory haze, this one is desperate and haunting. “Some things happen for a reason/Cancel all these plans/I’m dreaming,” Olsen sings in a high-pitched teardrop that wells like Hank Williams. “(New Love) Cassette” previously evoked smitten AM pop reborn in Broadcast, but here it sounds like no one but Olsen and the scratchy surfaces of her guitar strings, suspended in time. The song is like cellophane, voicing a desire to be someone’s “strength” and “breath.” These illusions soon unfurl. The brooding, wearied ballad “(Summer Song)” tells a tale of enduring hell to find “the weight of all the world came rushing through.” On All Mirrors, the title track and “Lark” scaled staggering heights. What’s clear on Whole New Mess is that those songs—retitled as “(We Are All Mirrors)” and “Lark Song”—are also the most searching and inquisitive, moving by their own inexhaustible logic. Olsen said she wrote “Lark” about the verbal abuse she has endured in relationships; when she sings, “The way you scream like something else is a matter,” the scream is literal. On both albums, “Lark” is fittingly monumental in response. Olsen sings of “hiding out inside my head” with tidal force, staking out a fortress above the turbulence, a place to protect her dreams. Within them, “(We Are All Mirrors)” borrows one of Surrealism’s most potent images, the mirror, as a reminder that every surface is a possible site of recognition or distortion. Its thick layers of reverb, clangor, and busted organ drones reflect as much. Even the parentheses-filled track titles evoke a mutability. The transformation that these piercing songs undergo between All Mirrors and Whole New Mess echoes a fact of Olsen’s work that grows truer with each release: she has become a voice of possibility, one ever in flux. The candlelit torch song “Chance (Forever Love),” the penultimate track of Whole New Mess, is a scene of falling action with no clear conclusion, recalling the wonder of Judy Garland if revisited through the supreme melancholy of Sandy Denny. Olsen aches in her conviction, “leaving once again, making my own plan,” “not looking for the answer, or anything that lasts,” wandering with her disillusionment and her glint of hope. “All that space in between where we stand/Could be our chance,” Olsen sings. “It’s hard to say forever love.” If the ending is messy, complicated and unresolved, that’s just right.

Inner Song,Kelly Lee Owens,by: Nathan Smith,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f48057a9308ac93430baa15/1:1/w_160/inner%20song_kelly%20lee%20owens.jpg,2020-09-01 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/kelly-lee-owens-inner-song/,Smalltown Supersound,"Few artists are as adept at fusing electronic music’s warmth and coldness as Kelly Lee Owens. What makes Owens’ work so distinctive is her equal proficiency as a songwriter and producer; her vocals are as confident and captivating as her beats. Inner Song, her second album, boasts a variety of styles, floating between tight pop structures and extended club grooves. What ties the record together is her unusual ability to join the physical with the emotional. Straight-up techno bangers, like “Night” and “Melt!,” juxtapose the ethereal calmness of Owens’ voice with the commanding presence of a throbbing bassline. Dancefloor tracks like “Jeanette” are more intense than on Owens’ first record, with driving synths over hard, unfailing kick drums. She occasionally approaches R&B territory: “Re-Wild” is slow and pulsating, as waves of her voice cascade over a grinding beat. “On” weaves an introspective style somewhere between dream pop and trip-hop into a long and vibrating rhythm, without a seam to be seen. Even on the tracks that veer toward more conventional pop structure, pockets of experimentation still exist—on “L.I.N.E.” her voice trails off and fades away, leaving nothing behind but a simple synth sequence. Owens’ self-titled debut album played with sounds that felt spiritual, almost new age, like the tablas on “S.O.” and sitar drone on “8.” On Inner Song, that meditative quality comes less from instrumental texture and more from the actual form of the songs. Though she drifts across tempos and dabbles with a variety of drum patterns, loops—both instrumental and lyrical—provide the record’s through line. On “Wake-Up,” life’s circular patterns are made explicit: “Wake up/Repeat again/Again.” Owens writes with clarity and simplicity, using her own voice as something like a synthesizer, processing a phrase and then repeating it as she sings subtle variations in timbre and tone. Her lyrics are, in their own quiet way, a celebration of the pleasures of solitude and self-love. The unexpected opening track, a wordless cover of Radiohead’s “Weird Fishes/Arpeggi,” offers a sort of formal thesis statement. Owens’ interpretation emphasizes the Steve Reich-like qualities of Jonny Greenwood’s guitar line, stretching it into an undulating synthesizer pattern. Forgoing vocals, she distills the song’s harmonic essence, stripping it down to emphasize a single part of the whole, evoking a state of trance-like contemplation until a jittery breakbeat crashes through. The framework of Owens’ sound may be familiar now, but plenty still  surprises—particularly an appearance from fellow Welshman John Cale on “Corner of My Sky.” Like so many of her songs, the track swirls a handful of chilly synthesizers as it imperceptibly rises toward a fully embodied emotional climax that reaches for the sublime. Cale’s fragile, weathered voice lends a different texture from that of the album’s other tracks, though its underlying production is similar in tone. Toward the end of the song, Cale sings in Welsh, and it feels almost as if Owens is speaking through him to conjure the landscape of their homeland. Throughout, Cale’s words spin in mantra-like loops, becoming one with the programmed sounds that surround them. For Owens, loops—both electronic and lyrical—are a grounding presence, like a chant uttered in a meditative state: a simple phrase or pattern that functions as a conduit to another world. With Inner Song, Owens seeks to take the listener to a place of healing, finding solace in the shelter of a repeated chord progression.

S&M2,MetallicaSan Francisco Symphony,by: Andy Cush,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f469ea5a3044e1e655f14de/1:1/w_160/s&m2_metallica%20san%20francisco%20symphony.jpg,2020-09-01 05:00:00,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/metallica-san-francisco-symphony-sandm2/,Blackened,"For the first 11 minutes, Metallica’s S&M2 is almost completely indistinguishable from its predecessor. There’s the slow fade-in on the sound of applause and the ominous opening arpeggio of “The Ecstasy of Gold,” the soaring Ennio Morricone film cue that has opened Metallica concerts since 1983. Next, the furious instrumental “The Call of Ktulu,” with a string section whipping at the band like crosswinds battering a ship. You might check to make sure you didn’t load up the original S&M, a 1999 live album documenting a pair of collaborative concerts with the San Francisco Symphony, which opens with the same one-two punch. But you’ll be relieved to reach track three, a majestically blown-out rendition of the 1984 classic “For Whom The Bell Tolls”—not that it didn’t appear in essentially the same arrangement on S&M, but on that album it was track 14. So it goes with much of S&M2, recorded live with the San Francisco Symphony in September 2019. Of the 20 pieces of music here, more than half appeared in a similar form more than two decades ago on the first S&M. One of the new tracks consists of the orchestra playing a movement from Prokofiev’s “Scythian Suite”—introduced by SFS music director Michael Tilson Thomas earnestly explaining why the piece reminds him of heavy metal—without Metallica’s involvement at all. It is difficult to fathom for whom this album is an exciting prospect. In a different speech, also left on the record for no clear reason, drummer Lars Ulrich spends a minute and a half shouting out the members of the Metallica Club in attendance at the show (“I see our Polish friends over here…”), emphasizing the notion that this is for fans only. But any fan deep enough to be interested in S&M2 has surely heard S&M already. For attendees of the concerts themselves, who may have loved the original S&M, the setlist similarities were probably not a problem. But as a recorded statement, S&M2 is eerie, almost pathological in its attempts to recreate an album that was never a major entry in Metallica’s canon in the first place. If you’ve got a thing for self-punishment and too much time on your hands, listen to dueling versions of a particular song from the two albums and try to spot the differences. My favorite is “The Memory Remains”: same line of lyrics dropped for the crowd to fill in, same weird grunted backing vocals, different hilarious ad-lib from James Hetfield to introduce Kirk Hammett’s guitar solo: he used to say Ahhh, suck it!, and now he’s going with Misterrrrr Hammett! When the crowd sings the song’s central melody like a football chant over an extended orchestral outro, I wondered if they’re singing so confidently because they heard the crowd do the same thing on the first album. If these were 20 of the hardest-ripping Metallica performances ever put to tape, it wouldn’t matter so much that we’ve heard most of this stuff before. But that is not generally the case. The album suffers from the same primary problem that plagued the original S&M: Metallica’s best songs, intricate and ambitious though they may be, are not actually well suited for the additional orchestrating they get here, precisely because they are plenty symphonic already. When a guitar player like Kirk Hammett is shredding a multipart solo, you don’t want to hear a delicate countermelody in the second bassoons. The band, especially Ulrich, has occasional trouble keeping time with the orchestra, which is understandable. Reconciling a rock band’s internal timekeeping with an orchestra’s external conductor is probably difficult, but that doesn’t make it sound any smoother when Ulrich seems to change tempos every other measure on “The Day That Never Comes” and “Moth Into Flame,” two of the newer cuts included here. Hetfield makes the puzzling choice to deliver many lyrics with the arch theatricality of a carnival barker or Disney villain, heightening the sense that you are not hearing a rock concert, but a lousy production of Metallica: The Musical. The album’s greatest moment by far is “(Anesthesia) - Pulling Teeth,” a solo originally performed by founding Metallica bassist Cliff Burton, who died in a bus crash in 1986. On S&M2, it is performed on electric upright bass by Scott Pingel, the San Francisco Symphony’s principal bassist. To begin, he plays “Anesthesia” like the symphonic musician he is, bowing cleanly and gracefully, drawing out the bootleg-Baroque sensibility of Burton’s arpeggios. (If you weren’t paying close attention, you might think you were hearing a Bach cello suite.) Then, he kicks on distortion and wah-wah pedals, and begins digging into the strings like his life depends on it. Though it’s the sound of only one instrument, the rumble that ensues is somehow more immense than all the ensemble performances we’ve heard so far. It is a poignant tribute to Burton, but also a “classical” reimagining of Metallica’s music that goes beyond the most obvious possibilities of what such a fusion might mean. For a few minutes, S&M2 is as heavy as Kill ’Em All or Ride the Lightning. Then the band comes back in. Catch up every Saturday with 10 of our best-reviewed albums of the week.

Working across New York’s rap and experimental scenes, he’s collaborated with everyone from A$AP Rocky to Eartheater to Show Me the Body. In the process, Dadras has developed a unique and versatile sound of the  sort that can only be incubated in a place like New York City, blending house, hip-hop, and dancehall with a wide palette of samples. But his new album Holy Wind seems to unfold in a place far from the steel-and-concrete landscape that’s shaped his career. There’s a clear ecological theme running through the album, from the song titles to its  all-encompassing ambience. The elusive effects and samples Dadras uses sound like they could be field recordings or purely digital creations: flutes mix with high-pitched chirps, and kick drums blend with the creaking of trees. His compositional approach resembles an evolutionary process— on tracks like “Bird Strike” and “Eucalyptus,” he takes the sound of wildlife and organizes it into the rhythms of human life. Holy Wind isn’t strictly a dance record. The percussion is varied, and when Dadras slows down the tempo, his compositions mutate into darker and more haunting territory. The brightness of the album’s first half recedes into the foliage as you descend further into it; “Jungle Sweat” is a torrent of drones, rumbles, and wails over an almost-military drumline. The natural and the digital come together on tracks like “Labyrinth,” blending 808 cowbells and inscrutable vocal fragments. Electronic bleeps and bloops dissolve into the hum of nature. On “Pyrrhic,” a lower BPM, dancehall-like beat is paired with a clipped and compressed vocal sample, as cascading synthesizers roll in like the tide. “Sloth” and “Bird Strike” are experimental and strange, but sound much closer to hip-hop beats, evidence of Dadras’ fluidity and flexibility. There are occasionally clearer samples of the human voice — a segment of John Lurie’s surreal and underrated travel program Fishing With John on “Fishing,” a snatch of a Charlie Brown special on “Bottle Princess,” what sounds like a nature documentary on “For the Frogs.” But mostly Holy Wind is guided less by a human touch and more the world around it. Pulling from our recollections and imaginations of nature, Dadras is able to conjure a vivid environment that’s palpable and felt even inside city limits.

Giuseppe Ielasi, schooled in Derek Bailey and hardcore punk, started out as an improvising guitarist before moving into computer music, electroacoustic drones, and mischievous sampling. Nicola Ratti followed a similar path from guitar abstractions to minimalist electronics. The duo’s sound and methods have remained in flux from record to record. On Bellows’ 2007 debut, they piled soft, amorphous sounds, presumably of their own creation—glinting electric guitars, lopsided percussion, sourceless rustle and chirp—into unsteady heaps. On 2010’s murkier Handcut, they pioneered a twisted form of turntablism, applying contact mics directly to vinyl LPs, which destroyed the records’ grooves after a few rotations—a little like using a rusty scalpel as a musical instrument. But the loop has typically been Bellows’ principal unit of measurement, and on Undercurrent, their first release for Oren Ambarchi’s Black Truffle label, they deliver their most focused music yet. For a while, Bellows’ recordings were growing in complexity. But Undercurrent is marked by its simplicity. Elongated tones drip against a backdrop of silence and tape hiss; in place of melody, they might offer a silvery curlicue of tone. Occasional tape warble leaves their sounds curling up at the edges. The notes are less important than the way they seem to swoop up or down to the desired pitch. The music’s constituent parts are typically opaque. To create Undercurrent, Bellows recorded short instrumental parts on guitar, drums, and synthesizer, then cut them into tape loops to be played and manipulated in real time. The most hypnotic tracks, like “01” and “04,” evoke the slow rolling of waves at low tide, or ropes slapping against the masts of moored boats. Others are more harmonic: The placid “02” smears a single organ chord into an analog approximation of Oval’s glitch etudes, while in “05,” a buried humming sound recalls the modal groans of Georgian folk music. The pace is so slow, the form so repetitive, it’s easy to overlook the subtle ways these constructions shift as they wander. In “06,” two chords modulate back and forth, conveying a sense of resignation as they curl and crumple, like slumping shoulders. And in the closing “08,” the album’s quiet climax, a steel drum makes a plaintive creaking sound, like a rusty gate swinging on its hinges, while faint bursts of Morse-code bleeps telegraph news of an advancing storm. It’s a testament to Bellows’ sleight-of-hand that they can spin such spare materials and subtle movements into something that feels almost like storytelling.

Knot,Knot,by: Rob Arcand,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f45227171ec98137aecc378/1:1/w_160/knot_knot.jpg,2020-08-31 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/knot-knot/,Exploding in Sound,"Of the many Brooklyn DIY bands to fizzle out in the last decade, Krill left perhaps the biggest void. The Boston transplants brought a sprawling, wide-eyed mythology to their brand of grungy lo-fi power-pop, writing songs about tigers, twigs, and phantoms that were covert studies in phenomenological perception. Early recordings like “Self-Hate Will Be the Death of Youth Culture” almost anticipated their eventual breakup, with frontman Jonah Furman singing about his commitment to brevity and lightness in the face of punk-rock fatalism. Krill called it quits in 2015, with drummer Ian Becker pursuing a graduate degree in urban planning, guitarist Aaron Ratoff finding work with legal aid and tenants’ rights organizations, and Furman moving to Washington, D.C. as a labor organizer for the Bernie Sanders campaign. “When I was 20, I thought that making art was an important part of making a better world,” Furman recently told Fader. “[Now] I think there's more important things to be doing. Also, you get it out of your system.” Yet the band made the complicated decision to reunite under the name Knot, easing back into indie rock with a relatively unassuming collection of new tracks. Ostensibly picking up where Krill left off, Knot’s self-titled release marks a conscious departure from the racing, anthemic arrangements that defined their earlier material; here, they slow things down, emphasizing their weight. Where the tight guitar and basslines on Krill albums like Lucky Leaves and A Distant Fist Unclenching held close to a central lightness, Knot is defined by incongruence, with a rigid austerity that wouldn’t feel out of place on an early post-punk record. While some of this could be attributed to their changing lineup—Furman swaps his bass for rhythm guitar, Ratoff fills in on both guitar and bass, and newcomer Joe DeManuelle-Hall joins as second guitarist—the general effect is one of careful deliberation in place of what once seemed to come so naturally. Much of what made Krill great was bound up in their lyrics, and the new album returns to a similar headspace, looking to the natural world to explain their own psyches. “Foam” confronts the feeling of impending doom that can accompany even the smallest glimpse of sky or ocean at a time when rising temperatures threaten to destroy the planet, as Furman’s narrator struggles to speak to the people around him. Butting heads with his dad over their conflicting worldviews, he disputes the claim that people are inherently “evil motherfuckers,” only to end up doubting himself. “I believe in people’s power, but not at this late hour personally,” Furman sings with a bitterness unheard of in his former band. Furman has long been invested in questions of individual morality, and his latest songs train a clear-eyed gaze on the dark hearts of oppressors everywhere. Songs like “Justice” and “I Live in Fear” address the necessity of locating power within individual actors and institutions, even as it operates at a larger scale. “And if we take our boot off their neck, how much justice will they want?” he sings on the latter track, voicing the class anxieties of a gun-toting vigilante in a moment of crisis. Other songs, though, recognize that power lies with everyone, expressed through even the smallest gestures of solidarity. It’s easy to dismiss music with political aspirations as didactic, but Knot sidestep this characterization by focusing on the transformative potential of interpersonal struggle. Rather than rehash historical events or whine myopically about Trump, Furman remains committed to exploring the implicitly political aspects of everyday life, like taking care of a pet, or peeling an orange for your partner in the morning. This kind of political gesture is preceded by an orientation to the world that leaves space for compassion, and it’s here that the band returns with newfound depth. In a time of rapid change, sometimes the best you can do is keep moving. Catch up every Saturday with 10 of our best-reviewed albums of the week.

500-Push-Up,Vladislav DelaySly DunbarRobbie Shakespeare,by: Andy Beta,Contributor,"https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f468e91f95956f8a54c1f2d/1:1/w_160/500%20Push-Up_vladislav%20Delay,%20Sly%20Dunbar,%20&%20Robbie%20Shakespeare.jpg",2020-08-31 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/vladislav-delay-sly-dunbar-robbie-sh-500-push-up/,Sub Rosa,"When French provocateur Serge Gainsbourg decamped to Jamaica in 1978 to cut a reggae record, the befuddled rhythm section of drummer Sly Dunbar and bassist Robbie Shakespeare didn’t know quite what to do with the singer. “It was quite tense,” producer Philippe Lerichomme recalled in the Gainsbourg biography A Fistful of Gitanes. At least, it was until the two parties realized that the one French song all Jamaicans knew was Gainsbourg’s softcore classic, “Je T’Aime... Moi Non Plus,” kicking off a strange collaboration that lasted four years. In the decades since, Sly & Robbie have provided the bedrock to any number of distant visitors, from Grace Jones to Carly Simon, Joe Cocker to Bob Dylan. They first teamed up with Vladislav Delay (aka Finnish producer Sasu Ripatti) in Norway for 2018’s warped dub fusion album Nordub, alongside trumpeter Nils Petter Molvær and guitarist Eivind Aarset, and subsequently toured together. Whether or not they were familiar with Ripatti’s dubby body of work, they made fast friends. In January 2019, Ripatti decamped to Kingston to again work with the bass and drum legends, stripping things back to essentials to create 500-Push-Up. Working with little more than Sly & Robbie’s in-studio jamming, some overheard chatter, and atmospheric field recordings, Ripatti then took things back to his home studio on the tiny Finnish island of Hailuoto to refine further. On paper, it sounds tantalizing: dub techno’s smoggiest practitioner teaming up with as foundational a rhythm section as Jamaica (indeed, the world) has ever produced. But it never quite emulsifies. Neither side rests on their laurels, but they frustratingly stagnate somewhere in between their two signature styles, the rhythms not wholly entrancing, the haze not absolute. 500-Push-Up follows a basic—redundant, even—pattern: Let Sly & Robbie lay down an unchanging pulse while Ripatti conjures noisy frequencies around it. At a certain density, draw it all back down. Robbie’s bass gets noisy and gnarled on “(522),” but it’s irritating rather than visceral, like Delay’s bracing return Rakka was earlier this year. No matter the amount of clanging metal and electronic effects Ripatti triggers on “(521),” Sly’s drums stay locked down like a concrete foundation in a hurricane. Which should be a thrilling sound, only Ripatti does little to shape the track into coherence. The digital detritus Ripatti dumps atop “(514)” sounds like an entire video game arcade glitching, the noise growing denser as Sly & Robbie rumble somewhere underneath it. Ripatti draws on the austerity of classic dub productions by King Tubby and Keith Hudson, but he still manages to clutter up the dub, yielding undistinguished din. It takes nearly two minutes for “(513)” to get going, as studio chatter runs on and on (though there are some choice bits like “Sasu, you gonna get riddim confuse, bloodclot!”). A gluey white noise thickens around the elements to the point of opacity, sirens arising and metal gnashing somewhere in the smog, with Robbie’s migraine throb carrying on through it all. At the most intriguing moments, they strike a balance. On “(520),” Sly & Robbie yet again lock into some distorted, snake-charming low end while Ripatti conjures a UFO’s whirring, the whole thing churning and thickening into a haze. It makes you wish for the immersive depths that made Entain, Multila, and Anima such brain-erasing explorations. Messy but not mysterious, lackadaisical rather than spacey, 500-Push-Up never quite plays to its parties’ obvious strengths. Catch up every Saturday with 10 of our best-reviewed albums of the week.

Pussy Cats,Harry Nilsson,by: Jayson Greene,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f46803fa3044e1e655f14a6/1:1/w_160/pussy%20cast_harry%20nilsson.jpg,2020-08-30 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/harry-nilsson-pussy-cats/,RCA Victor,"If people know of Pussy Cats, they know at least two things: That Harry Nilsson shouted his voice so hoarse that blood hit the microphone, effectively destroying his golden, three-and-a-half octave range forever. And that it was produced by John Lennon during his so-called “Lost Weekend,” the 18-month stretch from 1973 to 1975 in which Lennon and Yoko Ono briefly separated and he disappeared into drugs and drink. To listen to Pussy Cats, it’s long been assumed, is to get a peek into the broader Lost Weekend of the early ’70s—how it felt, how it sounded. This was the blowsy era, immediately post-Beatles, when rock stars could get away with recruiting four or five of the usual suspects (here, it was Keith Moon, Ringo Starr, and session guys like Jim Keltner and Klaus Voormann), bang out a few Bob Dylan covers, and call it an album. It was an era when all the hippie icons were lousing around the Playboy Mansion, when the euphoria of the late ’60s had petered out but all the main players were still onstage. This was the time in which Lennon allegedly punched a waitress while being ejected from a Smothers Brothers gig, his famous spectacles tossed aside in the scuffle. Reading about this era is funny until it’s depressing. Hearing Lennon talk about the beach house where he, Nilsson, Ringo, and others partied until they were sick every night instead of making Pussy Cats is deflating, as is Lennon’s revelation that “One day I realize, Jesus, I’m the producer, one day they’re going to be asking me where the tapes are.” Stories like these, lapped up by periodicals and repeated in interviews, defined and calcified what “rock star excess” looked like, and Nilsson was there for nearly all of it. If any one person could embody the notion of late-’60s rock stars going to seed, that person would undoubtedly be Harry Nilsson—one of the most talented songwriters of his generation, feted by all four Beatles, bedecked with Grammys, scoring hits while seemingly not even trying, squandering studio budgets and burning bridges while carousing with anyone who would join him. Nilsson was present for the only known post-Beatles reunion of Lennon and Paul McCartney—Stevie Wonder was also there. Mythical, and yet the result was atrocious. The name of the bootleg (“A Toot and a Snore in ’74”) came from cocaine, and it sounds that way. Wherever a famous ’60s icon was debasing themselves, Nilsson was there, supplying the drinks and collecting the stories. In 1974, the golden aura from 1971’s triumphant Nilsson Schmilsson had dimmed, but not yet faded away—he was known as a troubled, troublesome guy, but generally worth the effort, a risky investment that could still pay dividends. Pussy Cats is considered the moment he leaped over the brink, a sort of album-length Leaving Las Vegas in which a would-be titan consigned himself to a tragic cult figure. For many Nilsson fans, it is too painful and disheartening to listen to. But this strange and seemingly radioactive album has persisted in the cultural imagination as more than just a cautionary tale. Nilsson himself denigrated the original material he brought to the Pussy Cats sessions—“Most of those songs will be originals, even though I don’t like my songs very much right now,” he told NME in 1973. “Still, we’ll do them anyway because I haven’t got anything else to record.” He was a little too hard on his own work, because there are at least three classic Nilsson songs to be found on Pussy Cats: “Don’t Forget Me,” “All My Life,” and “Old Forgotten Soldier.” “Don’t Forget Me,” in particular, is one of those moonlit reveries that Nilsson picked like bits of food from his scraggly beard; it’s a wry, pickled, devastatingly sad song that many artists have reached for in the ensuing decades, from Macy Gray to Neko Case to Fleet Foxes’ Robin Pecknold to Marianne Faithfull to Joe Cocker. It’s part of the American songbook now, and it slunk into the world on the flea-bitten back of Pussy Cats. The most infamous song on the album is the first one—a cover of Jimmy Cliff’s “Many Rivers to Cross.” In popular Nilsson lore, this was the song, the one that did it, the moment when Nilsson, aware that he was developing a node on his throat, simply screamed through it. It’s accumulated a reputation as a sort of aural suicide note, an act of self-immolation—but it’s also a tremendously powerful performance, and one of the most indelible tracks Lennon ever worked on as a producer. The arrangement for “Many Rivers to Cross” is so slow that the song seems on the verge of simply stalling out, the drummer wandering away or the guitarist setting down his instrument to get a glass of water. It’s unnervingly slow, and heard today, it reminds me faintly of the codeine-glazed gravitational pull of screw music. At the time, it recalled the hymn-like feel of Lennon’s recent solo work, particularly Mind Games, released the previous year. Apart from the tabloid exploits and benders, this was also a particularly introspective moment in Lennon’s life, one in which he reconnected with his son Julian, reconciled with the other Beatles, and formally dissolved the group. He might have been flailing, but he was also searching. In his music at the time, it sometimes seemed like he was slowing down his songs until he could unearth the secret message his subconscious had buried there. This was the same stately pace of “Many Rivers to Cross,” and Nilsson’s vocal take is so evocative of Lennon that Nilsson-heads still bicker over whether and where Lennon is singing backup. But Nilsson wasn’t channeling the bright, boyish tenor of “Strawberry Fields Forever” or “A Hard Day’s Night.” This was therapy Lennon, primal-scream Lennon, the one you can watch cowing an audience into frightened silence performing “Mother” and screaming all the way inside himself. On “Many Rivers,” Nilsson puts himself inside the space, and in his guttural screams, you can hear, among other things, the sound of one man trying to inhabit the voice and cultural footprint of his idol. The relationship between Nilsson and Lennon is one of the many sad subtexts of Pussy Cats—it was Lennon who uttered the famous “Nilsson is my favorite group” line in a 1968 press conference, and Nilsson waited years for the opportunity to work with him. Where some chalk up Nilsson’s hemorrhaging vocal cords on Pussy Cats—and his failure to halt the sessions and deal with this problem—to self-destructiveness, Nilsson confessed to something more tender and timid: “I was afraid that if he stopped it, we wouldn’t do it again, we wouldn’t finish it. So I just said nothing.” Viewed this way, his screaming isn’t an act of self-destruction; he is giving everything he has to impress his hero. Lennon, for his part, had just walked away from a warlike session with Phil Spector trying to record his oldies album Rock ’N’ Roll—pistols were pulled, and things had gotten dicey and unstable in the particular way of Spector recording sessions. It was in the midst of this hellish scene that Lennon announced his intention to walk away and produce Nilsson. The sound that Lennon sought on “Many Rivers” was oddly similar to Spector’s Wall of Sound, but through Lennon’s ear, the Wall of Sound was crumbling—the drum hits felt like debris hitting the floor. Their cover of the Drifters’ “Save the Last Dance for Me” carries the same solemnity. Reverb and echo soak into every crack, making the song feel inescapable, pressing down like a heavy blanket or ambient anxiety. The pace was, again, glacial; the mood, again, devotional. Nilsson’s voice may have been disappearing as the tape rolled, but his tenderness wasn’t—he leans into every note, drawing it out as if the session’s end would take all life’s happiness with it. When you’re at last call, every song feels like a hymn. It’s impossible to discuss Pussy Cats without circling around the ruination of those vocal cords. Whatever others hear in these performances—poignance, pathos, or even evidence of a certain personal failing—I hear a peculiar bravery. Yes, Nilsson was in the process of losing his most prized possession, but he did nothing to hide or disguise the wreckage. His voice, in all its degradation, is as closely mic’d as it was on A Little Touch of Schmilsson in the Night, his album of songbook standards from just a year earlier when his voice was in its prime. His vocals on “Old Forgotten Soldier” are hollowed-out, whispery, and you can hear air whistle out of his throat without producing so much as a squeak. But Nilsson leans forward, steps into the light. He lets you see and hear all of him. He was a studio musician, after all, so petrified of performing that he gave no concerts. Whatever secrets he divulged about his soul he left on tape. The low points on Pussy Cats are harder to dignify. Nilsson’s cover of Johnny Thunder’s “Loop De Loop” is about as appealing as a smoker’s cough, transparently awful and without purpose. It reminds me of an A-student filling in one straight column of bubbles on a test and turning it in with a shit-eating grin. The “Rock Around the Clock” cover is another embarrassment, an all-star band featuring Ringo Starr and Keith Moon unable to keep it together and reverting to middle-school levels of competency. It’s the sort of misfire that has earned Pussy Cats its lamentable reputation, and the reason it can never entirely transcend it. But everything that makes it seem lamentable is also the source of its power. The cover of Dylan’s “Subterranean Homesick Blues,” conversely, is loud and clattering. You can picture the blood draining from the face of the label exec listening to it on playback, calculating royalty payments and revenue loss, just as you can imagine Lennon and Nilsson sniggering to each other over the mixing board. But there is also a deranged urgency to the playing; it catches an edge. Listen to the drums; that’s Ringo Starr playing alongside Jim Keltner. Has Ringo Starr ever drummed so hard? Whatever was driving him—creative urgency, cocaine, a simple panicked desire to not lose the beat—the result is a moment of delirium captured at the back of the song. It’s good chaos, a productive mess. After Pussy Cats, Nilsson’s life and career slid into denouement. He was finished as a recording artist by 1980 and entered a quieter phase of life, marked by relative sobriety and stability. He made music for movies and more or less disappeared from the public until his death in 1994. In some ways, Pussy Cats was the final statement from Nilsson when he was still in the thick of it, still the amiable-genius drinking buddy of every rock star. Picture-book drunkards like Nilsson live their lives in cheerful, elegant gestures of failure and small, pained declarations of success. Pussy Cats contained a little of both.

Papi Juancho,Maluma,by: Matthew Ismael Ruiz,"Associate Staff Writer, News",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f4524608ae6324b59c6a45a/1:1/w_160/Papi%20Juancho_maluma.jpg,2020-08-29 05:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/maluma-papi-juancho/,Sony Music Latin,"Can you really be macho if your best work comes from other women? Such is the quandary with Colombia’s Maluma. The music of the 26-year-old pop star—born Juan Luis Londoño Arias—has long been defined by a latent machismo. But other than a brief moment where online petitions sprung up in protest of his song “Cuatro Babys”—which one Spanish municipality deemed “an apologia for violence against women”—his biggest moments have been with older, more established women. He first dipped his toe into the mainstream with his fellow Colombian Shakira on their duet “Chantaje,” cracking Billboard’s Hot 100, and then again on Madonna’s ode to his hometown “Medellín” managing to out-sexy the veteran culture vulture with a sultry croon. And when he makes his debut on the silver screen in the forthcoming feature “Marry Me,” it will be at the behest of Jennifer Lopez. But women artists are conspicuously absent from his latest album Papi Juancho, relegated to the familiar reggaetón roles of emotional foils, signifiers of material wealth, and sex objects. Maluma says the character is an alter ego, lonely horny quarantine sessions while hiding out from the pandemic. But it’s par for the course for the music he’s made throughout his career; after toning down the raunch for his last and most successful album to date, 11:11, he’s digressed to his tried and true lothario persona. And it mostly works, depending on your perspective. Much of Maluma’s schtick feels prefabricated, the kind of reggaetonero you’d expect to find on a mood board for a fashion campaign. The warm and bright melodies are aesthetically pleasing but hollow. It goes beyond the Calvin Klein campaigns and Miami Vice neon visuals. In a genre where literally every song has the same beat, his music struggles to distinguish him from his peers, his sound lost in a wash of inoffensive pastels and vague tropical motifs. Even his overt attempts to add his own spin to classic sounds provide mixed results. Album opener “Medallo City” stands out lyrically for the slang local to Envigado, his neighborhood in Medellín, and recruits local rapper Teo Grajales. But the hip-hop beat’s attempt to work in some salsa rhythms get lost in the sauce, any unique character Grajales might have brought seems to have been buffed out by the time it made it onto the record. To his credit, Maluma acknowledges his debts to Puerto Rican forebears—upon whose work Colombia’s entire reggaetón scene is built—a welcome nod to the sonic ancestors that we’ve seen recently from the likes of Bad Bunny and even Romeo Santos. Recorded mostly during the COVID-imposed lockdown with his longtime producer collaborators and co-writers The Rude Boyz (Kevin ADG and Chan “El Genio”), Papi Juancho features guest appearances from OGs Jory Boy, Ñejo y Dálmata, Ñengo Flow, Randy, and Yomo, but the production is so tepid you might not even notice. The album’s highlight “ADMV” is also its most familiar, released months earlier as a single. An acoustic ballad to growing old with the love of your life (“Amor de mi vida”), its earnestness overcomes the slight hint of cheese. It’s one of the few moments on Papi Juancho that feels honest and genuine.
But for the most part, Papi Juancho is neither exceptionally good or remarkably awful. Despite its considerable bloat, none of its 22 tracks demand a skip, even if few moments particularly stand out. It emits a vibe similar to an algorithmically programmed Spotify station, an amalgamation of every popular reggaetón beat that sounds like everything and nothing all at once.

Mi specchio e rifletto,Silvia Tarozzi,by: Allison Hussey,"Associate Staff Writer, News",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f4534168ae6324b59c6a45c/1:1/w_160/Mi%20specchio%20e%20rifletto_Silvia%20Tarozzi.jpg,2020-08-29 05:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/silvia-tarozzi-mi-specchio-e-rifletto/,Unseen Worlds,"For those less inclined toward astrology, celebrity birthdays can be a shortcut to understanding one’s arrival on the cosmic scene. It’s an amusing, low-stakes thought exercise: What traits do you share with a more minor kind of star? The free-improvising violinist Silvia Tarozzi found such a kinship with a fellow Italian, celebrated Milanese poet Alda Merini, who shares a March 21 birthday with the Bologna musician. Over the course of a decade, Tarozzi used the natural rhythms of Merini’s poetry as scaffolding for her works-in-progress, and those pieces became her new album, Mi specchio e rifletto (I mirror and reflect). Her careful assemblage is a nuanced investigation of the divine feminine, refracting the quotidian weight of womanhood through an improvisor’s prism. The album’s coruscating title track builds a clever infinite-mirror illusion, scalloping Tarozzi’s voice as she names the facial features in her reflection. Her overlapping vocal rounds deliver the upside-down feeling of trying to square one’s own self-perception with that of the outside world. And in vocalizing what she sees in the mirror, Tarozzi makes herself more visible. The theme carries throughout the record as she shifts between diaphanous contemporary-classical flutters and murky synth gnarls, illuminating the complex emotional specifics of motherhood and life as a working musician. Tarozzi deploys familiar gestures of femininity and gradually peels them apart to reveal internal tumult. Though she counts Deep Listening oracle Pauline Oliveros as one of her most influential mentors, her own approach prioritizes a busier array of textures applied across shorter, self-contained compositions. She begins the album with “Al cancello,” a brisk instrumental that she leads with cheerful violin as flute and piccolo sparkle around slow, curving cello parts. On “La forza del canto,” a plucked violin over downcast strings introduces a sense of anxiety, and “La sostanza dell’affetto” dives in deeper, sliding away on a tail of elastic guitars that melt over one another like popsicles in summer heat. “Domina” introduces more tension, building friction between multiple layers of synths and processed vocals as Tarozzi repeatedly warns, “Smettila di ascoltarli/Ti sfrutteranno”: “Stop listening to them/They will exploit you.” Nodding to their shared birthday, “La forza del canto” is Tarozzi’s most direct tribute to Merini, and she presses her voice upward on the song’s wide-open refrain. It’s wind in sails; it sounds like trying, a daring tribute to women who choose a public life. Merini, who died in 2009, was lauded in her home country for her insight on love, religion, heartbreak, eroticism, and suffering. She spent much of her adult life institutionalized and separated from her children, an experience she detailed in her 1989 memoir A Rage of Love. The sweeping romantic ache of her work—little of which has received English translation—echoes out of the chasm between her full, deep sense of self and others’ refusal to acknowledge it. Tarozzi built her compositions around the rhythmic structure of Merini’s verse, but copyright issues meant that she eventually had to complete the pieces with her own lyrics. Her words explore specific minutiae that bring her fulfillment: a gentle light splashing over violets, a spider’s taut silk, the generous sense of wonder in the eyes of a loved one. On 2015’s Apocalypse, girl, Jenny Hval asked, “What is it to take care of yourself? What are we taking care of?” With Mi specchio e rifletto, Tarozzi addresses the subtleties of those questions. She writes in her liner notes that her compositions were influenced by “the psychedelic experience of pregnancy,” which manifests in the offset saxophone flares of “Sembra neve” and the synthetic mechanical fizz of “...e non volevi le ali.” Joni Mitchell once said she used suspended chords to express unresolved questions about the outcome of her own life, and Tarozzi’s wavering loose ends on “Domina” and “Hai nella bocca un silenzio” relay a similar overwhelmed uncertainty. With the album’s closing number, “xxx Anna,” Tarozzi offers a touching, if unorthodox, love note to her grandmother. By resurrecting and collaging fragments from earlier in the album, she seeks to approximate the internal state of her grandmother’s mind as she grappled with dementia. After familiar excerpts meet a chaotic crescendo, the piece concludes with a warm sense of calm. Like “Al balcone,” which nods to a tradition of elderly Italians holding court on their balconies, “xxx Anna” is an empathetic appreciation of her foremothers. By connecting her own ancestry with Merini’s influence, Tarozzi speaks to a larger, often invisible web of women and the shared experiences of their private lives. The date that first bound Tarozzi to Merini traditionally falls around the vernal equinox, the annual starting pistol for renewed growth and abundance. Though the women were separated by time, Mi specchio e rifletto is the bountiful garden of their meeting. Like Merini and so many others, Silvia Tarozzi wants to be seen as her full self. She paints private worlds, illustrating labyrinthine feelings in new colors. And by rendering her own reflection more brilliant, Tarozzi makes it easier for others to see themselves, too.

Smile,Katy Perry,by: Dani Blum ,Contributor ,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f4538cb53ee9f48ccacc737/1:1/w_160/smile_katy%20perry.jpg,2020-08-28 05:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/katy-perry-smile/,Capitol,"Between rows of Spandex at Forever 21, in the back of a cab coming home from the bar, after losing your headphones at the gym—in a pandemic, all the ideal templates for listening to Katy Perry have disappeared. No more can the pop star’s songs seep into the background of a normal social life, clunking around in your head before you even know their titles; you have to actively opt into her new album and launch yourself willingly into its suffocating glitz. Smile is meant to be a “picture of RESILIENCE & GRATITUDE,” Perry writes in the liner notes. Those capital letters—the sense that someone is shouting at you—come through in the music. “Yeah, I’m thankful/Scratch that, baby, I’m graaateful,” she croons in the title song. “I am resilient!” she belts on another, six times in two minutes. “It’s not the end of the world!” she promises over a flailing disco beat, before launching into a pseudo-rap about a fortune teller and “flipping off the flop,” whatever that means. These songs wink at global devastation the same way commercials for online car dealerships and door-delivered Chick-fil-A do—in these challenging times, convenience and the power of positivity will get us through. Pop music, and Katy Perry in particular, have used this tactic before. “Put your rose-colored glasses on, and party on,” she cooed on 2017’s Witness, an album of what she called “purposeful pop,” designed to yank the listener into a newfound social consciousness. She performed the lead single at the Grammys wearing a pink rhinestone PERSIST armband as an image of the Constitution rose behind her. She jammed the album with whomping bass and assertions that a woman could be both “feminine and soft,” “a babydoll with a briefcase,” and promoted it with a 72-hour livestream, therapy session and all, staking her activism on the idea that all vulnerability is radical. In one clip, she sat cross-legged on an immaculate white couch and apologized for her history of cultural appropriation. The camera panned to a flickering display of the album cover. “I’ll never understand, because of who I am,” she murmured. We were meant to connect the dots between parceled honesty and political stances, between an oddball “diss track” against Taylor Swift and a broad stance on female empowerment. Smile asks less of us. The confessions on this album feel like calculated dodges, every tepid disclosure immediately followed by triumph. “They tell me that I’m crazy, but I’ll never let them change me!” she sing-shouts on “Daisies,” as limp EDM beats fill the background. The relentless spangle on Smile can seem jarring as Perry attempts to both nod to and avoid the pandemic-shaped elephant in the room. “It’s no funeral we’re attending,” she scoffs on “Not the End of the World.” There’s a song about postponing crying to go out and dance; there’s a separate track about dancing while crying. These are big-production tracks primed for maximum drama—shrieking electro violins, skittering beats, flecks of dubstep and disco—but the clumsy lyrics hamper any emotional payoff. Clichés are practically baked into Perry’s brand, but when she deploys them as cutesy callbacks to her past songs, they present more evidence that she hasn’t really grown. “Have you ever lost, lost the light in your life?” she asks over “Teary Eyes”’s twinkling opening chords, a dumbed-down take on her infamous, “Do you ever feel like a plastic bag.” “Took those sticks and stones, showed ’em I could build a house,” she sings on “Daisies,” echoing the chorus of her 2012 hit “Part of Me.” The production strips down on “What Makes a Woman,” with soft electric guitar and light organ notes, but the lyrics feel snatched from the Witness era. “Could spend your whole life but you couldn’t/Describe what makes a woman, and that’s what makes a woman to me,” she croons in the chorus, an update but not necessarily an improvement on One Direction’s “You don’t know you’re beautiful/That’s what makes you beautiful.” Despite all her garbled platitudes, she remains a master at executing proven chart-topping formulas. The Charlie Puth co-write “Harleys in Hawaii” is standard, breezy pop: a gently writhing beat, the word “baby” breathed over synths, vowels contorted so that “hula” rhymes with “jeweler.” “Tucked” is an understated highlight, a bass-blasted track about summoning the memory of a lover whenever she wants. Katy Perry has always excelled at packaging small moments of intimacy; it’s what animates the fleeting moments of post-party panic in hits like “Last Friday Night” and makes “Teenage Dream” one of the best songs of the last decade. And then there’s “Never Really Over,” which accomplishes maybe what Perry wanted for the whole album: the glistening machinery of a big-budget pop song, calibrated for catharsis. Zedd’s production sounds a whole lot like “Closer”-era Chainsmokers, but his titanic drumlines build toward release as Perry hurls confessions over blooming synths. “Thought we kissed goodbye/Thought we meant this time was the last,” she sings, an ode to a relationship that refuses to wither. This is the version of Katy Perry pop can hold space for—one where her packaged self-probing leads somewhere and amounts to something. In spite of, or maybe because of, her promotional spectacles—Left Shark, the whipped cream bra, teasing her baby’s name with a single release—she’s long been able to comfortably assume legions of people will listen to her music, without even asking themselves why.

Crabs in a Bucket,Nines,by: Will Pritchard,Contributor ,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f469592f95956f8a54c1f2f/1:1/w_160/crabs%20in%20a%20bucket_nines.jpg,2020-08-28 05:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/nines-crabs-in-a-bucket/,Warner,"On Christmas Eve 2011, UK road rapper Nines uploaded an 8-minute video to accompany his new song “My Hood”—a standout from his From Church Road To Hollywood mixtape. In the video, he hands out Christmas turkeys to needy members of his community in North West London. The track itself is a lyrical collage, as he runs through shout-outs and namechecks for his friends. Almost 10 years on, Nines has signed to a major label and his third studio album features a track called “Monsters.” Here, the namechecks come for his peers in the UK’s blossoming rap scene. “The fame ain’t changed me/I’m still the same, I just live in the suburbs next to AJ Tracey,” he spits, “Or I’m overseas ’cause the ends is dead.” It’s not clear whether he’s trying to convince himself or his listeners. The song’s second half returns to familiar subjects—flipping weed, making money, and the Church Road housing estate that raised him—and becomes a microcosm of Crabs in a Bucket. As a street documentarian, Nines’ authenticity is both his yardstick and his biggest source of inspiration: Can he hold onto it even as he leaves his old life behind? This conflict sits at the heart of the album, and is one Nines has documented throughout his career: He titled a 2015 mixtape One Foot In, while his debut studio album was called One Foot Out. With Crabs in a Bucket, Nines claims he’s moving on, all the way out—escaping the people and behaviors set on dragging him down. His last two albums broke new ground for UK rap, both entering the top five in the UK album charts. But his retreat to the same old tropes and tribulations suggest street life will always have a pull on him. “I ain’t a rapper, I’m a drug dealer that raps,” he goes on “NIC.” It’s a mantra that appears throughout, and a personal mythology evoked in his series of comic short-films that depict a semi-fictionalized account of his drug-dealing come-up. “Intro” lays the dilemma out with rare vulnerability. Nines opens up about his father’s cancer diagnosis, a knife attack that left his face badly scarred, and paranoia about street surveillance, before submitting himself to the pressures of his environment: “I guess the hood got me institutionalized.” Where the same internal wrestling played out 2018’s Crop Circle with some levity, here it weighs heavier. The album isn’t entirely devoid of light relief, and Nines’ characteristic wit still sparkles in punchlines like “Fuck a middleman, I even get my water from the spring,” on “Lights.” The production remains laid-back and luxurious too, more suited to road trips in the high-end cars that pepper his lyrics than the live stages he rarely graces. Despite signing with Warner, Nines forgoes the draw of the major label contact book for the most part—choosing instead to pull in features from those who deserve some shine. “All Stars 2,” a follow-up from its namesake on One Foot In, pushes up-and-comers Frosty, Clavish, Q2T, and Chappo CSB into the limelight to piercing, edgy effect; long-time sparring partner Skrapz adds a swift dose of street wisdom on “Energy;” Tiggs Da Author contributes a soulful flourish to “NIC.” Elsewhere, UK drill’s crown prince Headie One glides effortlessly on “Ringaling,” while Afrobeats boyband NSG prove the exception to the rule on playlist bait “Airplane Mode.” The rare confessional glimpses on tracks like “Intro” and “Energy” are what sets this album apart from Nines’ previous releases. But when he raps on the former “This shit got my blood pressure high/I just wanna be free like some doves in the sky,” he could equally be talking about the new demands of his music career as the stresses of street life. He sounds most free when he’s spitting thin gruel about weed, money, and blowjobs on the swaggering “Clout.” As he pulls himself from the bucket, he’ll need to decide which crabs to fling back into the brine behind him.

Shabrang,Sevdaliza,by: Colin Lodewick,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f46748da3044e1e655f14a4/1:1/w_160/shabrang_sevdalia.jpg,2020-08-28 05:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/sevdaliza-shabrang/,Twisted Elegance,"Sevdaliza approaches her sophomore album Shabrang like a lounge singer fresh off a marathon reading of Paradise Lost, the complexities of a fallen state of grace heavy on her mind. The record’s title comes from a mythical Persian horse, Shabrang Behzād, the “night-colored purebred” of the hero Siyâvash, and its project is in part a reflex to the impossibility of translation. To demonstrate the depth of meaning contained in the Farsi phrase “shabrang,” Sevdaliza names as many shades of night that she can. What results is a work of emotional maximalism, an album that grades exclusively from dark to darker through parable-like songs populated with devils and tangerine-selling women, whose opening word “evil” proves to be not only a condemnation but the concept at its heart. As with her 2018 debut Ison and her most recent EP The Calling, Sevdaliza co-produced Shabrang with Netherlands-based Mucky and enlisted Mihai Puscoiu to construct the album’s spine of film noir strings. The album maintains the spare economy of its predecessors. Apart from the strings (a dulcimer melody on opener “Joanna” starts the album off on an epic course), each track consists mostly of music box piano riffs, gothic synths, and the rogue leaden beat. Trip-hop, the label used to classify her music in the past, feels less than helpful now. The straightforward Farsi ballad “Gole Bi Goldoon,” apocalyptic club track “Darkest Hour,” and cyborgian grunge “Rhode,” all linked by Sevdaliza’s dextrous voice, feel essential over the course of the record. Her carnivorous approach bears resemblance to that of another album based around the concept of darkness: Grimes’ Miss Anthropocene, whose songs were held together less by genre than the strength of a singular creative vision. Shabrang’s fifteen tracks are preoccupied with emotional extremes and the prospect of self-understanding gained through testing those extremes, territory not new to Sevdaliza’s writing. The possibilities and limitations of self-construction loosely framed Ison. On “Human,” she dissected herself over little more than a skittish beat, turning her humanity into a list of essential parts: skin, bones, veins, sweat, scars, and soul. On Shabrang, Sevdaliza aims to identify exactly where she ends and everything else begins; to do so, she refracts herself through pain like white light through quartz, separating out knots of dependency and power. Despite its runtime of over an hour, the album feels lithe in a way Ison does not. Seductive evil requires an opposite state like purity or goodness, a definite binary suggested in the pleading “Joanna.” But Sevdaliza quickly proves herself more interested in the inseparability of evil from good. On the title track, she allows herself the melodrama of divinity to speak to someone who’s harmed her: “I refer to you as my holy suffering.” Throughout the album, love and hate are one, with pain showing itself to be preordained and innocence shading quickly into culpability. Sevdaliza’s incisive use of Auto-Tune helps her straddle those emotional and moral divides. On “Habibi” (the Arabic word for “my love”), she achieves a startling bleakness by warping the question “is there anyone out there to get me out of my head?”; this skillful manipulation transforms a request into a moment of surrender and makes the song’s sampled crack of thunder seem understated. Even the album’s lightest moments position themselves as opportunities for existential meditation. “All Rivers At Once” is a song like a slow walk, underpinned by reverbed acoustic guitar. A mundane image of romance beside a river expands into an address to “children of the light” and the desperate refrain “I don’t want to feel pain” over rolling drums and probing synths. At its best, Sevdaliza’s all-in commitment to philosophical musing lends a parable-like quality to her writing, with essential questions of being and form couched in spare images. Other tracks, like “Wallflower,” with its spoken word chorus about whispered melodies and the promise that “all is meant to be,” don’t quite escape the feeling of smoked-out corniness. The racing “Eden” folds Sevdaliza’s interest in subjugation as it relates to self-formation into one phrase. “I want to be your secret, or at least its keeper,” she sings, then repeats herself, replacing the central word pairing each time. Secret and keeper become pearl and shell, army and trojan horse, well and source, muse and mistress, bible and witness. Selfhood, the song implies, is a process based at its core on capitulation, so long as it means getting closer to your object of desire. The song also holds one of the album’s most memorable hooks. “If I can’t be the song/At least have mercy/Let me hear her.” Self-referential, it refocuses Shabrang’s mission. The album is not solely about darkness, but also what we’re willing to give up trying to escape it. Catch up every Saturday with 10 of our best-reviewed albums of the week.

Primal Forms,ShackletonZimpel,by: Ray Philp,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f31686ccbe3572f6735f965/1:1/w_160/Primal%20Forms_Shackleton%20&%20Zimpel.jpg,2020-08-28 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/shackleton-zimpel-primal-forms/,Cosmo Rhythmatic,"The maverick composer and instrument builder Harry Partch once described his creative lodestar as “the actions and activities of primitive man as I imagine him.” Whether this impulse to flee modernity takes form in Constantin Brâncuși’s sculptures, Hilma af Klimt’s paintings, or Partch’s instruments, there will always be artists who seek inspiration on the shores of ancient custom and spiritual communion. Primal Forms, the new album by Sam Shackleton and Wacław Zimpel, is awash in this sensibility. The album’s folkish minimalism often recalls the so-called Fourth World of Jon Hassell, whose music David Toop called “almost psychotropic in its capacity to activate alien worlds in the imagination.” Shackleton casts a similarly hallucinogenic spell. Though the English artist was once associated with dubstep through his and Appleblim’s old Skull Disco label, his “ultimate destination” as an artist, as he told The Wire in 2010, was actually toward Partch—in short, a musical language he could call his own. On Primal Forms, Shackleton and Zimpel walk the path as though they’ve always known the way. Though Shackleton and Zimpel are serial collaborators, they both sound notably renewed on Primal Forms, their first recording together. Zimpel, a Polish jazz composer and clarinetist whose past work includes an EP with Border Community’s James Holden and two albums of Carnatic fusion, has brought a refreshing lightness to Shackleton’s music. Since 2016’s Devotional Songs, the pagan arcana of Shackleton’s music has often been given shape by singers and poets. But, whatever the quality of their contributions, the music’s atmosphere had grown thick with “gothic” imagery that felt, in Susan Sontag’s phrasing, constructed rather than secreted. Shackleton’s last album, 2017’s Anika-featuring Behind the Glass, could sometimes feel like what one Discogs commenter described as the soundtrack for a Victorian funeral, but here, Zimpel’s use of the Ukrainian lira, harmonium, violin, and other instruments suggestive of folk traditions add a celebratory force to the English artist's Escher-corridor minimalism. This all leads to an improbable thought: Zimpel has made the often dour Shackleton sound lovely. Once you’re past the title track’s chilly intro—its crime-noir strum might remind you of Portishead’s “Sour Times”—Zimpel’s alto clarinet and digi-choral swells add a penetrating warmth, as though the shade that Shackleton’s music usually inhabits has vanished beneath a second sun. The clarinet’s presence elsewhere sets in motion a passage of disembodying awe. Within a simple monochord loop four minutes through “Primal Drones,” Zimpel’s reed undulates with a conversational sonority—as though, if only you could tune to the proper frequency, it might be possible to make out a centuries-old haiku. Though Primal Forms has lots of trance-inducing intensity—see the Terry Riley-esque organ spirals towards the back of “Primal Forms”—the transitory moments are a pleasure, too. The midsection of the final track, “Ruined Future,” is a longish changeover from Zimpel’s thinning clarinet to rolling marimba triplets. In taking its time to get from A to B, Shackleton and Zimpel show the confidence to let nothing much happen for a while. Perhaps by this point the duo’s destination, a prelapsarian place of mystical sound and ritual beauty akin to the one Partch longed to discover, is already in sight. If so, the duo found it not by following a map but by awakening neglected instincts in each other. Catch up every Saturday with 10 of our best-reviewed albums of the week.

King’s Disease,Nas,by: Pete Tosiello,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f451c7571ec98137aecc342/1:1/w_160/king's%20disease_nas.jpg,2020-08-27 05:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/nas-kings-disease/,Mass Appeal,"By all measures, the rollout of 2018’s NASIR, the fourth project of Kanye West’s chaotic Wyoming summer, was a mess. Marred by Nas’ lazy flows and conspiracy theories, the album also arrived under the troubling cloud of domestic abuse allegations from his ex-wife Kelis. Nas’ 13th album, King’s Disease, seeks a return to the cozy wistfulness of 2012’s Life Is Good, a late-career opus which toured ’80s stash spots and triumphant nights at the Apollo while ostensibly interrogating the dissolution of his marriage. The new album marks a retreat into a nostalgia-act comfort zone—one which suits Nas, even as it yields diminishing returns. There’s desperation in the way Nas endlessly plumbs the scenes of his adolescence, like a red-eyed wedding guest clutching your shoulder three hours into the reception and pleading, “Remember?” This is the rapper who cruised “Memory Lane” at 20, who at 28 excoriated peers unable to leave behind the emotional confines of their Queensbridge childhood. Yet by his late thirties, Nas had become so convinced of the importance of those years—the sanctity of Cold Crush park jams, the unforgettable eyelashes on that girl down Vernon Boulevard—and, in an odd display of humility, less concerned with his own place in them. On “Car #85,” a summertime ride through Koch-era New York, Charlie Wilson’s background vocals lend period-specific authenticity to Nas’ vivid memories of “White Castles at midnight, fish sandwiches, forty-ounces and fistfights.” In middle age, he’s a full-on evangelist for the lost city of his youth, and for the days just before Illmatic changed everything. By now groaning about Nas’ beat selection is the rap-fan equivalent of complaining about the weather, but Southern California native Hit-Boy, best known for his credits on “N****s in Paris” and “Backseat Freestyle,” acquits himself pretty well as the resident producer on King’s Disease. Despite the synthetic sheen of his single-tracked pianos, digitized snares, and clap drums, his beats are stately without defaulting into the prescriptive mood music Nas generally prefers. His audio templates have proven adaptable enough for the likes of Dom Kennedy and SOB X RBE; he evokes an easy brightness on the Anderson .Paak collaboration “All Bad” and the A$AP Ferg-featuring “Spicy.” Nothing jumps out as an anthem or single, and it’s hard to fathom which prospective consumer demos are mobilized by Big Sean and Lil Durk’s appearances. Just as relieving for those who suffered through NASIR’s arrhythmic vocals, the flow which seemed to abandon Nas after Life Is Good appears more or less restored on King’s Disease. Even in his heyday, Nas would never have been mistaken for the most musical MC, but his ability to ride a bassline conferred a smoothness to his hyper-literate bars; on NASIR, the looseness of Kanye’s capacious productions resulted in something akin to a poetry slam. Long gone are the nested, multisyllabic rhyme schemes of the Illmatic-to-Stillmatic arc, but Nas sounds positively energized on “Blue Benz,” rapping about Jersey City madams and excursions to the Tunnel with Chris Lighty. He delivers an inspired opening verse on “The Cure,” keeping time without a snare until the song’s second-act beat switch. Nas tends to falter when tackling capital-S Subjects (King’s Disease is blessedly devoid of any Plandemic speculation), and he’s better at coaxing pathos from characters he observes or creates than he is at autobiographical soul-searching, his stony affect strained by intimacy. King’s Disease unfolds with a thematic scope suitable for reminiscence and self-coronation, with a bit of the Marcus Garvey-inspired liberation theory he’s dabbled in since “If I Ruled the World.” In a few instances, the record manifests a vulnerability rare even in Nas’ most personal work, as on “Til the War Is Won,” when he curses God for taking his doting mother instead of his jazz-playing, jet-setting father. But where the song is on its surface a paean to single mothers, Nas’ bemoaning of broken families culminates in a mealy-mouthed admonishment: “Women, stop chasing your man away/Men, stop acting crazy, chasing your woman away.” King’s Disease makes overtures of applauding women in a manner that feels defensive in light of the 2018 allegations. Still evident is the backhanded slut-shaming so eagerly cribbed by J. Cole, the unwitting as-a-father-of-a-daughter misogyny of 2012’s “Daughters”: on “Car #85” Nas recalls chasing a teenage crush to Co-op City only to find 10 fellow suitors waiting outside her building. Both “Replace Me” and “All Bad” address nameless exes, vacillating between spite and remorse without enough nuance or transparency to disburse any appreciable insights. King’s Disease climaxes with “Full Circle,” which reunites The Firm’s 1996 lineup of Nas, AZ, Cormega, and Foxy Brown. In past Firm reunions, the reconvened members—titans of New York’s blockbuster era—looked back on their wild youths, warily contemplating their divergent paths. “Full Circle” is the closest they’ve come to an honest reckoning, each acknowledging missteps along the way. AZ, perpetually mid-champagne flute in toast to his impossible good fortune, admits to dishonesty in relationships: “The games that I was playin’ was silly/Similar to them days when I was packin’ that milly, it could’ve killed me.” Cormega, never one to forgive a slight or forget a grudge, rues his past control issues: “Thinking my girl was my possession—I stand corrected.” (It’s strange that Foxy Brown was conscripted for this exercise in male redemption, and her verse belongs on a different song altogether.) There’s a memorial air to the proceedings, running mates who’ve drifted to the suburbs and whose kids attend different schools.

Motherhood,No Joy,by: Evan Rytlewski,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f43dde466eb9e1caf9537ae/1:1/w_160/motherhood_no%20joy.jpg,2020-08-27 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/no-joy-motherhood/,Joyful Noise,"Perhaps it was inevitable that shoegaze would lose some of its capacity to awe over time. The genre’s disorienting squalls and nurturing fuzz create the impression of pulling beauty from murk, defying the sense that none of these noises should sound as alluring as they somehow do. It’s a powerful trick, or at least it used to be. But decades of repetition have proven there’s an almost innate property that makes the genre’s distorted guitars and vaporous synths work together so pleasurably, so even the most artful contemporary shoegaze rarely feels as daring as the genre’s heyday works. It’s akin to watching yet another magician submerge themselves in a water tank. Whatever appearance of risk the exercise once held is gone. All that speaks to how No Joy emerged as one of the most distinguished shoegaze acts of the last decade: They’re one of the few that dares to upend the genre’s fundamental alchemy. The Montreal band, once a quartet but now essentially a solo project for principal member Jasamine White-Gluz, has grown bolder about challenging genre conventions since their 2010 debut, most recently deemphasizing the guitar and dabbling in electronica on 2018’s No Joy / Sonic Boom, a collaboration with Spaceman 3’s Pete Kember. But on Motherhood, No Joy’s fearlessly creative, magnificently beat-heavy new record, the outside genre influences are even more radical and esoteric. White-Gluz spikes her dream-pop with trip-hop, nu metal, and a pastiche of time-stamped ’90s club music, from early ’90s U.K. dance-rock to the breakneck big beat of The Prodigy and The Chemical Brothers. The smeared vocals and synths still scan as shoegaze, but the rhythms are pure body music. That Motherhood somehow never crosses the line into overkill is remarkable, because sometimes it seems to be trying. To heighten the uncanniness of “Nothing Will Hurt,” a knotty tangle of synthesizers and slap bass with echoes of Luscious Jackson, White-Gluz and her collaborators shoved bananas into microphones and wedged kitchen knives into guitar necks. Much as musicians love to trade stories about them, these kinds of DIY studio hacks usually don’t make much difference, but here the cumulative effect lends to the sense of delirium. Even more audacious is the charcoal-blackened “Dream Rat,” which goes full thrash with a viciously growly assist from White-Gluz’s sister Alissa, the vocalist for the Swedish death metal outfit Arch Enemy. Another metal luminary, Kittie’s Tara McLeod, sits in on guitar for the whole album, and for added texture she plays a bit of banjo on several songs, too. Each song is a Chopped basket, a mish-mash of clashing ingredients that White-Gluz somehow makes work together, from the beat flips and DJ scratches of “Four” to the snapping snares and Siouxsie and the Banshees wails of “Ageless.” And, like the best Chopped chefs, she treats the Cap’n Crunch as reverentially as she does the wagyu. In the hands of a different artist, the album’s hard drum machines and amplified alterna-rock production might be played for kitsch, but White-Gluz never looks down at the sounds she borrows. As irreverent and inherently whimsical as the music often is, White-Gluz’s songwriting is dead serious. Her lyrics blur in and out of focus, but the audible ones touch on motherhood, bodily sacrifice, and fears of aging out of fertility. “Grateful for the family that loves me still, but I can’t seem to make my own,” she sings on the closer “Kidder.” That sincerity is the secret to why the album hangs together. While White-Gluz fucks around plenty on Motherhood, she’s never just fucking around. In her hands, eccentric genre cues become a means of making difficult subject matter go down easy. And in the process, she reclaims a very ’90s ideal: the belief that if you earnestly love music styles, however mismatched, they should pair together. It didn’t always work out that way in the ’90s, of course– no amount of good intentions was going to redeem some of those Big Audio Dynamite or Bran Van 3000 records—but here White-Gluz wills it so. In the process she’s achieved something remarkable: a shoegaze album with a rare scope and an even rarer sense of fun and imagination.

Well Groomed (Original Score),Dan Deacon,by: Marty Sartini Garner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f451a13094969ebce91b4e5/1:1/w_160/Well%20Groomed%20(Original%20Score)_dan%20deacon.jpg,2020-08-27 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/dan-deacon-well-groomed-original-score/,Domino,"If you were making a documentary about people who dye their dogs neon hues and trim their fur into the shape of the Cheshire Cat, Dan Deacon would be the first person you’d call for the score. Since his arrival with 2007’s Spiderman of the Rings, the Baltimore producer has wielded candy-coated synthesizers and jewel-toned vibraphones with radiant joy, combining conservatory-honed classical minimalism with the all-night-rager energy of a Jersey Shore DJ. His music is bright, pastel-colored, pumped full of the boundless energy of a puppy who’s just been let off its leash—and, increasingly, it’s got a lot of heart. Frankly, it’s hard to believe it took him this long to do something with dogs. The score Deacon composed for Well Groomed, Rebecca Stern’s documentary about creative dog grooming, manages to be both masterfully restrained and shot through with glee. While the action on screen is indisputably strange—it’s hard to get over seeing a dog whose tail has been turned into E.T.’s glowing finger—the tenderness of the music humanizes the women who cut, style, and dye their way to the Groom Expo in Hershey, Pennsylvania, instantly giving them a sense of dignity without so much as a whiff of patronization. The approach makes Well Groomed perhaps the most emotionally direct album he’s ever released. Deacon largely works with the same textures he’s been using for much of his career: pulsing vibraphone à la Steve Reich, whirring arpeggios via Philip Glass, big breezy chord progressions from Michael Rother. But where his previous impulse was to pile on layers until his songs collapsed and turned inside out, here he leaves plenty of space for the individual instruments to speak for themselves. He recorded the members of his ensemble individually, giving them abstract vocal instruction rather than written scores. His touch is remarkably gentle. Where a song like “Super Zoo” might have burst into a thousand ecstatic pieces on one of his earlier records, here, he pushes the elements together slowly, allowing the song to emerge rather than explode. Film scoring is an inherently complementary art, so it always risks feeling incomplete as standalone music. With some minor exceptions, Well Groomed does not have this problem. Perhaps because Deacon’s music is built from constant motion, very little here feels static or incomplete; even the more complex tracks, like “Scissors Down,” manage to develop from stillness to dead sprint with incredible efficiency. He responds to the turns of Stern’s film in kind: “Jurassic Bark” bounces between chords with a touch of impatience, anxious for the party it seems to sense coming, while M.C. Schmidt’s doubled-up piano runs in “When They’re in Color” sound like Bach stumbling through Yayoi Kusama’s Infinity Mirrored Rooms. You don’t need to see the luscious close-ups of Muppet-colored fur being trimmed to laugh at the scissor sounds in “Snip Snip,” just as you don’t need to know who is “Overwhelmed” to be moved by the delicacy of the piano, which Deacon refracts like a memory through sharp layers of echo and Steve Strohmeir’s lacy guitar work. From the outside, the world of creative dog grooming seems garish, cartoony, and of dubious taste; it’s not an art that lends itself to instant appreciation. Stern’s film shows that it also requires incredible attention to detail, a seriousness of purpose, and an imagination strong enough to look at a dog and see a rooster. It’s as if the music here recognizes something of itself in the dogs on screen and reacts accordingly. And by trimming away some of his own quadruple-dyed layers, Deacon gives us a clear glimpse of the good boy underneath. Catch up every Saturday with 10 of our best-reviewed albums of the week.

"Load It Up, Vol. 01",03 GreedoRon-RonTheProducer,by: Mano Sundaresan,Contributor,"https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f465e09094969ebce91b556/1:1/w_160/Load%20It%20Up,%20Vol.%2001_03%20greedo%20ronron%20the%20producer.jpg",2020-08-27 05:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/03-greedo-ron-rontheproducer-load-it-up-vol-01/,Alamo,"In a summer declared “lost” by partygoers and beach-dwellers, 03 Greedo barely felt the sun on his face. The transcendent L.A. rapper was enclosed in a cramped cell at the Middleton Unit in Abilene, TX, serving year two of a 20 year sentence for gun and drug trafficking charges. And starting on July 1, for 40 days and 40 nights, he was cut off from the outside world—no phone calls, no visits, not even fresh air—as Middleton went into total lockdown, tightening its vice grip on thousands of incarcerated people in response to the coronavirus pandemic. At the start of his sprawling new album Load It Up Vol. 01, Greedo talks through prison phone static about the meaning of its title. It’s a mindstate—“I know I had to load up on songs and albums in order to feed my family while I was gone,” he says. It’s also lingo, a command to the album’s sole producer Ron-RonTheProducer—“Me and Ron-Ron would work from, like, 9pm to 9am, nigga playing beats. Soon as I hear some hot shit, I be like ‘load it up.’” The call ends, Ron-Ron’s tag plays, and what follows is an hour of lived-in, reliable street rap from a couple years ago that continues to shape and contour the psyche of a rapper in his final days of freedom. Greedo’s greatest, bleakest accomplishment since incarceration hasn’t been any one album, but rather that he unfurled so much of himself into his brief months in the studio before he turned himself in. He was effectively forced to create at a hyper-accelerated pace, to drain himself into stuffy, exhausting nights with a rotating cast of rappers, producers, A&Rs and journalists just so he could feed his family and keep his name alive while the system put him away. In that stretch, he allegedly recorded dozens of projects. So far, we’ve gotten five: two tightly coiled albums with A-list producers Kenny Beats and DJ Mustard; two EPs with Travis Barker and Nef The Pharaoh; and now, Load It Up Vol. 01, with longtime collaborator Ron-RonTheProducer. It’s by far the most classically Greedo of the bunch, open and percolating and reminiscent in sound and form to projects like The Wolf Of Grape Street and God Level. On Load it Up, Ron-Ron and Greedo tap into a brooding, midtempo groove that navigates the purple hues between trap and L.A. street rap. There are no love songs, no experiments in pop. These are lusty, self-possessed screeds that flow with the buzzing synergy of a wired night in the studio. Greedo doesn’t directly allude to his then-impending prison sentence more than a few times on this album, but his frantic race against time is noticeable. There is a palpable urgency in the way Greedo, for instance, raps through error and mumbling, as though there’s no time for retakes. On to the next song. Still, Greedo finds fascinating ways to weave together disparate thoughts into numbing, transportive images. On “Gucci Of My City,” he compares himself to Gucci Mane—a star who, like Greedo, spent his prime years behind bars — then shrouds his whole world in the tinted glass of car windows and Gucci lenses, almost to suggest that he’d rather stay anonymous even when he’s free. And on “Scary Movie,” he draws a line through Friday The 13th and AKs, headless horsemen and hollow tips, all to paint a ghoulish picture of the projects. This is writing that isn’t writerly, full of impressionistic detail; it’s the mark of an artist constantly observing, constantly connecting. Most rewardingly, it is still such a thrill to just listen to Greedo. For how conservative the production feels, Greedo is still wholly unpredictable, one of the best with Auto-Tune this side of Future. He’ll twist the tails of phrases into oblique, ballooning shapes (“Gwap”), launch into breathless, croaky tirades (“Choppa Hold A Hunnit”), warble on high notes while they flutter through pitch-correction (“Same Zone Interlude”). His energy is whirring and kinetic and seems to rub off on the guests—Chief Keef, Sada Baby, Key Glock, and more—who all deliver top-flight verses. That feeling of witnessing the rapper deeply in his zone recalls earlier, more hopeful times. Such is the tragic, inescapable truth of Greedo’s pre-prison recording spree: how it ceaselessly transports you to alternate timelines and more forgiving worlds. Greedo has lost a chunk of life over drug and gun charges that could be traced back to a litany of systemic factors, including losing his father as a child, moving into Watts’ insular, oppressive Jordan Downs projects as an outcast teenager, facing bouts of homelessness, having a baby at 18, and losing his closest friend Lil Money in a gunfight. Load It Up, Vol 01 is undeniable; it’s also inextricably tied to these cold, cruel facts. Catch up every Saturday with 10 of our best-reviewed albums of the week.

APOLLO,Fireboy DML,by: Ivie Ani,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f3fefd49d8baa128c4383d9/1:1/w_160/apollo_fireboy%20dml.jpg,2020-08-26 05:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/fireboy-dml-apollo/,YBNLEMPIRE,"Apollo, one of the most complex characters of Greek mythology, is recognized as the Olympian god of light, truth, prophecy, poetry, healing, and music. His motives are anchored by three emotions: pride, lust, and loss. So is Fireboy DML. But on his second album, APOLLO, the Nigerian singer-songwriter vows to aim high, without going full Icarus. “How human am I to think myself a god?” Fireboy says on the project’s preamble. The music itself begins with his bold declaration: “I be king.” In this moment of popular Nigerian music awash with divergent styles—from more traditional music like highlife, to reggae, hip-hop, to the more modern Afro-fusion, alté, and the mainstream Afrobeats—Fireboy doesn’t put himself into one category; he rests at the intersection of R&B, pop, Afrobeats, and alté. It’s the self-described “Afro-life” sound from his 2018 breakout song “Jealous”; ambient, relatable, everyday-life music. APOLLO comes on the heels of Burna Boy’s Twice as Tall, in which Burna reasserts his status as the premier African giant standing firmly atop the scene, both in the states and overseas. While the Afro-fusion star leads social and political-leaning conversations bridging the Black diaspora with his music, Fireboy isn’t as much a part of that exchange. Instead, he’s situated in a separate class of artists, not making overt statements with his music and not dominating the mainstream either, but pushing the new vanguard of Afropop. In a lineup of current Afropop singers, Fireboy stands alongside the fluid, trap-leaning rapper-singer Rema, the young crooner Joeboy of Mr Eazi’s Empawa Africa label, and rising star Oxlade. Fireboy adds to the pantheon of loverboy languish, singing mostly about unrequited affection, delightful and depressing dalliances, and love that wanes just like summer heat on August nights. APOLLO takes the load off the heaviness of now. Fireboy excels at extracting the allure in the mundane, with his sincere and sober musings on life and himself. The album features familiar and fresh production from previous collaborators Pheelz, Type A, iamBeatz, and P.Prime, as well as a feature verse from Nigerian hip-hop heavyweight and APOLLO executive producer Olamide, who has a knack for discovering and developing new talent. Fireboy’s tried-and-true formula blends the old and the new, like when Afropop veteran and reliable hitmaker Wande Coal shows up on APOLLO. Fireboy is a disciple of Coal in ingenuity and style, and his vocals complement his predecessor’s signature falsetto on “Spell” as he leans into Coal’s mastery of melody for a pleasant cross-generational connection. Like any young artist culling from creative movements on the ground and across the internet, Fireboy plucks from a cornucopia of influences. With Afro-life, he tinctures his chameleonic R&B with subtle hints of pop, Afrobeats, and dance music, producing a cocktail of R&B whether he intends to or not. “Tattoo” is his most sensual song to date, reminiscent of the sweet soulfulness of Miguel’s 2010 debut, All I Want Is You. The bright horns and slick production on “Favourite Song” aim for the groove of Michael Jackson and Quincy Jones’ bubbly boogie music. There is minimal range in his simplified style of songwriting. “God Only Knows” is guided by chants and a few trite one-liners, but the celestial, grandiose production thankfully overshadows its shortcomings. Olamide makes an appearance with his mentee on “Afar,” a solid and smooth track anchored by the hook, “Make them dey love me from afar.” What sounds rudimentary on first listen soon becomes catchy melodies that linger on the lips. Fireboy’s lyrics are so uncomplicated that they become unforgettable. “I’m not tryna be the number one,” Fireboy sings on “Airplane Mode.” “So many legends dey, I’m just tryna be another one.” The declarations of defiance throughout the project are more charming than thundering. He isn’t so much the flash of lightning as a soft power, the quiet after the storm. At times, the album’s sentimentality may sound overwrought, but at its core, APOLLO is easy, exciting, and earnest. It’s what feel-good music sounds like as it becomes increasingly difficult to feel good; it’s soothing in a palliative way. APOLLO is not grand or abstract enough to qualify as escapism. Instead, Fireboy stays grounded, shooting the breeze, limning the simplicities of romance and life. Catch up every Saturday with 10 of our best-reviewed albums of the week.

Eno Axis,H.C. McEntire,by: Abigail Covington,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f35b469a6e69fa0a9374fc3/1:1/w_160/Eno%20Axis_hc%20mcentire.jpg,2020-08-26 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/hc-mcentire-eno-axis/,Merge,"Back in March, when the world screeched to a monstrous halt, H.C. McEntire was already sitting still. The alt-Americana artist had decided to head back to her home state of North Carolina a few months earlier, after spending the better part of the last two years as a touring backup singer for Angel Olsen. To reorient herself, McEntire settled into a farmhouse on the wooded edge of the Eno River in Durham and started doing what most folks do each day: the laundry. The daily tasks of rural life and McEntire’s meaningful devotion to them define Eno Axis, the sophisticated yet relaxed follow-up to 2018’s all-consuming Lionheart. Step inside Eno Axis and things immediately fall into place. On album opener “Hands for the Harvest,” a simple suggestion—“Early rise, start the fire, till the rows, pass the tithes”—hung across a sweet gospel waltz sets the pace. All that needs to get done today are the dishes, the song suggests. The stakes remain comfortingly low throughout Eno Axis. Stress only creeps in through the album’s weaker tracks. Thematically, “One Eye Open” is an outlier. Though the subject of white supremacy remains as upsettingly relevant as ever, its placement here is jarring. The song would’ve been better suited for Lionheart, where McEntire reckoned with her own history growing up as a closeted tomboy among a Southern Baptist family in a small town at the base of the Blue Ridge Mountains. In addition to being a songwriter, McEntire is a skilled poet, and the poet’s devotion to both meaning and clarity comes through in many of these songs. You don’t have to wrestle with lines like “closer than a shadow cast,” because you know what it means. Her clever and clear wordplay recalls the style of another great queer poet, Mary Oliver. “She will leave like she appeared, eager-winged hummingbird,” sings McEntire on “River’s Jaw.” “I know someone who kisses the way a flower opens, but more rapidly,” writes Mary Oliver in “I Know Someone.” The peaceful assurances that Eno Axis offers come in part from McEntire’s selective deployment of imagery and metaphor. A love that lasts “longer than a good night’s rest,” and is as “certain as the horse’s stare,” is a very nice thing to think about. But pretty verses alone could not soothe a sore the way this album does. McEntire’s musicianship works equally hard and just as effectively. She challenged herself to write in open tunings, giving a song like the gorgeous instrumental interlude “Sunday Morning” space to roam within itself, individual instruments gently bouncing off one another like the giant balloons at the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day parade. A recording process that prioritized live takes and involved few overdubs also contributes to the album’s spontaneous and spacious atmosphere. The gentle, rolling drumbeat on “Footman’s Coat” and the rich, warm tones that McEntire and band member Luke Norton evoke from their instruments create a full sound that avoids the cloying style of Nashville country. Restricted by a more confined, less spontaneous structure, the songs of Eno Axis would surely lose their healing powers. Their simplicity gives them strength and McEntire’s unfussy treatment makes for music that doesn’t distract from chaos but teaches us instead how to move through it.     Eno Axis is both a wonderful album and a handy instruction manual for our times: Follow the simple suggestions tucked within McEntire’s songs and you may just feel your weariness begin to lift like morning mist burning off a river.

In Sickness & In Flames,The Front Bottoms,by: Julia Gray,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f43d5c8094969ebce91b3da/1:1/w_160/In%20Sickness%20&%20In%20Flames_the%20front%20bottoms.jpg,2020-08-26 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/the-front-bottoms-in-sickness-and-in-flames/,Elektra,"The Front Bottoms made their name singing anthems for ordinary people: songs for the suburbs, about drinking beer out of coffee mugs and hating your friends. Like much of the New Jersey duo’s fourth-wave emo, pop-punk ilk, their music works when it’s most immediate—a gut punch, not a slow burn. Brian Sella and Mat Uychich are at their best when they’re shouting about the minutiae that make your brain swell and fill your stomach with rocks, like the wine stain on your couch that’s been there since the night she left. Our current period of confinement calls for such intense accounts of mundanity. We’re trapped at home, some of us in our parents’ basements, lonely and out of work, awaiting the next spike in COVID cases. A new Front Bottoms album could’ve complemented our solitude. But In Sickness & In Flames doesn’t really seem fit for any moment. An air of unfixed nostalgia blurs the past with an approximation of the present. Dusty acoustics and guttural full-band chants harken back to the duo’s early work that captivated college radio during the first half of the 2010s. But that influence is sandwiched between, and subdued by, modern indie-pop flourishes, synth breakdowns, and a chorus of “oohs.” Sella has mostly abandoned his signature Moleskine impressionism and hometown scene-setting. IS&IF deals largely in cliches, gesturing toward broad themes like love and growth without saying much of anything. Lyrics are the album’s biggest downfall. Solid riffs are tainted by half-baked platitudes: “You are the truth I choose to bend myself around”; “We are all going the hard way”; “Everyone blooms in their own time.” The songs place a lot of weight on these phrases, repeating them until they almost sound profound. “Jerk” could have been a fun MySpace-era ditty, with its tinny Auto-Tuned intro, but it devolves into a refrain that sounds stale by its second round: “Like a jerk, yeah I know that I look like a jerk.” The Front Bottoms’ once charming, choked-up spoken-word interludes feel awkward and stilted. As made evident by 2017’s ’80s pop-tinged Going Grey, Front Bottoms lose their magnetism when they focus on radio appeal. IS&IF’s hooks are catchy enough to make their way onto, say, the Sirius XM indie channel, but probably won’t inspire a new generation of Front Bottoms fans. A few songs embrace the band’s old style and intimacy, enough to attract day-one listeners, but not enough to make IS&IF an essential album. After co-producing their last LP with Nicholas “RAS” Furlong, an Avicii collaborator who counts credits with Blink-182 and All Time Low, the Front Bottoms decided to co-produce their new album with Mike Sapone, whose roster includes acts like Sorority Noise, Oso Oso, Brand New, and Taking Back Sunday. On the album’s highlights, he brings the band back to their unpretentious, guitar-driven roots. “Montgomery Forever’’ is a buddy jam about mental illness and self-deprecation. If mosh pits can exist in a post-COVID world, this song will inspire some flailing bodies. “Leaf Pile” blazes forth with fiery guitars and echoed shouts (“I don’t wanna talk/I wanna look out the window”). The lyrics land when you can tell they were transferred directly from brain to paper: Lines like “You’ll always be my girlfriend even after we get married” and “Seemed like a good day to be barely alive” are unfussy and childish in a good way. The Front Bottoms have consistently avoided labels, falling somewhere between folk-punk, pop-punk, and indie rock. That fluidity was a strength when their music was undergirded by a sense of urgency and earnest DIY sensibilities, when they built a community around angst. In Sickness & In Flames is just noncommittal. The album is twee and punk and neither of those things. It’s understandable that the Front Bottoms, a band whose legacy revolves around post-adolescent growing pains, have lost some of the spark that fueled their first six albums. They’re older now, no longer concerned with the girl that forgot about them during her semester abroad. Sella once stood out for a demeanor that was both wide-eyed and jaded, torn between a yelp and a sigh. In Sickness & In Flames tilts too far toward the former; the Front Bottoms have lost their bite.

The Dirt and the Stars,Mary Chapin Carpenter,by: Sam Sodomsky,Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f35630aeb982d18c453ded6/1:1/w_160/The%20Dirt%20and%20the%20Stars_mary%20chapin%20carpenter.jpg,2020-08-26 05:00:00,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/mary-chapin-carpenter-the-dirt-and-the-stars/,Lambent Light,"More than three decades into her career as one of country music’s most reliable and empathetic songwriters, Mary Chapin Carpenter can set an identifiable mood with just the sound of her guitar. She favors open tunings on acoustic instruments; chord progressions that never quite resolve but let in enough light to feel at ease. In her lyrics, and even just her song titles, she gestures toward words of comfort and self-affirmation: We’re all right. I have a need for solitude. It’s OK to be sad. The magic of her music is how every texture at her disposal—from her gentle fingerpicking to her smooth and precise singing voice—can communicate these messages just as clearly. Chapin’s 15th studio album, The Dirt and the Stars, is devoted to this elusive gift, how a quiet sound can summon a world of associations. In fact, there’s an entire song about it. It’s called “Old D-35,” and Chapin dedicates it to John Jennings, the guitarist and producer who worked with Chapin on her 1987 debut Hometown Girl through her commercial breakthroughs in the ’90s. Singing to her old friend, who died from cancer in 2015, Chapin finds a sense of peace in the music he left behind: “As long as there are songs that sound like rain on an old terne roof,” she sings, letting her accompanists finish the thought with a fragile, descending piano line. With such a careful and attentive sound, it is doubly impressive that Chapin and her band recorded the album entirely live in the studio. It is one of the most intimate records in her catalog, and the entire band seems locked into the introspective intensity that marks her best songwriting. In the opening “Farther Along and Further In,” they join slowly with pedal steel and mandolin and a lapping drumbeat. When they lock into a groove near the end of the song, Chapin lets out a sudden, whispered exclamation. It is less the sound of a bandleader losing herself to the music than the lightbulb flash of a good idea arriving late at night, when no one else is awake. The lyrics are populated with these kinds of hushed revelations. “There’s no day that’s useless,” Chapin notes in “It’s OK to Be Sad.” As if putting her own advice to use, she spends these songs singing about hard wisdom and dark spirals, looking for patterns in the ways people fall apart: “All broken hearts breaks differently,” she reminds us. There are two explicitly political songs: “American Stooge,” a tragicomic character study, and “Secret Keepers,” a heartland rocker about women forced to keep their stories of abuse to themselves. Set to one of the album’s most upbeat arrangements, the dissonance is intentional, the sound of private thoughts surfacing among people who understand. Chapin has a gift for finding universal wisdom in these deeply personal struggles, and these songs strive for clarity in the face of darkness. In the closing “Between the Dirt and the Stars,” one of her most vivid and beautiful songs to date, Chapin allows herself refuge in scenic memories from a teenage road trip. “If we’re lucky, ghosts and prayers are company, not enemies,” she sings. Her band sprawls into a lengthy instrumental coda with a climactic guitar solo by Duke Levine, suggesting a kind of spiritual catharsis. But Chapin’s thoughts keep turning to an old song playing on the car radio, somewhere deep in her psyche. “Everything we’ll ever know,” she sings, “is in the choruses.” And so she keeps listening, learning, driving on.

Source,Nubya Garcia,by: Andy Beta,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f43d022f6eb11025fede8d4/1:1/w_160/source_nubya%20garcia.jpg,2020-08-25 05:00:00,Jazz,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/nubya-garcia-source/,Concord Jazz,"For new listeners and latecomers, there was no handier introduction to London’s vibrant, bustling jazz scene than Gilles Peterson’s 2018 compilation We Out Here. Curated by the scene’s own breakout star Shabaka Hutchings, the set showcased a new generation of artists melding jazz classicism to Afrobeat, neo-soul, electronic music, and ambient. And no one worked harder than tenor saxophonist Nubya Garcia, present on five of the comp’s nine pieces. Hailing from an immigrant family—her mother from Guyana, her father from Trinidad—she grew up in a musical family in the London borough of Camden, starting first on piano and violin before gravitating to a “broken as hell” old clarinet. She came up with other groups like Maisha and the septet Nérija, and she’s remained busy ever since, her presence felt on Makaya McCraven’s Universal Beings and Sons of Kemet’s Your Queen is a Reptile as well as Moses Sumney’s grae. No matter where she appears, she brings an exploratory, energized spirit, always playing in service to the song, never overshadowing the music, only elevating the proceedings. That spirit and openness translates readily to Garcia’s long-anticipated debut, Source. Recorded with producer Kwes, whose credits range from Solange and Bobby Womack to Nérija, the album pushes Nubya Garcia and her tight-knit group into new territory while also remaining firmly rooted in jazz. And while her previous EPs popped up and soon disappeared on smaller labels, she now finds herself label mates with another dynamic jazz figure, Esperanza Spalding. Switching from dub reggae to cumbia to classic balladry, Garcia meditates on her humble family heritage, the continuum of jazz history, and the power of collective action in our present moment. “Pace” serves as an empathic mission statement. As she recently told Downbeat, it refers to the hectic lifestyle of a gigging Londoner, but “Pace” embodies a whole range of emotions. Propelled by keyboardist Joe Arman-Jones’ cascading chords, the group soars and then deftly lands back where they began. Garcia’s solo calmly navigates it all: fiery and supple, dizzying and lyrical. You can hear how she’s garnered comparisons to the greats: Dexter Gordon, Sonny Rollins, Gary Bartz. Garcia never overpowers her bandmates, instead slotting into the contours her band provides, whether it’s the nimble soul jazz of “The Message Continues” or the Ethio-jazz flavor of “Inner Game.” On the meditative R&B of “Stand With Each Other,” augmented by Nérija trumpeter MS Maurice (aka Sheila Maurice-Grey) and a trio of vocalists, Garcia’s horn barely rises above a purr, and doesn’t need to: her tone entwines with the wordless humming to generate a low-key warmth and benevolence. Source thrills most when it delves into non-traditional jazz rhythms from the Afro-Caribbean diaspora, as on the traditional “La cumbia me está llamando,” recorded in Bogota. But it’s the sprawl of the title track that best captures Garcia’s creative arc the past few years. “Source”’s exploratory 12 minutes open with the echoing snares and firecracker hi-hats of drummer Sam Jones and skanking staccato chords from Arman-Jones, all earmarks of dub reggae. Airy vocal “ahhhs” slowly lead us into Garcia’s solo, which carefully scales up from dubbed-out vibrato lines to blowing full-on fire by the end. Arman-Jones’ toggles between electric and acoustic, subtly pulling the piece into cosmic jazz territory. By the end, the piece has seemingly traveled miles, and in so doing traced Garcia’s own steadfast journey. She has called the album a story “about my heritage, my ancestry, exploring those places and those stories from my parents and my grandparents.” On Source, she weaves together so many threads so masterfully that she instantly establishes herself as a foundational voice in the larger, ongoing story of the London jazz scene. Her debut is a stunning introduction. Catch up every Saturday with 10 of our best-reviewed albums of the week.

"Freeze, Melt",Cut Copy,by: Jesse Dorris,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f43c2d1f6eb11025fede8d1/1:1/w_160/Cut%20Copy.jpg,2020-08-25 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/cut-copy-freeze-melt/,CuttersThe Orchard,"Cut Copy have been at it for almost 20 years, which seems impossible. They seem to exist outside of time, perhaps because they’ve been looking back from the start—immediately appealing and with a toothsome competence, but more about articulating taste than defining a singular point of view. Maybe bandleader Dan Whitford felt stale after 2017’s slick bummer, Haiku from Zero. Maybe the anxiety of influence had settled into ennui. For whatever reason, Whitford left his native Australia and decamped to Copenhagen, endured Scandinavia’s dark winters of the soul, and obsessed about climate change before returning to Melbourne to get the band together again. The result is an album as chilled as an upscale boutique in a heatwave and as politically engaged as your Instagram feed, which is to say very and not quite as much as it thinks. Lead single “Love Is All We Share” is sumptuous, with an icy choir hovering at eye level and little squiggles signifying the alienation that arrived with the dial-up modem, leaving us more connected and more isolated than ever. “Dead to the world,” he sings, as beautiful chunks of harmony float by like floes in a rising sea, “can you feel it in your fingers?/Love is all we share.”  There’s more numbness than sentiment. If this “we” is us in Australia, or Denmark, or the United States—or, sadly, so much of the rest of the world—love is not all we share; rage and terror are at least two more things. Anyway, in “A Perfect Day,” Whitford is “running out of love” but does have very well recorded percussion echoing like bad thoughts, and glistening synths that can fill up an otherwise empty room. “What a perfect day,” he sings, “to be alone.” Words barely make it into “Stop Horizon,” a twinkler of plucked guitars and pitter-pat keyboards, as if the Orb’s “Little Fluffy Clouds” blew in some light showers. Later, a track called “Rain” arrives, and whether it signifies tears, a biblical cleanse, the flooding doom on our horizons, or a pitiless drought which will allow the West to burn unabated, it puddles beautifully. It’s basically an onomatopoeia, but the meaning washes away. Lyricless “In Transit” moves the album to a close, with little stuttering ticks of time running out for us all and a rather lovely sing-song melody that murmurs, Oh well. “Running in the Grass” has a bit more bite, with a sharp swiping blade of a noise that could give your eardrum a papercut. It severs the chorus (“You cut me down to the bone”) from the verses. If crowds ever gather again, it will please them. As will “Like Breaking Glass” which is mixed, like the rest of the album, by the Knife and Fever Ray collaborator Christoffer Berg. It softens those Swedes’ silent shouts into slightly hushed sighs. And opener “Cold Water” is wistful and effective, a soggier take on Portishead’s “The Rip,” soaring upward in hopes of a festival to survey. Would that it find might one. Festival culture, with its massive expenditures of energy and waste creation, is (was?) hell on the climate. Touring, too, not to mention the transubstantiation of fossil fuel into beautiful vinyl. If it’s hypocritical for Cut Copy to swap the joys of neon and dancing and kissing for a political agenda diametrically opposed to their own work, well, hypocrisy is the price of existence. The trick is to acknowledge reality without aestheticizing peril. The cover of Freeze, Melt nods to the conceptual artist John Baldessari, whose death at the start of 2020 might have warned us of the waves of bullshit to come. Its own concept is unimpeachable: Climate change does suck. Ice is a memory. Mostly, though, Freeze, Melt just feels like a nice warm bath.","The Australian electro-pop veterans return with a climate-change album both as chilled as an upscale boutique and as politically engaged as your Instagram feed.

eeeeeeep! EP,John Vanderslice,by: Zach Schonfeld,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f43d3ed8ae6324b59c6a320/1:1/w_160/Eeeeeeep!_john%20vanderslice.jpg,2020-08-25 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/john-vanderslice-eeeeeeep-ep/,Tiny Telephone,"Someday, there will be books and graduate dissertations examining the distinctly 2020 phenomenon of the quarantine album. The term already invokes a web of clichés: a stripped-down album exuding authenticity and Nebraska aesthetics, borne of isolation and quiet reflection. And John Vanderslice, the stalwart indie-rock songwriter and producer, has made absolutely nothing of the sort. As a legendary analog disciple—he’s the founder of a studio where rooms are packed with vintage tape spools and “ProTools” is said to be a dirty word—Vanderslice has amassed enough purist cred for one lifetime. Now, in quarantine, he’s trading audiophile aesthetics for Ableton. His new EP, Eeeeeeep!, is billed as “the first songs I have ever recorded on a computer,” as well as an attempt to “blur my vocals and lyrics into some weirder shit.” So, if you’re expecting one of Vanderslice’s more abrasive releases, you won’t be disappointed: The EP opens with a supremely discordant stew of scraping beats and mangled vocals. But overall, Eeeeeeep! is less a full departure from the compellingly skewed indie-pop Vanderslice has spent 20 years exploring and more an expansion of the squiggly synths and sputtering drum machines that have always lived on the margins of his songs. There are plenty of familiar reference points for fans. “Lure Mice Condemn Erase” puts a glitchy spin on the distorted acoustic sound of 2007’s Emerald City. Its lyrics imagine Vanderslice as a zealous cult leader, an example of his knack for building emotionally resonant songs around outlandish plots. “Just give in, just collapse/Follow our total relapse,” he exhorts his followers. “Team Stammer/Savior Machine” provides a subtle callback to 2001’s “Keep the Dream Alive” with its counting-based rhyme scheme, except now the melody jostles against knotty drum programming. It’s a solid example of Vanderslice using digital software to make his music stranger rather than streamlining it. These experiments may have emerged from quarantine tinkering, but they’re also reflective of other changes in Vanderslice’s life. In 2019, the artist left San Francisco, his longtime home base, and decamped for Los Angeles, setting up a small studio in his backyard. That year, he released The Cedars, his first album after a six-year retirement, jumpstarting a creative rebirth that fed right into 2020’s Dollar Hits—a companion album spun from mutated tracks from The Cedars—and now Eeeeeeep! When he was interviewed about his recent influences, Vanderslice cited experimental hip-hop eccentrics like JPEGMAFIA and Tierra Whack: hardly common touchstones for established indie-rock dudes over 50, but you can hear such influences bleeding into the fractured textures and abrupt edits of this EP. Eeeeeeep! is a compelling document of a veteran artist studying new tricks. But the EP is brief, and skittering, chaotic creations like “Xxxx” and “Song for Leopold” feel more like intriguing sketches than fully satisfying compositions. Anyone who’s seen Vanderslice live knows that, despite his modest fame, his songbook is capable of bringing audiences together in raucous singalongs. (There’s nothing quite like a crowd of strangers shouting the words “Bill Gates must die!”) His recent output—particularly since 2013’s Kickstarter-fueled Dagger Beach—has veered away from discernible choruses and unifying gestures. This is by design, and feels like the start of a new creative phase borne out of both inspiration and necessity. But Vanderslice’s left turn into digital wizardry works best when it doesn’t ignore his considerable gift for old-fashioned songcraft.

The Consuming Flame: Open Exercises in Group Form,Matmos,by: Philip Sherburne,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f43cdfa42e07aad86ac9112/1:1/w_160/The%20Consuming%20Flame-%20Open%20Exercises%20in%20Group%20Form_matmos.jpg,2020-08-25 05:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/matmos-the-consuming-flame-open-exercises-in-group-form/,Thrill Jockey,"Matmos’ high-concept investigations take narrow parameters to gleefully absurd extremes. For last year’s Plastic Anniversary, the duo of Drew Daniel and M.C. Schmidt sourced every sound from cast-off plastic objects: vinyl LPs, riot shields, even a breast implant. On Ultimate Care II, they extended a career-long quest to find art in unlikely places by using a Whirlpool washing machine as the album’s sole musical instrument. And 2013’s The Marriage of True Minds examined the pair’s long creative and romantic partnership through a paranormal lens, using experiments in telepathy and ESP to generate musical raw material. The Consuming Flame spins a seemingly arbitrary number into one of their most elaborate conceits yet. Soliciting contributions from 99 different musicians, including themselves, Matmos wove the lot—squirrely electronic beats, post-rock excursions, dub interludes, freeform noise—into a mammoth, three-hour suite meant to be experienced in a single sitting. They only required their collaborators to pace their submissions at 99 beats per minute. The collaged-together results are fascinating, often enthralling, occasionally an uphill slog, and every bit as anarchic as their genesis would suggest. Matmos have made collaboration a key part of their practice for years, but even by their typically open-armed standards, The Consuming Flame’s guest list is staggeringly diverse. Their accomplices include longtime friends (Wobbly, J. Lesser, People Like Us), electronic veterans (Mouse on Mars), indie titans (Yo La Tengo), improvisers (David Grubbs), noise rappers (clipping.), and an array of experimental electronic musicians (Rabit, Oneohtrix Point Never, DeForrest Brown, Jr.). There are metalheads, techno producers, opera singers, and acoustic fingerpickers. Even author Douglas Rushkoff turns up—doing, as best I can tell, some kind of electronically assisted impersonation of the Muppets’ Beaker. An accompanying poster lays out a detailed timeline of who is playing when—at the music’s busiest, as many as seven artists are in the mix—but it never tells us exactly what they are doing. Part of the fun is in trying to disentangle the strands of the music’s knottiest moments—or, conversely, figuring out why what looks, on paper, like a particularly crowded stretch might yield so few clues as to its constituent parts. For all the variety of that list, The Consuming Flame is not an eclectic listen, exactly. This is not a supermarket where individual contributions sit neatly packaged and tidily arranged; it’s more like a bulk-foods store after a hurricane, with oatmeal and wild rice, dried apricots and seaweed, carob chips and detergent all swirled together, patterns giving way to chaos and back again, depending on how and where the upturned bins have landed. Given the album’s length and density, it resists close reading; if there is an organizing logic here, it is not readily apparent, although brushed drums and choppy vocal effects provide thematic through lines, and the occasional recurring motif lends a sense of narrative cohesion. But the music often unspools with natural ease. During one particularly engaging passage early in CD1, “A Doughnut in the Sky,” shimmering drones give way to dubby post-rock that rises into a Loaded-style jam; a fade-out leads us into a field recording of children’s voices, and then a rapid succession of highly suggestive sonic images: the bonging of a broken grandfather clock; power sanders on the fritz; the ghost of Derek Bailey. Before long, a Diwali-like clapping rhythm is paired with prepared piano; toward the end of the first section, a burst of pure, uncut jazz fusion flashes out like a glimpse of an alternate universe. It’s not always a pleasurable listen; I haven’t found it conducive to meditative morning walks or dinners with friends. There are stretches of monotony, and the tempo they have chosen can drag, trudging along at a sullen andante. But these moments of struggle are part of the point of the endeavor. Schmidt has compared the album, in its 178-minute surfeit, to a journey by car, and lord knows that even the most scintillating road trips have their doldrums. What might be most striking about The Consuming Flame is how perfectly it suits the peculiarities of the present moment, even though the whole project was in the can before the pandemic ever reared its ugly microbial head. The project could scarcely be more prescient: Its central mode of remote collaboration is, suddenly, one of the principal ways that people work together. Its emotional states, veering from giddiness to abject boredom, are a mirror image of these past few months’ unfamiliar clockworks, their racing weeks and creeping hours. Like most Matmos albums, The Consuming Flame is about more than just its ostensible organizing principle. The number 99 is largely arbitrary, but the animating ideas are the same ones that have been at the heart of Matmos’ work all along: community, interdependence, the radical joy of creative play. And as this long year stretches on, infection curves unspooling against the X axis—not entirely unlike the multi-colored bars stretching across the album’s list of contributors—those same ideas are proving just as important in life as in art.

SUGAREGG,Bully,by: Quinn Moreland,Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f3fed45e8f0cad169c21a75/1:1/w_160/sugaregg_bully.jpg,2020-08-24 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/bully-sugaregg/,Sub Pop,"At 29, Bully’s Alicia Bognanno could teach a master class in grunge rock. She knows how to write hooks that grab you like a rip current, she was a star intern at Steve Albini’s Electrical Audio, and her raspy howl could pierce metal. She’s got such a firm grasp on the part that director Alex Ross Perry asked her to write the music for the fictional ’90s rock band led by Elisabeth Moss in his 2019 film Her Smell. But Bognanno knew that something was off, that there was a block in the system, and before embarking on her third record, SUGAREGG, she addressed the personal issues that shadowed her last album, 2017’s Losing. Her fresh start was both professional and personal. She parted ways with her bandmates and landed on the right treatment for her bipolar II, which she credits for SUGAREGG’s groundedness. Liberated from some anxiety and feelings of imposter syndrome, she was able to take a step back. SUGAREGG is the first Bully album to be engineered by someone other than Bognanno, in this case John Congleton (known for his work with Angel Olsen, Sharon Van Etten, and Moses Sumney). It’s essentially Bully’s re-introduction as a solo project, and these 12 songs capture the invigorating energy of the band’s 2015 debut. For the most part, SUGAREGG sticks to the tried-and-true: sticky hooks, shoutalong lyrics, and walloping, caffeinated riffs. (“Oh yeah, I just wanted to pick up the tempo,” Bognanno ad-libs at the beginning of one song.) It’s the sort of album that can inject a jolt of adrenaline into even the most spudly couch potato. Unlike its predecessor, SUGARGEGG has moments of genuine musical levity, even if the subject matter retains its heaviness. The lethargic “Prism” is a sun-streaked daydream tinged by lingering memories of pain; “Where to Start” turns frustration with a partner into jangly rocket fuel. (Bognanno told Rolling Stone that the melody was inspired by Chumbawamba’s “Tubthumping.”) Bognanno’s songwriting has always been personal, but here she digs deeper. On “Like Fire,” she illustrates the ups and downs of bipolar disorder, especially the overwhelming, disruptive bouts of euphoria. The bouncy “Every Tradition” rejects the biological and social roles (parenthood, marriage) impressed upon women, describing these expectations as dissociative. “Something’s off, you’re wrong about the dream/And I’ve been fucking up/Wasting my time second-guessing what I need,” she proclaims over a blast of noise. The thoughts that run through her mind in the bass-heavy “Stuck in Your Head” are earnest in their desire for clarity: “I wanna be in touch/Feel a little less disconnected/Without the crutch.” Uncertainty reappears over and over on SUGAREGG; “I don’t know where to start,” “I don’t know what I wanted,” and “don’t know what you wanted” are common refrains. But whether she is addressing an absent parent or giving up on the exhausting emotional rollercoaster of a relationship, by acknowledging that she doesn’t know all the answers or reasons, Bognanno learns to loosen her grip. “I’m not angry anymore,” she sings on the smoldering “Hours and Hours.” “I’m not holding on to that.” Midway through the album, on “Come Down,” Bognanno offers loving advice, maybe to herself, maybe to someone else: “I hope you come to realize your worth/Tired devotion, passion is a curse.” Delivered over a mid-tempo melody and punctuated by the barking of her dog, Mezzi, there’s little noise to distract from the message: Self-love can be life-changing. SUGAREGG’s confidence and candor suggest that Bognanno is taking those words to heart. Catch up every Saturday with 10 of our best-reviewed albums of the week.

In a Dream EP,Troye Sivan,by: Shaad D’Souza,Contributor ,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f3ad16beb982d18c453e0ed/1:1/w_160/in%20a%20dream_troye%20sivan.jpg,2020-08-24 05:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/troye-sivan-in-a-dream-ep/,Capitol,"Late last year, on the final night of his Bloom tour, Troye Sivan walked onstage suited à la David Byrne and left in the spandexed, eyepatched regalia of David Bowie. Sivan was at the tail end of an album cycle that had him performing alongside supernovas of pop music: strutting down a catwalk singing his hit “My My My!” with Taylor Swift, dancing on tables with Ariana Grande. This costuming was a potent symbol of ambition, and a cheeky nod to subversive, queer-ish forebears. Bloom, Sivan’s 2018 sophomore album, made him an avatar of a new generation of mainstream-friendly queer popstars. In the lights of a sold-out arena, he seemed poised to become the first of them to hit the big—really big—leagues. In a Dream, the 25-year-old’s six-song sequel to Bloom, isn’t an ascension to blockbusting ubiquity, but something more interesting: a formally adventurous break-up record that explores the far corners of indie pop. Although enjoyable, Bloom and Sivan’s 2015 debut Blue Neighbourhood rarely broke through a certain veneer of cleanliness. When he emerged, there were far fewer young queer people in the mainstream; one could hardly blame him for appearing as a polite and broadly appealing spokesperson for an underrepresented community. At a time when mainstream pop is as calculated as it’s ever been—the product of a major label system obsessed with playlisting and “streamability”—he might have been rewarded for maintaining that family-friendly image. Instead, like the forebears Sivan emulated onstage last year, In a Dream chooses distinctiveness over approachability, offering a bricolage of warped indie rock, tech-house, and theatre-kid emotion. Across In a Dream, Sivan eschews the black-and-white sadness of typical pop breakup albums in favor of the self-discovery that can happen in the wake of heartbreak. “Stud,” the record’s lascivious, sun-kissed centerpiece, dives into heart-racing casual sex, hinging on a classic trope of queer desire: Do I want to be him, or fuck him? (Call it the Call Me by Your Name conundrum.) “Hey stud! You can come and meet me out front, you got all the muscles and the features I want,” Sivan sings, his Auto-Tuned voice crinkling like tinfoil. He teases and taunts, flirtatious to the point of second-hand embarrassment, as the song switches gear into a raucous house beat. When he’s feeling more downcast on opener and first single “Take Yourself Home,” snatches of arena anthem fodder hang around him like peeling wallpaper. These touches seem to deliberately undermine their own triumphant feeling, serving as bitter reminders that even a great pop song can’t fix the worst feelings. In both cases, the tentative, fresh-faced star of Bloom —“Hold my hand if I get scared now”—is gone. These songs are drawn from the moments when sadness turns to clarity and loneliness to self-possession, and the same confidence drives In a Dream’s more outré aesthetics. Between Charli XCX’s immersion in PC Music hyperpop and Taylor Swift’s collaborations with members of the National and Bon Iver, there’s nothing new about pop stars drawing from indie music. But In a Dream feels connected to a more peculiar segment of pop’s underground: I hear smacks of Negative Gemini’s dissociated club music and Vegyn’s formed formlessness in these songs, as well as the warmth of Rostam, indie-pop’s current king of the queer bildungsroman. The hazy, guitar-heavy interlude “could cry just thinkin about you” isn’t far from the jangle experiments of avant-garde hero Dean Blunt, who Sivan namechecked on Beats 1 earlier this month. The team that assisted Sivan on In a Dream is largely the same as on Bloom; Sivan seems to have simply grown into his own influences. The EP format—the preferred model for a new class of pop auteurs, from Mallrat to Yaeji—may afford him freedom to explore his own weirdness without the pressure of a major album cycle. Even the EP’s most conventional song, the ’80s-inspired cheating apology “Easy,” surprises. Sivan sings through thick Auto-Tune, lamenting the dissolution of his relationship, but punctuating it with an uncanny exclamation—“This house is on fire, woo!”—that suggests there’s something sublime about the agony. Nothing about “Easy” should work, from the “woo!” to the Future-lite vocals to the City Pop synth solo. And yet it does. These idiosyncratic choices may sacrifice some of Sivan’s universal appeal, but it’s much more fun to watch him cutting his own path.

Happy Birthday,Sneaks,by: Zach Schonfeld,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f3fd9f9b379c588e81efb26/1:1/w_160/happy%20birthday_sneaks.jpg,2020-08-24 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/sneaks-happy-birthday/,Merge,"If you don’t like a Sneaks song, just wait 60 seconds. A new one will rev up, mesmerize you with its barebones precision, and lurch to an abrupt stop in less time than it takes to microwave a frozen burrito. Eva Moolchan, the punk-adjacent Washington, D.C. musician who has been recording under the Sneaks moniker since 2014 (and for Merge since 2017), has made concision a kind of religion. You could comfortably fit her first three albums onto one CD-R, the kind of DIY treasure trove that might have been passed among friends at a campus radio station in an earlier era. With 2019’s Highway Hypnosis, Moolchan tried, with varying results, to expand beyond the spiky bass-and-drum-machine minimalism that defined her earlier work. Her latest not-so-long-player, Happy Birthday, more effectively incorporates house and hip-hop textures, while retaining the enigmatic swagger that first brought her an audience in the punk community. Choruses are of no use to Sneaks, and lyrics remain fragmented snatches of mood and attitude. But lengthier, more robust compositions are no longer off-limits. At its best, Happy Birthday showcases the fullest, most sophisticated grooves of Moolchan’s career. “Faith” is a marvel, with a four-on-the-floor thump and clanging-kitchenware percussion worthy of early LCD Soundsystem; Moolchan is sly and detached, reciting her vocals two syllables at a time, elusive with meaning until she’s not. “Faith in love, my friend/It’s the only thing we’ve got,” she repeats at the song’s close, capping a barrage of puzzles with an unambiguous statement of intent. “Sanity,” a skittering six-minute workout, is her first attempt to ride a beat for more than a couple minutes at a time, swapping out the chintzy drum machines for a heavier, club-ready boom-clap. Moolchan talks more than she sings, often in an understated murmur. Like a rapper raised on Kraftwerk over Run-D.M.C., she achieves a counterintuitive sort of charisma through quiet force of repetition rather than volume. On “Mars in Virgo,” she repeats the titular phrase 16 times in less than two minutes, accompanied by Depeche Mode-style sequencers. She gives an enthusiastic testimonial of Virgo qualities—“We get things done! We get things done!”—as though narrating a quirky infomercial for the astrological sign. “Scorpio on Your Side” is similarly effusive and astrological: A sputtering synth melody cuts in and out as Moolchan (a known astrology obsessive) celebrates the perks of friendship with a particularly loyal Zodiac sign. Even with Sneaks’ expanded palette, Happy Birthday is strikingly raw. Moolchan’s refusal to bend to conventional song structure or recording techniques gives the music a sense of joyful rebellion, heightened by Moolchan’s status as a Black woman blurring the boundaries of a post-punk scene that’s still predominantly white. (“Why can’t a Black girl create?” she asks in “This World.”) But as an artist whose defining quality is economy of language and texture, she falters when her songs are packed with too much sonic stimulation. “Winter Weather” searches for a groove as Moolchan delivers an uncharacteristically wordy rap about her least favorite season. “Slightly Sophisticated” also lacks the cryptic simplicity of Sneaks’ best work, dabbling in glitchy maximalism that never quite gels. Toggle from that track to It’s a Myth’s spare, hypnotic “Look Like That” and it’s like feeling a lock slide into place. This is a familiar conundrum: How do you expand or refine a sound that subverts the very ideas of expansion and refinement? On Happy Birthday, the jagged electro-funk of “Faith” and “Scorpio on Your Side” cracks the code: bolder grooves, a few more hooks, but still the same Sneaks.

Touch the Sound,Spun Out,by: Arielle Gordon,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f3ed0c3ae9d357274563def/1:1/w_160/touch%20the%20sound_spun%20out.jpg,2020-08-24 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/spun-out-touch-the-sound/,Shuga,"The maximalist mentality that prevails throughout Touch the Sound, the debut album from the Chicago trio Spun Out, might come as a surprise to those familiar with the band’s history. Vocalist and guitarist Mikey Wells, bassist James Weir, and drummer Alex Otake first came to prominence in the punk quartet NE-HI, who were known for their taut, rubbery guitar sound and sweaty, livewire performances. Though NE-HI became more nuanced in the studio before disbanding in 2019, their defining textures remained sparse and wiry. NE-HI vocalist Jason Balla took that to one extreme with the joyful twang of Dehd, and now the rest of the band is fully committed to a new, grandiose direction. Small studio flourishes decorate each song on Touch the Sound. From the chimes and synths that open “Dark Room” to the guiro accents on “Off the Vine,” every instrument finds space in the mix. Most songs use the keyboard as their point of departure; they are as warm as Stevie Wonder’s clavichord. Shrouded under a thick electronic blanket, more eclectic choices, like the addition of an errant cowbell and tambourine on “Pretender,” feel familiar. With help from producer Josh Wells, who aided in developing the carefully layered synths of Destroyer’s ken, Spun Out evoke the spark of a jam session within the smoothed, controlled environment of the studio. The record’s internal transitions—key changes or shifting movements within a single song—feel spontaneous and easy, a mark of the half-decade of camaraderie and chemistry the band’s members have banked. That cohesion also allows for cross-genre experimentations that fit into the patchwork of Spun Out’s overall sound. The buoyant synth-pop jingle “Such Are the Lonely” feels a generation removed from the earnest, piano-driven rhythms of “Don’t Act Down,” but the snap of Otake’s drums, the wistful echo of Weir’s bass, and Wells’ croon carry them into the same universe. From that base palette, the band is freer to experiment with a rotating ensemble of studio musicians, adding a saxophone or an eerie vocal line straight out of Sonic Youth’s “Kool Thing” without running off the map entirely. Though the beat-driven psychedelia is far removed from the threadbare punk of their origins, what remains is a shared sense of trust. That faith in their collaborative process comes through in their experimentation—what could otherwise become ’80s pastiche instead feels warmly rendered. As a group joins Wells for an emphatic final coda on “Don’t Act Now,” there’s the sense that they could easily go on for another 20 minutes, or more frankly, that time doesn’t factor in much at all; that they restrain themselves to just over 40 minutes across the album seems like a knowing courtesy to their audience. If their previous band trafficked in intense minimalism, Touch the Sound is intimacy borne from abundance. Catch up every Saturday with 10 of our best-reviewed albums of the week.

Crazy Ex-Girlfriend,Miranda Lambert,by: Sam Sodomsky,Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f3ffe437315cbd6f5f54c44/1:1/w_160/crazy%20ex-girlfriend_miranda%20lambert.jpg,2020-08-23 05:00:00,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/miranda-lambert-crazy-ex-girlfriend/,Columbia,"Miranda Lambert will not tolerate beach balls at her shows. She has her reasons. The finer points change with each retelling, but here’s the gist: She’s opening for Kenny Chesney somewhere in Pennsylvania—“No beach close to here, not even a grain of sand,” she recalls—when someone in the audience lobs something buoyant and spherical toward the stage. It collides with her mic stand, busts open her lip. From that moment on, Lambert vowed to carry a small pink razor blade on stage at all times. “I’m very sorry for whoever’s ball this is,” she says in one of many videos that makes its way to YouTube in the coming years. “But it’s gonna die now.” It’s a funny tradition—perfect fodder for radio interviews and inside jokes among fans. It also symbolizes some of the qualities that have made Lambert a proud loner in 21st-century country: how she insists on playing by her own rules, how the easy-going customs that work for, say, Kenny Chesney aren’t gonna fly for her. It also happens to be a good example of the way justice is served in her music. After all, the song she remembers singing in that moment is “More Like Her,” one of the gentler tracks on her 2007 album Crazy Ex-Girlfriend. The women who narrate its other songs take to their antagonists with firearms and vengeance; they scour parking lots looking for license plates and descend on unsuspecting creeps like brutal storms. She might sound at peace but there’s a good chance the singer of “More Like Her” was already thinking about buying that razor blade. Lambert grew up in Lindale, Texas, a small town where her parents worked together as private investigators and eventually worked on Paula Jones’ 1997 sexual harassment case against Bill Clinton. For a few years, Lambert shared the house with women seeking refuge from abusive relationships. She heard their stories and paid close attention to how men weaponized their power, both in the private and public eye. Her memories from childhood involve frank discussions about her parents’ business—“Our dinner conversations were about divorce cases and who was cheatin’ on who,” she would reflect—and picturesque evenings on the porch with her father, perched on his lap with an acoustic guitar, singing country songs. Lambert started writing and performing at an early age. She sang in the school choir, which didn’t exist until she petitioned to start one. When she was 18, she released a self-titled album with songs pitched between precocious breakup ballads and hometown anthems designed to get the crowd on her side at the local honky-tonks (titles include “Texas Pride” and “Texas As Hell”). She followed the album by auditioning, at the age of 19, for the USA Network’s Nashville Star, a country reboot of American Idol. She was effortlessly charming and became a fan-favorite but Lambert was playing the long game, already thinking from a business angle. “I thought if I could make it through the original song night, then I could get a publishing deal out of it,” she explained to the Dallas Morning News. She didn’t win—she came in third—but she did make it to the original song night, where she debuted a ballad she wrote with her father called “Greyhound Bound for Nowhere.” Before her performance, she explained that people tend to not take her seriously: “I haven’t been through a lot of tough times in my life,” she concedes, noting that her songs are inspired by the stories she heard in her hometown, the people she came across, the patterns she observed—not necessarily her own experiences. “I’m gonna sing a song that’s about a woman who’s having an affair with a married person,” she says sweetly into the camera with her thick Southern drawl. “Greyhound Bound for Nowhere” would eventually appear on Kerosene, Lambert’s 2005 major-label debut. Set to a muted Southern rock chord progression, its depictions of misery and broken dreams weren’t exactly what the suits at Epic Nashville had in mind for her. Lambert insisted on writing the album herself; they wanted a hit. They started doing what major labels do, which is supplying material written by powerhouse songwriters with proven records of chart success. Lambert knew her originals were better. “I listened to 20 songs,” she explained to Texas Monthly, “and the label people said, ‘OK, you need to say yes to at least one song, because you’re starting to hurt people’s feelings.’” She says yes to one song. Otherwise, the album is written entirely by Lambert, although the brilliant title track—still among her signature songs—ends up with a Steve Earle writing credit due to similarities with his outlaw anthem “Feel Alright.” It’s a great record that helped cement a loyal fanbase. But the industry wasn’t totally on board. “I don’t get played a lot on country radio, and I don’t understand why,” she said to Texas Monthly, a few years later, despite the album’s extraordinary sales. There are a few reasons. Lambert attributed her early success to songs like Gretchen Wilson’s “Redneck Woman,” a barnburner that paved the way for hits by women who didn’t follow the path of Faith Hill’s breathless love songs or Shania Twain’s arena pop crossovers. She was also influenced by the Chicks, who followed their muse past the point where country radio was willing to follow. Lambert’s songs were catchy and immediately identifiable to her audience but they owed more to the spirit of classic country than most burgeoning artists at the time. And country radio remains a tough format for women—let alone ones with mercilessly upbeat anthems about burning men’s houses down. (At the time of Kerosene’s release, the No. 1 country single was “Bless the Broken Road” by Rascal Flatts, a song that would later be covered by a contemporary Christian band who barely had to change a word.) If Lambert felt deterred, she didn’t show it. The follow-up, Crazy Ex-Girlfriend, was even more unsparing and uncompromising than Kerosene, louder and tougher. There are three cover songs, all written by women: Gillian Welch’s “Dry Town,” Patty Griffin’s “Getting Ready,” and Carlene Carter’s “Easy From Now On,” a ballad closely associated with Emmylou Harris. Most of the songs take place in the moments immediately after heartbreak, consumed by a need for revenge—“He wants a fight, well now he’s got one,” she sings, armed at the door with a shotgun—or a rebound. “I made a point of not mixin’ love and pleasure in my life,” she sings in “Guilty in Here,” pledging to stick to that divide. Here is how Miranda Lambert’s best songs work. The verses arrive as uninterrupted trains of thought, her words flowing in a speak-sing cadence that glides through turbulent emotions and complex rhyme schemes that seem to come second-nature. She has an edge to her voice and a preference for simple, intuitive melodies that help sell ominous lines like, “Well, it’s half-past-ten, another six-pack in/And I can feel the rumble like a cold black wind.” But she also sings despairingly about more vulnerable scenes, about love letters on wet paper, leaving you to imagine the tears falling and the texture in your hand. All this work below the surface allows her choruses to hit like exclamatory onomatopoeias in a comic book. She has a knack for catchphrases: Is it guilty in here or is it just me? He ain’t seen me crazy yet! Country music is built for hooks like these, but Lambert has a way of pacing herself, furnishing her songs subtly so that she never seems like she’s pandering. As soon as she starts railing against her ex’s current flame using a “stitch/pitch” rhyme scheme, you know where it’s going. But it’s how she gets there, the little twists in her delivery, that keep you entertained. Her songs ramp up so naturally you feel like you’re riding shotgun with her, egging her on until you’re shielding your eyes. If this kind of writing aligned her with the outlaw country legends she was raised on, the glossy production aimed directly for radio play in the mid-2000s. These songs practically bounce from the speaker, bursting in the air like confetti. It wasn’t always to her taste. “I love raw albums,” she said. “I’d love to record an album in a garage and for it to sound like an old Gary Stewart album, without a bunch of overdubbed this and that. But when you’re in the mainstream, you’ve got to fit in. You’ve got to get your foot in the door first.” Even as she pushed for radio play, Lambert made sure her songs had depth. In the middle of the album, her accompanists step away for a series of ballads that form the greatest work of her early career. The barroom lament of “Love Letters” showed she could write her own jukebox standards, while “Desperation,” with its gently anxious arrangement and lonesome harmonica part, proved that her stories rang true even when she lowered the stakes. “Complicated words slippin’ off of your tongue and ain’t one of them the truth,” she sings, and it’s one of the most damning accusations on a record that begins with threats of a gunfight. While she could have spent her career racking up the body count with more songs like “Gunpowder and Lead,” her first top 10 country hit, Lambert refused to be pigeonholed. “I feel like I was getting dangerously close to being shoved in that box of ‘She’s that crazy girl who kills people in her songs,’” she confessed to The Los Angeles Times before the release of her follow-up album, Revolution, a commercial breakthrough and creative reset. In its songs, love is still full of pain and deceit and people are not to be trusted. She covered John Prine at the end of the record because she figured he’d agree with this outlook. Like Prine, she saw the span of life as ugly enough retribution. “I kill them a little more softly this time around,” is how she put it. The success of Revolution kickstarted a prolific and fruitful decade of music. She made a full-blown country-pop blockbuster (2014’s Platinum) and that raw, live-sounding album she dreamed about (2016’s The Weight of These Wings). She was in and out of the tabloids for high-profile relationships; she has had success and failure with country radio. She started a dog sanctuary and a clothing line. She also founded the supergroup Pistol Annies with her friends Ashley Monroe and Angaleena Presley, a band that remains one of country music’s most reliable side projects. She found stability, the missing thing that keeps the characters on Crazy Ex-Girlfriend in motion, the hunger that makes it sound so empowering and alive, years later. I think about “Desperation” and the last line of each chorus: “I’m still desperate for you.” Like all the songs, it’s an attempt to describe a sudden surge, a feeling at its peak. Desperation fades; anger subsides; heartbreak heals. Lambert sings knowing she’s got something up her sleeve for whatever comes next. Get the Sunday Review in your inbox every weekend.

everything means nothing,blackbear,by: Dani Blum ,Contributor ,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f3ff9dcf6eb11025fede860/1:1/w_160/everythng%20means%20nothing_blackbear.jpg,2020-08-22 05:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/blackbear-everything-means-nothing/,BeartrapAlamoInterscope,"In Naoise Dolan’s recent novel Exciting Times, a noteworthy addition to the canon of millennial popular literature (think: Sally Rooney, lipsticked characters wielding laptops, plots about climate change and gender politics), Instagram Stories function as a narrative device. Dolan’s protagonist agonizes over whether to open a love interest’s story, worrying what it could signify if she’s seen viewing it. Technology is baked into the novel’s emotional framework, an extension of its characters’ brooding. It’s less an attempt to pander to a younger audience than it is an authentic representation of how it feels to live while anchored to at least two screens. In flickering moments, the rap-pop singer and producer blackbear reaches for that realism, too, narrating his relationships with the pulsing hyperactivity of the always-online. “Block my posts and my story,” he wails on the strum-heavy “queen of broken hearts.” “I’m sorry I can be annoying.” He doesn’t know what to do with a phone full of videos and photos of his ex. “Cracks in my heart/Got cracks in my phone,” he moans on the wincingly titled “sobbing in cabo.” But blackbear’s latest album, everything means nothing, is also gracelessly Too Online, like a person explaining a meme, or verbalizing the words “heart emoji.” He speaks in hashtags. He regurgitates memes and stale tweets, slathering them in Auto-Tune and bleating them over beat drops. “Turn a big mood to a big mood swing,” he raps on “clown.” “You made me want to live, laugh, love, and now I want to die,” he howls on “i felt that,” as a diet trop-house beat shimmies under him. The album opens with “hot girl bummer,” a snarling bastardization of Megan Thee Stallion’s meme-turned-song released just two weeks after hers. In his version, women vomit into Birkins and sleep with strangers; they “buy [their] lips and buy [their] legs,” and, apparently, ignore blackbear. The soggy self-pity gets old fast. “You’re so good/At making me feel bad,” he complains in the chorus of “i feel bad,” then clumsily doubles down: “You’re like a college grad that majored in the art of fucking over everything we had.” He moans about how he doesn’t want to have emotions; he yelps through Auto-Tune about how weak he feels, how the anonymous women haunting these songs are “punishing” him. All of it is rooted in a constant, stupefying misogyny. “Shoulda seen right through the gap between her thighs,” he rasps on the dubstep-flecked “half alive.” The plodding “why are girls?” doesn’t even attempt to disguise its inanity: “Why are girls so hot?/Take everything I’ve got,” he babbles. “Why are girls so cold? Why are girls so, why are girls so beautiful?” everything means nothing feels like a time capsule for this awful, cursed year, a nauseating sludge of every “Study Beats” playlist on Spotify and every TikTok influencer-turned-pop-star’s attempt at writing a hit. Both Lauv, the 26-year-old pop singer who croons about loneliness, and Trevor Daniel, who scored a viral hit on TikTok in 2019, show up for guest spots; their slumped, algorithm-friendly pop, with its pitched vocals and skittery production flourishes, is the album’s dominant influence. blackbear’s songs aren’t trying to express an emotion, or even to come across as relatable—their main goal is to remind you of something else. “Oh, right,” you’re meant to think, listening to a meme from three months ago ooze into your headphones, “this again.” Catch up every Saturday with 10 of our best-reviewed albums of the week.

Bent Arcana,Various Artists,by: Louis Pattison,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f3fe97c42e07aad86ac9098/1:1/w_160/bent%20arcana_bent%20arcana.jpg,2020-08-22 05:00:00,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/bent-arcana-bent-arcana/,Castle Face,"John Dwyer likes to keep Discogs editors busy. Over the last couple of decades, the Oh Sees guitarist and bandleader has founded a string of often short-lived projects—Pink and Brown, Damaged Bug, Zeigenbock Kopf—while also turning out a steady stream of music with his best-known group (which might also be written as Thee Oh Sees, or OSees, or OCS, depending on whim, day of the week, phase of the moon, and so on). You get the sense that Dwyer’s slippery approach to identity is guided by his puckish streak, but there’s a method, too: Each new name offers an opportunity to view his firecracker creativity from a fresh angle. So it is with Bent Arcana, which is shorthand for the band’s official name: Ryan Sawyer, Peter Kerlin, Kyp Malone, Brad Caulkins, Tom Dolas, Marcos Rodriguez, Laena “Geronimo” Myers-Ionita, Joce Soubiran, Andres Renteria, and John Dwyer. Recent Oh Sees records have augmented the group’s garage-punk attack with a looser, jammier sensibility, and now Dwyer is going all in, assembling a sprawling ensemble drawn from the worlds of jazz and avant-garde improvisation. It doesn’t quite feel right to call it a “supergroup”—that suggests a certain level of name recognition, and the closest you get here to star material is TV On The Radio’s Kyp Malone, holding it down on modular synth. The lineup favors underground heads, all apparently selected for their technical mastery and taste for live experimentation: Brooklyn drummer-for-hire Ryan Sawyer, Sunwatchers bassist Peter Kerlin, saxophonists Joce Soubiran and Brad Caulkins, and violinist Laena “Geronimo” Myers-Ionita. Bent Arcana is Dwyer’s way to break free from the shackles of songcraft and lose himself in the ocean of group creativity. The six tracks of Bent Arcana’s self-titled debut are excerpted from five days of extended improvisation at Dwyer’s own Stu-Stu-Studio recording space. The mood is freeform and exploratory in a distinctly 1970s vein: think electric Miles Davis, the furiously complex jazz fusion of Mahavishnu Orchestra, and the funkier end of krautrock. If you heard much of this music blind, you’d struggle to date it. Hitting play on “Misanthrope Gets Lunch” feels like being dropped in midway through some long-lost Can live performance: a “Mother Sky”-style drumbeat rises and falls, feints and tumbles, as plectrums scrape along strings and a modular synth chokes out clouds of static. Though Dwyer calls Bent Arcana “frenetic” in his liner notes for the album, it generally lacks the pugilistic attitude of much of his work. Opening track “The Gate” is swampy and restrained, with drums set to a low simmer, and snakish guitar and saxophone keeping loose and low. Perhaps it’s the title, but “Outré Sorcellerie” has a whiff of the occult; its shadowy improv will be familiar to fans of the influential Euro-jazz label ECM, as a lonely saxophone weaves through a gloomy antechamber of chimes and bass. Though Bent Arcana can sag in its less propulsive moments, the band generally hits the right ratio between eerie investigation and chunky jams. A highlight in the latter style is “Oblivion Sigil,” 11 minutes of bass-and-drums shuffle with Dwyer adding the occasional acrobatic guitar scrawl. The record’s most melodically memorable moment comes in “Mimi,” a gorgeous but disappointingly brief saxophone duet, over in a blink-and-you’ll-miss-it 84 seconds. Dwyer has hinted this might be the first chapter in a series of releases dedicated to this off-the-cuff approach. You wouldn’t want his new band to nudge out his more song-powered releases, but given his exceptional work rate, there’s probably not much danger of that. Though Bent Arcana is certainly an ensemble effort, it also stands as an example of yet another style that Dwyer’s more or less nailed. If you’re going to dispense with songwriting, here’s the best way to do it—assemble a band of extraordinary players, hit on a groove, and follow it wherever it takes you.

Imploding the Mirage,The Killers,by: Alfred Soto,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f3abc5072e13ea74d40027d/1:1/w_160/imploding%20the%20mirage_the%20killers.jpg,2020-08-21 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/the-killers-imploding-the-mirage/,Island,"To understand how far queer culture has come in public acceptance, look no further than the immaculately coiffed, straight, Las Vegas Mormon striving to live down every one of those adjectives. Since 2004’s Hot Fuss, Brandon Flowers of the Killers has chipped away at his weaknesses. From the ambisexual roundelay of “Somebody Told Me” and the way he stressed the rival “beautiful boy” in “When You Were Young,” to the cheeky interpolation of Bronski Beat’s epochal he’s-leaving-home anthem “Smalltown Boy” on his solo track “I Can Change,” Flowers has telegraphed a primal longing: Why didn’t God make him a gay musician? Instead, God made Flowers a singer-keyboardist who sets his larynx ablaze from the effort of caring. He writes songs for the young dreamers who hope to be rhinestone cowboys; he wants to see thousands of Brandon Flowers bloom. As tacky and bombastic as a Fourth of July celebration, Imploding the Mirage has more bangers than a Killers album should 16 years after their debut and without copping to “maturity.” This band remains as absurd—marvelously so—as ever. How quarantine may enervate this most arena of rock bands we don’t know; for now, though, Imploding the Mirage, with key production and songwriting assists from Jonathan Rado, gives no indication Flowers has downsized his ambition to make the loudest, grandest rock album in an era that sees too few of them. The man who allowed the queer-ish dance act Pet Shop Boys to remix “Read My Mind” also adores early Bruce Springsteen: the riffs, the scale, the penchant for florid twaddle. But Flowers doesn’t write Springsteen songs, he writes concordances to Springsteen songs, set to pillowy synths and with drummer Ronnie Vannucci Jr.’s beats frisky enough for audiences aware of but not infatuated with dance music—like, say, Springsteen’s. Girls still excite him here—the ones who smoke cigarettes and “breathe in the blowback” and “fight back.” And the Killers are liberated, sort of. “I’m throwin’ caution,” Flowers wails on the first single, abbreviating “throwing” like an honor roll Springsteen student. Is that Can’s “Moonshake” in the nervous opening tap-tap of “Dying Breed”? Does he really sing, “What kind of words would cut through the clutter of the whirlwind of these days?” on “My Own Soul’s Warning”? Smile like you mean it, Brandon! Applying the lessons learned about sustained ecstasy from previous producer Stuart Price, the Killers sequence Imploding the Mirage so that the circumference of each mushroom cloud of a song expands as the album goes on. “My God,” a prayer and exultation, corrals a choir and Weyes Blood doing their “All These Things That I’ve Done” thing while Flowers pushes his voice toward tones and stresses unheard by mortal man, all for the sake of the adage: “Don’t push/Control is overrated.” Then he loses control again on the next track, the glistening “When the Dreams Run Dry.” In 2004, when the Killers released “Somebody Told Me” and especially “Mr. Brightside,” the embrace of their wobbly, lurid Technicolor psychodramas coincided with the post-Napster generation’s discovery of a version of the 1980s their older siblings shunned. Flowers may even own a stack of CD-Rs on which songs with gated drums and synth strings compete with a singer determined to outsing and out-hair them both: bands like, who knows, Survivor. In other words, Flowers likes the tacky ’80s; he remains a Las Vegas boy born with eyes sharpened by neon. But here’s the difference: Rather than record treacly updates of  “The Search Is Over,” his mission is to find the Neil Tennant in Survivor, as much a quixotic mission as a genuine what-the-fuck moment: a cishet performer who queers anonymous Wembley Stadium tubthumping with bizarre word combinations. After a few listens to the new album, I couldn’t tell you what “imploding the mirage” means. Whether Flowers knows himself is worth debating. The brio is the point. Sixteen years after Hot Fuss, the Killers benefit from a gradual acceptance of gender fluidity, sheer grinding persistence, and, thanks to COVID, an aversion to male hair trimmings that results in an Icehouse-era generosity. No one quite sounds like them in 2020. No one will sound like them in 2031. They remain inscrutable and delirious, trying for big, cool with small. As he puts it on the title track, “Sometimes it takes a little courage and doubt/To push your boundaries out beyond your imaginings.” Get comfortable aging alongside Flowers as his Talmudic wisdom deepens.

Show Pony EP,Orville Peck,by: Cat Zhang,Executive Editorial Assistant,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f3ab797440413c8eae32285/1:1/w_160/show%20pony_orville%20peck.jpg,2020-08-21 05:00:00,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/orville-peck-show-pony-ep/,Columbia,"When Orville Peck croons about young men crying, he never reaches the word “cry.” He halts just before it, the silence hanging over what’s implied. On the surface, the enigmatic country singer is steely and collected, assuming the stoic veneer of the American cowboy. He shrouds himself in fringed leather masks, concealing all but his striking blue eyes. He sings about Marlboros in a rich, stately baritone that evokes Roy Orbison and Elvis. But Peck is gay and Canadian, and the glimmering torch songs on his 2019 debut, Pony, underscored the latent homoeroticism of the Old West—the undying commitment between a “lone” ranger and his trusty partner, streaking through ghost towns side-by-side. His outlaw persona toys with contradictions. Country music may be stereotyped as conservative, but Peck is seduced by another facet: its rhinestones and camp, the decadent flair of Gram Parson’s Nudie suit. For decades, the cowboy has been a beacon for those who see their own loneliness reflected in the figure’s migratory lifestyle and estrangement. Though Orville Peck is a pseudonym, the singer believes it’s his most sincere project, “the most exposed that I’ve ever been.” But the contemporary trend for rodeo aesthetics has encouraged skeptics to receive Peck—a former punk musician who drummed in the Vancouver trio Nü Sensae—as a gimmick. “Call it country (like Lil Nas X did), and you can compel people to talk and listen,” one critic contended. The more “yeehaws” in advertising copy and bolo ties on the red carpet, the less convincing a Western act may seem. Part of what spared Pony from seeming hollow was its vivid detailing—the velvet gloves of the rodeo queen, the violent sister “strik[ing] gold” on someone’s eyes, the failed love affairs with the rider, the boxer, the jailer. The album’s particularities gave shape to ballooning emotions, the bliss of a heady dare like “baby, let’s get high.” In that context, the cowboy identity seemed less like a gimmick than a metaphor, a matter of emotional and existential framing. By comparison, the original songs on Peck’s latest Show Pony EP are more vague. “Summertime,” the opener, is a wistful callback to a better season, anchored around a sad observation: “You and I/Bide our time.” But the stock coloring of the verses, which talk of “riding into the night” and “chasing the horizon,” pales against the eerie canyon roads and anguished memories of past singles like “Dead of Night.” Show Pony’s most evocative original is the classic rock winddown “Drive Me, Crazy.” Two truckers ride out their days in an 18-wheeler, “November Rain” on the radio, as Peck relives their relationship with knowing fatalism: “Burning rubber wherever we go/Looking back on the orange glow.” The enduring image of two mavericks weathering the wilderness together recalls a touching observation from the poet Rainer Maria Rilke: that most noble task that two people could undertake is to “stand guard over the solitude of the other.” In Orville Peck’s world, the bond rarely lasts, but you can save the memory for later. He shares a similar comportment with Lana Del Rey, another artist who speeds forward, casting glances at what she’s left in her wake. The spare guitar ballad “No Glory for the West” harkens to Del Rey’s obsession with waning grandeur and the frail seams of American mythology. “Ridin’ past the best/And there’s still no rest,” Peck laments. The EP’s two wild cards are both tributes to female country stars. The closer is a burly cover of Bobbie Gentry’s “Fancy,” which is interesting as an implied drag performance. But the overwhelming fullness of Peck’s voice becomes wearisome; he sacrifices sprightliness and wit in his delivery for growling power. Accentuated with bells, thuds, tambourine, and a sputtering guitar solo, Gentry’s lively tale about a girl escaping poverty through sex work takes on the melodrama of musical theater. The narrowness—or specificity, depending on your perspective—of Peck’s act already invites charges of being stiltedly one-note; the hamminess doesn’t help. The Shania Twain duet “Legends Never Die,” meanwhile, is more pop and less “authentic”-sounding than what Peck usually attempts, but it’s truer to his playful vision of country as an outlet for fabulousness and glamour. In the music video, Peck steps onstage at a drive-in theater when Twain prowls forward in a leopard-print catsuit, sparkly fringe dripping down her sleeves—a callback to her iconic “That Don’t Impress Me Much” video. The two singers end up sharing the stage, swapping boasts in a cheeky, confident duet. “Takin’ orders never been my style,” Peck sings lightheartedly. Their tossed-out asides and easygoing camaraderie is delightful. For once, the lonesome cowboy doesn’t seem so solitary. Catch up every Saturday with 10 of our best-reviewed albums of the week.

Spinner,Brian EnoJah Wobble,by: Ben Cardew,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f3ad00c0924f817891ad8a1/1:1/w_160/spinner_brian%20eno%20jah%20wobble.jpg,2020-08-21 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/brian-eno-jah-wobble-spinner/,All Saints,"Rather than simply releasing the music he had recorded for Derek Jarman's 1994 film Glitterbug, Brian Eno handed over the score to bassist Jah Wobble, encouraging him to do with it as he pleased, with the results released in 1995 as Spinner. Wobble—born John Wardle—wasn’t any old bass player: His cavernous dub bass lines lifted Public Image Ltd. out of the Sex Pistols’ considerable shadow. By 1994, he was an artist of some repute, having led his Invaders of the Heart, a globe-trotting collective of musical mavericks, to the middle reaches of the British charts. All the same, you can picture the flicker of delight that must have traced across Eno’s brow when he received back his musical cues alternatively untouched (“Garden Recalled”), employed as the basis for entirely new tracks (“Steam”), and accompanied by Wobble’s bass pressure (“Like Organza”). “I didn't even hear it all till it was finished,” Eno told The Wire in September 1995 of Spinner’s recording. “Everything that he [Wobble] put on, he produced. Anything you hear looming around in the back is probably what I produced…” That “probably” is important. Spinner—which is being reissued in an expanded edition—fills an intriguingly permissive space in the Eno catalog, where he stepped back from his own strict editorial criteria and placed himself “in the hands of Jah.” Spinner comes from synergy and collectivism rather than individual inspiration, an impression reinforced by this reissue, which adds “Stravinsky” (an original Eno track from the much bootlegged Glitterbug soundtrack) and “Lockdown” (a new song by Wobble) to the collected canon. Spinner is also an outlier in the Eno catalog for its pulsating low end, a rarity for a producer who was more audibly influenced by the spaces of dub rather than its bass textures. “Like Organza” is the perfect example of how this musical tag-teaming works. Nothing much actually happens in the song: Eno (presumably) brings the chiming of a bell and a drone-y organ, to which Wobble adds a serpentine bass line, which curls around the melody like a warm dog’s embrace. For two-and-three-quarter minutes, all is well in the world, as if the perfect harmony of bass and melody has temporarily restored cosmic stability. At other times, Wobble’s direction is notably more maximalist. On “Unusual Balance” he employs metallic guitar, drums locked in a haltering reggae two step, and the electrifying voice of Iranian-born vocalist Sussan Deyhim to create a dubbed-out Middle-Eastern space metal, while Eno’s contribution is seemingly reduced to a few stray piano notes littered around the background. “Transmitter and Trumpet,” meanwhile, mixes up Can’s Jaki Liebezeit on heavily-processed drums with other-worldly atmospherics; the tent-peg-solid three-note bassline balances this eight minutes of kosmische drift that sits somewhere between the Orb and Can’s own adventure in reggae on 1976’s Flow Motion. The upshot of this wild collaborative fever is that Spinner’s weaker numbers are those—like “Garden Recalled” and “Space Diary 1”—where Eno’s original work is left untouched, their glassy textures a little cold in comparison to the fervent musical madness around them. Given Wobble’s work on the rest of this album, though, you trust him that these songs were better left untouched and Spinner’s excellent sequencing allows them to serve as a palate cleanser between contrasting musical flavors. Spinner’s cosmopolitan influences and improbable origin means it often gets overlooked among the labyrinthine Eno catalog. It’s not quite ambient; it’s not exactly dub; it’s not even really a Brian Eno production. And yet there is something invigorating in this album’s refusal to conform. Eno, a man known for his career left-turns, cerebral innovation and nonconformist working attitudes, once called it “a very strange record”. And coming from him, that’s quite a compliment.

The Neon,Erasure,by: Robert Ham,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f3abe840924f817891ad89f/1:1/w_160/the%20neon_erasure.jpg,2020-08-21 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/erasure-the-neon/,Mute,"Of the artists to emerge from the first big wave of UK synth-pop acts in the ’80s, Erasure is one of the few still standing. Along the way, singer Andy Bell and synth fanatic Vince Clarke have weathered all manner of highs and lows—from their commercial peak in the late ’80s and early ’90s, when they landed four consecutive albums at the top of the British charts, to Bell’s 2004 announcement that he had been diagnosed with HIV nearly seven years earlier. Most impressive is the continued quality of their music. By mostly sticking to their chosen lane—Clarke’s glitzy, club-ready electronics as backdrop to Bell’s beguiling voice and lyrics of emotional enchantment and anguish—the duo amassed an impressive collection of good-to-great albums. Their streak was broken only in 2017 with World Be Gone, a dour record tainted by slower tempos and existential fears fueled by an ugly political present. While it steers in the right direction, Erasure’s latest full-length The Neon doesn’t quite get the pair back on track. The album is a deliberate effort to return to the sounds and mood of the material that first made them pop sensations: Clarke reached for the analog synths he’s had since the duo’s earliest days, and Bell describes the new album as “going back to the beginning.” In its best moments, like the gooey, glammy “Nerves of Steel” and the disco blurt of “Diamond Lies,” The Neon provides a flicker of the same electric charge found in early hits like “Sometimes” and “Chains of Love.” But Erasure mostly don’t reach those same heights. Though it’s often frothy and fun, The Neon is really the sound of settling—into middle age, into committed relationships, and into their place in musical history. Throughout, Bell takes on the tone of an elder statesman, offering pleas of care and caution either to the younger men in his orbit or to a younger version of himself. “There’s a sweetness in your eyes/You better take my good advice/You’d better keep away from them,” he sings over a blowsy Moog melody on lead single “Hey Now (Think I Got the Feeling).” On album closer “Kid You’re Not Alone,” Clarke’s mid-tempo pulses and quick-fading synth surges mirror a lyric that serves as warning on how indulgence in “earthly delights” can lead to shame and regret. Bell has long distinguished himself from his dance-music peers by singing more of romance and lasting love than hedonism or easy thrills. On The Neon, that tender-hearted quality comes alive in tracks like “New Horizons,” a stirring torch song about weathering life’s storms beside a loved one, and “Careful What I Try to Do,” a bouncy, bubblegum tune that’s flush with the delight of new romance. But the album fails to truly surprise. Were it not for Bell’s thicker, throatier vocals, there would be little to distinguish tracks like “Shot a Satellite” and “Hey Now” from those on 1997’s Cowboy or 1994’s I Say I Say I Say. Erasure clearly are open to updating their classic sound, as on 2014’s The Violet Flame, where co-producer Richard X helped add a sharp, icy sheen to their otherwise effervescent tunes. They even presented a different perspective on the bleak World Be Gone by re-recording the album with Belgian neo-classical ensemble Echo Collective for 2018’s World Beyond. And each man’s activities outside of Erasure—Bell’s theatrical work, and Clarke’s left-field collaborations with Orbital’s Paul Hartnoll and Heaven 17’s Martyn Ware—proves that they can push themselves beyond the tried-and-true. The Neon nestles the duo back into their musical comfort zone when they’re exceedingly capable of more. Catch up every Saturday with 10 of our best-reviewed albums of the week.

"Down in the Weeds, Where the World Once Was",Bright Eyes,by: Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,"https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f35b6842c4729486dbcb73e/1:1/w_160/Down%20in%20the%20Weeds,%20Where%20the%20World%20Once%20Was_bright%20eyes.jpg",2020-08-20 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/bright-eyes-down-in-the-weeds-where-the-world-once-was/,Dead Oceans,"This—[gestures broadly]—is happening, and Conor Oberst is singing over a “Hotline Bling”-type beat. The uncanny moment occurs almost halfway through Bright Eyes’ 10th album, Down in the Weeds, Where the World Once Was. “The world went down in flames and man-made caves,” the beloved Omaha bandleader sings on “Pan and Broom,” backed by the sort of rudimentary drum-machine clicks that powered Drake’s world-conquering 2015 smash. Though the musical setting is contemporary, the message is familiar for Bright Eyes, with lyrics that are as personal as they are apocalyptic. In between a push down the stairs and a flight to Tulum, Oberst’s narrator uses the titular pan and broom to sweep up his dreams. Since rising up out of the flat and corny Midwest in 1995 like a quivery-voiced derecho storm, Bright Eyes have never shied away from the maudlin, a tendency that once caused non-teenagers to look down their noses. In recent years, as Oberst has focused on solo projects and other collaborations, the band’s cultural status has solidified: Post Malone interpolated them for Young Thug, Mac Miller covered them, Lil Peep sampled them. Oberst is now bandmates with Phoebe Bridgers, in their open-hearted folk-rock duo Better Oblivion Community Center. And the 1975’s Matt Healy, for one, endorses those scare-quoted mid-’00s “new Dylan” comparisons. Bright Eyes have belatedly found critical acceptance as a kind of musical rite of passage for smart, sensitive youths. That’s not faint praise, but it still seems to sell them short as their first wave of fans age into their 30s and 40s. The emotional outpourings of a wunderkind are easy to dismiss as raw passion. With Down in the Weeds, the painstaking craft of Oberst and the other two longtime Bright Eyes members—producer Mike Mogis and multi-instrumentalist Nate Walcott—is on vivid display. As related in innumerable quarantine interviews, the band deliberately ransacked disparate aspects from their back-catalog: lush orchestral pop, twangy Americana, warped electronic textures, blown-out distortion, tremulous whispers-to-a-scream. Flea plays slap bass on several tracks and never raises an eyebrow. Rather than try to recapture lost youth, as their tour through past sounds might imply, the group glories in incipient middle age. Oberst, who has recently gone through a divorce and the death of his brother, brings that perspective to his ornate but piercing lyrics. You can scream along to Down in the Weeds, but also quietly appreciate it—a testament to the artistry that went into this Bright Eyes album and all the others from which it draws. Almost every song here shoves interpersonal woes against societal angst in a fundamentally Bright Eyes way. On the bizarro wedding-dance swooner “One and Done,” before pointing at “the masochists all celebrating love,” Oberst mentions “the final field recording from the loud Anthropocene,” and that lofty sense of doom suffuses the record. Standout “To Death’s Heart (In Three Parts)” links visceral introspection (Oberst asks, “What’s it like to live with me here/Every fucking day?”) with the tragic 2015 attacks on the Bataclan in Paris and, as if moving by dream logic, Pink Floyd’s “Wish You Were Here.” “All these same fears/Year after year,” Oberst sings, paraphrasing the classic-rock standard. It’s an apt mission statement for Bright Eyes’ return: Age hasn’t dimmed the relevance of their existential anxieties. Or, as Oberst told an interviewer, “I take no joy in being right about all of this stuff.” The specters of Oberst’s ex-wife and late brother hang over the proceedings. The first voice on the album is the Spanish-language, spoken-word lilt of Corina Figueroa Escamilla, who still shares two dogs with Oberst, on a ragtime- and mushrooms-inspired opener that establishes the audacious, très-Bright-Eyes scope of the record. The folk-rock romp “Tilt-A-Whirl” begins with Oberst singing, “My phantom brother came to me.” A queasy Marxophone interlude can’t lighten the misery: “Life’s a solitary song,” the lifelong singer sings, “no one to clap or sing along.” On another highlight, the melancholic “Stairwell Song,” Oberst constructs a specific-yet-ambiguous story that could address either lost partner, or neither. He concludes with a wink, howling “You like cinematic endings” as a triumphant swell of horns and strings cues the credits. Not all of the satisfactions of Down in the Weeds are so baroque. Joined by a gospel choir on the comparatively buoyant “Forced Convalescence,” Oberst is hilarious as he sings about “catastrophizing” his 40th birthday, and the inability to escape from “housework, or the bank clerk, or the priest.” On the piano ballad “Hot Car in the Sun,” Oberst might be “dreaming of my ex-wife’s face,” or having sad visions of overheating dogs, but in the real world he’s just chopping celery for soup: “Didn’t have much else to do,” he confides. On the wide-screen finale, “Comet Song,” he sets out a household scene that’s uncomfortably easy to picture: “You clenched your fist/You threw the dish/And called me Peter Pan/Your aim’s not very accurate.” The whole of this album is more than the sum of the parts, but the parts can still be devastating. But Down in the Weeds falters when it loses touch with its essential grandiosity, in a handful of songs that feel more like standalones than threads in a tapestry. “Dance and Sing,” a jaunty and well-earned call for love and endurance, is more easily digestible than many songs here, but also less dazzling. The most conventional pick among the pre-release singles, the slick stadium-rocker “Mariana Trench,” also works well enough, its lyrical purview spanning from Mt. Everest to “your other brother’s grave,” but doesn’t reach into the next level of detail that raises goosebumps elsewhere. Down in the Weeds, recorded before the global pandemic, suits the daily desolation of lockdown. It also makes me regret that Oberst can’t perform these songs live, where young fans and old could form bonds as lasting with them as with Bright Eyes’ past staples. On “Nothing Gets Crossed Out,” a confessional from the 2002 classic Lifted, Oberst worried aloud about the future, singing, “I’m just too afraid of all this change.” Down in the Weeds begins with the vow, “Got to change like your life is depending on it,” and peaks about the point where Oberst looks back on his psychic aches and stutters, “All that’s constant is that change.” Running over the same old ground, Bright Eyes have found the same old fears. Wish they were here. Catch up every Saturday with 10 of our best-reviewed albums of the week.

Songs for the General Public,The Lemon Twigs,by: Sophie Kemp ,Contributor ,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f3aba2372e13ea74d40027a/1:1/w_160/Songs%20for%20the%20General%20Public_the%20lemon%20twigs.jpg,2020-08-20 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/the-lemon-twigs-songs-for-the-general-public/,4AD,"The Lemon Twigs, the project of brothers Michael and Brian D’Addario, are a classic-rock vampire act. Cloaked in the sequins and skin-tight leather of the axe-wielding ’70s, their latest album plays like a bit: Think of them as the Zoomer version of the Darkness in the way they gleefully joust with rock’s macho past. An over-the-top and occasionally frustrating listen, Songs for the General Public is a gaudy, tongue-in-cheek patchwork. The D’Addario brothers are meticulous songwriters who channel inspiration from Ziggy Stardust and Marc Bolan; fussy, baroque and extremely complicated, their music glows beneath black lights and is drenched in sexuality. On their third album, the arrangements have become more refined and almost neurotically precise. Where their last record was a concept album about a monkey raised by humans, the new one is more thematically free-associative, populated by tough guys, nutty poets, and the occasional leather fiend. On the tightly conceived “Hell on Wheels,” black Cadillac Eldorados blaze through the streets as competing strings and jangly piano keys balloon to Michelin Man proportions. The D’Addario brothers sound like they’re running through a revolving door, breathlessly switching between Bob Dylan and Mick Jagger impersonations as they take each lap. On Songs for the General Public, songs constantly go in unexpected, devilish directions. Take “Moon,” which starts with a harmonica solo and somehow transitions into full Elton John balladry by the song’s midpoint. The D’Addarios compare the moon to a giant toenail in the sky and rhyme “We resent people with lives” with “We resent tall guys.” The song is stuffed with ideas, almost to a fault. While such excess can be exhilarating, it’s sometimes hard to parse exactly who the Lemon Twigs are and what they really want to say. They slingshot their way through so many different influences, it can feel like they aren’t fully grounded. What is crucial is that they do everything with levity. Just take a song like the operatic “Fight,” which infuses anthemic elements of Bruce Springsteen and Queen into a tight three-minute sprint while also making time to lament the woes of a middle aged man who wants to feel “beautiful again,” and really isn’t in a great spot with his old lady. Or perhaps “Ashamed,” an oddly touching ballad about a “brother and sister who make it with each other,” speckled with acoustic guitars and delicate strings that evoke the warmth of the Velvet Underground. More often than not, listening to Songs for the General Public feels like watching the D’Addario brothers throw old ’45s at a brick wall to see what sticks, snickering all the while. They want you to have a good time, and they sound tighter than ever; they just need to figure out how to control the Frankenstein that they’ve made.

Blush,Maya Hawke,by: Peyton Thomas,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f3ac27672e13ea74d40027f/1:1/w_160/blush_maya%20hawke.jpg,2020-08-20 05:00:00,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/maya-hawke-blush/,Mom + Pop,"Every once in a blue moon there emerges from the crowded field of car-crashing celebrity children a legitimate talent. A Carrie Fisher, say, or a Ronan Farrow: some rare, shining light who burns through our deep-seated aversion to nepotism by working hard and doing good. With her debut LP, Blush, which arrives on the heels of her star turn in last summer’s season of Stranger Things, Maya Hawke—actor, model, and daughter of Uma Thurman and Ethan Hawke—makes a convincing case for her own place on this rarefied list. She is not the first Hollywood heiress to gun for indie cred—for the longest time, I thought Frankie Cosmos was a broke kid from Brooklyn—but her move into music has been refreshingly thoughtful and understated. There is no entitlement or ostentation in Blush. Hawke wrote the lyrics for each track herself, proving herself a gifted explorer of the many forms love can take. Stunning standout “Hold the Sun” is the sort of song parents sing to rock their babies to sleep, and “Goodbye Rocketship” is a lullaby in reverse, sung from child to parent. Here, Hawke forgives a parent who did their best: “You didn’t know how to raise me any more than I knew how to grow up.” There is a striking emotional maturity in Hawke’s move toward reconciliation, which continues on “River Like You.” The song seems, at first, to condemn a friend who “rushed into my belly and clouded over my eyes.” But Hawke is not laying the blame at this person’s feet. “I’m a river, too,” she sings, and she’s “tamed the moss upon the rocks, and molded the red clay.” The song becomes a hand extended from one dysfunctional person to another, in an effort to heal together. Other songs are especially poignant, given the context of their release in a pandemic. The record was finished late last year, but Hawke seems to have predicted the phenomenon of loving and caring from afar. She relies, in the lyrics of “Coverage,” on dreams and wishes, tells us that she’s not “really here.” Lead single “By Myself” is both an anthem for the present moment and for anyone who has, perhaps, been a little unsettled by how easily they adjusted to said moment. “I’m playing with myself,” she sings on the first chorus, and alters the verb on each repetition: “talking to myself,” “dreaming of myself,” “beating up myself.” This narrator is used to loneliness; prefers it, even. “I prefer my dreams of you,” she sings, “to anything you’d ever do.” Hawke’s voice is beautiful. It is soulful, featherlight, a natural fit for the careful Laurel Canyon arrangements that make up most of the record. Producer Jesse Harris takes care not to smooth out her natural rasp, and often records her as though she’s practicing ASMR. At its best, on a seductive kiss-off like “So Long” or the yearning closer “Mirth,” this technique lets you feel like you’re in the room with her. That said, her voice isn’t built for the Joplin swagger of “Animal Enough.” It is not enhanced by the backing of a chorus of children on multiple tracks. The kids are charming, if a little grating, on the whimsical “Cricket,” but they are wildly out of place in the dark, brooding dreamscape of “Menace.” Even these missteps, though, are evident of a compelling urge to experiment. Blush is a record of impressive variety, both in sentiment and sound. Some of the riskier arrows fall far off the mark, but more often than not, Hawke hits her targets with verve and style.

Twice as Tall,Burna Boy,by: Mankaprr Conteh,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f3a9cab1a3bcf0f8e690164/1:1/w_160/twice%20as%20tall_burna%20boy.jpg,2020-08-19 05:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/burna-boy-twice-as-tall/,Atlantic,"As a child, like many children, Damini Ebunoluwa Ogulu was fascinated by superhero comics. He wanted to be his own superhero, so he named himself Burna Boy, a moniker that has followed him into a career as one of the defining musical acts of today’s African diaspora. Last November, after his fourth studio album African Giant permeated the summer from Abuja to Brooklyn, he sold out London’s Wembley Arena. Now, just a year after African Giant, Burna returns with Twice as Tall, and with it, a more resonant origin story—one that explains his ascent from 2018’s breakthrough single “Ye.” In an accompanying motion comic, the Yoruba deity Orunmila chooses Burna to embody his “secret flame.” With it, Burna is challenged to restore the gods’ faith in humanity. He meets these Black gods again, in 2020, his mission completed through his resounding success. “You make music passionately, like you are waging a war,” one tells him, proudly. Twice as Tall is Burna’s battle cry. Compared to 2018’s jovial Outside and last year’s sunnily conscious African Giant, Twice as Tall can feel heavy under the weight of Burna’s personal reflection and Pan-African crusade. His newly moody Afro-fusion—a mix of afrobeat, reggae, dancehall, hip-hop, EDM, and more—amplifies his passion. Twice as Tall could’ve aimed to crystalize Burna’s position as a global Afropop star with easier, feel-good hits. Instead, he turns starkly inward, assuring himself of his power, and outward, reminding the world of its failures and its potential. It is a load worth carrying. Burna Boy lost the 2020 Grammy for Best World Music Album to celebrated Beninese singer Angélique Kidjo, an idol and collaborator. Despite his reverence for her, the loss sickened him, as he recounts on album opener “Level Up.” As Burna—whose humility here is admirable—lists times that he’s felt small, he initiates the familiar, satisfying arc of the hero’s journey. Over Anderson .Paak’s menacing drums on “Alarm Clock,” Burna issues a warning in light Pidgin English: You’ll discover that I’m really unstoppable. The somber synths of “Way Too Big” sound like a hike up Mount Olympus. Twice as Tall is marked by Burna’s pride in his hustle, his confidence in his path, and his faith that he is favored by the divine. It’s littered with pleas to God, rebukes of the Devil, and prayers that his trek to victory will be uninterrupted. As the album ends, he and UK rapper and singer Stormzy offer a peaceful, self-assured balm with “Real Life,” before Burna settles into the might and limits of being merely human on “Bank on It.” While Burna uses the album opener to meditate on his own capacity for greatness, he reveals grander ambitions than riches and relaxation, or even personal fulfillment. He’s on a mission to fold in all corners of the diaspora, bridging colonial ruptures to illuminate a common struggle. When the album was nearly complete, Burna enlisted Diddy as an executive producer, alongside himself and his mother, Bosede Ogulu. Diddy supplies his experience as an American music mogul and adds narration that neatly stitches tracks together. “We from the same tribe. It’s Black love,” he says at the top of “Alarm Clock.” On “Monsters You Made,” Burna rages about structural violence and the ways it breeds interpersonal harm, as well as protest. He pulls at the thread that connects all oppressive regimes, from the post-war Nigeria that radicalized his hero Fela Kuti to the modern United States. With a hook from Coldplay’s Chris Martin and bombastic production that evokes an Imagine Dragons single, the song smuggles one of Burna’s most radical political messages into a record that could top the modern rock charts. The pensive tone of Twice as Tall may throw off fans of Burna’s more danceable tracks, but “Wonderful,” “Onyeka (Baby),” “Naughty by Nature,” and “Comma” offer reprieve from the album’s focus and fury, bringing the levity to an impressive mid-album stretch. Here, Burna indulges. Sure, “Onyeka” is inspired by Nigerian diva and activist Onyeka Onwenu, who hosted a striking BBC documentary about government corruption in Nigeria and was subsequently banned from seven of the country’s 36 states—but it’s really just a scampish love song. On “Naughty by Nature,” he enlists the titular rap trio, whose 1993 hit “Hip Hop Hooray” was the first song he learned word-for-word. “Comma” is the party anthem, akin to African Giant’s “Killin Dem,” and Burna has the time of his life making light of sticky situations and women’s cosmetic procedures. In an archival interview featured in Alex Gibney’s documentary on Fela Kuti, the Afrobeat trailblazer says, “As far as Africa is concerned, music cannot be for enjoyment, music has to be for revolution.” Of course, Kuti’s music was widely enjoyed, but it was also complex and challenging. On his latest LP, Burna Boy leans into this aspect of the icon’s mythos. Twice as Tall advances Burna’s political vision, and is frankly less fun than the two recent projects that catapulted him to superstardom. But the world is less fun than it was a year ago, too. Society could use a hero, a godsend. Pairing rhythms that possess the hips with encouraging calls for Black unity and an infectious sense of self-reliance, Twice as Tall is Herculean.","The Nigerian superstar’s latest LP can feel heavy under the weight of his personal reflection and Pan-African crusade.

Multiply Intentions,Katya Yonder,by: Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f3ab2c3632c32cefe7eca00/1:1/w_160/multiply%20intentions_katya%20yonder.jpg,2020-08-19 05:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/katya-yonder-multiply-intentions/,Métron,"Katya Prokina thrives in liminal spaces, making music that sits between continents and states of consciousness. A decade ago, as a member of a dream-pop band called Tip Top Tellix, the Russian producer, vocalist, and classically trained violinist tried to “embody the phenomena of listening to music while falling asleep,” with pleasant-enough results. Going solo as Katya Yonder, she succeeded more fully across three eerie ambient cassettes for the St. Petersburg label Floe, culminating with 2017’s Winter Skins, a patient, drifting album that evokes a snowy mountainside glimpsed from the brink of oblivion. Yonder’s fourth album, Multiply Intentions, is her boldest effort at boundary-blurring yet. Born out of a 2018 mix for well-traveled Berlin label Métron, Multiply Intentions explores Yonder’s perspective as a native of Yekaterinburg, a former Soviet industrial hub located on the border between Europe and Asia. Spacey electronics coexist with the earthy hum of Azerbaijani folk instruments, and the lyrics traverse from Yonder’s primary Russian to Japanese, English, and French. That intercontinental concept underpins an album that’s just as absorbing for how it flits across other thresholds: between pop and experimentation, authenticity and fantasy. With spectral vocals, watery chimes, pulsing bass, and hardly any drums, Multiply Intentions captures what it might feel like to listen to music while falling asleep on the Trans-Siberian Railway, or whatever path might best lead to someplace you’ve only imagined. Although Multiply Intentions is the first Yonder album with prominent vocals, it’s more atmospheric than conventionally song-based, and not only due to the comprehension barrier for anyone who isn’t quadrilingual. Her opening words, a Russian-language declaration that she’s plunging headlong into something like an abyss, are barely audible amid Uncut Gems-like synth burbles and woodwind flutters. When Yonder’s high lilt first comes to the fore, murmuring about having “to stop for a while” over the LaserDisc science-special shimmer of “Solution,” her words are still slightly out of reach, an effect like a British folk ballad plopped down in 1980s hyperreality. “Another Time,” the most propulsive of these 14 tracks, hits harder in context than it otherwise might, because its aching synth-pop is tucked amid all this heady reflection. Multiply Intentions invites you to keep puzzling over it after listening, especially its songs that sit at especially sharp divides. “Наверняка” (“For Sure”) is coolly intoned in throaty Russian, but its hypnotic organ squiggles wouldn’t be out of place in the belly dance music of Egyptian legend Hany Mehanna. Its serenely ringing arpeggios, meanwhile, keep sending me to French duo Air’s Japan-seeking “Alone in Kyoto”—originally from the soundtrack to 2003’s Lost in Translation, aptly enough. The next track, “Invented Journey,” a centerpiece of Yonder’s 2018 mix, is the first track here with lyrics in Japanese, which Yonder studied in school. Though her engagement with the language is evident, she has never actually been to Japan. The ghostly echoes and bird-chirp sound effects of “Invented Journey” are transportive, but to someplace misty and not quite there, like trying to remember a Kate Bush song your subconscious made up overnight. Kate NV, Yonder’s fellow Russian electronic artist, is an easy comparison, but also a fitting one. With Multiply Intentions, Yonder too has made an otherworldly album that defies all borders. On the finale, “Interlude,” another lushly arrayed standout from the 2018 mix, she delivers a French translation of a German poem by a Romanian-born writer: a dreamy postcard from an undefined utopia. Long after Multiply Intentions ends, the possibility of such a place stays with you. Catch up every Saturday with 10 of our best-reviewed albums of the week.

"Ho, why is you here ?",Flo Milli,by: Stephen Kearse,Contributor,"https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f3aa032eb982d18c453e0b0/1:1/w_160/Ho,%20Why%20Is%20You%20Here?_flo%20milli.jpg",2020-08-19 05:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/flo-milli-ho-why-is-you-here/,’94 SoundsRCA,"Flo Milli raps like she was born and raised in a no-flex zone. When she claims, “None of you bitches is fuckin’ with me,” it feels less like a boast and more like a law that governs the universe. There’s no moment on her debut mixtape Ho, why is you here ? where she doesn’t sound untouchable and self-possessed. The brief, playful project from the Alabama rapper is one of the breeziest records of the year, a clinic on nimble shit-talking that’s as effortless as it is brash. Ho, why is you here ? hews closely to the formula that made Flo Milli a viral star. She likes snappy, bass-heavy beats that give her ample space to fire off reams of insults and flexes. “Beef FloMix,” which began as a freestyle snippet on Instagram and was later boosted into a TikTok hit through a dance challenge, is her standard mode. She tends to frame disses as me/you comparisons (“I do what I please and you do what I ask/He love my confidence and that’s what you lack”) that snowball into larger-than-life boasts. In the song’s single verse she shouts out tween group OMG Girlz, likens her cash-filled pockets to K. Michele’s ass, and claims she’s guarded like an Obama. It’s not surprising that her music lends itself to dances and videos; she’s a visual speaker. Over and over, Flo Milli turns heads when she enters the room and mows down an inexhaustible horde of haters. She opens “In the Party” with a perfect line: “Dicks up when I step up in the party.” On “19,” her entrance lowers the self-esteem of those around her; elsewhere her shine leaves necks near-broken. All this attention breeds contempt, but Flo Milli will gladly be the villain. “Slap a bitch in her face if she askin’ for it,” she says on “Send the Addy.” “Like That Bitch” features a moment where she discovers and ends a tiff in the same breath. “Actin like we got beef/I didn’t know that you exist!” she yelps, elongating the vowel in “know.” The conflicts are all so definitively petty, which is what makes this record so fun. Her constant barbs are bolstered by her subtly spry cadences. Her flows are conversational and loose despite being strictly metered. The record is largely devoid of melody, but Flo Milli doesn’t need to sing to emote. She has an intuitive sense of when to throttle flows for emphasis, as on “Pussycat Doll,” which is full of tiny pauses that set up her punchlines. “Make a nigga blow a check on me/Save his number under ‘We gon see,’” she jokes. Her performance on “Weak,” a J White Did It production, is fleet and buoyant, flipping SWV’s  “Weak” on its head yet preserving the song’s warmth. “These niggas weak/They been texting me all week/Just let me be,” Flo Milli huffs with exasperation. The production isn’t always as spirited as Flo Milli’s performances. “Scuse Me” is an outright dud; it sounds like a parody of a JetsonMade beat and Flo Milli’s hook is uncharacteristically strained. Otherwise, a current of self-discovery runs through the beats. “Like That Bitch” and “Not Friendly” embrace the minimalism of snap music, which has long been a testing ground for experimenting with flows without sacrificing bounce. (Incidentally, “Not Friendly” interpolates Soulja Boy’s “Gucci Bandana.”) And the bouncy bass and bright keys on “In The Party” and “Send the Addy” evoke the charm of bubblegum trap, which tapped into the joy of a subgenre often characterized by stress and struggle. There’s certainly a disparity between Flo Mill the cocksure persona and Flo Milli the budding artist, but even when Flo Milli is spitballing ideas trying to see what sticks, she’s a force of nature. She once described her catchphrase “Flo Milli shit” as the mantra for “My alter ego, which is what I am most of the time,” and Ho, why is you here ? sells that odd dynamic. She’s still figuring out her music, but she knows exactly what she wants it to be. Catch up every Saturday with 10 of our best-reviewed albums of the week.

His recent records take the same analog approach he developed on 2016’s Night Melody, composing the album using real-life sketches to inform his writing, almost like a self-induced synesthesia. As West explains: “With a pen and paper you can compose and rethink ideas without technology getting in the way.” In this human method of re-attachment, West’s diagrams breathe life into digitized worlds, separating mechanical creation from pure design. His latest record, Articulation, continues in this practice and rewards complete engagement as ever-shifting moments dip, dive, and refuse to settle. The shaky “Forwardism” begins almost with a dubby industrial soul, but when glimpses of strings shine through, the whole thing becomes slung out, with a marching beat carrying you to catharsis. On the operatic “Vibrations On A String,” melody lines arc in and out of the song at odd angles, and jittering LFOs are cut through by saw-toothed synths into a track that could fill every corner of a symphony hall. Since his last few records, the production has become knottier and more entangled, layering staccato notes with glimpses of field recordings, flourishes of breakbeats, and sweeping effects. At times, Articulation’s grandiose ideas are deflated by an overwrought execution, particularly on the title track, where the stuttering synths feel out of place with one another. “Still Here” feels slightly insubstantial, revolving around a circular melody which, although pretty, feels vacant. But there are moments of hopeful clarity. The circularity of “Sudden Awareness Of Now,” in contrast, sounds like one epiphany after another; the sustained aquatic notes of “Melodica” carry the weight of Boards of Canada in The Campfire Headphase era. These little ambient gestures are small, but they burn the brightest. The magnetism of Rival Consoles lies in the chaotic warmth created through an intrepid play on rising and falling, conjuring a sense of turmoil that seems to become louder and more definite with each release.

FIXTAPE,Popcaan,by: Lawrence Burney,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f3195c9eb982d18c453dd84/1:1/w_160/fixtape_popcaan.jpg,2020-08-18 05:00:00,Global,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/popcaan-fixtape/,UnrulyOVO Sound,"The version of Popcaan’s newest project Fixtape that’s on major streaming platforms is a star-studded, 19-track project that, in many ways, mirrors the music that the artist born Andrae Sutherland has released over the last six years. It’s dancehall that is aware of global trends, while still serving up tracks to the loyal core of listeners that have been around since he was a young protégé under the tutelage of Vybz Kartel’s Gaza. There are appearances from the rising Jamaican singer Jada Kingdom, Popcaan’s former Gaza teammate Tommy Lee Sparta, French Montana, and Drake, whose OVO imprint released Fixtape. There are peaks and valleys that see Poppy go from slow-wining to head-banging to a handful of uplifting ballads that detail his ascension to dancehall royalty. But to experience Fixtape in all of its glory, listen to the 90-minute, 30-plus track version that exists as a singular mix (handled by popular sound system Chromatic) on Popcaan’s SoundCloud. It is the best way to fully engage with and assess Popcaan’s stellar range, which encapsulates the dancehall of the past, present, and future. In its mix form, Fixtape is framed as an epic tale in which Popcaan shares moments along his route to dancehall’s most prominent torchbearers. Instead of starting with the self-produced “Chill,” the SoundCloud version begins with melodramatic piano strokes, almost reminiscent of the theme song to The Young and the Restless. Those key hits grow into a symphonic instrumental adaptation of Popcaan’s 2011 hit “Only Man She Want,” and soon after, the first two non-Poppy voices you hear are a drop from incarcerated icon Vybz Kartel and audio of Drake’s praise at the first Unruly Fest in December 2018. Though even novice Popcaan listeners already know these affiliations, starting the project in this way is like flexing for the mirror, a moment of self-affirmation before proving it to the world. So it makes sense that the first song on this version of the tape, “Killy Dem Crazy,” is Popcaan trying his hand at Nas and Diddy’s Trackmasters-produced classic “Hate Me Now”—the perfect “fuck whoever don’t like it” gesture. Unlike Popcaan’s earlier, more conventional releases, Fixtape is an all-access pass inside contemporary dancehall that explores how its reach spans across much of the global Black diaspora. His debut album, 2014’s Where We Come From, was guided by an autobiographical narrative and gained the favor of international listeners due to its incorporation of pop-leaning production. Four years later, his second album, 2018’s Forever, was mostly comprised of easily listenable stories about pursuing love interests and the spiritual favor he believes The Almighty has bestowed upon him. At the tail end of 2019, he released Vanquish, a low-stakes inaugural OVO release that, if dropped this year, could have followed the new in-quarantine trend of being a deluxe version of Forever. Fixtape has elements of each of those releases. There are plenty of breezy, wine-inducing tracks like those that helped Popcaan break through to non-Jamaican markets. “Twist & Turn,” with production from dvsn’s Nineteen85 (responsible for “One Dance” and “Hotline Bling”), feels like it could be Popcaan’s breakout international hit. Were it not for this COVID-themed summer, the song likely would have enjoyed a “Work” or “One Dance” type of run at cookouts, bashments, and day parties. On “Suh Me Luv It,” he recruits singer Jada Kingdom for a seductive duet. By the time you get to the end of the project, Popcaan’s signature ballads serve as beautiful send-offs. On “Bank & God,” he’s distrustful of friends and family, but also reflective. “My Way” closes the project, where he sings, “Wi used to suffer, now ah everyday wi celebrate/Nuh money cyan ever mek wi segregate/Dawg man ah come from sardine, but nowadays, ah steak” while proclaiming that he is ready to accept all blessings. But in between these bookends are songs that demonstrate why Fixtape is arguably Popcaan’s strongest offering yet. If you follow Popcaan on Instagram, then you’re well aware of how much his everyday life feels like a reality show: riverside excursions with friends, hilarious interactions with his mom Miss Rona, the clear indication that community (peers, collaborators, family, and beyond) is crucial to his well-being and that he never wants to be away from it. Before Fixtape, his ethos was never really displayed in the music. But at every turn of this project, you feel like you are either inside of the studio session or in the actual dancehall experiencing this firsthand. Contemporary Jamaican music stars like Protoje and Lila Ike check in throughout, while members of the Caribbean diaspora like Giggs, Kano, and Casanova show up to let Popcaan know just what a living legend he is. When whoever is on the mic hits their stride and wows everyone else in the room, you can hear the shouts of their peers in the background as Chromatic wheels the tracks back to their beginning. And when Popcaan goes over beats from stateside peers like Meek Mill’s “Uptown Vibes,” DaBaby’s “Rockstar,” or N.O.R.E.’s classic “Nothin’” you get a peek at his taste outside of the Jamaican music sphere. Fixtape suggests a guide for contemporary dancehall artists (who, unlike Popcaan, rarely ever drop full-length projects) on how to cater to their base while simultaneously amplifying their voices internationally. It also challenges hip-hop artists in the States to get back to their underground roots for the sake of fun. Before this, Album Popcaan and Loose Track Popcaan acted separately. On the albums came the love songs, the songs that people who found Caribbean music through Drake could get down with. Loose Track Popcaan hops on popular riddims, gives you gunman tunes, and doesn’t care about who outside of the Jamaican diaspora gets it. But here, we get both, and it’s the best way to experience the full depth and grand scale of Popcaan.

Candid,Whitney,by: Steven Arroyo,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f3559f115d40ee6ff290894/1:1/w_160/candid_whitney.jpg,2020-08-18 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/whitney-candid/,Secretly Canadian,"Whitney found their voice by idolizing the voices of others. This is as foundational to the band as floral instrumental arrangements, great hair, and Julien Ehrlich’s pinched falsetto. Before Whitney was a widely beloved retro-rock group, “Whitney” was their muse: a fictional character invented by co-bandleaders Ehrlich and Max Kakacek whose thoughts they channeled into their first songs. In those early days, they moonlit as the backing band for the proudly rinky-dink diva Jimmy Whispers, alchemizing their full, brass-tinged sound into the warm glow of a spotlight pointed at someone else. The band quickly struck gold with “Golden Days,” the anthem of their 2016 Laurel Canyon-revering debut album, Light Upon the Lake. Elton John was spilling his guts to Ehrlich over the phone within months; Ehrlich gushed back to him about the singer Weyes Blood. But since that year, Whitney haven’t sounded quite so emphatically in love with their influences. Last year’s album, Forever Turned Around, was much more internal and melancholy. Their golden glow became that of embers, instead of sparks. It seems possible that they’ve scuffled with writer’s block: With their new all-covers album, Candid, Whitney have now formally released almost as many cover songs as they have originals. Whitney approach Candid like an inspiration board with 10 portraits tacked up—Ehrlich quite directly calls it “an exploration into how we can evolve as a band going forward.” The artists whom Whitney had covered before now generally scanned with their country-soul sensibilities: Neil Young, Allen Toussaint, NRBQ, Wilco, Dolly, Dylan. Here, not exactly: On Candid, Whitney tackle pithy folksters (the Roches, Blaze Foley) and enigmatic men of introspection (Moondog, Damien Jurado), but also women of heady, swirling R&B (SWV, Kelela), David Byrne, and a 1972 instrumental interlude by the French film composer Jack Arel that might be best known as a Mick Jenkins sample. For the most part, these covers are faithful, fine-tuned, and sound great. No track on Candid warps its original in a particularly wild or ambitious way; Whitney are more concerned with nailing these takes respectfully than fundamentally reimagining them. Impressively, the band commits to an entire nine- or 10-piece arrangement for Moondog’s spare, longing piano song “High on a Rocky Ledge” like it was there all along: Kakacek’s lilting guitar refrain leads the way, and Ehrlich doesn’t shy away from pronouncing “mädel edelweiß.” SWV’s extremely sensual “Rain” and Foley’s resigned lament “Rainbows & Ridges”—probably the two most aesthetically unalike songs covered here—are slotted next to each other at the end of the album, but Erlich’s tender singing voice seems to connect them without stretching. Only “Strange Overtones,” a highlight of Byrne and Brian Eno’s second collaborative album, lands awkwardly—dance rhythms just aren’t a natural fit on Whitney. Candid has a second, more interesting function, though, one that’s independent of Whitney’s taste or talent as players. It has to do with the fact that most of these songs were not their creators’ most famous—they’re the ones that get buried a little further under better-known work, and all the rest of the music in the world, with each passing day. It’s not just that these picks are obscure or diverse, or that Ehrlich and Kakacek probably make outstanding playlists. It’s how they seem to select a few interesting pebbles from an infinite beach, polish them, and place them on a mantle. It’s how they pluck one of Labi Siffre’s many dozens of good songs, place it alongside one of Damien Jurado’s, and behold the pairing. This feels like the “candid” to which Whitney refer: not in the sense of frank and direct, but of capturing moments that weren’t necessarily destined for preservation. Their inclusion of John Denver’s “Take Me Home, Country Roads” is the obvious exception, but a verse by Waxahatchee’s Katie Crutchfield—Candid’s lone feature—single-handedly validates the choice. The folk-rocker and born Southerner sounds crushingly genuine as she pays loving tribute to her musical and geographical roots; after hearing Crutchfield sing it, you’ll feel almost guilty to have ever found the song’s ubiquity grating. It nearly qualifies as Candid’s finest moment, but that title goes to the other selection here that was its original artist’s signature song, though nowhere near as successful. “Hammond Song,” the 1978 track by singing sisters the Roches, is about as underappreciated as perfect folk songs come—and, as far as modern bands not named Haim go, Whitney are maybe the most logical choice to interpret it. Ehrlich synthesizes the sisters’ three harmony lines into one melody as he takes on their fears that the song’s subject is “on the wrong track” in moving to the titular Louisiana city and leaving behind family, home, and all other prospects. Whitney have yet to truly lose their way, and it’s because they wear influences like this so well. Catch up every Saturday with 10 of our best-reviewed albums of the week.

Welcome to Conceptual Beach,Young Jesus,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f355b40e8781a54ceae1787/1:1/w_160/welcome%20to%20conceptual%20beach_young%20jesus.jpg,2020-08-18 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/young-jesus-welcome-to-conceptual-beach/,Saddle Creek,"“Every record needs a thesis, needs a crisis or campaign,” John Rossiter croons on “Root and Crown,” the introductory single for Young Jesus’ fifth album, Welcome to Conceptual Beach. Over the past several years, Rossiter’s “Conceptual Beach”—an idea he has likened to his “internal landscape”—has taken on elements of all three. Rossiter initially used it as a fictional framework for personal journaling while he transitioned from Midwestern slacker to erudite Los Angeles bookstore clerk. He created a zine bearing the title during his first tour with the current Young Jesus lineup, in 2016, then used the name for an event series where attendees watercolored and discussed local politics over improvisatory jams—a proper incubator for 2017’s exploratory S/T and its muscular follow-up, The Whole Thing Is Just There. Both albums were collections of open-ended post-rock that teased a future masterpiece while challenging the idea of canonization itself. Welcome to Conceptual Beach marks a soulful fusion of their emo past and heady present, invoking art rock and improvisation while sounding like nothing else. In the past, Young Jesus tapped into the spiritual and theoretical constructs of astral jazz and minimalist composition, but the sounds were outside of their grasp. Opener “Faith” is everything Young Jesus songs are—elliptical, brimming with ideas, about seven minutes long—and a lot of things they never were before: playful, funky, even willing to flex a bit. It’s Purdie shuffle and Pink Floyd, Auto-Tune croak and plaintive prayer, Santa Cruz acid rock and Laurel Canyon folk. Both S/T and The Whole Thing Is Just There felt like products of an initial burst of unbridled creative momentum—the work of a band passionately pursuing new approaches to compositional form, but not always concerned with translating that excitement to people not in Young Jesus. In contrast, each song on Welcome to Conceptual Beach has an accessible core to which it can return, allowing Young Jesus to scrutinize their exploratory impulses without lapsing into fussiness or formlessness. Where most bands might use a chorus or bridge to signify a change in direction, Young Jesus decrescendo, leaving blank space for mindfulness. It’s at these points where the marathon jams, open-ended live shows, and philosophical woodshedding transform into telepathic communication, signaling where the song might go next. Young Jesus consistently prefer to veer from established courses toward previously unexplored vistas: Rossiter modulates from mystical incantations to motivational speaking over the span of “Meditations,” harmonizes over breezy yacht rock in “Pattern Doubt,” and stumbles into a bustling jazz club during “Lark.” Occasionally, they’ll break down a jam into constituent parts and rebuild with slightly different angles: The melodic motifs and themes of decay and rebirth on “(un)knowing” reimagine Radiohead’s “Let Down” as dejected slowcore until Rossiter vows to grow wings with startling, octave-bounding vocal leaps. “Lark” remixes the regal procession of its first half into an elegiac post-emo coda, the type that once earned Young Jesus comparisons to American Football when no one really knew what to call them. But Young Jesus’ most profound achievement isn’t that the album sounds more like jazz fusion than indie rock. Rather, it’s Rossiter’s continued willingness to reckon with all phases of his life through a lyrical vulnerability that’s rare in their headier and often instrumental influences. “I felt the only life’s the one you lead alone,” he confesses on “Magicians,” looking back on a painful period of living too deeply in his own mind. When he muses, “Every critic’s got some things they’re not proud of,” Rossiter includes and indicts himself; a typical interview finds him scrutinizing the relics of his aimless early twenties that remain on streaming services for posterity—for example, 2010’s Young, Innocent & Hairy, a reflection of getting shit-faced drunk and listening to Bright Eyes and the Good Life in his parents’ garage, bearing no resemblance to the guy who actually got signed to Saddle Creek. Though Young Jesus’ trajectory is frequently viewed through Rossiter’s personal evolution, each member of the quartet shares a vision for continual learning: Respectively, they footnote interviews with reading syllabi, contribute to prestigious literary journals, and teach college courses on Sun Ra. “It’s not enough to hate the world we live within,” Rossiter screamed at the end of The Whole Thing Is Just There’s “Deterritory.” Now, in every expression of hard-won serenity, Rossiter reflects on the struggles he has documented for years, asking questions that were once seen as frivolous, insular, or even pretentious: How can music shared among a small community be a model for society? What is the purpose of art to begin with? Welcome to Conceptual Beach has the answer: to conceive of a better future by embracing the unknown.

Luminous,Brian EnoRoger Eno,by: Robert Ham,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f3a9ab372e13ea74d400277/1:1/w_160/luminous_brian%20eno%20roger%20eno.jpg,2020-08-18 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/brian-eno-roger-eno-luminous/,Deutsche Grammophon,"Five months after the release of their duo album Mixing Colours, Brian Eno and his younger brother, Roger, pick up what they’ve called a “back-and-forth conversation” with Luminous, an EP featuring six new tracks and a tune previously restricted to the album’s Japanese edition. The two men’s musical exchange took place over the course of 15 years: Roger, a pianist, would improvise pieces on a MIDI keyboard, then pass them off to Brian to treat with effects and electronics. For years, there was no goal in mind, but eventually, they built up enough material for an album. Perhaps too much material:  The resulting full-length  was a lovely if minor work from the two musicians, one hampered by a numbing 75-minute runtime that undermined both the nuance of Brian’s treatments and the grace of Roger’s Satie-like refrains. On Luminous, with its focused 28-minute length, similar material takes a stronger hold on the listener’s attention. Although created with the same methods and technology, these finely spun instrumentals have an underlying energy that Mixing was often missing. A fine example is “Manganese,” a song anchored by a simple melodic phrase that, when filtered through Brian’s effects, sounds like a player piano set adrift in deep space. “Pewter,” the original album’s Japan-only bonus track, floats free alongside it—a glistening mass of synthetic chords and haunting atmosphere that calls to mind a previous Eno brothers collaboration: 1983’s Apollo: Atmospheres and Soundtracks. Luminous’ brevity also puts both men’s individual contributions into sharper relief. Roger’s playing on “Malachite” rolls and sways like a slow, joyous waltz, and his melodies on “Vermillion” and “Violet” feel as thick and languorous as a summer afternoon. Brian’s contributions provide all the finer details: the fireworks-like electronic bursts throughout “Vermillion,” the gorgeously clashing overtones within “Moss,” the understated bass on “Pewter.” On vinyl, Luminous exists as a standalone release. But for digital service providers, the Enos and Deutsche Grammophon made the curious decision to fold these seven tracks into the original tracklist of Mixing Colours—not sprinkled throughout, but plunked en masse toward the end, preserving Mixing Colours’ two closing tracks as a finale. It’s an unusual move, one telling of the ways that the album format has evolved in the streaming era. The Eno brothers aren’t going the route of Kanye West, who made changes to both The Life of Pablo and ye long after they were released. But in their own small way, Roger and Brian are embracing the idea of an album as a living document. Which might not be to the benefit of Mixing Colours. Whatever mood and flow they were trying to create with the original album is disrupted—and the lift that the songs from Luminous provide is quickly whisked away with the return of Mixing Colours’ pleasant but forgettable material. However unwittingly, the Enos make the case that Mixing Colours might have been better served by treating its material in the manner of this new EP: doled out in smaller servings, the better for the richness of their collaboration to be appreciated.

Mach’s Hard Lemonade,Mach-Hommy,by: Paul A. Thompson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f317ca172e13ea74d3ffda0/1:1/w_160/mach's%20hard%20lemonade_mach-hommy.jpg,2020-08-17 05:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/mach-hommy-machs-hard-lemonade/,Mach-Hommy,"About halfway through Mach’s Hard Lemonade, Mach-Hommy thanks his fans, then catches himself: He’d rather refer to them as “investors.” This word is both a reference to the unusual passion the Newark rapper inspires in his followers and of the exorbitant prices he charges for his music and merchandise (the deluxe vinyl version of Lemonade retails for $444.44, the standard version a steal at half the price). But as time goes on and Hommy’s catalog grows, the idea of fans as investors begins to evoke the image of a satisfied shareholder, idly reaping the benefits of betting on this nomadic maybe-genius who seems committed to quarter-over-quarter growth. Mach-Hommy’s public persona––the quasi-anonymity, the wonderfully prickly interviews, his refusal to allow sites like Genius to sell ads against his transcribed lyrics––and his probing, uncompromised music might suggest a flightier artist. But Hommy has grown prolific, even when you allow for gaps on the release schedule where albums that are unaffordable or unavailable on streaming platforms might otherwise sit. Lemonade is the seamless continuation of a long string of reliable Hommy records; it is also one of his strongest yet, engrossing despite its brevity. It would seem that there is an opportunity for Hommy to court some crossover fame: Lemonade’s digital release was exclusive to Tidal; he was photographed last fall at a meeting with JAY-Z, who took obvious inspiration from Hommy’s cadences for his verses on Jay Electronica’s A Written Testimony. But the closest Hommy comes to incorporating Jay into his latest work is a line on album opener “SBTM” (“I seen the same shit happen to Shan”) that alludes to a quip on Vol. 3 about rappers biting another Juice Crew member. And so when he raps, on that same song, “I was hidden/Now I’m risen,” you understand that Hommy––and not well-meaning advisers assembled around a conference table––is the one setting the stakes and scope of his myth. Lemonade is mixed more crisply than some of Hommy’s other records, but the sound design––pleasingly jagged, occasionally muddy––is still the unifying force in his music. Hommy is a collagist, someone who can connect lines from a posthumous Biggie song and Baby Doc Duvalier’s reign in Haiti to MC Shan and the Atlanta rap group D4L (Fabo and the late Shawty Lo are both shouted out in the opening verse of “Smoked Maldon”––before Hommy compares himself to Steve Prefontaine). These scraps of material culled from seemingly disparate worlds suggest an observer so keen that he sees the source code of life hidden to the rest of us; he realized the value in masking up in public long before the plague. When rapping, Hommy exercises remarkable control: at times his verses will seem to careen across the beat, becoming more and more verbose, all while slowly revealing an underlying, rhythmic logic. (This makes it all the more jarring––and rewarding––when Hommy opens his chest and bellows a verse, as he does on the superb closer, “NJ Ultra.”) But it’s Hommy’s intermittent singing that makes his albums so dynamic: See his chorus on “Marshmallow Test,” where the way he croons “One for you… one, two for me” turns an experiment famously carried out on children into a cool, capitalist taunt. Lemonade’s high point is “Squeaky Hinge,” a moment of complete synthesis for Hommy’s technical virtuosity and musical instincts, his sly humor and his feel for the violent undercurrents in American cities. “The smell of death” wafts from apartments on gentrifying blocks near where the “hot mama” is “in the bordello with the Jonathan.” There’s a devilish bounce, even, to the way he opens the track: “What’s pocket change?/What’s house money?/What’s stock exchange?/All I know is clout, dummy.” Mach-Hommy is interested in evoking, not explaining, and has neither the patience nor desire to bring you up to speed.

Non-Secure Connection,Bruce Hornsby,by: Pete Tosiello,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f35544df6eb11025fede49e/1:1/w_160/non%20secure%20connection_bruce%20hornsby.jpg,2020-08-17 05:00:00,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/bruce-hornsby-non-secure-connection/,Zappo,"Few contemporary music men have embraced the role of American troubadour like Bruce Hornsby. He cracks jokes, shakes his head in bewilderment at days gone by, and—judging by his broad roster of famous collaborators—is equally comfortable lending favors as calling them in. Since the 1991 breakup of his first band the Range, he’s played keys for the Grateful Dead, played jazz with Jack DeJohnette and bluegrass with Ricky Skaggs, and released a dulcimer album. (He also, legend has it, beat Allen Iverson in a game of one-on-one.) Hornsby’s spent the last decade scoring Spike Lee Joints, and cinematic cues enlivened 2019’s Absolute Zero as well as its quick follow-up Non-Secure Connection. Non-Secure Connection’s arresting opener “Cleopatra Drones” showcases Hornsby’s ability to wrest resonant imagery from childlike turns of phrase, his layered vocals evoking a desert apocalypse of marching animals and “shoebox satellites.” Percussion sneaks in around the track’s halfway point, building a head of steam en route to a climactic keyboard solo. Similarly atmospheric production buoys “Time, the Thief,” on which Hornsby’s piano sails atop a symphonic horn arrangement. As ever, Hornsby’s wistful, elegant melodies are the main attraction. A winding sitar and stand-up bass grab your attention on the unearthed Leon Russell collaboration “Anything Can Happen,” but it’s the earnest piano chords that make it such a winning ballad. Like much of the album, the James Mercer vocal duet “My Resolve” is grounded in cataclysmic themes; each verse and instrumental solo is its own roiling descent, each chorus an oasis of reprieve. And while Jamila Woods’s guest spot is the big-tent draw on “Bright Star Cast,” it’s driven by Hornsby and Living Colour guitarist Vernon Reid’s thick electro-funk. The engineering is crisp and capacious, their playing loose and lively. Of the dozens of character sketches scattered across Hornsby’s 35-year recording career, the most infamous are from Reagan’s second term. In the Range’s 1986 FM-radio breakthrough “The Way It Is,” a song about the insufficiency of the Civil Rights Act, a silk-suited businessman harrasses a woman waiting in a welfare line. This was followed in 1988 by “Look Out Any Window,” a Mellencamp-ian survey of farmers and fishermen casting weary eyes at the decade’s horizon. Rather than oppositional forces, Hornsby cast the urban poor and the red state/blue-collar demo as brothers of a widening underclass, sharing interests (organized labor) and antagonists (politicos, slick salesmen, small towns and small-mindedness). But Hornsby’s writing actually improved when he became less of a prognosticator. By 2004’s Halcyon Days, a middle-aged manifesto of a piece with Billy Joel’s The Bridge and Mellencamp’s Key West records, he narrowed his focus to subtler narrative intersections, the sort of generational divides which tend to come up more in passing and less at the Thanksgiving dinner table. Shortly before Warren Zevon’s death, Hornsby began performing Zevon’s “Play It All Night Long,” a portrait of rural patriarchy gone to seed, in concerts; Non-Secure Connection’s “Shit’s Crazy Out Here” adds a layer of post-modern paranoia to the woebegone flippancy of Zevon’s “My Shit’s Fucked Up.” For all his hip affiliations and progressive politics, Hornsby acknowledges his old soul happily enough. As on Halcyon Days, Non-Secure Connection’s characters are compromised less by the objective state of things than by their struggles to keep up. On the title track, a hacker likens himself to a Trojan warrior, yet can’t quite articulate the joy he finds in sowing chaos online. Later, on “Porn Hour,” an internet porn addict considers the onward trudge of technology: “The innovation of the internet was driven by a couple on a film set/We thank the hard boys and the naked girls, for the coming of our beautiful cyberworld.” I’m not sure I ever needed to hear the “Mandolin Rain” guy marvel aloud at the wonders of PornHub, but now that I have I’m not even mad about it.

I Must Be Living Twice EP,Black Marble,by: Chris O'Connell,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f31939bd124eb14f7a690f6/1:1/w_160/I%20Must%20Be%20Living%20Twice_black%20marble.jpg,2020-08-17 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/black-marble-i-must-be-living-twice-ep/,Sacred Bones,"Black Marble has flourished by returning repeatedly to the sacred well of synth-pop. It’s Immaterial, the 2016 second album from Chris Stewart’s duo-turned-solo-project, drank deep from all-timers like New Order and footnotes like Iron Curtain, securing a place in the canon by excelling within established standards: vintage synths, melodic basslines, liberal reverb, melancholic undertones. Last year’s Bigger Than Life, though, did little to advance on that template except by cleaning it up, rendering Stewart’s music sparkly and bright without developing his songwriting accordingly. Seeming to sense that something went awry, Stewart attempts a reset with I Must Be Living Twice, a new all-covers EP. Some of the covers, which include songs by Wire, Grouper, and Lives of Angels, are Black Marble live staples, and Stewart has said that the EP exists mainly to get his versions onto tape. Despite the low stakes, or perhaps because of them, I Must Be Living Twice sounds like Black Marble rewiring itself back to what worked in the middle of the decade. Its lo-fi approach infuses the covers with the familiar charm of his early albums, making the EP a satisfying release, if a minor one. Most of the tracks fit neatly within the Black Marble sound. Stewart adds fluttering arpeggiated synths to “Johnny and Mary,” Robert Palmer’s 1980 synth-pop classic, but largely echoes Palmer’s plaintive vocal performance. His approach is less distinct than that of Todd Terje and Bryan Ferry, who put their sublime twist on “Johnny and Mary” six years ago, slowing the tempo to a crawl, with Ferry’s decadent rasp making Palmer sound upbeat by comparison. Still, there’s room for all three versions: Palmer’s original is for the club, Terje and Ferry’s cover is for the bedroom, and Black Marble’s take is for the wistful loner, staring out the window at sheets of rain. Other choices are more questionable. It’s a fool’s errand to cover “Emma’s House,” The Field Mice’s debut single, an already-perfect twee-pop anthem. Stewart, with a toylike synth patch subbing in for the original’s acoustic guitar, creates an even quainter version of a song that embodies the bookish introspection of the Sarah Records and C86 sound. A softer, twinklier take on “Emma’s House” seems beyond parody; it already requires a knitted sweater and a piping hot cup of Earl Grey for full enjoyment. The first few years of Black Marble were special thanks to Stewart’s ability to transcend artifice and goth posturing with fantastic hooks and inventive arrangements. Though he’s not working with original compositions here, he does seem to have regained his sense of the sonics that complement his music best. There’s nothing revolutionary or essential about this collection of mostly safe crowd-pleasers. But as Stewart reloads before the next album cycle, those enraptured by Black Marble’s moody soundscapes will enjoy his return to form.

Total Freedom,Kathleen Edwards,by: Sam Sodomsky,Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f35565d30f23afaeee90c53/1:1/w_160/total%20freedom_kathleen%20edwards.jpg,2020-08-17 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/kathleen-edwards-total-freedom/,Dualtone,"Near the end of Total Freedom, Kathleen Edwards sings a song for her dog. Narrating in the second-person to Redd, her golden retriever, the 42-year-old songwriter reflects on the day they first met: “You were so sweet, immediately.” She goes on to describe their walks together, the compliments they received from neighbors, and the place she eventually buried his ashes. It is a quietly emotional and personal narrative, weaving in a thread about her own habit of self-medicating with alcohol. But more than any of these novelistic details, what’s most striking is her serenity, the focus in her delivery and peace in her voice as she quietly breaks your heart.  It is a love song for a lost friend: the kind of thing you might sing alone, at home, when no one is listening. This is the tone of Total Freedom, the Ottawa songwriter’s first album in eight years. And if it sounds like the work of someone who had a lot of time to focus on the things that matter, that’s because it is. Beginning with 2003’s Failer, Edwards released a string of expertly written records on the edges of heartland rock and alt-country, building a tight knit fanbase (which includes Maren Morris, who asked her to co-write a song on her most recent album). But after 2012’s atmospheric Voyageur, produced by Justin Vernon of Bon Iver, Edwards found herself disillusioned with the industry. Playing its songs every night was destroying her voice, and the shows themselves had become draining and financially unsustainable at a point when she hoped to be crossing over. “I thought, ‘Oh, my God, no one cares. I’m just not good enough,” she reflected. “The only reason I sold two hundred tickets is because Bon Iver fans are coming to see if Justin might show up.’” All of this was on her mind when she drove past a storefront for lease near her hometown. An inside joke with a friend became a life preserver, and she decided to retire from the music business and open a coffee shop. She called it Quitters. Located in the small town of Stittsvile, Ontario, it evolved into a local fixture with a loyal clientele—multiple Yelp reviews note the stellar music in the stop—and Edwards found a hard-won, person-to-person sense of gratification. She felt fulfilled. She spent more time with her dogs. Slowly, the songs came back. There was “Who Rescued Who,” the one about Redd, and “Ashes to Ashes,” a plainspoken eulogy for one of her Quitters customers. But the one that got the ball rolling was “Glenfern,” a breezy rock song that filtered her past life as a touring musician through frank new perspective: “Now when I find myself looking back,” she sings calmly, “I think of all the cool shit that happened.” (Of course, she wasn’t totally ready to chase away those demons: “We bought a rock and roll dream,” she confesses, “and it was total crap.”) If Edwards’ work once recalled the dark, pastoral story-songs of Lucinda Williams, her writing here feels more akin to recent work from Mount Eerie or Sufjan Stevens—memoristic folk songs that scour hard memories for new lessons. The production matches her clear-eyed realizations, and the resulting album feels like a creative breakthrough, written solely for the thrill of discovery. (Or as she put it to the New York Times, “I mean, what’s going to happen? I go back to working at the cafe? OK, sounds good!”). “Bird on a Feeder” is a gorgeous song about solitude, played on acoustic guitar with subtle flourishes of piano. In each verse, she follows the same pattern of thought, counting each passing season and reflecting on the ways her internal atmosphere has changed. She concludes each chorus with a brief observation—“no one to need”—and her delivery could be affirming, inquisitive, or hopeless with each repetition. Other songs refuse to be misinterpreted. In “Hard on Everyone,” Edwards sings about the dynamics of an emotionally abusive relationship, revisiting the gravelly texture of her early work to summon the strength to fight back. “Fools Ride” travels similarly rough terrain, as she reflects on a long series of warning signs ignored with the hopes of finding contentment: “Here comes the red flag flying in the shit parade,” she recounts as a dizzy-sounding rhythm section tumbles behind her. These are unsparing accounts of tough subjects, but Edwards navigates each song with tenderness and humor, allowing her to tear apart old idioms (“Love is blind/Whoever bought that line must be a real sucker”) or invent new ones (“Love is simple math/I can be a total pain in the ass”). Listening to her reckon with these complicated emotions, it occurs to me how many people dream of finding this kind of wisdom: stepping away from the daily rituals, imagining themselves happier and lighter in the aftermath. Through these songs, you hear that freedom, but Edwards also reminds you how the past lingers, how actual escape is more elusive than it seems. In a virtual live set earlier this month, she covered the Neil Young classic “Comes a Time,” a decades-old song about how the world moves on despite the small catastrophes that happen every day. She heard it on the radio a few nights earlier and found herself humming it while walking the dog. It seemed to suit the times, so she learned to play it when she got home. As tree branches blow outside her window, for a minute, the future seems simple enough. Catch up every Saturday with 10 of our best-reviewed albums of the week.

Ridin’ Dirty,UGK,by: Brandon Caldwell,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f31a4a872e13ea74d3ffda6/1:1/w_160/ridin%20dirty_ugk.jpg,2020-08-16 05:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/ugk-ridin-dirty/,Jive,"On December 4, 1995, Pimp C and DJ Screw sat in the parking lot of a Houston convenience store and began plotting for the night. After an uneasy first encounter at a local record store years prior, they’d become fast friends. Pimp, one half of the duo Underground Kingz, was the producer known for wild boasts and determination. Screw’s sound—a slowed-down drag of the world to a hallucinogenic crawl—engulfed the city. The night was supposed to be about bullshittin’—slide to a neighborhood joint called Carrington’s with Lil’ Keke, a member of Screw’s famed Screwed Up Click outfit, party, and then record a version of a song Pimp had been working on. Inside the car, Pimp was bemused about life. Weeks prior, he was in Chicago on behalf of Jive Records, recording material for Underground Kingz’ then-untitled third album. None of it sounded good enough to compare to the group’s previous effort, 1994’s Super Tight. Even his mother, UGK’s manager Mama Wes, called the demos “boo-boo.” But the two never made it to the studio to record. They never made it past Carrington’s. Instead, the two stopped to pick up styrofoam cups and Swisher Sweets to further activate the night. Screw and Pimp parked next to an undercover police officer outside of a convenience store neighboring Carrington’s. As the cop smelled the weed smoke in the air, he radioed for backup. Within moments, Pimp C and DJ Screw were in handcuffs and headed to the Harris County Jail. They bonded out two days later. The arrest—coupled with a tragic house fire in Dallas four days later, claiming the lives of four children, including the son of UGK hypeman Bo-Bo Luchiano—became the basis for “One Day,” the peak and tone-setter of 1996’s Ridin’ Dirty. Pimp lamented on the child’s death as if it were his own son, questioning God with the fearlessness of a sinner (“Why you let these killas live and take my homeboy son away?”) The base of Ridin’ Dirty aligns with the ethos of UGK as a whole: perseverance in the face of a mountain of unfortunate circumstances. At first, “One Day” didn’t even belong to UGK. The rumbling guitars that lurch like impending sorrow from the Isley Brothers’ “Ain’t I Been Good To You”—and Ronnie Spencer’s near-perfect Ronald Isley impression —was initially in the possession of Mr. 3-2, a Houston stalwart and Rap-A-Lot Records artist known city-wide. Before Snoop Dogg uttered, “We don’t love these hoes,” he learned it from 3-2. Before Roc-A-Fella crafted a posse cut in “1-900-Hustler” to highlight Freeway on The Dynasty: Roc La Familia, it belonged to 3-2 and Big Mike of the Convicts in “1-900-Dial-A-Crook.” UGK’s other half, Bun B, was hesitant to rhyme over “One Day,” seeing that the song initially belonged to 3-2, and rhyming over a dirge of production like “One Day” disrupted the bouncy, even-keeled production UGK was known for. But, compelled by the belief that UGK needed a song that people felt, Bun relented and recorded a verse. He mourns over a friend lost to a “funky ass dice game” and sneers that the prison-industrial complex was nothing more than an endless cycle for Black men. 3-2 barely even raps: His voice contorts into a sullen waltz that moves between understanding the bleakness of his reality and seeking protection while navigating crack transactions and potential death. He considered himself a wayward soul since his mom kicked him out; he wanted a proper burial in his neighborhood right next to the gas station. “As far as Pimp and I are concerned, it’s the first real UGK album,” Bun would later tell journalist Sama’an Ashrawi on his The Nostalgia Mixtape podcast. “Ridin’ Dirty is, in our mind, the first actual complete thought of UGK as far as an album is concerned.” For four years and across two prior albums, the group fought with their label, Jive Records, and had bruises to show for it. There was a disconnect; UGK would rather the label send them studio equipment to record Ridin’ Dirty as opposed to a standard monetary advance. Dating back to their debut album, Too Hard To Swallow, UGK knew Jive for shady, underhanded business. The label reproduced songs behind Pimp’s back in order to avoid paying to clear samples. Grandiose album concepts were scrapped due to the label, once again, being fiscally conservative. Even when it came time for Ridin’ Dirty, Jive refused to make a video for either of the two proposed singles, “One Day” and “Fuck My Car,” or even ship them for radio airplay. By the time UGK shot a video for “Wood Wheel,” a single from the Rap-A-Lot compilation album RNDS in 1999, it had been five years since their last video for “It’s Supposed To Bubble.” When Bun and Pimp first met KRS-One at the label’s New York offices in 1992, they came with a point to prove. KRS, long a protector of what hip-hop truly meant, felt that if the music wasn’t made within New York’s five boroughs, it wasn’t rap. And UGK, according to KRS, was country rap.  Now, they were labelmates. Instead of a gracious embrace, UGK were met by a warning from KRS that came too late: Don’t sign to Jive. “We were happy for about 15 minutes and then … reality set in,” Bun would later tell journalist Matt Sonzala. “We never even had the chance to be disillusioned about having a record deal. We regretted it right after signing.” UGK weren’t commercial darlings, they were fixated squarely on making music for the people. But by sheer word of mouth, Ridin’ Dirty sold over 850,000 copies, earning UGK their first and only gold plaque. It gave the South, a region already galvanized by André 3000 at the 1995 Source Awards, a blueprint for how a soulful rap album could sound and feel. The situation with Jive, the storm of emotion and strife internally affecting the group, would manifest itself into a moment of show and prove for UGK. No producer in the South felt more proudly about his creations than Pimp. The son of a trumpet player who eventually learned piano by ear, he went from performing in New York with his high school choir to using the Meters’ guitarist Leo Nocentelli as a session musician. Sampling records, from the Stax sound of Isaac Hayes to the psychedelic crawl of Bootsy Collins, from the groove of the Fatback Band to Wes Montgomery’s virtuoso guitar work, was as mutually important as the reality UGK conveyed in raps. After hearing Dr. Dre master the cinematic style of music production for N.W.A, it influenced Pimp to make every sound feel like a score to a film. After the failed Chicago sessions at Jive’s Battery Studios, Pimp and Bun felt they needed to be home in order to fully embrace what Ridin’ Dirty was supposed to be. At the same time, the rush of creativity emanating from DJ Screw’s house made “home” feel like the center of the universe. In Screw, Pimp and Bun found a kindred spirit. UGK already spoke for Houston culture, crushing small aspects in car culture and laced cigarettes for their 1994 album Super Tight. The music had to align with the world they inhabited. Chapter 182: Ridin’ Dirty—a loose and free-wheeling tape of freestyles was the precursor to the album. Although Houston had wholesalers and marketplaces to pick up music, picking up Screw tapes was an entirely different journey. One had to personally drive to Screw’s house on the Southside of town, wait for his gate to be buzzed open around 7 p.m. and get their music. Pimp and Bun became further immortalized and endeared to Houston’s underground music culture rattling off rhymes about losing Eazy-E to AIDS, puffing their chests out with thick bravado, and echoing the slang that was wholly Houston and Southeast, Texas: slabs, barre, drank, grills, throwin’ up the deuce, comin’ dine, etc. Jive couldn’t understand the purpose of Screw music. As a middle finger to the label, the album version of Ridin’ Dirty is the glossiest version of a Screw tape ever imagined; a muggy and rich malaise of soul and everyman narratives. A weekend in Houston became the underlying concept for Ridin’ Dirty. Pimp and Bun, seeing themselves already as established characters, worked around creations of partying, bombast, and reflection. The weight of “One Day” is guilt-ridden and remorseful. Inside the rolling thump of “Diamonds & Wood,” a lift from Bootsy Collins’ “Munchies For Your Love,” Pimp allowed his real-life drama with the mother of his son, Chad Butler II, to play out (“All we do now is fuck and fight”) and detail the frustration of family dynamics and faceless enemies. “I stopped smokin’ with them haters back in ’94,” he bluntly states. “Niggas talk a lot of shit in a safe place, I know cause he can’t look me eye-to-eye when he in my face.” It was never about outright wordplay with Pimp—pointed directness with clarity was his calling as a rapper. He left his complexity for his production. Armed with N.O. Joe, the New Orleans-born producer who had helmed much of the bleak psychodrama of Scarface’s The Diary, Pimp dug deeper in his already chaotic mind to live up to the likes of Hayes and Curtis Mayfield. Smoke D, a UGK affiliate serving time in a Mississippi prison for manslaughter, operates as the album’s unsuspecting guide, offering comedy and reality in various interludes through jailhouse recordings. Bumpy funk transitions were layered underneath flippant guitar work for “Pinky Ring,” horror style piano stabs underscore the late-night creep of “3 In The Mornin.” Mellow guitar licks and drums pump through “Touched” where Bun indirectly gifts JAY-Z the basis for a story he’d use later (“Now once upon a time not too long ago...”). The mutated bassline of Detroit funk band the Brides of Funkenstein’s “Smoke Signals” was shifted around for “Murder,” morphing the track into the most sinister, yet defiant UGK record of all. “I’m still Pimp C bitch, so what the fuck is up?” Pimp would declare on “Murder.” It’s tough, a merciless downhill jaunt of chaos where no one was safe. Pimp’s verse, rooted in the idea of bringing the outside world to UGK’s close proximity, is among the all-time hardest opening verses in rap. Discussions of cocaine prices and slinging dope quickly destroyed the myth that the group were just characters you heard on CD or cassette. Bun and Pimp didn’t want to exude the fantasy of mafioso kingpins in the vein of JAY-Z, Raekwon, or The Notorious B.I.G. Songs like “Cocaine in the Back of the Ride” and “Pocket Full of Stones” granted humanity and consequence to a trade New York made feel flamboyant; an elaborate con. When Pro Tools evolved in the mid-1990s, it allowed artists to take a short cut in the studio and punch in vocals to help speed up the recording process. Ridin’ Dirty is the first album in hip-hop to ever use it, according to Bun. While recording his “Murder” verse with N.O. Joe, Bun woke up from sitting at the control panel, exhausted from a prior night of partying. With the reel still going, he began building a world with easy identifiers (“Well it’s Bun B bitch, and I’m the king of movin’ chickens”) and continued as if he were one man going up against 15 years worth of criticism about the South not having rappers. For nearly two minutes, Bun displays the nimbleness he picked up from ciphers with 3-2 and Chapter 182: double entendres and metered stacking of one-liners and demolishing everything within sight. He found pockets like this often, namely for “They Down With Us,” a 2000 romp with Scarface on top of Boogie Down Productions’ “I’m Still #1.” When he was done with the verse, Bun exited the booth and fell asleep; an implausible verse finished in one take. Ridin’ Dirty never comes back to the ridiculous highs of its first two songs, or the ruminative “Diamonds & Wood” or “Hi-Life.” But its heart remains central to what UGK means as a whole, to a region once cast aside and now is at the forefront. They wouldn’t have a chance to deliver a proper follow-up until 11 years later due to Pimp C spending a large bulk of his final years in prison. They also never truly got the recognition they richly deserved from their label, and were too stubborn to allow industry politics to swallow them whole. Anger from watching a label attempt to sabotage and hijack their identity and regional disrespect were the anchors of UGK’s greatest work, and only they could give the levity it needed.

Crave,Kiesza,by: Eric Torres,Editorial Producer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f3558568dde6310e6f07a4b/1:1/w_160/crave_kiesza.jpg,2020-08-15 05:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/kiesza-crave/,Zebra Spirit Tribe,"Kiesza’s house-pop hit “Hideaway” arrived alongside a rush of mid-2010s dance-pop crossovers, distinguishing the Calgary singer through an ecstatic blast of energy and a viral one-take video. Kiesza’s debut didn’t deviate far from that song’s formula, yet it also led to platinum sales in Europe, three Juno Awards, and a big-tent collaboration with Diplo and Skrillex’s Jack Ü. Then, while writing her follow-up in Toronto, a car accident derailed her life, leaving her with memory loss, fatigue, and balance issues on the left side of her body. Faced with the possibility of never performing again, Kiesza worked with a chiropractor and various alternative health approaches to will herself back into physical and mental shape within a remarkably fast two years. The trauma led to more than just a bodily transformation. Kiesza parted ways with her major label to start her own; performed a brief, stripped-back acoustic tour; and released a pair of downtempo synth-pop songs that reflected a new sense of resolve. That reinvigorated spirit persists on Crave, Kiesza’s independently released second album, where she compacts emotional and romantic upheaval into tactile electro-pop packed with splashy synths and soaring melodies. Crave is obsessed with overstimulation, both in its gale-force choruses and Kiesza’s plain-faced lyrics. Each touch is electric or addictive, as in the energetic “All of the Feelings” which, down to its title, unabashedly recalls Carly Rae Jepsen’s E•MO•TION era. The festival-primed single rides a jaunty chorus (“I’m getting all the feelings back/You make me believe in love again!”), with verses punctuated with gasps of air and vocal runs that instantly evoke glee. “Run Renegade” pulls off the same feat, dolloping on the nostalgia with delightfully chintzy drum pads and lyrics that urge on the album’s themes of reclamation: “I’m not giving an excuse,” she sings, “because I’m not changing for you.” Crave’s detours from euphoria feel sleekly designed in their own right. Kiesza slips into a more restrained vocal mode on the lithe “Love Me With Your Lie” and finger-snapped “When Boys Cry,” singing in a breathy mid-range that especially suits the former’s disco throb. Yet the maudlin “Love Never Dies,” the album’s lone ballad, dials things down too far, channeling musical theater over a lilting piano melody and funereal drums. It feels like a strange outlier, especially in comparison with her more evocative, emotionally spare one-off ballad “Sweet Love” from last summer. Still, Kiesza’s gut-punch delivery and melodies buoy Crave into a brief, bright pleasure. The title track is an ideal example of the album’s insistence on lifting you out of your bad mood, using Prince-inspired guitar licks and a rubbery synth line to express unfettered longing. Kiesza sounds free and untroubled over stacks of her own backup vocals, ready to give in to an emotional free-fall. It’s impossible not to feel the same exaggerated sense of bliss.

To Feel Embraced,Sparkle Division,by: Madison Bloom,Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f319f32e2e9ed363ec930a4/1:1/w_160/to%20feel%20embraced_sparkle%20division.jpg,2020-08-15 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/sparkle-division-to-feel-embraced/,Temporary Residence,"Disintegration, decay, black holes… these are a few words that might spring to mind at the thought of ambient composer William Basinski, who has somehow made music from all of the above in the past few decades. Two words that probably wouldn’t? Sparkle Division. The unlikely moniker brands Basinski’s creative partnership with his collaborator and studio assistant Preston Wendel. Basinski and Wendel have spent the past four years conceptualizing and recording their debut album To Feel Embraced, and the result is a heady cocktail of free jazz, exotica, dub-lounge, disco, and just about every genre that could be described as “vibey.” Conceived and largely completed in 2016, Basinski and Wendel paused the album’s release due to the onset of a bleak political climate and ongoing environmental catastrophe. But now that things have become inconceivably worse, Sparkle Division figured “fuck it.” To Feel Embraced has floated in like a Golden Record from a distant planet, where things are relaxed, joyful, and funky. The star of To Feel Embraced is Basinski’s saxophone, which the composer picked up again following Wendel’s persuasion. Known for his ambient masterpiece The Disintegration Loops, in which the record’s sound is derived from the continual decay of magnetic tape strip, Basinski with a saxophone feels like a white-coated scientist ditching his lab to ride a wild horse. He paints freely with his instrument, unbeholden to the confines or high concepts of his previous work. You can glean from the song titles alone that  Basinski is having fun here. On “Mmmmkayy I’m Goin’ Out Now and I Don’t Want Any Trouble From You!” Basinksi’s relaxed phrases melt into a codeine calypso fortified by canned strings and sparse percussion. He is similarly lax on “You Ain’t Takin’ My Man” and “For Gato,” a pair of lounge lizard ballads seemingly  born of otherworldly settings; the former could score one of David Lynch’s seedy Twin Peaks scenes, and  the latter sounds more akin to Flying Lotus’ spacious, astral jazz. To Feel Embraced is not a project that promotes stasis in any way shape or form—Sparkle Division are far more interested in presenting you with an assortment of vivid scenery. In addition to their flirtations with lounge noir and celestial jazz, Basinski and Wendel dabble in swinging big band (“You Go Girl!”), new age (“To Feel”), and vaudeville (“Queenie Got Her Blues”). “Queenie Got Her Blues” features vocals by Leonora Russo, the late Queen of Williamsburg who died in 2016 and was mourned by locals across the borough. On the brief track, Russo sounds like she’s leading a ragtag marching band, singing and laughing through a tin can while her disciples back her with spirited brass. It’s a sweet and affectionate send-off from Basinski, who referred to Russo as “my Brooklyn mom” (Russo is the stylish nonagenarian gracing the album art, decked out in shining accessories and red lipstick). “Oh Henry!” is another tribute, this time for the late avant-garde jazz bassist Henry Grimes who died in April. Basinski’s simple, clean saxophone passages are chopped with rattling snare fits and unexpected, staccato bass rhythms, which demonstrate Grimes’ unique command of the instrument. Displaying his technical proficiency on the track was not Grimes’ only priority, he was also concerned with the song’s practical application. “Lotta babies gonna be born from this one,” he said of the track prior to his passing—another indication that To Feel Embraced is an album of serious artists making music that is more concerned with immediate joy and emotional exploration than decay or deep space.

The Versace Tape,Boldy James,by: Paul A. Thompson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f3553000ba085b2422374c4/1:1/w_160/versace%20tape_boldy%20james.jpeg,2020-08-14 05:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/boldy-james-the-versace-tape/,Griselda,"The Versace Tape is the third album the Detroit rapper Boldy James has released in the last six months. It follows February’s The Price of Tea in China, a skeletal but psychedelic collaboration with the acclaimed Los Angeles producer Alchemist, and last month’s constantly molting Manager on McNichols, which was helmed by the veteran but comparatively obscure Sterling Toles, from Boldy’s hometown. Versace pairs the rapper with someone from, well, the internet: Jay Versace, the former Vine star who has lately turned to producing music. It was a surprise this spring when Versace popped up in the credits of Westside Gunn’s Pray for Paris; The Versace Tape is Boldy’s first album for Griselda Records, the label co-founded by Gunn, and fits neatly into a machine that promises steely, ambitious street rap, delivered at regular intervals. Boldy’s catalog has the quality of genre fiction: his songs hit familiar notes and live in an instantly recognizable milieu. The style is repeatable without being repetitive, its dials tweaked slightly for each new iteration. The Versace Tape’s intro smartly signals that the rapper has refitted his approach for Griselda Records, whose releases––especially Gunn’s––are littered with, and in some ways defined by, references to luxury goods. This intro is a local news clip about a thief who walks into a gas station and steals a “very expensive pair of Cartier glasses” right off of a victim’s face before sauntering out the door and into a waiting car. The police, this news anchor says, described the suspect as “bold and nonchalant.” That nonchalance is one of Boldy’s signatures; it’s slyly funny when, on the already muted “Maria,” he deadpans that all the money he’s been raking in is making him emotional. Early on “Brick Van Exel”––he can cook with his left hand––Boldy recalls two generations of his relatives growing into the drug trade. The moment is allowed to land, but not linger; there are instructions about burner phones and stern warnings to give. Later on in the same song, he raps, “Every time I met up with the plug, felt like a setup,” before once again dropping that idea to follow a new tangent. This structure and affect makes his music compulsively listenable, because it suggests these stark personal revelations and jaw-dropping asides will be meted out consistently, as if from a metronome. They are. Versace’s beats are similarly reliable. It is perhaps ironic that such an antic internet personality is turning out beats that fit so neatly in the post-Dilla, -Madlib, -Marcberg world of contemporary underground street rap, where drums are of little concern and loops are often laid bare. This album is warm, as if it was all dipped in sepia. To that point, one of the most pleasantly surprising aspects of Boldy’s work this year is the sentimentality that creeps in at the margins. “Long Live Julio,” one of the record’s standout tracks, begins with an ad-libbed redux of a famous Eazy-E hook, where the “boys in the hood” are not meant to be menacing and mythic, but rather young and full of promise, frozen in memory. Boldy throws the song into fourth-period lunchrooms and cramped bathrooms where he’s scrubbing Nikes with a toothbrush; he makes the life sentences that hang over murder cases sound like speedbumps in his school parking lot. Even in these moments, though, Boldy is the consummate technician. From the time he says “Rest in peace, Eric Wright” at the song’s beginning, he never strays from that rhyme pattern; it strings together prayers to God and homage to Fredo Santana. This trio of 2020 albums suggests that the windows into an artist’s past, soul, and psyche can be pried open not only in fits of mysterious inspiration, but also by relentless, uniform effort.

What Could Possibly Go Wrong,Dominic Fike,by: Dani Blum ,Contributor ,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f3171dc4a81119dc842fba1/1:1/w_160/What%20Could%20Possibly%20Go%20Wrong_dominic%20fike.jpg,2020-08-14 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/dominic-fike-what-could-possibly-go-wrong/,Columbia,"If you haven’t had a substantial conversation with anyone under the age of 25 or been on TikTok over the last six months —if you are, say, a label executive with money to burn and a fuzzy, Post Malone-shaped image of what Kids These Days are into —Dominic Fike might sound like the future. The 24-year-old Florida singer won a multi-million dollar record deal shortly after he got out of jail for violating house arrest tied to an alleged battery of a police officer; he didn’t have any actual finished music to instigate the bidding war, just a few demos kicking around the Internet. But for trend-chasers, that was enough; he moans when he sings, his face is smothered in tattoos, and the beats change with the grace of an accidentally opened browser window—how do you do, fellow kids!? On his debut album, though, Fike proves to be no pioneer—he’s just the latest shrugging embodiment of streaming trends. Fike, or whoever runs his marketing campaign, bills himself as “genre-less” or genre-bending, which is an accurate, but not revolutionary, statement. Billie Eilish zigzags through Soundcloud rap and piano pop ballads. Taylor Swift makes ""indie"" music now. Drake continues to wriggle through so many styles it barely registers when he adopts a new one. The songs engineered to go viral on TikTok contort through genres and textures, so that a 15-second snippet that whirls around the app can sound completely different from the rest of the song. Over What Could Possibly Go Wrong's 34 minutes, Fike swerves from crooning over swelling strings to Brockhampton-esque treated vocals to raspy raps over chaotic guitar licks, sometimes all in the same song. ""Joe Blazey"" halts its muffled vocals midway through for an audio of what seems to be Fike confessing to a panic attack; when the music starts again, the song shifts into sinister bass, as he hisses about ""going dark mode"" in a hotel bar. On “Why,” he shows off a palatable boy-band croon. The blithe, catchy “Chicken Tenders"" starts with whiny, pitched-up vocals clearly cribbed from Frank Ocean. By the time the song's two and a half minutes are up, the track has mutated into a call-and-response pop tune with a twitchy electronic drum pattern while Fike proclaims “The best part of my day is/When I get to see you naked.” These are claustrophobic songs, and even aside from some of the more grating production choices (the extraneous outro on “Wurli” that morphs from elegiac strings into a siren-like blare, the sound effect of a baby crying in “Florida”), the lyrics prove equally suffocating. The album focuses on fame, which often seems like a confusing choice (Fike has 492,000 followers on Instagram; Doug the Pug has 4 million). “What’s it like being famous?” he asks himself on “Good Game.” “Hollywood doesn’t need a reason to make you think you look bigger than you are,” he wails on the self-serious “Politics & Violence.” “I hope they cancel me,” he chants on “Cancel Me,” a trollish track that's currently coursing through TikTok and seems desperate to provoke. “I hope I get Me-Too’d,” he says on the final verse;  it’s yet another upsetting  statement designed to provoke on an album in which he also says, “I done took an L on every corner like a swastika."" For the majority of the album, though, Fike strives to be aggressively palatable, another aspect of the sound that makes these tracks seem like TikTok bait. For all their incessant beat switches and transformations, these songs end up largely breezy and buoyant, opting to create a vibe rather than to telegraph any actual emotion. He may get credit for what happens next, but ultimately, the future of popular music is on the same course it's been on for the last year: regardless of, and maybe despite, this album, there was always going to be an upcoming slew of artists that sound just like Dominic Fike, slouching towards virality.

Shutting Down Here,Jim O’Rourke,by: Daniel Felsenthal,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f31776d2425c767bd346f98/1:1/w_160/shutting%20down%20here_jim%20orourke%20.jpg,2020-08-14 05:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/jim-orourke-shutting-down-here/,Portraits GRM,"In 1990, Jim O’Rourke visited the studio of the Groupe de recherches musicales (INA GRM) in Paris. The experience was monumental for the guitarist, budding composer, and 21-year-old college student. Back at DePaul University in Chicago, O’Rourke’s teachers, he once told an interviewer, “were just trying to mold you into becoming professors.” In Paris, he was meeting his heroes, radical luminaries of the mid-century avant-garde, particularly the concentric genres of musique concrète and acousmatic music. O’Rourke’s latest, Shutting Down Here, is billed as his return to INA GRM 30 years after he made his first pilgrimage. This narrative might seem like a bit of sentimental marketing boilerplate, but his 34-minute piece slots brilliantly into the history of the French studio, which pioneered the musical uses of field recordings and noise, along with the notion that compositions could exist only as recordings, as opposed to pieces meant to be performed in concert on traditional instruments. For O’Rourke, who rarely plays live, and whose pedigree as a composer is rivaled by his crackerjack sound design and engineering—he mixed Yankee Hotel Foxtrot and Ys, to name a couple of touchstones—the GRM philosophy fits well. Importantly, though, he pushes back against the studio’s orthodoxy by employing instrumental collaborators and ensuring the sources of his found sounds are recognizable. Shutting Down Here melds noise and melodic ideas so seamlessly that the piece works as both tape music and as contemporary orchestration, reminiscent of John Adams’ similarly audiophiliac The Dharma at Big Sur. This isn’t O’Rourke’s first venture into the symphonic—or acousmatic—sphere. A spiritual sister to Shutting Down Here, his 1995 album Terminal Pharmacy balanced bracing car sounds with delicate instances of cello and woodwind. Shutting Down Here has a similarly mammoth dynamic range: It tempts you to crank up the volume to hear the swelling harmonics that begin the record, then turn it down again when a door slams. There are spectral piano chords, courtesy of Eiko Ishibashi, and a bit of trumpet in the last 10 minutes, played by Elvind Lonning. Yet in consummate musique concrète fashion, O’Rourke treats these orchestral elements like a computer musician layering blocks of sound, not a composer writing for the various pieces of an ensemble. During the decades since his first visit to INA GRM, O’Rourke has worked on hundreds of albums that span rock, folk, classical, and, most thrillingly, the gaping maws between these varied styles. He’s turned ambient music into a journal-like daily practice with his prolific Steamroom series. He played rock star in the early ’00s, helping Sonic Youth scale peaks of both accessibility and audacity during his five years as a member of the band. Shutting Down Here, with its moments of moving consonance, gives the impression of a polymath coming full circle, approaching a very early passion with honed skill. The result feels personal and even direct, both strange words to hang on O’Rourke. Whenever we’ve expected the musician to embody these qualities—for example, on his excellent Drag City-released songwriter albums—he subverted our expectations with his famously evasive sense of humor and bleak worldview. His detractors have sometimes taken umbrage with O’Rourke’s slipperiness, as though the trait were invariably a pose, rather than a reflection of the musician’s character. Shutting Down Here is further proof that wordless abstraction is O’Rourke’s way of being candid. His album is almost memoiristic, even though it eschews the literal for the heady crafts of recording and arrangement. Revisiting a studio that captured his imagination as a very young man, he chips away at his wit and irony to reveal a feelingful core. Yet Shutting Down Here never sacrifices the knotty complications that make his work far weightier than a mere genre study. This is a personal record, after all, and knotty might just be a big, welcome part of who Jim O’Rourke is. Catch up every Saturday with 10 of our best-reviewed albums of the week.

Unity,Gordon Koang,by: Marty Sartini Garner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f319caa72e13ea74d3ffda3/1:1/w_160/unity_gordon%20koang.jpg,2020-08-14 05:00:00,Global,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/gordon-koang-unity/,Music in ExileLight in the Attic,"The king of South Sudanese music has been living in a suburb of Melbourne since 2014, a refugee of his home country’s civil war. Blind since birth, Gordon Koang was a prolific writer and star in South Sudan, with ten LPs to his name. He was in the middle of an international tour when he decided not to return to home, fearing for his safety as members of his ethnic group, the Nuer tribe, were being killed in pogroms. Koang did not release music for a half-decade in Australia, until connecting with Music in Exile, a nonprofit that links refugee musicians with the country’s network of indie venues and infrastructure. Unity is his first new album since leaving South Sudan, and his first attempt to articulate what it means to be an artist who exists between states. For Koang, this isn’t just a geographical issue. Across Unity’s eight songs, he calls on his home country’s many ethnic groups to find common ground, celebrates the bond between audience and musician, and longs for an eventual reunion with his wife and children, who he hasn’t seen since arriving in Australia. The combination of Koang’s South Sudanese thom and the group of local indie rockers who make up his band produces an energy to match the music he made back home—a pleasant surprise, even if they sometimes struggle to figure out how to use it. (South Sudanese percussionist Paul Biel, Koang's cousin and fellow refugee, also contributes.) The thom is a harp-like instrument similar in sound and appearance to the East African krar. Koang plays it as both a rhythmic and melodic instrument, making it sound something like a Delta blues guitar or a detuned kora. His melodies unfurl in long, legible lines that he doubles with his vocals. Though his earlier music was largely backed by drum machines and synthesizers, he knows how to command a live ensemble, egging them along with his instrument and daring them to keep up. His bandmates step cleanly into the tight pockets he creates, and they move along at a parade-march pace. While Koang is capable of leading the band wherever he wants to go, at times it’s not clear where they’re headed. With the thom setting the pace, the songs skip and skitter with frantic, locomotive energy. When properly harnessed, as in the pulsing “Stand Up (Clap Your Hands),” that energy nearly matches the incredible highs of his concerts. But the longer cuts here don’t progress so much as they dilate, stretching beyond what feels like their natural run times without pursuing any kind of melodic or rhythmic development. “Mal Mi Goa” opens with a synth that shimmers like a gold curtain, but the instrument dutifully settles into a simple rhythm pattern for the rest of the song’s eight minutes. Absent any real soloing or groove-digging, the lack of movement can be stultifying. But Koang’s charisma is strong enough to pull the listener through when the album starts to stall. Whether he’s singing in English, Arabic, or Nuer, he emotes like someone who’s used to making himself heard over raucous crowds, and he knows precisely where to push into a higher register. On the intricately melodic “Stand Up,” Koang prods his listeners to join him and the band on stage, rounding out the chorus by declaring “we love you, audience.” He reels notes out of his thom, nearly cackling with delight as he sings along. His palpable sense of purpose keeps the mood bright, even when the subject matter turns dark. He counsels his fellow exiles in “Asylum Seeker,” advising patience and good cheer as they wait for new visas. On closer “Te Ke Mi Thile Ji Kuoth Nhial,” he sings across the ocean, sending comfort to his family as the band splashes blue chords behind him. Shortly after Koang finished work on the album, the government granted him his permanent protection visa, making it possible for his family to finally join him in Australia. “There’s a lot of change here” Koang told The Guardian of his new country, “[but] now it’s home.” Unity is a reflection of his in-between existence. It’s indelibly shaped by his Australian bandmates, and it’s of a piece with his South Sudanese roots; happiness and grief wind their way through nearly all of these songs side by side. There’s joy in these liminal spaces, Koang makes clear, setting up shop inside and inviting the audience to join him for a dance.

7G,A. G. Cook,by: Chal Ravens,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f3198d02c4729486dbcb3ee/1:1/w_160/7g_a.%20g.%20cook.jpeg,2020-08-13 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/a-g-cook-7g/,PC Music,"The PC Music philosophy boils down to two things. One: Normal people can be pop stars. Two: Avoid the middle ground at all costs. Pop music becomes extreme music in the hands of PC Music’s chief architect, A. G. Cook, whose penchant for artifice has yielded concepts like QT, the fictional pop star with a fictional energy drink to promote. So it comes as a surprise that on his debut solo album, A. G. Cook strips away the glossy packaging. On 7G—a 49-track collection of songs, sketches, cover versions, and studio experiments—he hands us the keys to the studio and invites us to take a look around. Cook’s skills as a songwriter, producer, and A&R have taken PC Music from the fringes to the main stage in the seven years since the London collective was founded. Their exuberant, abrasive tunes attracted attention for hoovering up all kinds of music usually dismissed as naff, cheesy, or empty-headed—subgenres like hardstyle, nightcore, and ’90s Europop—and polishing them as bright as a Jeff Koons balloon dog. Dismissed by some as ironic or parodic, the whole enterprise has ended up as a foundational influence on the current strand of hyperpop bubbling up at the limits of the mainstream, including neon-brushed characters like Dorian Electra, Rina Sawayama, and 100 gecs, who credit PC Music as one of their biggest influences. Cook has released music through many aliases (Life Sim, DJ Warlord, numerous PC Music collaborations like QT and Lipgloss Twins) but under his own name, he is best known for his work as an executive producer, notably on Charli XCX’s recent run of mixtapes and albums. 7G takes a magnifying glass to this strand of his career, breaking down his work as a pop songwriter and pointing to his diverse (and sometimes unexpected) influences, from Squarepusher to the Strokes. The 49 tracks on 7G are divided into seven “discs,” although there’s no physical version of the album. (The title feels immaterial too—a wink to our high-speed future, with possible conspiratorial overtones.) Each disc takes a different sound or effect as its theme: drums, guitar, piano, spoken word, extreme vocals, and, most characteristically, supersaw and Nord, a beloved line of Swedish synthesizers. Supersaw, the waveform created by Roland for its JP-8000 synthesizer, is recognizable as the sound of trance, as well as in the fizzing melody lines that cut through PC Music confections like Hannah Diamond’s “Every Night.” And against the lemon-sharp supersaw is the soft-as-cream Nord, used by Cook as dreamy cushioning for his Auto-Tuned collaborators. As an archival collection, 7G attempts to show Cook’s creative process from various angles—cross-sections of works in progress, from half-baked ideas to fine-tuned pop nuggets—even though the instrument-based taxonomy yields some strange sequences, with scrappy experiments followed by full-tilt anthems. Some tracks are simple sketches: “No Yeah” is a 54-second tone-poem of whispered vocals and “Drum Solo” is just that. Others offer clues to the stages of evolution that Cook’s material passes through on the way to becoming a hit: The breathily arpeggiated “Idyll” incorporates a shape-shifting riff that’s also been used by Cook’s alias Life Sim and on Charli XCX’s “Track 10.” Some of the best bits are more like volatile lab experiments to be handled with rubber gloves: “Waldhammer,” for instance, captures what happens when you pour a test tube of Beethoven into a bubbling vat of white noise, while the digital mirage of “Note Velocity” sounds like an encounter between Steve Reich and the impossible genre of black MIDI. A cover of Tommy James and the Shondells’ 1968 psych-pop single “Crimson and Clover” pits guitars against supersaws in a Weezer vs. Scooter deathmatch; no one survives. Scattered throughout are some fully realized compositions, complete with melodies, hooks, and intricate arrangements. “Dust” opens with ear-scraping horror chords before mutating into stompy sparklepop histrionics. “Life Speed” is a 150 BPM lap of Mario Kart, careening through checkpoints and leaving glittering smoke in its wake. “Lil Song,” a collaboration with Oneohtrix Point Never, floats along like a lullaby. The 2-step gem “Show Me What” shines the spotlight on L.A.’s Cecile Believe and her glitched-out melisma, while chopped-up vocals from PC Music original Hannah Diamond are splattered across the IDM vistas of “Acid Angel.” Outliers all, these not-quite bangers feel a bit restrained, as if they didn’t qualify for the final sprinkling of magic dust that turns a studio sketch into an all-out pop epic. (It’s likely that Cook is still incubating a full album of the latter; last August he took the mic on “Lifeline,” a jacked-up power ballad that doesn’t feature on 7G.) Elsewhere, a handful of cover versions transform megawatt rock hits into scruffy garage-band jams, as if Cook & co. had frittered away a few empty studio hours by learning other people’s songs. And what rehearsal session hasn’t been brightened by a successful stab at “Today” or “Beetlebum”? Even a confirmed avant-gardist can appreciate the comfort blanket of an old MTV2 staple. The “guitar” disc contains several echoes of this impulse, via washed-out pop-punk (“Undying”) and an “unplugged” rendition of Cook’s 2016 single “Superstar.” Other covers fall closer to home, including a faithful version of Charli XCX’s “Official” and a fist-pumping take on Sia’s “Chandelier” featuring Caroline Polachek, whose own experiments with artifice—particularly the way she’s trained her own voice to reproduce the glitchy textures of Auto-Tune—have made her a natural ally to PC Music’s cyborg mission. When Polachek first visited Cook’s London studio in 2017, she was taken aback by his “insane dedication” to following through on extreme ideas; that day, he was mixing a note-for-note cover of Aphex Twin’s “Windowlicker.” The scale and intensity of Cook’s ambitions are laid bare on this outsized collection, a glimpse at the whirring cogs beneath hyperpop’s pristine casing.

"Last Year Was Weird, Vol. 2",Tkay Maidza,by: Beverly Bryan,Contributor,"https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f317943737965ef488275b0/1:1/w_160/last%20year%20was%20weird,%20vol%202_tkay%20maidza.jpg",2020-08-13 05:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/tkay-maidza-last-year-was-weird-vol-2/,4AD,"The line between what is alternative and what is mainstream becomes blurrier every day, which is good news for artists who don’t occupy one space or another. Things have especially been opening up for Black women, who historically have had to contend with even narrower expectations from the music industry than other female artists. It’s hard not to see this trend in the trajectory of Tkay Maidza’s career. Initially signed to Universal Australia and moving among smaller labels tied to majors, the Adelaide-based singer and rapper is now signed to the London indie label 4AD. Maidza’s first release with them, Last Year Was Weird, Vol. 2, is an EP/mixtape that feels like a second debut at a moment when the world might be more ready to process an artist with her unique combination of ambition, pop aptitude, and quirkiness than it was when she released her actual debut four years ago. During her early development as an artist and slow rise to international recognition, Maidza seemed at times unsure of how to position herself. As a Zimbabwean-born Australian with a knack for gliding across the borders that separate pop, hip-hop, and electronic music, she can be forgiven for her uncertainty. On her 2016 debut album, Tkay, she channeled Santigold and M.I.A. in a sing-song derived from soundsystem culture on electro-rap party jams. Her rapped verses were fluent and vivid but a bit too indebted to Azealia Banks. “Castle in the Sky,” leaned strongly in the direction of Little Dragon’s sound at the time. Last Year Was Weird, Vol. 2, the second installment of a planned trilogy, frames the 23-year-old artist fully as herself. She’s reunited with Tkay and Last Year Was Weird Vol. 1 producer Dan Farber for this release, who crafts eight varied tracks that allow her to showcase her versatility. “Awake,” featuring JPEGMAFIA, and “Grasshopper,” two dark and filthy trap productions with a case of UK drill envy, give Maidza the opportunity to rap hard while nimbly switching up flows. On the minimal, mid-tempo “Shook” and bouncy house number “24k” she goes for speed. Amid these different modes, she finds room to move freely, eventually touching down in terra firma of her own. Movement, particularly flight, is a motif on Vol. 2. The album opens with a lo-fi hip-hop track titled “My Flowers” where Maidza drawls reflectively about her petals taking flight. Later, “24k” is introduced by an announcer for “LYWW radio” speaking from “30,000 feet in the air.” It’s a theme that suits her well in this moment, where the first-generation Australian who has spent the past several years touring and travelling displays a sensibility that’s a little bit of everywhere and also nowhere specific. While a hint of grime creeps into her style on “Grasshopper,” she strikes a distinctly Californian tone when crooning cooly to the sunny bedroom pop of “You Sad” and the trippy funk of “PB Jam.” You can almost hear Maidza’s passport getting stamped as she goes from song to song. Adventurous as it is, Vol. 2 ultimately lands in a pop space and Maidza is, indeed, a pop star — albeit a habitually code switching one making third-culture pop music. It’s something her influences pioneered and something she’s learning to do her way in this series of mixtapes. In addition to flight, metaphors of blossoming and emerging from a chrysalis crop up throughout this release, underscoring themes of growth, lessons learned, and flexing newfound confidence. The narrative is convincing. Well into her career at 23, she sounds wise but not jaded, armed now with as much self-knowledge as raw talent. Vol. 2 arrives in an era where self-created alt-pop stars such as FKA twigs and Grimes are commonplace, left-field rappers like Princess Nokia, with whom Maidza has toured, have real clout, and electro-flamenco artist Rosalía wins Grammys. Each artist who bends the conventions of their genre widens the possibilities for the next artist who enters the field, allowing them to work without worrying as much about how they will be categorized. It’s an atmosphere more conducive to the expansion of Maidza’s gifts than the one she started out in, which bodes well for Vol. 3.

Lickety Split EP,Martyn Bootyspoon,by: Philip Sherburne,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f3436d75f8d91c2a3aaecab/1:1/w_160/martynb.jpg,2020-08-13 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/martyn-bootyspoon-lickety-split-ep/,2 B Real ,"Under the Lothario-like nom de plume of Martyn Bootyspoon, Montreal’s Jason Voltaire makes sexed-up club music that’s deliberately tongue in cheek. He got his start under the influence of booty house and ghettotech fixtures like DJ Assault and DJ Funk, Midwestern producers who brought a sly, lascivious spirit to house and techno. When Voltaire discovered them as an impressionable, extremely online adolescent, something clicked: As he told FACT, “Hearing something like DJ Assault’s ‘Ass N Titties’? That’s just gonna stick with you.” But Voltaire, the son of Haitian and Guyanese immigrants, also credits an influence closer to home: the campy sense of humor that’s endemic to his native Quebec. Recalling French Canada’s history of novelty disco and other records “not to be taken seriously,” he approvingly told Radio Primavera Sound’s Line Noise Podcast, “There’s a lot of slapstick and tacky things that happen in Montreal.” Bootyspoon’s first appearance on record, a cameo on former Montreal producer (and Kanye collaborator) Sinjin Hawke’s 2011 EP The Lights, falls under the category of things not to be taken too seriously. Over Hawke’s rapturous soundscaping, Voltaire imagined swan-diving into the oceanic depths of his object of desire, nasally ad-libbing a libidinal stream of consciousness about his “world of pretense” and “oversexed personality.” But over the past few years, Voltaire’s acumen as a producer has begun to eclipse his antics. On 2018’s Silk Eternity EP, for Hawke and Zora Jones’ Fractal Fantasy label, his heavy-lidded come-ons couldn’t disguise the force of his sternly percussive club beats, and on last year’s No. 1 Crush EP, his production got both beefier and more psychedelic. Lickety Split, for London’s Local Action label, showcases his most assured work yet and confirms that while the Bootyspoon persona is unabashedly extra, his grooves are ruthlessly efficient. Though he was initially inspired by bare-bones ghettotech, Voltaire covers plenty of ground on these five tracks. The relentless hi-hats of the hard-charging “Lickety Split” recall the drums of the classic 1995 anthem “Flash”—a signature tune by Chicago house ringmaster Green Velvet, whose over-the-top stage presence is an obvious antecedent for Bootyspoon’s role-playing. “Resonant Freq,” though, hops the Atlantic to plug into sounds and textures more closely associated with grime, like brooding squarewave bass and stark, minor-key string-synth stabs, all of it as chilly as a spell in Wiley’s igloo. “KEYGEN 2 MI H34RT,” the record’s furthest stylistic outlier, melts down Bootyspoon’s usual club reference points into a detuned goo of trance stabs and sickly-sounding Auto-Tune. The glue holding together these disparate ideas is Voltaire’s appealingly gravelly baritone growl. On the title track, he chops up stray syllables, breaths, tossed-off asides (“You know I’m tryna get lit”), and callbacks to the mother of all vocal fry; he’s so seductive, he can make a question like, “What’s in your Amazon wish list?” sound dirty. He’s more fanciful on “Ice Cream Mane,” where he urges, “Think about me in the summertime, because I’m cool on a hot summer’s day/I’m the ice cream man, baby/Cooler than the Atlantic spray.” His voice  grabs your attention first, and his production keeps it: With dissonant, 8-bit bleeps drizzled over a slippery electro pulse, the track is as experimental as it is effortlessly propulsive. The most interesting cut on the EP, “Airdrop,” is largely instrumental, relegating the voice to a colorful strip of vocoded tone. Over a muted 4/4 kick, electronic marimba and synthetic bell tones pulse and clang around scattershot snares. For all the song’s percussive intensity, there are virtually no conventional drum sounds at all; the overall effect is of a kind of weaponized new age, at once bruising and meditative. A swirl of bright, glassy tones, it moves without obvious direction, unpredictable as a weather system. Far from Martyn Bootyspoon’s occasionally slapstick tendencies and typically carnal thrust, it offers a glimpse of the Montreal musician in a headier, more serious mode.

Prole Art Threat,East Man,by: Hubert Adjei-Kontoh,Associate Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f3162ff2425c767bd346f5d/1:1/w_160/prole%20art%20threat_east%20man.jpg,2020-08-13 05:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/east-man-prole-art-threat/,Planet Mu,"Prole Art Threat takes its name and credo from a Fall song; according to Anthoney Hart, who produces grime under the name East Man, the title is “a reflection of working-class creativity and how the establishment marginalize us and (perhaps on a subconscious level) see us as a threat.” To that end, he works with others to build an autonomous zone, inaccessible to the powers that be. Bare spaces and micro drum hits form its otherworldly terrain. Spend time with it, and you’ll get a sense of what type of world he and his collaborators would like to see. East Man’s futuristic approach to grime is to strip the already elemental genre to its sparse essentials. His beats jitter out of empty space, full of unpredictable decisions. Bubbling clicks and dulled drum hits permeate the album, and the BPM rarely falls below 130. Every now and then, the vaporous reflection of one voice will float over the original for fractions of a second, giving the MC another chance to be heard. When Brazilian rapper Fernando Kep features on “Ourobouros,” even though his sped-up intonations and singsong rhymes are unique, he locks right into the mix. Three collaborators from 2018’s Red, White, & Zero—Darkos Strife, Lyrical Strally, and Eklipse—guest here, and their precise rhymes match the liquid propellant of East Man’s music. Newcomer Ny Ny falls upon the percussive orbitals of “Who Am I?” with a sense of purpose, moving deftly around a morphing structure made up of wood-paneled knocks and phasers, maintaining stability through boasts and dares: “I’m out of the box, they can’t box me in/I’m orthodox so unique it’s a sin/I walk my own path, best believe I will win.” East Man’s productions throw up constant obstacles, like bass that drops out without warning, and echoed clatters that slice through the vocal tracks. It adds drama to the performances: any rapper who can sprint through this minefield untouched is ready for whatever dystopic future awaits. In the liner notes to Red, White, & Zero, the writer and theorist Paul Gilroy argued that for young people in London, “The scale on which life is lived has shrunk.” It’s clear that the horizon is even more limited now than when he wrote those words two years ago; it’s tough to imagine large-scale change when you’re stuck inside your own home. On Prole Art Threat, East Man and his collaborators reject the defeatism that comes from this realization. East Man’s productions are built out of sparse material, while the improvisatory zeal of his collaborators leads them to find novel ways to communicate. Together, they seem to say that change can only come from ditching what doesn’t work, while constantly searching for what does.

Eight Gates,Jason Molina,by: Andy Cush,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f315659eb982d18c453dd11/1:1/w_160/eight%20gates_jason%20molina.jpg,2020-08-12 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/jason-molina-eight-gates/,Secretly Canadian,"Jason Molina’s songs are like unfinished houses. Wander the hallways late at night and you might open a doorway that leads nowhere, or look to the ceiling and find the moon staring back. Though the late Ohioan songwriter could write a rousing melody, he rarely offered them fully formed. Instead, he drew your ear toward the cracks in the edifice: placing an expanse of near-silence where a chorus might go, or emphasizing the empty space between someone’s high harmony vocal and his own distinctively damaged tenor. On Molina’s best albums, this vacancy is a virtue, imbuing the music with a sense of magic and mystery to match his lyrical preoccupation with the phantasms of memory and regret. The holes in the wall are invitations for spirits to come in. Molina wrote and recorded Eight Gates while living in London in the late 2000s, where—according to press materials from his longtime label Secretly Canadian—he claimed he was recovering from a bite from a rare spider, writing in a letter about doctor appointments and drug prescriptions for which no medical records exist. Whether Molina was suffering a delusion or engaging in artistic myth-making is unclear, but he was on the cusp of real and dire challenges to his physical health either way. Ten months after the January 2009 recording sessions that produced this material, he cancelled a planned tour, blaming unnamed health issues. He never recorded or performed publicly again after that. In 2013, he died, at age 39, from complications related to alcoholism. Secretly Canadian presents Eight Gates, unheard until this posthumous release, as something like his final statement. Like Molina’s classic albums, Eight Gates documents songs that are still in the process of becoming, a snapshot of their neverending journey toward a nonexistent final form. But given the nature of the release, it’s unclear what is an artistic effect and what is a more literal case of unfinished work. The album’s nine songs pass in 25 minutes, with several barely crossing the two-minute line—practically unheard-of for an artist who regularly sprawled out to six or seven. Some songs are plainly not done, like “She Says,” which fades out after a bit of studio banter and a single acoustic-strummed verse. Others sound more or less complete, like “Shadow Answers the Wall,” built on pensive organ chords and an uncharacteristically lithe drum pattern, coming off like Molina’s take on the rhythm-forward music Radiohead was making around the same time. The songs of Eight Gates are often beautiful, but they can feel a bit like cues in a film score without an accompanying visual, hanging around for long enough to establish a mood but disappearing before they have a chance to progress. The palette is drastically limited—guitar, organ, cello, a bit of bass, hardly any percussion—and deployed with painterly aversion to excess, allowing subtle changes to instrumental inflection to serve as major events. These sounds are miles from the rangy rock of Magnolia Electric Co., the amorphous band Molina fronted for much of the 2000s. They have more in common with the pitch-black folk of Ghost Tropic and The Lioness, albums Molina released under his Songs: Ohia alias at the beginning of the decade. The most confounding and moving material is the most difficult to assess in terms of completeness. “Whisper Away,” the opener, and “Thistle Blue,” the penultimate song, are like a room and its reflection in a broken mirror. Their arrangements, and introductions, are nearly identical: drones of organ and strings, with sharp, delicate electric guitar chords occasionally slashing through. Both move slowly, even by Molina’s standards, building tension without release. The latter contains the album’s most evocative lines: “Black bird and thistle blue/Whose wilderness has my heartbreak wandered through?/Whose questions have I left to go unanswered?” The former addresses a similar transience, one of Molina’s great themes. It could also be read as a premonition of death, or a comment on the ephemeral character of the music itself: “Whisper away the howling universe/Pale against something, pale against what/Hiss and the fading, the dying radio.” Their haunting arrangements are rich and deliberate, but as compositions they are not wholly realized; neither song feels complete without the other, and even then the image is fragmented. Is their uncanny duality a result of Molina's mastery over his art, or was he simply still working through this material when he went into the studio that day? For a listener approaching Eight Gates a decade later, how much does it matter? Secretly Canadian muddles the issue slightly by giving Eight Gates the veneer of an album, rather than presenting it as a collection of archival material, holding it to a standard it shouldn’t have to meet. Molina released albums prolifically before his withdrawal from public life, sometimes at a rate of two per year. He was not shy about putting out material he’d recorded quickly, or that which showed its rough edges clearly. He once released a collection of album outtakes that was four times longer than the album itself. In spite of this open-book approach, the Eight Gates material sat on the shelf for four years of his life. It’s not unreasonable to wonder whether he considered it a whole and successful body of work, or whether he wanted people to hear it at all. Still, regardless of his or his label’s intentions, it’s possible to hear Eight Gates as a fitting tribute. In its blank spaces, it reflects the spectral quality of his greatest music, albeit sometimes for different reasons. Catch up every Saturday with 10 of our best-reviewed albums of the week.

"Boots No. 2: The Lost Songs, Vol. 1",Gillian Welch,by: Grayson Haver Currin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f318473d124eb14f7a690f3/1:1/w_160/boots%20no%202%20the%20lost%20songs%20vol%201_gillian%20welch.jpg,2020-08-12 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/gillian-welch-boots-no-2-the-lost-songs-vol-1/,Acony,"By the end of 2002, when Gillian Welch recorded the tunes that constitute Boots No. 2: The Lost Songs, Vol. 1, she had fully arrived as an unexpected popular apostle of Appalachian folk music. A California kid raised by showbiz parents and inculcated in songcraft at the Berklee College of Music, Welch cut a promising figure in the teeming alt-country landscape of the late ’90s. Her keening voice made her songs about hardscrabble folks and imminent hellfire feel as old as the hills from which she hadn’t come. But her upbringing prompted puritanical concerns about authenticity and appropriation, as if she should apologize for sincere interest in one of her country’s bedrock forms. For some, though, as the United States quivered with the onset of endless war in 2001, Welch and her steadfast harmony partner, David Rawlings, seemed a national salve. Pushed into the spotlight by the frame-shifting soundtrack of O Brother, Where Art Thou? and the concert film that followed, the couple felt trustworthy and inspirational, a charming portrait of aspirational America that might have been plucked from Grant Wood’s imagination. Welch didn’t shy from darkness, either. Her contemporaneous album, 2001’s Time (the Revelator), explored the country’s vile underbelly, particularly the sense that we were exploiting one another into oblivion. One of the young century’s first masterpieces, Time (the Revelator) tapped the past to contextualize present anxieties and offer the occasional jubilee. What other role should modern folk music play? Buoyed by this sudden success, Welch resolved she could finally break from the publishing contract she’d signed nine years earlier—she was a successful singer-songwriter now, not merely a writer for hire. During one productive weekend at home in December 2002, six months before releasing the aching Soul Journey, she and Rawlings pored through more than 100 notebooks. They turned scraps of discarded songs into enough quick recordings to fulfill her contract before it renewed January 1. Those 48 tunes languished in storage boxes for nearly two decades, until the tornadoes that swept through Nashville in March and the financial uncertainty of the COVID-19 pandemic prompted Welch and Rawlings to excavate them. Taken together, the resulting three volumes of Boots No. 2: The Lost Songs—a nominal follow-up to 2016’s Boots No. 1: The Official Revival Bootleg, a collection of outtakes from her 1996 debut—will effectively double the painstakingly patient musician’s catalogue. (Volumes two and three are to follow in coming months.) Singing and playing just to get the job done, she and Rawlings have never sounded so nonchalant on record as they do here, delivering these songs with the candor of an afternoon band rehearsal. Effortlessly balancing light and dark, this first batch of 16 songs is an essential distillation of her ability to tell detailed stories open for endless interpretation. Welch’s best songs have always evoked mystery. Ambiguity and intrigue are her essential inheritance from the old records and songbooks she internalized. For Welch, the listener should come away from a song with more questions than answers. Time (the Revelator) was her masterclass in that regard: Its elliptical epics teased connections between the Dust Bowl, Abraham Lincoln’s assassination, and the sinking of the Titanic, and then (presciently) asked what music might become when stripped of all value. Boots No. 2 plays like a workbook of exercises on that enigmatic mode, a set of three-minute delights that reveal just enough of a story to electrify the imagination. You may ask, for instance, what exactly happened to the downtrodden protagonist of the tender “Chinatown,” neglected by the postal service and ignored by sunshine until even flowers became phantoms. Why were the Bonnie-and-Clyde couple of “Honey Baby” on the lam, and how did they arrive at the gallows? You’ll pity the exhausted outlaws in “Apalachicola” and “Shotgun Song” while wondering about their crimes. Even “Mighty Good Book,” which first scans as a bounding gospel tune fit for a churchyard picnic, revels in equivocation. “Are you gonna wish you read the story/Of when Jesus paid it all?” Welch sings, rendering commandments as questions, as if to tell you she doesn’t have the answer, either. There are simpler pleasures, too. “Little Luli” is an irrepressible ode to a proud woman who shakes down traveling men while shaking for their dimes. “First Place Ribbon” relates the story of the shoeless and itinerant Kathy, wooing the boys and evading the preachers as she travels with the fair. Such anachronisms may sound like cosplay, but, for Welch, they’re echoes of the past made resonant again. These are glorious tributes to the wiles of rebellious women, sung in solidarity by someone pushing back against a powerful industry herself. And Welch seems to have reserved “Back Turn and Swing,” a lithe country dance tune, for the perfect moment. Above spring-loaded guitars that beg for a bluegrass band, Welch acknowledges life’s troubles but celebrates the thrills of dancing with friends and guzzling wine. It’s a testament to perseverance and the promise of better days—a timely reminder that hard times come and, with luck, go. Good news for the music industry has been particularly illusory in 2020—canceled tours, scrapped sessions, delayed releases, Spotify investing $100 million in Joe Rogan. One unanticipated boon has been a change in temperament among some typically exacting artists, who have lowered their guards to put out music, long-shelved and new alike, with less premeditation or preciousness. (What else do you do during endless quarantine?) The same impulse has compelled Taylor Swift’s folklore, a high volume of low-stakes live albums on Bandcamp, and a stream of hard-drive (or tape-reel) dumps just like Boots No. 2. In July, Welch and Rawlings released an off-the-cuff covers album, imperfectly captured on tape during quarantine. Welch and Rawlings are a famously fastidious pair, self-proclaimed perfectionists who once spent eight years fretting over an album. This meticulousness has sometimes been fodder for critics who say authentic folk music shouldn’t be so calculated. Boots No. 2 should quell that gripe once and for all. Here they are at home during a wintry Southern weekend, churning through songs good enough to be standards by the dozen. They play and sing with an intimacy so easy it seems as if they’ve forgotten the tape is rolling at all. Catch up every Saturday with 10 of our best-reviewed albums of the week.

Harbors,Ellen FullmanTheresa Wong,by: Jonathan Williger,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f32ebb1e2e9ed363ec931b2/1:1/w_160/harbors_ellen%20fullman%20theresa%20wong.jpg,2020-08-12 05:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/ellen-fullman-theresa-wong-harbors/,Room40,"The buzzing hum of Ellen Fullman’s Long String Instrument engulfs its surroundings. As the composer walks in a stately manner between parallel arrays of 70-foot steel and bronze strings, her rosin-coated fingers gently stroking the thin wires, rapturous drones emerge, the tones enfolding each other like tiny fibers being spun into yarn. Wooden resonators are attached to the metal strands, allowing even the most subtle gesture of her hand to fill the air around her. The Instrument, which Fullman invented in 1980, is capable of transforming a room into a resonating body, its contours and contents vibrating along with the strings as they activate the entirety of the space. It often takes up to five days of calibrating and tuning until the instrument matches the reverberant qualities of wherever it is being installed. It is quite literally tied to its environment. Fullman’s invention is surprisingly versatile given its simple design, and she has performed and recorded with musicians across the avant-garde spectrum, including Pauline Oliveros and members of her Deep Listening Band, guitar duo Barn Owl, percussionist Sean Meehan, and cellist Okkyung Lee. It is another cellist, Theresa Wong, that has been Fullman’s most consistent foil, and Harbors, their first album as a duo, is the culmination of over a decade of steady collaboration. The enveloping nature of the Long String Instrument provides a unique challenge to those who accompany it, and Wong tends to position herself in a supporting role, coloring the drones with swells of low-end, wisps of high-pitched harmonics, and punctuating thrums of pizzicato. Rarely does she attempt to tease out melodies from within Fullman’s rich, harmonically complex chord clusters, making the music less traditionally accessible but enhancing its mystery and subtlety. The first and third parts of Harbors are predominantly dense, with Fullman demonstrating the expansive capabilities of the Long String Instrument as Wong’s cello fits snugly inside its drones. As “Part 1” ends it begins to unravel, you can hear Fullman shuffle across the floor as Wong responds to each sweep of the Long String Instrument with mournful harmonics, foreshadowing a more sparse “Part 2.” The second movement, quiet and dissonant, features both Fullman and Wong plucking the strings of their instruments, the sharp sounds reverberating in markedly different ways throughout the room. This contrast, felt as Fullman once again begins her deliberate march across the room at the beginning of “Part 3,” is almost shocking as the space suddenly comes alive with sound. Harbors was inspired by the confluence of nature and commerce in the San Francisco Bay. The vast, undulating sound of the Long String Instrument evokes the dual rolling of fog and waves, and the rumble of passing ships can be heard as Wong slowly tugs her bow across the cello’s lower strings. But the album feels more nuanced than a simplistic one-to-one musical translation of the soundscape of the Bay—its three unique parts provide a murkier narrative that seems self-contained. What comes through is the sense of awe that arises when staring off past the water’s edge, and its relative stillness in an otherwise urban environment, as it is transmitted through suspended strings and fills the performance space. While other minimalist composers have cosmic ambitions, Fullman’s music is terrestrial, rooted not only in the inspiration she takes from her surroundings but also firmly bound to the place in which it is realized. A recording is an imperfect conduit for the power of the Long String Instrument. That isn’t to imply that Harbors is deficient as a composition or that the performances are somehow lacking, but rather that music that invokes such a dramatic physical presence feels different when being heard on speakers at home, or even the more immersive sonic environment of headphones. However, in a time when most of us are confined to very specific spaces, the same ones we’ve likely been in for months, there’s power in music that asks us to place ourselves elsewhere, exploring other spaces with our minds. Harbors might feel one step removed from its ideal setting, but in a time of isolation and physical stasis it feels like an escape to inhabit these sounds as they saturate the air in a permeating cloud of overtones, wherever you may be.

"Goodbye, Nowhere!",Double Grave,by: Ted Davis,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f3165f5737965ef488275ad/1:1/w_160/goodbye%20nowhere_double%20grave.jpg,2020-08-12 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/double-grave-goodbye-nowhere/,Forged Artifacts,"While Midwest emo may have originated in Middle America during the genre’s late-’90s heyday, it eventually found a home on the coasts. Much like Seattle’s Sunny Day Real Estate and Philadelphia’s Algernon Cadwallader fit into a scene thousands of miles from its epicenter, the band Double Grave gracefully adopted the sensibilities of the late 2010s Northeastern slowcore revival from their home state of Minnesota. On the trio’s second record, Goodbye, Nowhere!, themes of vast physical and metaphorical emptiness provide a backdrop to songs that sullenly grapple with getting older and trying to remedy the pitfalls of adolescence in the rear-view. It holds up alongside distorted post-shoegaze classics but stays true to its chilly northern roots. Goodbye, Nowhere! Came to life during a period of personal growth and self-imposed solitude for lead singer Jeremy Warden when he and his bandmate-turned-fiancée Bree Meyer took a break from living together for the first time in a decade. Lead single “The Farm” deals with the predictability of recurring desolation, and “Long Drive Home” confronts the difficulty of trying to open one’s heart in a world where stoniness is an essential trait. The lyrics about feeling like pure garbage and its fuzzed-out whammy guitar initially sound like a soundtrack to getting home from school and throwing down one’s backpack in a huff. But the mysticism in the album’s fascination with death and alienation shows that Warden is, in fact, reflecting candidly about the grim realities of transitioning into “real adulthood.” Goodbye, Nowhere! has strong intentions and great musicianship, but its production value is frustratingly mid-fidelity. It exists in a lackluster middle ground that sounds like the demo of any hard-working but unremarkable bar band playing in the scene of a small city. It sounds cheap, but it never feels thrifty. It’s why the album can play like a New England “type beat.” Having opened for bands like LVL UP and Pile, Double Grave roam in the same sphere as many of the indie rock bands that came before them, and their music at times feels like a derivative of the artists they have shared stages with. While hazy indie is an easily classifiable genre, the best artists within its niche aren’t those that simply duplicate the doomy Duster-style jamming that Double Grave can totter into. The record’s more percussive instrumentals, like “Slime,” play like every song on Ovlov’s first record Am mashed into one. All this is more or less the byproduct of a band coming into their own sound, an invisible process akin to the worries of aging Warden touches on throughout. The sorrow that churns through the album feels dramatic and forlorn, but the neurosis in Warden’s songwriting gives the record heart. “Hard times keep coming down on me/I don’t know where I went wrong/I try to be cool and friendly/But nobody wants me/Nobody cares,” Warden sings on the stripped-down closing track “Too Late.” This kind of snow-dusted misery throughout Goodbye, Nowhere! is what makes the best slowcore records stand out in an oversaturated scene.

Limbo,Aminé,by: Sheldon Pearce,Contributing Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f29a61357711eb22855a4c6/1:1/w_160/limbo_amine.jpg,2020-08-11 05:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/amine-limbo/,Republic,"In 2017, Aminé had a moment: his debut album, Good For You, introduced him as a happy-go-lucky rascal, and the lead single, “Caroline,” went multi-platinum. The project he released the year after, ONEPOINTFIVE, squandered some of that good will, catering to trendy trap and straying from the outsider charms that initially made his music so interesting. On his new album, Limbo, he’s more pragmatic, suddenly concerned with crafting a sustainable legacy, and this new attitude produces the best music of his career. Aminé’s shift was inspired at least in part, by the death of NBA icon Kobe Bryant. (“That was like seeing Superman die,” he said.) On “Kobe,” Aminé’s friend, comedian Jak Knight, speaks of Bryant as a benchmark, his death a symbolic end of innocence. To Aminé, the tragedy represented an unofficial start to his real manhood. The shock seems to have loosened something in him. The verses on Limbo are much more relaxed, the hooks are catchier, and his outsized personality radiates. He mixes subtle bouts of introspection with kooky references to Jim Carrey’s The Mask, Allen Iverson’s infamous “practice” speech, and the guy in the AllState commercials. It would be an overstatement to call the album mature, but it does seem to exist in a transitional state between carefree youth (as embodied by Good For You songs like “Sundays” and “Yellow”) and real adulthood. On the opener, he raps, “Beat so cold it made Aminé want to open up,” and the album is reflective of that accessibility; he sounds uninhibited. Limbo isn’t exactly The Big Day, but he places more importance on being responsible and dependable, pondering what it means to be a better son and a potential father. “To my future daughter or son/The streams from this album gon’ pay for your college funds,” he raps on “Fetus.” He’s also eager to reposition himself. On “Shimmy,” which puts a reanimating spin on an ODB classic, he’s on the comeback trail, getting his groove back “like Fela, not Stella” and shaming fake flexers. OnePointFive was mired by lackluster rapping, but the studio time wasn’t wasted by Aminé’s producer Pasque, who took the opportunity to experiment with off-center trap beats. Armed with those lessons, his work on Limbo feels like a progression, and additional production from Injury Reserve architect Parker Corey makes this Aminé’s best-produced album. He has always been a child of Drake, as a tune-happy flirt from an unlikely rap market, but on Limbo he leans into the comparison. He acquires moody beats from Drake producers Boi-1da, T-Minus, and Vinylz, and “Can’t Decide” and “Riri” are exactly the kind of rap-sung hybrids that the Toronto rapper built his empire on. It seems apparent that Aminé is thinking with that career trajectory in mind. Aminé is more conscious of the big picture on Limbo, but there are still a few glimpses of the nonchalant scamp he used to be, and some of the most enjoyable songs on Limbo are least invested in assessing his standing. On “Compensating,” he pals around with Young Thug and comes up with his snappiest melodies. He embellishes his punches on “Pressure in My Palms” with slowthai and Vince Staples sharing a verse and matching his energy. In the first verse alone, he references an Arthur meme, Steve Harvey’s Miss Universe gaffe, Fergie peeing her pants on stage, Winona Ryder shoplifting, and the Malice at the Palace, relishing the absurdity of each one. These songs aren’t just high-spirited, slightly goofy, and unassumingly clever; they have a lightness that is invigorating. They feel like proof that the fun-loving kid who went viral in 2016 hasn’t yet been entirely overwhelmed by the burdens of reputation.

Help,Duval Timothy,by: Hubert Adjei-Kontoh,Associate Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f286a5270927e98035cc433/1:1/w_160/help_duval%20timothy.jpg,2020-08-11 05:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/duval-timothy-help/,Carrying Colour,"The diaspora haunts the work of Duval Timothy, the multidisciplinary artist and pianist who splits his time between England (where he was born) and Sierra Leone (where his relatives reside). On his 2018 EP 2 Sim, Timothy blended WhatsApp voice messages and interviews from “family, friends and peers in Freetown, Sierra Leone” into minimal, piano-focused compositions. In a mix made for NTS Radio the same year, he interspersed these compositions with snatches of sounds captured from Instagram video— Cardi B ranting about racoons, Saul Williams urging young rappers to listen to Rachmaninoff—and grime and hip-hop tracks. On Help, his latest album, Timothy works with a number of collaborators from the London scene—Mr. Mitch, Vegyn, and Lil Silva to name a few—to create a piece of music that takes equally from modern jazz and UK bass. With their help, Timothy sings the song of a community that he carries within him, voicing their past oppressions even in his most abstract pieces. Timothy constructs a vast castle out of his reference points making music that feels filled with the spectres of the past. “Slave” is a dark room constructed out of looping piano melody, furnished with guitar from Twin Shadow, and illuminated only by the song title, sung by his partner Ibiye Camp. Into this room enters a sampled Pharrell Williams, musing on the fact that it is common for record labels to own the masters of the artists they sign. Timothy is intimately aware of this practice; he only recently purchased back his own masters. To underscore Williams’ point, he hammers on the piano when Williams appears on the scene, as if registering his own assent. Its follow-up, “TDAGB,” goes even further; the title comes from a slowed-down and sped-up recording of Timothy’s sister saying, “Things don’t always get better, it’s not just a matter of time till everything works out.” The words are not a blanket dismissal of change as much as a clear-eyed reading of colonial history. Slavery may be over, but when Prince couldn’t get his masters back from Warner Brothers 30 years ago, he called himself a slave. On Help, these troubled legacies guide him, prodding him to examine history and memory. On “Fall Again,” the pianist’s triplets are slowly surrounded by Melanie Faye’s wandering guitar, and as the two snake around each other, they are joined by Lil Silva. Reverb expands his voice, creating a choir of one. The lyrics sympathize with the loneliness of wanting to change when you are feeling “cold in the deep and you’re all alone.” Like the gospel songs it evokes, “Fall Again” posits that this feeling is nothing new; saints have made mistakes, too. Listen closely to the ghostly strains of “Like,” a quilt of layered vocals stitched together with piano; it’s a scrambled, halting monologue, degraded until you can only hear the titular word. Though the progressions he plays seem simple at first listen, he manipulates them by adding an extension to a chord here or a spare note there. It sounds like he’s feeling his way through the dark, trying to recover some elusive but crucial memory. The motif of “Slave” guides Timothy through the ruminative back half of the album. Its rhythm is the basis for Timothy’s improvisation on “Ice,” its chord progression can be heard on “C,”  and its theme can be heard through the digital mist of the Pat Metheny-esque “Morning.” The repeated motifs play into the album’s themes— of history, individuality, ownership. Timothy’s collaborative sensibility comes from a distinct sense of rootedness; the people who made him and the artists he’s listened to are the links that make up his music. He finds liberation in this inescapability and makes himself too expansive to be owned. Catch up every Saturday with 10 of our best-reviewed albums of the week.

"Live at Goose Lake: August 8th, 1970",The Stooges,by: Evan Minsker,News Editor,"https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f29afeea638d133e6dbaf39/1:1/w_160/Live%20at%20Goose%20Lake-%20August%208th,%201970_the%20stooges.jpg",2020-08-11 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/the-stooges-live-at-goose-lake-august-8th-1970/,Third Man,"The promoter behind the 1970 Goose Lake International Music Festival near Jackson, Michigan promised a good time. His newspaper ad announcing the three-day event wished “peace” to all the “brothers and sisters” who wanted to see Jethro Tull, Chicago, Faces, Bob Seger, the MC5, and a dozen other bands for $15. It wasn’t quite the nightmare that Altamont had been the previous year, but government officials in Michigan decried it as, essentially, a shitshow. The 200,000 in attendance more than tripled the expected capacity, and they were all prohibited from leaving the grounds’ barbed-wire fence enclosure. Sketchy drugs were everywhere, which caused over 500 people to be treated for bad trips on the first day alone; multiple reports emerged of people ingesting “cocaine” or “PCP” that turned out to be horse tranquilizer. The governor later made a public speech decrying the “deplorable” Goose Lake problem and the promoter was indicted for promoting the sale of narcotics. This was the fittingly chaotic scene of what turned out to be the Stooges’ final show with their original lineup. The band’s Goose Lake set took place one month after the release of Fun House, and that entire summer, they performed their brand new masterpiece in its entirety while Iggy Pop built his legend as an unhinged performer in front of bigger and bigger crowds. In Cincinnati earlier that summer, he was filmed in his dog collar and long silver gloves smearing peanut butter on his chest, mid-crowd-surf. Consider what it must have felt like to see the Stooges perform “1970” in 1970 at a sweaty outdoor music festival—heaving forward with the current of the crowd when Iggy thrashes into the front rows, hearing him repeatedly scream “I feel alright” while Ron Asheton rips through one of his best hooks. Then, with the adrenaline sky high, you can feel the kick of Scott Asheton’s bass drum in your chest as Steve Mackay’s freeform sax solo folds chaos and frenzy into the band’s hypnotic “Fun House” groove. It’s psychedelic music with wild menace, and it’s all anchored by the lithe little Michigan goblin flailing unpredictably somewhere near the front of the stage. It absolutely rules that Third Man is putting out a live Stooges album from this period, and at the same time, it makes perfect sense why Iggy voiced hesitation about officially sanctioning the newly unearthed Goose Lake audio. It’s an infamous night in Stooges lore. The Jim Jarmusch documentary Gimme Danger, for example, mostly distills this event into two distinct story beats: the bad drugs that Iggy took right before the set and the firing of bassist Dave Alexander right after the set. The legend goes that Iggy went into a tent “with some wild people,” took what he thought was cocaine, and suffered temporary amnesia just moments before he went onstage. He pulled it together, but looked over at Alexander, who was apparently too fucked up to play anything. Iggy said Alexander froze and didn’t play a note; Scott said someone unplugged Alexander’s amp. Either way, Iggy fired the bassist immediately after the show, closing the book on the lineup that made The Stooges and Fun House. So the biggest surprise about Live at Goose Lake is that the Stooges’ performance transcended the long-held narrative that this wasn’t a great show for them. If you’ve ever loved a Ron Asheton guitar solo or hook, know that this album’s brimming with those. If your love of Fun House is defined partially by Mackay’s sax performance, absolutely buy this record and listen to his work on the B-side first. Iggy, meanwhile, delivers all the nuances required of performing the music from Fun House. He sings gently, he shouts with authority, and—why not—he even incites a minor riot. Iggy briefly flouts “TV Eye”’s actual lyrics, and in apparent frustration about festival security not allowing him to stage dive, he starts singing about the “big ol’ wall” and screaming “RAM IT.” A security guard, interviewed by Creem’s Jaan Uhelszki for the Goose Lake liner notes, confirmed that this was the moment people in the massive crowd started to rip planks off the front of the stage. As for Alexander, his presence on the album is a major selling point of Third Man’s Live at Goose Lake LP. The late bassist’s supposed non-performance has been the gospel of biographies, documentaries, and Iggy interviews for years, but you can hear Alexander’s bass all through this newly released audio. So yes, he was playing and he was plugged in, but no, he did not play a perfect set. There are stretches of “Loose” with palpable gaps where there should clearly be bass, and there are other sections where Alexander is either behind the beat or playing the wrong notes entirely. And to his credit, he often shows up when it counts most. “Dirt” hinges entirely on Alexander’s trudging, climbing bassline, and he’s absolutely there, doing the work of establishing the song’s foundation. But then he’s spotty for significant chunks of two crucial numbers: “1970” and “TV Eye.” That void is disorienting and distracting—especially when you stack these performances next to his work on Fun House. Goose Lake is not the careful work of the Stooges in Elektra’s L.A. studio, and it doesn’t have the luxury of the standard crisp production quality of most ’70s live albums (like Bob Seger’s Live Bullet and Neil Young’s Live Rust). The Goose Lake tapes were found recently in a festival sound engineer’s basement, and frankly, they sound like some old tapes you’d find in a Michigan basement after five decades. While the audio is in largely good shape, the vocals wipe out every other instrument as soon as Iggy screams (which happens pretty often here), and there are a couple brief moments during the closing “Fun House” and “L.A. Blues” freakout where the audio drops out completely. The impressionistic and imperfect sound quality of Goose Lake ultimately feels fitting for a record that captures some of the band’s less performative and more human moments. The flubs, stage banter, audience chatter, and interstitial tuning all make it feel like a breathing historical document in a way that even the Stooges’ studio albums can’t capture. Turn up the volume for everything that happens between the fuzz and the screaming—the moments when everybody on stage is catching their breath—and you can imagine what it was like to watch this unbelievable band on a Michigan summer night somewhere in the sea of bodies and drugs.

The Jacknife Lee,Jacknife Lee,by: Hannah Jocelyn,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f284af544c3ee52a02c5177/1:1/w_160/The%20Jacknife%20Lee_Jacknife%20Lee.jpg,2020-08-11 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/jacknife-lee-the-jacknife-lee/,Slow Kids,"Jacknife Lee’s discography has historically moved in two very different directions. His production credits for acts like U2 and Snow Patrol display a penchant for self-serious adult-contemporary rock; like the nu-metal mashups of Missy Elliott and Eminem that brought him notoriety around the turn of the century, his solo music has aimed for far lower stakes, looping trite lyrics (“I like it/I like it, yeah”; “I really love it and it’s making me money”) over uninspired big beat. On The Jacknife Lee, the Irish producer shows us a third way, taking ideas he had deemed “too odd” for other projects and realizing them with the help of a diverse, international group of artists. The results feel like a release of pent-up energy after years of melancholy modern-rock production. A world away from his Kasabian and Two Door Cinema Club commissions, The Jacknife Lee trades modern rock for a melange of rap, R&B, alt rock, dance punk, and global pop. Most of Lee’s guests here are far less famous than the artists he typically works with. Ghanaian-Australian singer Genesis Owusu’s voice shape-shifts over rumbling bass on opener “Flutter”; on “Hit the Bell,”  Toronto rapper Haviah Mighty punctuates an ethereal melody sung by Merge signee Sneaks. All the songs feel like genuine partnerships in which Lee provides a lavish framework for other artists to excel. Lee does best when he leaves his comfort zone to create something completely new alongside his guests. Muthoni Drummer Queen commands “Sisa Wabaya,” in which the Kenyan rapper’s bilingual boasting (the title translates as “We are the bad ones” in Swahili) is accentuated by clipped bass and overdriven percussion. “Firewalls,” with Petite Noir, is constantly shifting, trading slow-burning atmospheres for stranger elements—guttural vocal samples, filtered breakbeats. There’s a winning sense of restlessness to these productions, as though Lee were always on the search for a new noise to insert, another genre to reference. The higher profile the artists, the more predictable (and consequently, weaker) the songs often are. Aloe Blacc feels out of place, and his lovelorn “I Gave You Everything” doesn’t match the innovative qualities of the rest of the album. “Made It Weird” marks swaggering new territory for Open Mike Eagle, but he’s written more compelling anxiety-focused songs before. And a handful of songs are too slick for the mood they’re trying to convey. The defiant lyrics of “I’m Getting Tired” lose some of their power over a backing track—already too similar to Lee’s big-beat solo work—that previously served as Apple keynote background music. The Jacknife Lee improves in proportion to its risk. Veteran adult-alternative acts don’t often have it in them to be as eccentric as Lee can be here, no matter how ambitious they get. There are fans to please, radio singles to push, Grey’s Anatomy syncs to land. But, guided by his long-standing instinct for combining disparate elements, Lee has found new freedom in letting other voices have the spotlight.

Purple Noon,Washed Out,by: Sophie Kemp ,Contributor ,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f2868a5d421092dd8f6cf1c/1:1/w_160/purple%20noon_washed%20out.jpg,2020-08-10 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/washed-out-purple-noon/,Sub Pop,"Ernest Greene seemed like he was finally about to turn a corner on 2017’s Mister Mellow. He switched labels, moving from the long-running Seattle indie Sub Pop to the more beat-oriented label Stones Throw, and shapeshifted samples from crate-digger classics, resulting in an album that felt plucked from the speakers at some chic beachside bar. He wasn’t shattering zeitgeists or anything, but he’d roughed up and tripped out his sound a little bit, creating an album that felt properly realized. His new record, Purple Noon, has Greene back at Sub Pop and opting to make a more streamlined album of innocuous makeout jams; background music that you can put on and forget about. The resulting record is one that feels distilled, extraordinarily meandering, and sometimes too chill even for Greene, the godfather of chillwave. A great Washed Out track is one that rejiggers and reimagines otherwise forgotten dance music. Usually this means some combination of sleazy Italo Disco, cultish disco tracks, and funk from the ‘70s and ‘80s. On Purple Noon, Greene seems most interested in yachty Balearic pop, and the results are mixed. “Face Up” is laden with plenty of oohs and ahs, cavernous bass, and whopper-sized production flourishes, the blue-eyed song is sterile, and feels true to its Balearic inclinations. There is, however, something unusually anesthetic about the song; it feels impersonal, hollow, and noxiously relaxing. There is little to no scaffolding here, and the track gives off the vibe of a muzak playing in an empty office building. Greene has always been a bit of an impressionistic songwriter, writing short, simple morsels of verse. Most of these songs are about the dissolution of a mercurial relationship with a lover. On “Paralyzed,” he sings about their amazing chemistry, and how much he longs to see her again. “Each time I think about/You doing those things that drive me wild/Makes me go crazy at the thought,” he coos, like a lost member of the Rat Pack, over a celestial synthesizer and a lazy drum machine loop. The pulsating “Reckless Desires” is meant to be listened to while wearing a pair of boat shoes with a coupe of champagne in hand. Pretty to the touch, Greene isn’t sure what to do about his love interest once again. “You find yourself in someone’s bed again/The lies begin to start/And our story falls apart,” sings Greene tearfully. The statement conveys a sense of intense longing, but there is such a lack of substance in the details. Purple Noon is missing that joy of discovery that makes Greene a compelling artist. He is at his best when he takes elements of eclectic music from the past and bounces them off his otherwise relaxing sound beds. He shines when he successfully reinterprets the music he is excited about, and that does not happen at all on this record. Diving into Balearic music here seems too obvious for Greene, there is not enough high-contrast tinkering for the results of this record to be anything other than expected. On his past records, Greene has mixed oil and vinegar together, creating music with a satisfying difference in density that might be chill but is never boring. What we have on Purple Noon is more like the product of mixing two different tomato sauces together and then adding a dash of some vaguely horny, cursed relationship drama into the mix. Over a decade into his career, Greene is more than capable of producing technically interesting music that comes across as deceptively simple. Unfortunately, Purple Noon falters and feels too safe and lacking in substance. Catch up every Saturday with 10 of our best-reviewed albums of the week.

Cover Charge: NC Artists Go Under Cover to Benefit Cat’s Cradle,Various Artists,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f285322d421092dd8f6cf12/1:1/w_160/NC%20Artists%20Go%20Under%20Cover%20to%20Benefit%20Cat%E2%80%99s%20Cradle_Cover%20Charge.jpg,2020-08-10 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/various-artists-cover-charge-nc-artists-go-under-cover-to-benefit-cats-cradle/,self-released,"Things change slowly at Cat’s Cradle, the storied North Carolina rock club that turned 50 last year. It took half that time to meander from a basement in Chapel Hill through several nearby locations to its current home in a Carrboro shopping center, half a mile from where it began in 1969. One thing you can say about North Carolinians: We grow deep roots. It’s a testament to the Cradle’s history that some of the area’s biggest bands recorded covers to help the iconic East Coast tour stop outlast the pandemic. The result is Cover Charge, a whopping 25-song set with far more riches than a charity project requires. Carrboro, the former mill town that started collecting artists when Chapel Hill got expensive, is central in the music scene, but nobody ever talked about the “Carrboro sound.” When the Cradle moved there in 1993, the club was already inextricable from Chapel Hill and indie rock. Hell, it could probably move to Durham (like Merge Records did) or Raleigh—the other cities that make up the loose conurbation we call the Triangle—and still not shake the association. The Cradle began as a coffeehouse-folk spot, and like most midsize rock clubs, it has grown into more polyglot bookings—shy of techno, anyway, which throbs at one of its former haunts, now Nightlight. But the early ’90s cast a long shadow. In that myth-clouded time, Cradle denizens like Superchunk, Archers of Loaf, Squirrel Nut Zippers, and Ben Folds put Chapel Hill on the map for more than UNC basketball. Major-label A&Rs showed up to find the next Nirvana, who of course had played the Cradle, and national magazine writers showed up to construct the new Seattle. Sonic Youth enshrined the club’s name in a song called “Chapel Hill,” and Merge was setting the national indie-label mold. A hodgepodge of weird little bands were being mashed into a canonical sound. It’s natural that this brief but influential era radiates through Cover Charge. It could only begin with Superchunk, whose members founded Merge and defined the snotty, rambunctious pop-punk most associated with Chapel Hill. They’re also the rare golden-age band that has lasted without hiatus; their effortless cover of The Go-Go’s’ “Can’t Stop the World” shows why. And it’s inspired to conclude with The Veldt, who risked being forgotten beyond the great “Soul in a Jar” until their reformation several years ago met with a critical renaissance, in a climate more open to a Black shoegaze-soul band than those lily-white days were. They imprint their lush but desperate sound on their cover of Madonna’s “Dress You Up.” The leap isn’t as far as it seems—in the ‘90s, even Madonna was checking for Chapel Hill bands. In between, Cover Charge spans a range of great moments in Triangle music history, the keenest bridging then and now. The name The Mayflies USA probably only means anything to a subset of late-’90s indie fans. By the time they came along, national attention had largely moved on and the internet was about to redraw the landscape of regional scenes. Archers and Polvo had just broken up, and Superchunk had a string section. The Mayflies were the new national buzz-band most likely to carry the torch. Their sleek, soaring sound almost seemed like a repudiation of their squalling predecessors, so it’s interesting to hear the very early-‘90s vibe they bring to The Smiths’ “There Is a Light that Never Goes Out,” like a handshake across the decades. Though Archers are finally releasing some good new songs 10 years into their reunion, they don’t show up—but Eric Bachmann does, and his duet with one of the Triangle’s best contemporary singer-songwriters, Skylar Gudasz, is an unexpected and delightful choice. In his folksy Crooked Fingers mode, Bachmann reminds us that his Archers croak is a decision, not a limitation, and the duo’s tender version of The Everly Brothers’ “All I Have to Do Is Dream” is the freshest moment here. This only scratches the surface of Cover Charge, which is stocked with other scenes and eras that have passed through the Cradle. There’s the ‘90s alt-country surge that gave us Tift Merritt, who thankfully is included, and Ryan Adams, who thankfully isn’t. There’s the motley ’80s college rock before the indie-rock boom: the jangle-pop of The dB’s, the jammy Americana of The Connells, and the chicken-fried rockabilly of Southern Culture on the Skids, a retro strain that Flat Duo Jets carried on into the alt-rock ’90s. This list doesn’t even touch on some of the biggest names here, such as Durham residents The Mountain Goats, Hiss Golden Messenger, and Iron & Wine, or many of the last decade’s vanguard: Mandolin Orange and Mount Moriah, Mipso and The Love Language. It doesn’t touch on soul singer Faith Jones’s brilliant rendition of Buffalo Springfield’s “For What It’s Worth,” which breaks open the song’s ’60s time capsule to spill into the turbulent modern world beyond the Cradle’s walls, or the Marshall Crenshaw cover by Florence Dore that incited the whole project. It’s just too much, in a wonderful way. I don’t remember for sure what my first indie-rock show was, but the first one I remember was at the Cradle. I don’t remember The Comas’ set, but I’ll never forget the underwater feeling of the sound and lighting. I became a Comas stan, an indie-rock snob, and a music journalist at the Cradle, all in a short span, and then its tastes broadened with mine to encompass Ghostface and James Blake and onward. In short, when I die, I want to find myself on the Cradle’s smoker’s patio. It and many venues like it across the country need your help.  This comp is no waste of money even if you’ve never set foot in Carrboro, and every venue exists in an ecosystem that feeds bands from one place to the next. It’s imperative to keep them all alive so they can continue to change slowly and change lives for 50 more years. Catch up every Saturday with 10 of our best-reviewed albums of the week.

Dreamland,Glass Animals,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f2daa5bbcc4654c5fe16cd4/1:1/w_160/dreamland_glass%20animals.jpg,2020-08-10 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/glass-animals-dreamland/,Polydor,"Glass Animals have achieved an enviable and increasingly unusual form of modern success: They’re both wildly ubiquitous and anonymous. The Oxford band’s streaming numbers can be measured in billions, and they’ve popped up on every late-night show and festival fairground without revealing anything that might immediately distinguish them from, say, Electric Guest or Neon Trees. But Dave Bayley intends to fix that on Dreamland, describing the creation of the band’s third LP on the opening track and later referring to himself as “Wavey Davey.” In place of the sci-fi leanings and character studies of 2016’s How to Be a Human Being, Bayley makes his own humanity the story: a global citizen born to Welsh and Israeli parents, raised in Massachusetts and Texas before moving to the UK at 14, equally transfixed by the reclusive studio geniuses behind Pet Sounds and The Chronic 2001. But Glass Animals albums were never an ideal place to bare one’s soul, and Dreamland comes across like a guy trying to tell you his life story in a packed Coachella tent. Though it’s as steeped in late-Clinton referentiality as any vaporwave record—witness Glass Animals’ ingenious Windows 98-styled website—Dreamland lives in a near future that will never happen. Less than two months ago, Glass Animals were still set to debut Dreamland at Bonnaroo 2020, the kind of environment that’s been very kind to bands like them: the ones who can filter more distinct variants of indie-leaning hip-hop, pop, and electronic music into a smooth, white caulk filling in the gaps between a Live Nation or Goldenvoice-financed lineup headlined by some permutation of Run the Jewels, Tame Impala, Chance the Rapper, and the Strokes. Glass Animals have wisely updated their approach by wringing out the more waterlogged psych-pop elements of breakthrough hit “Gooey,” revealing a band more conversant with rap, more American than proudly British nerdlinger polymaths like alt-J and Everything Everything. After putting in behind-the-scenes work with Joey Bada$$, 6lack, and Wale, Bayley flaunts his connections in moments that provide jarring contrast with Glass Animals’ reliably sync-able synth-pop. Denzel Curry brings his fire-breathing energy to a guest verse on “Tokyo Drifting” that sounds beamed in from a completely different festival stage. The inclusion of Top Dawg engineer Derek Ali almost justifies a Dr. Dre namedrop on “Space Ghost Coast to Coast,” though I’m sure Bayley would justify rhyming “big dicks and big ol’ titties on the sly” with “bonafide Aquemini” (from “Waterfalls Coming Out of Your Mouth”) in any case. For the most part, Dreamland’s use of hip-hop production is less obtrusive and off-putting, taking advantage of a particular memory loophole that causes 2016 to feel more distant than 1999. The rippling, Malibu-scented beat on “Tangerine” is blatant “Hotline Bling” homage, while the gelatinous guitars on “Heat Wave” could be plucked from any number of “wavy hip-hop” sample packs meant to emulate Frank Ocean’s “Ivy” on a bedroom producer’s budget. Two years ago, such sounds would’ve had the foul smell of something just beyond its use-by date. Now, they’re basically public domain. None of the musical choices really align with Bayley’s attempts at world-building: The lyric sheet is densely packed with references to Scooby-Doo, “The Price Is Right,” Dunkaroos, Capri Sun, Pokémon, kickball, GoldenEye 007, Hot Pockets, Mr. Miyagi, hologram glasses, and Doom, like so many “only ’90s kids will remember this” memes. A more generous take is that Dreamland’s comprehensive survey of late-2010s algorithmic pop is Bayley’s strategy to become a Matty Healy or Frank Ocean-style double agent: a guy whose music frequently soundtracks the boutique-hotel pool parties, VIP pop-up lounges, and upscale clothing stores populated by the targets of his social critique. He chides someone for “posting aerial photos of you and your smoothie,” while confiding that “sometimes B-sides are the best songs,” calling back to more insightful singles by the 1975 and Frank Ocean. Meanwhile, Bayley’s own “too much quinoa and online shopping” feels plucked out of an iPhone 5S note full of manbun and cronut jokes. Made by people too young to remember a pre-internet society, Dreamland instead indulges in that relatable and ultimately feeble longing for a time where we were just less online and more present in our personal relationships. But what’s the difference between scrolling through your Instagram feed and watching Bayley get lost in his memory bank? His sense of alienation isn’t particularly original or all that contemporary, and worse, Dreamland falls prey to the unfortunate mode of modern branding that conflates personal nostalgia with making a point.

The Hijinx Tape,Germ,by: Nathan Smith,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f29a8daa5c3d16bbd60ff44/1:1/w_160/the%20hijinx%20tape_germ.jpg,2020-08-10 05:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/germ-the-hijinx-tape/,G*59,"The rap label G*59 is the brainchild of $uicideboy$, the New Orleans rap group consisting of cousins Ruby da Cherry and $crim. The underground duo have flipped a tried-and-true formula into international touring dates and millions of Spotify streams, combining Raider Klan’s love of Southern rap samples with the self-destructive lyrical tendencies of emo rap. But G*59 is more than a  flagship group, as the label attests with the latest release from Atlanta rapper Germ, The Hijinx Tape. Germ is a punk-rap court jester and skater-turned-rapper with a voice that’s as aggressive as it is gleeful. Though his highest-profile project thus far is the collaborative DIRTIERNASTIER$UICIDE EP—a release that showcases the “suicide pimpin’” house sound, as Juicy J’s adlib describes it—Germ stems from a different stylistic lineage than his peers. He’s capable of the tongue-twisting, Lord Infamous type flow that is the bread and butter of $uicideboy$, but it’s not his preferred mode of delivery. There’s a power to Germ’s rapping, but unlike G*59’s crown jewels, Germ is pure Atlanta, owing as much to YSL and 1017 as he does to underground internet rap. He’s collaborated on two mixtapes—the Big Bad Gnar Shit series—with fellow Atlanta rapper and skater GNAR, both of them members of the city’s younger generation that owes a massive debt to the mixtape runs of Gucci Mane, Future, and Young Thug. There’s little of the metal influence or alt-rock affect of $uicideboy$ either, but Germ still plays with a variety of styles. His voice is, at once, gritty and high-pitched, as confident with tight, biting couplets as he is with smooth vocal runs. In the space of a few bars, Germ will entirely pivot his delivery, like on “AR Pistols,” when he briefly breaks into song amid a precise, exacting verse. Sometimes you can just tell when a rapper is feeling themselves, and Germ always sounds like he’s having a good time—his tape is thoroughly hotboxed, a brash and energetic tribute to the joys of gelato and Girl Scout Cookies. Several of these tracks beg to be the soundtrack to TikTok dances, like the gleefully fat beat of lead single “7 Hunna Horses” or the sharp piano line of “Walked Outside.” Germ’s Atlanta heritage shines through in his occasional soulfulness. On “Plead the 5th,” the rapper says he feels like Usher as he shares his confessions—the beat sounds like a Drake slow jam from the If You’re Reading This It’s Too Late era, with a fluttering trap beat, pulsing bass, and a gentle chorus in the back of the mix. Germ leans into an almost mournful sound on “Runnin Thru Plastic,” as paranoid synth loops soundtrack an outpouring of feeling; his voice cracks like he’s on the verge of tears, but his response to the anguish of emotion is to just roll another blunt. Germ gets introspective over a distorted guitar line on “We Outside,” but it’s much closer to Polo G than the emo rap you might expect from G*59. Germ’s debut solo project, last year’s GERM HAS A DEATH WISH, was heavier on the features—The Hijinx Tape only includes one, from San Fernando rapper Shakewell on “Hellcat,” who balances Germ’s high-pitched shenanigans with his more biting, lower register flow. But Germ’s tracks are short, menacing taunts and sucker-punches more than extended bouts. His personality is so commanding and his songs so to the point that there’s no real need for guest appearances. Germ isn’t just goofing off, his skill is serious business.

The Battle of Los Angeles,Rage Against the Machine,by: Jeremy D.

Thousands of young Angelenos packed into the area to scream along to the quartet’s final live performance before a seven-year hiatus. From the stage, guitarist Tom Morello could see a big screen outside the coliseum showing Hillary and Bill giving their speeches while their guests sipped champagne and dunked shrimp into ramekins of cocktail sauce. In his strident call to action, Zack de la Rocha introduced the concert from the stage: “Brothers and sisters, our democracy has been hijacked!” Not only did the ad-hoc concert fit neatly into Rage’s political animus, but it was also a microcosm for American activism writ large in the 1990s: a multiracial group of pro-revolutionary leftists vs. the white figurehead of elite neoliberalism. The two sides flexed and preened for their respective crowds, separated by a tall barbed-wire fence and a phalanx of riot police armed with rubber bullets and tear gas canisters.

Fuck who I won’t do what who tells me?—on this afternoon in August, the answer was right there, standing at a podium, speaking to his delegates, with silver hair and an Arkansas drawl. Backstage, Morello gave an interview about why this ostensibly liberal band had shown up to protest the coronation of the ostensibly liberal Democratic nominee, Al Gore. “He’s practically indistinguishable from a President George Bush,” Morello said with unequivocal bravado. “They’re both pro-death penalty, both pro-NAFTA, both pro-big business...I don’t feel represented by either one.” When the band kicked into “Guerilla Radio,” the lead single from their third album, 1999’s The Battle of Los Angeles, de la Rocha said as much—including a line about the Republican nominee, branding Bush as the offspring of the corrupt former head of the CIA: “More for Gore or the son of a drug lord/None of the above, fuck it, cut the cord!” A film crew’s birds-eye camera view revealed five mosh pits going off simultaneously. On The Battle of Los Angeles, Rage made clear the aim and origin of their anger, especially for those who didn’t surf to ratm.com in the ’90s to learn the word “praxis” from an animated gif. Here they cast their gaze back through history to reel in half a millennia of theft, enslavement, and slaughter at the hands of the colonial state in the Americas. The gravity of hip-hop and the thick brow of metal met the sincere gaze of radical politics, creating an album that upended the prevailing critical idea of what good rock music should be doing. It was obvious, didactic, heavy-handed, bluntly delivered to the thick of the nation, because you don’t overthrow a racist police state with weepy songs about feeling alienated by technology. What better place than here, what better time than now to empty the missile silos at the so-called New Democrats and crypto-fascist Republicans, to give the opposition contour and dimension, to even embody it themselves, to show the world what an autonomous, dignified life could possibly look like. “There was this interesting thing that was happening during the Clinton administration,” de la Rocha would later tell the Los Angeles Times. “People were looking inward and not outward, and not addressing what was going on.” The malaise of the ’90s—a tone set by the self-defeatist laconism of Gen X—settled in during eight years of relative peace and economic prosperity under Clinton. While the bull market lined the pockets of the growing professional class, Clinton’s legislative victories broke from traditional liberal values and ballooned inequality in America. His disastrous welfare reform gutted the core tenet of the New Deal; his administration deregulated banking, allowing the most powerful financial institutions to amass unseen amounts of capital until they were “too big to fail” in the crash of 2008; they passed the abhorrent 1994 crime bill, the most sweeping in American history, a steroid injection to the carceral state that put thousands of disproportionately Black men into newly constructed prisons and increased the number of federal death penalty cases from three to 60. Most egregiously, and perhaps most important to Rage lore, was the North American Free Trade Agreement. The treaty sought to accelerate the economy by opening borders between the U.S., Canada, and Mexico. In doing so, it moved profit away from workers and their communities toward business owners and shareholders, all while crippling unions and the American labor force, who could now be replaced by unconscionably cheap labor. For Mexico, free trade was seen as—and has proven to be—economically devastating: Some two million Mexican farmers have lost their land in the age of NAFTA. Indigenous workers, like those in the southernmost state of Chiapas who faced the importation of corporate American agribusiness, predicted correctly that “free trade” would decimate their heritage and livelihood. And so on January 1st, 1994—the day NAFTA went into effect—hundreds of men, women, and children emerged from the Lacandon jungle and the canyons of Chiapas as a guerilla army and demanded autonomy from the Mexican government. Marking 500 years of genocide against indigenous peoples by colonial rule, the workers wanted control of their Mayan land and their food; they wanted democracy, peace, and justice on their own terms. They called themselves the Zapatistas (the armed faction is known as the Zapatista National Liberation Army, or EZLN) and carried a flag bearing a single red star centered against a black background—the same insignia that peppers Rage iconography and stage shows. The Zapatistas’ bandoliers and rifles (some real, many fake) were a theatrical show of military might, but their real power lay in their philosophy, called Zapatismo, and the writings and speeches of the group’s de facto leader, Subcomandante Marcos. Quixotic, pseudonymous, and filmed wearing a balaclava smoking a pipe, Marcos spoke in winding allegory and professorial verse about the revolution of the Zapatistas. The Zapatista revolution was not for them, but for the greater world. “Para todos todo, para nosotros nada,” goes the most famous Zapatismo maxim, “For everyone everything, for us nothing.” As Alex Khasnabish, a professor and researcher of radical collectives, explained in one of Rage’s unauthorized biographies, Know Your Enemy, the cornerstone of Zapatismo is this: “Rather than insisting that you support [the Zapatistas], they want you to struggle in your own way, in your own place, with your own commitment to dignity in a revolution that makes sense to you and the people around you.” The grandiloquent ideas of the Zapatistas and Subcomandante Marcos took on the hue of surrealism and romance, a way of sounding a revolution through the tones and rhythms of language. At heart, the music of Rage Against the Machine is a direct extension of Zapatismo: paradoxical, militaristic, generous, a conduit for power, not a concentration of it. De la Rocha visited Chiapas four times between 1995 and 1996, working closely with the Zapatistas and strengthening his connection to his Mexican heritage (his Sinaloan grandfather fought in the Mexican Revolution). These trips helped shape the idea of revolutionary bridge-building, of connecting the struggle of one to the many. “I think every revolutionary act is an act of love,” de la Rocha told Rolling Stone in 1999. “Every song that I’ve written, it is because of my desire to use music as a way to empower and re-humanize people who are living in a dehumanizing setting.” On its surface, it was easy to classify Rage as music for teenagers staging a leafy suburban rebellion against their parents or doing curls in the squat rack. But by The Battle of Los Angeles, Rage had ascended to something far more personal, spiritual, and bohemian. If 1996’s Evil Empire came with a leftist library starter pack, Battle came with a politics of emotion, music that was nimble and serious. In her book Hope in the Dark, the writer and activist Rebecca Solnit describes the words of Subcomandante Marcos as “the language of the vast, nameless, current movement that globalization has drawn together, a movement...driven by imaginations as supple as art rather than as stiff as dogma.” It is from this delicate branch of politics that Zack de la Rocha’s words were formed. In 1999, however, the context in which most people engaged with The Battle of Los Angeles was not through the insurrectionary poetry of Subcomandante Marcos or a readily accessible anti-globalization platform. The album was released in the last gasp of the monoculture, dropped into the scum pond of rock’s commercial nadir. Korn led the nu-metal charge on radio, while Limp Bizkit and Kid Rock were rap-rocking without cause on TRL. There were only a few American anti-war protests against Clinton bombing a pharmaceutical factory in Sudan or the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia (in the press throughout the late-’90s, Morello would often parry a journalist’s question about, say, the violence at Woodstock ’99 with an indictment of Clinton’s warmongering, like his “Tomahawk missile [that] destroyed the children’s hospital outside Belgrade”). There were no wars predicated on a lie about weapons of mass destruction, no social media to disseminate revolutionary tweets to the masses, just pockets of left-wing activism fighting against the WTO in Seattle and the IMF in D.C. as Creed’s Human Clay sat atop the charts. The benefit of Rage reentering the mainstream during this odd musical and socio-political dead zone was that they sounded both nostalgic and of the moment. They had cleared the way for nu-metal and rap-rock with their first two albums, 1992’s groundbreaking self-titled debut and 1996’s angsty and downtrodden Evil Empire, both of which eventually went triple platinum. When they swung back in with The Battle of Los Angeles, it was like a reminder of the prophecy they foretold at the beginning of the decade. Once iconoclastic rap-rock alchemists, Rage now sounded pretty much like what was on the radio. Moreover, they sounded like the same band they always were but more lethal, more agile, able to fully disarm with a verse and a hook. “What I did a lot on [Evil Empire] was, ‘This is what I think. This is my comment,’” de la Rocha told Rolling Stone. “I’ve had to change. I want people to see reflections of themselves in the songs.” His personal accountability fit squarely with the Zapatista ethos of wanting people to create a revolution in their own way, now bolstered with songs that moved quicker, had bigger hooks, and carried more weight than anything Rage had ever written. It took nearly a year for de la Rocha to complete all the vocals on Battle, during which he gravitated to another plane of rapping. He is exacting and dynamic, the generalissimo’s preacher. On “Calm Like a Bomb,” he loops himself around the band in long ribbons of verse: “I be walkin’ God like a dog/My narrative fearless/My word war returns to burn like Baldwin home from Paris.” Then on the pre-chorus, as the band lurches into their signature mosh-rock cadence, de la Rocha hugs the turn on two wheels to deliver this slinky triplet: “What ya say, what ya say, what ya say, what!” When the chorus hits, it does exactly what he says: “Ignite!” The chameleonic ease with which de la Rocha slides between rap, funk, and rock on “Calm Like a Bomb” is indicative of the band’s full symbiosis of all those genres on Battle; a chemical compound perfected, a longshot theory finally proved. With Brad Wilk on the drums and Tim Commerford on the bass, Rage cut deep into the groove. The verse of “Sleep Now in the Fire” is the rhythm section at its best: the feel has that crab-creep shuffle with Wilk and Commerford laying down an “Amen break” while Morello makes his guitar sound like a British dial tone. The formula of Rage’s rhythm section can be largely predictable—hushed intro, blues riffs, experimental sound-bed under the verse, more blues riffs, wacky guitar solo, breakdown with blues riffs—but there’s just enough variety and mobility to let de la Rocha be the star. He’ll blow a word out of his mouth in a huff with big pockets of air in his cheeks, or he’ll wrap his throat around a word like a snake, sucking the air out of it. The space he leaves between the names of Columbus’ ships, the trilled “r” on “Maria,” the oddly swung rhythm of a line dripping with sarcasm—“So raise your fist and march around just don’t take what you need”—sometimes there are more ideas in the rhythm of his raps than the raps themselves. When the band was on tour with Gang Starr, DJ Premier told Spin that he’d try to get a remix of a new Rage song onto rap radio, but that it might not be as easy as it was with Fred Durst. “Zack is trying to penetrate the whole soul… he’s speaking the real, and that takes longer to sink in.” One of the band’s longest-running causes célèbres was the fight for the freedom of Black Panther and radio journalist Mumia Abu-Jamal—who, it is widely believed, was unfairly convicted of killing a Philadelphia police officer in 1981. “Long as the rope is tight around Mumia’s neck/Let there be no rich white life we bound to respect,” de la Rocha stage-whispers on “Voice of the Voiceless,” a short ode to Mumia’s struggle. While the phrase “Free Mumia” became something of an activist meme in the ’90s, Rage never took his sham trial or his then-impending death sentence for granted (Mumia’s execution case was dropped in 2011 and he is now serving life without parole). In January 1999, Rage threw an infamous benefit concert in New Jersey that raised $80,000 for Mumia and sparked a media war between a right-wing cop union and the band. And in April of the same year, de la Rocha flew to Geneva, Switzerland to speak on Mumia’s behalf at the International Commission of Human Rights. Each song on Battle comes from an outgrowth of personal political conviction. Rage weren’t fretting from afar and hoping for change like Live Aid; de la Rocha was writing about the abject horror of immigrant sweatshop labor on “Maria” after Morello was arrested demonstrating against sweatshops in Santa Monica in 1997. De la Rocha wrote of the wealth inequality he saw in his hometown of L.A. (“Born as Ghosts”) and a final salvo about the Zapatistas’ struggle on “War Within a Breath,” the last in a series of songs about the Zapatistas stretching back to Evil Empire. Hidden in that track is a brief line that could be the album’s subheadline: “It’s a war from the depth of time.” Perhaps most striking is “Born of a Broken Man,” a slow dirge cut from the cloth of Black Sabbath about de la Rocha’s father, the artist and muralist Beto de la Rocha. Beto was a member of the landmark Chicano painting collective Los Four; in 1974, he was one of the first Chicano artists to be exhibited at the L.A. County Museum of Art. After suffering a nervous breakdown in 1981, Beto fell into a destructive spiral of religious fanaticism. He would fast for weekends, sometimes making a young Zack fast beside him. One night, in a fit of anger and guilt, Beto destroyed over half of his paintings in front of his son. “Born of a broken man, but not a broken man,” Zack screams of complicated pride on the hook. The anomaly of “Born of a Broken Man,” the only Rage song that ever pulled directly from de la Rocha’s personal life, lends emotional credence to the political screeds around it—“harangue’n’roll” as Rolling Stone once derisively tagged the band. Few bands have been given more purity tests than Rage Against the Machine over the years, but the question inevitably arises with any group that stakes their identity on revolutionary thought and leftist causes: Do you buy it? You know these avowed socialists are signed to Epic, a multinational major label, right? They made millions of dollars from record sales, and Battle debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard charts, just as Evil Empire did in 1996. Are they redistributing their wealth? When de la Rocha left the band in October of 2000, he hinted at his own discomfort, saying that the group’s decision-making process had “undermined our artistic and political ideal.” How do you square the band’s leftist ideology with the defanged arena rock of Audioslave in the ensuing years? Perhaps the biggest hurdle for buying into Rage Against the Machine is simply their name. All these years later, it has curdled into something sophomoric, trite, somehow too specific and too vague at the same time. If it is an albatross around the band’s neck, it’s created a tautology that has forced them to stay true to themselves: The immutable law of a Rage Against the Machine album is that it must, by nature, rage against the machine. And so inherent in their silly band name lies the uncynical, righteous, and repetitious work of activism and fighting for justice, the search for the will to continue even when it seems like the battle is lost. “I’m not buying this bullshit line that says the situation in Chiapas or with Mumia or with the garment workers somehow has nothing to do with middle-class white kids at our shows,” de la Rocha told Spin in 2000. “All this alienation has roots; it’s not just TV or boredom or bad parents.” This was the great ambition of The Battle of Los Angeles, and perhaps Rage itself: to draw a line between their millions of Gen X and Millennial fans and the causes they fought for, from conquistadors to Clinton, from the Intifada to the Zapatistas, from Francis Fukuyama’s claim that the end of the Cold War was the “end of history” to the spark of the anti-globalization movement around the world. Battle revealed the extent—chronologically and geographically—to which none of us live with dignity. They showed us this is a war we can’t win but it’s a war we don’t deserve to lose.

Everlasting,Loyal Lobos,by: Jenzia Burgos,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f2856283cae5e8e7ff0d863/1:1/w_160/Everlasting_Loyal%20Lobos.jpg,2020-08-08 05:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/loyal-lobos-everlasting/,AWAL,"Andrea Silva used to sing at funerals. Something about that bittersweet spectacle—as both a celebration of life and a gathering of grief—has never quite left her music. But that was years ago, when Silva was still a child growing up in Bogotá, Colombia, long before she moved to Los Angeles to escape the slut-shaming she endured in high school. Now, she makes music under the alias Loyal Lobos. She’s traded funeral hymns for synth-pop arrangements. And she’s found a way to marry the tough blow of a life left behind with the freedom that starting over allows. On Everlasting, this freedom isn’t wasted. Silva refuses to fit into the sometimes narrow mold of singer-songwriters in the U.S., where a handful of women dominate a scene Silva once called, aptly, “very American and very white.” She tinkered with their sparse folk-rock on her 2018 EP The Fall before abandoning the limits of that genre for something else entirely: an ambitious, bilingual record that hops between influences, echoing the liminal state that comes with being a 26-year-old immigrant in America. Everlasting slips into this uncertain space and manages to thrive not in spite of it, but because of it. Doing so meant letting go of some of Americana’s starry-eyed trappings. Some can still be heard on the album’s first single, “Criminals,” which balances the sad nostalgia of a time before meeting your platonic half with the addictive promise of their newfound love. When Silva’s voice swarms to the heavens, singing, “I’d kill for you,” it invokes a teenaged lust to evade the world’s rules together, her fingerpicked riff scoring the getaway. But on the rest of Everlasting, it sounds like Silva’s done running away from reality. Nearly a year after the longing “Criminals” was released, she’s leaning into herself more and opting for fun as an antidote to trauma. It’s a new kind of safeguard, heard in the whimsy of the album’s percussive pop elements—a surprise that only begins to make sense upon hearing that Silva landed Shawn Mendes’ hitmaker, Teddy Geiger, as her executive producer. Traces of Silva’s upbringing in Colombia often illuminate these playful moments. Grand telenovela soundtracks, the dreamy haze of the countryside, and the machista culture that drove her away in the first place are all hinted at in experiments in shoegaze and reggaeton-reminiscent rhythms. It takes frisky songs like “Si Te Portas Mal (Be Bad)” and the Auto-Tuned “Papel” to break up the haze of Silva’s double-tracked vocals—a sonic shift that also seems to give way to more pointed language in her mother tongue. On “Si Te Portas Mal (Be Bad),” Silva reminds the guys that she’s a “perra, pero el alma baby/Entera,” or a slut whose soul is whole. This makes the lawless, cinematic slant of 2019’s “Criminals” feel schmaltzy in comparison. That isn’t to say that the simpler balladry on Everlasting is without substance. When Silva quips on the record’s title track, “The stars are now aligned/L.A. people seem to care/Never got to see them/City lights over shine outer space,” you get a sense of a place back home where people can actually see the stars instead of just imagining them. Yet this nimble songwriting is sometimes obscured—and not only purposefully, like it is by the sizzling feedback on “Whatever It Is” or the taffeta reverb of “You Were Bored.” Silva’s words have a tendency to coast loosely into each other, blurring entire sentences into one breathless slip. Hers is nothing like the crisp deadpan we get from L.A.’s Phoebe Bridgers, who Silva often gets compared to. That difference isn’t without its redeeming qualities, however. There is something powerful in this remnant of where she came from—an insular delivery in which the Spanish-language lilt of her motherland always makes itself known.

This Devastating Map,Helvetia,by: Brian Coney,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f285f428212971f16f6f7b5/1:1/w_160/This%20Devastating%20Map_Helvetia.jpg,2020-08-08 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/helvetia-this-devastating-map/,Joyful Noise,"As one-third of San Jose slowcore icons Duster—and bassist for Built to Spill from 2012 until 2019—Jason Albertini is well-versed in indie rock that peers inwards to find a way out. As the core member of Helvetia, a project that he has helmed since 2005, his pining lo-fi multi-instrumentalism delves deeper still. Alongside a rotating cast including Built to Spill alumni Scott Plouf and Jim Roth, records like 2007’s The Acrobats and 2015’s Dromomania packed in sleepyheaded guitar-pop that Albertini awakens on his tenth full-length, This Devastating Map. When Duster returned in 2019 after almost 20 years away, Albertini, Clay Parton, and Canaan Dove Amber were both seasoned industry vets and somewhat anonymous. Recorded in Albertini’s Portland home last summer, This Devastating Map shirks the urge to recede any further, and feels more substantial than the wiry 4-track musings of Fantastic Life, released in January. After years spent reflecting just slightly beneath the surface, its candor feels like a chance for Albertini to come up for air. Still, there’s a sunken, almost submerged quality to many of these songs—the kind of thrifty reverb glow and soft-focus hiss that makes Albertini’s studio seem to be situated not just in his basement but far below it. Stretching this quality to its outer reaches, Albertini—backed by ex-Built to Spill drummer Steve Gere and Tiburones’ Samantha Stidham on bass—fills out a sphere of sound. Fizzling melodies nestle in the furthest reaches of each channel on opener “Devastating Map,” sounding like North Carolina indie rockers Polvo on Ambien. On “Inverted,” Alex G-esque guitar shapes and tumbling drums sound like they’re climbing over each other, clamoring to be heard. Insofar as it can be parsed, Albertini’s loose, candid lyricism has always seemed to center on first thought, best thought. Which is why, even 10 full-length LPs in, there’s still room for shortcomings and sore points. “Love Me” cuts to the chase right away: “Love me and I’ll do anything for you,” Albertini pleads. Sedate, at times foreboding tonal shifts take center stage here and on “Echo Location,” where a slow, unsteady crawl finds its feet across four minutes. In a statement accompanying the song’s video, Albertini offers some curt but telling context: “[It was] the first song I recorded after rehab. A march to the sea where I accidentally end up at some cliffs and call the whole thing off.” Sketching a giddy scene of “clean living,” sun-split lead single “Reaktor” underscores the prevailing sense of returning from the brink to hard-won domesticity. Reeled off above scorched wah-wah leads reminiscent of Doug Martsch, dishwashing and taking one’s daughter to the dentist sound akin to bliss. If the self-described “desperate, purring distress” of Duster’s paeans to summer days spent inside your head felt uniquely slo-mo, This Devastating Map almost comes to a grinding halt. But like meteors in the night sky, even the briefest songs leave lasting impressions. Maybe it’s that the stakes seem so low, or that the songs demand so little, but the way Albertini teases out quiet, spindly majesty from dread feels vital. As “Long Beach” tails off with a parting minor-key bob evoking fellow Portlanders Quasi, Helvetia’s inward-peering mystique is at all-time low, and Albertini’s growing willingness to be seen looks all the more compelling.

Microphones in 2020,The Microphones,by: Quinn Moreland,Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f284eb719fdf81aa4467942/1:1/w_160/Microphones%20In%202020_The%20Microphones.jpg,2020-08-07 05:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/the-microphones-microphones-in-2020/,P.W. Elverum & Sun,"Before he borrowed the name of the mountain that looms over his hometown of Anacortes, Washington, Phil Elverum wrote and performed songs as the Microphones, named in tribute to his recording equipment, which seemed to breathe and swell with a life of its own. In the summer of 2019, 16 years after the project’s last proper release, Elverum exhumed this moniker for a show filled with old friends. As he writes now, the performance—and the internet’s subsequent elation—raised some existential quandaries about past identities and “self-commemoration.” Over the course of a year, Elverum coalesced these thoughts into Microphones in 2020, a 45-minute song about many things, including artmaking, self-mythologizing, and what it means to bear witness to one’s own existence and transformations. Elverum’s art has always tackled complex trains of thought. The Microphones’ music tended to do so on a cosmic scale, gazing out at the natural world for meaning. Elverum veered away from these wide-eyed tendencies following the death of his wife, the multi-disciplinary artist Geneviève Castrée, in 2016. “Conceptual emptiness was cool to talk about/Back before I knew my way around these hospitals” he sang on the album recorded very soon after. Since then, his solo work under the Mount Eerie moniker has been rooted in plainspoken specificity. But as Elverum has made clear over the years, the titles that separate his projects are irrelevant because the questions he pursues have remained the same. “...Every song I’ve ever sung is about the same thing: standing on the ground looking around, basically,” he sings here. “If there have to be words, they could just be/‘now only’ and ‘there’s no end.’” Though Microphones in 2020 looks back at a specific moment when Elverum was finding his footing as a young musician, it carries the weight of every experience he’s had since. The skeletal two-chord melody that carries the song evokes his stark compositions of recent years but is punctuated by bursts of analog noise, calling back to earlier experimentations. (The strumming itself echoes the opening of 2000’s It Was Hot, We Stayed in the Water.) He channels the wonder of his youth as if no time has passed, exalting the sublimity of waterfalls, rainstorms, and crashing waves. “We’d go up on the roof at night and actually contemplate the moon,” he murmurs, in quiet awe at the purity of these practices. “My friends and I trying to blow each others’ minds just lying there gazing, young and ridiculous and we meant it, our eyes watering.” His voice is steady, his gaze unflinching. He is kind to this version of himself, the soft kid who saw meaning and metaphor in everything. Elverum imbues these memories of constant experimentation with undeniable romance. “When you’re younger every single thing vibrates with significance,” he sings. “Gazing at the details in the artwork of a 7"", devouring every word in a zine, there was barely internet/Meaning gets attributed wherever appetite bestows a thing with resonating glowing ringing out through a life.” (To that end, a significant and delightful chunk of the song is dedicated to a revelatory screening of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon at a dollar theater in Aberdeen.) But even as he sprinkles references to the work that would blossom from these rushes of inspiration, Elverum never falls prey to the wistfulness that so often accompanies nostalgia. “The beast of uninvited change,” as he calls it, always makes itself known no matter how much we will it away. The line Elverum traces through his life is not a linear one. His thoughts skip around in time and space, from the big picture to minute detail, tethered only by the hypnotic guitar melody, but sometimes that, too, slips away. New textures arise, occasionally drowning everything else out: distorted basslines, cavernous drums, amp hiss, harmonious overdubs, and glimmers of fuzzy tape deck ghosts. At one point, after Elverum dives down into the center of a lake, everything dissolves into a dazzling, mysterious shimmer fully embodying the beauty of an earlier line: “Extravagant solitude invigorates.” Then, the double-tracked chords return and the song rumbles back to life: nothing stays the same. Near the end of Microphones in 2020, Elverum recalls running into the touring outfit of Bonnie “Prince” Billy in a parking lot in Italy. The band, he casually notes, was wearing matching tracksuits, “a kind of Italian tour costume.” It’s a delightful, mundane image, the sort of observation that other songwriters might find superfluous, but one that—like noting the exact date of that Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon showing—does the heavy lifting of making an already detailed world even more vivid. The memory of this encounter kicks off a line of inquiry that doubles as the song’s coda: What is the root of this lifelong pursuit of creativity? Why is Elverum driven to make “wild swipes at meaning”? His tendency to play with words and poke around for significance started in childhood, Elverum explains here. But was it nature or nurture that has led him to “blur the boundary between myself and the actual churning dirt of this place, that it feels normal to me to speak with the voice of weather”? He touches on the bizarre power and privilege of being an artist, especially one with a platform. “When I took my shirt off in the yard I meant it, and it’s still off,” Elverum declares in the song’s closing minutes. Elverum devotees will recognize this as a direct allusion to the title track of the Microphones’ most beloved record, 2001’s The Glow Pt. 2. But it’s what comes next that transcends any familiarity with Elverum’s catalog: “I’m still standing in the weather looking for meaning in the giant meaningless days of love and loss repeatedly waterfalling down and the sun relentlessly rises still.” “Meaning” and “meaningless”: these words appear again and again across Microphones in 2020 and Elverum’s discography at large. There are no easy answers in life; some questions will always remain unresolved. But there is a great and terrible beauty in this universal, timeless uncertainty.

Jaguar,Victoria Monét,by: Dani Blum ,Contributor ,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f1f41e01372d03553804992/1:1/w_160/jaguar_victoria%20monet.jpg,2020-08-07 05:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/victoria-monet-jaguar/,Tribe,"Victoria Monét was already in the studio when Ariana Grande meandered in, clutching Tiffany’s bags, tipsy from champagne served at the store. The story behind how they wrote “7 rings,” along with a slew of collaborators, is baked into the song—relishing their new matching jewelry, a huddle of Grande’s friends turned their conspicuous consumption into an “empowering” chant: “I want it/ I got it.” Monét  met Grande two years before the pop star’s first album dropped, and since then she has been a force behind mega-pop hits: Fifth Harmony’s “Work From Home,” Grande’s quiet, hopeful, “thank u, next,” and Chloe x Halle’s incandescent earworm “Do It.” But after “7 Rings” became such a hit, Monét  told The Fader last year, she took time off from making songs for other people and focused strictly on her own music for the first time. The resulting project, Jaguar, is a sleek cocoon of funk-tinged R&B that excavates what it means to be in control. “I’m just living on instinct,” she croons on the title track, as glossy disco beats skitter and pulse. “What it be like dealing with a queen?” she breathes on interlude “Big Boss,” before launching into a gooey, glimmering harmony. Monét has said she aims to write about sex the way men do. Though she succeeds, the results are sometimes  unfortunate. The simmering ballad “Ass Like That” focuses entirely on her butt: She details her squat routine, burns her calories “like weed,” and insists she doesn’t edit her photos. It’s a catchy song that oscillates between charming and clumsy. “Dive” undulates over the sound effect of a creaking bed with shrieks and moans layered over the swoop of her voice in the chorus. “Life is but a dream, here we are inside of it/ and you’re inside of me,” she coos over swelling violins on “Moment.”  From the velvet of her voice over sweeping strings to the slinky rush of electro beats, it’s the shimmer in these songs that keeps them compelling. That propulsive sheen reaches a crescendo on “Experience,” the latest in a series of sparkling electro-funk singles announcing a new female pop power. Normani took a whirl with this, matching Sam Smith on “Dancing With a Stranger,” just before “Motivation” catapulted her to a new level of stardom; two years before she released her studio debut album, Jessie Reyez smirked (also beside Sam Smith) on the on the Calvin Harris-produced “Promises.” Dua Lipa, maybe the most prominent figure of the recent pop-funk resurgence, had her juddering single “Electricity,” a Mark Ronson-Diplo collab. Monét’s voice swirls around S.G. Lewis’ disco drums and gauzy synths on “Experience,” and Khalid shows up for a palatable, anonymous-sounding feature.  Monét makes the song a celebration, listing her hopes for a breakup’s aftermath to bleating trumpets that eventually fade in the background.  Like the rest of the project, the track functions as both a triumph and a declaration: Victoria Monét is claiming the spotlight, dazzling and dancing all the way.

Duma,Duma,by: Mehan Jayasuriya,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f297797f74a4bbe0d09832c/1:1/w_160/duma_duma.jpg,2020-08-07 05:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/duma-duma/,Nyege Nyege Tapes,"The duo of Martin Khanja and Sam Karugu make music that’s manic, heavy, and impossible to categorize. It’s electronic and caustic, though it can also feel pensive. Machine-gun drums and piercing shrieks form the foundation of most songs; there are occasionally little ribbons of melody to cling to, but more often than not, static, synth drones and sculpted feedback provide the only adornment. This is music that comes apart at the seams, that glitches and convulses, that revels in the sounds of people and machines stretched to their breaking points. Both Khanja and Karugu are veterans of Nairobi’s thriving metal scene. Khanja’s previous band, Lust of a Dying Breed, pushed speed metal into industrial territory: their final release traded in blast beats for the jittery sound of programmed drums. Duma goes even further, dispensing with any allegiance to genre, though the band draws liberally from black metal, power electronics, grindcore, drone and even hip-hop. As a composer, Karugu is an agent of chaos: these songs are crammed full of pummeling bass hits, stacked polyrhythms and other violently rhythmic sounds—it’s easy to picture an Ableton grid crowded with overlapping drum tracks. He sometimes employs recordings of hand drums as well, though even these are usually played at inhuman tempos. Khanja, meanwhile, can howl like a black metal vocalist, bark like a metalcore singer, or even yelp with a kind of frenzied glee. His throat-shredding vocals are often the only constant in these songs as tempos shift, tracks drop in and out of the mix, and waves of noise advance and recede. With a few exceptions, Duma has two distinct halves: the most frantic songs are front loaded while the songs on the back half are more meditative, though just as unflinchingly dark. In practice, this can feel a bit like putting on a soothing face mask after an exfoliating scrub. “Omni” opens with a skipping pulse that feels like it could induce tachycardia, eventually settles into a trap beat and then plunges back into discord—it sounds a bit like a corrupted MP3 of a TNGHT song. Lead single “Lionsblood'' buries black metal vocals under an assault of manic hand drums, while “Uganda With Sam” sounds like minimalist electronic music overlaid with hardcore growls. There are spookily atmospheric songs as well. “Pembe 666” marries mechanical-sounding drones to a spoken word piece, a reading of Revelation 5:6 in Kiswahili. It sounds every bit as haunting as the verse it quotes (“...[A]nd in the midst of the elders, stood a lamb as it had been slain, having seven horns and seven eyes”). While it's hard to point to any one act that Duma sound like, their music does have some analogues. The breakneck polyrhythms of Tanzanian singeli music (as heard on their label,  Nyege Nyege Tapes’ releases of artists affiliated with Sisso Studios) aim for a similar sonic overload. And in ethos and ambition, Duma seem to draw from some of the most iconoclastic acts from the past decade of extreme music: they are elementally similar to early Fuck Buttons and as willing to fail the black metal purity test as Deafheaven and Liturgy. But where all of those bands aim for some kind of transcendence, Duma is content to frolic in the ugliness found here on earth. The textures they employ on Duma evoke overloaded circuits, corroded machinery, and heavy metals leaking into groundwater. This is the sound of human dread and misery, soundtracked by devices destined for the trash heap. Few records released this year better capture both the chaos and anxiety of our current moment.

Heart’s Ease,Shirley Collins,by: Allison Hussey,"Associate Staff Writer, News",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f284518a262471b02c252c0/1:1/w_160/Heart%E2%80%99s%20Ease_Shirley%20Collins.jpg,2020-08-07 05:00:00,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/shirley-collins-hearts-ease/,Domino,"Shirley Collins celebrated her 85th birthday on July 5, and even during the COVID-19 pandemic, her neighbors unrolled a polite but lively celebration of their local heroine. Circled by onlookers, an accordionist, and Morris dancers outfitted in bells and traditional garb, Collins sat in a shaded doorway, applauding the scene with enthusiasm. It was a fitting tribute to a woman who has dedicated her life to preserving English folk culture. This convivial spirit reverberates across Collins’ new record, Heart’s Ease, her second after a break from music that lasted for nearly 40 years. Her absence was marked by the heartbreak of infidelity, but after reclaiming confidence in her voice, she returned in 2016 with Lodestar. On Heart’s Ease, Collins is spry as ever, leading a light-footed exploration of English folk traditions that also tilts toward classic psychedelia. Heart’s Ease is soft but crisp, like freshly laundered sheets stretched along a line. Collins sounds at ease across the album, a typical hodge-podge of English folk styles: a traditional favorite (“Barbara Allen”), a working song (“Canadee-I-O”), a cheery dance number (“Orange in Bloom”). But Collins’ liner notes shape an autobiographical arc. She sang a version of “Rolling in the Dew” as a schoolgirl, and she learned opener “Merry Golden Tree” from Almeda Riddle while assisting Alan Lomax on his field-recording trip through the American South in 1959 and 1960. She adapted “Whitsun Dance” from a poem by record producer Austin John Marshall, inspired by his empathy for the elderly widows who gathered to dance at the Cecil Sharp House, the English folk music preservation organization where she often performed. In using Heart’s Ease to transmit other semi-forgotten bits of history, Collins covertly tells her own. Heart’s Ease is beautifully rendered, presenting Collins’ voice in reverent focus amid acoustic guitars, mandolin, and the occasional fiddle. “Sweet Greens and Blues,” an exemplary number about savoring a quiet and happy life, gets a playful lift from a touch of slide guitar in the background. Picking in his typical rolling style, guest guitarist Nathan Salsburg adds another sylvan layer. Collins sings the frosty “Locked in Ice” with such somber clarity as to make the song sound autobiographical. The tune’s backing drifts of whispery cymbals and spacey electric guitar recall the haze of old memories, giving the song a slight psychedelic wriggle. Britfolk aficionados have enthusiastically embraced Collins’ return to the public field, and the relaxed warmth carried over from Lodestar to Heart’s Ease affirms that she’s glad to be here. Having spent her life preserving the who-when-why of songs from history’s further reaches, she uses Heart’s Ease to apply that scrutinizing lens to herself. The impression she leaves is rich: Collins waits until the end of the album to stretch out with “Crowlink,” inspired by her own seaside ruminations. The piece recalls the woolier corners of 1971’s No Roses, her marvelous psych-rock foray with the Albion Country Band (an outfit that included her former husband). Her voice emerges amid the sounds of seabirds, crashing surf, and hurdy-gurdy and harmonium drone, winking at a sense of adventure undiminished by advanced years.

Such Pretty Forks in the Road,Alanis Morissette,by: Katherine St. Asaph,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f2825a51372d03553804d6a/1:1/w_160/Such%20Pretty%20Forks%20in%20the%20Road_alanis%20morissette.jpg,2020-08-06 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/alanis-morissette-such-pretty-forks-in-the-road/,EpiphanyThirty Tigers,"It’s fair to say that Alanis Morissette, a once omnipresent cultural icon, has slowly receded from view. As seemingly every millisecond of the ’90s has been reassessed and re-released and homaged, the musician whose 1995 album Jagged Little Pill was once the biggest album in the world (and by long-term sales, is still massive) and who became a template for the next several years of outspoken female pop-rockers, has long been under what one writer called “the curse of the CD binder.” Part of it’s that her back catalog has either aged horribly (just imagine the respose to “Thank U”) or aged surprisingly well: Jagged Little Pill, obviously, but also “Hands Clean” from 2002’s Under Rug Swept—a song that dissects a sexual predator’s grooming with medical precision and corpse-grinning horror—and 2008’s Flavors of Entanglement, which matches late-’00s electropop at its game before the game even fully started. The other part of it is that, you-know-which song aside, she’s a zero-irony artist in an irony-poisoned world. The title of Such Pretty Forks in the Road is illustrative; if mainstream pop took one fork, Alanis continued down her orthogonal path, and soon it became entirely her own. Jagged Little Pill was credited as much to megaproducer Glen Ballard as to her, but if it wasn’t clear by the 2000s that she was a creative force, it’s clear here. She’s working with Troye Sivan and Selena Gomez’s producer, making a kind of music with more and more revivalists, and she still sounds like nobody else. More so than on previous albums, Morrissette dips into less poppy singer-songwriter tricks. “Ablaze” and “Sandbox Love” are like lost, exuberant ’90s VH1 hits: rides on an abandoned pop-rock roller coaster. The dissonant piano that encircles “Reckoning” is all the more effective for no longer being cliché. Lead single “Reasons I Drink” is built atop a jaunty cabaret piano line  and that sets up a huge chorus only to let it trail off before the payoff, too fallible for the façade; it’s like a tipsy, half-remembered karaoke version of Heart’s “Alone.” Among her reasons to drink are her hyper-productivity and the “sick industry,” which are even more relevant than when Morrissette was (her words) in “single digits.” And yet there’s something ineffably two-decades-ago about lines like “That’s it, I am buying a Lamborghini to make up for these” or, later on the album, “I am grieving the end of super-womaning.” Not that that’s bad, entirely. By Morissette’s standards, Pretty Forks is a vulnerable, sedate, ballad-heavy album. Most of those ballads are unobtrusive, with songwriting-template piano and strings plush and regular as amphitheater seats. But a piano ballad by Alanis is still an Alanis song, and thus it just won’t sound like the rest, not with music’s most chaotic-neutral pop lyricist. Whether she actually writes like this, her songs sure sound first-thought-best-thought, no workshopping and no curation, let the syllables fall where they may. And for this, she’s taken two and a half decades of shit. But there’s a method to the badness. For every awkward meter or future mondegreen, Alanis produces a lyric that’s charmingly handspun. “Ablaze,” written for her children, could easily be unbearably saccharine if it were just a dedication; instead, it’s specifically, wildly hers. When the songs are funny, she’s often in on the joke, like on the bleak, quavery “Diagnosis,” a dispatch from the world where you really just can’t: “I can’t remember where the sentence started when I’m trying to finish it.” If Morrissette writes mostly in epigraphs, the ones on “Pedestal” recall nothing less than Rita Hayworth (who famously said, of her titular role in the film noir classic Gilda, “Men go to bed with Gilda but wake up with me.”) Morissette’s version, “One day I won’t be craved the way you crave me now,” is more awkward but also more disarming; with a slight personal tweak, she turns the song from fear of abandonment to fear of the world’s abandonment. She knows what she’s doing. These U-turns of phrase are well within bounds of what you expect from an Alanis Morissette album. But her music still has surprises, and she saves the most rewarding one for the end. “Nemesis,” like much of Pretty Forks, begins midtempo and pro forma. But across six minutes, it snowballs into something large, picking up element after element. Trance chimes, galloping “Running Up That Hill”-drums, buttinsky electric guitar and cellos coalesce into what sure sounds like an Alanis banger in 2020. Ironically, the song itself is about hating change—you don’t need an homage to ’90s Alanis when she’s still finding new ways to do “Alanis” herself.

Impenetrable Cerebral Fortress,Gulch,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f2842bba86e2d543d94171d/1:1/w_160/Impenetrable%20Cerebral%20Fortress_Gulch.jpg,2020-08-06 05:00:00,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/gulch-impenetrable-cerebral-fortress/,Closed Casket Activities,"Gulch have reached a rarefied status in hardcore where outsiders who haven’t heard their music still might have heard things about them—frontman Elliott Morrow’s demonic intensity, or maybe the group’s now-legendary This is Hardcore 2019 set, in which they imported the gleeful, cartoonish physicality of the Santa Cruz scene to a roomful of burly East Coast punks. The band’s merch is notorious, too: their logo adorns Sanrio-themed hoodies and rugby sweaters that usually sell out within hours and fetch over $500 a pop on resale sites. None of this necessarily makes Gulch unique within hardcore, where even the best albums risk redundancy next to to the live experience. But there is no live experience of any kind right now; Impenetrable Cerebral Fortress is all Gulch have to sustain their hype in 2020, and they invest themselves in their debut like the quarantine could last the rest of their lives. Impenetrable Cerebral Fortress isn’t meant to replicate the grim, grubby spaces where Gulch might have been playing in a simpler time. Jack Shirley’s always-sharp production removes the murk that suffused 2019 Promo (two tracks of which show up here) and allows the band’s ugly, ugly vision for hardcore to come into relief. Even if there are no pits to open the fuck up for the foreseeable future, Gulch still acknowledge the value of showmanship and scarcity—they dropped Impenetrable Cerebral Fortress with mere days of advance notice on July 24 and unintentionally provided entertaining contrast for people who find space for hardcore and folklore. For all of their fans’ superlatives like “unhinged” or “chaotic,” Gulch are very much intentional about how they present themselves: as with 2018’s Burning Desire to Draw Last Breath, Boone Naka’s strikingly beautiful and bloody art graces the cover. On first exposure, Impenetrable Cerebral Fortress is 15 minutes of flailing limbs and demonic howls held together by centrifugal force, intended to be confirmed by two or three-word assessments of its intensity. The group is equally adept with the pure speed-freak flash of the ultra-technical Botch and Dillinger Escape Plan, the sheer ugliness of Emperor or Rotten Sound, and the antisocial populism of any given Sound and Fury headliner. Not much is intelligible, save for self-explanatory title shouts of “Lie, Deny, Sanctify” and “Cries of Pleasure, Heavenly Pain,” whose theme is more literally explored in “Fucking Towards Salvation.” Subsequent listens reveal actual nuance and craft, words that might imply an egghead’s vision of hardcore. But even though the word “cerebral” is in the title, all such activity here is in service of intimidation and dominance. The brevity of Impenetrable Cerebral Fortress may honor hardcore’s structural rules, as Gulch understand 15 minutes is about as long as anyone should last making a scrunched face. It’s also a decision that gives specific meaning to every single blow to the skull. Gulch elevate traditional hardcore signifiers into killer hooks—on the title track, they pitch and stereo-pan feedback into a conversational melody, underscoring Morrow’s best impersonation of an overdriven amp. They throw an evil tritone over the brief militaristic pomp of “Cries of Pleasure, Heavenly Pain,” making Morrow’s howls of corporeal annihilation feel earned. They slow down and bring back their nasty riffs, thereby making them nastier. Each 90-second burst of malevolence here is a writhing, breathing being that Gulch have fully under their control. Impenetrable Cerebral Fortress ends with a cover suggesting Gulch might have their sights set on bigger things. The closing “Sin In My Heart,” relatively epic at three and a half minutes, isn’t a particularly obscure or counterintuitive cover choice for a hardcore band. Gulch have wisely identified the Siouxsie and the Banshees song that already came equipped with a hardcore bassline and a hardcore lyric sheet (nearly half is just the title being repeated). They aren’t breaking the mold or expanding the horizons of hardcore, just providing an infusion of vitality when the genre should feel paralyzed; if the pit ever opens again, they’ll be ready when we are.

Songbook EP,otta,by: Madison Bloom,Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f2847341372d03553804d96/1:1/w_160/Songbook%20EP_otta.jpg,2020-08-06 05:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/otta-songbook-ep/,PIASBOKKLE,"Seven years ago, the London-based Anna Ottridge could be found on YouTube performing acoustic versions of Amy Winehouse and English folk trio Daughter. Her voice—agile and slightly smoky—was already refined, but the music was not her own, and the coffeehouse-cover-singer archetype was well-worn. In the years since, Ottridge has developed her own distinctive songcraft. These days, Anna Ottridge is otta, and her new EP Songbook (released on producer Kwes’ BOKKLE imprint)  is a promising collection of meticulous electro-pop tempered by her dusky vocals. Songbook is Ottridge’s second release under her new moniker, following her 2020 debut EP after it all blew over, and it stands apart from her prior work; across eight tracks, she details her bedroom-pop compositions with a lush palette of synthesizers, saxophone, organ, and midi strings, bringing her closer to an avant pop group like Field Music than the cafe singer-songwriter she used to be. Songbook is bookended by its two strongest tracks: “never see” and “just like the rain,” which are also the EP’s most uptempo and danceable moments. The former maximizes three main elements: canned percussion, a crawling bassline, and otta’s layered vocals, stacked like a sheaf of crisp paper. “never see” is a promise that there is someone out there who is made to love you—who “wants to know the smell of your soap.” But the song is as much of a warning as it is a pledge: you might be standing in your own way of  that love. When a tangle of grim synthesizers swarm the song’s final moments, it’s difficult to tell if the story ends in love or loss—a marker of otta’s nuanced approach. “just like the rain” is similarly bittersweet, bobbing between a disco beat and thumping bass as otta turns phrases that sound wiser than her 23 years. “Nothing can keep you from yourself if you don’t let yourself out,” she sings, before the song is washed away in a synthesized downpour, groaning saxophone, and swipes of piano. otta’s manipulation of her vocal tracks is particularly interesting here—she braids them into strange, eerie howls. It’s a welcome subversion of her otherwise-sweet melodies. otta’s skills as a producer (and engineer and mixer) are evident throughout Songbook, and they set her apart from countless young artists coming up in the South London scene. Musical interlude “suihku” is particularly compelling—a slaw of vocal samples and synthesizer fragments chopped at a frantic pace. There are hints of anxious electronica buried throughout the EP, but “suihku” reveals them in their bare and bracing form. If Songbook has one major flaw, it’s the late-album ballad “no more tears.” Here, otta’s vocals are glossed over with AutoTune, compressing her unique and vulnerable voice and making it sound like everybody else’s. The song falls prey to a recent trend that seemingly requires fledgling artists to use Vocoder on a minimum of one song per album (see: Porridge Radio’s “(Something),” Becky and the Birds’ “Do U Miss Me,” and ALASKALASKA’s “Arrows,” to start). It’s as if otta is ticking a box labeled “Contemporary Music Trend,” an understandable urge for a young artist, but unnecessary for someone with such a developed style. Anna Ottridge may still be finding her voice as otta, but Songbook makes an exciting case for the search itself. Catch up every Saturday with 10 of our best-reviewed albums of the week.

Detuned Reworks,Max de Wardener,by: Ben Cardew,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f285c89d421092dd8f6cf16/1:1/w_160/Detuned%20Reworks_Max%20de%20Wardener.jpg,2020-08-06 05:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/max-de-wardener-detuned-reworks/,Village Green,"Max de Wardener’s Music for Detuned Pianos is such an exquisitely singular album that reworking it feels like deconstructing ice cream: largely unnecessary, potentially destructive, and unlikely to yield results as perfectly palatable as the original product. And yet, six short months after the release of Detuned Pianos, on which composer de Wardener used unorthodox tunings to create deliciously spooky acoustic vignettes, we have Detuned Reworks, featuring remixes by six UK producers drawn from the leftfield club scene and experimental electronic music. The results are often intriguing, sometimes exasperating, and occasionally revelatory. Perhaps the biggest discovery to be made on Detuned Reworks is how extraordinarily potent the original album’s piano parts are when untethered from their mother album. Composed by de Wardener and performed by pianist Kit Downes, their otherworldly melodies are the musical equivalent of truffle oil: powerful sensory agents to be splashed across the mix, rather than employed in great quantities. London experimental-music whirlwind Loraine James wields piano notes like weapons in her predatory remix of “Foxtrot,” slashing snatches of waspish playing across irregular electronic beats like swords through grapefruit, while experimental polymath Rupert Clervaux sets two lines from “Deranged Landscape” against each other in rickety patterns, then feeds off the results, adding sparse but effective drums to the uncanny mix. Composer and cellist Oliver Coates’ “Blue Slime Mix” of “Blueshift,” meanwhile, takes a dribble of the original’s nautical piano wobble and uses it as a base for an excruciatingly nervy acoustic drone, which builds like the headache-inducing tension of a really bad day at the office. It’s not so much that these reworks are improvements on de Wardener’s original songs; rather, the producers pull de Wardener’s work into their own orbits. Clervaux nudges “Deranged Landscape” from its camp on the borders of Aphex Twin’s Selected Ambient Works Volume II toward the suggestion of a basement jazz club, while Call Super masterfully manipulates cinematic album opener “The Sky Has a Film” into a syrupy, house-indebted number that deserves to be heard on expensive speakers at the start of an adventurous night out. The reworks that don’t succeed are those where the producer fails to stamp an identity onto the original work, leaving it in a ponderous halfway house. Coby Sey is a promising artist whose warped vision of modern music would seem to fit with Detuned Pianos’ witchy universe. But his remix of “Bismuth Dream” is a little too blandly beautiful, a betrayal of the original’s unsettling gloom rather than a transformation of it. Manchester producer Herron comes across as if intimidated by the source material, using echoing snatches of piano and an awkward electronic beat that don’t even seem on talking terms, let alone in collaboration. If there is a whiff of regret to this generally fascinating album, it’s that de Wardener didn’t push the boat farther out, both stylistically and geographically, in his choice of remixers. It would be fascinating to see what someone like 100 gecs or Angolan producer Nazar, for example, might do with Detuned Pianos’ slippery source material. As it stands, though, Detuned Reworks is an avant cheerleader for Music for Detuned Pianos’ considerable charms, sending you back to the original album with a hungry ear and newly sharpened mind.

B7,Brandy,by: Stephen Kearse,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f1f3fa7d421092dd8f6c8d8/1:1/w_160/b7_brandy.jpg,2020-08-05 05:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/brandy-b7/,Brand NueOne,"In the nearly eight years since her last studio album, Brandy has maintained a sturdy foothold in R&B and rap. She elevates Ty Dolla $ign’s weary hometown paean “LA” and serves as the spirit guide on “Ascension,” the climax of Jhené Aiko’s druggy second album. Her megahit “The Boy Is Mine” is the lodestar for two Mahalia songs, “He’s Mine” and “What You Did.” Vince Staples shouts out her song  “I Wanna Be Down” on FM!; Chance the Rapper’s “Ballin Flossin” interpolates it. Despite this active influence (as well as her regular TV roles across the 2010s), B7 bills itself as a return. “Sorry for my tardy,” Brandy sings on opener “Saving All My Love,” as if she’s running hours late to a party in her honor. The apology feels warm and sincere, but the music that follows never recaptures that initial glow. Brandy has never been a particularly scenic writer, but she made up for it with extravagant, heartfelt performances. While her reputation as “the vocal bible” seems to overlook the Gospel According to Whitney, the way she layers coos, sighs, and hums into knots of harmony and texture evokes the interiority of love, how it exists in your mind as much as with another person. Her best music makes romance feel like a transplant, a foreign force adopted into your essence, keeping you alive—unless, of course, it kills you. The writing and performances on B7, though, are reserved. On “Unconditional Oceans” Brandy flatly describes love as a brewing storm. “The tidal winds blowing/The storm inside is growing,” she sings, sounding less like a storm-chaser than a news anchor reading from a teleprompter. “Lucid Dreams” is just as deflated. “Guilt dealt me tragedy inside/Ate me alive,” Brandy sings, hinting at inner turmoil and strife (and possibly alluding to a fatal car accident she was involved in in 2006) but not really revealing the shape of her emotions. There’s a strong sense of distance to B7, as if Brandy is recounting stories secondhand despite them ostensibly being her own. She’s described the record, which has been released under her newly created imprint Brand Nu, as “freeing,” but she generally feels more withdrawn than liberated. That detachment might work if there were more sensuousness and motion to the record, but there’s little momentum to these songs. Nothing really builds, progresses, or ascends. Instead of drama, there is poise. Sometimes it works, as on “Borderline,” which is a coil of threats that feel perilously close to coming true. “Don’t you ever hurt me/I’ll change on you,” Brandy warns, her voice quaking with tension. You can feel the strain of her composure. She’s just as vulnerable on “Baby Mama,” proudly reclaiming the often dismissive term, but still baring her fangs. “Ain’t depending on you, I’m a baby mama,” Brandy says, the statement a boast and sneer. Less compelling are the moments when Brandy holds steady. “Bye Bipolar” is a by-the-numbers kissoff that makes a clumsy pun of “bipolar” as Brandy spurns a leechy ex with saintly grace. Her dressing-down is so respectful and coolheaded you wonder why she’s bothering. On “I Am More,” she tries to end a love triangle, giving the guy at the center of it an ultimatum. “I can’t be the other woman/Mistress or a side piece order/I need more/Cause I am more,” she sings. But there’s no venom to her protest, no stakes. The production is the album’s saving grace. Brandy, who has production credits on nearly every song, favors colorful and springy arrangements. Hit-Boy’s horn loop on “Baby Mama” is so bouncy that the song sways even when the percussion drops out. The ticking hi-hats and muted chords of Darhyl Camper Jr., LaShawn Daniels, and Brandy’s joint production on “Borderline” highlight the subtle upward and downward arcs of Brandy’s multiple harmonies; her voice is constantly coalescing and dissipating. And the propulsive finger snaps and bass kicks of “No Tomorrow” contrast the song’s grim subject matter about the end of a relationship. Though Brandy’s voice remains a beautiful, resonant instrument, her songwriting here is so often functional and humdrum, and her performances rarely sparkle with personality or feeling. It’s obvious she has many stories to tell; what’s less clear is what compels her to tell them, what makes her want to sing. Catch up every Saturday with 10 of our best-reviewed albums of the week.

Distance,Jess Cornelius,by: Grayson Haver Currin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f1f0179dee9688e9b66a5e8/1:1/w_160/distance_jess%20cornelius.jpg,2020-08-05 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/jess-cornelius-distance/,Loantaka,"Jess Cornelius prefers to remain in motion. Born and raised in New Zealand, the singer decamped to Australia in her late teens, launching the promising Melbourne rock band Teeth & Tongue several years later. Across four albums, Teeth & Tongue pivoted constantly, from snarling Bad Seeds blues to the velvet-gloved rock of Feist to synth-pop so cloying it seemed like a last cynical bid on careerism. After a decade stuck at the precipice of a breakthrough, Cornelius stepped away from Teeth & Tongue in 2017 to record five solo songs, all spare electric strums and soaring vibrato. That EP, Nothing Is Lost, felt at last like Cornelius’ real breakthrough—arching psalms of sadness and disappointment, rendered with the quiver and clarity of Angel Olsen. Her debut LP, the arresting Distance, suggests it was not another phase. Cornelius left Australia in 2018 for Los Angeles, where she began recording Distance in a series of studios with session bands that included members of the War on Drugs, Warpaint, and Woods. She brought her restlessness with her, and it animates these 10 songs, from the way she treats musical inspirations and reference points like quick trysts to her lyrical disinterest in monogamy or the mores of adulthood. In recent years, the tension between being a footloose touring musician and the social pressure to grow up compelled Cornelius to grapple with age and expectation. On Distance, she details difficult situations—miscarriages, breakups, affairs, pep talks for one—with tragicomic candor, looking less for sympathy than a way to work through the mess. “You’re lonely,” she sings at one point. “Oh, but ain’t you livin’?” Slipping in and out of musical guises with preternatural ease, Cornelius remains a chameleonic bandleader, as she was with Teeth & Tongue. She jabs back at some selfish prick with the punchy garage-rock of “Banging My Head” and floats through a languid R&B haze for “Easy for No One,” an ode to not finding some great meaning or purpose in growing up. The muted doo-wop of “Palm Trees” moves on a similar California breeze as Best Coast, a mode tailormade for Cornelius’ questions about what a new state of residence may do for her state of mind. Much of Distance hinges on some version of a rock band—even “Love and Low Self Esteem,” a barbed codependence critique that served as the centerpiece of Cornelius’ EP, gets fitted with walloping drums and howling organs. But Distance’s quiet, spare outlier is one of its most stunning moments. A duet for her wistful nylon-stringed guitar and Mary Lattimore’s pensive harp, “Born Again” conjures the candlelit majesty of Marissa Nadler or even Sandy Denny. Cornelius’ bracing voice suddenly sounds ancient and fading, rendering snapshots of her youth against a backdrop of feeling tired and worn by time. “One of these days, I’m going to be born again,” she briefly taunts, as though ready to maraud in search of lost youth. For the most part, though, Cornelius handles heaviness with an enviable lightness, finding new resiliency in every rebound. She’s funny, self-effacing, and honest, wry enough to half-apologize for any trouble she’s caused by having an affair while also hoping it resumes soon. Even “Body Memory,” where she mentions a miscarriage and surveys the damage it did to her relationship and sense of self, somehow feels ebullient. Harmonies lift her above each hurdle. Cornelius’ credo during all this is the brilliant “No Difference,” an anthem for finding happiness on whatever terms and in whatever way you deem reasonable. It’s the kind of song you might sing to yourself after any hard day. A curious thing happened to Cornelius in California before she could finish Distance: She met someone and, in late June, had a baby, Tui, exactly a month before releasing the record. She sighs at the very thought of having children during “Easy for No One,” as if it’s a possibility that’s simply passed her by. But in the jubilant music video for “Kitchen Floor,” a song about bailing on another one-night stand, she dances across the stars on Hollywood Boulevard in last night’s leopard-print dress while also very pregnant. That’s the delight of remaining in motion: You never know exactly what you’re going to find. Catch up every Saturday with 10 of our best-reviewed albums of the week.

Voices,Max Richter,by: Andy Beta,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f2863208fd5732600c34835/1:1/w_160/Voices_Max%20Richter.jpg,2020-08-05 05:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/max-richter-voices/,Decca,"Deemed humanity’s Magna Carta by Eleanor Roosevelt, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights of 1948 established a baseline for human rights around the world in the wake of the devastation of WWII. Its 30 articles respect the dignity of every human being and commit to nondiscrimination, while also guaranteeing rights to education, nationality, marriage, and leisure. It was an ambitious, wholly idealistic document then, and now—with the declining trend of democracy around the world—the goalposts of the UDHR feel even further away. Which may be one of the reasons why composer Max Richter based his latest work, Voices, on this profound piece of legislation. Richter brings together recordings of people in over 70 countries reading the document with a massive, peculiarly assembled orchestra. Emphasizing the lower timbres of the ensemble, there are credits for 13 double bassists and 23 cellists, an inversion of most philharmonic rosters that Richter deems an “upside down” orchestra. Since his emergence in 2004 with The Blue Notebooks, Richter has proven adept at couching 19th-century romanticism in 21st-century pessimism, often using the human voice as conduit. On “All Human Beings,” it’s fitting that one of the document’s main architects, Eleanor Roosevelt, appears first, her voice wrapped in crackle as she reads the preamble to the UDHR. But then the album’s principal voice, that of actor KiKi Layne, emerges to narrate the first two articles, before giving way to a solemn theme and a mournful violin solo. Already it feels like an insurmountable chasm between the words and the music, the hopeful ideal of the declaration offset by melancholy, Richter’s lament accentuating our failure as a global society to enact even a few of these guiding principles. More voices arise and overlap (the album credits 32 Declaration readers), some reading the text in their native tongues, others lingering at the periphery, with Layne’s voice reappearing to demarcate sections. In the brief “Journey Piece,” Layne recites an article over a chatter of voices, which then mix with birdsong and a passing car. The unadorned piano at the heart of “Prelude 6” also stands apart for its spareness. Fascinating as it is to hear the full text of these articles aloud, the prose doesn’t have quite the same supple musicality as previous Richter sources like Franz Kafka’s journals or the letters of Virginia Woolf. After a few times through, the primary text of Voices starts to take on the rigidity of an employee conduct handbook from HR. Voices’ most transportive moment comes during the 11-minute centerpiece “Chorale.” At first, Layne oddly recites the opening articles of the UDHR again, but when she recedes, a wordless choir takes her place. Their assembled voices eschew language altogether yet speak to the lofty themes of the Declaration. They present the curious entity that is humanity joined as one, stronger together yet always at risk of splintering. Such a beatific sound speaks to our angelic aspects, even when the music of Richter also suggests human fragility and our fallible nature.

Actual Presence,Carlos Niño & Friends,by: Marty Sartini Garner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f2830eb97c3394bd82870df/1:1/w_160/actual%20presence_carlos%20nino%20&%20friends.jpg,2020-08-05 05:00:00,Jazz,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/carlos-nino-and-friends-actual-presence/,self-released,"Carlos Niño has always been attuned to the atomic. Twenty-five years ago, when the prolific L.A. percussionist, arranger, and producer was merely a revolutionary teenaged DJ, he designed his radio show Spaceways as a method for tracing back the long lines that led to hip-hop. He’d play jazz and funk records whose samples formed the bedrock of the genre, eventually moving deeper into new age, folk, and recordings from around the world. Judging by the pan-genre music he’s spent his career perfecting, the process trained him to see songs as being made of discrete units: a series of moments that might one day lead elsewhere and connect to unrelated sounds in unexpected ways. On Actual Presence, the seventh album in his long-running Carlos Niño & Friends series, he tries to anticipate as many of these moments and connections as possible, traveling along with his collaborators as they open door after door on a staggering number of paths. Niño isn’t a traditional bandleader; he’s more of a weather system, hovering over and influencing the events at hand. As it weaves through free jazz, ambient, new age, hip-hop, contemporary classical, and beat music, Actual Presence is often beyond its creator’s ultimate control, which is probably the point; listening to it is like being rocked to sleep in the abyss. Working with frequent collaborators like Jamael Dean, Jamire Williams, Miguel Atwood-Ferguson, Iasos, Deantoni Parks, and Sam Gendel, Niño subjects these songs to a kind of musical Spirograph, spinning them along and finding joy every way he turns them. Consider it cubist healing music, presenting support from every possible angle. Much of Actual Presence was cobbled together from live and in-studio improv sets, which Niño then edited and augmented in post-production. He manipulates the stereo space with ease, moving the listener through multiple dimensions as these songs unfold. “Explorations 7” opens with a gorgeous piano run from Dean that transitions into a Cecil Taylor mambo, which Devin Daniels cheerfully chases down with his alto sax. Niño takes us through a veil of gongs, plucking out Randy Gloss’ pandeiro and dunking it in reverb, then stripping away the rest of the band and dropping into a brand-new, crystalline space; when the musicians return, the air between them sounds polished. “Luis’ Special Shells,” meanwhile, opens in a lobby, where the titular shells hold court with a plonking keyboard. Niño kindly shoulders through, leading the way to a noticeably larger stage where fireflies of gong and cymbal flit around a spotlit Dean, who plays an aching lament. At any given moment, Niño seems to be thinking of where else he needs to take us, moving quickly from room to room as if he’s chasing the spirit through myriad incarnations. Dean is both the album’s shooting star and its grounding point. He performs the same role Lonnie Liston Smith did for the early Pharoah Sanders groups, setting the scene with a few chords and hammering everyone back into tonality when necessary, and he gives Niño a solid  place to return when the post-production excursions threaten to get too far out. Dean puts “Actually” in motion with a solo that recalls Girma Yifrashewa and Emahoy Tsegué-Maryam Guèbrou’s blend of Ethiopian and Western classical modes, trickling his notes through the rocks of Niño’s hobbled bass synth. “Youwillgetthroughthis, I promise” glides to an end on the back of his organ, which emanates from Alice Coltrane’s ashram in one moment and Frank Ocean’s warehouse in the next. With field recordings of rain and waves splashing around him, the steadiness Dean provides for the song’s long denouement is the musical equivalent to the second half of its title—a sudden shift to standard grammar that signals how sincere we should understand the message to be. When John Coltrane and Eric Dolphy overturned jazz conventions (and greatly annoyed jazz critics) with what would be called the “new thing” in 1961, Coltrane justified their moves by claiming they were “just another way of saying that this is a big, beautiful universe we live in, that’s been given to us, and here’s an example of just how magnificent and encompassing it is.” Though it was partially recorded before the pandemic and the uprisings that have defined 2020, Actual Presence is music for an unpleasant present. It’s discordant and fractured, and it frequently comes off as a long trip toward a salvation that’s just out of reach. But like Coltrane, whose spiritual influence runs deep here, Carlos Niño believes in a big, beautiful universe that exists in spite of the present suffering. The sprawling, ever-changing sound of Actual Presence is his best attempt yet to recreate the joy of losing yourself to it. Catch up every Saturday with 10 of our best-reviewed albums of the week.

Couldn’t Wait to Tell You,Liv.e,by: Sheldon Pearce,Contributing Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f281d9397c3394bd82870a7/1:1/w_160/couldn't%20wait%20to%20tell%20you_liv.e.jpg,2020-08-04 05:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/live-couldnt-wait-to-tell-you/,In Real Life,"Couldn’t Wait to Tell You, the debut album from vocalist Liv.e, is like a series of thought bubbles you can hear. This raw, loose, and sometimes shapeless exploration of the R&B form feels like it’s mapping the mind, but instead of diagramming a brain under love’s thrall, it traces the idle musings in the margins. It understands that romance isn’t all dialogue, overtures, and sex; a lot of it is waiting, awkward silences, and deciding what to text back and when. Sung, spoken, and rapped, these delightful songs exude personality. They explore anticipation, longing, eagerness, hesitation, indecision—the in-between moments, when love is passive, when you’re making up your mind, when you’re ready or anxious. Liv.e performs each state of being with skill, sounding more and more confident in her voice. The Dallas-raised, Los Angeles-based singer-songwriter, rapper, and producer has eclectic taste. She started her career as a DJ at Dolfin Records, and early mixes on her SoundCloud demonstrate a fascination with the alt rap underground (Knxwledge, Mndsgn, etc.). The turntablist impulse to create something new using familiar components also informs the music she makes as Liv.e, pulling from classic soul, neo soul, jazz, and hip-hop. Her breakout project, the 10.4 ROG-produced :​:​hoopdreams​:​:, earned her a few famous fans (Erykah Badu and Earl Sweatshirt), but Couldn’t Wait to Tell You is far more evolved. She wrote and recorded it in a month while staying with her mother in St. Louis, and she describes its songs as pages out of a diary representing the perspectives of different characters she made up. But the 20 tracks feel less like diary entries and more like snippets from an anthology. Their episodic structure resembles the prismatic Whack World; even when the songs sound unrelated, they are still bound by a shared aesthetic vision. Fleeting and intense yet somehow interconnected, they share a sort of dream logic. Several are under 90 seconds; some play with mantra, others with structure. The whimsical elevator Muzak of “Lessons From My Mistakes...but I Lost Your Number” eventually transforms into a groovy upright bass riff as Liv.e explains the concept of entropy. Many songs do not have hooks; they just settle until they dissolve. “About Love at 21” bleeds seamlessly into “She’s My Brand New Crush.” The fluidity of her mindset mirrors the fluidity with which she transitions between rich soul soundscapes. Many songs are co-produced by experimental jazz looper mejiwahn and multi-instrumentalist Daoud Anthony, producer on Saba’s CARE FOR ME and composer of music for the New York Times’ Pulitzer-winning 1619 Project. The music fits somewhere on the spectrum with Nick Hakim’s smelting psychedelic soul, SAULT’s revolutionary synth-funk, and KeiyaA’s third-eye R&B reflections. Liv.e’s sound is unique in its adherence to lo-fi beatmaker aesthetics and reimagining of throwback R&B vibes. The songs on :​:​hoopdreams​:​: seemed to smudge together into a continuous 16-minute track, but Couldn’t Wait to Tell You is full of distinctive moments that form a whole. And Liv.e is much surer of herself as a performer, centering her ideas as much as her taste. Her writing is casual, sometimes bearing the informal tone of an internal monologue, sometimes conversational and curious. Her songs peer into specific scenarios, capturing feelings the way emojis do—with hyper-specific gestures and expressions. There’s the novelty of a crush; the empowering freedom of finally moving on; the certainty that someone is The One (“I want this to last forever more!” she sings on “You the One Fish in the Sea”); the ambivalence of not wanting to pursue a lover, but remaining hopeful that they care enough to close the distance themselves. “I stopped calling, you was acting kinda funny/You expected me to act all types of bubbly,” she sings on “LazyEaterBetsOnHerLikeness.” “I can’t play myself because I’m not over you/I’ma choose myself, I hope that you choose me too.” What might initially scan as a scatterbrained or unrefined approach to songwriting is actually a subtle consideration of several interlinked headspaces. The storytelling comes into sharper focus than on Liv.e’s previous projects, but the greatest developments on Couldn’t Wait to Tell You are her execution and vocal technique. She has spoken in the past about warping her vocals as if they were a beat in Ableton and getting real “sciencey” with effects, and here it is as if she knows just what is required at a given time. The raw harmonies of “I Been Livin” spill out over the quiet knock of the beat, the reverb echoing across the distorted piano. The spoken-word flows unravel into the spacey production during “Cut to the Chase.” On “How She Stay Conflicted...i Hope He Understands,” she duets with the sample. Her singing has garnered comparisons to Badu and Tweet, but throughout Couldn’t Wait to Tell You, Liv.e is becoming an unmistakable and singular artist. Even when it feels like we’re merely privy to what’s inside her head, her thoughts resonate outward. Catch up every Saturday with 10 of our best-reviewed albums of the week.

On&On,Daniel Blumberg,by: Noah Yoo,Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f2820a51009986b9b825b4f/1:1/w_160/on&on_daniel%20blumberg.jpg,2020-08-04 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/daniel-blumberg-onandon/,Mute,"To improvise is to stand at the edge of a precipice and cast yourself over, with the belief that something—your own proficiency, other players, familiar musical meter, or pure luck—will catch you on the way down. The legendary free-music guitarist Derek Bailey referred to it as “playing without memory”: to rid oneself of standard chords and pre-established songwriting expectations and instead allow spontaneity to guide a performance. When Daniel Blumberg left Yuck in 2013, this was the world he immersed himself in—one that wasn’t predicated on mining ’90s rock nostalgia so much as consummating his ever-evolving vision. He established himself as a fixture at the London experimental music haven Cafe OTO and spent the next five years performing and collaborating with other like-minded musicians, releasing music in various formations—Hebronix, Oupa, and Guo, to name a few—but mostly making art and staying out of the public eye. After going through a breakup, Blumberg dipped his toes back into conventional songwriting, resulting in his 2018 solo debut, Minus. That record was built around unhurried ballads with atonal flourishes, whereas his latest album, On&On, is based on repetition and reinterpretation of recurring themes, like he’s looking to break free from having to arrange traditional songs altogether. On&On features the same musicians from Minus (Ute Kanngiesser on cello, Billy Steiger on violin, Tom Wheatly on double bass, and Jim White of Dirty Three on drums), who Blumberg has credited with being instrumental to his artistic process. Iterations of the title track are interspersed throughout the record like temporal markers, each of them more formless than the last, with an additional “&On” appended each time to signify the developing nature of the work. These recurrences share just the semblance of a melodic motif; some are gentle, others chaotic. On the opener, he summons a reverie with gentle acoustic guitar and artificial harmonics. “Take a man out for a walk, holding his hand,” he muses, seconds before a sudden, violent thwock punctures the stereo field. Is that a percussive non-sequitur by White or a fortuitously toppled instrument? It doesn’t really matter; it’s forever a part of that one recording, and it will never happen again. Blumberg and the quartet move with gentle fluidity, displaying a trust that can only be forged by hours of listening to each other play. You can hear this on songs like “Sidestep Summer”—where a discordant groove gives way to a delicate chorus that slips away almost as soon as it arrives, replaced by abrasive splashes of sound—or the simmering pitter-patter and room noise that opens “Silence Breaker,” where the band is joined by Elvin Brandhi, the improvisational lyricist who’s also Blumberg’s partner in the duo BAKH. Though it’s billed as a solo album, On&On captures what is ultimately a community effort. The songs are Blumberg’s, but the performance belongs to them all. The seven-minute indie-rock centerpiece “Bound” is the closest Blumberg comes to writing something reminiscent of his past projects. There’s a powerful moment at its midpoint when the pining guitar line disintegrates and all momentum suddenly grinds to a halt. “It was a mistake to put that ring on your finger,” Blumberg moans as layers of textural tremolo bowing begin to lift him up. “When I hit the hay/When I end the day… To be online forever/To be offline together.” It’s the only time he makes specific reference to modern-day ailments, as if to remind us that he hasn’t entirely sequestered himself away. Like Minus, On&On was recorded and seen through completion by producer Pete Walsh, the longtime Scott Walker collaborator who worked with the pop star turned avant-garde enigma for decades. It’s hard not to draw career parallels between Blumberg and artists like Walker or the late David Berman, who mentored Blumberg and to whom the album is dedicated. All of these artists got some taste of music stardom early in their lives before rejecting that premise altogether and dedicating themselves to the notions that moved them: craft, process, and perilous experimentation. Blumberg asserts that even for the creator, a song can be whatever you need it to be in the moment, a vessel for self-exploration. On&On shows that he’s wholly enmeshed his songwriting and improvisation in a way that feels unique to him. Buy: Rough Trade Catch up every Saturday with 10 of our best-reviewed albums of the week.

Sun Piano,Laraaji,by: Nathan Taylor Pemberton,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f08d464cf636938160481ab/1:1/w_160/Sun%20Piano_Laraaji.jpg,2020-08-04 05:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/laraaji-sun-piano/,All Saints,"Perhaps the most famous moment of Edward Larry Gordon’s career is his meeting with Brian Eno. The story feels mythic now, like a Disney movie set in the experimental-music scene: Upon seeing him sitting cross-legged and hammering away at open-tuned zither in New York City’s Washington Square park, Eno invited Gordon to perform at a nearby studio, an act of serendipity that culminated with the release of 1980’s Ambient 3: Day of Radiance, released under Gordon’s new moniker, Laraaji. 40 years on, the story still overshadows Laraaji’s legend as a pioneer of ambient and new age music. He’s responsible for more than 50 albums by now, but his evolution as a performer and his status as an innovator are both footnoted by Eno’s long-ago role as a musical (and white) savior. Before that fateful encounter, Gordon had a small acting role in the cult 1969 media satire Putney Swope, directed by Roberty Downey Sr. Later, as a slapstick comedian working at the Apollo Theater in Harlem (where he still lives today), he shared stages with Barry White and Roberta Flack. All of this occurred before his meditative practice revealed a concept of “sound vision” to him and inspired his first album of zither-based works, Celestial Vibrations, which came out under his birth name in 1978. Laraaji’s newest album, Sun Piano, is the first installment in a trilogy of improvised recording projects. Recorded at a church in Brooklyn, the album is another emanation of Laraaji’s distinctive connection to music—as a source of energy, as a way of being in the world, and as a personal practice. As the title hints, the album shows Laraaji returning his first instrument, the piano, which he studied at Howard University. In a recent Washington Post interview, he described his time at Howard as a period of learning less about formal composition, his specific field of study, and more about acquiring an attitude for approaching the piano. “The piano is an instrument that gives voice to how I hold space for light,” he said. In their own way, the performances captured on Sun Piano attempt to pass this radiance on to listeners. It’s an act of transference that never fully delivers on the inner escape offered by Laraaji’s more recognizable zither and synthesizer-based performances. On the album’s centerpiece, “This Too Shall Pass,” a plucky and playful ascending progression quickly loses its charm as a theme, settling to hammer its way to a finish. The recording, which is distant and compressed, squeezes all the character out of Laraaji’s soft technique. The gentle arpeggiations of “Temple of New Light” might possess the same kind of solar power found on Day of Radiance, but its brittle sonics will leave headphone listeners feeling sun-poisoned during the louder parts. The same dynamics nearly mar “Lifting Me,” but then the piece locks into a mantra-like rhythm, notes landing like muted mallet hits. It’s an apex of Sun Piano, offering us the feeling one might associate with a mood-altering ray of sun during a blustery day. At four minutes, though, the feeling doesn’t last. Laraaji’s playing on Sun Piano isn’t technically ambitious; he opts for short, safe runs and open chords that rub up against some dissonant voicings as he fiddles with the mixture of notes. Harmonies, countermelodies, and complex compositional structures are avoided to better focus on the energy of a given moment. Sometimes, as with the perfect closer “Embracing Timeless,” which moves across the keyboard like a plotless morning walk, you wish Laraaji lingered for his customary 30 minutes or longer. Sun Piano may just be a minor spark in a career that has emitted sound, and vision, in a slow, consistent burn. Our greatest living practitioner of new age music has lived a life intent on casting light into the darkened recesses of the self and of the spirit. Even if his latest offering is considerably dimmer than his most golden works, it’s still a confident assertion that, even at 77 years old, his pursuit of the sun’s life-affirming light shows no signs of wavering.

Triz,Pontiac Streator,by: Will Gottsegen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f282c6c20c060333f0a58ef/1:1/w_160/triz_pontiac%20treator.jpg,2020-08-04 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/pontiac-streator-triz/,Motion Ward,"Pontiac Streator’s music seems deliberately engineered to confuse; it arrives without any real clues as to how it’s meant to be parsed. The pseudonymous Streator is based in Philadelphia, but his releases are conceptually detached from place. They don’t belong to Philly, or any other city, as much they belong to a particular scene. You might call it West Mineral-adjacent; flitting between styles and stage names, the loosely defined collective putting out ambient-electronic music on labels like Motion Ward and Experiences Ltd. is unified by a commitment to the intentionally obscure.  It suggests that these heady sounds are more purely absorbed without the constraints of identity and specificity. This elusive M.O. works on the level of Streator’s discography, too. 11 Items, Streator’s 2019 collaboration with Ulla Straus, handled a dizzying breadth of textures, from slippery, percussive rumblings (“Item 3”) to a sort of sleek, postmodern TV performance, complete with samples of a live studio audience (“Item 7”). The projects Streator has already put out this year range from punishing cybergrind and noise (virtualdemonlaxative) to restless, tongue-in-cheek ambient (Micro Incubus) to more amorphous chill-out music (Select Works . vol 1). All of it is uniquely stubborn, resisting interpretation at every turn. Streator’s new solo album Triz is just as confounding as these past works, but offers a deeper, buzzier high. The density is part of the appeal; with repeated listens, the record’s intricate mixes yield new surprises. “Post Los” is a burbling mass of unplaceable, vaguely organic sounds, as indebted to the alien dialogue in District 9 as to the effects of Space Cadet 3D Pinball. “Lamp Fest,” another feat of layering, is roomier, and nearly tropical—as close to restful as the album comes, while still managing to sustain the spell. Though there are no lead vocal parts on Triz, the album is haunted by voices. Ghostly hums trace the contours of “Transier Unt”—a chilly fractal of ambient electronics—while “Trizlang Gem” rests on soft choral figures. “Om Ne Ud” recalls Loscil’s aquatic concept record Submers, but the textures here are busier and more tightly knit; studded with blips that feel a little like sonar, the track bleeds periodically into lo-fi radio crackle—transmissions of what sounds like a human voice, its message hopelessly scrambled. On “Angelus Spit,” which invites similarly garbled vocal fragments into an emptier tableau, those corrupted blasts feel like a taunt. The truth echoes out there, Streator hints: It would offer some resolution, if only we had the tools to decode it. The breakdown of communication and perception is at the heart of the final track, “Stuck in a Cave.” The production is sticky and humid, embellished with alien bird calls; what might initially scan as naturalistic is filtered to the point of feeling eerily artificial. Streator works best in the dark, in constructed interiors and glitched-out paradoxes; here, finally, the radio dispatches of “Om Ne Ud” and “Angelus Spit” crystallize into something at least perceptible, if not entirely lucid: “I’m stuck in a cave, what’s happening?” Triz is less an answer to the question than an acknowledgment that there may not be one.

No Horizon EP,Wye Oak,by: Evan Rytlewski,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f243f78d421092dd8f6ccf5/1:1/w_160/No%20Horizon%20EP_Wye%20Oak.jpg,2020-08-03 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/wye-oak-no-horizon-ep/,Merge,"At some point over the last decade, impermanence became Wye Oak’s muse. The duo’s early projects were defined by Jenn Wasner’s guitars, whose eruptions gave their otherwise-dreamy indie rock a volatile edge. There were keyboards, too, but they were mostly limited to whatever drummer Andy Stack could play with his free hand. Since Wasner issued a temporary moratorium on those signature guitars on 2014’s Shriek, however, every album has been, if not quite a reinvention, then a reconsideration of their core sound, a study in how a band can evolve when they refuse the most obvious path forward. Their sound has been digitized and de-digitized, built up and stripped back, with no suggestion that any iteration was anything more than a pit stop. Until recently, the lone constant of the group had been their two-piece lineup, but even that’s been open to amendment. Before their most recent tour was cut short by the COVID-19 pandemic, the duo had expanded to a five-piece, where they performed material not only from Wye Oak but from the respective side projects to which Wasner and Stack have increasingly dedicated more of their time. And on Wye Oak’s new No Horizon EP—which, true to the band’s malleable nature, sounds little like the tantalizing standalone tracks the band has been dropping over the last year or two—they’re joined by a different set of temporary contributors. The EP was recorded with the Brooklyn Youth Chorus, a mammoth choir that lends a shot of instant grandiosity to everything they touch, including recent tracks by The National and Bon Iver. It’s incredible how the notion of an indie-rock choir has expanded since the mid ’00s, when Saddle Creek artists might invite whoever happened to be near the studio over for what amounted to a campfire sing-along. The Brooklyn Youth Chorus doesn’t do informality. Their arrangements are as ornate and stately as chapel glass, every interweaving vocal meticulously plotted for maximum orchestral impact. They don’t merely augment the songs on No Horizon; they drive them. Opener “AEIOU” dazzles with layer upon layer of kaleidoscopic refractions of voice. On “No Place,” the choir subsumes Wasner’s dusky vocals almost completely; here, she’s just one singer among dozens. An air of secrecy once shrouded Wye Oak’s records, a fog that loomed over the production like a Do Not Enter sign, but in recent years they’ve let their sound grow more direct and open. On 2011’s Civilian, Wasner’s murmur swallowed key lyrics whole, as if protecting them from the world. Now she has a choir belting them. “When the world is just a concept, everything has hidden meaning,” they chime on “Sky Witness,” a line that’s as perfect a thesis statement for Wasner’s songwriting as any. For all its wow factor, No Horizon has less replay value than most Wye Oak releases. Because of those choral arrangements, it burns bright but fast—a little bit of coloratura goes a long way, and these songs don’t skimp on it. A full album of this would be overkill, so the EP’s small-plate portion works in its favor. So, too, does the unlikelihood that they’ll ever make another like it. Wye Oak is the rare band that grows less defined with each project, but their capacity for new ideas has yet to fail them. Catch up every Saturday with 10 of our best-reviewed albums of the week.

Indistinct Conversations,Land of Talk,by: Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f244281d421092dd8f6cd2b/1:1/w_160/Indistinct%20Conversations_Land%20of%20Talk.jpg,2020-08-03 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/land-of-talk-indistinct-conversations/,Saddle Creek,"Tucked away almost halfway through Land of Talk’s fourth album, Indistinct Conversations, is a question that’s also a revelation. Many songwriters try to grab listeners right away; Elizabeth Powell, the long-running Canadian band’s sole constant member, goes for the stream-of-consciousness, the gnomic, the curiously brambled. Emotions aren’t on Powell’s sleeve, they’re simmering under the skin. Or, as the Land of Talk singer and chief songwriter asks on “Love in 2 Stages,” a minor-key meditation on romantic vicissitudes heated up by syncopated stabs of keyboard, “I dig deep, why don’t you?” Indistinct Conversations is a testament to the tattered ideal that digging deep—for its own sake, regardless of the short-term outlook—can be worthwhile in the long run. After a mostly forgotten alt-rock debut as ELE_K* in 2003, Powell began turning heads with Land of Talk’s first effort, 2006’s wiry and thrilling Applause Cheer Boo Hiss EP. A succession of generally strong albums followed, each with high-profile collaborators and sensitive personal backstories. 2008’s Some Are Lakes was produced by then-boyfriend Justin Vernon of Bon Iver. 2010’s Cloak and Cipher featured Arcade Fire’s Jeremy Gara and followed Powell’s vocal-cord struggles. After a long break, 2017’s Life After Youth, with guests Sharon Van Etten and Sonic Youth’s Steve Shelley, was a musical homecoming informed by Powell’s father suffering a stroke. Land of Talk never quite shone as brightly as those other acts. But they persisted. With Indistinct Conversations, Powell’s private world is once again in flux, but this time there are no boldfaced names to dominate the narrative. Finally back in a Land of Talk groove after retreating from the music industry between Cloak and Cipher and Life After Youth, Powell has also begun identifying publicly as a non-binary femme, using the pronouns she/they. Aside from a few Montreal jazz-scene friends, the only collaborators here are Land of Talk drummer/keyboardist Mark “Bucky” Wheaton and bassist Christopher McCarron, who both co-produced the album with Powell at Wheaton’s home. Built mainly from Powell’s knotty acoustic guitar explorations and lyrical musings that feel like fragments from an exceptionally perceptive diary, it’s the most satisfying Land of Talk album yet. The few-frills production exposes just how gut-wrenching Powell’s songwriting can be. Gaslighting is by now a familiar concept, but first single “The Weight of That Weekend” traces the contours of a toxic encounter with devastating aplomb. “Always come at me from a different angle/Make me think I don’t understand/How I’m feeling,” Powell begins, parceling out the words just so. The Americana-ish folk-rock backdrop is understated, enlivened by a smattering of French horn, but the emotional stakes are high enough for Powell to add later, “This is a prayer for love.” Low-key emotional intensity abounds in these stark, sketch-like reveries. “I feel it like an empty hand,” Powell sings on the coyly titled “Compelled,” describing their lust for a lover who is with someone else—someone unworthy. In their cool deadpan, the evocative comparison sounds as old as time. On “Diaphanous,” the jolt comes with the playful opening rhyme (the title phrase with “half of us”) and then again with the dynamic shift as cascading drums join the gnarled electric guitar and fluttery saxophone. The album may be home-recorded, but the performers are road-tested. The last words we hear from Powell, on the penultimate, acoustic-strummed “Now You Want to Live in the Night,” are devastating in their plainspoken vulnerability: “Have I lost the feeling/What’s wrong with me?” It’s always felt difficult for Land of Talk fans to explain why this particular relatively down-the-middle indie-rock project was so good. As singer, songwriter, and guitarist, Powell’s voice was always appealing, off-kilter, and expressive, but there was never an unmistakable calling card, like the singular yawp of Hop Along’s Frances Quinlan or the life-or-death majesty of Big Thief. Perhaps the unhurried, existential sighs of Kurt Vile were closer all along. And while this album’s interstitial speech fragments wind up sounding like the guys at the bar during a live solo set, and “Look to You (Intro)” and “Look to You” would’ve been better as a single, soaring opus, these are minor complaints. Indistinct Conversations finally burrows into Land of Talk’s dormant identity, as a band willing to wait out passing trends and realize its own promise. Another flash of psychological truth comes on “A/B Futures,” a rare fist-pumper on this preternaturally subdued record. “You need someone to care for,” Powell insists. “Hey, make that me.” Catch up every Saturday with 10 of our best-reviewed albums of the week.

The Zombies / I Love You / R.I.P. ,The Zombies,by: Eric Harvey,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f244ecc44c3ee52a02c50c7/1:1/w_160/The%20Zombies_The%20Zombies.png,2020-08-03 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/the-zombies-i-love-you-rip-the-zombies/,CraftCraft,"At the peak of British Invasion fever, a quintet of bookish St. Albans teens intimated that the future of the UK “beat music” craze might sound less like the hyperactive R&B that made screaming Beatles fans so ecstatic and more like the stuff entrancing hipsters at the coffee shop. The Zombies’ first two singles, the noirish jazz-fusion psychodramas “She’s Not There” and “Tell Her No,” hit the Billboard top 10, making them instant stars—even bigger in the U.S. than the UK. “The Beatles had just broken America wide open, and there we were to trot along behind,” lead songwriter Rod Argent recalled. But lasting fame was not to be: After spending the next two years trying and failing to duplicate that success with little support from their label, Decca (the same company that infamously declined to sign the Beatles), they took an advance from CBS and holed up in Abbey Road Studios—in the hours that the Beatles weren’t recording Sgt. Pepper—to record their magnum opus, 1968’s Odessey and Oracle. Poorly promoted, the album tanked on both sides of the Atlantic, and Argent dissolved the band. A year later, when Odessey single “Time of the Season” shot surprisingly up the American charts, Zombies lead singer Colin Blunstone was back in England selling insurance, and Argent had formed a new band, simply called Argent. Americans who tried to see the band on tour in 1969 came away even more addled when a dodgy American company sent two impostor bands on the road to perform as the Zombies, one of which included two future members of ZZ Top. Meanwhile, UK music fans were treated to a newly recorded version of “She’s Not There” by someone called Neil MacArthur, who was actually Blunstone. The Zombies were the band that wasn’t there: too far ahead of the curve at the start of their career, and too far behind it four years later. For two decades after their dissolution, the Zombies’ were remembered mostly for their three classic singles: The first were two key historical markers of the British Invasion, the last a groovy reminder of the 1960s’ hippie-dominated denouement. The record industry’s non-stop cycles of reissues and remasters patched together the band’s legacy: Rhino’s 1987 CD reissue of Odessey and Oracle helped solidify the album’s rightful status as a psych-pop classic—Rolling Stone called it “a dazzling pop fantasia ripe for rediscovery” —and the 4xCD 1997 box set Zombie Heaven provided a long overdue and illuminating career retrospective for the rest of the band’s output. In 2019, Varese Sarabande re-compiled their recordings into a 5xLP vinyl set, and the same company has now repackaged much of the same material as individual albums—their self-titled 1965 debut, 1966’s I Love You, and R.I.P., which was recorded by Argent and White in late 1968 and soon shelved. Those who already own Zombie Heaven or the vinyl set, or anyone seeking new information about the band or alternate takes, will be disappointed in these spartan, low-budget reissues, each of which has already been re-released as Record Store Day exclusives. Essential they are not, but they do offer an opportunity to re-approach one of the strangest trajectories in rock history: the singles-and-filler first album, the second LP sold only in Europe and Japan, and the unreleased final album, recorded mostly without the lead singer in the wake of the group’s dissolution. Together, they trace the arc of an incredibly talented group that was done a significant disservice by an industry that could’ve made them stars in their own time. The Zombies were formed in 1961 by Argent, who’d grown up listening to Stravinsky and Bartok before being bowled over by Elvis Presley and then jazz pianists Bill Evans and Jimmy Smith. Keen on the electric piano, Argent recruited some St. Albans pals—White, Blunstone, drummer Hugh Grundy, and guitarist Paul Atkinson—to start playing R&B covers at art schools and music halls around the city. Argent’s classical and jazz-informed piano approach instantly distinguished them, and Blunstone’s downy tenor—discovered during an early practice, when Argent pushed him to the front—proved the group’s secret weapon, capable of grinding out a cover of Ray Charles’ “What’d I Say,” then slipping into George Gershwin’s tranquil “Summertime.” In April 1964, the same month that the Beatles held down the top 5 spots on the Billboard Hot 100, the Zombies won a local songwriting competition, which led to a Decca contract and the opportunity to cut “Summertime” and three originals: White’s Beatles-influenced “You Make Me Feel Good” and rumbling surf-rocker “It’s Alright With Me,” and a new Argent-penned track called “She’s Not There.” The band considered “Summertime” for their lead single, but wisely settled on Argent’s composition as their public debut. George Harrison was an early fan, raving about “She’s Not There” on the British music show Juke Box Jury, and with good reason. Like the rest of the British Invasion groups, the Zombies started with the blues—Argent borrowed a key lyric from John Lee Hooker’s “No One Told Me”—but added several twists. First, there was Blunstone’s calm, Chet Baker-esque croon, which seemed to belie the anxieties of Argent’s lyrics: was a woman merely ghosting him, or might she actually be a ghost? As Argent winds his Hohner pianet through White’s deep bassline and Grundy’s stilted drumming, which reels toward a hard hit on the fourth beat of each measure like a detective drugged by an evasive suspect, “She’s Not There” dials in on the uncanny unknown. The pre-chorus shifts into major-key panic mode and Grundy locks into a 4/4, setting the stage for Blunstone to soar up to a high A for the shrieking, unresolved climax. Immediately, Decca sent the group off on a UK tour opening for Dionne Warwick, whose magnificent 1964 Bacharach/David collaboration inspired the band’s follow-up single, “Tell Her No.” Dialing back the dynamic extremes of “She’s Not There,” Argent created a song that brought rock ’n’ roll into dialogue with the moment’s most bewitching pop tunes: Warwick’s “Walk on By” and “A House Is Not A Home,” along with 1965’s Grammy-winning Record of the Year, “The Girl From Ipanema.” Blunstone’s vocal is at its most lustrous and vulnerable on “Tell Her No,” especially when he emerges out of the staccato chorus to coo, “Don’t hurt me now”—aimed not toward the woman of his dreams, but anyone else who might submit to her numinous charms. Few bands have ever started a career with as much out-of-the-box success—they were a rock band, first and foremost, but their skill with rueful, spooky melodrama suggested that they were destined for something much stranger. Decca packaged the two originals with their version of “Summertime” onto 1965’s The Zombies (issued as Begin Here in the UK, with a different tracklist), along with White’s “Alright,” a few lesser originals and a handful of covers. A good version of the Miracles’ live medley connecting “You Really Got a Hold on Me” to Sam Cooke’s “Bring It on Home to Me” is balanced out by serviceable takes on Muddy Waters’ “Got My Mojo Workin’” and Solomon Burke’s “Can’t Nobody Love You.” From the moment that “She’s Not There” hit #3 on Billboard, Decca shot the band out of a touring cannon, and they wouldn’t land for another two and a half years. When they weren’t recording sets for American music shows like “Hullabaloo” and “Shindig,” they were shlepping their own gear into and out of venues on city-to-city package tours like Dick Clark’s Caravan of Stars. They followed “Tell Her No” with four singles in 1965 alone, each of which peaked at a lower spot on the Hot 100 than its predecessor. The circular logic of the record business took over from there: Without a hit single, Decca wouldn’t foot the bill for album recording sessions. Perhaps because they assumed that the Zombies had outlived their profitability in the States, Decca released the 1966 singles and B-sides compilation I Love You only through the label’s Dutch and Japanese divisions. This is a shame, because I Love You actually holds together quite well as an album, and shows that the Zombies had grown significantly as songwriters and instrumentalists. It opens with the short, mostly a cappella “The Way I Feel Inside,” a lovely showcase for Blunstone’s maturing voice, which segues into the singer’s first self-penned recording, the lush and dreamy ballad “How We Were Before.” White was coming into his own as well: His “You Make Me Feel Good” and “Don’t Go Away” are no less intoxicating for their obvious Beatles influence—he even nods directly to John Lennon with a few languid “ohhhhh” phrasings on the former. The Motown-flavored rave-up “Is This the Dream” and “Whenever You’re Ready,” which contains a potent Blunstone vocal and Argent solo, fizzled commercially in the U.S., as did the buttoned-up garage rock of Argent’s “Indication,” which Argent ended with a quasi-psychedelic organ solo—a major no-no for Top 40 DJs with quick trigger fingers. Perhaps Argent was ready to hop aboard the psych-rock train, if given the chance—or maybe he and the band were finished trying to meet the market on its own terms. By mid 1967, the Zombies had come to realize just how much touring revenue they were losing to their management, and how little they’d been able to grow as recording artists by working with the same producer on every single. Finished with their Decca contract, Argent and White were eager to test their mettle in a heady new post-Revolver era, and they signed a one-off contract with CBS to record and produce Odessey and Oracle at Abbey Road. Argent and White’s songs were magnificent, but Blunstone had soured on the music business—Argent had to coax him through “Time of the Season” measure by measure—and when the band learned that the Odessey songs were nearly impossible to pull off live, they called it quits, playing their last show in December 1967. While Blunstone went back to hawking insurance, Grundy took a job at a car lot, and Atkinson started training to become a computer programmer, Argent and White formed their own production company and recruited a few other players—the core of what would become Argent—to join them in the studio. Sessions from mid-December 1968 yielded the final single billed to the Zombies, the stately White composition “Imagine the Swan.” Revealing the prog-rock bedrock underlying Odessey, “Swan” borrows the chord sequence from Bach’s “Well-Tempered Clavier” and the intricate harmonies of the Mamas and the Papas, topped with a mannered-yet-brassy Argent vocal that, in retrospect, sounds a lot like a young Freddie Mercury. Backed with the rococo instrumental “Conversation Off Floral Street,” the single hit the market and flopped. The Zombies were dead. Or were they? Fittingly for a band that seemed to haunt the rock establishment even while it was a going concern, Argent and White concocted a post-mortem Zombies LP titled R.I.P. that would not see the light of day for decades. During the same December sessions that produced the final Zombies single, they cut Argent’s jaunty “She Loves the Way They Love Her,” White’s flute-and-harpsichord-haunted “Smokey Day,” and Argent’s mid-tempo ballad “I Could Spend the Day,” with a stately ascending melody anticipating the sound of British arena prog. Along with the new recordings, the duo resurrected a handful of tracks from a few years earlier, adding vocal and string overdubs to Argent’s “If It Don’t Work Out” (given to Dusty Springfield in 1965) and White’s magnificent “I’ll Call You Mine,” perhaps the band’s most flawless pure pop single, which had been collecting dust on a studio shelf for more than two years. Toward the end of Side A came the band’s other great lost work, the gothic acoustic “Girl Help Me,” with a stuttering rhythm and perfectly arranged harmonies that suggested the band knew exactly how to build on the foundation of “She’s Not There” and “Tell Her No,” but never got the chance. While the newer recordings occupied Side A of R.I.P., the polished-up early tracks were saved for Side B, giving the album a strange Benjamin Button vibe—as you listened, the band aged backwards. By all accounts, R.I.P. was ready for retail, but Argent shelved it to focus on his new band, which released its first album in 1970. Cold comfort for sure, but R.I.P. is one of the era’s great lost albums. The Zombies got their official industry due in 2019, when the Bangles’ Susanna Hoffs inducted the band into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. The choice of Hoffs—who started out in L.A.’s Paisley Underground scene in the ’80s—was a commemoration of Odessey and Oracle’s impact on multiple generations of psychedelic pop bands. But such institutions are, by their very nature, bound to misrepresent careers like the Zombies’, focusing on the high points instead of the truth of a frustrating, mismanaged five-year existence. In their time and beyond, the Zombies are the rare Hall of Fame inductees who were viewed as a cult band for the majority of their time together.

Muddbruddas,SDBrian Fresco,by: Nathan Smith,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f2451ad453b397737e12c40/1:1/w_160/Muddbruddas_SD%20x%20Brian%20Fresco.jpg,2020-08-03 05:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/sd-brian-fresco-muddbruddas/,HIPvision,"For every national superstar born out of a regional rap scene, there are always dozens more MCs from that same community who fail to cross over. Brian Fresco & SD are not untalented, not entirely unsuccessful, but neither rapper has made it as far as some of their comrades from Chicago. Fresco came up earlier in the decade with the collective SaveMoney alongside members like Chance the Rapper & Vic Mensa, but he was soon eclipsed by their Kanye collaborations and Grammy nominations. SD was once counted among the most promising new stars of the city’s drill scene, a member of Chief Keef and Fredo Santana’s Glory Boyz Entertainment, but he maintained his independence and never really broke through because of it. Now, two rappers who never really got their due have come together to form a new tag-team partnership: the Muddbruddas. It might be an alliance of convenience or shared circumstances, but it’s one that works surprisingly well. Brian Fresco and SD’s mutually shared lack of commercial success, at least relative to their peers, isn’t out of any lack of skill or style on their part. In some alternate timeline, Brian Fresco has an exclusive deal with Apple and SD is a critical darling and cult favorite on the level of Keef. Fresco’s first impression of a mixtape, 2013’s Mafioso, dropped two weeks after Chance’s Acid Rap and included three separate features from The Rapper. On his debut, Fresco specialized in the same kind of soulful, slightly wonky sound that Chance cut his teeth on before becoming the rap game’s biggest wife guy. Like the rest of the SaveMoney collective’s releases, Fresco’s early work is relatively out of step with the rap movement his city was receiving the most acclaim for at that time; Mafioso is much more quiet storm than Chicago drill. So it’s fascinating to see him pair with an artist who embodies drill like few others; SD’s mid-decade releases are hallmarks of the subgenre. On mixtapes like Life of a Savage 3 and Truly Blessed, SD demonstrated that moshpit-ready ragers came as easily to him as melodic pop numbers—glittery ballads like “Big Things” and “Gossip” are still some of my favorite drill recordings. Muddbruddas isn’t really drill, but it’s not acid rap either. Fresco brings the soul, SD the pop mentality, and the result is lowkey party rap, laidback and effortless. The synths are bright and bouncy, and the bass is plentiful. On the one hand, Muddbruddas goes for a blatantly commercial sound, drafting many of the biggest producers in rap today—808 Mafia on “Duckin,” Pi’erre Bourne on “Aretha,” CashmoneyAP on “Teef Gold”—but on the other, it’s a hard sell as a commercial prospect, with not a feature to speak of, just 30 minutes of 808s and bars. The pair primarily operate as vocal foils to one another. On tracks like “Harley,” Fresco leans into his loose, sing-song flow that’s not too dissimilar from Chance, but SD’s presence pushes him into different flows, like “On It,” where he sounds much more frantic and leaned-forward in his voice, or “Pimp C,” on which he briefly shouts out and imitates the late Texas legend. SD’s flow has a grittier quality, not just in the gruffness of his voice but the pain it radiates—there’s a sadness to his voice that pushes against the overall jubilance of Muddbuddras, like on the more mournful “Bet On It.” When SD and Fresco meld their divergent sensibilities, the result approaches the sublime—“Bankroll” opens with SD spitting over a Clams Casino-type vocal loop courtesy of producer Mondamade da Beat, before an utterly triumphant horn hits and Brian Fresco takes charge for the chorus. Fresco & SD have patterned themselves in the image of classic rap duos—the cover art pays homage to Clipse, and “Pimp C” is obviously something of a tribute to UGK. Though the result may not be as groundbreaking as either of those groups, by coming together as part of a tacit alliance, both members of Muddbruddas have proved their viability as artists outside their brief moment in the sun during rap’s blog years. Their project is a valuable reminder that every rap scene is so much more than its most successful stars. Catch up every Saturday with 10 of our best-reviewed albums of the week.

Knock Knock,Smog,by: Philip Sherburne,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f219660fd2322c601fed2c6/1:1/w_160/knock%20knock_smog.jpg,2020-08-02 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/smog-knock-knock/,Drag City,"The small South Carolina town of Prosperity, pop. 1173, didn’t necessarily seem touched by God’s good grace. It was a strange place for a musician with a growing international following to wind up, but then, Bill Callahan had bounced between a lot of strange places. Born in 1966 in Silver Spring, Maryland, and having spent part of his childhood in the North of England, where his parents did some kind of clandestine work for the NSA, he’d shuffled from city to city—Sacramento, California; Buford, Georgia; Dover, New Hampshire—rarely sticking around for long. Noncommitment came naturally: A three-time college drop-out, he’d picked up the guitar as a teen, given it up out of frustration, and then tried again. By 1997, when he landed in Prosperity, it seemed like the only reason he came was to find a reason to leave. By this point in his career, Callahan had built a tidy little reputation as Smog. Beginning in the late ’80s, he had put out a handful of self-released tapes on his own Disaster Records, named after one of his zines; by 1992 he’d graduated to Drag City, a fledgling Chicago label cultivating a roster of acts like Pavement, Royal Trux, and Silver Jews—bands that took the willful ethos of American underground rock and flipped it into stubborn high art, scruffy and proudly nonconforming. Not exactly an outsider but definitely not an insider, he occupied a liminal space—making out-of-the-way sounds in out-of-the-way places, forever trailing rock music’s dominant strains the way a decommissioned highway shadows a six-lane interstate. Callahan had grown up with a transistor radio pressed to his ear at night, listening first to soft-rock AM stations and then the hardcore punk he discovered at the far left of the dial, and it showed: His taste for low volumes had been tempered by the former, and his fondness for scabrous textures forged in the fires of the latter. In the beginning, Smog’s music fit the moniker: gray, formless, acrid. When Callahan played guitar, he might have been attempting to decipher hidden messages from moldy John Lee Hooker records. But over time, the outline of an actual songwriter started poking through the haze of busted stompboxes, pause-button edits, and Dadaistic pranks. On albums like 1995’s Wild Love and the following year’s The Doctor Came at Dawn, the guitar tone became cleaner, the stereo field more uncluttered, the words darker and more biting. “I’m gonna be drunk, so drunk at your wedding,” he taunted in one song; in another, he sighed, “Maybe you should have a drink/I don’t know why you ever stopped anyway.” He could channel real ugliness, speaking the language of ne’er-do-wells and abusers, but the tenderness in his music could be as unexpected as the bile. In “To Be of Use,” he admitted in a sad, honeyed voice, “Most of my fantasies are of/Making someone else come.” As masculine myths of young adulthood go, it was the oldest story in the book: the class clown with a curdled heart, just waiting to be made whole. Callahan’s lyrics gradually grew from post-adolescent expressions of garden-variety self-loathing into something far more unusual and often more ominous, in the sense that they seemed wrapped around actual omens—magic phrases throbbing with eerie portent. He sang of blood-red birds, a headstone on a wharf, a widow’s ghost driving a horse cart full of apples. Often, an object or a turn of phrase would keep turning up across the course of a record, like a bad penny. These imagistic verses felt like fragments of something essential and enduring, splinters of the Old Weird America that had burrowed under Callahan’s skin and burst into strange, spindly blossoms. Callahan had come to Prosperity in 1997 to live with Chan Marshall, better known as Cat Power. The two of them were shacked up in an eight-room farmhouse next to a used-car lot, surrounded by green fields and old machines gone to rust; the rent was $425 a month. Callahan was fresh off the Jim O’Rourke-produced Red Apple Falls, an expansive breakthrough in his catalog. Marshall, to hear her tell it, had given up music for good, despite having a string of sublime and unsettling records under her own belt. But at some point in their cohabitation, things went south; Callahan drove north. He’d later say that he wrote an album’s worth of material on the drive from Prosperity to Chicago, sitting behind the wheel of his Dodge van, staring into the middle distance. Those songs would become Knock Knock, his ninth full-length as Smog, and his sixth for Drag City. Knock Knock anticipates the openness of Callahan’s later albums, particularly the ones under his own name. The languid Red Apple Falls was a head record, a pastoral daydream of piano laments and pedal steel, flecked with French horn and fingerpicked acoustic guitar; Knock Knock is a road record, smooth as worn asphalt—a record about motion, distance, flying blind. Where before his gaze had often been fixed on lovers, exes, or his own scowl in the mirror, here he looks outward, at the world, as well as more reflexively, even beatifically, inside himself. If Red Apple Falls was a misfit’s badge of honor, Knock Knock is an unburdening, a breakup album about discovering new ways of being in the world. Again, Callahan recorded with Jim O’Rourke; this time they spent 10 days in the studio, twice what Red Apple Falls had taken them. Drummer Thymme Jones, a Chicago fixture who had played on the previous album, returned for the new one, joined by Vandermark Five drummer Tim Mulvenna. Plush’s Liam Hayes, a session player on numerous Will Oldham records, handled guitar on some songs, while the prolific post-rock guitarist Loren Mazzacane Connors took top billing in the credits. (The lyric sheet doesn’t specify who played on what.) To record with a full band was exhilarating, Callahan would recall: “It’s a different energy when you have three or four people playing. Knock Knock was intoxicated with that feeling. I was taking some of the responsibility off my back, and having more fun.” It didn’t hurt that O’Rourke, who also contributed guitar, bass, and piano, actually liked Callahan’s music, and was creatively invested in a way that previous studio engineers—like the one who methodically worked his way through a six-pack during recording, barely acknowledging Callahan’s presence—had not always been. Accordingly, Knock Knock often sounds bigger and more ample than its predecessor. O’Rourke kept his experimental tendencies in check, ceding the spotlight to Callahan’s voice—warmer and fuller than it had ever been recorded before, a reluctant river of feeling lit by purple dusk—and rounding it out with gentle strokes of cello, Velvets-style motorik chug, and classic-rock choogle. The album could hardly be described as minimalist, but it is economical to the extreme; no song admits anything beyond the bare necessities required to express itself. The one indulgence they permitted themselves, in addition to a string quartet, is a children’s choir that turns up on a couple of songs, lending the grim “No Dancing” and the determined “Hit the Ground Running” an air somewhere between Pink Floyd’s “Another Brick in the Wall” and a camp-town revival meeting. Callahan called Knock Knock his album for teenagers, though it’s hard to know how seriously he meant it; this was the era when he still preferred to conduct interviews by fax, and journalists often came away grumbling that they’d been made fools of. (In truth, his answers were simply smarter than the vast majority of their questions.) He told interviewers that the record cover—with its jagged lightning bolt and peevish-looking wildcat—was meant to represent objects that young folks like. “Some of the themes are things I associate with teenage years—having big plans, thinking you can live like a gypsy,” he told the Chicago Reader. “There’s a lot about moving and traveling on the record. Most adults let that die.” Even the hand-drawn text on the sleeve had a vaguely heavy-metal shape, like a band logo a kid might scrawl on his Trapper Keeper. No stranger to classic rock, Callahan had previously sampled the Rolling Stones’ “Honky Tonk Women” and referenced AC/DC’s “Highway to Hell.” This time, he said, he wanted to make anthems, and he did. “Held” is an incandescent swamp rocker. Palm-muted guitars give “No Dancing” the feel of something you might have heard emanating from pickup trucks doing donuts in parking lots, the weeds littered with empties. “Hit the Ground Running” is a straight-ahead mid-tempo Southern rocker, wrapping an inspirational chorus about fleeing the country for the open road around a far bleaker frame: “Bitterness is a lowest sin/A bitter man rots from within/I’ve seen his smile, yellow and brown/The bitterness has brought him down.” Its finale, complete with perkily ascending strings and that jubilant children’s choir, is an infallible day-brightener. These riff-heavy songs gave Knock Knock a quality that people weren’t used to hearing from Smog albums: It sounded fun. That was especially true of “Cold Blooded Old Times,” a highlight on a record that hardly wants for stellar songs. Like Callahan’s best work, “Cold Blooded Old Times” is sneaky, smuggling the evil that men do inside a deceptively appealing, practically quaint frame. Picking up the ’60s-flavored skip and shuffle of Red Apple Falls’ “Ex-Con,” it sounds at first almost peppy, a straight-up dance number complete with an irresistible, indelible chorus. (That catchiness carried it all the way to 2000’s High Fidelity soundtrack, where it featured alongside songs from the Kinks, the Velvet Underground, Elvis Costello, and Bob Dylan.) But listen past the strumming and the handclaps, and a darker picture emerges: It’s a story of abuse, of a father—whether the song’s subject’s, or someone else’s, it’s not clear—who beat his wife, terrified his children, and possibly carried out even more unspeakable acts. It is a chilling song wrapped in a cozy sweater of a chord change, with one of the all-time great lines in Callahan’s oeuvre: “Cold blooded old times/The type of memories/That turn your bones to glass.” It’s an image so vivid, so tactile, it seems almost like something you could hold in your hand—a small, glinting monument to cruelty and shame. These uptempo tracks, even when they hid ugly secrets, were a punchy riposte to the many critics, especially in the UK, who seemed to find Callahan an incorrigible downer. One descriptor had followed him across the broad stretch of the 1990s: “miserable.” The word often took the form of “miserabilist,” an odd back-formation, kin to “ventriloquist” or “illusionist,” suggesting a person uncommonly skilled in the art of despair. And, OK, sometimes that characterization was actually kind of true. But on Knock Knock, even the slowest, softest tunes pulsed with life. Just consider “Teenage Spaceship,” a wistful song loosely based on Callahan’s adolescent habit of wandering his neighborhood in the small hours, when everyone was in bed but him. Imagining himself as a flying saucer, he describes flying around the houses at night, remote and alone, untouchable; “Landing at night/I was beautiful with all my lights,” he sings, his voice dropping down to gravel, drawing out “lights” into two exquisite syllables. The song’s four hushed, reverent minutes are full of possible meaning. “I was a teenage smog/Sewn to the sky” calls back to one of Smog’s first albums; it also anticipates, however unknowingly, the day that Callahan would eventually abandon the alias in favor of his own name, against the protestations of his label. (“The word ‘Smog’ meant nothing to me—just like symbols on a slot machine, like a cherry or a horseshoe,” he would later say. “I realized that’s what I was broadcasting, that’s the face I was giving to people.”) Hovering eerily between his past and his future, “Teenage Spaceship”—one of the gentlest, most beautiful songs in his entire catalog—comes to appear like a beacon that cuts through time and space. As would become standard procedure on many of Callahan’s albums, both as Smog and under his own name, Knock Knock’s 10 songs fit into a loose narrative arc. He had experimented with recurring themes on Red Apple Falls, but this was something new: an implicit story, with a beginning, middle, and end. “Let’s Move to the Country,” the opening song, sketches the broad outline of the tale: A wandering man is ready to settle down. Over skeletal, clean-toned guitar and an ostinato cello pulse, the song’s protagonist lays all his cards out on the table: Let’s move to the country
Just you and me
My travels are over
My travels are through
Let’s move to the country
Just me and you For a while, it’s smooth sailing. There are songs about finding security (“Held”), about confronting anxiety (“No Dancing”), about solitude (“Teenage Spaceship”). The circle closes with the album’s final, three-song stretch. By “Hit the Ground Running,” Callahan—or at least, the Callahan of the song—is behind the wheel, crossing state lines like they were sidewalk cracks. “I Could Drive Forever” is the hushed yin to “Hit the Ground Running”’s ebullient yang: a measured rumination on regret, a fuzzy dream of an infinitely receding horizon. “I should have left a long time ago/The best idea I ever had,” he sings, his voice strengthening against a watery tremolo backdrop. Weary and resigned, “Left Only With Love” wraps up the album with a farewell to the person that he has left behind, a soft expression of regret. Callahan’s unsteady voice is nearly naked but for threadbare guitar strings and velvety reverb. It is the mirror opposite of the opening song’s boundless optimism. Of course, these songs are never simply “about” their subject or their themes, much less dependent upon the particulars of Callahan’s own existence, however much a given lyric might have been rooted in something he lived. The joy of them is in their fabric, the warp and weft of truth and lies. In moments both loud and quiet, Knock Knock feels luminous, phantasmal, hovering three feet off the ground—a thing not quite of this world. How could anyone pin such a creation on something as unremarkable as one man’s quotidian existence? “Autobiography is not something I’m interested in,” Callahan told a blogger in 2001. He reiterated to The Independent, “I try to keep myself out of it as much as possible.” Nearly a decade later, he was still shooting down questions about the veracity of his songs, sometimes to the point of annoyance. “It really has to be that either everything is autobiography or nothing is autobiography, with nothing in between,” he told The Quietus in 2010. “That's the only way to deal with this age-old question of which I am, pardon my French, not remotely interested in.” That same query just kept coming, until finally he relaxed into something resembling a zen mindstate. “It’s music,” he told City Pages, as though such a thing might not be obvious. “It’s a creation. They’re songs. Songs are about music. They’re musicbiographical.” One of my favorite songs on the album is the one most difficult to interpret, at least within a biographical framework. On the surface, “River Guard” is about a prison guard who takes his prisoners to a swimming hole. The mood is contemplative, daydreamy. He sits in the grass, watches them floating on their backs, then looks away. Is he toying with the idea of letting them escape? When he hauls them back in, he tells us, “They always say/Our sentences will not be served/We are constantly on trial/It’s a way to be free.” It’s a cryptic line, and a good one, good enough for him to repeat the final couplet again at the song’s end. I don’t know what it’s supposed to mean, honestly. But particularly in the context of later songs like “The Well” and “Writing,” where Callahan takes evident pleasure in grappling with the creative process itself, I wonder if it isn’t in some way about the act of interpretation. Perhaps the prisoners are his songs. “We are constantly on trial,” they say. “It’s a way to be free.” The lifeblood of a song depends on deferring final judgment, making sure the gavel never falls. There’s another lyric on the album I come back to a lot. It’s in “Held,”  a song about contentment, trust, the security of being held “like a big old baby.” There’s a lot going on in its 15 slim lines, including a blanket of ants and a jet plane exploding in the sky. But at the song’s climax, Callahan marvels, rapturously, “For the first time in my life/I am moving away moving away moving away/From within the reach of me.” Nearly two decades later, Callahan would admit that these were not his best years. “I was kind of a little putz,” he said. “Inchoate. Wandering. I didn’t know how to be honest with myself and others, for the most part. Or at least there were certain personalities I couldn’t deal with in a healthy, self-preserving way. You can slip through the cracks and have a lot of adventures for a long time and when you get older you wonder if that was good for you, necessary, or a waste.” Whatever else “Held” might be about, it sounds like a song about growing up, or at least trying to—shedding dead skin, escaping his worst tendencies, even if just for a spell. Callahan wasn’t leaving Prosperity in order to find himself; quite the opposite. The whole album was a disappearing act. Callahan, the man, had dissipated, like a blanket of smog scattered by the north wind. What was left—what is left—were these songs: a testament to the endurance of the work, and the irrelevance and impermanence of all other concerns. Get the Sunday Review in your inbox every weekend.

Flaming Pie,Paul McCartney,by: Stephen Thomas Erlewine,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f218f4797c3394bd8286d10/1:1/w_160/flaming%20pie_paul%20mccartney.jpg,2020-08-01 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/paul-mccartney-flaming-pie/,Capitol,"Flaming Pie, Paul McCartney’s 10th solo album, arrived at the tail end of the Beatles’ mid-’90s renaissance. The remaining Fab Four members instigated this revival with the release of their long-gestating documentary The Long And Winding Road, which was given the generic title Anthology by the time it ballooned into a multi-media retrospective in 1995. Due to a stroke of luck, the release of the documentary and its accompanying rarities compilations coincided with the rise of Britpop. The time was ripe for McCartney to deliver an album steeped in Beatles lore, and that’s exactly what he claimed Flaming Pie was. Upon its release in May 1997, McCartney maintained that his immersion in the Beatles’ past inspired him to up his game, to make an album in the vein of his old band. Even its title was a nod to an arcane bit of Fab Four lore, derived from Lennon’s claim that he had a vision of a man on a flaming pie declaring that his band would henceforth be known as ”Beatles with an ’a’.” It was a canny marketing method, a tacit acknowledgment that perhaps his recent albums weren’t quite up to snuff while also snagging listeners whose interest in the Beatles may have been rejuvenated thanks to Anthology and the new breed of Britpoppers. It also was a bit deceptive. Flaming Pie sounds as similar to the Beatles as Oasis, which is to say not much at all; it’s recognizably in the same melodic vein, but all the production frills don’t recall Sgt. Pepper’s and the tone of the album is decidedly reflective, suiting a man taking stock of his life upon the cusp of his 55th birthday. Back in 1997, this wistful undercurrent was criticized as solipsistic—in the original review for Rolling Stone, Anthony DeCurtis dismissed the album opener “The Song We Were Singing” as a self-congratulatory “boomer reminiscence”—but a dive into the rarities-laden Archive Edition of Flaming Pie reveals that the album represented the end of an era as well as a creative rebirth. According to McCartney, he was told he could not release his solo album while the Anthology rollout was underway, so he kept tinkering with the songs that would comprise Flaming Pie while working on other projects—Standing Stone, his second long-form classical piece, for example, and a fairly tedious 1996 single called “The Ballad of the Skeletons” in which he jammed with avant-garde icons Lenny Kaye, Philip Glass, and Marc Ribot. Elsewhere, he sat for the interviews that formed the heart of Barry Miles’ authorized 1997 biography Many Years From Now and spent a chunk of 1995 living out his DJ fantasies via the Westwood One radio show Oobu Joobu, whose 15 episodes were condensed and edited into six B-sides for various Flaming Pie singles. He tagged along with his wife Linda whenever she promoted her line of vegetarian meals and cookbooks, sometimes stealing away to write a new song. All of this activity fed into Flaming Pie, whose origins are more piecemeal than the finished project suggests. Trawling through his back pages led to pulling two songs from his archives: the melodramatic pomp of “Beautiful Night,” which he attempted with Billy Joel’s band in 1986, and ""Great Day,"" which dated all the way back to the early ’70s, sharing a partial melody with “Big Barn Bed” from Red Rose Speedway. A couple of loose blues rockers cut with his old friend Steve Miller back in 1995 (“If You Wanna,” “Used To Be Bad”) were short-listed along with a pair of unreleased George Martin-produced outtakes from 1992 (“Calico Skies,” “Great Day”) and then he enlisted the services of Jeff Lynne, the Electric Light Orchestra leader who shepherded the two “Threetles” Beatles reunion tracks for Anthology. After the first solo session with Lynne, the McCartneys received bad news: Linda had breast cancer. Paul decided to carry on and complete the album because “the thing about those moments in life is, there’s no option but to get on with it, ‘cause the other option would be to just lie down and go to sleep, which isn’t an option. So you’ve just got to get on with it, you’ve got to do things, you’ve got to go to the doctors, keep the thing going, keep running the shop. You get on with it, and this is me getting on with it.” He wound up writing two songs after Linda’s diagnosis, neither of which are heavy with grief. “Really Love You” grew out of a funky jam with Ringo Starr, and “Heaven on a Sunday,” a lazy slice of jazzy yacht-rock, only hints at his love for Linda through its refrain “If I only had one love, yours would be the one I choose.” Comparatively, the delicate finger-picked “Calico Skies” and “Little Willow” are infused with a sense of loss and mourning, floating along upon a bittersweet breeze that neatly complements the sepia-toned reflections of “The Song We Were Singing” and “Somedays.” These sweetly sad songs are the ones that linger, and they’re served well by their earliest incarnations as home recordings and demos that serve as bonus tracks on both the double-disc reissue and companion 5-CD/2-DVD edition. As nice as it is to hear these hushed, unadorned rough versions, McCartney feels most comfortable when he’s crafting an entertainment, which Flaming Pie certainly is. Maybe they don’t sound like the Beatles, but with their stainless steel gleam, ""The World Tonight” and “Young Boy” were ornate singles designed to grab attention whether heard on VH1, adult contemporary radio, or the soundtrack to the forgettable Robin Williams & Billy Crystal comedy Fathers’ Day. The casual but tangible chemistry between McCartney and Miller may be in service of featherweight compositions, but they made the final cut instead of the more interesting throwaways “Broomstick” and “Looking For You”—B-sides both, presented and accounted for on the reissue—because the easy-rolling guitar duels offer some welcome air among the album’s heavier numbers. Individually, they feel thin, but they help make an album that captures multiple sides of McCartney’s personality, a record where his craft, silliness, sentiment, and charm are in balance. Maybe McCartney achieved that delicate equilibrium on Flaming Pie because he was indeed ""getting on with it,"" coming to terms with his wife’s illness by making an album that celebrated those he held dearest. He’d continue to play with Ringo for many, many more years, and he’d work with longtime engineer Geoff Emerick a while longer, but Flaming Pie would be the last time Linda sang on one of his records, the last time George Martin wrote him an orchestration. It was also the first time he found space for his son James on a record, giving him the guitar solo on “Heaven on a Sunday,” a gesture that gained poignancy over the years. Most importantly, Flaming Pie gave McCartney his first US Top 10 album in 15 years, giving him the confidence to try newer and weirder things as he headed into the new century. Some of these albums were good, some were bad, but none of them had the same heart as Flaming Pie. It may have its flaws, but it’s one of the rare McCartney albums where he grapples with emotions too big to neatly fit inside the confines of a pop record.

Made of Rain,The Psychedelic Furs,by: Alfred Soto,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f2193dd8fd5732600c3453e/1:1/w_160/made%20of%20rain_psychedelic%20furs.jpg,2020-08-01 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/the-psychedelic-furs-made-of-rain/,Cooking Vinyl,"No performer in rock made bad faith as romantic as Richard Butler did. In the first incarnation of the Psychedelic Furs, the British singer issued pronouncements and put-downs with laryngeal splendor; the band matched him with a mighty saxophone-and-guitar racket like a foghorn raising clouds of toxic fumes from dirty carpets. Serious about being a dickhead, Butler constructed scenarios in which he maneuvers himself into the position of being rejected so he can claim the poor girl was wrong to have given him a chance anyway—that’s sort of the point to “Pretty in Pink,” an unflattering character sketch, ostensibly about a girl named Caroline, that’s really about Richard, “the last to remember her name.” In the most delightful of surprises, Made of Rain, the Psychedelic Furs’ first new album in 29 years, ranks just a notch or two below post-punk classics like 1981’s Talk Talk Talk and 1982’s Forever Now. Expect no mummified mirror moves, though. Coming to terms with legacy acts often means pining for sequels. But in response to the question “What do the Psychedelic Furs mean in 2020?” the answer is simply, “Loud band with sardonic front man,” neither of which is in abundance in contemporary rock. Paul Garisto’s assured drumming and Mars Williams’ astutely deployed sax bleats are pleasures in themselves; thanks to former Love Spit Love colleague Richard Fortus’ robust mix, each instrument occupies a distinct space while still meshing into that familiar wall of sound. There’s some goop that wouldn’t have embarrassed the sodden Furs of 1986’s Midnight to Midnight (“Stars,” ick), but the goop sticks. Butler and bassist brother Tim can still write hooks, and Richard can still clear a room with rancid quips: “When I said I loved you and I lied/I never really loved you, I was laughing all the time,” he sneers in “Come All Ye Faithful.” Exploiting Gen X memories and good will in the service of a futurist aesthetic that once hoped to “let it stay forever now,” the Psychedelic Furs have pulled off a neat dialectical trick. They included no “Pretty in Pink”s or “She Is Mine”s, and the album’s better for it. The thunderous Made of Rain opener “The Boy Who Invented Rock & Roll” features Williams’ sax imitating the cawing of crows and Rich Good panning his guitar speaker to speaker while Butler self-mythologizes like Bette Davis as Margo Channing in All About Eve. The Furs excel at rummaging through trunkfuls of abandoned poses: Amanda Kramer’s keyboards channel “Venus in Furs” on “You’ll Be Mine,” and the full band produces a convincing imitation of Wish-era Cure in “No-One,” an observation that would surely pain Butler. The slippage into a narrative confessional mode is an uneasy fit on “Wrong Train,” but it’s worth sticking around for the sad-sack manner in which he notes he’s got a wife who hates him—and so does her boyfriend. But here’s the thing: Cynics are sentimentalists, embittered because the world doesn’t follow the schemas in their heads. In the Furs’ warmest songs, Butler acknowledged how “knee-jerk negativity/Just never got me through.” Angling for an American breakthrough encouraged the Furs into glossier expressions of romantic interest, but the tension between the pristine synth patches and the hairballs Butler insisted on singing through kept audiences unsettled—and limited the Furs’ crossover chances to the top 30 placing of “Heartbreak Beat” a little over two years before the Cure and Depeche Mode went platinum. Free of such considerations, Made of Rain includes some of their most insistent love songs. On “Don’t Believe,” Butler gets entangled in a thicket of paradoxes and double negatives, determined not to look a fool when pledging his troth: “Everything I never said/Comes crashing on my tiny head.” Unburdened by nostalgia, accepting the world as is while avoiding complacency, Made of Rain isn’t a comeback—it’s a new road.

A Hero's Death,Fontaines D.C.,by: Elizabeth Nelson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f209f27a7f7291fa4a59566/1:1/w_160/a%20hero's%20death_fontaines%20dc.jpg,2020-07-31 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/fontaines-dc-a-heros-death/,Partisan,"The Horsemen of the Apocalypse do not thunder and gallop. They lurch and stagger, weighed down by the grim burden of their brief. Slowly, they stalk humanity with an Amazon Prime package of grief, war, and pestilence, their approach suggested only by the mechanized drone of social media and cable news. When the end finally comes, it’s all so quotidian and tedious; a whimper, not a bang. All around us, the party is ending, and Fontaines D.C. are the final house band. The setlist is A Hero’s Death. Slinking seeming fully-formed from Dublin’s working-class neighborhood The Liberties, the five-piece established themselves as bona fide inheritors of a centuries-long socialist-bohemian tradition on 2019’s post-post-punk document Dogrel, an album that weaved together the enduring groove of Gang of Four and the psychically dislocating poetry of Allen Ginsberg with unnervingly precocious aplomb. Dogrel was a shouty revelation—part early Mekons, part cider-addled James Brown & the JB’s—all of it suggestive of a crucial talent abuzz with live-wire intensity. The jet-black comedy of their follow-up A Hero’s Death does nothing to detract from this view, instead geometrically expanding their cantankerous field of vision. Heady, funny, and fearless, A Hero’s Death is a maudlin and manic triumph, a horror movie shot as comedy, equal parts future-shocked and handcuffed to history. Memorable tunes and unforgettable phrases erupt like brush fire over the course of 47 minutes, the mood migrating at a moment’s notice from insouciant nihilism to full-blown rage to radical empathy. As one does these days. “I Don’t Belong” is all lurking Daydream Nation-menace and nightmare groove, with lead singer Grian Chatten’s haunted incantation, “I don’t belong to anyone,” taking on multiple possible meanings over the song’s slow burn. “A Lucid Dream” steams by like a demented locomotive driven by punk-blues of the Gun Club, while “Televised Mind” turns the Stooges’ “TV Eye” inward, making manifest PiL’s prophecy of a narcotized zombie culture, too dazed and confused by the endless wave of corporate-tech idiotica to raise its voice above a monotone. As a band, Fontaines D.C. are as forceful as they are versatile, with drummer Tom Coll proving equally adept at holding down the esoteric art-rock feel “Love Is the Main Thing” and the straight-as-string Velvet Underground homage of “I Was Not Born.” Guitarists Conor Curley and Carlos O’Connell harmonize and deconstruct in a more than credible echo of Television’s Richard Lloyd and Tom Verlaine. On the terrific, bummer-hang ballad “Oh Such a Spring,” which crops up halfway through the record, the group arrives at a state of beautiful brokenness. But the heart of A Hero’s Death lies in stiff-upper-lip rockers like the title track, whose unnervingly catchy funeral-glam is rendered all the more frightening for its sprightliness, sounding a bit like “Ballroom Blitz” following the aversion therapy from A Clockwork Orange. “Life ain’t always empty!” Chatten stipulates with a clergy-barker certitude, and proceeds along with catchy-sounding corporate affirmations like, “Sit beneath a light that suits ya/And look forward to a better future.” It’s the Stones’ “Satisfaction” in reverse. No longer is the consumer unhappy with the product. It’s the product that is dissatisfied with you. And then there is the final track, “No,” a big ballad, a perfect culminating statement, a pensive progression, when the Fontaines backburner their well-honed bitterness in the service of a larger question: Is a fight we’ve probably already lost still worth the fighting? When Chatten sings: “Please don’t lock yourself away/Just appreciate the grey,” the group’s half-measures optimism feels like a benediction. We get knocked down and then maybe, just maybe, we get up again. Catch up every Saturday with 10 of our best-reviewed albums of the week.

Sucker’s Lunch,Madeline Kenney,by: Grayson Haver Currin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f1f4dadd421092dd8f6c8da/1:1/w_160/sucker's%20lunch_madeline%20kenney.jpg,2020-07-31 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/madeline-kenney-suckers-lunch/,Carpark,"For three albums, Madeline Kenney has poignantly and often playfully articulated the absurdities of modern adulthood. On her 2017 debut, the Toro y Moi-produced Night Night at First Landing, the Oakland baker, dancer, and singer-songwriter with the neuroscience degree sang post-grad mantras for herself, mid-20s reminders that tough times were inevitable but endurable. She got specific on 2018’s Perfect Shapes, reckoning with the burdensome workload of a creative class underfunded by a gig economy and the suspicion that existence itself is a deleterious process. And now, nearing 30 on Sucker’s Lunch, Kenney asks herself for permission to fall in love, or to reckon with a past of self-doubt and a present of intense uncertainty in order to shape something like a satisfying future. Kenney seems to have found both a mentor and friend in Jenn Wasner, the Wye Oak and Flock of Dimes linchpin who produced Perfect Shapes. Their rapport shaped that album’s sense of discovery, illustrated by a crosswalk sample that became an unlikely and compulsory hook. For Sucker’s Lunch, though, Kenney worked not only with Wasner and a cast of her own past collaborators but also with Andy Stack, the other multi-instrumentalist half of Wye Oak. Aside from Wye Oak’s own records, it’s the first album the pair have produced together. They lend Kenney a righteous heft here, their experience fortifying songs that, in the past, might have felt wispy. It’s tempting to hear Sucker’s Lunch as another extension of Wye Oak, a full-length collaboration with a novel singer rather than a joint production. Many of their chief hallmarks are here—the way the harmonies and keys pirouette over lumbering drums during “Sugar Sweat,” the emphatic rhythmic punctuation that ends “Tell You Everything,” the euphoric and arcing repetition of “Double Hearted.” If you landed on that last song without checking the title or the credits, you might assume Kenney is simply a Wye Oak acolyte—or that the band itself sounds different this time around. But Sucker’s Lunch inverts Wye Oak’s general approach. Where Wye Oak’s songs often seem purposefully resilient, designed like body armor meant to safeguard the feelings they ferry, these 10 songs wear their feelings on the skin. The sighing organs and yearning guitars of “Jenny”  perfectly capture the bittersweet sting of remembering your past and hoping for a better future. Likewise, the surging and glorious “White Window Light” captures the uneasy excitement of committing to new love even if it might backfire, of “jumping in the water without plans.” Despite all its lyrical prevarication, there’s a newfound directness to much of Sucker’s Lunch, a definitive step beyond the self-aware cleverness of Kenney’s earlier records. “Sucker,” for instance, surveys our modern malaise with prismatic snapshots of political fractures, mental fatigue, and endless worry. The band renders a wonderfully blue country shuffle beneath them, with luminous guitar harmonies that suggest Nels Cline and drums that feel like slumped shoulders. Kurt Wagner—for almost 30 years, the maestro of Lambchop’s own exquisite moodiness—deadpans the verses alongside Kenney, offering a cross-generational reminder that exasperation is a preexisting condition. And “Be That Man” springs from a gothic country creak into big, open-hearted rock, its chorus a perfect nugget of would-be AM Gold that needs no complications. Such transmutation is the enduring lesson of Kenney’s small catalogue so far: Turn life’s impasses into empathetic rock songs, little anthems for overcoming self-renewing heartache and exhaustion and anxiety. On Sucker’s Lunch, Kenney gets closer to the core of that idea than ever before thanks to sharper writing, stronger hooks, a versatile voice, and a continued partnership with friends who allow her to try new approaches. These are the results, it would seem, of growing up—the same complicated process that gave Kenney the grist for these 10 songs about figuring out what’s next.

KIND,Thanya Iyer,by: Nina Corcoran,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f2317cf0b8424123ec304fa/1:1/w_160/kind_thana%20iyer.jpg,2020-07-31 05:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/thana-iyer-kind/,Topshelf,"On KIND, Thanya Iyer’s second album, she asks listeners to question who, exactly, is nurtured by our current cultural notion of togetherness and who is left out. The Montreal-based singer-songwriter and violinist has spent the past few years exploring the intersection of baroque pop and improvisational jazz, and her music often feels like an invitation to a discussion, specifically one that calls for honest reflection and careful analysis. With KIND, Iyer transforms her songs from individual sentiments into a fluid conversation, utilizing her voice as a guide to face the unknown. Alternating her violin parts between spritely pizzicato and languorous fermatas, Iyer stacks harmonies to create the sensation of flurrying sounds. She and her bandmates—bassist Alex Kasirer-Smibert and drummer Daniel Gélinas—are periodically joined by brass players, flautists, harpists, and a choir, who float in and out of focus. The combination turns KIND into a lucid daydream that’s constantly melting at its edges. Above it all is Iyer, crooning just above a whisper with a powerful voice that sometimes recalls a blend of My Brightest Diamond’s Shara Nova and Kadhja Bonet. At a glance, song titles like “I Forgot to Drink Water (Balance)” and “Bring Back That Which Is Kind to You” suggest the kind of self-care advice found on pastel-hued influencer blogs. But while Iyer’s overall message is optimistic and simplistic, her intentionally open-ended lyrics allow her to chronicle a journey that grapples with racism, disability, grief, self-love, and depression, among other subjects, through the richness of the music itself. After opening with an invocation of rebirth post-loss, KIND shifts into a more determined mindset. Its narrator is faced with a choice between creating change immediately, or waiting for someone else to do so later. They opt for self-made change, of course. It isn’t immediate or pretty, and each song recounts stumbling and uncertainty, yet Iyer sows it with motivation: “Looks up to the light will find me lost in layers/Light will guide me.” In the early 2010s, the definition of baroque pop took on a new meaning. Black and Brown artists began to elevate the genre as an experimental art form, with musicians like Moses Sumney and Sudan Archives pushing the boundaries of orchestral folk and classical instrumentation. Iyer does the same, and her ear for texture and landscape is consistently noteworthy. In “Always, Be Together,” she dots verses with raindrop-like synth notes and cut-off piano runs that make an otherwise straightforward looped rhythm feel like the portal to an alternate earth. Moments like these weave throughout KIND, without wasting space or adding flair for its own sake. This may only be her second album, but Iyer’s patience, thoughtfulness, and commitment to communal growth stands out. Catch up every Saturday with 10 of our best-reviewed albums of the week.

Miles: From an Interlude Called Life,Blu & Exile,by: Sheldon Pearce,Contributing Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f1070cacf63693816048693/1:1/w_160/Blu-Exile-Miles.jpg,2020-07-30 05:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/blu-and-exile-miles-from-an-interlude-called-life/,Dirty Science,"Despite some initial drama—a botched release, a shuttered label—Blu & Exile’s 2007 album Below the Heavens quickly became a cult classic. Years later, it was hailed as a “magic album” and a tectonic shift that changed West Coast rap. The Los Angeles backpack rapper and Dirty Science producer have each had their own successes since, but they’ve never quite been able to escape the shadow of their massive collaborative achievement. The follow-up, Give Me My Flowers While I Can Still Smell Them, was delayed five years, its name hinted at looming fatigue, and it sought to replicate the BtH palette outright. In the eight years that followed they continued to work together, producing shelved trap and electronic albums, but they were never able to “answer the call,” as Blu put it. That is, until Miles: From An Interlude Called Life, the worthy successor to their seismic debut. Named, in part, for jazz titan Miles Davis (and dedicated to Miles Elijah Barnes), the album is about closing loops (musical, personal, historical), the pair’s long, exhaustive journeys through the underground, and tracking their roots in the process. “It felt like we had been miles away from where we started, and it felt like we had a lot to say about all those miles that we’ve traveled since we’ve begun,” Blu told Bandcamp. In many ways, Miles is like a bookend, not just measuring the distance traveled since Below the Heavens but also finding some semblance of closure. As a rhymer, Blu uncovers the contexts associated with words and finds where different shades of meaning overlap, especially with his name, and here he goes to the next level. He is optimistic amid adversity and adept at managing complex ideas, summed up by this lyric from the opener: “I don’t see the glass half full, I see the whole pitcher.” Miles: From An Interlude Called Life finds a great rap bluesman, laborer, and journeyman thinking about what produced him and the nature of connection. In an interview with the Grammy website, Blu shared that Davis was his grandfather’s favorite artist, that despite always being around the songs, those vibrations didn’t reach him until he was in his 20s, and that getting into jazz through Davis opened his eyes. On “All the Blues,” he raps about naming his son Miles in tribute. The album features Blu’s childhood friend turned R&B star Miguel and Exile’s longtime partner Aloe Blacc, who introduced Ex and Blu in ‘03. In a clever bit of stitching, “Miles Away,” a song about going from city to city on the road, samples the Mos Def verse from “Travellin’ Man.” Many of the early verses are autobiographical, raw, and full of detail as he charts his path to rap through the people and places that molded him, and he shows how BtH helped open a gateway for rappers like Kendrick Lamar and Earl Sweatshirt. He has never been more approachable than he is on “The Feeling” and “You Ain’t Never Been Blue,” songs that navigate the emotional and financial woes of a working-class rapper. The second half of the double album digs deeper into ancestry and shared history. It is a bit like Terrence Malick’s 2011 film The Tree of Life in its pursuit of an existential throughline; both weigh the experiences of the person against the larger forces that shape identity, exploring the relationship between the singular and the collective. Blu’s raps about growth and struggle lace into accounts dating back to antiquity—of soul music, freedom fighting, and self-discovery. Each of these threads is carried by Exile’s stunning, rich sample work, patching together themes about being Black and blue, searching, and learning from your pilgrimage. Miles doesn’t stray too far from the formula of their first two albums, but they feel more like diarists than classicists. The nine-minute epic “Roots of Blue” is a generational survey of the Black civilizations that sprung forth from the cradle of life and how their descendants came to occupy America. The verses are dense yet rapped gracefully as Blu traces the diaspora back to the source; each verse unpacks a royal, spiritual, political, or musical Black legacy. He doesn’t just sound like he’s rattling off names or reciting facts; it’s as if he’s connecting dots. “African Dream” and “The American Dream” are like halves of a whole—the motherland fantasy against a capitalist fairy tale. Both are feats of imagination. Miles is the rare 20-track, 95-minute album that mostly justifies its length. The scope is broad, and Blu weaves with skill between macro and micro. Some of his attempts to zoom out don’t cohere. On “To the Fall, But Not Forgotten,” an homage to the lost becomes a random roll call for celebrities as disparate as Kimbo Slice and Paul Walker. “Dear Lord” is like a COEXIST bumper sticker in song form. And on “The End,” he compares his album’s grand finale to famous assassinations, the 9/11 attacks, and the extinction of the dinosaurs. But Blu is usually deft at pinpointing himself inside the larger narrative. The nostalgic “Music is My Everything” unfurls his own personal history of hip-hop—his cousin teaches him about basslines, his aunt dates Eazy-E, and his mother’s new reverend husband bans secular music from the house. His flows are fluid, his thoughts lucid, recalling memories as his route to rap runs parallel with the boom of the California scene. As with most of Miles, the firsthand experiences of its creators are presented as tiny pieces in a much grander mosaic, one spanning generations.

Totally Crushed Out! / Retreat From the Sun,that dog.,by: Jenn Pelly,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f1efd858fd5732600c342de/1:1/w_160/totally%20crushed%20out_that%20dog.jpg,2020-07-30 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/that-dog-totally-crushed-out-retreat-from-the-sun/,Third Man,"In 1992, Los Angeles’ that dog. formed in the teen bedrooms of singer-guitarist Anna Waronker and bassist Rachel Haden, bringing all the ache and nerve and doom of girlhood to their lovesick vision of alt rock. Theirs was a musical world where astrology, crushes, lip gloss, and punk-rock garage shows all convened in an artful, off-kilter push toward possibility. Barely out of high school, Waronker played her older brother Joey’s left-handed guitar upside down. When Rachel’s sister Petra walked by, she didn’t want to be left out, and dusted off her violin to join. Together, with pitch-perfect three-part harmonies, virtuosic orchestrations, and crashing chords, the original iteration of that dog. made three albums—1994’s that dog., 1995’s Totally Crushed Out!, 1997’s Retreat From the Sun—in a baroque bubblegum pop-rock style all their own. Waronker’s songwriting was thrilling: Her lyrics captured the raw essence of how overwhelming and transforming infatuation can be, singing in the witty, conversational style of a long-lost best friend. She brought girl-group yearning and ’70s singer-songwriter chops to the era of Sassy mag and 120 Minutes. Waronker originally wanted to be a music supervisor, having briefly studied filmmaking at USC, and she had a flair for the colorful details that spike the personality of a song—dialogue, tension, a sense of place. In her endearing deadpan, that dog. songs could feel like scene-setting film treatments for hypothetical teen movies. (Waronker would go on to compose music for Josie and the Pussycats, Clueless, and last year’s Shrill.) The band’s angelic harmonies tended toward a surreal California grandeur, and Petra’s classically trained violin playing was lucid and pretty, rather than noisy like John Cale’s, which made that dog. weirder still. Often compared to contemporaries like the Breeders or Veruca Salt, that dog. sounded more like folk-rock trio the Roches gone art-punk, slyly sophisticated. But these were never the most discussed lines in that dog.’s biography. The Haden sisters were two of the triplet daughters of the legendary jazz bassist Charlie Haden, an original member of the Ornette Coleman Quartet on such towering classics as The Shape of Jazz to Come. Harmonic prowess surrounded them. Waronker, meanwhile, was the daughter of the Warner Brothers record exec Lenny Waronker—which meant she grew up in the orbit of icons like Van Dyke Parks and Randy Newman, and was particularly fond of the latter’s plainspoken piano-pop symphonies. Completing that dog.’s lineup was boy drummer Tony Maxwell, best friend of Waronker’s older brother, a member of Beck’s band. They all attended Santa Monica’s Crossroads High School, where they also met future Girls co-producer Jenni Konner, who helped write some early that dog. lyrics. And so that dog. embodied a strange in-between. They could not have been classified as indie; they signed to David Geffen’s DGC label within a year of forming. On the other hand, their music was too unusual for mass appeal. Future collaborators like Beck and Weezer originally opened for them in the L.A. underground, but that dog.’s rapid ascent meant the group of 19- and 20-year-olds was quickly met with skepticism—headlines in The Washington Post and L.A. Weekly read “Well Connected Dog” and “That Dad”—and sometimes written off as a gimmick. Yet it was their idiosyncratic experiences that helped make that dog.’s songwriting so audacious and their arrangements so richly textured. The Hadens spoke of favoring Bach and Arvo Pärt over anything on the radio. As Maxwell put it in 1997: “We never pretended to be anything other than what we were.” When Waronker first began writing songs, her self-imposed rule was “no love songs, no guitar solos.” But as that dog. progressed, she gave herself a new challenge: only love songs and guitar solos. “I had five broken hearts at one time,” she admitted then, “all broken in five different places.” Her own sensitivity horrified her. Totally Crushed Out! started as her attempt at “a Beatles parody love song” collection, like a teen romance novel recast as clever, grungy power pop, but as it charted the mess and magnitude of emotional ennui, the cheeky art concept became catharsis. After the irony-suffused experiments of their self-titled debut, Totally Crushed Out! was that dog.’s first cohesive record—a sugar-rushing testament to the emotional confusions of youth. The buzz-sawed Shangri-Las pop of “He’s Kissing Christian” delineates the experience of dating someone as he realizes that he would rather be kissing boys—a possible riff on the plot of that year’s Clueless—while the self-sabotage-y opener “Ms. Wrong” (a Konner co-write) is about not feeling a relationship because you don’t feel yourself. On the thrasher “Lip Gloss,” Waronker applies lip gloss in front of a guy and waits for him to kiss her, but, tragically, he never does. “Lily white/Cherry raspberry/Lip lover/Rachel Perry-eee-eee-eee!” the band chants in unison, like Devo-schooled Martians out of a truly alternative dimension of girl-punk kissability. From the Sweet Valley High-evoking album cover to the ill-fated prom dance on “One Summer Night,” the performance of femininity across Totally Crushed Out! is befitting of a gender studies thesis. The starker moments of Totally Crushed Out! are stirring, evoking the band’s acoustic bedroom beginnings while also foreshadowing the impending greatness of Waronker’s writing. The loud/quiet whispers of “Silently” describe being pissed off and enamored by someone (later confirmed to be Beck Hansen) at the same time. The dour minimalism of “Side Part” knows all too well that the only way out of heartbreak, often, is through. Other mellow Crushed Out! ballads explore breaches of confidence, the despairing haze of being alone on “Holidays,” and the erudition of the MTV-era fangirl. Waronker’s songs cut to the marrow of young womanhood, validating how longing and obsession are all tied up in the process of becoming. By the time of the sleek, polished Retreat From the Sun, Waronker was 24; she’d been in that dog. since she was 19. The songs were deeper, more finely wrought—initially, she thought they might comprise her first solo album. Retreat was recorded with Brad Wood, who’d produced Liz Phair’s seismic Exile in Guyville around the time that dog. formed, and it shared much with Phair’s intelligence, ambition, and sexuality. It was Wood who pushed that dog. to go “as new wave as possible” on Retreat’s laser-beam single, “Never Say Never”—a glossy video would find its way into MTV rotation—which not only evoked the Go-Go’s but featured their keyboardist Charlotte Caffey on synth. Beyond the single, Retreat From the Sun carefully placed Waronker’s sensitive balladeering—often as irreducible as teardrop country tunes—alongside throttling pop-punk gems containing timeless aphorisms: “By definition a crush must hurt/And they do, and they do/Just like the one I have on you.” Waronker was inspired by the pop leanings of her then-boyfriend (and future husband) Steve McDonald, of L.A. glam punks Redd Kross, who lent her a piano, near which she displayed a photo of her family friend Randy Newman. She reflected on her deepening relationship with McDonald in many of Retreat’s songs. Waronker told Much Music, “I’m entering into more of a Carole King phase…. It’s pop, but it’s more, like, frizzy-haired. I’m gonna have frizzy hair and a baby and a flowered skirt.” (There are at least two explicit mom-rock tunes on Retreat From the Sun.) Perhaps to temper all of that normative monogamy, Waronker and McDonald wrote a song together: “Gagged and Tied.” “I don’t care if you don’t treat me like a lady,” Waronker sings with delightful touches of evil. “I don’t care, just sit there, and don’t disobey me.” In this straight-faced BDSM scene—“Put on ‘Venus in Furs’/And you can go home afterwards”—Waronker’s singing is still unassuming and innocent, recalling how Liz Phair once said, “The point of some of [my] songs was to say things that shouldn’t come out of the voice that was saying it.” In the end, Waronker can’t help making even a dominatrix fantasy sound disarmingly sweet. “It’s not your style/I can see/You crack a smile,” she sings, a whole layered plot twist in less than a dozen words. You could call Waronker a master of pop-punk literary compression. The breezy “Minneapolis” alludes to how she met McDonald one night at a beloved L.A. club. “I was at the Jabberjaw/Cutest boy I ever saw,” she sings, and in four minutes, the song captures the stomach-twisting spark of a crush—a rush of uncertainty, euphoria, nerves, embarrassment, caught glances, and timid conversation: “He said, ‘I’m leaving on Wednesday/Come see me when Low plays.’” There’s a beguilingly unvarnished feel to Waronker’s singing that makes these dimensional details sound much more casual than they are. “Minneapolis” is one of three Retreat tracks named for specific places, and they’re the best songs Waronker ever wrote. Like “Minneapolis,” the dizzied “Long Island” rips through infatuation, location, and subtext: “You’re pretty dreamy for a boy from Long Island.” What could be less conventionally cool than pining for a guy from the suburbs? But Waronker’s daydream doesn’t waver: I want to set a place for you at my table
We can sit forever watching reruns on cable
Take you driving in my brother’s beat-up car
Sharing a cigarette, we’ll wish upon a star together In its compacted abandon, “Long Island” was a reminder that that dog. toured with fellow ’90s romantics Jawbreaker. So was “Hawthorne,” the sparest and sharpest song in that dog.’s catalog, in which Waronker soberly narrates a visit to her boyfriend’s hometown. “Hawthorne” is immediately visual: “Driving/Looking for your parents’ house/Striving/To find a piece of you,” Waronker sings. It’s a small, ephemeral moment, but a telling one, seeming to gesture at what those devastating crushes were after, mixing mundanity and depth. Both songs are evidence of the particular electricity of intimacy that can exist inside of cars, the sense that you are totally aligned with another person if only for a moment. It’s that precise type of person-to-person connection that that dog.’s vulnerable records have fostered with new generations of fans, spreading by word of mouth and influencing bands like Paramore, Vivian Girls, Swearin’, and so many others. Though they imploded shortly after Retreat From the Sun, that dog. offer proof that honesty endures, that what makes something continue to resonate, usually, is simple—you could miss it, if you don’t listen close. “And I saw a punk rock show/In a car garage/And I saw you as a child,” Waronker sings on “Hawthorne,” wide-eyed and coasting; “I saw you/My dream come true.” How to make that feeling last is a mystery of life.

Mafia Bidness,Shoreline Mafia,by: Dean Van Nguyen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f1f18d21372d0355380498f/1:1/w_160/mafia%20bidness_shoreline%20mafia.jpg,2020-07-30 05:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/shoreline-mafia-mafia-bidness/,Atlantic,"The Los Angeles rap group Shoreline Mafia blew up in 2017 with raw, druggy cult hits like “Musty.” In a strange twist of fate, the young quartet’s fledgling career was given a boost when the video for “Codeine Bryant” featured in a Fox 11 Los Angeles news piece that targeted “the codeine craze.” Their local-hero status led to a contract with Atlantic, a stunning rise for a collective with roots in the city’s graffiti scene. To hear group member Ohgeesy tell it, the story is something akin to twee indie teen movie Mid90s: just average teenagers having fun and wasting hours under the shadows of the palm trees. “We was just going stupid,” he told Fader in 2018. “I was tagging, skating. I was into crazy-ass shit—it was fun. Now, I’m not doing nothing unless I get actually paid for it.” Ohgeesy’s assertion that money is the motivation, with fun relegated to second place, seems to predict the problems that hold back new record Mafia Bidness. The pursuit of a check is obviously a necessity—in rap, it’s venerated—but there’s the feeling here of something beautiful being corrupted. Mafia Bidness is being pitched as Shoreline’s debut album after a series of mixtapes, and there are times when you can sense the commercial compromises. Take “Poe The Drop”: A Future feature makes perfect sense on paper—the group’s magnificent debut tape ShorelineDoThatShit was an out-and-out sizzurp record. But here the collaboration feels perfunctory in the extreme. It’s not that the song is bad, exactly, but Future barely sounds like he’s in the room and the chemistry never catches fire. Though influenced by Southern lean culture, Shoreline’s music fits neatly into the ratchet music corner of L.A. rap. When it comes together, Mafia Bidness boasts some of the most infectious California rap records of the summer. “Aww Shit” and “Fuck It Up” feature slick keyboard riffs, crisp snares and spotless production that feels heavily indebted to DJ Mustard—the perfect backdrop for the group’s alluring raps and playful punchlines. As usual, the murky voices of Ohgeesy and Fenix Flexin are most prominent throughout the album, with Rob Vicious and Master Kato dropping in and out to help keep things interesting. The fusing of West and South is most obvious on “How We Do It,” a séance that attempts to resurrect Montell Jordan’s Angeleno anthem “This Is How We Do It” and turn it into a drug song (“The codeine’s here on the west side,” spits Fenix). You can feel an element of hit-chasing to the decision to ride Jordan’s beloved ‘90s classic. But the tweaks to the beat are to the song’s detriment, with a hum coating the bassline adding an unwanted distortion. Needless to say, guest vocalist Wiz Khalifa is a strange taste-making pick in 2020. Mafia Bidness is stacked with guests, and the chemistry is at its best when L.A. artists come through. The inclusion of a very old Drakeo The Ruler freestyle showcasing his stony delivery may be an attempt to honor the incarcerated star. Later, YG and underrated Maryland rapper Q Da Fool jump on the album’s best experimental moment, “Gangstas and Sippas (Remix).” With long-time Shoreline collaborators Ron-Ron The Producer and AceTheFace’s hiccupping horns summoning the spirit of Missy Elliott, it proves the group can excel outside their established formula. Thematically, Shoreline stay focused on one topic: women. They’re interested in romance, providing their lovers with material luxuries, and sex. A lot of sex. In Shoreline Mafia’s world, every text message is illicit. They’re probably the most sex-obsessed Californians since Too $hort. Sometimes this one-track mindedness can be a bit dumb: a song titled “Bitches” queasily catalogues the different types of women they claim to come into contact with. More interesting is “Change Ya Life,” produced by Helluva Beats. A sweet hook and heartfelt candor makes way for sinister piano keys and a throbbing beat, making the song at once a hip-hop-R&B crossover single and horror-movie score. Innovative moments can’t relieve the disappointment that such a lengthy tracklist contains little as dark and sneakily gripping as “Musty” (which, importantly, Shoreline have claimed was recorded in one take) and “Whuss The Deal.” The inclusion of bonus track “Bands”—which featured on the 2018 Rob Vicious showcase Traplantic and includes all four members—just acts as a reminder of how irresistible their music can be, the group fluidly passing the mic to one another, the formula pure. With its flaws, Mafia Bidness is a solid L.A. party record, but no definitive Shoreline Mafia document. In the future, the group should make it their business to stay truer to themselves.

Long Lost Solace Find,Mike Polizze,by: Sam Sodomsky,Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f1f4b2db0ff028b6c6a70de/1:1/w_160/Long%20Lost%20Solace%20Find_mike%20polizze.jpg,2020-07-30 05:00:00,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/mike-polizze-long-lost-solace-find/,Paradise of Bachelors,"Mike Polizze’s music used to feel like a secret. Public Service Announcement, the 2010 breakthrough from his project Purling Hiss, was classic rock as heard leaking from someone else’s earbuds, anthems that disintegrated into noise as soon as you started humming along. Polizze wasn’t the only artist testing the limits of scuzzy production at the time, but his interests seemed deeper than a mere aesthetic. Through the following decade, his follow-up releases found him cleaning up his sound and sharpening his songwriting, but he still maintained a distance through foggy melodies that swerved and plunged like question marks. It was Kurt Vile who heard Public Service Announcement and convinced Polizze to bring his music on the road with an actual band. Ten years later, he makes a similar suggestion as his collaborator on Long Lost Solace Find, the first album credited to Polizze as a solo artist. Along with producer Jeff Zeigler (of the War on Drugs), Vile and Polizze recorded the album in their native Philadelphia, and it’s a record defined by closeness: simple folk songs that present Polizze and his acoustic guitar with the kind of intimacy we expect from rock acts going solo. Tonally, it exists somewhere between the hungover campfire songs of J. Mascis’ solo albums and the starkly drawn alt-rock of Greg Sage’s Straight Ahead. It is more straightforward than any of Polizze’s previous albums but no less evocative. Nearly every song on Long Lost Solace Find opens with a bright major chord, and most of them spend their runtimes lingering in the light it offers. Polizze plays most of the instruments himself, and Vile shows up in the margins with subtle background vocals, slide guitar, harmonica, and, at one point, trumpet. They are natural collaborators; listening to this record can sometimes feel like an extension of both the softer points of Purling Hiss’ discography and the bleary universe of Vile’s own records. Like Vile, Polizze writes lyrics as if he’s muttering them to himself, even when he’s gesturing toward something universal. And if his language rarely feels bold on its own, it does establish an undeniable mood paired with such laid-back music. “Rest assured, enjoy the ride,” he sings in the closing track, and it is the bemused tone of someone confident in where they are going. Polizze spends much of the album pondering love, but highlights like “Wishing Well” and “Eyes Reach Across” communicate less on the lyric page than they do in his delivery: an effortless speak-sing over gentle strumming and plucked guitar solos. It flows like a well-conceived song cycle and moves gracefully from one thought to the next. In the instrumental “D’Modal,” whose title could be a reference to a feel-good Led Zeppelin hit or his own guitar tuning, Polizze offers a groovy reprieve that segues into the twilight visions of “Sit Down.” In that song, he describes sunlight as “laser beams through my hair,” which seems like a good summary of the world he builds through songs: intimate, warm, a little uncanny. The sound of the record approaches bliss: the sonic equivalent of a beer on the beach at sunset. But Polizze’s thoughts don’t always follow him there. The narrative in mid-album highlight “Do Do Do” seems fairly bleak: a plainspoken survey of getting older and playing in a band, pledging to change your self-destructive ways before they harden into habits. Kind of a drag. But every time the chorus hits, he ascends into a wordless refrain, echoed by an acoustic guitar stuck on the most amiable notes of a solo, repeated over and over again.

We Have Amnesia Sometimes,Yo La Tengo,by: Steven Arroyo,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f1f17824b20e405c129ccc6/1:1/w_160/we%20have%20amnesia%20sometime_yo%20la%20tengo.jpg,2020-07-29 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/yo-la-tengo-we-have-amnesia-sometimes/,Matador,"“We didn’t really set out to make a soothing, relaxing album for sleep time.” That’s Yo La Tengo bassist James McNew reflecting on the process behind their 2018 album There’s a Riot Going On. Intentional or not, it was probably the band’s most consistently tranquil LP in 15 years— even its charged-up song sounded like it was generating electricity for fairy lights. The New Jersey trio often cope with life’s harder moments by turning down and turning inward—it’s a huge part of what makes them so meaningful to so many. McNew might have also been a bit frazzled from having to learn a new software interface to engineer the layered, loop-dense album; remembering what the multi-track to “Above the Sound” looked like, he said, was enough to make him dizzy. He won’t have that problem when he thinks back on We Have Amnesia Sometimes, which was recorded with a single microphone placed in the middle of the band’s Hoboken practice space. As Ira Kaplan explains, in late April, “with the outside world weighing on everybody,” the band figured out how to safely convene and resume “playing formlessly.” This is how many of their songs have begun over the years, but here, they’ve released the raw material. It’s new territory for them: The key difference between these five gentle drones and the band’s abundant film-scoring or ambient-leaning work, technically speaking, is that those pieces almost always had some lead melody or some syncopated rhythm, however subtle. Here, there are hints of the former on the third and fourth tracks, and the fourth does have the latter, but otherwise, nobody steps out in front or distinguishes themselves clearly. And that is, generally speaking, the beautiful part of this project. What better time to submit to an exercise in committee and unity than now, when we are quite literally as distanced as ever? On We Have Amnesia Sometimes, Kaplan, McNew, and Georgia Hubley blend into each other and seem to form one big animal. On “James and Ira demonstrate mysticism and some confusion holds (Monday),” the three wade into a shimmering pond of synths and ponder their reflections. On “Georgia thinks it's probably okay (Tuesday),” a storm of feedback rolls in, and by the end there’s a distant pulse, like a washing machine. “Ira searches for the slide, sort of (Friday)” meditates around what sounds like the same organ from “Sudden Organ,” and the light ticking of some down-strumming that the mic picks up becomes its percussion track. To complement the album’s release, the band performed two ticketed live-stream sets from their practice space, with proceeds going to the Brennan Center for Justice. For a little over half an hour each, they let themselves be filmed while immersed in the process, zoned in on their instruments, pedals, amps, and most of all each other. At one point early in the first set, Hubley leans over in her chair to adjust something, guitar in hand, and on the way up accidentally taps the underside of the crash cymbal next to her with the guitar head. She cracks a smile at the surprise percussion, but it sort of works, so she waits a moment and does it again. It’s indicative of the incredible level of trust and telepathy in that room, which is plenty audible on We Have Amnesia Sometimes. However, the album doesn’t have enough blemishes, stumbles, or flourishes like this to give it extra excitement and curiosity. The risk level stays relatively comfortable; the payoff never really shoots up. Now in their 29th year with this lineup, ever since McNew stopped a revolving door of some 16 bassists before him, Yo La Tengo are still coming up with new ways to connect with themselves and with their listeners. They picked an appropriate moment for one of their most intimate ideas yet. There is something undeniably comforting, if low-stakes, about hearing them play around with noise, up-close, in the middle of a quarantine-induced drought of human interaction.

Capricorn,Trevor Powers,by: Quinn Moreland,Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f206800a4977ff122dad6d4/1:1/w_160/capricorn_trevor%20powers.jpg,2020-07-29 05:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/trevor-powers-capricorn/,Fat Possum,"In 2016, after six years performing under the name Youth Lagoon, Trevor Powers said goodbye. He sought greater artistic freedom: After finding success making intimate bedroom pop about anxiety and isolation, Powers felt his vision had become constricted. “It’s odd to realize that something you’ve created can have the power of wrapping a leash around your neck & holding you hostage,” he wrote in a note to fans at the time. But freedom is an illusion we all learn to concede to in one way or another. After a severe panic attack, Powers decamped to a cabin with a piano located at the foot of Idaho’s Sawtooth mountain range to reset. Accompanied by his instruments, a computer, and recording gear, Powers encapsulated this time in an album he titled Capricorn. While 2018’s Mulberry Violence—Powers’ first foray into making music under his own name—leaned into discord as a means of self-obliteration, Capricorn is a measured, expressive experiment in erasure. Minus a few distorted samples, Capricorn removes Powers’ voice from the equation and allows his skills as a sculptor of sound to shine. While Powers’ early work is sometimes lumped in with the tail end of chillwave, his sense of depth and texture was always more ambitious, characteristics on full display here. Like a heavily tattooed modern-day Thoreau, he sprinkles the record with recordings of raindrops, streams, and thunderstorms, reminders of the symphony that the natural world offers us for free. But for the most part Powers distorts these details until they lose their organic quality, the way a cricket chirping in slow motion sounds more like a computer than an insect. Capricorn unfolds slowly, creating a surface calm. Nothing here feels rushed, nor overly polished. “Earth to Earth” emits a haze of textured synths and bird calls, while “The Riverine” contains tinges of pedal steel, evoking rolling hills misted with dew. The spectral beginnings of “A New Name” slowly give way to a warped sample of a voice seemingly repeating the word “body.” The mind is encouraged to wander. But there’s an undercurrent of eeriness to Capricorn, as if at any moment the tranquility could slip to reveal a nightmare. Sometimes these lines are obvious, as on “The Riverine” and “Blue Savior,” each briefly punctured by mournful, bluesy horns. The serene opener “First Rain” is suddenly interrupted by a garbled voice and a chiming bell that sounds like a train barreling through the night; the song picks up again like nothing happened, but the sensation lingers. A pair of ominous closing tracks do little to inspire a sense of resolve. “Pest” begins with a symphonic array of woodwinds that suddenly burst into sharp, menacing squawks. The song builds on the sense of unease, ratcheting up tension until it could soundtrack some poor soul’s untimely demise. “2166” is unsettling in a different way, pairing a fuzzy, melancholic piano melody with a noirish sax drone. Musically, Powers appears to be on a quest towards ego death, willing to tear everything apart in order to rebuild. Capricorn invites us to disappear with him.

Trasslig EP,Becky and the Birds,by: Eric Torres,Editorial Producer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f1f1d342bbf29fb1d7df96d/1:1/w_160/trasslig_becky%20and%20the%20birds.jpg,2020-07-29 05:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/becky-and-the-birds-trasslig/,4AD,"Under the name Becky and the Birds, Swedish singer and producer Thea Gustafsson makes gossamer-light music threaded with R&B beats and her acrobatic, piercing falsetto. She studied at the prestigious Swedish songwriting academy Musikmakarna—even interning under EDM wunderkind Avicii—but Gustafsson resisted the formulaic pop training. Instead, she drew on the jazz and soul records of her youth to create her own stylish take, introduced on a brief 2018 self-titled EP. Embroidered with spacious beats, spoken-word segments, and slippery vocal modulations, her music adopts a lightly cinematic style to backdrop her soaring voice. On Trasslig, Gustafsson’s follow-up EP, she maintains a similar mood but brightens it up with strummed guitar and mid-tempo beats, evoking a breezy temperament that belies lyrics that explore aching vulnerability. Gustafsson builds momentum best through her gliding melodies. Where whistle tones and other vocal feats were used more as scenery on her home-recorded debut, here she leans further into them as dramatic linchpins. On “Wondering,” she dances around a deep-pitched looped vocal and teases out vowels between words as she ponders the afterlife in an ascending melody: “Wondering where you are?/What’s it gonna be without you?” She wrote the song after her late grandmother, an inspiration she translates into a wistfulness that feels weightless and soothing. A similar sense of nostalgia colors “Pass Me By,” on which she succumbs to the “sweet surrender” of a summer romance over gentle multi-tracked vocals and a sample of Hiromasa Suzuki’s 1976 song “High-Flying.” The song graciously takes its time to unwind, extending over a minute and a half before drums roll in behind and loft it into a panoramic highlight. Trasslig’s more earnest ballads fall flat without the same sense of movement, but Gustafsson’s risky production leaves room for surprises. The heartbroken “Paris” conjures up the sparse, acoustic moments on Frank Ocean’s Blonde, especially with Gustafsson’s voice suddenly pitched up to a high-pitched replica of Ocean’s over an organ-like synth. But when she adopts the same modulation on “Do U Miss Me,” the EP’s closing ballad, Gustafsson eventually flips the affected vocal into a backup to her own unaltered voice, melding them together in powerful harmony. Those bespoke details across Trasslig add up to their own distinct world, rendering a contemplative and tranquil look at all the complexities that come when you allow yourself to be vulnerable to your own emotions.

Indigo Dream,E.M.M.A.,by: Will Pritchard,Contributor ,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f1f1a43a19e8dd903478a3d/1:1/w_160/indigo%20dream_emma.jpg,2020-07-29 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/emma-indigo-dream/,Local Action,"Depending on your perspective, indigo can be the first or the last stripe of the rainbow: either the darkness into which all color melts, or the starting point from which the entire spectrum unfolds. London-via-Merseyside producer E.M.M.A. shifts back and forth between these viewpoints on Indigo Dream, where widescreen ’80s excess—all neon pinks, retro-wave fonts, and cocaine euphoria—runs into moody, intricate atmospheres reminiscent of the soundtracks for indie video games like Wilmot’s Warehouse, Limbo, and Monument Valley. In the years since her first LP, 2013’s Blue Gardens, E.M.M.A. has turned to soundtracking campaigns for fashion houses including Gucci and Chanel, as well as scoring a clutch of short films. After the clubbish lean of Blue Gardens, Indigo Dream tilts toward the cinematic and the intimate. Synths take center stage here, but with a cool restraint throughout. “Interlude” exhibits a painterly approach; “Wave” trills and glistens; “Shell” stirs on a swollen bed of woven arpeggios; and there’s a moment halfway through “Ballad of Janet” when the bassline gives way to an electrifying wash of synthetic strings. Occasionally these touches feel overwrought and meandering: “Ryan Gosling in Space” attempts to wrench color and emotion from a dense, reverberating array of keys and snares, but what should be punchy comes off as wandering and unfocused. Some of the tracks here date back as far as 2015, but much of the dancefloor-dependent drum work that threaded its way through previous outings (see the abrasive Baroque-step of 2017’s “Mindmaze”) is absent here. It appears in occasional flourishes—the delicate, snapping menace of “Shell,” or the rounding kicks and bitcrushed claps of “Echo”—but elsewhere E.M.M.A. makes inventive percussive use of a whole range of other sounds: fizzes of white noise on “Gold,” a plucked synth on “Interlude” that conjures water droplets breaking the glassy surface of some otherworldly lake. The occasional insertion of field recordings and found sounds (birds chirp on “Ballad of Janet”; “Into Indigo” conceals a distant thunderstorm) offer an organic presence in an otherwise computer-generated enclave. Despite the album’s slight, 35-minute runtime, recurring movements and motifs across the nine songs make it feel weightier and more substantial—like a slowly unwinding conversation or, for that matter, a dream: the type you strain to keep a grip on as another morning pulls you from slumber.

Manger on McNichols,Boldy JamesSterling Toles,by: Nathan Smith,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f188c068fd5732600c34009/1:1/w_160/Boldy-James-Sterling-Toles-Manger-on-McNichols.jpg,2020-07-28 05:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/boldy-james-sterling-toles-manger-on-mcnichols/,Sector 7-G,"This year has been good to Boldy James. February’s The Price of Tea in China was something of a return to the Detroit rapper’s roots—another LP with longtime collaborator the Alchemist, in an effortlessly classicist style—but his victory lap, Manger on McNichols, branches into new territory. Boldy’s toolkit is simple—a clear-cut flow, and an ear for lived-in phrasing—but he uses it to construct a rich simulation of Detroit, rendering a version of the city that’s tangible even to listeners who have never visited the real place. The landscape Boldy paints is overwhelmingly, almost oppressively dark: “I never been to the joint, but that’s just how it is when you live in Detroit,” he raps on “Detroit River Rock.” Though Boldy has long had a knack for self-reflection, his writing is even deeper and his focus more intense on Manger on McNichols. It’s not just Detroit that’s depicted in detail—Boldy also writes his way through some of his most traumatic memories. He’s at his most introspective on “Mommy Dearest (a eulogy),” a stream-of-consciousness internal monologue about Boldy’s tortured relationship to his mother inspired by a single line from Biggie’s “Suicidal Thoughts” (“I know my mother wish she got a fucking abortion”). The album’s darkest and most despairing cut is sequenced to effortlessly flow into its most triumphant; “Birth of Bold (the christening)” rises up in glory from Boldy’s painful origins, a joyful declaration of perseverance. In a podcast interview sampled on “Mommy Dearest,” Boldy credits his newly personal vision to the encouragement of producer Sterling Toles, a longstanding presence in Detroit’s underground scene but not a known quantity among rap heads like the Alchemist. Alc’s beats are seamless and refined, a perfect vessel for Boldy’s casual charisma, but they remain a little predictable, in the way all classic hip-hop beats are the product of a specific formula. Sterling’s productions, on the other hand, feel like full-fledged compositions, knotted and jazzy and complicated, capable of existing without Boldy’s voice but better because of it. Toles’ work contains the familiar soul samples, segments of sermons, organ swells, and scratches, but his beats go beyond jazz-rap into something closer to true jazz. Flutes, alto sax, and live percussion linger on the edges of “Welcome to 76,” and a mournful cello drones throughout the record.” Sterling’s beats aren’t consistent digital patterns but living things, fluttering and freeform, backed often by live drums. His confident bass playing provides as much a backbone to the record as Boldy’s charismatic voice. Sometimes the drums are late to kick in, letting Boldy’s flow function as the beat (“Detroit River Rock”); sometimes there are no drums at all, just bass, bold flows, and noodling synth lines (“Requiem”). Sterling’s compositions float in the neutral zone between hip-hop, jazz, and electronic. “Birth of Bold (a christening)” is a Vocoder-inflected G-funk jam until around 45 seconds from the end, when a galloping bassline kicks in and the whole thing transforms into a cosmic Flying Lotus-type beat. On “BB Butcher,” the high-BPM breakbeat approaches the hurried intensity of drum ‘n’ bass. As instrumental tracks, Sterling’s contributions often seek to unsettle, reflecting the anxiety Boldy describes in his lyrics, but it’s his ensemble of bells, xylophones, and glittering keys that provide the album’s few points of uplift. In his full-length collaborations with single producers, Boldy James lets himself be pushed creatively in a way few rappers ever do, ceding a certain amount of control to the direction of a single creative voice. Sterling Toles isn’t afraid to make complicated beats, and Boldy isn’t afraid of them, and the resulting fusion is unrestrained and inventive in a way few rap records are.

40˚.40,SD9,by: Isabelia Herrera,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f1ef6eaa19e8dd903478a06/1:1/w_160/40%CB%9A.40_sd9.jpg,2020-07-28 05:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/sd9-4040/,On-Retainer,"SD9 is acutely aware of the fantasies projected on his hometown. For outsiders, the city conjures images of golden beaches and chilled caipirinhas, maybe the gentle hum of a João Gilberto tune echoing in the distance. To accompany the release of his debut album 40°.40, the Bonsucesso-raised artist wrote a poem about this romanticized vision of Rio, alongside a short visual. In the clip, he renders a fantasy of the city in rich detail, celebrating its gorgeous women and sunny boulevards. He quotes Gilberto Gil’s 1969 song “Aquele Abraço,” in which the Tropicália icon ensures that “Rio de Janeiro is still beautiful.” And then, within 30 seconds, SD9 shatters the utopia. Scenes of young kids carrying submachine guns flash across the screen as he reveals a more fatalistic picture of Rio—one plagued with police surveillance and brutality, burning cars, and infinite cycles of drug addiction and violence. “Sorry Gilberto Gil, but for me, Rio de Janeiro was never beautiful,” SD9 says. Across the album, he explores a wide range of emotional textures that are part of living in Rio—its pleasures and its hardships. 40°.40 captures a side of the city most people refuse to see. SD9 and his producers excel when they reimagine their Rio roots within the framework of UK grime. Standout “Poze do Rodo,” featuring fellow Brazilian grime upstarts D r o p e and LEALL, layers an aluminum tamborzão beat over a frosty eskibeat click, a brilliantly metallic synthesis that evokes classic Wiley instrumentals and baile funk parties in equal measure. SD9 and his co-conspirators trade bars about garnering status and respect in the slums while alluding to MC Poze, a funk carioca MC who is regularly targeted by law enforcement for his alleged connections to drug trafficking. Similarly, SD9 drops vocalized tamborzão patterns on songs like “Consequencias” and “B.O.,” using funk carioca’s playful “bum-cha-cha, cha cha” to punctuate his tales of crime and street life. The centerpiece of these stories is SD9’s guttural timbre, which lends itself well to the curvatures of Portuguese. The macabre church choir stabs on “ODP & Sangue” are coarse enough to get under your skin, and SD9’s staccato, horror-movie flow cloaks the typewriter-like snare drums in a villainous shroud. On the title track, SD9 shares memories of friends gone too soon, lost to police or gang violence. For those who reside in the neighborhoods in the North Zone, past Rio’s famous Christ the Redeemer statue, death is omnipresent. SD9 isn’t afraid to confront this haunting reality in his flow, to make you feel the specter of death in your chest. His vocals hit the hardest when fortified by the beats of his producers, many of whom are faithful students of grime and its hybrid influences. On the wonderfully ballistic “Astra 1.8,” another meditation on death, beatmaker Chediak combines the overblown bass of 8-bar, the revving of an engine, and jittery jungle breaks; the result feels like two grade-school kids smashing action figures together. DIIGO’s instrumental on “Oi” threads together a breathy sex moan, the blaring horn of a WhatsApp push notification, and 2-step garage textures into a song about a girl at the club with a Ganesha tattoo and Nike VaporMaxes. Meanwhile, frigid piano flourishes appear on the title track and the aforementioned “Poze do Rodo.” These productions are as reverent of grime as they are prescient, illustrating the genre’s capacity for reinvention. 40°.40 traces a blueprint of how to evolve a genre steeped in the history of local communities. It transcends mere tribute and instead functions as an initiation into the underworld of Brazilian grime. It’s no wonder that SD9 and his fellow MCs in the local grime collective TBC Mob selected this genre as their weapon of choice; government officials have racially profiled and criminalized practitioners of funk carioca, Rio’s claim to global music fame, as much as the UK-bred artists from which SD9 draws inspiration. 40°.40 excels when the MC draws sonic and cultural parallels between these sounds. And at the same time that 40°.40 communicates a strong sense of place, it asks us to make sense of the way hyperlocal music movements evolve in the context of globalization. When a genre like grime goes mainstream, traveling across social media networks and streaming platforms, what happens to its context? More than reinscribing stale tropes about music’s capacity to transcend borders and languages, 40°.40 is a testament to the fact that music born out of struggle can transform itself, appealing to people living in similar situations elsewhere—especially those who need it for survival.

Skullcrusher EP,Skullcrusher,by: Sophie Kemp ,Contributor ,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f1b09b91372d035538047ab/1:1/w_160/Skullcrusher.jpg,2020-07-28 05:00:00,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/skullcrusher-skullcrusher-ep/,Secretly Canadian,"Skullcrusher, the ambient folk project of Los Angeles-based, New York State-raised musician Helen Ballentine, is soft and subtle. Her lyrics are intimate, and when she sings it feels as if she is making unsparing eye contact. While the acoustic confessionalism of her debut EP Skullcrusher isn’t terribly original, it is nonetheless lovely, captivating, and quietly devastating. It’s tempting to lump Ballentine’s music in with that of Julien Baker and Phoebe Bridgers, but spiritually Skullcrusher is closer to Phil Elverum’s work as the Microphones, with its tendency towards spectral ambiance and steak tartare-level rawness. Opener “Places/Plans” showcases Ballentine’s multi-tracked vocals alongside a simple acoustic guitar chord progression. “Do you think that I’m going places?” she asks with a tinge of irony, following the question with another more heartbreaking: “Does it matter if I’m a really good friend? That I’m there when you call and when your shows end?” The words are straightforward and to the point. With the exception of an overdubbed synthesizer that glows softly as old headlights, the arrangements are sparse. Ballentine writes about first loves burdened by discomfort and paralyzing uncertainty. On the brief “Two Weeks in December,” she sings about a first encounter with a romantic prospect that eventually turned sour. “I looked cool rolling cigarettes/You were fooled by my jokes/I was too/I didn’t know you,” she sings sadly. You can practically hear her hands move up and down the neck of her guitar, creaking like wooden floorboards. The vast empty spaces between her words can make it sound as though Ballentine is pausing to omit identifying details as she reads directly from a diary. First kisses and first dates often lie, she seems to say, and the versions of ourselves we present to potential partners aren’t entirely real. Skullcrusher is just a sketch. The EP is less than 15 minutes long; you could grab a glass of water and make your bed and have made it most of the way through these four songs. But “Trace,” a song that feels like the final embrace at the end of a relationship far past its sell-by date, shows Ballentine inching towards something more fleshed out. “When you come over/You don’t ask me how my day went,” she sings in a moment of stasis, before banjos, synthesizers, and bleary-eyed guitars triumphantly coalesce. She questions what it means to stay, and whether or not things will fall apart the second she gets up to leave. But instead of retreating into the shadows of uncertainty and unhappiness, Ballentine takes flight. There are no identifying details to cling to here—just shades of feeling so strikingly familiar that Ballentine might as well be singing about you.

1,Luke Jenner,by: Stuart Berman,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f1ef06e97c3394bd8286b47/1:1/w_160/Luke%20Jenner%20-%201.jpg,2020-07-28 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/luke-jenner-1/,Manono,"The Rapture were so good at being a dance-punk band that it’s easy to forget they spent much of their existence chafing against being pigeonholed as one. Go back and listen to the three albums they released between 2003 and 2011 and what you hear isn’t so much a cool, club-conquering groove machine as a strange, vulnerable, occasionally psychedelic pop group trapped inside one. If signature songs “House of Jealous Lovers” and “Out of the Races and Onto the Tracks” brought panic to the disco, curveball ballads like “Open Up Your Heart” and hippy-dippy detours like “Live in Sunshine” revealed the Rapture wanted not just to dance until the break of dawn, but to stick around for breakfast, too. As it turns out, that tension between late-night decadence and morning-after innocence was about more than simply sidestepping indie-dance trends; it was also a reflection of the emotional tug-of-war playing out in singer/guitarist Luke Jenner’s life. As he’s since made clear in interviews, the Rapture’s ascent had a damaging effect on his marriage, while the arrival of his son in 2006—and the death of his mother by suicide that same year—put him in the nigh-impossible position of trying to be both a successful, globe-trotting musician and a present, engaged family man. Eventually, he put his career on pause to focus on being a better dad. “Well, we’re all getting bigger, but it takes time to be a man,” Jenner sang on the last song of the last Rapture album to date, and he wasn’t bullshitting. In his case, it’s taken almost a decade—a period spent reconnecting with his family, getting involved with his local community, and confronting the darkest moments of his past. Jenner’s musical equipment hasn’t exactly been collecting dust that whole time—before reuniting the Rapture for a couple of dates in 2019, he kept busy playing drums in the DIY no-wave group Seedy Films (which he formed with some amateur musician friends he’d been mentoring) and making bedroom techno under the name Meditation Tunnel. But while 1, the first installment of a planned trilogy, marks his first proper solo album, it’s less a confessional singer/songwriter record than an abstract reimagining of one, where raw lyrical introspection and open-hearted devotionals are filtered through the exploratory ethos of an ambient soundtrack producer. While a handful of tracks provide distant aftershocks of the Rapture’s dancefloor pulse, the guiding principle isn’t so much post-punk as post-Floyd, foregrounding languid acoustic pastorales, stargazing electric-guitar slides, and ominous sound effects (ringing alarms and explosions included) that hark back to the classic-rock icons’ mid-’70s imperial phase. Jenner has said he named his Meditation Tunnel project after a sleeping-aid toy for kids, but 1 takes that concept to a more literal level—this record isn’t so much a collection of songs as a group-therapy session, its tracks connected by various field recordings of Jenner interviewing members of his community about the meaning of life and love. As in those sorts of meetings, Jenner’s objective is to create a safe, welcoming space before working up the courage to open up and bleed. We don’t even hear his vocals until a full 10 minutes into the record, partway through the epic second track, “All My Love.” With the song’s Funeral-marching beat providing moral support, Jenner reveals his self-doubt, but that anxiety soon turns to exultation as he reaffirms his loyalty to his family en route to a triumphant, Joshua Tree-scaling finale. On 1, Jenner finally embraces the domestic bliss he once dreamed of on those Rapture records, but the album doesn’t shy away from delving into the struggles he endured to get there. Jenner has said that his desire to be a more committed father to his son stems from his fear of replicating the dysfunctional family environment he was raised in, and 1’s most captivating moments reverberate with the aftershocks of deep-seated trauma. “Asshole” is a frank account of sexual abuse that, in perverse Lynchian fashion, accesses the past through a nostalgic doo-wop serenade. A similar combination of candor and valor pervades the piano ballad “You’re Not Alone,” a devastating portrait of bullying and parental neglect that manages to spin personal pain into communal healing. As tracks like these confirm, Jenner is no longer the hyperactive shrieker of old. While throbbing, bass-driven instrumentals like “If There Is a God” (whose storm-cloud ambience suggests a disco remix of “Riders on the Storm”) may whet the appetite for a new Rapture album, he mostly favors a tender, graceful delivery that both reflects his current lot in life and respects the sensitivity of the album’s subject matter. In fact, 1 could use more of his voice—Jenner’s lead vocals are heard on only four of these 10 tracks and, after a while, the soundscapes start to blur into one long slow-motion, cosmic campfire hallucination. Fortunately, Jenner outfits this meticulous album with a pressure-release valve in the closing “About to Explode,” which feels less like a spontaneous combustion than a slow, satisfying exhale. Over a gleaming melody that hovers somewhere between “Heroes” and Disintegration, Jenner leaves us with a thought that echoes his previous sign-off: “It takes time to get to this place/It takes time to finish this race.” On an album that celebrates Jenner’s hard-fought contentment, it’s a sobering reminder that overcoming trauma and becoming a better husband and father aren’t some magical end state, but an ideal to work toward every day.","Nine years after the Rapture’s last album, the group’s singer/guitarist returns with his debut solo album, grappling with fatherhood and legacies of trauma in ambitious, ambient-infused art rock.

folklore,Taylor Swift,by: Jillian Mapes,Senior Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f1e2abad421092dd8f6c7ca/1:1/w_160/Taylor_Swift_folklore.jpeg,2020-07-27 05:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/taylor-swift-folklore/,Republic,"The phantom pang of missing someone before you ever meet them is an emotion worthy of its own word. That fated feeling of love and the passage of time is the theme that runs between Carly Rae Jepsen’s smash hit “Call Me Maybe” and the National’s antisocial romance “Slow Show”; it’s also the kind of thing Taylor Swift might write about. One of the loveliest tracks on folklore, the surprise album the singer-songwriter made primarily with the National’s guitarist Aaron Dessner, stands out for a strangely similar reason: a thread connecting two strangers that exists long before either realizes it’s there. “And isn’t it just so pretty to think/All along there was some/Invisible string/Tying you to me,” she sings on the delightfully plucky “invisible string,” simultaneously recalling famous lines from Jane Eyre and The Sun Also Rises. folklore will forever be known as Taylor Swift’s “indie” album, a sweater-weather record released on a whim in the blue heat of this lonely summer, filled with cinematic love songs in search of a film soundtrack. There are those who already dislike folklore on principle, who assume it’s another calculated attempt on Swift’s part to position her career as just so (how dare she); meanwhile, fans will hold it up as tangible proof that their leader can do just about anything (also a stretch). While it’s true that folklore pushes the limits of Swift’s sound in a particular, perhaps unexpected direction, her reference points feel more like mainstream “indie” homage than innovation, taking cues from her collaborators’ work and bits of nostalgia. At its best, folklore asserts something that has been true from the start of Swift’s career: Her biggest strength is her storytelling, her well-honed songwriting craft meeting the vivid whimsy of her imagination; the music these stories are set to is subject to change, so long as it can be rooted in these traditions. You can tell that this is what drives Swift by the way she molds her songs: cramming specific details into curious cadences, bending the lines to her will. It’s especially apparent on folklore, where the production—mostly by Dessner, with Jack Antonoff’s pop flair occasionally in the mix—is more minimal than she typically goes for. Her words rise above the sparse pianos, moody guitars, and sweeping orchestration, as quotable as ever. After years as pop’s most reliable first-person essayist, Swift channels her distinct style into what are essentially works of fiction and autofiction, finding compelling protagonists in a rebellious heiress and a classic teenage love triangle. In “the last great american dynasty,” she tells the story of eccentric debutante Rebekah Harkness, who married into the Standard Oil family and once lived in Swift’s Rhode Island mansion, as a way to celebrate women who “have a marvelous time ruining everything.” Filled with historical details and Americana imagery, you can see the song play out in your mind like a storybook, but it also effectively makes a point about society’s treatment of brash women. Swift cleverly draws a line between Harkness and herself at the end, an idea she fleshes out in a more literal sequel, “mad woman.” Out of all the songs on folklore, “the last great american dynasty” is the all-timer, the instant classic. It sounds like the latter-day National/Taylor mashup you never knew you needed—textural and tastefully majestic, with Fitzgerald-esque lines about filling the pool with champagne instead of drinking all the wine. With folklore’s teen heartbreak trilogy, Swift circles the same affair from each party’s differing view. “betty” is the story of 17-year-old James trying to win back his girlfriend after cheating, a familiar crime rendered new by the narrator’s genuine remorse and belief in a love regained. It has the youthful hope of a song like “Wide Open Spaces,” yet is noticeably wiser (and queerer) than the high school romances Swift wrote as an actual teenager. First single “cardigan” is told by Betty, whose disillusionment with James results in a sad, sensuous sound reminiscent of Lana Del Rey, down to the vocal style and casual lyrical quotation of another pop song. But the songs’ overlapping details and central framing device—of a cardigan forgotten and found without a second thought—are pure Swift, an instant memory portal not unlike the scarf in Red’s “All Too Well.” (The cutesy marketing angle for “cardigan” is reliably Swiftian as well.) And even though “august” is considered to be the third in the trilogy, the record’s most tender, saccharine love story plays out during “illicit affairs.” “You taught me a secret language I can’t speak with anyone else,” she sings. “And you know damn well for you I would ruin myself.” The scenes and perspectives evoked by these songs alone speak volumes about Swift’s evolution as a songwriter. The theme of folklore is a very different way of acknowledging that people will talk, an idea that animated 2017’s trap-tinged work of minor villainy, Reputation. Swift knows her own mythology like a model knows her angles, and that’s part of what makes folklore fascinating if you maintain an open mind: a kind of reverse-engineered “mindie” project, it sonically situates her closest to Lana and chamber-pop belter Florence Welch, but may also occasionally remind you of Triple-A radio, Sufjan Stevens if he killed his more ambitious tendencies, or Big Red Machine, Dessner’s duo with Justin Vernon (see: the sparse and soulful “peace”). The album’s actual duet with Vernon, “exile,” is a little like a Bon Iver take on “Falling Slowly,” the centerpiece of the 2007 folk musical Once: awkwardly dragging until the clouds slowly part to allow something beautiful to build. Swift is playing the long game here, and while there are no wild missteps, the album could use some selective pruning (see: “seven,” “hoax”). It’s worth pointing out that folklore isn’t a total outlier in Swift’s catalog either, or even her recent work. The tracks with Antonoff shift away from the ’80s electro-pop of 1989 and onward, but they lean into the Mazzy Star swoon of Lover’s title track, Swift’s ongoing fascination with Imogen Heap, and a twinge of the Cranberries. There are interesting images, indelible hooks, and real signs of maturity. In the dreamy “mirrorball,” Swift likens the relatability trap of fame to a disco ball, singing of fluttering on tiptoes and trying hard to make it look effortless. “august” is a great, lusty Swift summer anthem about forbidden love, where the up-close, white-hot heat of songs like “Style” or “Getaway Car” is traded for wistful reflection in the rearview. Like the rest of us, Taylor Swift knows she’s had better summers before and she’ll have better summers again. At least she’s made thoughtful use of this one.","Made from afar, primarily with the National’s Aaron Dessner, Swift’s eighth album is a sweater-weather record filled with cinematic love songs and rich fictional details.

George Clanton & Nick Hexum,George Clanton Nick Hexum,by: Marty Sartini Garner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f109a7138a2125dcf2c3753/1:1/w_160/george%20clanton%20&%20nick%20hexum_george%20clanton%20&%20nick%20hexum.jpg,2020-07-27 05:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/george-clanton-nick-hexum-george-clanton-and-nick-hexum/,100% Electronica,"George Clanton knows how this looks, and he doesn’t particularly care. The Virginia-born musician has never hidden his love for 311 or the band’s co-frontman, Nick Hexum, despite how much it might confuse his fans, onlookers, and anyone else wondering how someone involved with the evolution of a niche form of electronic music (vaporwave, in Clanton’s case) ended up making a record with the dude who sang “Amber.” “They say, ‘I think it’s so funny that you make fun of 311!,’” he once told an interviewer, before clarifying, “I’m not making fun of 311. I love this stuff.” That much is obvious. George Clanton & Nick Hexum was custom-built to showcase the things that Hexum has always done well—his gorgeous vocal harmonies, catholic taste, and, perhaps more than anything, his ability to articulate his desire to be your best bud; it could only be the product of someone who has spent meaningful time with 311’s lengthy discography. Freed from the pressures of his band’s legacy and the expectations of their still-significant fanbase, or else just more willing to get really stoned before recording than he usually is, Hexum sounds more comfortable in his skin than he has since he first jumped out of it on 1993’s “Hydroponic.” As a result, this pairing feels as natural as a wedge of lime and a bottle of Corona, equal parts basic and deeply satisfying on a hot day. While Clanton’s music has long been haunted by the digital saudade that is a hallmark of the genre, his maximalist “vaporwave opera” Slide was built up to an at-times-staggering scale, bringing to mind My Bloody Valentine nearly as often as Macintosh Plus. With Hexum, he dials back the scope of the production without losing any of the emotional charge. At heart, Hexum is a songwriter in the classic mold, the kind of guy to put out a soul-jazz record with the regrettable title My Shadow Pages, and the formality of his writing keeps Clanton’s productions from sprawling. The concision of these songs reflects the “heavy positivity”that he’s worked hard for over the years, and which he’s made into 311’s ideological centerpiece. But that discipline doesn’t stop these two from playing around. Clanton runs a dragnet through the post-“Loser” stream of mid-’90s alt-rock, gathering together the kinds of choppy breakbeats and disorienting samples that made temporary stars of artists like Primitive Radio Gods, Soul Coughing, Eels, The Verve, Luscious Jackson, Butthole Surfers, and any number of other (unfairly or not) cast-off artists whose combined aesthetic did as much to define the era as any of Seattle’s best. He refashions these discarded ideas into his most accessible—and fun—music to date, turning a questionable pan-pipe chime into a new-age jam for the standout “Crash Pad,” which Hexum happily spangles with a lip-smacking auto-wah guitar line. It’s as if Enigma rewrote “Return to Innocence” for a Zac Efron beach caper. Though he’s made it clear that his partner did the lion’s share of the work here, Hexum is clearly the star, albeit an unlikely one. While the last few years have seen artists like Korn, Sublime, and the Dave Matthews Band reassessed and accepted as key influences on a younger generation of artists, Hexum and 311 are harder to pin down. The SoCal-via-Omaha quintet have never quite fit into any milieu: They were too happy for the alt-rock boom, too sincere for third-wave ska, and they’re just a little too smart for the reggae-rock kooks—from Dirty Heads to Pepper to Magic!—getting barreled in their wake. Appropriately for a band so closely associated with being on vacation, they come across as perpetual tourists to the casual listener, which makes them difficult to take seriously. Point to their graceful melodies, pop instincts, dubby experiments, and bodacious grooves all you want, you’ll still sound like someone insisting you gotta try the coconut shrimp at Sandals Montego Bay. It’s worth wondering, then, whether Hexum is an unwitting cog in a complex machine built to exploit the subversive joy of liking something you’re not supposed to; “maybe I represent it a little bit harder because I like to get a rise out of people,” Clanton admits in that same interview. Hexum had never even heard of vaporwave until meeting Clanton backstage a couple of years ago, and part of the pleasure of this album does come from the very specific frisson of hearing a somewhat-forgotten icon of the ’90s sing over beats seemingly made from old 7-Up commercials and X-Games soundtracks. But Hexum is an eager and present collaborator, and he neatly sidesteps his own novelty by indulging in nostalgia of his own. He sings gamely about a past spent sleeping on the floor of a run-down Hollywood apartment and driving a “rattling Corolla rusted out behind the tires” on “Out of the Blue,” and fizzes about the rush of young love on “Under Your Window” over a giddy little beat that’s part “Steal My Sunshine” and part “Baby Baby.” He’s spent the last 30 years vocally sparring with 311’s S.A. Martinez, and he treats Clanton’s beats the same way, ducking around the gaps in the production and finding the swing where it doesn’t seem like it should exist. Even when Clanton takes him through a series of nightlife scenes in “Driving in My Car,” he shows up ready to roll, skanking through with a guitar line that manages to sound like Lynval Golding, Nile Rodgers, and King Krule as the context shifts. Precisely because these two sound so at ease as a team, the album fails when they begin to drift back to their innate tendencies. Both penultimate track “Time of Wandering” and closer “Shouldnta Done That” feature Hexum as balladeer, as if he couldn’t quite make it to the end of the album without reverting to statement mode; with its vocal stacks and starswept melody, the former comes off like Fleet Foxes covering The Greatest Showman over a 2 Skinnee J’s beat, while Clanton turns in a half-baked Slide retread for the latter. It’s disappointing to hear them both return to type, particularly given how contagious their joy is when they’re splashing around in the shallows together. Hexum has spoken compellingly about the pains of being pegged as a vapid songwriter on the basis of being positive and upbeat, but when you’re making an album as immediate and easy to digest as this, you’ve got to trust your instincts. Despite their chemistry, it’s not immediately clear what these two artists have in common. But 311’s particular brand of radio reggae has always been tinted by Hexum’s love of the Smiths and the Cure—on their island, the sun is usually setting. As he and Clanton sing together in “Aurora Summer,” he wants you to know just how he feels this summer, because if he can say it clearly, then maybe, for just a second, he can keep the encroaching darkness at bay a little while longer. This is how he’s always operated in 311, and this unspoken self-awareness is what makes this project vibrate with fragile happiness when it’s at its best.

N_O CALLER ID,LYAM,by: Eric Torres,Editorial Producer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f15ca29e73eb49d5fd37bb6/1:1/w_160/lyam_n_o%20caller%20id.jpg,2020-07-27 05:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/lyam-n-o-caller-id/,VLF,"The rapper/singer LYAM, born Liam Harris-Williams, got his start through the ad hoc East London crew TTY, an elusive collective of artists who gained a profile for their nebulous rap-R&B music and notorious rooftop parties. Young Turks eventually signed the group, and they holed up in one of the label’s studios to write and record an EP. While they worked on this record, they simultaneously asked for Miharashi jackets and a monogrammed Prada bag in their contract (as one does) and threw parties in the studio with guest DJs Sampha and RZA (also as one does). The resulting Cry, But Go, released last year, came laced with LYAM’s glowering rhymes over sparse, freeform beats drawing on grime and electronic music. The EP acts as a prelude to the styles LYAM adopts across his solo debut, N_O CALLER ID, on which he crafts a patchwork of grime, Motown soul, and other sounds that he grew up around to match his free-wheeling rhymes on ambitions and anxieties. The album is suffused with an after-hours vibe—drinks, raves, and speeding cars populate his sleek vision of London. Different voices flit in and out: clips of conversation shuffle between backbeats and guest verses heighten the momentum. Some tracks from the Cry, But Go sessions were used for the album, like on the laid-back “Frith’s Place,” where seesawing synths, a jittery beat, and vocals from R&B singer Lauren Aude form an introspective backdrop for LYAM to reflect on a night out marked by jealousy. Clutching a bottle of Hennessy “like a hand grenade,” his mind wanders to his own dark headspace: “I’m blind with open eyes nowadays,” he raps venomously. “Every time I close ’em see my own demise.” Trying to keep up with LYAM as he unspools his overactive mind over hazy beats offers its own potent buzz.  On moody standout “Misery,” New York producer Sporting Life loops Rose Royce’s “Love Don’t Live Here Anymore” into a ghostly, menacing setting for LYAM’s rapid-fire delivery: “Lemme go, lemme be, lemme breathe,” he gasps, words collapsing together, “Look in the mirror and I can’t see me.” When he dials into party-minded decadence, he maintains the madcap energy: The boastful “Apollo” rides a glitchy backbeat cut with sharp vocal samples as LYAM convincingly describes how he’ll steal your girl, while “Origami” has brash London rapper Shygirl delivering one of her best coolly shrugged-off verses to match LYAM’s more languorous flow. The airier R&B songs on N_O CALLER ID don’t land with the same impact. He leans into meandering melodies on “Willing 2,” which floats on distorted, glassy synths and echoing background vocals. LYAM pinpoints evocative details—losing his license to thrill a paramour, again questioning how much he lives in his own head—but the song barely shifts from its narcotized backdrop and cyclical chorus, leading to stasis instead of intrigue. “AWAI,” the clearest pop song on the album, relies on a similar crutch as LYAM treads water while trying on an Auto-Tuned, Drake-ian voice. Yet the rapper seems comfortable in his own lane, and largely pulls it off across N_O CALLER ID. He soundtracks the late-night mental state after a night out when all the highs and lows blur together into one irresistible image.

Witness,Al Wootton,by: Will Pritchard,Contributor ,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f15ee9632da79faa8bbf7f9/1:1/w_160/witness_al%20wootton.jpg,2020-07-27 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/al-wootton-witness/,TRULE,"First arriving on the UK scene in 2009, Al Wootton notched up a number of underground hits under his Deadboy alias on labels including Numbers and Well Rounded. His floor-focused verve and deft application of cute, catchy R&B samples sounded fresh in the face of dubstep’s increasingly murky (and often moodily masculine) trajectory. Tracks like “If U Want Me” and “U Cheated” borrowed from the blossoming UK funky scene and would be lumped in alongside everything from the ill-fated future-garage revival to the so-called tropical sound. Ultimately, though, they formed part of a shift that helped open up audiences to the experimental approach of dubstep-adjacent artists like Peverelist, 2562, and Martyn, who had taken to dialling up the dub elements in dub techno. It’s this hinterland that Wootton, having retired the Deadboy moniker, explores on his debut LP under his own name, Witness. Arriving via Trule—Wootton’s own label, which, in its two short years, has established itself as a buy-on-sight imprint—the album is the product of a couple of particularly fertile weeks in his newly established home studio out on England’s East Coast.  Moving from digi-dub to burbling garage, breaks, ravey chords, four-to-the-floor sunrise anthems, and, finally, an impeccable dub-techno workout on closer “Cephas,” Witness offers its own chronology of UK club music. The reality isn’t quite that neat a journey, of course, but the ground Wootton manages to cover in just shy of 40 minutes is impressive; that he does so without the music ever feeling forced is more so. Sometimes, he squeezes this broad sweep into a single track: “Over,” with its melange of plump kicks, incidental synths, and occasional flourish of breakbeats, feels like a microcosm of the album as a whole. Tracks like “Sema” and “Witness” are more singularly focused—the former a gloopy drum’n’bass stepper, the latter swung 2-step—but connect with the rest of the album via Wootton’s signature airy pads that drift from track to track throughout. The lasting impression is of Wootton’s deep attachment to the UK’s ever-evolving electronic underground. With shared club spaces in peril like never before, the record provides an opportune cross-section of the island nation’s rich dance-music history. It’s ironic that Wootton should produce this ode to UK dance music having decamped from the friction and buzz of the capital to the relatively sleepy environs of Ramsgate—a coastal town on the country’s Eastern shore, probably most famous today for its depressing cameo in the latest season of Top Boy. While for the most part this physical distance is immaterial, Witness does lack one of clubbing’s “What the fuck is this?” moments—the sort of ear-popping tune that makes you screw up your face mid-drinks order and cast a desperate glance at the DJ booth in the vain hope of discovering just what it is you’re hearing. For seasoned dance-music fans, there’s nothing here that won’t already sound in some way familiar. Given the relentless pace of UK dance music’s evolution, this might be taken as a criticism, but it needn’t be: Sometimes it’s fine to have a little more of a good thing. And in that sense, Witness manages the sometimes tricky tussle between healthy microdoses of nostalgia and the rush of the new with magnetic, full-hearted aplomb.","On his debut album under his own name, the artist formerly known as Deadboy captures a cross-section of recent UK dance-music history, spanning 2-step, breaks, sunrise anthems, and dub techno.

I Against I,Bad Brains,by: Nabil Ayers,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f19b891fecda67f048a8c63/1:1/w_160/iagainsti.jpg,2020-07-26 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/bad-brains-i-against-i/,SST,"The hand-drawn cover of Bad Brains’ 1982 self-titled cassette featured a gigantic lightning bolt blowing the 15,000-pound Statue of Freedom that tops the United States Capitol building to bits. Mississippi Senator and later President of the Confederacy Jefferson Davis oversaw the statue’s 1863 installation, ensuring that it met every design specification except for one: Davis, a slaveholder, removed the statue’s liberty cap—a Roman symbol of an emancipated slave. With the self-titled cassette and 1983’s Rock for Light album under their belts, the four Black members of Bad Brains had become highly respected outliers playing punk rock in a sea of their white peers. Singer H.R., his brother and the band’s drummer Earl Hudson, guitarist Dr. Know, and bassist Darryl Jenifer toured relentlessly in a van they named “The Slave Ship.” Revered for their skilled musicianship, their ability to play at breakneck speed, and H.R.’s flamboyantly shape-shifting voice and persona, Bad Brains were a force, a phenomenon. If punk was the snotty, irreverent response to the pretentious and bloated rock of the 1970s, Bad Brains were a lightning bolt sent to blow up punk. In November 1986, after a three-year absence, Bad Brains released I Against I—a gripping, heavy, futuristic rock album that left some fans missing the lightspeed precision and spiritual enlightenment that had become the band’s signatures. Bad Brains’ music had always included elements of reggae and dub, but I Against I was their least punk and least reggae album. In the same year that Janet Jackson injected club culture into Control, Run-D.M.C. desegregated rap and rock on Raising Hell, and Metallica introduced refined thrash metal to the mainstream with Master of Puppets, Bad Brains released an equally groundbreaking album. But while I Against I’s legacy is far-reaching, Bad Brains remain relegated to underground hero status. Formed as teenagers in the Washington, D.C. area in the late ’70s, Bad Brains drew inspiration from accomplished jazz fusion artists like Return to Forever and Mahavishnu Orchestra, but when they discovered bands like Dead Boys and Sex Pistols in a friend’s record collection, they were consumed by the energy of punk. They found similar inspiration at a Bob Marley concert, where they began to embrace Rastafarianism and Africanism. Bad Brains connected with the shared ideals in these seemingly contradictory styles: Freedom, unity, and self-expression. In the 2012 documentary Bad Brains: A Band in D.C., guitarist Dr. Know described the band’s early vision: “We were going to play faster and more technical[ly] than the Ramones, and be more chaotic than The Damned.” By 1980, after H.R.’s father gave him a copy of the self-improvement manual Think and Grow Rich, Bad Brains had also become obsessed with the concept of P.M.A., or “positive mental attitude.” Their early songs were two-minute-ish blasts of kinetic energy that shared punk rock’s themes of rebellion but preached a more positive message. As the repetitive lyrics of “Attitude” state, “Don’t care what they may say. We got that attitude! Don’t care what they may do. We got that attitude! Hey, we got that P.M.A.!” Bad Brains’ P.M.A. was evident in H.R.’s warm, melodic sneer, which was the band’s focal point. He could scream and howl intensely, but when H.R. sang, it was with an unusual sweetness that felt fresh and uplifting against the backdrop of the ferocious Bad Brains. During early live shows, H.R. often performed backflips between explosions of lyrics. He might spend more time moshing in the audience than on the stage. The band quickly gained a local following in D.C., including Ian MacKaye of Minor Threat and a pre-Black Flag Henry Rollins, who recalled in the same documentary, “It was the summer of 1979. Word was that there was an all-Black punk rock band in Washington, D.C. Never seen one of those before.” When Bad Brains relocated to New York City later that year, they became an anomaly once again in the burgeoning hardcore scene—four Black men who played faster and better than everyone else at the mostly white CBGB. H.R. never screamed, “Black Power!”; Bad Brains simply embodied it. Born Paul Hudson in Liverpool, England in 1956, H.R.’s family moved to Jamaica (where he discovered reggae at age 3), Texas, Alabama, and New York before settling in D.C. He demonstrated early athletic prowess as a swimmer and a pole vaulter, skills he later used in his band. But Bad Brains’ fearless, thrashing frontman could also be erratic. H.R. arrived late for shows and occasionally missed them altogether. Onstage he sometimes replaced his storied backflips with long periods of stillness, during which he didn’t sing at all. Rumors swirled of everything from drug use to schizophrenia. It took years of this confusing behavior to discover that H.R. suffered from a rare neurological disorder called SUNCT, and it wasn’t until 2017 that he finally underwent successful brain surgery for the condition. Both of Bad Brains’ early albums featured a few markedly slow, bass-heavy, sun-drenched songs that serve as moments of respite between all-out sprints. H.R. wanted to move further into reggae but other members resisted, so after the Rock for Light tour, he and Earl left the band. H.R. released the first of many solo albums, It’s About Luv, in 1985. H.R.’s time away cooled things temporarily, and H.R. and Earl rejoined Bad Brains to play two New York shows in July 1985. The rehearsals became the writing sessions for I Against I. Unlike many of their hardcore peers, Bad Brains weren’t concerned with “selling out”—not only did P.M.A. apply to every aspect of life, but it pushed them to strive for success. Though they’d fielded interest from major record labels since their early days, H.R. was hesitant to sign a  long-term contract. In any case, he often managed to foil those conversations—in one meeting, he allegedly threatened the A&R man who’d signed Mötley Crüe for attempting to disparage Rasta. In the absence of a major label deal, Bad Brains’ next album would be released by the independent powerhouse SST and produced by Ron Saint Germain, a big-name rock producer who had worked with Jimi Hendrix and would record the album in three days for the relatively small sum of $5,000. After a commanding minute of sludge on “Intro,” I Against I’s title track—a song Bad Brains first recorded in 1980—offers the security of the band’s classic speed. But while the album maintains intensity and grit, it never returns to that pace. Instead, the band who’d already reinvented a musical movement by speeding up digs in and slows down. Dr. Know had spent the band’s hiatus listening to increasing amounts of hard rock and metal, and I Against I is Bad Brains’ most guitar-driven album. His influence is most evident on the closing “Return to Heaven,” where an opening guitar rev-up and Sunset Strip chug recalls early Van Halen. The guitar solo—a faux pas in punk rock—was omnipresent in Bad Brains’ music from the outset and I Against I is no exception: More than half of its songs feature guitar solos. “You like something and your peers don’t like it, so what?” Dr. Know would explain in a 2011 interview. “You’ve got to keep an open mind.” Bad Brains had recovered from a breakup and they’d navigated their frontman’s health issues, but a new, unforeseen roadblock would emerge before I Against I’s completion. During the recording sessions, Saint Germain captured several takes of the band, but in order to protect H.R.’s voice, the producer hadn’t yet recorded his vocals. Just before H.R. was set to sing, he casually informed Saint Germain that he had to leave the rural Massachusetts studio and report to prison the following day to serve out a marijuana conviction. “We had two hours so I basically said, ‘Give me two takes on each song,’” Saint Germain recalled in A Band in D.C. “I finished the recording with H.R. and then he had to go serve three or four months. And I had the one song which wasn’t finished, ‘Sacred Love.’” The eight songs H.R. recorded in those two hours are among his most impassioned performances in Bad Brains. His imminent incarceration feels almost physical. “House of Suffering” conveys the urgency with stuttering, rhythmic shifts. H.R.’s rant in the final verse is an album high point: “In this house of suffering, don’t want but just one thing, got to have my origin, in this house of suffering.” Each phrase relies upon H.R.’s delivery, abandoning his cool vibrato in favor of a desperate fit augmented with indiscernible rhythmic scats. With “Let Me Help,” he offers a plea to remain positive in times of spiritual trial. The song’s final lyrics—“Keep thy heart with all diligence, for out of it are the issues of life”—are among the most potent illustrations of the album’s intended message: Positivity, self-assurance, tremendous respect. The themes deeply embedded in Bad Brains’ music have never been articulated so well and delivered with such heft. Weeks later, while imprisoned at the Lorton Reformatory in Laurel Hill, Virginia, H.R. got a job sweeping the floors, which allowed him access to a pay phone. He then called the studio and sang the unfinished song, “Sacred Love,” into the receiver. “I could barely hear the music,” H.R. recalled in a 2010 interview. “But it was in my heart to sing that song.” His naturally distorted vocals are his most serene and melodic on the album. Were it not for H.R.’s empathetic vocals, I Against I’s bombastic drums and percussive, muted guitars might mark it as metal. Upbeat tracks like “She’s Calling You” and “Hired Gun” come off as innocent dance-rock segues until they reveal the sharpness of their teeth. On nearly every track, the band exhibits patience, restraint, and groove. Despite the obstacles that impeded the album’s creation, with I Against I, Bad Brains architected what Jane’s Addiction later achieved with Nothing’s Shocking and what Nirvana eventually got credit for with Nevermind: They blurred the lines between punks, new wavers, and metalheads, conceptualizing a new musical landscape less defined by genre. By the end of 1987, H.R. and Earl would leave the band again, only to rejoin just in time to record 1989’s Quickness. “The Bad Brains function on vibes,” H.R. said of his propensity to leave and return to his band in a 1989 interview. “So when the vibes are right, then we come together. And when they’re not right then we decide to wait until they are.” By 1990, H.R. and Earl had left the band for a third time when guitarist Dr. Know and bassist Darryl Jenifer appeared on MTV to promote Quickness. On the alternative show 120 Minutes, stoic host Dave Kendall asked with the tact of an awkward record store clerk: “Do you think, uh, that Black rock music is making headway?” And on the metal show Headbangers Ball, a frizzy-haired Riki Rachtman introduced Bad Brains’ video with a disarmingly defensive tone: “I like this song. It’s definitely... Definitely you guys are unique.” Bad Brains perennially endured questions and judgements about their place as a Black band in a white musical universe. That Bad Brains appeared on either 120 Minutes or Headbangers Ball—both shows featured almost exclusively white artists—was unusual; that they appeared on both was nearly impossible. It was a testament to their ability to defy both racial and musical boundaries. In the wake of I Against I, the door opened just a little bit more for Black rock bands like Fishbone, who drowned out their ska roots with guitars on 1988’s Truth and Soul, and Living Colour, the first Black alternative rock band to achieve mainstream success and significant MTV airplay with “Cult of Personality” that same year. It’s easy to think that Bad Brains should have been there alongside them, but the band’s demons never allowed them equal footing with their contemporaries or their successors—many of whom also had the backing of major record labels. Instead Bad Brains seemed eternally plagued to pave the road for them. I Against I was Bad Brains’ most successful album, but it never rivaled those of their most vocal admirers. Beastie Boys and Deftones each took Bad Brains on separate tours in 1995, both rife with altercations between H.R. and fans. Jeff Buckley covered “I Against I” and Sublime covered “House of Suffering.” The sticky riff of “Re-Ignition” is the basis of a Lil Jon Crunk Rock Remix, and although it’s not a cover, the title track of Deftones’ 1997 album Around the Fur is an obvious homage. Bad Brains are a classic “band’s band”—cited as legendary by the Red Hot Chili Peppers and Foo Fighters—but without a tune that the average person could hum. No roster of famous admirers gets at what makes Bad Brains important, because they relied little upon external forces to push their message forward. Instead its members were happy to embody their self-defined P.M.A. I Against I marks a high point in the decades-long career of a band who was sometimes on the verge of stardom, often on the brink of total combustion, and always at the nexus of social and political change.

mydata,Katie Dey,by: Colin Joyce,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f199fd5cf5206bc37d7fb87/1:1/w_160/katiedey.jpg,2020-07-25 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/katie-dey-mydata/,Run for Cover,"Katie Dey’s best music has long fixated on the ways humans fail to connect. On the handful of records she’s released over the past half decade, the Australian singer-songwriter has meditated on fear, loss, heartbreak, and the deep loneliness of isolation. Her 2019 album solipsisters was intentionally named for the philosophical idea that nothing exists outside one’s own mind. She acknowledged in interviews that while the record makes references to other people, to “you” and to “we,” other characters were purely hypothetical. “It’s really all just about me, because I was so totally alone while I was writing these songs,” she said. ""You end up talking to yourself a lot if you’re isolated."" Dey’s digitally manipulated vocals reinforced these themes even as they obscured the literal meaning of her lyrics. The songs, while beautiful, were full of harsh glitches and sudden cuts—testaments to the troubles of forging the bonds of a relationship through technology. Sometimes intimacy can feel just out of reach. For her fourth solo record, mydata, Dey examined similar themes but with a decidedly more  optimistic attitude. She’s said that the record is directly about an “internet relationship,” but rather than focusing on feelings of distance and isolation, Dey expounds on the love and companionship that the internet can allow physically distant people to experience. “I was trying to prove to myself, maybe, that a conversation is still a conversation,” she has said. “That sex is still sex.” Accordingly, the storm clouds of glitches and distortion have parted a bit—the connection is better, so the message is clearer. “bearing” most explicitly addresses the strange joys of internet-mediated relationships, describing the warmth you can feel just from seeing a loved one’s username pop up, or the ruination of well-kept sleep schedules just to try to spend more time with one another across vast distances. It’s a simple song, which only underscores the sentiment. Over a few burbling synth lines, Dey sings with a voice full of hope and yearning, a striking contrast to the chaos and turmoil she once wrung out of her digitally twisted compositions. Even on the record’s more intensely arranged moments, like the orchestral swells that fill ""happiness,"" she leaves a lot of space for clarity—stripping away the fuzz and ornamentation to allow a closer glimpse at the core that’s always lived at the heart of her songs. There are still suggestions of stormy times—the record opens with a song called “darkness” that discusses a desire to hold onto a lover’s “suicidal ideation”—but it doesn’t dwell in those moments. Every cloudy passage is soon followed by a dizzy synth passage or a Technicolor swell of strings. Sometimes mydata offers a tenuous sort of hope, but it’s hope nonetheless. In the time since mydata was finished, the rest of the world has had to consider a lot of the same questions that Dey poses throughout the record. Forced inside, separated from the rest of the world from circumstances outside of our control, we wonder: What do commitment and community look like when you can’t sit in the same room as the people you care about? What is love without touch? Dey’s records once posited gloomy answers to these questions, miring themselves in the dark spirals that can result from long periods of seclusion. But mydata is different; it suggests the possibility of perseverance, connection, and kindness to oneself and others. Dey finds peace in knowing that this kind of love is just as real as any other.

Garbers Days Revisited,Inter Arma,by: Grayson Haver Currin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f19c97adee9688e9b66a490/1:1/w_160/interarma.jpg,2020-07-25 05:00:00,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/inter-arma-garbers-days-revisited/,Relapse,"Summer 2020 is just not the time for a new Inter Arma album. During the last decade, the proudly complicated metal-etcetera quintet have made increasingly sophisticated, even confounding records, turning Odyssean tales into hour-long sagas. Their 2013 breakthrough, Sky Burial, was a brilliant manifesto from Richmond dudes who seemed to embrace Emperor, Skynyrd, and Pink Floyd in equal measure. But last year’s dauntless Sulphur English beat those icons into submission, shaping an inverted symphony of menacingly psychedelic doom and death metal. Listening to Inter Arma’s later albums is like running some labyrinthine gauntlet that may never end—and loving the feeling of finding out. But how many more tests of will do you need right now? Instead, right on time, Inter Arma have returned with a welcome jolt of largely carefree relief—Garbers Days Revisited, a reverent and riotous collection of eight covers that’s playfully named for a polarizing Metallica landmark and their own fabled Richmond practice space. Inter Arma’s enthusiasm for a good cover is an enduring, endearing feature. They’ve taken on “Fortunate Son” and “Creeping Death” for the hometown crowd, done surprise sets of punk standards, and often teased “Hot for Teacher.” Their records, after all, are testaments to musical erudition, gyres of splintered genres made possible by ecumenical listening. For Garbers Days Revisited (and unlike Metallica), they steer clear of the relatively obscure or rather recent, cutting a wide path through familiar territory—from Ministry to Tom Petty, from Nine Inch Nails to, yes, Prince. Most of these takes are pure fun, gleeful selections from a collective jukebox. Inter Arma bound through Cro-Mags’ anti-conformity anthem “Hard Times” as if reciting secular scripture memorized as wild kids, shouting out the chorus like they’re singing to the stereo. They prowl through Venom’s “In League with Satan” with devilish relish, using sinister effects to suggest they’re still trolling parents after all these years. “Runnin’ Down a Dream” scans as the allegiant work of the world’s best bar band. Even when they’re reinventing a song, this mutual esprit is clear. Hüsker Dü’s “The Girl Who Lives on Heaven Hill” is surprisingly apt fodder for their black metal churn. They race through Grant Hart’s youthful ode to the tatterdemalion he loves, smearing the narrative details until only the adolescent exuberance remains. It’s the same guileless feeling that will make you wish the guitar heroics of “Purple Rain,” the record’s loving and lumbering finale, lasted forever—or at least as long as other Inter Arma albums. The scale of Inter Arma’s music has often subsumed their lyrical ambitions, crowding out the tales of conquest, reckoning, fear, and forgiveness that have anchored their last two records. The cri de cœur of 2016’s Paradise Gallows was to overthrow “those men who wish to exalt themselves/as gods,” though you’d be excused for overlooking it amid the glorious commotion. These covers let them clear up any lingering questions. Their faithful take on Ministry’s “Scarecrow” fortifies the original with a belligerent swing endemic to Southern metal; the opener, it feels like walk-up music for fending off what Al Jourgensen decried as the “rotting corpse of inhumanity.” Their breathless race through “March of the Pigs” picks a similar fight—that is, how to survive a world content to use you for spare parts. (Bonus: Hearing a band as meticulous as Inter Arma approximate these abrupt changes is a stark reminder of how deeply disorienting the Nine Inch Nails hit remains.) But nothing here is as powerful, convincing, or urgent as Inter Arma’s cover of Neil Young’s “Southern Man,” a song released in 1970 after a feverish decade of civil rights struggles in the face of racist white obduracy. It begins as a country-rock ballad, all maudlin harmonies and strummed acoustics. That’s a feint for the doom and black metal surges that follow, with Mike Paparo screaming the lyrics over blast beats as if delivering Inter Arma’s final commandments. Garbers Days Revisited transcends novelty status here, reconnecting not only to Inter Arma’s past but to our present. After Young and Lynyrd Skynyrd clashed over their respective regional diss tracks half a century ago, they played nice, becoming buddies who wore one other’s T-shirts and swapped demos. Inter Arma offer no such quarter. These are native Southern sons, railing against their kind with tragically current charges. As the cavalcade of Confederate statues in Inter Arma’s hometown come down, maybe “Southern change,” as Young put it so long ago, “is gonna come at last.” It would be wonderful to hear “Southern Man” someday as a relic and not, again, as contemporary rallying cry.

Seeing Through Sound (Pentimento Volume Two),Jon Hassell,by: Andy Beta,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f188efa8fd5732600c3400c/1:1/w_160/Jon-Hassell.jpg,2020-07-25 05:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/jon-hassell-seeing-through-sound-pentimento-volume-two/,Ndeya,"Asked about his time playing with Miles Davis, saxophonist Gary Bartz once said of the jazz icon’s many sonic shifts, “Everything around him changed, but he didn’t change.” Trumpeter and composer Jon Hassell, himself a lifelong fan of Miles, has embraced that philosophy. Across a long career that found him at the birth of American minimalism and then, on Talking Heads’ Remain in Light, the summit of art rock—not to mention in creative dialogue with Brian Eno and Peter Gabriel—the 83-year-old Hassell has always sounded irreducibly like himself. His tone voice-like and alien, earthy and phantasmal, vacillating between a child’s yip and an elephant whinny, Hassell’s electronically processed horn and its bioluminescent smears have interacted with Brazilian percussion, computer glitches, West African drums, and more. While the scenery has consistently shifted over the past 50 years, he has remained a catalyst for dynamic fusions. Hassell returned from  a nine-year absence with 2018’s Listening to Pictures (Pentimento Volume One), an album of cracked electronics and flinty miniatures. While he had always operated at the fringes of experimental, world, and jazz music, in his time away, artists like Destroyer, Oneohtrix Point Never, Visible Cloaks, Sam Gendel, and others had brought his sensibilities toward more popular acceptance. Leaning into familiar ideas while also forging ahead, Seeing Through Sound (Pentimento Volume Two) is the far warmer of the two works, despite titles that allude to Iceland and Saturn’s frozen moons. In its most mesmerizing moments, Hassell slips into memoirist mode, allowing old tropes from his past to flicker back to life. The telltale drums on “Moons of Titan”—like a distant rainstorm, yet interior as a pulse—will be familiar to fans of Hassell’s early ’80s work like Dream Theory in Malaya, as will the high trilling of his horn between them. But there’s more space for an ethereal electronic haze to rise, making it feel even more dreamlike. “Delicado” and its skipping CD rhythm are closest in texture to Volume One, full of neo-noir ambience shot through with Hassell’s lyricism, cool yet unpredictable, a Chet Baker hologram on the fritz. On the longer tracks that bookend the set, Hassell works with a wider canvas to immersive effect. The eight-minute “Fearless” lies somewhere between Oval’s Systemisch and Miles Davis’ “He Loved Him Madly.” A quintet piece featuring violin, electric guitars, and bass clarinet (though you’d be hard pressed to identify each liquified element), it allows Hassell plenty of space to growl and wax elegiac as the music ever so slowly dissolves. On “Lunar,” each element warps around Hassell’s horn and harmonizer, creating a sound that feels both triumphant and nauseous, as if flag-planting on a distant planet just as your oxygen runs out. “Timeless,” another eight-minute composition, originally appeared on the Dreamy Harbor compilation for Berlin’s Tresor, where Hassell was slotted alongside techno luminaries like Terrence Dixon, Juan Atkins, and Moritz von Oswald. Gently reworked here with additional percussion from Adam Rudolph, quivering strings, and glissades of piano, the piece bubbles and flutters, neither rising nor increasing in intensity, but growing more exquisite as it goes along. Back in April, Brian Eno started a GoFundMe for Hassell, who as a cancer survivor is at high risk of severe COVID-19 infection. Hassell is now out of intensive care, but he’s still well short of his fundraising goal, and one wonders how much more music lies ahead for the octogenarian artist. In that light, the fittingly titled “Timeless” takes on additional resonance as a portrait of the master musician, unbowed and still considering every expressive breath.","On the sequel to last year’s Listening to Pictures, the octogenarian trumpet player slips into memoirist mode, allowing old tropes from his past to flicker back to life.

All the Time,Jessy Lanza,by: Anna Gaca,Associate Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f10b6077984c7b46c68cd97/1:1/w_160/All%20The%20Time_Jessy%20Lanza.jpg,2020-07-24 05:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/jessy-lanza-all-the-time/,Hyperdub,"Jessy Lanza’s music sits just at the fringe between club and pop. Her airy, embodied techno is mild and frisky as a spring day, effortlessly stylish and ever so slightly aloof. With a high, breathy vocal pop style indebted to Janet Jackson, she’s an electronic producer whose approach alights on the clubbier side of experimental R&B. All the Time, her third full-length collaboration with creative partner Jeremy Greenspan of Junior Boys, rewards careful attention to the subtleties of a consistent sound. It lacks the muscularity of tracks like “5785021,” or the footwork edge of “It Means I Love You”; instead, its sunny swells and sanded edges recall the wistful electro-pop of Empress Of, or Robyn’s Honey. The golden glow feels easy to attribute to Lanza’s recent relocation to the Bay Area, even though the record was nearly finished by the time she left New York in March. All the Time is a sound Lanza does well already, and it looks effortless. “Face” plays with breakbeats; “Like Fire” rolls out little siren peals of synth most immediately familiar from Jamie xx’s “Gosh.” “Alexander” and “Baby Love” swoon towards R&B, backed by a sublayer of synth that’s only intermittently interested in moving in the same direction. The opening “Anyone Around” feels deeper in conversation with hip-hop than Lanza’s previous work, and there’s a little deconstructed trap in its loud 808 claps, clattering hi-hats, and pavement-shaking bass. But once the melody comes in, her own aesthetic agenda is clear: curious squeals of modular synth to match the half-articulated question of the title, background coos that underline self-aware vulnerability. More often than not, a Jessy Lanza song is also a sexy mood. Lanza’s songs—the title track of her 2013 debut, Pull My Hair Back; this album’s “Badly” and “Ice Creamy”—are full of understated gestures that sit just a notch beneath actively drawing attention to themselves. All the Time is full of pleas like “want ya, want ya” and “I do want you badly”; even more innocent refrains, like “over and over” or a whispered “do it baby, do it baby,” sound like variations on a theme. “I can’t deal without your love—and I really, really tried,” she confesses on “Over and Over,” with direct-to-the-camera, speak-sing sincerity. And “Like Fire,” which seems obviously sexy on its surface (“You know that I want your love/You know that I’m serious”), gradually reveals anger at unrequited desire: “You’re always holding out/All your cars and diamond rings/I can only blame myself/You burn me like fire.” Though it’s a hard balance to strike, Lanza’s work is sensual, never titillating or ridiculous, which opens space to address other topics at the same time. She describes “Anyone Around” as inspired by the social isolation of moving from her hometown of Hamilton, Ontario, to New York City; “Face” began as a series of imaginary conversations between fellow subway riders. There is a sensuality inherent to this kind of craving for human contact, too. The sprightly single “Lick in Heaven” Lanza identifies as an expression of “cynicism”—particularly its video, in which she wears a magenta power suit and leads a business-casual dance party on the set of a morning talk show. It’s a simple concept with the brightly lit look of the small screen, and a subtler commentary on the environments and aesthetics of “women’s” media, with its many tacit boundaries and scripted models of authenticity. But Lanza’s formula is simple, suggesting heavy emotions with few words and a light touch. Her muffled club bass, choppy vocal fills, and pitched-down, masculine-sounding gulps all feel like the work of humans, not machines. All the Time is sincere so it doesn’t have to be deep—merely an invitation to look beneath the surface. *Catch up every Saturday with 10 of our best-reviewed albums of the week.

Wu Hen,Kamaal Williams,by: Andy Beta,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f10bbae220f3dd395f73ba8/1:1/w_160/Wu%20Hen_Kamaal%20Williams.jpg,2020-07-24 05:00:00,Jazz,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/kamaal-williams-wu-hen/,Black Focus,"Powered by drummer Yussef Dayes and keyboardist Henry “Kamaal” Williams, 2016’s Black Focus —the duo’s lone release as Yussef Kamaal—neatly mirrored the renaissance of jazz out on the West Coast helmed by Kamasi Washington. Uncluttered yet rhythmically deep, Black Focus also revealed the true range of UK jazz; its ready assimilation of hip-hop, R&B, Afrobeat, dubstep, and broken beat set the stage for the likes of Shabaka Hutchings, Kokoroko, and Ezra Collective to rise up in its wake. But Dayes and Williams soon splintered, never building on that keystone. Yet, with each passing year, Black Focus grows in importance and resonance. It continues to inform Williams’ subsequent releases, from his house music-indebted productions as Henry Wu to the group he helms now; he’s even adopted Black Focus as his label name. Following from 2018’s The Return, Wu Hen forges further into jazz-funk territory, staking out a middle ground between the spiritual fire and the glossy textures of smooth jazz, a terrain that keyboardist Lonnie Liston Smith himself mapped back in the 1970s. The songs themselves seem aware of that disparity, with neighboring tunes serving as subtle variations on a shared theme. The needling synths and vocal ad-libs that jolt “One More Time” impart a craggy feel, but Rick Leon James’ supple bass throbs even it out, while Williams’ shimmering keyboard accompaniments find more space as we suddenly slip into “1989.” A decidedly more mellow take on the same groove, Quinn Mason’s buttery saxophone mixes eloquently into swells of scored strings, which come courtesy of guest Miguel Atwood-Ferguson, the L.A.-based multi-instrumentalist and arranger. “Toulouse” and the subsequent “Pigalle” evolve in similar fashion. Williams puts away the keyboards and reverts to piano to state the lovely theme, when he’s joined by Mason’s breathy sax and pizzicato strings. As Williams’ comping turns choppy and James’ acoustic bass runs quicken, the piece opens up into “Pigalle,” which moves the sound into Maiden Voyage-era Herbie Hancock territory, flowing like a tributary into an open sea. For all of Williams’ penchant for blending together the electronic textures of different eras, the in-the-studio feel of this post-bop jazz throwback stands out, feeling spontaneous rather than carefully deliberated. Even Mason’s otherwise unobtrusive horn pushes to its harsher register, giving the song a harder edge. A similar trick occurs between the pliant balladry of “Big Rick” and the disco groove of “Save Me.” Drummer Greg Paul flips to double-time and Williams gets within shouting distance of the off-kilter dance tracks he makes as Henry Wu. As he toys with the filters on his synths, the song evolves yet again into “Mr. Wu,” leading to the kind of infectious jazz-funk that could slot into a Theo Parrish set. Atwood-Ferguson’s arrangements to the set are the clear stand-outs, adding yet another era of musical tradition for Williams to draw upon (in this instance, the opulent charts crafted by the likes of David Axelrod and Gil Evans) and new textures for his group to react to. Yet the gorgeous opener “Street Dreams,” which foregrounds Atwood-Ferguson’s work, feels interrupted. The use of harp and orchestrations hearken back to the likes of Alice Coltrane (a touchstone for the Angeleno), but just when the piece seems like it’s about to achieve lift-off to a higher plane, it instead comes to an abrupt halt at two minutes. Williams’ music emphasizes the malleability and evolution of sound across styles and eras, even drifting into an R&B track voiced by the up-and-coming Lauren Faith stashed away near the album’s end. But the continual stylistic shifts make stretches of Wu Hen feel fidgety, hurriedly racing off to somewhere different rather than lingering and deepening its focus.

Rift ONE,Various Artists,by: Nathan Smith,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f185b5046d8afb5d5fb0bbb/1:1/w_160/rift%20one_v:a.jpg,2020-07-24 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/various-artists-rift-one/,YEAR0001,"Swedish label YEAR0001 originally made a name for itself with rap-adjacent acts like Sad Boys and Drain Gang, but as its presence has expanded, the experimental Swedish music hub has increasingly bent toward electronic music. The RIFT One compilation—the first in a series benefiting community bail funds, mutual aid groups, and racial-justice organizing—features contributions from the rappers who have become its brand names: Bladee, Thaiboy Digital, and Yung Lean (appearing under a pseudonym closer to his government name, jonatan leandoer96). But overall, RIFT One is more interested in the intricate loops and extended grooves of dance music—specifically, the rave culture of the turn of the millennium—than in hip-hop. The compilation showcases a broad spectrum of overlapping and interconnected styles. The so-called “trance revival”—spearheaded by artists like Lorenzo Senni and Ejeca’s Trance Wax remix project—is in full effect on RIFT One, which features a few tracks that Diddy could conceivably get down to at Ibiza. Dutch producer Torus builds a glittering entrance to the YEAR0001 universe out of stuttering synths and haunted shards of human voice on opening cut “Circles,” while Chariot gets the first anthemic beat drops in with “Sky Wheel,” effortlessly channeling the work of ATB or Ferry Corsten. PC Music-affiliated songwriter Namasenda imagines a nihilistic rave fantasy on “I Could Die,” her pitch-shifted, effervescent voice floating above glistening loops and thunderous beats. Despite the label’s collective interest in bygone subgenres, RIFT One is fairly forward-thinking, weaving Auto-Tuned vocals, ambient textures, and rap flows into the sounds of dance-pop’s past. Beijing-based MC Bloodz Boi contributes a lowkey trap ballad with “Mist,” flowing gently over aching strings and the sampled sound of breaking glass. The compilation also highlights a number of UK-based producers, including Palmistry, whose “Basho Dew” is a hissing little piece of haunted speed garage, and Mssingno, who collaborates with HXE on “MXE,” a gritty club track with shades of South Africa’s gqom sound. XL-signed Dark0 works with composer Graeme Norgate—the hand behind the iconic electronic scores for games like Donkey Kong Land, GoldenEye 007, and the TimeSplitters franchise—on “Scrapyard 1v2,” which recalls video games not just in its level-like title but its raging hardcore sound, the kind of thing to which you could conceivably play Doom 64. Much of the music released by YEAR0001 has the feeling of a video game soundtrack, borrowing tropes and textures from various subgenres of electronic music and reconfiguring them. Quiltland’s “Still” has a gently repetitive, bubbling quality, a piece of music that could accompany your explorations of a computer-generated world just as easily as it could dictate the movements of your body in the club. In the same way that the work of Yung Lean or Bladee introduces recognizable elements of American rap music to a new environment, the RIFT One compilation is less rave revivalism than rave re-imagination. This is a blast from another dimension in which the mix never ended, fusing the musical optimism of another age with a colder spirit of experimentalism.

FREE I.H.: This Is Not the One You’ve Been Waiting For,Illuminati Hotties,by: Arielle Gordon,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f18689dfecda67f048a8ae2/1:1/w_160/free%20ih_illuminati%20hotties.jpg,2020-07-24 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/illuminati-hotties-free-ih-this-is-not-the-one-youve-been-waiting-for/,self-released,"Already the dominant mode for boundary-pushing rap and electronic music, mixtapes offer artists a way to release new work quickly and with fewer legal hurdles—and they’re increasingly embraced by pop musicians. Charli XCX’s Pop 2 codified her future-pop with an eclectic network of collaborators, freely assembled away from the gaze of Atlantic Records. Miley Cyrus & Her Dead Petz wasn’t explicitly a mixtape, but by releasing it independently, Cyrus ensured that her fried psychedelia wouldn’t have to pass muster with RCA. For musicians looking to make the best of a strict contract, off-label releases offer an opportunity to evade the pressures of commercialism. Their rawness, real or perceived, acts as a bridge between an artist’s behind-the-scenes creative process and their official output. But the mixtape format wasn’t how Los Angeles studio vet Sarah Tudzin pictured her second release as Illuminati Hotties. She spent 2019 carefully piecing together a follow-up to her exuberant 2018 debut, Kill Yr Frenemies. Her plans deteriorated when her label, Tiny Engines, began drawing public criticism from its artists, who complained of delayed payments and silence from executives. Like several other musicians embroiled in the alleged mismanagement, Tudzin decided to buy out her contract. When she secured an exit deal stipulating that she give Tiny Engines the royalties payments on a future release, she paused the second record and instead poured her energy into FREE I.H.: This Is Not the One You’ve Been Waiting For, a “mixtape” self-released in part to fulfill the obligations of her exit agreement. Clocking in at 12 songs in just over 20 minutes, FREE I.H. collapses the hurried conditions of its creation and the engineering and production acumen of its creator, overflowing with intricate flourishes that hint at the potential of Tudzin’s eventual second full-length. As with Kiss Yr Frenemies, FREE I.H. spans an impressive range of styles, each self-contained within the internal logic of their own genres and anchored by Tudzin’s sharp, nasally timbre. Tudzin has frequently described Illuminati Hotties as a sort of résumé for her prolific work as a studio engineer and producer, and her bottomless bag of tricks is on full display here. Skits and instrumental tracks pay homage to the mixtape format while reinforcing her range: She churns out Container-esque digital noise on “free4all” and layers sound effects for radio skit “K-HOT AM 818.” There’s the tinny garage rock of “free ppls,” the upbeat jangle pop of “b yr own b,” the pummeling punk of “WATTBL.” But Tudzin also reaches further beyond the boundaries of what she’s dubbed “tenderpunk.” With a motorik bassline that crashes into a cheerleader call-and-response chorus, “content//bedtime” blends disparate styles with exuberance and ease. Even further left field is “melatonezone,” which uses polyrhythms and chirps to recontextualize the sounds of Afropop within her base framework of pop punk and indie pop. FREE I.H. is a lot shorter than Kiss Yr Frenemies, but it arguably packs in more stylistic variation and studio maneuvers. Online, Tudzin has kept relatively mum about her frustrations with Tiny Engines, but on FREE I.H., she delivers venom on nearly every track. “WATTBL” features thinly veiled references to “crooked finance,” and “K-HOT AM 818” delivers a word of warning with an audible shit-eating grin: “Hold on to your masters, folks!” The vehemence of her accusations suits the exaggerated swagger of the record as a whole. “Let’s smash to a podcast!” she yells with a gleeful sneer on “will i get canceled if i write a song called ‘if you were a man you’d be so canceled,’” a gnarled ode to machismo. Her spirited delivery eases the tension of an album released under inauspicious circumstances—what could have been a morose or awkward subject instead becomes a playful enemy. Tudzin’s boundless enthusiasm evokes a cartoonish protagonist in a series of imagined environments both real and digital, with passing references to “w w dot illuminati hotties” and “Illuminati HotQuarters.” You root for her not only because of the inherent redemption arc, but because of the obvious joy she takes in channeling her fury into pop. In interview after interview, Tudzin is quick to declare her love for her chosen profession, describing the process of recording and performing as “making art.” Her respect for her craft shines throughout the record, a surprisingly joyful release ostensibly about a bad business deal. FREE I.H. skews louder and gnarlier than its predecessor, for obvious reasons. But Tudzin has a knack for making even quiet moments feel huge. On the smoldering slow-burn “free dumb,” a twee male-female duet escalates into a mountain of overdriven guitars and jangling percussion; just as the errant synth enters the mix, the song abruptly fades away, a spectre of a climactic anthem. It leaves the impression, like much of the mixtape, that these brief recordings are icebergs, concealing entire universes in their shadow.

Ugly Is Beautiful,Oliver Tree,by: Cat Zhang,Executive Editorial Assistant,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f0f78b7763b970f2863148b/1:1/w_160/Ugly%20Is%20Beautiful_Oliver%20Tree.jpg,2020-07-23 05:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/oliver-tree-ugly-is-beautiful/,Atlantic,"Feel sorry for Oliver Tree. For a crumb of our attention, the 27-year-old artist-turned-“living meme” has bathed in a tub of Flaming Hot Cheetos, “smoked” out of giant joints lit by flamethrower, and hung a wrinkly ball sack on his chin for a music video. On some occasions, he sports a sweatsuit patterned like a ’90s Solo Jazz disposable cup. But most of the time, he dresses in his standard uniform. On his head: red sunglasses and an atrociously ugly bowl cut reminiscent of Vector from Despicable Me. On his body: a pink and purple ’80s windbreaker, socks and sandals, and uber-wide JNCO jeans. His persona is dense and unappetizing, like a Twinkie squashed under hot car cushions for weeks. He might strive for iconoclasm, but his aims are very ordinary: He is the umpteenth artist lobbing outrageousness at crowds to provoke a reaction, to sell us something. For his gimmicks, Tree has been heralded as the “trickster laureate of pop’s viral era” and cast as a Warholian insider skewering the music industry. Of course, the suits love it. “You can’t win unless you polarize people right now,” proclaims Atlantic A&R rep Jeff Levin, who signed Tree in 2017.  In interviews, the artist delivers winning jokes like mispronouncing “COVID” as “Coviod”; he threatens to retire, it seems, every other week. In March, Tree declared that his debut, Ugly Is Beautiful, was officially canceled due to the pandemic, and apologized with the arena-sized “Let Me Down,” on which he howls from the perspective of a fan who’s grown tired of his shit. But he returned in May, when a “mysterious hacker” took over his socials and demanded one million Instagram comments in exchange for the album art and release date. He finally dropped Ugly Is Beautiful last week, and like clockwork, announced that he was quitting music to focus on filmmaking. To a generation that’s been bludgeoned senseless by the 24-hour news cycle, a dude with a bad haircut in a silly outfit might seem unbelievably dull. Anyone who’s seen two seconds of a Jake Paul vlog will yawn through Tree’s monster trucks and burning cars; nothing this novice troll does can obliterate brain cells like “They COVERED My LAMBORGHINI IN PEANUT BUTTER!! (prank).” Still, for an artist chasing shock and bombast, Oliver Tree’s music is surprisingly tame. Ugly Is Beautiful is an amalgam of genres like alternative rock, hip-hop, and electro-pop, with most of the tracks not straying far from what lands on the Hot Rock & Alternative chart. The catchy electro pop-punk opener, “Me, Myself & I,” recalls early 2010s radio favorite Neon Trees, as does keep-your-head-up jam “Again & Again.” Billie Joe Armstrong’s congested groan haunts songs like “Introspective” and “Jerk.” Ugly Is Beautiful is bloated at 14 tracks, with several recycled singles in the mix. Tree’s voice—always a little shouty, a little whiny—is riddled with distortion, casting a fuzzed-out sameness over even the more left-field selections, like the runway thumper “1993.” After a while, you wonder why he doesn’t hurry up and join Twenty One Pilots. More aligned with his provocateur image is the ominous, bizarre rap “Joke’s on You!” “My whole life was just a joke/But I’m still not laughing,” he moans, channeling a familiar crimson-lipped antihero before leaping into Eminem-style rapping. The reggae-influenced “Bury Me Alive” pivots quickly to West Coast hip-hop. Inspired by the time he took too much acid at Burning Man—“I ended up running naked through the desert for about six hours and nearly died that night,” Tree elaborates—it warns about the dangers of drug abuse, colored with stock tropes about bargaining with the devil. If you’re lucky as a performer, you can bait listeners with screwy antics, and pray they’ll stick around long enough to discover the Real You. The lyrics on Ugly Is Beautiful indicate deeper struggle behind Tree’s ludicrous facade, touching on the same themes of being an outsider, fucking up, and dealing with negativity, although in the vaguest possible terms. “When is it enough/How bad do you need that stuff?” our modern Marx wonders on “Cash Machine,” a grungy pop-rock lament about materialism. Still, it seems heartfelt. In a recent interview with music personality Anthony Fantano, Tree criticized his label for imposing more and more regulations on his music—demanding first one million social media followers, then two million, stalling Ugly Is Beautiful’s release long past its finish line. “I can’t spend 90 percent of my life dedicated to promoting some fucking shit I made three years ago,” he yelled. The album contains glimmers of a better artist—the way he scoots through genres is interesting, at least—but Tree and his team seem to have internalized the message of a 2018 Vice profile with a URL reading, “Nobody Paid Attention to Oliver Tree’s Music Until He Became a Living Meme.” It’s unclear, as his performance stretches on, how much of it is still of his own volition. The label heads may slobber over how Tree leverages meme culture as “the next credible and viable source of communication,” but they forget how quickly these fads run their expiration date.

Lianne La Havas,Lianne La Havas,by: Eric Torres,Editorial Producer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f10aca2d29c3faac5bb2212/1:1/w_160/Lianne%20La%20Havas_Lianne%20La%20Havas.jpg,2020-07-23 05:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/lianne-la-havas-lianne-la-havas/,Nonesuch,"Lianne La Havas’ first two albums were lush blends of pop-R&B, rock, and folk music, steeped in her six-string acoustic guitar and warm, lilting voice. On 2015’s Blood, the London-born songwriter explored her Jamaican and Greek heritage alongside meditations on love, displaying her ear for winding melodies and a fondness for dreamily poetic lyrics. On La Havas’ earthy self-titled third album, however, she pares her sound back entirely for a folk-soul style filigreed with little more than her skillful guitar-playing and deep, husky voice. The approach serves a breakup album that excavates a failed relationship with bracing vulnerability, in the process revealing a statement of purpose and artistry that La Havas has worked toward for years. Lianne La Havas is about the singer’s whirlwind relationship with a musician in Los Angeles, and a breakup that spurred a move home to London to piece together the music she’d been working on and take stock of her own personal growth. It’s a theme that she’s touched on before—portioning an ex’s thoughtlessness into heartbreaking parts is some of her bread and butter—but here it comes into focus through sparse instrumentation and a complicated rendering of the mental flux that comes with realizing it’s time to move on. “Knowing my head from my tail isn’t easy for me,” she admits on “Please Don’t Make Me Cry,” an ambling highlight that features Nick Hakim playing the record’s only electric guitar. Later, on the beatific “Sour Flower,” La Havas offers a thesis: “I’m done settling for so much less than I knew I deserved.” Yet for as much as the album is about separation—from a person, a place, or disruptive thought processes—there’s never an air of crisis. La Havas is in repose throughout, confident in her needs and desires. “Could make a baby tonight/Throw my life away,” she sings off-the-cuff on “Read My Mind,” a breezy tropicália-inspired song that coasts on sauntering drums. Her melodies evoke the rush of new romance, a theme that perfumes the first half of the album with sensuality. She also took a break from smoking and drinking around the time she started recording, resulting in a clarity to the grain of her voice that shades her admissions with intense candor. Lianne La Havas streamlines her impulse to blend styles, while still taking the time to nod toward pioneers. On “Bittersweet,” she lifts a guitar line from Isaac Hayes’ 1971 medley “Ike’s Rap Part III/Your Love Is So Doggone Good” and braids it with hummed vocal melodies: “Now my sun’s going down,” she muses, rounding out the last word with knowing acceptance, “telling me something isn’t right.” La Havas sounds stronger for the doubt, trusting her inner voice to see her through. On a cover of Radiohead’s “Weird Fishes,” her smoky range reveals itself as a natural conduit for Thom Yorke’s mental discord. She slows the stuttering drums of the original song to a resounding heartbeat and accents it with vocoder and keys, revealing new wrinkles by adhering to her determined simplicity. By the time La Havas arrives at the crescendo, voice cracking over handclaps and multi-tracked backing vocals, the song becomes as much hers as it is theirs. La Havas’ featherlight guitar work is informed by jazz (she taught herself how to play through YouTube tutorials as a teenager), but she leans into knotty folk melodies with equal dexterity. Joni Mitchell’s Hejira is a touchstone here, evident in the meandering turns on “Can’t Fight” and “Green Papaya,” both detailed with delicately fingerpicked notes that trail after each other like ellipses. Her deft skill on guitar famously caught the attention of Prince, who became a mentor and champion of her work before his death in 2016. His loss is among several that La Havas endured while writing the album, something she nods to obliquely with the closing “Sour Flower,” named for a phrase her late great-grandmother used to describe a personal hardship. But the song’s outro manifests La Havas’ sense of overcoming, commingling double bass, piano, and guitar into an exuberant jam session. Throughout the album, each supplementary instrument—a spare flute here, a cello and viola there—lends the music texture and depth. La Havas’ most profound moment appears on “Paper Thin,” the album’s crushing centerpiece. “It’s your life, but you’re not the only one who’s suffering,” she sings, laying out in generous terms why the relationship no longer serves her. “I know you’re made of better stuff.” Her voice sounds on the verge of tears, tremulous and rich with vibrato. Filled out with guitar, drums, and a low bassline, “Paper Thin” is one of La Havas’ most spare and plainspoken songs, yet it’s a showstopper. Free of expectations and radiating self-assurance, La Havas lets each unvarnished moment stand powerfully on its own. Catch up every Saturday with 10 of our best-reviewed albums of the week.

Welcome to GStarr Vol. 1 EP,J.I the Prince of NY,by: Alphonse Pierre,Staff Writer ,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f184d0354d64d3511979208/1:1/w_160/welcome%20to%20gstarr_ji%20prince%20of%20ny.jpg,2020-07-23 05:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/ji-the-prince-of-ny-welcome-to-gstarr-vol-1-ep/,G*Starr Ent.Geffen,"Justin Rivera was 14 years old when he appeared on the second season of Lifetime’s 2016 music competition series The Rap Game as J.I. the Prince of New York. The Brooklyn rapper didn’t win; his fast rapping style—easily traceable back to Eminem—was clearly dated. He continued to put out music, though he wouldn’t emerge in the city’s rap scene until he adopted the sweet-sounding melodic style New York rappers are currently using to tell street tales about pain and young love. In New York, the pop stars who get to be the iPhone wallpapers for teenagers across the boroughs don’t sound like Ariana Grande and Justin Bieber, but like A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie and Lil Tjay. On “Need Me,” J.I.’s summer 2019 breakout song, he follows in the footsteps of the Bronx-born crooners—it’s a bright-but-macho love song over a sample of Mya and JAY-Z’s “Best of Me (Part 2).” By the time his December mixtape arrived, J.I. had officially become the baby-faced foil to Brooklyn’s drill movement—compared to the no-frills coldness of drill, J.I.’s easy listening melodies make him sound like he could have once been on the cover of Tiger Beat. But J.I. desperately wants to be more than a Brooklyn rapper. “I’m tryna be global,” the 18-year-old said in a recent interview. “Global” is a vague goal, and you have to assume he’s thinking of Drake, who has conquered popular music by bouncing through trends big and small, from a Memphis dance rap track with BlocBoy JB to a dancehall rhythm with Popcaan to Brooklyn drill with Fivio Foreign to afropop with WizKid. But there’s only one Drake. Most rap albums, mixtapes, and EPs lose their soul when ripped away from their local roots. J.I.’s new six-song EP, Welcome to GStarr Vol. 1., suffers when he’s pushed too far from his distinct New York sound. On “Spanglish,” the teenager connects with Puerto Rican rapper Myke Towers for an underwhelming reggaetón duet. It’s not a bad song, but why should we listen to half-assed trend-hopping when Ozuna or Bad Bunny are one click away? Nevertheless, J.I. finds a groove on the EP. “Beautiful Girl” is cheesy, but charming enough to soundtrack New York teenagers falling in and out of love for the next six months, and “20K (Intro)” is a standard rapper-singer ballad. But “Love in the Club” catches the perfect balance between the crossover anthems J.I. aspires to make and the melodic New York love songs that have made him a rising local star. The track has a danceable rhythm that wouldn’t feel out of place on a Burna Boy record, yet still has the anything-can-happen-spirit of a night out in the city with the Brooklyn rapper. Because even if J.I. hasn’t realized it yet, becoming the soundtrack to New York is just as impressive as going global. Catch up every Saturday with 10 of our best-reviewed albums of the week.

Die 4 Ur Love EP,Tei Shi,by: Evan Rytlewski,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f1b048c1372d035538047a9/1:1/w_160/Tei-Shi.jpg,2020-07-23 05:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/tei-shi-die-4-ur-love-ep/,self-released,"Tei Shi’s Valerie Teicher was having a rough 2020 even before the pandemic hit. She began the year still smarting from the November release of her sophomore album La Linda, a beguiling but doomed effort that underperformed whatever expectations she might have once held for it, the casualty of delays and her crumbling relationship with her former label. The album’s release was so botched that, for unclear reasons, its best single disappeared from its track list within weeks of its release, a reminder of how impermanent albums can be in the streaming age. Her last best chance at finding a wide audience for the record might have been a tour with occasional collaborator Blood Orange planned for this spring, but it was canceled in the wake of COVID-19. Tei Shi’s new self-released EP Die 4 Ur Love, which she wrote over six days this January, simmers in heartache, abandonment, and resentment at her former label. “I was feeling really sad and pessimistic, and the music all came from this place,” Teicher explained. “I was feeling a sort of impending doom, and out of that came an EP loosely based around apocalypse.” That she wrote these songs just months before that sense of impending doom became global was just an unhappy accident—Teicher had even initially titled the EP Apocalypse, but after the world went into lockdown that seemed “too on the nose.” Those are dark origins for an EP that turns out to be a very light listen. In the spirit of Robyn, Tei Shi’s preferred prescription for pain and disappointment is to dance her way through it, and even when she’s idealizing death—on “Disappear” she longs for “a pill that could make me feel nothing”—Die 4 Ur Love is far and away the breeziest, most upbeat project she’s ever recorded, a gleaming disco ball compared to the darkly shadowed, R&B-steeped art-pop of her 2017 debut Crawl Space. Unfortunately, that pop-forward makeover doesn’t play to her gifts for mystique building. Teicher always scanned as worldly and sophisticated, cut from cloth closer to that of an actual pop star than the indie auteurs with whom she shares playlists. But that star quality isn’t nearly so novel when she’s playing on Top 40’s turf, and on Die 4 Ur Love she’s boxed in by the predictable rhythms of pop in its most down-the-middle iterations. These five songs never sound anything less than polished—if nothing else, they prove she can create a decent facsimile of big-budget pop with a DIY artist’s pocketbook—but they never excite, either. Even the standout title track succumbs to anonymity; it’s the kind of easy dance song that Lady Gaga retreats to whenever her last project underperforms, all bombast and no risk. Every song is too obvious, devoid of the surprises and reveals that made her previous albums such enticing labyrinths. The peppy synth-pop shuffle “OK Crazy” and the Ryan Tedder-style ballad “Goodbye” both cloy in their sweetness. Maybe these songs were just too rushed. Teicher said she worked quickly on the EP, out of an understandable drive to begin her fresh start after splitting from her label (the most personable moment on the EP is a shot at Downtown Records: “Got my freedom/Also I’m making a hit,” she smirks on closer “Goodbye”). And there’s some recent precedent for artists regaining their footing after creative missteps and industry mismanagement. After years adrift, Tinashe reclaimed control of her career and rebounded last year with her best album yet, Songs for You, a showcase for what a natural talent can do when left to their own devices. Teicher could make a record that good. She’s got the voice and the presence to do it, and now she’s got her freedom, too. But it’s going to require material a lot more ambitious than this.

Gaslighter,The Chicks,by: Natalie Weiner,Contributor ,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f076e20ca5f171c3b7713ff/1:1/w_160/Gaslighter_The%20Chicks.jpg,2020-07-22 05:00:00,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/the-chicks-gaslighter/,Columbia,"Without making explicitly cause-oriented music, the artists now known simply as the Chicks acquired a reputation for provocation. To take on Nashville as a trio of unknown women singers and instrumentalists requires guts, and they always appeared fearless—a defiant posture in itself. Seemingly uncompromising, they won over country’s capital with catchy, bold music that hewed to the genre’s strong roots while simultaneously propelling them to megastardom. But lead singer Natalie Maines’ offhand comment objecting to the Iraq War in 2003 changed the group’s relationship with Music Row entirely. What had been seen as titillating spunk was suddenly an existential threat, a gauntlet thrown down in a genre where the most widely accepted political statements are conservative. The response was so virulent that it made the mere existence, and persistence, of the Chicks a protest—one that defined their acclaimed 2006 comeback album, Taking the Long Way, and its oft-punned lead single “Not Ready to Make Nice.” Now the Chicks are finally back with Gaslighter, a follow-up that, for better or worse, is philosophically unmoved. Their dukes are still up, but in the intervening 14 years their opponents have left the ring. Now their battles are scattered, with what seem to be good intentions sometimes awkwardly and ineffectively conveyed along the way. While they’re ready to fight on matters personal and political with the same jaw-dropping technical skill that’s always made them stand out, it’s with little of the incisive clarity and precision that defines their best work. Take “Gaslighter,” the album’s opener and lead single. The exceptionally bright track has the same outspoken tone, vocal harmonies, and foot-stomping chorus of some of the Chicks’ most beloved songs. But its central, titular refrain relies on the implications of “gaslighter,” the runner-up for the 2018 word of the year, for a hint of subversion—even though its overuse in contemporary political rhetoric has sapped the term’s power. While the song seems to be about Maines’ ex-husband, it serves the Chicks’ political position as well. “I think most everybody has a gaslighter in their lives somewhere,” the band’s Emily Strayer told the Associated Press. “But, yeah, it was so weird how it echoes our current administration.” In trying to offer a righteous indictment, “Gaslighter” ends up suggesting a depressingly familiar trope: how Americans oversimplify political alignment by looking at it through the lens of their romantic lives. The trite, foggy expression of the very real links between the personal and the political continue back-to-back on “For Her,” an ostensibly encouraging song that Maines directs to her younger self before reverting to rallying cry cliché (“Stand up, show up/For her, for her”), and “March March,” a performative protest song that name-checks a laundry list of contemporary issues including gun violence, global warming, and underfunded public schools without convincingly engaging with any of them. Notably absent from its concerns is systemic racism, a possible oversight that the group attempted to address with a video spotlighting the names of Black people killed by police and otherwise, released amid protests following the death of George Floyd. And though Maines told the New York Times the group had “wanted to change it years and years and years ago,” the Chicks only dropped “Dixie” from their name mid-album rollout, after those same protests prompted new conversations around Confederate monuments and symbolism. These aimless attempts distract from some of the more interesting aesthetic experiments on the album, which was produced by the Chicks in partnership with pop monolith Jack Antonoff. “Texas Man” and “Tights on My Boat” both strip the Chicks’ sound down to its essence to great effect—banjo, strings, and the group’s vocal harmonies filtered through a pop groove and otherwise left alone is a genuinely compelling new take on the punchy country sound they spent a decade’s worth of albums cultivating. Beachy hymn “Julianna Calm Down” is a signature anthem that’s fully outside of country, but in a way that doesn’t feel forced. All three, co-written by buzzy hitmaker Julia Michaels, also have some of the album’s most distinctive hooks. The group’s core elements—Maines’ singular voice, those crystalline harmonies, their remarkable talent as instrumentalists—endure, and because of that, much of the album charms. What’s missing, despite a team that includes some of pop’s most sought-after collaborators, are memorable songs that stand up to the sky-high bar the Chicks set for themselves all those years ago. Without a clear target, their formerly devastating blows just don’t quite land the same way. Catch up every Saturday with 10 of our best-reviewed albums of the week.

Brightest Blue,Ellie Goulding,by: Hannah Jocelyn,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f107442763b970f286314ca/1:1/w_160/brightest%20blue_ellie%20goulding.jpg,2020-07-22 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/ellie-goulding-brightest-blue/,Interscope,"A folktronica artist who pivoted to mainstream pop, Ellie Goulding stumbled upon longevity in the 2010s with one fluke hit after another. Both “Lights” and “Burn” began as bonus tracks from modestly performing albums (2010’s Lights and 2012’s underrated Halcyon, respectively) before gradually crossing over. “Love Me Like You Do,” a one-off from the Fifty Shades of Grey soundtrack that she didn’t even write, achieved nearly a billion Spotify plays—but the subsequent album, 2015’s Delirium, yielded only one outright hit. Its formulaic songs rarely took advantage of Goulding’s malleable, oft-sampled warble, leaving her with a distinctive voice in only the most literal sense. A half-decade of EDM collaborations and false starts later, Goulding returns with Brightest Blue, an album about taking control of her life and identity—with a few proven hits tacked onto a bonus EP billed as Side 2. Pop music hasn’t been fun for some time, so a quieter record makes sense commercially as well as spiritually. But Brightest Blue has a unique problem: Its suffocating production undermines the more grounded lyrics. If Goulding intended to make an introspective record, that’s not what’s happening musically. This is a crowded, obscenely expensive-sounding album. Though the crew is small by pop standards (including previous collaborators Jim Eliot and Joe Kearns), multiple songs feature real orchestras and real choirs competing with synthetic orchestras and Goulding’s own multi-tracked vocals. This isn’t always a bad thing; “Love I’m Given” updates the post-Adele songs from 2012’s Halcyon, even mimicking the looped vocal riff from “Only You.” But after five or six other electronic-gospel hybrids, the title track doesn’t stand out. When “Tides” breaks through the monotony, the skittering, trebly production feels too small to compete against the surrounding density. Beneath that density, there are genuine strides. “Woman” works by focusing on Goulding herself and how she’s grown, rather speaking for everyone else. It’s hard to hear over the Inspiring, Motivational string arrangement and the Pasek-and-Paul chorus, but there are lovely sentiments about aging in public: “Free-falling through the photographs that paid my bills” might be the most evocative line on any Goulding album. On “How Deep Is Too Deep,” a clear standout, she sneaks in some unconventional but welcome metaphors: “You cast me in your thriller just to cut the scene out,” and, “You wanna wash me off but you want me as your tattoo.” That kind of emotional depth feels like a necessary correction from Delirium, but while Blue is thoughtful and beautiful, it’s a drag to sit through. The interludes have more personality than the full-length songs; the hyper-processed sketch “Wine Drunk” is more memorable than “Bleach,” the song it precedes. Serpentwithfeet’s verbose opening stanza on “Start” offers the kind of quirkiness missing elsewhere: “Every summer my friends prevent me from using the grill/They believe Cancer men don’t have the will/To play with fire.” The other collaborations, concentrated on Side B, can’t match the album’s soul-searching. Goulding gives as much as she can when her duet partners are pop sadboi Lauv and veteran edgelord blackbear, but without the insight of the proper album, all that’s left is underwritten background music. These songs aren’t actively bad, but their trend-chasing is distracting, and a collaboration with the late Juice WRLD makes for an oddly melancholic closer. Continuing the contradictory streak of Goulding’s career, Brightest Blue’s often compelling narrative of self-assurance still ends with an identity crisis.

Hate for Sale,The Pretenders,by: Stephen Thomas Erlewine,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f0e14343145eda8a1c27b14/1:1/w_160/hate%20for%20sale_pretenders.jpg,2020-07-22 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/the-pretenders-hate-for-sale/,BMG,"Chrissie Hynde is the only constant in the Pretenders. In the early ’80s, she suffered the twin losses of guitarist James Honeyman-Scott and bassist Pete Farndon. While her first official drummer Martin Chambers usually was by her side, serving as the anchor for a revolving series of guitarists and bassists, he occasionally took his leave. The pair were on the outs by 1986’s Get Close, but he returned to the fold during the recording of 1994’s Last of the Independents, and he has remained part of the Pretenders ever since, touring with the band even though he sat out every session since 2002’s Loose Screw. Chambers returns to the studio for Hate for Sale, a brisk record that makes no apologies for relying on the flinty rock’n’roll the band has long since patented. In a sense, it’s a kindred spirit to Alone, the 2016 Pretenders LP produced by Dan Auerbach of The Black Keys. Auerbach encouraged Hynde to rekindle the swagger and sneer of the first two Pretenders albums, assembling a cracker-jack crew of professional musicians to back her. If you didn’t listen too closely, Alone sounded like a Pretenders album, but it didn’t feel like one. Hate for Sale, by contrast, feels like a Pretenders album. Maybe it helps that it’s helmed by Stephen Street—a producer who has long specialized in making the workaday combination of guitar, drums, and bass sound extraordinary. Street previously worked with the group on 1995’s acoustic live album The Isle of View and 1999’s ¡Viva El Amor!, so he’s familiar with their strengths and quirks, realizing they’re at their best when they’re direct and unadorned. The no-frills sound of Hate for Sale could be called a back-to-basics if Hynde had ever budged from this sound to begin with. She’s sanded its edges to glide onto adult contemporary radio, and she’s flirted with passing trends, but she’s always centered herself with those ringing guitars. Street gives six strings plenty of room on Hate for Sale. Hynde is back playing rhythm guitar, weaving in between the leads of James Walbourne, the guitarist who also co-wrote the album’s ten songs. Most of the sounds are familiar—“Didn’t Want to Be This Lonely” bops to a Bo Diddley beat, just like “Cuban Slide” did back in 1980—but the execution is smart and precise. Often, Hynde’s words match the sonic onslaught, particularly on the album’s venomous title track and on the glammy stomp “Turf Account Daddy,” but the lyrics aren’t the focal point. Maybe that’s a good thing: when the tempo slows and the guitars fall away, it’s too easy to hear Hynde taking a jab at emotionally aware modern women, as when she sings “Feminists claim that we’re all the same/But I don’t know a man who’s felt the same shame” on the bridge of the overwrought closing ballad “Crying in Public.” Such callousness isn’t unexpected. Despite scoring a smash adult contemporary hit with 1994’s “I’ll Stand By You,” sensitivity has never been a strong suit of Hynde’s, either on record or in public, so it is a welcome surprise for the Pretenders to deliver one of their finest ballads on Hate for Sale in the form of “You Can’t Hurt a Fool,” a slow-burner with a Memphis R&B undercurrent. The track’s understated simmer comes courtesy of Chambers, whose presence is palpable everywhere on the record. Hynde responds to the drummer’s studio return not just by writing the band’s tightest rock record in ages but by thrusting the group’s interplay to the forefront. By doing so, she makes an effective case that the Pretenders are indeed a rock’n’roll band, not a singer-songwriter in disguise.

Half Price at 3​:​30,Art Feynman,by: Madison Bloom,Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f1088043145eda8a1c27d3b/1:1/w_160/Half%20Price%20at%203%E2%80%8B-%E2%80%8B30_art%20feynman.jpg,2020-07-22 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/art-feynman-half-price-at-330/,Western Vinyl,"Who the hell is Art Feynman? Judging by his babushka, bucket hat, side pony, and sherbet-colored clothing, he might be a psychedelic bee keeper—or maybe a stoned ceramicist with his own public access TV show. The reality is not quite as silly: Feynman is Luke Temple’s oddball alter ego (the ponytail, alas, is a wig). As Feynman, Temple seems to detach slightly from reality, resulting in music that’s more impish than his prior solo work or his output with Here We Go Magic. His peculiar character looks as though he’s tumbled through a number of decades to wander ours as an observant stranger. On Half Price at 3:30—Temple’s second album as Feynman—the narrator roams around at a safe distance from secondary characters. He parcels his reflections into subtle but unexpected pop songs that bridge contemporary production with compositional nods to Paul Simon, Arthur Russell, and Harry Nilsson. If Temple’s prior release as Feynman—2017’s Blast Off Through the Wicker—marked his most consistent work, Half Price at 3:30 straddles a taut line between cohesion and the urge to flaunt a few styles. Across the album’s tidy 45 minutes, Temple presents himself as an Auto-Tune balladeer, Afrobeat enthusiast, and skilled craftsman of moody synth pop. The brooding duo of “Taking on Hollywood” and “The Physical Life of Marilyn” exemplify the latter genre, sending Temple’s alias stalking the ghosts of Sunset Strip. In “Taking on Hollywood,” Temple croons through a vocoder while Tron arpeggios and plastic clicks scurry beneath. He sings with the delusions of a fresh L.A. transplant, laying out plans for his “future mausoleum” like an upwardly mobile actor/waiter. (In truth, he sounds more like a robot navigating empty streets.) “The Physical Life of Marilyn,” meanwhile, is a Hollywood noir that evokes the Cars’ darkest hits. Temple reaches into his lower register, coasting on stretched-out synths like he’s driving past the iconic star’s glass house on the hill. Temple is so adept at crafting atmosphere within his songs, it’s easy to see into her home—a box of incandescent light perched on a shadowy slope. Half Price at 3:30 has no shortage of dark and seedy moments, but Temple keeps bouncy pop numbers in steady rotation. “China Be Better” (which Temple assures is about a friend, not the country) is an early highlight. Temple’s clean alto, dry percussion, and buoyant synth rhythms recall Arthur Russell’s “Arm Around You.” But even smiling Art Feynman’s sweetest melodies contain bitter pith: “You filled up my life with madness,” he sings, before admitting: “Now I can see there’s madness in me.” “I’m Gonna Miss Your World” and “Not My Guy” are additional displays of Temple’s pop acumen, both bobbing over bubbly Afrobeat arrangements. In the former, Temple repeats a simple refrain of longing, tossing melancholy with rubbery bass and tart horn patches—perhaps a wink at Hearts and Bones-era Paul Simon. “Not My Guy” provides the LP’s goofiest and most delightful moment, taking cues from the bizarro-pop school of Nilsson and Warren Zevon. That it was written in the wake of Trump’s election is its least interesting quality; what is more amusing is Temple’s percussive use of breath, nimble guitar work, and cartoonish summoning of swamp monsters. It’s a prime example of Temple’s range as Art Feynman: a catchy, compact track that’s as fun and approachable as it is musically dexterous.

Flower of Devotion,Dehd,by: Steven Arroyo,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f0e1f47763b970f2863141a/1:1/w_160/flower%20of%20devotion_dehd.jpg,2020-07-21 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/dehd-flower-of-devotion/,Fire Talk,"One night last summer, at a 19th-century opera house, Dehd were playing in the middle of the room. Headlining a label showcase configured for 360-degree views, the bleeding-hearted indie-rock trio followed their steelier, more poker-faced peers Patio and Deeper. As the latter finished their set, all three bands convened for a cover of The Cure’s “Boys Don’t Cry,” on which Dehd guitarist Jason Balla and bassist Emily Kempf took the mics with their typical on-stage abandon. That night—eye-to-eye with their listeners, hiding no side of themselves, and taking cues from Robert Smith by bending the rigid edges of post-punk with the brightness and zeal of pop—Dehd were exactly in their element. This direct connection carries through Flower of Devotion, the band’s biggest-sounding album yet. Rather than hooking your attention with mystery, Dehd look you straight in the eye, sing you something discomfitingly simple and sincere, and dare you not to look at the floor. Kempf comes out of the gate screaming, “Baby, I love ya/Always thinking of ya,” and ends the album with, “If this is all that we get, so be it/It was worth it to know you exist.” Though it was finished before 2020 came to be defined by immense loss, Flower of Devotion makes the case for reaching out and being direct with the people who should hear it, while the opportunity exists. Flower of Devotion’s sound is tightly tailored to its lyrics, but in a different way than the band’s previous album was. Water, which was self-recorded, sounded thin and tinny, a raw sonic quality amplified by the rawness of Balla and Kempf singing about how they had literally just broken up. But Flower of Devotion, recorded in a studio, goes in on saturation, dialing up reverb and echo effects and adding touches of synth and tambourine to their minimal set-up. It’s lush and inviting end-to-end, even as it gets uncomfortably close. These ringing, sustained sounds agree with the two singers’ fondness for squeezing every drop out of a single word. Kempf’s warbling, exaggerated “bay-ey-BAY” at the tipping point of “Letter” says more than any carefully worded text message could. That moment is one of a few that sound almost straight from the songbook of Roy Orbison, one of Flower of Devotion’s key influences. Orbison—whose cover art for his own third LP might be referenced here, but whose knack for articulating yearning with efficient pop verses and potent vibrato definitely is—may as well be Dehd’s patron saint of heartache. “Loner,” for instance, feels at first like something of a spiritual cousin to “Only the Lonely.” But Orbison’s standard was an ode to heartbreak’s dubious consolation prize: the self-righteous comfort of belonging to a club. When Kempf sings about wanting “nothing more than to be a loner,” it’s an embrace of loneliness’s inevitability and the limitations of partnership—an affirmation of desire, but especially of desire to be comfortably alone. Her voice cracks upward when she holds the word “loner,” like a lone wolf howling at the moon, like Orbison when he was crying over you. Kempf’s singing voice has steadily gotten stronger and more versatile with every Dehd release, and here it’s a flat-out force. She adapts it a dozen different ways to sell a feeling: a cautioning bellow when singing about being protective of her ex on “Letter”; a deteriorating tremble to grieve that “the house is burning, while I sit here drowning” on “Flood”; yelping and screeching and tongue-clicking when that’s just what feels fitting. It’s Flower of Devotion’s primary instrument, alongside Balla’s newly airy guitar. Whether soloing or providing counterpoint to the vocal melodies, Balla picks which notes to play like he’s picking vegetables from the produce section: selectively but without overthinking it, not opposed to a bruise or dent if the size and color are right, and if he touches it, he commits to it. At first blush, Flower of Devotion can feel like it’s missing something. There’s a nagging instinct that pop songs are supposed to have more pieces to them, or that drummer Eric McGrady is supposed to be using more than half of a drum set. Stick with it, though, and something even better emerges from those gaps. By leaving their songs exposed, Dehd show how much they believe in them, and rightfully so. Their confidence in their concision is the best part. You can hear it when they observe the simple passage of time, when Balla sings about a calendar page’s impermanence on “Month” or when McGrady notices grey hairs and fading memory on “Apart”—his first song written and sung for the band. You can hear it when they ask a question, looking right at you: Why do you hide? Do you want to disappear? Is this living? Flower of Devotion generously rewards not looking away.

Pain Olympics,Crack Cloud,by: Stuart Berman,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f0de6e79f0d624cf3ecb32d/1:1/w_160/pain%20olympics_crack%20cloud.jpg,2020-07-21 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/crack-cloud-pain-olympics/,Meat Machine,"The video for “The Next Fix”—the first single from Crack Cloud’s first LP, Pain Olympics—takes its title and subject matter at face value. In it, the Vancouver-based collective roams among an array of troubled characters trying to survive another day of squalor, violence, and sheer boredom on the streets. Their outsider existence is personified by one woman who renders her physical withdrawal as an interpretive dance, gesticulating wildly in a train station where passing commuters pay her no mind, highlighting society’s cruelest paradox: those in the most obvious need of help are so often easily ignored. It’s a life this group knows intimately—some of its members are former addicts themselves, and they founded Crack Cloud as both a recovery tool and an artistic extension of the harm reduction and mental healthcare work they do in their East Vancouver neighborhood. As such, they use “The Next Fix” video not to deliver a PSA, but to foreground the humanity in those who’ve fallen into the spiral of substance abuse. Partway through the video (around the point where the song goes from sounding like a scratched-up 12-inch of Tom Tom Club’s “Genius of Love” to a tear-jerking, trumpet-smoothed chorale), all of its seemingly doomed subjects congregate in a park—not to score, but to laugh, dance, and frolic together in the leaves. It’s a deeply affecting denouement, illuminating the joy, camaraderie, and compassion that can exist even under the most unforgiving, isolating circumstances. That philosophy has been the driving force behind Crack Cloud’s dramatic evolution over the past four years. Initially the solo project of singer/drummer Zach Choy, Crack Cloud has blossomed into a seven-piece band—and that’s not counting the supporting network of multi-disciplinary creatives (many of whom also work in social services) who push the collective’s membership well past the double-digit mark. And as their ranks have swelled, so too have their musical ambitions. On their first two EPs—bundled together on a self-titled 2018 compilation release for Tin Angel—Crack Cloud’s brand of post-punk leaned more heavily on the latter half of that equation, recalling the terse agitation of Wire’s Pink Flag and the disjointed rhythms of Gang of Four. But if those pioneers showed us how deconstructing rock music could serve as a metaphor for dismantling institutional power structures, Crack Cloud provide us with a glimpse of the wondrous world that awaits after the dust has cleared. Not since These New Puritans has a modern post-punk band so eagerly embraced the “post” aspect of the genre, erecting dramatic new structures atop historic foundations like the glass pyramid shooting out of the courtyard of The Louvre. Pain Olympics includes a handy yardstick to measure just how far Crack Cloud have come in the form of “Bastard Basket,” a track that first appeared on their 2016 eponymous EP. In its primordial form, the track is a grave meditation on life and death set to an ominous circular bass riff and needling guitar pricks; the Pain Olympics version retains that rhythmic cadence, adding sustained sax drones and a ghostly vocal delivery from Choy that lend it a more absorbing, haunted intensity. However, Pain Olympics represents a substantial upgrade not just in terms of arrangements and fidelity, but vision. On the album’s astonishing opener, “Post-Truth: Birth of a Nation,” Crack Cloud resemble a typical, guitar-stabbing post-punk band for all of 44 seconds, at which point the song triggers its phantasmagoric swirl of Eno-era Talking Heads, industrial pummel, cavalry trumpets, glockenspiels, and operatic Disney-soundtrack flourishes—a fitting analog for a song that wades into the murky, chaotic waters of modern news and social-media consumption. Meanwhile, on “Favour Your Fortune,” Crack Cloud drop any pretense of being a rock band altogether, reframing their grim street narratives in a manic noise-rap banger that could pass for a Death Grips remix of a BROCKHAMPTON cut. And yet as much as Pain Olympics deals in difficult subject matter and sensory overload, the overwhelming feeling you’re left with is, remarkably, levity. Choy can be a stern, authoritative mouthpiece as per standard post-punk practice, but he also boasts the playful flamboyance of !!!’s Nic Offer and the melodic graces of The Clash’s Mick Jones. From his seat behind the drum kit, though, Choy is less the frontman than a conduit for the band’s collective strength: the angelic group-chorus refrains of “Post-Truth” and “The Next Fix” suggest Crack Cloud’s true spiritual antecedents aren’t late-‘70s British post-punk groups, but the utopian multi-headed Canadian indie-rock collectives of the early ’00s. However, the biggest surprise on an album loaded with them arrives with the closing “Angel Dust (Eternal Peace),” a discordant dream-pop ballad whose dying moments are overtaken by a field-recording conversation with a man espousing the therapeutic virtues of accepting Jesus. Crack Cloud may not bible-thumpers themselves, but they’ve seemingly taken this man’s most salient point to heart: “When judgment is coming around,” he says, “what’s going to be judged is the heart and the kidneys—you can’t fake the funk, man.” With their documentarian dispatches from the meanest streets, Crack Cloud could never be accused of faking it.

Yes,Shinichi Atobe,by: Ray Philp,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f107a5826e46edd3020322b/1:1/w_160/yes_shinichi%20atobe.jpg,2020-07-21 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/shinichi-atobe-yes/,DDS,"In dance music, anonymity used to be a currency as stable as gold. To be a “mysterious techno artist” was to present an alpha confidence about the only thing that mattered: the music. For some, it was an anti-commercial gesture. Detroit’s Mike Banks held that concealing his face emphasized the durability of his talent, “because as a man you’re frail, but your work can stay in humanity forever, like the Egyptians,” the Underground Resistance member told The Wire in 2007. But somewhere along the way, self-effacement among techno artists became an increasingly silly cliché, a Shutterstock image for a Berlin DJ starter pack. The pursuit of facelessness has occasionally cannibalized dance music’s Black heritage; some white producers have adopted racially ambiguous pseudonyms in the name of cultivating mystique. At a moment where Black techno artists are spotlighting their identity to re-center their position in dance music, a stronger desire for attribution is, to borrow a good line from Twitter, probably the energy we need right now. If secrecy’s stock is plummeting in electronic music, it’s been interesting to see Shinichi Atobe, a famously mysterious techno artist, beginning to open up. His new album, Yes, arrives with the same sunny disposition of its housey predecessor, 2018’s Heat, and a rare headshot of the Saitama-based producer—included, possibly, as a response to rumors he is actually his sometime Chain Reaction labelmate Vainqueur. Sloughing off the dub techno of Atobe’s first two records, Ship-Scope and Butterfly Effect—between which lay a 13-year gap and not a single word from the artist—his latest LP is closer in style to house aesthetes like DJ Sprinkles or the late Boston producer Callisto. Where Yes stands apart is in its inherent optimism—in a couple cases, the mood comes close to a deep contentment. On “Lake 2,” piano and organ keys skate with the ease of Moon Safari-era Air or Italo house producer Don Carlos. In the hands of an extrovert, “Yes” might have been called “Yay!”—its descending, major-key piano chords evoke an everyman joy, while a whistling harmony seems ready to swing open a studio door and say, “Honey, I’m home!” However much Atobe’s music has changed, it’s still recognizably his in at least one way: those sharp, throat-tickling trebles that could make a stone cough. They’re an acquired taste. Matt Colton, the mastering engineer for most of Atobe’s records, admitted treating Butterfly Effect’s “bright,” “cold-sounding” pre-masters with warmer mids and fatter lows. Even if we accept that Atobe’s nettling claps and rimshots are a feature rather than a bug, Yes’s hi-fi polish intuitively seems like a less forgiving environment. Somehow, though, it comes together, thanks to some nice contrasts of space and texture. “Lake 2”’s shaker has a satisfying safety-match scrape, and works as a gentle brake on Atobe’s cruising keys. And the mallets on “Rain 3,” which might remind you of a cartoon spider scrambling out of a bathtub, are set amid floaty, holographic synth figures. You may notice that the trebles are slightly softer than usual. With a couple of comparable tracks on Heat—especially “Heat 4”—the effect could be like having your skull scratched from the inside. Where Heat introduced warmth to Atobe’s music, Yes has made it smooth. (Only “Ocean 7,” a Drexciyan étude of questing chords, and “Loop 1”’s echo of Scion’s early Chain Reaction classic really break from the theme.) Nothing makes the case as emphatically as “Ocean 1.” As it opens with an irresistible g-funk bassline, the scene quickly assembles itself: palm trees, Venice Beach, lowriders on an endless boulevard. “Ocean 1” fills out nicely with honeyed wafts of synth and Atobe’s typically elegant piano accents. But the trilling guitar that suddenly struts through, a third of the way in? A real chef’s-kiss moment, best enjoyed on a dancefloor—although the point at which we can safely share little moments like these is, for now, dance music’s most pressing mystery. As for Atobe, it’s funny to wonder whether he’s taken cues from Burial about seclusion and productivity. Reasonably secure in the knowledge that he isn’t the figment of a German man’s imagination, we can probably abide the not-knowing of his life story. But there are still so many questions, the most immediate of which might be this: After all those years of inactivity, how is it that Atobe came to be this reliable, this prolific, or this good?

Species,Bing & Ruth,by: Jonathan Williger,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f0e168e9f0d624cf3ecb3a2/1:1/w_160/species_bing%20&%20ruth.jpg,2020-07-21 05:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/bing-and-ruth-species/,4AD,"As Bing & Ruth, composer and pianist David Moore aims for quiet grandeur. His music attempts to capture the essence of transcendent experiences, like the glorious, humbling feeling of being dwarfed by the immensity of nature, or the calm, gauzy moment between consciousness and sleep. He falls into the lineage of minimalists like John Luther Adams, Terry Riley, and Gavin Bryars, composers that evoke the personal revelation of existential beauty, and there are moments in Moore’s discography that live up to that spiritual and emotional ambition. Moore sets himself apart from contemporary minimalists like Kali Malone, Ellen Arkbro, and Kara-Lis Coverdale in his steadfast dedication to a sense of pensive beauty over all else. Rarely has he let darkness or discord seep into his work. On its surface, Species, Bing & Ruth’s fourth album, feels like a tonal and stylistic break from the relentlessly wide-eyed posture of Tomorrow Is the Golden Age and No Home of the Mind. On those albums, Moore’s piano was the most consistent element; over strings, winds, and tape delay, he made the instrument billow and ripple, causing simple chordal patterns to feel momentous. The vast majority of the sounds on Species were made with a Farfisa organ, a relatively compact keyboard that creates a warm, buzzing tone. Philip Glass frequently used the instrument, and it was notably featured on Steve Reich’s Four Organs. Trading the timbral menagerie of an expanded chamber ensemble for something more barren and monochromatic, Moore is occasionally forced out of his comfort zone into abstraction and dissonance. These forays can feel like a significant artistic leap, but complacency flattens some of this music, occasionally exposing the emptiness of certain compositional habits that, in the past, he’s been able to dress up with lush arrangements. In some instances, Moore has translated the basic template of earlier Bing & Ruth albums into this new sonic landscape. One of his most recognizable compositional tics is the juxtaposition of slow-moving chordal patterns with quickly flowing arpeggios, and on the piano, with its expressive dynamic range, the trick can be entrancing. This is still the dominant mode on Species, but on Farfisa it plays out as a reenactment of Reich and Riley, awakening only a shallow sense of optimism rather than the metaphysical wonder elicited by those pioneers. In several cases, like “Badwater Psalm,” Moore picks a simple melodic phrase, couples it with a dramatic chord progression, and does little else to craft a journey for the listener. Intensity is a crucial component of the best minimalism, but it appears on this album only in fits and spurts. “The Pressure of This Water,” which appears late in the album, is its most interesting piece. At its center is a modal arpeggiated pattern that is woven into revolving, slowly moving chord clusters that repeat for the duration of the composition. With each repetition they seem to melt further into each other, certain tones elongating and stretching beyond their original parameters. Halfway through, a swell of bowed upright bass emerges, fixated on a cyclically dissonant low pedal note, causing the originally celestial chord progression to feel claustrophobic as it uncomfortably unspools. In its last 90 seconds, the piece dissolves into the solemn ease of an open fifth, resolving. It is a remarkably beautiful moment, one made even more entrancing by the tension that preceded it. In a statement accompanying the release of Species, Moore describes writing the album as a process of losing himself in the oceanic expanse of Point Dume, near Malibu, and “finding a nothingness so big it must contain everything.” But sometimes this nothingness just points right back to itself, vacant and hollow. One of the most impressive aspects of Bing & Ruth records, Species included, is Moore’s insistence on recording his ensemble live. In moments where this technique is especially apparent—like when Moor’s breathing is audible on “Live Forever”—we are reminded of the presence and complexity of the humans behind the music, which cultivates nuance and depth. These moments are a reminder that the most beautiful parts of life aren’t the most placid or consonant, but those in which the tangly mess of being a person becomes revelatory.

Telas,Nicolás Jaar,by: Daniel Felsenthal,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f109345cf63693816048702/1:1/w_160/Nicola%CC%81s%20Jaar_Telas.jpg,2020-07-20 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/nicolas-jaar-telas/,Other People,"Nicolás Jaar’s 2020 output so far amounts to three albums which, at first glance, have little to do with one another. First, he released a new collection under the alias Against All Logic, his Beyoncé-and-Kanye-sampling dance project, which clanged into the world like a soundtrack to the last party before February turned to March. Then the pandemic shuttered clubs and Jaar unveiled Cenizas, the long-awaited successor to his most overtly personal records, 2011’s Space Is Only Noise and 2016’s Sirens. Cenizas was a surprise: When it arrived, most of us had only been in quarantine for a few weeks, but Jaar’s prescient music sounded withdrawn and cautionary, using drawn-out ambient passages to explore an expansive sense of solitude. He may be putting out albums faster than we can get haircuts, but the 30-year-old nonetheless suggests Thoreau contemplating at Walden Pond, an artist in lockdown for reasons of conviction rather than contagion. Months have passed and while COVID-19 continues to rage in the Americas, the Chilean American producer gives us Telas, a record in which he continues to explore solitude. Telas is the nominal successor to his 2015 film score Pomegranates, made in the vein of an ambient musician. But while Pomegranates was sprawling, Telas is a taut, exhaustively balanced work, although its four long songs add up to an hour of music. In the context of Jaar’s busy year, it signifies a continued blurring of his various roles—DJ, ambient craftsman, distinctive vocalist with an electronic toolkit—and the album’s deliberate structure and ominous mood indicate that Jaar can make direct, even political statements without sung lyrics or speech samples. The record begins with one of the blown-out horns that Jaar has been favoring recently, accompanied by percussion performed on wooden and metal instruments built by artists Anna Ippolito and Marzio Zorio. We’ve heard Jaar use custom-built devices before, on Cenizas and the latest Against All Logic record. Here, the objects—which have both a harsh metallic ping and a dull, quick decay—suggest ancient sounds, dusted and polished to seem startling and new. The rest of opener “Telahora” and its follow-up, “Telencima,” never command the listener’s entire attention, but they’re full of symmetrical passages, calls that wait minutes before they hear responses, and phrases that sound transposed from melodic to rhythmic instruments. Jaar has mastered the art of changing his stems mid-line, turning strings into bells and back again. One of Telas’ joys is the way he shifts his sonics fluidly and frequently, without the gridded template of a danceable beat. The record’s understatement eventually builds to a striking climax near the end of the third song: a bass clarinet, treated heavily to sound like an arpeggiated synth. It’s the most forceful moment on an album that remains effortlessly elusive, as well as an anomaly that seems endless in its reference: It suggests both the build-ups essential to dance music and the prog-rock influences that slide under the surface of Jaar’s sensibility. Jaar has discussed his love for Pink Floyd in the past, and even on a record as far afield from traditional songwriting as he’s ever ventured, their presence occasionally looms. The last track, “Telallás,” is all denouement after Jaar’s proggy woodwind playing, but it keeps us oriented by employing more repetitive musical phrases than the album’s ponderous middle section. It’s a fitting conclusion to a record by an artist who, 12 years into his career, has little to prove about his range or ability. Telas is not a culmination for Jaar, even if it brings his ambient strains closer than ever to the more crowd-pleasing facets of his work. It suggests, instead, that his various guises were always working toward a common aim—as though all he had to do was lead us to the other end of his studio and pull the tarp off something he’s been laboring over, and suddenly every piece in the room seems like an indispensable part of a whole body of work.

Ultimate Success Today,Protomartyr,by: Chris O'Connell,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f0dca68cf63693816048373/1:1/w_160/ultimate%20success%20today_protomartyr.jpg,2020-07-20 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/protomartyr-ultimate-success-today/,Domino,"The first four Protomartyr albums offered a compendium of America’s collective grief: unending wars, gentrification, the opioid epidemic, white supremacy, patriarchal hegemony—all our greatest hits. The fifth, Ultimate Success Today, appears to address our current twin crises: the global pandemic and the plague of police brutality in America. Will the apocalypse be “a foreign disease washed upon the beach,” frontman Joe Casey asks on “Processed By the Boys,” in his familiar wavering croon, or “a riot in the streets?” But the album was written more than a year before this particular boiling pot overflowed, and Casey told Aquarium Drunkard that he had ICE in mind when he wrote the song. As usual, his lyrics report from a grim reality that isn’t confined to any particular moment in history. The titular “boys” could be buzz-cut behemoths in Punisher patches, Silicon Valley billionaires, legislators whistling dixie as they withhold health care and stimulus payments, or perhaps all of the above: Casey’s dystopia is the capitalistic system we suffer under until we’re ground to a nub. Protomartyr has mastered telling this story through a noisy, claustrophobic style of post-punk. But on the band’s latest, most ambitious-sounding release, the band gets expansive. Recorded in a cavernous former church in upstate New York and co-produced by the band and David Tolomei (Girlpool, Beach House), Protomartyr strikes a balance on Ultimate Success Today, using familiar techniques—throbbing basslines, reverb-drenched guitar, syncopated drums, Casey’s droll delivery—but wading into deeper and murkier territory. After experimenting with some sparse bass clarinet, viola, and cello on 2018’s Consolation EP at the behest of collaborator Kelley Deal, the band took a dive into the woodwind section of the orchestra for the ensuing LP. But this isn’t Protomartyr—now with bonus free jazz!, even though there is at least one woodwind instrument on every track from jazz musicians Jemeel Moondoc (alto saxophone) and Izaak Mills (saxophone, bass clarinet, flute) and with improvisor Fred Lonberg-Holm contributing cello to more than half of the songs. Moondoc’s deft improvisations on the haunting “Tranquilizer” boost the song’s swelling chorus, and Lonberg-Holm’s cello abrades the surface alongside Greg Ahee’s Sister-era Sonic Youth guitars. Moondoc doubles the melody line on verses in “The Aphorist,” replacing what might’ve been a synthesizer on previous records with a much warmer sound. On “June 21,” Half Waif’s Nandi Rose fuses her tranquil lilt with Casey’s baritone sing-speak to peel back the facade of a serene summer scene. Casey has made a name for himself as a lyricist, and his lyrics are, as ever, dense with historical, literary, and mythological references. His “yellow Zephyr on blocks” on “June 21” refers to the Ford car (and perhaps Detroit auto industry at large), as his narrator feels the lowness of what is supposed to be a cheerful time of year. But a zephyr—named for Zephyros, the god of the west wind in Greek mythology—is a term for a gentle spring or summer breeze used to symbolize happiness and love, however fleeting. It’s blowing through city blocks, but can’t reach him through the “windows rust shut.” But it gets darker. On “Worm in Heaven,” the album’s closer, Mills extends a sorrowful note for 30 seconds, setting the stage for the most purely beautiful and crushingly hopeless tune in the band’s discography, one in which Casey turns his crisis inward, imagining missing a chance at grace in life and “cleaning the gilded gutters,” in death. “Remember me, how I lived. I was frightened, always frightened,” he sings, the guitar melting away and ceding to Mills, before second guessing that he ever existed at all. It’s bleak, even for a guy who once wrote a song about the Flint water crisis as inspired by an 18th-century book called The Anatomy of Melancholy. Casey, having already plumbed the depths of sorrow, still has room to go deeper as Protomartyr’s sound continues to become much richer and more rewarding.

African Rhythms 1970-1982,Oneness of Juju,by: Piotr Orlov,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f0df82a100081be06438995/1:1/w_160/African%20Rhythms%201970-82_Oneness%20of%20JuJu.jpg,2020-07-20 05:00:00,Jazz,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/oneness-of-juju-african-rhythms-1970-1982/,Strut,"For much of the COVID-19 quarantine, James “Plunky Nkabinde” Branch—the saxophone- and flute-playing founder/leader of the Oneness of Juju, and through line of the recordings featured on African Rhythms 1970-1982—has been performing 10-minute concerts every evening from the front porch of his Richmond, Virginia home. What started as a familiar salute to essential workers of Plunky’s hometown has become a nightly meditation on global kinship. As the Black Lives Matter protests began to be felt especially strongly in Richmond, with its avenue of Confederate monuments, Plunky’s nightly repertoire has come to feature Oneness funk originals such as 1980’s “Make a Change,” which resonates acutely in a year when radical reconsideration has become central to public discourse. Plunky Branch’s career as a social sage and connector of Black American music is one of the subtexts of African Rhythms 1970-1982, a reissue of the classic Strut compilation. It originally dropped in 2001, as Oneness of Juju and Plunky’s other groups were being “rediscovered” by Afrobeat DJs and hip-hop beatmakers. (Dilla covered the comp’s title cut the same year.) But it feels newly relevant, given Plunky’s role in many of the ongoing, fruitful discussions of our moment: about African roots and American lives; the interlocked musical traditions sometimes known as “jazz” and “funk”; and Black culture’s economic self-sufficiency and capitalism’s voracious need for content. With the flames of “spiritual jazz” rising higher on multiple continents, its reappearance is right on time. African Rhythms 1970-1982 documents a crucial chapter in the history of Black American music and the movements it soundtracked. There are links to the era’s anti-war and anti-colonialist political activism (Plunky had an FBI file), South African musical exiles (members of Juju played on Ndikho Xaba and the Natives’ 1971 Afro-jazz-funk masterpiece), and post-Black Arts Movement New York loft scene (Juju lived in Ornette Coleman’s rent-free). The DIY spirit of Black independent music labels and distributors—particularly trumpeter Charles Tolliver and pianist Stanley Cowell’s legendary Strata-East, which released Juju albums, and D.C.’s Black Fire, which Plunky helped found (and which is the subject of its own upcoming release)—was a major influence. The continuity and interconnectedness of the diaspora’s localized rhythmic intricacies captured here are shown to be as fluid as night turning into day. And the presence of fabled figures such as Sun Ra, Pharoah Sanders, Gil-Scott Heron, and Hugh Masekela can be spotted just off stage, whether in the liner notes (by Chris Menist) or via one degree of separation through the players involved. The early selections on African Rhythms focus more on the drumming foundations of Plunky’s groups than on their deep free improvisations of the period. The compilation forgoes chronology in favor of vibe and flow, while at the same time sketching a cultural timeline of the era’s evolving styles. A 1971 triptych of sexually and spiritually hungry feminist spoken word by Bay Area poet Roach OM, read over the Natives’ Afro-Cuban groove (the oldest recording on the compilation), offers a glimpse of the lyrical and musical longings of youthful, budding revolutionaries. On the New York (1972-73) and Richmond (1974) recordings of Plunky’s first band, Juju, featuring the ex-Natives vibraphonist Lon Moshe and drummer/percussionist Babatunde Michael Lea, that formula pairing spoken word with rhythm comes into sharper focus. Percussive layers (up to five instruments at once) are supple and unrelenting, and Plunky’s sheets of sound are also in service of the beat. Yet they could also touch transcendence: On the epic “End of the Butterfly King,” which features Ngoma Ya Uhura reading verses of a hopeful poem called “Things Comin’ Along” (“There is no time—only rhythm and change”) Juju fly in breathtaking angles behind him, Plunky’s thorny soprano lines rising and Al-Hammel Rasul pounding his piano, McCoy Tyner-style, through a simple and gorgeous melody. It’s free jazz as dance music. Oneness of Juju made their debut in 1975, building on that dance while taking it in the direction of Afrocentric R&B, as played by a percussion-heavy jazz group—one that now featured a female vocalist (Eka-Ete Jackie Lewis) and a more funk-minded bassist (Plunky’s younger brother, Muzi Branch). The “African Rhythms” single was Black Fire’s first release, and the shift in musical strategy proved a commercially prudent one, just as the group’s audience evolved from art spaces of New York to the clubs of the Mid-Atlantic; yet the group’s musical and cultural message, that African rhythms equated to “the truth,” remained steadfast. Here too, Branch and band demonstrated how global Black rhythms represented continuity between the past and the future. Much of Oneness and Branch’s later ’70s contributions slot perfectly between Manu Dibango and Parliament tracks, tailor-made for the disco of Larry Levan and David Mancuso. There’s a full-on house music-meets-Egypt 70 vibe on 1982’s “Black Fire Mix” reimagining of famed Ghanaian percussionist Okyerema Asante’s “Sabi,” originally recorded in 1976-77 as a pure Afro-disco groove (sample lyric: “Get up on your feet and boogie”). Meanwhile, Oneness also fed a distinct environmental consciousness—1977’s “Be About the Future,” a percussion-driven funk number, featured Muzi-penned lyrics that presented ecological needs (clean water, saving resources) well ahead of the headlines. By the time of 1982’s “Every Way But Loose,” built around Muzi’s lightly bumping bassline and another lyrical riff on the epistemology of rhythm (“Ain’t nothing but the truth gonna turn you loose”), had finally scored the group an actual hit (#62 on Billboard’s Dance Club Songs), Plunky & Oneness were also seeing D.C.’s go-go pick up their percussive mantle. (In 1977, Black Fire had released Experience Unlimited’s Free Yourself, among the first go-go recordings.) Eventually, “rhythm and change” caught up with him, as hip-hop and house—a machine-driven bridge too far for Plunky to cross—took up the beats of their elders. Not that Plunky ever stopped—his N.A.M.E. Brand label continued reissuing older recordings, while Plunky & Oneness still drop new ones. African Rhythms 1970-82 wonderfully sums the sound James Branch and his colleagues plugged into in the late ’60s, which harkens to the one that poet/critic LeRoi Jones (later Amiri Baraka) predicted as “Unity Music” in his 1966 essay “The Changing Same”: a “Black Music which is religious and secular.” Jones foresaw …“a social spiritualism” that would resolve all the “artificial oppositions” in Black music, and include “all the rhythms, all the yells and cries, all that information about the world, the Black ommmmmmmmmmmmmmmm, opening and entering.” Plunky’s still playing it on his Richmond front porch.

XOXO,The Jayhawks,by: Elizabeth Nelson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f0740a2b5eac201573c5340/1:1/w_160/XOXO_The%20Jayhawks.jpg,2020-07-20 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/the-jayhawks-xoxo/,Sham,"Minnesota’s durably excellent Jayhawks have existed long enough to run the gamut from insurgent roots-rock heroes to their current stature as pantheonic middle-age warhorses, all without ever changing much about their Poco-meets-the-Faces first principles. More than three decades from their debut, XOXO, the band’s 11th studio album, is a distillation of their manifold strengths, executed with the subtle precision of a one-time power pitcher who now gets by on off-speed stuff and guile. XOXO is largely comprised of pastoral, shopworn accounts of American beauty curdling into something coarser and sadder, the personal indignities of aging merging with the endless discouragements of our cultural and political moment. The haunting ballad “Homecoming” penned by founding member and functional bandleader Gary Louris, strikes a fatalistic note in an opening couplet that could apply to everything from climate change to encroaching mortality: “Yeah, the room is closing in/The air is getting thicker/It’s hard for me to breathe.” Elsewhere, “Ruby,” written and sung by keyboardist Karen Grotberg, is a piano-based character sketch evoking Van Morrison’s Veedon Fleece by way of Sandy Denny’s enchanted folk, an opulent melody suffused with last-day-of-Summer melancholy. The number of different voices featured on XOXO reflects the more collaborative measures taken during the Jayhawks’ writing process, with all four members taking on lead vocal duties at different points over the course of the LP’s 12 tracks. It’s a calculated risk that winds up working, suggesting something like the Byrds’ brilliantly successful full-scale reinvention Sweetheart of the Rodeo or even the Lindsay and Stevie version of Fleetwood Mac. When the seething Grotberg composition “Across My Field” gives way to the insouciant disco of Louris and drummer Tim O’Reagan’s “Little Victories”, it has the character of a quiet evening at home that suddenly turns into a debauched shore leave weekend. One Jayhawks anomaly is their periodic weakness for ersatz chamber music taken to unrewarding ends. On XOXO it appears in the form of the ponderous four-and-a-half-minute “Illuminate”, a song apparently dedicated to making monkeys of Trump supporters while simultaneously making a very thin, or at least elliptical case against him. Much better is O’Reagan’s unambiguous “All The Young Dudes” sequel “Society Pages,” a psychedelic public service announcement that asks the ultimate litmus question: “Are you here/For all the young queers?” While the prevailing mood of XOXO is world-weary resignation, sprightly tracks like the Burrito Brothers-style scarlet woman homage “Bitter Pill” and the exhilarating Radio City-inspired power trash of “Dogtown Days” go some lengths to demonstrate that the Jayhawks remain rough and ready as ever. Long purveyors of old-soul music, they've now persevered long enough to render their timeless melodies with the finely-honed perspective of genuine old souls. XOXO is a battle-scarred but unbroken collection, worthy of being filed alongside venerable mid-career milestones like Wildflowers and Time Out of Mind. Once counted as standard-bearers for the prefabricated genre known as “Americana,” the Jayhawks’ mosaic of woozy memory and wooly panache now comprises a version of American music all their own, stretching out endlessly like a Midwestern summer's night.

Youth of America,Wipers,by: Stacey Anderson,Senior Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f08d7d1100081be064385dd/1:1/w_160/Youth%20of%20America_Wipers.jpg,2020-07-19 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/wipers-youth-of-america/,Park Avenue,"When Greg Sage roars “it’s no fair” midway through Youth of America, the vowels long and colicky, it’s not exactly a noble moment. Complaining about unfairness rarely is, because even if it’s accurate, it’s still a badge of comfort. “No fair” are petulant words, stagnant words, the conclusion of people who have set up camp in their perceived burdens. “No fair” is not a phrase of a revolution, because fairness is built on shifting sands; it’s not as steely a protest as “unjust” or “wrong.” And the people to whom life truly has been cruelest don’t have the time to complain about it; they’re too busy trying to outmaneuver the system that failed them. Now that’s no fair. Ronald Reagan talked about fairness a lot. When he wasn’t dismantling corporate accountability, scorning the AIDS crisis, or staging pre-Trumpian dog-whistling rallies, he loved to harangue his audience about what was truly fair. “With the idealism and fair play which are the core of our system and our strength,” he intoned in his January 1981 inaugural address, “we can have a strong and prosperous America at peace with itself and the world.” In his second inaugural address, in 1985, he talked with a sepia-toned sentimentality about generals dying at Valley Forge, Lincoln pacing the White House, and a lonesome Wild West settler singing the song of America, one “hopeful, big-hearted, idealistic, daring, decent, and fair.” When Portland’s Wipers released their second album in May 1981, the shadow of Reagan’s conservatism was only beginning to spread. But the writing was on the wall: He’d spent his first 100 days shoving through so many revisions to tax policy and restrictions on federal power, he was accused of effectively squashing the concept of an activist government full stop. The sense of selfishness was demoralizing. An anticipatory static filled the air; the specter of “no future,” that familiar credo of punk, wore a Windsor knot. By this time, also, the “youth” in question had already heard plenty of punk—enough for its most stinging, mutinous qualities to have calcified into a formula. Punk, while still radical in its political messaging, was moving decisively in one direction: shorter, faster. Not everyone was pushing out 21 songs in 35 minutes, like the overachievers in Wire, but bands were doggedly dispatching songs quicker than the punk class before them; this included Wipers’ 1980 debut, Is This Real?, which followed all the spiny punk tropes and, upon release, sank without a ripple. Down in Los Angeles, a movement was brewing around Black Flag, who were about to shift the median with their debut album, Damaged, and its songs barely over the 3-minute mark. It didn’t take a Rimbaud scholar to see that gloomy, 10-minute, Krautrock-inspired songs would be a tough sell in the early-’80s punk economy. But Sage, a scientific-minded contrarian—he’d started building recording equipment and playing guitar in the third grade after seeing a movie about Thomas Edison—tested his hypothesis anyway. And on Youth of America, Wipers all but acknowledge the absurdity of their approach. You hear every roll of the dice, and the slight inhale of disbelief after they land; it builds the train while it’s already in motion, laying each link of track just before derailment. Punk had never quite shown its seams like this before, its questioning of itself and its construction; it had never felt like such a righteous search for answers that was more concerned with asking the questions. The simultaneously thriving post-punk and no wave scenes had also taken mallets to the conventions of punk, but they’d had no problem casting aside the politics and guitars, as well. In Youth of America’s six grim, unhurried songs, Sage is weighed by his own dilemmas and asks them overtly: How can he change? What of this world is worth saving, and what possible advice can be wrung from that stone for the next generation? What can be said of this violent country as it enters a new era of turning that contempt inward? Why did he take on this role, anyway, and when will he finally cross the rubicon where his listeners need to save themselves by rebelling against him, already a geriatric punk at 29 years old? Mirroring Sage’s outlier status: Portland itself. Far removed from the switchboards of American punk—New York, D.C., L.A.—the Pacific Northwest wouldn’t become a rock destination for another decade. Until a Wipers superfan named Kurt Cobain threw a baby into a swimming pool (and copied Sage’s penchant for flannel), the scene was off the grid; it was filled with D.I.Y. savants like Sage who disdained conformity and showed it with clever, cutting music they had no intention to scale. (When the Seattle scene exploded in the early ’90s, and A&R execs descended on seemingly every band in a 200-mile radius, Sage still refused to follow the “grunge” slipstream, famously turning down an opening tour slot for Nirvana.) It was truly a place of creativity for purpose, not product. To understand Youth of America, it’s best to start at the conclusion. “When It’s Over”—a clear mission statement on the album across a blasphemous six minutes—is, in many ways, the most insurrectionist track on the album: It opens with over three minutes of an anxious, abrasive instrumental. Sage’s guitar wields full narrative reign—his chords open brashly, in the type of rapid churn that Buzzcocks and Stiff Little Fingers mastered. But then, in a surprising upheaval, he adds longer, musing tones that challenge the air over Dave Koupal’s bass and Brad Naish’s drums; soon the guitar has its own wandering spirit, its own melodic refrain, building its power in a direct nod to motorik momentum. The instrument is a clearly defined character, demanding its own experience. Hearing it feels like opening a window and letting cool air rush in—there was space in punk songs for this, all along? For a full single’s worth of exploratory eloquence from a lead guitar? And for all its wandering, the guitar’s thick, tetchy distortion never wobbles; Sage built his own recording equipment to achieve that steadiness, including his own vacuum tube direct boxes. Minutes into “When It’s Over,” when the guitar cedes to Sage’s voice, the transition is abrupt enough to almost feel bashful, a second-guessing of the kind of ego that allowed that irreverent open; piano supports his low, Bauhaus-worthy gothic grumble, so deep the ear must strain to make out his laments. “In the land of dreams, I find myself sober/Wonder when it’ll all be over,” he moans. When the guitar skitters back in, it’s at first noisy yet deferential to the words, clanging back on its first motif with tinny, sinister restraint; it feels like a dramatic battle between instrument and vocalist, a battle for the soul of the track—and perhaps the listener’s, too. The stakes rise and never resolve; Naish adds a clawing, claustrophobic pulse. The guitar ultimately regains its full audacity—mirroring Sage’s voice while it also gains intensity, screaming, “Will you be laughing when it’s over?”—and the song ends on its miserable questions, asked at a fever pitch. Nothing is solved. Tensions end flared. Of the available ways to convey numb detachment from society—many already explored by the inaugural ’77 punk class, from self-identified brothers from Queens to trussed-up hucksters from London—the exhausted disdain in Sage’s voice stands apart. His words on the comparatively poppy “Taking Too Long” offer more of a quiet, paternal disappointment than a scolding. “What was coming from the sky?” Sage demands. Missile or omen, the result is immutable: “You never, ever change your mind.” It’s almost graceful at times in its sour melody, a pinch of sugar dissolving into acid. Throughout the song, it feels like some active condemnation will follow—what was the point of punk if not to call out hypocrites overtly?—but it never comes. Of course, posting questions and passing judgments alone can backfire. Sage seems to acknowledge this on “Pushing the Extreme,” which has a taunting, declaratory quality absent from much of Youth of America. It’s macabre in a slightly cartoonish way, and makes its most obvious overtures to fully igniting a class war. “Through your mirror there is such vanity/Through the light, it broke to me,” Sage sings, scolding some Patrick Bateman wannabe over ghostly percussive mixing that shoots cymbals around like shrapnel. The sentiment is mirrored with even more gothic intonation in the unapologetically bratty “No Fair,” in which Sage mutters at the rising ruling class—“Take a piece of our lives, didn’t think we’d care?”—over Koupal’s bleeding basslines. In 1981, all the ascendant yuppies—their avarice, selfishness, and pinstripe suits—were prescient targets. This was well before the era would earn its “Decade of Greed” shorthand for its many braided strains of gluttony. And the approach also cuts succinctly into Sage, Koupal, and Naish’s overriding ethos of Youth of America: Rise up now or face your doom. There’d been many hollow promises of better futures by the ’80s, but the decade’s problems demanded swift and decisive rebellion. In Youth of America’s title track, Sage yells to a generation, his voice raw and unaltered, “The walls are coming down/The walls are crumbling down on you.” It’s somehow simultaneously modest and hubristic to suggest his most useful role is at a lectern, that he is the one who must awaken that fury in others. Amid the deep, convulsing distortion of bass and guitar, he adds a stark political science lesson: “They attack you from the right side/Down the left side.” But that distance quickly collapses: “It is time we rectify this now/ We've got to heal it now.” The track likewise threatens to collapse on itself midway, in spirals of funhouse feedback and ghostly echoes of melody that suggest psychotropics and exhaustion in equal measure. The post-punk freefall stretches and seethes for nearly two indulgent minutes before the floor drops out, leaving only minimal bass and guitar; Sage stomps back to the mic to intone more civics: “The rich get richer and the poorer get poorer. Now there’s no place to go,” he mutters dourly. The track’s remaining five minutes are an inversion of the kraut- and psych-rock leanings from earlier in the record, when repetition bred power. In “Youth of America,” pointedly, repetition only underscores the futility of inaction: What could these kids expect, if they did nothing? More of the same diminishing returns: Sage groans the title, and his guitar sputters out strangled, pitiful half-lives of the previously robust melody. Koupal and Naish’s rhythm section’s stevedore bass section falters. The third act crumbles exactly as the narrator predicted, leaving the audience to stew in their own complicity. It’s a frantic prophecy of undoing that simply wouldn’t translate to brevity; “Youth of America” defends every moment of its 10 minutes and 27 seconds, maintaining its fearsome intensity and leaving an ominous chill in its wake. For all of Youth of America’s vigor, its informed despair and pleas for action, the plundering decade ahead continued apace. Wipers’ refusal to follow the punk tides came at a cost; audiences slept on the album in America and most of Europe, despite John Peel’s ardent support; Sage moved to Arizona for no other reason than he liked how it looked from the freeway. Moored in the still-sleepy Pacific Northwest scene, ahead of its time and removed from any notions of commercial viability, it would take years for the record’s now-devoted cult to assemble. But then, sparking widespread, telegenic insurrection isn’t exactly a fair rubric for an album; revolution can be less an eruption than a lighthouse beacon, shining in every direction until it exposes those brave enough to make the journey. The liberation from dark authority Sage begs for isn’t owed; it must be achieved through hardship. Listening to Youth of America today, it still feels like the roar of incoming unrest, of the better world that will have space to rise once we refuse to bow to undeserved power.

Life on Earth EP,Summer Walker,by: Mankaprr Conteh,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f076fafdc55f46b46324615/1:1/w_160/Life%20on%20Earth%20EP_Summer%20Walker.jpg,2020-07-18 05:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/summer-walker-life-on-earth-ep/,LVRNInterscope,"Watching Summer Walker spray and wipe down a pole in the video for her Over It single “Stretch You Out,” you see three of her lives colliding. Before she became a sought-after singer, she was a janitorial entrepreneur offering $25 fridge-cleaning deals; before that, she danced at an Atlanta strip club. Over It, her successful debut studio album, solidified her place in contemporary R&B with a mix of moody trap-soul, ’90s nostalgia, and singer-songwriter charm. Walker’s music works through identity and relationships with candor, and her autobiographical lyrics strike at the heart of being in and out of love with others and yourself. Her follow-up Life on Earth EP offers a quick tour through Walker’s world—a couple sultry strip club joints, a couple guitar-led ballads, a playful reunion with PARTYNEXTDOOR—but on this trip, the endearingly keen insights into sex, love, and self are harder to find. Walker’s first big hit was the remix to “Girls Need Love,” a gentle antidote to slut-shaming, which earned its popularity with a Drake assist. Her vulnerability drew out some of the most tender and understanding bars from a man who’s been rapping about women for more than a decade. On Life on Earth, three out of five tracks have features, all by men, but the guests are less captivating. New York newcomer NO1-NOAH appears on both the sensual “SWV” and “White Tee,” and doesn’t add much to either. On “SWV,” he meets Walker’s delicate trills with flat, Auto-Tuned singing, taking up space she could have used to expound on the loose ideas around wealth, isolation, and desire in her first verse. They’re a stronger pairing on “White Tee,”  where Walker meets NO1’s Nav-ish vocal with a sing-talking performance as a money-hungry sex kitten. He plays her target trick. Still, Walker vividly embodies the role—“I throw my lil’ fits, I talk my lil’ shit, and I always be getting my way,” she purrs—while his cool act feels uninspired. That’s not to say her talents are fully deployed here, either. Walker’s vocals are as pristine as ever when she leans into them, and her rap-like cadences on “White Tee” and “My Affection” are cute and bouncy. Her verses, though, are rarely as tight and clear as in her previous work. Walker can be incredibly direct, telling a lover that they’re passionless, that they’re out of their league, or that they’re missed with precision and poetry. Lines like, “Days gettin’ longer/And drugs been gettin’ hard to find,” on “My Affection,” or “I want to give in but scared to rely,” on “Deeper,” show traces of her usual thoughtfulness, but they arrive buried in scattered or shallow ideas about romance, fear, and regret. “My Affection” is the EP’s most fun moment, allowing Walker and PARTYNEXTDOOR to feed off one another’s boasts about growing and glowing up, huffing and sighing over incessant, rhythmic ringing. Opener “Let It Go,” though, is its most emotional, and comes closest to tapping into the frankness and introspection of Walker’s older music. She’s ethereal over live instrumentation, as on her first EP, Clear, and on “Let It Go,” an acoustic guitar radiates over subtle, programmed percussion. Walker has always had prescriptions for good relationships (“When you have somethin’, you treat it good/And you want it bad and you need it”) while finding herself in messier ones (here, she describes a partner calling the police because she tried to leave). Such beautiful and crushing truths from a “weird” young woman trying to make sense of her experiences create a special kind of R&B.

Violence in a Quiet Mind,Haux,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f0ddc5a26e46edd30202fa3/1:1/w_160/Violence%20in%20a%20Quiet%20Mind_haux.jpg,2020-07-18 05:00:00,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/haux-violence-in-a-quiet-mind/,Color Study,"You don’t need to pore over the lyrics or backstory of Haux’s Violence in a Quiet Mind to grasp that it’s about depression. It’s right there in Woodson Black’s high, hushed voice, which quakes with swallowed sobs. It’s in his disorienting arrangements—the guitar too close, the drums and synths too far away, constructing a world in which everything intrudes but nothing can be touched. It’s in the persistent unease that haunts his gentle songs, and how even their crescendos suggest a filament flaring brightest the moment before it burns out. Of course, it’s also in the lyrics, which teem with solitudes and stings as Black reviews painful childhood memories through the lens of lasting vulnerability they instilled. “You’ll never be safe, you’ll never be whole,” he admonishes on “Hold On,” wrenching the syllables through the tiniest aperture of breath. Then, over the course of a subdued but captivating album, he sets out to prove himself wrong. Violence in a Quiet Mind deals with death, addiction and generational trauma, yet it feels uplifting, not depressing. It asks a profound question: Music can always make you feel better, but can it ever make you healed? Black, who lives in the Berkshires, grew up in rural Massachusetts. His previous work as Haux consists of two EPs, where his R&B-flecked indie electro-pop was easy enough to situate among The xx and Active Child. But Violence in a Quiet Mind is harder to pin down. It has something of the Antlers’ fragile pageantry, of Mas Ysa’s mottled glow, of Bon Iver’s digital forestry. If you remember when Xiu Xiu’s Jamie Stewart made small, harrowing, beautiful songs like “Fabulous Muscles,” then Black might be his benevolent twin. But such comparisons only touch on the immersive, subtle sound that Black has developed with producers Jamie Macneal and Thomas Bartlett (aka Doveman). Most of the songs are built around close-mic’d acoustic guitar figures, which Black clads in gauzy synths as if he’s dressing a wound. The guitars are plain but rich in character, emphasizing a woody tone and the texture of calluses scraping ridged strings. They serve as material facts for Black to cling to in the vaporous swirl of his voice and emotions. Sparse percussion, provided by Dean Sharenow and Joe Montague, steals in discreetly if at all, while Bartlett’s piano picks a broken path through the shifting patterns of light and shadow. The quiet intensity is never broken, lending small fluctuations large effects, yet Black nudges all this focused stasis toward change, which depression makes a synonym for relief. When Violence begins with “Hold On,” it’s like all Black can muster is miles of reverb and wisps of music, tenuously held together with stray pins of desperation and will. The next few songs fill out the interior definition, and halfway through, the album hits a new stride. On “Heavy,” probably the crowd-pleaser—you can already hear him doing it solo for encores—the bass and percussion, no longer subterranean rumbles and gusts, slip into a pocket with some swing and romance. The Rhye vibes develop further via the propulsive dream-folk of “Craving,” which flourishes into “Eight,” a lovely duet with Rosie Carney that evokes long-shut curtains being thrown open. Music can be many kinds of medicine: analgesic, anesthetic, emetic. But even as it soothes, Violence in a Quiet Mind is more concerned with demonstrating how it feels to get better. It takes patience, attention, and self-awareness, qualities Black’s music amply displays. As he pours his tempests into chipped ceramic songs, we can identify with being small, delicate vessels with large, volatile contents, and whether or not we connect with Black’s personal story, we can all use his incantation of forgiveness on the insinuating “Killer” for our purposes. It turns out music can heal, in a way—as a lifeline through and a tally of the work it takes to heal yourself. Catch up every Saturday with 10 of our best-reviewed albums of the week.

American Advertisement,Advertisement,by: Zach Schonfeld,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f0dcc61763b970f286313da/1:1/w_160/American%20Advertisement_Advertisement.jpg,2020-07-18 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/advertisement-american-advertisement/,Patchwork Fantasy,"A few years ago, Advertisement might be the kind of band you’d catch three times in two days at South by Southwest, vibing to their frayed mid-1970s swagger and impulse-buying a cassette from the merch table despite having no way to play it. At some point in the sweaty haze, you might text your dad, telling him to put down the Greta Van Fleet and listen to this instead. Such an encounter felt like a relic of the recent past even before the pandemic, but Advertisement’s self-released debut album captures the loose, pleasantly depraved energy of a DIY rock show well enough that you can almost smell the pot fumes from your couch. The band, comprising six childhood friends from the Seattle area, sounds like a rebellion against the city’s ballooning gentrification, armed with rickety instrumental textures and lyrics that evince a sly distrust of American ideals. The members have previously been involved in West Coast hardcore bands like Nasti and Vacant Life, and Advertisement’s 2018 EP reflected that lineage. But on American Advertisement, they slow the tempos and deliver an uncommonly melodic brand of vintage sleaze-rock with frazzled grooves and dueling guitars. The riffs consummate this transformation, from the slide-guitar grit of “Pretty Money”—an absurdist send-up of capitalism that the band has dubbed “Marxist-cosplay pastiche”—to the melodic wah-wah psychedelia of “Tall Cats.” Wiry-voiced lead singer Charlie Hoffman has mastered the art of sounding like he couldn’t care less, which suits the material well. At times he resembles a young Iggy Pop on a country kick, though the closest Advertisement comes to Stooges-style anarchy is on the breakdown at the end of “Always,” the record’s eight-minute climax. “Freedom,” another lengthy track, rides a krautrock-inspired groove, but its motorik intensity is an awkward match for this band’s cheeky lyrics and irreverent spirit. Most punk bands wait until album number three or four before they start dabbling in Crazy Horse sprawl and citing the Grateful Dead as an influence, but Advertisement’s attitude seems to be, why wait? They do a fine approximation of Laurel Canyon twang on country-rock brooders like “Days of Heaven” and “Shipwrecked Hearts,” broadening the band’s hard-rock pedigree, and when monotony starts to set in on Side B, the aforementioned “Always” is a welcome jolt. If you liked The Men more when they rented a cabin in the Catskills and swerved into rustic psychedelia, chances are you’ll like this, too. Advertisement are better lyricists, too, with a knack for surrealist vignettes that distort and pervert American fantasies. Consider the flurry of imagery near the end of “Always,” in which Hoffman calls out to “dressage stallions with erections half-mast” skipping through rings of fire for a cheering crowd. “It’s only the American zen,” the singer mutters, babbling like a prophet as the song accelerates into nightmarish cacophony. In Advertisement’s vision of American zen, grim soothsaying is delivered with a wink and a grin. Catch up every Saturday with 10 of our best-reviewed albums of the week.

Beyond the Pale,JARV IS…,by: Ben Cardew,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f0dc7339f0d624cf3ecb288/1:1/w_160/Beyond%20the%20Pale_Jarv%20Is....jpg,2020-07-17 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/jarv-is-beyond-the-pale/,Rough Trade,"Beyond the Pale was never meant to exist. In 2017, Jarvis Cocker assembled a six-piece band that would only perform live, without releasing albums, and gave them a slightly confusing name: JARV IS… It took the intervention of Geoff Barrow to nudge the former Pulp frontman into making this record, which the band assembled by adding studio overdubs to live tapes they’d been recording for personal use. They call it an “alive album,” rather than a live one. It’s a contrived and aspirational description for an album that aims for the wild abandon of live music but only occasionally reaches it. Beyond The Pale isn’t dead, certainly. But it’s moribund at times, like a post-festival straggler in need of three square meals and a vitamin shot rather than a rampaging rock god. It’s a shame because the idea of JARV IS… as a living transgression of the line between recorded and live music is interesting, and there are enough moments of lively inspiration to suggest what Beyond The Pale could have been, if it weren't weighted down with overlong songs and flat production. Beyond the Pale’s songs tackle brilliantly un-rock’n’roll subjects, from evolution to the cabin fever of an aging raver, and lines like “God damn this claustrophobia/‘Cause I should be disrobing ya” show Cocker has not lost the wit that made him an unlikely Britpop icon. ""Children of the Echo” has a rousing and unusual chorus that stands up to Cocker’s strongest melodies, and the verse of “House Music All Night Long” nails the classically British art of polite desperation. Cocker’s excellent band combines atypical influences in intriguing new shapes, led by Emma Smith’s supple violin attack. Album highlight “Sometimes I Am Pharaoh”, whose basic track was recorded live in a cavern in middle England, is a sublimely freaky mixture of taut Roxy Music sophistication and frazzled tribal grunge, while “Swanky Modes” offers a rueful combination of dubwise bass and jazzy piano. Their approach is a bit like Pulp’s in their later years, albeit a version of that Pulp had lost something of their musical discipline and sharp edges. The flab that buries Beyond the Pale’s highlights may be a result of the album’s half-live conceit. Several of the songs feature long spoken-word breakdowns, which are effective on stage, where Cocker can work his magnetic presence, but feel empty on record, undoing the bite of the better songs and exposing the faults of the weaker ones. “Children of the Echo” is a six-and-a-half-minute epic that has said it all in four, and “Am I Missing Something?” drags like a rainy Sunday afternoon. Beyond the Pale contains plenty of sharp songwriting, but despite the intrigue of its premise, it may have benefitted from a more thorough commitment to making a proper album. The hybrid stage/studio setup captures the sprawl of a live gig without the excitement and possibility, and the sheen of a studio recording without the cohesion and refinement.

Isolated From Exterior Time: 2020,Magik Markers,by: Colin Joyce,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f0dcaa03145eda8a1c27a6f/1:1/w_160/Isolated%20From%20Exterior%20Time-%202020_Magik%20Markers.jpg,2020-07-17 05:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/magik-markers-isolated-from-exterior-time-2020/,Drag City,"Escapism has long been the guiding philosophy of Magik Markers. The avant-rock destructionists titled their 2013 album Surrender to the Fantasy, a reference to the role of “the unconscious mind” in their music-making. Singer-guitarist Elisa Ambrogio told Interview Magazine that their music is, in part, a conscious rejection of “the reality of your day-to-day existence,” an attempt to find joyfulness and ecstasy amid life’s doldrums. For the better part of two decades, they’ve torn up the tropes of rock and blues history and reassembled them into unrecognizable, otherworldly forms. It’s jarring music, but that’s the point—it’s supposed to shake you free from your normal rhythms and lead the way to another world. On Isolated from Exterior Time: 2020, their first new EP since 2013, they shift this approach; instead of providing an escape to these times, they choose to score this period’s chaos. Such a disposition feels fitting when much of the world is stuck inside, grappling with the uncertainty of an unprecedented global health crisis and the destabilization caused by its calamitous management by the people in power. It’s only fair that the Magik Markers would attempt to reflect the downcast spirit of the year. A brief piece of writing that accompanies the EP on Bandcamp suggests that the timing of their return is no accident: “[Magik] Markers only appear in times of duress.” The 25 minutes of music on Isolated from Exterior Time certainly don’t sound like a balm for all the time everyone has spent inside. Like the psychedelic memoir of Alejandro Jodorowsky’s recent films, they aim for a kind of transcendence, one where truth is gestured at obliquely through surrealism, static, and violence. The four songs are illusory and upsetting—full of spectral harmonies and needly riffs crawling along ominously and overlapping chaotically. “Machines” picks up more or less where Surrender to the Fantasy left off, presenting the Markers in their more song-like mode, offering a few straightforward riffs and some elusive lyrics about fear. But from there the song doubles over on itself; Ambrogio’s lyrics are barely legible as she sings over herself, the song spiraling out into more chaotic thought processes. It’s likely a familiar energy for anyone who’s been cooped up since March; everything starts out normal, but as you spend more time isolated with your thoughts, things can start to get weird. The rest of the tracks are only stranger. There’s a ghostly round called “Three Guitars” that haunts and creaks in a way that recalls Charalambides’ distressed Americana. “Arms to the Sky” is an echoey, creeping drone that sits somewhere between Spiritualized’s hopeless ballads and the anhedonia of doom metal. However, the record’s most moving moments are peppered throughout the ten-minute closer “Jet Skis (Alt Mix),” a loping, feedback-laden epic that sounds like it got lost in the desert on its way to meet Manuel Göttsching. Unlike the splatter-painted psych-noise that Magik Markers first become known for, it’s gloomy and monochrome, a trudge through the psychic muck and mire. It’s an apt soundtrack for a year that’s been an overwhelming slog. There’s little hope for escape, but Magik Markers make the case that it’s ok to feel a little lost.

До Свидания / Goodbye,IC3PEAK,by: NM Mashurov,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f04ed28dc55f46b4632441f/1:1/w_160/%D0%94%D0%BE%20%D0%A1%D0%B2%D0%B8%D0%B4%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B8%D1%8F%20:%20Goodbye_IC3PEAK.jpg,2020-07-17 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/ic3peak-do-svidaniya-goodbye/,self-released,"In the 2018 mini-documentary Let It All Burn, the Moscow duo IC3PEAK are about to play a show in the Russian city of Voronezh when health inspectors and police arrive to shut the venue down on suspicion of food poisoning. Although the alleged incident has taken place the day before the band’s arrival in town, the officers demand to speak to the band and their manager. This is the latest obstacle on a tour where every stop has been plagued by interference from government officials. As the club director is interrogated, the sound engineer and the duo’s manager sneak fans through a backdoor into the dimly lit room where IC3PEAK members Nastya Kreslina and Nikolay Kostylev launch into their song “Сказка” (“Fairytale”): “I come from a Russian horror fairy tale/It doesn’t matter where you come from,” Kreslina spits. “I do not play your games/Someday you will die.” At the end of their short set, a sizable crowd, most of whom didn’t even make it into the venue, lingers in the cold outside, singing along to their favorite IC3PEAK songs. Kreslina and Kostylev join them to sing the controversial hit “Смерти Больше Нет” (“Death No More”), which may have set off the government’s ire to begin with: “I fill my eyes with kerosene/Let it all burn, let it all burn/All of Russia is watching me/Let it all burn, let it all burn.” With their politically brazen lyrics about police repression and state hypocrisy, as well as a fierce, highly stylized goth maximalism, IC3PEAK is one of the most exciting bands to come out of Russia in a while—and Russia’s youth and officials both know it. The duo’s latest album, До Свидания (Goodbye) was released with the tagline, “It’s going to get darker.” That’s a hefty challenge for a band whose first major hit was called “Sad Bitch.” But До Свидания delivers. Sounding at times like a cross between Eartheater and Deli Girls, IC3PEAK’s music oscillates between pitch-black hymnals and twisted club bangers, often in the same song. Kreslina is indeed something out of a gothic fairy tale—sometimes a ghostly child reciting a menacing nursery rhyme, sometimes a vengeful banshee. Her vocal toolkit incorporates seething whispers, operatic flourishes, chilling high falsetto, and melodic, radio-friendly toplines. It is important that the band sings in Russian, but Kreslina emotes so effusively that their message touches even those who don’t speak the language. “[In our early tracks] there was this idea of the universal language, which is the language of the scream,” Kreslina told sports journalist Yury Dud in an interview for his pop-culture YouTube talk show, vDud. Kreslina’s screams are balanced perfectly by Kostylev’s impeccable production: restrained soundscapes always ready to attack with a well-timed drop, danceable wobbling trap beats, and abrasive industrial screeching—a natural evolution from performing at underground bunker raves in Moscow in their early years. Once upon a time IC3PEAK would have fit neatly under the witch-house umbrella, but they set themselves apart by wedding its aesthetic to a sharp political consciousness. Postcolonial scholar Achille Mbembe coined the term “necropolitics” to discuss how state power renders some lives disposable, thus creating “death-worlds, new and unique forms of social existence in which vast populations are subjected to conditions of life conferring upon them the status of living dead.”  With a mouthful of dirt and blood, IC3PEAK weaponizes this already-dead positionality, conjuring the silenced, repressed, and murdered subjectivities that haunt the autocratic patriarchal regime. On До Свидания, IC3PEAK continue to touch on political themes. In “TRRST,” featuring former 6ix9ine songwriter ZillaKami, they address censorship (“Mama, they say I’m a terrorist (what?) I did nothing wrong but I got on a blacklist”). “Марш” (“Marching”) deals with the suppression of democracy (“Without an invitation they come into my house/[With] a new word and a new law”). And “Плак-Плак” (“Boo Hoo”) deals with domestic violence, decriminalized in Russia in 2017: “I was always good, I was never bad/All my life like a good girl I obeyed the rules/I’m tired of crying, tired of suffering/Either way I won’t be able to predict my own death.” In the video for “Плак-Плак,” a somber child with Kreslina’s iconic braids opens a blood-red diorama and mimes her parents (played by Kreslina and Kostylev in doll form) fighting, only to frighten when the Kreslina doll comes to life and takes vengeance into her own hands by murdering her husband with a butcher knife. But the record is full of more universal subjects as well: loneliness, betrayal, love, death. Each is handled with the same heavy-handed melodrama, to various degrees of effectiveness. There’s a wealth of necro imagery and sinister voltas (“I kiss your corpse/I thought you were my friend”; “I want to hug these mountains/I want to lick the sky/I will kiss the water/I will cover my head with earth”) which can feel both mall-goth maudlin and archetypically black metal. When Kostylev really lets rip, it sounds as deliciously apocalyptic as the Body, and though the heavier songs can feel eclipsed by the focus on the ballads, they are definite highlights. The metal affinities are not just in the lyrics but also in the aesthetic: desaturated photos emphasizing pale skin, black formalwear, and red accents (lipstick, blood) set against the Russian forest or dystopian brutalist cityscapes. IC3PEAK have always envisioned themselves as an audiovisual project, directing and producing high-concept, relatively high-budget music videos that give their music dimension and expand their audience to millions. Thanks in part to multi-platform exposure, their reach has expanded internationally: They have played Berlin’s CTM festival; toured through the U.S., China, and Brazil; and even caught the ear of Skrillex, who has dropped a remix of “Sad Bitch” in his sets. On До Свидания, an unprecedented number of features suggest the extent of their growing reach. ZillaKami’s unmistakably gravel-voiced verse is the biggest surprise, but the record also includes contributions from Russian rapper Husky (who has also experienced show cancellations and even imprisonment for his music) and horrorcore Florida rapper GHOSTEMANE, a former affiliate of Lil Peep in Schemaposse. Throughout Let It All Burn, both IC3PEAK and their fans seem unflustered by the police interference: This is just how things are. But the weight of it lingers—after all, it is one thing to sing abstractly about state violence and another to be personally targeted by it—giving До Свидания a more vulnerable and forlorn tone than previous albums. Still, amidst the record’s mortal desperation and corpse worship lies a vehement refusal to accept the psychic death implied by total resignation, further proving to IC3PEAK’s commitment to fearlessness at a time when state power feeds on fear and silence. “You buried me beyond the MKAD/Fed me dirt/But I crawled out of hell/And came back for you,” oozes Kreslina on the swerving “мкАД” (“Moscow Automobile Ring Road”).

The Los Angeles-based guitarist makes oblique math rock in his primary band Tera Melos, whittles experimental noise pop alongside Death Grips drummer Zach Hill in bygones, and dreams up bizarre prog parts in supergroups like Big Walnuts Yonder. After a 15-year career guided by a “Why not?” attitude, Reinhart has finally decided to give self-described “‘normal’ songs” a try with Disheveled Cuss, his new solo project for all things grunge and power pop. On his self-titled debut album, Reinhart uses the limitations of verse-chorus structure to condense his ambitions and rein in his trains of thought, establishing boundaries that help him scratch a pop itch with some of his best songwriting to date. With drummer JR Kurtz and engineer Patrick Hills contributing bass, Reinhart wastes no time defining what “‘normal’ songs” means to him. It’s the unabashed hooks of Weezer’s Blue Album, the fuzzy texture of ’90s alt-rock, the satisfying payoff of a great bridge and an even greater chorus. He modifies those influences with vocal registers and guitar trills, like on “Nu Complication” and “Generic Song About You,” always grounding the tracks with lush guitar tones. Throughout, he sings about letdowns and lonely days, lyrics that later helped him to recognize his depression. Perhaps that subconscious mental state is what gives Disheveled Cuss its restive energy, as if a sudden breakdown is looming in the background. The best pop songs leave you wanting more. That’s where Reinhart, who built his career on going over the top all of the time, momentarily stumbles. “Oh My God” focuses its five-minute runtime on a repetitive guitar loop, dulling its own edge by waiting too long to introduce a delightfully unpredictable riff just before the end. Reinhart knows how to save an unconventional earworm for a surprise ending, but this time, the tension fizzles long before the buildup finishes. Despite his commitment to conventional structures, Reinhart also sprinkles weird sounds throughout: jazzy, high-register string plucks, bittersweet voicemails from his grandfather, warped whammy bar effects that sound like a strip of film dissolving. Even a straightforward track like “Shut Up” packs enough pep to masquerade as a TV show theme. No matter which moniker Reinhart works under, his playing style and ear for production can make a technical trick sound uncomplicated. “She Don’t Want,” easily the best song on the album, rides an elastic melody into blasts of neo-grunge production and a radiant solo-turned-riff recall, a combination that’s an instant mood-booster. In a way, it’s the reason Reinhart started this project to begin with: to forgo the intricate compositions of his other bands for the welcome familiarity of 4/4 time signatures and pleasing refrains. It’s a sharp left turn in his career, but as his ideas roam freely and joyfully on Disheveled Cuss, it pays off.","Tera Melos guitarist Nick Reinhart turns to grunge and power-pop, embracing the limitations of verse-chorus structure with some of his best songwriting to date.

Legends Never Die,Juice WRLD,by: Brandon Caldwell,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f08e1ae9f0d624cf3ecafc7/1:1/w_160/legends%20never%20die_juice%20wrld.jpg,2020-07-16 05:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/juice-wrld-legends-never-die/,Grade AInterscope,"At 21, Juice WRLD had begun to master the world around him. He could wed the sounds of influences like Billy Idol and Chief Keef and create something entirely different. As a songwriter, he could pair an airy melody with lyrics about heartbreak or drugs, and given the chance, fire off marathon freestyle sessions on a whim. A wunderkind with many imitators on SoundCloud, he sounded far more polished, far beyond whatever his closest peer was attempting to accomplish. When he died in December 2019, days removed from celebrating his 21st birthday, it opened up yet another wound for a generation of rap fans struggling to hold on to the new voices that spoke for them. Juice WRLD brought people from outside the margins into his crystalized world of vulnerability in a dash towards mental freedom. His most fervently repeated lines doubled as yearbook quotes or quickly deleted tweets. His closest supporters, such as producer and longtime collaborator Nick Mira, have kept his legacy close to them, maybe more so than any other group of fans who recently lost their champion. Juice asked those fans to trust him—and the people who supported him—as if they were family. Legends Never Die, the Chicago artist’s first posthumous release, doesn’t feel like a final goodbye from Juice but instead a continued look inside his world. Across three major releases—Goodbye & Good Riddance, WRLD on Drugs, and Death Race for Love—Juice proudly kept himself at a distance while pining for love, bringing fans closer to his truth while still keeping his guard up. The bulk of Legends Never Die sifts through his thoughts as he battled anxiety in the face of stardom. He understood the game he played and how it kept him centered: “If it wasn’t for the pills, I wouldn’t be here,” he sings on “Wishing Well.” It’s a bleak and beautiful world he’s created, one where the most poignant moments are buried in candor and honesty. Throughout Legends Never Die’s 56 minutes, Juice’s delivery is conversational and evocative as he checks off the perks of success and the lingering doubts (“Just got a new house, gotta hide the skeletons in the closet”). The emo-heavy sounds that blossomed on Death Race’s “Robbery” and “Empty” have now morphed into a fully developed ecosystem where all of the sounds and keys are built around Juice’s frame of mind. Mira’s touches on Legends Never Die don’t appear until the harrowing “Righteous,” where sparse guitar plays underneath Juice’s confessional: “Taking medicine to fix all of the damage/My anxiety the size of a planet,” he sings. Pop heavyweights such Dr. Luke and Marshmello grab the mantle on “Wishing Well” and the pop-rock ready anthem “Come & Go,” where Juice thanks God for allowing him grace and support. Juice writes a great hook like no other, but it’s a fine line between being catchy and being repetitive. The themes of despair and downing pills to mask problems carry over to many songs and make for an uneasy listen that doesn’t really reveal more about him in the process. As high as Juice was in creating watershed moments, his self-awareness about those highs eventually betraying him became evident. Even when he shifts into a tough sneer, he steps into knotty one-liners about gunplay (“Let my gun bust a nut”) that fall flat. There are moments when Juice’s peers take the wheel to eulogize him. “The Man, The Myth, The Legend” captures anecdotes and unpretentious thoughts on his life from the likes of G Herbo and others. Stories about Juice’s freestyle skills and triumphs are peppered with colossal heapings of praise and zero mention of what ultimately robbed his life. Even without that added dimension, it’s the intent that’s paramount. Herbo and company—like many who struggle with how best to remember family when they pass—choose to be protective and highlight Juice’s greater deeds and accomplishments, rather than to relive a tragic final act. The gripping parts of Legends Never Die come when Juice is speaking from the heart. With a casual flex in his voice, he points out his guiding ethos: Regardless of how destructive his path was, he sought to save those who listened to him. He found those same sentiments in peers like Lil Peep and XXXTentacion, both of whom captured raw material from the id to establish cult-like fanbases and died just months apart. (In 2018, Juice released “Legends,” a tribute song to both men, singing, “What’s the 27 Club?/We ain’t making it past 21.”) Legends Never Die becomes another way for Juice WRLD to keep saving people from their demons. He wanted to help fans who were also enduring his pain—he never wanted to be alone in the process.","The Chicago artist’s first posthumous release doesn’t feel like a final goodbye, but instead a continued look inside his world.

His debut, Original Pirate Material, was a landmark for UK rap, and its follow-up, the concept LP A Grand Don’t Come for Free, was an even more ambitious and experimental storytelling experience, but subsequent albums brought diminishing returns. He’d already revealed he was “fucking sick” of the name and its implications, and he was exhausted and running out of ideas. “I think it would devalue it to say that it was cynical but I know what I’m doing with the Streets—I’ve been doing it for too long,” he told The Guardian. “I don’t want to do the Streets anymore. I should have moved on a long time ago.” In 2009, he told NME he wouldn’t revisit it unless he was 40 and broke. He stayed busy after 2011’s supposed swan song, Computers and Blues, starting a new project with the Music’s Rob Harvey, restarting his indie label, and even DJing. In 2017, Skinner announced a Streets greatest-hits tour, then formally resurrected the project. He says he isn’t broke but there are other reasons to be pessimistic about this revival: “The reason I finished the Streets was to make a film,” he told Mr. Porter, “and the reason I started the Streets up again was to make a film.” This new album is, in part, a marketing campaign to produce a movie. None of Us Are Getting Out of This Life Alive is his first album in nine years; Skinner also happens to be 40 now. It’s that kind of funny coincidence that seems fit for a candid Streets lyric, but he doesn’t mine his departure or return, or the reasoning behind either, for material. Dubbing this a “mixtape” instead of a proper album implies a clear effort to take some of the pressure off, especially from an artist so serious about craft and process, but the distinction does feel apt: Every single song has a feature, following a format similar to his only other mixtape, 2011’s Cyberspace and Reds. That record showed a curiosity for British rap that was missing on Computers and Blues and is rekindled here. A cadre of young rhymers appear across the tape eager to make the most out of the opportunity. But in doing so they make Skinner feel archaic. He returns to the simple snark of his early music, only the cheeky misadventures of his youth have been replaced by jaded pronouncements from middle-aged life, where dating is an ordeal and the hangovers are longer. The mixtape is better produced than his last few outings, with slicker songs where he once again futzes with dance music, rap beats, and UK garage rhythms, as well as sampling UK funky and drum’n’bass. He told Apple Music his focus was to avoid getting bogged down by concepts and just say “some cool shit,” and there are flashes of that irreverent charm. On “Same Direction,” his raps embody the awkwardness, hilarity, and thrill of a tryst gone awry. Unfortunately, most songs on the tape fail to harness that same sense of in-the-moment acuteness. Much of None of Us Are Getting Out of This Life Alive is fixated on smartphones—specifically, using them to ignore people. Phones can be an excellent talisman for examining our deteriorating interpersonality; take, for example, the photobook Screen Time, or another mixtape, Erykah Badu’s But You Caint Use My Phone. Yet these songs have about as much insight into our pocket screens as Quibi execs. On more than one occasion, Skinner cringes at the state of women’s DMs, weighing unsolicited come-ons with the insight of someone who was hipped to this by the short story Cat Person. (Seriously.) There’s the super literal song “Phone Is Always in My Hand,” which is lazy and obvious in its depictions of avoidance (“You’re ignoring me, but you’re watching my stories”). There’s even a flatness to his quips about the primacy we place on always being on: “You know I’d give you my kidney/Just don’t take my charger,” he raps on opener “Call My Phone Thinking I’m Doing Nothing Better.” His sense of humor remains intact (“Plans always become dead/I told you I’d come for the jokes/But that was two hours ago, I was younger back then/I was full of hope”), but the bits land with far less frequency and force. In the early ’00s, he introduced what felt like a novel and necessary perspective to rap, stumbling between clubs and pubs, flitting aimlessly between rap and garage, bringing to light the nuances of lad culture, its gags and slang and monotony. He was an observer rapper surveying his insular world with a wink and a shrug. On this tape, his scrutiny mostly feels pointless. “Man, God has it backward, God has seen it all/But if God had dropped acid, would God see people?” he asks clumsily, barely rhyming his inane attempt at stoner profundity. The main knock on Skinner throughout his career has been that his spoken-word flows can be clunky and out of pocket. There can be a disarming and charming quality to his rapping when his wit is sharpest, and the phonetics of the title track’s last verse distract from its frivolousness, but in the moments where his raps are edgeless and obtuse they can really grate, and it has only gotten worse with age. His rapping on None of Us Are Getting Out of This Life Alive often lacks any sense of rhythm or finesse. This problem is only exacerbated in the company of nimbler peers, especially Ms. Banks, Jesse James Solomon, and Oscar #Worldpeace. His rhymes don’t always catch the beat, and, when running side by side with a new crop of MCs, he is usually outpaced. Reading his explanations for choosing the guest rappers, it’s clear they moved him, but he might’ve been better off simply ceding them the space and stepping away.

Coriky,Coriky,by: Stuart Berman,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f073e337bb7acb328d57f31/1:1/w_160/Coriky_Coriky.jpg,2020-07-16 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/coriky-coriky/,Dischord,"It is both cruelly ironic and fitting that Fugazi bowed out after 2001’s The Argument, just as the U.S. was entering a perpetual state of war, both in the external, militaristic and ideological senses. As the unwavering moral compass of the underground—not to mention the most impassioned, inspiring, and adventurous post-hardcore band of their time—Fugazi had spent much of the late ’80s and ’90s opening our eyes to the abuses of power, income inequality, and toxic masculinity that have only seemed to become more pervasive in the 21st century. In times of crisis, we look for heroes to rally around—or even just to provide a quality protest song—but Fugazi were never interested in being those kinds of saviors. They were sharing the blueprints that exposed the fallacies of the system, but their retreat affirmed that the task of changing the world is on all of us. And yet when, during George W. Bush’s first term, Ian MacKaye debuted the minimalist, melodic indie-rock duo the Evens with ex-Warmers drummer (and wife) Amy Farina, it felt a bit like Clark Kent opting to live as a mortal while Metropolis plunged into chaos in Superman II. Though his insights were as sharp and critical as ever, MacKaye had essentially traded in Fugazi’s bullhorn for tin cans and string, resulting in music that was more intimate and threadbare. The Evens’ low-stakes, homespun quality was further reinforced when the band was put on the backburner after the couple became parents, resulting in a six-year gap between 2006’s Get Evens and 2012’s The Odds, and mostly silence since. Now, in the midst of the most tumultuous election year in American history, MacKaye and Farina have resurfaced with a new band featuring an old friend—Fugazi bassist Joe Lally (fresh from playing in jazz-punk power trio the Messthetics with fellow Fugazi alumnus Brendan Canty). But in terms of career aspirations, they practically make the Evens look like shameless self-promoters. Formed in 2015, the new group existed for three years as a private affair; they played their first show in 2018 before they had even settled on a name, announcing it at the bottom of a community-bulletin email from Washington, D.C. activist group Positive Force. Not surprisingly, Coriky sound like they could’ve popped up in 2003 as the logical bridge between the nimble, jazz-inflected rhythmic undercurrents and artful dissonance of latter-day Fugazi and the more congenial pop sensibilities and song-sketch scrappiness of the Evens. But if Coriky sound more emboldened and agitated than the Evens ever did, exhibiting the focus and fury the times demand, they’re less interested in addressing the current state of the nation than in probing the insidious issues and attitudes that afflict America no matter who’s sitting in the Oval Office. As ever, MacKaye shrewdly distills macro calamities to personal, almost prosaic vignettes. “Clean Kill” takes the concept of “office drone” to its most literal extreme, indicting a modern military apparatus where triggering drone strikes halfway around the world is just another mindless desk job, complete with coffee breaks and idle chit-chat. The perverse normality of the scene is framed by an uncanny sing-along hook—“it’s a clean kill, but it’s not clean”—that captures both the callous efficiency of the gig and the mental toll exacted on the operators. “Have a Cup of Tea” zooms out to implicate the country as a whole: As the song locks into a “Suggestion”-like lurch en route to a similar conclusion (i.e., “we are all guilty”), MacKaye explains how authoritarian violence—and bourgeois indifference to it—is simply the American way: “It’s in our mind/It’s in the Constitution/It’s in our house/It’s in our hands/It’s in our eye/It’s in our blood/It’s in our DNA.” When you hear MacKaye barking those words with jugular-popping force alongside Lally’s stalking bassline, it’s tempting to close your eyes and imagine it’s 1991 with the White House looming in the background. Coriky abounds with similar displays of Fugazi-fan catnip, like the “Give Me the Cure”-style build-up of “Inauguration Day” and the start-stop funk and frenzied guitar scraping of “Say Yes.” But as the vocal interplay on the latter song illustrates, Farina’s presence lends Coriky a personality all their own. Where MacKaye and Farina often worked in humble harmony with the Evens, her sassy and soulful performances here position her as a more mischievous foil, playfully poking holes in the patriarchy (“Too Many Husbands”) and the shocking regularity of shootings in American classrooms (“Jack Says”). In moments like these, Coriky present chronic disappointment as a psychic survival tactic, offering odd reassurance that things have always been fucked. (On the cheeky “Hard to Explain,” MacKaye seems to equate right-wing trolls with Minor Threat stans who still resent him for abandoning hardcore dogmatism to pursue Fugazi’s open-minded experimentalism: “Your position is you want me to fix/Something that you said I broke in 1986.”) But they’re not about to let their complaints harden into complacency. Atop the doom-blues groove of “Last Thing,” Farina, MacKaye, and Lally solemnly sing in unison: “The last thing we ever wanted was a war/But we found it much too easy.” It’s the sound of D.C. punk’s most seasoned footsoldiers declaring their return to active duty.

Recumbent Speech,Ezra Feinberg,by: Sam Sodomsky,Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f076a9226c2fc30cc9bd97b/1:1/w_160/Recumbent%20Speech_Ezra%20Feinberg.jpg,2020-07-16 05:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/ezra-feinberg-recumbent-speech/,Related States,"Recumbent Speech invites you to a world so vivid and intricately textured that you might feel like you are part of it. “Acquainted With the Night,” named after a Robert Frost poem, opens with the sound of Ezra Feinberg’s fingerpicked acoustic guitar, recorded closely enough to hear his fingers brush the strings. The sense of solitude in tight quarters doesn’t last long: Soon, he is surrounded by synth, flute, piano, and fretless bass—a cosmic pastoral landscape, not far from the ones Popol Vuh played to soundtrack Werner Herzog movies in the ’70s. Feinberg’s hypnotic, wordless compositions grow this way, one instrument at a time, letting you settle in before he sweeps you away. In the 2000s, Feinberg led the San Francisco band Citay. Across three records, the collective drew on styles that were largely unfashionable in indie music: soft rock, jam bands, new age. Ten years since the release of their last album, their earnest embrace of these genres feels ahead of its time. “I don’t feel a need to distance myself from anything I like,” he explained in 2006. “If anything, I want to bring myself (and my bandmates, as well as my friends and family) closer to everything I like.” The same way that artists like Jim O’Rourke or Oneohtrix Point Never return to a distinct set of influences through their myriad releases, Feinberg seemed to create a canon within his own work. You could count the references, but you’d lose track of the feeling: a radiant sense of positivity drawn from the most meditative corners of his record collection. His second solo album since disbanding Citay and moving to Brooklyn, Recumbent Speech is his most distinct and embracing work. He still draws on many of those same influences, but his work is less tethered to his versatile guitar playing. He is an expert bandleader, guiding a group of like-minded musicians to bring each composition to life. At other times, he is more like a free-form DJ. These six songs are unified by their slow-building serenity and enveloping atmosphere, maintaining a singular mood while Feinberg jumps between genres and influences. Minimalist classical explorations sit beside campfire folk strumming; ambient synths give way to nimble fusion. No two songs sound quite alike, and each of them might feel like the centerpiece on any given listen. To match his wide-spanning vision, Feinberg enlisted a compact but adventurous backing band. Among his accompanists are Tortoise drummer John McEntire, pedal steel player Chuck Johnson, synth composer Jonas Reinhardt, and vocalists April Haley and Mandy Green. These singers draw a clear line to Feinberg’s utopian work in Citay, their harmonies adding a sense of calm to the moody “Ovation.” But three minutes in, at the point where a Citay song might have burst into a guitar solo, the music drops completely, leaving just a bed of ambience and Feinberg’s amplifier feedback. When the band returns from the quiet, they sound slower and heavier, like they are carrying a great weight behind them. The record shines through these emotional twists in Feinberg’s compositions and his accompanists’ performances. If Feinberg’s inspiration once came from bringing the styles he loved to as many people as possible, Recumbent Speech draws on the deeper connections from a lifetime of music discovery: the memories those songs conjure, the people we meet through our shared passion, the way an old favorite might sound different under new circumstances. For all his crate-digging tendencies, Feinberg returns again and again to a simple goal: to soothe our worries and guide us somewhere better.

Healing Is a Miracle,Julianna Barwick,by: Will Gottsegen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f073c85ca5f171c3b7713c5/1:1/w_160/Healing%20Is%20A%20Miracle_Julianna%20Barwick.jpg,2020-07-15 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/julianna-barwick-healing-is-a-miracle/,Ninja Tune,"In a pandemic, cynicism is a crutch, and optimism is a meme. It’s easier to be a skeptic than it is to imagine a path forward. The ironic internet mantra “nature is healing” pokes fun at viral glimpses of post-apocalypse (goats reclaiming a Welsh town, dolphins in the Bosporus) but also casts the possibility of recovery as a joke. As the days drag on and the extent of our disconnection is reinforced, that possibility feels increasingly abstract. Julianna Barwick’s new album, Healing Is a Miracle, couldn’t be more at odds with the dreary landscape in which it arrives, and yet it’s difficult to imagine it existing at any other moment. Refuge has always been the promise of her music—the restorative power of those sylph-like vocals, soaked in reverb and looped ad infinitum. But her vision of ambient music is also fundamentally open-ended; it asks you to make something of it, to pin it in time and space before it fully unfurls. Healing is a warm, shifting collection that doesn’t so much anticipate the current moment as adapt to it: it’s a medium for the unconscious, a salve for the collective wound. At a time when healing feels impossible, Barwick asks us to picture it together. Where 2016’s Will was hushed and intimate, Healing Is a Miracle is comparatively forceful. “Safe” is made up of just a few elements, tracing a wordless shape in air before a whole-step loop rises up and overtakes it. There’s new power in Barwick’s layered singing, which feels distinctly present; you’re never worried it might slip away into the ether. “Inspirit” is reminiscent of John Tavener’s porous, holy minimalist chorales, but it’s set apart by thin waves of decaying bass. The earnest plea at its center is in keeping with Barwick’s project: “Open your heart/It’s in your head.” As with the album’s title, the frankness is almost startling. Healing hinges on “Flowers,” which maxes out the knob on the bass components teased on “Inspirit.” Haunting, cavernous ambience melts into stuttering dark as Barwick traverses high and low registers, summoning up strange, wordless glyphs. It unsettles more than it invites us in. These aren’t feelings one traditionally associates with respite, or with Barwick’s music, and yet the track is a necessary descent that shades the rest of the album, making for a more complete psychic journey. It ends in chaos, with what sounds like a lightning storm, and an abrupt cut to black. There’s something cinematic about what Barwick is doing here, a quality that’s most explicit in the album’s twin climaxes at the end of its A and B sides. “In Light,” written and recorded with Jónsi of Sigur Rós, pairs anthemic choruses with slow, incantatory verses. This is star-straddling, world-filling music—the kind of thing that risks cheesy bombast before arriving at transcendence. Its structure is also fundamentally different from Barwick’s earlier music: sturdier, less diaphanous. The Nosaj Thing collaboration “Nod” is shaped around an urgent rise and fall, and heaves like a living thing. The effect is profoundly empathetic. Though her previous music has frequently been compared to Brian Eno’s, Barwick has pushed back on the idea that she’s taking any significant cues from his ambient series. And while it’s clear she’s drawn from that conceptual reservoir to some degree (her sound installation for a hotel lobby space was commissioned by avowed Eno fans), on Healing Is a Miracle, she’s never been further from the category of background music. Sincerity this pure draws attention to itself. It’s a genuine revelation. Catch up every Saturday with 10 of our best-reviewed albums of the week.

That’s How Rumors Get Started,Margo Price,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f08dbbd763b970f286311f3/1:1/w_160/that's%20how%20rumors%20get%20started_margo%20price.jpg,2020-07-15 05:00:00,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/margo-price-thats-how-rumors-get-started/,Loma Vista,"Margo Price wasn’t always a country singer. Long before she nodded to Loretta Lynn with the title of her 2016 solo debut, Midwest Farmer’s Daughter, she gigged around Nashville in a variety of bands, playing British Invasion rock with Secret Handshake and soul and classic rock with Buffalo Clover. She proved as adaptable as she was ambitious, fitting her voice to multiple genres and developing an impressive stylistic range that was bound to be underappreciated in Nashville. After a series of tragedies and misfortunes—the loss of a child, jail time for drunk driving, professional inertia—she finally leaned into country music, assembling a barnstorming backing band called the Price Tags to set her woes to a honky-tonk soundtrack. That’s How Rumors Get Started represents a pivot away from twang toward a more classic rock sound—something closer to Buffalo Clover than her previous two albums. She named Tom Petty and Fleetwood Mac as touchstones, perhaps even hat-tipping the latter with that album title, and recorded in Los Angeles, at the storied EastWest Studios, with a group of session players including Benmont Tench from the Heartbreakers and Matt Sweeney from Chavez and Zwan. Co-producing is her old friend Sturgill Simpson, who sat in with the Price Tags many years ago and has his own strained relationship with country music. What ought to be a remarkable lineup, however, sounds overly constrained on Rumors, which lacks the heroic self-determinism of Daughter and the eccentricity of All American Made. This isn’t a case of “anything but country,” though. It’s more like “anything and country.” That remains the foundation of her songwriting, but she’s reaching out in new directions, tinkering with different sounds and settings with hit-or-miss results. The flatulent guitars on “Twinkle Twinkle” so strongly recall the bouncy blues-rock of the Black Keys that it just might constitute a casual dig at her old label Third Man and its co-founder Jack White. Much more compelling is “Heartless Mind,” which uses country as a springboard into New Wave. Price’s voice sounds surprisingly comfortable, invigorated even, alongside the drum machine, the bobbing organ, and the processed guitars, at times channeling Marilyn Martin without sounding especially retro. It’s the most animated track on the album, the riskiest but also among the most rewarding. Primarily, though, Price is interested in gospel music and the drama it injects into her songs. The churchly melodies and jubilant harmonies of the Nashville Friends Gospel Choir lend momentum and road-dog romance to “Prisoner of the Highway,” about the sacrifices you make as a touring musician, but those same elements are a distraction on “What Happened to Our Love?” which erupts into melodrama about halfway through, like a jump scare in a bad horror flick. When Buffalo Clover recorded the slow-burning “Hey Child” for their 2013 album Test Your Love, Price sang it like she was stuck in Memphis rather than L.A., her voice bouncing off the mournful Stax horns. Since then, she has become a more nuanced singer, which is apparent in the quieter moments on this new version, but the slick sound of Rumors sacrifices spontaneity for a scripted climax. In this West Coast setting, Price sounds less like the honky-tonk rebel and more like the Nashville professional. That can sharpen the ironies as well as the hooks of a song like “Letting Me Down,” with its prickly guitars and concrete details, but on the title track she sounds oddly resigned, even a little melancholy as she confronts someone spreading lies about her. “And here you are, still doin’ you,” she sings. “It never worked out, but it never stopped you.” Those are great lines, rich in their accusations, but there’s no sting in her voice, just a weary resignation. No artist has to bristle constantly, but Price’s outrage at industry double standards made her previous solo albums sound righteous, and her pain at life’s tragedies resonated even if you didn’t know her backstory. Rumors buffs away some of the rougher edges that made her so much more compelling than so many of Nashville’s aspiring singer-songwriters. Those albums made the fight sound worthwhile, but there’s too little fight in these songs.","With country as her foundation, the versatile singer and songwriter pivots toward classic rock. She sounds less like the honky-tonk rebel and more like the Nashville professional.

Dialectic Soul,Asher Gamedze,by: Hubert Adjei-Kontoh,Associate Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f0c76af763b970f286312c1/1:1/w_160/dialectic%20soul_asher%20gamedze.jpg,2020-07-15 05:00:00,Jazz,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/asher-gamedze-dialectic-soul/,On the Corner,"Asher Gamedze’s Dialectic Soul attempts to fuse the cerebral with the elemental by finding points of connection between the American and South African jazz traditions. If this sounds like the opening of a master’s thesis, that’s because it is. Gamedze, who was introduced to American audiences through his work on Angel Bat Dawid’s The Oracle, originally planned to submit this album along with his dissertation on South African jazz. The academic provenance of the work is reflected in its liner notes, which contain a schema for understanding the record and an introductory essay from historian and critic Robin D. G. Kelley. But the music is much more approachable than its intimidating supporting texts. By blending free-jazz excursions with South African protest music, Gamedze and his collaborators make the heady intimate and the complex intuitive: The music they play here expresses both the jubilation and the terror inherent in jazz creation. According to Gamedze, the “state of emergence suite” that makes up the first third of the album attempts to represent how colonial violence generates resistance. The song’s tripartite structure is as indebted to Max Roach as it is to G. W. F. Hegel (its three parts are named after the dialectic: “thesis,” “antithesis,” and “synthesis.”) We Insist! Max Roach’s Freedom Now Suite also contained a three-parter, “Triptych: Prayer, Protest, Peace,” that attempted to link American racism and colonialism. This is not the only connection the two artists share. Both use free-form drums in duet with another instrument to represent a particular conflict in the Black experience. Think Abbey Lincoln’s screams matching the anger of Roach’s drums on “Protest. ” For Gamedze, “solo drums in free time symbolise autonomous African motion, moving through and resolving its own contradictions.” The opening duet of the “state of emergence suite” puts this idea into practice; in the “thesis” section, his drums seemingly deflect all points of entry for Buddy Wells’ tenor sax. But this is not obfuscation, it’s determination. Wells’ sax, which, according to Gamedze, “introduces the violence of colonialism,” cannot conquer the tireless roving drums. Gamedze’s commitment to unceasing change characterizes the remainder of the album; his drumming refuses to stand still in history, leaving the other players to draw their own distinct narratives around it. The rest of the “state of emergence suite” is a mixture of modal wanderings and percussive chaos. Robin Fassie-Kock’s trumpet and Wells’ sax fuse together only to break when interrupted by Gamedze’s throbbing drums and Thembinkosi Mavimbela’s darting bass. The horns seemingly unite against this fury by splitting apart. Fassie-Kock plays Eric Dolphy-like intonations on his trumpet, where each sound takes the listener to a more astral space through its dilation. Wells’ sax slowly warps; its notes expand until their shape seems unnatural. It feels like watching firefighters slowly surround a building wracked by an ever expanding flame; as they douse water in every direction, you marvel at the fact that the structure still stands. This may be due to Gamedze’s search for connections between Western innovations and African tradition. He builds a syncretic edifice: His heroes are constantly remembered. On “eternality,” a bebop number that loses itself in the wind, Fassie-Kock’s trumpet will lie low, stab in the air, and twirl endlessly, its sound reflecting the capacious attitude of its player. The song’s menacing horns and Art Blakey drum patterns give it the melancholy atmosphere of modal records of yore, yet its combustive nature and sometimes atonal solos bring to mind the experiments of Ornette Coleman. It’s an ecumenical elegy to past legends strung together with their contributions. Yet Gamedze is not satisfied with homage; he is concerned with how the oppression that generated the music he loves is carried with us in the present. “hope in azania” comes from the South African liberation tradition. Its joyful melody belies the fact that it is crucially a song about being underfoot. It’s easy to lose sight of that in the glowing timbre of its united horns and the bouncy nature of its bass. But if you follow the path of Gamedze’s drums, which rush and clatter without wavering in their intensity for even a moment, you can hear the rage underlying the jovial mood. Gamedze’s drumming seemingly halts for no one; the closest he comes to stopping is on the album’s other song of remembrance, and the record’s most spiritual cut, “siyabulela.” Its percussion glitters, its horns are muted, and its tempo is slowed all the way down. The song is one of gratitude and acceptance, and it hinges on the voice of Nono Nkoane. Gamedze takes a marching rhythm here, appropriate for the memorial nature of the procession (he was inspired to write a version after hearing the song at a friend’s funeral). He increases tempo for a final solo of gratitude; it’s an attempt to make a noise that cannot be forgotten. It sometimes seems like contemporary jazz musicians only have two options—mimic what worked in the past or plumb the uncharted depths of left-field improvisation. Here, Gamedze shows that a third option is available: pursue the links between past and present. By fusing rigorous academic study with his musical practice, Gamedze connects jazz tradition to contemporary oppression. He does not merely lionize old jazz masters; he argues that their restricted circumstances necessitated revolutionary departures of form. The rapturous possibility that lies at the heart of Dialectic Soul comes from a recognition of this fact: If past fetters still bind us in the present, we can find new ways to free ourselves.

Barnacles,SahBabii,by: Alphonse Pierre,Staff Writer ,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f0c830acf63693816048260/1:1/w_160/barnacles_sahbabii.jpg,2020-07-15 05:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/sahbabii-barnacles/,Casting Bait,"Of Atlanta’s abundance of rap weirdos, the 23-year-old SahBabii is by far the weirdest. One of his most well-known songs is about falling for a voluptuous anime girl. When he is off in his world, he only really cares about two things: sex and animals. Separately, those two things are fine, but nothing gets him quite so worked up as when they’re put together, as often happens in a Sahbabii song: “And my bitch real thick/I’m fucking on a hippopotamus,” he croons sweetly  on 2018’s lush “Squidrific,” sounding like a sedated Young Thug. Since his 2016 breakout song “Pull Up With Ah Stick,” SahBabii has noticeably been removed from the Atlanta rap scene: he’s only done a handful of features and works mostly with his older brother, T3, and producers he finds online to provide him airy beats that could work in Chrono Trigger. He’s become so unpredictable that when he threatened to retire in 2019, people believed him. But instead he put out Barnacles, another Dayglo rundown of his unrelenting horniness and his favorite animals. “Giraffes and elephants/Giraffes and elephants/We fucked giraffes and elephants,” sings Sah on the cleverly titled “Giraffes and Elephants.” This is the third song on Barnacles, and it captures Sah, for better and worse. Out of context (or even in it), his lyrics make absolutely no sense. But in SahBabii’s universe, nothing really needs to make sense. His raps don’t feel like they take place in Atlanta or anywhere on Earth, really; it’s a complete demented fantasy. If SahBabii has anything in common with Atlanta’s rap scene, it’s that everything he says is delivered with complete seriousness. “My pockets pregnant/Nut in her mouth, got her tongue pregnant,” is the hook on “Pregnant,” and it’s sung in the casual cadence most other rappers would use to talk about their favorite pair of jeans or their latest jewelry purchases. But the classic ATL rap dream of designer fashion and fast cars doesn’t mean much to SahBabii. On “Trapezoid,” he’s elated to have found a girl that is built like the shape mentioned in the song’s title (“Small top with a big bottom”). And on “House Party,” Sah reflects about jumping a dude at a party with the warmth of someone remembering their favorite childhood birthday. It takes a lot, but SahBabii can cross the line and sound like a parody of himself. Typically it’s when his songs are too on-the-nose, like “Purple Umbrella,” where he interpolates the Scooby Doo theme into a questionable hook and delivers such a relentless onslaught of raunchy punchlines that they lose their shock: he compares his latest sexual conquests to Sweet Baby Ray’s sauce, Elmer’s glue, and a waffle cone. Weak production choices suck the life out of his adventure, too: “100 Round Drum” and “Soulja Slim” sound like the kind of rudimentary instructionals you could easily find on any SoundCloud page. But listening to his music is like binge-watching an animated sitcom; it’s easy to forget the lackluster parts. How could you possibly come away from Barnacles thinking about anything else but SahBabii wailing, “Hippo booty bouncin’/Rhino booty bouncin’/Elephant booty bouncin’” on “Double Dick,” or when he turned a reference to mozzarella sticks into a threat on “Pregnant,” or when he dissed his haters on “Racist” by calling them “rats” and “Donald Ducks”? (The only animals SahBabii could ever speak about negatively.) Yes, SahBabii’s imagination is disturbing, but somehow, the more time you spend with him, he starts sounding kind of wholesome.

1000 gecs & The Tree of Clues,100 gecs,by: Cat Zhang,Executive Editorial Assistant,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f08cf85100081be064385a7/1:1/w_160/1000%20gecs%20and%20the%20tree%20of%20clues_100%20gecs.jpg,2020-07-14 05:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/100-gecs-1000-gecs-and-the-tree-of-clues/,Big BeatAtlantic,"The American woodcock—colloquially referred to as a “timberdoodle” or “hokumpoke” in some areas—is a chubby, exhibitionist shorebird with stout legs and a long beak. When it scouts for worms, it rocks its body and stomps its feet in a funky little dance-walk; ditto when wooing potential mates. In April, Laura Les and Dylan Brady of the avant-garde pop duo 100 gecs posted a TikTok of three woodcocks—one adult, two babies—doing this strut, soundtracked to an array of beeps, honks, xylophone hits, and squeaks. (They made the audio.) Depending on your imagination, the final product looks like a bird family humping invisible Bop Its or competing in an intense round of Dance Dance Revolution. All of it is quintessentially gecs—the “beep boop” cacophony; the playful iteration on a meme; the subtle sweetness. Most of all: It’s weird. It’s fun. Don’t think too hard about it. According to one oft-told account, the name “100 gecs” originates from an accident in which an online lizard retailer shipped Les too many live geckos, leaving her with 100 instead of one; in the vast constellation of memes, “100 gecs” feels like an intellectual predecessor to “30-50 feral hogs.” On their 2019 studio debut, 1000 gecs, the duo’s arch, impish humor popped up in aggro copypasta-style taunts (“Hey, you little piss baby/You think you’re so fucking cool?”) and tragicomic tales of betting on a “stupid horse.” They specialize in hyperactive collisions of “uncool” genres: ska, dubstep, and ’00s metalcore, not to mention the sort of witless EDM that convinced you “I’m a vegetarian and I ain’t fucking scared of him” was the sickest diss ever. Writers often compare listening to their music to the whiplash of thumbing through digital feeds, but 100 gecs resist the cultivated eccentricity common on Twitter or TikTok, eliciting instead the spontaneous freedom of riffing in a group chat. Listening to 100 gecs is like watching your buds test out tricks at the skatepark: it’s less about precision and polish than the act of being together and having a good time. For their remix album, 1000 gecs and the Tree of Clues, Les and Brady have assembled a rowdy crew of friends, including expected PC Music affiliates like Charli XCX and A.G. Cook and new faces like Fall Out Boy, Rico Nasty, and alt-rap group Injury Reserve. 100 gecs’ music already sounds reconfigured; a remix album just pushes their techniques of extraction, warping, and recombining further, lending Tree of Clues the novelty and depth of an original. While the original “xXXi_wud_nvrstøp_ÜXXx” already interpolates Soulja Boy’s long-distance classic “Kiss Me Thru the Phone”—released a year after the invention of the first iPhone—the Eurodance-inspired remix digs deeper into the exultant rush of the late ’00s. Estonian rapper Tommy Cash hams it up with a Soviet Pitbull impression: “Mr. Worldwide … International killa!” Meanwhile, Hannah Diamond and Dylan Brady pine over untouchable lovers. Its chorus of entering and disappearing voices evokes DJ Earworm’s 2009 “United States of Pop” mashup; both reassemble the shiny debris of the ’00s into new shapes, eulogizing bygone optimism. “Let’s go all the way,” Brady trills, the same giddy, romantic dare from Katy Perry’s “Teenage Dream” a decade ago. The guests skillfully mold the originals into creations of their own, while still preserving some of the songs’ initial ideas. Dylan Brady was already channeling Fall Out Boy on the original “hand crushed by a mallet,” so hearing Patrick Stump bellow on the remix alongside Craig Owens of post-hardcore band Chiodos and Canadian singer-songwriter Nicole Dollanganger makes the original feel like a demo. Noise-pop duo Black Dresses’ thrashing interpretation of “745 sticky” magnifies the chaos and hedonism documented on the track. Unfortunately, Injury Reserve’s attempt with the same song is less successful. Their version of “745 sticky” is buried under extraneous car honks and clown squeaks, but the growling, voracious “GODDAMN” in the second chorus almost rescues it. Peculiarities like these keep things lively. “Please hold while I connect you to a rock hard wet gec,” Dylan Brady purrs in a sweaty phone sex monologue on the Dorian Electra-assisted “gec 2 Ü.” GFOTY and Count Baldour’s “stupid horse” remix kicks off with an actual whinney. Perhaps the biggest transformation occurs on “gecgecggec.” The original is a whimsical assembly of crime-scene music, game-show-style sound effects, and more, with incessant “gec gec gec gec”-s that sound croaked by brainless seagulls. The remix is a gummy pop-rap song. Those “gec” sounds are looped into a beat over which Lil West raps about bitches, racks, and convertibles. “If she wanna fuck, she call me,” he brags, adopting a DaBaby flow. But this cold, cocky front slowly crumbles, as Atlanta rapper-singer Tony Velour ends his melodic verse on the concession, “You got my strongest love.” By the time Laura Les appears, the mood is of complete and utter vulnerability: “Baby, I’m not stronger than you,” she wails. Online, skeptics wonder if fans only like 100 gecs as a meme; and yet, their sincerity hides in plain sight. The sad “gec 2 Ü” becomes sadder when Danny L Harle emulates Owl City’s burbling, saccharine production. Its wide-eyed innocence only underscores the tragedy of the premise: two people failing to meet each other’s needs, thunderous bass pounding like chunks of hail to emphasize the force of their agony. In a recent interview, Les confronted a sore spot in the coverage of 100 gecs. “We’re having fun,” she clarified, “we’re not fucking being ironic.” The duo began seriously working together after being invited to perform at Minecraft festivals, where artists attempt things “too stupid or too funny” for Spotify release, like cramming 30-40 songs into a 20-minute set. 100 gecs’ music feels tailor-made for a world like Minecraft, full of childlike pixelated figures wandering free in a vast, lonely landscape. On “came to my show,” one of two original songs on the album, a high-pitched voice whimpers, “I can’t believe you came to my show/It hurts when you don’t.” It’s a pure, wrenching distillation of the simple desire for someone to be there for you. While swerving through memes, genre pile-ups, and decades, 100 gecs crash into one idea over and over: There are always missed connections.","On this guest-crowded remix album, the duo continues its wild, swerving path through memes, genres, and decades, making some of its originals sound like demos in the process.

Skinned,ML Buch,by: Miles Bowe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d025ccb39bb0c4ad4df55fd/1:1/w_160/skinned_mlbuch.jpg,2020-07-14 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/ml-buch-skinned/,Anyines,"From its dramatic first synth splash, Mary Louise Buch’s debut album, Skinned, seems as uncanny as an android. Its disorienting first minutes shift between sleek sonic touchstones—sci-fi keyboards, synthesized baroque strings, echoing drum crashes, and a warped, robotic vocal—with mechanical ease. But then we get a true shock: Delicately fingerpicked guitar clears the air for a soft human voice. The song, called “Can You Hear My Heart Leave,” is much like the album that follows: wrapped in technological wonders that never hide the human heart beating at its core. Instead, Buch works the two in seamless conjunction, creating a striking collision of experimental and pop sounds. Primarily based in Berlin, Buch is more closely associated with her hometown scene in Copenhagen, where women like Astrid Sonne, Gel, and PANXING have crafted a fusion of modern classical, cutting-edge club music, and electro-acoustic experiments that sounds like nothing else in the world. Even in that context, Skinned stands out for its remarkable songwriting, fueled by Buch’s soaring voice, tender lyrics, and a guitar as malleable as clay in her hands. Technology is a constant on Skinned, but Buch uses it as a means rather than an end. These are songs about love, heartbreak, and the unpredictable space connecting the two—and while technology does populate them, it serves more to frame those human feelings. “I’m a Girl You Can Hold IRL” explores intimacy via webcam with only a tender bassline and an airy vocal, before bursting into a moment of magical realism as she sings, “I’m coming through the screen/Crawling on your table/My mouth against your neck.” It’s a scene straight from The Ring reimagined with synth swells and dreamy romanticism. “Can’t Get Over You With You” inverts that sensation, grappling with breakups in the social-media age and the unsettling voyeurism of clicking an ex’s profile, something she finds unable to resist in the opening lines. Buch may sing a lot about screens, but depending on her approach they become portals, windows, or mirrors. Nowhere is this more powerful or universal than on “Touching Screens,” a bright pop rush that sounds like Belinda Carlisle’s “Heaven Is a Place On Earth” 3D printed in the plastic mold of James Ferraro. The ecstatic chorus (“Touching screens/More than skin”) is delivered with cymbal crashes, guitar fireworks, and, in a perfect final minute, a stadium-sized rush of kick drum. Whoever she’s connecting with is left playfully ambiguous; instead, Buch focuses entirely on the relationship with the object itself, the addictive rush of “picking it up again” captured in balletic images of “fingers gliding” over glass. Whether the notification will spawn butterflies in the stomach or inflict sinking dread is unimportant—Buch focuses entirely on the brief moment between feeling our pocket buzz and checking our phone and blows it out with a surge of endorphins. These colossal songs are well served by the adventurous instrumentals Buch creates as connective tissue. “O” shoots emotional flutters of trance synths, bridging the thrill of “Touching Screens” and the somber aftermath of “Can’t Get Over You With You.” On the atmospheric Astrid Sonne collaboration “Stone Bridge,” Sonne transmutes her viola from ashen drones to silvery high notes, an otherworldly addition that expands her own spectacular 2018 debut, Human Lines. The transformations continue right up to closer “MW,” a track littered with false endings and quick mutations, from a seasick guitar riff to a reprise of “Can You Hear My Heart Leave” to a crash of drums that builds to an overwhelming peak in the final seconds. For all its careful structure and tenderness, Skinned ensures you enter and leave it utterly dazed. Much contemporary music tends to approach the subject of technology with the redundancy of that old Black Mirror joke, “what if phones, but too much.” But it’s so much more complex than that, because people are more complex than that. Technology is how we communicate now; we use it to grieve, and fall in and out love. ML Buch shows a remarkable understanding of our sci-fi present by crafting futuristic songs that, at their emotional core, feel timeless. The question she asks at the start is, “Can you hear my heart?” After Skinned, the answer is loud and clear.","In songs as slick and futuristic as the screens that surround us, the Danish electro-pop musician uses technology as a frame for deeply human feelings.

The Avalanche,Owen,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f0767a7dc55f46b46324611/1:1/w_160/The%20Avalanche_Owen.jpg,2020-07-14 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/owen-the-avalanche/,Polyvinyl,"In case you’ve missed out on the past 20-some years of American Football and Owen and are just now checking in with Mike Kinsella for the first time, here’s where he’s at in 2020: “I’ve got friends that don’t know me/A wife that’s disowned me/Here in concept only to miss.” This comes in the middle of “Dead for Days,” a song that begins with memories of his brother Tim finding their father’s unconscious body and ends with Mike imagining himself going out the same way, hoping at least it’ll be deemed an accidental overdose. While The Avalanche is billed as an album of “unraveling marriage and big endings,"" it’s also, simply, “the next Owen album,” a prophecy self-fulfilled in every brutally candid song and interview acknowledging the effects of porous boundaries between songwriting and real life. “I can’t believe the lies that my mouth spits/I can’t believe she stayed as long as she did,” Kinsella softly croons, setting the course for an album spent in the most indulgent part of a breakup: plenty of self-examination and admissions of fault, but no hard lessons learned and no real desire to change just yet. It’s hard to blame anyone who lacks the emotional bandwidth to take this all in at the moment. But you don’t send back a piece of cheesecake for tasting a little too rich and you don’t tap out on an Owen album because it’s a little too self-pitying. The Avalanche wallows, but the realization rather than the anticipation of karmic retribution lends it emotional urgency even as Kinsella works in his familiar modes of meandering melodies, exquisite acoustic arpeggios, and the occasional lapse into cringe-posting that threatens to break the whole spell. When he sings, “I can’t have my cake and fuck it too,” at the top of “I Should’ve Known,” it’s not clever, but an example of how easily he can ruin a moment (“OK, I won’t make another goddamn joke/I know, how rude”). The self-awareness still can’t cancel out a line so awkward that it haunts every subsequent spin like a screenshot of a deleted tweet. But that tendency has been drastically reduced from previous Owen albums, and The Avalanche is the project’s most relentlessly morose and objectively gorgeous work to date. To the same degree American Football LP3 realized the ambitions of its more tentative predecessor, The Avalanche goes maximalist with the template Kinsella and Bon Iver collaborator S. Carey set on 2016’s The King of Whys. Justin Vernon may have abandoned these winter wonderlands nearly a decade ago, but this is where Kinsella belongs right now. He is frighteningly alone in bustling environments—a sober mind filled with horrifying memories, at a bar an hour outside of town where he won’t be seen indulging his basest desires, and in “The Contours,” sighing “I’m in therapy/She’s in therapy” to relate a heartbreaking side-by-side separateness. Even as banjos, strings, bit-crushed electronics, overdubbed coos, or Now, Now’s KC Dalager wind through the mix, they’re all rendered ghostly by Carey’s see-through sheen. Even if American Football has become Kinsella’s primary focus, it’s heightened the importance of Owen as a creative outlet, a way to counterbalance the brand with the human being. There’s no question whether the misery or the music came first; the Kinsella brothers have come to understand Cap’n Jazz’s abstract emo as functionally primal scream therapy, an outlet for the trauma they were suffering in an abusive household but couldn’t quite name. Mike Kinsella has covered the same subject far more directly in just about every album he’s made as Owen in the time since. “I’ve got a reputation for fucking up to uphold,” he sings during “On With the Show,” the most straightforward pop song he’s ever written, and one that addresses the central concern for anyone whose personal brand is contingent on being depressed in public. Are such people subliminally drawn to relational chaos as a way to uphold their brand, or is the brand itself the reason for their chaotic life? The Avalanche does not determine where the feedback loop begins, only how destructive—and how difficult to stop—it is once it gets going.

Terrain,Jacob Cooper,by: Grayson Haver Currin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f07735adc55f46b46324617/1:1/w_160/Terrain_Jacob%20Cooper.jpg,2020-07-14 05:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/jacob-cooper-terrain/,New Amsterdam,"No, your stream is not buffering, and your headphones are not broken. But for the first two minutes of Terrain, the captivating second album from the conceptually intrepid and processing-minded composer Jacob Cooper, you will invariably wonder what is wrong with your sound. A fusillade of glitches and silences suggests an interrupted connection or a failing circuit. Soon enough, though, Cooper’s digital cacophony yields to the splendid consonance of Theo Bleckmann, a singer whose dashing fluidity made him a mensch of Meredith Monk’s Vocal Ensemble and shaped his stunning album of Kate Bush interpretations. “Nettles, daisies, and long purples,” he finally manages after the slurred start of “Ripple the Sky,” images of natural wonder barely outracing Cooper’s ruthless electronics. For the next 15 minutes, Bleckmann serves as a sort of narrative tour guide, singing a poem about the depression and suffering that thread together Ophelia’s woe in Hamlet, the suicide-minded works of Robert Schumann, and our own inescapably anxious times. He rises above a snarling string section only to have his splendid tone chopped, screwed, doubled, and damaged to the edge of oblivion. “Ripple the Sky” is a daring piece about trying to hold onto shreds of beauty in a cold world that rarely cares about what you covet. Those stutters at the start, the ones that will make you check your connection, and the squeal of scraped strings at the end are ellipses, reminders that our worries were no more new to Ophelia than they are to us. Shakespeare, Schumann, and you—that’s the timeline Cooper is condensing. Cooper has long been a fan of teasing his audience’s perception of time. In an opera, he constructed an alternate universe where Justin Timberlake again wooed Britney Spears. He also stretched the start of a hymn about Mary mourning Jesus’ crucifixion until you could almost visualize her forming tears. (That last work, Stabat Mater Dolorosa, is rapturous and highly recommended, as beautiful a buck as you will ever spend on Bandcamp.) Terrain features three pieces written between 2016 and this year, each based around new poems commissioned by Cooper and sung by Bleckmann, his younger stylistic descendant Jodie Landau, and, for the finale, the two in tandem. These poems and the pieces at large consider the ways time reinforces or diminishes our individual experiences. Where “Ripple the Sky” is about the immortality of our woes, “Expiation” examines humanity’s customs of killing animals and, broadly, our inability to “escape past pressure.” The most recent work and title track, “Terrain,” tries to hold onto fleeting moments of beauty while the world races ahead. All of this might sound dry or overly esoteric—and, yes, it’s a lot to ponder. But the wonder of Terrain is how Cooper makes these ideas and his rigorous treatments sound so vital and compulsive, in conversation with a world well beyond the conservatory. Late in “Ripple the Sky,” for instance, the strings become especially grating, and Bleckmann seems ready to succumb. It’s like the dreamworlds of Tim Hecker turned inside out, so that the music is pure hellish attack. For its magnetic middle, “Expiation” sounds like Animal Collective circa Strawberry Jam, when skywriting vocals crisscrossed intricate layers of surrealist sequences. The piece’s climax is a proper dance number, with hypnotic harmonies webbing a throbbing beat to Landau’s half-yelled pleas for empathy. “Each tongue troubles its dark canker,” he repeats, demanding that the past be reconsidered for the continually changing present. During “Terrain,” a duet Cooper builds by processing both singers against the pensive cello drones of frequent collaborator Ashley Bathgate, Bleckmann is in the foreground, his voice given a kind of magisterial authority. Landau is below, squeezed until he sounds like a robot running out of electricity. The combination feels like hearing someone’s internal dialogue about some deep turmoil, an approach familiar from Moses Sumney’s græ or Bon Iver’s 22, A Million—extravagantly warped vocals and largely unadorned ones vying for limited space, slipping in and around one another in an uneasy exchange. It’s fitting that Cooper continues to dwell on time and how we handle it, since Terrain feels like his futuristic view of classical music, firmly rooted both in the distant past and music much closer to the present. His audacious interpretation of these librettos stems from tradition. The tools he uses to do so, though, border on production’s bleeding edge, so much so that, now and again, you will wonder if something’s wrong with the sound itself.

The Waterfall II,My Morning Jacket,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f087ead100081be06438536/1:1/w_160/The%20Waterfall%20II_My%20Morning%20Jacket.jpg,2020-07-13 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/my-morning-jacket-the-waterfall-ii/,ATO,"Before My Morning Jacket released The Waterfall back in 2015, Jim James was already teasing a follow-up. He mentioned that the band’s sessions in Stinson Beach, California, just north of San Francisco, were so productive that they left with at least two full-lengths’ worth of material. They considered releasing a double album and quickly abandoned that idea, instead splitting the songs into two distinct records, the second of which was originally slated for 2016. On the heels of that release, however, the band got caught up touring and James got busy writing a bunch of material, and that follow-up became known as their “lost” album. “It still exists,” James assured Rolling Stone in 2017. And now it finally exists for the rest of us. The surprise release of The Waterfall II ends the longest drought of new music in their 20-year career, but this isn’t really a lost album like Neil Young’s Homegrown. It doesn’t tell us anything about My Morning Jacket that we didn’t already know, and it doesn’t pose any what-ifs or prompt speculation about alternative timelines. Instead, it’s just more My Morning Jacket music: solid but seldom revelatory, new yet familiar. “Spinning My Wheels” opens with a dark cloud of buzzing static, which is quickly dispelled by a woozy keyboard theme—a simple, quiet demonstration of music’s power to provide clarity and direction. “I’ve been wrong for so long,” James sings, “risking my life for the sake of the song.” This might be a reference to his manic schedule during the early ’00s, when My Morning Jacket were touring constantly and James’ health suffered, leading to an incident during the Waterfall sessions when he herniated a disc in his back and was bedridden for two months. Is that busy schedule worth it, he seems to be asking himself, especially when you’re just doing it so you can do it again and again? Typically an album ends with such an epiphany, but The Waterfall II opens with that declaration and carries it through nine more songs. If its predecessor was about conflict and healing—it’s My Morning Jacket’s thorniest album, emotionally speaking—then this follow-up is more about what comes after that healing. It makes for a busier-sounding album. My Morning Jacket have always savored the collision of disparate styles and sounds (remember that cover of Pet Shop Boys’ “West End Girls”?), but lately that’s become a more prominent tactic for them. The band constructed several songs on The Waterfall by digitally piecing together bits of different recordings, and the resulting arrangements moved in weird, unexpected ways that could be thrilling in their unpredictability. Those moments sound a little  more scripted here. “Still Thinkin’” morphs from a chorus that recalls Herman’s Hermits into a crushed-velvet coda that’s closer to King Crimson, and while anything that places those two acts in the same sentence can’t be all bad, the pivot sounds disjointed and disorienting. “Climbing the Ladder” better integrates its varied sounds, marrying a two-tone rhythm section to some hyperactive honky-tonk guitars, like the Specials winning over a crowd in Bakersfield, but the equation still sounds a bit too clever. The best moments here are the most direct, the least demonstrative. We’ve heard My Morning Jacket in slow-jam mode many times before, but “Feel You” sounds weightless, its guitar arpeggios like fingers down a lover’s spine. It’s less about sex than the seduction beforehand and the languid moments afterwards, and My Morning Jacket don’t add anything extraneous to break that spell. On “Magic Bullet” they establish a lurching, squelchy beat and let it run its course; it never resolves, never uncoils, even as they layer more guitars and more saxophone on top of it. The song doesn’t veer from that straight line, and that restraint is what makes it sound so tense and frenetic. “I wonder where the time went,” James sings delicately on the closer “The First Time,” which sounds like one of many acknowledgements of the many years in between The Waterfall and The Waterfall II. Right now 2015 feels like a completely different geologic time period, so these songs can’t help but convey a sense of poignancy in their reminiscences. In that regard its surprise release is well timed; this satellite album, forever orbiting another, better record, may never escape its gravity, but it does ultimately carve out its own character and declare its own commentary. “Can tomorrow feel like it did back in the past?” James asks, once again soaring up into his famous falsetto. He makes it sound like this was his plan all along—to delay the release of these songs until that interim actually meant something and made them sound even better.

Is It Selfish If We Talk About Me Again,Kacy Hill,by: Matthew Strauss,News Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f0880d3100081be06438538/1:1/w_160/%20Is%20It%20Selfish%20If%20We%20Talk%20About%20Me%20Again_Kacy%20Hill.jpg,2020-07-13 05:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/kacy-hill-is-it-selfish-if-we-talk-about-me-again/,self-released,"Kacy Hill, the 26-year-old singer and erstwhile model from Phoenix, Arizona, explores acceptance across her second album, Is It Selfish If We Talk About Me Again, a collection that she’s self-released after five years with Kanye West’s G.O.O.D. Music. It was an affiliation that cast an austere, serious pallor over her 2017 debut, Like a Woman, and also placed her against Travis Scott on one of his earliest hits, “90210,” juxtaposing her real and fragile soprano with his lurid Auto-Tune raps. In a way, that song summarized her time with the label: unfairly cast as a complement or texture and not given space to focus on herself or her sound. The acceptance Hill seeks on Is It Selfish If We Talk About Me Again is primarily of herself. The album acts as a therapy session, filled with bits of advice that suggest countering times of pain or heightened worry with patience and trust. On the effervescent single “Porsche,” Hill sings, “No one’s gonna tell you/It isn’t all about you,” a guiding principle for an album whose core conflicts originate in loneliness, insecurity, and heartbreak. The issues are not trivial but common, and Hill acknowledges their universality and rejects the urge to dwell, instead focusing on the ways she can better herself. It’s comforting to hear a pop record embrace life’s in-betweens. As she admits her troubles, Hill embraces joy. Is It Selfish is bright and open, built with sounds that move and breathe with the artist, instead of existing beside her—as was often the case on her debut, when she and the beat seemed to take turns at the microphone. Hill co-produced all but one song on Is It Selfish, working primarily with Francis and the Lights, BJ Burton, and Jim-E Stack for a palette of adult contemporary synth-pop and early-’10s R&B. The atmosphere suits Hill, whose voice requires similarly delicate tones and supplemental melodies to add some heft to her careful singing. Previously, on her G.O.O.D. songs, which were often criminally minimal, it could sound like she was suffocating in total emptiness. There is now real momentum to her work, a feeling that you’re self-discovering alongside her. Still, Is It Selfish gains strength from Hill’s ever-present doubt. The album’s title, the opening line of “Much Higher,” is an admission that, no matter how much she hurts, Hill feels reluctant to open her own wounds at the risk of taking up others’ space and energy. It’s unclear what sort of answer she’d accept from the titular question (which pointedly lacks a question mark), but what is evident is that she wants to channel her diffidence into supporting and loving others. Later on “Much Higher,” Hill sings, “Do I tell you enough to thank you right?/’Cause nothing matters as much.” In Hill’s world, goodness can still emerge from darkness and you must confront your own faults in order to show love to others. Across the album, Hill details little moments—car rides, rainstorms, late nights lying awake—that give life to her emotional and psychological breakthroughs and setbacks. The album’s best and final song, “Dinner,” is a story of unrequited love that Hill colors with two small stories that capture the sweetness and plainness of everyday life: a night getting too high with this other person and needing their warmth, followed by the smell of California, bringing to mind the scent of “Arizona after warm thunderstorms,” the prettiest four words on the record. The song captures the album’s themes and moods succinctly: Hill is longing but resolute. When she encounters disappointment, she doesn’t aim to change the circumstances but hopes to share tenderness, singing, “You could love me the same.” She’s content.

GLOW,patten,by: Philip Sherburne,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f08897acf6369381604813e/1:1/w_160/Glow_Patten.jpg,2020-07-13 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/patten-glow/,555-5555,"One unforeseen side effect of the pandemic is that our collective sense of time has been thrown out of whack. The arrow of our days no longer flies true; it moves more like a crinkled paper plane—soaring briefly, plunging without notice, skidding gracelessly sideways across the floor. Sometimes it seems almost to loop backward. The London producer patten’s GLOW, recorded entirely during the UK’s lockdown, is propelled by this elastic timekeeping and steeped in the uneasy mood of the day. Created using a relatively stripped-down palette of synthesizers, it features almost no drums but could not quite be called ambient. It is restless in places and directionless in others; the mood is emotionally numb, except when it is sullen. Sometimes it is even a little boring, but not in an unpleasant way. Like a ticking clock in a quiet room, its blankness is the sort that leads the mind to wander. And the chance to wander, these days, is to be prized. The absence of beats marks a notable shift for patten. On early albums like 2011’s GLAQJO XAACSSO and 2014’s ESTOILE NAIANT, which kicked off a brief tenure on Warp, he harnessed a welter of hyper-compressed, low-bitrate sounds and squished them into a lumpy sort of beat music: Imagine a fistful of lossy YouTube rips fed through a Play-Doh noodle maker. Last year’s Flex took a step away from the psychedelic murk of those albums, incorporating the icy clarity of trap and grime along with some of the brawn of breakbeat-driven bass music. The results often sounded less original—and less interesting—than his foundational work. But with GLOW, patten reconnects with the fundamental sense of strangeness that has run through his best music, even without the tangled rhythms and messy textures that once were his stock in trade. On most of GLOW’s 14 tracks, patten plays his cards close to his chest. Each song is made up of a slim handful of moving parts that tend to spin slowly and aimlessly in place; loops trundle along in parallel, patterns stumbling almost imperceptibly. These sequences and arpeggios sound less like impeccably executed digital commands than the product of fingers idly drumming against the keys, the musician half-asleep in the studio chair, deep into the small hours of the night. There are no big emotional payoffs; most tracks just play out until they don’t anymore. In “Clandestine Modal,” distortion gradually creeps across an expanse of airy synths, covering them in fuzz, like mold consuming a piece of fruit. “Screen Burn,” mostly just heavy pads and buzzing FM bass, spins like a leaden mobile in thick, humid air. “Rorschach” suggests the theme from The Exorcist played on kalimba and run through dub delay, underscoring the anxious, horror-film mood that lies just below the album’s surface. Many of these pieces could work well as film cues. That goes equally for the simplest tracks—like the dissonant “Chronoblur,” its reverb as opaque as a frosted window—and the few that are more complex. “Memory Palace” unfolds with a particularly gratifying unpredictability, playing a garbled guitar melody off fluorescent-tube hum, like Oneohtrix Point Never remixing the Cure’s Pornography. “Valley Commerce” is even better. Over plodding, minor-key piano and soft horns, a palm-muted guitar rhythm rises in the mix, triggering unexpected memories of ’90s alt rock. It’s an attention-grabbing climax on an album that mostly keeps drama at arm’s length. Despite patten’s description of the record as an album with “no beats,” the faintest outline of a drum pattern appears on the penultimate track, “Lariat,” where rigid eighth-note taps click insistently against a gelatinous synth figure, as though determined to rein it in. Behind that, a fragment of what sounds like voice is spun backwards and forward, over and over, suggesting a bored filmmaker slumped over the edit bay, toggling a snippet of video back and forth. It’s an effective encapsulation of GLOW’s entire outlook: stuck in place, marking time, and stolidly waiting—for what, exactly, nobody quite knows.

Jump Rope Gazers,The Beths,by: Dayna Evans,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f087953100081be06438533/1:1/w_160/Jump%20Rope%20Gazers_The%20Beths.jpg,2020-07-13 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/the-beths-jump-rope-gazers/,Carpark,"The Beths’ exhilarating 2018 debut, Future Me Hates Me, was paced like a perfect basement show. Even the slow burners accelerated into overdrive, with singer and guitarist Elizabeth Stokes’ wry, self-aware lyrics serving as perfect shout-along fodder. The two-year wait for their follow up has felt like hanging around for a very late encore, and in the opening minutes of Jump Rope Gazers, you’d be forgiven for thinking those ecstatic and restless Beths are back. On “I’m Not Getting Excited,” Stokes repeats the song’s title as the music tells a very different story—a guitar solo ascends and the tension cranks tighter until the song explodes. But it doesn’t last long: that kinetic energy falls off a cliff by the third track and never really comes back. Instead, Jump Rope Gazers presents a sleeker, slower, more muted version of the band. The title track is a romantic ballad reminiscent of sentimental ‘90s and ’00s megahits like Sixpence None The Richer’s “Kiss Me” and Lifehouse’s “Hanging By A Moment.” It’s a novel and welcome departure for the band, but by the overly polished pop production of “Do You Want Me Now” and emo seriousness in “Out of Sight,” the novelty wears off and the album loses cohesion. The Beths might want to show their vulnerable side,  but they were plenty vulnerable and musically diverse on Future Me Hates Me. The issue is that they do so on Jump Rope Gazers at the expense of their consistency and typically unbreakable tightness. Where FMHM pushed forward, Gazers simply ambles. The songs are enlivened by stacked harmonies and girl-group-inspired call-and-response chants, breathing life and memorable hooks into songs that crave them. Those slaloming vocal lines, taking strange side paths to their harmonic resolutions,  are a reminder that The Beths met while studying jazz at the University of Auckland, and at their most complex, the vocals suggest a hybrid of pop-punk and Motown. Stokes’ neurotic lyrics have always made singing along with Beths songs that much more satisfying, and on Jump Rope Gazers, those details are still given room to shine. “I wish that I could wish you well,” she sings on “Mars, the God of War.” “Instead I’m hitting my head/And hitting backspace on ‘Can’t you just go to hell’.” Stokes has always presented her inner monologues in their most unvarnished form, and she’s in fine form here: “I’ve never been the dramatic type/But if I don’t see your face tonight / I… well I guess I’ll be fine,” she sings on “Jump Rope Gazers.” While these tidbits keep the sense of fun in The Beths’ music, they aren’t enough to fully invigorate their second album among the more sluggish songs.

Meddle,Pink Floyd,by: Andy Cush,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f060be3ca5f171c3b771352/1:1/w_160/meddle_pink%20floyd.jpg,2020-07-12 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/pink-floyd-meddle/,Harvest,"It was a single note, flickering out like a beacon to lead a wayward ship through the night. Pink Floyd had no new songs prepared when they started recording in early 1971, but they did have access to the legendary Abbey Road Studios, and free rein from their label to mess around until they found their way. They spent weeks improvising with each member isolated from what the others were playing—a harebrained search for the sort of strange and spontaneous inspiration that their old leader, guitarist and songwriter Syd Barrett, conjured freely. They called the results “Nothings 1-24”: Predictably, they were almost entirely unusable—except for this one note: a high B, played on a piano near the top of its range, warped by the undulations of a rotating Leslie speaker. It was piercing, but slightly obscured, as if it had traveled a great distance to reach your awareness. “We could never recreate the feeling of this note in the studio, especially the particular resonance between the piano and the Leslie,” drummer Nick Mason wrote later. So they used the demo tape, and began composing around it. “Echoes” grew from that note into something awesome: a 23-minute psych-prog voyage from tranquility to triumph to desolation and back, with a riff like a lightning bolt striking open sea, and a pillowy lead vocal keeping you cozy and safe below deck. It was the first song Pink Floyd completed for Meddle, their conflicted and brilliant sixth album. After a period of flailing for direction, “Echoes” offered a path toward the populist art-rock epics that would make Pink Floyd one of the most successful bands in history. But it was also a kind of ending. During the late ’60s, under Barrett’s mad reign, Pink Floyd was turbulent and intuitive, balancing his fairytale songs with the sort of chaotic and noisy improvisations that presumably inspired Sonic Youth’s Kim Gordon to name her dog after him. As their fame rose and bassist Roger Waters seized ever-tighter creative control across the ‘70s, the music increasingly favored solemnity over whimsy, formalism over exploration. “Echoes”—and Meddle as a whole—sit at the intersection of these two approaches, offering a hazy preview of Pink Floyd’s future as international stars without yet abandoning their past as visionary young ruffians. From Pink Floyd’s founding in 1965 to Barrett’s ouster in 1968, they were the de facto house band of London’s nascent psychedelic scene. The members, a group of brainy misfits who’d assembled while attending university for art and architecture, mostly kept a professional distance from actual psychedelics—with the exception of Barrett, who indulged heartily. Soon after the release of Pink Floyd’s debut album, 1967’s The Piper at the Gates of Dawn, he became withdrawn and erratic: He refused to participate in performances, sat unresponsive as people tried to talk to him, sabotaged a TV appearance by standing still when he was supposed to mime along to a backing track. His bandmates grew frustrated by these impediments to their success. One day in February 1968, they decided they simply wouldn’t pick him up on the way to their show that night. That was the end of his time in Pink Floyd. Barrett recorded two solo albums, then withdrew from public life until his death in 2006. “I’m disappearing, avoiding most things” he told a Rolling Stone interviewer in 1971, the year Pink Floyd released Meddle without him. Two of the last songs he recorded with them were deemed too dark and unsettling for release until several decades later. “I’ve been looking all over the place for a place for me,” he speak-sings in one of them, his voice taking on a theatrical Mad Hatter edge. “But it ain’t anywhere.” Syd Barrett’s story fits neatly within two late-’60s archetypes: the acid casualty and the doomed rock star. The reality is probably sadder, and more ordinary. With the rock star myth no longer as culturally potent as it once was, and more nuanced contemporary understanding of LSD’s relationship to disorders like schizophrenia—it can precipitate psychotic breaks in people who are already disposed toward them, but it doesn’t cause them by itself—he looks simply like a man with a serious mental illness, no desire for fame, and no one around who understood how to help him. Nick Mason, in his memoir Inside Out, returns multiple times to the callousness with which he and his bandmates treated their frontman while he was unraveling, presenting their disregard for Barrett as a consequence of their fixation on making it as musicians. Beginning with 1973’s The Dark Side of the Moon, their post-Barrett superstar years can be seen as a series of attempts to reckon with his absence and their guilt, even as they moved away from his vision of the band: Dark Side, a suite about how the pressures of modern life can drive a person to insanity, exploring mental anguish by the light of a lava lamp; Wish You Were Here, an elegiac and sometimes cynical album presented more or less explicitly as a tribute to Barrett; The Wall, a rock opera about a singer’s increasing alienation from society and his loved ones. These albums’ status as dorm-room classics can make their preoccupation with psychological instability seem like a bit of trippy kitsch, but it seems unlikely their creators see it that way. There were six years and six albums between The Piper at the Gates of Dawn and The Dark Side of the Moon. During this limbo period, Pink Floyd seemed to be avoiding a confrontation about their identity, who they really were without their leader. 1968’s A Saucerful of Secrets mostly follows in the style of Piper; it came as Barrett was on his way out of the band, and is the only Pink Floyd album where he and Gilmour, his friend since secondary school, both appear. After that, there was a film soundtrack, a double LP with a live recording and a series of pieces the members recorded individually, and a ponderous quasi-symphonic work assembled in large part by a guest arranger. “Meddle was the first album we had worked on together as a band in the studio since A Saucerful of Secrets,” Mason writes, positioning Pink Floyd’s sixth album as the true follow-up to their second, and their first proper collaborative statement without any involvement from Barrett. Making Meddle took the better part of a year, thanks to the band’s touring schedule and their insistence on doing things in “the most complicated way possible,” as Mason puts it. The every-man-for-himself jams that produced the “Echoes” piano sound were only the beginning: There were fruitless attempts at recording vocals backwards, pedals wired up the wrong way, a dog trained to howl along to music brought in as a collaborator. At some point, they convinced EMI, their label, that Abbey Road lacked the technical sophistication for the music they were trying to make, and moved the operation to George Martin’s recently opened AIR Studio, which had the state-of-the-art 16-track tape machines Abbey Road lacked. Soon, Pink Floyd would marshal the precision of new recording technologies toward albums that were carefully planned from the top down, with every moment derived from an overarching theme and tuned for maximum impact. On Meddle, they’d arrived nearly at the rich and enveloping sonics of Dark Side, but not yet at its elaborate compositional holism. No other Pink Floyd album sits in quite the same sweet spot: huge and ambitious but beholden to no extramusical narrative, pushing at rock’s limits without reaching beyond them for the virtues of cinema and theater. It needs no three-act storyline or operatic themes and reprisals to flatten you to your couch and scorch a hole in your brain; the thunder of the band is enough to do that on its own. Progressive rock was on the rise in early-’70s UK, and punk wasn’t far behind it. Pink Floyd would eventually come to be associated with the indulgences of the former, but they were always an imperfect fit for prog—they were certainly indulgent, but they simply lacked the instrumental virtuosity of bands like Yes and King Crimson. Early on, they had as much to do with noise rock, though the term was still decades from being invented. Johnny Rotten famously wore an “I Hate Pink Floyd” t-shirt onstage with the Sex Pistols; not long after, his deconstructed jams with Public Image Ltd. weren’t so different from the freakouts of “Careful With That Axe, Eugene,” or “Interstellar Overdrive.” Meddle has both: the sweep of Floyd’s proggy later days and the scrappiness of their origins. The mostly instrumental opener “One of These Days” sounds like a Camaro rocketing through the cosmos. It is a visceral thrill that exists only for its own sake, introducing Meddle with a bit of hard rock sci-fi that does nothing to prepare you for the narcotized drift of the rest of the first side. The album’s first lyrics (aside from a brief spoken interjection in “One of These Days”) do a better job of setting the languid prevailing tone: “A cloud of eiderdown draws around me, softening the sound/Sleepytime, and I lie with my love by my side, and she’s breathing low,” Gilmour sings to open “A Pillow of Winds.” Whether consciously or not, these lines contain strong echoes of Barrett, who sang of being “Alone in the clouds all blue/Lying on an eiderdown” on The Piper at the Gates of Dawn. If the Pink Floyd of Dark Side and onward grappled with Barrett’s legacy in their subject matter while shaking off his direct musical influence, Meddle is indebted to him as a musician without yet directly acknowledging him as a man. Its only inessential song is “Seamus,” featuring the aforementioned canine, whose blend of blues pastiche and playful sound collage is the clearest attempt to replicate the madcap character of Floyd’s earlier era. But where Barrett might have located some essential strangeness at the meeting of slide guitar and singing dog, the rest of Pink Floyd seem to believe the juxtaposition itself is enough. The lyrics—“I was in the kitchen/Seamus, that’s the dog, was outside”—are almost perverse in their refusal to engage with anything substantial. “Fearless” is another matter. It focuses on the quiet dignity of an “idiot” following his own path up a hill while a crowd jeers from below that he’ll never make the top. As with much of Meddle, the guitar seems to proceed in slow motion, matching his humble climb, a stately ascending riff with ringing open strings that Waters played using an alternate tuning Barrett taught him years earlier. Gilmour takes the lead vocal, and his sleepy delivery—which usually implies a state of stoned beatitude—instead conveys sadness and futility beneath the determination. “Fearless” is among Pink Floyd’s greatest and most moving songs, heartbreaking even as the idiot seems to prevail over the voices that tell him he won’t. If the band felt the story held any resonance with their own personal trials, they didn’t show it overtly. “Fearless” ends with a recording of a football crowd bellowing out the anthem of Liverpool F.C., framing its tale of perseverance with the simple good feeling of an underdog defeating a rival. Mason could never understand Waters’ insistence on this strange coda, especially given that the bassist was a devoted Arsenal supporter. Maybe his affinity was for the familial sentiment of the song itself, a Rodgers and Hammerstein show tune adopted by Liverpool fans after a local group turned it into a pop hit, rather than its sporting context. “Walk on with hope in your heart,” fans can be heard singing as “Fearless” fades out, “and you’ll never walk alone.” But Meddle’s real reason for being is “Echoes,” which takes up the entirety of the album’s second side. Ambitious beyond anything Pink Floyd had attempted before, wild beyond anything they’d attempt after, it takes the origin of life itself as its subject, another humble ascent. In lilting harmony, Gilmour and Wright describe a scene deep below the sea: “No one knows the wheres or whys/But something stirs and something tries/And starts to climb towards the light.” As the song’s storm gathers force, its focus shifts to an ambiguous chance encounter between two people, descendents of those stirring amoebae. The drums grow more forceful; the guitars turn from vapor to liquid to solid to flame. In place of a climax, there is disintegration. The rhythm halts, the bottom drops out, and for one last time, Pink Floyd sound more like avant-garde improvisers than stadium rock musicians: groaning, twisting, screeching, expressing the complicated freedom of coming untethered from any plan. Eventually, the beacon of that high B on the piano returns. The band reassembles and finishes the song. Later, they release one of rock’s greatest albums with Dark Side of the Moon, and solidify their status as icons forever. As if in a dream, Barrett makes a final visit to the studio as they record Wish You Were Here, its followup. He wanders into Abbey Road as an uninvited guest, bald and barely recognizable, seeming confused and disengaged when they play him samples of an album they wrote partly about him. Pink Floyd find their way through the storm of his absence, and eventually steer into another one: ego, money, fame, their corrosive effects on brotherhood. But for now, they are at the center of the turbulence, making noise, lingering in darkness and uncertainty until it’s time to climb out. Get the Sunday Review in your inbox every weekend.

Workingman’s Dead / The Angel’s Share,Grateful Dead,by: Stephen Thomas Erlewine,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f05ee7fca5f171c3b7712e7/1:1/w_160/workingman's%20dead_grateful%20dead.jpg,2020-07-11 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/grateful-dead-workingmans-dead-the-angels-share/,Rhino,"Freshly busted in New Orleans and teetering upon the edge of financial ruin, the Grateful Dead began 1970 in dire need of a new beginning. Remarkably for a band who had a habit of making their own bad luck, the Dead didn’t miss this opportunity. Operating with a focus they rarely possessed, the band returned to their folk-blues roots and knocked out their fourth album, Workingman’s Dead, in a matter of days, transforming the trajectory of their career in the process. Often grouped together with its successor American Beauty—reasonably so, considering how Beauty is carved from the same rustic material and appeared just a matter of months later—Workingman’s Dead fit into the anti-psychedelia wave that swept through American rock’n’roll at the dawn of the 1970s. The zeitgeist shifted away from trippy excesses after the release of the Band’s Music From Big Pink in 1968 but the Grateful Dead found greater inspiration in the eponymous 1969 debut from Crosby, Stills & Nash, gravitating toward their harmony-laden homey folk-rock. Stephen Stills and David Crosby traveled similar circles to the Dead, eventually wandering out to Mickey Hart’s ranch in Marin County, a place that doubled as the group’s unofficial headquarters. Stills and Crosby encouraged Jerry Garcia, Bob Weir, and Phil Lesh to sing harmonies, a skill that would come in handy when it came to recording the new batch of songs Garcia was writing with his lyricist Robert Hunter. What came easily to CSN was work for the Dead. Garcia’s partner Mountain Girl—aka Carolyn Adams, a former Merry Prankster who wound up marrying the guitarist in 1981—laughed about the process to band biographer David Browne, claiming in his 2015 book So Many Roads: The Life And Times Of The Grateful Dead, “They were expected to sing all those parts, and it didn’t go well. It sounded like cats howling.” It’s possible to hear that howl echoing through Workingman’s Dead. The trio’s voices don’t quite mesh, sometimes hitting a dissonant chord, sometimes scrambling for the same note; their effort isn’t merely heard, it’s felt. All that fumbling winds up as an asset on Workingman’s Dead, adding a bit of messiness to the tight performances. Much of that precision can be chalked up to how the Grateful Dead mapped out all of Workingman’s Dead prior to recording the album with their live-sound team of Bob Matthews and Betty Cantor, a pair who shared a co-production credit with the band. Nothing was left to chance. Matthews, Cantor, and Garcia drew up a provisional sequencing during these sessions, circulating this rough draft on demo cassettes among the band. Rehearsals came next, then the rapid sessions, outtakes of which can be heard on The Angel’s Share, a digital-only collection released alongside the 50th Anniversary edition of Workingman’s Dead. The chief insight provided by The Angel’s Share is how Garcia kept the Dead on track, calling for changes in tempo and directing the arrangements so neither the song nor vibe is obscured. Compared to its willfully spacy predecessor Aoxomoxoa—an album the band recorded twice, as the band exhausted the possibilities of a new 16-track tape recorder while exhausting the patience and wallet of Warner Bros—the simplicity of Workingman’s Dead is bracing, even refreshing, but it’s the earthy, weathered grooves that give the album its distinct character and power. A crucial part of the Dead’s simplification was relying almost entirely on songs written by Garcia and Hunter in tandem. Jerry wound up singing nearly all the songs, too, sharing the lead with Weir on the bluegrass breakdown “Cumberland Blues” and turning over “Easy Wind,” a blues written by Hunter on his own, to Ron “Pigpen” McKernan, the band’s husky original frontman. If it weren’t for “Easy Wind,” Pigpen wouldn’t have registered on Workingman’s Dead at all, his absence a reflection of both his increasing alcoholism (he’d die of the disease three years later) and how the songs largely traded blues and experimentation for folk and country. Drummer Bill Kreutzmann would later claim in his memoir Deal: My Three Decades Of Drumming, Dreams, and Drugs With The Grateful Dead that Workingman’s Dead and American Beauty represented their “Bakersfield era,” a nod to the country music coming out of California in the 1960s. Certainly, the band made no attempt to conceal their debt to Merle Haggard—the album’s title is a nod to Hag’s 1969 number one country single “Workin’ Man Blues”—but Bakersfield country explicitly tangled with modern concerns, addressing contemporary issues in its lyrics and embracing electrified instruments. With its pronounced twang, only “Cumberland Blues” echoed the style of Bakersfield. The rest of the album is devoted to high lonesome ballads, Sunday afternoon singalongs, and fleet fingerpicking straight out of Appalachia. Inspired equally by old folk tales and black & white movies, Hunter spun legends of mines, dire wolves, and train conductors. His lyrical obsessions may not be all that dissimilar from Robbie Robertson, who populated Band records with Confederate soldiers and farmhands, but Hunter deliberately confounded and conflated his time frame, so it was hard to tell where the old, weird America ended and the paisley underground began. ”Casey Jones” makes hay of this confusion, with Garcia singing, “Driving that train/High on cocaine,” with an audible grin, recognizing that while Hunter may have based his verse on an old blues song documenting a turn-of-the-century train disaster, his verse could be heard as a rallying call for the underground. “Uncle John’s Band,” the band’s first charting hit, walked a similar line, sounding like a campfire perennial while being finely attuned to the hippie hangover of the early 1970s, the period when all the dreams of love and peace started to get a tad tarnished. Appropriately, the scaled-down Workingman’s Dead can be seen as reflecting the moment when hippies retreated from the universal aspirations to personal concerns, a perfect soundtrack to hunkering down on a commune or maybe learning how to grow up while ensconced in a suburb. The complete performance that pushes the 50th Anniversary Edition of Workingman’s Dead into Super Deluxe status captures this uneasy change, only from a different angle. Plucked from the Dead’s multi-night stint at the Capitol Theatre in Port Chester, New York in February 1971, it finds the group navigating the absence of Mickey Hart. Weir mentions the missing Hart from the stage, claiming the drummer wasn’t feeling well, which wasn’t a lie but his illness stemmed from his unease at discovering how his father Lenny fleeced the Dead for many thousands of dollars while serving as the group’s manager. Without Hart, the group sounds lean and fleet, nearly as simple as they were in the studio for Workingman’s Dead but allowing themselves plenty of space to jam and boogie. The set features several songs that would form the backbone of American Beauty, including the Weir-led “Sugar Magnolia” and “Truckin’”, a pair of tunes essential to the mythology of the band and their popularity through the 1970s. Hearing them as part of this (very) extended coda to the original album helps hammer home how different Workingman’s Dead is from the rest of the Dead’s catalog. American Beauty is superficially similar, mining the same folk-country blend, finding space for vocalists that weren’t Garcia and sanding off the rough edges apparent throughout Workingman’s Dead. It’s a smoother listen, but like any homespun art, the imperfections are what makes Workingman’s Dead compelling. Within those ragged harmonies, hard strums, and fables, it’s possible to hear the Grateful Dead transform from psychedelic upstarts to an American institution.","Newly reissued with bonus material for its 50th anniversary, the Dead’s fourth album returned them to their folk-blues roots and transformed the trajectory of their career in the process.

"Kite Symphony, Four Variations",Roberto Carlos Lange ,by: Philip Sherburne,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f06081b7bb7acb328d57e4b/1:1/w_160/kite%20symphony%20four%20variations_roberto%20carlos%20lange.jpg,2020-07-11 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/roberto-carlos-lange-kite-symphony-four-variations/,Ballroom Marfa,"Marfa, Texas is famous for its enormous bowl of sky. Just look at it: Here it is glazed pink, here it’s filled with marshmallow clouds, and here it’s spattered like a house painter's drop cloth. In the 1970s, the minimalist sculptor Donald Judd began buying up property in the Chihuahuan Desert town; punctuating its emptiness with his cryptic cement and aluminum boxes, he minted the area’s reputation as a locus of elusive awe. In the decades since, Marfa, with a population of fewer than 2000 people, has become America’s unlikeliest cultural hub, drawing artists from around the world to grapple with its landscape and its light, no matter how quixotic the endeavor might seem. In 2016, after years of planning, the octogenarian artist Robert Irwin completed untitled (dawn to dusk), an empty building meant to channel some of the region’s intangible alchemy of space and shadow. When asked what he hoped to achieve, he said mischievously, “I’m trying to grab a will-o’-the-wisp.” How do you capture such an expanse in sound? Roberto Carlos Lange, better known as Helado Negro, and the visual artist Kristi Sword went to extravagant lengths to answer that question; the answer they came up with, a multimedia project called Kite Symphony,  ballooned to such an extent that its current form is nearly as amorphous, and as difficult to describe, as the object of their investigation. The piece, still a work in progress, currently incorporates sound and light sculptures, handmade instruments, and the wind itself. It’s a lot to wrap one’s head around, but all began simply enough: After an initial research trip in November, Lange and Sword returned to Marfa in March for what was meant to be a three-week residency making art out of kites. But as the pandemic hit the United States and lockdown orders went into place, the couple settled in for an extended stay, and the project evolved. They transformed mylar kites into “ephemeral sculptures” that react to light and wind. The two artists fashioned kalimbas out of gourds and disassembled toys. Lange recorded sketches on a church organ and finagled access to a baby grand in a shuttered restaurant. Armed with a sheaf of Sword’s graphic scores—drawings meant to be used in place of traditional musical notation—he recruited Texas-raised violist Jeanann Dara and recorded her on site at the Chinati Foundation, Judd’s 340-acre outdoor museum, as she improvised responses to tactile cues: Imagine the sound of a cactus, say, or Express the feeling of wind on your skin. Working out of a local studio, Lange mixed all of these stray sounds together, along with remote contributions from cornetist Rob Mazurek, to yield Kite Symphony: Four Variations—a free-flowing collage that doubles as a snapshot of the project’s sprawl. Lange’s work has always resisted categorization; after making experimental beat music in the ’00s, he has evolved into an unusual sort of singer-songwriter, movingly examining the nuances of Latinx identity in songs that blur the line between synth pop and folk. But the wordless, beatless Kite Symphony, even more exploratory than previous albums under his birth name, sails far beyond the known coordinates of the Helado Negro universe. Totaling a concise 32 minutes, the album’s four movements bob and weave between purposeful form and pure abstraction. The record opens with a strange, otherworldly sound—part start-up chime, part engine turning over, it might be a radio frequency intercepted from a distant galaxy—and quickly settles into a gentle groove of bright, rounded tones tossed by an incidental rhythm, like agates rolling in the tide. This is as clearly defined as the music will get; the only constant is that no sound or element retains its shape for long. Birdsong bleeds into dubbed-out chord clusters. Bowed tones duet with scraped metal. Timbres darken like sudden storm clouds; rustling noises suggest the presence of critters skittering in the underbrush. There are expressive, deeply lyrical passages where viola, brass, and piano layer in luminous harmonies; there are also melodies so formless it’s easy to believe that they were created by the wind whipping through rusty gates. Like Hiroshi Yoshimura’s Music for Nine Postcards and GREEN, it is not so much ambient as environmental music, teasingly blurring focus as it slips between foreground and background. While Kite Symphony is an indirect product of the pandemic, the music is ultimately marked by its lightness of spirit, as if to say, “This too shall pass.” A sense of place is implicit in crickets, distant traffic, blowing winds, and other field-recorded sounds, and perhaps a sense of humor, too: At one point, the music drops out and a buzzing insect takes an unforeseen solo, its wings brushing against Lange’s microphone. But most of the time, it’s anyone’s guess exactly how any of these sounds are being made. The whole thing is a conjuring trick. What’s remarkable is how Lange and his collaborators give shape to something so intangible. Even when the music is at its haziest, there are submerged rhythms and hidden patterns at work. That’s true on a macro level, too: The final movement builds to a wonderfully satisfying climax as Dara’s multi-tracked viola traces the faintest suggestion of a line against a slowly oscillating drone, like a swallow barely visible against the evening sky. Dara’s playing, in fact, often feels like the music’s lifeblood. There are moments when her bowing rolls from the unmistakably physical sound of horse hair against metal strings to ghostly overtone. It’s moments like these that Lange and his collaborators’ kinship with Robert Irwin becomes clear: They, too, are grabbing will-o’-the-wisps, and Kite Symphony: Four Variations is alive with them.","Lange, better known as Helado Negro, teams with the visual artist Kristi Sword for a sprawling and inspired project paying tribute to the Marfa, Texas sky.

One Year,Model Home,by: Hubert Adjei-Kontoh,Associate Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5ed57819dad4216f71c67656/1:1/w_160/One%20Year_Model%20Home.jpg,2020-07-11 05:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/model-home-one-year/,Disciples,"Model Home’s music would blend right in with a dystopia. The deteriorating sounds of Patrick Cain’s electronics would be impossible to distinguish from the constant construction that is the score of any contemporary city; NappyNappa’s enigmatic missives would be lost in the roar of public service announcements, personalized advertisements, and omnipresent sirens. Of course, the experimental duo is from Washington D.C., which has always produced bands that reflect the inherent paradox of fighting for freedom in a city pockmarked with monuments to the slave trade. Model Home’s One Year mirrors this conflict; NappyNappa’s urgent spoken word breaks through the waves of Patrick Cain’s synthetic distortion. Built on the edifice of dub sound systems and DIY basement clatter, this monument to a year-long experiment in collective improvisation is made up of slabs of textured noise and decayed vocals. On the world-weary “Faultfinder,” a woozy number that sounds like it was recorded on a warped tape, Nappy’s vocals expand and shrink to a steady drumbeat. His voice buzzes and squeaks through the haze of a merry-go-round-like melody, yet the fuzz clears when he finds it necessary to deliver a pointed statement of contempt: “Ain’t no equality/Inequality only leveraged to disperse.” Heard through the warbled drum loops, his observations are like futurist road signs. On “Push Thru,” Nappa narrates a series of thoughts he has while riding a bus route in a deranged Auto-Tune: “Just got to have faith in my surroundings/I wouldn’t be here if it wasn’t for you.” He manipulates his voice to match the acceleration and deceleration of the percussion; Cain will cut his voice up, slow it down, and hollow it out till it sounds like a voicemail. This creates the illusion that you are hearing Nappa shout on a soapbox in a city full of automatons, mixing prophetic judgements with dispassionate inquiry in an attempt to wake the dead. On “Grip” Nappa shouts, “Processed prescriptions, polluted perceptions/Dirty lenses makes for a cruddy vision,” balancing biting critique with quotidian observation. His calls for self-actualization are jammed between corrupted drums and satellite blips. You hear his voice attempting to break through the insipid chatter of a digitally distracted society, filled with people convinced that they are communicating through “social media,” while they numb themselves and proudly declare that they are unable to concentrate. To reduce fuzz around the words would provide a clarity that rings false in an increasingly obfuscated world. So they surround Nappa’s words with clutter, noise, trash. Take “Baya Style,” an ESG-influenced caper lying in the middle of the album; its pots ’n’ pans rhythm and Mantronix production are ’80s boombox material. Feedback propels Nappa’s testimonial—“Buy now, buy now/1-800-Buy Now”—to blurry heights; the squeals his keyboards make cut through Nappa’s words, which are slowly blunted by reverb. The two musicians mutually agree to disappear the false boundary between producer and speaker. “No Barcode & Boundless” is the final word from this conflict-prone alliance, fusing two songs that appeared on separate mixtapes. “Boundless” comes first, built on a sound that mimics a revving car and Nappa’s mutterings. In the next section, Cain creates a horrorcore atmosphere by lengthening wind-chime notes and dividing them with a snare that comes in at the oddest of intervals, while Nappa swerves from lines about destroying your foes to respecting your mother. In this muck, he delivers his most clear statement of ethics: “No barcode you can’t buy me/I don’t even write cursive so you can’t sign me.” This selection of songs from their catalog is an edited transcript of a vital dialogue. Their music is messy and intoxicating because it was forged in this fire of equity. It’s not possible to ditch long-held identities without conflict and without conversation; often, the latter leads to the former. What NappyNappa and Patrick Cain say is that we should embrace rupture if we ever want to truly partner with each other.","The experimental D.C. duo’s latest album is made up of slabs of textured noise and decayed vocals, but they use their DIY chaos as a radical force against all hierarchies.

Unfollow the Rules,Rufus Wainwright,by: Zach Schonfeld,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f04e7f6464fe661509ab560/1:1/w_160/Unfollow%20the%20Rules_Rufus%20Wainwright.jpg,2020-07-10 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/rufus-wainwright-unfollow-the-rules/,UMG,"At 46, Rufus Wainwright is around the same age Leonard Cohen was when he wrote “Hallelujah,” the song Wainwright transmitted into a million tween bedrooms by way of a powerful device known as the Shrek soundtrack. And he’s the same age his father, Loudon Wainwright III, was when he released History, the 1992 album sometimes regarded as a late-career masterpiece. That’s not to say the younger Wainwright has crafted a masterpiece of his own (or an American Idol standby), but he knows lengthy careers can ebb and flow⁠—it’s literally in his blood⁠—and isn’t shy about comparing his own arc to big-name forebears: When he first announced his new album, Unfollow the Rules, back in February, he described it as an attempt to “emulate the greats of yore whose second acts produced their finest work,” citing Cohen’s The Future and Paul Simon’s Graceland. Unfollow the Rules, we were to understand, is a long-awaited new beginning. But unlike The Future, which absorbed icy synthesizers into Cohen’s apocalyptic soothsaying, or Graceland, which drew from South African styles like township jive, Unfollow the Rules isn’t the sort of album that’s interested in reckoning with the contemporary pop landscape. Maybe that will come as a relief to Wainwright’s fans, who’ve waited nearly a decade since his last proper pop album, 2012’s Mark Ronson-assisted Out of the Game, and who have always been drawn to the singer’s old-soul aesthetic. Swapping Ronson for veteran producer Mitchell Froom, Unfollow the Rules isn’t so much a reinvention as an opulently crafted highlight reel, a career-spanning sampler of Wainwright’s styles and guises. Nearly every corner of Wainwright’s discography⁠, save for the operas⁠, is here and accounted for: the swooning piano -pop of 2001’s career-best Poses (“Romantical Man”), the outlandishly lush orchestration of Want Two and Release the Stars (“Unfollow the Rules,” “Early Morning Madness”), the solo meandering of All Days Are Nights: Songs for Lulu (“My Little You”). He even finds time to revisit the ’70s AOR sparkle of Out of the Game on “Damsel in Distress,” a Joni Mitchell tribute ornamented with Hunky Dory handclaps. If these reference points seem a little retro, consider that they’re several hundred years more current than the Shakespeare sonnets that occupied Wainwright’s last release. Besides, the singer has spent the last eight years settling into married life, raising a young daughter, and writing an opera about an embattled Roman emperor—not jockeying for relevance or mugging with Kendrick Lamar at the Grammys. That sense of domestic, middle-age contentedness fills the album, from the striding English folk of “Peaceful Afternoon,” in which Wainwright toasts to a happy marriage and hopes his husband’s face is the last he sees before he dies, to the lullaby-esque “My Little You,” in which he regales his daughter with embarrassing dad stories. When Wainwright does veer from his comfort zone, flirting with sci-fi synths and celestial flourishes, the results range from jumbled (“This One’s for the Ladies [That Lunge]”) to downright grating (“Hatred”). Mostly, though, his songwriting is as sharp and cheeky as ever. “You Ain’t Big” satirizes provincial fame (and packs a decent punchline), while “Alone Time” subverts its plea for solitude (“I need a little alone time / A little dream time”) with harmonies so luxuriant that Wainwright sounds like he’s accompanied by a choir of himself. (Had it been written in 2020, it could be a song about the trials of quarantining with a toddler.) The album’s sound is sleek and full of grand, sweeping climaxes that occasionally oversell the songwriting. But if Unfollow the Rules is sometimes in want of a unifying idea or theme, Wainwright’s dreamy voice provides a throughline. With its immaculate harmonies and wry humor, “Trouble in Paradise”—a sardonic take on the fashion industry—sounds so much like Queen that the Bohemian Rhapsody producers probably could have slotted it in the film without Bryan Singer noticing. Numerous other songs erupt in layered, multipart harmonies. Wainwright’s tenor voice has matured and deepened—listen to the nasal-voiced 24-year-old heard on 1998’s “Foolish Love,” and then hear present-day Wainwright deliver the wonderful, operatic climax of “Unfollow the Rules.” Suffice it to say, those are not notes an aging Leonard Cohen could have reached.

Proof,Galcher Lustwerk,by: Shawn Reynaldo,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f029997ca5f171c3b771095/1:1/w_160/Proof_Galcher%20Lustwerk.jpg,2020-07-10 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/galcher-lustwerk-proof/,Ghostly International,"A Cleveland native who’s been based in New York for more than a decade, Galcher Lustwerk first appeared in 2013 with the now classic 100% Galcher mixtape. Since then, he’s quietly amassed an extensive catalog while working under a variety of names (including Road Hog and 420, and as one half of the duo Studio OST), cooly connecting the dots between smoky R&B, fantastical strains of hip-hop, and the kind of smoothly melodic deep house that Midwestern legends like Larry Heard first cooked up in the late 1980s. Although Lustwerk has tinkered with his aesthetic over the years, 2019’s Information, his third full-length under the alias and first for Ghostly International, documented a subtle, albeit significant expansion of his repertoire. Intermittently abandoning the dancefloor altogether, the low-key LP folded in meditative bits of jazz and ambient while exploring feelings of late-night weariness. That process continues on the Proof EP, a quality companion piece that’s similarly steeped in a sense of exhaustion, even when a bumping beat is present. “Proof” is something for the DJs, its low-slung house groove fleshed out with gleaming pads, tiny flecks of piano, and moody vocal clips. As always, Lustwerk is almost impossibly cool on the mic, even as he swaps his usual narrative approach for a melange of stream-of-consciousness ad libs. He’s back to storytelling on the sultry, sax-laden “I Had to Slow It Down,” in which he luxuriates inside an updated New Romantic template, his voice bleary and gravelly. The confident “Graham” exaggerates his vocal affect even further, dispensing with drums entirely and ultimately sounding like a woozy excerpt from a Southern rap mixtape. These creative departures are some of Proof’s strongest offerings, but those looking for something with a vintage Galcher feel might be satisfied by the lush keys and gently clicking rhythm of digital-only cut “Leave,” along with Lustwerk’s new version of “Another Story,” a repurposed track from Information that he’s reinforced with a sturdier beat; to the latter he also brings an extra shot of bravado that makes lines like “I’m in New York and I’m Black (Black)/I can make beats, I can rap (rap)” sound especially potent. Although those lyrics were penned long ago, they take on added significance right now, as dance music publicly wrestles with structural racism and Black erasure. There’s been a renewed call not just to reassert the music’s Black roots, but also to examine and dismantle the many ways that the industry and the culture around it continue to place Black artists at a disadvantage. Lustwerk—who’s never previously been particularly vocal on social media—has been right in the thick of the dialogue, most notably when he recently tweeted a long list (which he’s since deleted) of microaggressions, indignities, and racist situations he has encountered as a touring DJ. Blackness has always been a part of his work—the title of the first Road Hog LP, 2014’s D.W.B., is short for “driving while Black,” a phrase used to describe the racial profiling of Black motorists—and while the critical discourse around his music has largely avoided the topic of race, Lustwerk seems determined to push the conversation forward. On Proof, that conversation is loudest on “Speed,” a track off Information that’s been remixed for the EP by red-hot NYC outfit AceMoMA (aka AceMo and MoMA Ready). The song’s slippery hardware rhythms and infectious energy will undoubtedly ring familiar to anyone who’s been following the pair’s HAUS of ALTR label, which has specifically sought to showcase talented Black producers on both sides of the Atlantic. Enlisting AceMoMA is a way of co-signing their efforts—and strengthening solidarity among Black and brown artists who are no longer content to wait for recognition from entrenched (and usually white) industry institutions. As exhausted as Lustwerk sounds on Proof, he’s clearly got the energy to demand better of dance music, both for himself and all who follow in his wake.

As God Intended,Apollo BrownChé Noir,by: Phillip Mlynar,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f05e417dc55f46b46324490/1:1/w_160/As%20God%20Intended_Apollo%20Brown%20&%20Che'%20Noir.jpg,2020-07-10 05:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/apollo-brown-che-noir-as-god-intended/,Mello Music Group,"Halfway through As God Intended, on the ominous static-flecked storytelling track “12 Hours,” the Buffalo-area MC Che’ Noir mistakenly winds up murdering a man she suspects of cheating on her with a friend. In reality, the unlucky soul was simply consulting with said friend about buying Che’ a ring, which the Hennessy-fortified Che’ subsequently finds in his pocket after shooting him with a gun she’d taken from his safe. “Fuck, I gotta get the fuck out of here,” she whispers at the end of the track, before hightailing away from the bloody scene. The grisly vignette is an apt summation of the world Che’ depicts in her music, where violence and relationships intermingle with themes of betrayal and loss. On the surface, there’s often a wild violent streak to Che’s rhymes on As God Intended, which she delivers in a smooth and unhurried monotone over beats by Detroit-based producer Apollo Brown that trade in alluring mid-tempo melancholy. As an MC, Che’ delights in killing her foes without remorse. On the album's opening song “Anti-Social,” which is carried by soothing piano and a classic breakbeat, she comes packing “bullets big as tennis balls” and calmly warns, “I put rappers in cemeteries/Then go to your wake and autograph your obituaries.” Later, on “Worth Gold,” she politely informs us, “I keep a blade that I use just to cut the tongue of a snitch.” But just like last year’s The Thrill Of The Hunt 2 project, which was entirely produced by Rochester’s 38 Spesh, As God Intended has a depth that reveals Che’ as a savvy and earnest lyricist, adept at linking dramatic scenes to the wider socio-political shackles that might prompt them. She's also unafraid to add vulnerable autobiographical flashbacks to her writing, as she delves into her family and upbringing. “Daddy's Girl” emerges as a key to understanding Che’ as she gazes back on the psychological effects of a childhood without a dependable father figure. “Look, black complexion, bad and reckless in my adolescence/’Cause I was young the first time I seen my dad arrested,” Che’ recalls before reflecting, “Too young to comprehend it at that time but now I’m old enough/To understand the damage from his absent presence growing up.” On “Money Orientated,” she pries further into the effects the criminal justice system can have on the dynamics of a household, musing over a pensive piano loop, “I got family that’s behind walls and they caged down/Went in a Christian, now it’s Allah when he pray now/That’s when I realized jail or death is where this money don’t matter/Can't buy my way into heaven when He judging me after.” A lot of rappers are skilled at describing the immediate world around them, whether that’s growing up on hardscrabble streets or flaunting the excess of the glamorous life. But on As God Intended, Che’ aims higher, subtly spotlighting how the various factors of her environment and experience—single parenthood, blighted neighborhood blocks, the prison system, religion and family values—all connect and influence each other, for better or worse. It’s an emphasis that turns the album into a persuasive reminder of the rewards that come with striving to paint the bigger picture.

As We Suffer From Memory and Imagination,Nuvolascura,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f05fa7edc55f46b46324494/1:1/w_160/as%20we%20suffer%20from%20memory%20and%20imagination_nuvolascura.jpg,2020-07-10 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/nuvolascura-as-we-suffer-from-memory-and-imagination/,Zegema BeachDog Knights,"Nuvolascura’s As We Suffer From Memory and Imagination, which the Los Angeles band recorded in December 2019, sounds like an emotional purge—an attempt to shake off the end of a bad year, a bad decade, maybe even a bad life, one that frontperson Erica vividly describes as a “lab test gone wrong.” (Nuvolascura don’t use last names; they’re severe like that). But the group’s second album now joins a growing list of groundbreaking releases that have turned screamo into 2020’s most vital and prescient form of punk rock, one especially suited for a time when being stuck in our homes might have us all feeling like screamo singers—alternately paralyzed and powered by nervous energy, looking for any outlet for release. Even among the leading figures of modern screamo, Nuvolascura remain a uniquely inscrutable act, refusing to provide the typical peace offerings of post-rock expanse, metalcore musculature, or clean vocal melody. The 21 minutes of As We Suffer From Memory and Imagination are split into 13 tracks, but they might easily have been broken down into twice as many. Songs that last barely 100 seconds still function as collage, flipping the smallest possible fragments of math-y dissonance, ascetic post-hardcore, technical metal, and caustic Midwestern emo before moving onto the next riff. Almost none of it follows a typical song structure. Instead, their songs play out like cinematic knife fights—fluid, intuitive, and carefully scripted in ways that defy comprehension. The carnivalesque tapping riffs of “Pixel Vision Anxiety” might be their very own Kill Bill: a celebration of hyperbolic, stylized brutality. Though also produced by Jack Shirley, Nuvolascura’s self-titled debut bore the dank, claustrophobic ambience of the DIY spaces where they had honed their sound. The heightened fidelity of As We Suffer has emboldened Nuvolascura as an instrumental unit, one more willing to take risks with technical dazzle and dynamics. The clean guitar figures that introduce the album are Nuvolascura’s one nod toward a traditional post-hardcore arc, preparation for an inevitable full-band crash. But when that does come, Nuvolascura play so punishingly loud that it initially sounds wrong—at least until “As the Mask Slips” maintains the same crushing intensity for its duration. Erica begins “Disguised in Scintillations” cursing her depression, sounding like she’s ducking behind the drum riser before rushing towards the mic seconds later: “Break locks, walk down train tracks,” she rages. “Burn, pine, perish for a moment of euphoria.” The song doesn’t outwardly advocate for burning a LAPD cruiser, but it also doesn’t not. The relatively quiet moments feel like a band in a state of shock, surveying an eerie absence of violence—erratic Morse code bleeping, hollowed-out arpeggios wafting like smoke after the American Football house gets burnt to cinders, the clean-tone guitars of “We’ll Never Know the True Extent of Our Loss” closing As We Suffer with two minutes of bloodletting. At the center, Erica is constantly on the verge of becoming a casualty in the asymmetrical war of modern life. “Keep your distance/Long for connection/Patterns emerge/If I smile you’ll fuck me/Wear all black/Avoid eye contact,” she shrieks on “Apyrexy.” When hell isn’t other people, it’s a prison of isolation or self-medication: “Remember when I didn’t need 50 pills to function? Remember when my body turned against me?” This is all impossible to discern from the singing itself, and the band’s political beliefs are best discerned from the lengthy syllabus of charitable causes in the album credits. Yet As We Suffer From Memory and Imagination is inherently and timelessly political in the way all screamo is, where anarchic destruction has to come before the message can be absorbed. “Let the chips fall where they may/I’ll never have faith that anything will be OK,” Erica screams midway through, a timely pledge of solidarity to everyone done with trying to settle for “OK.”","The Los Angeles group’s second album is a soul-scouring emotional purge that sets a new bar for screamo—and confirms the genre as one uniquely suited to a year as harrowing as this one.

The Black Hole Understands,Cloud Nothings,by: Arielle Gordon,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5efde590464fe661509ab0c7/1:1/w_160/Cloud-Nothings.jpeg,2020-07-09 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/cloud-nothings-the-black-hole-understands/,self-released,"It might not be obvious from the dense, towering compositions of his recent discography, but Dylan Baldi is something of an ascetic. The Cloud Nothings frontman’s updates during lockdown suggested he was shopping around an ambient emo record and embracing the hypnotic drone of modular synths. The only music he and Cloud Nothings drummer Jayson Gerycz released together in the past three months was a minimal “free-form jazz” improvisation that featured only a saxophone and drums. But an avant-garde side project is one thing; aiming to reproduce Cloud Nothings’ searing riffs and gnarled screams in solitude is more daunting. That might explain the relatively low-key rollout of their new record, The Black Hole Understands, recorded remotely in quarantine and primarily featuring Baldi and Gercyz. Rather than attempt to replicate the harsher sound they’ve developed since 2012’s Attack on Memory, they spit-shine limited resources until they gleam like a long-lost Creation Records release. Despite being recorded in an era of unthinkable instability, it is the most assuredly melodic Cloud Nothings has sounded in years. Perhaps owing to the limits of his home studio setup, which by his telling consists only of GarageBand, Baldi eschews the abrasive shouts and syncopated, MacKaye-indebted barking that were his go-to on 2018’s Last Building Burning. Instead, he delicately traverses vocal triplets, overdubs bright counter-harmonies, and leaps into ELO-worthy falsettos with ease. The softer approach befits the band’s humbler sound. On “An Average World,” Baldi ends a pre-chorus bridge by resolving the harmonies introduced earlier in the verse, his voice ticking up to match his guitar. In another universe, it’s easy to imagine Cloud Nothings building momentum with layered, angular chords, Baldi capping off each line with an increasingly unhinged shout. But here they choose harmony instead of dissonance, creating tension not by pushing the limits of studio mics and faders, but through the sense of anxiety that, because everything is recorded so closely and with such light processing, any slight vocal crack could throw the song off course. The Black Hole Understands is in many ways a revisitation of the band’s earliest days, when Cloud Nothings was Baldi recording alone in his parents’ Ohio basement. These songs share a similar pop sensibility and self-contained structure as his early recordings, bolstered by a decade’s worth of experience and Gerycz’s note-perfect percussion. There’s the simmering, quiet-loud dynamic of “The Sound of Everyone,” which arrives at a restrained crescendo as Baldi reassuringly sings “life won’t always be this way” over crisp drum fills and low bass. “A Silent Reaction” borrows the fuzzed-out sincerity of Teenage Fanclub, clean chords building to a wistful refrain delivered in Baldi’s surprisingly strong higher register. The album betrays a deep nostalgia for power pop, whether on the twinkling reverb of “Memory of Regret” or the cooing backing vocals that accent “The Mess Is Permanent.” Despite similarly modest origins, The Black Hole Understands is more patient than the blown-out revelry of Cloud Nothings’ early bedroom recordings. Rather than lean into the gimmick of a “bedroom” record, they disguise their relatively amateur equipment behind clean melodies and reliable song structures. Thanks in large part to Gerycz’s obsessive home mixing, otherwise novel elements of the recording process—Baldi relied solely on the built-in guitar amps on GarageBand, for example—are hardly recognizable. The limits of composing songs via email manifest most clearly on the wordless “Tall Gray Structure,” where dense and stormy riffs give way to a prolonged, mostly straightforward jam session. It’s serviceable if formulaic, fading into the background like a television score. But for the most part, Black Hole stands defiantly against the decade Cloud Nothings spent working with an impressive roster of producers, honing their sound in such hallowed spaces as Steve Albini’s Electrical Audio. Absent pushback from a watchful producer, the band’s intuitive knack for melody shines through. What could otherwise be a throwaway experiment is bolstered further by the strength of Baldi’s songwriting. While certain lines land with a wink—“This ain’t the ending I had wanted,” he sings on “Story That I Live”—his cheerily-delivered defeatism is comforting in its timelessness. “What is the purpose of anything more?” he asks with a slight shrug on “An Average World,” a question that feels directed towards quarter-life crises in general, more than the one unfolding at this particular moment. Hearing Baldi sing about comfortingly quotidian issues—emotional disconnection or frustration with life—is a source of welcome familiarity. “Ordinary people/Living out their lives,” he sings brightly on “Right on the Edge.” Backed by gleaming harmonies, Cloud Nothings make the dulled ennui of everyday life sound like an escapist fantasy.","Rather than lean into the gimmick of a “bedroom” record, Cloud Nothings’ quarantine album disguises relatively amateur equipment behind clean melodies and power-pop nostalgia.

So Icy Summer,Gucci Mane,by: Sheldon Pearce,Contributing Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5efbe4c2dc55f46b46323f49/1:1/w_160/So%20Icey%20Summer_Gucci%20Mane.jpg,2020-07-09 05:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/gucci-mane-so-icy-summer/,Atlantic,"Since his 2016 release from prison, Gucci Mane has been more of a self-help guru than a trap star. The ventures that he prioritized this year are a new book called The Gucci Mane Guide to Greatness and the label compilation Gucci Mane Presents: So Icy Summer, featuring a brand-new roster of artists on his revamped imprint The New 1017. The two projects seem to share a principle: providing insight to those who might benefit from it. “I’m in a better place than I ever been in my life, even though the world deteriorating around me,” he told XXL. “I want to share [with new artists]. I feel like I got a lot of knowledge. That’s what you can be charitable with.” It’s an admirable cause, and one reflective of the new and improved Gucci, who has become a model of rehabilitation. But on the compilation, his charity comes at his own expense, as an otherwise-inspired Gucci album is bogged down by his attempts to uplift lesser rappers. Most of the music Gucci Mane has released in his second act feels like a supplement to his narrative, and not the focus. It has been easy to ignore and easier still to forget, especially for a prolific rapper with a massive back catalog of impressive mixtapes. The music centering him here is the first to feel essential to his rap legacy since he came back from jail. He writes and raps like a veteran recounting war stories, reliving the glories of victory and the traumas imposed by violence. Buried somewhere in this overstuffed, 24-song, 80-minute crew compilation is his best album in years. When Gucci was first released, there was a ridiculous (albeit hilarious) conspiracy theory that the newly healthy and fit Guwop was actually a clone. The unsavory implication was that a problematic rapper can’t change unless genetically modified. The truthers needn’t look any further for proof of his realness than this album, which finds him refining longtime tendencies and dwelling on pre-prison life and its ramifications for his post-prison self. Flanked by the cousins Young Nudy and 21 Savage on “Nasty,” he reminisces about his days in the drug game, half-nostalgic, half-relieved that it’s over. His stacking rhyme schemes are densely packed (One bit from his verse on “Gucci Land”: “Send a bail in the mail/Fuck the judge and the jury and the jail and the muthafuckin’ cell/Know Chanel, and it’s Gucci, you can tell/You can smell, I’m a player, pull up in a V12”), and he sounds like an elder statesman settling comfortably into a new role. But any momentum built is soon derailed by the other voices he’s amplifying. The compilation is divided into halves: the Gucci-led opening section, which functions like a filler-free comeback album, and the twelve songs affixed to it, which gives his new artists free reign. The second half feels a bit like watching a G League exhibition after an NBA playoff game. The rappers Gucci is grooming for The New 1017—particularly, Foogiano, Pooh Shiesty, and Big Scarr—never escape his looming shadow and never really get the chance. To Gucci’s credit, he has been one of rap’s most underrated A&Rs, and there’s reason to believe he’s onto something with this crew, too. Foogiano sounds right at home with Gucci and Future on the Zaytoven-produced opener “Step Out,” his babbling Auto-Tuned flows cascading down the synth arrangement. Pooh isn’t doing anything Yo Gotti couldn’t do better, but on songs like “Monday to Sunday” he displays an adequate eye for detail (“Got twenty shots left up in the K, thought I shot the whole hundred/Pay tithes at church from hustlin’, even the pastor know we thuggin’”). The two women on the roster, K Shiday and Enchanting, team up for one song; Gucci has been adamant that they aren’t a group, but as the So Icy Girlz on “Left On Read,” they channel fierce City Girls energy. The comp could’ve used far more of them. Instead of feeling like a big break for The New 1017, So Icy Summer just feels like a missed opportunity for Gucci. On “Iran,” he uses his unwillingness to get drafted as aframe for the injustices suffered under a racist American government. “Lifers” channels the dark world of Three 6 Mafia, and he sounds confident there: “Them suckers them, what’s up with them?/I buck on them, scuff up them Timbs/Petty hustles, predators, pressure them then they crumble them,” he raps. But all of this he-man virility builds to the somber “Still Remember,” an introspective finale about an inability to shake all of the things he’s seen, how the memories of his past life still haunt him. It’s the fitting climax to a resurgent moment. Everything that comes after feels incidental. Catch up every Saturday with 10 of our best-reviewed albums of the week.

Symphonie Pacifique,Greg Foat,by: Piotr Orlov,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f029af7464fe661509ab35e/1:1/w_160/Symphonie%20Pacifique_Greg%20Foat.jpg,2020-07-09 05:00:00,Jazz,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/greg-foat-symphonie-pacifique/,Strut,"British pianist-keyboardist-composer Greg Foat has long been pigeonholed as a jazz musician, yet he fits the tradition sideways, at best. Though he studied with UK jazz luminaries like pianist Gordon Beck, and his Greg Foat Group came to renown by tapping into Britain’s late-’60s jazz-rock heyday of bands like Soft Machine and Nucleus, his work’s preoccupation with texture, melody, and narrative had long placed him outside that music’s jam-oriented solo expressions. Since 2017, when Foat committed himself to a way of working more centered on place, partnership and circumstance than predetermined style, the peculiarities in his music have become more pronounced, and his creative output has mushroomed. It’s hard not to hear Symphony Pacifique, Foat’s ninth album in the past four years, as a summation of this period. Symphonie Pacifique also speaks to another reconsideration of the genre-nonspecific, mixed-use sound space where, for over 60 years, improvisation, composition, and sonic investigation have blended to no uncertain purpose. The album echoes this artful testing ground for recordings—a tradition-free mix of film scores, radiophonic library sounds, percussion records, hi-fi experimentalism, space-age pop, and far beyond. Heady, outwardly beautiful, aesthetically lush, and self-aware enough to avoid devolving into pap, it fits in with music often championed for its wealth of taste and knowledge—and just as often dismissed for its middlebrow pretension. Yet such experiments can also be a well for mental and creative resets—which is how they have seemingly served Foat. While the Greg Foat Group (2009-2016) was based in electric jazz-meets-rock playing, it was primarily a vehicle for Foat’s dreamy pieces, often reflecting fantasy narratives (2011’s Dark Is the Sun is based on a Philip José Farmer sci-fi novel, 2015’s The Dancers at the Edge of Time on one of Michael Moorcock’s) and filled with an array of synthesizers and studio-centric arrangements. More than a glimmer of Britain’s prog-rock heritage and accompanying largess was on display, though Foat’s tunes also regularly served a soft and pastoral solitude, reflecting the rural and naturalist influences of the Isle of Wight, where he’s lived since boyhood. In 2017, Foat and Warren Hampshire, another Isle resident and multi-instrumentalist with indie-psych-funk group A Band of Bees, released Galaxies Like Grains of Sand, a new-age-folk meditation about tides. Like a dam bursting, Galaxies heralded not only a new way of working and a flood of recordings, but a diversity in Foat’s music he’d mostly kept in check. Ensuing collaborations—with Hampshire, with studio engineer and Isle resident James Thorpe, with Edinburgh deep house producer Linkwood—were interspersed with “solo” albums featuring Isle locals, old Group members (bassist Phil Achille, conguero Eric Young), low-key Brit jazz legends (saxophonist Art Themen, drummer Clark Tracey), and a set of prodigious boldface players (saxophonist Binker Golding, Kooks guitarist Hugh Harris, drummer Moses Boyd). The records were united not by a specific sound but by an immediacy, a project-to-project fluency, and the sense that, as each moved from groove to texture to rumination, the musicians were there to serve the ensemble. Symphonie Pacifique spotlights those elements magnificently. It’s not incorrect to generalize the album as a soul-jazz session full of symphonic and studio-built asides—a smaller-scale take on, say, David Axelrod’s kaleidoscopic fantasias that spotlights the personalities of Foat’s compositions and his broad cast of players. Occasionally Symphonie does get reductive, the too-bright tone of Foat’s Steinway driving its more linear pieces from the front, and the album can sound smooth and lightweight, a facile version of the music Foat has mostly abandoned. Yet these moments rarely last long. The handful of string interludes hint at grander ambitions, and the plethora of balearic fusions repeatedly return Pacifique towards a more complex light. Fusions like “Anticipation,” built on dubbed keyboard chords straight out of Underworld’s rave smash “Born Slippy,” a sweeping mix of strings, synths and wordless choir, Boyd’s rolling drums, and dueling saxophones, which sounds like an update on a Mizell Brothers/Donald Byrd collaboration. Or “Man Vs. Machine,” featuring Young’s percussion elbowing into Foat and Boyd’s analog synth-drums duet, and robo-funking like Kraftwerkian commentary. Co-written with Hampshire and spotlighting a trio of Foat’s piano, Heather Wrighton’s harp, and Achille’s bass, “After the Storm” has the environmental new age majesty of a Steve Roach piece—and is narratively book-ended by Thomas Frank’s almost-solo “Meditation on a Pedal Steel,” which soundtracks its last drops. An epilogue titled “Three Tenors,” featuring the unaccompanied yet effects-laden (and psychedelically mixed) conversation between Themen, David Bitelli, and Rob Mach’s saxophones, is Pacifique’s capstone, simultaneously referencing multiple directions in sound—beatless free jazz, dub, ambient—while choosing none. Importantly, Greg Foat is nowhere to be heard on “Three Tenors,” yet philosophically he is still in command from the production room, letting the players he put in place magnify its roar. Such low-key involvement marks the best parts of Symphonie Pacifique, and the bright recent chapter of his long career: unencumbered by rules and definitions, in love with the freedoms of sound, guiding from the back.

Fucking Hell,No Home,by: NM Mashurov,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f04eb0fa9d0807aa5684a79/1:1/w_160/Fucking%20Hell_No%20Home.jpg,2020-07-09 05:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/no-home-fucking-hell/,Hungry and Undervalued,"No Home has been aware of precarity for a long time. The solo project of London-based musician Charlie Valentine, No Home gained well-deserved attention in recent years opening for Big Joanie, Priests, and Moor Mother, playing the city’s Decolonise Fest, and releasing a series of EPs that seethe with critiques of capitalism and exploitation. If industrial music was meant to echo the alienation of mechanical factory labor, No Home’s unhurried progressions, minimalist percussion, and bursts of distortion mimic the disorientation of being locked out of labor-time to begin with. Fucking Hell is punk the way reclaiming your time is punk. On their full-length debut, Valentine’s powerful voice and experimental song structures dilate and expand time, pushing against the boundaries of genre and resisting enclosure. Surviving under capitalism is a drag—it’s the oldest story in rock’n’roll—but No Home captures the weight of its dehumanization in a uniquely visceral way. Valentine’s voice is the clear centerpiece of the album. It stretches expansively, shapeshifting from a mesmerizing full-bodied blues vocal on “Burning the Body” to Liz Phair deconstructed alt-rock on “I Couldn’t Cry Before I Wrote EPs” (where “I think I’m paranoid” seems to cite Shirley Manson); from Thom Yorke in outer space on “Secondary Actor” to a waxing swell on the meditative “Exile.” Valentine does with their voice what many noise musicians hope to do with their soundscapes: It is both the shifting emotional core and the steady unspooling that holds the song together. Its breadth creates a space of undoing. The record’s narrative rests on classic transitional moments—graduating, looking for a job, trying to find steady footing. But these songs are not stumbling pauses along a well-lit upward path, as in some sort of Boomer imaginary; they’re elegies for the swamp of exploitation and humiliation, where the cost of entry is your self-worth and any rewards are fleeting and illusory. Valentine’s depiction of this headspace is brutally funny and also devastating, as in a memorable line from “The Perfect Candidate”: “Sorry we’ve considered other applicants/Good luck/Have a nice job search/Have you ever considered/Fucking off forever?” In “4x4,” which zeroes in on the music industry’s particular indignities (playing for free, emailing gatekeepers), Valentine returns to a line that escalates to a near-howl: “Say you wanna do this for life/Are you being realistic, baby?” It’s simultaneously one of the record’s most chilling moments and one of its best hooks. A quiet moment in “Candidate” hits just as hard: “I wish I could be worth more than this.” Valentine turns that same incisiveness inward, digging into themselves and their creative process. “I Couldn’t Cry Before I Wrote EPs” is ostensibly about music-making as an alternative to therapy because therapy itself is too expensive, but also about the double-bind of performing your pain for an audience. The song’s dissonance stretches in opposite directions, opening with ominous keyboard noise but veering into pop melodies, as if trying to stay one step ahead of itself. “You masturbate to my misery,” Valentine sings, “I learn how to cry in public.” Their narrator twists in the gaze, fighting to trust themself while remaining keenly aware of the pressure to be consumable. “Only white people dream of utopias,” Valentine sings, resisting any neat resolution. Economic and personal insecurities (and all the ways they intertwine) exert their ruthless gravity even as the record fights to pull out of their grasp. Although the songs on Fucking Hell take different forms, all are stripped down to such sharp immediacy it feels like you’re hearing them at a house show. The sparse instrumentation creates a folk intimacy, foregrounding Valentine’s vocals and furthering the sense of temporal dislocation. The plaintive “A B- in This Economy” and “The Perfect Candidate” have the conversational tone of Sneaks or Frankie Cosmos, while the foreboding bursts of noise and eerie vocal samples in “Couldn’t Cry” and “Catholic School Never Taught Me How to Talk to Men” are as haunted and avenging as Moor Mother or early EMA tracks. But though No Home traverses indie rock cosmology, the project is singularly itself. Eschewing traditional pop structures, songs meander and change direction: There is no neat narrative to pain, no efficient linearity outside of the ruthless logic of capitalist production. That’s not to say there aren’t moments of release. Despite themes of debt and social anxiety, “Drink! You’re One of Us” is a fun, uptempo rocker with clear melodic hooks. Album closer “YY” is surprisingly pop, with the melancholy warmth of a Tracy Chapman song and a more traditional chorus that includes both a line about “doing good by your neighbor” and the skeptical refrain, “Don’t quite like the fruits of your labor.” There is no escape, but there are moments of reprieve: mutual aid, community support, collective and individual resistance. “YY” breaks the fever of despondency, allowing some cathartic sweetness to sneak in. “I made a good thing out of a bad situation,” Valentine sings, “Maybe I’m okay with my fall from grace.” Catch up every Saturday with 10 of our best-reviewed albums of the week.

Massey Fucking Hall,Japandroids,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f028d7b8813ffa92664f12e/1:1/w_160/Massey%20Fucking%20Hall_Japandroids.jpg,2020-07-08 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/japandroids-massey-fucking-hall/,Anti-,"Right before launching into his set closer on Massey Fucking Hall, Japandroids frontman Brian King takes a moment to thank “you guys up front... [for] making us feel a little bit more like it’s a normal Japandroids show.” Up until this, he and David Prowse had been playing the most not-normal Japandroids show in history. The duo were facing a larger crowd than any they’d seen from the second leg of 2017’s Near to the Wild Heart of Life tour, in their nation’s most venerated concert hall, less than a week after the death of Tragically Hip’s Gord Downie, the People’s Champ of Canadian rock. What followed King’s nervous aside is the most normal thing to happen at a Japandroids show: they end with “The House That Heaven Built,” a song that King has admitted he cannot sing for the life of him. Even Japandroids’ most evangelical fans know that King and David Prowse can’t really pull of most of their vocals live; those “whoa”s and “yeah”s don’t quite hit the same when it’s really two guys doing it, as opposed to two guys overdubbed to sound like 250. Japandroids were capable of live transcendence, but only if they weren’t completely trashed by the time they got on stage or at a point during their marathon tours where King has inevitably blown out his voice. Their reputation as hard-drinkin’, hard-rockin’, hard-lovin’ punk vagabonds ran up against their reality as a couple of studio perfectionists, and Massey Fucking Hall lays this dissonance bare. The live album reveals a Japandroids that became reliable, downright professional. Or at least practical—here, “Younger Us” truly sounds like it’s being sung by someone older and wiser; “Fire’s Highway” steps off the gas to avoid the daredevil melodic bridge jump of its chorus, staying safely in the carpool lane. The chorus of a Japandroids song is written to be yelled like hell to the heavens while surrounded by hundreds of people who will drown you out. But those people didn’t have to do it all over again two nights later, like King did, and you could hear those calculations creep inevitably into their playing. The Post-Nothing cuts fare best; they had fewer moving parts and thus didn’t suffer from being played sloppily or off-key. King riffs on the Stooges’ “1970” at the top of “Heart Sweats,” recasting one of their least-essential album cuts into the lineage of brilliantly braindead rock, while “Sovereignty” still thrums on the desperate days when they couldn’t draw a dozen people outside of Vancouver. The songs on Near to the Wild Heart of Life began to integrate the sort of things that make songs work in 3000-capacity venues—slower tempos, synthesizers, backing vocals and lyrics about the road that were based in reality—but if they added new personnel on stage or had a stage setup that distracted from King’s three amp stacks, they wouldn’t be Japandroids anymore. The steamrolling momentum of setlist highlight “Arc of Bar” redeems the surrealist hokum of King’s most divisive song, but even if you could watch it set to Japandroids’ modest light show, it still can’t quite compete with the Be Here Now-level excess conjured by the studio version. Despite its flaws, Massey Fucking Hall serves a monument for a band whose vision of non-toxic masculinity remains utopian and inspiring. It’s a world full of wild urges, but also one in which  romantic fulfillment serves as the highest form of self-actualization (see: “Continuous Thunder,” “No Known Drink or Drug”). Massey Fucking Hall documents thousands of people bearing witness to two unpretentious guys playing unfashionable rock songs about ordinary people willing to push themselves to extraordinary places in their relationships. If Massey Fucking Hall underwhelms, it ironically functions as the greatest possible endorsement to see Japandroids in person, if that opportunity ever exists again.

Source,Gábor Lázár,by: Esme Bennett,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f0297a07bb7acb328d57b75/1:1/w_160/Source_Ga%CC%81bor%20La%CC%81za%CC%81r.jpg,2020-07-08 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/gabor-lazar-source/,Planet Mu,"In a 2015 interview, Hungarian sound artist Gábor Lázár said that in his creative process, he is “trying to give different answers to my own questions”; composition, in other words, is inseparable from research. Experiencing Lázár’s music can offer a jolt to your own inquisitive state. His tracks are crafted in such vivid detail, it is as though they were organisms viewed through a powerful microscope. At its extreme, this technique can induce a gratifying kind of existential dread. But Lázár’s first album for Planet Mu, Source, isn’t necessarily designed for dissecting. His 2014 record ILS, on Lorenzo Senni’s Presto!?, was rooted in Lazar’s background in sound design, while his 2018 release on Powell’s label the Death Of Rave, Unfold, invoked club aesthetics and rarefied rave production similar to the style Rian Treanor would pursue on his 2019 album ATAXIA. Source picks up the deconstructive thread running through much recent left-field electronic music—Senni’s trance pointillism, Beatrice Dillon’s interrogation of dub techno—in a playful, danceable manner. Caustic synths, hyperventilating cadences, and skittering pads make for a heady interpretation of soundsystem rhythms, neatly placing Lázár between hedonism and academic inquiry—a feat that’s often difficult to execute with this much charm. “Phase” is particularly frenzied, with mutated 2-step rhythms and oscillated bass notes stretched to their limits, while “Excite” executes flighty synth lines alongside leaden clang. To craft these complex algorithms, Lázár uses the software Max/MSP, also a favorite of collaborator Mark Fell, who worked alongside Lázár on 2015’s simultaneously jarring and meditative The Neurobiology of Moral Decision Making. Source indicates a newfound maturity in Lázár’s sound and spotlights a more palatable application of rhythm and melody, which his past records, for all their virtuoso sound design, sometimes lacked. Source feels bolder, sharper, and more emotive than the last record; that’s especially true of tracks like “Effort,” where the swiveling bass contorts and jumps almost like dubstep. But where Source falls short is in its uniformity; there are moments where it is difficult to distinguish one track from the other, particularly in the case of “Phase” and “Route,” but the disjointed rhythms and mind-bending curves still make for a hypnotic affair. The energy lets up with the introspective ambient closer “Return”: Gentle keys work a daybreak melody that wouldn’t feel out of place on Squarepusher’s tenderer early-’00s output, as if providing a cathartic breathing space from the earlier delirium. Source is unrelentingly stimulating, lighting up the full spectrum of sound like the blinking signals on a circuit board. Lázár picks apart dance music’s tropes and investigates how far such forms can be pulled while remaining recognizable. The intellectual detail from past records remains, but the brutalist rhythms make for a stellar execution in futuristic dance. Catch up every Saturday with 10 of our best-reviewed albums of the week.

Moonlit Navigation,Inexorum,by: Kim Kelly,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f0290c9a9d0807aa568477f/1:1/w_160/Moonlit%20Navigation_Inexorum.jpg,2020-07-08 05:00:00,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/inexorum-moonlit-navigation/,Gilead Media,"Time is a fickle mistress, and so are metal fans’ sympathies. Bands who end up stuck in era-specific transitional subgenres like melodic death metal, for example (or metalcore, or crossover thrash, or blackgaze) still have their fans and their place in history, but are often left behind as the genre forges ahead without them. But, even though melodic death metal, its close associate, melodic black metal, and their hellish spawn, melodic blackened death metal, may not be all that cool anymore, it doesn’t mean that fans have stopped loving them. While their popularity and visibility have plummeted since the late ’90s and early ’00s, these subgenres are still going, with their own classics and new devotees. The Minneapolis duo Inexorum are a case in point: Their second LP, Moonlit Navigation, sounds like a guided tour through the best of the ‘90s Necropolis Records catalog. Helmed by Carl Skildum with the new addition of Matthew Kirkwold, the project’s unabashed worship of melodic Scandinavian extreme metal is a joy to hear, and they deliver it with reverence. Describing Inexorum’s chosen micro-genre demands hair-splitting; to be brief, the sound marries the most melodic forms of black metal and death metal, adding occasional dashes of Viking-metal grandeur. Skildum has referenced his love for this particular era before, and Moonlit Navigation is dotted with sonic references to early Dawn, Sacramentum, and, fittingly, Amorphis, whose Tales From The Thousand Lakes may as well have been written about his own rural Minnesota upbringing. And in a testament to the living nature of the genre, those who came upon this scene a bit later may instead recognize shades of more recent acts like Amon Amarth, Thulcandra, or Insomnium. But Skildum and Kirkwold blend signifiers so seamlessly that their sound becomes its own living, breathing thing. Both band members also play in death thrashers Antiverse and serve as part of medieval metal visionaries Obsequiae’s live lineup, so their genre agnosticism comes as no surprise. Picking apart songs like the grandiose title track or more downbeat “Chains of Loss” in order to deem this bit more death metal, or this bit more purely black, feels misguided; to properly appreciate an album like Moonlit Navigation, the listener must commit to occupying that messy space in between. The clear delineations that now separate death metal and black metal did not exist in their chosen sound’s heyday, and it’s a credit to Skildum that he allows everything to bleed together. The cold, windswept atmosphere that hangs over the record is as important as the riffs or Skildrum’s weathered growl; there is a sense of place, grounded in the northern woods and jeweled lakes that surround the duo. The bombastic “Dream and Memory” allows the folk-influenced melodies and soaring grandiosity of Viking metal—its own complex beast—to imprint itself on Inexorum’s sound. On the triumphal, synth-powered “The Breaking Point,” which features guest vocalist Sarah Roddy, Inexorum wreathes its stirring melodies in uptempo thrash beats and blasts of frigidity. The acoustic interlude “Wild Magic” offers a momentary respite before “In Desperate Times” closes the coffin lid with a flourish of blastbeats and razor-sharp black metal riffing. One of the beauties of Moonlit Navigation—for it is an overwhelmingly beautiful album—is Skildum’s ability to craft something new from older, near-forgotten pieces. When there are so many boundary pushing new bands drawing extreme metal forward—from black metal anarchists Dawn Ray’d and extreme metal shapeshifters Immortal Bird to Inexorum’s genre-smashing labelmates Thou and noise-rock vanguardists Couch Slut—it can be hard to understand why anyone would feel compelled to look backwards. But with their latest, Inexorum has provided a compelling argument for honoring the best of extreme metal’s past, even as we continue to carve out its faster, louder, weirder future.

Black Nationalist Sonic Weaponry,Speaker Music,by: Philip Sherburne,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f04c0627bb7acb328d57d35/1:1/w_160/special%20music-black%20nationalist%20sonic%20weaponry.jpg,2020-07-08 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/speaker-music-black-nationalist-sonic-weaponry/,Planet Mu,"When DeForrest Brown Jr. says, “Make techno Black again,” it is meant both as a reminder of a historical fact—dance music is Black music—and a rejection of a widespread misconception. To many around the world, techno is the stuff of legend and fodder for memes: a lifestyle accessory reducible to a four-on-the-floor beat, a gram of MDMA, and a bottle of Club Mate. Brown Jr., who also records as Speaker Music, has made it his mission to expose this whitewashed caricature of techno as a lie. In panels, lectures, and his forthcoming book Assembling a Black Counter Culture, Brown Jr., illustrates the ways that techno, invented in Detroit in the mid-1980s, represents the lived experience of Black people under specific historical circumstances. A kind of sonic archaeologist, Brown Jr. strips away techno’s layers to unearth the artifacts of urban planning, labor relations, race riots, the Great Migration, and Jim Crow before that. Digging far enough down, he finds the centuries-old songs of enslaved people who picked cotton on Southern plantations—a “communal rhythm” that would be replicated on the Ford Motor Company assembly lines manned by their descendants, a rhythm that would fuel Detroit’s two greatest cultural exports, Motown and techno. “It’s all this one sound of trauma and bodily agitation that comes out in various forms,” Brown Jr. told Pitchfork contributor Joshua Minsoo Kim in his newsletter Tone Glow. “When I think about Black music and being here from 1619 to the present, I see a long line of traumatic screams.” Brown Jr.’s musical output stays true to this expressive legacy while expanding what “techno” might mean sonically. Since December, he has put out two albums of long-form experimental electronic music and an EP, Percussive Therapy, of psychedelic beat music. Black Nationalist Sonic Weaponry is his most ambitious release yet: a 49-minute suite that brings together fractured, shuddering drum programming with spoken-word poetry, collage, and noise. It does not much outwardly resemble the sleek pulses and iridescent chords of the classic Detroit techno he often invokes; it’s angrier, more turbulent, as committed to formlessness as symmetry. In a PDF booklet that accompanies the digital release, he invokes the poet Amiri Baraka’s Fire Music movement, which linked grassroots community organizing with the radical jazz of musicians like Archie Shepp and Albert Ayler; more than any particular musical lexicon, what Black Nationalist Sonic Weaponry draws from those artists is the desire to push beyond established forms. The backbone of the album is a machine rhythm that runs almost without pause from start to finish: a thrashing groove that pairs booming kicks and toms with jagged hi-hats. Bass and treble trade off like the flash-bang symphony of a thunderstorm. The beat is repetitive but unpredictable; it feels deliberately agitated. Over this buckling frame he drapes a succession of sounds and ideas. In “Techno Is a Liberation Technology,” the New York producer AceMo’s processed trumpet bobs and weaves, contributing to the churning atmosphere. In “Black Secret Technology Is a Traumatically Manufactured and Exported Good Necessitated by 300 Years of Unaccounted for White Supremacist Savagery in the Founding of the United States,” the beat seesaws across the stereo field above icy drones. In “A Genre Study of Black Male Death and Dying,” free-jazz drums are spun through violent pitch-shifting algorithms while a police scanner chirps and sputters over the top. Although the album plays out as a single, unbroken piece, the most powerful track is the first, “Amerikkka’s Bay,” in which the 18-year-old writer Maia Sanaa recites a chilling poem about Black victims murdered by police: “No more dinner nights and movies with her daddy, kisses from her mommy, dreams of who she would be. He might remember the doll that laid next to her, how it too had 6 bullets lodged into it.” Her reading snaps Brown Jr.’s unstable beats into focus and provides essential context for what will follow. Sanaa’s piece also appears in the accompanying PDF booklet, alongside a collection of poetry and essays that ground Black Nationalist Sonic Weaponry in the current moment. An essay by Brown Jr. links the COVID-19 pandemic, with its disproportionate effects on communities of color, to broader systemic inequalities and the failure of “White American utopianism,” a failure previously laid bare in the ruins of post-industrial Detroit. Critic Ryan Clarke captures the unrest of 2020 even more succinctly: “Riots are the voice of the unheard and percussion is the frequency.” Black Nationalist Sonic Weaponry is not an easy listen. The disjointed repetition—a beat that stops and starts, starts and stops, over and over—is jarring. The rhythm jitters in place, yet it doesn’t vary across the album; it just drops out for short passages before kicking in again. (It is remarkably similar to the rhythms deployed on Percussive Therapy.) But surely that irregular repetition is part of the point. The beat’s insistently disorienting qualities short-circuit the music’s entertainment value; a track like “African American Disillusionment With Northern Democracy Continues to Smolder in Every Negro Who Has Settled Up North After Knowing Life in the South,” with its nightly news anchors discussing white agitators at Black-led protests, is unlikely to soundtrack a Friday-night dance party. The goal is to provoke, to disturb. With its long, unbroken stretch of repetitive-yet-not-repeating beats, over which jazz samples, news segments, and police scanners are painted like scenes, Black Nationalist Sonic Weaponry plays with linear time in unsettling ways. It often feels less like music than like some other medium—like, say, doomscrolling the timeline, or following a horizontal mural that unrolls new scenes of horror and resilience without end. In the liner notes to 1965’s The New Wave in Jazz, a compilation featuring Albert Ayler, Archie Shepp, and John Coltrane that was recorded a month after Malcom X’s assassination, Amiri Baraka wrote that the album was “heavy evidence that something is really happening.” Black Nationalist Sonic Weaponry is a similar form of evidence: Its scroll-like shape is a seismograph of these turbulent, hopeful times.","DeForrest Brown Jr.’s most ambitious release yet is a 49-minute suite that brings together fractured, shuddering drum programming with spoken-word poetry, collage, and noise.

Shoot for the Stars Aim for the Moon,Pop Smoke,by: Alphonse Pierre,Staff Writer ,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f02968d8813ffa92664f131/1:1/w_160/Shoot%20for%20the%20Stars%20Aim%20for%20the%20Moon_Pop%20Smoke.jpg,2020-07-07 05:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/pop-smoke-shoot-for-the-stars-aim-for-the-moon/,Victor Victor WorldwideRepublic,"Nearly every New York neighborhood has a character like Pop Smoke: flashy, cocky, trash-talking while hitting a dance, all jokes until suddenly he’s deadly serious. Born Bashar Jackson in Canarsie, Brooklyn, Pop Smoke was raised among blocks so rich with Caribbean culture that his breakout music video was partially filmed at Peppa’s, a local Jamaican jerk chicken hotspot. During the year or so his career lasted, he was the centerpiece of the borough’s drill movement, a subgenre born and popularized in Chicago, and adopted and personalized by New York. By the time he was shot and killed at 20, Pop Smoke wasn’t just a rapper, he was the voice of Brooklyn drill. In the winter of 2018, a teenage Pop Smoke arrived with one of his first-ever recordings, a thunderous remix of Sheff G’s “Panic Part 3.” By the summer, kids across the city were emulating his bellowing voice and signature dance, using any opportunity to shout the quotables off of his instant classic debut mixtape, Meet the Woo—“Bitch, I’m a thot, get me lit,” should replace “Fuhgeddaboudit” on the leaving Brooklyn sign. His breakthrough single, “Welcome to the Party,” was so hot that Nicki Minaj hopped on the remix to assure that Pop would bring Brooklyn drill to the masses. Soon enough, he was riding around the borough in a Bugatti with Travis Scott, in Paris with Virgil Abloh, and shutting down shows in the UK. When his second mixtape rolled around in February, he was a borderline superstar. He was dead less than two weeks later. It went so fast he never even got the chance to perform an official hometown show. Shoot for the Stars Aim for the Moon, Pop Smoke’s debut album, released posthumously, attempts to cement his legacy by expanding his world. Executive produced by his would-be mentor 50 Cent, it’s big, polished, versatile, feature-packed, and loaded with radio and playlist-friendly records. It’s the type of album that will boost streams, but it runs counter to what made Pop Smoke appealing in the first place. When “Welcome to the Party” and “Dior” first began to play on the radio, it was like the airwaves had been hacked. There was no way this Canarsie rapper with the hulking voice, chanting on nightmarish UK drill beats, was supposed to be playing in between Drake and DaBaby, right? Yet there he was. On Stars, Pop Smoke’s animated personality and charisma are drowned out. We didn’t need Pop Smoke’s wannabe Cali-strip-club anthem with Tyga and Mustard on “West Coast Shit.” Or a hollow Astroworld retread on “Aim for the Moon.” Or a forced Rap Caviar-bound marathon with Lil Baby and DaBaby on “For the Night.” Pop Smoke’s music came to life most when he made a couple of blocks in Canarsie seem like the only place that mattered—a subway ride to SoHo might as well have been a private jet to Bora Bora. Buried under the fluff somewhere is a good album. “44 BullDog” is a return to Pop gliding on sinister drill beats, and it’s his sharpest song since his debut. Some of Pop’s risks pay off, too. “Something Special,” a flip of Fabolous and Tamia’s “Into You,” is the type of macho love song that hasn’t been done this well since 50 Cent’s “21 Questions”: Pop’s idea of romance is sneaking into his girlfriend’s crib when her parents are at work and letting her call him by his government name. And on “Make It Rain,” Pop unites with Brooklyn drill founding father Rowdy Rebel for a cinematic celebration between two rappers who had their moments unfairly stolen from them. Crucially, Shoot for the Stars Aim for the Moon doesn’t take into consideration that Pop Smoke’s legacy was already cemented. He didn’t need this glossy, high-budget experience. But Shoot for the Stars Aim for the Moon ’s flaws become an afterthought, and the good moments here will outlast them. Having new Pop Smoke music to play at backyard BBQs and out of car windows is good enough. All the album needs is his voice, which will last forever.

NO,Boris,by: Grayson Haver Currin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f028f0bdc55f46b46324297/1:1/w_160/NO_Boris.jpg,2020-07-07 05:00:00,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/boris-no/,self-released,"The first quarter-century of recordings by the Japanese trio Boris plays like a guide to heavy music’s assorted possibilities. Since the mid-’90s, they have pivoted from curdled psych-rock to blown-out doom, from snarling thrash to blissful shoegaze, from chaotic improv to manicured pop, scurrying like a cornered animal looking for a spring from a waiting stylistic trap. Can you imagine any other band recording with Merzbow and the Cult’s Ian Astbury? That remarkable versatility has made Boris a lodestar for collapsing subgenre walls, within metal and beyond—if Boris were having so much fun digging through and temporarily donning metal’s various garbs, especially on stage, shouldn’t you? But Boris’ albums have often suffered from that discursive zeal, as the band methodically moved among their obsessions in a way that could feel academic or clinical. They’d build momentum just to squander it, put you in trance just to interrupt it. All that whiplash could get tiring—on last year’s tedious LφVE & EVφL, their studio debut for Third Man, even Boris sounded over it. Not now, however: The remarkable NO—self-recorded during quarantine starting in late March and self-released in a digital rush—is a gloriously claustrophobic crucible full of all the sounds Boris make best, heated by indignation with our time of closed borders and extreme international turmoil. Boris squeeze almost everything they’ve ever done and loved into these breathless 40 minutes—hardcore tirades and harsh-noise onslaughts, doom-metal riffs and droning tones, rock’n’roll hooks and reverb-shrouded murmurs. NO may be the most compelling and singular album they’ve made since their stateside 2005 breakthrough, Pink. But it’s a complete inversion of those thrashing party jams and hazy anthems—this is Boris, mad as fuck, screaming at the world about the feeling. It is fun and, as they correctly note in an accompanying essay, “extreme healing music.” NO is rooted in the explosive power of punk-metal crossover. Put it on in the background as you go about your day, and you’ll mostly notice the wonderful belligerence of these short, riotous tunes. “Anti-Gone” feels like Motörhead imploring the crowd to cut loose. “Kikinoue” manages to lumber like doom and lunge like hardcore, like the best of Cloud Rat or even Integrity. They barrel through a relentless, noise-spiked cover of “Fundamental Error,” by cantankerous Japanese hardcore band Gudon. Katsumi Sugahara, who’s played in several such groups since the mid-’80s, adds splenetic guitar to this euphoric tantrum, a testament to the domestic inspiration. The most remarkable thing about NO, though, is what’s often hidden in its recesses, whether  buried beneath the songs’ pummeling beats and hoarse screams or wedged between the tracks like musical bookends. “Non Blood Lore” might scan like a simple D-beat sortie, but it sports a hook ready for classic-rock radio. “HxCxHxC -Parforation Line-” lets hardcore and shoegaze dissolve into one another until they form a chimera. It’s one of Boris’ most ingenious moves ever, a perfect fusion of their preferred extremes. These songs often fade out of or into some seemingly unrelated motif, like the Sabbath-sized chords that end “Loveless” or the writhing circuitry that starts “Lust.” The album mirrors that structure, too. Boris begin with the instrumental doom march “Genesis,” the riff circling the rhythm like aircraft surveying a target, and end with “Interlude,” a ghostly ballad so vaporous it conjures cirrus clouds. They’re all reminders of how much experience Boris funnel into NO, how many ideas are at play within songs that may seem simple. White-hot rage and long-simmering frustration bind all these sounds together. You don’t need a translated lyrics sheet to sense that—the music is visceral, the feelings palpable. The words, howled and grunted, consider the loss of love as an extinction event and position music as an outlet for anxiety. Punk is a historically reliable outlet for such invective, of course, a cross-cultural language of discontent whose urgency can’t be mistaken. But in returning to that atavistic expression for NO, Boris didn’t cordon off these songs from the rest of their musical lives. The resulting sense of chaos redoubles Boris’ wrath and gives it a welcome depth, the sense that it’s here to stay because it’s been here all along.

Both of Us / Are U Down,Jayda G,by: Megan Buerger,Contributor ,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5efe2ed8dc55f46b46324179/1:1/w_160/Jayda%20G.jpg,2020-07-07 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/jayda-g-both-of-us-are-u-down/,Ninja Tune,"Jayda Guy makes intimate club music that asks big questions. Her 2019 debut album, Significant Changes–a product of the years she spent earning her graduate degree in environmental toxicology while establishing herself as a sought-after DJ in Berlin–explored the ways that humans interact with the world around them. Through delightfully peculiar field recordings (crying orca whales, a lecturing biologist) and heady incantations (“This floor is for grooving!” she howled at clubgoers caught scrolling Instagram), the Canadian-born, London-based producer called on us to view both the earth and the club as sacred spaces worthy of preserving. Her sensual follow-up EP, the two-track Both of Us/Are U Down, is a more emotional inquiry, and one that seems less interested in real answers. Instead, each track simply considers a state of mind––one is yearning and romantic, the other anxious and contemplative––and studies them in the context of blissed-out house. Both songs are steeped in uncertainty; on “Both f Us,” she wonders out loud if she has enough love to compensate for all that’s missing in her life, and on “Are U Down,” she gets stuck in a spiral of doubt and indecision. There is something about the fragility of each of these narratives––their unreliable structures, irresolution, and nagging loops of logic (“I can/I can/I can’t,” she sings)–that feels refreshingly human. If dance floors are sanctums for self-acceptance, shouldn’t our imperfections come with us, too? Guy turned to early Chicago house records for inspiration, and you can hear the soulful, jazzy touch of producers like Mr. Fingers and Marshall Jefferson, two of the scene’s forebears who used the voice as a textural instrument to bridge the gap between gospel and disco. By chopping it up and weaving it alongside hissing hi-hats, synth vamps, kick drums, and uplifting piano––the bedrock of many classic house tunes––they discovered that vocals could sound at once orgasmic and spiritual. (Here, halfway through Guy’s nostalgic “Sunset Bliss” remix, she cues a joyful, euphoric breakdown in which she sends her voice soaring into a flurry of sky-high howls and sighs.) The sound from this particular era has recently made its way back into mainstream popularity, with mega-club DJs like Calvin Harris, Kygo, and Martin Solveig releasing their own glossy takes. But there is a tenderness and intimacy to Guy’s approach that sets her apart. She sounds shy, bashful, and way up close, like you’re eavesdropping on a personal phone call. At certain moments, it sounds like she’s breathing right into your ear. That sense of immediate proximity is present all over Guy’s work, but in the context of the current moment it feels like a plea for human connection–that implicit, physical bond that can only be found on a dance floor. Imagine how a sea of sweating bodies would react to the dramatic third act of “Both of Us,” when the beat slows down and the drums drop out leaving just her, hand claps, and piano. It’s a pause that feels custom-made for when the DJ suddenly hits the floodlights and encourages you to take in everyone who’s been dancing alongside you in the dark. For now, it’s a spirited reminder of how precious and fleeting those moments can be. Catch up every Saturday with 10 of our best-reviewed albums of the week.

Futuro Conjunto,Futuro Conjunto,by: Matthew Ismael Ruiz,"Associate Staff Writer, News",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f0292b3464fe661509ab358/1:1/w_160/Futuro%20Conjunto_Futuro%20Conjunto.jpg,2020-07-07 05:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/futuro-conjunto-futuro-conjunto/,Conmatizque,"What might our future look like viewed through the lens of the past? For scholar Jonathan Leal and producer/filmmaker Charlie Vela, both musicians and natives of the Rio Grande Valley region of South Texas, it looks like Futuro Conjunto. A sci-fi narrative “transmedia” project set 250 years hence that features audio, video, animation, and fictive found objects, Futuro Conjunto focuses its gaze on the RGV, a 100-mile floodplain along the Texas-Mexico border that follows the Rio Grande to its terminus at the Gulf of Mexico. Packaged in a multimedia website and accompanied by a digital album available on Bandcamp, Futuro Conjunto tells the story of a young man seeking, finding, and listening to a damaged bootleg recording of a concert that took place in 2120 in an abandoned rocket facility in Boca Chica, Texas. The concert was produced by a mutual-aid network formed during the Second Mexican-American War, which began in the wake of a massive hurricane that reshaped the Rio Grande, and in turn, the U.S.-Mexico border. In the year 2200, a young man visits a repository of knowledge called El Centro Conmatizque looking for information about a concert that, according to family lore, his great-great-great-great-grandmother once played. It’s there, at the ECC, that the narrative begins. Futuro Conjunto’s speculative sci-fi is rooted in plausibility, its story driven by events that feel like fiction only because they haven’t happened yet. The website offers an expository timeline that places the record within its context; the fictional group MUNDO’s song title “Futurasquache” is explained as the philosophy of the Colonia Cosmica, a sustainable self-governing settlement that recycles technology; breakthroughs in “tachyon modeling and quantum computing” lead to an AI revolution that includes AI musicians, one of whom, JUL/3Z, performs on “The Run Pt. II.” It’s all incredibly nerdy, with the kind of attention to detail and historical nuance expected of a postdoctoral fellow studying “race and ethnicity through intersections of literary criticism, ethnomusicology, and performance studies.” At Stanford for his Ph.D, Leal first reached out to Vela after seeing As I Walk Through The Valley, the documentary Vela made with Ronnie Garza on the RGV’s musical history. Skeptical at first—having fielded plenty of suspect requests for access to Valley musicians after the release of his film—Vela eventually opened up once he realized that they could use academic grants to support his local scene. Their first project together, Wild Tongue, was a compilation of local acts that served as a snapshot of the area’s music scene—hip-hop, electro pop, country, indie rock, tejano, and rancheras—rooted in the artists’ experiences in the Valley. Futuro Conjunto’s music was largely written and performed by Leal and Vela themselves, who then brought in many of those same musicians to perform as members of the fictional bands they created. Their influence on Vela and Leal is undeniable; you can hear echoes of Wild Tongue in Futuro Conjunto, projecting the POV of the Valley’s artists, scholars, and activists onto an imagined pseudo-apocalyptic future. Though marked by tragedy, that future is far from dystopian; it’s marked by an underlying current of resilience, an enduring hope that there will always be a resistance. “Futurasquache” champions the Colonia Cosmica’s “Basura Bandits,” who hijack garbage trucks and dump their toxic contents on the doorstep of the elite gated community whence it came. Amid squealing guitars and electronic feedback, they find truth in the trash, building an entire worldview from recycling refuse. “When they tried to bury us/They didn’t know what we’d dig up/We know the truth because we’ve seen the past/It’s out there, buried underneath a hundred thousand plastic commemorative Selena cups!” Considering the Valley’s long-running intersection between activism and music, it’s fitting that the first song we hear would be a fiery missive from eco-bandits that battle the rich and powerful. Despite the tone of that opening track, there’s a cheekiness throughout Futuro Conjunto that hints that its creators don’t take themselves too seriously. And it’s not immune to some mild cheese, either: CODEX’s “The Run Pt. II (ft. JUL/3Z)” is an overt nod to El-P and Killer Mike’s hip-hop buddy comedy, doing their best to ape El Producto’s SkyNet battle hymns, an admittedly impossible task. And the hurricane that decimates the Valley, re-shaping the landscape and setting the stage for a second Mexican-American war? Hurricane Narciso, as in Martinez, the father of conjunto music; La Mosca No Muere pay tribute to him with a song titled after his affectionate nickname, “El Huracán del Valle.” The album’s strongest tracks are less overtly tied to the fictional universe, yet still speak to the Valley’s past and present. Simonada’s “Heatdeath” uses gorgeous multi-part harmonies and a chirping horn to channel Beach House’s melancholic malaise. And XXochitl’s ”La Madre de las Estrellas” features a prominent accordion melody from the son of Valley legend Esteban Jordan. The only song not written by Leal and Vela is a choral rendition of Fernando Z. Maldonado’s classic “Volver, Volver,” which serves as a coda to the fragmented livestream bootleg, arriving just before the police break up the concert. Even removed from its narrative context, Futuro Conjunto still serves as a time capsule for the thriving independent arts and music scene in the Rio Grande Valley. The perspective is Leal and Vela’s, but few others are as well positioned to document this particular moment in time, and Vela’s studio has served as a creative hub for many of the Valley’s musicians. More importantly, each of the fictional events that make up “The Flickering Century”—the 100-year period from 2020-2120 that the project covers—is rooted in a fundamental understanding of history, the Valley, the U.S., and humanity at large. The timeline ends with measured hope: While the war ended with a cynically named “Treaty of Unbinding Illusion,” the citizens on each side of the re-shaped river form a new cross-border community called Rio Cristal, and a communal decree establishes El Centro Conmatizque, founded with the intention of retaining every piece of submitted data in perpetuity. It’s what allows the seeker to find the recording of the concert, spurred by a memory passed down to him through generation after generation. In the indigenous Nahuatl language, Conmatizque means “They will remember.” Futuro Conjunto represents the hope that our future salvation might be found in the remnants of our own history.

City on Lock,City Girls,by: Lakin Starling,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5efa1b84464fe661509aac0a/1:1/w_160/City%20on%20Lock_City%20Girls%20.jpg,2020-07-06 05:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/city-girls-city-on-lock/,Quality Control,"For Miami, Florida duo City Girls, pain and fortune often live in tandem. Yung Miami has balanced becoming both a rap star and a mother of two while separated from collaborator JT, whose recent federal incarceration for credit card fraud highlighted the prison industrial complex that disproportionately affects Black women. The pair have overcome an unfair share of adversity, challenges that represent systematic factors many of us confront while working hard for our dreams and the space to thrive, raise families, and celebrate. So for City Girls, who were finally reunited last fall, the premature leak of their new album City on Lock—much of it recorded from separate states—was especially devastating. But throughout the 15 tracks, Yung Miami and JT come through with their signature amped-up party jams, while also making space to acknowledge what they’ve survived. It’s a dynamic informed by their time apart during a trying period that required confidence and ambition to conquer. The appeal of City Girls’ music is the duo’s ability to turn up, take up space, and demand the crème da la crème, despite life’s hardships. City on Lock underscores their humor and their money-making mission, but it’s also tempered with reflection. Yung Miami is first up on the punchy double-track album opener “Enough/Better.” She sets the in-your-face energy at the top of her verse: “Enough is enough, bitch/City Girls with the fuck shit,” she snaps. It’s a familiar City Girls mood, one that reminds their foes that she and her crew are prepared to defend themselves. “Don’t make me put my wig in a rubber band!” Yung Miami warns in a jokey ad-lib. Halfway through, the track segues into the breezy “Better,” allowing City Girls to let us in on their vulnerability. “I’m fightin’ loss, fightin’ demons and anxiety/I really used to sleep on pallets/Now I’m sittin’ in the condo like it’s a palace,” JT raps. Yung Miami reflects with the same self-acknowledgment as she recalls losing JT and her mother to the prison system and surviving a shooting at seven months pregnant—all while becoming world-famous. City Girls have always made the kind of music that might support you in dancing through your issues, but seeing the pair make room to talk about their own adds dimension. On “Jobs,” they make their status clear and revel in the fruits of their labor. “I don’t work jobs/Bitch I am a job,” City Girls say in the hook. Miami in particular shines on the Southside-produced anthem “Pussy Talk,” featuring Doja Cat. She sets the energy of the song with a snooty tone as she rants in the chorus, “Don’t nothin’ but this cash make this pussy talk/Don’t nothin’ but a bag make this pussy talk.” Both anthems are laced with free game on how to receive pleasure and gifts from men willing to ante up. The friendship between Yung Miami and JT remains the most special component of City Girls. “I go so hard for my sister til the end we came from nothin man,” JT wrote on Twitter last week. It’s a natural synergy that spills out into the enthusiasm of their music. Fully in sync over the chest-shaking bass of Twsyted Genius production on “That’s My Bitch,” City Girls are playful while crushing their time on the mic. “Pretty bitch, plenty racks in the Chanel bag/Yung Miami keep the Glock if you act bad/Pussy juice drippin’ on a nigga durag,” JT brags. They’ve witnessed one another’s laborious come-up and they’re here to cheer each other on. City on Lock closes with the short and sobering “Ain’t Say Nothin.” As at the start of the album, City Girls go deeper into the traumas they’ve overcome. JT raps about being left by her mother and raised by her father: “Middle finger to my daddy/Why a sucker had to fuck my mammy/Left us and he traumatized us badly/Created him, a savage/Hustle hard just to get cabbage/’Cause growin’ up, a bitch never had it.” At just over a minute, the song feels a bit incomplete, fading out just as they open up: “I get it out the muscle/Nigga, you ain’t sayin’ nothin’/I’m a grown-ass woman/I ain’t a stranger to the struggle.” City Girls have endured tribulations and amassed an abundance they’d always wanted, an underappreciated and compelling piece of their narrative. Though Yung Miami and JT end with a somber look back, City on Lock is also a testament to their blessings. Catch up every Saturday with 10 of our best-reviewed albums of the week.

Tactics EP,Soccer96,by: Grayson Haver Currin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5efbe647464fe661509aae70/1:1/w_160/Tactics_Soccer96.jpg,2020-07-06 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/soccer96-tactics-ep/,Moshi Moshi,"For most of a decade, London’s Soccer96 were satisfied with simply being fun. Most every track from the explosive electronic duo felt like another instantaneous celebration: two or three minutes of carousel keyboards and squealing synthesizers, stretched like neon spandex across a skeleton of dancing drums. Soccer96 bestowed these kinetic pieces with puns and playful references, even employing personal aliases that suggested gaming handles. “Our music feels like playing a game,” Danalogue, or keyboardist Dan Leavers, once acknowledged, “on two-player mode.” Tactics, Soccer96’s first release in two years, is as propulsive as anything from that past. Betamax, or drummer Max Hallett, pairs the spring of prime disco beats with the long-range insistence of krautrock. Danalogue shapes mellifluous melodies that flash out of the dark, like a nightclub’s synchronized lights. Peppered with cowbell and buttressed with bass from engineer Capitol K, these tracks unfurl like extended instrumental mixes of some irrepressible dance hit. But on Tactics, Soccer96 have added an element so obvious it may seem overdue: a lyrical theme. Working with saxophonist and poet Alabaster DePlume, who’s already released one of this harried year’s most heavenly records, Soccer96 build a three-song suite that excoriates infinite capitalism, lambastes generational apathy, and foretells a perilous revolution. Tapping deep traditions of revolutionary jazz and radical punk, Tactics offers motivational anthems not only for keeping up the fight but for shaming others to join in, too. Soccer96 exist in tandem with The Comet Is Coming, Betamax and Danalogue’s trio with visionary saxophonist Shabaka Hutchings. After Hutchings sat in for some of their early sets in London’s hotbed of hybridized jazz, they launched their spiritual-jazz-meets-ecstatic-electronics wonder. Hutchings is a master of shaping larger conceptual frameworks for his music. Sons of Kemet’s Your Queen Is a Reptile, for instance, celebrates the stories of Black women while chastising the British monarchy. Shabaka and the Ancestors’ We Are Sent Here by History reimagines the future of utopias by reconnecting with ideas from South Africa. Soccer96 have now borrowed that guiding principle—that they can sound fun and say something—for themselves. “I Was Gonna Fight Fascism” is a seven-minute sendup of would-be protestors who are too busy, preoccupied, or scared to help save society. Though a trenchant mockery, it’s as delightful as LCD Soundsystem’s “Losing My Edge” or ESG’s “Erase You,” twin predecessors that turn taunts into hooks. During “Children Will Dance,” DePlume evokes the elegant menace of the apocalypse-minded David Tibet as he offers up nightmarish scenarios of exploitation. With its rubber-band bassline and acid-house keyboards, though, the song sounds like a refutation of that doom, a dance one step ahead of the demons. “Buy It” is the true call to arms here, begging to be stretched for a quarter-hour onstage in front of a sweaty crowd yelling the title back at DePlume in belligerent antiphony. As the drums and circuits tango around him, DePlume recites a sardonic list of the pleasures people try to purchase: sexual satisfaction, a head of hair, a just future, more money itself. “Do you want personal distance from the colonial crimes that made your comfort and nourishment possible? Do what everyone else does,” he commands at one point, smartly breaking his grand self-indictment across the beat. “Buy it,” he sneers, the band joining his Greek chorus of condemnation. When exasperation overwhelms DePlume, he screams into his saxophone, summoning the brittle pleas of Albert Ayler. Betamax and Danalogue rush like a river beneath him, ushering him toward his next anti-capitalist grievance. This vitriolic liturgy reinforces the little ways we can wound capitalism—that is, we can’t buy happiness, so stop trying. More important, though, it’s a pointed reminder to challenge the broader systems that perpetuate inequality, the final boss of our global video game. At a moment when white folks solicit multi-generational forgiveness by Venmo-ing Black people a few bucks instead of demanding larger conversations about reparations and reshaping policy, “Buy It” feels like theme music for the bigger battle. This isn’t the kind of carefree video-game glee Soccer96 might once have imagined. But their reinvention arrives right on time.

I’m Allergic to Dogs! EP,Remi Wolf,by: Leah Mandel ,Contributor ,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5efa1d62dc55f46b46323e77/1:1/w_160/I'm%20Allergic%20To%20Dogs!_Remi%20Wolf.jpg,2020-07-06 05:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/remi-wolf-im-allergic-to-dogs/,Island,"Remi Wolf has a bright, gamboling sensibility that extends from her music to her record titles to the way she presents herself and her work. Her ecstatic single “Woo!”, from her new five-song EP I’m Allergic To Dogs, is an “explosion of my feelings on LOVE,” she told Clash magazine. And Wolf has a whole cache of it judging not only by her joyful, sultry, playful new record but by her whole thing. It was clear even from her appearance on American Idol at 17, where she sang “Let’s Get It On” to Jennifer Lopez, Keith Urban, and Harry Connick Jr. not long after pivoting from training to be an Olympic skier. Wolf shied from the Idol-type path, though her expressive soul chops could certainly have carried her all the way. Wolf exists at the center of a Venn diagram that includes the post-PC Music hyper pop contingent (like Rina Sawayama and Wolf’s friend and collaborator Alice Longyu Gao), feel-good, “lo-fi,” “bedroom” pop artists (like JAWNY and Still Woozy, also friends of Wolf’s) and the current wave of funk and disco (like Ric Wilson and Ian Isiah). Her music clicks all the trend boxes, yet it feels super fresh. There’s a lot going on in the pop world right now, but Wolf has managed to nail all the fashionable references without losing her own sound. She’s cited Chaka Khan, Daryl Hall, David Byrne, Michael McDonald, John Mayer, and Erykah Badu as influences. There’s some reggae in here, too, on “Hello Hello Hello,” about “a certified gambler” who’s playing with Wolf’s feelings from the opposite coast, and the celebratory nature of her music at times recalls early ’90s dance hits from Deee-Lite and C+C Music Factory. Wolf’s music begs for remixes (Free Nationals’ “Photo ID” one is great) and the closeness of a club or a barbecue. Wolf’s puckish vibe is highly endearing. I’m Allergic To Dogs is her proper debut EP on Island, and a follow-up of sorts to her first EP, You’re A Dog!, which came out last September. (Wolf is in fact allergic to dogs, and yet she recently bought a puppy.) In the EP’s opening track, “Down The Line,” she references OutKast’s “Hey Ya” and at one point there’s a puppy bark and a baby’s squeal. She recently told The Line of Best Fit she’s been inspired by the silliness and absurdity of kids’ shows—there’s something about the freedom of childhood-informed expression that gives Wolf’s music its unhampered feel. She has a sense of humor about herself. The playfulness pairs well with the intrinsic sexiness of Wolf’s rhythms, even if her lyrics sometimes border on nonsensical. She annotated the Genius page of her own record to note You’re A Dog! was created in various bedrooms across California, all while she was “sometimes crying, sometimes laughing, and most times angry.” I love this summation because she speaks to the way this kind of punchy pop music can encapsulate a whole range of emotions while remaining what it is: really fun. It is possible to make a banging, exuberant pop song while full of rage or disappointment. “You’re so mean/But I can’t dream without you,” Wolf sings, her vocals pitched-up, on “Photo ID,” which was co-written with Solange collaborator John Carroll Kirby. The song snaps, zips, and fizzes with funk verve. It makes me wanna shake my ass. The whole EP does. The energy never really dips—it’s lowest on “Hello Hello Hello,” perhaps the EP’s weakest moment, but not by far. And although it’s cool when Wolf distorts her voice, it’s much better when you can hear the depth of her vocals, the emotion in her voice, like on “Woo!” or “Disco Man,” which is particularly passionate, as she sings about a man who’s “wasted all his money” but has “never been a waste of time,” and can decidedly “kiss [her] hand.” Above all, Wolf’s clear sense of herself is what makes her music really work. You can almost picture her, like a collage artist, going galaxy brain with all her references and kooky found sounds. There’s nothing exactly new happening here, but the deftness with which Wolf wields her voice, and guides what could be a too-chaotic sound into precise pop magic, is remarkable.

National Freedom,Lonnie Holley,by: Madison Bloom,Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5efc9ff58813ffa92664ed76/1:1/w_160/National%20Freedom_Lonnie%20Holley.jpg,2020-07-06 05:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/lonnie-holley-national-freedom/,Jagjaguwar,"Experimental blues man Lonnie Holley is one of America’s great alchemists. As a visual artist and sculptor, he treats found objects and household materials—rocking chairs, padlocks, a charred television—with their entire history in mind. He respects their past as functioning tools of the mundane, but honors their spiritual and philosophical value as vessels of memory. As a songwriter, the Alabama native similarly builds rich compositions on the foundation of American roots music, but reshapes them into works that are beyond genre. Like his sculptures fashioned from rudimentary components, his songs are often arranged rather simply on a handful of familiar instruments. On his new EP National Freedom—recorded in 2014 at the late Richard Swift’s studio of the same name—Holley invokes a mythical atmosphere from his very human surroundings. Throughout National Freedom, Holley roams from searing blues to downtempo dub to freeform wanderings on piano. Nothing is particularly beholden to a traditional structure; instead, his compositions sound more like fever dreams of songs—streams of consciousness unimpeded by the architecture of the waking mind. The sparse “In It Too Deep” features just Holley’s voice and kalimba; the plucked instrument, made from a small wooden base and metal tines, sounds like a musical baby mobile twisting above a crib. “Just want to stick my hand out,” Holley sings, “to grab ahold to something extraordinary.” Holley’s philosophy revolves around “the beauty of noticing all,” and in this song he seems to be both the baby marvelling at the dangling mobile and the man who built the nursery all at once. Opener “Crystal Doorknob” is more tethered to the earth, but it possesses a similar sense of wonder as “In It Too Deep” and its piano-based companion “So Many Rivers (The First Time).” While those tracks are airy and delicate, “Crystal Doorknob” is smeared with soil. Holley’s voice is gravelled, and Marshall Ruffin’s electric guitar sounds born of the swamplands. The loping, repetitive instrumentation supports Holley’s imagery: He recalls walking through a dense forest, where he stumbles upon an ornate door standing alone in the middle of it, without explanation. The door doesn’t lead anywhere, or solve any preexisting mystery. It’s just there, and that’s enough. For all of Holley’s contented musings and observations—some of which sound downright Buddhist in their detachment—the best song on National Freedom is drowned in longing. On “Like Hell Broke Away,” Holley mourns lost love, singing the most anguished of blues ballads. His woman has left him, and he laments her on three multi-tracked vocal channels: He screeches incoherently, blubbers and growls, and accompanies himself with booming doo-wop backing vocals that sound like perfectly timed sobs. In addition to being the boldest, rawest entry on the EP, it is the richest, musically speaking. Holley commands a whirring Melatron, and Ben Sollee’s cello ups the drama. The synthesis of all these parts mimics the inferno of a fresh heartbreak—even if you can crawl out of the bubbling lava, it still takes a while for the fires to die and the smoke to clear. Unlike many of Holley’s songs, “Like Hell Broke Away” is rooted in an eminently relatable human experience, which might explain its strength. Like his sculptures, it takes the familiar and makes it beautifully strange.","In a 2014 session with the late Richard Swift, the Alabama sculptor and blues man builds on the foundation of American roots music, reshaping his influences into works that transcend genre.

Seo Taiji and Boys,Seo Taiji and Boys,by: Noah Yoo,Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5efb9d92dc55f46b46323f3b/1:1/w_160/Seo%20Taiji%20and%20Boys_Seo%20Taiji%20and%20Boys.png,2020-07-05 05:00:00,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/seo-taiji-and-boys-seo-taiji-and-boys/,Bando,"On April 11, 1992, Seo Taiji, 20, Yang Hyun-seok, 22, and Lee Juno, 25, made their national television debut on a South Korean music show under the name Seo Taiji and Boys. They were the first of several groups to perform that night, all of which were angling for high scores from the presiding judges. Seo, their leader, wore a grey vest and billowing black pants, while the Boys were decked in overalls and matching green button-ups. The trio delivered an energetic, lip-synced performance of “Nan Arayo (I Know):” a new jack swing single that wove together rap verses, distorted guitars, and lovelorn harmonizing: “I really only liked you/You, who thrust me into sadness’ embrace,” Seo wailed in the chorus. Their dance routine ended in a dramatic pose and cheers and applause came from the audience. But the panel of established industry professionals standing off-stage were less impressed. “The melody is a bit weak. It doesn’t feel like you put a lot of effort into it,” said one. “It would have been nice to hear something fresh in your lyrics,” opined another. The judges awarded Seo Taiji and Boys the lowest score of any of the acts performing that night. What happened next can only be described as a mass rebuke by the public: “Nan Arayo” quickly shot to the top of the Korean charts and stayed there for 18 weeks, while the corresponding album Seo Taiji and Boys went on to sell 1.7 million copies, not counting an incalculable number of bootleg cassettes. They didn’t know it at the time, but Seo Taiji and Boys would become the prototype for all of the K-pop groups to come. Seo’s fusion of hip-hop, techno, and rock—colloquially termed “rap dance”—had become South Korea’s first homegrown youth music. Born Jeong Hyun-cheol in 1972, Seo was a problem student, a self-described rebel who dropped out of high school to pour his energy into music. He immersed himself in the Seoul rock scene as he worked odd jobs and learned how to play the guitar and bass. At 17, he was recruited into Sinawe, the heavy metal institution led by Korean rock royalty Shin Dae-chul. But after recording just one album with them, Seo left the band and started to dabble with samplers and MIDI instruments to try and recreate the sounds he was hearing in American pop music. The early ’90s marked the first time in modern Korean history that teenagers gained access to disposable income, a phenomenon spurred on by the country’s increasingly globalized economy. At the time, Korean music was dominated by acoustic guitar-driven folk music and “trot,” a slow-moving style that predates the Korean War, but the youth—including Seo—had become increasingly obsessed with the music that was popular in America: high-tempo, dance-oriented tracks, heavily influenced by prevalent Black music genres like hip-hop and new jack swing. Black music was introduced to the South Korean masses in the ’80s, around the time the country began transitioning from decades of various authoritarian regimes to a direct democracy in 1987. Long exclusive to American soldiers, the G.I. clubs of Itaewon—a district in Seoul adjacent to the U.S. military’s South Korea headquarters in Yongsan—began to open up to Korean patrons. New communities developed; in 1990, Hyun Jin-young, a gifted dancer who’d grown up with American friends while living in a village near the Army base, made his debut as the first signee of a budding record exec named Lee Soo-Man (who would later found SM Entertainment). With years of studio experience under his belt, Seo was poised to tap into the burgeoning cultural moment. The only problem was, compared to other hotshots in the scene, he couldn’t dance for shit. Driven to improve, Seo called upon a rising star named Yang Hyun-seok to ask him for coaching. (As the story goes, Yang took Seo’s money and vanished into thin air. He later returned with the sheepish claim that he had disappeared because he was serving his mandatory military service.) Yang was impressed with Seo’s music and offered his services directly, recommending they form a group with another dancer, Lee Juno. It was an arrangement that was amenable to Seo, who had little interest in the intense spotlight that came with being a solo artist. He liked being able to hide behind the two older Boys on stage, though he understood as well as they did that the success of their partnership was largely contingent upon his own songwriting and studio prowess. Even to fans, it was always clear who was running the ship. The trio agreed to relatively even financial splits for any touring and performance income—but when it came to album royalties, the split went Seo’s direction, 6:2:2. With Seo’s leading role cemented, and soon after that fated TV performance, Seo Taiji and Boys’ career became a runaway train. Conservative critics and traditional gatekeepers like broadcasters and radio stations initially blasted the group for their overt “foreign” musical influences, but nobody could argue with the sales. More music shows started catering to the teen demographic, and soon enough, Seo Taiji and Boys became a regular fixture on television. The release of their first album, and the months of live appearances that followed, established several of the recurrent themes of K-pop and its industry: An undiscriminating approach to genre tropes, emphasis on elaborate choreography, and practices like the pre-“comeback” hiatus period that follows every album cycle, now considered customary. In the same way that production styles tend to linger on Korean charts a few years past their U.S. expiration date, much of Seo Taiji and Boys owes a debt to musical trends that had become passé in the West by the end of the ’80s. By the time “Nan Arayo” was released in Korea, new jack swing was a well-established sound in the U.S. mainstream, but the song is also clearly indebted to Milli Vanilli’s hit “Girl You Know It’s True,” which was already itself a French-German approximation of American pop. The euphoric, New Order-biting synth-pop of “My Everything” would have sounded dated to American audiences, and a disproportionate number of album tracks are peppered with saxophone runs that would give Kenny G pause. At moments, Seo reaches even further back in time: The end of the original album had a song called “Rock’n Roll Dance (‘92 Heavy Mix),” built around a sped-up sample of the guitar from AC/DC’s 1980 classic “Back in Black.” It’s a throwaway club track, but its inclusion reveals Seo’s core musical ethos: Taking the music that inspired him most and refashioning it to be relatable to Korean youth. He even recruited his old mentor Shin Dae-chul to rip a guitar solo, an olive branch to any rock fans who felt betrayed by his musical pivot. There were detractors, even among the music community, who were doubtful of Seo Taiji and Boys’ viability. Seo pursued his mission nonetheless—not only because he thought it would work, but because he loved the music. “When I said that I was going to write Black music, someone responded by saying that I’d turned to making charcoal, because charcoal is black,” Seo said in 2014. “That’s how some people demeaned Black music back then. But it was all I cared about.” The frontman’s earnest nature shines on slow-burners like “In the Time Spent With You,” where he delivers breathy, sing-song rap verses and long, drawn-out notes about savoring a moment with his lover, reminiscing on the wonderful, fuzzy feeling he gets when he’s with them. Seo isn’t always the most confident vocalist, but when he bathes his voice in cold, digital reverb, he comes alive. The huge success of “Nan Arayo” was quickly followed by another single, “You, In the Fantasy,” a raucous dance track about questioning your preconceived reality. It foreshadows the lyrics of more controversial anthems from later in Seo’s career, like “Come Back Home” or “Classroom Idea,” where he reached out to runaway teens and took aim at Korea’s pressurized academic expectations. As the years went on, Seo would only grow increasingly passionate about bringing attention to societal ills and interrogating a national culture that he felt like an outcast in. On the street, though, he was no outcast; he was a cultural prophet. Like the K-pop groups of today, Seo Taiji and Boys developed an obsessive fanbase, one that clung to his every word. For the rest of 1992, “Nan Arayo” blasted out of speakers everywhere in Seoul, aided by the vendors across the city hawking tapes of the album. Half of the Korean recorded music market consisted of foreign imports before Seo Taiji and Boys, but in the years that followed, listeners became much more willing to take a chance on Korean artists working in Western music styles, and the industry followed suit. By 1997, the market share of Korean-made pop music was double that of international acts. With his success, Seo terraformed the market for Korean artists and became the country’s first teen idol, the primary conduit by which a subculture from half a world away would inform the identities of an entire generation of Koreans. As Seo Taiji and Boys’ popularity skyrocketed, Korean-made pop acts inspired by rap, R&B, and other Black music replaced singer-songwriter types as the new dominant force in the Korean music industry. In 1994, Seo languished in controversy after radio stations banned the singles from Seo Taiji and Boys III and Korea’s Christian right accused him of hiding demonic messages that would only reveal themselves if a song was played backwards. Suffering from the intense public scrutiny and a lack of inspiration, Seo confessed to Yang and Lee that he wanted to end the group once they released their fourth record. 1995’s Seo Taiji and Boys IV was a commercial hit, driven by the Cypress Hill-esque “Come Back Home,” but Seo once again found himself butting heads with censors, who reviewed the album before release and forbade him from including lyrics that were critical of the government on the song “Sidae Yugam (Shame of the Times).” He refused to change the lyrics, instead opting to delete his vocals and keep the song as an instrumental. Fans were enraged and went so far as to protest the censorship with a letter-writing campaign—but Seo had had enough. At the beginning of 1996, he called a press conference: Seo Taiji and Boys were retiring, effective immediately. In a cinematic exit, Seo took a helicopter from the conference hall and went directly to the airport, hopping on a flight to Guam, and eventually, America. Millions of fans were devastated. Mobs of his most faithful trekked to his Seoul house to protest the decision. One student, speaking to The Kyunghang Shinmun at the time, compared it to the assassination of a politician: “The death of Seo Taiji is the death of us all.” The music industry scrambled to fill the void that Seo Taiji and Boys left behind. Long beholden to the whims of TV broadcasters, Korean record labels had consolidated more independent power for themselves in the years since Seo’s debut. Now, it was up to them to figure out how to rebottle his magic and build upon the playbook that was established during the band’s brief but substantial run. Thus, the Korean idol business was born. The Boys parlayed their fame and experience into positions of power in this nascent ecosystem: Yang started his own company YG Entertainment, the powerhouse behind iconic acts like Big Bang, while Lee became a notable producer. (In 2019, Yang resigned from YG following allegations of drug abuse, corruption, sexual assault, and other crimes. Lee was found guilty on charges of sexual assault and fraud in 2017.) By the end of the ’90s, SM Entertainment’s boy band H.O.T. had made serious inroads in China, kicking off the global Korean Wave (hallyu) of exported cultural soft power that continues to the present day. At some point between Seo Taiji’s debut and H.O.T.’s rise, overseas listeners began to popularize the umbrella term used to this day: K-pop. With their debut, Seo Taiji and Boys upended the pre-existing power dynamic in South Korea, where broadcasters were the ultimate gatekeepers and songwriters rarely veered away from making music that would fit the norms of the day. For a brief period, the power shifted to the artists, who were incentivized to experiment with different Western genres and build new communities. But as the newly established Big Three companies—SM, YG, and Park Jin-young’s JYP Entertainment—began to dominate the market, new standards emerged. Instead of government censors or disdainful television moguls, the industry became beholden to music conglomerates, powered by trainee pipelines so stringent, they make Berry Gordy look tame by comparison. The entirety of K-pop owes its existence to Seo Taiji, but the long tail of his influence can be felt most directly in the global force that is BTS. In 2017, during a massive 25th-anniversary concert in Korea, Seo—the de facto “president of culture”—named the group his unofficial successors. Their music draws from myriad influences, with songs that critique Korean society, while individual members like the multifaceted songwriter/producer SUGA take after the DIY auteur archetype established by Seo. His super-fans, the “Seo Taiji Generation,” fought government censorship on behalf of their idol; today, the BTS ARMY and other K-pop fandoms have proven themselves a force to be reckoned with. At his peak, Seo’s influence was largely limited to Korea. BTS are on the world stage, reaching previously unthinkable heights. They are his legacy. After Seo decamped to America at 23, he became just another face in the crowd. It was a needed change of pace for the notoriously private superstar, and it allowed him to write songs for what would become his first solo LP: a true rock album, a return to his roots. When Seo finally went back to Korea in 2000 to resurrect his career in earnest, his people were there waiting for him—literally. Over a thousand fans mobbed the terminal at Gimpo International Airport, eager to welcome their hero home. They sang his songs and held up signs; one of them read, “We Grew Up a Lot, Didn’t We?” The origin of K-pop is a tale of global capitalism and cultural cross-pollination through American imperialism, but it’s also the story of a flunkie metalhead who was told for years he’d amount to nothing, and then reshaped the course of music history.

The Passion Of,Special Interest,by: Jenn Pelly,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5efb778bdc55f46b46323ec7/1:1/w_160/The%20Passion%20Of_Special%20Interest.jpg,2020-07-03 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/special-interest-the-passion-of/,Thrilling LivingNight School,"In 2018, Special Interest located the middle ground between no wave and Nina Simone. The quartet’s debut album, Spiraling, began with a song—tough, anthemic, guttural, and glammy—called “Young, Gifted, Black, in Leather.” Evoking Simone’s Civil Rights Era anthem and the cool cultishness of their VHS-referencing band name, “Young, Gifted, Black, in Leather” fittingly opened with the High Priestess of Soul herself: “I want to shake people up so bad that when they leave a nightclub where I performed, I just want them to be to pieces,” goes the sample, and then the band follows in Simone’s high stakes. “The law is on my back/Every night,” Alli Logout shouts out. “The law is on my back/That’s why we fight.” In this current moment of razing systems and exposing histories, Special Interest is attuned to the future. “We are on the brink of a major collapse of everything,” Logout said in a 2019 interview. “I think what we are doing speaks to that. I want complete, total destruction of everything.” Perhaps when Logout screams “trust no wave” on “Young, Gifted, Black, in Leather,” it meant just that: Trust that your impulse towards destruction is for a reason. The Passion Of is the sound of art-punk, industrial, ambient, techno, and glam imploding on themselves. It’s vicious and physical, blistering at the edges of Maria Elena’s serrated guitars, Nathan Cassiani’s bass playing, and Ruth Mascelli’s blown-out synths and cavernous drum-machine beats—The Passion Of is made of sparks. Logout’s holler can pivot from playful to taunting to gnarled to vulnerable in an instant, and their pen is consistently ablaze, whether writing about sex and longing at end times or gentrification and the militarization of cities. The second track is a scorcher called “Disco III,” a ferocious blur of pain and ecstasy in the lawlessness of night, examining “sodomy on LSD!” “Disco III” follows Spiraling’s “Disco” and “Disco II,” which says a lot. At the core of their careening, rattling, irreverent noise, Special Interest honor and channel the Black and gay legacies of dance music and infuse them into their 2020 vision of punk as possibility. The animating “NO” of punk hits different with Special Interest: “What happens when there’s nothing left to gentrify and genocide is on your side?” Logout yelps in syncopated shouts on “Homogenized Milk,” describing the violence of such uprooting. Special Interest’s chaos is twisted but clear, a blustering push forward, asking inexhaustible questions, notably on the mesmerizing technoise banger, “All Tomorrow’s Carry.” It’s another lucid narrative of gentrification and displacement, about partying with an eye to the police state: “I watch the city crumble/Arise from the rubble/Another tawdry condo,” Logout observes in a cold post-punk speak-sing. “But would you bat an eye/Waiting for war machines to pass you by?” This is the horror of real life that many choose to overlook. Special Interest insist that you see it. The whole of The Passion Of seems to take place after dark, in the shadows, but it burns red. Amid the ugliness there is palpable joy and lust that embodies a liberationist ethos. “And I laugh/And I cry/Boo hoo hoo/Ha ha,” goes “Don’t Kiss Me in Public,” like turning the breadth of human feeling itself into an art concept. “A Depravity Such As This” is the record’s purest techno moment, a contorted buzzsaw banger of shrieked four-on-the-floor wreckage. And nowhere is the emotionality of The Passion Of more felt than the aching ballad “Street Pulse Beat,” as Logout describes pleasure out of reach: “I can’t take you there/Where desire unfolds,” they sing, “Maybe I don’t know myself/But to know you now I know.” “Street Pulse Beat” bears out a rare sensitivity; its punk build makes its infatuation, desperation, and noisy euphoria sound like a secret. If there is a thread to this music, it is survival. That considerable power comes into granular focus on The Passion Of’s monumental closer, “With Love,” which roils like a siren call. Logout narrates the stark realities of navigating life in a Black queer body—of “our fathers in cages,” of “the legacy of poverty within me,” the tyrannies of a world in which “We can’t breathe/In the fantasy of freedom/Choked out from me”—before envisioning an abolitionist future, “to free the millions from the mass cages.” Amid the song’s shrill metallic roar is the “the sweet smell of the rot of society” giving way to “agency and honesty/Joy with autonomy” and “the bliss of infinite love.” They illustrate a world collapsed and reborn. “The words I write that are bubbling inside of me could have been written yesterday or five years into the future,” Logout recently said in an interview. “They are not my own, they are from those I carry inside my DNA and from my friends I listen to, learn from, and struggle with.” In the lyrics to “With Love,” they quote the autobiography of activist Assata Shakur: “We have nothing to lose but our chains.” This insurrectionary song, and The Passion Of in full, heed Shakur’s revolutionary call. The song continues: A glimmer of light through grief
Like from the deepest depth of the sea
We welcome you to join us
As our tongues bleed this decree
Lucid the veil we see
The spirits they stand with thee
With passion aroused we call
For tomorrow the people take all By nature, punk offers a moment of ignition. But for Special Interest, there is also a horizon.

6pc Hot EP,6LACK,by: Evan Rytlewski,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5efc9d87464fe661509aaeae/1:1/w_160/6pc%20Hot%20EP_6LACK.jpg,2020-07-03 05:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6lack-6pc-hot-ep/,LVRNInterscope,"He may not be the genre’s biggest star, but few R&B singers have demonstrated a better understanding of the genre’s commercial winds than 6lack. On his 6pc Hot EP, he name-checks Usher and T-Pain, touchstones of popular ’00s R&B, but his own style mines more of-the-moment inspiration, from the late-night melancholy of Drake to the art-house soul of Frank Ocean, both of which he shades with the atmospheric trap of his native Atlanta, the longtime gravitational center of rap and R&B radio. He prides himself on his ties to the city. 6pc Hot, which opens with a cruise through the Atlanta of his youth, is titled after his favorite neighborhood wing spot (he’s marketing the EP with his own hot sauce). Even his stage name, cumbersome as it is, is a nod to the Zone 6 district where he was raised. Like most Atlantans on the charts right now, 6lack’s talents lie somewhere between rapping and  singing, and on his first two albums, he sometimes seemed to resent being boxed in as a singer. Even on his smoothest songs, he adopted the jaded detachment of a rapper. “Fuck me like you about to lose your place to the girl next store,” he sang on 2018's East Atlanta Love Letter, where he leaned hard on The Weeknd's tropes of toxic men and hateful sex. That's not a great look for anyone, and it was especially ill-fitting for an everyman like 6lack, who’s always been more convincing playing a wounded soul than an asshole. 6pc Hot shows what a pleasure he can be when he loses that sour edge. These six songs wallow less and luxuriate more. Soothing and sumptuous, more bittersweet than outright sad, the after-hours dispatches “Long Nights” and “Float” pair the coziness of an overstuffed couch with the sleek angles of an Eames chair. “I just followed the emotions of quarantine,” 6lack has explained of his process for the EP, and his lyrics periodically touch on the crisis—the isolation, the longing for out-of-reach comforts, the sense of being locked in an inescapable cycle—yet the music is too nimble, too free for lockdown. We should be so lucky if our quarantine felt like this. Even when 6lack is kicking around dopey boasts just for the fun of it on “ATL Freestyle,” he's gotten so improbably good at pairing together free associations that even lines that read like groaners on paper (“My life is VVS, I practice clarity”) breeze by like sweet nothings. And where 6lack's nonchalant delivery could previously scan as too cold, too removed, he’s gotten bolder at playing up the yearning and fragile beauty in his voice. The wait-until-quarantine-is-over ballad “Outside” is his most unabashedly sentimental song yet, and he sells the sweetness and romance. There’s just one feature on the EP, and it illustrates how delicate of a balance 6lack strikes between laidback and locked in. Lil Baby, who may be on the hottest streak of any rapper on the radio right now, attempts a quick lap on “Know My Rights,” yet he’s unable to find his footing amid the track's vaporous bump. His verse isn't so bad that it derails things—four tracks in and the EP’s mood is too established to be upended by one miscalculated verse—but his flow is too hurried, too frantic. He's doing too much, racing against the music instead of making it work for him. 6lack’s great instinct is knowing when to do a little less, and on 6pc Hot it pays off sublimely. He no longer sounds like a replacement-level R&B singer. He's starting to sound like a master. Catch up every Saturday with 10 of our best-reviewed albums of the week.

EarthSeed,Nicole MitchellLisa E.

Found on her mother’s bookshelf when Mitchell was a teenager, Butler’s work “[was] equally fascinating and disturbing to me,” the composer told one interviewer. An African American woman who was the first science-fiction writer to be awarded a MacArthur Fellowship, Butler tackled ecology, theology, racism, corporate greed, violence, empathy, and more in her novels and short stories. Works such as The EarthSeed Series could be apocalyptic and optimistic at once. The same dichotomy figures into Mitchell’s own compositions, which can seduce, challenge, and unnerve in the span of a few measures. Butler’s example has stayed with Mitchell, a former chair of Chicago’s vaunted jazz collective the Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians, in her own large-scale works. Soon after Butler’s death in 2006, Mitchell premiered her ambitious Xenogenesis Suite, scored for nonet and based on Butler’s trilogy of the same name, and she drew on the author’s writing again for 2014’s Intergalactic Beings. Mitchell returns to Butler’s work once more—specifically, the 1993 novel Parable of the Sower and its sequel, 1998’s Parable of the Talents—with EarthSeed, a collaborative performance with the singer, composer, and multi-instrumentalist Lisa E. Harris. The two women bonded over Butler at the New Quorum Composers’ Residency in New Orleans, and the Art Institute of Chicago commissioned the work for performance on June 22, 2017, Butler’s birthday. Mitchell and Harris collaborated on new lyrics based on concepts in the Parables, in which climate change has ravaged the planet. Arranged for a septet featuring Chicago luminaries like cellist Tomeka Reid and trumpeter Ben LaMar Gay, in conjunction with Harris’ theremin and Mitchell’s flute, EarthSeed tends towards that “disturbing” nature of Butler’s work, blurring the line between the present moment and an imaginary dystopian future. At times visceral and discordant, even agitating, the piece favors turbulence and accentuates the queasy timbres of its instruments. Drawing on the fusion of improvisation and composition that marks the works of the AACM and Art Ensemble of Chicago (a long-lived collective that counts Reid and Mitchell as current participants), EarthSeed’s music is challenging and bracing, often deploying an array of small sounds that confront and befuddle. Opener “Evernascence / Evanescence” features Mitchell’s spare flute and Harris’ wordless exhales and whistles—a rare instance of the main participants in duet, and a brief oasis before the others enter. When the full ensembles emerge on “Whispering Flame,” Reid’s bowed cello and Gay’s queasy tones act as destabilizing forces. As Harris harmonizes with another vocalist, Julian Otis, her operatic training comes to the fore. But before you can be seduced by their interplay, it sours. Otis and Harris wring out guttural gasps and wretching noises, Gay’s muted trumpet screeches, and Reid’s cello strings squeak like sawed wood. In “Moving Mirror,” which highlights Reid’s quicksilver work, her cello serves as bass, melodic lead, and frightening noise generator, veering between bow and pizzicato. She can be nuanced and hushed one moment, skin-prickling the next, accompanied by a battery of electronics from Mitchell, Harris, and Gay. “Whole Black Collision” juxtaposes white-noise rumbles with Harris’ sustained notes. She scales higher and higher until she’s at a piercing register where Gay’s shrill horn joins in. And the heights she hits on the climactic “Purify Me With the Power to Self Transform” are dizzying and awe-inspiring. EarthSeed’s sometimes bewildering array of disassociated texts, ululations, and rhetorical questions (“If you become ‘other’ then who becomes the mirror?”) all play into notions of disturbance and disruption from Butler’s writing, but on record, it discomfits. The babbling and vocal noises that introduce “Phallus and Chalice” turn enervating after four very long minutes, wince-inducing rather than whimsical. In “Biotic Seeds,” which draws inspiration from Parable of the Sower’s theory of life force, their voices veer from exaggerated dramatic enunciation to matter-of-fact recitation, the accompaniment reduced to mere punctuation: “Crisis is our teacher. What is its message? Embrace crisis. Lean into chaos!” The same philosophy could be said to guide EarthSeed: The album itself often feels as uncomfortable as the chaotic world depicted in Butler’s books.

Ungodly Hour,Chloe x Halle,by: Alphonse Pierre,Staff Writer ,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5efa5f50dc55f46b46323eb1/1:1/w_160/Ungodly%20Hour_Chloe%20x%20Halle.jpg,2020-07-02 05:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/chloe-x-halle-ungodly-hour/,ParkwoodColumbia,"In the two years since Chloe x Halle released their lighthearted coming-of-age debut The Kids Are Alright, the Bailey sisters have kept busy. They starred in three seasons of the sitcom Grown-ish, snagged two Grammy nominations, opened for JAY-Z and Beyoncé’s joint tour, sang at the Super Bowl—oh, and Halle was cast as Princess Ariel in Disney’s upcoming live-action The Little Mermaid. In whatever free time they had, the Atlanta duo also managed to write, perform, and contribute production for their second album, Ungodly Hour. Just the normal course of life for a 22- and 20-year-old, right? But Chloe x Halle also want to curse and talk about sex and make drunk mistakes and deal with the aftermath of unsolicited dick pics. They want to be somewhat normal twenty-somethings, in other words, a feat that seemed impossible on their debut album, where they were protecting their squeaky-clean images. But now they’re over that: “It’s four o’clock/You sendin’ me too many pictures of your…(oh),” the duo sing with a Destiny’s Child-invoking rhythm on “Busy Boy,” every line delivered with an audible smirk. But this isn’t the album equivalent of former teen stars making scandalous headlines; Chloe x Halle shed their innocence with grace, as they do with everything else. Frequently the sharpest Chloe x Halle songs are the ones where the sisters are the most hands-on. “Baby Girl” immediately jumps out, with danceable and warm Chloe production reminiscent of a Kelela album. On “Tipsy,” Chloe’s pulsing instrumental elevates the duo seamlessly weaving between rapping and singing, a moment that should make their mentor, Beyoncé, proud. Even when everything isn’t clicking, Chloe x Halle’s presence is enough to bring a track to life. The Mike WiLL Made-It-produced and Swae Lee-assisted “Catch Up” sounds like a pop song produced via algorithm, redeemed only by their sweet harmonizing. “Wonder What She Thinks of Me” is nearly brought down by Disney-musical-soundtrack vocals, but the the production (provided by both sisters) and colorful songwriting saves it—the lyrics sound like a dramatized version of  conversations had in a stressful relationship: “I wonder what she thinks of me/When you’re coming home/I know that she smells my perfume under your cologne.” But if “Wonder What She Thinks of Me” is a rare moment where Chloe x Halle could’ve used more direction, typically their decisions go well: They flip a sleek and sexy Scott Storch rhythm into a night-out anthem on “Do It” and deliver sugar-coated melodies over a blissful Disclosure groove on “Ungodly Hour.” Their riskiest songwriting pans out, too: “You must got me fucked up/You must got me fucked up/I think I had enough,” they wail on “Forgive Me,” potentially alienating some of their fanbase. Though most should understand that Chloe x Halle aren’t just television characters or former YouTube stars or proteges of the world’s biggest pop icon, but real grown women with layers, flaws, and emotions. With Ungodly Hour, Chloe x Halle take a quick moment to reflect on that growth, before they ultimately return to their grind. Catch up every Saturday with 10 of our best-reviewed albums of the week.

Flight Tower EP,Dirty Projectors,by: Will Gottsegen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5efa6113dc55f46b46323eb4/1:1/w_160/Flight%20Tower%20EP_Dirty%20Projectors.jpg,2020-07-02 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/dirty-projectors-flight-tower-ep/,Domino,"Dirty Projectors has always been a balancing act—an experiment in counterweights, and the calibrated chaos that results from tipping the scales. Frontman Dave Longstreth deals in reds and blues, innocence and experience, assembling strange geometries from the building blocks of the pop idiom. But what’s remarkable about Flight Tower, the second of five planned EPs from a reinvigorated Dirty Projectors, is just how stable it feels. Across four tracks, Longstreth and his collaborators grasp at defined boundaries and solid forms, drawing on the freed-up sensibility of 2018’s Lamp Lit Prose to present long-held affectations with renewed immediacy. With three new members now officially in the lineup—Maia Friedman, Felicia Douglass, and Kristin Slipp, all accomplished solo musicians with their own projects—Dirty Projectors are a group effort for the first time since the early 2010s. Their harmonies swirl, punctuate, and hang in the air. Where Windows Open, the first of the five EPs, featured Friedman on lead vocals, Flight Tower centers Douglass (Slipp will steer the third and Longstreth the fourth, with “everyone trading verses” on the fifth). The Dirty Projectors catalog is full of flashy vocal performances and declarative multi-part harmonies, but Douglass’ voice runs cooler and subtler, its smoothness an antidote Dave Longstreth’s ceaselessly complicated arrangements. Under her aegis, the music breathes. At just over 10 minutes, the EP is short enough that its appeal is mainly textural; these are isolated glimpses of a larger sequence, vignettes that point to something more fully formed. But Flight Tower is assured enough to evoke its own themes: songs about wonder and change, the peculiar magic of involving yourself in another person and of involving that person in you. Even at their most unmoored, they’re always gesturing toward connection. The loose, jittery “Lose Your Love” recalls “Cool Your Heart,” the Dirty Projectors highlight co-written with Solange, though the palette here is softer, and hews closer to R&B. A relatively traditional verse-chorus structure anchors the track’s lovestruck, free-associative lyrics. “Inner World” takes a similar tack to more fraught emotional territory, smoldering over keyboards and wind-up clicks. “Where is it taking me?/I can only know/After the tides recede/And we are free to grow,” coos Douglass, yielding to the ebb and flow of certainty. Though it’s freighted with apprehension, its titular refrain feels like a refuge. The second half of Flight Tower is more self-consciously experimental and ambiguous, leaning harder on glitchy, splintered surfaces; the emphasis is on the fact of feeling, rather than its precise expression. On the propulsive “Empty Vessel,” Douglass carves out another moment of psychic and aesthetic respite. “We’re facing forward/Or/With our eyes closed/We are dreaming/Of the coast,” she sings, syllables shadowed by warped, echoing fragments of memory. As on Windows Open, the band eschews ten dollar words—those “grayscale conjurers” and “lifelike perjurers”—in favor of simpler confessions. The effect is mesmeric and, in spite of its fussy architecture, newly grounded. “Self Design” explores that tension with more overt digital tricks, teasing a sample of Ravel’s Miroirs before lapsing into staggered, recursive melodies. Meaning slips, but puns persist: “What’s your love but/Safe design? Self design.” Douglass’ pronunciation renders “safe” and “self” identical. There’s a line in Thomas Pynchon’s The Crying of Lot 49 about a “high magic to low puns,” the secret power of the false familiar. It was there in Bitte Orca’s “Two Doves,” as Angel Deradoorian collapsed “feather” and “failure” into a single, mystifying hybrid word. And it’s here, too, channeled through a new set of musicians. As the world folds in on itself and language fails, these songs hold fast to what’s real, to conventions and people we can be sure of. It’s no coincidence that “inner world” sounds so much like “in a world…,” a kind of call to imagination; Flight Tower is an invitation to complete the thought.

Our Two Skins,Gordi,by: Hannah Jocelyn,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5efa6398a9d0807aa5684222/1:1/w_160/Our%20Two%20Skins_Gordi.jpg,2020-07-02 05:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/gordi-our-two-skins/,Jagjaguwar,"Sophie Payten needed a break. In 2017, while still deep in medical exams, she released her debut album Reservoir under the stage name Gordi and fell for another woman virtually at once, right as Australia was landing on a verdict for same-sex marriage. A tumultuous year like that can induce burnout and numbness as easily as it can energize. Payten camped out in her home of Canowindra with two engineers from the first album’s sessions (Bon Iver co-producers Zach Hanson and Chris Messina) for a month of recording. The focus on intimacy makes Our Two Skins a stronger record than her first, with a clearer voice. Payten and her co-producers recorded with only a handful of instruments, and compared to Reservoir, the results are much cleaner. Opener “Aeroplane Bathroom” is a piano ballad stark enough to hold its own against modern classics “Liability” and “Cellophane,” with raw emotion in place of Lorde’s wordplay or FKA twigs’ ethereality. Written in 20 minutes, Payten literally situated in the 24-inch confines of a plane lavatory, “Bathroom” is a different kind of panic attack than the usual heaving-through-a-paper-bag depiction—more a shutdown from sensory overload. The rest of the album is similarly intimate, and while “Unready” and “Sandwiches” have brighter alternate mixes (John Congleton helms a version of “Unready” with the crunch of modern alt-pop), even those feel more organic than the several sample packs’ worth of layering that characterized Reservoir’s production. The lyrics prove the most thrilling development, using earthy imagery to convey human emotions (“a flooding rain and endless wave/and the warmth of our two skins,” an early single titled “Volcanic,” “harvesting the sorrow of this land”). These songs depict feelings too vast for lyrics to convey, to the point where not even nature can contain them. The careful arrangements set Payten further apart: Influence Justin Vernon would put dozens of saxophones over the piano accelerando that closes “Volcanic,” but this song tops out at a brushed drum kit and a handful of sound effects. “Free Association” even closes with a slide guitar solo that hints at a move into alt-country. Payten’s writing is strong enough that she pulls off worthwhile takes on familiar themes. A straightforward love song like “Extraordinary Life” could be cloying on its own, but the whimsical verses are just the right amount of verbose, sounding smart instead of smug (“A wave refracted a divergence underneath/Toward directions that took gravity away from me”). “Life,” which works as a contrast to the more insular songs on the album, feels especially resonant now, nearly tragic—at some point in the future, her partner will get the life she deserves, but an extraordinary life is just not accessible right now. Any song that alludes to loneliness could feel accidentally prescient during a pandemic, but being queer can already feel so isolating that the theme resonates no matter what is going on in the outside world. Her lyrics only falter when Payten sounds aware of her audience, becoming self-consciously clever: “My irrationality is like a nationality” threatens to kill “Hate the World” as soon as it starts. The neat rhymes and simplistic couplets often create a fascinating tension with the more complex subjects (that’s how “Aeroplane Bathroom” gets away with a “stranger/danger” rhyme), but a line like “There is something/There’s not nothing” on “Look Like You” undersells rather than understates an examination of queer representation. Our Two Skins is not quite an outright celebration of authenticity and discovering yourself—if that was intended, the anxiety of “Aeroplane Bathroom” wouldn’t loom so heavily over the record. Is living “authentically,” as the phrase goes, worth the daily indignities that come with being different? There is no calm in that storm, and nothing worth romanticizing. Skins doesn’t try: Payten finds beauty anyway, never ignoring her fears, but remembering why the fear is worth braving at all. Catch up every Saturday with 10 of our best-reviewed albums of the week.

Red Cross EP / Phaseshifter / Show World,Redd Kross,by: Robert Ham,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5efb6a55ca5f171c3b770bd9/1:1/w_160/Red%20Cross%20EP_Red%20Kross.jpg,2020-07-02 05:00:00,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/redd-kross-red-cross-ep-phaseshifter-show-world/,Merge,"In a 1993 feature on his band Redd Kross, singer/bassist Steve McDonald bemoaned the fate of the group he started with his older brother Jeff in the late 1970s. “We’ve always been ahead of our time,” he told Entertainment Weekly. “We make records, and five years later another band has success with the sounds we’d already done.” At the time, that probably felt like the case, as some of the band’s most vocal fans, like Stone Temple Pilots’ Scott Weiland, were scoring multi-platinum sales by applying the same formula—’70s glam meets underground rock—that Redd Kross nailed on their second full-length, 1987’s Neurotica. But listening to the work that Redd Kross did in the ’90s, the truth is much simpler. That’s particularly true of Phaseshifter and Show World, the two fine albums they cut for Mercury Records that were recently reissued on vinyl by Third Man Records. To paraphrase a song by Brian Wilson, another songwriter that hailed from the McDonalds’ hometown of Hawthorne, California, Redd Kross weren’t made for that time. They have always looked and sounded like a throwback to a bygone era of rock, no matter what the calendar said at the time. That wasn’t always the case. When the McDonald brothers started making music together, they were caught up in the swell of punk rock, cadging rides from their folks to see X and the Dickies, and making a three-chord racket in their garage. They were enterprising enough to look up the phone numbers belonging to members of their favorite groups and bug them for a shot. Only one band took the bait, and before they knew it Red Cross, as they were known at the time, had their first gig opening up for Black Flag. Steve was all of 12 years old. This is the period captured in another Redd Kross reissue: an expanded edition on Merge Records, their current label, of the group’s 1980 debut EP. The vinyl/CD re-release adds on a handful of demos and a live track recorded at the former Baptist church where Black Flag rehearsed. It’s capped off by some fantastic photos of the fresh-faced group—which at the time included Greg Hetson (Circle Jerks, Bad Religion) on guitar and early Flag vocalist Ron Reyes on drums—in all their precocious glory. Heard some four decades on, the cookie-cutter punk of Red Cross sounds downright adorable. All six songs are wobbly and sloppy and fast—only two tracks are over a minute long—but played with undeniable enthusiasm. True to their tender age, the McDonalds sing silly screeds about spoiled rich kids, jocks, and cover bands. The brothers’ punk inclinations on this EP masked their fondness for pop. Lyrical gripes about Kiss and the Knack in “Cover Band” belied the truth that the McDonalds were actually big fans of both, and the titles of “Annette’s Got the Hits” and “Fun With Connie,” the overblown live track that closes this reissue, are references to ’60s pop icons Annette Funicello and Connie Francis. Fast forward just a few years and the veil would be completely removed. The McDonalds and their bandmates played up their influences, dressing in loud thrift-store duds and recording covers of the Partridge Family, Bowie, and Charles Manson. By the ’90s, Redd Kross were nowhere nearer the top of the charts, despite some valiant efforts and a lot of expense on behalf of their labels (Atlantic Records supposedly spent nearly $200,000 to promote 1990’s Third Eye). But a new deal with Mercury held some promise for the group, as did the cultural shift fomented by grunge. What came out of it, though, were two albums hampered by strange decisions and indifference from their label. Although Phaseshifter was produced by the band—at this point a quintet including keyboardist Gere Fennelly, guitarist Eddie Kurdziel, and future soundtrack guru Brian Reitzell on drums—the thick, brawny sound of the record owes everything to John Agnello, who recorded and mixed the sessions. Perhaps an attempt to apply some hard-rock spunk to their power pop, in the vein of Andy Wallace’s work on Nevermind, the unfortunate results turn hip-swingers like “Jimmy’s Fantasy” and “Visionary” into headbangers and almost entirely bury Fennelly’s contributions. When Agnello releases his grip, the album is a blast, with “Lady in the Front Row” and “Ms. Lady Evans” evoking the luscious camp of the Sweet, and “Pay For Love,” a tune co-written by Jeff’s wife, Charlotte Caffey of the Go-Go’s, revealing the thick, sugary zip of a milkshake beneath the power chords and Kurdziel’s yowling solo. With the help of Mercury’s full-court promotional press (a spot on The Tonight Show, tours with Stone Temple Pilots and the Lemonheads), Phaseshifter was supposed to turn Redd Kross into a sensation, and when it failed to achieve liftoff, the label barely moved a finger for its follow up. The added shame of it is that 1997’s Show World is a little gem of an album. The group found a far more complementary collaborator with co-producer Chris Shaw, who, the year before, had helped Fountains of Wayne achieve power-pop grandeur. Show World plays like a tour through Redd Kross’ record collection. Explosive acid rocker “Teen Competition” closes side A only to be followed by the ’60s Britpop homage “Follow the Leader” on the flip. The sweaty ballad “Secret Life” gets nestled between “Ugly Town,” which imagines the Righteous Brothers coated in distortion, and the glammy spark of “Vanity Mirror.” In contrast to its often muddy predecessor, the production here feels crisp and colorful, with plenty of open air for Kurdziel’s sharp-toothed and surprising solos to take flight. Following some perfunctory efforts to promote the album, including a tour with the Presidents of the United States of America, Redd Kross went into a holding pattern for the better part of a decade. In 1999, Kurdziel died from what was reported to be an apparent drug overdose. The McDonalds stayed busy, producing other bands’ work, and Steve found gigs playing bass with Sparks and punk supergroup OFF!  But as artists like Ty Segall and Thee Oh Sees started to find success mining a similar sound, Redd Kross were coaxed out of hibernation in 2006. Since then, they have steadily picked up momentum, playing numerous live shows and releasing 2012’s Researching the Blues and 2019’s Beyond the Door on Merge. Between those new recordings and this recent spate of reissues—which includes 2018’s Record Store Day re-release of Third Eye and repressings of early efforts by the McDonalds on Merge—the world is finally catching up with Redd Kross. Hearing the cheeky ebullience of the first EP and the candied pop sheen of the group’s ’90s work confirms that, even as they sat alongside the biggest names in underground rock, the McDonalds never fit with the trends of the moment. But it’s not so much the case that they were ahead of their time, as Steve McDonald asserted in 1993; for decades, they’ve existed outside it entirely.

Inlet,Hum,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5efa1a358813ffa92664ea03/1:1/w_160/%20Inlet_Hum.jpg,2020-07-01 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/hum-inlet/,Earth Analog,"Rumors of a fifth Hum album have been circulating since 2016, and there’s some poetry in its surprise drop coinciding with the 20th-anniversary celebration of Deftones’ White Pony, this century’s most influential vision for heavy melodic rock and something that wouldn’t exist without Hum. In the past decade, an entire galaxy of bands equally indebted to shoegaze, emo and alt-rock has emerged from the niche Hum occupied in their heyday—seen as intimidating older brothers by fellow bands on the upstart Polyvinyl label in their home base of Champaign-Urbana, overshadowed and unfairly likened to upstate neighbors/tour mates Smashing Pumpkins. Yet, Inlet doesn’t indicate a band awaiting a hero’s welcome or trying to connect with the world at large. Rather, the massive album presents an invitation to block out everything in existence and ponder the enormity of the universe. Hum’s wanderlust for inner odysseys was evident in the titles of their two major-label albums: You’d Prefer an Astronaut, Downward is Heavenward. Inlet doesn’t evoke the same playful adventurousness; its heavily fortified exteriors are more reflective of their standoffish relationship with media attention; a decade before it soundtracked a Cadillac commercial, the modest success of “Stars” allowed Hum to terrorize the Howard Stern Show with glass-shattering volume and confound Matt Pinfield by wearing chicken suits on 120 Minutes. “Step Into You” is the only thing here that could possibly give Hum a second chance at the mainstream success they tried their hardest to avoid—mostly because it’s the only thing here less than five minutes, though the cyclical, deadpan melody, head-nodding midtempo groove and hair gel-slick guitar solo could’ve shared space on the alt-rock dial next to Collective Soul. Hum’s legacy has largely been stewarded by acolytes like Greet Death, Narrow Head, and the Talbott-produced Cloakroom, all of whom have embraced their more funereal aspects and ignored their commercial flirtations. In that light, Inlet is essentially fan service. Talbott’s rhythm guitar, moves with the velocity of a mudslide or molten lava, while Tim Lash’s textured leads evoke water and air, replicating an algae bloom in “Waves” or a slow-motion geyser on the chorus of “Shapeshifter.” And the riffs—the riffs!—are Black Sabbath-slow and simple, like Hum really spent 22 years stockpiling and eliminating anything that couldn’t withstand at least six minutes of repetition or maintain its melodic thrust at the slowest possible tempos. There are no strings, no Hum 2.0 electronic upgrades, not even post-rock crescendos — in fact, “Folding” does the opposite, stopping midway to bathe in beatless, infinite sustain. Half of the songs here are longer than eight minutes, so the “prog” tag they acquired from Downward is Heavenward will probably stick. It would’ve been enough if Hum had simply picked up where they left off, but Inlet pulls off something far more difficult—it could pass for the work of a band influenced by Hum, taking them in a more minimalist, esoteric direction: post-hardcore guitars played at stoner metal tempos. Throughout the ’90s, Talbott grew increasingly inscrutable—if his lyrics had remained as legible as they were on “Stars,” Hum might have dealt with greater visibility. But for whatever reason—perhaps the threat of fluke success has faded, or age has eroded their contrarian defense mechanisms—Inlet is Hum’s most emotionally accessible album. Placed unexpectedly high and clear in the mix, Talbott’s vocals function as a lighthouse beacon for anyone trying to navigate the dark, misty and forbidding path surrounding it. While the song titles here are much less florid than, say, “Isle of the Cheetah” or “An Afternoon with the Axolotls,” they’re every bit as evocative, saying exactly what Hum are going to do before they do it. “Cloud City” creates an unforeseen nexus between Helmet and Ride, a monument suspended in air, and of course, Hum nails the sonics of “Waves.” More importantly, the guitars align with Talbott’s evocation of memory’s painful onset—“the dying landscape meets the water/and the waves of you roll over me again.” Hum are just as committed to the theme of “Shapeshifter,” with Talbott going on a Phil Elverum-esque naturalist tangent, imagining himself as a fawn and a bird soaring, “to heights unimagined, 'til loneliness turned back its hold.” As with the comeback albums from Sleep, Slowdive, My Bloody Valentine and American Football, Inlet is inherently decadent—four people taking two decades to create about 50 minutes of outrageously luxurious guitars. But Hum has little interest in making an event out of their return, declining to do any press or even provide lyrics. The newfound clarity of their sound allows Inlet to answer any questions that it might raise, a world unto itself: after spanning the depths of the ocean, the expanse of the desert and the breadth of the sky, “Shapeshifter” returns to where Inlet began—“Suddenly me just here back on the land/Reaching for you and finding your hand.” This isn’t escapism, but a meditative retreat—give it an hour of your time and return to the material world more grounded than ever.","The inscrutable shoegaze legends return with a towering reunion album, their first in 22 years. Unexpectedly, it is their most emotionally accessible music yet.

ISS005 / ISS006,Skee Mask,by: Philip Sherburne,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5efb7f74464fe661509aadc3/1:1/w_160/ISS005_Skee%20Mask.jpg,2020-07-01 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/skee-mask-iss005-iss006/,Ilian Tape,"Skee Mask’s music thrives on the friction between opposing impulses. The German producer fuels storming club rhythms with jungle breaks, distorted kicks, and whip-cracking electro syncopations, then swathes them in wispy atmospheric tones, soft as baby’s breath. The end product is a dramatic pairing of force and aura, like an earthmover haloed in dust clouds and rays of sunlight, or an iceberg cleaving in slow motion, throwing off huge plumes of frozen debris. The balance of those two impulses may shift from track to track—Skee Mask’s EPs lean harder on muscular club cuts, while his albums allow him to stretch out and explore more ethereal zones—but rarely does the needle tip all the way to one extreme or the other; the dichotomy remains fundamental to almost everything he does. With a pair of new EPs, however, Skee Mask (aka Munich’s Bryan Müller) splits his work down the middle. ISS005 is reserved strictly for big, bruising club tracks, while ISS006 trades the drums for pure, beatless ambient. (ISS is short for “Ilian Skee Series,” Müller’s own imprint under his hometown’s Ilian Tape label; as is frequently the case with his EPs, the titles are the same as the catalog numbers.) The drily functionalist tags make the contents appear to be mere DJ tools; the outsized sounds inside protest mightily at such a condescending description. Spinning off club tackle and sofa stuffing into two separate divisions might seem like an unremarkable strategy, but in Skee Mask’s case, it’s productive: Taken together, the two EPs suggest an artist uninterested in lingering in his comfort zone. ISS005’s five tracks showcase rugged club rhythms that go for the jugular. Like “RZZ” on last October’s ISS004, the opening “IT Danza” casts a glance back at decade-old dubstep: Insistent congas tumble forward at 140 BPM, while dub sirens and murky deejay chat suggest a fever dream of dancehall reggae. Just over hallway through, Müller lets rip a sample of jazz saxophone that he flips into careening runs reminiscent of Rimsky-Korsakov’s “Flight of the Bumblebee”—if, say, the Russian composer had been plagued by murder hornets. The next two tracks take up ISS004’s grime investigations, collectively marking a new frontier in sheer ugliness for the German producer. “Meal” thrashes like a poisoned beast, with garbled bass throbbing unsteadily beneath shrieking cuica and the occasional spray of bullets. Even more disorienting, “Reefer Madness” is just drums and snarling bass, but the beat feels inside out. The pulse doesn’t land on the downbeat, leaving you perpetually off balance; it’s like standing on the windy edge of a precipice. The EP finishes off with an attention-deficit drum tool and some razor-sharp electro. The nuts-and-bolts cuts are still a hoot: all killer, no filigree. In the past, Müller’s softer instincts often tended toward sentimentality, but there’s nothing pretty about the six ambient tracks that constitute ISS006. “Dolby” opens the EP with chugging dub-delay feedback, before a bright tone rises like a rocket through smog, illuminating a vast expanse of featureless ground below: faint synth pads, rumbling bass, the ghost of a chord change. It sounds like William Basinski’s The Disintegration Loops run through a battered rave soundsystem on a ruined planet—an elegy that has outlasted its mourners. “Frogsplash (Reshape),” on the other hand, marks the record’s emotional apex: Faint chords with an almost guitar-like feel cycle back and forth, like the memory of a love song turning to dust at the bottom of a dry well. The next three tracks turn more indistinct. Their movements are slow and unpredictable, with muted synths or string-like textures that twist aimlessly. The blissfully numb “Henk (Version Whatever)” is particularly lovely; its deep, subdued drones would make the perfect accompaniment to a documentary on the ocean’s cold, dark abyssal zone, where dead organic matter falls like ghostly snow and the bioluminescent lures of anglerfish bob in the blackness. But if this stretch is abstract to the point of emotionlessness, “Mbass123 Excerpt” is deeply expressive, with forlorn synths tracing sad, graceful curlicues against an inky backdrop. It amounts to a powerful highlight of the whole diptych. Skee Mask has always expertly sequenced his albums, using pacing and contrasts not just to set a mood but to tell stories, tales full of twists and turns, climaxes and denouements. With ISS005 and ISS006, he arrives at a fork in the road, and the plot thickens.","A pair of new EPs splits the German producer’s work down the middle: ISS005 is reserved strictly for big, bruising club tracks, while ISS006 trades the drums for pure, beatless ambient.

Country Westerns,Country Westerns,by: Allison Hussey,"Associate Staff Writer, News",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5efa1f6aca5f171c3b770b51/1:1/w_160/Country%20Westerns_Country%20Westerns.jpg,2020-07-01 05:00:00,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/country-westerns-country-westerns/,Fat Possum,"Almost everything that gets romanticized about crowded basement rock shows feels like a nightmare in a pandemic: sweating bodies pressed together, shouts, whoops, and spittle all trapped under a low-slung ceiling. Country Westerns were made for such an environment. Blending world-weariness into rambunctious, twangy rock, they’re a bar band for an era marked by a painful lack of both bars and bands. Despite the bum hand, though, they overthrow pessimism and head straight for a jolt to summon high spirits out of bedeviled circumstances. Guitarist and singer Joel Plunkett made his name alongside acts like Gentleman Jesse and The Weight, while drummer Brian Kotzur counted himself among the revolving Silver Jews personnel. (David Berman was the sole witness to some of the earliest proto-Country Westerns rehearsals.) They recruited bassist Sabrina Rush from State Champion, and her melody-focused lines round out their energetic sound with a sense of groove. Country Westerns called upon Matt Sweeney, who has brought his brawny guitar style to Run the Jewels, Bonnie “Prince” Billy, and the cult-favorite chooglers Endless Boogie, to produce. With his abiding love of great riffs, he’s a natural fit, ensuring that the band’s crackling solos emerge in complement to their restless chugging. The band coasts between good-natured rowdiness, road-dog grit, and ascetic wisdom, projecting the kind of personality that might be good company for a beer or six on the porch. Plunkett weighs getting “caught losing on a lousy day” against his own obligation to keep picking himself up again with “It’s On Me,” his guitar solo shaking loose any sense of deep regret. It’s bittersweet but tentatively positive, with Plunkett promising to “take an extra step or two” to avoid repeating past mistakes. On songs like “Gentle Soul,” “It’s Not Easy,” and “Times to Tunnels,” they keep things relatively subdued, but the trio are at their best when they’re hitting the gas. “Time don’t heal the way it used to,” Plunkett acknowledges in his weathered voice on “I’m Not Ready,” as Rush and Kotzur settle into a hum to launch his guitar vamp. It’s in moments like these that the band’s chemistry explodes, bottling the sort of energy that can only ever be fully experienced live. The album’s final track, a cover of The Magnetic Fields’ “Two Characters in Search of a Country Song,” makes for a tidy closing argument for the trio’s strengths. The lyrics draw on genre signifiers like Jesse James, 18-wheelers, and Calamity Jane to sketch a doomed relationship, while the guitars convey pained resolve. Country Westerns touch on at familiar frameworks without clinging too hard to the specifics. Their debut feels ragged in all the right places, a testament from a band that shoulders the weight of disappointment, lost years, and heartbreak without allowing it to become a burden. Correction: A previous version of this review did not mention that “Two Characters in Search of a Country Song” is a cover of a Magnetic Fields song. It has been updated to clarify this.","This world-weary garage-rock trio’s music is tailor-made for a pre-pandemic era of basement shows.

You’re a Crusher / drocan!,Dan Drohan,by: Dave Segal,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5efb87e3464fe661509aadc8/1:1/w_160/You're%20a%20Crusher%20:%20drocan!_Dan%20Drohan.jpg,2020-07-01 05:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/dan-drohan-youre-a-crusher-drocan/,DROMAN,"A scan through Dan Drohan’s Bandcamp page reveals a musician restlessly tinkering with the molecular structure of composition. The Massachusetts-based drummer and producer’s forays into exploratory electronic composition with real-time drums mostly defy classification. Maybe these attempts to create new forms of beauty and intrigue in sound could be called “organic cyborg music.” Amid all the weirdness in his latest album You’re a Crusher / drocan! is a pop record struggling to emerge from the wires. Slivers of melody shoot through the cacophony, but they quickly become subsumed in the pile-up of disjointed rhythms and melted-plastic textures. This perpetual battle gives the album’s its essential friction. You’re a Crusher / drocan! is divided into two segments, the first ostensibly experimental and the second nominally pop. But to call drocan! “pop” is like calling the idea of death a nuisance. Created with multi-instrumentalist Mike Cantor, the poppier section that comprises the second half of the record indulges in fun-house-mirrored studio wizardry. “The Garden” evokes Cornelius’ 1997 album Fantasma, but on much stronger and stranger drugs, its angelic vocals reverbed into a choir of anomie. “Passwords” sounds like a brutalist version of Japanese city pop, with Drohan pounding out kettledrum thunder. “Through the Night” purveys cherubic Panda Bear vibes, but is much less cloying. As diverting as drocan! is, it’s the first half, You’re a Crusher, that delivers the real fireworks. “Leave it Loading” rides rickety, uptempo beats and a wonky, foghorn-like bassline akin to Hugh Hopper’s in early Soft Machine over decaying yet vibrant keyboard dabs. This alien, warehouse-pop aura splits the difference between Swell Maps and This Heat. “You’re a Crusher” serves as the bridge to drocan!, filtering Animal Collective’s awry-mushroom-trip inversion of the Beach Boys through Black Dice’s warp-everything-to-the-max mulcher. “CUPOFDRO” comes across as a modern American take on Autechre’s bafflingly complex IDM puzzles. The cumulative effect of this rampant sonic distortion is a cheerful kind of madness. Drohan creates his own bizarre universe out of a mix of organic and synthetic elements, and then arrays the parts in often breathtakingly original ways. He may not be reinventing the wheel, but he is retrofitting it with some spectacular rims.","The Massachusetts-based drummer and producer buries pop music in experimental chaos using studio wizardry and a deft compositional touch.

KiCk i,Arca,by: Chal Ravens,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5efa1273a9d0807aa5684217/1:1/w_160/KiCK%20i_Arca.jpg,2020-06-30 05:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/arca-kick-i/,XL,"In the overlapping spheres of pop and electronic music—spaces long populated by queer artists moving beyond narrow preconceptions of gender identity—Arca has become one of the most visible figures exploring what it means to transition in public. On KiCk i, the first in a proposed series of four albums, she navigates the spaces in between worlds, languages, genres, and genders. Where her previous releases often felt rooted in melancholy and discomfort, emotions that spilled forth as operatic vocals on 2017’s Arca, KiCk i radiates with self-possessed joy. It contains her most accessible music to date, scooping up her glitchy, slippery textures and chiseling them into hard definition. It’s pop, it’s avant-garde. It’s both and it’s neither. Opening track “Nonbinary” presents Alejandra Ghersi at her most direct and pop-primed. She’s fierce, self-possessed, in it for the thrill: “I don’t give a fuck what you think/You don’t know me—you might owe me,” she purrs, tasting every syllable. Over clanging pipework and videogame machine guns, she acts out the perverse thrill of doing whatever you want and knowing that someone hates you for it: “What a treat it is to be nonbinary, ma chérie, tee-hee-hee—bitch!” With each track, Arca applies a different costume—a different skin, even—moving through effervescent electro pop on “Time,” which could be the beginning of a Robyn ballad, and into experimental club rhythms, steamy torch songs, and her own ragged, industrial take on the reggaetón that she encountered as a kid in Caracas. On “KLK,” she and co-producer Cardopusher add extra ballast to a pounding reggaetón production with the growl of the furruco bass drum, a Venezuelan folk instrument that Ghersi learned at school. Elsewhere, the electronic sounds feel familiar enough from the abstract universe of Arca—noises that have no real-world index, but make you think of stuff like latex and metal, volcanic rocks and collapsing buildings—but each element has been sharpened and accentuated. More than on previous records, Arca bends her voice into multiple shapes and characters. The operatic mode we’ve heard from her before returns on the romantic closer, “No Queda Nada,” and “Calor,” a shuddering love song for her partner: “Eres el dueño de todo mi ser” (“You’re the owner of my whole being”). On “Mequetrefe,” the bashed-up skeleton of a reggaetón rhythm offers an unstable base for her processed voice, which crumbles into metal shards as she imagines herself as a head-turning woman on the hunt for her man: “Ella no toma taxi/Que la vean/Que la vean en las calles” (“She doesn’t take a taxi/Let them see her/Let them see her on the streets”). “Rip the Slit” is also fueled by a combination of shredded reggaetón and treated vocals, this time pitched up to helium-femme proportions. In addition to Arca’s voices, three guest singers appear, while SOPHIE lends production and voice on “La Chíqui.” Shygirl casts a cold glance over “Watch,” dismissing the night’s options in a world-weary Londoner’s monotone: “No feelings, no exclusive.” It doesn’t take much to flip Rosalía’s flamenco tones into something approaching sheer glossolalia, and on “KLK” the bare-bones lyrics are simply a way to generate sound through the Catalan singer’s quivering soprano as she repeats short, scrappy phrases: “Qué es lo que tú crees?” (“What do you think it is?”) and “Bendecida, bendecida” (“Blessed, blessed”). Lacking much of a hook (save for a loop of the Dominican slang phrase “Que lo que”), “KLK” feels more like a studio experiment than a pop song, despite the A-list guest singer. Perhaps that’s the point. Björk appears, singing in Spanish, on “Afterwards,” underscoring the extent to which KiCk i is inspired by the Icelandic musician’s ’90s albums, from the sound—cutting-edge club music combined with pop-facing vocals—to the cyborg cover art, which would surely get the nod from Homogenic art director Alexander McQueen. What Björk once brought to the table, though, was songwriting—image-rich, personal, laden with memorable hooks and emotional landscapes. “Afterwards” has a touch of that (the lyrics, lines from a poem by Spanish modernist Antonio Machado, are about a dream where “golden bees” make honey “inside my heart”) but the duet slips away like sand between their fingers, never settling on a distinct melody; the song feels restless and unresolved. The lack of proper songs, for want of a better term, is a mystery. There have never been so many lyrics on an Arca album before, yet, “Nonbinary” aside, they’re mainly used as textural elements rather than vehicles for ideas or stories. This is a shame, as Arca is known for the sharpness and wit she wields in two languages—another duality unpacked on KiCk i, as she flips between English and Spanish. In a recent interview, she made the point that language is prone to “glitches,” misunderstandings that arise when people disagree on the meaning of a given word. “You can have two people arguing about identity politics and gender,” she said, “screaming at each other with both of their faces red, thinking that they’re right.” But the inevitable “glitch” is to be welcomed as a kind of productive dissonance, she added, “because it favors a life that is more unexpected, vibrant and full of possibility. Who doesn’t want that?” Arca’s music has always incorporated various kinds of glitches, conceptual as much as technological, making electronic ruptures and spasms into her signature sound. Perhaps the same suspicion that meaning is never fixed or certain helps to explain Ghersi’s treatment of voices throughout, as they flicker like radio static, failing to communicate. That will be disappointing for those who were expecting a star-studded pop-crossover album on a par with her guests’ best work. Still, compared to the rest of Arca’s catalogue—including the forbidding twists and turns of @@@@@, the hour-long mixtape from earlier this year—KiCk i marks not only a giant leap towards a bigger audience, but one taken on her own terms. As she put it in another interview, KiCk i can also be heard as a rallying cry, inviting listeners “to recognize the fact that there’s an alien inside of each of us.” She sets her own inner alien free on the album cover and in other recent images, where she appears almost naked, strapped into prosthetic claws and stilts, or six-breasted, attached to inscrutable devices—a being of her own creation, beyond traditional binaries, part human and part machine. Using the camera and her body to reinvent herself for our (and her) pleasure, Arca joins a long line of musical chameleons. The emancipatory promise of Arca’s project—a world beyond binaries, categories, and convention itself—remains thrilling, even when her tottering steps don’t quite reach that wished-for horizon. Correction: A previous version of this review implied that Björk wrote the lyrics to “Afterwards.” It is been updated to reflect the lyrics were written by the poet Antonio Machado.","On the first album of a four-part series, the Venezuelan-born, Barcelona-based artist offers her most accessible music to date, channeling her signature sounds into sharply focused avant-pop.

Everything’s Strange Here,G-Eazy,by: Dani Blum ,Contributor ,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5efa13a4ca5f171c3b770ac3/1:1/w_160/Everything%E2%80%99s%20Strange%20Here_G-Eazy.jpg,2020-06-30 05:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/g-eazy-everythings-strange-here/,RCA,"G-Eazy named his last album after an F. Scott Fitzgerald novel, to suggest he’s tortured and well-read; he used one of its songs to rap about flushing condoms down the toilet, to suggest that his sexual partners plot to steal his semen. Throughout his decade-long career, the Oakland artist has sought to differentiate himself among white frat rappers by clinging to a self-serious, hamfisted darkness. He brags about parties, then wheezes that they’re killing him. He wallows in the gilded hallmarks of celebrity, usually finding a way to also complain about his exes. It’s a boring schtick. In quarantine, G-Eazy has had “the fortunate opportunity to self-reflect, grow and evolve,” as he wrote on Instagram. He’s covered David Bowie, Bob Dylan, and the xx; he’s been learning piano over FaceTime. On his new album, Everything’s Strange Here, we’re meant to hear a radically different Gerald Earl Gillum, one who’s mostly abandoned rap in favor of singing. More often, though, he just finds new ways to telegraph the same stories he’s told all along. Everything’s Strange Here oozes melodrama to the point of parody. It opens with a cover of a Beck song used in Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, and progresses to crawling ballads about coke baggies with “trouble packed inside.” “Life is suffering, oh yes, I know,” G-Eazy wails on “Every Night of the Year,” a five-minute exercise in clumsy writing (“About me/They’ll reminisce”) and gnarled, synth-bathed guitar. “My mind is in a fight against the time that I have left,” he rasps on “Nostalgia Cycle.” G-Eazy isn’t a terrible singer, though the effects-heavy production seems to purposefully obscure his voice. And even though these are still soggy odes to crushed pills and the dangers of anonymous sex, they’re exponentially more interesting than his usual material. Out of this mush of hotboxed platitudes and theatrical existentialism emerges one of the best songs G-Eazy’s ever made. “Free Porn Cheap Drugs” isn’t profound or even particularly pleasant—his voice is a nasally scratch—but it condenses all the faux noir and dilute sadness into one stark, impactful statement. “Desensitize and just let go,” he sings. “No bright screens, no place to go.” It sounds like acceptance, a rare plea for emotional connection that doesn’t arrive tucked between brags. This is the G-Eazy who could be a genuinely intriguing artist: contemplative and remorseful, but not morose. Unfortunately, maybe inevitably, the album swings back into claustrophobic pettiness. After nine tracks without any rapping, the final song begins with a classic G-Eazy grunt, followed by the announcement, “Talking about my crazy-ass ex.” It descends into a twitchy, bitter rant about a “selfish” ex-girlfriend, but the character is so common in G-Eazy’s music that the specifics are almost irrelevant. Even in this new, softer soundscape, he paints women as spiteful and conniving. “You turned me into a monster,” he moans on “Back to What You Knew.” “You keep acting like you’re perfect, but the smile that you wear is too fake,” he complains on “In the Middle.” Words like these pierce the album’s gloss, breaking the illusion that, at age 31, G-Eazy has shifted and grown. Everything’s Strange Here winds up sounding like another caricature of the women he can’t stop condemning: shiny and novel at first, but ultimately corrosive.","The Oakland rapper’s quarantine album is meant to portray a radically different artist. More often, he just finds new ways to telegraph the same stories he’s told all along.

New Grass,Albert Ayler,by: Fred Thomas,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5efa1711f3cd35af1ec2e697/1:1/w_160/New%20Grass_Albert%20Ayler.jpg,2020-06-30 05:00:00,Jazz,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/albert-ayler-new-grass/,Third Man,"No one could have predicted Albert Ayler’s turn to pop. The tenor saxophonist emerged in the mid-’60s as one of the most visceral forces of the free-jazz movement, with raw, chaotic compositions that jumbled expressions of joy and mourning until they were indistinguishable. Ayler’s respected standing in avant-garde circles made the abrupt stylistic shift of his 1969 album New Grass all the more baffling. Instead of the structureless squall he was known for, here was Ayler singing lead on AM-radio pop songs and superimposing his unhinged sax skronk over funk, soul, and rock rhythms. Freshly remastered and reissued by Third Man in its first vinyl pressing in over 40 years, the wildly mismatched colors of New Grass still don’t resemble anything else. Ayler had signed on with highly visible jazz imprint Impulse! in 1966 at the behest of their star player John Coltrane. New Grass would be his third release with the label and the first without his brother and trumpet player Donald Ayler. Donald’s limited but eruptive playing had been integral in his brother’s music finding its highest form, but the lifestyle of the struggling jazz musician pushed him to his brink. He stopped playing in Ayler’s band shortly before suffering a mental collapse. Around the same time, Ayler had begun a relationship with Mary Parks, a poet and singer who went by the alias Mary Maria. Parks sang on New Grass, and her flower-power poetry provided the lyrics. Some familiar sidemen were on board (Bill Folwell switching from upright bass to electric and keyboardist Call Cobbs reprising the gossamer harpsichord he’d brought to Ayler’s free-floating Love Cry the year before), but the personnel consisted mostly of session musicians. Lockstep drumming, overdubbed horn sections, and back-up singers all nudged the sound towards the kind of schmaltz the music industry was churning out in the late ‘60s. As if to ease listeners in, the album begins with a high-energy saxophone and bass improvisation that leads to a spoken message from Ayler. In a mystical ramble somewhere between a prayer and a warning, he offers the hesitant disclaimer “I hope you will like this record.” On transcendent concert documents like Bells and In Greenwich Village, Ayler’s free jazz was messy and volatile, with a drive so supernatural it barely seemed possible the music was made by earthly beings. His new songs were messy in a way that was unnervingly human; jittery, flailing, and striking out in several bizarre directions at once. The melodic signatures were the same—simple, friendly lines that evoked New Orleans funeral marches or children’s songs—but Ayler’s vibrating tone hovered in a separate orbit from his band’s standardized grooves. More jarring than the ill-fitting arrangements were Ayler’s prominently featured vocals. Unlike the wordless incantations he’d occasionally included on earlier albums, here he was leading songs with a bellowing, untrained voice that was wavering at its most controlled. The sung introduction to “New Ghosts” (a reworking of “Ghosts,” a tune Ayler recorded multiple variations of) devolves line by line into unintelligible blabbering. Park’s lyrics were mostly vague hippie platitudes, and Ayler delivered them in a manic wail that clashed with their gentle sentiments of peace, love, and progress. The material was recorded over the course of just two days and the performances are rushed. Raved-up workouts like “New Generation” and “Everybody’s Movin’” whizz by at hyperactive tempos, the players scrambling to keep up. Ayler often stops singing mid-verse to jump into long-winded free solos, squealing euphorically as the band chugs along on autopilot behind him. “Heart Love” is the best example of the disjointed sweetness that carries New Grass, with cooing backing vocals and playful sing-song melodies gelling tenderly before Ayler blasts into a sax freakout that burns on for the majority of the song. This certainly wasn’t jazz of any kind, but was too overstimulated and confused to pass for the Woodstock-generation rock’n’roll it was trying to emulate. What was this? The harshest reviews decimated the record, calling out the new direction as a blatant appeal to white, mainstream audiences. But if this was an attempt at selling out, it was poorly conceived. Ayler’s new sound ignored the smooth, danceable soul The Isley Brothers and Marvin Gaye were topping the charts with at the time and looked more towards the jumpy gospel and R&B of the early ‘50s and the electric blues styles he’d played while touring with Little Walter in his younger days.Compared to the riotous funk of Sly and the Family Stone or the sleek, boundary-testing fusion Miles Davis was beginning to explore around the same time, New Grass seemed uptight and a little old-fashioned. Factoring in warbly singing and discordant sax solos, it’s hard to imagine even the most out-there record exec hearing commercial potential in this strange little record. The album’s fragile balance of excitement and anxiety speaks to the unstable place Ayler was in during the last few years of his life. Riddled with guilt about pulling his brother into a world that broke him and exhausted from years of grinding in poverty and obscurity, he grew increasingly erratic and isolated. Some friends reported calls with Ayler in which he deliriously explained visions he’d had while staring into the sun. The rest of his recorded output would consist of unfocused experiments that reflected a troubled inner world, and in late 1970 he would be found dead at age 34, in mysterious circumstances presumed by many to be suicide. New Grass signaled the beginning of a descent into darkness for Ayler, one that saw him grasping at ideals of redemption and healing all the way down. Ayler’s 1964 debut My Name Is Albert Ayler also begins with a spoken message, one that wanders for a while before ending with the soft declaration “One day everything will be as it should be.” He would spend the rest of his life expanding on that thesis, with every phase of his music returning to themes of suffering and confusion ultimately giving way to peace. Ayler’s spiritual message didn’t change on New Grass, but grew weirder and more intimate as he struggled to deliver it in a way that could be universally understood. Similar to Arthur Russell’s hermetic dance tracks or Muddy Waters’ surreal stabs at psychedelic rock on Electric Mud, Ayler’s notion of popular music was so distanced from reality that it became its own self-contained universe.","The tenor saxophonist’s beguiling and divisive 1969 album attempted to cross-wire free jazz with rock, funk, and soul. It remains his most misunderstood record.

Sing the Snow Away: The Chunklet Years,Honey Radar,by: Marc Masters,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5ef9f6ce464fe661509aabcf/1:1/w_160/Honey%20Radar%20-%20Sing%20the%20Snow%20Away.jpg,2020-06-30 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/honey-radar-sing-the-snow-away-the-chunklet-years/,Chunklet World Industries,"Jason Henn makes hooks. In the 14 years since he started Honey Radar, the group’s only constant—besides Henn himself—has been catchy tunes. He has a seemingly unlimited ability to spin an ear-worming riff, add a simple beat, and sing some clever phrases along with it. Those kinds of skills should make Honey Radar work best as a singles act: Grab any two tracks from their catalog and you’ve got a ready-made 45 that would sound great in any diner’s jukebox. But Honey Radar albums and EPs sound pretty great too. Like prolific songwriters Billy Childish and Robert Pollard, Henn is so creative that his tunes grab you no matter how many you hear, or in what order. Sing the Snow Away, a sparkling compilation of the 7"" records Honey Radar made for Athens, Georgia, label Chunklet, is as cohesive and addictive as any of the group’s three full-length LPs. It might even be better: Henn has given Chunklet some of his most memorable material, and hearing all of it together adds extra adrenaline. What makes the songs on Sing the Snow Away memorable is Henn’s knack for creating a classic, where-have-I-heard-this-before aura while adding idiosyncratic accents. He’s well versed in rock history: He got his first record, a Monkees album, when he was five, and his parents steered him strongly toward the Beatles (in order to keep him away from the Rolling Stones). All of those groups echo in Henn’s curved guitar lines—one of the album’s best cuts, “Telephone Betty’s Aneurysm,” sounds torn straight from Revolver—as do contemporaries such as Sic Alps and Ty Segall. Henn isn’t afraid of his influences: He covers the Monkees on Sing the Snow Away, and his peculiar choice—an obscure tune heard only on a 1969 TV special—shows the depth of his fandom. But who you hear in Honey Radar is less important than how Henn tweaks that legacy. Much of his musical character comes out in lo-fi production values: crinkly, distorted sounds born of cheap mics and tape hiss. This anti-polish gives each track a charmingly casual, sketch-like feel, as if Henn worked out his ideas immediately after hitting the record button. But that’s deceptive: Play anything from Sing the Snow Away on repeat and you’ll soon hear how sharply structured and fully formed it actually is. That’s especially clear when you focus on Henn’s words. Sung in a stoic, fading voice that contrasts the music’s rough energy, his lyrics can at first sound like footnotes. But eventually his twists of phrase reveal themselves to be surprisingly funny and surreal. During “Kangaroo’s Court,” over loping acoustic and electric guitars, he whispers, “Butlers hemming a navy coat/A patchwork of dull kazoos/Laughing and tapping an oily mark/A jungle gym of fragrant tattoos.” Sometimes his wordplay evokes nursery rhymes: In “Fan the Earthworm,” Henn depicts a worm whose laughs blow smoke, while “United Fox” introduces a mythical fox who “gave us the greatest sounds around.” And some of his mysterious images hint at bigger ideas. On “Medium Mary Todd,” Henn’s protagonist seems to embody the mercurial nature of creativity: “The songbird missed his prom/Look as he strolls by everything/He’s off and he is on.” None of these intriguing verses would have the same impact without Henn’s ample supply of musical hooks. Melodies are his creative currency, and on Sing the Snow Away he spares no expense when it comes to doling out memorable themes. In lesser hands, such reliance on riffs might pound the material into a thin, dull roar. Instead, the deftness of Henn’s writing makes Honey Radar’s music grow more nuanced with every listen.","A collection of catchy, lo-fi 7""s on Athens’ Chunklet shows off the Philadelphia musician Jason Henn’s bedroom-pop prowess and surreal, often funny songwriting.

What’s Your Pleasure?,Jessie Ware,by: Owen Myers ,Contributor ,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5ef619d08813ffa92664e83d/1:1/w_160/What%E2%80%99s%20Your%20Pleasure?_Jessie%20Ware.jpg,2020-06-29 05:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/jessie-ware-whats-your-pleasure/,PMRFriends Keep SecretsInterscope,"On her new album, Jessie Ware sounds like the host of the kind of party you heard about in ‘70s Manhattan—velvet banquettes and powdery surfaces, mink coats and cigarette holders, and club names that were enigmatic numbers, or—post-gay liberation and pre-AIDS—sincerely promised sanctuary, paradise. You can imagine Ware taking a scene newcomer under her wing, detailing the venue’s clandestine corners, advising which watered-down liquor to avoid—and anyway, don’t you deserve champagne? Disco has been a shared obsession of late for both chart juggernauts and Ware’s own peers, but her reverence for the era may be the most literal, down to her flash-lit portrait on the album cover, the spitting image of Warhol’s iconic polaroid of Bianca Jagger. Here, Ware is a lycanthropic party girl, coming alive under the mirrorball with breathy flirtations over disco-funk and vibrant Hi-NRG, recreated deftly by chief producer James Ford. Her wonderland is, to quote Fran Leibowitz’s one-time description of Studio 54, made for “sex and dancing.” (Ware says as much of the record herself.) Over the Italo disco daydream of a title track, Ware presents a dessert trolley of options for, ahem, “dancing sideways.” “Come on now push/Press/More/Less,” she sighs over neon-streaked synths.“Step Into My Life,” co-produced by Ford and Kindness, is a masterclass of orchestral funk, with Ware insisting “I don’t wanna talk, no conversation.” “Save A Kiss,” an outlier, extends the album’s palette to kinetic electropop, which Ware’s voice floods with romantic yearning. In a recent interview, Ware described What’s Your Pleasure? as a celebration of her flourishing confidence. It has less of the soul-searching of Ware’s previous album Glasshouse, yet zooms in on a lighter facet of her personality, and is threaded with a camp sense of humor that reflects disco’s frivolity as well as the cheekiness that is all over Ware’s Table Manners podcast but has been largely missing from her recorded music. Her airy vocals feel like secrets whispered, confidences offered, recalling Diana Ross’s supple quiver over Nile Rogers and Bernard Edwards’ beats and, in “Mirage (Don’t Stop),” coming close to Donna Summer’s orgasmic rapture. The strutting chorus of “Read My Lips” doubles down on the song’s oral innuendo with kissy sound effects, bringing to mind Anita Ward’s disco classic “Ring My Bell.” The rubberized bass jam “Ooh La La” is a riot of saucy ad libs and tooting car horns, and the frothy, Jellybean-esque “Soul Control” centers on the delightful frippery “We touch and it feels like: Woo!” It is a joy to hear Ware sounding so relaxed. Disco music never liked to consider what happens when the music stops, but Ware allows a little of her signature psychodrama to creep into the nocturnal escapades she describes, and the flecks of ennui make the highs even higher. Over the darkly pulsing synths of “In Your Eyes,” Ware is racked with insecurities. “Would you follow me, with no guarantee?” she asks, before allowing herself a rare belting vocal. “Adore You,” produced by Metronomy’s Joseph Mount, commits what on paper might seem like a cardinal sin: it Auto-Tunes Ware’s pristine voice to a robotic murmur, the kind that could soundtrack a lonely android searching the cosmos. But her intonations (“Lean in...move slow”; “don’t go”) reshape the song’s mood with every syllable, in a nuance that makes the smallest shifts feel seismic. The critic Douglas Crimp had a name—“boogie intimacy”—for the particular frisson you have while dancing with a stranger. “It’s usually limited to dancing together for a while before you each dissolve back into the crowd,” he wrote. That attitude seems to have galvanized Ware, too, on an album where she sounds bolder, looser — and frankly, more fun — than she has in a near-decade. “Last night we danced/And I thought you were saving my life,” she sings in “Mirage (Don’t Stop),” an evocation of communal movement as well as a mantra for the artistic rejuvenation that Ware finds in the groove. Her delivery is exquisite and carefree, suggesting an earned wisdom that a kiss is just a kiss, a touch is just a touch, and next Saturday night probably has more of both in store.

The Shadows and the Light,Quin Kirchner,by: Jonathan Williger,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5ef620dc8813ffa92664e873/1:1/w_160/The%20Shadows%20and%20the%20Light_Quin%20Kirchner.jpg,2020-06-29 05:00:00,Jazz,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/quin-kirchner-the-shadows-and-the-light/,Astral Spirits,"Drummer Quin Kirchner revels in contrasts and juxtapositions. These qualities are deeply embedded in the music of his new album, The Shadows and the Light,  which jumps between numerous strains of exploratory jazz with an impressive fluency. There are many playful moments, as well as passages of mystery and melancholy, and it unfolds with an ease that suggests an eager journey through disparate terrains. The album’s wild stylistic range squashes time while giving the illusion of being infinite in scope. Kirchner acts as both instigator and agitator as he slides into an elastic swing or propels his group through the whirling syncopation of Afro-Cuban rhythms. Regardless of style, his playing always feels fluid, constantly in flux. That sense of flow is crucial to the structure of The Shadows and the Light. Several pieces cascade into one another while others are punctuated by transitory percussive palate-cleansers. At the album’s center are two suites, both of which establish an air of formless drift before coalescing into groove and motion. “Pathways” plays out against a backdrop of a kalimba fed through delay, with bassist Matt Ulery channeling Charlie Haden for a solo of contemplative modal runs up and down his instrument before being joined by Nate Lepine’s searching flute. As the metallic chime of the kalimba loops, the piece seamlessly transforms into a version of Kelan Phil Cohran’s “Sahara,” its ostinato bass line passed around the ensemble as Kirchner dances around his kit. Similarly, “Star Cluster,” a gooey mess of sax, trombone, and bass clarinet, morphs into “Moon Vision,” a steady, backbeat-heavy piece with lush horn hits. For an album that travels in so many directions at once, these moments provide a cohesion that points to a definitive arc. Though Kirchner cut his teeth in New Orleans and spent time in New York, he grew up in Chicago and the majority of his career has been centered around that city’s multi-faceted, ever-evolving jazz scene. He sits comfortably alongside contemporaries like Damon Locks, Jeff Parker, and Ben Lamar Gay, as well as labelmates Chicago Underground Quartet and Charles Rumback. What sets Kirchner’s music apart from that of his peers is his focus on incorporating the music and ideas of the iconic forebears of that community into his own individualistic style. In addition to Cohran, his group covers Sun Ra’s late-’50s composition “Planet Earth,” and his use of a more fleshed out horn section—at times ballooning to an octet—allows him to approximate the kind of large-ensemble cosmic swing that defined that early Ra era, with additional touches of Charles Mingus’ outré arrangements for big band shining through. Though deep debts are owed to those mid-century jazz touchpoints, Kirchner puts various traditions into conversation with each other in a way that feels postmodern, almost collaged, rooting the music firmly in the now. Throughout The Shadows and the Light there’s a sense that anything could happen next—a drum and electronics free for all, a poignant ballad, fusion infused with free improvisation, a polyrhythmic blur of Latin percussion and wurlitzer—but nothing feels out of place. Kirchner’s compositions are built around tight grooves but flourish in moments of spontaneity and uninhibited fervency. A big part of this is due to his band, which features alto player Nick Mazzarella and bass clarinetist Jason Stein of Hearts & Minds, among others from the Chicago jazz underground. They are nimble ensemble players, but also powerful improvisers on their own, capable of wild melodic tangents and expressive outbursts, and Kirchner’s compositions demand full command of both of these modes. The Shadows and The Light, along with recent albums by Makaya McCraven, Junius Paul, Dustin Laurenzi, and Tomeka Reid, serve to document a true renaissance in Chicago jazz and improvisation. More than just an overview of different experimental idioms, Kirchner is able to rewrite the rules of a wide swath of traditions in his own language, drawing on the grammar of ever-shifting groove and dynamic rhythmic interplay as the basis for his interpretations. There is equal parts joy and reverence in this music, and while listening to Kirchner rejoice in those passions it is hard not to experience them as well.","The outstanding Chicago-based drummer incorporates ideas from the city’s iconic forebears and ever-evolving jazz scene into his own fluid style.

How can I,박혜진 Park Hye Jin,by: Ben Cardew,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5ef602de464fe661509aa86d/1:1/w_160/Park%20Hye%20Jin%20-%20How%20can%20I.jpg,2020-06-29 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/park-hye-jin-how-can-i/,Ninja Tune,"박혜진 Park Hye Jin’s previous solo release, the 2018 EP IF U WANT IT, was characterised by a dreamy electronic mood and laconic vocal style. So it’s a kick in the pants to hear the South Korean house DJ warning us to “shut the fuck up” over a sinister techno backing on “NO,” the fourth track on her new EP—like catching your grandmother cursing, or Daft Punk dabbling in hardcore. How can I is Park’s first release for Ninja Tune, the new label a sign of her blossoming status in the dance world. But far from playing it safe, Park uses the opportunity to expand her musical horizons: The EP’s six tracks touch variously upon juke, trap, house, and techno without ever committing to a genre. Pulling this all together is Park’s flat-but-flexible voice, which has a way of creating micro-melodies out of the smallest inflections. In the chorus of “Can you” Park adds a sing-song edge to the word “babe,” transforming a trite line (“Can you be my babe?”) into an infuriatingly catchy hook—half playground taunt, half declaration of intent. She later adds an impassioned “I fucking hate you,” the two phrases crashing into each other and throwing off narrative sparks. Park began experimenting with rapping and singing around 2015, two years before she turned to DJing. Yet her vocals on this EP, sung half in Korean and half in English, have more in common with the finite, hammer-headed style of juke than the expansive world of rap; her ultra-repetitive lyrics and sharp vocal hooks tend to ratchet off the beat like just another percussive sound. The production on “Can you,” the EP’s best track by a pinch, also nods toward juke, using the barrelling kick drums, skidding hats, and frantic BPMs pioneered by DJ Deeon and DJ Slugo in Chicago a quarter century ago. But Park subverts juke’s unyielding musical storm by adding hazy synth melodies to the mix, and the light-and-shade contrast between melody and beat echoes the battle between love and hate played out in the song’s lyrics. “How come” follows a similar route, its 172 BPM scramble, garbled vocal cutups, and nebulous chords suggesting the energetic elegance of a rave in a rose garden, while “NO” is straight-up nasty, with Park’s bullish vocal riding a metallic techno stomp. “Like this,” the EP’s opening track, is the only song that would have easily fit on IF U WANT IT, its house shuffle and feather-light chords serving as a dapper stylistic bridge to what has come before. At times it feels like Park is deliberately playing against her strengths as she confounds our expectations and forgoes the gorgeous indolence of IF U WANT IT. The repetitive nature of her vocals means there is little room to hide when the hooks don’t connect. The EP’s title track is horrible: A generic trap beat meets a slurred chorus that sounds about as melodious as a foghorn and inspires a mixture of mortification and distress. But a single misstep on an EP full of intriguing new paths does not a total failure make. How can I is not as thematically coherent or straight-up enjoyable as IF U WANT IT, but it is considerably more inspiring in its experimentation—a challenge, perhaps, to a house-music scene too happy in stasis.","On her second EP, the South Korean producer branches out from the house music of her debut, touching upon juke, trap, and techno while sing-rapping in a mixture of English and Korean.

A New Found Relaxation,James Krivchenia,by: Daniel Felsenthal,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5ef612c7ca5f171c3b770803/1:1/w_160/A%20New%20Found%20Relaxation_James%20Krivchenia.jpg,2020-06-29 05:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/james-krivchenia-a-new-found-relaxation/,self-released,"James Krivchenia’s second record under his own name, A New Found Relaxation, creates a sterile, imaginary world of spa days and mineral baths, and was largely recorded near the New Mexico town of Embudo. The community of approximately four hundred along the Rio Grande, where the Big Thief drummer lived for a year and a half, is not a wellness getaway by any means. But because Krivchenia melds his recordings with Muzak, spa radio, and clips designed to induce Autonomous Meridian Sensory Response (ASMR), A New Found Relaxation suggests a New Mexico healing experience that’s both IRL and online. The samples move quickly, spiking the ambience with appropriate doses of anxiety. Krivchenia recorded some of the album’s 500 fragments at home, while messing around online with his computer plugged into pedals and effects processors. His resulting patchwork of gurgling internet rips and field recordings is expertly arranged, which makes sense, considering Krivchenia’s pedigree as the recording engineer for Big Thief's debut Masterpiece and the most recent album by the underappreciated Mega Bog. He’s put out deconstructed dance music under the alias 1000000000s, and on 2018’s No Comment, he reworked body-camera audio of warfare and gun violence into a discomfiting collage. Like No Comment, A New Found Relaxation is a conceptual record. But while No Comment was full of doctored samples that bore little relation to their disturbing source material, the stems on A New Found Relaxation are evident underneath layers of loops. It’s drumless and fairly placid, in keeping with the new-age theme. Water predominates, and the song “Legendary Liquids” even shares a name with a hugely popular ASMR video. Yet instead of trying to elicit a euphoric, physiological response, Krivchenia undercuts the world of wellness with consistent drones. The stereo panning on “Loveless But Not Joyless,” for example, feels paranoid, as though a sedating video is playing in one ear while dissonant noise rumbles through the other. Talking ruins the sensory experience, as anyone who’s spent time exploring ASMR videos knows. Krivchenia’s soundscapes seem to mumble away like a nervous internal monologue. He certainly isn’t the first contemporary electronic musician to comment on ASMR’s spine-tingling sensations and the YouTube stars commited to provoking them. Composers like Holly Herndon and Kaitlyn Aurelia Smith have approached the phenomenon with eyes toward satire and reverence, respectively, while fetishizing the videos’ audiophile-grade sounds. The relative scrappiness of Krivchenia’s take centers the same source material around his life in New Mexico. Perhaps tellingly, he left the region for Los Angeles at the end of 2019. Listening to the album, it’s easy to imagine him jittery in Embudo, trying to stay calm and appreciate his surroundings. Feeling preoccupied in a remote location of natural beauty is a singularly disorienting experience. Is the problem with the area and its culture? Or is the problem with you? A New Found Relaxation never answers these questions, which makes it work as music, rather than wellness philosophy: Krivchenia passes us through all of the necessary, agitating trials of the self before we can breathe our first sigh of relief.","The Big Thief drummer excels at creating ambient worlds, and his second release under his own name evokes the spine-tingling sensations of ASMR as well as a persistent anxiety.

"Pure Moods, Vol. 1",Various Artists,by: Mina Tavakoli,Contributor,"https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5ef28712ca5f171c3b7705a9/1:1/w_160/Pure%20Moods,%20Vol.%201.jpg",2020-06-28 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/various-artists-pure-moods-vol-1/,Virgin,"On weekday mornings, sometime between 1 a.m and 5 a.m., lawless fantasia used to appear on television like a good recurring dream. Today, the rhapsodies are duller, stricter, and more subdued, but in the ’90s, they came in the form of ads for phone sex lines, softcore porn, and low-resolution infomercials that sold the mirage of a life fantastic to a woozy after-hours audience. The colors were always saturated, syrupy, rich as cream; the tones sedate, misty, and mostly libidinal. Whether bored, sleepy, incapacitated, or horny, this tribe—routinely or accidentally—was well acquainted with the call of Pure Moods. Unexpected, unbidden, and more or less unnecessary, Pure Moods is a piece woven with some wear into the silk of the popular unconsciousness. You may not remember hearing this work, but after watching the commercial, you might find yourself feeling that you’ve always known lines from its script. Swooning and naked in its pride, the 17-song compilation album, advertised in 60-second hallucinations disguised as infomercials, was a warm vat of music that we might today refer to loosely as “new age.” Its carefully selected tracklist—a mosaic made largely up of film or television scores, or trance remixes thereof—seemed engineered to induce a ridiculous sort of fugue state. For some, hearing the album might pang a Proustian memory of falling asleep on a familiar sofa. For others, it can suggest an intensely ambivalent mixture of pity and allure. Pure Moods’ essence is safe, formless, and mostly meaningless, like a piece of art hung in a bathroom. For me, and for many others, it felt like paradise. Before the shadow of Bezos, before the Zuck, before, even, the contemporary comedy provided for us by the insidiously dippy Elon Musk, there was Sir Richard Branson. In 1970, 22 years before he would publicly weep while selling his record label/airline/mobile-phone/space-tourism conglomerate, Virgin, for over a billion dollars, the rugged and floppy-haired Branson invented the mail-order model of record distribution out of the usual entrepreneurial cocktail of luck and generational wealth. Twenty and lordly, then-helming his small but pop-savvy lifestyle magazine, Student, he noticed the UK’s Retail Price Maintenance Agreement—which kept strict restrictions on the saleable cost of vinyl records—had been quietly lifted. Seizing the sword of opportunity, he quickly took to the back pages of his paper to be the first to offer a good bargain. “Name any record you want,” his ad read, “and we’ll sell it to you 10% to 25% cheaper than anyone else.” A business was born. Branson’s arbitrage paid off well in an unwittingly fertile market, functionally reconfiguring a luxury product into a more petty-bourgeois pleasure. High off the fumes of his boon, he assembled a team from his editorial staff, bought a manor, refurbished it into a recording studio, and christened the effort “Virgin” in honor of his fumbling inexperience in the music industry. It would become one of the largest and most powerful record agencies in the world. After the first ripe boils of the young label’s hardships had been lanced (Branson was noted for having “no musical taste whatsoever” until enlisting his avant-minded second cousin to arrange a roster of artists for him), Virgin enjoyed a mainstay on the tone and volume of music sales for many years. They held court, especially in the early ’70s, to a certain genre fit for the bookish, acid-dabbling Eurodude who read NME and dreamt of armfuls of warm Eurogirls who did the same. A river of German esoterica gave the label several releases by the psychotropic faerie proggers Faust (who were deftly marketed as “the German Beatles!”) and the rhinestoned scuzz of Tangerine Dream, but the pièce de résistance of Virgin’s inertia lay in a freaky slab of music by a shy 19-year-old composer named Mike Oldfield. That an album with a title and sound true to the phrase “Tubular Bells” could have eventually sent the world into a mania for two 20-some-minute, mostly repetitive instrumental opuses of glockenspiel and honest gibberish is testament to the strength of Virgin’s aspirational animus. After hearing the mesmeric and thoroughly uncommercial music Oldfield had designed in the wake of a disturbing LSD trip, Branson backed his production efforts in full at the Virgin manor. It was clear that the future mogul yearned to head the most influential label in an industry that he knew incredibly little about. What he did understand, however, was that there was a vested, collective, and profitable desire for music that made audiences feel like connoisseurs of a higher order. Cannily, Branson invited Britain’s leading tastemaker and radio host, John Peel, onto his houseboat for lunch, during which he played the entirety of Oldfield’s finished two-track, 49-minute Tubular Bells to the captive presenter. Miraculously, Peel adored the record and premiered it in full on his show. “One of the most impressive LPs I’ve ever had the chance to play on the radio,” he purred on his May 1973 transmission. Rolling Stone later called it “a debut performance of a kind we have no right to expect from anyone.” Tubular Bells would launch the Virgin empire by earning the label million-dollar financing from its investors, become the third-best-selling album of the ’70s in the UK, provide theme music for William Friedkin’s 1973 blockbuster, The Exorcist, and sell more than 15 million copies globally. Almost exactly 20 years later, Tubular Bells would lay at both the spiritual and literal centerfold of our Pure Moods. The full ad for the U.S. release of Pure Moods lives on in accurate fidelity on YouTube, but it would be a shame not to recollect it for you here. First, a call bursts from a black screen. A quick time-lapse of a sunrise fades into a husky, lusty voiceover (“Imagine…a world…where time drifts slowly...”), which lays cozily across a shot of an autumn mountaintop. At least a dozen vignettes ensue. A woman spins in a woven dress as a unicorn gallops into translucence. A faraway man walks through a fast-moving river. The unicorn reappears, newlyweds gaze and grope at one another before a soulful kiss, waves crash onto a dusky beach, a swarm of hummingbirds eject from a cloud—each image t-boned into one another in an effort to inspire a feeling of chaotic, seductive fantasy, soothing by way of arousal. First released as Moods - A Contemporary Soundtrack in the UK in 1991, the compilation was rebranded as Pure Moods upon reaching the U.S. in 1994. The slightly fatter American version contains songs that are as decadent and suggestive of Tolkienian lore and day spa imagery as the montage in the commercial, each composed by artists that, when written out, sound like a cast of villains and druids. There was Enya, Vangelis, the Orb, Enigma. Together, they formed a New Age Mount Rushmore, chiseled in lavender quartz. These were tracks and artists never designed to be played alongside one another, tracks and artists, for all intents and purposes, mostly foreign to one another except in essence. Their clunky but satisfying cohesion can be attributed to the cataloguing done by the Virgin heads, who arranged the piece on a lark, “stumbling into the project” as an experiment to determine if an album could be successfully telemarketed and sold far before its release date. The model, deemed “a huge buzz” after selling more than 2 million copies prior to its formal drop, would be replicated five times over with a tetralogy of sequels in the releases of Pure Moods II-IV. Later, it would fuel a variety of spinoff flavors, like Gregorian Moods, Christmas Moods and Tranquil Moods: The Ultimate New Age Collection. (I will freely offer that these should be sold as a box collection, titled, simply, “Mood Ring.”) No claims were made over precisely what sort of mood Pure Moods would put you in, but the album summoned a particular soul of Virgin’s experimental curios and left-field aberrations that signaled a certain taste, ease, and class of listener. It was something like a lifestyle brand touting self-care avant la lettre. Suitable for the essential-oiled and candlelit bath, the head shop, or for popping into the cassette deck of your Corolla on a summer’s night with the windows down and your children asleep in the backseat, Pure Moods arranged a prefab state that, for the listener, may have summoned a feeling they didn’t know they needed. Likewise, for Virgin, Pure Moods was something of a sample platter made in quiet tribute to the unexpected blessings in their own roster: the artists, tracks, and rogues that had clinched the success of the label in stupefying spades. At the spine of both the UK and U.S. versions of the album lives the baroque jangle of “Tubular Bells” (though excerpted from its original sprawl to a reduced-fat 4:58). Flanking “Bells” are tracks from Enigma, a louche and late-stage ’90s-era cousin of Oldfield’s success. “Sadeness (Part 1),” the first Enigma single, is a porny, breathy, breakbeaty song, with Gregorian chanting giving way to a French voice pining orgiastically for the 16th-century erotic writer, Marquis de Sade, atop a downy bed of trip-hop. It somehow defies both anarchy and order, any sense of convention, and the usual formula for anything resembling commercial success. Yet, beginning in 1990, it lived on the Billboard charts for five unbothered years, reached the Top 10 in several countries, and made Enigma the most successful act signed to Virgin at the time of its release. (Unintentionally, the Gregorian chanting endemic to the track created a global hunger for sacred Latin monophonic music: In 1994, an unrelated album titled Chant from three dozen Benedictine monks living in a Spanish monastery went double-platinum.) True to their title, Enigma remained heroically and consumingly atop the charts for the majority of the ’90s. “Return to Innocence”—whose indigenous Taiwanese vocalizations blast at the top of the commercial, responsible for waking thousands of half-asleep American citizens on couches—is a glamorous smoothie of pseudo-erotica, a treatise on nostalgia and self-help. Seemingly custom-made for the proto-Y2K fetish for exploring one’s attitude with slogans across graphic t-shirts, its first four lyrics are just words (“Love...devotion…..feeling….emotion”) both inspiring and completely drained of meaning, at once empty and rich. It enjoyed a No. 1 one position on the charts in over 10 countries. Non-Virgin releases on Pure Moods share the twin tenets of mild conceptual lunacy paired with baffling commercial success. There’s Enya’s immortal “Orinoco Flow (Sail Away),” which, upon its release, the Los Angeles Times scoffingly noted as part of an album filled with “nothing more than unusually windy New Age music.” “Orinoco Flow” is, in fact, an island archipelago of a song, with choral arrangements as lush and fabulous as the remote wonders it promises. It seems to give off its own aromatherapeutic odor and made Enya—a woman who does not tour, who never has toured, and whose perfectly inverse ratio of near-total reclusiveness and global omnipotence inspired an entire phenomenon known by business students the world over as “Enya-nomics”—one of the wealthiest and best-selling musicians alive today. There’s the four-minute throb of “Oxygène Part IV,” courtesy of one Jean-Michel Jarre, who once bore ownership of the Guinness World Record for hosting the world’s largest concert (3.5 million in Moscow, 1997). DJ Dado, an agent of chaos, remixed the theme from The X-Files into his “Dado Paranormal Activity Mix,” ascending an already astral, imminently whistleable piece of art into the Burning Man mesosphere of dream trance (a top 10 hit for weeks across Europe). Kenny G, the saxophonist known in most minds as the human incarnation of a scented candle, contributes a satiny number titled “Songbird,” a song that became the first instrumental to reach the top 5 of the Billboard Hot 100 since the “Miami Vice Theme” by Jan Hammer (who is also featured on Pure Moods). It’s no surprise that so many of these tracks were either born or retrofitted into movies and commercials. From Karl Jenkins’ “Adeimus” (now known as part of an indelible Delta Airlines spot), David Byrne’s “Main Title Theme from The Last Emperor” (self-explanatory) even to David A. Stewart and Candy Duffer’s silken, sax-laden “Lily Was Here” (of the 1989 Dutch film, De Kassière, later to become a mainstay of the Weather Channel “Local on the 8’s” music) these were spectral mood-pieces, if not tailored for, then entirely befitting of, calibrating emotion. When divorced from the screen, scores take on new life when soundtracking yours. But an album that capitalizes on tracks that would serve as well as closing-credits for a lovesick drama as they would in an airport bathroom does not, necessarily, a serious album make. Even without looking at the melty watercolor cover or hearing the title of the compilation, the songs summon the solace endowed by inspirational posters and cruise brochures that now feel bathetically out-of-touch: blue horizons freckled with soaring birds, pistachio mountaintops, forests of fluff and fungi, images of women with their hair thrown back in smiling rapture. Are these parodies of paradise, or can we see them in earnest? The commercial unhelpfully adds that the album is delivered “direct from Europe,” wherever or whatever that may be. If you, like I, have struggled manfully to crack the riddle of whether the album is glib, good, or good in its glibness, the idea of camp may be a sound starting point. As Susan Sontag details in her 58-point treatise from 1964, camp is work characterized by a sort of “seriousness that fails.” Or, a unique “spirit of extravagance [that] cannot be taken altogether seriously because it is ‘too much.’” That too-muchness—from the commercial’s art direction to its deliciously sleazy voice-over, promising that this album was specifically “for your way of life”—was enough for mine, and for hundreds of thousands of others. Pure Moods peaked at No. 10 on the Billboard chart the week of July 26th, 1997, the same week the Men in Black soundtrack secured first place. An inspired and perfect choice, then, that Pure Moods begins its downtempo descent with Angelo Badalamenti’s “Theme from Twin Peaks,” that totalizing Lynchian ballad of too-muchness. Regardless of whether your first encounter with the music was within the hundreds of scenes it was deployed in during the television series, in the later-lyricized Julee Cruise version, titled “Falling,” or, even, within Pure Moods, Badalamenti’s score from a show that—like the album—embodied mesmeric alternate realities, sentimental chintz, and a strangely narcotized, palliative hopefulness, sealed the work tightly with a sad, bassy kiss. For everything that Pure Moods is, one thing is certain: Pure Moods is not kidding. Pure Moods aimed to sell the awe and wonder of music’s ability to change you. It is work that is genuinely, and for better or worse, peddling you a vague miracle. It is quietly saying that you will feel good for having listened to it. Even if it reeks of patchouli and a joke now, it also reeks of something like purity. Even those most irony-poisoned among us can wrap ourselves around the fullness of Pure Moods as a pop object that’s completed its natural tour of meaning: a curio first taken in earnest, then as a joke, now as a museum fixture that holds both forces in its heart at once. It also illustrates the great life cycle of art’s journey through critical response—how spectacles are typically born as novelty, laid to rest as cliché, and resurrected as nostalgia. Watching the ad for Pure Moods today can impart a sort of joyous nihilism by laying bare the architecture of the more complicated—but no less fantasy-enabling—advertising so inherently part of our lives now. And, in an hour when everything feels alien and existence slippery, falling in love with Pure Moods’ lawless pageantry is worth any mild cognitive dissonance it suggests. “People who share this sensibility are not laughing at the thing,” goes Sontag, again. “They’re enjoying it...it is a tender feeling.” I grew up watching infomercials with the focus of an obsessive. Longform ones, like that of the especially good spot for the Magic Bullet blender (a full 30-minute, eight-actor orgy of disbelief), or that of the Xpress-Redi (in which two people praise a countertop griddle) were especially rich for their steeply-sloped story arcs, climaxing in money shots of satisfied men and women leading their lives with new, happy ease. These half-hour-long paeans to kitchen appliances were absurd moments of absolution; they worked like slow-acting pills against the usual symptoms of childhood melancholy. Their taglines and promises buried themselves inside me like hymns or worms. For the child who slept belly-down in front of a television nearly every night, exhausted by the glow of a screen, these moments felt like satisfying surrender to a particular sort of commercial rapture. And this is what Pure Moods inspires—rapturous, wild, ridiculous satisfaction, each song over-indexing on its unspoken bond to bring fantasy to an otherwise quotidian life. Like the seconds before losing consciousness, it re-created a floating, near-delirious state as image and song wrapped each other in a duvet of chloroform and melatonin. To so many, Pure Moods guaranteed a feeling so total, so rich, so sedative and decadent, that it approximated, then begat, real beauty. The miracle was the point. To see salvation suddenly offered to you—a proposal to make life easier, more fantastic, purer—was a bargain at $19.99, rush shipping notwithstanding.","Each Sunday, Pitchfork takes an in-depth look at a significant album from the past, and any record not in our archives is eligible.

She’s mentioned often on his wonderful and grief-stricken new album, Weight Of The World, after being the centerpiece of last year’s Tears of Joy, released not long after her passing. The 21-year-old MC is still very much battling the pain and confusion that comes with losing a parent, and he uses World to dig further into the fragmented memories of their past. It’s a raw and captivating glimpse of a young artist whose pen has grown sharper as his heart has grown heavier. MIKE presents that heaviness through a familiar lo-fi lens. He and his sLUms associates have developed a distinct vision by now, centered on samples that sound like they were downloaded over a dial-up connection. (MIKE produces 12 of the tracks here himself under his dj blackpower pseudonym.) They rap in methodical deadpan, no doubt inspired by the drawl of Madvillain-era DOOM (MIKE’s first-ever verse was written over the instrumental for “ALL CAPS”). The combination can be both mesmerizing and misleading, as it doesn’t necessarily alert the listener when something special occurs. But that’s why you’ll always be rewarded for listening closely to MIKE. On the self-produced “alert*”, he evokes his pain over a bare-bones piano riff: “Back then my diet was shrooms if it wasn’t herbal/And threw some violence towards the blues 'cause the wound eternal.”  Later, on “delicate,” he paints a childhood spent between London, Philly, and New York, rhyming, “We used to freeze up in the winter, the summers, we rose/From nights we used to sleep through dinner, and others we toked.” So much of World is centered around his family. His dad worries about his sadness and substance abuse (“Papa knows it’s doom I need to work through,” he says on “alert*”). Siblings and old friends are protectors who helped him navigate life on the street. “Brodie got the .30, only clean 'em with detergent,” he raps on “222,” adding “hope I never need the service.” Just a few lines later on the same song, he describes the moment his mother passed: “Walked her out the Earth, just me, a couple nurses.” He circles back to her departure often at the end of verses, sometimes sweetly, like how their laughs were the same. Other times, he just breaks your heart, as when he recalls her shouldering much of the family’s burden. “And you still grievin’ over moms,” he raps on “Weight of the Word,” like he’s being accused of being unable to let go.  “Nah, I’ll never forget,” he declares with pride in his voice. Amongst all the pain, MIKE’S confidence still seeps through in his artistic growth. “get rich quick scheme” may be one of the most immediate songs MIKE has ever released, with a crushingly fierce beat provided by the Chicago-bred producer and singer KeiyaA. And Earl Sweatshirt, the man who turned to MIKE and sLUms to craft the sound of his masterful third album, adds some star power to the project by finishing it off with a long, heady verse. On World you feel for MIKE, but you never quite worry for him. Even in sorrow, his voice grows stronger.","On his wonderful and grief-stricken new album, the Bronx rapper pays tribute to his late mother and proves that his voice grows stronger even in sorrow.

GREEN,Hiroshi Yoshimura,by: Philip Sherburne,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5ef27832a9d0807aa5683e8b/1:1/w_160/GREEN_Hiroshi%20Yoshimura.jpg,2020-06-27 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/hiroshi-yoshimura-green/,Light in the AtticWater Copy,"In 1967, the Canadian composer and philosopher R. Murray Schafer wrote, “The ear is always open.” He didn’t mean metaphorically: Unlike the lidded eye, the ear cannot close itself off to unwanted stimuli, leaving us particularly susceptible to intrusive sounds. Schafer’s observation turned up again in the liner notes to Hiroshi Yoshimura’s debut album, 1982’s Music for Nine Postcards, a contemplative ambient soundtrack composed for Tokyo’s Hara Museum of Contemporary Art. Echoing Schafer’s preoccupation with the rising volume of the industrialized world, Satoshi Ashikawa, whose Sound Process label first released Yoshimura’s album, wrote, “Presently, the levels of sound and music in the environment have clearly exceeded man’s capacity to assimilate them, and the audio ecosystem is beginning to fall apart.” Encouraging a “more conscious attitude” toward sound, he offered Yoshimura’s music—delicate Rhodes figures trailing pastel shadows, their spiraling as aimless as a slowly twisting mobile in a large, empty room—as a kind of palliative. Yoshimura, who died of cancer in 2003, was a polymath par excellence: composer, designer, historian. Most of his work existed in the overlap between sound, architecture, and everyday life, including installations and commissioned work for museums, hotels, runway shows, an aquarium, a sports stadium, the Tokyo and Kobe subway systems, and Osaka International Airport. Yoshimura’s activities made him one of the central figures of kankyō ongaku, or environmental music, a homegrown style that drew upon Erik Satie’s “furniture music” and Brian Eno’s ambient investigations, as well as centuries-old ritual traditions, to fashion a new kind of site-specific sound uniquely suited to Japan’s post-war economic boom. Yet listeners outside Japan remained largely ignorant of Yoshimura’s legacy until the past decade, when people like Spencer Doran, of the Portland, Oregon, duo Visible Cloaks, began advocating for his work. In 2017, Doran and Maxwell August Croy’s Empire of Signs label reissued Music for Nine Postcards, helping kick off what has become a broad revival of formerly obscure Japanese ambient and electronic music; Doran also curated Light in the Attic’s 2019 compilation Kankyō Ongaku: Japanese Ambient, Environmental & New Age Music 1980-1990. GREEN, originally released on Kazuo Uehara’s AIR Records in 1986, is not just a welcome addition to that retrospective catalog; a cult classic of growing acclaim (a YouTube upload of the album has been played more than two million times in just four years), it is crucial in fleshing out the portrait of a musician that many Westerners are only beginning to understand. Many of Yoshimura’s early releases were soundscapes designed to heighten listeners’ perceptions of the spaces around them. Music for Nine Postcards, written with the Hara Museum’s luminous interior in mind, was inspired by scenes glimpsed from the composer’s window—a kind of landscape drawing in sound, translating the movements of clouds and tree branches into simple, gestural motifs. In his notes to 1983’s Pier & Loft, the muted soundtrack to a fashion show held in a warehouse on the Tokyo Bay, Yoshimura wrote obliquely of nostalgic views of a disintegrating city. Cosmetics maker Shiseido commissioned 1984’s barely there A・I・R (Air in Resort) as the sonic complement to a fragrance, while 1986’s lulling Soundscape 1: Surround was distributed as the almost imperceptible soundtrack to a tastefully designed line of prefab homes. All of these recordings share certain sonic characteristics: They tend to be soft, unobtrusive, and meditative, dissolving like sugar on the tongue. But GREEN is different: lush and layered, with a sense of purpose that makes it unique in Yoshimura’s catalog. The shift in complexity is palpable from the very first track, “CREEK,” in which mallet-like arpeggios rise from a thrumming, struck-bamboo pulse like a flock of colorful birds bursting from the rushes. It feels more elaborate than Yoshimura’s previous work; it feels more musical, with a greater emphasis on harmonic surprise. This sense of movement ripples across the album, but it remains quietest at its center: The stretch of songs across “SLEEP, “GREEN,” “FEET,” and “STREET” reprises the abstracted mood of Music for Nine Postcards—an impression reinforced by the fact that “FEET” and “STREET” are essentially variations on a theme. Still, even at its most sedate, GREEN boasts an inviting array of timbres and textures. In one song, the gentle bite of an overdriven Rhodes keyboard jumps to the fore; in another, a buzzing FM bass tone bristles faintly. Yoshimura favors pentatonic scales and tends to avoid major or minor thirds, and as a result, GREEN often feels like an inviting frame in which to project your own feelings. Happy, sad, blue, agitated: It welcomes all comers, promises serene uplift when needed, and offers to sand the edge off any unwanted extremes. Curiously, all of GREEN’s song titles share an assonant ee sound. The titles were written in English on the original sleeve, along with a cryptic acrostic descending down the musical stave: “Garden River Echo Empty Nostalgia/Ground Rain Earth Environment Nature.” In the liner notes to the original release, Yoshimura wrote, “GREEN does not specifically refer to a color. I like the word for its phonetic quality, and song titles were chosen for their similar linguistic characteristics. I hope that this music will convey the comfortable scenery of the natural cycle known as GREEN.” By treating “green” as a phoneme, Yoshimura taps into the musicality of language, which lies beyond mere signification. However anyone else might hear this music, Yoshimura clearly believed his pieces belonged to the key of ee, and developed an evocative synesthetic world to accompany his mental images of that sound. If Satoshi Ashikawa saw Yoshimura’s work as a necessary corrective to the modern world’s persistent and worsening din, perhaps this is an opportune time to reconnect with the Japanese composer’s work. Numerous reports have detailed the ways that the world has quieted during the pandemic. With fewer cars on the road, seismologists can detect earthquakes from further away; even in the busiest cities, birdsong is once again audible. This pause opens up a space for Yoshimura’s music to fulfill its purpose: recalibrate our relationship with the sonic world around us. When GREEN was licensed to the American new-age label Sona Gaia for release on CD and cassette, the sounds of running water and birdsong were added, presumably as a selling point for the American market. Light in the Attic’s reissue restores the original edition, which, Doran says, is the version that Yoshimura preferred. Light in the Attic plans to reissue the adulterated “SFX Version” on streaming platforms this summer, alongside the original; eventually, you can compare for yourself. For a long time, the Sona Gaia version was the only one I knew. But in the past couple of months, I’ve been listening to the Light in the Attic reissue, sans nature sounds, while sitting outside on my porch, where the music mingles with the actual sounds of birds, neighbors’ voices, and the breeze through the trees, plus the occasional motorcycle revving rudely, a few blocks away. These sounds turn out to be the perfect complements for Yoshimura’s music, opening up its dimensions. The ear is always open, and all the world’s a stage.","The Japanese ambient pioneer’s well-deserved revival continues with a reissue of this 1986 cult classic, which feels like an inviting frame in which to project your own feelings.

Mordechai,Khruangbin,by: Andy Cush,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5ef2279b8813ffa92664e466/1:1/w_160/Mordechai_Khruangbin.jpg,2020-06-26 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/khruangbin-mordechai/,Dead OceansNight Time Stories Ltd.,"A little over a month ago, Khruangbin marked the impending release of Mordechai by relaunching their official playlist generator. On a website called AirKhruang, fans can specify a duration and choose from a wide range of activities, then receive a custom-generated mix via Spotify or Apple Music to enhance the vibe of whatever they find themselves doing. The song selections reflect the laid-back cosmopolitanism that has turned this largely instrumental Houston trio into theater-filling stars, with fans including both JAY-Z and your Phish-loving cousin. Generate a playlist for reading and you might be served French jazz fusion and Thai electro; choose “beach hang” instead and you might get Somalian disco and Sierra Leonean maringa. Khruangbin’s eclecticism clearly stems from real devotion to music from outside the Western pop-rock canon, and their willingness to direct listeners toward their influences shows an admirable lack of pretense about where it all comes from. But Mordechai rarely accomplishes anything these playlists don’t do better: rendering vibrant sounds from all over the world as impeccably stylish mood music. Mordechai, Khruangbin’s third proper album, is the first to prominently feature vocals, with all three members contributing. The introduction of singing suggests a new interest in songcraft, a welcome development for a band whose past records can feel like evocative but unpopulated landscapes, heavy on languid atmosphere and light on compositional substance. And Mordechai’s most memorable tracks are the ones with the most singing, like the poolside disco of “Time (You and I),” and the highlife-inspired pop of “So We Won’t Forget.” The best is “Pelota,” whose sun-baked guitar licks and surrealistic Spanish lyrics don’t point so clearly to any particular genre reference, offering a lively possibility for what Khruangbin might sound like when they’re not trying to be anyone but themselves. But Mordechai doesn’t quite commit to delivering fleshed-out songs, or to synthesizing Khruangbin’s influences into something new. It’s too busy to settle fully into your subconscious like the intercontinental ambience of Khruangbin’s 2018 breakout Con Todo El Mundo, but not substantial enough to satisfy more active listening. On “One to Remember,” guitarist Mark Speer plays meandering jazz leads above a dubby one-drop rhythm from Ochoa and drummer DJ Johnson, an intriguing combination that might rise above its Pat Metheny Meets Rockers Uptown pastiche if Speer didn’t sound so tentative about whether he’s taking a solo or hanging in the background. The vocals consist of a few chanted words, appearing as occasional reverb-drenched accents. It’s a clear nod to the way dub producers reduce melodic lines to ghostly echoes, but without its careful attention to negative space or its suggestion of depth beneath the surface. Opener “First Class” channels the shimmering-asphalt aura of Roy Ayers’ immortal 1976 jazz-funk track “Everybody Loves the Sunshine,” a platonic ideal for the sort of music Khruangbin are making here: quietly swaggering, more groove than song, belonging to no particular genre but evoking several, conjuring a singular mood from a few simple elements arranged in just the right way. Khruangbin’s failure to catch the elusive magic of the original may be an issue of historical fetishism. Ayers wasn’t studiously recreating the feeling of a decades-old cratedigger gem. He was just playing what he wanted to play. In a recent New York Times profile, Khruangbin’s label head compared the experience of hearing them for the first time to coming across a mindblowing rare record: “I couldn’t place it—was it a lost psych-funk classic from a far-off land?” You get the sense that Khruangbin like it this way. They are almost as much like DJs as they are a band, as driven to curate as they are to create. Like their previous albums, Mordechai is distant and murky in its production, heavy with nostalgia for a nonspecific time and locale. It sounds as if it’s already been plucked from a dollar bin, fawned over by an exclusive cult of collectors, uploaded to YouTube, and eventually reissued, before it was ever released in the first place. It is difficult to imagine Khruangbin existing before the internet, at a time when digging for lost classics might have meant pawing through records in crates around the world. Their music is borne from the abundance of streaming, and also borne toward it, its tastefully unobtrusive good vibes purpose-built for playlist placements and Netflix syncs. But Khruangbin also belong to several older and woolier traditions. Their semifrequent guitar solos and emphasis on instrumental interplay make them something like a jam band, which may help explain their runaway success, granting them access to a uniquely loyal base of concertgoers. And their repurposing of Caribbean, African, and Asian sounds as lush easy listening has antecedents as varied as Thievery Corporation and Les Baxter—though, to be fair, they engage with their source material much more seriously and transparently than the exotica artists of the ’50s and ’60s. A few decades later, those exotica records took on their own status as kitschy collector’s items, and perhaps Mordechai will fare similarly. Down the road, it might look less like a collection of music from across global history and more like a flawed but fascinating reflection of our relationship to that music at this particular moment in time. Nearly everything is available, and everyone is a connoisseur, a state of affairs that can be both enlivening and depressing. There’s nothing like the excitement of finding a great old record you’ve never heard before on YouTube or Spotify, and nothing like the promise of another on the horizon to keep you from spending much time with the one you just found. Mordechai is a symptom of this condition as well as a kind of antidote: it gives you everything at once, without asking for much at all in return. All you have to do is chill. Correction: *A previous version of this review misstated the origin date of the playlist. The language has been adjusted to reflect that he playlist existed before the launch of the album. The review also stated that bassist Laura Lee Ochoa mostly handled lead vocals. It has been updated to say that the entire band sings on the album, which better reflects the nature of the vocals. *","On their third album, the dubby band’s feel for a groove remains intact, but they often render vibrant sounds from all over the world as impeccably stylish mood music.

A Portrait of an Ugly Man,Remo Drive,by: Evan Rytlewski,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5ef281ceca5f171c3b7705a3/1:1/w_160/A%20Portrait%20of%20an%20Ugly%20Man_Remo%20Drive.jpg,2020-06-26 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/remo-drive-a-portrait-of-an-ugly-man/,Epitaph,"For an emo band, Remo Drive never got too hung up on the whole “emotions” thing. At a time when the scene’s prestige acts were leaning harder than ever into unflinching depictions of mental-health crises, the Minneapolis group kept things light on their 2017 debut Greatest Hits, reveling in giddy, smart-ass pop-punk that refused to take itself seriously. It's no wonder Epitaph signed them: Their Get Up Kids-worshipping hookiness made them a clear candidate for a crossover audience in a scene that hadn’t had much luck crossing over. Was the record all a little too easy, too obvious? Sure. But it ripped. Three years later, Remo Drive hasn’t released anything that's given Greatest Hits a run for its money. Maybe it was the band’s decision to cut out drummer Sam Mathys, reducing the group to a duo of brothers Erik and Stephen Paulson, but the old alchemy has been disrupted. Subsequent releases have been more ambitious—less punk, more alternative, perhaps—but depleted of the mischief and buoyancy that made Greatest Hits such a kick. The difference was noticeable on last year’s Natural, Everyday Degradation, and it’s even more pronounced on their third full-length A Portrait of an Ugly Man, a record that takes bolder swings than its predecessor while falling even flatter. At least nobody can accuse them of playing it safe anymore. Erik Paulson has retired his standard-issue emo whine in favor of a scenery-chewing bellow clearly indebted to Morrissey. He really goes for it—on “Dead Man,” his incensed wail reverberates off the rafters—but his showboating quickly wears thin. He's got the gumption to go loud but lacks the gravitas to carry the quieter moments. The guitars, meanwhile, channel the thunder-and-chime of late ’80s alternative bands capably but without dazzle, a Sam’s Club imitation of a name brand. The bigger problem with Remo Drive’s The Queen is Dead makeover is that it leaves Erik Paulson’s lyrics front and center, which only spotlights the clunkers. And man, there are clunkers. “Honey, if you want to make me crumble at your touch, you’ll have to dress up like an apple and take me to the Genius Bar,” he sings on “True Romance Lives.” It’s a pun in search of a joke. Morrissey knew how to undersell his zingers, burying them so deep in melodrama that there was no distinction between his wry declarations and his earnest ones. Paulson, however, can’t resist patting himself on the back for every so-so turn of phrase. “I’ve heard the grass is so much greener/When strangers offer it to you,” he sings on “A Flower and a Weed.” Remo Drive probably didn't do themselves any favors releasing A Portrait so quickly after the last one, while the disappointment of their sophomore flop was still fresh but too soon for their debut to carry any real nostalgic weight. After Natural, Everyday Degradation, it felt premature to tag the band as a one-album wonder. It sure doesn’t anymore.","The Minneapolis emo band broke through in 2017 with a giddy pop-punk sound; two albums later, they are taking bigger chances but falling flatter.

ROSETTA EP,Dua Saleh,by: Mankaprr Conteh,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5ef229acdc55f46b4632392b/1:1/w_160/ROSETTA%20EP_Dua%20Saleh.jpg,2020-06-26 05:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/dua-saleh-rosetta-ep/,AGAINST GIANTS,"Dua Saleh is terrified of being tokenized. The 25-year-old Minneapolis-based artist holds identities that people tend to poke, prod, and fixate on: immigrant, refugee, Black, Muslim, activist, non-binary. They boldly engage with these facets of themself in their music anyway. They’ve sung in Arabic. They’ve released an ode to Black victims of murderous cops, promising the song’s proceeds to a radical hometown organization. Their new EP, Rosetta, is named for Sister Rosetta Tharpe, the oft-forgotten architect of rock’n’roll who straddled Christian and secular spaces, though Saleh finished recording before choosing the name. Only in hindsight did Saleh consider Tharpe’s style and story, particularly her failed romantic relationship with collaborator Marie Knight. But the artist reserves their sharpest criticism for the religious zealots who demonize queer people. Rosetta doesn’t relay queer life with the sort of warm, danceable tracks that bookended Saleh’s first release, Nūr, whose breakout single “Sugar Mama” described a romantic prospect who seemed to fetishize Saleh, too. Instead, Nūr’s harrowing “Survival” may be Rosetta’s clearest predecessor. On that eerie track, Saleh wrestled with the devil and tried to clear their name. On Rosetta, Saleh embraces sin, addressing it directly. “I know you,” they tell it on “windhymn.” Hoping to satirize the belief that queer people are destined for fire and brimstone in the afterlife, Rosetta features archetypally nefarious queer characters over haunting soundscapes by the EP’s executive producer, Psymun. Saleh is the victim of a lusty enchantress on “umbrellar,” a sexual aggressor on “smut,” and, most memorably, a Hadean slick-talker named Lucifer LaBelle on “hellbound.” The song twists Rosetta’s hip-hop cadences, pop elements, and rock thrashes into a whirlwind of chaos. It is the project’s thesis, combining musical elements that appear throughout: a creeping, skeletal melody that builds into nightmarish distortion, accompanied by Saleh’s steady flow and the light, long sound of their singing, like they’re casting a spell. As Lucifer LaBelle, a brash queer and trans figure who takes pleasure in seduction, Saleh conjures the underworld without actually condemning anyone to it. “Why you fucking hellbound?” they ask instead. In interviews, Saleh has not been coy about Rosetta’s aims and subtext, which is important, because their writing is often so abstract it could feel meaningless without explanation. They got their start in poetry, writing dark pieces that worried their teachers. Like challenging, personal poetry, Rosetta’s lyrics are heavy on imagery, but the images are disparate and rapid. On intro “cat scratch,” Saleh summons a bloody cheek, dank air, flowering plants, and a toothless raptor within 30 seconds. Sometimes, Saleh’s accessibility is strategic. “smut” ends in soft Arabic warbling that they’re reluctant to translate to English, preferring to reserve an element of their music for a fanbase that can recognize it. What Saleh and Psymun do best is communicate by mood. “cat scratch” feels unorganized, but there’s a sharpness to its text. Throughout Rosetta, the team creates intrigue and darkness without camp—but without Saleh saying so, the satirical embodiment of religious spite is often unclear, even on “hellbound.” Saleh’s coded lyrics present their vantage point without compromise or commodification, but listeners may still find their ideas difficult to parse. The hexed feeling of the music strikes a nerve, but the tape’s true villain—institutional hate—remains obscured. Luckily, Dua Saleh is an astute and generous guide.","Named in honor of Sister Rosetta Tharpe, the Minneapolis-based musician’s shadowy EP is an imaginative investigation of religious and sexual tensions.

False Spring,Zachary Cale,by: Sam Sodomsky,Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5ef28465464fe661509aa570/1:1/w_160/False%20Spring_Zachary%20Cale.jpg,2020-06-26 05:00:00,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/zachary-cale-false-spring/,All Hands ElectricRide Through The Rain,"False Spring is a long, sweet ramble of an album. Like the view from an early morning flight, it assumes a vantage where everything looks still and glowing and peaceful. Brooklyn artist Zachary Cale works in the tradition of cryptic, pastoral singer-songwriters like Jeff Tweedy and Cass McCombs. But unlike his more lyric-driven peers, Cale’s goal is to stay out of the way of his songs. On False Spring, his work has more in common with wordless, new age-leaning Americana projects like the recent work of William Tyler or the ’80s output from the label Windham Hill. More than with his impressionistic words, Cale expresses himself most eloquently through subtle instrumental details: his fingerpicking, the way he places a piano in the mix, how one song’s fadeout speaks to the next one’s opening. During the first half of the 2010s, Cale released nearly an album a year, each one a clear evolution from the last. But after 2015’s full-band breakthrough Duskland, he stepped away. “The last five years have felt like one long winter,” he wrote about this album’s long genesis. False Spring offers little insight into the darkness he might have faced; instead, he meditates on transformation, on deeper changes. Through the album’s hour-plus runtime, Cale seems less concerned with his own place in the world than with how the world has moved on without him: “The sand is shifting/The clocks are turning,” he sings brightly in “Mad Season,” surveying his environment before immersing himself back in it. The instrumental songs come in pairs: the title track and “Magnetic North” near the top, “Black Dirt Drift” and “Seaside Downtime” near the end. Their sequencing gives the album a narrative thrust, and the band’s performances complement him at every turn. The sound is polished but exploratory, vibrant but refined. Hearing them at work is like the feeling of walking barefoot over wet grass. Cale encouraged his accompanists to write their own parts to each song, lending the music a more collaborative spirit. When a hushed saxophone solo emerges during the lilting “Come Morning,” it sounds almost inquisitive, answered by one of the album’s most mournful verses. Cale sings about feeling exhausted and voiceless, so the music trudges alongside him. Even at their darkest, his songs aim to pacify, never settling too long on dissonant thoughts or minor chords. Amid all his introspection, Cale searches for hope. The closing “Free to Go,” accompanied by Alfra Martini’s gentle background vocals, might be his version of a sweeping finale: The lyrics turn wistful, the band settles into twilight balladry. “Please God, don’t let this be a mirage,” he sings. It’s a thought that might occur when life seems too beautiful to be real, and it’s a fitting sentiment to end an album so steeped in calmness and solitude that it sometimes seems to float just above reality. Minus a few surging highlights—particularly the open-tuned uplift of “Careening,” a grand melding of Wilco circa Summerteeth and Yo La Tengo’s more blissful, acoustic jams—the mood itself is what stands out. According to Cale, he recorded several albums’ worth of material in the half-decade since Duskland, but these songs are what spoke to him. Their purpose is clear. “I wanna be your piece of heaven/In a world that’s cold and broken,” he sings in “Man Beside You.” From him, it’s a romantic gesture, and the key word is “piece.” On False Spring, he hopes to be part of something greater, a companion for the long haul.","Returning after a five-year absence, the Brooklyn musician slots into a tradition of cryptic, pastoral singer-songwriters; more than his lyrics, it’s the peaceful mood-setting that stands out.

Women in Music Pt. III,Haim,by: Aimee Cliff,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5ef251988813ffa92664e509/1:1/w_160/Women%20in%20Music%20Pt.%20III_Haim.jpg,2020-06-25 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/haim-women-in-music-pt-iii/,Columbia,"It’s well known that the only three people who take long walks through the streets of Los Angeles are Haim. The image of the trio striding or line-dancing their way around the city is indelibly linked to their music: cool, confident, full of momentum. The videos to accompany their third album, Women in Music Part III, nod to the strolls of the past and add in a few new twists. In “Now I’m in It,” directed again by Paul Thomas Anderson, bassist Este and guitarist Alana carry Danielle (lead vocals, production, guitar) on a stretcher; when Danielle is revived and joins her sisters for their signature walk, she casts a knowing glance straight to camera. In another video, they’re trailed by a gloomy saxophonist; in another, they stand rooted to the spot. These videos show the evolution of Haim, whose songwriting on WIMPIII is likewise more nuanced, more self-aware, and frequently darker than ever before. The biting satire of the album’s title is something of a red herring for its explicitly personal content. In interviews, each sister has described a personal trauma that she brought to the studio. Alana has spoken of the grief she suffered when a best friend passed away at age 20, and Este has talked about the low points of living with Type 1 diabetes. Most felt is Danielle’s deep depression; she traces its origin to when her partner (and co-producer) Ariel Rechtshaid was diagnosed with testicular cancer in 2015. Historically, Haim’s lyrics have been conversational and straightforward: emotionally incisive, sure, but usually vague enough that you could easily place yourself inside them. On WIMPIII, though, Danielle writes in vivid scenes, pulling you inside her personal depression fog. She blinks awake and finds herself at the wheel of her car; she watches TV and stares at the ceiling; she goes to the boulevard and can’t stop crying. On the stomping country-rock of “I’ve Been Down,” she sings about taping up the windows of her house, adding sardonically, “But I ain’t dead yet.” Elsewhere, the sisters cut and paste the most offensive interview questions they’ve faced from music journalists (“Do you make the same faces in bed?”) into a candid folk song that channels the spirit of Joni Mitchell. Danielle was also inspired by André 3000’s solo album The Love Below, an exploratory record that sewed together disparate genres with uninhibited slapstick humor. While WIMPIII is more theatrical than Haim have been before—there’s the gasp that opens the underwater rock song “Up From a Dream,” the “you up?” voicemail skits on “3 AM”—the most obvious similarity is in the band’s newfound musical fluidity. With signature production touches from Rostam throughout, these songs shift gears, often eschewing Haim's usual summery rock to find the right genre for the mood, sometimes containing different shades within the same track. “All That Ever Mattered” peppers Danielle’s vocals with distorted screams and a mumbled interjection of “fuck no,” before pirouetting away into a glam-rock guitar solo. “3 AM” and “Another Try” flirt with falsetto-driven funk and R&B, and “I Know Alone,” a song about depression-scrolling and sleeping through the day, contains dusty echoes of UK garage. Not every song feels like a pioneering event. “Don’t Wanna” could have lived on any of Haim’s three albums: a tight pop-rock song built around an irrepressible guitar lick and an oblique story of a relationship in trouble. But their most exciting trips go off the beaten path, like the crystalline sad banger “Now I’m in It”—a song that wouldn’t have sounded out of place on Taylor Swift’s Lover. This may be the first Haim album that steps out of its retro groove long enough to draw parallels with other contemporary pop music, specifically Rechtshaid and Danielle’s recent work with Vampire Weekend. Having long since proven their chops when it comes to writing a breezy 1970s-style rock song, they now sound comfortable enough within their niche to push beyond it. WIMPIII is bookended by two songs about L.A., both featuring a saxophone and wistful “doot-do-do” backing vocals. On the first, “Los Angeles,” Danielle describes falling out of love with her hometown. But in the final song, “Summer Girl”—while its melody hits a similarly melancholic vein—she interpolates Lou Reed as she sings about the relief of coming home to L.A. from tour to be with her partner. She’s anguished when she sings that she’s “thinking ’bout leaving” the city, but hushed and reverent on a later line when she reflects on how much she misses it: “L.A. on my mind, I can’t breathe.” Placed beside each other, the two songs take on new dimensions. It’s Haim as we haven’t quite heard them before: not just eminently proficient musicians, entertainers, and “women in music,” but full of flaws and contradictions, becoming something much greater. Listen to our Best New Music playlist on Spotify and Apple Music. Correction: An earlier version of this review omited the production work of Rostam.","The third album from the trio is far and away their best. Intimate, multidimensional, and wide-ranging, the songwriting shines with personality and a great curiosity for melody and style.

Mia Gargaret, Gia Margaret,by: Quinn Moreland,Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5ee8f7e5ca5f171c3b76ffb2/1:1/w_160/Mia%20Gargaret_Gia%20Margaret.jpg,2020-06-25 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/gia-margaret-mia-gargaret/,Orindal,"The voice is a singer’s portal into an audience’s heart. It can inspire recognition, empathy, the feeling that you aren’t alone in your sadness or joy. “The listener’s inner body is illuminated, opened up: a singer doesn’t expose her own throat, she exposes the listener’s interior,” the poet and critic Wayne Koestenbaum wrote in his book The Queen’s Throat. So how does a singer communicate when their voice suddenly vanishes? This was the predicament facing the dream-folk songwriter Gia Margaret after her voice disappeared while touring her 2018 debut, There’s Always Glimmer. As she recuperated at home in Chicago, Margaret took to puttering around on a synthesizer, building loops of glowing, meditative tones. These ambient experiments form the basis of her second record, a collection of 11 gentle songs titled Mia Gargaret. On There’s Always Glimmer, Margaret invoked nature in words, through images of mist and moons spilling through windows, embers burning, stones sinking into water. Without her usual tools of communication, she turns to field recordings to expand her world: Church bells, footsteps, and bird calls are sprinkled throughout. Pensive opener “Apathy” ends with a clip of her vocal exercises, with a therapist cheerily encouraging Margaret to feel “free in your body and let things come out the way they want.” After several songs of dissonant synths, “Lakes” pairs samples of crashing waves against the delicate pickings of an acoustic guitar. Early on “barely there,” Margaret uses her own speaking voice—marking its first significant appearance on the album—to reflect on anxiety. “Do you ever feel like you’re living your life but you’re also barely there?” she asks. “The conversations you can’t remember because when you had them your mind was just trying to make it to the next sentence.” Mia Gargaret’s patient pace and contemplative tone encapsulate these questions of existence, dissociation, and introspection. The aptly titled “sadballad” pairs a melancholic piano melody with elongated synth notes. Suspended in a state of calming lethargy, “3 movements” nods to Margaret’s classical piano training. “Body” samples a lecture titled “Overcome Social Anxiety” by the British philosopher Alan Watts, whose work also inspired Buchla wizard Kaitlyn Aurelia Smith on her 2017 record The Kid. “‘My body is a burden to me.’ To whom? To whom? That’s the question,” Watts says over Margaret’s twinkling synthesizer. “When there is no body left for whom the body can be a burden, then the body isn’t a burden. But so long as you fight it, it is.” On the final track, “lesson,” Margaret’s singing voice materializes for the first and only time. Featuring contributions from Oakland singer-songwriter Stephen Steinbrink, “lesson” harks back to Margaret’s debut while pointing to a new future that incorporates the lessons learned on Mia Gargaret. The song both suggests the healing of her vocal cords and seems to confirm Watts’ words: When given time to rest and regenerate, the body is capable of small wonders.","Following the loss of her voice while out on tour, the Chicago singer-songwriter turned to her synthesizers as she recuperated, building loops out of glowing, meditative tones.

Kitchen Sink,Nadine Shah,by: Ben Hewitt,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5ed7e2fed5f4a1d8ae15fb57/1:1/w_160/Kitchen%20Sink_Nadine%20Shah.jpg,2020-06-25 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/nadine-shah-kitchen-sink/,Infectious,"On her fourth album, Nadine Shah unearths hard-luck stories in all sorts of bleak corners, squaring off with sleazy creeps, spiteful deadbeats, and neighborhood racists. But while the songs have the verisimilitude of the grainy British dramas they’re named for, she isn’t interested in the humdrum trappings of reality. Instead, she colors her songs with vibrant shades, drawing out tragicomic absurdities with sly panache. The result is direct but disorienting, like a grim domestic scene painted by Matisse. For Shah, it’s a concept closer to home than 2017’s fraught, state-of-the-world address Holiday Destination, which took in British bigotry, the Syrian refugee crisis, and the “fascist in the White House.” Yet she shifts focus without losing grip of her unsettling songwriting: these character-driven vignettes are rooted in grim realities, pressures, and prejudices, and although she swaps brooding post-punk for brighter, more lurid sounds, she still builds her songs for discomfort. Often she explores her experiences as a woman in her 30s and the sexist, ageist drek she and have friends have endured: “Running gauntlets/Swerving perverts,” she drones over skittish percussion and swarming-bee synths on “Walk,” transforming a walk down the street into an Escherian obstacle course. Those disconcerting flourishes allow Shah to tease out the political grit in each personal ordeal, and the best songs land in some odd hinterland between the surreal melodramas of Björk and the wry commentary of Pulp. The title track’s slinky throb finds Shah, a British Muslim of Norwegian-Pakistani heritage, clocking dirty looks from xenophobic neighbors. “Gossiping, boring bunch of bitches,” she fires back, relishing every snarky syllable with her theatrical Geordie drawl. On “Club Cougar,” she’s pestered by a smarmy guy who just knows she’s an older woman on the prowl; in truth, they’re basically the same age and she finds him repulsive. “All dressed up/ Think I did it for ya,” she sneers, refusing to play along with the track’s carnal atmosphere of sultry saxophone and animal howls. In the wrong hands, that grotty-scenario-meets-lavish-score formula could slip into farce, and Shah isn’t afraid of mining black humor from the incongruities. She brings a sensual purr and lithe guitar to “Ladies for Babies (Goats for Love),” the tale of a neglected trophy wife whose husband treats her like livestock and his farm animals like sweethearts, and calls out a gaslighting drunk on the swampy strut of “Buckfast.” But she never prioritizes cheap laughs over gut punches. Restless, eerie rhythms give “Trad” a dark uneasiness, and synths glower and swoon as Shah panics she’s running out of time to do what society expects—get married, have kids—even though she knows how stifling those expectations are. “Shave my legs/ Freeze my eggs,” she sings, half-mesmerised and half-miserable, in the thrall of a dangerous spell. “Will you want me when I am old?” Early in her career, Shah was routinely hailed as a mythical lovechild of Nick Cave and PJ Harvey, and she holds onto some some of that gothic grandeur: “Kite,” with its haunted chants, whistles, and twinkles, sounds like one of her old compositions broken down into a ghostly western. Increasingly, though, she sounds less their stylistic disciple than a similarly charismatic, chameleonic storyteller. On the closing “Prayer Mat,” she explores the dwindling days of her relationship with an influential figure—“the pioneer who learned to love abroad”—the two of them blotting everything out with booze and old memories. “We batten down the hatches/ We drink on airport time,” intones Shah over shuddering guitars and electronics. “Together we write our epitaphs/Whilst dizzy from our wine.” Like most of Kitchen Sink, it’s a report from an altered state, a true story in a strange hue; real life, but only as Shah could tell it.","The best songs on the singer-songwriter’s excellent fourth album invoke the surreal melodramas of Björk and the wry social commentary of Pulp.

Naujawanan Baidar,Naujawanan Baidar,by: Marc Masters,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5ef231de464fe661509aa4c5/1:1/w_160/Naujawanan%20Baidar_Naujawanan%20Baidar.jpg,2020-06-25 05:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/naujawanan-baidar-naujawanan-baidar/,Feeding TubeCardinal Fuzz,"N.R. Safi has never visited Afghanistan, but that country is part of his heritage—his father is of Afghan descent—and for a long time, its music has played in his head. A few years after founding Tucson, Arizona, psych band Myrrors (in which he’s known as Nik Rayne), Safi inherited a trove of his paternal grandfather’s tapes, filled with decades-old songs from Kabul, Afghanistan’s capital. This spurred him to ramp up the solo project he calls Naujawanan Baidar, using his cassettes as both source material and inspiration to create new sounds. The first two Naujawanan Baidar tapes, now compiled together as a double LP, mix traditional Afghan melodies, entrancing loops, outward-bound psychedelic jaunts, and enigmatic noise. Playing non-Western instruments such as the Afghan rubab, Indian tabla, and Persian sorna, Safi recorded directly to cassette, dubbing sounds back and forth through effects that he says “added [a] layer of barely-controlled chaos.” Recording in the American Southwest, he later edited the material in Eindhoven, Netherlands, where he currently lives. The results do indeed evoke a dusty tape unearthed in a market stall in some far-off land, but they also bear an otherworldly aura beyond any specific time or place. Safi achieves that aura by emphasizing melody and texture in equal measure. Nearly all 15 tracks on Naujawanan Baidar involve simple hooks and rhythms from which Safi rarely wavers. But those elements aren’t just left to toil away on their own. Dense webs of crunchy distortion, brazen in-the-red mixing, and tape decay all wrap each tune in an alluring cloud of smoke. This hypnotic effect is mirrored in Safi’s repetitive song structures, which are so insistent it feels like they’re cutting new grooves into your brain as they play. Within these loops, Safi generates lots of sonic variety. On “Khyber Sound,” a low rumble and a handclap beat ride under Safi’s fiery yelps. “Mojaherin” follows with a swaying rhythm somewhere between a march and a dance, sounding dubbed from a late-night broadcast of an old epic movie. In places, Safi’s repetitions turn abstract: The hammering “Symmetry of Knives” is seven minutes of metronomic crash and burn, while during the nuclear meltdown of closer “Panj Ruz Pesh,” it’s hard to discern Rafi’s source sounds among all the wreckage. Such hermetic sonics can induce claustrophobia, but they’re also exhilarating, a synthesis of old and new that forms its own kaleidoscopic ecosystem. At times, Naujawanan Baidar feels like a random spin of an Afghan FM dial (it even opens with a static-filled “Radio Introduction”), not unlike some of the early compilations on Sublime Frequencies, taped straight from the receiver. Yet Safi’s work is bigger than a documentary field recording. He certainly respects the artists he’s building on—he cites Ahmad Zahir, Salma Jahani, and Beltoon and Hamidullah, among others—but his reimagining of this vital slice of Afghanistan’s musical legacy is as much about moving forward as looking back. The name Naujawanan Baidar means “enlightened youth” in Farsi; as he put it recently, “there is a big opportunity today for the children of the diaspora to look to their roots and bring some fresh new ideas to the table.” On Naujawanan Baidar, Safi advances that cause with intoxicating zeal.","Reworking a trove of cassettes filled with decades-old songs from Kabul, the Arizona native explores his Afghan heritage by collaging traditional melodies, entrancing loops, and psychedelic noise.

Homegrown,Neil Young,by: Emilie Friedlander,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5ee905a27bb7acb328d56837/1:1/w_160/Homegrown_Neil%20Young.jpg,2020-06-24 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/neil-young-homegrown/,Reprise,"For a certain kind of music lover, there’s nothing more alluring than a “lost” album. Unlike a record that was merely “scrapped” or “never released,” the term suggests something both mysterious and not worth losing—especially when that album is fabled to be particularly emotionally raw, and especially when the artist who created it is beloved precisely for his rawness, but also for his reticence. “Sometimes life hurts,” Neil Young wrote in a blog post announcing that he was finally releasing Homegrown, an album that’s something of a unicorn among the sort of fans who read his Times-Contrarian newspaper. “This is the one that got away.” There are a couple stories about why Young waited 46 years to release Homegrown, a collection of stripped-back love songs he began writing at what was arguably the artistic zenith of his career. In one, recounted in Jimmy McDonough’s colossal Young biography, Shakey, Young made a spur-of-the-moment decision to release the high-octane Tonight’s the Night instead after he played the two records back to back for some musician friends during a half-remembered night at the Chateau Marmont. In another, the one that Young has been telling of late, he decided that the album—recorded in 1974 during a protracted break-up with the late actress Carrie Snodgress, the mother of his child Zeke—was simply too painful. “It was a little too personal—it scared me,” he told Cameron Crowe in a 1975 interview for Rolling Stone. According to Shakey, he described Homegrown to his father as “great songs I can live without.” Like the notoriously chaotic, honey slide-fueled On the Beach sessions that preceded it, the tale of Homegrown’s genesis, as chronicled by McDonough, is in some ways a story of rock’n’roll excess. After discovering that his wife had absconded to Hawaii on a five-day boat trip with a man the book calls “Captain Crunch,” a heartbroken Young set off on a mammoth 24-city tour with Crosby, Stills and Nash, who hadn’t released a new studio album together in four years. Nicknamed “the Doom Tour” by David Crosby, it ended up being the highest-grossing tour in history to date, with a cavalcade of indulgences that included hotel pillowcases and plates stamped with the band’s tour logo, limos hired and never used, and a giant celebratory billboard at a final stop in Long Island. (The group later said that tour was not particularly lucrative, because of the expenses.) As relationships within the group grew strained, McDonough writes, Young chose to travel from stop to stop on his own, in a GMC motorhome he called the Mobile-Obil, often with his son Zeke and their dog Art in tow. Though the RV broke down in the middle of the tour, the decision feels like the perfect entry point to the songs Young would write during this period on and off the road, even as he was playing blown-out, not particularly inspired renditions of CSNY hits on stage: sober, elemental, and full of the contradictory emotions that come with finding one’s self suddenly uprooted from a serious partnership. “I won’t apologize/The light shone from in your eyes/It isn’t gone, it will soon come back again,” he announces on the stunning, loping “Separate Ways,” opening the album on what feels like a note of acceptance: He and his ex-partner still have “their little boy”; they will simply be growing apart. By the next song, “Try,” he’s pleading for a second chance: “Darlin’, the door is open/To my heart, and I’ve been hoping/That you won’t be the one/To struggle with the key.” Though he recorded Homegrown with a revolving cast of players that included some of music’s biggest stars at the time (an ethereal EmmyLou Harris appears on two tracks, and the Band’s Levon Helm and Robbie Robertson chip in on drums and guitar, respectively), absent are the orchestral swells and jammy dirges that made On the Beach feel like a woozy foray into the nether regions of a high. And though a couple tracks recall the angular, nail-biting strain of amplified rock he’d minted on Tonight’s the Night—particularly “Vacancy,” a crescendo of anger which describes the look in his soon-to-be ex-partner’s eyes, and a song called “We Don’t Smoke It No More”—the dominant mode here is restraint, and a decidedly “homegrown”-sounding palette of acoustic instrumentation and slide guitar. It allows Young’s idiosyncratically simple approach to songwriting to take center stage. “I came to you when I needed a rest/You took my love and put it to the test,” he sings over a simple plucked guitar solo on “White Line,” which boasts the album’s most painfully delicate melody. Whether the song’s refrain—“That old white line is a friend of mine”—is meant as an allusion to the open road he describes, or a euphemism for drugs, the ambiguity, combined with the bare-bones treatment, only heightens the feeling that we’re getting a glimpse of Young at his most naked and unsparing. In some ways, Homegrown is hard to reckon with as a cohesive artistic statement. Though seven of its 12 tracks—among them “Separate Ways,” “Try,” and a gentle ballad called “Kansas”—have never been released in any official form, he’s brought nearly all of them out on stage at different points over the decades. Some—like “Love Is a Rose” and the childlike reverie “Little Wing”—have even appeared on other albums over the years, as have alternate recordings of “White Line,” “Star of Bethlehem,” and the title track. There are also a few profoundly weird moments, such as the two-minute spoken-word number called “Florida,” where, over the sound of a finger rubbing the ring of a glass, he tells a surreal story about rescuing a baby in the street after its parents perish in a hang-gliding accent. Mostly, though, the Young we get here resembles the Young we already know: the one who we first met on his rootsy-yet-metaphysical 1972 breakout album, Harvest, then again later on Comes a Time, in 1978. This is the Young who feels most at home expressing himself with a few simple piano or guitar chords, some lonesome harmonica notes, and the ragged inflections of his nasal, warbling voice—taking what can read like surface-level observations on paper, or even straight-up clichés, and making them feel like illuminations of some distant and unknowable truth. It’s a reminder of the qualities that make him such an excellent songwriter, and also, in some ways, an icon of 1970s, post-hippie masculinity: A laconic young anti-hero who is content to present us with brief flashes of his interiority as a stand-in for the whole, but who likes to remind us he is most at home on the open road. Perhaps it’s the slender nature of these poignant confessionals, which rarely clock in over three minutes, but when all is said and done, we’re left wanting more.","After 46 years, Neil Young unearths a lost but highly consequential album, a collection of humble, stripped-back love songs he began writing at what was arguably the artistic zenith of his career.

Bigger Love,John Legend,by: Sheldon Pearce,Contributing Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5ef241e8464fe661509aa533/1:1/w_160/Bigger%20Love_John%20Legend.jpg,2020-06-24 05:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/john-legend-bigger-love/,Columbia,"It’s a pretty good time to be John Legend. Since his last album, he scored the Emmy to secure his EGOT, had a second child with model Chrissy Teigen, was awarded an honorary doctorate at Berklee College of Music, and was named Sexiest Man Alive. The album he recorded amid all the success, Bigger Love, is correspondingly upbeat and joyous. He describes it as “vintage sounds with a modern sensibility,” in keeping with a longstanding personal mandate, using love songs as a bridge between the old and new. With this incredibly on-the-nose title, he reminds us both of his devotion to his muse and his limitations: Love might be fathomless, but Legend’s appreciation of it is pretty shallow. Legend believes in the power of love the way some believe in Christmas spirit—as a transmissible, irresistible force that extinguishes all negativity. Fittingly, the album reunites him with producer Raphael Saadiq, who was behind his 2018 Christmas album. Legend is pegging his new album, which was recorded primarily in 2019, as a sort of balm for the times. “A lot was going on, but I still felt like people need some uplifting music,” he told Oprah Magazine. “Hopefully it can help them get through what’s been a tough spring, and hopefully this music will help them have a better summer.” Bigger Love is rife with this feel-good energy, buoyed by his stately voice and easygoing charm, but beneath its positive exterior is an emptiness that’s hard to ignore. His last album, 2016’s Blake Mills-produced Darkness and Light, had a personality and intimacy that eluded him on previous albums. He was inhabiting songs as a person and not just a dutiful soul man treating the piano bench like a cubicle. They never quite conjured a “What’s Going On,” as they hoped, but Mills brought character to his music. The everymanisms of Love in the Future were replaced with personal reflections, confessions of a “FaceTime abuser,” and the politically minded expressiveness of a man clinging to hope in a darkening world; Legend’s songs were suddenly richer and more textured. Bigger Love reverts to a vacant pantomime and a less robust R&B palette courtesy of producers like Oak, Ryan Tedder, and Ricky Reed. His 2019 protest song, “Preach,” is curiously absent here; so, too, is the effortless tonal blend of the album’s predecessor. This marriage of vintage and modern goes awry, as Bigger Love opens with a trap take on doo-wop and closes with a Mr. Hudson ballad. Following the lead of his Oscar partner Common, Bigger Love is risk-averse and platitudinous. There’s a derivative YOLO song called “One Life” and the hook couldn’t be more uninspired: “We’ve got one life/I won’t waste it, one life/I’m gon’ taste the joy in every minute/Beginning’ ‘til the finish,” he sings. Not even Anderson .Paak’s smooth funk can save it. If the album’s tacky acoustic lead single, “Conversations in the Dark,” sounds like a not-so-subtle sync for a tear-jerker network drama, that’s because it pretty much is. No song here is transcendent enough to join “All of Me” in wedding-first-dance canon, nor is there a moment as touching and emotionally honest as “Right By You (for Luna),” the song he wrote for his newborn daughter on Darkness and Light, where he wonders aloud how she’ll receive and be received by the world, the quiver in his tone carrying a father’s anxiety. “Actions” fails to live up to its brazen “The Edge” sample, so clearly repurposed to call to mind Dr. Dre’s “The Next Episode” that its appeal is lost to sense memory, and the song’s core directive (“actions speak louder than love songs”) goes largely unheeded. Even working within the confines of his safe space, though, John Legend can remind you why Kanye built a label around him, and Bigger Love is sustained by such moments. He works well in collaboration with bluesman Gary Clark Jr. (“Wild”), psychedelic R&B singer Jhené Aiko (“U Move, I Move”), rap technician Rapsody (“Remember Us”), and reggae artist Koffee (“Don’t Walk Away”) on tracks that stretch his songcraft in different directions—anthemic pop rock, alt-R&B, neo soul, and dancehall lite. The attempts are bold by his standards, and he slots into each one confidently. “Favorite Place” is the kind of sexy-time jam befitting a new dad. He plays to his strengths on “Slow Cooker,” a quirky little song that likens brimming sensuality to the simmer of a crock-pot, letting the resonance of his timbre give shape to his phrases. On the understated “Focused,” the confusion produced by a noisy outside world falls away when under his wife’s thrall. Plain and folksy, it has the characteristics of a Bill Withers song: The simplicity of the lyrics mirrors how uncomplicated things are in her company. Suddenly, the uplifting power he’s been preaching about is in full effect.","The R&B star’s latest ode to the power of love bursts with positive energy, but there’s an emptiness beneath.

Somewhere,Gum Country,by: Sophie Kemp ,Contributor ,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5ef2216b1d45cc657be45689/1:1/w_160/Somewhere_Gum%20Country.jpg,2020-06-24 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/gum-country-somewhere/,Kingfisher BluezDinosaur CityWaterslide,"Somewhere, the debut record from the slightly deranged twee psych-pop duo Gum Country, is the product of a move from Vancouver to Los Angeles and the uncertainty and anxiety that comes with living in a new place. The brainchild of guitarist Courtney Garvin of the Courtneys and drummer Connor Mayer, Somewhere embraces lo-fi aesthetics and wry lyrics about visualization exercises, vegging out, and feeling on the verge of falling asleep behind the wheel of life. The record is as ironic as it is fun, where goofiness is the answer to anxiety in the face of isolation and new beginnings. Gum Country’s music lies in the sweet spot between Stereolab’s loopy grooves and the snarky yet sweet songs of the Magnetic Fields. With its impeccable bass groove and warm, vintage organs, the opener and title track is the kind of lo-fi punk you can dance to like a Peanuts character. Its lyrics describe the simultaneous fear and excitement of acquainting oneself with a new place: “Haven’t felt this way in a while/I can’t think straight, can’t find my style/I guess this is my life for a while,” Garvin sings with a chilled-out, cartoonish attitude. Finding your footing in the great big world is a nauseating exercise, she suggests, but worth it in the end. The sentiment is enshrouded by layers of distortion and delay, requiring time to parse out her words. More often than not, it’s worth it. Gum Country engage directly with the things we do when we’re alone, an experience that can be wildly monotonous to the point of insanity. On “Brain Song,” Garvin unselfconsciously calls out a few influences: “Sunset on my back/Kate Bush/Fleetwood Mac,” goes one line, as casual as a grocery list. On “Talking to My Plants,” Garvin sings about the anxiety of isolation with a bone-dry sense of humor. “I’m talking to my plants/Or are they talking to me?” she asks. Then a plant speaks: “I am a plant/Please give me water/And lots of sunlight.” It’s an exchange plucked from a hot summer afternoon by yourself, when you start to anthropomorphize the only other living thing in the room. At times, Somewhere hits a lull. The record stretches out too long and flirts with monotony in its own right. Some songs inch toward the directly personal, but never quite goes all the way. Lyrics tend to be fragmented, and Garvin’s aesthetic choices often distort her vocals until you can’t quite make out what she’s saying. The choices fit the record’s scrappy ethos, but it would be interesting to see Garvin be more direct. Somewhere is as its best when Garvin bares her teeth and uses her sense of humor to talk about what is haunting her, be it spending far too much time alone, or trying to find your place on new ground.","The duo of guitarist Courtney Garvin and drummer Connor Mayer make deranged twee psych-pop, anxious and sometimes goofy songs fit for isolation in unfamiliar surroundings.

Young & Turnt 2 (Deluxe),42 Dugg,by: Alphonse Pierre,Staff Writer ,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5ef22546464fe661509aa4c0/1:1/w_160/Young%20&%20Turnt%202%20(Deluxe)_42%20Dugg.jpg,2020-06-24 05:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/42-dugg-young-and-turnt-2-deluxe/,CMG4 Pockets Full,"Seconds into 42 Dugg’s Young and Turnt Vol. 2, you hear him whistle. It’s not a particularly skillful whistle—it’s the type of airy sound you usually make by accident, and actually, at first it was. “I don’t even know why I did that shit, I ain’t even gonna lie,” the 25-year-old East Detroit native said in an interview. But regardless of how amateurish it may be, I can’t imagine a 42 Dugg song without it. The whistling, shit-talking rapper has accomplished what once seemed impossible in Detroit: he's found nationwide appeal without abandoning the core elements of the city’s homegrown style. It wasn’t always this way. After being granted his freedom in 2017, Dugg began to put out unmixed and offbeat music—common in Detroit. Even though he was raw, he had a vivid touch that recalled influences like Jeezy. It made him a rising Midwest star, one who would subtly evolve when he arrived in Atlanta. In Atlanta, Dugg formed a friendship playing high-stakes dice games with the emerging Lil Baby, who helped the Detroit rapper’s rugged raps reach the ear of Yo Gotti. Together, Lil Baby and Yo Gotti signed 42 Dugg in 2019, and released his mixtape Young and Turnt, a strong record that began to bridge the gap between Detroit and the South. Dugg hit his stride earlier this year on a pair of great rap songs from the deluxe version of Lil Baby’s My Turn. On “Grace,” Dugg’s confessional verses are the main attraction, delivered in the same lethargic style popular among East Detroit rappers like Babyface Ray and Peezy. Then there’s the electric “We Paid,” where an animated Dugg overshadows Baby: The opening line has since become his breakout moment: “Fore I go broke like Joc/Fuck with that dog like Vick.” (Just don’t bring it up around Yung Joc.) Young and Turnt Vol. 2 was originally released in March, but like so many major rap records in 2020, it has been updated with a deluxe edition. In its first form, the mixtape was an easy end-to-end listen, and miraculously, the added nine songs don’t take away from the fun, even though it’s clear that they’re meant to juice streaming numbers and capitalize on his rapidly growing fanbase. Of the original 14 tracks, the most ambitious are the ones which attempt to balance Dugg’s Atlanta influences with his Detroit flair. “Not a Rapper,” featuring Southside production that sounds like it’s been collecting dust since the Obama era, should have been the typical forced major label album cut, but his signature Midwest flow—always a step ahead of the beat—keeps the song fresh. The balance isn’t perfect though; “Ride With Me” takes a swing at a scratchy melody which should be forever reserved for Atlanta crooners. Dugg is by far at his best when he’s making traditional Detroit rap songs with a little bit of big-money polish. On “Habit,” Dugg reps his city hard: The track has bass-heavy production from local legend Helluva, and Dugg, spits the rich, boundary-pushing stories that are the norm in Detroit: “Prolly serve fentanyl to five thousand fiends.” He’s even sharper when he’s reflective. “Fell out with my best friend over six grams/Now I ain’t got a best man but I got fans,” he raps over the soulful vocal sample and jittery bassline of “It Get Deeper.” The deluxe tracks aren’t as focused, and a pair of unnecessary remixes end the album with a whimper. Dugg stumbles back into some of the same missteps as the original record: “Free Dirt” sounds like it could have been recorded by any rising ATL rapper with a Coach K endorsement, and he once again makes us suffer through lousy vocals on “All My Life.” But there are moments that justify the deluxe’s existence beyond making Dugg’s pockets fatter. The Detroit street record “Light This Bitch Up” seems ready to soundtrack a Michigan State football postgame, and “Big 4’s” has an introduction almost as good as his breakout moment on “We Paid”: “I seen niggas hatin’ way before I ever had tints.” And, of course, none of it is complete without the whistle.","The whistling, shit-talking Detroit rapper has found nationwide appeal without abandoning the core elements of his city’s homegrown style.

The Album,Teyana Taylor,by: Rawiya Kameir,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5ef0c52edc55f46b4632387a/1:1/w_160/The%20Album_Teyana%20Taylor.jpg,2020-06-23 05:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/teyana-taylor-the-album/,G.O.O.D. MusicDef Jam,"Among the many injustices Black women must endure in the U.S. is this cruel fact: We are up to four times more likely to die in childbirth than white mothers. In New York City, Teyana Taylor’s hometown, the disparity is even more staggering. People like Beyoncé and Serena Williams have shared their own experiences with maternal health, driving some coverage into the news cycle and confirming that not even fame and seven-star healthcare can vanquish medical racism. Though Taylor doesn’t call it out directly, this context skulks around the first minute of The Album, whose intro repurposes leaked audio of the 911 call that chronicled the bathroom-floor delivery of her firstborn daughter Junie in 2015. “I’m holding my daughter in my hands,” mewls husband Iman Shumpert, before scrambling to tie off the umbilical cord. Junie, now 5, is the next voice to appear, softening the tension of her arrival into the world with a merry “turn it up!” She croons alongside her mother and Rick Ross on “Come Back to Me,” joining a club of celebrity children earning major-label royalty statements. The song is followed by another family affair; “Wake Up Love” features Shumpert, a 2016 NBA champion and part-time rapper, doing a gentle André 3000 impression. Last week, a cherubic video for the single doubled as an announcement that the couple is expecting their second child. Since becoming a mother and foregrounding her family, Taylor has found new momentum. When her slick, sexy turn as a “protective lioness” in Kanye West’s 2016 video for “Fade” introduced her to new audiences, she seized on the curiosity about her postpartum physique to create a dance-fitness business. (Taylor was careful in interviews to push back against scrutiny of women’s bodies after pregnancy.) She has also opened a nail salon named after Junie, starred in a family reality show alongside Shumpert, and launched The Aunties, a familial production company that has directed videos for Schoolboy Q and Lil Duval. The Album, Taylor’s third album, better represents the fierce persona she has honed in public. It is something of a corrective to 2018’s K.T.S.E., the project that concluded Kanye’s messy Wyoming spring. Taylor shined over some of her label boss’ most compelling production in years, but the men of G.O.O.D. Music fumbled her rollout and released a version she hadn’t approved herself. It recalled her early music experiences as a teen signed to Pharrell’s Star Trak label, when she was denied the autonomy she craved. This time, recording largely while quarantined at home during the pandemic, Taylor snatches her control back. “When people hear the album, they will understand what my frustration was with K.T.S.E. Trying to put a lot of emotion within seven songs is tough. To have a full album, you get to literally express yourself and every single part of you,” she said in an interview with NPR. At 23 songs, The Album is several times longer than K.T.S.E and infinitely more complex. Taylor splits it across five sections—in addition to the family-themed first bit, there are mini-chapters that explore desire, strength, drama, and joy. This, Taylor exudes, is the project she has always intended to make. In the absence of Kanye (he only has two credits here, both left over from earlier sessions), she opts for beats from Cardiak, Ayo N Keyz, and NOVA Wav—prolific, but not quite transgressive producers whose contemporary R&B sounds ground Taylor’s tremendous vocal ability. Her speaking voice, deep and raspy, is the source, flowing into a broad range that includes a robust upper register. The album’s best moments come when she’s at her most playful and inventive: coaxing Quavo into singing on “Let’s Build,” turning Erykah Badu’s “Next Lifetime” into a self-assured kiss-off on “Lowkey,” trading accents with Afropop star Davido on ”Killa.” It sags in the fourth section, where Taylor perhaps overcompensates for the brevity of K.T.S.E. with one too many ballads. Still, for an album that lives mostly in the slow- and mid-tempo, it frisks and frolics. Taylor has a unique talent for drawing discovery and rapture out of sexual tropes, actualizing R&B at its best. On one song, the DJ Camper-produced “1800-One-Night,” she breathily experiments with foreplay-as-jingle. It has the smoky, neon glare of a late-night TV ad, but the single-minded focus of a long-awaited encounter: “This time I’ll let you do things with me that we wanted to/This time is your time to shine, yeah,” Taylor sings, emphasizing the mutual consent and shared desires that “we” signifies. Instead of drums, a meaty bassline and trapezing synths intertwine below Taylor, forming a trampoline that send her vocals flying. Taylor remains fascinated with updating classic R&B, summoning an impressive tribe of elders—Badu, Lauryn Hill, Missy Elliott—for intergenerational power. The Album drips with references to recognizable hits from the ’90s and ’00s: She interpolates, references, or samples the sticky romance of Guy, the cheeky sass of Blaque, and the neo-soul warmth of Musiq Soulchild, among a handful of others. But even for nostalgia bait, The Album is extremely effective, subtly recontextualizing recognizable melodies into the present rather than relying on their familiarity for comfort. The strategy also does cynical double duty, pointing directly to the “’90s-inspired” makeup collection Taylor recently launched with MAC; it’s the sort of product tie-in that a marketing manager could only dream of. But it’s not all business. The abundance of successfully cleared features and references reads like a sly rejoinder to the sample clearance issue that blunted K.T.S.E.’s release; where her former label once failed, she doubled down. The allusion to a musical legacy does the important work of contextualizing Taylor within the genre as a masterful, almost-alternative soul singer, lest anyone else try to do it for her.","Teyana Taylor regains control of her art across a long and complex album, one that deftly recontextualizes classic R&B and better represents the fierce persona she has honed in public.

Son of a Gun,Key Glock,by: Dean Van Nguyen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5ee8f5b8a9d0807aa56836c1/1:1/w_160/Son%20Of%20A%20Gun_Key%20Glock.jpg,2020-06-23 05:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/key-glock-son-of-a-gun/,Paper Route EMPIRE,"Memphis rapper Key Glock’s music exists in a world where extreme is normal. There’s no artificial binary between realism and mythos—everything feels right on the edge. On his new tape, Son of a Gun, which comes on the heels of February’s Yellow Tape, he offers more autobiographical flashes that span childhood to present day and veer from heartfelt to troubling. While the themes rarely expand beyond growing up, hustling, getting money, and buying ostentatious extravagances, the air-tight focus of his narratives and the richness of his language reveals a writer capable of detailed world building. “Cream” parrots the Wu-Tang Clan’s song of almost the same name. Many have paid tribute to the Clan’s classic, but Glock brings his own self-assurance. Depicting a day in the life of a hustler, the 22-year-old describes rising out of bed, saying his prayers, and immediately counting his money. A declaration like, “Came up out the dirt, now I got diamonds around me” might feel overly worn but Glock balances it with funny wordplay: “And ever since I was ten, my best friend name was Ben/Franklin, nigga, what you thinkin’?” He rarely wanders beyond his narrow field of vision—there’s no room for guest rappers—but Glock’s delivery is confident enough to reinvigorate even the hoariest street-rap cliches. Helping color in Glock’s universe is his unusual taste in beats. Son of a Gun is distinguished by a set of tightly wound instrumentals featuring booming drums, strange samples, and a level of murk that brings a noir atmosphere and high-art sheen to the proceedings. The classical-music sample of “Son of a Gun” and repetitive acoustic riff of “Money Talk” (both served up by frequent collaborator Bandplay) are among the most daring pieces of music Glock has ever spit over, but his flow—identifiably Memphis in its swagger—stays eternally loose, multidimensional, and dripping in a natural confidence that forces every beat to bend to his will. Glock’s most potent showcase yet might well be “Rich Blessed N Savage.” He flows with a natural sense of melody that makes every bar gorgeous to the ear: “Bitch, I ball, it’s necessary/I’m cool as Ben & Jerry/If you don’t like me, blame my parents/Sit down if you can’t stand me.” The next step for this talented young spitter is to add some new colors to his palette, even if just in the form of mild updates to his current formula. Still, by staying fully attentive to the next dollar to be made, the current watch on his wrist, and the impending threat to his well being, Key Glock doubles down on his strengths on Son of a Gun, asserting his position as a singular rising star.","With his gorgeous, cocksure flow and odd ear for beats, the Memphis rapper asserts his position as a singular rising star.

Roy Ayers JID 002,Roy AyersAdrian YoungeAli Shaheed Muhammad,by: Dean Van Nguyen,Contributor,"https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5ee909eea9d0807aa5683765/1:1/w_160/Roy%20Ayers%20JID%20002_Adrian%20Younge,%20Ali%20Shaheed%20Muhammad%20&%20Roy%20Ayers.jpg",2020-06-23 05:00:00,Jazz,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/roy-ayers-adrian-younge-ali-shaheed-roy-ayers-jid-002/,Jazz is Dead,"Adrian Younge never wants you to forget he’s the man behind the music. Whether he is offering a sinister take on Philly soul for The Delfonics' William Hart, serving splatter flick grooves to Ghostface Killah, or even making music with his own soul band, Venice Dawn, the producer and instrumentalist promotes his own mythology as a vanguard of old school grooves by adding the words “Adrian Younge presents…” to the records he helms. Now, there’s the Jazz is Dead series, which sees Younge and Ali Shaheed Muhammad (partners on 2018’s The Midnight Hour) team-up with musicians they admire to record LPs at Younge’s Linear Labs studio in Los Angeles. Released in March, Jazz is Dead 001 acted as an introduction to the project by gathering one song from each future installment, including collaborations with such dignitaries as Marcos Valle, Azymuth, and Brian Jackson. Roy Ayers JID 002 is perhaps the most consequential edition of the endeavor. Yet, it rarely feels like the true jazz legend is operating on the front line. The first question that must be asked is why such an ugly naming system? At 79, Ayers hardly ever records anymore—this is being promoted as his first studio album in 18 years—so any new music attributed to him should be a capital-E event. But by fixing a number to his name, Younge and Muhammad frame the piece as very much their venture. Ayers is credited as co-writing every song and playing his famous vibraphone on seven of the eight cuts, so we can assume he had some agency over the final product. But since fuzzy guitars, low frequency drums, and heavy basslines have long been a staple of Younge’s productions, it’s his fingerprints we see all over Roy Ayers JID 002. And while Ayers’ playing is still smooth and lucious after all these years, his instrumentation is often buried low in the mix. There’s nothing like his 1970s vibraphone-led wanderings like “Mystic Voyage” or “The Third Eye,” and his singing voice never comes to the forefront of the arrangements. Rather than a lost Ayers classic, the album feels more like an interpretation of his music through Younge and Muhammad’s lens. That’s not to say that Roy Ayers JID 002 isn’t a nice listen in its own right. Using Fender Rhodes piano, electric bass, monophonic synthesizers, mellotron, flutes, and many other toys, Muhammad (operating here as an instrumentalist and not the DJ that A Tribe Called Quest fans remember) and Younge forge a stoned and surly suite that incorporates 1970s R&B, psychedelic soul, and West Coast jazz. The borders of each jam are blurry; tracks are allowed to bleed into one another, further imbuing the record with a dream-like quality. There are signposts to Ayers’ past throughout. The most obvious attempt at mimicry is “Synchronized Vibration.” Its soft-filtered grooves, female vocal harmonies, and references to that big star at the center of our solar system hark back to his most famous hit, “Everybody Loves The Sunshine.” Ayers early traditional jazz work is recalled on “Shadows of the East,” while the more propulsive Harlem rhythms of “Solace”—distinguished by Phil Ranelin on trombone, Wendell Harrison on tenor saxophone, and Greg Paul on drums—act as a reminder that Ayers’ Coffy soundtrack was a touch point for Younge’s brilliant work on Blaxploitation spoof Black Dynamite. The album signs off with a kick. “African Sounds” features a spoken word vocal from Younge preaching love, unification, and the memory of historical black struggle: “We have the choice to use our colors and sound to rebound against the hate, to circumvent the illusion seen through the misty shades of America,” he asserts. Ayers’ vibraphone rings in the background, the grandee playing the role of session musician with dignity. And that’s the biggest issue with Roy Ayers JID 002.  Though Younge and Shaheed Muhammad may enjoy casting themselves as career revivalists, Roy Ayers JID 002, as pleasant and groovy as it is, never quite feels like a true Roy Ayers work.","As pleasant and groovy as it is, the collaborative album never feels like a true Roy Ayers work.

Little Dominiques Nosebleed,The Koreatown Oddity,by: Stephen Kearse,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5ef0c68e7bb7acb328d56dfd/1:1/w_160/Little%20Dominques%20Nosebleed_The%20Koreatown%20Oddity.jpg,2020-06-23 05:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/the-koreatown-oddity-little-dominiques-nosebleed/,Stones Throw,"For a decade, Los Angeles rapper and producer The Koreatown Oddity has drifted around the city’s indie-rap scene with a leisurely detachment. Distributing cassette beat tapes by hand, making dusty, stoned records with vaunted producers like Ras G and Jeremiah Jae, and occasionally sporting a wolf mask, he treats rap more like a pastime than a calling. His name, a reference to the neighborhood where he was raised, has always underscored his origins, and his music has tended to be diaristic, capturing his observations, wisecracks, and hijinks in real time. On Little Dominiques Nosebleed, his fourth solo LP, he shifts from scattered journal entries to focused autobiography, telling the story of his family and his neighborhood with intimacy and warmth. Koreatown is central to his story, but he presents it on his terms, subverting the enclave’s current status as a hub for nightlife and haute cuisine. Avoiding the awkward mix of admiration and anointment that tends to paint the 1992 riots that ravaged the neighborhood as a footnote, The Koreatown Oddity treats his namesake as a living, breathing place, embracing the baggage and the cachet. On “Koreatown Oddity,” he recounts standoffs between Korean shop owners and Black residents with a disarming nostalgia: “Riding around with my moms in a riot salute/Terry with the jheri curl tying plastic bags on his shoes/Koreans on the roof/Of the California Mart/With the shotguns ready to shoot.” Compared to Ice Cube’s fury on “Black Korea” and fellow Koreatown native Dumbfoundead’s competing loyalties on “Unplaceable,” The Koreatown Oddity’s version of black and Korean tension feels like a family squabble. Even when it's under siege, his Koreatown belongs to all its residents. On “Kimchi” he expands this idea into a cheeky rundown of Koreatown’s assorted history. Over a thick bassline flecked with whistles and cowbells, he unveils the city beyond the Yelp reviews, citing the neighborhood’s ironic demographics (mostly Latinx), Robert F. Kennedy’s assassination, and gang conflicts. “The place where I be/It ain’t all kimchi,” he summarizes. It’s definitely perverse for a black man to be a tour guide for an Asian community, but The Koreatown Oddity sells it because he’s complicating Koreatown’s narrative rather than rewriting it. His added chapter enriches the saga. This emphasis on landscape and heritage enhances his writing, which feels less scatterbrained than his previous music. He’s still a bit of a rambler, and his rapping is notably less dexterous than usual, but his lumbering flows work well with his vignettes. The album’s best song, the breezy “Weed in LA,” compresses his personal history—from his favorite hill to his dad’s music collection to his mom’s migration from Ohio to California—into a brief verse bookended with an affected ignorance. “I heard they legalized weed in L.A./Oh woooord?” he smirks, making Koreatown feel like the center of the universe. His recollections aren’t always nostalgic. The title tracks detail two childhood car accidents, one leaving him with chronic nosebleeds and the other a broken leg. His production does the heavy lifting on both songs. For “Little Dominiques Nosebleed Part 1”  the arrangements move from triumphant horns to a loungey swing to a sour organ chord as he goes from cruising the streets to suffering in them. You can feel his impression of his home shifting from pleasure to pain. “Little Dominiques Part 2” makes that danger feel ambient. Built around a jagged symphonic loop that buzzes and whirrs like the throne room of a beehive, the song treats the second car accident like an inevitability. The album falters when The Koreatown Oddity goes philosophical. He’s got a spiritual streak that tends toward floofy new ageisms, a habit that short-circuits songs where he attempts to condense his experiences into mantras. Compared to the nuance and keenness that characterize his tales of his home and family, his spiritualism comes across as vague at best (“Chase the Spirit”) and obtuse at worst (“A Bitch Once Told Me”). On “We All Want Something” Anna Wise sings the title, and that’s it; that’s the whole song. Though Little Dominiques Nosebleed doesn’t stick the landing, it’s a rich portrait of place and personhood. The Koreatown Oddity raps about Koreatown like it’s an extension of his body, claiming every crevice and surface of the locale as his own. The specter of gentrification looms over his home, but strangely he seems unfazed. While he can’t repel all the foodies and tourists, he can savor the flavors that aren’t for sale.","On his fourth solo LP, the indie rapper shifts from scattered journal entries to focused autobiography, telling the story of his family and his neighborhood with intimacy and warmth.

Punisher,Phoebe Bridgers,by: Sam Sodomsky,Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5ee923f47bb7acb328d5683d/1:1/w_160/Punisher%20_Phoebe%20Bridgers.jpg,2020-06-22 05:00:00,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/phoebe-bridgers-punisher/,Dead Oceans,"Phoebe Bridgers is a master of collapse. The 25-year-old California native writes songs for those moments when things fall apart, when language fails, when you long for so much distance that you need a spaceship to reach it. From there, she is able to find a sense of purpose, or at least make a plan. “When I get back I’ll lay around/Then I’ll get up and lay back down,” goes a couplet in “I Know the End,” the closing track of her stunning new album Punisher. Across the song’s two halves, she tethers the anxiety of leaving home to a vivid depiction of an actual apocalypse: lightning crashes, fire rises, people scream. “Yeah, I guess the end is here,” she deadpans. Her delivery is light, insistent—the casual tone you use to convey passing thoughts to the closest person in the room. While Punisher is only her second full-length collection as a solo artist, Bridgers has already established a distinct worldview. Her songs can be autobiographical—2017’s “Motion Sickness” bluntly described an emotionally abusive relationship with a since-spurned, one-time mentor—but her writing is too self-aware and wide-ranging to feel confessional. It can be sad, but she is also the first to call bullshit on letting one emotion consume her. It’s why she will infuse a track like this album’s “Moon Song,” an otherwise wistful ballad that takes place at a birthday party, with a banal detail (“It’s nautical themed”) or an outright dismissal of art born from tragedy. “We hate ‘Tears in Heaven,’” she sings of Eric Clapton’s autobiographical, once-inescapable ballad. Then she concedes, “But it’s sad that his baby died.” This impulse toward the candid, the multi-dimensional, has also come to define the sound of Bridgers’ music. Self-produced with Tony Berg and Ethan Gruska, these songs are starkly drawn and colorfully embellished, produced in service of each individual story. Punisher’s first single, “Garden Song,” is a marvel not only for how seamlessly its lyrics bind fantasies and nightmares, burning houses and blooming flowers, but also for how each element of its slyly psychedelic arrangement travels along with her words. The fingerpicked riff is played on a guitar that seems to be dissolving; a low, male voice comes in like a record playing at the wrong speed; a steady pulse seems to rise from somewhere deep in your headphones. Bridgers also writes about this very sensation: the way we hear music, how we devote ourselves to it and form identities around it. On Punisher, these relationships are mostly fraught, from a fan being murdered outside Dodger Stadium to a couple channeling deeper issues through a fight about John Lennon. If music was a pathway toward spiritual catharsis in earlier songs like “Smoke Signals” and “Me & My Dog,” the same drugs don’t work here. Ironically, the most upbeat songs house her bleakest thoughts. “Chinese Satellite,” buoyed by a rushing string arrangement, finds her adrift, desperate for a sign, singing the “same three songs over and over.” And in “Kyoto,” she undercuts a breezy horn section and her most festival-ready chorus by refusing to play along: “I’m a liar,” she sings in its closing line, holding out the syllables so she can’t be misunderstood. Along with her double-tracked vocals and graceful, winding melodies, these conversational refrains bring to mind the work of Elliott Smith, one of Bridgers’ clearest influences. He also happens to be the subject of this album’s heartbreaking title track. Like his classic “St. Ides Heaven,” “Punisher” begins with its narrator wandering around the city after dark: “When the speed kicks in,” she sings, “I go to the store for nothing.” Backed by piano and occasional waves of digital vocal harmony, she contemplates the facts of Smith’s life: the house where he died, his kindness toward fans, the way his songs still bring people together. “If someone doesn’t like his music, I actually feel like I’m not going to agree with them about anything,” she mentioned earlier this year. “It informs everything I like.” It makes sense that she sees in Smith not just a kindred spirit but also an ideology. You can sense Bridgers building a community through her work, and it’s evident in Punisher’s credits list, featuring her tour manager (Jeroen Vrijhoef, the deep voice in “Garden Song”) and her bandmates in other projects (Conor Oberst from Better Oblivion Community Center, Lucy Dacus and Julien Baker from boygenius). She also worked with Blake Mills, Christian Lee Hutson, whose album she produced earlier this year, and Marshall Vore, her drummer and frequent writing partner. Hers is the rare voice that grows more singular through each collaboration, lending her discography the feeling of a continuous narrative—one with increasing depth and a growing cast. While the songs on Punisher might detail the lonesome drudgery of touring (“Why would somebody do this on purpose?”) or the awkwardness of being approached by strangers at bars (“I swear I’m not angry/That’s just my face”), her music never sounds alone. The record glows with this strange self-sufficiency, an instinct to push forward against bad odds. It’s what brings together the depressive homebodies in “Halloween,” the dreamworld romance of “Garden Song,” and the country travelogue of “Graceland Too,” one of her greatest songs yet. Accompanied by banjo and fiddle and her boygenius bandmates, Bridgers sings about a woman re-entering a world that feels unfamiliar, full of horror and possibility. As she gets in the car and turns on the radio, the thought hits her: “She can do anything she wants to.” It’s a daunting proposition, and before she knows where she’s going, she’s on her way.

Kern Vol. 5,Helena Hauff,by: Shawn Reynaldo,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5ee9047ba9d0807aa568372e/1:1/w_160/Kern%20Vol.%205_Helena%20Hauff.jpg,2020-06-22 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/helena-hauff-kern-vol-5/,Tresor,"Kern Vol. 5 is not a subtle record. That’s not Helena Hauff’s style. The German DJ didn’t earn her accolades by playing it safe. True to her roots—Hauff got her start as a resident at Hamburg’s grungy (and much loved) Golden Pudel Club—she prefers to smash things up, usually with a blistering mix of hard-edged electro, industrial, techno, acid, and post-punk that’s light on nuance, heavy on distortion, and devastatingly effective on the dancefloor. As a producer, Hauff has distilled her bleak vision into numerous cassettes, EPs, and a couple of albums, the most recent being 2018’s Qualm, on Ninja Tune. Yet it’s in the DJ booth that she truly thrives, cutting an imposing, often leather-clad figure while holding court with a box of scuzzy vinyl, a take-no-bullshit attitude, and a cigarette permanently jutting out the side of her mouth. Over the past decade, she’s dropped plenty of mixes online, but Kern Vol. 5 is the first time she’s linked up with vaunted Berlin techno institution Tresor, whose Kern series has previously featured iconoclasts like DJ Hell, Objekt, and DJ Stingray. Though Kern Vol. 5 clocks in at 132 minutes, the mix comes barreling out of the gate and screams along at 150 bpm for the next two hours. It’s an intense (and occasionally punishing) listen, although Hauff explained in a recent interview with The Face that the long runtime was due in part to the logistical challenges of life as an all-vinyl DJ: “I had to get the [unreleased] tracks pressed onto dubplates—but then I realised that I’d picked a lot of mad tracks that are really difficult to mix, so it ended up being really, really long.” Hauff is known as a digger, with an ear for corroded machine rhythms that rivals that of celebrated reissue outposts like Dark Entries, Minimal Wave, and Mannequin, and Kern Vol. 5 is populated with obscure gems like “City of Boom,” a dynamic 2004 cut from Detroit duo DJ Godfather & DJ Starski, and “Intellectual Killer,” a snarling bit of nosebleed-inducing gabber from Australian outfit Nasenbluten—their name, in fact, is German for “nosebleed”—that samples ’90s horrorcore rap trio Gravediggaz and contains the colorful lyric, “Roping up the devils/Have ’em hanging from my testicles.” The mix’s dominant sound, however, is electro, and though Hauff pulls more or less equally from new and old tunes, she tends to favor an industrial-tinged variant of the genre that relies heavily on gnarled synths, viciously snapping syncopations, and a sci-fi sound palette. Like most mix compilations, Kern Vol. 5 features a handful of exclusive tracks—all of which appear as part of a triple-vinyl package that also includes select cuts from the mix—including the nightmarish “Segment 3,” which Hauff cooked up herself alongside Greek artist Morah. Arriving in the set’s relentless middle section, it has all the warmth of a threshing machine, but it’s only a few songs later that Hauff begins to lighten things up. The tempo stays high, but she gradually swaps out industrial crunch for cosmic swirl—think Creme Organization instead of Bunker Records—and hits a high note with the pairing of “Starless Night,” a soaring exclusive from veteran French producer Umwelt, and “Pinwheel,” an acid-licked epic from Shinra. Despite the mix’s (slightly) more melodic turn in the closing 40 minutes, Kern Vol. 5 isn’t for the faint of heart; it’s definitely not a soothing quarantine companion. Hauff has always been the sort of DJ who’s more likely to deliver a kick to the ribs than a pat on the head, and she’s stuck to her rowdy impulses here. Running her gauntlet isn’t easy, but it is invigorating, and with clubs and festivals on indefinite pause around the globe, Kern Vol. 5 is a welcome reminder of just how thrilling a good battering on the dancefloor can be.","In a mix for Berlin nightclub Tresor’s mix series, the Hamburg DJ doles out more than two hours of industrial-tinged techno and electro, all delivered with her typically punishing panache.

Planet’s Mad,Baauer,by: Dani Blum ,Contributor ,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5eebc09fdc55f46b46323685/1:1/w_160/Baauer_PlanetsMad.jpg,2020-06-22 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/baauer-planets-mad/,LuckyMe,"For a moment, the image was everywhere: the most famous teenager in music, sticking out her tongue and unfurling a shirt reading “No music on a dead planet.” The specter of climate change haunts modern pop: Billie Eilish and Lana Del Rey croon about fires in Los Angeles, Grimes embraces global destruction, the 1975 shout “fossil fueling masturbation.” Of course the crisis trickled into festival-core electronica—possibly the genre best equipped to depict the throb and disarray of a decaying world. On his new album, Planet’s Mad, “Harlem Shake” producer Baauer again tries to outrun one-hit-wonder status, this time using battering-ram drums and dancefloor fracas to soundtrack planetary destruction. The clumsy twist is that Baauer means it literally: Through a set of accompanying videos and forced sonic cues, he attempts to convey the tale of a rogue planet crashing into Earth, filling our world with aliens looking to party. The conceit works when the songs evoke chaos, tangling up tightly controlled instrumentals into an all-out mash. On the title track, sirens wind and screech as the beat builds; a bassline reminiscent of James Bond plunges into thwacking drums. For a producer who gravitates towards trap and tropical house, it’s startlingly guitar-heavy, and the instrumental gnarl creates a lively vision of dystopia—all bang, no whimper. “Aether” erupts in frenetic hi-hats and titanic bass, the notes sounding like muted, glitching screams as they spiral and leap. “Cool One Seven One” opens on a smattering of laughter, climbing with the chatter of a faraway crowd, until the steadily ticking beat and flurry of beeps crescendo in the kind of bassline that blows out speakers. This isn’t necessarily club fodder, but Baauer retains the cavernous bass and drum shuffles that played well at frat parties and proms; most of these tracks have the power to wobble through your body. The sci-fi narrative disrupts this flow, though, and the interruptions of Baauer’s robot narrator are grating. “Tempo has reached critical level,” says a monotone announcer in “Cool One Seven One.” “This is an emergency.” “Rhythm… sound… rhythm… sound,” a glitchy voice repeats on “Hot 44,” only abating after an avalanche of a beat drop. Countering these are the presumably human voices Baauer employs when his songs soften and slow, a device that only emphasizes how jarring all the beeps and buzzes are. At the end of “Planck,” a mournful sigh floats over a synth; on “Pizzawalla,” one of the few moments the album lurches towards hip-hop, a prayer-like vocal undulates over a wispy chord before getting chopped up over the drums. Baauer’s last album was stacked with features, including a Future and Pusha T. collab and an M.I.A. banger. On Planet’s Mad, the only guest vocalist is English singer Bipolar Sunshine, who’s best known for crooning on DJ Snake’s diet trop-house hit “The Middle.” “The pain is too strong to hold in,” he cries through AutoTune on “Home.” “I’m on my way, so don’t change your pin.” It’s a sterile, palatable pop song that feels jarringly out of place; it doesn’t make sense in the flimsy alien chronicle, and musically it has nothing to do with the clanging bedlam that animates the rest of the album. Baauer has been pointedly self-aware about his work in the past (he once said he “hated” “Harlem Shake”), but his latest songs are too jittery and goofy to land. Planet’s Mad careens through its bungled cyber narrative, tingling and whirring, daring you not to take it seriously. The planet warms, the pop stars reel, and we’re still trying to dance.","With battering-ram drums and cavernous bass, the producer’s second album is a high-energy drama about planetary destruction that almost dares you not to take it seriously.

Shadow Offering,Braids,by: Arielle Gordon,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5ee8fce57bb7acb328d56831/1:1/w_160/Shadow%20Offering_Braids.jpg,2020-06-22 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/braids-shadow-offering/,Secret City,"Braids’ fourth full-length was inspired by a solar eclipse, a phenomena that provides a neat metaphor for frontwoman Raphaelle Standell-Preston’s voice—at once dark and luminescent, fleeting and slightly dangerous. Over the course of their existence, the Montreal trio have evolved from a low-key synth-pop group into a daring orchestral ensemble, and Standell-Preston’s singing has led the way. With each record, the group further excavates the powerful clarity in her broad vocal range, treating it with a lighter touch and greater space. Aided by producer and Death Cab for Cutie guitarist Chris Walla, the band continues to expand their once-restrained electronic palette. On “Upheaval II,” they lean into the funk of the electric guitar, its low register a grounding foil for Standell-Preston’s vocal acrobatics. When songs include swarming synths, they’re for texture, not shape: “Just Let Me” layers them atop a steady foundation of piano before letting them fall to the background as a shimmering guitar arpeggio takes hold. Standell-Preston reserves her falsetto for sudden moments of grandeur, using her clear, full-throated vibrato to lend direction to the band’s more ambient passages. If 2015’s Deep in the Iris was a departure from the lighter fare of their early releases, Shadow Offering is the start of a new chapter, one robust enough to hold the intense emotions in their lyrics. There’s a fiercely diaristic quality to the songwriting on Shadow Offering, an outpouring of grandiose metaphors rooted in personal experiences. On “Eclipse (Ashley),” Standell-Preston pairs images of the sun’s eclipse with the entirely earthly experience of self-actualization. It’s a relatable contrast, reflecting the human inclination to filter even rare astronomical events through the lens of personal milestones. Many of the songs center on Standell-Preston’s fraught relationship with men, moving from abstracted figurative language about a troubled relationship on “Just Let Me” to the entirely literal expression of anguish on “Fear of Men.” Her honest writing can make even well-trodden topics, which encapsulates most of the record, seem bright and novel. The confidence with which she discusses her poor taste in men on “Young Buck”—“Young buck 22-year-old who treats me badly/ The blaring example of what I am drawn towards/ And should strongly move away from”—would be funny, if the experience of doomed relationships weren’t so resonant. However, Standell-Preston’s stream-of-consciousness honesty buckles under the weight of larger societal injustices. On the 9-minute epic “Snow Angel,” her enunciation sharpens as she rattles off buzzwords with the outsized confidence of an amateur slam poet: “Fake news and indoctrination/Closed borders and deportations.” She questions her own position in the oppression of others—“Am I only just realizing the injustice that exists/Cloaked in white privilege since the day I was born”—before returning to platitudes about global crises, conjuring images of polar bears on ice floes and young people glued to social media. It’s not that Braids are incapable of canny political commentary—”Miniskirt,” their glorious slow-burner from Deep In The Iris, built its power from explicitly calling out rape culture through personal anecdotes. But these shallow, unstructured critiques of hegemonic systems come across as ignorant, and, at worst, narcissistic, like an ayahuasca trip gone horribly wrong. Braids underwent a small reckoning with their own privilege in 2018 after former bandmate Katie Lee accused the band of performative allyship; “Snow Angel” comes across as a tone-deaf response, in which white guilt and self-hatred smother any possibility of genuine engagement. While it’s hard to argue that Shadow Offering redeems itself from the bizarre ramblings of “Snow Angel,” it can perhaps be cordoned off as a misstep along the pathway to embracing maximalism. The remaining record reflects the band’s continued emphasis on Standell-Preston’s striking vibrato and range, the inclusion of more acoustic instrumentation fitting of the vacillations in her singing. Like U.S. Girls’ Heavy Light, Shadow Offering evokes excess and mania with the hip-swinging rhythms of funk and new wave, packing each inch of the record with small inflections layered for the greatest possible impact. The band’s effusiveness often feels torrential, which makes its more inane moments come off as collateral damage. On Shadow Offering, Braids isn’t afraid to steer dangerously close to the eye of the storm.","On their fourth album, the Montreal trio begins a new chapter, one robust enough to hold the intense emotions in frontwoman Raphaelle Standell-Preston’s vocals.

Maggot Brain,Funkadelic,by: Dave Segal,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5ee90b8b7bb7acb328d5683a/1:1/w_160/Maggot%20Brain_Funkadelic.jpg,2020-06-21 05:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/funkadelic-maggot-brain/,Westbound,"Inside the gatefold of vinyl copies of Maggot Brain is an excerpt from an article about the concept of fear, published in a magazine by the Process Church of the Final Judgment, a religious sect founded in England in the mid-’60s. Its thesis: “Fear is at the root of man’s destruction of himself.... Do we know the extent to which we are at war with one another—on every level from personal to world wide [sic]—because we are afraid?” That’s some heavy shit for a funk band to be dropping on folks, but Funkadelic mastermind George Clinton harbored an iconoclastic streak. While his fledgling ’60s band the Parliaments tried to adapt to Motown Records impresario Berry Gordy’s preference for matching suits, synchronized dances, and well-crafted vocal harmonies, they failed to make the cut. In his 2014 autobiography, Brothas Be, Yo Like George, Ain’t That Funkin’ Kind of Hard on You?, Clinton observed that Gordy deemed the Parliaments as too similar to Motown artists the Temptations and the Contours, and their wildly varying heights struck the label boss as too odd. Ultimately, this rejection was for the best, as Clinton’s imagination was sprouting in ways too strange for Motown, as manifested in Funkadelic’s first three albums. With the freedom afforded by Armen Boladian’s Westbound Records, Clinton proceeded to create a sonic and lyrical universe that placed equal importance on moving minds and bodies in unprecedented ways. If that meant immersing listeners in unconventional thoughts about fear or triggering meditations about world destruction, then the headstrong bandleader had enough faith in his audience to handle his bold blend of the pleasure principle with eschatological matters. Though the Process Church dogma took up a quarter of the gatefold’s layout and imbued the record with a gravity, it wasn’t necessarily essential for analyzing and enjoying Maggot Brain’s merits. In fact, in a 2006 interview with Wax Poetics, Funkadelic bassist Billy Nelson said that he held no truck with the religion’s allegedly Satanic doctrines—nor, for that matter, with the grotesque cover art featuring a screaming Black woman buried in a mound of maggot-laden dirt, with the back cover revealing simply a skull. “That’s George [Clinton] sabotaging us again,” Nelson lamented. Defending the Process Church in Brothas, Clinton described its ethos as “a form of self-actualization.” He would delve further into its thinking on Maggot Brain’s 1972 follow-up, America Eats Its Young. But this was an ephemeral phase in Clinton’s artistic life, and secondary to the revolutionary sounds he and his bandmates were creating. Funkadelic’s self-titled debut LP (1970) and the same year’s Free Your Mind And Your Ass Will Follow proved that Clinton and company were adept at penning hook-laden soul nuggets, “wayback yonder funk,” gully blues-rock, sinister gospeldelia, and freak-flag-flying jams. By the time they entered Detroit’s United Sound Systems in late 1970 to record their third full-length, Maggot Brain, they’d honed their myriad styles to a raw-nerved peak. For a group rumored to record while zonked out of their minds, Funkadelic really held it together on Maggot Brain. They may not have been as tight as James Brown’s backing band the J.B.’s, but Clinton, Nelson, keyboardist Bernie Worrell, guitarists Eddie Hazel and Tawl Ross, and drummer Tiki Fulwood had cohered into a fearsome unit. Perhaps the most distinctive thing about Maggot Brain is its incomparable bookends: The opener “Maggot Brain” and closer “Wars of Armageddon” are the most evocative expressions of birth and annihilation ever put on record. In the former, Funkadelic plunges into the dank throes of an existential quandary, as Clinton intones, “Mother Earth is pregnant for the third time/For y’all have knocked her up/I have tasted the maggots in the mind of the universe/I was not offended/For I knew I had to rise above it all/Or drown in my own shit.” Clinton really knew how to rivet attention and prep you for the journey of a lifetime. The mythos surrounding this 10-minute epic is extraordinary. Clinton claimed that he and Hazel were tripping hard, and then the bandleader told his guitarist to play like his mother had died. Realizing that Eddie had executed a world-historical solo, Clinton decided to excise most of the other players’ contributions from the track and then “Echoplexed everything back on itself four or five times,” as he noted in Brothas. “I could see the guitar notes stretch out like a silver web.” (An alternate take with all the instruments intact appears as a bonus track on a 2005 CD reissue of Maggot Brain, and in retrospect, you can’t argue with Clinton’s decision. The keyboards, bass, and drums are fine, but they impinge enough on Hazel’s wizardry to be distracting.) This solo—with its solarized, distraught wails, smooth dive bombs, and shattered-crystal grace notes—occupies the loftiest perch in the guitar-hero pantheon. How can something so mournful fill you with so much life? It was perverse of Clinton to place such an elegiac show-stopper at the beginning, but in the early ’70s, perversity was the man’s lifeblood. Conventional wisdom in those days involved starting albums with the most instantly appealing song; instead, Clinton opened with amplified and warped chewing sounds and a lysergic monologue about planetary impregnation and cranial infestation. Out of such grotesque imagery, Clinton and Hazel alchemized heavenly beauty. If “Maggot Brain,” is the album’s yin, “Wars of Armageddon” is its yang. Right from the start, Funkadelic unfurl a maelstrom of angst: explosions, crying baby, grouchy dad, protesters chanting for freedom—all of it accompanied by a surfeit of cowbell, bongos, and organ. The track’s chthonic thrust and swagger foreshadowed Miles Davis’ later fusion masterpieces On the Corner and Dark Magus. As it turned out, Miles so loved the drumming here that he temporarily stole Fulwood from Clinton. Clinton may have been an avid druggie in Funkadelic’s early years, but his mind was highly attuned to the outré music, anti-war sentiments, class struggles, and free-love mores of the time. All of his thoughts and feelings cohered to a potent degree in “Wars of Armageddon.” In the song’s final third, we hear more chants (“More power to the people/More pussy to the power/More pussy to the people”) and some nasty animal and bodily function sounds as the music continues to wildly carom. This is Funkadelic’s ultimate freakout experience, their “Sister Ray” and their “Helter Skelter” rolled into an acid-rock/musique concrète journey to the center of a blown mind. Toward the end, Clinton mutters, “Goddamn/Look at that pollution!/It’s a fat funky person” amid the sound of distant explosions. The music may signify end times, but he can’t help facing catastrophe with a prankster’s devil-may-care blitheness. Between these towering extremes, Funkadelic wheeled out the sort of soulful funk-rock that could fuel world-class parties. It would be hard to name a hotter five-song streak in the Clinton canon than that which flows from “Can You Get to That” to “Back in Our Minds Again.” The former is actually a remake of the Parliaments’ “What You Been Growing,” and when this ditty ambles into earshot after the desolate “Maggot Brain,” it feels as if your entire extended family’s swarming you with good vibes at your surprise birthday party. Funkadelic lay down sun-fatigued funk with intricate female/male vocal interplay, including Ray Davis’ basso profundo interjections and the harmonizing of Isaac Hayes’ backing singers Pat Lewis, Dianne Lewis, and Rose Williams. In Brothas, Clinton claims that the metaphor of “When you base your love on credit/...insufficient funds” for troubled social or romantic relationships was lifted from Martin Luther King Jr.’s “I Have a Dream” speech. It was a new twist on an old sentiment, one that would be further manipulated by time and genre in Sleigh Bells’ “Rill Rill.” Sleigh Bells’ sample was not the only example of Funkadelic’s early material resonating with white artists from the ’80s to the ’00s; musicians as diverse as the Balancing Act, Mike Watt and J. Mascis, and Red Hot Chili Peppers, among others, have covered Funkadelic songs. In Brothas, Clinton noted that in their early years Funkadelic were too Black for most rock kids and too white for most funk and soul aficionados. But it was exactly this in-between-ness that generated the essential friction of their music, the X-factor that lent it its heady allure and unusual durability. Contemporaries working in similar modes such as Sly & the Family Stone, the Chambers Brothers, and War—all of whom were multiracial groups—had found the key to crossover success. But as an all-Black rock unit, Funkadelic struggled to achieve more than cult status in their heyday, even if some of their releases scraped the lower reaches of the charts. Upon its release, Maggot Brain was too strange for most music consumers to grasp. Even in their Detroit homebase, Funkadelic couldn’t catch a break with the city’s AOR radio outlets. Over the decades, however, the album’s guitar heroics, relentless grooves, and cavalier hooks have infiltrated their way into more receptive minds. Listening to the staccato “Hit It and Quit It,” you can understand why those early-’70s listeners would be perplexed. Keyboard prodigy Worrell unfurls Keith Emersonian burbles and proggy flourishes alien to the funk genre at the time. Revealing Funkadelic’s democratic nature with regard to singers (a ploy that may have hindered their ability to break through commercially, as there was no dedicated frontman), Clinton allowed Worrell to sing his skinny ass off amid a libidinous landslide of guitar riffs and basslines. “Hit It” ranks as one of the filthiest lust songs ever to stoke a libido. Another example of Funkadelic’s egalitarian microphone policy, “You and Your Folks, Me and My Folks” is sung by Billy Nelson; the track exudes the air of a communal Sly & the Family Stone anthem, but imbued with the menace of the Manson Family, with the bass/drums groove ranking as one of the most lethal in the Funkadelic canon. Despite the sinister aura, the song is a plea for equality and understanding among all people. For what it’s worth, “You and Your Folks” is the most-sampled track on Maggot Brain (11 times), and Alabama Shakes singer-songwriter Brittany Howard covered it on 2020’s Spotify Singles. In a 1985 issue of Spin, P-Funk professor emeritus Greg Tate dubbed “Super Stupid” a “heavy-metal hydrogen bomb test”; it’s no wonder heavies such as Audioslave and Big Chief took stabs at it. This is mercilessly vicious rock that attracted the attention and respect of British rock royalty when Funkadelic first toured England. Clinton claims David Bowie, Rod Stewart, and members of Cream, the Beatles and Led Zeppelin checked them out on that jaunt. “Super Stupid”’s metallic guitar avalanche is tempered by Worrell’s circus-y keyboard effusions, but the real star is Hazel, who is on fire in extremis, both on ax and vox. “Super Stupid” warns of the foolishness of drug abuse (Worrell claimed in Wax Poetics that band members were snorting heroin) while, incidentally, making you want to take drugs. Following the release of Maggot Brain, Hazel and Nelson split to work for the vastly more popular Motown act the Temptations, reportedly due to dissatisfaction with Clinton’s handling of the band’s financial situation. Fulwood also was disgruntled about pay and left Funkadelic. Although Clinton doesn’t mention this issue in Brothas, the Wax Poetics interviews feature complaints about George’s stinginess. Ross, too, departed, after alleged misadventures with either LSD or speed. These painful losses were ameliorated by the additions of Bootsy and Catfish Collins, Garry Shider, and Boogie Mosson—all world-class funkateers. Nevertheless, Funkadelic never again released an album as laden with genius as Maggot Brain. It was the culmination of their first phase’s most outrageous and ingenious sonic ideas, establishing a new precedent for how Black musicians would exist in a rock context, juxtaposing metal, gospel, prog, funk, blues, and jazz fusion with nonchalant virtuosity. It’s the epitome of their extravagant virtues and vices. Summarizing the LP in Brothas, Clinton wrote, “Maggot Brain was going places that Black groups hadn’t gone, into questions about whether America was still on the right path or whether the promise of the late ’60s had completely evaporated.” In these seven songs, you can hear Funkadelic attempting to make sense of the turmoil of the times, as they express the euphoria and anguish of being born and dying in the most extraordinary ways.","Each Sunday, Pitchfork takes an in-depth look at a significant album from the past, and any record not in our archives is eligible.

Tearless,Amnesia Scanner,by: Chal Ravens,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5ed80af7d5f4a1d8ae15fbc2/1:1/w_160/Tearless_Amnesia%20Scanner.jpg,2020-06-20 05:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/amnesia-scanner-tearless/,Pan,"With a pandemic raging and the planet warming, it can feel like “we are all now stuck in a science-fiction novel that we're writing together,” suggests Kim Stanley Robinson, a man who knows a thing or two about speculative fiction. In a widely shared New Yorker article from May, the writer confronted the possibility that our present-day scenario is every bit as strange as one of his Martian stories. The boundary between reality and fantasy has been breached. Finnish electronic duo Amnesia Scanner have been monitoring the situation for some time, and on their second LP, they sound less optimistic than ever. Before their debut album came out in 2018, Amnesia Scanner were anonymous. The project left behind a breadcrumb trail of cryptic music videos and mixtapes, starting with 2014’s AS LIVE [][][][][], and helped sketch out the idea of “deconstructed club music”: harsh, angsty, and heavily compressed, with scraps of pop, techno, and dembow knotted into fractured melodies and nu-metal squall. With the release of Another Life, their air of mystery evaporated, but Amnesia Scanner have continued to be apocalyptic, above all else. Tearless, according to Ville Haimala and Martti Kalliala, the Berlin-based musicians behind the project, is their “breakup album with the planet.” Along with recent work from Oneohtrix Point Never, ANOHNI, and Grimes, the record grapples with life in the Anthropocene era and the awareness of humanity’s irreversible impact on its only home. Amnesia Scanner aren’t the kind of guys you’d find wearing “End Is Nigh” sandwich boards and shouting into megaphones about solar flares; until now, they could even have been accused of taking a perverse pleasure in watching the world burn, choosing to rave through chaos rather than fight to put out the flames. Now, though, the mood has soured. Where Another Life felt bright and alert, shimmying towards oblivion like lemmings in a conga line, Tearless is burned out and overwhelmed. This is ugly music, even at its most melodic. The shadow of nu-metal and hardcore hangs over tracks like “Flat,” a collaboration with metalcore act Code Orange, where busted electronic drums and shredded guitars recall Deftones and Nine Inch Nails. On “AS Tearless” a chant-along punk riff is torn to pieces by distortion. There’s no air, no light. A brief interlude, “Call of the Center,” informs us in crackling robotic tones that we’re “approaching the center of the labyrinth.” Voices, including those of Brazilian DJ and producer Lyzza and Peruvian artist Lalita, are processed to sound steely and serrated, slicing through the mix like a logger’s chainsaw. These artists appear at the album’s poppiest peaks: Lalita bluffs her way through heartbreak on the operatic “AS Acá” (“I feel like the pain of losing you doesn’t affect me,” she sings in Spanish), and Lyzza’s voice is shattered into iron filings on “AS Going.” (Lyrically, there’s nothing more than hints at the end-of-days theme.) Aside from those sharply focused highlights, and a brief climax of power chords and blast beats on “AS Labyrinth,” the atmosphere is claggy and subdued. Tearless ends as it began, in slow, exhausted strides. “You will be fine if we can help you lose your mind,” sings a distorted, uncredited voice on the final track, a lighters-in-the-air lament for the party at the end of the world. What could be darker, and more euphoric? With clubs and festivals on hold in the wake of the pandemic, Tearless will not be presented as the live audiovisual extravaganza that Amnesia Scanner had planned for it. That’s a shame, because their music is designed to be heard at a deafening volume, offloaded in huge slabs to trigger a seismic event on the dancefloor. But as a quiet killer scythes through populations, and as a dozen more undiscovered species disappear from the Earth forever, such an anticlimax is fitting. Kim Stanley Robinson might agree. His second novel, The Memory of Whiteness, promises a fantastical instrument which allows music to flow directly from a master player’s thoughts into reality, thereby cracking open the secrets of the universe. The novel is set in 3229. There’s something to look forward to.","The Finnish duo’s deconstructed club music grapples with life in the Anthropocene, drawing from nu-metal and hardcore in songs that feel burned out and overwhelmed.

Reality Tunnels,Pinch,by: Shawn Reynaldo,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5ee92b7ddc55f46b4632348e/1:1/w_160/Reality%20Tunnels_Pinch.jpg,2020-06-20 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/pinch-reality-tunnels/,Tectonic,"When Pinch’s Reality Tunnels was announced last month, many headlines focused on the fact that it was Bristol producer Rob Ellis’ first new solo album in 13 years. That’s a long time for any genre, but by electronic music standards, it’s a lifetime. When he released Underwater Dancehall back in 2007—incredibly, the same week as Burial’s seminal Untrue—dubstep was still in full bloom, and the genre was only just beginning to open up and give way to what is now commonly (and frustratingly) referred to as bass music. As imperfect as the term “bass music” may be—especially when it is often used as a catch-all for a wide variety of disparate sounds and styles, most of them with roots in Black cultures from around the globe—there’s no question that Pinch has been one of the genre’s most reliable protagonists. Although he hasn’t released another Pinch LP since his debut, he’s proven to be a remarkably versatile low-end specialist, dropping collaborative albums with Shackleton and dub legend Adrian Sherwood while issuing dozens of solo EPs and building his Tectonic label into a trusted platform for all things bass. Reality Tunnels is an attempt to synthesize the various parts of Ellis’ career into a single, coherent work. The album takes its name from a concept put forth in Robert Anton Wilson’s 1983 book Prometheus Rising—the author famously described it as an “owner’s manual for the human brain”—which posits that human beings apply subjective filters (“reality tunnels”) to the world around them, giving rise to our individual beliefs, values, and behaviors. In the context of the LP, Ellis sees each track as a different reality tunnel, a portal into a specific corner of his musical universe. At its best, this makes for some incredible music. Lead single “Accelerated Culture” is an over-caffeinated bass-techno banger that’s on par with anything that Bristol’s celebrated younger generation of producers (e.g. Hodge, Batu, Bruce) is doing. Also impressive are “All Man Got,” a sludgy bit of dubstep with a live vocal turn from veteran grime MC Trim, and “Party,” a mutant dancehall stalker ominously voiced by Killa P—the horns on that one are downright regal. Those tunes are all in Ellis’ bass-heavy wheelhouse, but he steps far outside his comfort zone to deliver one of the album’s best tracks. “Back to Beyond” is a sumptuous piece of ambient with lush strings, angelic vocal choirs, and devotional overtones; electronic music fans often jokingly refer to the club as “church,” but this song wouldn’t be out of place inside an actual house of worship. Unfortunately, not all the experiments on Reality Tunnels are successful, particularly when guest singers are involved. Album opener “Entangled Particles” is essentially an updated take on Bristol’s trip-hop legacy, complete with jungle flourishes and Ellis’ signature industrial-strength low end, but Emika’s vocals drag the proceedings too far into pop territory; what’s left is the the kind of song that might come on during an especially dramatic scene of whatever foreign crime drama you’re currently binge-watching on Netflix. Then there’s “The Last One,” which features Greenlandic folk singer-songwriter Nive Neilsen; with its melancholy vocals and gently strummed guitar, it strives for Mezzanine-era Massive Attack, but winds up sounding more like Mazzy Star. On its own merits, it’s not a bad bit of fuzzy grunge-pop, but on a Pinch album, it’s something of a non-sequitur. Ellis does manage to tap into some classic Massive Attack vibes on “Change Is a Must,” which melds gurgling dub rhythms with the soulful lament of Jamaican singer Inezi; it’s more Blue Lines than Mezzanine, but the song is sure to satiate anyone who’s looking for some Bristolian trip-hop magic. Still, it’s difficult to hail the song as essential. Despite the diversity of Ellis’ output over the years, he’s always been an artist who fearlessly pushes music into the future, even as he’s referencing the past. His new album is obviously meant to be a more personal record, but in throwing out his usual rulebook, Ellis seems to have inadvertently wound up splitting the difference between nostalgia and innovation. What’s left is a scattered effort, and one can only wonder what Reality Tunnels might have sounded like if Ellis hadn’t followed so many of them down such sentimental pathways.","Thirteen years after his debut album helped open up new possibilities for UK bass music, the Bristol fixture returns with an LP meant to probe the various corners of his musical universe.

South Somewhere Else,Nana Grizol,by: Ashley Bardhan,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5ee9294fca5f171c3b76ffbf/1:1/w_160/South%20Somewhere%20Else_Nana%20Grizol.jpg,2020-06-20 05:00:00,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/nana-grizol-south-somewhere-else/,ArrowhawkDon Giovanni,"Theo Hilton started Nana Grizol in 2007 as a way to express his anxiety as a young gay man in Athens, Georgia. Since then, Nana Grizol has released four albums, all unified in their jangle-pop sound and themes of queerness and American ennui. Their newest album, South Somewhere Else, is similar—it’s equally scrappy, with warbling vocals and booming brass band—but now, Hilton seems to be preoccupied with his own whiteness. On South Somewhere Else, he explores his individual identity within the greater American framework of violent white history. Considering its topic of choice, the album sounds fairly chipper. Guitars bounce around, distorted and messy, and Hilton has a snotty delivery that makes everything sound like a speech he was forced to give in front of his middle-school gym class. “Plantation Country” bursts with crashing cymbals and a shrieking trumpet while Hilton muses on, well, our plantation country, the “beauty that disguises violence,” white complicity in its “soft, insipid silence.” It’s hard to define the mood of this—Is Hilton angry? Ashamed? Or is he just recounting the facts as they stand? His lyrics are often verbose and vague, which prevents some of words from packing a punch in the way he might wish. You can hear parallels to  bands like P.S. Eliot, white bands defined by their small-town experiences, singing about the insecurities and dissatisfactions that plague everyone. For many non-white listeners, myself included, the appeal of these bands lies in the universality of the emotions, but there is still the issue of place and skin. This makes his reckoning on South Somewhere Else welcome, if a little obscure. He wonders about the “comfort in the dream of simple pasts” and asks himself if he finds accountability “too tough to task.” As listeners, do we feel bad for him here? Are we meant to be glad for the white Americans who find solace in rewritten history? Just as the image of a beautiful, bloody plantation conjures up “aggressions/in the answers that evade the questions,” it’s difficult to know where Hilton stands beside sunshine-y guitar and hard-to-parse lyrics. On the title track, Hilton makes his feelings more explicit. “It was assumed that the South was a thing that took place somewhere else,” he sings, his lilting voice bouncing on top of toe-tapping piano, like he’s talking over beers at his hometown bar. He visits relatives who “couldn’t quite tell” you about your hometown’s history; he gazes out at the “Jim Crow geographies” that “haunt all of the streetscapes we’d come to know well.” This is when Nana Grizol is best. The production is joyous, but a little embarrassed about feeling so. Hilton’s words are precise, and makes it clear that the only reason that the racism and white supremacism of the South felt like it was somewhere else was because the band itself is white. Hilton says it plainly, while tracking his story through “all white restaurants,” that maybe the South was somewhere else, “we weren’t noticing where power was held/Captivated, the capitol’s … white liberal logics prevailed.” And they will prevail, unless white Americans are willing to concede their faults, their obliviousness, and their history, as Hilton does here. “About the Purpose That We Serve” is one of the album’s most raucous moments, but still self-consciously so. It feels like Hilton is aiming his displeasure at white people or liberals, offering “Some food for thought, one just might choke on what they’re given/There’s so, so many voices—look around and you’ve got choices — but the/Angle’s always altered for convenience.” It’s impossible to deny the timeliness of this sentiment. We have a government that refuses to care for its people, an indoctrinated population that believes what the government gives them is all that they deserve, and everyone else marching in the street, getting shot, maimed, or killed occasionally for not being like the others. But this album isn’t a protest album. It’s an admission of privilege and of history, and an often catchy, summer-y one at that. Hilton ends the album sarcastically, facetiously instructing that “You’ve got no way of knowing/So leave it to the ones who do/Be it a priest or politician/Know it’s never you.” That’s how the ruling class wants you to feel, isn’t it? That the South is somewhere else, that you’re not smart enough, not strong enough, not white enough, or rich enough to do anything that could change anyone’s life. But the South is here, and so are you.","The jangle-pop band’s latest is a deceptively cheery-sounding reckoning with the violence of white American history.

Rough and Rowdy Ways,Bob Dylan,by: Sam Sodomsky,Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5ee8ed625bc183ff21e40b9c/1:1/w_160/Rough%20and%20Rowdy%20Ways_Bob%20Dylan.jpg,2020-06-18 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/bob-dylan-rough-and-rowdy-ways/,Columbia,"For 60 years, Bob Dylan has been speaking to us. Sometimes breathless, often inscrutable, occasionally prophetic, his words have formed a mythology unto themselves. But his silence holds just as much meaning. Less than a minute into his 39th album, which he has decided to call Rough and Rowdy Ways, the accompaniment seems to fade. It’s a subtle drop; there wasn’t much there in the first place—a muted string ensemble, a soft pedal steel, some funereal motifs from classical and electric guitars. It’s the same twilight atmosphere that comprised Dylan’s last three studio albums, a faithful trilogy of American standards once popularized by Frank Sinatra. But now he’s singing his own words, and about himself. He compares himself to Anne Frank and Indiana Jones, says he says he’s a painter and a poet, confesses to feeling restless, tender, and unforgiving. “I contain a-multituuudes,” he croons, to anybody who hasn’t realized by now. The rest of the album follows this thread: furnished with more space than his words require, sung gracefully at the age of 79, speaking to things we know to be true, using proper nouns and first-hand evidence. In other words, it is the rare Dylan album that asks to be understood, that comes down to meet its audience. In these songs, death is not a heavy fog hanging over all walks of life; it is a man being murdered as the country watches, an event with a time, place, and date. And love is not a Shakespearean riddle or a lusty joke; it is a delicate pact between two people, something you make up your mind and devote yourself to. “The lyrics are the real thing, tangible, they’re not metaphors,” Dylan told the New York Times. So when he sings about crossing the Rubicon, he’s talking about a river in Italy; when he tells you he’s going down to Key West, he wants you to know he’s dressing for the weather. Still, he is Bob Dylan, and we are trained to dig deeper. (In that same Times interview, he is asked whether the coronavirus could be seen as a biblical reckoning—a difficult question to imagine posing to any other living musician.) We have learned to come to Dylan with these types of quandaries, and more often than not, we have left satisfied. But for all his allusions to history and literature, the writing drifts toward uncertainty. In a macabre narrative called “My Own Version of You,” Dylan sings about playing god as he scavenges through morgues and cemeteries to reanimate a few notable corpses and absorb their knowledge. Among the questions he poses: “Can you tell me what it means: To be or not to be?” “Is there a light at the end of the tunnel?” We never get the answers; all we hear is the depravity: slapstick horror rendered as existential comedy. The vaudevillian spirit that ran through 2001’s Love and Theft and 2006’s Modern Times is mostly limited to this one song. But there are other head-turners. “The size of your cock will get you nowhere,” he grumbles to a sworn enemy, who might be death itself, in “Black Rider.” “I’m the last of the best, you can bury the rest,” he boasts in “False Prophet,” summoning the gnarled lunatic who narrated most of 2012’s Tempest, the voice that seemed to be choking while cursing you for trying to help. These twists lead to some memorable lines—and welcomed moments of levity—but his biting, absurdist humor is not the focus. There are no distractions; he speaks carefully, quietly, earnestly. It results in a gorgeous and meticulous record. The lyrics are striking—dense enough to inspire a curriculum, clever enough to quote like proverbs. Played by his touring band, with understated appearances from Fiona Apple and Blake Mills, the music is a ghostly presence. Its sound is threadbare and hypnotic, backed by small choirs and acoustic instruments, a sharp turn from the raucous blues reenactments of his 21st-century records. As depicted in Daniel Mark Epstein’s book The Ballad of Bob Dylan: A Portrait, Dylan kick-started those sessions by playing his bandmates another artist’s “prototype” track to apply to whatever batch of songs he brought to the studio. There are obvious reference points for this music as well—Billy “The Kid” Emerson in “False Prophet,” Jimmy Reed in “Goodbye Jimmy Reed”—but the performances are less formal, more impressionistic. It is blues and folk music that seem to drift in and out of consciousness, an in-between-world described in its opening lines: “Today and tomorrow and yesterday, too/The flowers are dying like all things do.” Since 1997’s Time Out of Mind, an atmospheric return-to-form after a long period of wandering, death has been Dylan’s chief concern, to the extent that some have read it as a personal obsession. Which, of course, has only aggravated him. Yes, his recent songs deal with mortality. “But I didn’t see any one critic say: ‘It deals with my mortality’—you know, his own,” Dylan observed. It seems that he has accepted this grievance as an artistic failure and has returned with songs whose subjects cannot be misinterpreted. The last two tracks on Tempest addressed the sinking of the Titanic and the murder of John Lennon—historical events that now exist through a greater cultural consciousness. He continues and improves upon this method throughout Rough and Rowdy Ways, using notes from history to reflect something universal about our own brief, ordinary legacies. “I hope that the gods go easy with me,” he sings in “I’ve Made Up My Mind to Give Myself to You.” For a minute, you forget the status of the man singing; his prayer sounds as humble, as fragile as anyone’s. Dylan previewed this music in March by releasing “Murder Most Foul,” the longest song in his catalog and now his very first No. 1 single. The 17-minute ballad closes the record by inverting the structure of its other death songs: He begins with the ending. In concrete terms, Dylan describes the assassination of John F. Kennedy: “They blew off his head while he was still in the car,” he sings. What follows is a story of life: the world, its culture and art, that sustained without him. Through its stunning final moments, with an arrangement that sounds like a small orchestra packing up their instruments, Dylan makes a couple dozen requests to the iconic ’60s DJ Wolfman Jack: “Mystery Train,” “Moonlight Sonata,” “Don’t Let Me Be Misunderstood.” It’s a radio show—one of Dylan’s favorite mediums, that disembodied voice speaking to us through other people’s words. But as the music plays, it also becomes a wake, a gathering of spirits, the perfect distraction for our host to slip out into the night, alone. “I just heard the news about Little Richard and I’m so grieved,” Dylan wrote on his social media a month ago. “He was my shining star and guiding light back when I was only a little boy.” He sounded crestfallen; after all, Dylan has repeatedly cited Little Richard with the invention of his job, his sound, even his hairstyle. This vulnerability was almost jarring. We are used to meeting Dylan from a distance—in verse or in code, somewhere just beyond our reach. Now, he was asking us to imagine him as a kid in Minnesota, listening to the radio and imagining what his future could be. In its quiet way, Rough and Rowdy Ways is another invitation. “Forge my identity from the inside out,” he sings in “Mother of Muses,” “You know what I’m talking about.” Take him at his word and it’s an outreached hand, a chance to see the world through his eyes before it crumbles into ruin. The view is beautiful; even better, it is real and it is our own.

Get in Union,Bessie Jones and the Georgia Sea Island Singers,by: Allison Hussey,"Associate Staff Writer, News",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5ee90029464fe661509a9e51/1:1/w_160/Get%20In%20Union_Bessie%20Jones%20and%20the%20Georgia%20Sea%20Island%20Singers.jpg,2020-06-18 05:00:00,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/bessie-jones-and-the-georgia-sea-island-get-in-union/,Alan Lomax Archive,"Before her death in 1984, Bessie Jones’ employment included stints as a domestic worker, a cook, and a laundress. Her life’s work, however, was as a teacher whose medium was song. Growing up in the Gullah-Geechee traditions of rural Georgia, she absorbed music through her family. In adulthood, she doted on the children in her community by teaching them the stories, games, and spiritual music she’d inherited—history that was theirs, too. When she met folklorist Alan Lomax on his journey through the American South in 1959, she saw a way to broadcast her lessons to further reaches. The Gullah-Geechee culture coalesced from the mix of enslaved West African people living in the remote sea islands of Georgia and South Carolina, which Lomax first documented in 1935 (Zora Neale Hurston accompanied him). He met Jones when he returned two decades later, recording her several more times throughout the 1960s at her request. In 2014, Tompkins Square issued the compilation Get in Union on CD as a primer on Jones’ work, sourcing the material from the Alan Lomax Archive at the Association for Cultural Equity. Curator Nathan Salsburg has updated the collection with nine more recordings, making the lot available digitally for the first time on Bandcamp. Now at 60 tracks, Get In Union is a generous introduction to a historically muted view of Black life in the South. Jones took up with a cohort that in 1963 became known as the Georgia Sea Island Singers. Though their work was as a de facto collective, her assured voice naturally commanded the foreground. Their music was likewise communal, rising from the oral tradition of Black spirituals. (Jones’ direct line to the material was her grandfather, Jet Sampson, who had been enslaved and brought West with his brothers in 1843.) The group’s sense of interpersonal communion translated easily as they sang about Biblical tales and heavenly salvation. Some of the recordings on Get in Union feature fife, drum, and banjo, bringing a friendly pick-up-band mood to songs like “Beulah Land,” “O Mary Don’t You Weep,” and “O Day.” One element central to Gullah-Geechee religious practices was the ring shout, a type of percussive devotional music that developed among enslaved people in the Western Hemisphere. Banned from using drums, worshippers clapped, shuffled, and stomped to keep a syncopated rhythm. Get in Union provides sterling examples of the form. “Moses Don’t Get Lost” gallops toward freedom, while “Walk Daniel” and “Adam in the Garden” transmit a similarly pressing charge to keep moving. Jones and her colleagues didn’t have to answer to recording contracts or managers, because the music had always been intended for themselves: to encourage, reassure, entertain, and heal. The songs had already been around for decades—even centuries—before Lomax arrived, and Jones would’ve continued to sing them whether he was around to roll tape or not. Jones’ unaccompanied singing across Get in Union is intimate and feels almost private, captured by the state-of-the-art recording equipment that Lomax had lugged through the Lowcountry's ultrafine gray silt. She speaks to straight living on “Plumb the Line” and “This Train Is a Clean Train,” kind but clear-eyed reminders to aim for righteousness. “Go Wash in That Beautiful Stream,” on the other hand, feels like a lullaby. Jones’ softer singing brings a staggering weight to the 87-second recording. Her genuine faith can stir even the stiff non-believers, affected through her passionate voice and the music's history as a tool of liberation for enslaved people. Black women and their work have long been sidelined, written out of their own stories by malice as often as careless neglect. To wit, Jones’ voice endures in the mainstream imagination as a Moby sample: the call-and-response of her song “Sometimes” is the foundation to his “Honey.” The Gullah-Geechee have continued to weather their own storms, protecting their history while battling the avarice of real-estate developers transforming their familial agricultural lands into luxury golf resorts. The mid-’90s Nickelodeon sitcom Gullah Gullah Island and Julie Dash’s Daughters of the Dust (which heavily informed the visual aesthetics of Lemonade) have both brought versions of Gullah-Geechee culture to American screens since Jones’ death, but her perspective touches its taproot. Jones kept singing her whole life because she recognized her testimony as a guard against the erasure of her people and their experiences. She never enjoyed mainstream celebrity, but she leveraged her Lomax connection to broadcast her message at the Poor Peoples’ March on Washington, the Newport Folk Festival, Jimmy Carter’s presidential inauguration, and now into the 21st Century. Her singing catapulted her history lessons beyond her rural enclave to audiences who might have never heard her people’s stories otherwise. Get in Union is as much a map as a music album, pointing those who listen toward a more unified understanding of Black American experiences.","The reissued compilation from the great American folk and gospel singer is a generous introduction to a historically muted view of Black life in the South.

on the tender spot of every calloused moment,Ambrose Akinmusire,by: Steven Arroyo,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5ee90263ca5f171c3b76ffb5/1:1/w_160/on%20the%20tender%20spot%20of%20every%20calloused%20moment%20_Ambrose%20Akinmusire.jpg,2020-06-18 05:00:00,Jazz,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/ambrose-akinmusire-on-the-tender-spot-of-every-calloused-moment/,Blue Note,"Ambrose Akinmusire’s fifth studio album opens underwater and drowning. Midway through “Tide of Hyacinth,” Akinmusire starts to clip the ends of phrases on his trumpet; the pulse speeds up behind Justin Brown’s tense drumming; Sam Harris’s piano grows into threatening waves; Harish Raghavan’s bass notes escape in small clusters like bubbles frantically rising to the surface. As the track runs out of time, the featured vocalist and percussionist Jesús Díaz enters, singing in the West African dialect Yoruba with a soothing tenor as if to beckon you towards a light. A virtuosic trumpeter who’s also plenty decorated as a bandleader and a supporting player (he’s played trumpet for albums by Esperanza Spalding and Kendrick Lamar), Akinmusire goes great lengths to present his albums as visions that transcend instruments and improvisation. He chooses titles that read more like stray Shakespeare excerpts than names of songs or albums: The Imagined Savior Is Far Easier to Paint; “The Garden Waits for You to Match Her Wilderness”; “The Lingering Velocity of the Dead’s Ambitions”. He invites guest vocalists to take the mic on occasion, or even for an entire album. We can only imagine what he sees behind his eyelids as he closes them for the portrait on the album’s cover. Judging strictly by the sound of on the tender spot of every calloused moment, it must be a thorny but magnificent picture. Akinmusire obsesses over the musical particulars as much as the presentation ones—even, for example, swapping in Díaz late in the process for “Tide of Hyacinth”’s original planned singer, Akinmusire’s own father. on the tender spot... seeks what Díaz achieves in that moment: peace not just despite a world of unrest, but within it—a light while submerged in the dark. The nimble, selfless interactions between the four main players here suggest that human connection is where to find it. Akinmusire, Harris, Brown, and Raghavan have now been playing together for more than a decade, and they embrace a new level of strength as a unit. On “Moon (the return amplifies the unity),” Akinmusire ends phrases by stammering on one note like a skipping record; Harris rolls over the same four-note pattern with accentuating chords in different places each time; Brown absolutely loses his shit on his drum set. “Roy,” on the other hand, finds them in complete agreement, solemnly harmonizing beneath Akinmusire’s golden vibrato for a slow, deferential salute to the late great trumpeter Roy Hargrove. This gesture of meeting the listener halfway, of delivering a plainly beautiful moment for every one where they completely break free, reinforces the sense that Akinmusire and his band are after your immediate emotional response. Tonality, space, studio shenanigans—none of these things matter to them if the songs don’t also shed some blood or tears. It’s cerebral jazz music that doesn’t care about the synapses in your cerebral cortex as much as the air in your lungs. Harris, in particular, steps into the core of their sound with several gut-punching moments. As the band snaps together at the peak of “An Interlude (that get’ more intense),” his piano seeps and swirls like dark blue ink, into which Akinmusire dips the pointed quill of his scribbling solos. It comes to a traffic-stopping conclusion with “hooded (read the names outloud),” which has no vocals, no bandmates, no trumpet even—just Akinmusire alone at a Rhodes keyboard, playing simple intervals. It’s a funeral procession. On past albums, Akinmusire has included tribute tracks, which spoke the names of Black victims of police murders out loud. This time, he says them with silence. It’s hard not to think back to the drowning sensation that opened the album. As his heart grows heavier, his Rhodes only gets lighter, twinkling as he walks his fingers further to the right of the keyboard; it sounds like a music box on its last rotation, plucking out its faint final notes. For maybe the first time, his melody leads the ears: As it reaches a high seventh, you know that the root is coming next to mark the album’s end. It lands, right on time, and it feels like a breath.","On the jazz trumpeter’s fifth album, Akinmusire and his extremely tight band are after your immediate emotional response.

Providence,Ulthar,by: Kim Kelly,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5ee8e631a9d0807aa56836bd/1:1/w_160/Providence_Ulthar.jpg,2020-06-18 05:00:00,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/ulthar-providence/,20 Buck Spin,"The work of H.P. Lovecraft looms large within the extreme-metal imagination, and the Oakland trio Ulthar—who take their name from one of the author’s short stories—is far from the first band to fall under its spell. The band’s sophomore LP, Providence, which is named for Lovecraft’s hometown, features album art studded with skulls and plague buboes, resembling one of those cursed Victorian mourning wreaths woven from human hair. Those surface-level clues immediately alert the listener that they’re in for an unsettling ride (and is, artistically, par for the course for Ulthar). There is a certain ghastly air to the proceedings, as though the trio had discovered a nest of eldritch tentacles in the cellar while recording and decided to keep on playing. With Lovecraft himself, the true horror was what a racist, anti-Semitic shitbag he was, but here, that wyrd atmosphere is conjured in good faith, and conducted with blackened grandiosity. The people involved have decades of experience between them in the study and execution of extremity, from drummer Justin Ennis’s tenure in NYC black metallers Mutilation Rites and current project Void Omnia to vocalist and guitarist Shelby Lermo’s experience with Bay Area death cult Vastum and bassist and vocalist Steve Peacock’s time in off-kilter blasphemers Pale Chalice and Mastery. It is unsurprising that Ulthar is a good band, but Providence is not just a good record, it is a great one, and the reasons for that go far beyond its creators’ resumes. They couch their devotion to old-school death metal orthodoxy within a modern context; there's no mud, or murk, or self-conscious efforts to sound lo-fi, and the technical aspects are presented plainly, without apology or artifice. Providence allows no time for niceties on its short, brutish opening track, “Churn,” from which “Undying Spear” offers a brief respite before the rippling melody is torn to shreds by an imperious blast. Ulthar’s sound mingles black metal, death metal, doom, and thrash, and they skitter between genres in the leaps of a scale. But Providence owes a particular debt to Finish masters like Demigod, Convulsed, and Demilich, an earlier cohort who innately understood the importance of tempering technical flights with grounded riffs and headbanging tempos. There is a certain sameness to a few of the album's eight tracks, so those that take the time to experiment invariably stand out. “Through Downward Dynasties” creeps in with an eerie ambient intro, flush with whooshing synthesizer effects and ominous undertones. It soon explodes into a flurry of blastbeats, precise scales, and icy, controlled chaos. Album closer “Humanoid Knot” revels in its own strangeness, from Lermo’s unhinged cackling to its slow, juddering riffs. Recorded by Bay Area mainstay Greg Wilkinson at Earhammer Studios and mastered by Adam Tucker at Signaturetone Recording, the album just sounds good, always listenable despite its undeniable brutality. They started strong on their 2016 demo and hit their stride with 2018’s monstrous Cosmovore, but with Providence, Ulthar has raised the bar on themselves yet again. With each release, their understanding of the art of death metal continues to deepen and spiral off into unexpected territory.","The Oakland trio’s understanding of the art of death metal continues to deepen and spiral off into unexpected territory.

Room for the Moon,Kate NV,by: Quinn Moreland,Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5ee79cc1a9d0807aa56835d9/1:1/w_160/Room%20for%20the%20Moon_Kate%20NV.jpg,2020-06-17 05:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/kate-nv-room-for-the-moon/,Rvng Intl.,"The Russian experimental pop performer Kate NV has her feet in two worlds. In one, the artist born Ekaterina Shilonosova sings and plays guitar in the fiery post-punk band ΓШ (Glintshake). In the other, she works with the Moscow Scratch Orchestra, an ensemble inspired by the improvisational pieces of the English composer Cornelius Cardew. In her work as Kate NV, she commits fully to the unpredictability and openness that unites them both. NV’s sophomore record, 2018’s для FOR, was a whimsical, ambient portrait of her native Moscow made mostly on a synthesizer. But the stiffness of sitting or bending over a Buchla soon took a toll on her body; it was time to return to a more flexible method of making music. The result, Room for the Moon, is a return to the joyful grooves of her 2016 debut, Binasu. If NV’s striking voice was largely absent from для FOR, here it springs forth like an acrobat who has been waiting on the bench for her time to shine. Alongside a cast of musicians who help bring her kaleidoscopic world to life, NV emerges with a visionary avant-pop record that offers an escape from gloom. But even while Room for the Moon bursts with exuberance, NV has explained that the record was finished during “the loneliest period” of her life. With that in mind, it’s easy to see these 10 songs as a sanctuary NV willed into being, a fantasy world where that solitude could be replaced with a cornucopia of melodies. The air of escapism is palpable in the album’s wriggling synth flourishes and chirping flutes like hummingbirds. For one track on для FOR, NV set a poem by the abstract painter Wassily Kandinsky to song. While the Russian expressionist is not so explicitly invoked this time around, Room for the Moon gestures towards the synesthetic splashes of color that define Kandinsky’s work. NV’s music feels akin to being sucked into one of his paintings, where there’s no linear thinking, only liberation. NV has said that Room for the Moon’s influences include Russian children’s movies and television shows and she has described her album as a fairy tale, saying “Each song is like a character who, to one degree or another, is presented in me and shapes me as a person.” For the most part, these studies are loose and upbeat. The blips and bleeps that begin opener “Not Not Not” are soon joined by a mix of bass, saxophone, and synth. “Ça Commence Par” is carried by a symphony of woodwinds, marimba, and faraway giggles that eventually give way to a riddle which NV presents like a Mad Hatter for club kids: “We buy it to eat/But we never eat it/Starts with a ‘p.’” But beneath these sparkling tracks lie anxious ruminations. The message coursing through “Not Not Not” is considerably less chipper than its squawking horns: “You’ve got no time/Soon!/You’re getting old.” “Sayonara,” which turns wistful repetitions of its titular phrase into a hook, is mired in indecision. On “Marafon 15” NV layers an assortment of eerie synth effects atop a dogged bass line, creating a sensation of creeping uncertainty. “Your hand will grasp and let go of the precious moment/What will happen to it/It will return,” NV blithely murmurs in Russian. The lullaby “If Anyone’s Sleepy” explores the slipperiness of time in a similarly elegiac register. But ultimately, Room for the Moon emanates a gentle sense of hope. Late album highlight “Plans” is an ’80s dance party featuring a bleating sax solo pulled from Found Sound Nation’s “broken orchestra” sample pack. “Somewhere on the planet there are plans where everything is clear, where we are given words,” NV promises in Russian. Even if that cloudless place is impossible to grab ahold of right now, Room for the Moon offers respite until we find it.","Alongside a cast of musicians who help bring her kaleidoscopic world to life, the Russian avant-pop artist emerges with a visionary record that offers an escape from gloom.

I Love You Say It Back,Key!,by: Dani Blum ,Contributor ,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5ee7a5498813ffa92664db9a/1:1/w_160/%20I%20Love%20You%20Say%20It%20Back_Key!.jpg,2020-06-17 05:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/key-i-love-you-say-it-back/,Hello!,"Key! has never made a straightforward love song. The underground Atlanta rapper lives in a swirl of conflicting emotions, a frenzy of dread and jealousy and pleasure. The best song on his last album catalogued his paranoia over a girlfriend’s frequent trips to Miami. “If I lose you, I lose my damn mind,” he moaned, and then paused: “Psych, baby, I was just gassing.” Nearly every confession he blurts gets an inevitable retraction; the insults Key! lobs at his lovers turn into indictments of himself. Any declaration of love or grief or pain seems only as real as the joke or bit that follows it. His new album, the winkingly titled I Love You Say It Back, braids his raps together with dazzling pop hooks and choruses, but gloom is never far from Key!’s writing. Every bouncy synth and fizzy beat is equally ready to soundtrack disses and disdain. What differentiates Key! from other rappers stitching together anguished hits out of past relationships is the sense of eavesdropping on an internal dialogue. He animates his music with near-constant ad-libs; they seem to literalize a conversation he’s having with himself, particularly when he carves choruses out of questions. “Who do you think you, who do you think you are?” he moans and sighs over a slick, flute-heavy 14Golds beat on “Let’s Go,” pleading with a woman to cut the small talk. “How’d that go? Wait, what you mean?” he demands on “Sugar & Rice,” a sunny-sounding standout about a breakup. The interrogation pierces through the gooey, AutoTuned verses, and after a few repetitions he arrives at a stark, quintessentially Key! admission: “I’m lying to myself, I’m coming over.” Key! can also sing, which sets him apart. On last year’s So Emotional, his occasional croons anchored the album’s catchy pop hooks; this time around, they help take his sound in new directions. “Boys Don’t Cry” is a standard Key! song in content—“Who am I kidding, I’ve been kidding myself,” he wails—but the sound approaches emo rap, layering chanted chorus vocals over a muted, throbbing drum as he sing-shouts about self-medication and surviving trauma. On “Bottom of the Bottle,” producer TrapMoneyBenny smears Key!’s howls in AutoTune, softening and smoothing the grit in his voice. “I can love you if you let me,” Key! sings. “Oops, that’s just the bottom of the Henny.” The incessant asides might grow tiring if Key! weren’t so obviously, infectiously charming.  Listening to him take digs at his exes, you’re not concerned about growth or maturity; you’re caught in the propulsive glimmer, in FKi 1st’s high-velocity drum patterns, in the way the layers of Key!’s voice pack into every corner of a song. There are no duds on the compact, 24-minute album, but the tracks that fail to sparkle stand out. The smooth, Kenny Beats-produced “Vibin” is relatively forgettable compared to their thrashing, frenetic collaborations on Key!’s breakout album, 777. Blown-out speaker effects and urgent, twitching drums push “Anakin” towards cartoonish darkness, but the song is more menacing in tone than in lyrics: “Don’t get on my bad side,” Key! growls, “But if you do, it’s okay, alright.” Then, for nearly a full minute, his voice is conspicuously absent—not bragging about rebounding from a breakup, not admitting that his ex is still on his mind, not pleading for his date to put down her phone. That’s when Key! accomplishes what he seems to crave most: That you miss him when he’s gone.","Braiding together searching raps, fizzy beats, and charming pop hooks, the underground Atlanta rapper’s new album is a swirl of conflicting emotions animated by near-constant ad-libs.

Meanwhile, the fifth album from his solo outlet, GUM, arrived on the same day last week that Tame Impala would’ve wrapped up a string of North American dates at the Amway Center in Orlando, a circumstance that epitomizes the stark contrast between Watson’s high-profile touring gig and his passion project. Now that the promotional juggernaut for The Slow Rush has stalled and much of the world has become acquainted with the self-isolating lifestyle of a home-recording hermit, the conditions are ripe to better appreciate GUM on its own peculiar terms—and fortuitously, Watson has stepped up with his most ambitious GUM album to date. While both groups function as one-man bands in the studio and share a fondness for synthetic psychedelia, their results couldn’t feel more different. If Tame Impala makes Parker’s solitary operation sound like stadium rock, GUM exudes a claustrophobic, mad-scientist energy that lends even the most grandiose gestures a DIY charm. This time around, he offers some fleeting glimpses into his life behind the recording console. Written after a brief six-month stint living in the Golden State, the opening “Weightless in L.A.” is a Syd Barrett-like serenade carried away on a parade of drum machines, yacht-rock sax, and digital noise, rendering the song less an ode to California dreaming than an attempt to shatter the idyllic facade. And while the title track may not be about explicitly about Los Angeles, the music suggests a blend of Laurel Canyon bliss and Ariel Pink paranoia, perhaps inspired by Watson’s recent entry into fatherhood—surely, every new parent can relate to the anxiety of a line like “It’s morning again/I’m sensing a trend/I don’t know how it takes so long to get to sunset.” By Watson’s own admission, GUM records are more a catalog of moods than a collection of profound statements, and he’s become more adept at adding just the right details to expedite that immersion. Sampled strings add a sinister edge to the street-funk strut of “Airwalkin,’” while the heavenly chorus hook on the wistful “Many Tears to Cry” suggests Eric Clapton’s “Wonderful Tonight” given a Moon Safari makeover. Though Out in the World is rooted in the same self-deprecating, existential introspection as 2018’s The Underdog, Watson has discovered more colorful ways to express it: “So I go low to low,” he sings on “Low to Low,” as the track’s seductive bossa-nova beat scales from high to high. And with the closing “You Make Your Own Luck,” Watson effectively distills GUM’s whole essence into a two-part mini-suite: one half nocturnal cosmic ballad, one half sunrise-summoning soul-jazz groove, the song reaffirms Watson’s ongoing mission to find the elation in isolation.","The new album from multi-instrumentalist Jay Watson (Tame Impala, POND) is his most ambitious to date, imbuing his mad-scientist home-recording project with some fleeting glimpses into his life beyond the console.

Annual,Modern Nature,by: Marty Sartini Garner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5ee7a289a9d0807aa56835de/1:1/w_160/Annual_Modern%20Nature.jpg,2020-06-17 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/modern-nature-annual/,Bella Union,"In the 16 months since the release of Modern Nature’s debut EP Nature in March 2019, the group led by guitarist Jack Cooper has explored krautrock, paganesque British folk, sideways In Rainbows jams, spiritual jazz, tape loops, meditation music, and the kind of minimalist indie rock Cooper forged with James Hoare in their group Ultimate Painting. Modern Nature’s new mini-album, Annual, is their most consistent and focused release to date, but by drawing their sound down to its essence, they dampen the anything-goes spirit that made them so appealing. As a result, Annual feels polished and smartly constructed, but limited in its scope—a high-definition planetarium that makes you wish for the night sky. Annual purports to be a calendar cycle of songs, beginning at the end of the year and moving through the seasons, culminating in the return of winter. Instead, this 20-minute suite feels more like a bleak February set off by a weekend-long warm spell. The overall mood is dark, gray, and cloudy, which isn’t necessarily a bad thing. Where last year’s full-length How to Live felt like an exurb meeting between Neu! and Fairport Convention, Annual is more at home in the territory of Songs: Ohia, Low, Ryley Walker, or the Sufjan Stevens of Seven Swans: American artists working in the dim light of midwestern winters. This is a mode that suits Cooper well. With Will Young focused on BEAK> and momentarily out of the picture, Modern Nature have scaled down to little more than stand-up bass and shuffling drums that follow the lead of Cooper’s guitar, which curls like a flag in low wind. Like Talk Talk, a heavy influence here, this iteration of Modern Nature uses shadow and suggestion, their small size somehow standing in for the immensity of the object upon which they’re focused. Sunwatchers’ Jeff Tobias, whose sax whirled across How to Live, mostly reduces himself to textural work, laying down a high-pile carpet that serves as the foundation for many of these songs. In Ultimate Painting, Cooper perfected his sense of negative space, carving his way through the group’s albums with deceptively complex guitar lines. Here, he’s backed by a band capable of matching him step for step. But it’s hard not to miss the risk-taking of Modern Nature’s previous releases. “Harvest,” whose lead vocal is sung by Itasca, is stroked along by swells of guitar, and just when the song seems ready to strike deeper into the darkness, it sputters out on Cooper’s brief, throat-clearing solo and a couple of leashed bars from Tobias. “Halo” glances in the direction of a long, low-stress jam à la Alice Coltrane, but ultimately decides it’s not worth the trip; a stretch that seems like the prelude to a pleasurable workout turns out to be nothing more than a yawn. Despite its misfires, the ambitious scale of Annual’s song suite is another step forward for a young group evolving at an unnaturally fast rate. The band’s all-gates-open conceit has clearly sparked something in Cooper, who is already at work on a follow-up, and who seems more aware than ever of just how malleable a song and a band can be. All the more reason to wish he’d hammered harder.","The group’s new mini-album is their most consistent and focused, but by drawing their sound down to its essence, they dampen the anything-goes spirit that made them so appealing.

TO LOVE IS TO LIVE,Jehnny Beth,by: Olivia Horn ,Contributor ,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5ee3c1b5ca5f171c3b76fcf3/1:1/w_160/To%20Love%20Is%20To%20Live_Jehnny%20Beth.jpg,2020-06-16 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/jehnny-beth-to-love-is-to-live/,Caroline,"Jehnny Beth didn’t set out to write love songs. In 2011, as the French singer born Camille Berthomier began to write a debut album with her new punk band, Savages, she swore off the subject, finding topics like identity and censorship more fruitful. But when it came time for Savages’ second record, a switch had flipped. Overwhelmed by the generosity and warmth radiating from her audience, Beth wanted to bounce some of it back. That impulse yielded 2016’s Adore Life, an album whose slash-and-burn guitar work lit up the tenderness of its lyrics. TO LOVE IS TO LIVE, Beth’s new solo album—written and produced with Savages producer (and Beth’s longtime partner) Johnny Hostile—is not a Savages record by another name. Beth sidelines the grimy, distorted guitar and reaches for a more diverse palette, including strobe-like synths, downy woodwinds, and inscrutable snippets of found sound. But there are constants: TO LOVE IS TO LIVE is rife with the same livewire intensity, the same embrace of tensions and apparent contradictions. Lyrically and musically, it vacillates between the corporeal and the ethereal, prudence and excess, softness and severity. Its various parts could fill out the whole character alignment grid from lawful good to chaotic evil. If not always love, they demonstrate fascination with the full spectrum of human experience and beyond. Presenting herself as an alien (or a sentient robot?), Beth opens the record with a sweeping, spoken-word poem warped by vocal filters. Elsewhere, she’s an all-too-human lover, longing for closeness. On “I’m the Man,” she’s an aggressor, spitting the titular phrase more than 30 times through an audible snarl. She is pious and a miscreant, sometimes at once. Beth appears as a statue on the record’s cover, her powerful stance and icy glare locked in stone; under the surface, though, things are far more fluid. This has structural implications, too: TO LOVE IS TO LIVE is stuffed with disorienting interludes, codas, and about-faces. On more than one occasion, Beth and her collaborators build up a hardcore frenzy, then swiftly pull out the rug: The seething chaos of “How Could You” abruptly tumbles into ambient birdsong. Instrumental lines are collaged together with skittering synthetics; Beth’s alto is distinctive but mutable, and she flits between acridity and softness. There is some organizing logic across the album, like the reprisal of the opening poem on its final track, signaling the completion of a cycle. But, on the whole, it is indifferent to order. Rather, urgency emerges as its guiding principle, heard in its dramatic crescendos and emphatic percussion. Beth’s idea for a solo project germinated in 2016, following the death of David Bowie. After revisiting his final album, Blackstar, she was overtaken by an existentialist conviction that man (or woman) is nothing but his or her own making. Beth wanted to create something to cement her own legacy—an undeniably daunting task. “I couldn’t shake the feeling of my mortality, all through doing it,” she recently said, of working on the album. “I felt it was important that I do this before I died.” The sense that the clock is ticking hangs in the air. On opener “I Am,” a timer pulses as if Beth is on deadline to transfer her thoughts onto tape. There’s no room for tidiness under such conditions. Pondering death raises matters of conscience (particularly for someone like Beth, who is, as she notes on “Innocence,” plagued by Catholic guilt). And so sin—both of the flesh and of society at large—emerges as a motif. Near the midway point, Beth enlists actor Cillian Murphy to bemoan the cruelties of war and capitalism in a piercing reading of her poem “A Place Above.” Beth said that “I’m the Man,” which follows, is not an excoriation of the patriarchy, but an exploration of the destructive tendencies that live within all of us. It’s difficult, though, to write off the song’s blatantly misogynistic language (“There’s no bitch in town/Who doesn’t understand/How hard my dick can be”) entirely; in this self-interrogation, Beth takes toxic masculinity as a given, a baseline against which she can measure her own inner demons. But Beth’s lyrics are often more evocative than they are precisely descriptive or narrative. And for all her fixation on virtue and sin, she’s not out to moralize, exactly, but rather to capture all the messiness, contradiction, and even ugliness of life. This is true even of album closer “Human,” on which she refutes her humanity altogether and surrenders her body to the cloud: “I used to be a human being/Now I live in the web.” Scientists say that whole brain emulation—actually uploading our minds—is still a distant prospect, for reasons both technological and ethical. Until then, we’re left with more analog methods of cataloging our lives and shoring up our legacies. As any artist knows, this is an imperfect, imprecise project—but that’s the beauty of it.","With livewire intensity, the Savages singer-songwriter’s ambitious and experimental solo album explodes with life from every corner as an epic display of contrasting themes and emotion.

The Godfather 3,Wiley,by: Will Pritchard,Contributor ,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5ee7957a464fe661509a9cd9/1:1/w_160/The%20Godfather%203_Wiley.jpg,2020-06-16 05:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/wiley-the-godfather-3/,self-released,"When Wiley started picking fights at the end of 2019, most grime fans assumed it was the scene’s old hand turning to a tried-and-true promo playbook: call out another MC on the radio, trade a few diss tracks, piggyback off each other’s rep, create a buzz, then drop a new album. Having rattled through a 15-minute BBC radio interview—calling Drake a “pagan” and Ed Sheeran a “culture vulture”—Wiley followed up with a bunch of tweets and war dubs aimed squarely at Stormzy, who was preparing for an extensive world tour off the back of a second number one album in a row. It worked, of course. The two sent shots at each other. Wiley met with A-list boxing promoter Eddie Hearn about promoting a live clash between him and Stormzy at London’s 20,000-capacity O2 Arena. Broadsheets filled pages awkwardly explaining the dispute, while fans debated online as to who was coming out on top—and whether there was anything more to the beef than Wiley stirring the pot to his own end. But then no album appeared. According to people on Wiley’s side of the argument, label wrangling behind the scenes meant Wiley had to wait out his term’s expiry date before he could release the record on his own. But while his beef with Stormzy tailed off, Wiley was driving around London linking up with MCs to lay down verses. To what end, they couldn’t be sure—when Godfather III finally dropped last week, a number of MCs tweeted out that they didn’t realize they were going to feature on the finished album—but for Wiley this was an exercise in taking grime back to its roots or, in his words, “back to the village.” All of a sudden, the beef started making sense. His real umbrage is not so much with Stormzy’s success or the perceived lack of homage paid to grime’s originators, but the way in which he believes control has been wrested from artists by the suits—or, in the case of Sheeran’s “Take Me Back To London” remix, by a dorky singer-songwriter. It’s hard not to view Godfather III as a direct response to all of this. The album’s first half is stacked with songs directly addressing the issue. “Protect The Empire” packs a blunt-force chorus of “We built this up, that’s why we must protect it.” On “The Game,” he can’t resist taking another jab at his former protégé and fellow grime innovator, Dizzee Rascal, for starring in ads for Ladbrokes (a gambling chain accused of targeting deprived urban areas and leeching off the UK’s most vulnerable) instead of putting his efforts into pulling the scene up with him. Wiley has flirted with major labels throughout his career, and he’s left pretty much all of them with a bridge blazing behind him. Last year, a star-studded dancehall album called Full Circle featuring Future, Tory Lanez, and Nicki Minaj, among others, was ground into nothingness by rights disputes. A commercial shoo-in that would surely have been Wiley’s retirement fund following the massive success of 2019’s “Boasty,” the record was canned as egos and bureaucracy prevailed over the music. Godfather III, which packs close to 30 featured artists over its 22 tracks, shows Wiley holding up a mirror to the industry’s bureaucracy. In place of familiar faces from the Billboard Hot 100, he invites grime MCs from all eras of the sound to bar alongside him. Veterans like D Double E, Flirta D, and Scratchy bump up against newer names like Jammz, Jon E Clayface, Big Zuu, and Capo Lee. Some, like K9 and Manga, straddle both epochs, while others have just a handful of credits to their name. Two tracks—“West London” and “South London”—are dedicated to showcasing talent from small pockets of the city. The beats derive from the years of dubplates and car-trunk distribution up to streaming hits too: On “Alla Dem” he raps over a Scratcha DVA instrumental that dates back as far as 2007; Zdot’s beat for “Da Vibez Is Back” hooks on a sample of one of Kanye’s infamous 2016 rants; while “South London” is produced by Mazza—one of the beatmakers behind Big Shaq’s viral UK drill track “Man’s Not Hot.” At 22 tracks, it’s a little bloated—but with most songs barely scratching the three-minute mark, it zips along at a pace reminiscent of the radio sets and stage shows that the sound incubated in almost two decades ago. This plays out to literal effect on “Eskimo Dance.” Named after the series of raves Wiley started in 2002, the track shows 11 different MCs passing the mic to spit their most explosive bars in an eight-bar rally as classic instrumentals from the sound’s first golden age slide into one another. (In a neat historical nod, the first three instrumentals on the song are the same three instrumentals that opened the very first Eskimo Dance.) When things do slow down and Wiley centers his own voice—see “Free Spirit” or reflective closer “Press Record”—the pause is welcome: Not only for the insights and insecurities revealed (“We’ve done things in music we didn't know we could/The crowd’s gone overground but we all came from the hood /I don’t know where I'm going but where I’m going is good” on “Free Spirit”) but for his idiosyncratic ability to drop punchlines like “I never liked Marmite on toast, and no no I never liked porridge” amidst the profundity. This month, Wiley told The Guardian that Godfather III will be his last album. Needless to say he hasn’t mentioned any retirement plans. Maybe this was just another leaf from that well-worn promo playbook? But if Godfather III is to be his swan song, then fans could hardly hope for a better send-off: it’s about as pure an encapsulation of grime’s past, present, and future as the album format allows.","After a protracted battle with Stormzy and a scrapped crossover album, the grime veteran regroups and offers what he calls his final album.

S/T EP,Nídia,by: Madison Bloom,Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5ee79b217bb7acb328d567b2/1:1/w_160/S:T_NI%CC%81DIA.jpg,2020-06-16 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/nidia-st-ep/,Príncipe Discos,"Few words and little fanfare accompanied the release of S/T, Nídia’s latest EP on Lisbon dance label Príncipe. It made a surprise landing in early June, while across the U.S., collective rage about police brutality and state-sanctioned racism was boiling over and spilling into the streets. “We have to be more friendly and humane,” wrote the Portuguese producer, who grew up in outer Lisbon’s Vale de Amoreira housing projects, in a statement announcing S/T. “COVID taught us that we are nobody without each other,” she added. “Since I stopped judging and hating human beings my life has become as colourful as the LGBTQ flag and as firm as Martin Luther King’s fist.” While the creation of the tracks predates the current protests, the EP contains some of Nídia’s most urgent and invigorating beat work—a reminder that the batida rhythms she crafts are themselves a form of dissent. “Calm music is for couples,” Nídia told The New York Times in 2018, shortly after moving back to Vale do Amoreira from Bordeaux, where she spent her adolescence. “When something comes out of the ghetto, it can’t come softly. It has to have strength.” That strength is evident across Nídia’s catalog, but particularly on S/T, which packs four relentless entries into a lean 16 minutes. S/T marks the third installment of a triptych, following Nídia’s Badjuda Sukulbembe 7"" and her latest LP, Não Fales Nela Que A Mentes, both of which arrived earlier this year. Those records are considerably more lax and spacious than S/T. The meditative Não Fales Nela Que A Mentes lopes and ripples, while Badjuda Sukulbembe is as thick and agitated as a kettle of simmering molasses. S/T detonates any previous calm, however. Nídia has said that her community’s music should be “like an explosion in your face,” and S/T is evidence of the young producer’s pyrotechnic touch. The record is propelled by sharp synthesizer, insistent percussion, and the occasional squawking command. Opener “CHEF” tosses laser-beam bleats over snare patches like peppery spices—the more seasoning, the better. “Jam” dials up that intensity, looping a frantic, soccer-stadium synth melody over skittering breakbeats. Perhaps the song’s title stems from its resemblance to an over-caffeinated jock jam—one better blasted in the club than at a sports arena. While “CHEF” and “Jam” are optimally explosive, “Hard” and “Nunun” are the most dynamic cuts on S/T, maintaining velocity as they change shape. The latter pusles with organic, wooden percussion. It clatters and thumps as Nídia extrudes beams of glowing, ambient tone to glide between the polyrhythms. If strength is Nídia’s impetus for making music, it is fully realized on “Hard,” a militant dancefloor decree. Her longtime calling card, “Studio da Mana” (“Sister’s Studio,” the name she gave to her home recording setup) chirps out early in the mix, followed by dueling horn phrases and girding beats. Here, the percussion is tinny and rapid—like horses galloping on streets paved with sheet metal. Nídia’s rhythmic stride is in full force: equal parts battle march and ecstatic gyration. Listening to Não Fales Nela Que A Mentes and Badjuda Sukulbembe now, it seems like they weren’t so much relaxed as they were bracing for disruption. S/T offers that catharsis—a work of urgency that makes dancing itself feel like a form of civil disobedience.","Just weeks after releasing a new album and accompanying 7"", the Portuguese batida producer completes the triptych with a dynamic and defiant four-track EP of tough, percussive club cuts.

Zoom,upsammy,by: Shawn Reynaldo,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5eda6916516c27a90b85e5f8/1:1/w_160/Upsammy-Zoom.jpg,2020-06-16 05:00:00,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/upsammy-zoom/,Dekmantel,"Despite its title, Zoom has nothing to do with the video conferencing app that’s kept us all connected over the past few months. If anything, the debut full-length from the Dutch electronic musician upsammy (aka Thessa Torsing) is about disconnection—if not from society as a whole, then from the day-to-day hustle and bustle that often prevents us from examining the world around us. It’s an ode to taking a closer look and soaking up the beauty of life’s tiniest details. The chunk of ice melting in Torsing’s hand on the cover—also referenced in the woozy opener “Melt in My Heated Hand”—is a metaphor for the entire record. Zoom is a rumination on impermanence. Torsing lives in Amsterdam, but she has an affinity for nature, which provides an ideal setting for the moments of thoughtful observation that inspired Zoom. Videos for “Extra Warm” and “It Drips” both feature fixed shots of pastoral tranquility. Though the music itself isn’t necessarily peaceful—Torsing’s percolating rhythms often recall the impish spirit of classic, late-’90s IDM—it is richly melodic and full of light, with sparkling synths and billowing pads that invoke the magic of the untamed wild. It was a DJ residency at Amsterdam’s much loved De School nightclub that first put Torsing on the wider electronic music radar, and words like “adventurous” are often used to describe her sets. Straight lines aren’t really her thing, and depending on her mood, she’s as likely to hit crowds with low-key ambient bliss as she is intense blasts of off-kilter electro. Zoom takes a similar approach; while it’s not impossible for DJs to put these tracks to good use, the album clearly wasn’t designed with dancefloor functionality in mind. Zoom is transportive, and it is best when glistening and gliding toward Torsing’s wooded hideaways. “Glowing Out of the Plastic Box” is a shot of bright bucolic wonder, the charm of its cotton-candy melodies only enhanced by the song’s crooked stomp. “Echo Boomed” is similarly buoyant, although its carefree rhythm feels more like a breezy afternoon walk through the countryside. There’s a lightness to much of Zoom, though that shouldn’t be mistaken for a lack of complexity. Torsing’s production is abundantly detailed and always evolving; her music has an organic quality, an aesthetic aided by her use of field recordings and intermittent patches of fuzz. There’s something delightful about the restlessly playful drum patterns of songs like the world-weary “Twisted Like a Flame” and the more rousing “Reality Paces the Platform,” which together close out the album on a high note. At times, Torsing’s percussion coalesces into something that resembles a danceable groove. With its dubby, halftime bounce, “Extra Warm” is Zoom’s most obvious head nodder, although it’s been overlaid with additional drums that top 170 bpm, darting to and fro with the inexhaustible energy of a hummingbird. “Subsoil” is similarly energetic, its bubbling percussion bringing to mind the frantic vibe of shangaan electro and other fleet-footed African rhythms. Much slower is the sci-fi strut of “Send-Zen,” the only track that could potentially be described as ominous. Zoom arrives at a moment in which the world feels particularly chaotic, but the album’s irrepressible shine shouldn’t be dismissed as superficial escapism. For those who have the luxury of pausing to reflect, right now seems like an opportune time to simply be present and take stock of their surroundings, both physical and mental; upsammy’s album makes for a rewarding soundtrack to such introspection.","Invoking the playful spirit of classic IDM, the Dutch producer’s debut full-length is an ode to reveling in the beauty of life’s tiniest details.

Startisha,Naeem,by: Jackson Howard,Contributor ,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5ee287c88813ffa92664d983/1:1/w_160/Startisha_Naeem.jpg,2020-06-15 05:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/naeem-startisha/,37d03d,"If you spent time online in 2006, there’s a chance you thought Spank Rock was cool. His music was a defining cog in the genre-mashing thunderdome that emerged alongside bloghouse; it was superficially exciting and quickly overwhelming party music, an abrasive and sometimes thrilling concoction of break-beat Baltimore club mixed with bass-heavy hip-hop, house, rock, and electronica. But unlike his collaborators from the same era, who found commercial success by evolving out of the internet pockets they started in—artists like Diplo, Santigold, and Benny Blanco—Spank, real name Naeem Juwan, stayed put, treading water in some mid-aughts fantasy. He quickly became a relic of his time; when I think of Spank Rock, whose debut album YoYoYoYoYo came out in 2006, I think of purple American Apparel hoodies and cups of froyo at Pinkberry. Startisha, Juwan’s debut album under his first name, arrives six years after the last Spank Rock EP. It’s the work of a freer musician, one unburdened by internet attention, hype, or the need to stand out. Most importantly, though, it’s an attempt by a musical harbinger to prove, all these years later, that he does, actually, have something to say. For the past five years, Naeem worked on new music with producers Sam Green and Grave Goods, in Philadelphia, and with Ryan Olsen in Minneapolis. He popped up last year on Bon Iver’s i,i, earning a writing credit on the transcendent hymnal “U (Man Like)” and a personal tribute on album highlight “Naeem.” Startisha’s nine songs, two of which carry writing credits from Justin Vernon, are undeniably more personal than Naeem’s previous work. There’s something cathartic about an artist with such a purposeful persona finally shedding his layers, even when it doesn’t reveal as much as he might think it does. But this album is more for Naeem himself than any listener. And when it hits a sweet spot, drifting somewhere between manic experimentation and somber fury, Startisha shines. That sweet spot is the Francis and the Lights co-write “Stone Harbor,” a warm tribute to Naeem’s longtime boyfriend. Green and Grave Goods’ production swells from a trip-hop bounce, layered with electronic horn flares to a full-bodied, piano-flushed sing-a-long; it’s a near perfect encapsulation of the internal chaos of missing a partner, a sensation both vulnerable and assured. “Every song I hear I think of you/Every love I’ve had I think of you,” Naeem repeats, like a prayer. Just as transportive is “Simulation,” which features Vernon and Swamp Dogg and takes a page from Kanye West and Vernon’s maximalist playbook, blending folksy keys with heavy 808s as Naeem raps, scattershot, about the Sandy Hook shooting, banned books, and the DC Comics character King Mob. He still knows how to party, though, dipping back into Spank Rock territory on “Let Us Rave” and the ridiculously fun “Woo Woo Woo,” a raunchy and cocky posse cut over a hiccuping Baltimore house beat that features Juwan’s long standing (and sorely underrated) collaborators Micah James and Amanda Blank. It’s unclear, really, what Startisha is trying to say, beyond manifesting a fresh start for its protagonist. When Naeem tries too hard to tell us who he is, he stumbles—songs like “Us” and “Right Here” feel insular and half-conceived, and his verses, while not Spank Rock-level crude, have the pent-up, free-associative energy of long-restrained rambles. The album’s closer, “Tiger Song,” is a well-intentioned but exhausting attempt at something like a worldview, where Naeem’s pontifications about Malcolm X and Martin Luther King, Jr. are downright confounding. It’s unedited and raw, as inaccessible as a stranger’s scribbled journal entry. It’s on Startisha’s title track, though, that we finally meet Naeem Juwan. The song tells the story of his childhood neighbor, Startisha, who appeared one day at a family get-together, drawn by the thump of the Baltimore club music playing, and danced with Naeem. He never forgot it. And over a dripping, fractured electronic symphony that’s part A.G. Cook and part Bon Iver, he unites both the awe he felt at the time, witnessing Startisha’s presence, and the nostalgia he feels for her now. “Sometimes when I have time/I think of you and I wonder/Do you still move this way?” he sings. Nearly six minutes long, the song luxuriates in its remembrance; soaked in heavy drums, luscious horns, and dramatic vocal runs, it has the feel of a rediscovered home video, a simple but vivid origin story of an impressionable queer black kid watching a glamorous black woman dance. Naeem is singing about his radiant neighbor, but he’s also singing to himself: the one still in the closet as a boy in Baltimore, the one slamming sounds together on some blog in 2006, the one searching for an artistic identity, the one we meet, now, finally at peace with himself. “I’m still moving, I’m still moving, I’m still moving,” he sings, pained, as the song peters out. He’s assuring us, but really it feels like he’s reminding himself. When you’ve been stuck for this long, even the smallest hint of clarity can feel heaven-sent.","Naeem Juwan steps away from the Spank Rock persona on an album that drifts between manic experimentation and somber fury. It’s the work of a freer musician, one unburdened by internet hype.

Drug Dealing Is a Lost Art EP,RMR,by: Stephen Kearse,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5ee29bdb8813ffa92664d9c8/1:1/w_160/Drug%20Dealing%20is%20a%20Lost%20Art_RMR.jpg,2020-06-15 05:00:00,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/rmr-drug-dealing-is-a-lost-art-ep/,CMNTY CULTUREWarner,"In the months since his Rascal Flatts homage “Rascal” went viral via a cheeky video pairing sweet singing and leering guns, RMR has cultivated a hazy mythology. He grew up “between” Buckhead, Atlanta and Inglewood, Los Angeles, cities a continent apart. He’s influenced by Kanye, Keith Urban, and Gary LeVox, but he’s not a country musician or rapper; he’s a “new-age artist.” In videos and in meetings with record execs, he wears a ski mask, insisting on anonymity because he wants “people to listen with their ears, not their eyes.” On his debut EP, Drug Dealing Is a Lost Art, all this intrigue falls flat. There’s nothing fun, intriguing, or provocative about his music. Despite all his fusionist posturing, he’s got the personality of a wiped smartphone: sleek, modern, empty. Though RMR favors pageantry on camera, on record he’s modest. As seen in the “Rascal” video, which opens with him belting out a melody, he prizes his voice. It’s a resonant, powerful instrument, and the clip hinges on its bluesy allure to sell the emo-trap shtick that follows. The EP is just as dependent on his voice, but without the video’s props, RMR is exposed. His music is weirdly both overwrought and inert. He croons with the force and intensity of a Rod Wave or 070 Shake but fails to make that strain compelling. The flexes on “Nouveau Riche” are hollow despite being delivered at full blast. “Now I got the life I wanted/Hoping I don’t fuck it up,” he sings, sans context. He could be talking about signing a record deal or replacing his PC with a Mac. There’s no way to know and little reason to care. He often speaks of escape and arrival without elaborating or embellishing his journey. From his perfunctory mentions of poverty and struggle on “Welfare” to the motivational-speaker talk of “Rascal” (“I came up and so could you”), RMR’s tales are so generic and grayscale that Westside Gunn lands the most colorful line on the album with a lazy throwaway: “My shooter got a big beard/He from Philly.” RMR’s elusiveness is clearly supposed to cultivate some sense of mystery, but there are no breadcrumbs to follow, no puzzle pieces to assemble. He describes the world and himself so impersonally it feels like he was literally born yesterday. He supplements his poor writing with his bland melodies, convinced that the act of singing is inherently charismatic. “Codeine got me in my feelings/ Codeine got me in my feelings,” he repeats on “Dealer,” yelping the second line. He’s attempting to evoke the mania and delirium of a bender, but the actual result is more “heard ‘Codeine Crazy’ once.” That’s his bit, essentially: I’ve heard it all. This might be compelling if there were a sense of audacity to his mash-ups, but he’s got the stage presence of a floorboard. Compared to Rina Sawayama treating nu-metal like a sacred art, Pink Siifu channeling hardcore into black rage, or Breland hamming up “My Truck” with that delightful, over-the-top drawl, RMR has no imagination. His take on hybridity is so staid and lifeless that he can’t even sell “Fuck twelve” on “Rascal;” in his mouth it feels less like a battlecry and more like a Spencer’s Gifts executive spitballing t-shirt ideas. It’s that abiding feeling of vacancy that makes Drug Dealing Is a Lost Art feel so thoroughly feckless and inept. On “I’m Not Over You,” a track co-produced by Timbaland and Andre Brissett, RMR revisits the country- rap template that made him viral. Given Timbaland’s role in legitimizing and innovating country rap in the form of Bubba Sparxxx, the collaboration had the potential to give depth to RMR’s professed genre agnosticism, to show there was a vision underlying all the mythmaking. Instead, we get an uninspired ballad about some brokenhearted schmuck over a flavorless mix of banjo and bass kicks. Sometimes a mask is just a blank face.","Months after his country-rap video went viral, the purposefully mysterious artist releases an EP with all the personality of a wiped smartphone.

MTV Unplugged,Liam Gallagher,by: Chris O'Connell,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5ee28c0edc55f46b4632302b/1:1/w_160/MTV%20Unplugged_Liam%20Gallagher.jpg,2020-06-15 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/liam-gallagher-mtv-unplugged/,Warner,"From the beginning, Oasis’ foundation showed visible cracks. Beyond the excesses of drugs and drinking, there was the Gallagher brothers’ fundamentally unstable relationship. But their most seismic fracture came in 1996, when the band was tapped to record an MTV Unplugged session. At the time, earning a place on the show signified real cultural cachet, following a string of multi-platinum Unplugged albums by Eric Clapton, Mariah Carey, and Nirvana. Yet lead singer Liam Gallagher infamously abandoned the group right before they took the stage to begin taping, leaving his older brother, guitarist Noel, to handle vocals. Liam hung in the balcony, swilling beer and heckling his brother. It proved to the world (and perhaps to Noel himself) that Oasis’ primary songwriter—and the technically superior singer, though lacking Liam’s self-destructive panache—was perfectly capable of handling double duty. Nearly 25 years later, Liam Gallagher gets his second chance, which begs the question, why is the semi-mothballed MTV Unplugged trotting out the Gallagher who spurned them instead of the one who used the gig to prove his own worthiness as a frontman in his own right? Liam knows that he can never correct for going AWOL in 1996. He even alludes to his walk-off while introducing “Once,” which he dedicates to former Oasis guitarist Bonehead—who joins Gallagher for the performance—for being the only member of the band to play a second Unplugged session. But MTV Unplugged is, at the very least, an indication that the irascible, charismatic frontman can still hold a crowd in the palm of his hand for long stretches. One of those is a remarkable three-song run of Oasis tunes, beginning with Be Here Now’s “Stand by Me” and ending with (What’s the Story) Morning Glory?’s “Cast No Shadow.” Sandwiched in the middle is an ultra-rare performance of Definitely Maybe non-album track “Sad Song” that is alone worth the price of admission. Of course, that stretch, like the entire tracklist, is the result of a bit of sequencing trickery. As televised, the MTV Unplugged concert, recorded in August 2019 and aired the following month, was much more heavily tilted toward Liam’s own songs, including a chunk of five solo cuts that opened the concert. The album, though, is whittled down to just 10 tracks—five by Oasis and five by Liam—and cagily scatters the Oasis songs throughout, the better to stoke the listener’s nostalgia (and ensuring that Oasis fans who aren’t Liam lifers never have to hear more than two unfamiliar songs in a row). The Liam-written songs are largely a drag, just as they are on his studio albums, save for “Now That I’ve Found You,” a tiny post-Oasis diamond hiding among the weeds, presented in an even better version here as a melancholic acoustic guitar and piano ballad. After a pint or two of Guinness, you might even be able to convince yourself that his brother composed it. But a few of Liam’s clunkers are elevated in the live format, helped greatly by the Hull crowd, recorded high in the mix (and rapturously chanting, “Liam! Liam! Liam!” between songs like it’s 1996 again). Gallagher, who notably struggled to find his place in the music world after Oasis cratered and his ensuing band, Beady Eye, petered out, may have found the recipe for his ongoing success outside the studio. Take the opener, “Wall of Glass,” which appears on his 2017 solo debut, As You Were. There, it’s a simulacrum of the Screamadelica wall of sound: blaring harmonica, crunchy guitars, heavy handclaps, and thudding bass. Live, though, the harmonica is swapped out for a tasteful organ, the trio of female backing vocalists shines, and Gallagher’s damaged but affecting voice, now cracked and weathered after decades of cigarettes and alcohol, can’t hide. Stripped of artifice, Gallagher’s words—dripping in cliche, to be sure—ring truer here. The Brothers Gallagher have long been known to speak cryptically to each other through song. (According to 2019’s largely hagiographical Liam Gallagher documentary, As It Was, they don’t speak in real life at all, but a report from February hints at a reconciliation). So while “Wall of Glass,” with its talk of throwing stones, is often read as an attack on Noel, Liam’s recent steps toward self-reflection give the song new meaning: The wall might just be a mirror.  In the years since he first recorded the single, Liam has, in his own way, sanded down his rougher edges, appearing almost remorseful about his estranged relationship with his brother in As It Was and apologizing to his family a few months before the taping. As charming as Gallagher’s nasally Mancunian snarl can be on MTV Unplugged, it’s borderline cartoonish on “Once”—he rhymes “pyuwel” (“pool”) with “skyuwel” (“school”)—though perhaps for Liam diehards this is a feature and not a bug. But the Hull crowd lifts him up again (he later called them “biblical”) and before long, “Champagne Supernova” is on the horizon. Here’s where Noel’s absence is felt for the first time, like a phantom limb. On (What’s the Story) Morning Glory? the mega-hit clocks in at seven and a half minutes, and it  would occasionally stretch considerably beyond that in concert, thanks to the psychedelic shredding of its songwriter, Noel. It’s not quite clear how that kind of grandeur is supposed to translate to an unplugged set, with or without Noel, which is why its inclusion is strange to begin with; even more so its abrupt ending at less than three and a half minutes in. Around the two-minute mark, as Liam reaches the cathartic “Why? Why? Why? Why?” bridge, the strings swell and the crowd is on the edge of ecstasy—but without the sublime noise to shape the song’s dramatic arc, it turns out to be a bridge to nowhere. “Champagne Supernova,” the stunted closer of MTV Unplugged, is a metaphor for Liam Gallagher’s output in a post-Oasis world. It’s an amuse-bouche in lieu of an entrée.","After infamously bailing out right before Oasis’ 1996 MTV Unplugged performance, the irascible, charismatic Britpop anti-hero gets a second chance.

Muzak pour ascenseurs en panne,Brigitte Barbu,by: Ben Cardew,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5ee38daf8813ffa92664dac1/1:1/w_160/Brigitte%20Barbu.jpg,2020-06-15 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/brigitte-barbu-muzak-pour-ascenseurs-en-panne/,Circus Company,"Brigitte Barbu, better known as French deep-house enigma Pépé Bradock, is an impossible man to pin down. After a brief scuffle with the mainstream at the end of the 1990s thanks to “Deep Burnt,” a jazzy house classic of immaculate poise, Bradock has retreated—or perhaps advanced—into a career of inscrutable oddity. His erratic release schedule wanders between moments of beauty, fear, and utter outlandishness. Muzak pour ascenseurs en panne (Muzak for Broken Elevators), only Bradock’s third album in 24 years—following the 1998 singles anthology Synthèse and last year’s appropriately titled collage effort What a Mess!—continues this beguiling and sometimes frustrating trend. The album is neither the “abstract hip-hop LP” that Bradock promised, nor an example of the deep house with which he made his name. There are no beats, for a start, and barely a hint of the constructive patterns that house typically demands; the songs instead ooze from one point to another like microorganisms in the primordial soup. Most eye-opening of all is the role that the electric guitar plays: Muzak pour ascenseurs en panne was recorded and mixed during a one-week studio residency with the guitar employed, he says, as “a brainwashed instrument, mirroring machines and computers.” The instrument’s presence shouldn’t be a total surprise—Bradock started playing guitar at 14, graduating to Parisian jazz-funk bands before house took over—but the instrument has barely featured in his music since. On the evidence of the exquisite, often entrancing, patches of guitar melody on Muzak, I wish it had. Bradock has a gift for the kind of atmospheric guitar traces that Steve Hillage employed on albums like Rainbow Dome Musick, notes misted onto the mix like the suggestion of rain. Rather than mirroring the machines, though, the guitar flows into them, dissolving the border between digital and analog as it joins Bradock’s collection of esoteric drones, trills, and pulses. The album’s best moments coincide with the strongest melodic work. “Dae Boj DeMoya” washes in on a gorgeously tender melody whose hybrid guitar/synth tone falls somewhere between a whistle, pedal steel, and slide guitar; its haunting tint of Americana evokes the KLF’s journey into the American dreamland on Chill Out, with the melody becoming progressively more enveloped in electronic curlicues as the track develops. “Sainte Amante” travels from spidery guitar lines to airy chords, which bathe the song’s electronic arpeggios in shimmering light, while “Mistori” uses a sublime combination of reverbed guitar and synth drone to trace layers of melody, ending up like Apollo: Atmospheres and Soundtracks if Brian Eno had set his controls for the heart of the sun rather than the moon’s barren surface. Muzak’s tendency to meander is both its charm and its Achilles’ heel. When the musical ideas are strong it is a luxury to drift along on Muzak’s wave, free from the distraction of beats or extraneous elements; when they are weak or ill defined, as on “Ray Z,” a track most notable for sporting a comically duck-like squelch, the music feels rather slight, more a collection of sounds than anything approaching a song. On an album this short—with just six songs and five brief sketches to its name—this feels wasteful. Perhaps completing an album in one week was an unrealistic proposition for an artist who confesses to work at the pace of a “Burgundy snail.” Then again, the tendency for dazzling self-sabotage is typically Pépé Bradock, a hugely talented producer whose obduracy is part of the package. There are no simple answers to the Bradock riddle, and nor would you want them. This week he’s Brigitte Barbu, recording amorphic, guitar-led caprice; the next week he won’t be, but Muzak pour ascenseurs en panne remains another perfectly imperfect milestone along Bradock’s exasperating golden path.","Pépé Bradock made his name crafting immaculate deep house, but for more than a decade he has delighted in flouting expectations. Guitar in hand, he does just that on this album under a new alias.

So Tonight That I Might See,Mazzy Star,by: Quinn Moreland,Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5ee27dfddc55f46b46323027/1:1/w_160/So%20Tonight%20That%20I%20Might%20See_Mazzy%20Star.jpg,2020-06-14 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/mazzy-star-so-tonight-that-i-might-see/,Capitol,"In a 1994 interview, a journalist asked Hope Sandoval, the vocalist of the dream pop group Mazzy Star, how she would respond to those who find the band “too dark.” Sandoval’s answer was simple: “That’s part of reality. Sometimes life is dark.” Mazzy Star made music for those who implicitly know this to be true—introverts, wallflowers, loners. People who spend enough time lost in their own minds to understand that melancholy is often mistaken for misery. Raised in a large Mexican American working-class family in East Los Angeles, Sandoval was comfortable lingering in shadows behind a wall of long, dark hair. As a child, she was intensely shy and struggled in school. Like so many thinkers and dreamers, Sandoval found refuge in music and often ditched class to listen to records. She especially adored the Rolling Stones, particularly their covers of blues classics like Robert Johnson’s “Love in Vain” or 1965’s The Rolling Stones, Now!, which includes versions of Bo Diddley, Willie Dixon, and Chuck Berry songs. At night, Sandoval would sneak into nightclubs to catch performances by bands like Rain Parade, the Dream Syndicate, and the Three O’Clock, leaders of an L.A. ’60s psych-pop revival called the Paisley Underground. The co-founder of Rain Parade, David Roback, was quiet like Sandoval, completely engrossed in his own vision. Wilfully enigmatic by most accounts, he idolized musicians like John Lennon and Syd Barrett, trailblazers who pushed their art past pop beginnings toward avant-garde ends. Roback left Rain Parade after one record (1983’s Emergency Third Rail Power Trip) and soon partnered with former Dream Syndicate bassist Kendra Smith and started a psychedelic blues project called Opal. Meanwhile, Sandoval and her friend Sylvia Gomez had formed a band of their own, a folk duo called Going Home. A demo tape made its way to Roback, who ended up producing the group’s first—and never released—record. In the middle of Opal’s winter 1987 tour supporting the Jesus and Mary Chain, Smith suddenly quit the band and abdicated her rock’n’roll throne for a quiet life in the woods. Down a vocalist, Roback called up Sandoval, who flew across the country to help finish out the tour, something she later called “the hardest thing I ever did.” Back in California, Roback and Sandoval began writing together. They decided that this new material required its own identity. “Opal was David and Kendra’s thing,” Sandoval succinctly explained. “So we started Mazzy Star.” Mazzy Star’s debut, 1990’s She Hangs Brightly, is a staggering introduction to this communion.  The record sounds straight out of a haunted honky-tonk, all country twang drowned by a hefty coat of feedback; Entertainment Weekly put it best when they said it was “as if Patsy Cline had lived long enough to record with the Velvet Underground.” She Hangs Brightly was a success by indie standards, garnering positive reviews and airplay on college and alternative-rock radio. Meanwhile, the band’s label, Rough Trade, declared bankruptcy and dissolved, leaving Mazzy Star without a home. Then, in 1993, after being picked up by Capitol, Mazzy Star emerged from two years in near-seclusion with their major-label debut, So Tonight That I Might See. Produced once again by Roback, its 10 tracks hover on the border between consciousness and a dreamland that quietly threatens to tip over into a surrealistic nightmare. Though it evokes musical touchstones like Cowboy Junkies, So Tonight That I Might See feels totally removed from time or place—a retreat completely inside the dark corners of two introverted minds. “I prefer the Rip Van Winkle approach to art,” Roback once quipped. Mazzy Star’s dream pop contemporaries, like the UK’s Cocteau Twins or East Coast Ivy Leaguers Galaxie 500, each had their own unique energies; here, finally, was the dream pop for the glitzy decay that is L.A. At the heart of Mazzy Star is the tacit interplay between Roback and Sandoval, outsiders who built a creative partnership based on trust and intuition. “There’s an improvisational element to what we do,” Roback explained to Guitar Player in 1994. “We don’t play dots on a page. My approach to the guitar is in response to the song’s feeling.” As a result, the destination of each song is unclear; their heavy-lidded melodies can be so atmospheric that you could seemingly fall through them for an eternity. “Bells Ring” is driven by a lethargic guitar and an undercurrent of fuzzy bliss. “Nobody asked about your story/Nobody wants to know the reason why,” Sandoval sings with languor. The eerily seductive “Mary of Silence” and an acoustic cover of Love frontman Arthur Lee’s “Five String Serenade” sound like ghostly lullabies lingering in the purgatory of twilight. Especially sparse is “Into Dust,” which recognizes the inevitable end of love, life, and pain: “I could possibly be fading/Or have something more to gain/…I could feel my eyes turning to dust/And two strangers turning into dust.” There’s no sense of resolve on these songs, only self-obliteration and the inescapable hypnosis of a waking dream. Rather than shoving uneasy feelings—longing, mortality, loneliness—away, So Tonight That I Might See bears witness. The effect is the revelation of comfort amid solitude. Sandoval yearns for a world just beyond her reach on the swooning, organ-drenched “Blue Light.” With a steady softness, she strings together impressions of this distant land, the shimmer of light reflected in a best friend’s eye, a ship sailing towards nameless harbors, and “waves crashing me by.” Mazzy Star’s downcast softness existed in stark contrast to their ’90s alternative counterparts, who tended to express their discontent through fury and a fuck-you. So Tonight That I Might See has moments where the images remain ethereal but the music grows harder, intoxicated on a mix of elation and exhaustion. “But she’s just like lightning/She goes right through you/Then you know you’ll never be the same,” Sandoval moans on “She’s My Baby,” whose bluesy grunge sounds straight out of Twin Peaks’ Roadhouse. If her voice is usually on the verge of floating away, on these songs she sinks into the earth and digs into an almost carnal hunger: “After I stuck my hands/Into your ground/And pulled out somebody else’s son/I felt a little unfortunate/A little mistake.” So Tonight That I Might See is remembered for its gauzy torpor, but it is equally full of moments like this: reminders that abstract, internal feelings like sadness, longing, agony, and regret can be articulated in corporeal ways. All of their dusky amblings come to a head on So Tonight That I Might See’s monumental title track, a seven-minute gothic hallucination that echoes the wandering mysticism of the Doors’ “The End” or the Velvet Underground’s “All Tomorrow’s Parties.” Channeling the incantatory spirits of Patti Smith and Stevie Nicks, Sandoval conjures a vision of transcendence: “Come so close that I might see/The crash of light come down on me.” As her spoken word spirals into a monochrome trance, Roback jabs at his guitar as if he’s sticking a fork into an outlet over and over again just to feel the shock. When the track finally waltzes into the dark, it wraps up without fanfare only a sudden stillness. Rather than letting So Tonight That I Might See disappear into an ether of its own conjuring, Capitol pushed the album’s most accessible track for nearly a year. “Fade Into You” opens the record with a pensive acoustic guitar, quivering slide, and gently shaking tambourine. From this reverie comes Sandoval’s sandalwood murmur: “I want to hold the hand inside you/I want to take a breath that’s true.” “Fade Into You” is a haunting ode to all-consuming desire, perhaps one of the best ever penned. (It borrows a chord progression from another song about evanescence, Bob Dylan’s “Knockin’ on Heaven’s Door.”) Its melody burns like the last candle of the evening with delicate, curliquing tendrils of smoke. Like all of Mazzy Star’s music, “Fade Into You” urges you not to think but to feel; it’s dream pop in the purest sense. Capitol’s director of marketing put it a little differently to Billboard: The track had serious makeout potential. “All those kids have boyfriends and girlfriends, and they like to neck, and I don’t think they listen to Barry White,” the executive explained. The label’s faith paid off: By summer 1994, “Fade Into You” was a hit, and by 1995, So Tonight That I Might See went platinum. Countless shows and movies have used the song to soundtrack slow dances and unrequited romances ever since. But mainstream success was not Mazzy Star’s goal and they refused to let the indie fame induced by “Fade Into You” compromise their individuality. (“Follow anybody, is that what you do?” Sandoval sings on “Unreflected” with atypical contempt.) Roback and Sandoval were known for being painfully shy in interviews. They had equal trouble performing live, thanks to nerves and the intimate, lulling nature of their songs. “Once you’re onstage, you’re expected to perform,” Sandoval explained to Rolling Stone in 1994. “I don’t do that. I always feel awkward about just standing there and not speaking to the audience. It’s difficult for me.” In a clip of the band’s set at Neil Young’s 1994 Bridge School Benefit, Sandoval stands alone at the lip of a massive stage, folding into herself. Without the cover of darkness, she looks like she wishes the earth would open up and swallow her whole. As the popularity of “Fade Into You” bloomed, Capitol decided that the song needed a new visual. The original music video recalled the song itself: a series of fleeting glimpses shaded by shadows. The second version, directed by Kevin Kerslake (who had filmed the clip for She Hangs Brightly’s “Halah)” is considerably brighter and weaves blue-toned performance footage with shots of the band wandering through a blazing Southern California desert. Crucially, the VP of A&R at Capitol told Billboard, the new video “showed Hope more.” The undertext of a decision to push a female frontperson further into the spotlight is that beauty (or more cynically, sex) sells. But capitalizing on Sandoval’s image perhaps unintentionally trivialized her role in the band, making her seem like merely the Nico to Roback’s Lou Reed. (Nico, of course, spent a lifetime reclaiming her agency from the myth of the muse.) But So Tonight That I Might See is not about keeping one musician behind a curtain. The creative partnership between Roback and Sandoval is the heart of Mazzy Star. They knew that the band would wilt if pushed into the spotlight more than necessary. So they stuck to the shadows, two quiet, introspective souls deeply engaged in one dream. Together, they drifted into a hazy unknown.","Each Sunday, Pitchfork takes an in-depth look at a significant album from the past, and any record not in our archives is eligible.

Up All Nite With Prince: The One Nite Alone Collection,Prince,by: Sheldon Pearce,Contributing Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5ee1426b7bb7acb328d5643a/1:1/w_160/Up%20All%20Nite%20with%20Prince-The%20One%20Nite%20Alone%20Collection_Prince.jpg,2020-06-13 05:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/prince-up-all-nite-with-prince-the-one-nite-alone-collection/,Sony,"At the turn of the millennium, the party seemed to be over for Prince. Between 2000 and 2002, he lost his father, got divorced, remarried in secret, found religion, and defended Napster in his war against a tyrannical music industry infrastructure. On top of all that, the albums he released were panned or disregarded. Even in the wake of his death, in 2016, this period was remembered as controversial or underwhelming. A reissued box set recorded during this time, composed of the 2002 album One Nite Alone…, the two-part One Nite Alone… Live!, One Nite Alone, The Aftershow: It Ain’t Over, and the Live at the Aladdin Las Vegas DVD, aims to rectify that. Taken on the whole, the box set is proof of his astounding skill as a performer, the depth of his catalog even in its shallow end, and the consistency that he brought to his concerts, night in and night out. It remains one of the few archival documents of his sometimes awe-inspiring, sometimes maddeningly mercurial, but always adventurous live experience, and the most complete picture of how he put together his shows. The discs are arranged by intensity: from the intimate, heart-to-heart balladry of One Nite Alone... to the rowdy, collaborative jamming of his after-shows. Originally released exclusively through NPG Music Club, the subscription-based access portal Prince created to share his music online in the early 2000s after a battle with Warner Bros., the box set focuses on songs that are often overlooked, forgotten, or downplayed as part of a career downturn. Perhaps none of his albums from this era suffered more from this perception than One Nite Alone…, which is easy to overlook in its austerity. Just as 1998’s The Truth pared down his songs to acoustic guitar and wispy vocals, on One Nite Alone... Prince embraced a similar reduction. Its alone-at-the-piano vibe, made ethereal and informal by his stirring voice, conjured a sort of one-on-one illusion. Very few of the ballads in his catalog are stripped so bare and exhibited so nakedly. These aren’t in the realm of his best-written songs. In fact, when closely scrutinized, some are crudely scrawled love poems. But the subtle, spellbinding force of him on the bench unattended undercuts a lot of the clumsiness of the lyrics. The understated flourishes ring out resoundingly: the flowing, elegant piano solo on the title track, every audible tap of the sustain pedal; the way the minor chords from “Have a Heart” resurface late into “Objects in the Mirror”; the steady crescendo into the satisfying climax of the shrieked words holy wine on the Joni Mitchell cover “A Case of U.” “Avalanche” is a gripping song about the mounting wave that is racism and how the music business exploits Black artists, a practice this album was trying to fight with its exclusive release. The hushed atmospherics of One Nite Alone… open up into the jazzy revels of One Nite Alone… Live!, a two-disc show compilation arranged from stops on the 2002 tour. The shows, which occurred in the run-up to the official release of One Nite Alone…, featured very few songs from the album on the marquee. Instead, it focuses on his born-again 2001 gospel album, The Rainbow Children. Released in the wake of his conversion to the Jehovah’s Witnesses, The Rainbow Children is usually remembered as one of Prince’s most frustrating albums—a dramatic and sudden shift toward jazz with an irksome, omnipresent voice-of-God-like narration and a muddled concept to boot. In a review for Rolling Stone, Arion Berger called the record busy and portentous, “church interludes that are too mystical to carry earthly convention.” However, the same things that made those songs seem over-involved as album cuts made them perfectly suited to his live show. That kind of self-indulgent musicality and preacher’s theatricality fit the stage. There have never been funkier songs about theocratic order. Anyone unwilling to be receptive to change was kindly asked to leave: “For those of you expecting to get your Purple Rain on: You’re in the wrong house.” The shows transformed the album from misbegotten lecture to lively celebration. In these moments on stage, his virtuosity became a bridge to the divine. With a reimagined New Power Generation backing him, featuring three saxophone players (Maceo Parker, Candy Dulfer, Najee), a trombonist (Greg Boyer), Rhonda Smith on bass, John Blackwell on drums, and Renato Neto on keyboards, the songs erupt to life. The lounge-ready arrangements of these songs fill a room. “Muse 2 the Pharaoh” is a bizarre cut with a wack rap verse, but live, the keyboard glows, the guitars are heavier, and the groove is inescapable, rendering the rest moot. “1+1+1 is 3” breaks out into a full-on funk jam (“Somebody get me another suit ready, I’m about to sweat this one out!” Prince exclaims as he goes). The nearly 13-minute official debut of “Xenophobia,” a massive introduction for the band and a crash course in what patrons were getting with this tour, is as inspired as it is insulating. This was not an experience for the casual fan; this was an extension of the NPG Music Club vision. He implies as much: “If you drove up here in a Little Red Corvette/You might be surprised at what you gon’ get.” With the benefit of hindsight, it is proof that even the most inaccessible Prince music could be activated simply by establishing a direct connection between him and his public. Eventually, every Prince show had to satiate the broader audience that made him a pop icon (or at least it had to pretend to try), and so disc two of One Nite Alone… Live! is for the generalist Prince fan who hadn’t heeded his earlier warnings. He does a cursory scan of the hits and fan favorites. Of course, Prince, out of spite, would rarely commit to playing any of those songs in full. As if out of obligation, he sprinkled in abbreviated renditions of “The Beautiful Ones,” “Free,” and “Sometimes It Snows In April” while drawing out Lovesexy’s “Anna Stesia” to 13 minutes. He snuck in two seven-minute Rainbow Children deep cuts. Some folks likely got all dressed up to only hear 40 seconds of “Diamonds & Pearls” and a minute and a half of “I Wanna B Ur Lover.” This section of the main act is, strangely, the most difficult to sit with. He was not as committed to these old songs as he was sharing the messages of his newer ones. The crowd largely had the opposite desire, and that clearly frustrated him. But even his muted protest couldn’t completely stifle the showman in him. Only a few notes into “Adore” the crowd is whipped into a frenzy. His voice seems translucent, and the light that passes through it only better illuminates the baffled audience stunned by his effortless range. His sense of timing and feel for dynamics are unmistakable. Just for a moment, he transforms from religious leader to sex symbol, and there the sexual becomes sacred, which feels fitting for a song about sex so good it makes angels cry. After a sultry performance of “One Nite Alone...,” his falsetto twinkling, “Adore” forms a little suite with “I Wanna B Ur Lover” and “Do Me, Baby,” and not even their truncated lengths can nullify the building momentum or the effect they have on the crowd. He treats listeners to his interpretation of “Nothing Compares 2 U,” the song that Sinéad O’Connor made famous, turning her drawn-out bridge into a fidgety fit of kinetic energy. He brings a sassiness to “How Come U Don’t Call Me Anymore?” And even dressed down, “The Beautiful Ones” maintains much of its power, centered by his tender singing. His simpering delivery, like he’s withdrawing into a shell, only makes you yearn for more. For those willing to wait, more often came in the form of a second show, one more freewheeling than the first. This part of the experience is captured on One Nite Alone, The Aftershow: It Ain’t Over, the most essential disc in the box set. Even listeners turned away by his religious musings and his aversion to the classics can appreciate the unquestionable skill at work here, a snapshot of one of Prince’s hallowed live traditions. The after-show phenomenon was born during the Parade tour in 1986, according to Matt Thorne, the author of Prince: The Man and His Music. After debuting the after-show practice at two London gigs, Prince perfected the form with a third secret show at France’s small jazz venue Le New Morning that featured mutating arrangements and his father as a special guest pianist. After that, the after-show would become one of his signature moves, a live experience all its own. These shows were weirder, looser, more intimate, more improvisational, and more epic. Prince had a running dialogue with his band, giving orders on stage and correcting mistakes, and while at his stadium shows he liked to tease out the hits, during after-shows, B-sides, rarities, and covers could evolve into ten-minute opuses. If Prince had been a bit more discerning, he might’ve released one of his more acclaimed after-shows—the nearly mythic set at The Hague’s Het Paard Van Troje in 1988 during the Lovesexy tour, perhaps—in its entirety, as its own live album. No such document exists, and though many live songs are scattered across his titanic discography, this release is one of only four official full-length live recordings of Prince. Two of the other three, C-Note, a five-song sample of outtakes from One Nite Alone… tour soundchecks, and Indigo Nights, cut from after-show performances at indigO2 nightclub in London in 2007, feel unsubstantial and incomplete. The last and recently shared soundtrack to the 1985 concert video, Prince and the Revolution: Live, is a great set from Prince and his best band, but as a ticket to his concert exploits, it’s less comprehensive. The Aftershow remains the best (official) second-hand experience for being in his audience. The Aftershow is the rewarding culmination of the box set’s steady arc. After the solos, sermons, and serenades of the first three discs, the last is blissful excess. He completely reimagines “The Ballad of Dorothy Parker” and “Girls & Boys.” The George Clinton-featuring “We Do This” is joyous funk-rap interplay between two masters. The definitive version of “2 Nigs United 4 West Compton” is far more percussive, its spring-loaded bass line and supercharged keyboards building out an unstoppable locomotive engine, prompting Prince to yell out, “I want to sing but it’s too funky.” If One Nite Alone… showcases Prince as the single-spotlight vocalist and the main act discs showcase Prince the bandleader, then The Aftershow is an exhibition for Prince as one of the greatest guitar players ever. “Joy in Repetition” is a masterclass. The deeper you get into the 11-minute “Peach (Xtended Jam),” the sturdier his rhythmic guitar becomes, even as the players around him dive in and out of solos. He amps up “Alphabet Street” and leads the band through a speed-run with some furious playing. By the end of its nearly hour-long run-time, he’d put on a clinic to rival his Super Bowl showcase. Few seemed to understand presentation the way Prince did. After his death, his former publicist and manager Jill Willis said he was always dressed in something he could feasibly wear on stage. Several people who interacted with him over the years remarked that you would smell him before you saw him, and that he smelled like lavender. Being in view so often, he took great care in selecting how he packaged himself. He took this same approach with his craft as a performer and entertainer. Across the many varying discs of the One Nite Alone… box set, a recluse puts his showmanship on display.","This reissued box set from Prince’s unloved early-’00s period provides proof of his astounding skill as a performer and the depth of his catalog even in its shallow end.

Built to Spill Plays the Songs of Daniel Johnston,Built to Spill,by: Jayson Greene,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5edfbafd659f71df9cf557cf/1:1/w_160/Built%20to%20Spill%20Plays%20the%20Songs%20of%20Daniel%20Johnston_Built%20to%20Spill.jpg,2020-06-13 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/built-to-spill-built-to-spill-plays-the-songs-of-daniel-johnston/,Ernest Jenning,"In 1994, Built to Spill took one of Daniel Johnston’s most famous songs—the hymnlike “Some Things Last a Long Time”—and made a glorious mess out of it. Where Johnston’s original was just his tiny voice and some echo-drenched piano, Built to Spill’s was a manned space vessel launch. Frontman Doug Martsch sent his distorted guitar like a kicked-over paint can into every corner, soloing for minutes on end. It was maybe ill-advised and probably a little dubious and definitely fantastic. In 2017, Johnston’s booking agent contacted Built to Spill with this cover in mind. The idea was to bring Martsch and his new version of the band—longtime members Scott Plouf and Bret Nelson had quit after 15 years—to play a few shows backing Johnston on what turned out to be his final tour. As Martsch remembered it recently, talking to SPIN, the shows went fine, smooth enough—maybe a little weird. Johnston’s stamina wasn’t great. When it was over, Martsch approached Johnston, venturing that perhaps they could do this again. To which Johnston, true to form, said, well, he didn’t know. Built to Spill Plays the Songs of Daniel Johnston emerges from this fitful meeting of two diffident souls. Martsch shares plenty with Johnston—his frail, sweet tenor, most obviously, but also the childlike clarity of his most memorable observations. When Martsch covers an artist he admires, he usually excavates something unusual—see his cover of the Smiths’ “Reel Around the Fountain” or “Please Please Please Let Me Get What I Want,” for example, or his sneaky 2003 side project Boise Cover Band, where you can hear that Midwestern choirboy voice tackle two-tone reggae (Dobby Dobson’s “Loving Pauper”), glam rock (David Bowie’s “Ashes to Ashes”), and even Captain Beefheart. But Martsch misses the opportunity to commune with Johnston’s music, or to do anything with it, really. On the 11 songs here, he resists the urge to plug in his distortion pedals and sail away. Johnston’s songs are simple constructions, pieces of white drawing paper with only a couple of marks and a few folded lines, and the streamlined trio version of Built to Spill honors this simplicity. Martsch strums an acoustic guitar, Jason Albertini plays simple root bass notes, and Steve Gere’s drum kit ticks quietly. These renditions are subdued, and while they’re sweet, they also feel like rehearsals—nothing of the strange and messy spirit that animates Johnston’s music, nothing of the fairytale darkness that makes it haunting, sneaks into Plays the Songs. “Bloody Rainbow” sounds like “Bloody Rainbow,” but without the little hiccups in Johnston’s voice, without the slight flubs his calloused hands make on the guitar strings. “Honey I Sure Miss You” sounds like “Honey I Sure Miss You” but minus Johnston’s reedy intensity. Martsch has always been a shy vocalist, but he comes off detached here, even a little blank, and his readings here have all the conviction of a Hi, How Are You? sticker. Martsch’s most expressive instrument, by far, remains his guitar, the outlet for all his unrulier feelings. When he allows it into the mix, things get livelier. Johnston’s rickety “Good Morning You” is polished until it sounds a little like “Fly Around My Little Miss,” from 2001’s Ancient Melodies of the Future. “Heart, Mind & Soul” is one of Johnston’s more devastating creations, a defaced doo-wop song trapped flailing under a rock. Played by Martsch’s new band, it sounds a little like a Sun Records outtake. And “Mountain Top” colors in the arrangements with some lovely background vocals and whammy bar-bent guitar chords. But otherwise, he doesn’t express or exert himself. It’s too bad. Martsch has a somewhat vexed relationship with trying—the album on which he tried his hardest, 1997’s masterpiece Perfect From Now On, had to be recorded three times and nearly broke him, to the point he could barely bring himself to play the songs on the album’s tour. Anyone who has seen his band live more than once knows there is a gulf of difference between Doug bored and Doug engaged. He seems to be growing more half-hearted as the years go on. Built to Spill’s output has been sparse as of late—just one album in the last decade—and Martsch admits regularly in interviews to long stretches of writer’s block and self-doubt. In that same SPIN interview, he confessed he looked back on his band’s “Some Things Last a Long Time” cover with mortification. “I think of that song as being so beautiful and delicate,” he said, “and us just rockin’ it out like that—it just seems so random and arbitrary to me in retrospect. Like, what were we thinking?” He may have a point—the cover does go on for a little while, and maybe it gets a little ridiculous—but at least it was a statement. Built to Spill Plays the Songs of Daniel Johnston feels a bit like a shrug in comparison.","Following a tour together in 2017, Doug Martsch & co. tackle an album’s worth of the Texas singer-songwriter’s work, but they fail to capture the strange and messy spirit that animates his music.

Like Water,DJ Boring,by: Jesse Dorris,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5ee261668813ffa92664d94d/1:1/w_160/Like%20Water_DJ%20Boring.jpg,2020-06-13 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/dj-boring-like-water/,Technicolour,"In the fall of 2016, YouTube tastemaker Slav posted a video of a track by someone called DJ Boring. It quickly went viral; currently, it has more than six million views. With its soft pads and acid glow, “Winona” is moody and midtempo, with an undeniable if familiar vibe—maybe undeniable because of its familiarity. Some tracks become instant classics because you’re not sure if you’ve heard it before, or want to hear it again, or both—so you rewind. “Winona” became a standard in the “lo-fi house” scene, which took up the expressive techno of Larry Heard sort of how Boards of Canada took up the eerie crispness of RZA. It stood out not only because of its emotional efficiency, but also its star: a teenaged Winona Ryder, beloved once again after her magnificent performance in the first season of Stranger Things. In a sample from a TV interview, she says: “It is difficult to be judged… I remember one casting director… who stopped me and said: You are not pretty enough to be an actress. You have to find something else that you want to do.” When heard on a bedroom laptop, her words sounded like a welcome call-out of misogyny. When heard at, say, 5 a.m. while rolling on a dark, crowded dancefloor, they could feel like falling into Narcissus’ pool, but also a call to change, somehow. The ambivalence is as affecting as the 909 groove. Since releasing the track on DJ Haus’ E-Beamz label, DJ Boring, also known as the Australian-born, London-based Tristan Hallis, has put out increasingly direct dance music on Shall Not Fade sublabel Lost Palms and his own Vienna. His new Like Water arrives on Ninja Tune’s vital Technicolor imprint, joining the ranks of club faves like Peggy Gou, Octo Octa, and Hieroglyphic Being. Its four tracks sound like the big rooms Hallis was playing in before all the rooms closed; the songs were engineered for the eye-popping A/V set he created with New York-based visual artist Amir Jahabin. If his previous work played with sentiment, this EP is pure sensation. Like “Winona,” the opening title track features vocals, but here it’s just a gurgling voice repeating, “Like water.” Is it a metaphor? The sound palette is pretty wet, with drippy percussive hits and a flowing melody. Or is it a command? It’s banging enough to work as a set crescendo, that moment after which your pals stumble to the bar for refreshment. (It’s definitely a moment when combined with Jahabin’s video, which swaps the neon colors of rave-standard fractals for pastels, the geometric forms for sleeves of French fries, and the clichéd trains-and-tunnels content for a deeply strange road trip starring grinning risographic blobs.) “Another Day” is even splashier, with echoes of the early swing of Herbert, the swagger of Cajmere, and the teeth-grinding brightness of Orbital. Indeed, Boring’s current sound as heard on the EP carries the torch for those torch-spectacled brothers, among the first to move techno from the club to the stadium, for better and worse. “Stockholm Syndrome” might convince the EDM hordes to stop selfie-ing and dance, but given the possible collapse of festival culture, it may never get the chance. Whatever. It starts out dewy, a kind of dubby techno that gradually solidifies into bright Chicago house, as if dried by the sun—the sound of brighter days ahead. The EP’s highlight is its closer, “Seems Like Yesterday,” whose nostalgic title fits in with its sound, an assemblage of blasts from the past: Depeche Mode’s pop-concrete samples of hammers and sticks, and the happy-sad rush of Eurodisco, for sure. But mostly, well, trance. While Lorenzo Senni has occupied himself deconstructing it for Warp, and Boring’s labelmate Octo Octa, along with Eris Drew, propose it as a pleasure principle, on “Seems Like Yesterday” Boring refreshes trance’s potential for high-speed romance. Its “yesterday” is the millennial poise of DJ Sasha, whose epic “Xpander” is a kind of template. Boring repeats a simple melody for seven minutes or so, but it widens and grows. Halfway through, a shivering synth crystallizes a hook. If “Winona” was a teenage crush, “Seems Like Yesterday” is young love in all its stupid glory. Its heart is on its sleeve, in its synths. Gloriously, there’s no difficulty in it at all.","The Australian producer trades the moody house of his breakout hit, “Winona,” for big-room techno suggestive of the kinds of clubs he has gotten used to playing in recent years.

Your Hero Is Not Dead,Westerman ,by: Hubert Adjei-Kontoh,Associate Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5ede7a73dad4216f71c678ee/1:1/w_160/Your%20Hero%20Is%20Not%20Dead_Westerman.jpg,2020-06-12 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/westerman-your-hero-is-not-dead/,Partisan,"On Your Hero Is Not Dead, Will Westerman creates gentle music made up of elements from experimental pop albums. Talk Talk is an obvious influence (the hero alluded to in the album’s title refers to the band’s late vocalist Marc Hollis), but so are folk musicians like John Martyn and Joni Mitchell. Martyn’s synthesizer explorations led to his 1977 album One World, and Mitchell’s 1985 record Dog Eat Dog combined hypnotic production and lyrics in service of pop prophecies of doom. With the help of Nathan Jenkins, aka producer Bullion, Westerman achieves a synthesis of these previous experiments, fusing together whimsical curiosity and technical proficiency. Over a backdrop made of the sounds of the past, his lucid yet uncomplicated lyrics interrogate the uncertainty of the present. When Westerman asks, “Am I taking it too far?” on “The Line,” it feels like he is questioning a choir made up of himself; later in the song, he engages in a one-man call and response. Bullion’s production matches Westerman’s ambivalence. “The Line” takes several detours before returning to its original route; it is music prone to glitches. A distended guitar opens the track and floats around Westerman’s ruminations, which are both concrete and fantastical. The soundworld recalls the work of ’80s producer Thomas Dolby, full of small changes that lead to strange moments: a voice stretched at the beginning of the bar is suddenly paired with bongos; a cut-up chorus is utilized as the backbeat to a new lyric. It’s like hearing Westerman question himself in real time. These alterations don’t overwhelm the central contemplation; instead, they make what could be a simple chord-strummer into a revelation. When a small guitar solo appears halfway through, it calls attention to itself through its sheer normality. Westerman’s voice functions as a guide. Take “Easy Money,” an energetic, angry kiss-off to someone or something. Its opening swirl of guitar and synth dissipates once Westerman finally says, “I don’t doubt/Somebody’s working harder now.” His words are mirrored by a drum machine and the suggestion of a guitar. As the aggression grows, so does the anxiety; beeps appear and disappear, while a synthetic clatter threatens to overtake his voice. At moments, Westerman slows down and repeats a phrase like “stay still” or “that’s enough,” allowing the machinery of the production to whirl around him. The electronic interruptions can be traced back to Martyn’s One World, and the vocal percussion wouldn’t sound out of place on New Order’s Power, Corruption & Lies. Yet the tossed-off lyricism and world-weary contempt are all Westerman. On the album closer and title track, Westerman melds the cast-off nature of his songwriting to the bric-a-brac of Bullion’s production. The instrumentation hovers around his guitar playing; it’s the album’s clearest folk song and his most direct statement. The basic structure and lyrics sound as though they were improvised in the back of a van, close to the end of a tour: “Busy working/Busy avoiding.” Bullion pairs Westerman’s rumination with subtle production, isolating piano notes, throttling synths, and gently doubling the chorus. Mutual devotion to perennially out-of-vogue styles has allowed Bullion and Westerman to create an album that sounds novel; the beauty they make is secondhand and stumbled upon. It’s a product of obsession that can be engaged without knowing all the references; it sounds good, sometimes even better than its antecedents. Bullion’s production reworks elements from ’80s AOR records; Westerman creates songs out of leftover sentences. Their music proposes that the judgments of yesterday aren’t written in stone, and that what we believe today is only as stable as we think it is.","The British songwriter’s excellent debut mines the gentle and detailed sounds of soft rock’s past, while his lucid yet uncomplicated lyrics interrogate the uncertainty of the present.

Nomad,TENGGER,by: Marty Sartini Garner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5ee12bc57bb7acb328d563ce/1:1/w_160/Nomad_TENGGER.jpg,2020-06-12 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/tengger-nomad/,Beyond Beyond is Beyond,"When the Japanese poet Matsuo Bashō began the journey he would immortalize in The Narrow Road to the Deep North, he carried only a paper coat, a bathrobe, rain gear, pen and paper, and a few mementos. TENGGER makes their trip with little more than a synth and a pump organ. Like Bashō’s landmark work of travel writing, the Japanese-South Korean couple’s second album for Brooklyn psych label Beyond Beyond Is Beyond, Nomad, is an impressionistic portrait of life spent in transit. Even when they linger to take in the view, the six songs here are largely formed around the idea of movement as a virtue in and of itself. They unfold with the logic of linked haiku; the individual sounds—gently arpeggiating analog synthesizers, droning harmonium, processed field recordings, the occasional tick of percussion—aren’t necessarily interesting in themselves, but by arranging them into elegant relationships with one another, TENGGER imbue them with a sense of rustic majesty. TENGGER’s music often lacks rough edges and internal tension, which forces them to find less obvious ways of generating movement, something they do successfully across the album. They take cues from Neu! and Aguirre-era Popol Vuh, creating distinct floating worlds bonded by singer itta’s featherlight vocals and drawing them into one another with graceful precision. Throughout, field recordings of rushing and trickling water and, in “Eurasia,” what sounds like the distant sound of train tracks, introduce notes of motion and unpredictability into their hermetically sealed micro-environments. But what makes Nomad instantly compelling is the way it both reflects and celebrates the feeling of a peaceful morning walk. Both “Bliss” and opener “Achime” set off with two-chord shuffles, shifting from one to the other at a steady hiker’s clip. In “Achime,” the chords land with a muffled crunch that evokes footfalls, while an organ swells to fill every available groove. itta recently said the group’s aim is to “make music that connects with the sounds of nature and the spirituality of making the music within that moment.” Accordingly, every note is given space and allowed to find its place in the greater whole. itta and synthesist Marqido’s roles almost seem to lie more in guiding the sounds than in producing them; their steady hands and faith in their own sense of timing make Nomad feel intensely personal. itta and Marquido’s skills—their horticultural attention to detail and patience with their own material—are best-suited to moving at a walker’s pace. Like all good pilgrims, they know the true blessing lies in the journey itself, but that doesn’t stop them from pushing Nomad to a glorious destination. Closer “Flow” is goosed by a thick drone that gives the couple a rare counterforce, something to react to. They move together in ecstatic union, radiating sounds that they shape until they’re all resonating together on a single chord, everything tuned to the same pitch. And when the water once again comes streaming in near the album’s end, it’s clear and bright, fed by the deep wells of feeling TENGGER have drawn from the natural world.","The latest album from the meditative duo is an impressionistic portrait of life spent in transit.

Songs We Sang in Our Dreams,Let It Come Down,by: Daniel Felsenthal,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5edfaa49ba4f90402ea6f32c/1:1/w_160/Songs%20We%20Sang%20In%20Our%20Dreams_Let%20It%20Come%20Down.jpg,2020-06-12 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/let-it-come-down-songs-we-sang-in-our-dreams/,Joyful Noise,"Kramer, Let It Come Down’s main songwriter, fosters the sort of mystique you might expect of someone who goes by his last name alone. Born in 1958 and adopted by a Long Island car salesman and his wife, Kramer made a reputation as an independent, staunchly anti-industry figure well before he learned his birth father was a famed PR executive and his biological brother was high up at Interscope. Kramer’s own label, Shimmy-Disc, offered bands verbal agreements instead of written contracts and forged some of the iconic indie sounds of the 1990s: Kramer discovered Ween, produced all three of Galaxie 500’s records, and some of Low and Half Japanese’s most influential work. Beginning in the late ’80s, Kramer and performance artist Ann Magnuson performed as Bongwater. The band’s four LPs drew their sense of political conviction from the revolutionary 1960s, while tapping into the day’s slacker culture with a loose sound and titles like Double Bummer and The Power of Pussy. After Bongwater split, Kramer went solo, releasing the two-hour-long The Guilt Trip and the comparatively focused The Secret of Comedy. Although he composed beautiful classical pieces like The Greenberg Variations, his own rock efforts were largely overlong and smattered with profundity, like a genius novelist’s first drafts. Let It Come Down feels like a counterweight to a mischievous career, a project that Kramer—once an avowed improviser—has worked on for years. He weaves the weight of time into its structure, stretching simple lines into blank canvases for emotion. On Songs We Sang in Our Dreams, boyish humor blooms into something mature and feminine, thanks largely to the band’s crystalline vocalist, British singer Xan Tyler. Perhaps more important, the duo’s debut embraces a logic Kramer fled until his seventh decade: It plays to his strengths. Among them is a knack for picking collaborators, an idiosyncratic musical vernacular, and an unparalleled ability to make music sound “hall-sized,” the term Galaxie 500’s Dean Wareham used to describe the producer’s treatments on their classic song “Tugboat.” Songs We Sang in Our Dreams is cavernous with strings, synth-aping Les Paul, and instrumental cameos, whether tanpura drones or cuíca samples. A dream-pop record from one of the genre’s great architects, it jettisons messy rock for delicate arrangements and surprising vocal accompaniments. Tyler is a perfect foil, and a stark contrast to previous Kramer collaborators like Magnuson and Half Japanese’s madman-in-chief Jad Fair. While those musicians were notable for their archness, Tyler leaves an impression because of her technical skill, delivering precise, roving melodies that play off the structure provided by Kramer’s acoustic guitar and piano chords. The pair’s harmonies may feel reminiscent of Low, particularly since both duos rely on male-female tension. But while Low’s dynamic often feels romantic, Let It Come Down give the impression of two people alone, singing with identical longing from separate isolations. Kramer’s unique vernacular helps distinguish Let It Come Down from the tradition he helped create. Samba rhythms—a career-long predilection—form the backbone of “Fingers,” a song that clashes wonderfully with the project’s otherwise consistent mood. The recorded speech in “One Moon,” “Three Wishes,” and closer “Four Hands” evokes Bongwater, but instead of forefronting agit-prop messages, the tracks stand out for their meticulousness, the repetition and timbre of human voices building to something ambiguous yet filled with doom. Like the sand sliding down the neck of Ed Ruscha’s hourglass on the album’s cover, Kramer and Tyler are two people out of time, writing wistful, dread-filled songs for a planet in a similar situation. “I’ve lost interest in music that makes people laugh,” Kramer told Magnet magazine in 2007. “I want people dipping their toes in a pool of tears. In such an ugly world, beauty is the only true protest.” Let It Come Down fulfills the lofty, admirable goal that he set for himself. This won’t sound like protest music, yet Songs We Sang In Our Dreams rises far above the ugliness of the everyday before it sets us down, reflective if not enraged, in a place where everything seems beautiful.","In collaboration with singer Xan Tyler, the musician and producer Kramer offers a thoughtful, cavernous-sounding counterweight to a mischievous career.

Madison Tapes,Yaya Bey ,by: Pete Tosiello,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5edfa03d0932d361b216232c/1:1/w_160/Madison%20Tapes_Yaya%20Bey.jpg,2020-06-12 05:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/yaya-bey-madison-tapes/,Elevated,"The Brooklyn singer Yaya Bey effortlessly mingles the personal and political. On 2016’s The Many Alter-Egos of Trill’eta Brown, a largely acoustic outing inspired by the work of Audre Lorde, she contrasted protest anthems with first-person accounts of romantic torment. Embracing the tradition of neo-soul songwriters like Erykah Badu and Jill Scott, powerful women who were forthcoming about their own hangups, Bey radiated resolve, not sorrow. In Bey’s estimation, there’s no reason the revolution shouldn’t be led by people who, like the rest of us, have shitty exes. “I’ve been spendin’ my life on a paycheck,” she sings on “i got a promotion and i still miss you” from her third album, Madison Tapes. “When does my real life start?” Her storyteller’s eye imbues ordinary scenes of home and work with an enthralling freshness. Madison Tapes seeks common ground between neo-soul and the deconstructed R&B of Mereba and Ivy Sole, the soft guitar chords of Bey’s earlier records interspersed with sampled and synthesized instrumentals. On “sorry i unfollowed you” and “april showers,” Bey surveys a relationship gone sour, asking on the latter, “Who hurt you, boo? Bad enough to hurt me, too?” Both tracks have a faint vinyl hiss and looped horn arrangements, devolving into studio chatter as the songs transition into discursive interludes. Madison Tapes has a spontaneous, meandering energy. There’s a pinging noise lurking on most of the tracks that sounds suspiciously like a smoke detector in need of a battery change. Unseen collaborators come and go, departing with jokes and bromides. Bey maintains a cool composure, singing with a throaty purr that ascends into an airy whisper. On the late highlight “morgan views,” she volleys between somber melody and a conversational delivery, rapping, “It’s a fine time to read between the lines, my dear/It’s a fine time to have a change of mind, my dear.” (Bey’s father, it bears mentioning, is the categorically laidback Hempstead rapper Grand Daddy I.U., whose 1990 Cold Chillin’ debut Smooth Assassin remains something of a lost classic.) On the Trill’eta Brown tape Bey spoke earnestly of revolution, flitting among characters to inhabit differing perspectives. Madison Tapes is comparably insular, its pursuit a self-derived liberation consistent with the ethos of her neo-soul forebears. That’s not to say it’s any less idealistic—Bey eagerly seeks deliverance from bad sex, bad vibes, and the pulsing anxiety of dead-end jobs. “paterson plank,” the descending chords of which evoke Vinia Mojica and Pete Rock’s 1998 duet “Mind Blowin’,” concludes with a yearning final verse that keeps it from lapsing into mere mood music, Bey singing, “Forever is a long time/To be wasting somebody’s time.” On the inspired “unseen freestyle,” her runaway rap verse mourns lost love as well as peers lost to nine-to-five drudgery. There’s also solace to be found in the record’s convivial atmosphere, particularly “that’s pressure,” on which Bey and fellow-Brooklynite guest rapper Juu Mcfuckit bemoan an unraveling fling. Mcfuckit raps with eye-rolling insouciance (“She lyin’, she tell me she love me, I say I love you back/Shorty sent me soul-searching, couldn’t use Google Maps”) and a palpably New York attitude. While some of the spoken interludes are considerably more profound than others, they cast Bey’s malaise in a universal context that complements the more overtly political themes of her earlier projects. There are attestations to love, surrender, and abandonment: On “what truly is,” a young woman speaks with startling prescience about the power of photography to both convey and garble stories of human will.

The Freelancer’s Blues,Dougie Poole,by: Allison Hussey,"Associate Staff Writer, News",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5edfbe2d10c4091e9eff7a0f/1:1/w_160/The%20Freelancer's%20Blues_Dougie%20Poole.jpg,2020-06-11 05:00:00,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/dougie-poole-the-freelancers-blues/,Wharf Cat,"Late in The Freelancer’s Blues, the second album from the could-be country singer-songwriter, Dougie Poole heaves out a confession that barely approaches hyperbole: “How sweet it would be to not have a brain.” This ability to approach mid-level malaise with empathy and a smirk sits at the heart of his songs—it’s a pleasure to witness. There’s the three overlapping protagonists on “Vaping on the Job,” each of whom turns to a pocket sacrament for relief on the clock, with thudding percussion mirroring the heavy sigh that accompanies such a move. The concept of workplace vaping is its own kind of “Take This Job and Shove It” for those too broke, tired, or burned out to make the rallying cry themselves; Poole’s salute makes for a woolier companion to Brandy Clark’s “Get High.” The Freelancer’s Blues clocks on the spectrum of “cosmic country” with some extra synths thrown in for good measure. Poole’s loose approach gives him the ability to smudge and slip between the boundaries of AM-gold country and the wry modern observations of rapscallions like Joshua Tillman. It bears a covert spirituality that speaks to a larger sense of finding calm in situ. Poole’s philosophizing is humble and unobtrusive, braiding neatly with the album’s fuzzy scenery. And though country music has often been lumped in among the signifiers of white evangelical Christianity, Poole shares his own conclusions on how to connect with higher meaning without so much liturgical baggage. The idea powers “Buddhist for a Couple Days,” where Poole waxes about searching within over a bar-band shuffle. “All you gotta do is breathe and you can set those troubles free,” he promises. Poole’s songs aren’t laments so much as lessons. His psych-lite arrangements create a more comfortable space for turning a bad ending into a new beginning. In assessing his worries, Poole recognizes that sometimes the only course of action is to shrug it off and keep moving. “Los Angeles” begins with an anxious guitar lick that parallels the opening tumble of “Jolene,” with Poole soon realizing that escaping to greener pastures won’t solve any of his problems. He finds ironic humor in pulling “California Here I Come” out of the Great American Songbook to soundtrack his turn away from a scuttled dream. Even “Natural Touch” takes a unique angle on the awkward discomfort of encountering a fizzled-out fling in public. Rather than dwelling on the embarrassment of a not-quite-heartbreak, Poole celebrates how these incidents make room for something more fulfilling to come along. He brings back his philosophizing in a smooth croon, noting how “Sometimes you gotta be the bug, it’s true/But sometimes you’re the windshield, too.” The most difficult element to square on The Freelancer’s Blues—which Poole’s tongue-in-cheek lyricism acknowledges—is that many of the problems rarely transcend mild to moderate discomfort. Its lack of urgency is as much a liability as it is a respite. Still, Poole’s genial attitude makes for a nudge of encouragement, channeling a quiet certainty that the sun will return from behind the clouds once again. Though it lands a bit light, Poole’s earnest vulnerability makes room for more profound reckonings to flourish in low stakes.","The cosmic country of the Brooklyn singer-songwriter is both wry and heartfelt, offering a kind of tongue-in-cheek spiritual audit for a modern age.

hybtwibt?,Space Afrika,by: Colin Joyce,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5ee135cf7bb7acb328d563d0/1:1/w_160/hybtwibt?_Space%20Afrika.jpg,2020-06-11 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/space-afrika-hybtwibt/,self-released,"Space Afrika, the Manchester duo of Joshua Inyang and Joshua Reid, have always made music that directly responds to their surroundings. In the past, they’ve spoken of the way that Manchester itself, a city of grey skies and concrete, has informed the sparse, overcast nature of their productions. “Everything we do and are is a product of our experience,” they told Truants in 2016. “Manchester is the place that made us [...] It would be hard, maybe even ignorant not to translate that into the sounds we create.” Often wordless, but full of meaning, their downer dub techno and fractured ambient instrumentals have always been a conscious reflection of the world as they see it. Their new release hybtwibt?—a mixtape based on material from the duo’s recent broadcast on NTS Radio—comes from a similar place, though it operates on a somewhat grander scale. Rather than looking just at their city, the mixtape seems to attempt to capture the energy vibrating through the world at this particular moment in history, as people across the globe take to the streets to protest police violence against Black people and other people of color, only to be met with more violence. (They've said that proceeds from the sales of this release will go to a variety of nonprofits, including Black Lives Matter Global Network and NAACP, among others.) Like a lot of their music, the general mood is downcast and foreboding, full of droning synthesizers and the distant hiss of reverb-hazed noise. But the music is intercut with meaningful samples and field recordings of protests, wrenching cries, wailing sirens, and profound monologues. The tracks are dense. “Wanna know,” for example, feels more emotionally complicated than much of the music they’ve released to date, pairing a slowly unfolding piano piece with a person talking about the ways that the state antagonizes and entraps people who are already struggling. Were it not for the speech it accompanies, you might call the instrumental ambient, but the feelings it evokes are more complicated, balancing on a knife’s edge between the placidity associated with such music and an urgent call to action. Other tracks take different tacks. “Kitty” is built on overlapping samples of disembodied voices from lost soul songs. It’s ghostly and shattered, an elegy for a world that shouldn’t have to be this way. Tracks like that, as well as the slivered interludes strewn amid the longer pieces, make hybtwibt? feel of a piece with the dizzying music that the critic Adam Harper once described as “epic collage.” Producers like Chino Amobi and Elysia Crampton stack disparate melodies and samples together to make disorienting music for a society that is more disorienting by the day. Working in this mode, Space Afrika pull together samples that capture the crushing feelings that have come up in these protests, channeling grief, pain, frustration, and desperation all at once. And yet this record isn’t overwhelmed by these feelings—at its heart, it’s not especially austere. There’s this glowing core amid the chaos, a beauty in the maelstrom, that you can feel them gesturing toward on nearly every track. “DairyDay4” foregrounds this sentiment most clearly, featuring a person talking about the joy they feel about an impending wedding, over an instrumental that swells and swirls in a way that’s reminiscent of classic RPG soundtracks. It’s a spark of warmth and light, a distant dream that a better world might be possible, amid the reminders of how awful the one we live in can be.","The dub techno of the Manchester duo’s latest mixtape attempts to capture the violent energy vibrating through the world at this particular moment in history.

"Meditations Mixtape, Vol. 1",Ami Dang,by: Vrinda Jagota,Contributor,"https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5edfb101659f71df9cf55799/1:1/w_160/Meditations%20Mixtape,%20Vol%201_Ami%20Dang.jpg",2020-06-11 05:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/ami-dang-meditations-mixtape-vol-1/,Leaving,"On last year’s Parted Plains, Baltimore ambient musician Ami Dang used other people’s stories to express herself, looking to Indian and Middle Eastern folktales as inspiration for avant-garde, beat-driven sitar and synth soundscapes. The songs were admirably dynamic and ambitious—boisterous one moment and brooding the next—but also felt disorganized. The mesh of sounds never quite related to the texts they referenced, or coalesced into something greater than their sum. On her latest project, Meditations Mixtape Vol. 1, Dang slows down and turns inwards, making music inspired by the Sikh hymns her family listens to together. A few months ago, Dang’s uncle and aunt became sick with coronavirus. Her mother asked her to perform a shabad, or a hymn, at their family’s online celebration of Vaisakhi, a Sikh holiday. After her performance, Dang was reminded of the power of her voice and of these prayers. Over about 10 days in April, while in isolation, she recorded the four songs that appear on this EP. Dang’s emotional connection to this music is evident; these are some of her most engulfing and moving songs yet. Though devotional music often improvises from traditional song structures, most Hindustani classical music begins with a freeform introduction when the musician plays with melody and sets the mood but hasn’t yet introduced any meter. The second phase is marked by the introduction of a percussionist, and the third by an increase in tempo. With the exception of “Simplicity Mind Tool,” which uses an acidic synth line to establish a gnawing sense of propulsion, Dang’s songs linger in the exploratory phase. Each meanders and expands, filling the room like a pleasant fog. On “Satnam Waheguru” and “Tension, Tension, Release,” synth and sitar seem to intertwine on the atomic level. They create a droning cloud that cushions Dang’s chanted vocals, which sound richer and more mature than ever. “Ajooni” is wordless but similarly expansive, as a twangy sitar line ambles across starry synth. Inspired by introductions, these songs do sound somewhat unfinished, like exercises rather than completed pieces. If they only unfurled a bit further, they would be even more immersive. As it is, each song on Meditations Mixtape Vol. 1 feels a bit like talking to a good friend on the phone and being forced to hang up just as you move beyond casual chit chat. The album title suggests future iterations, and you can’t help but think ahead, as if this first volume were a warm-up to something greater. Though Meditations Mixtape Vol. 1 grew from personal experience, it is also intended to be of service. Whether Dang is chanting the Sikh meditative phrase “Satnam waheguru,” or simply singing the notes “ni” and “sa” (the Hindustani classical equivalent of “ti” and “do”), she encourages the listener to ruminate on unity and togetherness. The lyrics of “Simplicity Mind Tool”—“By meditating and vibrating on oneness with humanity, you will become steady and stable”—make this intention explicit. In liner notes accompanying “Tension, Tension, Release,” Dang encourages the listener to breathe in and out with the music, meditate, and “re-evaluate your relationship to the material goods around you and remember that the only thing that is going to get us through this is love, belief in humanity and lifting up everyone.” Though the song is certainly soothing, you’ll have to do the work of personal transformation yourself. But for me, who doesn’t come to the album with particular spiritual intent, the power of these songs lies not so much in their utility as in the poignancy and specificity of Dang’s perspective. It can sometimes be hard to understand what unity and togetherness mean in the abstract, but it’s not difficult to empathize with someone who’s moved to pray for a family member. There’s a new focus to these songs, a confidence that’s blossomed as Dang strips back her sound and relays stories only she can tell. When you imagine her recording them in solitude, reaching out to someone unreachable, the already evocative vocal harmonizations transmit a gut-wrenching mixture of mourning and hope.","A devotional prayer for ill relatives inspires some of the Baltimore ambient musician’s most engulfing and moving songs yet.

Thank You For Using GTL,Drakeo the Ruler,by: Matthew Ismael Ruiz,"Associate Staff Writer, News",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5ede5dc0fd5cd0dd694067c2/1:1/w_160/Thank%20You%20For%20Using%20GTL_Drakeo%20The%20Ruler.jpg,2020-06-10 05:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/drakeo-the-ruler-thank-you-for-using-gtl/,Stinc Team,"The Los Angeles County Sheriff’s department might see money from Drakeo the Ruler’s latest album before he does. Thank You for Using GTL was recorded over the phone from the county’s Men’s Central Jail using phone service from GTL (formerly Global Tel*Link), a company that controls about half of the market for telecom services in correctional facilities. Their exorbitant rates, which extort families’ access to inmates, have been under fire from politicians and advocacy groups alike, but persist largely because they cut sheriffs in on the scam. The company has guaranteed the L.A. County Sheriff millions of dollars each year in fees, providing plenty of incentive to keep the predatory systems in place. This context is important because GTL is more than just a symptom of a corrupt capitalist corrections industry; on Thank You for Using GTL, it’s a passive collaborator. Drakeo quite literally could not have made it without them. He’s spent much of the last three years at the MCJ, first on a gun rap, then later on murder, attempted murder, and criminal street gang conspiracy charges. Acquitted of the murder charges, the District Attorney re-filed the conspiracy charges; Drakeo remains in custody without bail as he awaits a new trial. He released Free Drakeo earlier this year, a compilation mostly comprising remixes and previously released material. But with a depleted vault of verses and no access to a studio, any new material would have to be made from the MCJ. That new material is a stunning depiction of what it means to be a gangsta rapper in 2020: constantly surveilled, presumed guilty until proven innocent, pressure applied from all sides. Producer JoogSZN paints the scene with a moody G-funk drum machine that perfectly matches the crunchy analog texture of Drakeo’s phone vocals, and his subdued mix leaves room for Drakeo’s verses and hooks to remain prominent. There’s a dissonant reversal of the flown-in producer tag; the interruptions of the GTL system’s automated messages (“This call is being recorded”) serve as a jarring reminder of the surveillance state in which his music is made—Big Brother is watching you. When JoogSZN’s actual tag gets dropped in, it feels more like an ad-lib. His touch is light, and the production so well-matched, that without the “Thank you for using GTL” interstitials it would be easy to forget this record was made on a jail phone. And that fact is no small feat. There are a few ways to release an album while incarcerated: The cleanest requires some foresight, building up a backlog of verses and songs before entering custody that can be released while you’re incarcerated, like 03 Greedo’s recent, furious recording run before serving a 20-year sentence on drug and gun charges. C-Murder recorded his vocals for 2005’s The Truest Shit I Ever Said on a portable recorder during visits from his attorney. But the phoned-in method presents unique challenges. Despite the massive revenues they generate, prison telecom companies like GTL are notorious for providing dismal audio quality on their prison communications. And audio delays make it difficult to rap on beat; Gucci Mane’s producer Drumma Boy admitted that he had to chop up his vocals in order to make them fit the tempo of the beats on the BurrrPrint (2). That Thank You for Using GTL overcomes these obstacles is a remarkable achievement from both rapper and producer. Drakeo’s flow is so laid-back it often sounds horizontal, but his internal metronome allows him to slide in and out of the pocket without ever losing the beat. And the aesthetic is crucial to the story. Drakeo didn’t choose to cut the record while incarcerated, but the jail, and his jailers, had a hand in how it was made, and how it sounds. It’s impossible to ignore, and each listen invites a closer read of its circumstances. (The irony of those circumstances is thick: The FBI investigated gangs within the Sheriff’s department itself, and the former L.A. County Sheriff currently sits in federal prison, found guilty of obstructing a different FBI investigation into abuse and misconduct in the county jails.) Still, Drakeo remains in the MCJ, where he’s lived for much of the past two years without ever being convicted of any crime. Yet there’s not an ounce of desperation in his voice. A master at flipping classic one-liners into memorable hooks, Drakeo displays an uncanny ability to expertly wield repetition to create rhythm with the vocal track. His style is equal parts Snoop Dogg and Juvenile, smooth yet aggressive, oozing confidence and effortlessly expanding the English language with coded street slang. In one of the album’s few moments of levity, he decodes his shorthand for being unimpressed by large sums of cash (“300,000 in a duffel? Do a backflip or sumn, bitch”). The content mostly remains in line with his past work; rhymes about his namesake assault rifles, checking social media tough-talkers IRL, and his predilection for shopping at Neiman Marcus. If he was worried about rapping gangster shit while on trial for gangster associations, you wouldn’t know it until the album’s final moments. And yet one of the more disturbing elements of L.A. County’s case against Drakeo is their repeated use of his lyrics as evidence of his criminality. It’s crucial to their case, which argues that the Stinc Team is a criminal organization, and therefore their music is indicative of their criminal intent. It’s one of the few specifics of his case referenced on record. The album’s closing track “Fictional” pokes fun at the DA’s obsession with his lyrics (“This might sound real, but it’s fictional/I love that my imagination gets to you”), pointing out that no other art form gets exploited like this in criminal court (“You’re not gonna hold Denzel Washington accountable for his role in Training Day”). As cold as Drakeo sounds throughout Thank You for Using GTL, its strongest moment is its most vulnerable. The brooding bass and electronic snare on “Pressure” set an ominous mood, and Drakeo—in a rare move—admits the weight of the force applied against him. “I can’t think about my past, I got Alzheimer’s” he raps, his focus firmly trained forward, acknowledging that “Loyalty always comes with a price, it’s the life/just keep your mouth shut.” He knows the implications of the raw deal he’s been handed. But he refuses to buckle under the pressure. Drakeo’s charges aren’t the result of his actions. His prosecution hinges solely on his associations—where he’s from, the people he grew up with, and the music that they make together. In a city where underfunded services languish while police budgets expand into the billions, it’s hard to consider the resources consumed by the county to prosecute Drakeo multiple times for the same incident and see it as anything other than a vendetta against a rap crew known to publicly disdain the police. He was forced to create the best album of his career from behind bars and, in a cruel twist, to pay his jailers for the privilege to do so. It’s likely the greatest rap album ever recorded from jail—an honor that will provide little consolation if the county’s vendetta is successful.

Shrines,Armand Hammer,by: Paul A. Thompson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5ede60a19bcc962f72cc0d2a/1:1/w_160/Shrines_Armand%20Hammer.jpg,2020-06-10 05:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/armand-hammer-shrines/,Backwoodz Studioz,"In 2003 the NYPD, acting on an anonymous tip, punched through the wall of an apartment in the Drew Hamilton Houses at Adam Clayton Powell Jr. Boulevard and 141st Street in Harlem. Through that hole, officers saw a mattress that had been shredded the way a dog might shred a newspaper and claw marks that reached all the way up to an eight-foot ceiling. The tiger they removed, a Siberian-Bengal mix named Ming, belonged to a construction worker named Antoine Yates. Ming grew as the story spread: 350 pounds, then 425, 450, 500. Yates had acquired the tiger from an exotic animal dealer in Minnesota by falsifying papers to suggest he had land to build a zoo in Sullivan County; he had just been hospitalized after it maimed him in an attack. The fourth song on Shrines, the new album by Armand Hammer, ends with a clip of Yates’s brother being interviewed. “My brother wanted to build a zoo,” he says, maybe a little bit drunk, talking over the music in a club. “He wanted to build a utopia. Because when he looked around him all he seen was destruction in our neighborhood.” The interviewer does not follow up on the spiritual tip. Instead he asks a practical question: How much does it cost to feed a tiger? Shrines is the third LP that Armand Hammer, the duo composed of New Yorkers Elucid and billy woods, have released in the last two and a half years––roughly the same amount of time that Yates kept Ming in his apartment. There are times it turns grim: see, for example, Elucid’s reference to the “prayers up but quickly fallen like sweat on the brow” in the face of a paramilitary police, or the way woods flips the Nas maxim from “Life’s A Bitch” into “that buck that lost the lotto could’ve bought a fucking bottle.” But on the whole Shrines is freer, lusher, brighter than anything the pair has done before, an album that strays into “streets where Siri noted coordinates and was too scared to speak” and sees what might grow from the soil. woods is an extraordinary writer who populates his raps with characters he dangeles like a puppeteer, and with details that unnerve––like the expendable football players who are reduced to “donated brains” that “bob gently in solution,” or the “list of ill-fated quick licks” magneted to the fridge next to permission slips from a child’s school. His aunts tap cheap watches proudly as they tout the “Swiss movement.” His middle-aged men speak to shredded-knee prospects (“You got your whole life ahead of you son… nothing to be ashamed of”) in a way that makes clear they’re really consoling themselves. And his prosecutors consider lenience before stabbing a shiv in the accused’s neck. He’s not just smooth, he’s “graceful as third-generation bomb makers”; he cracks jokes about plagiarizing a famous commencement speech at a “cash-strapped HBCU.” When he recalls his father’s second burial, you can picture the motorcade that curves “like a snake through the streets,” and when a cocky king thinks he can wade into the masses, you see the mob with “claws reaching, eyes like sequins.” One of the most incisive passages comes on “Ramesses II,” named for the Egyptian pharaoh from the “Ozymandias” poems. Of numbing luxury, woods raps: Waves of pleasure, thought you had the best till you taste better
Taste butter
The tailors’ tape measure touch like a lover
Doormens’ faces blend into one another
Glass panels in the sky, with the sound off
Even when you drive you fly, they rarely touched the Porsche Elucid does not lapse into the voices of others. Instead he flits between the chillingly real and poetic abstraction. A typical excerpt comes from the foreboding “Pommelhorse”: “It started as a lesson of achieving dreams and reaching fantastical heights/Ended with us watching the Challenger rocket smoldering on the black and white/Flame licked flame, like lovers do.” His voice––he sounds like a great singer whose vocal cords have been trimmed by a jagged knife—is an indispensable anchor on a record whose beats can be playful, even weightless. The rappers are superb foils for one another; where woods’ language tends to be more straightforward, he will rap elliptically around a theme, while Elucid uses more cryptic phrasing but goes directly for the jugular. On “Slewfoot,” the latter raps of a simmering revolution that the white majority “...choose not to see–the labor’s free, with hidden fees/Razors tucked under wigs and weaves, plus degrees.” Shrines begins by striving for some communion with the natural world. Toward the end of first track “Bitter Cassava,” Elucid raps about the summertime: the “thunder in the sky, rolling wide,” the jars of fireflies with holes poked in the lid. This gives way to a brief solo song of his, “Solarium,” which sounds like a mid-July celebration. All is not perfect, of course—in that song some of the smiling friends on the block have turned informant, and in another the trees felled from forests are chopped up and spit out of “university printers” as counterfeit $20s. This feeling, this combination of wonderment and worry, emerges most clearly in the wrenching “Flavor Flav.” In that song–the Public Enemy hypeman’s cartoon clocks tick down your sprint toward middle age––Elucid recreates, with terrifying detail, the 1968 massacre at South Carolina State University, where three black men were killed and dozens of other protesters were injured when highway patrol officers opened fire at an anti-segregation demonstration. All nine officers were acquitted. Elucid draws attention to what he’s doing in the verse (“Traveling 50 years back, I only moved the pen six inches”), but not before he notes the humbling breadth of time––the future, the unknown, the “possibilities invisible, but endless.” As its title might suggest, Shrines plays in a liminal space between the corporeal and something beyond, the “ritual smoke flumed above the tomb” and the Ruger underneath the robe. On the album cover a cop dangles by a thread on the outside of Antoine Yates’s apartment building, clutching a rifle in one hand, while the tiger rages inside.","The fourth album from the NY duo composed of Elucid and billy woods is freer, lusher, and brighter than anything they’ve done before.

Songs From Northern Torrance,Joyce Manor,by: Arielle Gordon,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5ede6c32fd5cd0dd694067c9/1:1/w_160/Songs%20From%20Northern%20Torrance%20_Joyce%20Manor.jpg,2020-06-10 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/joyce-manor-songs-from-northern-torrance/,Epitaph,"Barry Johnson just wants to be a punk. When Joyce Manor released their polished second album Of All Things I Will Soon Grow Tired in 2012, even he seemed a little unenthusiastic: “I’m really, really happy with it, don’t get me wrong, but at the same time I wish we would have just done a punk record.” Six years later, still seeking to recapture a grittier sound, the band tapped Converge guitarist Kurt Ballou to produce Million Dollars to Kill Me—their most gently melodic record to date. It’s a tension that’s long existed in Joyce Manor’s music, where the wry power pop of Guided by Voices and the fiery, grating screamo vocals of a band like Orchid combine to produce massive hooks. At live shows the band often mines its history, playing early demos to explosive response. What fans who came onboard after 2014’s Epitaph debut Never Hungover Again might not realize is that clean vocals used to be the exception, not the rule, on a Joyce Manor song. With the new rarities compilation Songs From Northern Torrance, they revisit their formative years and finally get the punk record they always wanted to make. As a band whose early interviews directed readers to Myspace, Joyce Manor’s history isn’t necessarily hard to access. Some Songs From Northern Torrance are already familiar: The record opens with crowd favorite “House Warning Party,” and its second half is taken track-for-track from 2010’s Constant Headache EP. Astute fans noted that Joyce Manor removed a rarities compilation with a similar tracklist from streaming platforms just prior to the new record’s release; the band clarified that Songs From Northern Torrance represents a “thoughtfully curated compilation.” Their second run at a rarities album is a chance to redefine their legacy for newer listeners. These sequencing and song choices are less enamored with the bouncing post-hardcore zeal of early tracks like “My Elise,” and more indebted to the embittered anger of folk-punk and screamo. It’s also telling what history the band omits, like Johnson’s early brushes with ska. The compilation’s abrasive edge evokes the basements, bowling alleys, and backyards that dot Joyce Manor’s southern California home. “DFHP?” (short for “Do Fish Have Periods?”) and “Who Gave You a Baby” rely on acoustic guitar and Johnson’s voice to carry their rhythms, trading the power of distortion pedals for earnest, unfiltered vocals and the brushing of fingers against strings. The inclusion of these pared-back demos, rather than the more robust versions released previously, offers a sense of bedroom-recording intimacy missing from their robust, professionally produced recent albums. For longtime fans—those who’ve continued to find catharsis by screaming along at concerts as the band leveled up to headlining slots—it is perhaps a necessary reassurance. The remaining new additions to the tracklist are reminiscent of the scrappy folk-punk scene Johnson frequented pre-Joyce Manor. The clipped vocals and loose, jangling guitar of “House Warning Party” certainly recall the defining traits of aughts folk-punk revival. But it’s the lyrics—a vision of romance as a salve against economic depression and broken homes—that sound surprisingly political coming from a band better known for dejected lamentations on growing pains and arrested development. The narrative recalls the brutally bold lyricism of former tour mates AJJ, while “Fuck Koalacaust” serves as a permanent reminder of the days when obscure SoCal band rivalries could inspire whole songs (both Johnson and Koalacaust claim ownership of the opening riff). As with “Who Gave You a Baby,” hearing Johnson express his rage so clearly and pointedly is invigorating. His scream of “Fuck you, Dad” on “House Warning Party” is the quintessence of frustrated anti-authoritarian anger. The final five songs, all taken from the Constant Headache EP, come closest to Johnson’s elusive holy grail of punk. The rapid cymbal hits and downtuned guitar of “Constant Nothing” convey newfound intensity after half a record of smaller, more anxious acoustic sounds, and the shrieking chords of “Done Right Discount Flooring” build the energy. Other songs, especially popular live picks, lose steam in the studio; setlist staple “Five Beer Plan” lacks ferocity in its recorded version, the long pauses and the absence of a circle pit noticeable even if concerts weren’t indefinitely on pause. There’s also something faintly ironic about listening for marginally higher fidelity in remastered versions of recordings that were often comically blown out in the first place. As a second rarities compilation that shares most songs with its predecessor, it’s hard not to see Songs From Northern Torrance as an effort to hold fans’ attention between new records. But for newcomers looking for a sense of Joyce Manor’s earliest days, these scrappy, bare-bones demos serve as an idealized backstory, one that lends the band a hardened edge as their arc bends further towards pop.","The Torrance, California band’s new and allegedly improved rarities collection is the punk record they always wanted to make, and a chance to redefine their legacy for newer listeners.

Sleepy for President,Sleepy Hallow,by: Alphonse Pierre,Staff Writer ,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5ede698fdad4216f71c678b6/1:1/w_160/Sleepy%20For%20President_Sleepy%20Hallow.jpg,2020-06-10 05:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/sleepy-hallow-sleepy-for-president/,Winners CircleEMPIRE,"Sleepy Hallow and Sheff G, Brooklyn’s best rap duo, may have both grown up in Flatbush, may be known to wear matching Puma sweatsuits, and may have both dropped Great John-produced 2019 solo mixtapes that feel like an extension of each other—but they aren’t the same rapper. Sheff G, with his thunderous voice that sounds like a bowling ball hitting the ground, is the technician. On his May mixtape, One and Only, there’s not a pocket he can’t catch or a verse he doesn’t rap with life-or-death intensity. Sleepy Hallow is not as fine-tuned, on his new solo mixtape, Sleepy for President, whether he’s reflecting on his trauma and paranoia or puffing out his chest, he spits with the kind ease and flash that starts block parties. Listen to Sleepy Hallow’s early 2020 single “Deep End Freestyle,” and it’s straightforward: a single verse, no hook, the beat a simple looped vocal sample. But the song, clocking in at under two minutes, is perfect for endless replays, and has become the viral soundtrack for TikTok dance videos, a treasure chest of New York quotables (“My body different”) and the biggest Brooklyn drill song not made by Pop Smoke. Sleepy Hallow shines when he keeps it minimal like this. The Brooklyn-raised twenty something has a refreshing style. Like Polo G—though not nearly as melancholy or polished—he blends the rushed cadence of traditional drill rapping with a rugged singing voice. On the gloomy “Anxiety Freestyle” he delivers his bars with an appealing looseness that makes pain sound like a good time: “Pop a perc now I’m back to life.” On “All In,” he tackles a flip of Weldon Irvine’s “Morning Sunrise” that has been done better before—Just Blaze’s iconic “Dear Summer” beat comes to mind—but his vocals are sharp and infectious. On the introspective “Bad Luck,” Sleepy smoothly delivers evergreen reflections about living in fear of death, “Demons at my door say ‘they just wanna come inside’/Shots fired, opps shot, another opp died/Cops shot another black guy”—lyrics that resonate harder than usual as the current wave of protests against police brutality continue. But Sleepy’s sound is so bare that one misstep derails the entire track. Typically it’s because of New Jersey producer Great John, whose acoustic guitar-sampling beats—“6 AM in NY” and “Bankrolls”—lack the country soul of similar production behind Deep South singing rappers like Rod Wave and Rylo Rodriguez. Sleepy’s forced duets with Fivio Foreign and Jay Critch, pale in comparison to the tape’s three collaborations with Sheff G. The duo complement each other perfectly: their seamless back-and-forth “Water” and “Molly” should be spilling out of Flatbush car windows in no time. Then, there’s “Don’t Panic,” which follows in the fiery and relentless footsteps of the four previous songs in their “Panic” series—each Brooklyn drill essentials in their own right. Right now it’s clear that what needs to happen is the inevitable Sleepy Hallow and Sheff G joint mixtape. But until then, *Sleepy f or President* will keep their celebration going just fine.","On his new solo mixtape, the Flatbush rapper spits with the kind of ease and flash that starts block parties.

My Heart Is an Open Field,Tenci,by: Andy Cush,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5ede4e21fd5cd0dd69406792/1:1/w_160/My%20Heart%20Is%20An%20Open%20Field_Tenci.jpg,2020-06-09 05:00:00,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/tenci-my-heart-is-an-open-field/,Keeled Scales,"Three scrapes on a guitar string. They arrive each time Jess Shoman finishes the chorus of “Blue Spring,” a song from My Heart Is an Open Field, the Chicago songwriter’s beguiling first album as Tenci. “If spring is green, then I am blue,” she sings, elongating and repeating the last word, twisting its pitch and inflection each time, sending it sailing like a paper plane on a gracefully turbulent journey toward the ground. And then the guitar scrapes, faint but forceful: chrk chrk chrk. The arrangement is minimal, the melodies oblique, placing these seemingly incidental sounds at the forefront of your attention, turning them into the song’s most immediate hook. The scrapes, and the circuitous vocal line they punctuate, express something foggy and difficult to verbalize, beyond the simple dichotomy of the refrain. “Blue Spring” is not about spring, or sadness, so much as it is about chrk chrk chrk. My Heart Is an Open Field, which Shoman assembled with a loose crew of musicians from Chicago’s DIY scene, including guitarist Spencer Radcliffe and bassist Tina Scarpello, appears initially to be a fairly straightforward indie songwriter album. But it quietly eludes convention and expectation, creating its own hermetic world. At times the music’s minimalism recalls the hush of the Velvet Underground’s self-titled album, and at others it gives a small-scale approximation of post-rock. Shoman signals her sensibility with the first notes of opener “Earthquake,” sending crackly transmissions from one guitar to another, a moment of pointillistic interplay untethered to any particular rhythm. When the beat does arrive, it’s the familiar 6/8 of a sock hop slow dance, set to three chords that loop uninterrupted for several minutes. “Stay,” Shoman intones like a mantra, as the three chords reduce to one and the song sighs to a close. The compositions throughout are similarly bareboned, combining stock gestures with patient repetition and moments of bracing originality. The instrumentation is sparse but endlessly inventive, forgoing any excess that might draw your ear away from the tiny details, which are paramount. A cello introduces “Blue Spring” with one repeated note. “Serpent” briefly unravels into noisy sprawl, then recomposes itself and continues as if undisturbed. A synthesizer arrives to double the central acoustic guitar figure of “Joy 2” and the effect is like sunshine appearing suddenly through a canopy of trees. Shoman and her collaborators exhibit a zen-like respect for silence and choose the sounds they use to fill it with great care, suggesting new possibilities with each palette. Chief among these sounds is Shoman’s uncanny voice, high and reedy, with an unsteady vibrato that suggests someone very old or very young. (She took the name Tenci as a tribute to her grandmother Hortencia, who appears on My Heart Is an Open Field via a heartbreaking voicemail at the end of “Blue Spring.” Shoman says her own voice reminds her of Hortencia singing while doing chores, which is not hard to believe.) Sometimes, she uses her unconventional instrument in conventional ways, but the music is most exciting when she abandons naturalism in favor of a stranger, more expressionistic approach. “Fly fast, kiss fast, fight fast, gone gone,” she sings on “Joy,” slurring the consonants together until the words become nearly unintelligible, and the hisses of her breath and clicks of her tongue convey their own meaning. The idiosyncrasies of her singing, set to rudimentary musical ideas expressed on a small and motley collection of instruments, all work together toward a mysterious sustained atmosphere, frequently achieving something greater than the sum of their parts; My Heart Is an Open Field shares some unlikely commonalities with the junkyard blues of Tom Waits, though it rarely sounds similar on the surface. Shoman’s lyrics are often surreal, offering resonant phrases strung together with ambiguous logic. Images repeat across songs, adding to the sense that the album is its own tiny universe: sweat, blood, skin being picked at. “You’re a dog in the window/I’m a loose piece of twine,” Shoman sings in “Hair Sticks.” Two songs later, she inverts the roles: “I can’t pretend I’m not a dog tied to a porch.” “Joy” contains a few of the best of these one-liners, which add up to a celebration of happiness as something ineffable, whose worth is inextricable from its difficulty to sustain: “The wind’s already brushed your hair”; “Make a cake, forget to eat it”; “I’m full of desire, don’t know if its mine.” The two-part suite that begins with “Joy” is the most ambitious, moving, and fully realized passage of My Heart Is an Open Field. Other songs, like “Earthquake” and “Hair Sticks,” are fascinating, but they can also feel unfinished. There’s a tension between wanting more—the pleasant surprise of a new harmony, the power of a narrative to lead us from one line to the next—and recognizing that such concessions might rob the music of its power. “Joy” and “Joy 2” resolve that tension, tracing an incandescent arc that is neither incomplete nor conventional. The final line of “Joy” poignantly imagines an infant being carried off to bed by her mother: “Baby’s tired/Joy give her kiss goodbye.” After Shoman sings it a few times, the music dissolves into a wash of brushed cymbals and the album’s most important recurring motif: a single note, pulsing steadily.","The Chicago singer-songwriter’s debut LP appears at first to be fairly straightforward, but it quietly eludes convention and expectation, creating its own hermetic world.

The Prettiest Curse,Hinds,by: Jonah Bromwich,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5ede5036fd5cd0dd69406794/1:1/w_160/The%20Prettiest%20Curse_HINDS.jpg,2020-06-09 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/hinds-the-prettiest-curse/,Mom + Pop,"The Spanish garage-rock group Hinds built their first two albums on girl-group harmonies and tight melodic songcraft recalling the Strokes or Black Lips. So what did Carlotta Cosials, one of the band’s frontwomen, mean when she recently told NME, “We’d been afraid of pop music for a lot of years”? Maybe she was thinking of drum machines and synthesizers, Diplo and David Guetta. Whatever the case, the trappings of lo-fi garage rock haven’t done much to disguise her band’s own popular appeal. Now, though, Hinds are claiming to have shed their fear, and the band is billing its third album, The Prettiest Curse, as a turn to pop. What that means in practice is an expanded arsenal of instruments and a reduced sense of musical identity. The Prettiest Curse is glossier than 2018’s I Don’t Run, higher-fidelity in places, and sprinkled with synthesizers. At its best, the album is able to build on Hinds’ previous approach. But it’s less consistent than their last two albums, and fans may not be able to shake the feeling that an extraordinarily efficient machine has been upgraded for a slicker model that doesn’t work all that much better. First single “Riding Solo” signals the band’s new ambitions with an arena-sized drum pound and a whistling synth. The chorus takes the band’s usual singalong and multiplies the backing vocals to give it the feeling of a live performance—or at least an ’80s-style hair-metal concert video. It’s hugely catchy and successful, and it sounds bigger than anything the band’s done before. The issues with the album spring not so much from what’s missing as from what’s present—the songs are just too busy. The band worked with the producer Jenn Decilveo (Albert Hammond Jr., Bat for Lashes’ Natasha Khan) and whether it was her decision or someone else’s, the mixes here are more cluttered than they need to be. On “Waiting for You,” which turns what might be a complaint about a flaky boyfriend into a call for solidarity, that amplifying effect on the backing vocals shows up again, and this time it disguises the chemistry between Cosials and co-frontwoman Ana Perrote, whose back-and-forth vocals are the best thing the band has going. Still, there’s plenty of worthwhile material here. “Boy” is as raucous, obstinate and fun as anything Hinds has released. It provides an ideal synthesis of the “rock” Hinds and the “pop” Hinds, and while your reaction depends on how you feel about shoutalong choruses and arena-friendly pop-punk, coming from this band it certainly sounds fresh. The Spanish lyrics are another welcome development, which show up for the first time in their music, starting with the thumping, neon opener “Good Bad Times.” There’s something encouraging about the presence of the band’s native language. Whereas the traditional “turn to pop” often feels forced, as if demanded by an out-of-touch record label exec, the Spanish here speaks to their growing comfort in trying new things. They may have slightly diluted their sound this time around, but at least they’re struggling on their own terms. The highlights suggest there is an arena-friendly Hinds out there, still waiting to emerge in full.","On their third album, the Spanish garage rockers swing for the fences with a big, arena-friendly new sound.

All Things Being Equal,Sonic Boom,by: Jesse Dorris,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5ede52b5d5f4a1d8ae15fdc5/1:1/w_160/All%20Things%20Being%20Equal_Sonic%20Boom.jpg,2020-06-09 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/sonic-boom-all-things-being-equal/,Carpark,"Pete Kember has been playing more or less the same song for almost 40 years. It’s built on blues swagger, but slowed down until it sways. It’s informed both lyrically and melodically by minimalism, insisting on simplicity. And though it throbs like techno, it’s directed at the head, not the feet or anywhere in between. It’s both solipsistic and psychedelic, urging listeners to travel into their own depths and welcome the joy and despair they might find there. All Things Being Equal is Kember’s first album as Sonic Boom since 1990’s Spectrum, a sort of solo record made with his bandmates in Spacemen 3 as that legendary psych combo broke up. He followed up Spectrum with a new band called Spectrum, before heading into the noise lab with Kevin Shields and others for Experimental Audio Research and branching out through collaborations with Stereolab, Delia Derbyshire, and Beach House. In each case, the personnel was less the focal point than the sound and the equipment making it: vintage ’60s and ’70s analog synthesizers, the odd guitar, and racks and racks of gizmos to oscillate and phase and flange. All Things has all of these—some 11 machines are listed in the liner notes, including two vocoders and a toy called Thumbs Up Music—and they perform Kember’s pop songs but also become them, as veins both determine a leaf’s survival and define its shape. “Just imagine you’re a tree,” he suggests in the dewy opener, which tells the apparently true story of a boy who believed he cured his own cancer by picturing himself as a storm, able to rain sickness out. “Just imagine that you’re a cloud/Just imagine, don’t say it out loud…just imagine the cloud wasn’t grey.” Hopefully, it’s not so much anti-science as simply pro-healing, however you can get it. In “Just a Little Piece of Me,” Kember transforms into a tree not in life but death. “Bury me beneath a tree/Let its root grow into me,” he sings in the shade of harmonies from longtime collaborator Panda Bear. “Let it grow and then you’ll see/Just a little piece of me.” Mortality is natural, but not always peaceful. In “Spinning Coins and Wishing on Clovers,” Kember ruminates on his imagined deathbed while noise thrashes around him and electronics twinkle like pangs of regret. “My Echo, My Shadow and Me” might be bleaker. “I am the ocean that you’ll never cross/I am the night where hope is not lost,” Kember intones, his voice bloodied yet disembodied: “I am the journey that you never planned/I am the wave that’ll never see land.” Mostly, though, Kember is seeing the land, and the beauty pushing through it. “Tawkin Techno” carries on Kraftwerk’s early Schubert-meets-the-Beach-Boys good vibes, but swaps out their industrial kitsch for an ode to the titular plant, better known as the Golden Club. “On a Summer’s Day,” he’s dumbstruck by the view from his window. “I just don’t know what to say,” he sighs, lost among keyboards, chirping and aglow. In the stroboscopic “I Can See Light Bend,” a freakout as hallucinatory as any in catalog defined by them, Kember’s senses overload and fail in a thicket of white noise and faux-Theremin. Or perhaps not fail but succeed. They merge: Seeing is believing. Halfway through its prickly ecstasy, he testifies: “Alter the light source/Build up my life force.”","On his first proper solo album in 30 years, the Spacemen 3 cofounder ruminates on mortality and transcendence over a glowing bed of analog synths.

Shades of Flu: Healthy Remixes For an Ill Moment,Kassa Overall,by: Dean Van Nguyen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5ede56e49bcc962f72cc0d26/1:1/w_160/SHADES%20OF%20FLU_Kassa%20Overall.jpg,2020-06-09 05:00:00,Jazz,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/kassa-overall-shades-of-flu-healthy-remixes-for-an-ill-moment/,self-released,"When Madlib was granted access to Blue Note’s sacred archives, history inspired the Beat Konducta to create a textbook of sample-led jazz rap destined to be studied by hip-hop producers forevermore. Seventeen years after Shades of Blue: Madlib Invades Blue Note, drummer and producer Kassa Overall seizes upon the same concept, but the circumstances that inspired the making of his “remixtape” are radically different. Shades of Flu: Healthy Remixes For an Ill Moment was assembled as Kassa observed coronavirus quarantine measures in Seattle. The final product is more gonzo in spirit than Madlib’s sanctified opus, but just like his hero, Kassa takes listeners by the hand and walks them through why hip-hop is, and has always been, a continuum of jazz. If you’re looking for other precursors, Shades of Flu has as much in common with Danger Mouse’s once heavily discussed mash-up record The Grey Album as it does with Madlib’s thesis: It’s similarly raw, underground, and chaotic. Kassa takes apart songs (mostly recorded by friends and collaborators), peers at the components inside, and finds bold new ways to put them back together. Sometimes he’ll fixate on one small snippet of the original—a piano plink, a vocal section—and loop it again and again, like a person hypnotized by a snow globe. His drums frequently drop out of the mix or veer off into wild freakouts. Madlib created smooth music you can easily picture coming out of both antique radios and modern turntables; Kassa’s experiments find a pocket somewhere in between. Consider his new remix of pianist Sullivan Fortner’s take on John Coltrane and Duke Ellington’s “In a Sentimental Mood.” Taken from his 2018 album Moments Preserved, Fortner’s cover retained the dimly lit film noir vibes of the Duke Ellington composition. Now, here comes Kassa, who flips the track into an electro-jazz mash-up with a thumping beat. Meanwhile, the new mix of Makaya McCraven’s “Tall Tales” sees each instrument fray into the next, amalgamating into a blurry collage that feels equally inspired by the Beatles’ proggy productions and Aphex Twin’s jittering electronica. That’s not to say Kassa can’t smooth things out when he’s in the mood. He adds a comfortingly familiar boom-bap beat to Jon Batiste’s very delicate cover of “What a Wonderful World,” while retaining Batiste’s doomed chord changes and dark mood. Cécile McLorin Salvant’s version of Steve Wonder’s “Visions” was prototypical lounge jazz—just the piano, the singer’s voice, and nothing else—but Kassa speeds her vocals up to form a lean slice of chipmunk soul that harks back to The College Dropout. The most fascinating cut might be the reimagining of Miles Davis’ “Freedom Jazz Dance.” Kassa mixes the peppy horn riff with the distinct drum loop and vocals from Busta Rhymes’ “Put Your Hands Where My Eyes Could See,” emerging with an alt-hip-hop number heavily reminiscent of his collaborations with A Tribe Called Quest. It feels like a lost Busta remix, summoned from an era when serving up alternate versions of rap singles was the norm. Of greatest personal consequence to Kassa must be his remix of Geri Allen’s “Unconditional Love.” The pianist and professor, a personal mentor, died in 2017, and Kassa handles her memory with great love by keeping the original’s swirling piano play and matching  it with a hip-hop-style drum break. It’s the closest Kassa gets to adhering to Madlib’s Shades of Blue. Because as it turns out, Shades of Flu isn’t really about Kassa emulating one of his influences, but laying out a pamphlet of his own daring ideas. By illuminating old cuts in new light, Kassa asserts his position as one of modern jazz music’s most audacious futurists.","With a daring assortment of reverential and playful remixes, the drummer and producer carves a niche for himself in the world of contemporary jazz.

Sideways to New Italy,Rolling Blackouts Coastal Fever,by: Alfred Soto,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5eda73bedad4216f71c6777c/1:1/w_160/Sideways%20To%20New%20Italy_Rolling%20Blackouts%20Coastal%20Fever.jpg,2020-06-08 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/rolling-blackouts-coastal-fever-sideways-to-new-italy/,Sub Pop,"Rolling Blackout Coastal Fever is a combo whose three-guitar attack is hot—steadily but not dangerously so—super-intense, and super-catchy. After a pair of 2017 EPs and their 2018 debut Hope Downs, the Australian quintet has steadily lost interest in tracks with characters and situations: the bric-a-brac of sharp lyric writing that goes down well with the band’s relentless forward, backward, and sideways motion. Sideways to New Italy does little to change this suspicion. These 10 tracks refine RBCF’s formidable strafing abilities. They roll. They’re feverish. They also coast. Devoted not to narrative so much as six-string calisthenics, RBCF are a treat when they play from within one of the aural dust clouds they’ve stirred. On “Cameo,” Fran Keaney lays out a romantic scenario of uncommon banality (“Your voice had an old melody/Like sweet river water,” egads) whose drama gets goosed by Tom Russo and Joe White’s cross-talking electric licks. Or at the three-minute mark in “Cars in Space” when Keaney, Russo, and White pick away at discrete parts: ripple effects that rattle its foundations for the sake of testing them. And on “Sunglasses at the Wedding,” Keaney moves his fingers as if each acoustic strum births a new color trail. RBCF get in trouble, however, when they want us to pay attention to words and such. This is more of a problem on the material sung by White, responsible for the this-is-pop moments that require a slight deceleration. White settles for phonetic placeholders on “She’s There” and lets the tug of Joe Russo’s excellent bass work and an impressive series of sparkling licks  carry him through “The Only One.” If the Acme facelessness of those titles gives you pause, consider: Hope Downs alone sported “An Air-Conditioned Man” and “Cappuccino City”; 2017’s “The French Press” isn’t even about the best way to prepare coffee—it’s one of the sharpest songs about sibling tensions in recent memory. But here’s the thing: RBCF are the guys you would’ve called to write that song. If great bands create the terms under which listeners will accept them—in effect teach listeners how to listen to them—then good bands fold their hands on their desks as listeners review their antecedents. With the Velvet Underground’s “What Goes On” as ur-text, RBCF careen into the Feelies’ chordal cul-de-sacs, emulate the scrappiness of the Clean, and even soak in the bubbly freshness of forgotten early-’90s college radio favorites like the Ocean Blue. Until Sideways to New Italy, their marvelous racket distracted from their derivativeness; now, only this good band’s racket will do.","The Melbourne quintet’s second album strolls through familiar territory with good guitar work and good songwriting that never quite peaks where it used to.

Goons Be Gone,No Age,by: Stuart Berman,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5eda7836fd5cd0dd69406663/1:1/w_160/Goons%20Be%20Gone_No%20Age.jpg,2020-06-08 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/no-age-goons-be-gone/,Drag CityDrag City,"No Age is less a rock band than a lenticular 3-D image of one—your perception of them is liable to shift depending on your vantage point. From one angle, singer-drummer Dean Allen Spunt and guitarist Randy Randall are a punk duo capable of making the noise of a band five times their size; from another, they’re meticulous sound designers, applying just as much attention to subliminal details as the actual songs blaring over them. But on their last couple of records, the perspective shifts have been whiplash-inducing: where 2013’s An Object stripped out their engine to play around with the scrap parts, 2018’s Snares Like a Haircut found them fully reinvigorated and ready to rejoin the circle pit. With Goons Be Gone, they opt to let the pendulum gently sway between these two poles. Now 15 years into their career, No Age have reached the point where they could easily settle into a dad-punk comfort zone, a fate suggested by the opening “Sandalwood,” which sounds like Thurston Moore covering the Velvets covering “Gloria.” Their lifelong Hüsker Dü worship continues, but “Feeler” pivots away from their buddy Bob Mould’s gale-force aggression to embrace the more melodic graces of the Grant Hart songbook. Overall, they’re still too restless to settle into familiar archetypes—when, on the latter song, Spunt kindly invites us to “board onto the rhythm of my astroplane, and find out where I’ve been,” the duo make good on that cosmic promise by unleashing an ominous textural whoosh where most bands would just drop the guitar solo. In moments like these, Goons Be Gone feels like two wildly different albums dubbed atop each another, where late-’80s-style indie-rock songs are perpetually fending off strange ambient undercurrents that threaten to consume them. The album’s highlights revel in that dichotomy: the frantic “War Dance” tries to outrun its own ray-gun squiggles as if dodging battlefield bullets, while the brisk “Turned to String”—which exhibits the sort of post-hardcore Tom Pettyisms that The Men mastered circa New Moon—feels liable to launch itself from the heartland and into space at any moment. And those two tracks are linked by the rapturous “Toes in the Water,” a tremolo-soaked lo-fi instrumental that gradually builds into a cyclone of distortion, like a Glenn Branca noise symphony trapped in a suburban garage. Spunt’s lyrics tend to deal in cryptic directives and enigmatic romanticism—on the twangy dream-pop of “Smoothie,” he addresses the subject of his affection as “my tambourine.” But when you consider Goons Be Gone’s title, alongside lines like “I’m astonished by your ignorance today,” a subterranean theme emerges: Spunt and Randall are two family men trying to ward off the bad vibes as their country descends into chaos. But that tension dissipates when No Age let their experimental impulses completely take over: “Working Stiff Takes a Break” strands a Minutemen-style rant inside a shapeless pawn-shop synth doodle, while the sputtering “A Sigh Clicks” sounds like the duo found a cool, siren-like sound effect to base a song around, but failed to come up with one. But maybe these are the sort of whiteboard exercises that are necessary to arrive at a charming oddity like “Head Sport Full Face,” whose locomotive riff and melodic guitar hook could almost pass for Room on Fire-era Strokes, but whose detuned-radio frequencies and convulsive rhythm honor No Age’s art-damaged pedigree. Their sound may be familiar by now, and their days as the poster children of L.A. DIY are more than a decade in the rearview. But at their most fearless, No Age can still make discord feel sound utopian.","Fifteen years into their career, the duo are still finding ways to make discord feel utopian.

Fantasize Your Ghost,Ohmme,by: Andy Cush,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5eda7b95d5f4a1d8ae15fd45/1:1/w_160/Fantasize%20Your%20Ghost_Ohmme.jpg,2020-06-08 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/ohmme-fantasize-your-ghost/,Joyful Noise,"“I want to tell you quietly, but I’m afraid you won’t hear it,” sing the members of Chicago duo Ohmme in the first verse of “Spell It Out,” braiding their voices tightly together, as they almost always do. The song’s narrator is trying to get through to a thickheaded partner who won’t shoulder their fair share of domestic labor, and the hints she’s dropping aren’t working. Singer-guitarists Macie Stewart and Sima Cunningham make the tension audible in cyclical guitar figures, and a pensive string section hovers over the proceedings like a summer rain cloud that may or may not burst. When it opens up, the downpour is gentle. The strings become sweeping and romantic, and the narrator finally spells it out: “What ever happened to you wanting to be there?” The dishes are only the beginning of the problem, it’s clear. Fantasize Your Ghost, Ohmme’s second album, tells you things quietly. Like the obtuse partner of “Spell It Out,” you’d do well to listen closely. Cunningham and Stewart formed Ohmme in 2014, emerging from Chicago’s fertile scene for left-field improvised music. (Cunningham works for the company that produces Pitchfork Festival.) Though their roots are in the avant-garde, they have connections in many of Chicago’s less foreboding musical corners: they’ve lent backing vocals to Chance the Rapper and string arrangements to Whitney, played in bands with Jeff Tweedy and Vic Mensa. Their 2017 self-titled EP, and 2018 debut album Parts, established them as a virtuosic and wildly inventive indie rock band, pursuing their experimental inclinations across bright and punchy songs, with noise freakouts and placid vocal harmonies sharing equal space. The two songwriters operated as if one, sharing nearly every lyric and lending steady accompaniment to each other’s improvisatory guitar excursions. Even at its most exuberant, Parts felt sealed off from the outside world, mirroring the tight quarters of its cover photo. Fantasize Your Ghost is more spacious, and the duo experiments with how many cock-eyed experimental impulses can fit inside a conventional pop song. “The Limit” picks up the thread Dirty Projectors left hanging after Bitte Orca and Swing Lo Magellan, fooling you into believing that melodies of dizzying baroque complexity are actually sugary singalong hooks. The lurching riff and brain-melting feedback of “Selling Candy” come across as celebratory rather than confrontational, thanks to the light touch of drummer Matt Carroll and the sly humor of Cunningham and Stewart’s lyrics, which reminisce on childhoods spent wandering a city filled with hot dog vendors and streets imagined as hot lava. For all the liberating chaos of their guitar playing, Ohmme have always had an affinity for quiet and an improvisers’ commitment to listening and responding to each other. (Few bands whose genre tags might include the word “noise” could pull off a Tiny Desk Concert; Ohmme’s is a marvel.) The back half of Fantasize Your Ghost gives extended space to the band’s meditative side. “3 2 4 3” is restrained and hypnotic, with Carroll channelling Jaki Liebezeit’s trance-funk groove and Cunningham and Stewart repeating an elliptical mantra: “Different today, but I’m the same.” Ohmme are a powerhouse live band, and it’s easy to imagine “3 2 4 3” evolving into a sprawling Can-style jam with multiple fiery peaks whenever they’re able to take this material on the road. For now, the climax is more subdued: a stab of strings and a wordless vocal harmony, stretching forever as the band glides on. Fantasize Your Ghost ends with a juxtaposition. First, “Sturgeon Moon,” the group’s most dissonant piece of music by far, a scorched and metallic landscape that sounds like it was improvised from scratch, recalling early Sonic Youth at their most apocalyptic. Then “After All,” a magnificent pop song with the easy melodic elegance of a Brill Building gem, whose lyrics acknowledge the surprising about-face with a wink: “After all the commotion/After all, I need to plant my rose.” Cunningham and Stewart’s vocal blend is at its richest and sweetest, a single glowing sound that never loses their individual variances of inflection and pitch. They are like instruments in a string quartet, an effect heightened by the appearance of an actual string quartet, swooping in to take over for them in the third verse. Stewart and Cunningham seem capable of almost anything, a surplus of ability extending in so many directions that the music might feel scattershot if not for this grounding factor. No matter the surroundings, it always comes back to those two voices, singing together.","The Chicago duo experiments with how many wayward impulses fit inside conventional pop structures on their expansive and thrilling second album.

The Bowie Years,Iggy Pop,by: Sasha Geffen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5eda6b81fd5cd0dd6940662b/1:1/w_160/The%20Idiot_Iggy%20Pop_resized.jpg,2020-06-06 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/iggy-pop-the-bowie-years/,UME,"In the mid-1960s, after years of listening to the British Invasion, a teenage Iggy Pop got sick of rock’n’roll. He had unearthed the blues originators of popular bands like the Beatles and the Kinks, and started listening to Muddy Waters, Chuck Berry, and John Lee Hooker instead. In these groundbreaking artists he heard a vitality and backbone that hadn’t translated to their diluted white mimics. At age 19, in 1966, Pop—then known as Jim Osterberg, Jr.—left his native Michigan for Chicago and arrived at the West Side doorstep of blues drummer Sam Lay, hoping to be taken under his wing. Lay let Pop shadow him, and eventually Pop started sitting in on gigs. He slept on Lay’s floor and absorbed the music around him. “I realized that these guys were way over my head, and that what they were doing was so natural to them that it was ridiculous for me to make a studious copy of it,” he said decades later in an interview for Please Kill Me: The Uncensored Oral History of Punk. “I thought, What you gotta do is play your own simple blues. I could describe my experience based on the way those guys are describing theirs...So that’s what I did.” He called his high school friend Ron Asheton to come take him back to Detroit, and with Ron’s brother Scott Asheton and their friend Dave Alexander, they rounded up the Stooges. Across three studio albums, the Stooges channeled their violent white ennui into an abject, unraveled rendition of the blues Pop had studied so fervently. Where British Invasion bands moved in friendly lockstep, the Stooges played with an almost confrontational looseness, as if at any moment they could quit their instruments and go at each other’s throats. As the band’s frontman, Pop earned a reputation for his outrageous stage presence. Offstage, Jim Osterberg was small and shy. In performance, as Iggy Pop, he swallowed up the room with his physical contortions, his drag getups, and his deranged, wounded howl. The band’s inflammatory shows caught the attention of musicians like David Bowie, Suicide’s Alan Vega, and the future Ramones, who latched onto the wildness and self-degradation of Pop’s act. By 1974, five years after releasing their debut LP, the Stooges had imploded. They played a final show at Detroit’s Michigan Palace, where Pop viciously taunted his audience and his audience threw beer bottles onstage. Deep into several varieties of hard drugs, Pop spent the next two years adrift in Los Angeles, getting arrested for everything from unpaid parking tickets to wearing full drag in public at a time when “female impersonation” was still a bookable offense. The LAPD got sick of him, and pressured him into a stay at the city’s Neuropsychiatric Institute, where he worked to kick his addictions. He reconciled with Bowie, who had disavowed their friendship amid the mess of latter-day Stooges, and the two agreed to collaborate. Pop tagged along on Bowie’s Station to Station tour in 1976, and then the two relocated to Berlin, where they’d produce some of the most singular work of their respective careers. During this fertile period, Bowie recorded the legendary streak of albums Low, “Heroes,” and Lodger. Pop, with Bowie serving as co-writer and co-producer, issued The Idiot and Lust for Life, both now compiled on the 7-disc boxed set Iggy Pop: The Bowie Years. The Idiot, Pop’s solo debut, decisively shut the gates on his time with the Stooges. Where once he was infernal and freewheeling, he now became cool and restrained by Bowie’s careful, calculated producer’s hand. He still sang in a tone of abjection, still retained his sense of being a debased and decrepit subject, but where he once showed a grimace he now wore a smirk. His Cold War surroundings provoked icy, glib reflections; taking cues from Kraftwerk over in Düsseldorf, Bowie and Pop adopted cool detachment as a primary artistic mode. Predictably, The Idiot enraged those who championed the Stooges for their unhindered squalls; the legendary music critic Lester Bangs called it “phony bullshit.” And it’s easy to see how a voice beloved for its fire would turn fans cold after dimming its spark. But by reining in Pop, Bowie and his effete European sensibilities drew out a new range of nuance in the singer. The Idiot may lack fury, but it compensates with sardonic humor and perfectly tuned melodrama—both tools that would become wildly popular across all artistic media in the 1980s. Against clipped percussion, whining guitars, and thin synthesizer tones, Pop’s voice turns barbed and sour on The Idiot. The closest he comes to unfiltered emotion is “Dum Dum Boys,” an elegy of sorts for the Stooges, and even there his keening is ringed with a sneer. Mostly, he sounds distant; the sleazy, hilarious “Nightclubbing” is less an ode to Berlin’s vibrant nightlife than it is a monument to alienation—the numbness of being among people in their moments of joy and sharing none of it. Pop’s circular lyrics reveal the song’s emptiness: “We see people/Brand new people/They’re something to see.” Also released in 1977, The Idiot’s follow-up Lust for Life breathes some punk grit back into Pop’s performance. Its title track, driven by Hunt Sales’ animated and playful live drumming, could be a marginally tidied-up Stooges song; rather than sounding dwarfed by the instrumentation surrounding it, Pop’s voice resumes its fevered snarl at the front of the mix. He sounds alert, embodied, no longer a Bowie-animated cadaver but an enlivening force in his own right. Pop’s performance shocks itself awake on Lust for Life, but the album’s most enduring track clings to alienation as its principal subject. “The Passenger” makes a saga of passivity. Written alternately in the first and third person, it watches a man riding a car, or a train, or a bus, seeing a city slip past his window, feeling the seal around himself. He is not of the city, just in it, gliding through. The city has “ripped backsides,” a vaguely homoerotic anthropomorphization; the passenger, who both is and isn’t Pop, stays “under glass,” sees “the bright and hollow sky,” as if for all he devours with his hungry eyes there were nothing of substance inside it. Four guitar chords, briskly strummed and punctuated by rests, roll onward, never budging from a single progression. There’s no chorus, save for a wordless repeat of the verse melody with Bowie chiming in on backing vocals. Pop moves but someone else is driving. “All of it was made for you and me,” he asserts towards the end, as his voice breaks composure, and threatens to “take a ride and see what’s mine.” So he arrives at a paradox: He’s an inert body rolling through space, and also the rightful owner of all he sees. He does nothing but owns everything, the whole empty world and all the nothing inside of it. More than his chirpier singles from the era—the boisterous “Lust for Life,” the Orientalist fantasy “China Girl” (written about an unrequited affection for a Vietnamese woman, and later done better by Bowie alone)—“The Passenger” intoxicates with its refusal to yield what is hidden. It is an emblematic high point of Pop’s career, an example of how his quiet perception held as much power as his wildness. With the Stooges, Pop screamed across the space that separated him from other people, desperate to hear something in return besides his echo. With the albums he made with Bowie, he scrutinized the space itself. In addition to remasters of The Idiot and Lust for Life, Pop’s new boxed set loops in the decent if not great TV Eye Live (a live album originally released in 1978 to free Pop from his RCA contract), a disc of alternate mixes and edits, and three live discs all recorded in 1977, featuring Bowie on keys and with very similar tracklists—a show of excess for anyone but the most ardent completionist fascinated by the variations in delivery and ad-libbing from different performances on the same tour. These live offerings, whose recording quality varies, show Pop and his band playfully mussing up The Idiot’s slick tracks, but do little to lend them dimension. Mostly, they vivisect the musician at a moment of transition, performing both Stooges and solo tracks, leaving the sound of his band behind and coming into his own as a lone icon. Working with Pop allowed Bowie to get darker in his songwriting and production than he dared in his solo work; working with Bowie allowed Pop to focus his flailing instincts into refined, careful songcraft. For two albums, they served as each other’s perfect foils, and their work together would inflect music made on both sides of the Atlantic, from Joy Division and Depeche Mode to Grace Jones and Nine Inch Nails. Their stoic cynicism presaged the austerity measures of the ’80s and their continuing ramifications; amid the dregs of capitalism, these lonely melodies and their battered delivery keep resonating. “Can you hear me at all?” Pop asks on The Idiot’s “Sister Midnight.” The answer is “no,” and he keeps singing.","A new boxed set documents Iggy Pop’s formative years working alongside David Bowie in Berlin, the moment Pop left the sound of the Stooges behind and came into his own as a lone icon.

Wicked City,Jockstrap,by: Philip Sherburne,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5eda6ed5d5f4a1d8ae15fd0d/1:1/w_160/Wicked%20City_Jockstrap.jpg,2020-06-06 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/jockstrap-wicked-city/,Warp,"A first encounter with the UK duo Jockstrap can seem like a dispatch from a renegade shuffle play. Here’s singer-songwriter Georgia Ellery lilting sweetly over Casiotone bossa nova; here’s producer Taylor Skye mimicking a scratched-up copy of Now That’s What I Call EDM; here are the two of them laying down vintage orchestral pop courtesy of their classmates at Guildhall, a London conservatory. There’s more than a whiff of art-school hijinks to the project—particularly when you factor in that name, a predictable talking point in the duo’s interviews. (“I like that kind of gross shock factor,” says Ellery, who often sings in a cherubic coo.) But Jockstrap don’t come off like they’re trying to prove that they’re clever. Beneath the head-spinning vocal processing and surrealist wordplay, Ellery’s songwriting is a well of deep feeling, even when the precise meaning is walled off by layers of abstraction. This is particularly true on Wicked City, their second EP, on which her voice and lyrics soar confidently forward, no matter how jagged the path that Skye blazes. In their short time together, Jockstrap have fashioned a singular sound from an unusual fusion of influences. The two met in composition class and began trading demos, finding inspiration in the overlap between Ellery’s imagistic character studies, Skye’s dubstep roots, and their shared classical training: not so much a Venn diagram as a wadded-up Moebius strip. On their debut EP, 2018’s Love Is the Key to the City, they toyed with easy-listening strings and space-age bachelor-pad vibes, setting Ellery’s carefully rendered tales of sexual awakening to wheezy electronic lounge jazz reminiscent of James Blake’s first EPs. With “Robert,” Wicked City’s opening song, they announce a marked shift. The strings and the dulcet harmonies are gone; in their place, a lumbering hip-hop beat, part Skrillex and part SOPHIE, that’s full of stop-start changes and sudden silences. Ellery’s cryptic spoken-word bits are digitally stretched and garbled, and the Arizona rapper Stepa J. Groggs, of Injury Reserve, drops 32 bars of pure non sequitur. Even Ellery’s verses are more about sound than sense: What begins as an address to an artist acquaintance (“You’re provoking me Robert/I want to be your playmate/I want my own portrait”) devolves into pitch-shifted gibberish with choice bits (“I want to/Be the bitch, be the masochist”) jutting like rusty iron bars from a scrap heap. “Robert” sounds virtually nothing like Jockstrap’s debut EP, but with the next song, “Acid,” they’re back to their nostalgic silver-screen fantasies—strings fluttering, Ellery’s voice softer than a mink stole. The song shifts into a melancholy waltz; the lyrics, addressed to Ellery’s brother, are as ominous as they are enigmatic, leading from images of smashed vases, acid, and blood to a couplet of chilling clarity: “What if you kill me off/Or worse, yourself?” These juxtapositions are an essential part of Jockstrap’s aesthetic, and the duo spends the rest of the EP zigging and zagging, playing up every jarring contrast. The record’s loveliest cut, “Yellow in Green,” distills the carnal sweetness of young love into lyrical piano glissandi redolent of Debussy, all salty skin and lavender breeze. The two-part “The City” begins with just voice and piano and sheds its skin to become a gnarly, distorted hip-hop beat; the first half is a stirringly vivid love letter to the city, a rush of sensations written with all the innocence of Ellery’s coastal upbringing, while the second half is an incomprehensible tale about a bear, a beaver, and a “hideous monster,” spun out like lysergic taffy. It’s beautiful, and also bewildering. The closing “City Hell” goes for a similar kind of discombulation, but to lesser effect, building from a winsome ballad for ersatz harp into a pyrotechnic display of trap beats and guitar solo that’s about as subtle as DJ Mustard remixing Queen. There are precedents for this in the plasti-pop tomfoolery of PC Music and the stone-faced humor of Dean Blunt; in Jockstrap’s more wistful moments, you can also hear echoes of Julia Holter’s time-traveling chamber pop, a throwback to a world before color TV. But unlike the throw-everything-at-the-wall approach of 100 gecs, a group similarly interested in clashing textures and referential supercollisions, Jockstrap have a more sparing and inviting musical sensibility. It doesn’t always work; the severity of their switchbacks can make for an exhausting listen, and they don’t always know when to rein in the excess. There’s actually a false ending in “City Hell”: a trick fade-out, a moment of silence, and then a reprise of those pinwheeling guitars and buzzing synths, as though the first four minutes of major-key bombast hadn’t been enough. Jockstrap are young—Ellery and Skye are in their fourth year of music school—and they are still finding their way. But when they nail it, as on “The City,” their first-thought-best-thought creative bursts sound not just thrilling but genuinely new. For a group so steeped in retro modes, that’s no small thing.","Georgia Ellery and Taylor Skye’s head-spinning vocal processing and unusual fusion of influences form a well of deep feeling, even when the meaning is obscured.

RTJ4,Run the Jewels,by: Sheldon Pearce,Contributing Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5ed815b29bcc962f72cc0bc5/1:1/w_160/RTJ4_Run%20the%20Jewels.jpg,2020-06-05 05:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/run-the-jewels-rtj4/,Jewel RunnersBMG,"RTJ4 begins at war with the police. The titular duo—Killer Mike and El-P—work to evade a swarming force of militant cops. They draw the mob in. They shoot back. They escape. It is a fantasy. The reality comes later. “You so numb you watch the cops choke out a man like me/Until my voice goes from a shriek to whisper—‘I can’t breathe’/And you sit there in the house on couch and watch it on TV,” Killer Mike raps on “walking in the snow,” his voice urgent. The lyric is about Eric Garner. Now it’s about George Floyd, too. That these two unjust killings occurred under tragically, uncannily similar circumstances (out in the open; with other officers standing by; with a man being suffocated to death; on camera) nearly six years apart only underscores the unending flow of racist violence in America. The state of heightened rage such violence induces is untenable and corrosive. Yet love needs fury to fight hate. Clearly none of this is lost on the pair of indie, old head, no-fucks-giving, chain-snatching, self-professed menaces to sobriety behind this project. Their boisterous new album, RTJ4, makes time for trash-talking and chin-checking amid insurrection. RTJ are still taking it to the streets to fight a tyrannical ruling class and racist policing. But after the taxing process of making Run the Jewels 3, a vitriolic album in a race against doomsday, they’ve leveled off to a manageable degree of righteous indignation. To maintain equilibrium, the punchlines are less juvenile, too, and there’s a noticeable decrease in dick jokes. Fortified with lessons learned from their “blue” album, the duo conjures up the album closest to who they are as rappers and fans, activists and husbands, goofballs and go-getters: weary but unbroken, wary but not hopeless, eager to knuckle up. By now, at the fourth installment of this series greenlit by an Adult Swim programmer, it’d be easy for them to just punch in and deliver their mandated hour of outsized, kick-in-your-teeth braggadocio—obviously, there’s still plenty of that: “Until you rob a hypebeast you ain’t seen sadness/Clockwork Orange madness, left the scene laughing,” Mike raps on “holy calamafuck”. But on RTJ4, the pair has settled into a nice rhythm—Mike, standing his ground, gun in tow, atop a soapbox; El, the truther following every red string across a tack board. RTJ4 re-engineers their music to its most critical components, as if extracting its essence. They scrap any dead weight to maneuver more freely, finding the balance between mischief-makers and agitators. RTJ3, released under the looming shadow of Trumpism, featured a quote from the 1968 Martin Luther King, Jr. speech “The Other America”: “A riot is the language of the unheard.” What remained unsaid was what, exactly, the “other” America had failed to hear: that “large segments of white society are more concerned about tranquility and the status quo than about justice and humanity.” The pursuit of justice is active here, and it’s loud as shit and shaking the table. These guys don’t do tranquility. They don’t even do subtlety. Ain’t shit fly but the drones. (One El-P assessment: “This whole world’s a shit moat filled to the brim like GitMo.”) But they are noticeably more measured, both in trying to portion out their fury more carefully and choosing their words more precisely. “Used to be a time I’d see it and I’d say it/Now I understand that woke folk be playin’,” Mike raps on “goonies vs. E.T.” That forethought brings concision that plays into their personas as pithy, shit-talking government watchdogs. While his real-world politics aren’t as anarchic as his songs, sound bites, and even shirts suggest, and his black capitalist position does defang his “eat the rich” sloganeering some, Mike is still capable of reeling off devastating combinations in that rubbery voice of his. He forgoes some of his quotability this time to better serve the flexibility of his rapping. He establishes his priorities on “a few words for the firing squad (radiation),” through his wife: “Friends tell her, ‘He could be another Malcolm, he could be another Martin’/She told ‘em, ‘Partner, I need a husband more than the world need another martyr.” For him, now, staying active in his community is paramount, and he raps like someone lit a fire under him. His closing verse on “goonies vs. E.T.” is one of his best, at once dauntless and precise, like watching someone skip across a minefield and survive. El-P, for his part, has rarely sounded so animated. He is in a near-constant state of agitation, appearing through plumes of weed smoke to kick up dust, like some whistleblowing anti-hero in a dystopian YA novel. “You see a future where Run the Jewels ain’t the shit/Cancel my Hitler-killing trip/Turn the time machine back around a century,” he raps on “the ground below.” It’s that kind of highly self-referential, bluntly political, fun-loving pulp fiction mash-up bar that keeps the project so viable. There are fewer back-and-forth exchanges than on previous albums and the verses don’t dovetail as much but the two still move well in tandem. They cover each other, their writing well-sequenced, their rapping finely staged. There’s a section on “never look back” where Mike punctuates every one of El-P’s thoughts. Mike’s bluster can cover El’s evasiveness, and El’s tendency to hang back and observe bolsters Mike’s aggression. In one exchange, El strings out a sentence like a line of train cars, “You covet disruption, I got you covered, I’m bustin’/My brother’s a runner, he’s crushin’, it’s no discussion,” crafty in and around the corners, to which Mike adds, frankly: “People, we the pirates, the pride of this great republic/No matter what you order, muhfucka, we’re what you’re stuck with.” The banter holds RTJ’s music together at the seams. Even when serious, it never runs the risk of becoming dour or unbearable, because they feel like they’ll always get the last laugh. This commitment to wordplay as wisecracks birthed the characters Yankee and the Brave, an imagined buddy comedy action thriller (that may or may not actually come to fruition on the screen), and manifests on the bobbing, 2 Chainz-aided “out of sight,” the slap-happy “holy calamafuck,” and in moments when Mike compares himself to Godzilla or El has “a Vonnegut punch for your Atlas shrugs.” For two rappers in their 40s, they sound so liberated and timeless, all without a chip on their shoulder about the younger class. This ability to stay true to who they are feels as radical as anything else they do. “Two dudes who were born in 1975 are not supposed to be allowed to be at the cutting edge of music,” El-P told GQ, after establishing the M.O. of this dynamic duo: “We’re using our powers for good.” They have always been historians—2014’s RTJ2 was a classicist fever dream—but RTJ4 exists in tribute to the old school. Those intentions are clear: DJ Premier and Greg Nice guested on a single. There’s scratching across the record from Trackstar the DJ and Cutmaster Swiff. “Run the Jewels has always been an homage to a degree, to a feeling that we had, to the classic groups that we came up with,” El-P explained earlier this year. “Not trying to recreate them, but to just live in that feeling when we’re making music.” He likened this run that they’re on to raucous New York duo EPMD’s, and the comparison seems apt. Some of the songs embody vintage hardcore funk rap. Others sound like sci-fi boom-bap. “out of sight” is like an ever-mutating version of the D.O.C.’s “It’s Funky Enough.” Afforded greater financial freedom by the group’s success, El-P’s songs are layered with stunning and meticulous sample work, but the beats are no less forceful. These are hard-hitting throwbacks with an ear to the ground. RTJ4 centers protest music less explicitly than RTJ3 did, but the moments when the album is most pronouncedly in active revolt are still when it feels most essential. The in-your-face commentary of “walking in the snow” and “pulling the pin,” with Mavis Staples seemingly transmitting from another era, bring the most out of the two rhymers. All of the surveying seems to come to a head on closer “a few words for the firing squad (radiation),” where both Mike and El rattle off personal reflections from inside a dying empire. In their verses, it’s the love for those closest to them and the losses they’ve sustained under the current order that fuels their fury. The song builds, the rage builds, and as it draws to a close, Mike makes clear who all this is for: the do-gooders that the no-gooders abused; the truth-tellers tied to the whipping post; the strange fruit left hanging from trees—the Eric Garners; the George Floyds.

My Favorite Mistakes,Esther Rose,by: Nina Corcoran,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5ed7c1c5516c27a90b85e4dd/1:1/w_160/My%20Favorite%20Mistakes_Esther%20Rose.jpg,2020-06-05 05:00:00,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/esther-rose-my-favorite-mistakes/,Father/Daughter,"During a month-long tour opening for Nick Lowe, country singer Esther Rose spent each night enraptured by his ambling 2019 deep cut “Blue on Blue.” Her breakout album from last year, You Made It This Far, originated from feelings of lovesickness and loneliness similar to those in his song, and realizing such inspired her to reimagine the track. Soon after, Rose recorded My Favorite Mistakes, a four-track EP featuring covers of Lowe, Sheryl Crow, Hank Williams, and Roy Orbison. Through these covers, Rose refines her identity, turning the comfort of other artists’ dark admissions into a map where she can find her own space. On her previous two albums, Rose turned heads with her poignant specificities and nonchalant candor. The songs on My Favorite Mistakes fit naturally in her repertoire, perhaps because these downer anthems were already embedded in Rose the way our favorite songs eventually merge with our DNA. There’s a hint of a smirk to her wispy drawl in “Blue on Blue,” implying that this is a tale of heartbreak as old as time. That’s the thing about dark love songs: “You can sing your guts out and be as creepy and sad as you want,” Rose told Talkhouse, “and then after three minutes, you’re done and you’re OK.” The EP opens with a deceivingly sunny ray of lap steel and fiddle on “My Favorite Mistake.” While contemporary indie rock artists are turning Sheryl Crow into a belated pop totem, Rose is reaffirming her status as a country luminary. By removing the blues-rock production of the original version and digging up its folk roots instead, she shifts the focus from a cheating partner to the larger question of how to maintain self-worth after treachery. For someone who grew up in punk rock, Rose is at her most powerful when mimicking country greats. On “I Can’t Help It (If I’m Still in Love With You),” she captures the spirit of Williams in a faithful duet with Lee Walker. She launches into Orbison’s “Blue Bayou” armed with nothing but an acoustic guitar, the barren nature of which makes each whisper-sung octave hit hard. Rose wasn’t exaggerating when she called herself a “reckless optimist.” That’s the unique appeal of My Favorite Mistakes: these are songs for a sore heart, and Rose leans into the sting, but only so her croons can act like a warm compress to soothe the pain.","On this covers EP, the country singer digs into the roots in some of her favorite dark love songs, from Sheryl Crow to Nick Lowe to Hank Williams.

In Fabric OST,Cavern of Anti-Matter,by: Ben Cardew,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5ed90fd0fd5cd0dd694064ad/1:1/w_160/In%20Fabric.jpg,2020-06-05 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/cavern-of-anti-matter-in-fabric-ost/,Duophonic UHF Disks,"If you consider it negligent that Stereolab have yet to apply their otherworldly ambience to a film soundtrack, then In Fabric should go some way towards salving the wound. Active since 2013, Cavern of Anti-Matter are the trio of Stereolab’s Tim Gane, original Stereolab drummer Joe Dilworth, and synth player Holger Zapf; In Fabric, their first album in two years, is the soundtrack to British director Peter Strickland’s 2018 horror comedy, and it draws deep on their sizeable reserves of drones, charm, and finesse. Alongside singer Laetitia Sadier, Gane was Stereolab’s songwriting engine, and here, his eye for guileful chord changes is evident on songs like “Winter Rhombic” or “Mannequin Metric,” whose ornate, slightly unpredictable melodic patterns suggest the creepy elegance of a Victorian music box. He also has a real knack for sonic texture, using just the right elements—echoing harpsichord (“Inside Luckmoore”), scratchy drum machine (“Elektro-Agitator 2”), or bachelor-pad organ (“The Retail Idea”)—to pin down an unusual mood, be it nervous classicism, strained funk, or dreamy capitalist fantasy. The big difference between this and Cavern of Anti-Matter’s previous work is that on In Fabric the band dials down the rapid tonal shifts and rhythmic urgency of 2018’s Hormone Lemonade in favor of teasing out one idea over the course of a song. Many tracks weigh in around the two-minute mark, making them more like melodic miniatures for keyboard and guitar than full-blown songs, while even the longer numbers tend to feature only a handful of ingredients. “Queue Nightfall” is particularly minimal: A droning synth runs the length of the song spreading nameless dread, with other electronic elements periodically dropping in to further test the frazzled nerves. As an accompaniment to the film’s Lynchian legend of a haunted red dress, the soundtrack’s kitsch and occasionally playful textures work well, delivering the kind of gentlemanly chills that stand apart from the overt gore and guts of much modern horror. As a stand-alone listen, though, In Fabric can be testing: The 35-song soundtrack runs to nearly two hours, and the very elements that make it work as a score—the repeating melodic motifs and moments of lingering disquiet—make it a difficult listening experience. Much like the film’s demonic dress, it feels at times like In Fabric owns you, more than you own it. Still, scattered throughout are numerous examples of the melodic dexterity, genre agnosticism, and rhythmic poise that made records like Hormone Lemonade and Emperor Tomato Ketchup such shape-shifting delights. “The Dress Perspective” has a melody of such Gallic finesse that it begs for Sadier to break out her trademark bah-bah-ing melodies over its gorgeous chord sequence, while “ZinZan’s Avec Moi” has the life-affirming, slightly wonky rush of the best Stereolab disco moments. “Speaks Machine” is even better, a techno-influenced aural illusion that seems to be permanently pushing its melody up to an unscalable peak, like a Sisyphean synth jam. With Stereolab reforming in 2019 for live dates, the dream of the groop soundtracking an Italian horror, French New Wave, or Eastern European art-house flick remains at least nominally alive. In Fabric won’t quite banish those grand cinematic visions. But it certainly scratches the band’s optical itch.","Spanning 35 tracks in nearly two hours, the Stereolab spinoff’s first foray into film soundtracks balances playful electronic mood pieces with drones and nameless dread.

Welcome to Bobby’s Motel,Pottery,by: Linnie Greene,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5ed954c5d5f4a1d8ae15fc64/1:1/w_160/Welcome%20to%20Bobby%E2%80%99s%20Motel.jpg,2020-06-05 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/pottery-welcome-to-bobbys-motel/,Partisan,"What does “new wave” even mean, really, besides too weird for spin class and weird enough for college radio? Montreal-based five-piece Pottery fit squarely within these parameters, wide as they are. Welcome to Bobby’s Motel, their full-length debut and follow-up to last year’s No. 1 EP, evokes the jubilant freakiness of the genre’s progenitors—Devo and The B-52s, chiefly—with a yawp like Parquet Courts (with whom they toured in 2019), so eager to ride the groove that they often scale up into shouts. Along this yardstick, the record teases the far-out, the riotous, and the anthemic, and in its efforts to push art-rock boundaries, it comes close to a novel sound, if not an entirely new wave. Album standout “Texas Drums Pt. I & II” demonstrates this reach and ambition, a cowbell-laced, guitar-powered earworm that could play at a soda fountain on Mars. Around three minutes, the pings that signal “go” in a Mario Kart race kick off a raucous second half where the drums build to near-masturbatory excess, like an art-rock version of edging. It feels more like a late house-show finale than self-indulgence, locking into a rhythm that crests on energy rather than depleting it. This bombast flavors most of the tracks on Bobby’s Motel, but “Reflection,” which one could mistake for an homage to Peter Gabriel’s So, cools the frenzy right on time, so the sweat can dry and Pottery can lament a culture of superficiality without tenderness. “Old receipts and body cream, where’s your passion?” they ask, and halfway through the song, they harmonize about the weight of empathy, a departure from the preceding raucousness. They are adept at finessing the soft alongside the hard, the goofy alongside the baleful. It’s only due to this sharpness and surprise that other moments on the album feel dull. “Hot Heater” might be a standout track on a lesser record, but it’s less zesty than counterparts like “Under the Wires” or “Take Your Time” and more tepid than its name implies. Closer “Hot Like Jungle,” with its jingle bells and Rick Astley croon, stagnates at mid-tempo and comes closer to reaching for the ashtray than the stars. This band is at its best operating at the edge of kitsch and excess, as with the “Monster Mash” voice inexplicably mumbling over “Bobby’s Forecast.” Groups like Pottery are a cootie shot against self-seriousness and boredom, and on subsequent albums, one can only hope they further indulge these freakier impulses, as jet-powered and stratospheric as the weirdos who made waves before them.","On their debut, the Montreal art-rockers come off like a cootie shot against self-seriousness and boredom.
